Written by: Tim Herlihy and Adam Sandler. Starring: Adam Sandler, Henry Winkler, Kathy Bates, Fairuza Balk. Ingredients: 31-year-old Louisiana bayou mama's boy, football . Synopsis:  In HAPPY GILMORE (1996) written by Tim Herlihy and Adam Sandler, Adam Sandler plays a loser raised by his loving grandmother, who learns to channel his aggression into golfing prowess, and becomes an instant sensation.
The subplot involved a love interest and a big important game.
In THE WATERBOY (1998) written by Tim Herlihy and Adam Sandler, Adam Sandler plays a loser named Bobby, raised by his loving mother, who learns to channel his aggression into football prowess, and becomes an instant sensation.
The subplot involved a love interest and a big important game.
Opinion:  Call it the Forrest Gump factor.
Underdog Bobby Boucher has a prounounced southern accent and the formidable intelligence quotient of a box turtle, but he also possesses a kind heart and a steadfast devotion to Mama (Kathy Bates, parodying a hillbilly).
Of course, Bobby the Kindhearted makes it to the big time, has a crisis of confidence, and plays a high stakes finale.
Sure, THE WATERBOY is as original as ROCKY V, and annoyingly predictable, but we're suckers when it comes to rooting for the underdog till we get sick of the sequels.
