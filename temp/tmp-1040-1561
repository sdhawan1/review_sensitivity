  Wow, the vampires in Vampires are some slick cats!
Not only do that dress like they just got sucked by one of their mates during a fashion show, but they can leap great lengths and rip apart a man's abdomen with one hand, in graphic, gory manner.
Well, I guess if a man's chest is ripped open, it would be bloody, but, showing it so gratuitously is so unlike John Carpenter.
That is one of the problems with his new film, Vampires, based on the novel Vampire$ by, um, some guy.
The new bite-and-suck film is so violent, it takes away from the stylishness that Carpenter puts on the accent of the film.
James Woods stars as Jack Crow, a vampire slayer.
His buddy (played by Daniel Baldwin) is a sleaze who takes the likings to a hooker who is bitten by the master (Thomas Ian Griffith).
That hooker is played by Sheryl Lee, and she is pretty unnecessary throughout the rest of the movie.
She's just there for some nude scenes, another spot that is unlike Carpenter.
Vampires is easy on cheap thrills and gore, but, tough on plot and sensibility.
Too bad.
This could have been a great film.
Halloween is probably the best horror film around.
I can't believe it is directed by the same guy!
Carpenter has made some good film in the `90s.
In The Mouth of Madness was a scary, intelligent film that was as thought provoking as mind boggling.
The DVD of Vampires is very good.
The trailer is awesome (music supplied by Marilyn Manson) and the sound is dynamic!
Add this to your collection, but, only for the sound and spectacular picture quality.. .
