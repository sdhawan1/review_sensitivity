A veteran returns to the helm, this time directing probably his best = effort ever.
Even though Robert Redford's time as a box-office star in = his younger days are long gone (in the likes of Paul Newman and Steve = Macqueen, in the eary 70's), his progress in the art of American Cinema = never did cease.
Departing the indulgence with complexities in modern = human lives (QUIZ SHOW), THE HORSE WHISPERER, wonderfully merges scarred = lives in a beautiful tale of spiritual and emotional healing.
The film opens into a cold harsh winter sequence followed by a shot of = Grace (Johansson) getting out of bed cheerfully to meet up with her best = friend, obviously a routine but enjoyed by both.
Grace looks forward to = this meeting as it involves her other best friend, a horse named = Pilgrim.
As both of them rode their horses through the snow, gossiping = on boy topics, an unexpected accident occurs.
The result; the death of = her best friend and the loss of part of her right leg.
Pilgrim survived = the accident, heavily scarred and injured.
Deeply shocked with the = incident, Robert (Neill) and Annie (Thomas) struggled to come in terms = with the trauma which had obviously devoid Grace of any form of hope in = life.
Pilgrim's entire persona too, has changed.
Wild and violent, = Pilgrim is no longer the same horse which embraced Grace's love and = care.=20. Knowing how much the horse meant to Grace, Annie put her ladder-climbing = career as a magazine editor on hold to drives both Grace and Pilgrim to = the wild-west to a well known `Horse Whisperer', Tom Booker (Redford).
= The `Horse Whisperer', like Booker is known to have a special talent in = being able to relate to the emotion of horses.
Annie hopes that by = bringing healing Pilgrim, which to her, personifies an icon of hope to = Grace, will ultimately heal her daughter as well.
Little does she know, = Booker will heal just a bit more than Pilgrim.
THE HORSE WHISPERER merges Pilgrim, Annie, Grace, Booker and Robert, = each with their own personal in-bound demons and liberates them; = providing a solution to all but one.
While I will no tell you the = ultimate outcome of it all, I will tell you that Booker's character is = probably one of the greatest `hero' to embrace the screen.
Redford and = Thomas both give Oscar-nominate-able performances as Booker and Annie = respectively.
Two other performances worthy of mention comes from = Johansson as the out-of-hope Grace and of course, who cannot fall in = love with that Brown Wonder, Pilgrim.
Redford's ability as a director may as well earn him some sort of = recognition here.
Even though most will find the pace a tad too slow, = THE HORSE WHISPERER never falters in term of story progression and = character development.
The wonderful cinematography and landscapes = formed the formula for a remarkable visual experience but it too served = in many ways to belittle its characters, making them seemingly powerless = to their surroundings, hence increasing their vulnerability.
Smart move, = Mr. Redford.
THE HORSE WHISPERER is definitely one of the best films I've seen this = year.. .
