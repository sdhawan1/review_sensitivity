The reign of Caesar Marcus Aurelius in the mid-second century A.D. is often considered a golden age of the Roman Empire.
Marcus was  instrumental in securing peace in the nether regions of the Empire, but  was also a philosopher of great renown.
He died in 180 and rule passed to  his son Commodus.
The transition was an orderly one; Commodus was  recommended to the Senate by Marcus, and indeed had been sharing power  with his father since 177.
Commodus' rule, however, would go down in the  history books as disastrous, with the Caesar's demeanour descending into  brutality and ultimately madness.
In 182 his sister Lucilla and a group  of senators tried unsuccessfully to have him assassinated.
Commodus  became obsessed with the gladiatorial games, and in 192 his own advisers  had him strangled by a popular wrestler.
"Gladiator" is a condensed and largely fictionalised version of the true  events.
The most notable addition to the story is Maximus (Russell  Crowe), a general who leads the Romans to victory against the German  tribes to the north.
Contradicting real life, Marcus Aurelius (Richard  Harris) wants Maximus -- not Commodus -- to be Rome's new ruler after his  death, with the aim of eventually turning the empire back into a republic.
Before he can proclaim his decision, however, the deceitful Commodus  (Joaquin Phoenix) murders his father and orders Maximus' execution.
Maximus escapes and tries to return home to Spain, only to discover that  Commodus has had his wife and son killed as well.
Gravely wounded in his  flight, Maximus is captured and bought by Proximo (the late Oliver Reed) to fight as a gladiator.
Initially reluctant, Maximus soon embraces his new role when it gives him a chance to travel to Rome, where the new Caesar has declared 150 days of gladiatorial games to celebrate his  ascension to the throne.
There, Maximus' efforts to take revenge on  Commodus involve him in the machinations of Commodus' sister Lucilla  (Connie Nielsen).
The first blockbuster movie of the 2000 summer season, "Gladiator" is a  visual feast.
Expert set design and computer effects have been exploited  in their fullest by director Ridley Scott to bring ancient Rome to life.
Shots which pan overhead across the city to the Coliseum, teeming with  spectators, are fabulous to behold.
It is difficult not to feel   transported eighteen hundred years back in time.
In some respects, however, Scott overdoes it with his cinematic trickery.
Specifically, he portrays many fight scenes -- both with the gladiators  and the legions -- using a choppy, strobe-like technique.
Scott is  clearly trying to achieve the sense of disorientation in battle that was  so successfully conveyed in films like  "Braveheart" and "Saving Private  Ryan".
Instead, he merely makes these sequences disjointed and hard to  watch.
It is virtually impossible to follow the actions of even the  principal characters, and so the viewer is left to try to piece together  what is actually happening.
It has been more than thirty years since the last great Roman epic was  made.
In reviving the genre, the scriptwriters have elected to hew  closely to tried-and-true storylines rather than break new ground.
"Gladiator" does not deviate much from other examples of the genre,  echoing everything from "Spartacus" to "Doctor Who".
The mad emperor, the resurgent war hero, and the gladiatorial games as a conduit for revenge  are all familiar plot elements.
Nonetheless, the story is entertainingly  told, and while considerable attention is paid to the gladiator combat  which is the movie's main attraction, this is not overaccentuated.
"Gladiator" is no "Mortal Kombat", moving from meaningless battle to  meaningless battle without pause.
The film is very well paced, and the  quieter aspects of the plot are not trivialised.
Perhaps as a result of this, "Gladiator" boasts some unusually fine  acting for a big-budget action picture.
Crowe, although by no means  achieving the complexity of his Oscar-nominated performance in "The  Insider", brings a pleasant depth to Maximus.
The general is a man first  and a hero second; he is driven to confront Commodus not by a love of  Rome, but rather of a man who was as a father to him, and of a murdered  wife and child whose deaths he must avenge.
Crowe brings an evenness to  the role which makes Maximus seem more real than similar characters in  other movies.
Likewise, Phoenix does well not to overplay Commodus.
The role of the insane tyrant has often been an invitation to hammy overacting in the  past, but Phoenix's portrayal is more subtle.
Commodus' burgeoning  madness is manifested largely through his body language, rather than any  particular statement or deed.
Also very good are Reed and Harris in  supporting roles.
Despite their comparatively short screen time (indeed,  Reed actually died before filming was complete, forcing Scott to  compensate using clever editing and digital effects), both grant their  characters a sense of history and profundity.
Perhaps least successful is Nielsen as Lucilla, despite having what may be "Gladiator"'s most involved role.
Lucilla is Commodus' sister, and he  obviously harbors inappropriate feelings for her.
It is also strongly  implied that she is Maximus' former lover.
And she is a dispassionate and  intelligent schemer, whose allegiances may be pivotal in determining  Rome's future.
But Nielsen comes across as detached throughout the  proceedings, more so than is called for by her character.
Even in scenes  where Lucilla's reserve breaks, Nielsen feels removed from the action.
Given her importance in how the events of the movie play out, this is an  unfortunate central weakness.
But all in all, "Gladiator" is entrancing to watch, beautifully acted,  and really just a lot of good old-fashioned fun.
Although far removed from  the greatness of classics like "Ben-Hur", it marks an entertaining and  satisfying return of what was once one of Hollywood's favourite genres.
Indeed, given the possibilities offered by this age of increasingly  sophisticated special effects, "Gladiator" is hopefully just the first  of many forays back to the time of the great Roman Empire.
