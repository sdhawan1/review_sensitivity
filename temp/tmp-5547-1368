THE FIFTH ELEMENT:  A FILM REVIEW BY Jesse A. Kaplan Cast:  Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman, Milla Jovivovich, Chris Tucker, Ian Holm, Luke Perry Directed by Luc Besson. Wow!
When I orginally found out about THE FIFTH ELEMENT (T5E) I was amazed by not only the plot, the effects, the sets, and the casts, but just how what an incredibly different movie it was going to be.
Well now its out all over and has gotten some mixed reviews.
Let me tell you something ladies and gentlemen, this movie is terrific.
All the future will be lost unless the fifth element is found.
I don't even know how to explain the movie so I won't.
Let me say this then.
If you like action, Sci-Fi, great costumes, an amazingly hott up and coming actress, shoot 'em up, futuristic ride of your life the T5E is the movie for you this summer.
Bruce Willis (DIE HARD, PULP FICTION) is at his best as an Ex-Marine turned taxi who has to save the world from annialation from the unltimate evil.
Evil is helped by the crooked arms dealer billioniare Zorg, played by Gary Oldman (THE PROFESSIONAL, AIR FORCE ONE).
Leeloo, as the Fifth Element, the surprime being must be used correctly to defeat this evil with help from a struggling to save priest, Holm, and his assistant.
Once the action moves to the space resort we are met be D.J.
Ruby Rodd ,Chris Tucker (FRIDAY) who is a great cross between Prince, Dennis Rodman, and Orpah Whinfrey.
The sets and costumes and the best part of the movie and the $90 million dolllar budget certainly isn't wasnted at all in this movie.
Definately one of the true hits of this summer.
Although compared to Sci-Fi thrillers such as STARGATE and BLADE RUNNER, T5E works because its not deep at all.
Simply great mindless fun, guarenteed to make your $7.50 worthwhile.
THE FIFTH ELEMENT runs 2:07 and is worth every minute.
It is rated PG-13 for brief female nudity, cartoonish violence, and a little profanity.
A definate winner,  *** 1/2.
