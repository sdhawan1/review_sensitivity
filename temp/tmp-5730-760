US Distribution: Miramax Rated PG-13:  holocaust-related thematic elements. Copyright 1998 Nathaniel R. Atcheson. Roberto Benigni won big this year at the Oscars, snagging up both Best Foreign Film and Best Actor for Life is Beautiful.
The film is actually two pictures in one:  the first is about Guido Orefice (Benigni), and his efforts to woo a young woman (played by Benigni's real-life wife, Nicoletta Braschi).
This portion of the film is wonderfully funny and unrelenting slapstick comedy.
But the slapstick tone is not even marginally appropriate for a Holocaust setting, and so any attempt at humor ends up failing (except for one superb moment in which Guido intentionally screws up in translating orders from a German soldier).
Overall, Life is Beautiful is an ambitious and heartfelt artistic failure.. .
