Ever since my wife bought me a toy "B-9" Robot for our anniversary, I  had wanted to see the newest incarnation of "Lost in Space.
". Aside from the characters, it's not much like the campy 60's series.
(Of  course, I didn't exactly recognize the campiness at the time; I was too  busy hiding my eyes during the alien scenes.
"Lost in Space" was the  only TV show scarier than the monster scenes in "Voyage to the Bottom of  the Sea"!
) . Following the premise of the series occupied much of the running time.
But it's a good premise: the Robinson family's animation is suspended  while the Jupiter 2 cruises to a planet ten years away.
Their journey is  interrupted by a 90's version of B-9 -- only slicker, butch; but the  booming voice is the same.
Anyway, the adventures the family encounters  after they are lost are worth watching: mostly smooth computer-generated  critters, and a version of the vile Doctor Smith that made me and my 12  year-old son shiver.
(No, I'm still not de-sensitized to the horror that  monsters are supposed to instill!
). Though I like William Hurt immensely (no one could have played the  reluctant travel writer in "The Accidental Tourist" better), he is  miscast as John Robinson.
OK -- the head of the family is a heady  scientist, but Hurt I can't see as action hero.
The rest of the cast is  solid -- the ubiquitous Gary Oldman (is he British, or what?
) is  eminently dislikable -- though not nearly as goofy as his television  counterpart.
Get ready for another franchise.
"Lost in Space" is entertaining.
I'd  pay to see a sequel, especially with the chance it might have just a  shade more camp and self-reflexive humor.. . .
