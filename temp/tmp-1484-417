KEEPING THE FAITH [Norton] -- Nothing more than passable fluff, really, which I guess ain't bad, but I do prefer characters that I can truly sympathize-slash-empathize with and I suppose Norton had it toughest: the majority of the movie going public isn't exactly made up of Catholic priests.
Thankfully, first-time director/actors tend to be especially critical of their performances; thus, his character, who bothered me quite a bit until reel three, is absent from the majority of the romantic proceedings.
The subject-matter doesn't lend itself to any particular visual style (other than the typical prose of Nora Ephron, who is thanked in the end credits), so we, as an audience, are left wondering if Nortion can really direct.
But then, there's that whole other mystery entirely: Who ever would've envisioned *Edward Norton* as director of a romantic-comedy?
By the way, Ben Stiller is a genius.Â C+. .
