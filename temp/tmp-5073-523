Stars: Bill Paxton, Hellen Hunt, Cary Elwes, flying cow. Summary: Popcorn movie.
Grade B plot with grade A effects.
I am always happy when a movie like TWISTER comes out because it serves to illustrate just how good movies like TERMINATOR and APOLLO XII (usually dismissed as "just" action movies) really are.
TWISTER is just an action film.
Oh yes, there is a plot, of sorts.
It is flimsy and instantly forgettable.
In short, there is nothing in this movie besides the special effects to make the movie interesting.
The characters are likeable enough, if superficial and empty.
I can't fault the performances of any of the actors, they just aren't given anything to work with.
One gets the feeling that Michael Chriton scripted this one the night before shooting was to commence.
That said, the effects are marvelously done, and there's nothing exactly BAD about the film, just nothing good beyond the work of Industrial Light and Magic.
Grade: -1.5 on the old -4 to +4 scale (0 being average) overall, with a +2 on the effects work.
