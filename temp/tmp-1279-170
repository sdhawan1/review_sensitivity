 President Clinton not withstanding, Senator Jack Stanton has an issue.
It is only two weeks til the Presidential Primary, and he is being accused of something he did not commit.
So we assume.
A very close friend says his daughter is pregnant, and Stanton is the father.
And you thought the Monica Lewinski deal was major.
A political satire that isn't, Primary Colors is a viciously funny, very real comedy/drama about the ups and downs of Stanton's run for President.
Based on the novel by "Anonymous" (later revealed as a Newsweek writer), Colors is a mirror image film: a film that is so real, it doesn't even play for fiction.
John Travolta is so go as Stanton, I forgot that I wasn't watching Clinton himself.
Stanton is a dead ringer for Clinton.
Emma Thompson is no Hilary.
Her Susan is a warm, kind person who wants to win the primary for, not just herself, but for her and Jack.
The rest of Stanton's team includes Henry (British newcomer Adrian Lester), who narrates the film, Richard (Billy Bob Thornton), Daisy (Maura Tierny) and the investigator Libby (Kathy Bates - who's excellent.
).  Colors is a brilliant, hystarical political comedy that is almost as good as the classic Wag the Dog.
Its not only satire, but an important film that could very easily play for history classes, aside from the R rating.
It doesn't just make Stanton look like a womenizer.
It makes him look human.. .
