Ever seen a film so well-constructed, so accomplished every moment, one to the next, you get chills?
That happened to me about ten times during the brilliant, brilliant, brilliant AMERICAN BEAUTY.
Hard to describe, and how often does that happen to movies, BEAUTY stars Kevin Spacey (in _the_ performance of 1999) as Lester Burnham, a self-proclaimed loser who tells us candidly hešll be dead soon.
He feels dead already, anyway, so his presage sounds like that of someone content with, at least, knowing how things are going to turn out, knowing they gave a crack at changing their dolorous existence for the better while they still had a chance to.
As opposed to living in a constant state of numbness, and certainty life will always be unsatisfactory and the best to possibly hope for, from it, is to occasionally experience mediocrity.
Noone around you respects you, youšre stuck in a dead-end job, home and family couldnšt be more wrought with dysfunction -- so much so that itšs like everybody knows their role, and nobody even feels connected to themself any longer.
I canšt imagine a lower form of being, which is right AMERICAN BEAUTY kicks off.
Lester canšt take anymore.
The day to day to day emotional void; the resent laying dormant, just below the surface, chafing everything.
The nagging sense of detachment.
His power- trip wife, Carolyn (a most energetic Annette Bening), places too high a value on their couch, and dresses professionally to tend garden; no time for sex.
His daughter Jane (Thora Birch) hates both parents, equally, and wishes they would just go away.
At work, his boss hints around a firing, unless he writes a company letter begging them to keep him on.
Hopeless scenario.
Then, Lester meets two individuals whošll turn things around.
One is Amanda Hayes (Mena Suvari), his daughteršs cheerleader classmate.
At a high school basketball game, he spots the blonde lolita -- in a rather racy dance sequence, ages considered, where itšs just the two of them: Lester alone in the bleachers, spot- light on her -- and is marvelled.
Therešs a great scene right after -- Jane introduces Amanda, and Spacey stares at the girl, mouth agape, stumbling desperately for something to say; itšs an embarassing moment because Spacey plays it with genuine infatuation, crush written all over his face, exposed and vulnerable.
Later, he eavesdrops on an integral conversation which promptly inspires Lester to start working out, get buff.
To impress, at first, but it becomes more about building self-confidence.
Person #2 is Ricky (a mesmerizing Wes Bentley), the new arrival next door with a propensity for filming everything in sight; broken home, itšs a means of escape.
He hooks Lester up with weed and, in another terrific scene, quits his job as a waiter -- probably just as big a waste of time as Lesteršs advertising position -- without batting an eye.
Lesteršs floored by that kind of indifference; friendship is instantaneous.
We also meet Rickyšs domineering Marine colonel father (Chris Cooper), who beats him up for disrespecting privacy and requires a drug test every six months.
Something I canšt recall ever having seen before in a movie.
I didnšt so much agree with that characteršs turn of events, but hešs performed with a firey intensity by Cooper that brings the caricature bully out of cliche zone.
Same goes for the rest of this cast.
Thora Birch, as Jane, with a permanent cautious/troubled gaze, lets us know the isolation of jaded youth from scene one, as she is video- taped by an unseen Ricky who asks her if she wants him to kill her old man.
Birch finds just the right tone and sustains it effortlessly.
She has the generation-angst, sure -- mom and dad (mostly mom) construe her as brat -- but a scarred soul to boot, and the actress looking lovely in her teens, hair dark, face ravaged by repressed emotion, haunts in a knock-out piece of work.
I loved all her scene with Bentley (Supporting nom for this guy, please), the creepy new guy Jane catches spying on her and dismisses with a łfuck you˛.
Face to face, though, Ricky staring directly at Jane, nothing but eye contact, it isnšt so easy since he seems to be looking into her.
Through her.
Getting to know her, which we presume nobodyšs ever taken the time to do, without words -- just pure, unspoken honesty.
Their best scene is spent watching a plastic bag dance in the wind; he explains itšs like God speaking to anyone aware enough to notce.
He notices.
And, therešs the great line, ł... so much beauty in the world, I feel like I canšt take it˛, made all the more powerful by Bentleyšs tear-eyed delivery.
Ricky is observant, forthright:  łIšm not obsessing.
Išm just curious,˛ he tells Jane; or, łYoušre ugly.
Youšre boring.
Totally ordinary.
And, you know it˛ to the superficial Amanda.
Sometimes the words hurt, but theyšre always true.
Itšs a defense mechanism, his brutal honesty, we sense.
We get to sense a lot, with this nuanced portrayal of sophisticated toughness.
I have to go back to Kevin Spacey.
Hešs found a career high.. no minor feat (his work, here, surpasses even GLENGARRY GLENN ROSS - my favorite).
Like Billy Bob Thornton, in last yearšs A SIMPLE PLAN, or Robert Downey, Jr., in TWO GIRLS AND A GUY, this is truly superlative acting.
I always measure the effectiveness of a performance by whether or not I can make out an actoršs face, or if there is only the character; wierd, but it happens.
Only the great ones do that, and in BEAUTY, Spacey does it.
I was glad to see Lester Burnham regain self- esteem.
I cared.
His alliance with the much younger, but only in appearance, Ricky is palpabe and memorable.
His perhaps insalubrious relationship with Amanda is expertly handled.
Lester is turned on by her, and she by him, and that doesnšt go away once the script has established Lesteršs awakening, rebirth so to speak; the sexual longing still remains, even after Lester has become a better personš.
He also loves his wife (quite obviously, from their couch scene), and that doesnšt disappear, either.
This is three-dimensional writing at its best, and the magnetic Spacey makes it unforgettable.
Three specific moments mark AMERICAN BEAUTY -- along with everything else I have said -- best film of the Fall, and year, thusfar:  Rickyšs final, mental revenge against his father; perfect.
The long, aforementioned close-up of a plastic bag, with voice-over; perfect.
And, in the warm, poignant scene between Lester and the underage object of his affection, when she asks him how his life has been; Spaceyšs expression, reflecting back, the way it curls into a triumphant smile moved me to tears.
Bravo to Adam Bellšs uninhibited, progressively interesting screenplay.
Bravo to a stellar ensemble.
Bravo to myriad inevitable Oscar nods.
AMERICAN BEAUTY reminds us, above all, the vitality of indisputably great cinema.
Best line:  "I'm looking for the least possible amount. .
