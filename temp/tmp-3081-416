Written by: Duncan Kennedy, Donna Powers and Wayne Powers. Starring: Saffron Burrows, Thomas Jane, Samuel L. Jackson, LL Cool J, Michael Rapaport. Synopsis:  In a floating research facility called Aquatica, proteins are harvested from the brains of three mako sharks as part of research on a cure for Alzheimer's disease.
Mako sharks, a species where the female is much larger than the male, are some of the fastest, highest leaping fish in the world, as well as possibly the most the most intelligent type of shark and a leader in attacks on boats.
An unfortunate consequence of the Aquatica research is that it enhances the size, invulnerability, and intelligence of the three sharks.
The humans seem firmly in control, but when an accident happens, guess who's got the upper hand?
Opinion: Who will survive?
The beautiful but ice-cold lady scientist, the reformed convict?
The depressed research assistant or her smokaholic boyfriend, the baby-faced engineer, the rich financier, or the cook?
DEEP BLUE SEA is no cliches and all surprises.
It'll put you on the edge of your seat more times than the original Jurassic Park.
DEEP BLUE SEA was the funnest movie I've seen all summer, and I highly recommend it for an outing of scary fun and entertainment.
