Synopsis:  Douglas Hall  (Craig Bierko) has a problem.
His best friend, a rich old computer genius named Hannon Fuller (Armin Mueller-Stahl) has created a virtual 1937 Los Angeles inside a computer simulation that is so realistic that the computer characters think they really exist.
The problem is that Fuller has just been murdered, and all the clues point to Hall as the murderer.
Poor Hall can't remember a thing about where he was the night of the murder despite a bloody shirt.
Hall chases down a possible clue inside the Los Angeles simulation, while trying to prevent the character simulations from finding out that they are not real.
He meets a mysterious woman (Gretchen Mol) and tries to clear himself while exploring the new "reality.
". Opinion: The trouble with THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR is that it's a concept movie.
Characters go through long dialogues passing movie minutes until the film's ending delivers the big "surprise" revelation.
Unfortunately, the revelation is no surprise because this year we've seen similar "reality" revelations from countless other virtual simulation theme movies such as THE MATRIX.
I can recommend the beautifully done cinematography; 1937 Los Angeles is a visual feast.
But there's not enough danger and the end is predictable.
It's hard to pay full attention to THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR for more than half an hour no matter how wonderfully the visuals are rendered.
