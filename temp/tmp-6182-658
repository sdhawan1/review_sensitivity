The rivalry between the two was subtle, well paced, and went through years of the characters lives without leaving the audience feeling cheated on who they characters were becoming.
I left feeling like I knew a great deal about the people involved - perhaps the ultimate success of a film biography.
As a side note, it's unfortunate that Griffiths received somewhat of a second billing in the movie.
She was the stronger performer - playing the role that didn't demand the attention or the eccentricities of Watson's character.
Her performance was vital to the film's success, grounded Hilary and Jackie in sensibility and as a way for the audience to connect to the characters.. .
