Sean Connery, in his 68th role, plays Robert MacDougal, a well-known art thief who matches wits and falls for Gin Baker, an insurance agent played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, fresh off her first starring role in "The Mask of Zorro.
" The film is Jon Amiel's "Entrapment.
" The comment is, "Come on, Mr. Connery.
I never thought I'd say this, but you're out of you're league.
". I'm a little tired, so I'll sum up "Entrapment's" plot rather vaguely.
After a Rembrandt is stolen from a corporate building, Gin Baker(Zeta-Jones), an insurance agent, decides to try to catch the thief(Connery).
Slowly, she starts to like the thief, and she ends up playing both sides; helping him steal, and helping to catch him.
Catherine Zeta-Jones is once again good in the heroine role she perfected in "Zorro", but I'd like to see her try something else(a romantic-comedy, perhaps?).
Sean Connery is also suave as ever.
But the film's plot doesn't always make sense and the movie is too glib for its own good.
Director Jon Amiel wants "Entrapment" to a Bond-style crime caper, but the most it provides is harmless fun.
