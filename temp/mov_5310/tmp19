_The_Blair_Witch_Project_ (R) *** (out of ****). Spanning two centuries and encompassing (among other things) mysterious disappearances, gruesome acts of violence, a rare book, chilling film footage, and a legendary witch, the sprawling mythology that filmmakers Daniel Myrick, Eduardo Sanchez, Greg Hale, Rob Cowie, and Mike Monello have crafted around _The_Blair_Witch_Project_ is massive and murky enough to make _The_X-Files_ creator Chris Carter proud.
It's almost a shame that the film that inspired it all barely scratches the surface of this elaborately constructed piece of modern folklore.
Since unexpectedly jolting audiences at this year's Sundance Film Festival, _The_Blair_Witch_Project_ has been riding a wave of hype and high expectations leading to its July theatrical release.
But the fact that _Blair_Witch_ is an ultra-low-budget indie doesn't make it any more immune to the inevitable feeling of disappointment that accompanies any studio-manufactured object of ballyhoo.
Don't get me wrong; the well-made product is a testament to the triumph of imagination and creativity over financial limitations.
But it functions more effectively as part of a larger multimedia entertainment experience than as a stand-alone film.
The premise is simple enough that it is summed up in one tidy title card at the beginning of the picture: "In October of 1994, three student filmmakers diappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary.
A year later their footage was found.
"  That faux vérité footage is what makes up _The_Blair_Witch_Project_, chronicling from the first person director Heather Donahue, sound guy Michael Williams, and cameraman Joshua Leonard's ill-fated filmic investigation into a legendary witch that haunts Burkittsville, formerly known as Blair.
The project quickly turns from fun--such as interviewing sometimes wacky locals about the legend--to a harrowing struggle for survival as they become lost in the forest, where a mysterious force stalks the trio.
Of course, we all know where this is going, thanks to that opening blurb.
So it's up to writer-directors Myrick and Sanchez to come up with a compelling journey, and they largely succeed.
The perpetually shaky camerawork is annoying at times, but it contributes to the film's greatest virtue--its air of authenticity.
Adding to that is the use of unknown actors convincingly playing humanly imperfect characters named after themselves.
The audience believes they are witnessing real people experiencing real pain, real frustration, and, ultimately, real fear.
That sense of fear extends to the audience, but not quite as strongly as has been made out to be.
There are two scenes in particular that struck me as particularly frightening, but that was about it, and they come fairly late in the game.
In fact, _Blair_Witch_ in just in the midst of developing a head of steam when it ends.
While the film concludes on an appropriately eerie and ambiguous note, its fairly abrupt nature is far from satisfying.
For greater satisfaction, one must see the Sci-Fi Channel's forthcoming tie-in special on the _Blair_Witch_ legend or visit the website, which offers a wealth of information on the _Blair_Witch_ mythology, from the legend's origins to events that take place after those depicted in the film--not to mention the "story" behind the piecing together of the "lost footage" into the 87-minute film.
A taste of this information is provided in the press notes, which I did not read until after the film.
Reading them has indeed made the experience and understanding of the film a bit richer, but that doesn't change what is printed on the celluloid.
As smartly conceived and executed as it is, _Blair_Witch_ the film is basically a fairly familiar tale of three people who must learn to live together and fend for themselves when lost in the forest.
Which is basically to say that _The_Blair_Witch_Project_ isn't quite as special as it has been made out to be; it won't be the breakout hit Artisan Entertainment is hoping for, just a sizable arthouse success.
This is not to say that the film is not worth a look; it is a diverting work of great ingenuity and invention.
It's just that to appreciate the full breadth of the five filmmakers' vision, one must bone up on the supplemental materials.
_Blair_Witch_ the film is ultimately as much of a teaser for its website as is vice versa.
