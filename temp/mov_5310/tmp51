     If youšve been paying attention to the media frenzy that is THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, and who hasnšt, you know the story and you know itšs pure dramatization.
Needless to say, though, watching what has been committed to tape, one gets the undeniable impression the events are veritable:  three students take hand- helds into the woods, filming a school project about the myth of a local witch, and get lost.
No biggie, as the put-upon leader of their crew, Heather, states rationally, "Itšs hard to get lost in America, and itšs harder to stay lost.
"  What starts out fun and games, so to speak, amongst friends (correct "Gilliganšs Island" vernacular; Heatheršs mishap with a pair of wet shoes) quickly becomes something more serious.
Rations dwindle, their only map disappears, and camaraderie gradually disintegrates into bickering, nicotine jonesing and total disorientation.
They set up camp, several times too often, and wake up to vague but ominous noises just in the distance.
And, thatšs the ingenious thing of the film:  the heard, yet unseen, proves to be a lot more terrifying.
Because, try as you may to put whatšs going on into perspective (twigs snap.. probably a small animal), you still donšt know for certain.
And, because there is little light for assistance, you can either stay in one place very quietly and pray, or make a run for it in the pitch black and take your chances.
During Heatheršs emotionally-draining private confessional for the camera, she sums this experience up quite nicely: "Išm afraid to close my eyes, and Išm afraid to open them.
". Whatšs also great about the film is its budget.
The point of view footage is antsy, because the actors get antsy and donšt know exactly where to look or where theyšre going in the heat of apparent pursuit.
I think BLAIR WITCH will play even better on the small screen, because of its aspect ratio and the likelihood of a more quiet environment; occasionally, I was unable to hear what the actors were hearing due to an audience loud with throat- clearing and squeaky seats, and it bugged me immensely.
There is no special effects work, no computer-generated anything, and mostly no gory close-ups (save for a set of teeth), which gives the film a great deal of authenticity.
And, what I like most is the eerie conclusion; that last scene, in an abandoned, dilapidated house, is nerve-wracking and more than a little disturbing.
The collective opinion circulating the net at present is that this scene is too quick, and the film ends rather abruptly.
Which is true, but thatšs the point.
It is Heatheršs fear and despondence, come to the breaking point.
After being in the woods for so long, and not knowing what would ultimately happen to them at any given moment ­ whether she, or her friends, would make it ­ she and Mike arrive at one last spot, maze-like and frustrating, and in an instant itšs all over.
You leave with questions, and want to talk about what youšve just witnessed with as many people as you can get it in a room.
Movies that can put you there have done their job; real, or fake (forget the whole is-it-a-sham-or-not business, already).
That final image ­ you know the one ­ is cryptic and haunting.
I wanted more scenes at night, with ­ not _clearer_ sounds, but I donšt know, more of them.
Even greater a building of exhaustion and fear.
The film does not quite go the psychological distance, but itšs close.
Also, the arguing goes on a little much for my taste (one fight, over the whereabouts of the map, turns especially shrill), though such carrying-on is understand- able, circumstances considered.
"Scary as hell" no.
Creepy, yes.
Effective, brilliantly- conceived and executed, and performed with all the conviction in the world so that even if we doubt what wešre seeing is real, suspension of disbelief is never an issue:  _oh yeah_.
Best line:  90% improv equals no cleverly constructed dialogue; I like the reaction Heather has to a shot of scotch (I hate it, too).. .
