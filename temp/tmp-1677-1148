Capsule Review:     To audiences used to movies that tell you how to feel, director Atom  Egoyan's new film may seem like a cold, lifeless ordeal.
The more  discerning and patient viewer, however, will find this to be a mournful,  absolutely shattering cinematic experience, possibly the best of the  last year.
Ian Holm gives a magnificent performance as an ambulance  chasing attorney whose self-serving attempts to heal a small Canadian  community's pain after a horrific accident only ends up ripping new  wounds.
Egoyan, previously best known for the dark puzzle EXOTICA,  displays an astonishing mastery of the medium here, freely mixing  timelines in order to view the tragedy from all sides.
(He makes an  especially resonant and inspired connection with the fable of The Pied  Piper of Hamlin.
) The result is a film that affects the watcher in a  delayed, haunting fashion; you don't realize you've been hurt until  you glance down and see the blood.
