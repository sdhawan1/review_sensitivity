 It is also a very slick, imaginative, thrilling film from director John Frankenheimer, whose 1996's film, Island of Dr. Moreau, left little to be desired.
The plot involves a bunch of international operatives (some ex-KGB) joining together to steal a briefcase away from a very powerful and wealthy man.
What's in the briefcase we don't know.
Neither does Sam (Robert De Niro), the so-called leader of the operative group.
If you're thinking that bit resembles Pulp Fiction, you're not alone.
Tailing the briefcase all over Europe, Sam and his elite group (including Jean Reno) set up all kinds of booby traps and whatnots to trap the man and briefcase.
The film has a sort of James Bond feel to it, yet, generates more energy from its action sequences than any 007 film I have seen, including 1997's Tomorrow Never Dies.
De Niro and Reno work great together.
They have that rare flare for acting that never goes stale, even in the midst of a film like Ronin, which, if you get right down to it, is very intelligent, atmospheric, and dopey.
One thing that really heightens the film to intensity are its spectacular car chase scenes.
They are among the best I have seen.
A long drawn-out one, featured in the now-famed tunnel where Princess Diana died in Paris, is a dizzying, frenzied, pure rush or energy.
Director Frankenheimer has abandoned Moreau's Island and created a very sassy thriller, and some breathtaking views, in Paris and Rome.
Do Sam and the gang capture the briefcase?
You'll never look at a car the came again.. .
