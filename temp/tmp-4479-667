Susan Granger's review of "A.I.
: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE" (Warner Bros.). Steven Spielberg is a cinematic genius.
So was Stanley Kubrick.
But  this unconventional, collaborative effort may mystify movie-goers.
Some will be beguiled, as I was.
Others may be frustrated and/or  disappointed.
Told as a sci-fi fairy tale for adults, the story revolves  around a perfect robotic child named David (Haley Joel Osment),  adopted by a Cybertronics employee (Sam Robards) and his wife  (Frances O'Connor) whose own seriously ill child (Jake Thomas) has  been cryogenically frozen.
David is programmed to love, but those  around him aren't - because he's 'mecha' (mechanical), not 'orga'  (organic) - and, therein, lies his dilemma.
Like Pinocchio, he yearns to  be a real boy.
But how?
When he's abandoned with only his supertoy  Teddy bear as a companion, he's sets off in search of a dream.
Steeped  in romanticism, the plot is divided into three segments: the domestic  drama, the quest or odyssey, and then the futuristic underwater/ice  sequences, a consequence of global warming.
This fragmentation  breeds problems.
In the darkly disturbing road trip, for example, David  meets up with Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a 'love mecha,' who takes him to  the Flesh Fair, a nightmarish carnival, filled with robot torture devices.
Then the eerie, sentimental third segment evokes "E.T.
" and "Close  Encounters of a Third Kind," moving grandly, yet tediously.
There's a  lack of cohesion, a feeling of schizophrenia.
Hayley Joel Osment  is  truly amazing and Jude Law is charismatic.
The rich visuals - sets,  costumes and creature/make-up effects - are stunning.
On the Granger  Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "A.I.
: Artificial Intelligence" is an  unpredictable, intriguing 10.
Love it or hate it, it's a triumph of  innovative film-making, a blend of science and humanity, and a  brilliant collaboration of two acknowledged masters.. .
