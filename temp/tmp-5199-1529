        Watching Robert Duvall's newest movie is a incredible experience.
As the film progresses you will begin to see what, quite possibly, is one of the most unique and thought provoking movie I have ever seen.
To call this film anything less than a fascinatingly intense character study would be, in a word, sacrilege.
At the start of the film you get the idea this isn't typical Hollywood fair, Sonny(Robert Duvall) tells a injured young man and his wife about God, and comforts them in their moment of need.
Sonny may not be the typical minister.
He admits that he is flawed and that he has problems with drinking and faithfulness to his wife,  Jessie(Farrah Fawcett).
His wife has had enough of his cheating and has an affair with a young minister, Horace(Todd Allen).
Sonny gets a little drunk and goes to talk with Jessie at their son's baseball game.
When Horace tried to stop Sonny from taking his family away from the part, Sonny strikes him with a bat and he is put in a coma.
Sonny, fearing legal repercussions, flees to Louisiana.
He meets a few people and starts a church, along with a fellow minister, Brother Blackwell(John Beasley).
He knows, and the audience knows, that Sonny(re-baptized Apostle E.F.) will not escape the long arm of the law.
How he changes the lives of several people in the town, shows you can be a good Christian and a sinner.
This film is easily one of the top five of the year, and a milestone in Christian film making.
Robert Duvall's performance is the best one I have seen, since Billy Bob Thornton's incredible roll in Sling Blade.
The script it tight and the direction is great.
I really loved this film's ability not to be to preachy to the audience and doesn't force them to side with Sonny.
The movie's emotional look at the topic of religion and society is almost refreshing.
This is a triumphantly brilliant film, Duvall's performance is the best of the year and deserves the Best Actor Oscar.
Go see it!. .
