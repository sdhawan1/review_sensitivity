Affliction is a riveting piece of entertainment on all respective levels.
The acting is extraordinary, the story is captivating and the atmosphere is chilling and effective.
While there are numerous sub-plots about family confrontations and small-town murder, Affliction is really only about one man who is being pushed over the edge.
That man is Wade Whitehouse (Nick Nolte), a small-town sheriff and divorced father, who is living a complicated and frustrating life in the snow covered surroundings of New Hampshire.
The first half of the story rotates largely around Wade's best friend Jack Hewitt (Jim True), who accompanies a business man on a hunting expedition only to witness him shoot himself.
While Jack stresses it was just a freak hunting accident, Wade thinks there is something more to it.
And so he uncovers a possible conspiracy involving his boss (Holmes Osborne), and the victim's son-in-law.
But Affliction is, by no means, a murder mystery.
The real emotional charge comes care of Wade's relationship with his drunken, abusive father (marvelously played by James Coburn).
Director Paul Schrader (veteran scribe of such films as Raging Bull and Taxi Driver) uses flashbacks to introduce us to the Whitehouse family problems, and this approach is incredibly effective, especially on the basis of visual presentation.
Schrader presents the footage in a fuzzy, worn appearance, much like an old home video filmed with the picture out of focus.
Some people may find this tedious, but the effect is profoundly striking.
Affliction turns into Wade's incomparable struggle to come to grips with everything in his life.
He's fighting a custody battle with his ex-wife (Mary Beth Hurt) for his daughter he cares for but can't rightfully support, the appearance of his father puts an awkwardness on his current relationship with local waitress Maggie Fogg (Sissy Spacek), and on top of it all he has an incredible toothache.
Wade Whitehouse is a troubled human being living a turbulent life, and some may find it difficult to watch as it spirals out of control.
The standout reason to see Affliction is the incredible performances.
While Coburn's performance is phenomenal and downright chilling, it's Nolte who owns the screen.
This is the breakout performances of the actor's career, and he leaves no margin for error in his portrayal of the troubled sheriff.
His performance is commanding and immensely powerful.
I also found much to like in the performance of Willem Dafoe as Wade's younger, more civilized brother.
Dafoe's presentation is initially limp, but we come to relate to his quiet and dignified character.
Schrader uses Dafoe as a voice-over narrative in sporadic instances, but doesn't go overboard.
The director knows his actors are competent enough to set the point across themselves, and rarely relies on this familiar narration approach.
Nick Nolte has taken to his role as Wade Whitehouse like a bull by the horns, and the riveting outcome of the movie is directly because of his amazing performance.
While James Coburn won an Oscar for his role (and rightfully so), Affliction should always be remembered as Nolte's movie.
For the first time in years, the actor's fierce aggression on screen does not seem forced, not even marginally.
His character is so overwrought with paranoia, family issues and business problems and Nolte's delivery seems completely and utterly perfect.
While the ending of Affliction is rather simplistic, it creates a shocking final effect that hits right at home in the heart of the viewers, like a single brick landing with a resounding Â‘thud' at your feet.
The snowy November weather only assists as Affliction, a startling character drama with a superb cast, succeeds in stopping your blood cold.
