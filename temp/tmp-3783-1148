Deserves Recognition for: Making me laugh hard enough to almost  completely obliterate all memories of Shadows and Fog.
Capsule Review:     I'm going to go out on a limb here and call this consistently  hilarious, and surprisingly raw (Has Soon-Yi been bringing home Kevin  Smith videos or something?
) look at the thin line between fiction and  plagiarism Woody Allen's most satisfying film since Annie Hall.
Allen,  even more neurotic and self-loathing than usual, plays a successful  author catching hell from both the people around him and their thinly  veiled fictional counterparts.
(The all-too-brief vignettes that we get  to see of his writing contains some of Allen's finest absurdist humor  since Bananas, including a Star Wars themed bar mitzvah that made me  briefly consider changing my religion.
)     As usual, Woody is backed by some stellar talent, including  Julia-Louise Dreyfuss, Mariel Hemmingway in a sly reversal of her  Manhattan role, a surprisingly capable Demi Moore, and the wondrous Judi  Davis, who once again proves that no other actor can make a 10-or-12  letter obscenity detonate off the screen quite the way she can.
Harry  may shock some long-time Allen viewers by its sheer mean-spiritedness,  but it's a quality that seems to have sprung the director from the  stale complacency that's marred much of his recent work.
As long as he  can stay away from the Bergman influence for a while, this bodes well  for The Woodman's cinematic future.
