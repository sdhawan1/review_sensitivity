For the past few years, most movies set during World War II have been  more about the mentality and morals of war than about simple military  adventure and heroics.
Even the last great submarine movie, "The Hunt For  Red October," was as much a character study of Sean Connery's Captain  Marko Ramius as it was a Tom Clancy actioner.
"U-571" bucks this trend,  hearkening back to the simple but exciting Saturday matinee flicks which  were so popular half a century ago.
The plot here is straightforward, existing mainly as an excuse for  deep-sea dramatics.
A British destroyer has crippled a German U-boat,  the U-571.
The Allies are aware that the submarine is equipped with an  Enigma device -- the key to unlocking Nazi ciphers, and possibly to  winning the War.
An American sub is sent out to reconnoitre with U-571,  poising as a German supply ship.
The American troops are to seize the  vessel, capture the crew, and bring the Enigma back to their ship.
All  this has to be done without the Nazis getting suspicious, because if they  find out the Allies have the Enigma, they'll just change their codes and all will be for naught.
The mission, led by young up-and-comer Executive Officer Lieutenant  Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaughey), goes smoothly at first.
Then the  American sub gets torpedoed, killing most of its crew except for the  U-571 boarding party.
Trapped on the damaged German submarine, Tyler and  his remaining men have to find their way back to Allied territory before  they're discovered by the Nazis.
In terms of being sheer popcorn fare, "U-571" does a pretty good job.
Although the film takes too long to get going, things heat up nicely once  the Americans are trapped on board the U-boat, and the tension keeps  building from there.
Particularly exciting is a lengthy sequence in which  the sub is being depth-bombed by a Nazi ship.
Having devised a desperate  plan for survival, Tyler orders his crew to take the dilapidated vessel  deeper than it should go even under normal operating conditions.
The  explosions get nearer and nearer; the groaning of the bulkheads grows  constantly louder.
It's an engrossing piece of cinema.
But other plot developments are more routine.
For instance, in the  aftermath of the explosion of their ship, the Americans find the Nazi  captain of the U-571 (Thomas Kretschmann), still manacled after his initial  capture, struggling to stay afloat.
In an act of mercy, Tyler has him  pulled out of the water and chained up in the engine room.
I was counting  the minutes until the captain betrayed the Americans, and my expectations  proved correct on not one but two occasions.
A lot of the movie feels  like this: standard action/military scenes transposed onto the submarine  setting.
"U-571's" biggest deficiencies, though, lie in its almost total lack of  characterisation.
Part of what makes other war movies, like "Saving  Private Ryan," so good is that each of the soldiers involved are  portrayed with depth and feeling.
They might not have a lot of screen  time, but they feel like real people with real lives nonetheless.
The same cannot be said of the cast of "U-571", who prove to be a  faceless, unmemorable bunch.
Even the main stars play cookie-cutter  characters.
Take McConaughey's Andrew Tyler, for example.
At the start of  the movie, he argues with his commanding officer, Mike Dahlgren (Bill  Paxton) about whether he's ready for his own command.
Dahlgren doesn't  believe he is, and explains why.
By the end of "U-571", surprise  surprise, Tyler has learned exactly those lessons Dahlgren had described.
You could almost check them off a list as they come up.
Tyler is just a  standard military action hero, and what attempt there is to flesh him out  comes across as transparent and uninspired, like the above.
McConaughey  does a decent enough job as the heroic lead, but to propel it, "U-571"  needs its lead to be more interesting than that.
The other headliners are similar non-entities.
Harvey Keitel plays the  Chief as if he'd just stepped out of any one of a hundred similar movies.
He's an old sea dog who hands out spoonfuls of advice every few scenes on  cue.
Jon Bon Jovi, in his acting debut, is passable but forgettable as  Tyler's best friend, Pete Emmett.
Paxton is surprisingly lacking in  passion or involvement as Dahlgren.
At least "U-571" looks good.
Despite the limited choices of location and  camera angles, director (and co-writer) Jonathan Mostow keeps our eyes  glued on the screen.
There are some nice shots, for instance, where the  camera actually follows the submarine as it dives beneath the waves.
On  the other hand, one thing Mostow seems to attempt with success is to  convey a sense of claustrophobia in the leaky submarine.
Characters sweat  and look about nervously, and water drips from every corner.
But the feeling that those metal walls are closing about them -- just barely keeping out  the crushing ocean waves -- simply isn't there.
As light entertainment, you could certainly do worse than "U-571".
It's  fun and exciting, and every now and then might even set your pulse racing  a little faster.
But ultimately, as a big-budget update of those old  postwar action films, Mostow has borrowed a few plot elements and  characters too many.
And in the end, that's what sinks "U-571".
