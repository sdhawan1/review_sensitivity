Starring:        Hugh Grant, Jeanne Tripplehorn, James Caan. Mickey Blue Eyes is a very funny movie, and what makes it so funny is that very few of the laugh lines have been shown in the previews and promotional clips.
That's especially amazing because Hugh Grant has been seen `everywhere' extolling the virtues of this latest picture, co-produced by his girlfriend, Elizabeth Hurley.
Too many movies lately have been ruined by the overexposure of the `funny' scenes.
They are like connect-the-dot puzzles that tell you all.
You simply have to put them in the proper order.
With Mickey Blue Eyes you are aware of the basic storyline.
Hugh Grant plays a square type of individual.
He is an auctioneer who has fallen in love with Gina, an elementary school teacher (Tripplehorn).
He proposes marriage, in a hilarious scene that's stolen by the Chinese waitress.whoops, that's ownerwho involves herself in the proposal.
It's vignettes like this that make you think about small `supporting actress' possibilities.
He discovers that his possible future father-in-law, Frank (Caan) is a member of the mob, who `launders' money for them.
It is the merging of the two lifestyles that gives us the wonderful basis of the film.
This is not award winning movie making by any means but it is a very enjoyable film, well worth the price of admission.
Although it is rated PG-13, I really don't think that it's aimed at children.
There's nothing so bad that they shouldn't see it, but it's not an example of what they should emulate.
Rather than taking the kids to it, go by yourself and sit back and laugh.
I really want to see this again, but it's probably one of those flicks that I'll catch on free TV and watch more than once.
For what it is, I give it an A-, an excellent light, romantic comedy.. .
