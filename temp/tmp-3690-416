Starring: Franka Potente, Moritz Bleibtreu and Herbert Knaup. Synopsis:  In a phone call Lola (Franka Potente) learns that her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) will be killed by a drug dealer unless she and Manni cough up 100,000 deutschemarks in the next 20 minutes.
This sends Lola on a frantic dash for cash to the accompaniment of mod music and scenes of a lot of running (hence the title RUN LOLA RUN).
Opinion: Remember the film GROUNDHOG DAY where Bill Murray played Phil, the sarcastic weatherman who got to redo the day several times until he finally performed the day the magical way it was fated to happen?
Same deal here, only instead of Phil the sarcastic weatherman we get the MTV treatment.
We cheer for Lola the cute, hyperkinetic, screaming punker girl with army boots, tatoos, and color-dyed hair as she high tails it to Daddy's bank.
Lola's got 20 minutes to succeed, the stakes are deadly, and she doesn't get as many chances as Phil did.
It makes for a fun and quirky collage as small details happen right and left which change fate like shards in a kaleidoscope.
