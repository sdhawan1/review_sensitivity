It is usually difficult for child stars to prove that they can play grown-up roles.
There is no doubt that Christina Ricci has made the transition.
She is a wonderful slut!
How times have changed.
There was a day when young girls prepared for a date by pinching their cheeks to give them a touch of blush.
Christina pinches her nipples!
Without a doubt, Christina doesn't care for anyone but herself, but she makes every male think that he is special to her allowing her to "use" them in various ways.
When her stepfather dies, the sixteen year-old Christina leaves home to live with her half-brother [Martin Donovan] whose gay lover has recently died, leaving him financially independent.
Christina manages to seduce his new lover, and then convinces him that he is the father of her expected child.
Lisa Kudrow, as the sister of the dead lover, does not like Christina, and makes no attempt to hide her feelings.
In a very unglamorous role, she turns in an excellent portrayal of a woman with   deep feelings, who needs to be loved.
Luckily for her, Lyle Lovett comes along.
But as a local sheriff, he's there for other reasons as well.
This is a memorable movie.
It does a good job of portraying the world of a gay man in today's society.
It'll make you laugh as well as cry.
This is definitely not a movie for everyone, but if you like it...you'll love it.
I give it a firm B.. I'd watch it again on TV, but some of the scenes will probably be cut out.. .
