I joked with my friend before the movie that wouldn't it be funny if the big plot twist was that Pacino is the devil, which was told in the trailer.
When I came to the realization that this was the big plot twist I didn't care, I was too busy being entertained.
This movie is fun.
I liked it a heck of a lot.
Reeves plays a lawer, with 64 straight convictions, recruited into a lawfirm in New York.
This sets up several amazing scenes that revel in briliant set construction and production design.
A building's rooftop has water that reaches the sky.
A fun scene as Pacino walks dangerously close to the edge, looking over the vast, dangerous city.
Reeves is also married to Charlize Theron, they settle into a grand apartment.
While he works cases, she stays home and fixes it up.
She is also slowly driven insane, alone.
Pacino and Theron are both perfect in their roles.
Pacino has a egotistical way of using his motions to alow you to see that something more devious is brewing.
Theron, one of the most talented new actresses, is fun in a role that is somewhat minimalist.
Yet she makes it her own.
Poor Reeves, acting next to these two great performers is somewhat stale but still right for the role.
He has this southern drawl that is annoying and disappears (and good ridance) in cerain scenes.
All that said, this movie is a great entertainment.
Both funny and sexy with a great climatic monologue from Pacino.
He goes so over-the-top in this film, yet you have a feeling Pacino knows exactly what he is doing, He's always great.
Yet it is Theron who consistantly suprises me.
She is great looking and that probably detracts from her acting ability, with this film she proves that we can expect great performances from her.
Her last effort Trail And Error had me thinking that might be so, this confirms it.. .
