 I would even say that I liked it better than The Fugitive, the 1993 Harrison Ford vehicle for which Marshals is a sequel, or spin-off, of, so to speak.
Tommy Lee Jones stars again as U.S.
Marshal Sam Gerard, the ruthless, unstoppable cop who tracked down and help find innocent Dr. Richard Kimble (Ford) the first time out.
Here, he is back in top form, tracking down another fugitive, played by Wesley Snipes.
He is framed (?
) for the homicide of two FBI agents in New York, transfered in a plane for convicts, but escapes after the plane is forced to make an emergancy landing in an exciting crash sequence that tops, even, the bus crash in Fugitive.
Marshals is a very well-made thriller.
Director Stuart Baird has captured the style and essence of Andrew Davis (who directed the original), and, I think, added his own extra special hand.
There is a literally edge-of-your-seat scene at a cemetery, during a funeral, which has an assassin on the roof top of the church shooting as our hero Jones as he trys to flee for his live.
U.S.
Marshals is brainy fun, and visually spectacular.
And seeing Jones in a giant chicken costume is worth admission alone.
