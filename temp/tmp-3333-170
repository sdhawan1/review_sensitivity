 Slidings Doors just misses its case and locks-out fast.
It's a fantasy about Helen (Gwyneth Paltrow) who is fired from her job, goes home early to discover her boyfriend in bed with an American girl (Jeanene Triplehorne), and changes her life.
She cuts off her long, brown hair and dyes it blonde.
But, that's when Sliding Doors takes another course.
Helen No.
2 continues her life as a blonde, while Helen No.
1 misses her train home, and doesn't know about the other women.
An interesting premises that has its moments, but flattens out near the end.
Paltrow is great as Helen, and does a great British accent.
But, the film could have covered so many things about parallel lives instead of featuring a romantic subplot.
John Hannah, as Helen No.
1's new beau, ranges from charming, to just annoying.
Sliding Doors is a nice time-passer, but, slaps you on the ass on the way out.
