Did anybody notice that Roger Ebert gave "Anaconda" three and a half stars?
This fact made me feel better about giving "Conspiracy Theory" four stars.
You see, I have yet to find anyone out there, critic or no, who thought that "Conspiracy Theory" was a great film.
I figured there must be something wrong with me.
I saw it twice, TWICE and both times I was blown away and came out of the theater knowing it would be near the top of my "Top Ten of 1997" list.
When I noticed that nobody I could find seemed to like the film as much as me, I started to worry.
Was something wrong with me?
What did I miss that made everybody else so reluctant to praise this fine film?
But did anybody notice that Roger Ebert gave "Anaconda" three and a half stars?
"Conspiracy Theory" was one of the only movies that I actually thought "Best Actor Nomination?
" while I was watching it.
Mel Gibson blew me away, as always.
Do I have a sub-concious Gibson fetish?
It happened last year with "Ransom".
I loved it and put it at number one for my "Top Ten of 1996" list.
Nobody seemed to agree!
What am I seeing in these movies that everybody else is missing?
But then again, did anybody notice that Roger Ebert gave "Anaconda" three and a half stars?
Julia Roberts is getting high acclaims for her work in "My Best Friend's Wedding", one of the most overrated films of the year.
It was stale, it was way underdevloped, and it lacked any appeal.
But people are applauding it and leaving "Conspiracy Theory" to dwindle in box office death?
Shame shame!
Oh well.
I am standing my ground with giving "Conspiracy Theory" four stars.
I thought it was fantastic.
I can understand someone giving it less .
.
.
maybe even three stars from some of those harsh critics.
But less than three????
Come on!!
"Conspiracy Theory" comes highly recommended from me.
Just be warned that nobody else seems to agree.
But by the way, did anybody notice that Roger Ebert gave "Anaconda" three and a half stars?. .
