Starring: Bruce Willis, Diane Venora, Richard Gere, Sidney Poitier. Synopsis: A hit man who goes by the name of Jackal' (Bruce Willis) is hired to kill a politician who is to make a speech from a podium in front of a hospital.
Instead of staking out a sniper position on a nearby building, Jackal gets fancy.
He flies to Quebec and purchases a giant Gatling gun (a swiveling machine gun with several barrels that can fire thousands of rounds a minute).
Of course, as a foundation for the gun, he purchases a super strong metal alloy stand and a minivan, plus special expensive uranium bullets and a remote control computer device that enables him to use his ball-point pen as a joystick.
He also sprays special poison on the door of the van in case anyone tries to get in.
Finally, Jackal purchases a yacht so he can sail the Gatling gun into the United States undetected.
Typical of the logic the authorities use to catch the Jackal are statements like: "There's a 3000 mile border between Canada and the US.
The criminal could be anywhere!
Hmm.
Why don't we try checking the Chicago Yacht Club?
" So they send 30 agents to the yacht club, and sure enough, there's the Jackal, and a gun battle ensues.
Will the authorities catch Jackal before he commits murder?
Opinion: The writing often makes or breaks a movie.
Good movies are able to ensnare you in the plot, until you're on the edge of your seat and committed to seeing the movie through to its conclusion.
Not-so-good movies consist of two or three action-packed scenes introduced by irrational jumps in logic and connected by long stretches of pointless wandering around.
In The Jackal' the talents of stars Poitier, Willis, and Gere, and Venora are not enough to rescue a poorly written script, although the two or three action scenes are good, if you can wait around long enough for them.. .
