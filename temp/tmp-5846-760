US Distribution: MGM Rated R: language, violence, sexuality. Copyright 1998 Nathaniel R. Atcheson. Claire Danes, Giovanni Ribisi, and Omar Epps make a likable trio of protagonists, but they're just about the only palatable element of The Mod Squad, a lame-brained big-screen version of the 70s TV show.
The story has all the originality of a block of wood (well, it would if you could decipher it), the characters are all blank slates, and Scott Silver's perfunctory action sequences are as cliched as they come.
By sheer force of talent, the three actors wring marginal enjoyment from the proceedings whenever they're on screen, but The Mod Squad is just a second-rate action picture with a first-rate cast.. .
