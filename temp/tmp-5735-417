RETURN TO ME [Hunt] -- I learned many, many of David Duchovny's weak points in this film: (1) I cannot, under almost any circumstances, truly picture him -- or believe him -- as an architect; (2) He looks horrible in a tuxedo, but, somehow, manages realism in a bloodied one; (3) A dog can cry better than he can; (4) At the onset of dancing, he appears resolutely feminine; (5) None of it matters: He shares great chemistry with the lovely Minnie Driver, and the premise is too contrived to be accidental (movies like this, so long as they maintain their charm, are allowed a free pass for their plot -- even Pleasantville relied on a preposterous plot device in order to "leap into" its subject matter), and Bonnie Hunt, though I suppose she could use a few more directing lessons, maintains her title as Hollywood's best gal pal (her acting ability is not in doubt, but I fear her in a lead) and seems a fairly skilled screenwriter as well.
If, however, the parallel introduction to both characters had been reduced merely to Driver's entrance, the film would've benefited as a whole, but instead I have mild reservations.
