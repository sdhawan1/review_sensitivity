Woo, this is a wild ride of an action movie!
Despite it's elaborately overdone plot line and non-stop (meaning just when you think it's gonna wrap up, it doesn't) action, FACE/OFF managed to knock my socks, shoes, and Levi's off and become my personal pick for best action movie of the year!
The problem with this one is that it does manage to be just a bit too much.
Well, maybe a bit more than a bit too much.
But most audiences out for a good action flick aren't going to mind, especially in the midst of such high-energy, richly complex action.
This movie had the potential to be one of the most satisfying movies of the year, but it went just a step beyond and leaves us stuffed silly, perhaps looking for the mental equivalent of Pepto Bismol.
"I can't believe I ate the whole thing!
" to quote the famous commercials.
But even the acting is fascinating when you realize that what you're watching is Nicolas Cage portraying John Travolta portraying Nicolas Cage.
And vice versa.
Subtle mannerisms are awesome to pick out, and when made even more apparent, the audience I was in (including myself) burst into an avid and accepting chorus of laughs.
Someone who doesn't know the plot for FACE/OFF is definitely not going to find it here!
I've never been one to give summaries, but I'm not even going to attempt one with this film!
It's very complex.
I could lay it out in simplicity, but then it would truly lack it's integrity as a great action flick.
So while I can't go into much greater detail, the fact remains that FACE/OFF is by far the best action film yet this year.
And, in case you didn't notice, the year is drawing near to a conclusion.
Far fetched, wildy overdone, and a bit long, FACE/OFF still manages to hold you tight and make you wonder if you're ever going to be let go!. .
