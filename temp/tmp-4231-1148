Directed by Barry Levinson (Rain Man, Toys, Avalon) Written for the screen by Hillary Henkin and David Mamet (Oleanna,  Homicide) from the novel American Hero by Larry Beinhart Starring: Dustin Hoffman, Robert Deniro, Willie Nelson, Denis Leary Year of Release: 1997 Rating: R. Deserves Recognition for: Actor (Hoffman), and an almost Criswell-like  ability to anticipate a certain current scandal. Capsule Review:     This ultra-satirical comedy has a great writer (David Mamet), an  exemplary cast (Hoffman, Deniro, Anne Heche, and Woody Harrelson to name  a few), and a killer, eerily prescient, hook (in order to get a  struggling President reelected , Hollywood & Washington team up to  declare war on an unsuspecting Albania), - so why isn't it funnier,  dammit?
Director Barry Levinson, whose comedic sense has drastically  slipped since the days of DINER and TIN MEN, struggles to find the right  tone here, resulting in a film that, for every scene of genuine  hilarity, all too often just lies there smirking at itself about how  darn clever it is.
Still, there are some truly inspired bits, and  Hoffman does his best work in years as a thinly-veiled caricature of the  legendarily egomaniacal producer Robert Evans.
If for no other reason,  watch it sometime for William H. Macy's cameo as a secret agent with  some definite views on Mexican Desserts.
