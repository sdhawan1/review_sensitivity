`Jim Carrey is Andy Kaufman in Â‘Man on the Moon'.
'. You may think Universal has intended this tagline, which has been attached to the poster and commercial advertising campaign of the new Andy Kaufman biopic, merely to reveal the role Carrey is playing.
But there is more to it than just that.
Carrey doesn't settle on a simple recreation of the late comedian, he inhabits the role - climbing right into Kaufman's skin -  to deliver a triumphant performance so borderline accurate that many will find the comparison to be frightening.
This is one of the most dedicated and remarkable performances I've ever witnessed on screen.
Carrey is already a dead ringer for the daring comic, but he also envelops every ounce of his character to such a startling degree we believe that this could be out-takes of the real Andy Kaufman.
Now, if you've heard that Carrey is essentially the entire show, you've heard right.
But he's just so damn entertaining.
Watching the gifted comedian reenact all of Andy Kaufman's comic shenanigans - the wrestling, the stand-up, the Latka - is truly an astonishing spectacle to admire.
`Man on the Moon' charts, with a sure-footed approach, everything from Kaufman's rise to fame on the sitcom `Taxi' to his sudden death from lung cancer in 1984.
Is there really any exploration into Kaufman's character, or some indication given of his aspirations as an out-of-control comic?
No.
For the most part, director Milos Forman leads us through `Man on the Moon' from the perspective of a curious outsider.
Andy Kaufman was hilarious to some, offensive and obnoxious to others....and his actual nature remains a mystery to many (including the filmmakers).
The film opens in a thoroughly ingenious and side-splitting manner, as Carrey makes his first appearance as Kaufman on a black-and-white backdrop.
He explains that the movie actually sucks because many significant details of his life have been edited and removed.
He then adds he has since edited the movie to meet his approval....and, strangely enough, the film is now completely over.
Carrey watches from the sideline as the credits begin to roll, impatiently rolling his eyes and swinging his arms - until the screen goes black.
After an extended moment of silence, which may cause slight confusion for some audience members, Andy's head pops into the screen and explains he was merely showcasing his unusual brand of humor.
And then, the biographical side of the movie commences.
This is the one and only time we see a flashback of Andy as a child, and then Forman abruptly skips ahead to the introduction of agent George Shapiro (Danny DeVito), who is impressed by Andy's stand-up routine and offers him a stab at showbiz.
From here, Andy's trails lead him to a musical guest spot on `Saturday Night Live', where he mouths the words to the `Mighty Mouse' theme song (to the audience's subsequent delight).
The chance of a lifetime knocks at the door when Andy is offered a role on the sitcom `Taxi', where he is to translate his Foreign Man character (previously seen on `Hollywood Squares') into an immigrant mechanic named Latka.
Andy sees sitcoms as the lowest form of humor, and demands a few additional requirements; namely four separate guest spots for Vegas lounge singer Tony Clifton - who (unbeknownst to many) is actually Andy's obnoxious alter ego.
Carrey's introductory appearance as Clifton - a chubby, ill-tempered jerk layered with prosthetic makeup - receives gales of laughter.
The actor's immeasurable talent comes in handy in imitating the absurd and shocking lengths Kaufman would go to for the purpose of humor.
Both DeVito and Paul Giamatti (playing writing cohort and buddy Bob Zmuda) are kept at a distance, but with their undeniable talent and admirable restraint, they deliver adequate performances.
A similar fate is dealt to Courtney Love (who previously appeared in Forman's `The People Vs Larry Flynt') as love interest Lynn Marguiles, an outsider who is baffled by a great majority of Kaufman's outrageous (and prolonged) acts.
Love is terribly under-used, but her scenes with Carrey strike a certain poignancy, and minor details of their relationship are charming.
There are amusing cameos from the former cast of `Taxi' (including Christopher Lloyd, Carol Kane, Judd Hirsch and Marilu Henner), but this is strictly Jim Carrey's turf.
Even close friends and relatives of Andy have been astonished by his dead-on portrayal.
The research process Carrey must have gone through is almost unfathomable.
Forman directs in a wise, entertaining manner - but do we truly realize who Andy Kaufman was and what he was striving for?
`Man on the Moon' lacks the answer to a few vitally important questions, but at the same time, it celebrates Andy Kaufman's life with more dedication and proper acceptance than any other recreation could.
Perhaps the true inner being of Andy Kaufman was best left to Kaufman himself - but his story is certainly an entertaining one.. .
