The story of Queen Elizabeth I begins when she is a teen-age princess, and her half-sister, Mary, is ruling England, Ireland and France.
Both girls were the daughters of King Henry VIII.
Although Henry had severed relations with the Catholic Church, Mary and her husband Philip of Spain, tried to stop the Reformation and bring England back under the power of the Pope.
It was this struggle between Catholics and Protestants and the supporters of each that dictated the life of Elizabeth.
Elizabeth was a fun-loving girl who wanted to love and be loved.
She adored wearing the very finest of clothes and that trait is well portrayed in the film.
Although Elizabeth came to be known as `The Virgin Queen' this plot explains how that title came to be bestowed on her.
According to this script, she did lose her virginity, only to `reclaim' it.
The film successfully describes a period of history that is not that well known.
The religious issues are graphically depicted, and the intrigues of the period become better understood.
The acting is excellent but no character is totally likeable, not even Elizabeth.
Cate Blanchett matures beautifully as the Queen.
John Gielgud appears in only one scene, as the Pope.
It is sad that we didn't see more of him.
All of the other male stars are wonderful in their parts.
There is some nudity, although it is handled well.
There are also some very bloody scenes that several people found difficult to watch.
It will help you enjoy the story if you are up on your English history, especially the lineage of the Tudors.
The motto of the film is `Absolute Power Demands Absolute Loyalty'.
It does explain itself.
I would love to see this again, mainly for the lovely scenery, costumes and inventive camera angles.
I give it a B+.. .
