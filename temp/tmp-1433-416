Written by: Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard. Ingredients: Shakespeare, Lady dressing like man,. Starring: Gwyneth Paltrow, Joseph Fiennes, Judi Dench. Synopsis: The setting is Old England, in days when only men are allowed to be actors.
Even women's roles are acted by men.
A girl named Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) wants to become a thespian so badly that she dresses up like a man and calls herself Mr. Kent in order to audition for Will Shakespeare's acting troupe.
Meanwhile, separated from his wife and two children, Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) can't seem to find inspiration for writing his play Romeo and Juliet without being in love.
He falls in love with Viola not knowing she is Kent.
Viola loves Will in return, but then Viola's father commands her to become the fiancee of Lord Wessex.
Will love prevail?
Will Romeo and Juliet ever be completed and performed?
Opinion: A movie where everyone speaks Old English, SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE is a farcical, high energy situation comedy with as many pratfalls and quirky characters as any SEINFELD or SPIN CITY episode.
Gwyneth Paltrow excels as the scheming heroine who must always stay one step ahead of others in order to maintain her well-meaning deceptions.
Viola's schemes, along with the joyous sword fighting and swinging around, make SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE a lighthearted and fun romp.
