FREQUENCY [Hoblit] -- Too contrived, with every key event so obviously foreshadowed, to be either lucid, or enjoyed in the silliest context.
Actually, no, that's not right: in fact, the film's final suspense sequence is to be enjoyed only in the silliest context.
That said, the whole project works best a thriller guided by baseball in the vein of Summer Of Sam (which I haven't seen, actually), and the modern day sequences pale in comparison to the older, despite Dennis Quaid's stilted New York accent; most of it doesn't work (why does Hoblit have to give a reason --the Northern Lights -- for their being able to communicate?
), but when it does it's a nailbiter (the aforementioned final sequence in particular, with an odd, disjointed sense of fear and unpredictably, albeit cut off by a laughable turnabout).
Ironically, though, it could've been a masterpiece if it hadn't a hint of the murder mystery, and an actor other than Jim Caviezel in the lead role (though, even he began to grow on me in the final reel). C+. .
