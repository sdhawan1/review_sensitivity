Lost Highway, the most recent Lynch opus makes it's way into theaters just two months after Scream, which markets itself as a scary movie.
Compared to this, it's Care Bear fare.
Saxaphone player Fred Madison (Pullman) and wife Renee (Arquette) start receiving videotapes of their house, and of them sleeping in bed.
They are set on the front porch, unmarked, showing more every night.
This continues until they receive a video showing Fred killing his wife, who has mysteriously disappeared.
Fred is put in jail, and much to the guard's surprise the next morning, someone else has replaced him in his cell.
Mechanic Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty) is his replacement, and we get to see the story of him, how he makes a new friend in mob boss (Robert Loggia) who not only is linked to a guy that makes porn movies (starring Marilyn Manson in a cameo.
) He introduces him to Alice (Arquette again) who strangely looks like Renee.
Sound like a soap opera?
Not really...the chilling aspect is eyebrowless Robert Blake (who sort of has this white clown makeup on) who tells Fred that he is at his house while he is talking to him at a party.
Also, the use of silence is wonderful and had me jumping even when the TV turned on or the phone rang.
The video features a preview for a video all about David Lynch, and it's my guess that some of the bizarre strangeness of this movie could find explanation there.
But until we find the key to open Lynch-world this is just a weird violence-high film noir.
ADDITIONAL NOTE: I have been hearing rumors of a rerelease in February of 2000, if this is true, I highly advise you to go see this film in theater for an even more chilling experience. . .
