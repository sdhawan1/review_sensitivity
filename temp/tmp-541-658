Written and Directed by Alex Proyas Starring Rufus Sewell, William Hurt, Kiefer Sutherland, Jennifer Connelly. Dark City is such a rare treat: itšs a stunning, hyperkinetic vision of a place where our reality is fused with noir, science fiction and the darkest nights in Manhattan and London.
To boot, it is accompanied by an intense, well written and thoughtful story.
Movies of this caliber and idea arenšt made too often, and itšs unfortunate that I waited this long to see it.
Alex Proyas, whošs previous film The Crow looked good but couldnšt cover up the terrible acting or story, here shows a near masterpiece; a combination of Metropolis, Edward Hopper and Phillip Marlowe, fused seemlessly.
At times it moves beyond film into artwork.
It is the story of łstrangers˛, aliens from another planet (and we know theyšre aliens because they shave their heads and wear overcoats  one of the detractions of the film) who experiment on humans to discover what makes them live, what makes up our łsoul˛.
These aliens are superior to humans  because they have mastered the łultimate technology˛ of shaping matter with their mind, called łtuning.
They are aided by a human scientist, played by Kiefer Sutherland, who has łbetrayed his kind˛ and at the start of the film watches as the entire city stops at exactly midnight.
During this time, John Murdoch, played swiftly by Rufus Sewell, wakes in a bathtub in a room with a swinging overhead light (a terrific visual effect - not only is Murdoch confused, but so is the audience).
Without a memory and a strange guilt that he may be a killer, he receives a phone call to flee, as the strangers are after him.
I donšt want to proceed to much further with the explanation of the story; One of the pleasures of the film is watching it develop, in a way regaining Murdochšs łidentity˛ along with him.
Itšs a pleasure to watch the characters develop through the cinematography.
Murdochšs wife, Anna, is introduced through a stunning beam of light: she is a lounge singer who sings into a bright spotlight.
Shadows, outlines of men in hats watch, as she gently curves through the shine.
We see the outline of her body from behind, an hourglass, as she sings a slow, rhythmic song.
A great entrance.
However, a film such as this is only successful if the morals and themes behind it are strong enough to leave the viewer satisfied.
The city is nice to look at, but if itšs a poor story then itšs not worth watching.
Blade Runner was popular not only because itšs visuals, but itšs story and themes were thought out and provoked strong response from the audience.
It is discussed it and argued, therefore a success.
Other science fiction films of recent times, such as the Fifth Element, are nice to look at, but are dropped and forgotten because the cookie cutter moral behind them is so flimsy.
Wešre left with łlove conquers all˛ after finishing the Fifth Element.
Dark City is not so easily explained away.
As the strangers discovered, locating the human soul and discovering what makes us survive is not such an easy task.
Where is reality?
Dark City is certainly the best science fiction film of the 90šs, and ranks along with the best made in the 80s, such as Blade Runner and the two Aliens films.
Perhaps itšs the best of the both decades; it had the darkness of the Aliens films, as well as the visuals and compelling story of Blade Runner, but moved beyond, I think, because the themes behind it were much stronger.
Anyone who wants to make an argument for better science fiction films please feel free to write, Išd love to hear it. . .
