It's a western, an action movie and a comedy all rolled up into one.
But it's  also a Jackie Chan movie so that automatically makes it a lot more likable to begin with.
The story is simple, Chan stars as a Chinese imperial guard who must travel  to Carson City, Nevada in the late 1800s to rescue a princess who thought she was going there to start a  new life but actually walked right into a kidnapper's trap.
Owen Wilson costars as Roy O'Bannon, a train robber who I think is Han Solo  in a former life.
When the two find themselves as a team a lot of hilarity and action ensues.
Wilson is  really charming as the supposed bad boy and so is Chan as the ignorant immigrant.
The story is really all over the map but it's forgivable because the two men  are so fun to watch and the action sequences are so exciting.
This is how action movies are supposed to  work.
