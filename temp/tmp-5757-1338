City Of Angels has a few problems that left me feeling very mad.
I was mad because the rest of the film is very well done, and well acted.
The story is light, and so well told thgat you almost forgive these errors.
I didn't.
The story has Nic Cage, an angel, falling in love with Meg Ryan, a doctor, and when he appears to her she falls for him.
Along the way Cage meets a guy named Mesenger, played by NYPD's Dennis Franz, who tells him that he can fall to earth and become human.
Will he give up his wings?
The story also has a complication in Ryans boyfriend, who seems to show up to create a conflict than disappear.
This is what I couldn't forgive in City Of Angels, the big, fatal plot manipulation.
It left m dangling to upset by its disregard for us to finish its stream of thought.
It seems to end in midstream, with little complication and lots of glowing acting.. .
