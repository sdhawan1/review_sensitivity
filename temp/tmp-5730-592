Life is Beautiful (La Vita e Bella) is an example of a good movie that  people have decided to make great.
Do not be mistaken, it is not the  best foreign fare of 1998, nor even close to the finest (my personal  favorite being the Iranian Taste of Cherry).
But the movie is a solid  work and wholesome reminder of the Holocaust.
The film follows a father  and son through a concentration camp, and shows the father's attempts to  ease the son's pain by convincing him it is all an elaborate game.
Roberto Benigni won best actor for this production, just one of many  undeserved awards that the movie garnered.
Yet, the work is still leaps  and bounds superior to the recent Jakob the Liar and the best Italian  film to make it across the Atlantic since the 1994 romantic masterpiece,  Il Postino.. .
