 Seen within a few minutes of one another last week in London: a series  of advertisements for computers running the Windows NT system, with the  slogan 'The Full MoNTy', and a headline in a tabloid newspaper crying  'Give us the Full Monty, Gordon'.
It's a measure of the film's success that the description 'the full  Monty', until now more often associated with the English cooked  breakfast, has become so widely used in recent weeks.
And, given that  the film is about male strippers, the mind boggles at that tabloid  headline, which was actually about Britain's reluctance to commit to a  fiscal union with the rest of Europe.
The plot of the film is very simple - a group of redundant Sheffield  steelworkers are looking for alternative ways to earn their keep and,  in desperation, come up with the idea of mounting a strip show.
But  the effect is in the execution, and in the acting; there are such  wonderful moments as when a redundant foreman, played by Tom Wilkinson,  has a visit from the bailiffs, or when the slightly tubby steelworker  played by Mark Addy attempts a very novel approach to losing weight.
Starting with an archive film from the 1970s, about Sheffield's then  thriving industry, 'The Full Monty' actually tells us a great deal  about the collapse of a society based on heavy industry.
Light-hearted  as it is, it addresses a very important question: when the traditional  sources of livelihood in places like Sheffield disappear, what needs to  replace them?
It's good fun, and good-natured fun as well because the characters are  invariably both fallible and likeable.
Despite being set among such  economic desolation, a genuine feel-good film.. .
