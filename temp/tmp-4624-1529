If Special Effects were the principal parts of a movie, then Lost In Space would rank as one of the best this year.
But even with all the other elements added Lost In Space is still a entertaining film, even if it runs a little long.
In the future the world is dying, and there is only one hope, colonize another planet.
John Robinson(William Hurt) is in charge of building a hyperspace tunnel to connect the colonized planet to earth.
His only demand upon accepting the mission is that his family may accompany him to the planet, they include: Maureen(Mimi Rogers), Penny(Lacey Chabert), Judy(Heather Graham), and Will(Jack Johnson).
Also on the trip is the pilot, Don West(Matt LeBlanc), who is none to happy to be there at the beginning and the evil Dr. Smith(Gary Oldman).
During the trip they run into lots and lots of obstacles, one after another.
The plot is a little weak, and the ending is a perfect setup for a sequel, so don't expect closure.
The acting is surprising good with the exception of the constantly irritating Lacey Chabert.
Gary Oldman is rehashing his performance from The Fifth Element, but its done perfectly- So why complain?
Matt LeBlanc is surprisingly likable as Major West, maybe he will be able to get work after Friends is over.
The Special Effects are great, but the bugs have been done before and it has a Starship Troopers feel.
There is a cute little monkey creature made by Jim Henson's Creature Shop, although it looks like its been painted on the film, it is still a nicely rendered image.
All things considering its entertaining and fun.
Check it out if your a special effects or sci-fi fan.. .
