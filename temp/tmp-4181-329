I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (R) * 1/2 Starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, Brandy Norwood Directed by Danny Cannon A Review by Frankie Paiva. Obviously, the hook-handed Ben Willis is at it again, this time it's on an island in the Bahamas where the lush surroundings are just bound to turn deadly.
In the middle of summertime, Julie James (Hewitt) and her friend Karla (Norwood) are called up by the local radio station.
They have to guess the capital of Brazil to go on their dream vacation, scrambling around the kitchen, they find a bag of coffee that says it was produced in Rio.
They guess that, and their vacation begins.
Karla brings along Tyrell (Mekhi Phifer) and reluctant Julie is forced into bringing Will (Matthew Settle) because her old boyfriend Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.) has to work.
Apparently Julie still can't get over the fact that they cut off Ben Willis's hand and threw him into the water to drown in the last movie but, "they never found the body!
" Oh my!
What shocking horror!
The capital of Brazil isn't Rio, it's Brazilia, Ben has set them up.
He's once again on a vengance gig, back for more action this time killing everyone in sight.
I mean, come on, does the housekeeper or the bartender have any idea what Julie did last summer?
And what happened to all the people that were on the island?
This film is greatly lacking Kevin Williamson, who brought spark and witty dialouge to the original.
Sarah Michelle Gellar is also not here, couldn't she have been resurrected from the dead in a demonic ritual or something?
This film is so predictable, and it even surpasses the number of cliches that Scream mentions and features.
I don't care how little Hewitt has on for most of the film, so I give it * 1/2 stars.. .
