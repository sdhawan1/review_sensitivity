Blast From the Past is the type of totally innocuous film where the  viewer is neither better nor worse for having watched.
The movie is about a family that locks itself in a fallout shelter in 1962, fearing  that the Cuban Missile Crisis will lead to nuclear holocaust.
35 years later, the doors unlock and out comes the son that was born underground.
His experiences of Los Angeles are equally humorous and telling of the  times.
Don't worry if you miss this one; I doubt anyone other than the  guy who programs the HBO marathons will remember it in a few years.. .
