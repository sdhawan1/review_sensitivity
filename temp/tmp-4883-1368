Cast Arnold Schwarzenegger, Geroge Clooney, Chris O'Donnell, Uma Thurman, Alicia Silverstone, Elle McPhearson, Michael Gough, Pat Hingle Directed by:  Joel Schulmaker. I don't even know where to start.
It's this simple:  BATMAN AND ROBIN is the worst movie I have ever seen in the theatre.
Now I have seen some bad ones.
CONGO, LAST ACTION HERO, THE BABYSITTER.
But this movie sucks!!!!!!
I think Ed Wood is spinning in his grave.
I refuse to see another Joel Schulmaker film again.
Why the hell did they make this movie anyway?
George Clooney as Batman?
He sucked!!
Arnold Schwarzengger, in the worst perrormance of his life as Mr.
Freeze who wants to freeze all of Gotham because his wife is dying.
Oh boo-hoo.
Who the hell cares.
Chris O'Donnell in a robin suit with nipples.
AHHH!!!!
Someone save me.
Alicia Silverstone as the renegade chick with attitude who forms yet another partnership in the batcave.
Give me a break.
Where are the nipples on that costume hmmm?
Uma Thurman as Poision Ivy?
Ohhhh, suductive.
Yuck.
what an awful movie.
Throw in faithful butler Alfred dying and giving stupid quotes to say along with Elle McPhearson trying to act as Bruce Wayne's girlfirend and you have Joel Schulmaker's worst flop ever.
I mean, the guy can direct some good stuff such as A TIME TO KILL, but this movie is just plain stupid.
Also, I have never see nso much purple in my life!!!!
This is the first movie I am giving a 0. mmensely by teenagers.
I recommend the show to you and give it ***.
Oh yea, YES there is going to be a 5th film of batman.
Rumor has it to feature the Scarecrow and a female joker of some sort.
Yawn!!
I can't wait for the Winnie the Pooh film at this rate.. .
