Written by: David Self, based on the classic Shirley Jackson novel. Starring: Lili Taylor, Liam Neeson, Zeta-Jones, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Owen Wilson. Synopsis:  Three people sign up to participate in an insomnia study for 900 bucks a month: Eleanor (Lili Taylor), Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones), and Luke (Owen Wilson).
Little do they know, their kindly host Dr.
Marrow (Liam Neeson) isn't doing an insomnia study; he's doing a secret study on fear.
Soon enough the three subjects find themselves padlocked in a creepy old mansion once owned by a demented industrial tycoon.
Opinion: The movie takes a while to get started.
Nothing really exciting happens in the first half.
In the second half, the special effects take over, with the haunted mansion doing a lot of morphing.
These are great effects, but they can't make up for plot holes you can drive a truck through.
Like, how come everyone keeps falling asleep if they're supposed to be insomniacs, and they're in the scariest place on earth?
Accompanying a suicidal friend, what normal person would leave the hysterical friend in a dark, closed, frightening, haunted room in order to get a cup of tea?
Also shouldn't they give Eleanor's great grandmother a name?
Great effects, but what about the story?
