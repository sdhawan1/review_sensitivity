_The Thin Red Line_ is a war film, based on the series of events that led to the takeover of the island of Guadecanal.
It has an all-star cast, an epic running time, many intermingling stories, and stunning cinematography.
The film+s strengths are that it is stunningly beautiful, and that it is deeply philosophical.
It+s weakness is an incoherence that starts slow, and builds throughout the film.
If I have been slow in reviewing this film, here+s why:  For the longest time I+ve waited for it to hit my area.
Now that I+ve seen it, my only desire is to see it again.
Usually, that would be a blurb of great praise.
Not here.
I would want to see it again so that maybe then, I would "get it.
"  It seems to be very poetic, very visual, very philosophical, deeply complicated, and too abstract.
But it+s not fair for me to criticize the film for going over my head at points.
It+s not fair for me to complain that I could not keep up with the rhythm of Terence Malick+s direction.
He may have made it a little harder to follow, a little less dumbed down, but I wasn+t bored.
(Okay, I was bored a little towards the very end).
The film isn+t overtly graphic like _Saving Private Ryan_, but there are some strong violent moments.
It+s more concerned with the deeper, underlying issues of man versus nature.
Of man in a tribal state, being more peaceful than the "civilized" counterpart.
There+s one phenomenal image where a tribesman walks through the bushes, totally oblivious to the infantry walking towards him.
There are many of these phenomenal images.
The only thing that is lacking is the glue of a concrete story.
But it+s not that the story doesn+t exist.
The story takes on many forms, affects many characters, and doesn+t assume that we need to have it all explained for us.
It+s not conventional, it+s not Hollywood, and it+s not dull.
I could only hope that repeated viewings will improve my moviegoing experience.. .
