Copyright 1998 Nathaniel R. Atcheson.         John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton are in top comedic form in Pushing Tin, a strange little movie about air traffic controllers.
Directed by Mike Newell (Donnie Brasco, Enchanted April), the film is hilarious and entertaining for the first hour and a half, but slumps into senselessness for its conclusion.
The characters are well-drawn and perfectly acted by the cast, and the movie works when it focuses on the rivalry between the two stars.
But it could have been a great movie if it had found the right way to end (which would have included no baptism scenes in a Colorado mountain stream).
It also doesn't have a lot to do with air traffic controlling -- we get the feeling this story could have been about stock brokers on Wall Street.
Nonetheless, Pushing Tin has more charms than annoyances, and is therefore worth a look.. .
