THE MATRIX is possibly one of the most imaginative Hollywood film of this decade.
This kung-fu laced sci-fi fantasy has the enough action to drive any action fan crazy (even put to shame many kung-fu based movies from Hong Kong) and one of the most imaginative yet surprisingly believable plot ever conceived for commercial film.
This review contain spoilers that may ruin your enjoyment of the film by knowing too much but this is one film which is so hard to review without giving away too much.

I guess by now, word-of-mouth would generated on this movie would have seep through the crevices of every movie-goer in this world.
So does it matter really?
Oh well.
The story brings us the revelations concerning `The One' Thomas Anderson (Reeves), a computer-geek who when not working in his white-collar computing job in a big firm, he will be spending time at home, in front of his computer, grabbing `contraband' information from the net for sale.
Call it a bit of `side-income' but Thomas is indeed onto something when he is mysteriously led to the man he has been seeking for so long; the elusive yet almost godly Morpheus.
Thomas's obsession is fueled by his curiosity on THE MATRIX and it this inner obsession that inadvertently led him, almost by fate to Morpheus, the guru on the subject.. .
