Written by: Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson. Starring: Jason Schwartzman, Olivia Williams, and Bill Murray. Synopsis: Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) loves writing plays.
He is a 15-year-old boy attending a prep school called Rushmore Academy.
Manipulative, Max claims his barber father is a neurosurgeon, and boasts to other students about a (fictitious) sexual episode concerning his friend, a pleasant schoolteacher named Mrs. Cross (Olivia Williams).
Soon Max becomes romantically obsessed with Mrs. Cross, to the point where his antics get him expelled from school.
The depressed teen he realizes he must act within normal bounds to be socially acceptable.
Opinion: I was hoping for an offbeat and lighthearted Bill Murray comedy, but was surprised instead to find a quirky flick about an angst-ridden teenage playwright.
No problem.
RUSHMORE starts out with one or two main oddball characters, and that's a plus.
The acting is solid, and you are immediately pulled in to try to find out what makes the characters tick.
But aside from some flash moments of humor, that's as far and as fresh as RUSHMORE gets.
When the novelty wears off, the rest of RUSHMORE doesn't seem to be propelled by any kind of dramatic event or realization other than that time soothes anguish but not insecurity.
