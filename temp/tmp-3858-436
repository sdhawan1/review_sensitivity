       Imagine, if you like, that SE7EN's Detective Somerset (Morgan        Freeman) has come out of retirement.
He's been drawn back        into the homicide department by the disappearance of his        beloved niece.
The investigation draws him out of the        previous film's nameless city to the relative serenity of        North Carolina's Research Triangle, where he finds that his        niece's case fits into a pattern of abductions of beautiful        young women.
Three of them have been found dead -- molested        horribly and left in the woods to be eaten by animals -- but        Somerset guesses that the others are being held captive by a        "collector" of some sort.
Set on stopping this guy, who has        taken the vile nom-de-crime of "Casanova," Somerset puts his        considerable compassion and wisdom to work at cracking the        case.
I guess you could call this fictional movie EIG8T.
But in a nutshell, that's pretty close to what's going on in        KISS THE GIRLS.
Instead of Somerset, we have Washington,        D.C.-based forensic psychologist Alex Cross, the protagonist        from a series of crime novels by bestselling author James        Patterson.
Since he's also given flesh-and-blood presence by        the formidable Freeman, the film already has echoes of SE7EN,        which can't hurt since the latter film was a surprise smash        hit.
Even taken on its own, it's hardly a bad idea for a        movie.
Patterson's novel earned wide praise from fans of the        genre, who praised the novel's characterization and were        impressed by the story's twists and turns.
The movie, I'm        afraid, is another story.
Fortunately, Klass and director Gary Fleder (the forgettable        THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD) are blessed with        fine performances by Freeman and Ashley Judd, two actors who,        I suspect, were more or less put on autopilot for this one.
Freeman turns in an expert, off-hand performance that recalls        the serene wisdom of Somerset.
(Freeman's a good enough actor        that he really doesn't need the early scene where he talks        the gun out of a suicidal woman's mouth just to demonstrate        his character's sensitivity and compassion.
) Much as I enjoy        that character, I'd like to see Freeman stretch out a little,        and here's hoping that I'll get my wish in the next few        months, when he stars in Steven Spielberg's AMISTAD and the        not-a-disaster-movie-*really* HARD RAIN.
As a thriller, KISS THE GIRLS is by the numbers.
We've got        the fish-out-of-water-with-a-badge, a cop who's gone outside        his jurisdiction because he has a personal stake in the        investigation.
We've got the killer's hidden lair, which the        cops must discover in a race against time to save his next        victim.
And while the scenes (two of them!
) where Kate kicks        righteous ass without the help of a male rescuer are        tremendous crowd-pleasers, they're staged without much        ingenuity.
Judd plays Kate strong and smart, but I would have        liked to have seen more emphasis on the smart.
The so-so        cinematography and catch-as-catch-can editing technique are        augmented by a distracting sound mix that, if you see the        movie in digital sound, has those already cliched wooshing        noises careering through the movie theater in an attempt to        whip up a sense of unease.
We've also got the obligatory yucky relationship between        Casanova and his pretty female victims.
Their trauma is only        hinted at -- I think a better (and probably darker) movie        might have given us a longer look inside that makeshift        prison block, and would have forced us to care about the fate        of those women.
(I'm told that the novel included a subplot        allowing Kate a relationship with one of Casanova's other        victims that's missing here.
) Instead, the movie barely        acknowledges their pain, and seems only fleetingly concerned        with fleshing out the character of Casanova (the most        unsettling insight coes from a scene where we find out that        he's an Internet geek, swapping photos of his victims by        email).
I wanted to loathe him, but found myself not moved        much by anything he did.
Perhaps ironically, the unconvincing        treatment of the villain and his deeds makes the movie's        queasiest touches -- a post-mortem photo of one of the        victims, badly battered, or the attempted rape scene in the        final reel -- seem uncomfortably gratuitous, or even        titillating.
For a picture that deals with a sexual        psychopath who I'd imagine makes Hannibal Lecter look like a        gentleman, KISS THE GIRLS plays as pretty light        entertainment.
