Well...I must admit this movie definately lived up to my expectations, but in a deferent way that I had hoped...
The movie begins with Kirk Russel and his wife Katholan Quinlan as "rich" Bostonites trying to make a fresh start in California.
Mysteriously, theit car breaks down and they are left at the side of the road.
A man it an 18-wheeler comes by and offeres a ride into town.
Kirk is skeptical but lets his wife go while he stays behind.
Eventually he fiqures out what was wrong and goes about finding his wife.
Hmm...this is where the action stops and it's my duty to stop telling you plot details....
This movie (as I said) did live up to my expectations.
It showed the length that a man would go to save his wife.
But so much of the movie involves him getting revenge that I think the movie loses a little focus.
Thats not that big of a deal.
I just think that if not for that the movie could have been better (although at already was great)..
