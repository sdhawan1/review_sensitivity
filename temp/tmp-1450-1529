Welcome to 1950s Los Angeles, city of greed, corruption, money, and power, just of few of it's qualities.
L.A.
CONFIDENTIAL displays all of these characteristics in under two and a half hours, an incredible achievement.
The story revolves around three cops, Jack Vincennes(Kevin Spacey), Bud White(Russell Crowe)and Ed Exley(Guy Pearce).
These three are out to find out the truth concerning a slaughter at a local coffee shop the Night Owl.
During their investigation they find out that the motive is far more involved than simply robbery.
During their investigation Bud gets involved with a prostitute, Lynn Bracken(Kim Basinger), who looks like a famous actress.
Jack is also getting payoffs from  Sid Hudgeons'(Danny DeVito) tabloid magazine all the while investigating the murders.
This movie has a lot good about it, in fact its relatively perfect.
Director Curtis Hanson(The Hand That Rocks the Cradle) does a superb job of pulling everyone in the crew's talent together in a movie that is very fluid and highly entertaining.
The acting is flawless, Kevin Spacey and Kim Basinger deserve Oscars for their standout performances.
Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe, Danny DeVito and James Cromwell deliver outstanding performances as well.
The cinematography(Dante Spinotti), music(Jerry Goldsmith), costumes(Ruth Myers) and editing(Peter Honess) are noteworthy and add to the film's excellence.
Lastly the script(Brian Helgeland & Curtis Hanson, based on the book by James Ellroy) is taut and full of delicious plot twist that keep you on the edge of your seat in anticipation.
This movie is an American Film-Noir masterpiece, and one of my personal favorites of 1997.  . .
