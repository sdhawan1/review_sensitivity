"Traffic" accomplishes a rare feat indeed.
A movie about one of the most  prevalent issues confronting modern society -- the drug trade -- it  nonetheless manages to rise above simple proselytising and offers a  brutally uncompromising, essentially unbiased perspective on its subject  material.
In a world where even the best dramas tend to take sides, this  is remarkable; even more noteworthy is the fact that it happens within the  confines of one of the most gripping films of the year.
Directed by Steven Soderbergh, and vastly superior to his crowd-pleasing  but underachieving "Erin Brockovich", "Traffic" tells three stories about  lives affected by drugs.
These are tangentially connected, but mostly  stand up on their own -- it would not be difficult to remove any of the  plotlines from the movie and view those segments in isolation.
In one story arc, Michael Douglas plays Robert Wakefield, an Ohio judge  who has been named by the President to be the nation's new drug czar --  the nominal head of America's war on illegal substances.
But unbeknownst  to Wakefield or his wife Barbara (Amy Irving), their own daughter Caroline  (Erika Christensen) has been lured into the drug culture.
Meanwhile, Douglas' real-life bride Catherine Zeta-Jones stars as Helena  Ayala, whose husband Carlos (Steven Bauer) is secretly one of the  country's top importers of narcotics.
This is revealed to Helena only when  Carlos is arrested by Agents Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Castro (Luis Guzman)  following the apprehension of a lower-level dealer (Miguel Ferrer).
Helena  is soon embroiled in Carlos' world when the cartel he worked with  threatens their son's life to keep Carlos from betraying them to the  authorities.
The only help Helena can turn to seems scarcely preferable --  including Carlos' perfidious business partner (Dennis Quaid) and a cunning  cartel head (Benjamin Bratt).
Finally, there is the tale of Mexican policeman Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez  (Benicio Del Toro), who fights against drug trafficking from his side of  the border.
Javier becomes caught in a war between two cartels (one of  them Bratt's) and discovers that neither his partner (Jacob Vargas) nor  the army general who professes to Mexico's biggest anti-drug crusader  (Tomas Milian) are as dedicated to the task as they would have him  believe.
Soderbergh's direction stands out in "Traffic".
He employs a rigid,  realistic style which thrusts the audience directly into the drama.
Events  unfold at a sometimes feverish pace, but Soderbergh keeps things lucid,  often helped by focussing on a handful of very strong characters.
He also  distinguishes each of the three plotlines by filming each of them (or  rather, each of their principle locations) in a different style.
The  Washington and Ohio locales of the Wakefield storyline look cold and blue,  reflecting both the bureaucratic nature of the judge's new environment and  the downward spiral which has gripped his family.
The Mexico scenes, on  the other hand, look hazy and washed out, as though the sunlight is raining down on the desert and barrios.
And the California locations for  the Ayala segments are more lushly, naturally lit.
Each of the storylines boasts a number of fine performances.
Douglas is on  the mark as a man who is expected to serve a nation, but who finds he  cannot even help his own flesh and blood.
His desperation, as the  pressures of his job conflict with his desire to heal his family, is  effectively conveyed.
Del Toro, meanwhile, is excellent as a little fish  in the big and tumultuous pond that is Mexico, unable to completely trust  anyone and often finding himself on the side of those whose actions seem  no better than the criminals'.
Zeta Jones is less successful as Helena, her character lacking consistency  from scene to scene.
To an extent, this is because the entire California  subplot feels a little rushed.
Unlike the other two storylines, which  chiefly concentrate on just one character (Judge Wakefield and Javier  Rodriguez, respectively), Helena competes for attention with other  individuals, most notably the entertaining double act of Gordon and  Castro.
Indeed, Cheadle brings such intensity to his role that it seems a  shame he does not feature more prominently in the film.
There is a lot  happening in the Ayala segments -- legal maneuvering, financial  maneuvering, Helena's efforts to deal with Carlos' cohorts, the agents' investigation -- and at times it feels rushed and jumbled.
The same cannot be said of the superb Mexico scenes, which offer a  blistering look at the blurred line between those who run the country and  those who run the drugs.
Here we see how easy it can be for a lawman to  abandon his duty and turn the other cheek -- not only because it can be  tantalisingly lucrative to do so, but because the deck already seems so  overwhelmingly stacked against him.
The story of the Wakefield family is probably the most familiar and  accessible to mainstream audiences, and the tale of a girl hooked on drugs  and unwilling to commit herself to rehab is nothing new.
But "Traffic"  depicts this subplot with such stark honesty that it is far more effective  than most treatments of the material.
What happens to Caroline is horrible  and sobering.
The explanation offered by her boyfriend (Topher Grace, from  "That '70s Show") for the stranglehold drugs have on the population is  equally so.
"Traffic" reaches no conclusions, favours no sides.
Some aspects of the  film support the controversial notion of legalising narcotics, and suggest  that the drug war is futile and doomed to failure.
Others offer a spark of  hope that, slowly but surely, America is winning this most insidious of  battles.
In the end, it is not clear that current policy is at all  effective, but nor is it indisputably misguided -- the possibility for  both exists.
What "Traffic" does accomplish is simply to raise the level of awareness  of just how complex an issue this really is.
Politicians and activists who  attempt to dismiss or address the problem with glib words and handy  catchphrases are neither helping nor, increasingly, fooling anybody.
