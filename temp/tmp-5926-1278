" Southpark: Bigger, Longer, Uncut "  * * *.     Before it runs out of steam toward the end, SOUTHPARK (which incidentally was cut to secure an R-rating) is the funniest film of the year.
By default; there havenšt been many comedies, and certainly none this unabashedly obscene.
And, right from the start, you know youšre in the hands of a couple filmmakers with a keen sense of humor, as Kyle, Stan, Cartman and Kenny head off to "a foreign film from Canada", via an hilarious Disney rip-off show tune called "Mountain Town".
Iconoclasm in place; politics are next.
The kids canšt get into the new Terrance and Phillip film, because it is R-rated (for good reason) and theyšre underage.
Tip, if you find yourself in a similar predicament:  bribe the local bum, and no movie or ratings restriction is unbeatable.
Good thing they get in, too, as the incessantly profane five minutes we see next are a riot, full of as many fart noises and Fš words as Išve seen in that short a time.
Then comes the hook:  Comedy Central canšt run "Southpark" in all its glory.
So, once the boys leave their three-hour marathon of more bad language than they know what to do with, BIGGER, LONGER, is caution-to-the-wind cursing.
Not more than a lot of other R-rated films from, say, Martin Scorcese ­ like most people seem to be obsessing about ­ mind you.
But, still; the creativity with which these small fries spout about is, ah, a might off-setting.
Which takes only a few minutes to desensitize us to what wešre hearing; I mean, really, you hear ten mutterings of "pig-fucker" or "shit-smeller" (I may be a little inaccurate with those examples, but you get it), and youšve heard a lifetime.
So, just being crude wouldnšt be enough.
No, series creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone are not ones to rest on their considerable laurels, and thus, this SOUTHPARK feature goes a step or two further with a clever storyline:  the parents of our four young anti-heroes are shocked by their newfound vocabulary.
A scapegoat is needed, but whom.
Canadians, of course.
War is declared, Terrance and Phillip are taken hostage and their public execution planned out, and Cartman ­ following his humorous ditty, "Kylešs Momšs a Bitch", sung by members of several different nationalities ­ gets a chip put in his head that prevents further use of foul language through shock treatment.
In the meantime, Kenny suffers his usual death, goes to hell, where Satan and Sadam Hussein are lovers, and Satan is a big softie and wants to be able to communicate with his partner instead of just having sex all the time.
But, nevermind.
SOUTHPARK is entertaining, on top of being sleazy, and that is to be commended.
Because it didnšt have to be as good as it is, and who knew.
There are a few scratch that, way too many songs (some funny, some blah), and thatšs why I say the film wears out its welcome.
Before that happens, though, chances are you wonšt laugh more during any other movie this summer than you will, here.
Highlights:  Winona Ryderšs performance with a ping-pong ball; the untimely murder of Bill Gates; that "Uncle Fucker" song from ASSES OF FIRE (oh.. my.. god); Cartmanšs improvisational use of his neural implant, to save the day.
And, needless to say, getting to see the true face of Kenny; canšt beat that.      . .
