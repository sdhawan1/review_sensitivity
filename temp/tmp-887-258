Written by Lord, Park, & Karey Kirkpatrick.      Just when it was starting to look like comedy was plucked, along  comes the funniest movie of the year to put it back on its perch.
This  will come as no surprise to fans of Nick Park and Peter Lord, the  geniuses behind the Oscar-winning Wallace and Gromit shorts.
Park and Lord work in claymation, a process so slow and painstaking  you can't imagine how they can find anything funny.
But oh, do they!
In their first feature-length film, produced through Dreamworks, they've  created a hilarious spoof on WWII POW movies like The Great Escape.
But  you don't have to know the sources - Chicken Run is funny and endearing  and completely entertaining in its own right.
The action takes place on the chicken farm of Mr. And Mrs. Tweedy  (Tony Haygarth and Miranda Richardson), a grim stalag of barracks where  chickens must produce or perish.
Some of them take it lying down, but  not Ginger (Julia Sawalha of TV's AbFab), a plucky little hen with  escape in her blood.
"So, laying eggs all your life and then getting  stuffed and roasted, that's good enough for you, is it?
" she demands, to  which another chicken (Jane Horrocks of Little Voice) replies "It's a  living.
".      When the Tweedys install a chicken pot pie machine, things get  desperate - when out of the sky comes what looks like the answer to  Ginger's prayers: Rocky the Flying Rooster (Mel Gibson), a refugee from  a circus who calls himself "The Lone Free Ranger.
"  She offers to hide  him if he'll teach them all how to fly.
What makes Lord and Park's work so great is a deeply wonderful  sense of humor, both verbal and visual.
It's in the timing, in the  characters, in the lines, in the lighting and the camera angles and the  sets and the music (including the R&B classic "Flip, Flop and Fly".
)  In  a world of computerized high-tech, this is basic, and brilliant.. .
