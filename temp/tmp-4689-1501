Cast: Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Claire Forlani, Jeffrey Tambor Director: Martin Brest Screenplay: Ron Osborn & Jeff Reno and Kevin Wade and Bo Goldman 179 minutes Rated PG-13. In case you didn't know by now, "Meet Joe Black" is a remake (rip off) of the the 1934 film "Death Takes A Holiday.
" There are a couple of differences between the two.
One, which is mentioned by most critics and people, is that "Meet Joe Black" is unduly extended at 2 hours and 59 min.
With their 3 hours of film, I got to listen and watch insipid, prosaic dialogue and situations involving lamb sandwiches, peanut butter, and party arrangements.
I got to hear banal one-liners come out of the characters that seemed to be from the last Pauly Shore movie's cutting floor.
The other thing "Black" had that wasn't used to its advantage was a $95 million budget that was wasted on... Hell, I don't think anyone knows.
Maybe it was on the 8 writers who gave this film six sub-plots.
Maybe it was on the CGI of all the actors and actresses besides Anthony Hopkins in the film (There's no way real people are that cardboard).
Don't interpret this as me saying this film has no saving graces.
Anthony Hopkins gives a respectable performance here, and as always, Martin Brest directs a few good scenes in `Meet Joe Black.
'  However, the only real thing that could've saved this movie is spending more time in the editing room.
Avoid this and go see the 1934 original that's much better than what I saw.. .
