I hate films in which the good guys don't ask for help of others (FBI) because the killer needs to get away to preserve the standard film running time!
That is one thing that made KISS THE GIRLS such a mixed experience, how can a film be so stupid and smart at the same time?
Morgan Freeman is chasing a serial killer that seems to be collecting girls.
Ashley Judd is the average kick boxing doctor who escapes from Casanova's (killer's name) pad, an advanced labyrinth of mazes and doors.
Her escape is one of the most exciting scenes in the film because she is drugged and being chased and unable to dodge every tree.
By the end of the chase she looks like Sly at the end of a Rockey pick and is ready to tell the police everything she knows, but she doesn't know much.
She convinces Freeman to take her with him (!!
) and the film begins to disable.
Too bad.
Individual scenes are so good that they deserve a honest, smarter movie to use them.
And the Acting is first rate, with Judd showing she is one of the freshest and best new actresses around and Freeman is sharp in a role that didn't deserve him.
Gary Fleder, director of this and the under-rated Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead, has style to burn.
Unfortunatly the film does burn.. .
