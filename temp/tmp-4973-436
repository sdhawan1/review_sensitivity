       Filmmaking itself is a bit of a game.
Directors, actors,        screenwriters, and editors play it with their audiences all        the time.
You use diversionary tactics, you pluck at        heartstrings, you appeal to the emotion, the intellect, and        the libido of your audience.
When the movie is complete, the        studio marketing department plays the game, as well.
The        object of the game is to get butts in theater seats.
On a        slightly more high-flown level, the object is to engage,        stimulate, and please your audience to the extent that they        feel gratified by the experience -- and tell their friends        about the little game you're playing so that they can buy        tickets, too.
And the filmmakers find out whether they've won        when the box office receipts start coming in.
David Fincher is hardly the first director to exploit his own        uncanny gamesmanship, but he's done it as compellingly as        anyone since Hitchcock.
Granted, his debut feature, ALIEN3,        took a swan dive at the box office that mirrored the film's        almost ritual sacrifice of an SF cinema icon.
(Fincher says        the film is less than he wanted it to be, and blames studio        interference.
) But who would have thought that SE7EN, an        unremittingly pessimistic serial killer film -- in which the        serial killer plays a self-righteously depraved game with two        big-city detectives and wins -- would score more than $100        million at the domestic box office, with or without Brad Pitt        on board?
As I write, it's hard to tell how solid a commercial hit THE        GAME may or may not be, although the general reaction of the        audience on opening night was one of near-euphoria, with        laughter, gasps, and even screaming throughout and widespread        applause at the ending credits.
In fact, I hardly know where        to start criticizing it, because the pay-off is so terrific.
Even if you guess the film's ultimate resolution -- and I        did, although I kept telling myself that even this screenplay        couldn't possibly resort to such a wildly implausible device        -- the execution and follow-through is dazzling.
Michael Douglas, the quintessential white man in trouble,        plays Nicholas Van Orton, a wealthy, steely, and entirely        troubled gazillionaire.
(You may recognize a little bit of        your boss in him.
) He perches atop a megacorporation        headquartered in San Francisco, and works his employees        ragged -- but not, he believes, unfairly or without good        reason.
He's devoted to the bottom line, and puts a sourly        positive spin on his firing of an underperforming executive        (Armin Mueller-Stahl) -- more time to go sailing, Van Orton        assures him.
He regards his ex-wife (Anna Katerina), who        clearly remains worried about his soul, coldy.
He lives in        the long shadow of his father, who committed suicide by        jumping from the roof of the family home.
He's visited by his estranged brother, Conrad (Sean Penn),        who offers him an unusual birthday present -- a gift        certificate for a personalized "game" orchestrated by a        high-tech company called Consumer Recreation Services, or CRS        for short.
"They make your life fun," he promises.
Resistant        to the idea but intrigued at the same time, Nicholas        eventually finds himself at the CRS offices, submitting to a        battery of psychological tests and a physical exam that will        help the company tailor a game just for him.
Soon, Nicholas        arrives at home to find a clown dummy splayed across his        driveway, just as his father was found.
Nicholas finds a key        in the clown's mouth, and suddenly starts receiving some very        strange television programming.
And so the game is afoot.
The movie seems to take some cues        from John Frankenheimer's sinister SECONDS, but without that        film's chilly sensibility.
The general mood is closer kin to        Martin Scorsese's one-night-in-New-York farce AFTER HOURS,        with more sinister overtones but with the same general        trajectory.
Nicholas bonds with Christine (Deborah Kara        Unger, seen earlier this year in Crash), a        wrong-place-at-the-wrong-time waitress who dumps drinks all        over his expensive suit and then helps him escape after he        finds himself, mysteriously, trespassing at CRS offices after        hours.
Lost credit cards, Swiss bank accounts, a crypt in        Mexico and a first edition of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD will all        figure into the picture as the game plays itself out.
Justly        paranoid, Van Orton's task is to figure out what the hell is        going on, and whether or not he's still just playing.
The screenplay, by the folks who brought you THE NET (with an        apparent polish by SE7EN screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker),        is effective but irritatingly simplistic.
It relies on        cyber-paranoia, the suspicion that anybody with the right        technological tools can manipulate your televisioned,        cell-phoned world to such an extent that you can't tell        what's "real" anymore.
What's more interesting is the        sobering suggestion, left over from SE7EN, that a human life        is really a sort of Rube Goldberg device -- that by setting        up the right combinations of pulleys and levers, you can        manipulate a person into just about anything.
With the exception of a few choice lines that are accented by        Douglas's deliciously dry delivery, the dialogue is mostly        banal -- which makes it more and more difficult to figure out        just what the hell is really happening.
Some skillful        misdirection by Fincher compounds the confusion, and Unger's        smartly reserved performance drives us to second-guess        whether or not she's really involved in what looks more and        more like a truly sinister scheme.
Douglas is fine, exuding        that combination of privilege and haplessness for which he's        so well known.
Penn is only on-screen for a few minutes, but        his performance veers effectively from relative serenity to        hysteria.
From a technical standpoint, the film is expertly gorgeous.
Fincher remains one of the few directors in Hollywood with a        visual style that pushes the bounds of what we think of as        "the movies.
" Van Orton's repeated flashbacks to the life and        death of his father are presented as Super-8 home movies --        efficiently and beautifully, the flashbacks are signalled not        by dissolves or slow pans, but by the abrupt change in the        quality, color, and grain of the film itself.
Fincher retains        an aesthetic fascination with photography, with what it means        to take a picture.
Cinematographer Harris Savides photographs        an incriminating a pile of Polaroids with the same sort of        up-close, shallow-field inserts that made up a good portion        of the chilling opening credits to SE7EN.
Jim Haygood's film        editing is virtuosic and world class, tapping into the rhythm        of the characters and the story instead of relying on        MTV-style hypermontage.
Compared to what's playing elsewhere        in the multiplex, this sort of breathtaking craftsmanship        nearly qualifies as avant garde.
For all that, THE GAME is almost breezily entertaining.
You        can take that as a compliment, but it's also a problem.
For        too long -- about the first three-quarters of the film --        Fincher can't manage to escalate this particular game to the        level of tension or exhilaration achieved by the best        Hollywood movies, say a BREAKDOWN or a FACE/OFF.
Meandering        from situation to situation, the script takes pains to remain        absolutely ambiguous, since the climax will its depend on        being able to jerk our perceptions this way and that.
The end        result of this is that there's no sense of revelation for the        audience, no moment when you feel things click together just        right -- just twist after twist.
Normally, I'm not a fan of        this school of storytelling, which seems sorta lazy to me --        THE USUAL SUSPECTS fell back on a similar one-twist gimmick        in 1995, and Joe Eszterhas has used it repeatedly, to my        great irritation (JAGGED EDGE, BASIC INSTINCT, and SLIVER).
But THE GAME is a little more playful in its convolutions        than those films.. .
