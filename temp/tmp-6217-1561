  In one of the most hyped films of the past decade, Armageddon is a  mega-bust.
A disaster flick that is a disaster on every level.
Not even  Bruce Willis can save this expensive, incoherent, derivative mess.
Following in the superior Deep Impact's heels, Armageddon tells the mudding  tale of an asteroid the size of Texas on a collision course with Earth.
The  film fails to mention how this particular hunk of space rock was detected by  NASA, or even the inept script-hole that shows a U.S. spacecraft being  obliterated in orbit by a comet shower, followed by the destruction of  Manhattan.
Oops.
NASA couldn't see that?
I guess when you are Billy Bob  Thornton (playing a NASA official), you kinda wonder how such a wonderful  actor as yourself is reduced to rubish like Armageddon.
Willis plays Harry Stamper, "the world's best oil driller," who is called  into action (just like it Die Hard, Mercury Rising, Die Hard 2!).
I have no  idea why Harry, and his retarted group of drillers, are called for a job that  if failed, would mean the end of life as we know it.
I guess it would seem  cooler to have a bunch of dudes rescuing us from complete death and  destruction than some smart, well-mannered scientist-cume-Amercian hero.
The DVD of the movie is okay.
It contains a trailer, I believe a  commentary (I was so looking forward to taking this disc out of my machine, I  didn't notice), and some other mumbo jumbo.
The soundtrack is wide and good,  but, like the cast, this disc is just worthless.. .
