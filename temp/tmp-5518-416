Ingredients: Heaven, hell, life after death. Starring: Robin Williams Cuba Gooding Jr., Annabella Sciorra. Synopsis:  During his life, a guy named Christy (Robin Williams) finds his soulmate in a girl named Annie (Annabella Sciorra), marries her, and fathers children.
After death, Christy explores heaven, but finds life empty without his wife and children, so he goes searching for them.
Annie is hardest to find because she's not in heaven.
Opinion: WHAT DREAMS MAY COME is colorful and daring in its vision because it attempts to portray the imaginary universe of life after death, and how the soul of an individual can see beyond the material world and in fact create entire universes.
In its portrayal of heaven, hell, and life after death, WHAT DREAMS MAY COME is a visually exciting and wonderful movie and a successful blend of computer technology with movie-making.
That being said, despite good acting and imaginative concepts of life after death, the plot of WHAT DREAMS MAY COME is entirely staid and predictable, and the ending comes as no surprise to anyone.
The movie's main value lies in its ability to inspire.
