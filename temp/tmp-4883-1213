Starring Arnold Schwarnegger, George Cloony, Chris O'Donnel, Uma Thurman and Alicia Silverstone.
Also starring Michael Gough as Alfred. Here's another summer blockbuster, which, although being a terrible film, is bound to make a lot of money.
However, although there have been many bad reviews about this film, I found it to be quite enjoyable.
Sure, the script is awful, and the one liners cringe worthy, but I found it quite exciting.
The action scenes are directed well by Joel Schumacher, who seems quite content at pointing the camera at the action, with the odd swooping camera shots.
Clooney does a good Batman (better than Val Kilmer, although he grins way too much) and Gough plays the ill Alfred well.
I was pleased that the story centered more on Alfred, as he seemed to be generally ignored in the last three films, with him just saying 'Good Luck' or helping out a bit.
The film has it's bad points though.
One of the major ones is that the bad guys just aren't evil enough!
They've softened Mr.
Freeze (Arnold) so he dosen't even really seem like a bad guy at the end of the film.
Also, Uma Thurman gives a good performance as Poison Ivy, but again, she's not terrible evil.
Also, the music surrounding her, to tell the audience that she is 'sexy' is not necessary.
The only evil person in the film was Ivy's sidekick, Bane, who was brilliant!
Overall then, although not a brilliantly written and acted film, I found this film enjoyable.. .
