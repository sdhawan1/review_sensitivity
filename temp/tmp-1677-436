       Like his countryman David Cronenberg, Egoyan is one of the        few great directors working today whose films reflect not        only a consistent worldview, but also a numinous mood.
(Also        like Cronenberg, Egoyan has set one of this year's most        memorable scenes inside of an automatic car wash.) Appealing        no more strenuously to the intellect than to our innate sense        for beauty, Egoyan's films look chilly but eventually        surrender warmth.
They alienate, distress and confound us.
What's most miraculous is that they close up the wounds        they've made.
If some folks are won over by his rather transparent        puppetry, it doesn't mean that Stephens is inherently evil.
Clearly, he's a man doing his job, even if his speech seems        far too rehearsed for there to be any sincerity left in his        motives.
And, in a positively Egoyanian turn of events, we've        learned that Stephens is mourning over his own lost child, a        drug-addled girl named Zoe who has grown into        post-adolescence as one of the living dead.
The film opens,        in fact, with an idyllic image of Stephens and his wife        sleeping with their three-year-old daughter between them,        bathed in warm light.
When we see this image for the second        time, it is as the introduction to the second of two        incidents that anchor the film.
The first is the actual        on-screen representation of the school bus accident.
And the        second is Stephens' mindscreen recollection of a terrifying        morning when he found little Zoe swollen from spider bites.
But never mind.
Although THE SWEET HEREAFTER is an even more        complex puzzle than Egoyan's previous EXOTICA, all these        disparate elements reveal themselves in similarly good time        to be an essential part of this multidimensional story.
Egoyan jumps backward and forward in the narrative with a        clever deliberacy that reveals bits and pieces of literal and        metaphorical relationships all in their own time.
It verges        on soap opera: we learn that Wendell's wife Risa is having an        affair with Billy the widower, whose babysitter is an        aspiring rock star who's been lured into an unwholesome        relationship with ... well, again, never mind.
You just have        to see it.
And oh, is it something to see.
Paul Sarossy's camerawork and        Mychael Danna's music both belong on another plane entirely        from this world of ours.
Danna's exotic score, lending a        tranquil quietude to the anxious proceedings, layers aural        texture atop Sarossy's splendid Panavision cinematography        (which will be wrecked, by the way, on videotape, so see this        in a theater if you possibly can).
The performers often        inhabit only the very edge of this widescreen frame, their        individualized reactions highlighted by the often shadowed        spaces that surround them.
The landscape, meanwhile, is        repeatedly expressed as a richly detailed expanse of snowy        ground spread beneath low clouds.
Even with Sarossy on board,        never before has an Egoyan film enjoyed a visual sensibility        quite this keen.
The pretty pictures provide a sweeping panorama for what is,        barring perhaps the very different L.A.
CONFIDENTIAL, the        year's most assured ensemble of performers.
Leading the way        is Holm, whose fine performance elicits, by turns, distaste,        anxiety, and sympathy.
His narration of the incident        involving his daughter and a pocketknife held at the ready        generates more tension than a year's worth of Hollywood        "thrillers.
" Also worthy of special note is the solid Bruce        Greenwood, whom you may or may not recognize from EXOTICA,        flexing his thespian muscle as gas station owner Billy Ansel,        probably the most upstanding of all these characters and        arguably the film's eventual moral center.
And Sarah Polley,        who had a small role as Greenwood's "babysitter" in the        previous film, reprises that role here, and then some.
(Her        deposition in Mitchell's case, it turns out, will be key.
)        Longtime Egoyan collaborator Gabrielle Rose strikes an        authentically daffy note as bus driver Dolores Driscoll, and        Egoyan's wife Arsinee Khanjian (who had a memorable cameo in        IRMA VEP) does her part as one-half of a couple whose        "hippie" sensibilities are tested by the promise of making        somebody pay for the loss of their adopted child.
In the end, THE SWEET HEREAFTER rejects that particular idea        of revenge, positing instead the notion that, shunning        litigation, a community can care for its own (and suggesting        that a lie, if told correctly and to the right people, can be        a much-needed suture on a gaping wound).
If that seems an odd        tack for the impetuously modern Egoyan to take, consider that        his films have often played out as cautionary tales dwelling        on the effects of alienation and separation -- the        substitution of voyeurism for sexuality, and of strained        relations for companionship.
Into this cycle, THE SWEET        HEREAFTER fits neatly.
For all the vigorous gyrations these        characters go through in coming to terms with their loss,        only the stubborn Stephens seems to remain an island, having        run himself dry by the story's end.
