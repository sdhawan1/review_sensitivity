Synopsis: David (Osment), a child-like robot programmed to express love,  is given to a family whose son was placed in suspended animation because  he suffers from an incurable disease.
But when the son unexpectedly  returns, David is no longer needed.
His "mother" (O'Connor) abandons him  rather than let him be destroyed.
Finding friendship with another robot,  Gigolo Joe (Law), David sets off on a quest to find the Blue Fairy, who he  believes will help him regain his mother's love.
Review: How do we define a person?
Where does "artificial" end and  "intelligence" begin?
Is there a difference between someone who loves us,  and something programmed to do so?
These are the questions raised by  "A.I.
", a film directed by Spielberg but so reminiscent of its originator,  Kubrick, that his ghost haunts almost every frame.
"A.I.
" wraps these  conundrums in a quest, but at the end of the quest lie more questions.
The  answers are left to the viewers, who are pulled en route in every  direction.
Is David's longing for his mother proof of his humanity?
Perhaps, but still, David is undeniably not human, as we are periodically  reminded.
Whatever one concludes, "A.I.
" is certainly one of the most  thought-provoking films in recent memory.
It is abetted by spectacular  performances, with Osment proving he is perhaps the best child actor  working today.
David is endearing, but a persistent awkward edge reminds  us of his artificiality.
And Spielberg's visuals are stunning, perfectly  complementing "A.I.
"'s central contradiction.
His humans live in a stark  world of clinical coldness; the robots inhabit a chaotic, colourful  universe.
The humans are passive and remote; the robots cling desperately  to life.
And although "A.I.
" does suffer from an extended coda that never  quite works, it remains a fine tribute to the genius that was Kubrick.
