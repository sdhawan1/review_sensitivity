Although it's another action flick, this film will be looked at more closely than others.
Why?
Because it's the first film from Steven Spielbergs new production company, Dreamworks SKG.
Hopefully, not all their films will be like this one.
A nuclear missile has been 'stolen' by a terrorist group, and it's up to Clooney and Kidman to stop the nutty terroists from setting it off in New York.
It basically involves them running around exotic locations, tracking down the terrorists.
There's some good action sequences in there, but this film is decidely average.
The film is directed OK, and there are a few good scenes (including one with a car hanging over a cliff) But there's nothing startingly orinigal about it.
The plot is hardly orinignal or exciting, which is not a good start for a new studio.
It's also hard to see why this film cost $50 million to produce, as the special effects are nothing special.
The performances are OK, with Clooney giving us the Clooney grin throughout, and Kidman looking lovely, but not being able to work with a strong character.
The bad guy, however, is excellent.
He's not an outright nutter, such as Daefoe in Speed 2, but a normal, calm, and disturbed nutter, who believes what he is doing is right.
He's very good.
The direction (from a director previously from T.V's ER) is fine, and there are some striking scenes (but not much). Dosen't look too good, then, for Dreamworks so far.
What they've delivered is a sub-standard film, which will be forgotten as soon as it's finished it's video release.
It's a shame really, this could of been an potential Raiders of the Lost Ark.
But with a dull plot, standard acting, and average action scenes, and a rather large budget, it's all a bit of a letdown for Spielbergs new studio.
Maybe if he had some creative input into it, it would of been better.
Overall, then, disappointing.. .
