Few movies in recent times have attracted as much interest in  Newfoundland as "The Perfect Storm".
Showings have been selling out  regularly since opening day, attracting not only the core movie-going  teen and young adult populations, but people of all ages.
This comes as  little surprise: for five hundred years, the fate of Newfoundlanders has  been inextricably linked to the sea.
Reports of maritime tragedies are  not infrequent occurrences on local newscasts, and every Newfoundlander  is deeply aware of how a poor fishing season can break individual  fishermen and indeed whole communities.
The subject matter of "The Perfect Storm", then, is near and dear to the  people of this province.
Few films could strike more directly at the  heart of our communal conscience.
Although the Newfoundland economy has  diversified in the past century -- gone are the days when almost everyone  was a fisherman, or at least related to one -- tales of fierce storms on  the Atlantic and loved ones lost in the pursuit of the almighty catch  still ring true to many.
"The Perfect Storm" is like the mother of such stories: the culmination  of all those tales of horror and tragedy, made all the more chilling (and  fascinating) because it is based on real events.
It is a fact that around  Hallowe'en of 1991, three separate weather systems -- Hurricane Grace  coming up out of the Bahamas, a rainstorm crossing westward across the  ocean, and a cold front sweeping down from the Arctic -- collided in the  vicinity of the Grand Banks, the vast fishing grounds off the coast of  Atlantic Canada and New England.
The result was one of the worst storms ever recorded, and the swordboat "Andrea Gail", out of Gloucester, Massachusetts, was caught in the middle of it.
"The Perfect Storm" dramatises these events.
Billy Tyne (George Clooney),  skipper of the "Andrea Gail", is a once-great captain fallen on hard  times.
His catch for the season is down badly from previous years.
Determined to turn things around, Billy and his crew -- Murph (John C  Reilly), Sully (William Fichtner), Bugsy (John Hawkes), Alfred Pierre  (Allen Payne), and rookie Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) -- elect to make one more  trip, all the way out to the bountiful Flemish Cap far to the east.
There, they enjoy a tremendous catch, until their ice machine breaks down.
The crew is by this time aware of the bad weather lying between them and  Gloucester, but not its severity.
Faced with either waiting until the  storm subsides (and letting their catch spoil) or punching through it,  they decide to head home.
But the first hints of the storm knock out the  radio, and so Billy is oblivious to the warnings of a friendly rival  (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), that he is heading right into the  epicentre of a meteorological powderkeg.
"The Perfect Storm" does not get off to a good start.
The first half of  the film moves at a glacial pace, depicting the toll that fishing takes  on the crewmembers' personal lives.
The problem is that none of these  characters are particularly interesting; the acting, while serviceable,  is uniformly unremarkable.
Though a certain amount of character-building  is necessary in order to involve us emotionally in the picture, it is  simply overdone.
Too much time is spent developing these characters (and   not in particularly imaginative ways) than can be justified by the  relatively insignificant and melodramatic payoff at the end.
The movie is just marking time, until the storm hits the "Andrea Gail"  and the action really begins.
We are therefore forced to endure contrived  animosity between Murph and Sully, present for no other reason than to  generate some spark during the early tedium.
It says something that the  most engrossing sequences of the first half have nothing to do with the  "Andrea Gail" at all, but rather with a small luxury yacht, the  "Mistral", sailing for the Bahamas and so caught up in the storm earlier  on.
The rescue of the "Mistral"'s crew by a coast guard helicopter is  genuine edge-of-the-seat material.
Indeed, the entire subplot involving the coast guard unit (which later tracks the "Andrea Gail") generates  many of "The Perfect Storm"'s best and most heartfelt moments.
Once the "Andrea Gail" and the storm do collide, the intensity of the  movie finally picks up, and I cannot deny that I enjoyed these scenes  mightily.
Watching Tyne and his crew struggle against nature was both an  inspiring and heartrending experience: I was already well aware of their  ultimate fate, but I admired their determination to get back to port.
These scenes are also nicely counterpointed by tense, quiet glimpses of  the fishermen's family and friends back in Gloucester, gathered at a  local tavern and waiting desperately for news while the storm rages outside.
Unfortunately, while the action in the second hour is undeniably  riveting, it is marred by poor production values.
The computer-generated  images of the "Andrea Gail" riding the towering waves are certainly  impressive.
But they are also very artificial: the water moves like  textured jelly, and the boat is lit and outlined in a very unrealistic  manner.
Also off-putting are some of the onboard scenes, especially those  set after dark, which are clearly shot in a water tank -- it is hard to  shake the impression that the "ocean" ends about five feet off screen.
Admittedly, the power of the second half of "The Perfect Storm" is almost  enough to make me forget all this.
Almost.
Perhaps if I hadn't been  lulled into such listlessness by the first half, I would have been more  easily drawn into the fiction.
But "The Perfect Storm" is desperately  unbalanced.
The filmmakers should have taken a cue from the title that  the real star is not the fishermen, but the storm itself.
"The Perfect  Storm" is simply a good disaster movie, in the tradition of "Twister".
An  excellent drama could no doubt be made about the trials of Atlantic  fishermen, but "The Perfect Storm" is not that movie.
