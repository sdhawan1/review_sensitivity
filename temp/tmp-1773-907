 `Fallen' is what's known as a supernatural thriller.
That means that the bad  guy is a ghost or a demon or something weird like that.
The question is in  these things, who do you want to win?
The insufferable good guy who is morally  pure or the demon/ghost/devil?
The i.g.g is John Hobbes(Denzel Washington), a heroic cop, who when we meet  him, is at a state prison to witness the execution of Edgar Reese(Elias  Koteas), a serial killer[serial killers are tres chic, you know] who's been  taunting  Hobbs for years.
We soon learn that  Hobbs lives with his extraordinarily wimpy brother Art  (Gabriel Casseus) and Art's son Sam (Michael J. Pagan) and that because of  this his girlfriend had moved out.
Guess who's going to get it...
But this is a supernatural thriller and Reese isn't just Reese.
He's also  Azazel, Satan's left hand man, who can possess innocent people and other  mammals and can move from one to the other by touching them.
A nifty gimmick  that while giving a lot of actors work, begins to grate on one after a while.
This version of `the wave' isn't  quite as fun as those at baseball games  because, unfortunately, most of the film is a sophomoric rehash of every other  supernatural thriller made over the past twenty years.
Most of the cast is okay.
John Goodman, Donald Sutherland and James Gandolfini  are good as Hobbs' fellow clueless colleagues, Embeth Davidtz overacts as the  theologian daughter of a cop Azazel has played around with thirty years before  and who gives some vital clues, and Robert Joy has a good time as Azazel's new  temporary digs.
But the film takes itself too seriously, and the use of narration and the  ending are both cheats.. .
