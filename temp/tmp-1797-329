The Virgin Suicides is a great film because it asks the audience to interpret  character interactions and the overall meaning of the film.
At its closing, I  felt like seeing it again to examine the relationships between everyone more  closely.
One would really have to see this movie again in order to fully take  in its drama and purpose.
This gorgeous, dreamy film is definitely worth a  second viewing.
Mr. Lisbon (James Woods) and Mrs. Lisbon (Kathleen Turner) live in an  alternate universe that isn't quite explainable.
Each of their five  daughters, Cecilia (Hanna R. Hall), Lux (Kirsten Dunst), Bonnie (Chelse  Swain), Mary (A.J.
Cook), and Therese (Leslie Hayman) get kept in the house  under close watch at all times.
They cannot go out with anyone, or  participate in social events outside of school.
This of course drives the  local boys crazy.
They often dream of conquering the unconquerable Lisbon  sisters.
Everything changes when Cecilia, the youngest of the sisters at only  thirteen, attempts suicide.
Her psychiatrist (a short appearance from Danny  Devito) suggests they throw a party, and give her more chances to interact  with males her own age.
The boy's sexuality gets further awakened as they try  to comprehend and become a part of the girlâs world they get introduced to.
As the film continues, the girls begin to decide their fates and the boys  love for them becomes even greater.
There is a reason this movie's title is The Virgin Suicides.
Anyone looking  for even remotely happy or exciting entertainment should look elsewhere.
This  is a very heavy film, but one that doesn't lose interest, and isn't too slow.
The topic of teen suicide gets handled with the greatest of care.
The movie  takes place in the 1970s when teen suicide wasn't as big of an issue as it is  today.
Reactions to the suicides by neighbors, reporters, and teenagers are  an interesting addition that shows speculation on the Lisbon sisters isnât  just a teenage guy thing.
The surprising lack of grief for the lost sister  shows what a different family this is.
âThe girls walked into school like  nothing had happened.â?
says the narrator.
Since the movie gets told almost entirely in flashback by the boys, (the  narrator is Giovanni Ribisi) we get just as confused about what's going on in  the Lisbon household as they were.
The reasons why Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon are so  strict with their children never get fully explained.
Mr. Lisbon frequently  tunes in and out of a conversation, and often rattles on about the great  flying machines, and how they won us the war.
Mrs. Lisbon insists the girls  go to church so that they can absorb the Catholic faith.
Both parents are a  little out of it.
The beauty of the girls and some wonderful shots from  director Sofia Coppola make this a stunning and dreamlike fantasy.
A fantasy  that ends in an inevitable shocking horror.
The acting is superb.
Kirsten Dunst has never been more appealing, and she's  a standout from the other Lisbon girls.
James Woods and Kathleen Turner are  also very good as the two parents.
They perfectly convey their feelings while  still making us wonder what's going on in their heads.
Hopefully this movie  will make parents think about talking and listening to their children more.
Maybe if the parents had listened or done something different, nothing would  have happened.
The awkwardness and confusion felt by the boys is what this movie is all  about.
No matter where they are today, whether it's in drug rehab, still  living in the same town, or thousands of miles away, no boy living at that  time in that place will ever forget the Lisbon sisters.
The thought of  conquering the unconquerable as mentioned earlier still exists in their mind.
The love, mystery, and bewilderment of their universe linger as well.
They  can't forget the sisters, neither can I.. .
