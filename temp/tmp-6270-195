Unlike most movie reviews, I don't like to bog mine down with a summarization of the plot.
Usually when someone reads a movie review, they have a general idea what the movie is about.
Otherwise, they would probably skip by it.
So if you're looking for summaries, I'm not the person to go to.
My reviews are nothing spectacular, just simple, to-the-point opinions.
With that out of the way, let's begin.
I was actually quite amazed at Keanu Reeves sudden signs of life in this movie.
It was the first time I was actually Reeves might actually have a pulse.
To say "This is Reeves at his best!
" sure doesn't mean a lot, but it is true.
But it is quite obvious that when Al Pacino is in a movie, nobody's going to outshine him.
And Pacino was devilishly good in this one.
An Oscar nomination?
If the Academy has any senses, there should be.
The superbly delivered speech by Pacino at the end of the film is absolutely captivating!
Truly one of the best dialogues of the year!
The visuals of the movie were unique, intriguing, and rich!
I didn't want to blink.
This film's climax was superb in all departments: acting, directing, and writing.
The very, VERY end of the film was a little disappointing and hokey.
They wrapped this movie up with all the garnishings, with a pretty little bow on top.
I almost have to wonder if they should've just left out the whole ending, which I won't give away, but it seemed off from the rest of the film, and therefore slighty jarring.
Overall, I was extremely pleased with the movie, and I would definitely recommend it!!
