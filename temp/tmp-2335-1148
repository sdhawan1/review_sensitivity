Grade: B (Somewhat disappointing, but worthwhile for fans of the  franchise and goop in general). Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet Written by Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Starring: Sigourney Weaver, Winona Ryder, Dan Hedaya (Blood Simple),  Michael Wincott (Strange Days), Brad Dourif (Exorcist 3) Year of Release: 199720 Rating: R. Deserves Recognition for: Actress (Weaver), Cinematography (Darius  Khondji)20. Capsule Review: Warrant Officer Ellen Ripley's back from the dead and fighting more of  the most Freudian bugs in the universe in a flick that, while nowhere  near the quality of the installments helmed by Ridley Scott and James  Cameron, is still a pretty fun ride.
By far the shortest film in the  series, this sacrifices some potentially intriguing ideas about genetic  responsibility in favor of sheer balls-to-the-wall speed.
(I became a  little more disappointed with the film thinking about it on the way home  after the rush had worn off.
) Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Delicatessen, The City of Lost Children)  seemed like a good choice for reviving the franchise, but his  ultra-quirky style mingles uneasily with the one-liner intensive script  by Joss Whedon (significantly, the two best sequences - a kickass  underwater chase and an encounter with some eerily resonant failed  experiments - are both virtually dialog free), resulting in a film that  wavers between the moods established by the first two installments, but  never quite finds an distinct identity of its own.
Still, the set design  and lighting (by the great Darius Khondji, who also did Se7en) are  fabulous, Sigourney Weaver scores some subtle variations on her usual  persona, and most importantly, it's a far more entertaining movie than  the misbegotten Alien 3.
Bring on part 5.
