Bob the Happy Bastard's Quickie Review:. Sean Connery is an old thief who steals simply for the love of it; Catherine Zeta-Jones is the insurance agent who wants to bust him wide open during the heist of a much-adored Chinese mask.
However, as the movie unfolds, there's many twists and turns to endure, some of which come across more as puzzling rather than smart.
Still, the movie's got a bit of eclectic zip, thanks mostly to the onscreen performances by the classy Connery and the delectably sexy Zeta-Jones.
Ving Rhames doesn't really do much as a side character, however- it would've been fun to see more of him in the act.
The story has holes, but, for the most part, delivers the goods, and the heist scenes are decent espionage fun.
The movie seems to fall apart in its final few minutes with TOO many twists for its own good, but credit director Jon Amiel for at least giving believability for a run for its money and for choosing, for the most part, two actors just right for the lead roles.. .
