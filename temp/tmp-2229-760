Director: Dennis Dugan Cast: Adam Sandler, Cole Sprouse, Dylan Sprouse, Jon Stewart, Leslie Mann Joey Lauren Adams Screenplay: Steve Franks, Tim Herlihy, Adam Sandler Producers: Sidney Ganis, Jack Giarraputo Runtime:  US Distribution: Columbia Rated PG-13: language, crude humor. Copyright 1999 Nathaniel R. Atcheson.         Adam Sandler isn't known for appearing in deep, thought-provoking films, but he's still a really funny guy.
Most of his movies are successful not because of the film making behind them, but because they let Sandler do what he does best without a stupid plot to drown him out.
Big Daddy is the first film in which the story seems more important than Sandler's comic performance, and it's a miserable failure.
Sandler plays a thirty-something loser who gets attached to an orphaned young boy (played by Cole and Dylan Sprouse).
As one might expect from the synopsis, director Dennis Dugan resorts to the usual bag of manipulative and sentimental sequences, including a repulsive  courtroom battle and a lot of teary scenes in which characters say "good-bye" to one another; in addition, there's a ridiculous amount of disgusting toilet humor (urine and vomit both get more screen time than Sandler himself).
There's a hilarious running joke featuring a female doctor who previously worked at Hooters, and the film features passable performances from Sandler, Joey Lauren Adams (as the love interest), and the two young boys, but the film on the whole is trite and disappointingly unfunny.. .
