Finally: A big, effects-laden summer movie that is actually worth the time and the $7.50 to go see.
"Men In Black" takes precise aim at its target and scores a bullseye.
It almost unfailingly hits the right tone and the right character moments throughout.
Vincent D'Onofrio should get an Oscar nomination.
Tommy Lee Jones plays it straight.
Will Smith isn't annoying.
About the only cast member not used to her potential is Linda Fiorentino.
A quibble.
While certainly no "Chinatown", the script (yes, there actually was one) shows clear evidence of thought on the part of the writers.
In case the writers or producers of the summer's other megaduds are reading, I'll repeat those strange words slowly so they can sound them out: "S-c-r-i-p-t".
"T-h-o-u-g-h-t.". Refreshingly free of forced one-liners, we are instead treated to exchanges with some actual wit.
The production design by Bo Welch ("Batman Returns", "Edward Scissorhands", "Wolf") is deliciously good.
The cinematography by Donald Peterman ("Get Shorty", "Point Break", "Flashdance") under Barry Sonnenfeld's direction is both clear and energetic.
A great part of the fun is that the movie manages to both skewer blockbuster summer movies and be a blockbuster summer movie.
My dad taught me as a kid that the best riders at the rodeo were always the clowns.
You have to be good at something to poke fun of it.
"Men In Black" is a welcome relief for those who thought they'd have to wait for Oscar season before having fun at the movies.. .
