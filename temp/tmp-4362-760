US Distribution: Paramount Rated R: Sex, language, drug use. Copyright 1999 Nathaniel R. Atcheson. It's hard to imagine a better political satire than Election, Alexander Payne's intelligent and genius follow-up to his 1996 film, Citizen Ruth.
True, it's a story about a high school election, starring Reese Witherspoon presidential candidate Tracy Flick, and Matthew Broderick as Mr. McAllister, the teacher who hates her most.
But Election serves not just as an acerbic attack on high school politics, but as an attack on politics in general (now I know what Hillary Clinton was like in high school).
The film features four dead-on performances; Broderick and Witherspoon are both show masterful comic timing, but also give their characters depth.
Chris Klein is wonderful as Paul Metzler, the big, stupid, lovable jock oaf who runs against Tracy; Jessica Campbell is also great as Paul's laconic, lesbian sister.
But what really makes Election such a funny, touching, brilliant blast of a film is Payne's direction:  he observes these people with such immaculate objectivity and seething irony that you can't help but like them all, even with their flaws.
In short, Election is what satire is all about.. .
