Starring: Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore, Christine Taylor, Matthew Glave. Ingredients: 1980s setting, wedding musician, waitress, romance. Synopsis: The story takes place in the 1980s but it could just as easily be any typical Hollywood romantic comedy where boy meets girl, boy loses girl, and they regain each other by the end.
Robbie (Adam Sandler) is a down and out musician who makes his living singing at weddings.
After getting left at the altar at his own wedding, Robbie's luck goes downhill until he falls in love with his friend, a waitress named Julia (Drew Barrymore).
The two were made for each other.
The trouble is, fair Julia is engaged to unfaithful rich jerk Glen.
At the same time, Robbie's scummy old fiancee wants to get back together with him.
Can Robbie and Julia get past all the misunderstandings and find true love with each other before Julia takes that plane to Vegas to marry Glen?
Opinion:  THE WEDDING SINGER is okay for a romantic comedy, with some dumb jokes and some good ones, lots of chuckling at the 1980s decade, a good 'best of the 80s' soundtrack, and a cameo by 80s rocker Billy Idol.
Although it is silly at times, and neither deep nor meaningful THE WEDDING SINGER is big-hearted happy movie that any sucker for romance would love to watch.. .
