Screenplay by David Hayter, based on the Marvel Comics characters.      It's the not-too-distant future, and mutants (the kind with  superpowers) are beginning to make their presence felt in our society.
Society is not pleased - you know how it gets about accepting people who  are different.
As Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison), the leader of the  anti-mutant putsch, thunders in Congress, "Would you want them teaching  your children?
".      The allusion to gay rights is clear, but it's tricky metaphorical  ground.
Kelly is a McCarthyesque bad guy, but when he rants about the  dangers these mutants pose, he's onto something - there are good mutants  and bad mutants, but even the good ones are capable of some pretty  horrendous destruction.
And as for the bad ones, well, you don't want  to know.
Still, this is rousing, crisply done stuff for a summer action  blockbuster.
It boasts a top director (Bryan Singer, The Usual  Suspects), and a fine cast led by intense newcomer Hugh Jackman  (Wolverine, who seems less a mutant than a victim of fiendish science)  along with British veterans Patrick Stewart (Dr. Xavier, leader of the  can't-we-get-along mutants) and Ian McKellan (Magneto, dark prince of  the disaffected branch, who has good reason to distrust the essential  decency of humankind.
)  The Xs, by the way, include women - they're  really X-People.
The movie has style, and emphasizes character as well  as special effects, which makes a nice balance.
Ultimately it turns out  to have nowhere to go, and halfheartedly mutates into the final credits.
But of course it does have someplace to go: a promising future of  mutant sequels. . .
