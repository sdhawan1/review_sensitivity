Well director Mike Nichols(The Birdcage, Regarding Henry) is nothing but a talented director, who never fails to be entertaining, and even inspiring at times.
His latest film, a political satire, about the 1992 Democratic presidential primary is all that and more.
Jack Stanton(John Travolta) is running for president, a big step up from governor of a southern state.
His campaign is being headed by Henry Burton(Adrian Lester), a ambitious young black man who's grandfather was a highly esteemed civil rights leader.
Other members of the group include his political strategist(Billy Bob Thornton), his wife(Emma Thompson), Libby Holden(Kathy Bates), and Daisy(Maura Tierney), together, they form the weirdest group ever to help win a presidential election.
The road to the White House isn't easy though, along the way they battle a sex scandal and several skeletons in Jack Stanton's closet.
This is a fun movie, lighthearted and generally amusing.
Its filled with splendid performances from John Travolta(Oscar Nomination in his future), Billy Bob Thornton(always brilliant), Emma Thompson(great as the power hungry wife), and Kathy Bates(One of the best things about Titanic).
Unfortunately the movie suffers from a few flaws.
The point of view is my main example, Henry's character was bland and his acting certainly lacked passion and was rather somber at times.
The second flaw was the editing, it left little bits and pieces of things(for instance Henry's relationship with his girlfriend) that should have been edited out completely.
Apart from these complaints the movie it worth seeing simply for John Travolta's incredibly brilliant performance as our beloved(or scorned) President Bill Clinton, it is certainly a memorable role.
Not to mention the mostly great supporting cast, its highly entertaining and bitterly funny.. .
