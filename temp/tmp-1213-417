RULES OF ENGAGEMENT [Friedkin] -- Boy, did they screw up reel one!
Really a mess from minute one to forty-five, an introduction as thought provoking as colored toilet paper, the movie takes a sudden turn for interesting once the courtroom battle begins, Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson kick into high gear, and those pathetic Saving Private Ryan-wannabe battle scenes cease fire.
It certainly feels like something downloaded from the creative mind of one Tom Clancy, with A Few Good Men tossed in for good measure.
