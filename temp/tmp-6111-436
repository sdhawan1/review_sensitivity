       One of the most anticipated films of the year (by me, anyway)        turns out to be a big, beautiful dud.
A must-see for sheer        visual splendor, Sleepy Hollow is nonetheless a fundamentally        unsatisfying whodunnit that saddles its towering imagery with        a tortured story that works so hard at misdirection that it        never realizes what it's good at.
Johnny Depp plays Ichabod Crane, who in this version of the        classic tale is a New York policeman sent to the picturesque        village of Sleepy Hollow, two days' journey up the Hudson        River, where a number of locals have been reported beheaded.
Lore has it that a beheaded Hessian horseman who was        notoriously vicious in life has returned from the dead,        galloping through the woods under cover of darkness and        decapitating hapless villagers.
Crane has arrived with every        intention of dispelling this sort of foolish superstition.
By        the time he leaves, he has learned to believe.
It's too bad Burton isn't much of an action director.
Sure,        he's big on spectacle, but when it comes time to choreograph        a big showpiece fistfight or chase scene for the camera, he        can't quite invest it with the requisite sense of        physicality.
(This is one reason why the first Batman movie        puts me to sleep.
) This gives most of the beheadings that        take place in Sleepy Hollow a detached quality -- they are        almost certainly meant to be tongue-in-cheek, but I'd like        them to be a little more lively.
The marketing campaign        (tagline: "Heads will roll") promised some chaotic wickedness        along the lines of Burton's previous Mars Attacks!, a        sensibility that is, to some extent, in evidence; still,        while the scenes are technically impressive, they remain        strangely uninvolving.
(You'd think a stylist like Burton        would be above the kind of shameless computer-animated        ooga-booga that's used for a cheap shock in one scene, but        you'd be wrong.
).        More on-target are the grisly aftermaths of the murders,        which are presented with a morbidly tongue-in-cheek        sensibility.
There's a certain gothic fascination in the        sight of Crane kneeling next to a headless corpse, examining        the reddish-pink tissue of an open neck.
It's gruesome, but        it's a friendly gruesomeness (Burton complained that his        movie, which is exactly the sort of thing that healthy        13-year-old boys live for, was saddled with a restrictive R        rating, rather than a PG-13, and he does have a point).
In counterpoint to these almost elegant visuals, the        screenplay, by Andrew Kevin Walker (Se7en, 8MM) is just too        busy.
Abandoning the premise of the original Washington        Irving story, which posited the Headless Horseman as a morbid        hoax perpetrated on gullible villagers, Walker positions the        Horseman as a strictly supernatural phenomenon -- a fine        idea, in itself.
The dialogue is pleasantly stylized, but the        story is hopelessly overwritten, drawing our attention away        from the vengeful galloping ghost who's the film's        centerpiece and into the banal convolutions of village life.
It only gets worse as the tale goes on.
Not only must we buy        into some piffle about the horseman being controlled by one        of the townspeople, but we're expected to care about their        petty schemings and power plays, all this while there's a        back-from-the-grave villain running around who's frankly much        more interesting than any of them.
That the screenplay is so bloated with unnecessary        contrivance is a particular shame in light of the various        wonders that Burton and Co. have worked elsewhere.
In terms        of visuals, this picture is perhaps the most sure-footed of        the year.
It's photographed in shades of blue and slate-grey,        with a bloody garnish the color of cherry pie.
Johnny Depp        appears as pale and frightened as the little boys who figure        into the movie's backstory, and kudos are certainly due for        the casting of an uncredited Christopher Walken as a        distorted, silver-teethed rhyme to Depp's fragile        handsomeness.
Christina Ricci is even more delicate here than        Depp, her round-eyed and childlike china-doll demeanor        married to a potent yet unassuming sensuality.
Late in the        film, with her head pulled back and her throat in peril,        we're convinced that something beautiful is in horrible        danger.
Sleepy Hollow could have done well with a rewrite        that relied more on moments of such innate drama, and less on        narrative convolution.
