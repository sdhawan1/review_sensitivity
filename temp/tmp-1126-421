In the past 5 years, animation has come a long way; or so it seems.
New formats, including high-tech computer animation are threatening to take the glamour away from Disney's yearly "masterpiece".
However, it is a film like "The Iron Giant", without any sidekicks or musical interludes, that I think can make the most change for the genre.
"The Iron Giant" is a wonderful film for adults and kids that just happens to be animated.
It is the story of a boy named Hogarth(what?
)  who, in 1950's Maine, discovers an iron giant made by a foreign country as a weapon.
However, this being the movies, the iron giant turns out to have a heart of gold, and learns to triumph over his impulses.
Christopher McDonald voices a government agent who is after the iron giant because he believes he can cause harm, and Jennifer Aniston is Hogarth's single mother.
While the story is kid-friendly, adults will enjoy the precise reworking of small-town 1950, where people fear the dropping of "the bomb" and learn to "duck and cover".
Despite being a fine film, "The Iron Giant" feels a lot like a tired rehash of "E.T.
" But director Brad Bird has a lot of creative vision, and writer Tim McCanlies("Dancer, Texas Pop.
81") makes the dialogue sound real; a rare quality in an animated film.
"The Iron Giant" is a successful experiment that might have been better, but its heart is in the right place, and it truly is a film that adults will enjoy just as much as the kids.
Take a chance and see this flick.
