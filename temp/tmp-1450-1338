This is the best film of the year.
If TITANIC (****) wins Best Picture at the Oscars it will be a tragedy the size of FORREST GUMP (***) over PULP FICTION (****).
The sad fact is that TITANIC will win.
Nothing against TITANIC which is one of the best films of the year, LA.
CONFIDENTIAL is just soo much better.
LA.
CONFIDENTIAL is a masterpiece of a film set in the 1940's and dealing with three cops, one a "celebrity" cop, one a pit bull, and the other a kid raising through the ranks by screwing over other cops.
They are thrown into a massacre that turns out to be a very complex puzzle of twists and turns.
Every aspect of this film is beautifully composed, the look, dialog and acting is key.
Who would expected a film this wonderful from Curtis Hanson (co-writer/director) after he inflicted us with THE RIVER WILD (**1/2) and HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE (**)?
Who would have expected a film this complex and intricate?
The cast is fantastic, consisting of 4 red hot actors.
Guy Pearce is quite a discovery as the department hated cop, his last film was ADVENTURES OF PRICELLA QUEEN OF THE DESERT(!).
Kevin Spacey delivers a knockout performance that out does that of THE USUAL SUSPECTS (****).
Russel Crowe hasn't been this good since his Aussie film ROMPER STOMPER (***1/2).
James Cromwell continues his critical waves, created with BABE (***).
All hope of a Best Picture oscar is not completly lost.
TITANIC didn't recieve a nomination for screenplay or lead actor.
The distinction that made it so much higher than other films were action awards (sound, visual effects,...).
If CONFIDENTIAL comes up unvictorious to the boat don't be suprised.
Remember Fargo, Pulp, .......... .
