"Have you ever had a dream so real, that you wondered if this dream is reality or not?.
" Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) said that to Neo (Keanu Reeves) in The Matrix (1999).
The story of this movie is mixing up reality and virtuality.
After you seen this movie, you'll probably be wondering what is real, what is not, and all that stuff in between like hyperreality and surreality.
This is what the Wachowski brothers do with The Matrix.
So many special effects that make people think whether this movie is real or a computer-animated creation.
Well, a few things are real though, all the Ray-Bans worn and the Nokias used.
So this Neo is a hacker, which is the most logical explanation of how he got into this virtual, or real world.
His main quest is finding Morpheus, who is like a God-Hacker.
With the help of Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) he finds him.
It turns out that Morpheus and Trinity are fighting for the human race, and Neo is likely to be The One, the one that can save the human race.
Just like a reincarnation of Buddha (Hey, that was Keanu too!).
Here, Neo will start all his kung-fu lessons in becoming The One, if he is the one.
One thing leads to another, and then you'll see one hell of an action scene.
Neo and Trinity walking into a highly guarded building, shooting guards and doing tricks in slow motion, both in black, without even sweating.
This scene is awesome, and I'm sure that it will be nominated for MTV's Movie Award as Best Action Sequence.
That's all I can say about the story.
Oh, and what is The Matrix?
Go see and find out yourself.
It's worth it.
At least you can choose one of the many Ray-Bans for this summer.. .
