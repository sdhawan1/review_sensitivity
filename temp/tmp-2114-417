U-571 [Mostow] -- To summarize Breakdown, Jonathan Mostow's previous endeavor, I'd offer about sixty-seven synonyms for the words taut, powerful, suspenseful, professional, so on, so forth.
Or, to much more magnify the apparent slump that he appears to be in, I offer The Game, 1997's best film, as far as I'm concerned, for which Mostow served as executive producer.
This, for the observant among you, however, is not Breakdown -- nor, by a long shot, The Game.
Very little of this one works, thespians included.
The plot is interesting, I suppose, but it's execution is not.
The action is tepid: in fact, some of it is laced with such boredom that the exit sign appeared much more interesting than the goings on screen.. .
