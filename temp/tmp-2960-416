Starring: Demi Moore, Anne Bancroft, Viggo Mortensen Director: Ridley Scott. Synopsis: Test case Jordan O'neill (Demi Moore), eyes glaring beneath her military crew cut, must survive rigorous basic training for the US Navy Seals, an elite special forces division because if she makes it, the military might rewrite its guidelines restricting women in the armed forces.
O-neill (Demi) deals with discrimination from the men, a cruel instructor (Viggo Mortensen), and questionable politics by Senator DeHaven (Anne Bancroft).
The film consists mostly of training scenes of recruits doing grueling exercise and of course one obligatory ending scene where an emergency forces the recruits to use their skills in real life.
Take a guess.
Will Demi pass this macho training with flying colors and earn the respect of her seemingly cruel commander so that the credits can roll?
Opinion: Director Ridley Scott, who directed Sigourney Weaver in that Alien movie with the space marines definitely has a flair for creating strong female characters amidst gung ho military boys.
If you can stomach watching 40 minutes of pushups and situps and a pre-fab action ending, you'll love this film.
If not, you'll probably feel that it was still an okay film, Demi Moore does a great  job acting, but they can lop off 20 minutes worth of exercise film no problem.
The moral of this movie is: never give up.. .
