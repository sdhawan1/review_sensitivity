There has always been the question about the difference between Art and Pornography.
I was reticent about seeing this film because of the hype and the previews that preceded it.
I dreaded that I might be offended or embarrassed by it.
No.
It is Art.
How many times have you scoffed at an actor who declares that he (or she) would consider nudity `if the role warrants it for artistic reasons' when you know full well that he's only making a dumb excuse.
The nudity in this film did not bother me in the slightest.
It is Art.
Never before have I seen a motion picture that has stayed with me in its entirety.
I can call to mind every single scene that I saw.
Each and every actor is embedded in my head, from the leads to the one-liners.
There are constant surprises, such as the costume shop, and the hotel clerk that are special, but even the rowdies on the street or the butlers are perfect.
I don't think that Kubrick only did take after take with the stars, he did it with everyone.
What a thrill those actors must have felt to have a Director bring them to full performance rather than dismissing them as `background'.
This movie is a very deep study into the workings of a marriage.
Love is not the only basis for a lasting commitment.
Just as important is trust, without which, love crumbles.
That is the basis of the plot.
Here is a  happily married couple, with a darling, educated daughter.
They are financially secure, socially prominent and physically attracted to each other.
They have achieved the American dream.
They are so secure in their relationship that it bothers her when he doesn't show jealousy about her and a flirtation.
The distrust starts to build and they jibe at each other.
What happens in the next 48 hours is a great presentation of what could occur.
This is a Masterpiece.
This is Art.
I do want to see it again, but I don't need to.
It's imbedded in my mind.. .
