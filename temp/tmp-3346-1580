     In "Everyone Says I Love You", Bob (Alan Alda) is devastated that his son is a conservative Republican.
Joe (Woody Allen) is using his charm to hit on Von (Julia Roberts).
It's the kind of stuff we're use to expecting in Woody Allen movies, with generally satisfying results.
I won't reveal the plot, as watching out what turns up is one of the best parts of "Everyone Says I Love You".
Many of the conversations during the movie are absolutely hilarious, in many cases I could barely contain myself.
Possibly the best moments in this movie are the little ones.
Watching Woody Allen and Goldie Hawn dancing in Paris was wonderful.
The maid of Bob's home does a great job of playing a despotic role: In one notable scene after discussing why Italian pasta needs sauce, the maid exclaims "They're weak!".
Even though the musical scenes can get tedious at times, you can see Woody Allen is poking fun at the genre.
However, possibly the greatest moment of "Everyone Says I Love You" is when Charles Ferry (Tim Roth), an ex-convict, comes to Bob's house for dinner.
At this point in the movie we see Tim Roth at his tough guy "Reservoir Dogs" best - it's a memorable scene.
"Everyone Says I Love You" is another Woody Allen movie that succeeds in making the audience laugh.
It's a solid, well made movie and is definitely worth a rental at your local video store.. .
