Ingredients:  Post-Apocalyptic world, lone man, beautiful woman, evil warlord . Synopsis:  It is the year 2013.
The United States has been destroyed and is only a legend.
Civilization is reduced to shambles.
All that is left are pitiful isolated settlements in the American West and Northwest that pay tribute to a tyrannical warlord named General Bethlehem (Will Patton).
Enter a traveling beggar named Shakespeare (Kevin Costner) who does stage performances for food, but is usually unwelcome in the suspicious towns.
One day Shakespeare tells a grand lie.
To get accepted into town he tells the people at the gates that he is a postman representing the restored government of the United States.
To everyone's surprise, people really believe in the restored United States, and this eventually leads to a full scale revolt against evil General Bethlehem, with a reluctant Shakespeare caught in the middle of the situation.
Opinion: Costner seems comfortable and in his element here, as far as acting is concerned.
This movie seems part WATERWORLD and part DANCES WITH WOLVES, because the time period is post-Apocalypse like WATERWORLD, yet the story takes place in the vast Western wilderness like DANCES WITH WOLVES.
Eric Roth, the screenwriter of Forrest Gump co-wrote the script to this movie so of course it features a gosh-darn humble American hero with lots of apple pie and cavalry scenes and flag saluting, and American values.
THE POSTMAN tries to be a sweeping epic about a lone wilderness guy perpetuating a Santa-Clause-type lie that revives a fallen America.
If you go for a lot of horse-riding and flag-waving, you'll probably like the movie, though it might seem about 30 minutes too long.
However, If you're not into all that Americana stuff, you'll find THE POSTMAN watchable, but a bit corny.
The way to approach this movie is to watch it as if it's a Saturday afternoon HERCULES adventure.. .
