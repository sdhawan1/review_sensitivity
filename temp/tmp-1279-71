I have not read the novel by "Anonymous" Joe Klein, and I wouldn't have  picked the film "Primary Colors" as my first choice of the weekend, but  I was pleasantly engaged.
First, John Travolta is right-on as Jack Stanton -- the Clintonesque  quiet yet raspy drawl, the gut, the "tell me your pain" empathy.
Emma  Thompson is almost as strong as first lady-to-be Susan Stanton.
In one  scene in which this stolidly patient wife discovers another dalliance,  Thompson snaps magnificently: it's as if her soul is slipping out of  her.
Her anger and then her grief are stunning to watch.
She'll probably be forgotten by the end of the year, but Kathy Bates  should get nominated for supporting actress.
As Libby the "Dust Buster,"  her character protects (as much as possible) the name of Jack Stanton, a  friend from the 70's.
Bates brings a literally crazy abandon to Libby,  who is one of the few characters who is even concerned about taking and  passing a morality test.
I've read in other reviews about a flaw in narration.
Henry is the  campaign worker through whose eyes we see most of the action.
The  trouble is that Adrian Lester turns in a performance that is solid but  not dynamic.
Sure, no one wants to try to out-act Bates and Travolta and  Thornton, but Henry never shows us the passion that he claims to hold in  his heart; he keeps it in his head.
What causes him to stop working for  one politician, to forfeit his relationship with a beautiful woman, to  change his mind so easily when Jack Stanton asks him to?
"Primary Colors" sports a superb cast, down to the extras.
Mike Nichols'  last few efforts have been strong and solid, and this adds to the  string. . . .
