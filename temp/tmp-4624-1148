Capsule Review: The ongoing quest to adapt every single television series ever made to = the big screen (soon, only Manimal and She=92s the Sheriff will remain = untouched) continues with this disappointing attempt at a franchise, in = which a clan of eggheads roam the universe looking for a damned map.
= While there are some fun moments in the first half of the film = (including some neat special effects and a nifty attack by some cool = little spider monsters) they soon get swallowed up in a morass of creaky = moralizing and ill-conceived cutesy elements - particularly the = appearance of a badly animated galactic space monkey that=92s so = blatantly designed for future merchandising profits it=92d make an Ewok = hurl.
The bulk of the blame for this movie=92s faults can be placed on = the pointed head of screenwriter Akiva Goldsman (inexplicably able to = remain employed after the horrendous Batman & Robin) whose one-liner = intensive script seems to be hastily cobbled together out of old Laffy = Taffy wrappers.
Although Lost in Space has its surface pleasures (mostly = supplied by a campily subdued Gary Oldman) and will probably be enjoyed = by kids, it may leave the viewer with some dark and unlovely thoughts = about just how calculated the whole Hollywood blockbuster process has = become - if this is any indication, it could be a long summer at the = movies, folks.
