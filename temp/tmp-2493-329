Creature features are always popular, take one part cliched script, add two parts awesome special effects, and one cup of stars and you've got a success.
Obviously this is usually never true, but in Lake Placid, it works.
A deputy is bit in half right before the sheriff (Brendan Gleeson) in the town's lake by a giant crocodile.
The top of the man is taken to the morgue where they discover a tooth hidden among the flesh and carnage.
Kelly (Fonda) has just been dumped by her boss for another co-worker, when news of the tooth is delivered he sends her down so he can have some private time with his new friend.
Two other characters show up, game warden Jack Wells (Pullman) who constantly has a macho smile and denim wardrobe about him and mythology professor Oliver Platt who views crocodiles as godly and loves to take swims with them.
Lake Placid will keep you laughing more than anything else, the two minorly frightening scenes of the film aren't that exciting so they fill it with humor, a wise choice.
A good choice especially with Betty White as Mrs. Delores Bickerman a SSU (seriously screwed up) woman who feeds her cattle (and her husband) to the crocodile.
Finally, Hollywood has made a movie so hilariously bad and totally outrageous that you can enjoy it.
Come along for one heck of a bad movie that's bad enough to be good, which earns my *** stars..
