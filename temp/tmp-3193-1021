Only so rarely do I ever even rent a horror movie, I'm just not that big into them.
Scream, directed by Wes Craven, is one of those rare horror movies that appeals to me because the characters are not stupid.
Anyway, the movie starts out with Casey having an evening at home.
A mysterious man calls on the phone and pesters her with question from horror movie.
"Who was the killer from Halloween" "Michael Myers" she bellows very scardly.
She then proceeds to find that her boyfriend Steve has already been murdered.
The thing that has done this is now after her.
She sub-sequently dies and is hung.
The story shifts to the aftermath of the killings at the local high school.
Everyone is freaked out after their best friends Casey and Steve have been killed.
The next victim is Sydney (Neve Campbell).
Sidney manages to survive the attempt and her boyfriend found on the scene is taken away to prison.
The movie spirals beyond the point of no return with you thinking about four different people commited the crime...and it turns out how actually did it is no one you would have ever imagined.
The bright spot of this movie was Henry Winkler.
Someone in the theater bursted out "Hey, that's the Fonz.
"  He played the lovable principle at the high school.
I loved this movie because it mixed the perfect amount of suspense, comedy (yes, comedy), and not too much gore that it becomes disgusting.
The gore is plentiful; but not excessive.
I would recommend going to see this movie if you haven't yet, ir if you have, go see it again.. .
