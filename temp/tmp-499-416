Ingredients: neo-Nazi, redemption, legacy, family. Starring: Edward Norton, Edward Furlong. Synopsis: When Venice Beach high school student Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) becomes drawn to the neo-Nazi movement, the principal puts Danny in a personal tutoring program whereby he must write about the life his older brother Derek (Edward Norton), whom he idolizes.
Through Danny's eyes, AMERICAN HISTORY X tells the tale of how wayward brother Derek became involved with the neo-Nazi movement, was sentenced to prison for a shooting, served time, and faced the legacy of his mistakes.
Opinion: AMERICAN HISTORY X is a non-formula movie that approaches neo-Nazism from a non-stereotypical view.
It shows how seemingly average teens with empty lives might get caught up in a racist social movement perpetrated by demagogues with political ambitions.
Aside from redemption, another central theme of AMERICAN HISTORY X is the concept of legacy.
A man might serve time in prison, but for both victims and aggressors, the consequences of former actions continue.
Although the pace of the film somewhat uneven at times, and there is perhaps one unnecessary scene in the last third of the movie, AMERICAN HISTORY X is an excellent family drama that is well photographed and poignant as well as superbly acted.
