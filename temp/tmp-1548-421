rated G Walt Disney Pictures 88 minutes starring the voices of Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver, Glenn Close, Nigel Hawthorne, Alex D. Linz, Rosie O'Donnell, Wayne Knight based on the story "Tarzan Of The Apes" by Edgar Rice Burroughs written by Tab Murphy, Bob Tzudiker and Noni White directed by Chris Buck and Kevin Lima. Although many movie studios have taken the animation genre to unexpected heights in the past five years, the films carrying the Disney logo are still the most memorable.
"Tarzan", Disney's latest, is no exception.
Using the original story by Edgar Rice Burroughs, "Tarzan" breaks little new ground, but it is still an entertaining treat.
"Tarzan" features Tony Goldwyn(director of "A Walk On The Moon") as the title character, and Minnie Driver as Jane, his love interest.
The story is the oft-told one about the boy who is raised as a gorilla and uses his animal instincts to woo a woman who is studying the gorillas.
At times, "Tarzan" is very derivative of "The Lion King", and the characters aren't nearly as well developed as those in that film.
But "Tarzan" is an animated film that people of all ages should enjoy.
