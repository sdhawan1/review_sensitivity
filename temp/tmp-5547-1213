The film Luc Besson had been wanting to make for ages is finally here.
And, its good fun!
This film wa poorly recieved in America, with many people saying that it was just 'rubbish.
' But I found it enjoyable, cheesy rubbish.
The film is knows it is cheesy, and never takes itself seriously, which is what saves this film.
If the film was serious the whole way through, this would of been one of the worst films of 1997.
Willis plays a cab driver in the future, who is just driving along until a young woman smashes through the roof.
She turns out to be the 'fifth    element', who will save the earth from a planet heading straight for it.
However, they must stop Oldman from getting the her, otherwise the whole world will be destroyed!
Cheesy, eh?
But the film makes up for its dreadful plot, with it sense of humour, and its very good speacial    effects.
Some of the effects are incredible.
Willis gives his usual 'John Maclane' performance, Oldman is just crazy, and there is a D.J later on who did nothing but annoy me.
But, generally, the peformances are very good.
Overall, then, I found this film very enjoyable sci-fi hokum.
