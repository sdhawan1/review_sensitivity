My mind is constantly at work in all the movies I see.
My brain races to find the ending of a film even before its plot has been fully revealed.
I didn't let my mind race in Good Will Hunting, because I was too caught up in the dialogue and characterizations.
I couldn't ruin the experience of the film but trying to out-think it.
This is a wonderful film that reminded me of CHASING AMY, another of the years best films.
The writing is very funny and fresh, with some of the best dialogue spoken all year.
I relish in good writing, in a year when we are enflicted with trash like THE SAINT and DANTES PEAK.
I laughed more in this film than I did in most comidies like LIAR LIAR and THE FULL MONTY.
Matched with the funny comedy is truely heart wrenching moments that reminded me of TERMS OF ENDEARMENT, one of the best films in the eighties.
Damon and Affleck will probable win the best screenplay oscar and deserve it.
Critics who dismis this film as being overly predictable are not doing the film justice.
SOme of these are the same guys who over-praised the film SLING BLADE.. .
