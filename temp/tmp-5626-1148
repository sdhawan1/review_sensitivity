Capsule Review:     After a brief and somewhat disconcerting flirtation with the = conventional, FARGO creators and supreme weisenheimers Joel & Ethan Coen = have returned to the fringe big time with this, their loosest film to = date.
A radically disheveled Jeff Bridges headlines as the titular Dude, = a hazy bowling obsessed slacker who gets reluctantly drawn into the = Coens' favorite plot device - a haywire kidnapping scheme.
It's a = tantalizing setup - THE BIG SLEEP with Jeff Spicoli instead of Philip = Marlowe - but the film never really builds on it, preferring instead to = dance around the edges and introduce as many wacky characters (including = ace performances by Coen mainstays John Goodman, John Turturro, and an = underutilized Steve Buscemi) and absurd situations as it possibly can.
Although there are plenty of laughs to be had, what ultimately makes = this film feel like a minor effort is the lack of the tightly coiled = (albeit noticeably bent) internal logic that governed the duo's previous = efforts and which made even the goofiest scenes seem connected with the = narrative as a whole; this is the first of their movies that feels like = it was pretty much being made up as it went along.
While longtime fans will find much to savor amid the mess = (particularly Goodman's superb performance and an awesomely gonzo = musical dance sequence), LEBOWSKI isn't likely to satisfy the mainstream = audience that jumped aboard the bandwagon with FARGO - and that just = might be the Coens' biggest and best joke of all.=20.
