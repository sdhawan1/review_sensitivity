Starring-Pierce Brosnan, Sophie Marceau, Robert Carlyle, Denise Richards, Judi Dench and Robbie Coltrane Director-Michael Apted Rated PG. For the nineteenth entry in his forever cherished franchise, James Bond has pulled nothing particularly special out of his hat.
At first glimpse of the dashing new Bond girls, the wildly implausible action sequences and the nifty Bond gadgets, dedicated 007 fans may dismiss `The World is Not Enough' as merely same old.
Fortunately though, in terms of boisterous rollicking action, you still know what name to turn to.
In his third outing as the suave and sophisticated superspy, Pierce Brosnan appears to be even more lightweight and comfortable than previously evident.
Cool and refined, he portrays Bond more solidly and compact than any actor since Sean Connery.
In the opening sequence, Bond pursues a female sniper in an exhilarating boat race that covers water and (*ahem*) land.
Later on, he evades parachuting villains on ski-doos while skiing down a treacherous mountainside (`See you back at the lodge' he quips, as an unfortunate attacker plummets off the side of the mountain).
The action sequences and set-pieces of `The World is Not Enough' are loaded with top-drawer inventiveness, bursting with merciless excitement at every turn.
It also must be noted that the film has some mediocre aspects.
The plot is lumpy and uneven and certain characters are put to perpetual waste.
The plot follows Bond as he travels to protect Elektra King (Sophie Marceau), the daughter of a deceased billionaire who was invested in the world oil business.
Elektra is believed to be the next target of the devious Russian terrorist Renard (Robert Carlyle), who has a bullet lodged in his medulla oblongata that renders him completely impervious to pain.
The bald-headed Renard was voted the #1 Bond villain in a recent pole.
But despite the initial possibilities of such a cool physical attribute, director Michael Apted ignores the strengths of Carlyle's considerable talent, presenting Renard as a bit of a wuss.
I was hoping for more, to say the least.
Returning characters add spice to this unspectacular entry.
Academy Award-winner Judi Dench returns as M, and once again she positively showcases the character's authority.
Robbie Coltrane reprises his role from `Goldeneye', playing a plump turkey of a villain named Valentin Zukovsky, who's so likable it's hard to classify him as a villain.
On a more dramatic note, the legendary weapons-maker Q (Desmond Llewelyn) is retiring after appearing in (nearly) every Bond movie since 1963's `From Russia With Love'.
The good news: he is being replaced by John Cleese, playing the younger protégé R (get it?).
Cleese is a funny man, although here he is given only a few precious moments of screen and one or two good lines (one of them being when he describes the attachments on Bond's new BMW, adding it contains `six beverage cup holders').
`The World is Not Enough' is strictly formula Bond, granted, it's a formula that is still fun.
One great scene has the spy evading a helicopter wielding three oversized buzzsaws.
And of course, Bond is given his usual quota of witty punch lines, all of which Brosnan delivers in perfectly straight-faced fashion.
One involves a nuclear physicist named Christmas Jones (Denise Richards), who is apparently only named Christmas Jones to aid in one hilarious bit of dialogue during the film's closing moments.
But Richards is one of the weak links in this choppy adventure.
I mean, she plays a nuclear physicist, for cripes' sakes.
Conveniently, she is the only scientist running around in tight black shorts and an enticing green tanktop.
While the actress (who previously appeared in the risqué sex thriller `Wild Things') is certainly fetching, perhaps her acting abilities aren't quite up to snuff.
At one ludicrous point in the action, a younger viewer sitting behind me had this sarcastic retort: `Yeah, right'.
Boys and girls, Bond movies are not about realistic action.
They are unique thrill rides with daring stunts and exhilarating chase scenes, often succeeding because they are more wild and wacky than any other conventional action films.
Stretching the technological barrier, Bond has some nifty new gadgets here: x-ray sunglasses, a credit card that transforms into a key...
It's not to be taken seriously, but it's fun.
Well, mainly.
There is an element about these last two Bond entries (the previous being `Tomorrow Never Dies') that drains certain excitement from the premise.
With this ingredient absent from the formula, `The World is Not Enough' remains tasty, but ultimately it is lacking in a few vital areas of humanity that were alive and evident in the classic Connery films.
For his next outing, James Bond could certainly use a fresh canvas to explore something more different and exciting.
`The World is Not Enough' is entertaining, though, you've got to admit.
James Bond is certainly not dead.
He simply needs some shock treatment.
