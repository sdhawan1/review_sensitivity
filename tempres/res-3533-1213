1. Sadly, he forget to                  ... pos = 2.5   	neg = 0.625
2. Nic Cage plays Rick                  ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.375
3. ) An assassination t                 ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.75 
4. The film uses flashb                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0  
5. However, the film do                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.625
6. Although there are s                 ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.0  
7. The problem is that                  ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0.375
8. He tries to offshoot                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.875
9. Nic Cage and Gary Si                 ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.875
10. They are boring, fac                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.875
11. Yes, another problem                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.5  
12. We're supposed to be                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.125
13. However, his change                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.75 
14. Poor Gary Sinise's c                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 1.125
15. The film's use of fl                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
16. While clever and int                ... pos = 1.625 	neg = 0.25 
17. They certainly don't                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
18. There is small threa                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.25 
19. The script is lousy                 ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.875
20. Certainly not good f                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.625
21. The most depressing                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
22. There's a good story                ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0.25 
23. It also gives itself                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.25 
24. While the performanc                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.5
