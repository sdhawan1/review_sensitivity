50. There's a vague desi                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.0  
51. But this is perhaps                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.5  
52. [1] That's the subst                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.5  
53. Undergrad gets into                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 2.0

60. This is after Danzig                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
61. Von Neumann is there                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
62. So Danzig is up at t                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.625
63. The moral is that vo                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
64. A simpler moral: von                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
