0. I'm surprised at the                 ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.0  
1. While purposefully a                 ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
2. Or perhaps it's just                 ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.125
3. Undeniably, MISSION                  ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.5  
4. De Palma's  track re                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 1.0  
5. At the other end of                  ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.625
6. It's these comparati                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
7. The most obvious hom                 ... pos = 3.375 	neg = 0.375
8. Conceptwise, it's an                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
9. Science Fiction has                  ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 1.0  
10. There's very little                 ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0.5  
11. That leaves us with                 ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.125
12. It's also reminded u                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.375
13. On the negative side                ... pos = 2.875 	neg = 1.625
14. I don't necessarily                 ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.375
15. Also   and in spit                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.625
16. For once he presents                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.125
17. And this time, when                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
18. For my  money, the p                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
19. It looks  fabulous o                ... pos = 1.5   	neg = 0.375
20. Granted, there are s                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 1.875
21. It comes back to wha                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
22. My guess is that the                ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0.625
23. Another 2001?                       ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.125
24. Not likely; there wi                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.25 
25. CLOSE ENCOUNTERS?                   ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0    
26. No, that was  pointe                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.375
27. APOLLO 13?                          ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0    
28. No, that was fact, a                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.5  
29. MISSION TO MARS is                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
30. In the meantime, and                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.875
31. Or to put it another                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.25 
32. Postscript: It's rea                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0
