0. Director: Tony Kaye                  ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
1. It not only takes ba                 ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.625
2. The subject of this                  ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.0  
3. He's the one who ins                 ... pos = 1.625 	neg = 0.125
4. He's so utterly conv                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
5. His name is Derek Vi                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
6. When we first see hi                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.625
7. He so believes in hi                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0  
8. "American History X"                 ... pos = 1.875 	neg = 2.125
9. We see him at all of                 ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.5  
10. Or at least, that's                 ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.0  
11. The film's framing d                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.0  
12. When the film opens,                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.875
13. Coincidentally, this                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
14. He's just as intelli                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.0  
15. He's no longer contr                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.875
16. But Danny won't.                    ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.0  
17. He goes to a large s                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
18. The film circles aro                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.625
19. We mostly see Derek                 ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 1.5  
20. To them, the white m                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.125
21. And frighteningly en                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.0  
22. "American History X"                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.125
23. In it, there are som                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.0  
24. One scene features a                ... pos = 2.375 	neg = 0.125
25. Another scene uses h                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.875
26. And another soon-to-                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.375
27. There's much more to                ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 1.875
28. Norton walks off wit                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.625
29. In only the fifth mo                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.0  
30. There's nothing like                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.875
31. That he allows the l                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.375
32. Sadly enough, this i                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.875
33. It's too unambitious                ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 1.125
34. The ending, especial                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.25 
35. Some of the skinhead                ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0.375
36. Furlong's Danny neve                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.375
37. Even Derek's descent                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
38. Though his fireman f                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.375
39. As such, one can see                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
40. Sorta.                              ... pos = 0     	neg = 0    
41. "American History X"                ... pos = 1.75  	neg = 1.25 
42. Somewhere, he claims                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 1.25 
43. Although he aimed fo                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.5  
44. Kaye's right in that                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.0  
45. This will not be a "                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
46. Yet it still gets it                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 1.125
47. And even if it isn't                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
