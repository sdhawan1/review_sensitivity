1. So  many movies I se                 ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 1.0  
2. For an example of th                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.25 
3. But with "The Thin R                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
4. This film has either                 ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.375
5. I suppose being admi                 ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 1.125
6. It  has a wonderful                  ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.0  
7. " And  there's a who                 ... pos = 3.375 	neg = 0.25 
8. But what exactly is                  ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 1.5  
9. "The Thin Red Line"                  ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0.125
10. As the story begins,                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.25 
11. One of the AWOL sold                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0    
12. Witt  (Jim Caviezel)                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
13. Welsh (Sean Penn), a                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.5  
14. But this film isn't                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
15. Malick's film, also                 ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.0  
16. In fact, it'd be not                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 1.625
17. A correct statement,                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0  
18. I believe in the  la                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
19. The plot soon kicks                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
20. The  Lieutenenant, a                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 1.25 
21. Captain Staros (Elia                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 1.0  
22. Pvt.                                ... pos = 0     	neg = 0    
23. Bell  (Ben Chaplin,                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
24. Most of the others a                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 1.25 
25. In fact, the amount                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 1.25 
26. The main part of the                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.875
27. I can only attribute                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.125
28. A  friend noticed no                ... pos = 3.25  	neg = 1.625
29. In fact, this entire                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
30. Malick, as usual, br                ... pos = 3.0   	neg = 0.125
31. But that's what I li                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
32. " It's like every  s                ... pos = 2.25  	neg = 0.125
33. But each narration o                ... pos = 1.75  	neg = 0.5  
34. Yet at the same  tim                ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 1.125
35. But again, where is                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
36. Is he trying to mere                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.75 
37. If he is, he's not o                ... pos = 1.875 	neg = 1.0  
38. Or is he trying to s                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.625
39. Well...that would be                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 1.0  
40. Or is he trying to s                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.625
41. Again, if this was w                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.25 
42. Or, as my best guess                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 1.0  
43. He doesn't seem to j                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
44. The entire film is s                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.25 
45. Could this be the  l                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.25 
46. Malick?).                           ... pos = 0     	neg = 0    
47. Or is Malick just pu                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.0  
48. Whatever this film m                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 1.625
49. But the point is tha                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 1.0  
50. Frustrating, yes, bu                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.0
