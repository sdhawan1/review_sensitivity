19. One of the problems                 ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.5  
20. True, there is exact                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.25 
21. But he's so painfull                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.875
22. Does he neglect his                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0

37. The guess here is th                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.375
38. As John Milton, Beel                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.25

54. Like, who you tryin'                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
55. The point is that th                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.25 
56. All that was require                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 1.0  
57. But Reeves has no ap                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0
