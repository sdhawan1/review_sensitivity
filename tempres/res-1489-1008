46. ") . Each of these e                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.375
47. In each example Spie                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.0  
48. But the examples don                ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0.0  
49. The effect is that y                ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0.125
50. And since the story                 ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.125
