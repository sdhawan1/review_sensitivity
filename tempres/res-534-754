29. By the time Malick h                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.625
30. Malick's use of voic                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 1.375
31. Too often we are unc                ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 1.0  
32. Worse, too often tho                ... pos = 1.875 	neg = 1.75 
33. When they are far mo                ... pos = 1.625 	neg = 0.75

37. The effect is to con                ... pos = 4.375 	neg = 0.375
38. Ultimately, it prove                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
39. Far too little in th                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 1.125
40. I presume Malick und                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.25 
41. Malick's choice to r                ... pos = 1.5   	neg = 0.125
42. It takes quite a whi                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.125
43. In typical Hollywood                ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0.375
44. But in "The Thin Red                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 1.0  
45. Nothing says that a                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.375
46. Malick either denies                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
47. It takes a long time                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.5  
48. These choices harm t                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0    
49. And that's a tremend                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.75 
50. In addition to the m                ... pos = 2.25  	neg = 0.0

54. The center section o                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.5  
55. This section, which                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.25

60. Death strikes from a                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.0  
61. Unfortunately, Malic                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.0  
62. He ultimately has on                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.125
63. The film seems like                 ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
64. Malick is also to be                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.25 
65. The most obvious ins                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.875
66. But Malick gives the                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.0  
67. Nolte's obsessive Co                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 1.5  
68. Many critics have sa                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.0  
69. Perhaps that's true.                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0    
70. However, on first vi                ... pos = 2.125 	neg = 0.25 
71. As such, it's defini                ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0.0
