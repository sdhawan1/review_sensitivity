0. Nicolas Cage stars a                 ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.25 
1. He is also unlucky e                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.25 
2. But who did it?                      ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
3. Why?                                 ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.0  
4. So Santoro and his c                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 1.0  
5. And yes, a massive c                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0  
6. Promised, but not de                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
7. I knew going in who                  ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.875
8. Follow the hidden Ho                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 1.125
9. Even so, I will atte                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
10. The cast and directo                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
11. The directing is fan                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
12. Which is all the mor                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
13. For example: Cage ha                ... pos = 1.75  	neg = 1.0  
14. And he struggles.                   ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0    
15. He knows this person                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
16. And this goes on for                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
17. All and well, except                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
18. Nice tears, but you+                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.25 
19. Another example:  Si                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.25 
20. When Sinise gets ang                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.0  
21. His eyes bulge out,                 ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.0  
22. Great.                              ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0    
23. But the logistics of                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.25 
24. He shouldn+t have to                ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0.0  
25. And then the directi                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.125
26. The fight is an esse                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
27. Which is confusing,                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.625
28. There+s another scen                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
29. A wonderful shot.                   ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0    
30. But so what?                        ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.0  
31. There+s no tension i                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
32. Did we need to see w                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.875
33. How about another sc                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.875
34. Cage needs only to t                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.625
35. He doesn+t.                         ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0    
36. Even so, the killer                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.5  
37. But that would make                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.25 
38. Further, that would                 ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0.375
39. (DePalma likes this                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
40. I heard DePalma on a                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
41. It shows.                           ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0    
42. I+m happy to report                 ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.25 
43. But it+s the same ol                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.25 
44. _Snake Eyes_ has bot                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.0  
45. Yet this is the firs                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
46. It+s the screenplay,                ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.125
