16. Sid is now majoring                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
17. Before I go on with                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
18. They are discussing                 ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.0  
19. I'm mentioning this                 ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.125
20. It has the same self                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
21. And why do I conside                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.0  
22. Because of the simpl                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.125
23. The rest of the movi                ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0.125
24. It may just be me, b                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
25. Anyway, back to the                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
26. Needless to say, whe                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.5  
27. Rightfully so, becau                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.5  
28. So who is it this ti                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
29. Who is the real kill                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.5  
30. Could it be Dewey (D                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.375
31. I mean, his sister w                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375

34. Even though his inno                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.25 
35. Of course, you can't                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.75 
36. Maybe she wants to h                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.25

40. Well, there's no way                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.875
41. It was pretty easy t                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.5  
42. You kind of have to                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
43. But just because thi                ... pos = 1.875 	neg = 0.125
44. So I'm going to give                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
45. Don't expect anythin                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0    
46. Of course, there's a                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.5
