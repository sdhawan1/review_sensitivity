4. American Psycho (200                 ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.375
5. The film has been a                  ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.375
6. First of all, it is                  ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 2.0  
7. And then there's the                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.625
8. After watching it, I                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.375
9. American Psycho work                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
10. On one level, it is                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.5  
11. On another level, it                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.25 
12. On another level, it                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 1.125
13. But does it work as                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
14. The film takes place                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.125
15. The film attempts to                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.25 
16. Hence, we are treate                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.75 
17. This is done in such                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
18. One scene involves P                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
19. He then pulls out a                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.25 
20. Another scene involv                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
21. These scenes are rea                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 1.0  
22. As well, there is th                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.25 
23. In one scene, Patric                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
24. But, all throughout                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.5  
25. Towards the conclusi                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.25 
26. This does make for a                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.25 
27. The unfortunate thin                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
28. The film practically                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 1.125
29. >From a technical st                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
30. With a $7M budget (h                ... pos = 2.375 	neg = 0.625
31. But the ambiguous en                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
32. I do recommend this                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
33. This is the type of                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
