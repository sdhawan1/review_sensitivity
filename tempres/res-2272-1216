2. Richard sets off for                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.625
3. Once they get there                  ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
4. This covers about ha                 ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.5  
5. The cinematography a                 ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.125
6. I don't think anyone                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
7. But that is were man                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.125
8. Though the script an                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
9. The plot of the movi                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
10. This is where the mo                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
11. Now up to about two                 ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.375
12. This is where things                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
13. There is even a 'vid                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.0  
14. I am hoping that in                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 1.375
15. The character develo                ... pos = 1.75  	neg = 0.5  
16. Although there is a                 ... pos = 1.5   	neg = 1.25 
17. The character seems                 ... pos = 2.5   	neg = 0.5  
18. The next point is th                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.125
19. Richard is obviously                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.5  
20. This I am sure contr                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.875
21. Now, I shall move on                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.25 
22. The cast and acting                 ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.25 
23. Mind you I think the                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.0  
24. Which begs the quest                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
25. (I think this is a t                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
26. But I like the fact                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.875
27. The international fl                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.75 
28. Not to mention the m                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
29. When all is said and                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.375
30. I would not recommen                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.0  
31. As it is the story t                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 1.125
32. If you do end up goi                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
