31. Comparing it to THE                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0    
32. But as I said, BREAK                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
33. THE VANISHING has a                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0    
34. BREAKDOWN has an exp                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0    
35. Perhaps this is the                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125

45. There are a few flaw                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
46. They certainly don't                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.0  
47. For example, the kid                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0

50. [ON SECOND THOUGHT,                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.875
51. THAT'S ONE LESS FLAW                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0
