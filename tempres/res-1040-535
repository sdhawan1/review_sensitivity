2. After their latest a                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
3. The only ones to esc                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
4. They find out that V                 ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.125
5. He's trying to locat                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.625
6. Now Jack, Montoya, a                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
7. They're using Katrin                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0

9. John Carpenter's "Va                 ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 1.125
10. As I  sat watching t                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 1.5  
11. Yet despite this rea                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.0  
12. There's something fu                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
13. Now, as a horror mov                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.792
14. There's nothing  rem                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 2.375
15. Okay fine, so it's n                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.375
16. How  does it work as                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
17. Well, uh, Woods and                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
18. It gets a tad  tedio                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
19. Fine, how about as a                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
20. There were a couple                 ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 1.0  
21. Okay, so it's not mu                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.375
22. So why exactly did I                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
23. Frankly, I'm still t                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.5  
24. There's plenty of go                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.125
25. Woods ("Contact") is                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.625
26. I mean sure, he's go                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0  
27. Despite all this, he                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0    
28. He's clearly having                 ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.0  
29. Die!").                             ... pos = 0     	neg = 0

31. That  Baldwin I ment                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
32. What's a typical Bal                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
33. Well, it's less than                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 1.375
34. Sheryl Lee's (hey!                  ... pos = 0     	neg = 0

36. ) performance  invol                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 1.0  
37. Finally we have Thom                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.875
38. Yet while James Wood                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 1.25 
39. First, I'm going to                 ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.0  
40. I don't mean it was                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.0  
41. First and foremost i                ... pos = 1.625 	neg = 0.125
42. Now, I realize she's                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
43. Now you must  realiz                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.0  
44. I find it repulsive                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.625
45. I find it even  more                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 1.0  
46. That's just wrong.                  ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.75 
47. Okay, gimme a second                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.75 
48. Alright, as I mentio                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
49. The dialogue is chee                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.875
50. "), the sets are che                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 2.75 
51. You probably won't c                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
52. You'll probably sit                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.5  
53. If you go in wanting                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.25 
54. If you want a deep,                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
55. Carpenter, being the                ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0.125
56. They mainly hit near                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.5  
57. The way in which the                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
58. Carpenter's score is                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.375
59. It actually reminded                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
60. Anyway, despite its                 ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.125
61. The other high  poin                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
62. While it's certainly                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.875
63. In particular I enjo                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.25 
64. "Vampires" runs a li                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.875

66. I wouldn't recommend                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.125
