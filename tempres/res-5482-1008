0. My first reaction to                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0    
1. MARSHALS was that th                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.0  
2. I was wrong, but not                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.875
3. The movie is a seque                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
4. Actually, it's more                  ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
5. This time, Sam Gerar                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
6. Sheridan, like Ford'                 ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.125
7. Sheridan is able to                  ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.875
8. I felt bad for Jones                 ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 1.653
9. In fact, the first t                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
10. It was beneath his d                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
11. When he first read t                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
12. But because Jones to                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
13. Jones' portrayal of                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
14. Also, the pacing was                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.25 
15. No sequence lingered                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.875
16. And the supporting c                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.125
17. The dialog and bante                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.125
18. But the movie also h                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
19. The movie was too un                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 1.25 
20. It looks different f                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.875
21. The structure and ou                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.5  
22. And other than Jones                ... pos = 1.625 	neg = 0.125
23. Snipes' character wa                ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0.25 
24. Robert Downey Jr. ha                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.75 
25. And Ir√©ne Jacob's t                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.75 
26. With U.S.                           ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0    
27. MARSHALS, Baird and                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.25 
28. Skip this one unless                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
29. Shouldn't be too muc                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.375
30. Check out more curre                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0
