1. Starring Richard Ger                 ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.0  
2. What first comes to                  ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.25 
3. So, you'll probably                  ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
4. Well it's not, becau                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
5. The rest is pretty m                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.25 
6. What else do you exp                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
7. The opening scene wa                 ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
8. From the movie title                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
9. ) you can guess.                     ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.0  
10. Julia Roberts is a R                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
11. The story: Ike Graha                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
12. That day he decided                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
13. And the victim is Ma                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
14. Maggie sends a compl                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
15. But he doesn't give                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
16. He goes to Hale to f                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
17. So the story continu                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
18. For Julia Roberts, a                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
19. Something like Consp                ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.0  
20. And Gere shouldn't l                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
21. But they did.                       ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.0  
22. They probably did a                 ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.875
23. It was a typical Hol                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
24. I think Adam Sandler                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0

26. Half of the church f                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
27. And a joke about Fed                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
28. But that's about it.                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
29. My last words, if yo                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0
