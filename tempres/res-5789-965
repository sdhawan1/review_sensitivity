0. Part of the appeal o                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.25 
1. Simple stuff.                        ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
2. Language is similarl                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
3. We're native to the                  ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
4. The trick for the mo                 ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.375
5. And there's so many                  ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
6. Simple confusion is                  ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
7. What, how'd we get h                 ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.0  
8. At the other end of                  ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.5  
9. Meaning that charact                 ... pos = 1.75  	neg = 0.625
10. And this doesn't hap                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
11. But back to the begi                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
12. Double Jeopardy open                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 1.25 
13. As the trailer gives                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.5  
14. But still, it's unfo                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 1.25 
15. Once it does, howeve                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.0  
16. And of course they b                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.375
17. The problem with Dou                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.625
18. When Double Jeopardy                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
19. Or having her make a                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
20. And of course these                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
21. Which does a lot to                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0    
22. But so be it.                       ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
23. In a movie with this                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 1.375
24. David Weisberg and D                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
25. The thing is, though                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.875
26. Or rather, it does w                ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0.0  
27. On the upside, there                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.25 
28. Maybe it's an in-jok                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
29. Or, maybe the whole                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.25 
30. (c) 1999 Stephen Gra                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0
