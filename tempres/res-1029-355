0. A review from the  S                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.875
1. He invents things, t                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.625
2. The  problem for the                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.5  
3. When the grasshopper                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
4. The colony is led by                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
5. While Atta and her s                 ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.125
6. The colony are glad                  ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0.125
7. On his journey, Flik                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.625
8. The troupe think tha                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
9. John Lasseter and An                 ... pos = 2.625 	neg = 0.0  
10. This time, the relea                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0    
11. And while both movie                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.0  
12. A Bug's Life is a fa                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.5  
13. The animation  is br                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.5  
14. Most of the characte                ... pos = 3.25  	neg = 0.0  
15. Much of the humour i                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 1.5  
16. Funnily enough, it i                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.25 
17. Like Toy Story, a  n                ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0.0  
18. However,  the series                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.0  
19. Moreover,  their per                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.125
20. Therefore Hyde Pierc                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.625
21. The problem is, they                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.375
22. Louis-Dreyfus is par                ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.25 
23. This is due, in no s                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
24. It is rather  bland,                ... pos = 2.25  	neg = 1.5  
25. Don't get me wrong -                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 1.25 
26. But the animation is                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
27. There were scenes in                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.0  
28. But maybe that is  n                ... pos = 0     	neg = 1.0  
29. It is also a rather                 ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.125
30. However, before you,                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.125
31. It is the wittiest p                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
