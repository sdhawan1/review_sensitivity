2. However, It's horrib                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 1.625
3. It was written and d                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
4. Mel Gibson, that hol                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
5. What a crock.                        ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0

10. - I suppose honor is                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.125
11. The end of the film                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
12. Which is to say that                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.125
13. In this case, as is                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.25 
14. I miss originality i                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
15. I think audiences ar                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
16. Payback's tagline -                 ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 1.0  
17. While Gibson's chara                ... pos = 3.75  	neg = 1.25 
18. There's nothing bad                 ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 1.125
19. And Gibson knows it                 ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 1.25 
20. The story involves G                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 1.375
21. Gibson recovers from                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.625
22. He makes a point of                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
23. A real bad guy would                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.875
24. This idea is complet                ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.125
25. Gibson ends up going                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
26. What I didn't unders                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
27. $70,000 is like spar                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
28. They'd probably just                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.625
29. I think they'd respe                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.625
30. Maybe I'm being too                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 1.0  
31. Perhaps the filmmake                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.625
32. I read Roger Ebert's                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 1.0  
33. That's why we're all                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
34. And it's true - Gibs                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.25 
35. But he's wrong here.                ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.75 
36. I wanted a Lee Marvi                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125

38. After this many revi                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
39. Really, I don't care                ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.0  
40. I'm just trying to g                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.5
