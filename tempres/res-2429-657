14. This is their arena                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
15. But on any given Sun                ... pos = 1.5   	neg = 0.25 
16. This is certainly Ol                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.125
17. He has always been k                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.5  
18. Nothing is subtle.                  ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.375
19. Everything is in the                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
20. He has proven to be                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
21. And "Any Given Sunda                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.375
22. Yet, there is someth                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.75 
23. It's not that I didn                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0  
24. I certainly did, but                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
25. Maybe because I shar                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.0  
26. But if you ask me "w                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
27. In all his past film                ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0.125
28. But here it seems as                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
29. At first it seems as                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.25 
30. Then Stone starts cr                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.0  
31. It is a confused, bu                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.375
32. Though the script is                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.375

39. Unfortunately these                 ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 1.125
40. Stone gets lost amid                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.625
