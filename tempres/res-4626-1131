0. My form of "rating":                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.375
1. Was that because                     ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
2. Or was it because NA                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
3. I leave that up to y                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
4. [A version of this r                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
5. ].      The story op                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
6. Mallory puts a recor                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
7. A yokel joins in, an                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.75 
8. So Mallory starts be                 ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.5  
9. Nice kids, huh?                      ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0    
10. We then learn a litt                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
11. Mallory is the daugh                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
12. Mickey apparently al                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
13. But the big thing is                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.125
14. So, of course, they'                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
15. And they have zillio                ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.0  
16. As one observes, no                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.5  
17. When they're eventua                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
18. And after they're co                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
19. I usually like to th                ... pos = 2.0   	neg = 0.0  
20. But NATURAL BORN KIL                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.625
21. The *story* is subor                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
22. Take where we learn                 ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.0  
23. We get it presented                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
24. We get a family pres                ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 1.625
25. And that, brothers a                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
26. Throughout, we get e                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
27. When Mickey and Mall                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
28. Periodically during                 ... pos = 2.875 	neg = 0.125
29. The film will switch                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
30. When we see the TV n                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
31. Or it may be inserte                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
32. NATURAL BORN KILLERS                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
33. (You have to say tha                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
34. Practice it.                        ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0    
35. ).      OK.                         ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.0  
36. So what's the meanin                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
37. That people who grow                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
38. Or (if female) to do                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
39. OK, so let's ignore                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.75 
40. How's about "satire"                ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.0  
41. OK, I guess I can ca                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
42. We're assured by the                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
43. Mickey and Mallory a                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.0

52. (Ollie Stone's not a                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0

55. Jack Scagnetti (Tom                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125

57. Warden Dwight McClus                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.0  
58. (McCluskey might not                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.625
59. ).      Well, if thi                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
60. Except that high-sch                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 1.0  
61. Oliver Stone does no                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
62. This is serious busi                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
63. The promos make it a                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.375
64. All right, let's giv                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
65. He has obviously abs                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
66. Time after time, Mic                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0  
67. But in those flicks,                ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0.5  
68. In NATURAL BORN KILL                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
69. But because of our c                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
70. So, it certainly loo                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.875
71. Then, presumably, wh                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.75 
72. And we'll repent.                   ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0    
73. Doesn't this sound v                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
74. Particularly on film                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
75. Filled with "oh the                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0

77. As I said, *everybod                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125

79. The old soft-core ma                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.5  
80. Don't the tabloid-TV                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0    
81. I think it would be                 ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.5  
82. Unfortunately, thoug                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 1.75 
83. Throughout NATURAL B                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125

87. Virtually all those                 ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.25 
88. Maybe Stone is just                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.625
