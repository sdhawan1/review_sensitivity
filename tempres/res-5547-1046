0. CAPSULE: Entertainin                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.625
1. Expensive, and it sh                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
2. There are so many go                 ... pos = 2.0   	neg = 0.125
3. On the plus side of                  ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.0  
4. On the minus side, a                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
5. A very silly story.                  ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
6. In the abstract, ELE                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
7. It moves fast and al                 ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0.0  
8. But there are limits                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
9. The movie has been (                 ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.25 
10. ELEMENT is mostly a                 ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.75 
11. The mega-cities are                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.25 
12. Maybe that's deliber                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.25 
13. The movie opens at t                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.125
14. Much mystical mumbo-                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
15. Flash-forward to 300                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.125
16. The rest of the plot                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.25 
17. I mentioned that thi                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
18. ELEMENT is only SF b                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.75 
19. But just because it'                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.25 
20. The movie has an inc                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.625
21. Most surprising is M                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
22. She's given the inte                ... pos = 2.875 	neg = 0.0  
23. There is also a touc                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.25 
24. I wish some of this                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.75 
25. Also good is Gary Ol                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.25 
26. ELEMENT is bound to                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.25 
27. It wants to entertai                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.375
28. It succeeds in both                 ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0    
29. Watch it in a theate                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.0  
30. Sometimes, though, I                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.625
