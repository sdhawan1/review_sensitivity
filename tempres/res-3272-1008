26. When I attended film                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.375
27. (It also allowed us                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
28. ) There is a lot of                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
29. It didn't DETRACT, b                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
30. Perhaps if I weren't                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
31. But it is a valid cr                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.25 
32. Also, the movie's se                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.5  
33. This is the adversit                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.125

35. The movie makes the                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.5  
36. Finally, and most im                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.125
37. For example, If you                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
38. Literally.                          ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.0  
39. The real killer is i                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.5  
40. Literally.                          ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.0  
41. These pieces ALMOST                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
42. But the rest of the                 ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.625
43. The story itself, "o                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.25 
44. It sounds timeless a                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
45. But in a specific mo                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.5  
46. That's why I think G                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
47. All the elements tha                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.75 
48. I'm rooting for GATT                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.375
