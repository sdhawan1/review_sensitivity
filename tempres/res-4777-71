1. The first novel by T                 ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.125

3. Of course Grady's li                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
4. Hence the setting in                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0    
5. Unfortunately, the f                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.625
6. I can understand nov                 ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.0  
7. But the ones I've be                 ... pos = 1.681 	neg = 0.5  
8. And in a  forum of o                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0  
9. Still the world of w                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
10. The inbred politics                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125

17. The film's opening a                ... pos = 2.0   	neg = 0.375
18. We hear a good deal                 ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.375
19. And we get a top-not                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
20. Douglas has superior                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
21. His character  opera                ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0.5  
22. (Doesn't this sound                 ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.0  
23. )  Still Douglas doe                ... pos = 3.875 	neg = 0.625
24. He  also looks on as                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.375
25. Finally, he is beset                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.75 
26. Still, we like the g                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.0  
27. Tobey Maguire is at                 ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
