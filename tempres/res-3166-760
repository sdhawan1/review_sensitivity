0. Director: Bob Spiers                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.25 
1. Going into this film                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
2. They just seemed lik                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
3. I was anxious to see                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.625
4. Aside from this, tho                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.25 
5. And now that it's ov                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
6. But I can't.                         ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.0  
7. I'm i...in...fected                  ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
8. No, but seriously, S                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 2.0  
9. Sure, it's really go                 ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 1.125
10. And Bob Hoskins is i                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
11. In theory, that's al                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
12. Naturally, the story                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.375
13. It centers around th                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0  
14. Along the way, there                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 1.25 
15. Spice World, first a                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.125
16. It jumps around from                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
17. Scenes are rapidly t                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.625
18. You'll find yourself                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
19. What is probably the                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 1.0  
20. Everything in this f                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
21. Take, for instance,                 ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
22. I read somewhere tha                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.0  
23. Knowing that the Spi                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
24. The most inherently                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
25. Having seen the film                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
26. The only ones that s                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.375
27. I can see the rest o                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
28. Aside from the film                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.875
29. Some of the sequence                ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0.375
30. Every time Richard E                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
31. I also liked the nig                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.625
32. And the film is so f                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.75 
33. Spice World may be a                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 1.375
