1. "She's All That" has                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.5  
2. And quite frankly, I                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.875
3. (At least, I *hope*                  ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.875

5. That, right there, i                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
6. How many times have                  ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.0  
7. As Cook comments nea                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
8. Of course, had the f                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
9. As it is, though, "S                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.375
10. There's not one orig                ... pos = 1.625 	neg = 0.875
11. The star of the movi                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.75 
12. I usually don't like                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
13. Cook wears the same                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.125
14. I was never convince                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 1.125
15. The movie seems to b                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.5  
16. As for Freddie Prinz                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 1.25 
17. He coasts through th                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.0  
18. Kieren Culkin is her                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
19. And for some indisce                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
20. No explanation is gi                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
21. Were we supposed to                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
22. I don't think so.                   ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.0  
23. That single element                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.5  
24. "She's All That" suc                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
25. That's what it boils                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
26. It's not entertainin                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.0  
27. The hour and a half                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
28. And what's worse, it                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.5  
29. It appears to be tel                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.125
30. That's unimportant.                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0    
31. If you want to *trul                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.375
