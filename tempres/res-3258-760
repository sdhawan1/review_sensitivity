2. Sometimes the storie                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0    
3. Sometimes they're no                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0

9. Others say the speci                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 1.125
10. I simply enjoyed the                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0  
11. Insurrection, which                 ... pos = 1.875 	neg = 0.125
12. Of course, these pea                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
13. The Son'a, who are h                ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0.375
14. That's when Captain                 ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.25 
15. So, with his trusty                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
16. When dealing with a                 ... pos = 1.5   	neg = 0.0

23. If I have any compla                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.5  
24. I don't think it's t                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0
