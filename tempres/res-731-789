0. As you should know,                  ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
1. With a total of 4 de                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
2. With that said, you                  ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.25 
3. The film is based on                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.25 
4. After tarveling for                  ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.75 
5. So, they start picki                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
6. So far it sounds int                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
7. Not when all of this                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
8. After that, they bas                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
9. That alone shows how                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.375
10. Obviously that's not                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
11. Even if you are goin                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.125
12. Since all the action                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 1.25 
13. Can't the camera men                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
14. I'd like to actually                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
15. The film moves on an                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
16. With corny dialogue,                ... pos = 2.25  	neg = 1.75 
17. That's the only thin                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
18. When I heard that Jo                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
19. Well now I know.                    ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
20. Crichton's greed for                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
21. What's there to argu                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
22. The film couldn't be                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.375
23. Seeing films like Th                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
