0. Director: Anand Tuck                 ... pos = 2.125 	neg = 0.25 
1. Because it's not han                 ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.125
2. Underneath the to-di                 ... pos = 2.0   	neg = 0.25 
3. It doesn't merely go                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
4. It goes from charact                 ... pos = 1.75  	neg = 0.0  
5. It obsesses itself w                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0  
6. It's that their rela                 ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0.125
7. In short, this movie                 ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.125
8. It merely tells its                  ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
9. Director Anand Tucke                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
10. He overdramaticizes                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
11. The film tells the s                ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0.0  
12. They are also both m                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.125
13. Jackie, a bit jealou                ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0.0  
14. When they both hit a                ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 1.0  
15. They marry, after a                 ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0.5  
16. She enters into a sh                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.25 
17. It's all terribly me                ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0.25 
18. The key thing here i                ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0.875
19. Their relationship i                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.25 
20. When a young Jackie                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 1.0  
21. When Jackie lands on                ... pos = 2.0   	neg = 0.125
22. And the whole time,                 ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.125
23. Another thing I real                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.25 
24. I usually make it a                 ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.375
25. My reasoning for thi                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
26. The worst case for t                ... pos = 2.125 	neg = 0.875
27. Hell, I could play t                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.5  
28. In that same exact m                ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 1.75 
29. She has to actually                 ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.0  
30. But the Academy of A                ... pos = 2.75  	neg = 0.0  
31. If you don't believe                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.375
32. This isn't so for Wa                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.0  
33. And thanks to the op                ... pos = 1.625 	neg = 1.0  
34. Rachel Griffiths, wh                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.375
35. Griffiths, an otherw                ... pos = 3.25  	neg = 0.5  
36. After all, Griffiths                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.75 
37. She does, and if any                ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0    
38. Together, the two ac                ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0.625
39. If it hadn't been fo                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.5  
40. It's so close to per                ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0.875
41. But, hey, as it is,                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
