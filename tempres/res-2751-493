0. Steve Martin was hil                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
1. Eddie Murphy was hil                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
2. Therefore, we know b                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
3. Yes, I know, I am th                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
4. Anyway, we know thes                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
5. However, it seems th                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
6. For every Dr. Dolitt                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
7. But, Bowfinger is a                  ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
8. It capitalizes on th                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0  
9. Now, most of you hav                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
10. In my opinion, it is                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
11. I gave it four stars                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
12. My review of Bowfing                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
13. Just to reiterate my                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
14. Bowfinger, like The                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
15. It does not need Osc                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.125
16. Now on with my revie                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
17. Bowfinger is hilario                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
18. If you have any idea                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
19. It combines a clever                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.0  
20. No matter what kind                 ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.5  
21. Either way, Bowfinge                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.125
22. Steve Martin wrote t                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
23. He plays Bobby Bowfi                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
24. However, he fails mi                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
25. He thinks he strikes                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
26. Right from the get-g                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
27. It moves on with Bob                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
28. He finds a studio ex                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.375
29. So, Bowfinger tries                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.125
30. But, Bowfinger canno                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
31. What is his plan?                   ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.125
32. To get his actors to                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
33. Let's just say comed                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
34. Steve Martin is grea                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
35. Not only does he moc                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.375
36. This makes it a uniq                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.25 
37. Eddie Murphy is back                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
38. He does double duty                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.375
39. He plays both roles                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
40. Kit Ramsey is a blac                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.375
41. Jiff, on the other h                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.875
42. Murphy plays both ro                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
43. His Jiff character f                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.375
44. This film probably w                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
45. We believe that Murp                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.0  
46. The supporting cast                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
47. They do not get in t                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.625
48. Christine Baranski p                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
49. Jamie Kennedy plays                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
50. He does not go over                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
51. The only member of t                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
52. She starts off as a                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.625
53. " once she gets off                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.625
54. But, she then become                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.25 
55. The transition is ha                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.125
56. Overall, Bowfinger i                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
57. Besides, Austin Powe                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
58. It is witty, clever                 ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0.125
59. It does not rely on                 ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.5  
60. And it is aided by t                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
61. You will not see Mur                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.0  
62. Four Stars out of Fo                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0
