51. " commercials that p                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.0  
52. So that adds up to a                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.875
53. I'm totally confused                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0  
54. But I do admit it.                  ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
55. So, if you're willin                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.0  
56. I don't know how any                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.0  
57. Feel free to give it                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
58. Of course, in the in                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0

61. Though opinion on ST                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.25 
62. This is possibly the                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
63. If you really want t                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
64. Please, avoid this..                ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.0
