1. As time moves forwar                 ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.25 
2. Also as sequels are                  ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.0  
3. This being yet anoth                 ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 1.0  
4. Since it is obvious                  ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.375
5. From the beginning B                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.75 
6. Since both the basic                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 1.125
7. Let there be Bond mo                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
8. Simply because the c                 ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.25 
9. It is obvious that B                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.375
10. For example: Enter,                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
11. This is a fairly ori                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.25 
12. Bond, well at least                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
13. This idea is not pla                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 1.25 
14. Wai Lin, played by M                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.25 
15. But is only there it                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.5  
16. Michelle Yeoh, seems                ... pos = 3.25  	neg = 1.25 
17. As Bond, Pierce Bros                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.25 
18. He is everything he                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 1.0  
19. Yes, Bond actually c                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
20. Just makes you teary                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.375
21. Strangely enough tha                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.625
22. Pulled out of a love                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.0  
23. Yeah, so?                           ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.0  
24. He's not supposed to                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
25. It's also not someth                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.0  
26. One liner's abound w                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.25 
27. Now no formula is co                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 2.375
28. The idea behind the                 ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 1.0  
29. But the character is                ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0.25 
30. The bad guy is sinis                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.75 
31. Just because the 'Bo                ... pos = 1.5   	neg = 2.25 
32. There just doesn't s                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.75 
33. Now, no Bond movie i                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
34. Well, this movie has                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
35. Fair enough not to b                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
36. One thing that strik                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 1.25 
37. The whole build up s                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.125
38. Especially since the                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
39. Other than that, the                ... pos = 1.5   	neg = 0.25 
40. The action is where                 ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.75 
41. But then when viewin                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.125
42. The story is there,                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
43. The character is the                ... pos = 1.75  	neg = 0.125
44. Finally, the action                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
45. All in all, this mov                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.625
46. It is a Bond movie,                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.5  
47. It had the potential                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
48. In the end, it's a d                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.0
