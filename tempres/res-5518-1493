2. The protagonist, Chr                 ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0.375
3. This time, in what s                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.5  
4. But the film is not                  ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0.125
5. Although Chris and h                 ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0.0  
6. This sends Annie int                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
7. The rest of the film                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
8. Personally, Chris en                 ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0.125
9. As he learns more, i                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.5  
10. In other words, it's                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.25 
11. Glad to know I have                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
12. Along for the ride i                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
13. More or less, he exp                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0  
14. And while he hangs w                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 1.0  
15. Although Chris is ab                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
16. By the mid-point, sh                ... pos = 2.375 	neg = 0.625
17. Chris ends up decidi                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.75 
18. This may sound like                 ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.375
19. Visually, "What Drea                ... pos = 1.875 	neg = 1.375
20. The image of Chris'                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
21. Hell is equally mage                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 2.0  
22. This is all well and                ... pos = 2.0   	neg = 0.25 
23. The film, though obv                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.0  
24. Each large sequence                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.25 
25. This makes for a fil                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.125
26. Unfortunately, "What                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 1.0  
27. While some of this i                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 1.375
28. The point of this fi                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.375
29. ), but to really tak                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.0  
30. I will say that it d                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.25 
31. For most of the film                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 1.0  
32. In the early scenes,                ... pos = 1.5   	neg = 0.25 
33. And when Chris annou                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.5  
34. In the finale, it do                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.5  
35. With Chris seeing An                ... pos = 1.625 	neg = 0.875
36. It's not your fault.                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
37. It's not you fault,"                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
38. etc.                                ... pos = 0     	neg = 0    
39. etc.).                              ... pos = 0     	neg = 0    
40. It's as if it pulls                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
41. Nevertheless, "What                 ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.125
42. Its power is that it                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.25 
43. Maybe it's because o                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
