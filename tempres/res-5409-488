0. Starring Keanu Reeve                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.25 
1. So I have tried to b                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.75 
2. I watched The Matrix                 ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.125
3. Under no circumstanc                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.625
4. This theater, owned                  ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
5. The mono sound that                  ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
6. In other words, the                  ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
7. As someone used to d                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 1.0  
8. I'm not even going t                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.625
9. There, I've had my r                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0  
10. Which sadly won't in                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.75 
11. My guess on the soun                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
12. It is nothing short                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.375
13. Sadly, the rest of t                ... pos = 1.875 	neg = 1.625
14. The Matrix has at it                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.5  
15. Keanu Reeves plays a                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.25 
16. It turns out that th                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.625
17. Now machines run the                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
18. The computers are ge                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.25 
19. The population of th                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
20. That is except a sma                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.75 
21. They now spend their                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
22. Reeve's character, N                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.125
23. Newcomer Carrie-Anne                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
24. The action sequences                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.25 
25. This can be attribut                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.375
26. This lends itself to                ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0.0  
27. When you add this to                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.625
28. As I already said, t                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
29. Acting in The Matrix                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 1.0  
30. Keanu Reeves gives h                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.0  
31. Although to his cred                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
32. Laurence Fishburne o                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.25 
33. More than a few time                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
34. Joe Pantoliano was a                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
35. Carrie-Anne Moss tur                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.0  
36. It's nice to see tha                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.625
37. You have to give all                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.0  
38. It was clear that no                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.375
39. I also put much of t                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 1.25 
40. In more than a few p                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.375
41. It almost seems as t                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.75 
42. So they decided to m                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
43. Thereby covering up                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
44. My other major compl                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
45. The setup for it was                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.0  
46. The ending itself wa                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
47. The main reasons to                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0  
48. While the rest of th                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.25
