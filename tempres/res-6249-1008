18. Long takes with a st                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.375
19. In fact, one of the                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.5  
20. After quite a while,                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
21. She was framed out o                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
22. It was a clever way                 ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.75 
23. Toward the end, a cr                ... pos = 1.875 	neg = 0.125
24. It was a nice little                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.375
25. Since it is critical                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.25
