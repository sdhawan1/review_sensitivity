2. The crew who sometim                 ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 1.375
3. During one point nea                 ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.0  
4. My mind drifted away                 ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.75 
5. U-571 takes some sim                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
6. At times this makes                  ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.0  
7. At other times it's                  ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.875
8. An American group of                 ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.0  
9. The group kills most                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.0  
10. This forces the  Ame                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
11. The crew, which incl                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.0  
12. There is a lot to li                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
13. Some action sequence                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0  
14. One particular scene                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.375
15. The sound is also  a                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
16. Remarkable care to t                ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0.0  
17. The sound really tes                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
18. Walking out of the                  ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.0  
19. I could still hear!                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
20. Another nice thing a                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.25 
21. Instead of  conversi                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
22. These people are act                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
23. This is quite a surp                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
24. The problem with U-5                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.5  
25. The lead characters                 ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.625
26. I don't need to see                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
27. It's hard to look at                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 1.25 
28. The crew (which also                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.375
29. U-571 is also under                 ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.125
30. In reality, the Brit                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.0  
31. Some WWII veterans h                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
32. " The ending of the                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.625
33. It was  just too unb                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
34. U-571 can't decide w                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.25 
35. Too many elements we                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.75 
36. This submarine sinks                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0
