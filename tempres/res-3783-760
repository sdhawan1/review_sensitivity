2. I think he is intens                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
3. I watch him jitter a                 ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.25 
4. It doesn't take me l                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
5. That's usually what                  ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
6. Maybe the character                  ... pos = 2.875 	neg = 0.0

8. I, for one, do not--                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
9. But I know that this                 ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.25 
10. But like most of his                ... pos = 2.0   	neg = 0.125
11. What this film seems                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.917
12. It's about Harry Blo                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.25 
13. He's just written a                 ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.0  
14. He's never allowed t                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.375
15. On top of all this,                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
16. The film is kind of                 ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.25 
17. It leads to a situat                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0  
18. Like all of Allen's                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
19. It's nearly distract                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
20. Most of the women tu                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.0  
21. If you're familiar w                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
22. This one, however, s                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
23. Because of the natur                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
24. He remembers one of                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0  
25. Another story he rem                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.75 
26. Throughout the film,                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.25 
27. If my explanation of                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 1.25 
28. I didn't put the pie                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0  
29. It's really not that                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.75 
30. The flashbacks sure                 ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.0  
31. Towards the end, he                 ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.125

35. And if you know Alle                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
36. As for me, it proved                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
