22. The first is where M                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
23. For example, they br                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.0  
24. One should never "cr                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.375
25. But in two places, t                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
26. The effect is disori                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.5  
27. The second is in the                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
28. Mann and editor Will                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0
