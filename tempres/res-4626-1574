54. Like that film, NATU                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
55. This basic message i                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.375
56. Unfortunately, the f                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.125
57. As a result, many ma                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
58. On the other hand, s                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
59. I suspect that many                 ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.625
