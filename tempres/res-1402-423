1. After all, it does n                 ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0.0  
2. But then you have a                  ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
3. Consider the premise                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
4. You have a sullen co                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.25 
5. He plays with it  an                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
6. Here is the catch: J                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
7. So it is John in 199                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.25 
8. How can this be?                     ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.125
9. Can it be the strang                 ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.75 
10. Or, to be more radic                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.375
11. Nevertheless, we are                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.0  
12. Can John prevent his                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
13. And wouldn't that ru                ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.375
14. I am willing to susp                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 1.25 
15. Though the story is                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.25 
16. Would that not be ch                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.375
17. And how can John onl                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
18. Why should that matt                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
19. And if everything ca                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
20. Just a matter of  lo                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
21. Stephen Hawking woul                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
22. All paradoxes aside,                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.375
23. Simply put, there is                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.375
24. And frankly all the                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 1.0  
25. Added to that is the                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.375
26. A little nod to "It'                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.625
27. If nothing else, it                 ... pos = 2.625 	neg = 0.375
28. " He is often like a                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25
