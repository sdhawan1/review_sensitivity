0. IN SHORT: a passable                 ... pos = 2.125 	neg = 0.75 
1. Perhaps in uncoverin                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
2. God knows it would m                 ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.0  
3. Rob runs a failing u                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
4. The man dumps his pr                 ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 1.25 
5. Either way, you'll h                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.375
6. At least Rob is self                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.25 
7. That's not the case                  ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.25 
8. The record store its                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
9. Indeed, most of the                  ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0  
10. Much meeker, but sti                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
11. The part-time pair,                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.875
12. (Kinda like Cranky i                ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0.0  
13. At least this pair h                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
14. Said course will int                ... pos = 1.625 	neg = 0.5  
15. We never see the adu                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
16. There was Penny (Joe                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
17. Ah, the humiliation                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0    
18. .                                   ... pos = 0     	neg = 0    
19. .                                   ... pos = 0     	neg = 0    
20. but it's nothing nex                ... pos = 1.75  	neg = 0.25 
21. Finally there is Sar                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.25 
22. So .                                ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.0  
23. .. it's better to sl                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
24. Chicago winters bein                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.625
25. That brings us back                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
26. If anything, Rob's t                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.625
27. As rough as the brea                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
28. They don't settle ou                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
29. Rob at all times loo                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.375
30. Cranky settled for t                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.125
31. On average, a first                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
32. Were Cranky able to                 ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.375
33. For the rest of us,                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
