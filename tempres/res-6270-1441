1. 2) The scene that mo                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 1.625
2. He walks onto 57th S                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
3. 57th Street is empty                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
4. My reaction: "Damn,                  ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.25 
5. ". All in all, not a                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.875
6. The basic plot is th                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
7. He's treated like a                  ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
8. There's the fab apar                 ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 1.0  
9. He's assigned a big                  ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
10. He's able to get an                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.625
11. During the course of                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
12. Weird dreams ensue,                 ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.0  
13. I actually liked thi                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
14. The previews and the                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.625
15. I also have a large                 ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.125
16. I suppose this was t                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
17. I watch "Buffy The V                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
18. I suppose I can only                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.25 
19. One very nice touch:                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.75 
20. They bargain for his                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
21. This, I suppose, is                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.875
22. Keanu, of course, ac                ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.0  
23. (This may be one fla                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
24. Keanu doesn't really                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
25. ). Actually, in a fu                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0  
26. One of them extended                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.375
27. "  If I recall, the                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.5  
28. I'd like to read a s                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0  
29. At the end, Al Pacin                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
30. One can read the sin                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.625
