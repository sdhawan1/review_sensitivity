0. Review by Lars Linda                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
1. DeVincentis, Steve P                 ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.5  
2. Either way, it's bee                 ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.875
3. Why is this?                         ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.125
4. Maybe because you kn                 ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 1.0  
5. Director Stephen Fre                 ... pos = 2.0   	neg = 0.375
6. When watching High F                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0  
7. I laughed at Dick (T                 ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.375
8. I laughed at the Joh                 ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 1.25 
9. And I laughed at Rob                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
10. Rob is the character                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.5  
11. He uncontrollably ch                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
12. And like his other m                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 1.0  
13. He spends the aftern                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.0  
14. Whatever human emoti                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.0  
15. Rob has built an ext                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
16. During this confused                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.625
17. But these aren't any                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
18. The plot in three wo                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
19. The approach directo                ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0.125
20. It gives High Fideli                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.0  
21. It also helps open t                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.375
22. Jack Black steals th                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.75 
23. Just listening to hi                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0  
24. What Frears does so                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.75 
25. John Cusack plays hi                ... pos = 2.625 	neg = 0.125
26. Now instead of Rob j                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.625
27. The only problem wit                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.375
28. Instead the movie go                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.75 
29. Also Bruce Springste                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.0  
30. High Fidelity is a c                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.125
31. I just hope Hollywoo                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.75
