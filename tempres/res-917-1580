10. Unfortunately, these                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.125
11. For example, the rea                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.25 
12. From there unfortuna                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 1.5  
13. In addition, for all                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.5  
14. Furthermore, the mov                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.25

18. This is sad consider                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 1.0
