1. But these aren't the                 ... pos = 4.5   	neg = 1.375
2. It suffers from a te                 ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.25 
3. As a whole, the film                 ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.5  
4. This is a positive a                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.25 
5. I'll elaborate on al                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
6. The film stars Robin                 ... pos = 1.5   	neg = 0.0  
7. They get married and                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
8. The family is shatte                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
9. The film then jumps                  ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.5  
10. Chris suddenly finds                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
11. His status is explai                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
12. Soon, Chris allows h                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.25 
13. Soon, however, it tu                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.75 
14. I've left a lot out,                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
15. Because it deals wit                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.125
16. There's always an un                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.375
17. The biggest problem                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.5  
18. This isn't Ward's fa                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.125
19. The way the film is                 ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.125
20. I don't mind that th                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.125
21. Then, all the way up                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
22. The result is a stor                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.375
23. And, if you stop and                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
24. Ron Bass' script isn                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.0  
25. But, on a technical                 ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.375
26. In addition, the fil                ... pos = 2.0   	neg = 0.25 
27. Okay, so it has some                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
28. Overall, though, Wha                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.125
29. Vincent Ward is a tr                ... pos = 2.375 	neg = 0.75 
30. There are little thi                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.625
31. It's the kind of ima                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0  
32. The acting is superb                ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0.375
33. Gooding, Jr. is a de                ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0.25

36. Sciorra's work is co                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.25 
37. As flawed as it is,                 ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.25 
38. True, it could have                 ... pos = 2.0   	neg = 1.125
