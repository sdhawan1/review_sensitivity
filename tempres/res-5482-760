1. "  I never really kn                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
2. Now that I've seen U                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0    
3. Marshals, I think I                  ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0  
4. I can't fathom why t                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.5  
5. This is a long film,                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.75 
6. There are a lot of c                 ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.125
7. On top of all this,                  ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
8. Marshals is basicall                 ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 1.0  
9. ".         One of th                 ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.125
10. He is a tow truck dr                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
11. Later, he is arreste                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
12. So, he gets stuck on                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
13. Conveniently, U.S.                  ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
14. Marshal Sam Gerard (                ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0.25

17. Gerard is allowed to                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
18. "  This is about thi                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
19. Sequences shortly af                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
20. We learn of new char                ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0    
21. Robert Downey, Jr. p                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
22. This leads to an inv                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
23. Oh, and let's not fo                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
24. Marshals, for whom t                ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0.375
25. Sheridan has a girlf                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
26. Marie is played by t                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.125

28. U.S.                                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0    
29. Marshals didn't stri                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
30. The story is silly a                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.5  
31. It's not even very p                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.0  
32. Not only that, but t                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.125
33. The action sequences                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.0  
34. I liked the scenes t                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.125
35. I also liked the act                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0

40. He played a nice, no                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
41. We really wanted to                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
42. But Sheridan is a sp                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.875
43. And, by the end of t                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.0  
44. This isn't a terribl                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 1.403
45. As a strict action f                ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0.0  
46. But what about the s                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
47. What about the invol                ... pos = 1.5   	neg = 0.0
