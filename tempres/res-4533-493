2. They have things lik                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
3. But, the one I alway                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.25

7. Unfortunately, I can                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 1.25 
8. That title would be                  ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.625
9. Ok, that is a pretty                 ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 1.125

25. Despite the dry dial                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.875
26. Owen Wilson, who pla                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.125
27. He is basically ther                ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0.25 
28. All of the character                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.125

33. The plot is terrible                ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.75 
34. The opening scene of                ... pos = 1.5   	neg = 0.375

36. Nell, Lili Taylor's                 ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.0  
37. It makes no sense an                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.625
38. He forces the viewer                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0  
39. For instance, the be                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
40. But, we get zilch fo                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
41. Plus, two of them ge                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
42. And the worst part:                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.875
43. For some reason, the                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.625
44. No reason whatsoever                ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.875
