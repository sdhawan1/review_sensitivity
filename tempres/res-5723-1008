0. **1/2 (out of 4) As                  ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 1.375
1. You'd think a movie                  ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
2. But OFFICE SPACE giv                 ... pos = 1.875 	neg = 0.0  
3. Instead of going for                 ... pos = 1.5   	neg = 0.25 
4. For example, Peter (                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
5. All the professional                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
6. As naƒève and whiteb                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0    
7. Their detached, mono                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.375
8. Then again, some of                  ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.375
9. The movie seems like                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
10. (Jennifer Aniston is                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.125
11. ) But eventually, on                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
12. Ironically, his new                 ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 1.125
13. Peter has not forgot                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
14. If Mike Judge had mo                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.0  
15. They could have been                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
16. Wouldn't that be a g                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.125
17. But it quickly becom                ... pos = 1.75  	neg = 0.75 
18. They fit the sitcom-                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
19. You can deduce, even                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.375
20. OFFICE SPACE has the                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.375
21. Combined with the mo                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 1.0  
22. But luckily for Judg                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
23. Not always, but ofte                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0
