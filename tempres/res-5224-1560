0. Urban Legend (1998)                  ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 1.0  
1. Based on the last fe                 ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 1.125
2. Thankfully, Legend r                 ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0.75 
3. You're all familiar                  ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.625
4. However, just becaus                 ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
5. It was, believe it o                 ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.125
6. The thing is, I'm no                 ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.125
7. Maybe it was the abo                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.625
8. Or, it could have be                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
9. More likely, though,                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
10. I don't think I need                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 1.0  
11. Urban Legend begins                 ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.0  
12. A pretty young coed                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
13. ) a gas problem (hee                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
14. One problem, though.                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
15. Would you want to st                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
16. I thought not.                      ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
17. Predictably, the att                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.375
18. It's odd, though, wh                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.625
19. Naturally, the poten                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.625
20. And the when we leas                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
21. A decapitation.                     ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0    
22. It turns out that th                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.75 
23. So who is it this ti                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
24. The obvious candidat                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
25. A-ha.                               ... pos = 0     	neg = 0    
26. Or could it be the f                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
27. Like all movies of t                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.625
28. And it turns out to                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.625
29. I'm not going to pre                ... pos = 1.5   	neg = 0.625
30. And this flick defin                ... pos = 2.375 	neg = 0.125
31. *Complimentary movie                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.0
