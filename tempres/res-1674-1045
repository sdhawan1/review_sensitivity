1. This is the time whe                 ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.125
2. Like any good group                  ... pos = 1.625 	neg = 1.0  
3. Want to see the Whit                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125

7. (Although God knows                  ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.75 
8. ). But it's one thin                 ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.125
9. Snappy computer grap                 ... pos = 2.25  	neg = 0.0  
10. Somewhere right in t                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.75 
11. The graphics quality                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.25 
12. Deep Impact takes th                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.625
13. While other movies h                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.25 
14. While it's possible                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 1.25 
15. The problem with Dee                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.25 
16. The moments and the                 ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.5  
17. The problem is that                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 1.0  
18. (Any other similarit                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.625
19. )  And by picking a                 ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
20. It doesn't really he                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
21. (It certainly doesn'                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
22. )  Most notably, you                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 1.0  
23. Throw in Bruce Weitz                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
24. The two leads are, t                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0    
25. Unfortunately -- and                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 1.625
26. Freeman is the Presi                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
27. He is the oracle, th                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
28. Which is fine, and h                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
29. On the other hand, D                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.25 
30. Yes!                                ... pos = 0     	neg = 0    
31. Supercool, lollygagg                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.25 
32. I suppose parts like                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.5  
33. The one thing I took                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
34. Whenever the camera                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.625
35. (Never mind that rea                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
36. )  Despite the movie                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.0
