1. US Distribution:  D                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
2. I've seen some good                  ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0.125
3. I figured that this                  ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
4. In addition, the fil                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
5. But, for all of its                  ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.125
6. I have an entomologi                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
7. I know, I know, I co                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
8. I'm not so intereste                 ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.5  
9. It would have been r                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.25 
10. Well, I realize I'm                 ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.625
11. Don't get me wrong -                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.75 
12. Woody Allen voices t                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.0  
13. Z is Woody Allen --                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.5  
14. Z is upset that he's                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
15. She's engaged to Gen                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
16. However, his friend                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.375
17. So, Z takes Weaver's                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
18. By a stroke of luck,                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
19. Soon, however, Mandi                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.375
20. Soon, Z becomes a sy                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
21. If that sounds like                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
22. That's one of the ni                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 1.125
23. In fact, the film is                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.5  
24. On this level, howev                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
25. First of all, the la                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
26. In addition, the vio                ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0.25 
27. But I can't deny the                ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0.0  
28. There are some terri                ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0.5  
29. The film gets off to                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.75 
30. In the main roles, A                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.375
31. Hackman is perfect f                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 1.0  
32. I'm quite aware that                ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0.125
33. After all, I liked t                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
34. But it left me feeli                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
35. I'm not sure what I                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.5  
36. If this concept does                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.25
