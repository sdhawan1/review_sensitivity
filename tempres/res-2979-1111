0. Cast: David Duchovny                 ... pos = 2.5   	neg = 0.25 
1. But the question eve                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
2. The answer, not surp                 ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.25 
3. In terms of budget,                  ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.375
4. But strangely, it fe                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.5  
5. But, like always, cr                 ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.625
6. After all, what woul                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
7. Capping off where th                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 1.25 
8. It appears as if two                 ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 1.25 
9. Thus a new conspirac                 ... pos = 1.75  	neg = 0.125
10. Oh yeah, and The Tru                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
11. I guess it goes with                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.125
12. But, it isn't just a                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0.125
13. However, the more de                ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0.25 
14. Rob Bowman (who has                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0  
15. He follows the scree                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.0  
16. Along with Mike Oldf                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
17. For a movie that isn                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
18. Perhaps it is becaus                ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.5  
19. Should there will be                ... pos = 2.125 	neg = 0.375
20. Maybe then we would                 ... pos = 1.875 	neg = 0.125
