1. ) STAR WARS movie is                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.5

16. Its digital world -                 ... pos = 1.875 	neg = 0.625
17. They will  also comp                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.625
18. They will object on                 ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.625
19. The critics  have be                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.125
20. George Lucas  copped                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.875
21. The irony is that th                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.25 
22. But wait a minute.                  ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
23. TITANIC was based on                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
24. STAR WARS, on the ot                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
25. It never happened.                  ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0    
26. It's meaningless.                   ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.375
27. Therefore it is just                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
28. Furthermore, by  pur                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.5  
29. The  universe is exp                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.5
