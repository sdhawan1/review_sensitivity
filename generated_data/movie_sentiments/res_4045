1. If you haven't heard                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.625
2. First thing's first                 ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
3. Well, yesand no.                   ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
4. It's a good film, an                 ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.25 
5. When I saw the first                 ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 1.375
6. I mean, what's happe                 ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.0  
7. Gads, whatever next,                 ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.0  
8. I was not entirely f                 ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0.125
9. It's when it came ou                 ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.25 
10. I didn't see the fil                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
11. ), so I went with a                 ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.0  
12. Did I?                              ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.0  
13. Yes and no.                         ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.25 
14. Mainly yes, I'm happ                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.0

18. Well, it's an often                 ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.0  
19. Does it work here?                  ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
20. In script form it do                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125

26. It's engaging, touch                ... pos = 1.125 	neg = 0    
27. There's more than a                 ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.125
28. Which leads us to th                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
29. We all knew it was c                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
30. I'm sure director Ca                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.375
31. I think that underst                ... pos = 1.625 	neg = 0.0  
32. The iceberg arrives,                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.0  
33. And it is an hour.                  ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
34. My goodness, we don'                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.0  
35. Well, perhaps not by                ... pos = 0.25  	neg = 0.75 
36. But I certainly wasn                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.125
37. Not that I'd expect                 ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.125
38. Is it overdone?                     ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.25 
39. I thought so.                       ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.0  
40. Understatement can s                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.0  
41. No, no one expected                 ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0.875
42. Still, whether it wa                ... pos = 0.375 	neg = 0.625
43. You really couldn't                 ... pos = 1.375 	neg = 0.625
44. Perhaps the most har                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
45. The bit where Rose l                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.375
46. I loved the ending,                 ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.125
47. So, we've establishe                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.25 
48. Haven't mentioned th                ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.0  
49. Plot-wise it's OK, t                ... pos = 1.0   	neg = 0.125
50. As for the dialogue                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
51. It's a period drama.                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0    
52. But I saw very littl                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.375
53. Did they really use                 ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
54. " back in the turn o                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0    
55. I doubt it.                         ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
56. Would someone talk l                ... pos = 0.625 	neg = 0.0  
57. I doubt it.                         ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
58. Is such dialogue as                 ... pos = 0.5   	neg = 0.125
59. Yes it is.                          ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.125
60. A little more attent                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.875
61. Stick with directing                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0  
62. But its more than re                ... pos = 1.25  	neg = 0.0  
63. Star of the show was                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
64. After all, they were                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.25 
65. Directing-wise Camer                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0    
66. Like I said, his vis                ... pos = 0.125 	neg = 0.125
67. I haven't even menti                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.0  
68. Utterly heavenly, th                ... pos = 0.0   	neg = 0.0

73. It was deserving in                 ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.125
74. Last question; is it                ... pos = 0.75  	neg = 0.125
75. Nope, I don't think                 ... pos = 0     	neg = 0.0  
76. It's certainly one o                ... pos = 0.875 	neg = 0.0
