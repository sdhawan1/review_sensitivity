Susan Granger's review of "THE GLASS HOUSE" (Columbia Pictures)
Actor Stellan Skarsgard single-handedly makes this sinister thriller more
effective than you might expect. When the parents of 16 year-old  Ruby Baker
(Leelee Sobieski) and her 11 year-old  brother Rhett (Trevor Morgan) are killed
in a car crash, they're placed in the custody of their parents' best friends and
former neighbors, Erin and Terry Glass (Diane Lane, Stellan Skarsgard). The
Glasses'  lavish, contemporary, gated glass house in Malibu offers a
sun-drenched California distraction, complete with trendy clothes,
state-of-the-art TV and video games. Squabbling Ruby and Rhett must share a
bedroom, temporarily, but the estate lawyer (Bruce Dern) assures them that
there's $4 million to insure their comfortable future. If they have a future,
that is, since Ruby begins to suspect that the Glasses may not be the ideal
guardians they seem to be. Erin, a doctor specializing in pain-management, is a
moody drug addict, while Terry is heavily in debt to loan sharks. Working from
Wesley Strick's hackneyed script, television director Daniel Sackheim ("Law and
Order," "The X-Files") propels the creepy melodrama, unnecessarily underscoring
the malevolence, aided by production designer Jon Gary Steele and
cinematographer Alar Kivilo, who drenches the screen with cold, watery blue
imagery. There's one almost-surreal, amusing moment when a group of Valley teens
emerge from a showing of "Prom Nightmare," and one notes, "That actress was no
Meryl Streep." "Who's Meryl Streep?" another asks. "She's like Katie Holmes to
our parents" is the reply. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The Glass
House" is a scary 6 - at least until the final transparent moments when it
shatters into a formulaic teenage horror flick.

People who live in glass houses... better not have much to hide. 
Because sooner or later, you'll get caught with your pants down, leaving
everything hanging out for everyone to see.
The Glass House stars everyone's favorite Helen Hunt clone, Leelee
Sobieski, as half of a sister-brother duo who move in with family
friends after the untimely deaths of their parents.  Little does she
know that her new guardian's motives are less than altruistic and it's
up to her to protect herself and her brother.
Few would classify Sobieski as a big movie opener, but she, much like
several other actors her age, has slowly been building her career with
notable roles in notable movies, and her burgeoning confidence shows
here.
There is little to fault in The Glass House as a whole.  Competently put
together, smartly acted, The Glass House is a continual slow build
toward revelation and resolution.  I for one was totally hooked, until
the final few moments, when after bursts of shock and terror, The Glass
House shatters into a thousand pieces.  Suddenly, the film casts off its
smart, suspenseful garb and trades that in for a final few moments of
homage to cheap slasher flicks and Hollywood murder clichés.
Even with its unworthy ending, The Glass House is a wholly entertaining
and thoughtful flick.  If nothing else, it scores points by avoiding the
ridiculous teen angst so often seen in other films with young casts. 
Instead, Glass House chooses to use the realities of a parental death
and its effect on children as a springboard to disturbing and dangerous
possibilities.
Without a more intelligent ending befitting its finely crafted build-up,
The Glass House dodges the realm of Hitchcockian excitement.  But even
without a proper resolution to bring things home, director Daniel
Sackheim doesn't get caught with his pants down in his feature film
debut.

PLOT:
A brother and sister are orphaned after their parents die in a car crash and
they're left under the guardianship of some close family friends who live in a
glass house (and yeah, their last name is also Glass- corny but true). At first,
things are kosher but it isn't long before the older sister begins to suspect
her guardians of hiding something and becomes quite paranoid. The question is:
does she have the right to be suspicious or is she losing it herself?
CRITIQUE:
Cheap thrills, solid performances and an obvious plotline for anyone who's seen
the trailer make for a decent "old-school" thriller in the tradition of the HAND
THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE and UNLAWFUL ENTRY. Remember those movies in which a
character(s) acts all "nice" at first, but then slowly but surely, begins to
show their true (usually psychotic) colors? Well, here's a flick that follows
those exact footsteps with a couple of nice neighbors taking guardianship of two
kids whose parents die in a car accident. Of course, it isn't long before one of
the kids starts to suspect the guardians of hiding some nastiness about
themselves and lots of sneaky behavior, mysterious late night eavesdroppings and
creepy shots of the guardian "dad" checking out the new young girl in his house,
ensue. But what takes this film above the generic mode in which most of its
script is based, are the performances given here by its three main stars. Leelee
Sobieski is really good here as the confused orphan with a sad heart but sharp
instinct. Diane Lane is also solid as the guardian-ess, with some background
given on her character, to explain some of her kookier behavior.
But the star of this show is definitely Stellan Skarsgard and his consistent
habit of drinking in every other scene (if you've seen TIME CODE, you remember
the great job he did in that film as "the drunk guy") and his capacity to creep
you out, make you laugh and have you wondering about his motives every now and
then. Of course, it becomes pretty obvious at some point as to why he's doing
what he's doing, but Skarsgard is a blast to watch as he walks around in the
shadows of his own glass house with an iced glass of whisky in one hand and a
hazy look across his face. This movie is basically a guilty pleasure. I think
that most anyone could plug some holes into its plot (although I didn't spot any
major ones myself) and certainly fault its "been-there-done-that" nature, but I
enjoyed most of it, laughed at a few scenes (not sure if I was supposed to be
laughing though), dipped into its few cheap thrills (both suspense-based and
Sobieski in a bikini- holy cans, Batman!) and appreciated its somewhat original
ending (the thing about the car, etc...). I did however find certain lags in the
film and felt that it ran a little too long for its own good but can see great
potential for it on the video circuit. Add to that, a solid score and some cool
directing choices, and this film's obvious plotline and cheap thrills can easily
equate a "good time" for most anyone looking for diversion in their choice of
movies.

_The_Glass_House_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
        Even if the trailer didn't give away darn near every turn of its plot,
one would still have had an easy time predicting the course of events in
_The_Glass_House_.  A formulaic film that is more typical than terrible,
_The_Glass_House_ still makes for frustrating viewing, given the level of talent
involved.
        Topping that list is Leelee Sobieski, whose natural poise lends the
preposterous proceedings a certain level of credibility.  Her Ruby Baker is
introduced as a rebellious high schooler, but she quickly becomes more
well-behaved when her and her younger brother Rhett's (Trevor Morgan) parents
are killed in a mysterious auto accident.  Ruby and Rhett are then put in the
care of wealthy family friends Terry (Stellan Skarsgĺrd) and Erin (Diane Lane)
Glass, who not only live in a large hilltop home made of (yes) glass, one of
their cars has the license plate "24KGLSS."  With all the heavy-handed
symbolism, could it be possible that this newly formed household could be in
danger of being shattered by a stone?
        But of course, and after Ruby rather conveniently happens upon some
suspicious conversations involving Terry, she finds out that her new guardians
don't have the most crystal clear of intentions.  Director Daniel Sackheim, who
cut his helming teeth on numerous episodes of _The_X-Files_, somehow manages to
generate an air of suspense even if he sometimes too easily falls in the trap of
dropping shady "hints" with all the subtlety and grace of a trowel.  Ultimately,
Sackheim and his able cast cannot overcome the increasingly overdone twists of
Wesley Strick's script (based on his output since, one wonders just how much of
the gripping 1991 _Cape_Fear_ remake was his doing and not director Martin
Scorsese's).  Did an unexceptional, unsurprising thriller need to morph into
another one of those films with a villain that just won't die?
        Then again, that's just another example of how by-the-numbers and
off-the-rack _The_Glass_House_ is.  Sobieski does intermittently rise above the
occasion, doing what she can with the film's only halfway-realistic role; some
usually reliable co-stars fare less well: Skarsgĺrd gives in to the histrionics
of the script too easily while Lane is stymied by a role that's a nonentity on
the page.  Perhaps Lane's part is most reflective of the whole of the film:
neither here nor there, and easily forgotten.

THE GLASS HOUSE is an entertaining thriller that almost works.  Using a
predictable script by Wesley Strick (THE SAINT), long-time television director
Daniel Sackheim brings a strong sense of visual style and foreboding.  The
formulaic film is shot in the cool blue tones that are all the rage today in
movie mysteries.
"The simplest thing is the hardest to see," Mrs. Baker (Rita Wilson) advises her
daughter Ruby (Leelee Sobieski).  Although she is talking about Ruby's
sketching, this advice obviously is meant for the audience.  The problem with
the script is that most of the plot "twists" are both simple and easy to spot. 
When the writer worries that things aren't completely obvious, he inserts the
visual equivalent of exclamation points to make sure we understand.  One
character punctures all the tires on a car.  Although it is clear who did it and
why, the writer has to have her come out and stand by the car.  And just in case
we still don't get it, he has her drop a hidden knife on the ground with a loud
crash.
Ruby is a mildly rebellious 16-year-old girl.  She can barely tolerate her
11-year-old, video game playing brother, Rhett (Trevor Morgan).  She claims that
the only thing they share are "common genes."
The kids' world is quickly shattered when their parents die in a car accident. 
They go to live with their long-time friends and ex-neighbors, the Glass family,
Terry and Erin (Diane Lane and Stellan Skarsgĺrd).  The Glasses live in -- yes,
you guessed it -- a big, glass house.  Even the car dealership that Terry owns
is made with the same modernistic glass-and-steel construction.  When he gets
angry, Terry likes to break glasses.  Thankfully, the glass metaphor ends there.
 When the killers look for murder weapons, they don't go for slivers of glass.
The squabbling siblings are the most believable part of the picture.  When their
new guardians force the two kids to share the same bedroom in the Glass's
monster-sized house, Ruby lays down the law to Rhett.  If he dares even glance
at her while she's changing, he's toast.
Ruby soon learns that the Glasses aren't the sweet couple they once were when
the two families used to vacation together in Hawaii.  Erin, a doctor in a
hospital's pain management program, manages her own "pain" nightly with drug
injections, turning herself into a zombie.  Terry is heavily in debt, and some
unsavory characters are looking to call in his loan.  Did I mention yet that the
kids come with a big inheritance?  Doesn't matter.  Even if I didn't, I'm sure
you've already guessed it.
"Hi, you guys need some help?" a friendly sheriff asks the kids.  "Yes," Ruby
replies with succinct understatement.  The writer needed some help too, but he
didn't get it.  The director, however, does his best to keep your attention and
generally succeeds.
THE GLASS HOUSE runs 1:45.  It is rated PG-13 for "sinister thematic elements,
violence, drug content and language," and would be acceptable for kids around 12
and up.
The film opens nationwide in the United States today, Friday, September 14,
2001.   In the Silicon Valley, it is showing at the AMC and the Century
theaters.

   "The Glass House" may be a by-the-numbers thriller with the
audience way ahead of the characters, but since Stellan
Skarsgard is the scariest actor of his generation, the film is well
worth viewing.  Skarsgard turns a hackneyed plot into a nailbiter,
at least until toward the end he is transformed from a guy who can
evoke terror in his would-be victims simply by acting normal to
someone who becomes a generic maniac and therefore almost
laughable.  If Daniel Sackheim ("Law and Order," "The X Files")
directed the entire movie with a Hitchcockian cool instead of
turning it into a teen horror pic in the closing half hour, "The
Glass House" would be quite a respectable thriller, one to admire
for pace, acting and appropriate restraint.
   In fact we in the audience might be willing to overlook some plot
flaws that render the film less credible than it could be.  For
example after the Ruby Baker (Leelee Sobieski) and her kid
brother Rhett (Trevor Morgan) suffer the tragic loss of their
parents, who crashed the family car after attending a function, the
kids are sent per trust agreement to the luscious Malibu digs of
the Bakers' well-to-do friends Erin Glass (Diane Lane) and her
husband Terry (Stellan Skarsgard).  The first thing the adults do is to
assign the two to the same room, although there's enough space
in the glass house (or the Glass House if you prefer) to fit half the
population of the soon-to-be homeless Afghanis.  This is
particularly inappropriate since Ruby is a 16-year-old high-school
student and a sensitive soul at that, one who has trouble mixing in
with her more flippant peers in her new Malibu school.  Why
wouldn't Ruby, who acts mature beyond her years and in fact
looks every bit a real woman when dressed up in black, question
her guardians about this, particularly when, later on, the adults do
in fact decide to move her into separate quarters?
   "The Glass House" is a fairly conventional story about a pair of
adolescents who are compelled to live with virtual strangers after
the death of their parents, guardians who become suspect soon
enough not only for the strange room accommodations but
because Terry, under the guise of taking his new charge to a
party, escorts her to a plush restaurant instead and hits on her as
soon as they retreat to the car.  If Terry had his eyes on the gold
mine that this girl represents, would they shift toward the
attributes of the kid's flesh so conspicuously thereby eroding the
young woman's trust?  As Ruby, by coincidence, watches an intense 
fight between Erin and Terry and, by coincidence once again, happens 
to listen to Terry's incriminating dialogue both on the house phone and 
in his office, she is certain that she and her brother are living on
borrowed 
time and take the needed action to extricate themselves from their
dilemma.
   Without Skarsgard, who has excelled in such work as the
remarkable "Breaking the Waves," almost putting Ray Milland to
shame by his role as a drunk in "Aberdeen," this movie would be
forgettable.  With him--and with the help of the capable Bruce
Dern as the Baker family financial adviser--the film becomes not
a must-see but a worthwhile entry to the year's commercial thrillers.
Rated PG-13.  Running time: 101 minutes.  (C) 2001 by

"Even the guardians let down their guard."
Starring Leelee Sobieski, Diane Lane, Stellan
Skarsgard, Bruce Dern. Directed by Daniel Sackheim.
Rated PG-13.
The Glass House is a fun little piece of schlock, a
soft thriller with some good ideas and a proactive
heroine. Its plot is too obvious to provide any real
what-happens-next suspense, but there are still
moments here to treasure. And, if after seeing her in
some seven movies, I still say that lead actress
Leelee Sobieski "shows promise," it's because she
hasn't been given a real role yet (no, Here on Earth
doesn't count, and I haven't seen her in the title
role of the tv movie Joan of Arc).
Here she plays Ruby Baker, a relatively average
teenager who goes to school, smokes up and has wild
nights out with her friends unbeknownst to her
parents. When said parents are killed in a car
accident, Ruby and her younger brother have to move in
with the Glasses, a rich couple with an amazing house
in Malibu and seemingly unlimited funds at their
disposal.
But in this house, as the film's advertising didn't
fail to tell us a thousand times, things are not as
they seem. It soon becomes obvious to everyone but the
main character that the Glasses, well-played by Diane
Lane and Stellan Skarsgard, plan to use Ruby and her
brother as their "personal piggy-bank," using the
money left to them in their parents' will, as well as
incidentals like their private school tuition, to pay
off their enormous debts.
The Glass House really doesn't come together as well
as it could have, what with the lapses in logic and
virtual lack of tension outside of neat individual
moments. But the movie is well-photographed by
tv-veteran director Daniel Sackheim, and it has a
marvelous production design: the house itself, with
its imposing architecture and, appropriately, glass
walls, has its own menace aside from that of its shady
occupants.
I also liked the back-and-forth between Ruby and her
brother, a series of authentic exchanges that is a
welcome respite from the contrived trappings of the
thriller's main storyline. Sobieski, true to form,
manages to build a character from a screenplay that
doesn't give her one; I'd still like to see her pull a
Thora Birch and do something unconventional. If she
can do this much with a script that actually exhibits
below-average level of writing, he sky's the limit.
And comedy remains an entirely unexplored field.
Diane Lane has slipped under Hollywood's collective
radar -- I don't think I've ever actually seen her
name in print outside of the obligatory "starring"
blurb -- but she is a dependable actress, skilled at
portraying seemingly everyday characters with
something else under the surface. And you almost feel
sorry for Stellan Skarsgard, a pure character actor
who doesn't seem to be having a good time; this script
is a deathtrap.
A better film could have been made from this material.
I could have used more careful plotting and less of
the characters having to catch up to us. I'm
recommending The Glass House, though, because there's
something inherently appealing about its plot (it's
hard to completely screw up an orphan-makes-good
tale); perhaps also because I watched it right after
The Musketeer, which momentarily destroyed my faith in
cinema.

GLASS HOUSE, THE (director: Daniel Sackheim; screenwriter: Wesley Strick;
cinematographer: Alar Kivilo; editor: Howard E. Smith; cast: Leelee Sobieski
(Ruby Baker), Diane Lane (Erin Glass), Stellan Skarsgard (Terry Glass), Bruce
Dern (Begleiter), Kathy Baker (Nancy Ryan), Trevor Morgan (Rhett Baker), Chris
Noth (Uncle Jack), Rita Wilson (Grace Baker), Michael O'Keefe (Dave Baker);
Runtime: 105; Columbia Pictures; 2001) 
A superficial scare film that makes a feeble attempt to serve up Hamlet as its
theme, but that's a stretch. It's about a 16-year-old girl, Ruby Baker (Leelee
Sobieski), and her much younger brother Rhett (Trevor Morgan), who become
orphaned when their Encino, California, parents (Michael O'Keefe and Rita
Wilson) are killed in an auto accident. 
They are vulnerable and a deceitful Malibu couple takes advantage of them, as
Terry and Erin (Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane), supposedly close friends of
their parents, become their guardians. Somehow there are no family members to
take them in and it's also most peculiar that the kids don't know the Glasses;
but, nevertheless, they are turned over to this seemingly wealthy couple living
in an ultra-modern glass house overlooking a cliff. Their estate lawyer,
Begleiter (Bruce Dern), who is their adviser, says that's what their folks
wanted and they would be wards of the state otherwise. He spends about two
seconds with Ruby and drops that news on her like a bombshell, and then hands
her his business card; he then offers her nothing else but to tell her that her
parents were thrifty and left the kids enough money so that they would never
have to worry about money. It didn't seem believable. He was certainly no bundle
of warmth in their hour of need! 
It's a film that is devoid of subtlety as its shocks are not surprising and its
unfulfilling revenge ending in terms of 'An Eye For Eye' was poorly scripted; it
also failed to be convincing or scary. It was just another mindless slasher
film. 
The Glasses put on a false front of being genuinely nice people when the kids
move in, but it soon becomes apparent that they are a creepy couple with
ulterior motives. The film spends most of its time showing the couple pretending
to be nice but still looking creepy. They do not even give the kids separate
rooms in the large house they have, as they are only able to keep Rhett
unconcerned about his situation by buying him off with video games. 
The usual bag of clichéd scare tricks are carried out before Ruby learns that
the businessman in a car transit service business is in deep trouble financially
because he took out a million dollar loan from some gangster loan sharks that he
can't pay back, that his doctor wife is a drug addict, that he rigged the car
her parents died in, and that she and her brother are in deep trouble staying in
that house. It also shows there are no adults she can turn to for help and that
all the institutions in place to service such situations, such as the schools
and social welfare department, are no guarantee that help is on the way. 
The film has a cold and steely look to it, as feelings on everyone's part are
chilly. Ruby is a hard one to warm up to, as she's always wired for hostility,
while her brother seems to be a slave to video games and has no personality. The
house itself is smothered in a cold, aqua blue, as the production designer, Jon
Gary Steele, and the director of photography, Alar Kivilo, have made the set to
look like a clone of the antagonistic and cold-hearted Terry Glass. This kind of
coldness lasted too long onscreen, as the film was trapped in its one-note of
suspense--Will the kids get away from the evil couple who want to rob them and
also kill Ruby? There was no suspense because if you ever watched any of these
formulaic flicks then you will know how this one ends. The film's slow pace for
such a slight story bordered on criminality. 
This is basically a film that put a great effort into getting the sets it wanted
to be right, but failed to get anything more out of this absurd tale. It was
never believable, but its conclusion was even more ridiculous than it had a
right to be.

Here's the set-up. The comfortable suburban life of Ruby Baker (Leelee 
Sobieski) and her kid brother Rhett (Trevor Morgan) is destroyed when 
their parents die in a car crash while celebrating their 20th 
anniversary. Soon after, per the terms of a trust, the kids are sent to 
live with their folks' well-to-do friends Erin Glass (Diane Lane) and 
her husband Terry (Stellan Skarsgard) in a striking glass home on the 
Malibu shores. 
At first, everything seems peachy. The Glasses purchase suitably hip 
clothes for Ruby and two, count 'em, two videogame systems for Rhett. Oh 
sure, they make the teens share one bedroom, but they assure them that 
it is a temporary measure. Then the estate lawyer (Bruce Dern) informs 
Ruby and Rhett that they are collectively worth $4 million. 
Soon, Ruby begins to notice things. Terry and Erin fight a lot. 
Overheard conversations indicate that Terry may be in debt to some very 
nasty men. Erin periodically gets a glassy-eyed stare and her medicine 
cabinet looks like the controlled substances shelf at Walgreens. Terry 
drives like a lunatic and has a tendency to lean in close to Ruby, far 
too close. Could it be that the kids' new guardians are not as pure as 
they appeared to be? 
Well, of course. "The Glass House" is a thriller aimed at teens and, for 
a while, it looks like it just might work. Once Ruby realizes that there 
is trouble in Pepperland, a nice cat and mouse game develops between her 
and the Glasses. But the story degenerates steadily and finally becomes 
just another horror show with a psycho chasing adolescents. Such a 
shame. 
Having Leelee Sobieski (I still think of her as Helen Hunt Jr.) face off 
against Stellan Skarsgard is a great idea. She is one of the smartest 
young actors working today and he comes off as both intelligent and 
scary even when cast in a sympathetic part. But what's the point of 
shipping the brother and the wife to separate parts of the house for 
much of the film, with the boy plugged into videogame nirvana and the 
wife in a chemical one? 
Further, why in the world did the Glasses make two teenagers share one 
bedroom in the first place? Con artists with a plan as elaborate as the 
one concocted by this pair would surely know that the importance of 
keeping up appearances. And Terry Glass would certainly make a better 
attempt at suppressing his dirty old man impulses. 
Ah well, another week in 2001, another new release that starts off 
strong, then goes straight down the drain. What a lousy year.
