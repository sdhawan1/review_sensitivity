Among the hardest of movies to review are kids' movies like A DOG OF
FLANDERS, which is being made for the fourth time.  It's hard to
criticize a handsomely shot film full of good moral values even if the
cliched story never ventures outside of its predictable parameters.  Its
one "surprise" is so obvious that one wonders why they even bother.
The handsome costume drama is set in early nineteenth century Flanders
and was filmed in Bruges, Belgium.  Before even the opening credits
roll, the audience witnesses a mother trudging through heavy, blowing
snow.  She's on her way to deliver her toddler, Nello, to be raised by
his dirt-poor grandfather (Jack Warden).  Having accomplished her
mission, she withers and dies.
With a screenplay by Robert Singer and the director Kevin Brodie, A DOG
OF FLANDERS has the look and feel of a television movie, not surprising
since almost all of their experience is in television.  The excessively
earnest tale features a host of dour characters.  The story, which takes
itself too seriously, needs to lighten up some.  As delivered, the movie
will have its intended audience of kids aged 4 to 12, fidgeting and
squirming in their seats, which is a shame since the values it tries to
teach are so important.
Not a lot happens and when it does the director substantially mutes its
effect.  And the editor trims the scenes down to a certain homogenized
blandness.  You keep feeling that there's a much better story trying
hard to get out.
The coming-of-age story concerns Nello's desire to be a great painter,
using his mother's artistic genes.  Nello, played by Jeremy James
Kissner and Jesse James at what one guesses might be ages 7 and 12, is a
hard working boy.
One day Nello comes across a lovable, black carpet of a dog (Patrasche)
lying nearly dead in the road.  Patrasche was beaten and abandoned by
his last owner for committing the sin of not being able to pull a heavy
cart fast enough.
Although you might think that any movie with a dog in the title would
feature, well, a dog, the frisky Patrasche doesn't get anywhere near the
screen time that he deserves.  Moreover, he earns a warning in the
ending credits as the filmmakers feel compelled to admonish kids that
dogs of Patrasche's breed, officially known as Bouvier des Flanders, may
not make a suitable pet.  What's next?  Will credits start warning kids
that the villains in the movies may not make appropriate friends?
The script hews carefully to a strict moral code with trite little
aphorisms at every turn.  ("Never underestimate the power of love, my
boy."  "Genius is a greatness that burns like an eternal flame.")  One
of the story's few evil characters is a landlord who likes to be paid in
full.  "Patience is a virtue I do not possess," he explains.
A remarkably young looking Jon Voight plays a talented, local artist
named Michel La Grande, who mentors Nello in the art of painting.  His
exact relationship to the boy is the story's one mystery.  Perhaps
audience members attending their first motion picture or those too young
for school will not be able to solve this puzzle.
The production's problems are many.  Two of the movie's key scenes
happen as large laundry flakes are blown all over what is clearly an
indoor set.  Needless to say, these stick to bodies but never melt.
And the driving part of the story's last half has Nello striving
valiantly to win the town's annual artistic competition.  After working
on his painting for months, he shows up 3 minutes too late to enter it
in the contest, so his submission is refused.  Think he'll be allowed to
submit it after all?  Gosh you're smart.  But so would Nello be.  There
is no way that he wouldn't be on time for the most important thing in
his life.
One is tempted on such a promising but cliched movie to reduce it to a
one-phrase review.  The one for this picture would be: Needs more dog.
A DOG OF FLANDERS runs about an hour and a half.  It is rated PG for one
scene of mild violence, mild language and thematic elements.  It would
be fine for kids 6 and up, but younger ones might be scared by frequent
images of death and dying.
My son Jeffrey, age 10, thought the movie was only "okay," and gave it
just **.  He liked the characters but thought they didn't have much to
do.  He also did not like the way the boy's age changed abruptly with no
explanation as to the amount of time that had elapsed.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
The darkest children's film since the Babe sequel, A Dog of Flanders is
an early 19th century Belgian story of arson, animal cruelty, children
born out of wedlock, drinking, and corruption.  It has little to do with
the titular dog, but instead concentrates on a young boy's quest to
become the next big thing in the northern European art world.  It is not
 I repeat  not about a new dog for Bart's neighbors Rod and Todd.
The boy is Nello, a lad whose mother was lost to a blinding snowstorm
when he was two (nobody knows who his father is).  Raised by his weary,
dirt poor grandfather Jehan Daas (Jack Warden, Dirty Work), Nello helps
out by running milk into town everyday.  Like his mother, Nello (played
here by Jesse James, Message in a Bottle, who appears to be the missing
Hanson brother) also has a talent for sketching with charcoal.  One day,
he finds a large Bouvier des Flanders  a breed of hard working dog 
that was beaten and left for dead in the woods near Nello's home.
Naming him Patrasche (his mother's middle name), Nello nurses the
bear-like pooch back to health and Patrasche is soon helping the boy
with his milk runs.
Flash to a few years later, where Nello (now played by Jeremy James
Kissner, the young Finn from Great Expectations and a dead ringer for
Leelee Sobieski's younger brother) is coached by a local artist named
Michel LaGrande (Jon Voight, Varsity Blues).  LaGrande takes Nello to
see a work done by another great local artist named Peter Paul Rubens.
At first, I thought this was a cross between the guy who invented the
Mounds bar and Pee-Wee Herman.  But it turns out that LaGrande meant the
Belgian Flemish artist from the 1600s and convinces Nello to enter the
`Junior Rubens' art contest open to local youth.
Nello's best friend Aloise (Madylin Sweeten, Everybody Loves Raymond)
models for Nello's pieces, despite her father's warnings to keep away
from his daughter, especially after Nello is blamed for torching his
flour mill.  The two children still manage to sneak off to a circus,
where they share their first kiss and a dance straight from Titanic.
Despite the film's high body count and It's a Wonderful Life-ish ending
(where Nello almost meets the same Little Match Girl fate as his
mother), Flanders is a warmly glowing picture.  Gritty costumer Beatrix
Aruna Pasztor, who worked on the last six Gus van Sant films, and
cinematographer Walther van den Ende (The Eighth Day) both deserve
special recognition.  The small town's center is reminiscent of Jude,
with its main character seeming to be threatened by the heavy stones
that constitute just about everything in sight.
Based on a popular children's story, Flanders is adapted and directed by
Kevin Brodie (Treacherous), with television veteran Robert Singer
helping script this film version.  The ideas in the film seem a little
scattered  Warden disappears for about 45 minutes in the middle - and
runs a bit long.  It seems to not know where it's going or care how long
it takes to get there, but instead concentrates on looking good  which
isn't a bad thing at all.  (1:40 - PG for more violence than you would
ordinarily find in a children's film, as well as many deaths)

IN SHORT: A bleak tale for the kidlets.
Let's talk image for a second. You see a dog. You see a boy. You think
happy thoughts, just as everybody else would, and pack up the kidlets to
see A Dog Of Flanders. Before the title credits, a young mother dies
from exposure to a brutal snowstorm, leaving her young son in the care
of her widowed father. Within ten minutes, a dog is brutally beaten by
its master and left for dead on the side of the road, where it is found
and restored to health by the boy. It's a good thing that this thing has
a happy ending, 'cuz without it, the smallest of kidlets would be
confused and the nine year olds would be upset.
Parents exist, so I'm told, to protect their kidlets from thoughts like
"Life sucks and then you die." So what do you do when that very
sentiment parades across screen as a kidlet story, and then tacks on a
"unless you choose not to (die)" Hollywood happy ending?
Well, that's not fair. The happy ending may have been in the original
story. We don't know. We've never seen 'em. We're guessing that they
were inspiring reads. What makes it to the screen isn't.
The boy is called Nello, played as a single digit kidlet by Jesse James
and pre-teen by Jeremy James Kissner. Grandfather Jehan Daas (Jack
Warden) is a tenant farmer beholden to evil landlord Stefan () and makes
his money selling milk to the people in the town. The dog, Patrasche,
whose entrance into the story is mentioned above, pulls the milk cart.
Nello, who has shown a distinct talent as an artist, is on the verge of
that wonderful childlike love with the blonde girl next door, Aloise
(Farren Monet and Madyline Sweeten) when they are banned from seeing
each other.
With a fatherless orphan as the center of the story, we get to look at
the males onscreen, as if to figure out which is the real dad. There's
the local blacksmith, William (Bruce McGill). There's a local artist,
Michel La Grande (Jon Voight) who stumbles across Nello at the foot of a
statue of the famous artist Peter Paul Rubens, and takes an interest in
the boy. Of course, there is Aloise's father, Carl (Steven Hartley). Has
he banned Nello from seeing Aloise because of the differences in
economic class, or is there some deep dark secret yet to be uncovered?
Aloise's mother (Cheryl Ladd) knows some of Nello's secrets, but she's
not telling. Nello himself hopes to win an art contest, whose rich prize
money and art school scholarship will lift him out of the poverty he has
known all his life.
Without going into detail, let us say that A Dog Of Flanders plays more
like a 19th Century Book of Job than a Horatio Alger story. This poor
kidlet, never advantaged in anyway except for a strong moral character,
lives a miserable life. At the end, a community is brought together to
face what it has done and what would be an inspiring conclusion falls
apart under the weight of a script that tips its hand way too soon and
fails to build up enough solutions to the mystery of Nello's father.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to A Dog Of Flanders, he would have
paid...
With most kidflicks hitting the $3.00 rental level, I place this one
just below the average. A Dog Of Flanders is not this film that will
inspire the kidlets. Only with good parents explaining how you can never
give up, how Nello overcomes the obstacles he faces, does it fulfill the
purpose it sets out to.

         Set in the early 19th century in the Dutch-speaking region of
Belgium known as Flanders, this tale revolves - not around a dog - but
a boy.  Little Nello (Jesse James/Jeremy James) is an poor orphan who
grows up in the care of his kindly grandfather (Jack Warden). Since
his mother was an artist and left him her sketchbook, Nello loves to
draw. A chance meeting with a noted local artist (Jon Voight)
introduces the great Flemish painter, Peter Paul Rubens, as a focus
for Nello's dreams. So where does the dog come in? By the side of the
road, Nello finds a large Bouvier des Flanders who was cruelly abused
by a peddler and befriends him, naming him Patrasche. Big, black,
fluffy Patrasche trots around as Nello's loyal companion, but the pet
is limited to the periphery of the action. Writer/director Kevin
Brodie, working with Robert Singer, adapting the novel by Ouida
(a.k.a. Marie Louise de la Ramee), comes up with trite dialogue
punctuating a contrived yet predictable story. Those familiar with the
book will note that the ending has been changed to one much
happier. Brought up on a diet of fast-paced television, children will
undoubtedly be bored, squirming in their seats along with their
parents. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "A Dog of Flanders" is
a slow-paced, dreary 3. "Real happiness comes not with possessions or
positions but with people" and "Never underestimate the power of love"
are worthwhile sentiments but they're presented in the dullest
framework possible.

     I note the following in the interest of fairness:  a smattering of
audience applause greeted the conclusion of A DOG OF FLANDERS at the
screening I attended.  That audience consisted almost entirely of parents
and pre-teens, causing me to ponder comments I've received over the years
regarding whether "family films" should be held to a different critical
standard.  Sure, A DOG OF FLANDERS could appeal to children without very
discriminating tastes; yes, parents may be happy to find something warm
'n' fuzzy for the young'uns.  I, however, watched as someone who expects
little things like decent performances, a narrative with a point, and a
script that doesn't feel like it was written _by_ children instead of
_for_ children.  A DOG OF FLANDERS is simple, non-threatening, harmless
family filmmaking that also happens to be thoroughly uninteresting on
almost any level.
     Based on a 19th century children's tale by Ouida, A DOG OF FLANDERS
tells the story of a young boy named Nello Daas (Jesse James) living in
Belgium -- presumably the late 1800's, presumably around Antwerp.  A poor
farmboy living with his ailing grandfather (Jack Warden), Nello dreams of
being a great painter some day like his idol Peter Paul Rubens.  Despite
the support of kindly local artist Michel La Grande (Jon Voight), however,
Nello seems trapped by his social station.  Class conflict grows more
evident when the teenage Nello (Jeremy James Richter) encounters objection
to his friendship with a merchant's daughter (Farren Monet), and even
finds himself accused of arson.  But Nello always perseveres, entering a
youth art contest and maintaining a pure and honest heart.
     If you notice the conspicuous lack of any dog mentioned in that plot
summary, there's a very good reason.  Despite the title, Nello's pet
Bouvier des Flanders, Patrasche, plays only a token role in the film's
events.  That's not just unfortunate because it's somewhat deceptive --
it's unfortunate because the dog may turn in the film's best performance.
The young performers, particularly newcomer Farren Monet, at least have
inexperience as an excuse.  Voight and Warden, who fuss and knit their
brows and play with ever-varying accents, earn no such slack.  A DOG OF
FLANDERS may be a youth melodrama, but there's not a moment of real
character-based emotion to make the film tolerable as a narrative.  It's
hard to imagine how a production like this avoided the direct-to-video
dustbin.
     It's also hard to imagine from this version that the story is such a
classic that it has already been filmed three previous times.  Without a
familiarity with either the source material or the earlier film
incarnations, I can only assume that a story with such appeal had to focus
on the adventures of a boy and his faithful dog.  This film focuses on the
adventures of a boy as he discovers the pitfalls of his poverty, takes
milk into town, draws pictures of his childhood sweetheart, discusses art
theory with his mentor La Grande, and learns hard lessons about the
politics of youth art contests.  There is a colorful encounter with a
traveling circus, it's true, and one moderately rousing chase and knife
fight with Patrasche's cruel former owner.  Otherwise, A DOG OF FLANDERS
delivers the kind of timeless youth appeal one usually associates with an
evening of CNN.
     I suppose it's pointless to add the cartoonish villainy of Nello's
landlord (who also yells at his wife and calls her "woman," so we know
he's a really bad guy), or to note the retina-rattling eye-rolling that
accompanied a Yoda-like apparition of Rubens himself, or to snicker at the
WIZARD OF OZ denouement which includes a not-at-all startling revelation
of parentage.  Those who enjoy the film will probably find ways in which
those elements complement the story perfectly.  For me, A DOG OF FLANDERS
lacked any of the elements which bring life to a family film -- emotional
resonance, strong relationships, well-drawn characters.  I'm not going to
deny the appeal of a protagonist who perseveres and maintains a pure and
honest heart, especially for parents looking to teach strength of
character.  It would have been nice, however, to build a watchable film
around that strength of character.  I'll leave this one to those parents
and children who watch with a heroic generosity of spirit, those who won't
leave thinking the real dog is the film itself.

   Titles chosen for movies obviously have something to do
with the interest the films generate.  Perhaps "The Iron
Giant," a leviathan of a story which achieved eminent critical
success, was a box-office disappointment because its title
just doesn't excite attention.  But label a movie with "dog"
and you just may attract ample notice.  After all a whopping
40% of American households have dogs, or so I've heard. 
Then, you never know.  In the 19th century the most popular
words in the English language were "Lincoln," "Doctor," and
"Dog," so naturally someone wrote a novel called "Lincoln's
Doctor's Dog."  It failed.
   "A Dog of Flanders" is not a failure, but the picture is not a
triumph of children's filmmaking either.  A tear-jerker like
"Lassie Come Home," "Flanders" does not stand up to that
1943 masterwork, the greatest animal picture of all time. 
Kevin Brodie and Robert Singer's script is saddled with
cliches, its focus is not on the dog (who has little more than a
cameo role and, in fact, is not even cited in the principal cast
list), and though we want children's movies to teach lessons,
this one OD's on preachiness.  Here are some of the
platitudes that kids in the audience must endure, if indeed
they sit as still as they did for the far worthier "Iron Giant"...
 1.  Never underestimate the power of love;
 2.  Never get drunk and whip your dog;
 3.  Don't smoke and then fall asleep in the haystack;
 4.  Never hate or lower yourself to the level of your enemies;
 5.  There's nothing like milk in the morning;
 6.  Bandages keep the dirt out;
 7.  Reach for the stars;
 8.  Of course you can be great: you have (mother,
grandfather, dog, blacksmith, great painter) to believe in you.
 9.  People die, right before your eyes, kids.  (One from
influenza, I think; one from a heart attack; one is murdered by
a dog.)
   If you're a particularly hip kid, you may get the message
that it's OK to have fun in the hay with a woman and then
abandon her if she's below your station.  You can always
return a hero years later and take responsibility for what you
and the indigent lady produced.
   "A Dog of Flanders" was done a few times before on TV
and in the movies, the one notable American version most
notably featuring Theodore Bikel in a character role in 1959. 
There was also a European interpretation of Ouida's fable
during the 1940s.  This is not to say there's no reason to
revive the sappy story since most of us probably hadn't seen
any of the previous incarnations, so here's what we get...
  Nello (Jeremy James Kissner as the kid of about 12 and
Jesse James when he was six) watches his mother die after
she was presumably caught in a Belgian snowstorm.  Nello is
brought up by an amiable grandfather, Jehan Daas (Jack
Warden), who encourages the lad to cherish a sketchbook his
mother left for him.  When a brutal drunk leaves his whipped
work dog, a Bouvier des flanders, for dead in the snow, the
boy adopts the dog whom he dubs Patrasche, nurses her
(him?) back to the living, and finds room in his heart for both
the Bouvier and a rich girl named Aloise (Madylin Sweeten). 
Determined to become a painter like the Belgian town's late
hero, Peter Paul Rubens, he finds himself at a disadvantage
because of his socio-economic class, shunned by both
Aloise's philistine father and later by the city fathers.  But his
painting career blossoms under the guidance of an
accomplished artist, Michel de la Grande (Jon Voight), who
takes an unusual interest in the boy.
   Jon Voight looks silly in the huge rug he wears to show
that he's a European Artiste (capital E and A), and seems
embarrassed enough in the role that he wears assorted
layers of clothing even when he's studying his canvas.  Jack
Warden's avuncular guise is all too brief but Jeremy James
Kissner as the principal performer carries the picture well
enough.  (The boy bears an unusual resemblance to Helen
Hunt.)  By exhibiting the usual suspects--giving comeuppance
to a drunk who suffers a fate like that of the Wicked Witch of
the West and to a vicious landlord who resembles the
landowners of Victorian melodramas; and making heroes of
the good guys including the sensitive wife (Cheryl Ladd) of an
all-too-practical farmer (Steven Hartley)--"A Dog of Flanders"
is just a been-there-done-that generic amusement that has
little resonance.  The dog is adorable, and when she (he?)
likes the human will bark on cue and pull loads of milk in a
wagon.  But a picture that's named for the Bouvier should
have made the Belgian pooch do more to earn his waffles. 
You may have heard barking before, but yips and yelps are
preferable to sentences like blacksmith William's "There's
nothing like milk in the morning."

Review:  A DOG OF FLANDERS is the story of an adorable little boy named Nello
and his trials and tribulations in 19th century Flanders.  Living with his
Grandfather Jehan (Jack Warden) in poverty, Nello finds happiness in his life
in spite of difficult times (they are renting a spare one-room cottage, and the
greedy, malevolent landlord who owns it threatens to throw them `out of the
house' if they don't pay the rent). Nello also has a rather creative talent for
drawing some of the most beautiful pictures that I have ever seen, in either a
movie or in real life.  (His hero is Peter Paul Rubens, the great Flemish
painter of the 17th century.)
Not that these are the only things that make Nello's life happy, however.  He
has a dog of Flanders, whom he names Patrasche, who is a heroic Rin-Tin-Tin of
the 19th century, whom he rescues from his cruel, unkind master.  In addition,
he even has a best friend (and future sweetheart) in the lovely, wealthy
Aloise, whose father strongly disapproves of her hanging out with `lower-class'
Nello.  (He thinks he's not good enough for her, and he would hate the idea of
the two kids marrying.)  But then, he was a poor guy himself before he married
(as mentioned later on in the film).
One day, Nello encounters a mysterious, yet kindhearted artist named Michel La
Grande (played wonderfully by Jon Voight), who tells the boy to keep drawing
from his heart, and that perhaps one day he might land a career in being an
artist.  And every Christmas, there is a contest on which is the most beautiful
painting of the year; the winner getting a lot of money.  Eager to save his
home (and his aging, dying Grandfather), Nello willingly decides to become an
artist, asking Aloise to pose for him.
One night, the two travel to a circus, where they have their fortune told one
of the film's most delightful scenes that great happiness is destined for them
.  She gives the kids a ring, whom Nello places on Aloise's hand.  ;) 
Afterwards, the two kids have a rollickingly good time dancing around in front
of circus performers.
Unfortunately, things are not all `la-dee-dah' in this tale.  Aloise's father
finally becomes so angry with Nello that he forbids him to ever see Aloise
again.  Bad enough that they can't see each other (although we know Nello and
Aloise, don't we?), but that's only the start of Nello's troubles.  Aloise's
farm is burned down, and Nello is wrongfully accused (by the landord of his
cottage) for starting the fire in order to take revenge on being forbidden to
see Aloise.  This decreases Nello's reputation around the town, save Aloise and
her parents, and a kindly miller, William, who is very sweet to Nello every
time he drops by.
Matters get much worse for Nello when his grandfather dies, and he has to pay
for his funeral.  But then things really get nasty when the landlord exiles
Nello from his own home (for not paying his rental)permanetly.  This means
that Nello and Patrasche have to starve and walk out in the cold, freezing
wind.  Worst of all, the painting that he has desperately been working on
during all this time, `The Portrait of the Princess', fails to win the prize at
the festival.  Now Nello and Patrasche are REALLY depressed, and close to
freezing to death.  Will Nello be able to find any happiness in his life?  Will
Patrasche save the day?  Will Nello make the fateful trip to join his mother
and grandfather in Paradise?
A DOG OF FLANDERS is a delightful, heartwarming family film that is sure to
entertain kids of all ages.  Even older ones who consider themselves too
`sophisticated' for kiddie fare will be surprised to hear that this film is for
grown-ups, too.  There have been other movies of this ilk (boy and dog), and
while this one falls into that category, it is mostly a story about overcoming
difficulties and finding a good home for yourself.  Move over or rather, roll
over OLD YELLER, this dog of Flanders is a heartwarming delight.
The cinematography, courtesy of Walther van den Ende is beautiful, and really
adds to the powerful drama of the film.  It also gives a feel of being in
Flanders (the whole film was respectably shot in Flanders).
The music from Richard Friedman is also remarkable; an evocative, poignant
score that recaptures music from the 19th Century.  The opening song over the
credits is very beautiful (I hope the soundtrack is available!), and there's a
brief excerpt of `Cheer Up, Charlie' from WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY
(sung by Aloise, to Nello, in another delightful scene).
The cast is first-rate:  Jesse James and Jeremy James Kissner, who play Nello,
are some of the most endearing, adorable young stars I have ever seen in my
whole life (so are the girls who play Aloise, Madyline Sweeten as the younger,
and Farren Monet as the older).  Not that they are the only good stars,
however.  Jack Warden is ideal as Jehan, eliciting just the right amount of
humor and compassion required for the character.  (The scenes involving him and
Nello are heartwarming, touching ones.)  Also, Bruce McGill is charming as the
kindly miller William.  He's another one of my favorite characters in the film.
 But Jon Voight, as I mentioned before, is the perfect choice for Michel.  He
brings a mysterious, yet gentle performance that makes us all feel good again
when he reassures insecure Nello that he *can* win the contest.
But what makes this film fun to watch is how well-defined the characters are,
and the pace of the story (best of all, it has a happy ending though I will
*not* give it away; sorry) is strong and powerful enough for us to identify
with the characters.  For the first time since the beginning of 1999, there
comes a film which doesn't rely on popular formula stuff, such as big-budget
special effects, commercial rock soundtracks, or any of that stuff.  This one
relies on telling a fully character-oriented story, with just the right amount
of heart, humor, and drama.  That, to me, is what makes A DOG OF FLANDERS all
the more delightful.
Eleanor O'Sullivan of `The Home News & Tribune' noticed this, and was kind and
generous enough to welcome it:  `For want of a better word, a glow surrounds A
DOG OF FLANDERS.  Its heart is in the right place and it engages you.  You can
guess where the film is going because this is well-traveled territory, but with
pros like Voight and appealing young performers like Kissner, an often-told
story is well worth a revisit.'  In addition, there were a couple of other
enthusiasts, such as Chicago-Sun Times and the Washington Post (you should read
their reviews; they're really positive).
Other critics, however, were not so kind.  Stephen Holden of `The New York
Times' had more than a share of beatings to lay upon A DOG OF FLANDERS via pen
writing.  He found the film to be a `sea of sugary bromides' and condemned Mr.
Voight's character as `hopelessly wooden adopts an accent even more
indeterminate than the one he came up with for ANACONDA.'  In addition,
`Entertainment Weekly' slam-dunked the film, condemning it as `the worst family
film of the year.'  There have been so many other bad reviews like this, too.
My suggestion:  disregard the critics.  They just have a big problem with
touching family films, and one should never pay attention to them.  This DOG OF
FLANDERS may only be a little `family' movie (It probably won't be a big hit in
the style of TITANIC, but then again no other film has been since then), but
that is not a bad thing in and of itself.  This is a story that is sure to warm
your heart, and that is what really matters about A DOG OF FLANDERS.  It is
also one of the better family films around this year.  None of the other films
I have seen this year (though they were good) have been so low-key and
touching.  If you're looking for family-style entertainment, look no further
than this charming boy-and-dog yarn.  Go see it while you still can, for as I
mentioned, it might not be a big bow-wow at the box office for a long time. 
See it while you can.  There is really no need to compare a multi-million
dollar blockbuster such as STAR WARS:  EPISODE ITHE PHANTOM MENACE or TARZAN,
or even THE IRON GIANT with a tender, sweet little family movie.
