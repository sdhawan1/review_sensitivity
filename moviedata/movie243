A friend of mine who recently visited France remarked
that the people there lacked a sense of humor.  But
how could that be?  After watching this film, how can
you NOT laugh at the French police force, which
appears to be the most inept law enforcement agency in
all of Europe?  Their bumbling methods make it seem as
if they all graduated with top honors from Inspector
Clouseau's Academy for the Dimwitted.
In "Kiss of the Dragon," however, the intent is not to
elicit laughter.  And that's too bad because there are
oodles of opportunities to make this a really fun
film.  Just think of all the wacky situations that our
hero, Jet Li, could have found himself in.  He plays
Johnny, an operative from Beijing sent to Paris to
help the local police crack an important case. 
Diminutive, unable to speak the language, and
unaccustomed to their way of police work, it makes you
wonder how these two governments could even agree to
such an arrangement.   Meanwhile, Johnny is humbly
reserved, but while in Paris, stays with a colleague
who makes his hideaway in a seedy, prostitute-infested
area.  Here is the perfect 'fish-out-of-water' set up.
 But the film's tone opts for moody atmosphere rather
than lighthearted earnestness.
Any laughter that occurs is more the result of the
absurdity of the on-screen action.  For example, every
time Jet Li dispatches a thug, there's another taller
and more muscular thug in the background that steps up
to attack.  He fells opponents in a variety of wild
ways such as by ramming a pair of chopsticks into the
throat.  My favorite scene, though, was when he
executed a balletic scissors kick that propelled a
pool ball across the room and into the forehead of a
surprised bad guy.  "Yeah, right!" we say to ourselves
under our breath.  It's a strange juxtaposition of
silliness and violence.   Alas, the one thing that Jet
Li really needs in his arsenal of lightning-speed
punches, roundhouse kicks, and weapons mastery is an
ability to give a beaming smile.  Yes, this film
desperately needs to strip away its stoicism and find
a sense of humor.  
But for those of you who just want to see Jet Li kick
butt, you won't be disappointed.  The plot provides a
string of sequences that showcases Li's athleticism
and martial arts skills, which are quite impressive. 
And he'll need every ounce of luck and skill to stay
alive after a corrupt French inspector (Tcheky Karyo)
frames him for the murder.  
Our villainous inspector is another absurd element
that will make you roll your eyes.  We don't so much
mind his cold-blooded nature, but it's hard to believe
his irritatingly odious demeanor and his incessant
snarling in that gravelly French accent.  Perhaps the
feedback levels of the boom mike were a bit out of
whack.
Our lithe hero manages to escape all of the
Inspector's attempts at capturing him even when he is
pursued through sewer drains by SWAT teams, seemingly
trapped on a boat, or surrounded in a dojo facility
with 3 dozen black belts.  Yes, some of this absurdity
becomes entertaining at some point.  And, when Li
decides to stop running and to take matter into his
own hands by infiltrating the Inspector's police
station, this sequence is kind of fun.  Yet, it's too
bad that Li never smiles. This film would have been
more enjoyable if we thought that he was having fun
too.

Wham, bam, thank you ma'am!  Jet Li has finally returned to prime
ass-kicking form in his latest kung fu extravaganza Kiss of the Dragon.
Jet Li - one of the most popular stars in Asia rivaling Jackie Chan and
Chow Yun-Fat - has had an impressive string of over 25 films under his
belt in his two decades of kung fu prowess and strong acting turns.  But
after two dismal attempts at winning over American audiences with a
small villain role in Lethal Weapon 4 and the horrendous Joel Silver
monstrosity Romeo Must Die, it was looking pretty grim for this mighty
warrior.  So, Li read the e-mails from his fans, taking their
compliments and complaints via his web site.
This undertaking prompted Li to construct a film that would capture the
powerful imagery of his earlier masterpieces -- The Bodyguard from
Beijing, High Risk, Fist of Legend, and Once Upon a Time in China I and
II.  Li wanted to move away from the wire work and computer graphics of
such recent films as The Matrix and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,
which seemed to remove the authenticity of the art form.  He instead
wanted to provide American audiences with an authentic glimpse of a
martial artist at work, just like the master Bruce Lee.
To help construct a compelling story, Li brought in action maestro Luc
Besson to help write the screenplay from Li's original story as well as
aid in the production of the film.  This combination provides more hits
than misses, culminating in the most successful, straight-action genre
film I've seen in a very long time.
Kiss of the Dragon begins with the story of Asian supercop Johnny (Jet
Li) who joins forces with nefarious, megalomaniac French cop Richard
(Tchéky Karyo) to capture an Asian drug lord hiding out in Paris.  When
the drug lord get killed in bloody fashion by the Frenchy and his small
army of bad-ass mofos, Johnny gets framed for the murder and ends up on
the run.  Along the way, he gets in fights with about a million bad guys
while Richard and his small army shoot up the bystanders.  Johnny then
joins forces with one of Richard's hookers named Jessica (Bridget
Fonda), rescuing Jessica's baby girl from the clutches of Richard and
retrieving the evidence that will clear Johnny's name. 
Hong Kong cinema has never been known strongly for its original story
lines but rather for its character development.  Indeed, Li is
impressive in his quiet but powerful role, proving himself an authentic
action star that actually sheds blood and shows more signs of exhaustion
in the face of adversity.
The main flaws of the film are found in Besson's script, whose
fingerprints muddy every scene, from incredible action sequences to the
weak female characters.  Besson has never been able to create a solid,
multi-layered woman's role in any of his films.  Even La Femme Nikita
showed his inability in developing a compelling female character who
wasn't in desperate trouble, down on her luck, and needing a strong man
to help her get back on top.  Bridget Fonda's hooker role who needs
Johnny to help rescue her daughter is a classic example of the
virgin/whore complex that obsesses Besson.  Fonda's melodramatic moments
are at times laughable and distracting.
Additionally, Besson draws the character of Richard as a shadow of Gary
Oldman's corrupt cop character from Léon.  The only saving grace is
Karyo's ability to turn a very shallow villain into a multi-layered
monster.  Li's role also feels like an Asian version of Léon himself,
and Besson stages many of the action sequences by echoing his earlier
works.
The ho-hum story aside, the action sequences are amazing.  Director
Chris Nahon (best known for French commercials) handles the action as
deft as any Peckinpah or McTiernan production, capturing Li in stunning
motion.  The violence meter is extremely high and even Li recommends
children not see the film on his web site.  I even found myself
cringing, and I'm a whore for violence.

At first, "Kiss of the Dragon" had me. The action film, co-scripted by
Luc Besson ("La Femme Nikita," "The Fifth Element") and Robert Mark
Kamen from a story by star Jet Li, quickly established itself as a
grisly, single-minded, hard-core martial arts comic book, with fighting,
fighting and more fighting. Fair enough, sounds good. But as the minutes
ticked by, the whole thing grew tiresome. After it became obvious that
Jet Li's character was absolutely unstoppable, the tension faded away. I
looked for something else to occupy my attention, but there simply was
nothing else there.
Jet Li plays Liu Jian, China's top cop, sent from Beijing to Paris to
assist local officers in protecting an important Chinese citizen. In
addition to being a martial arts master, Liu also has a way with
acupuncture needles. He can use them to make someone relax, paralyze a
foe or execute a move called "Kiss of the Dragon," which causes the
recipient to bleed from all orifices and die a particularly painful
death. God, this guy would be such a hit in Texas.
Things turn sour for Liu when the man he is supposed to protect is
murdered by the police officers he is supposed to work with. Inspector
Richard (Tcheky Karyo), the ringleader of the gang, frames Liu for the
killing, forcing Liu to hide in the red light district while trying to
sort things out. Along the way, he meets Jessica (Bridget Fonda) a North
Dakota mother, hooker and recovering junkie. Well, almost recovering.
Periodically, her pimp forcibly injects her with drugs to keep her
compliant, although that shouldn't be much of a problem, since he is
also holding her daughter hostage. And who is this horrible, horrible
man? Inspector Richard, of course.
Liu is presented as a man focused on his work to the exclusion of all
else. Aside from rage, he shows little emotion, save for one scene where
Jessica pokes into his personal life. "Are you married?" she asks. "No."
"Do you have a girlfriend?" "No." "Are you gay?" Finally, we see a spark
of emotion  panic  as he quickly replies, "No, I am not gay. I am NOT
gay." OK, so it appears Liu has no sexual relationships in his life.
Hmmm. Perhaps there are some other tricks he can do with his magic
needles.
Leaping from one seedy location to the next, "Kiss of the Dragon" keeps
the action churning, with each new battle more absurd than the last. One
takes place on a passenger-packed boat, with bad cops firing automatic
weapons in all directions. The scene is great eye candy, but it made me
wonder where the city's other police officers were during the shooting
spree. Are all of them corrupt or did Inspector Richard assign them to
work in the suburbs for the day?
Who knows and who cares? With a hammy performance by Karyo, a flat
performance from Fonda and a non-performance from Jet Li, "Kiss of the
Dragon" cares not a whit about logic or personality. This is simply an
exercise in hyper-violent showboating, a nihilistically pure look at
impurity.

In KISS OF THE DRAGON, Jet Li could be called a lean, mean, fighting machine
were it not for his monk-like stoicism.  Given his complete absence of emotion,
a more apt description would be to call him a lean, fighting cipher.  But, if
it's merely violent action you crave, then Chris Nahon's KISS OF THE DRAGON will
not disappoint you, as the director seems to be shooting for a DPS (Deaths Per
Scene) rate somewhere in the single digits.
Although the movie is basically a Jet Li martial arts extravaganza, it does have
a  supporting cast, including an overacting Tchéky Karyo as corrupt French
police officer Jean-Pierre Richard and Bridget Fonda, playing way under her
capabilities, as a prostitute named Jessica.  "I'm stupid, but I'm not that
stupid," Fonda's character says at one point.  Well, Fonda signed up to do this
bit of acting slumming, which was pretty stupid, especially after her MONKEYBONE
bomb.
Chinese policeman Liu Jian is in Paris to work with Richard.  Referred to by one
of the Frenchman as "Mr. Statue," Liu can do some ferocious fighting when he
isn't staring blankly.  In his best stunt, he kicks a billiard ball out of the
pocket and into the air.  From there, he launches it like a missile with his
flying feet so that it kills his attacker with a massive blow to the forehead. 
Typical of the level of violence in the story is a gory scene in which Liu kills
one victim by ramming two chopsticks through his neck.  Among Liu's more unusual
skills is his ability to turn the healing art of acupuncture into a heinous
technique for death.  Think of the deadly efficient Jet Li as the exact opposite
of the sweetly humorous Jackie Chan.
The movie's biggest surprise is that, even with three people working on the
script (Jet Li, Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen), they were unable to come up
with a plot.  Then again, maybe they didn't want to constrain the action
sequences by having to adhere to some arbitrary storyline.  Better to just let
Jet Li fight and stare.  And fight again.
KISS OF THE DRAGON runs a long 1:38.  It is rated R for strong violence,
language, some sexuality and drug content and would be acceptable for older
teenagers.
My son Jeffrey, age 12, gave the film ***, praising the high level of action and
complaining about the lack of a plot.
The film is playing in nationwide release now in the United States.  In the
Silicon Valley, it is showing at the AMC and the Century theaters.

      Jet Li has played bad guys, and he has played good guys, and it isn't 
easy to tell the difference.  Kiss of the Dragon begins with supercop Liu 
Jian (Li) arriving in France from Beijing to work with the French cops in 
busting a Chinese heroin ring.
Is this your first visit to Paris? asks the customs officer.
It is.  And a good thing, too.  Everywhere he goes devastation tags 
along like a pet Biblical plague.  He doesn t seem to ask for trouble, but 
trouble doesn't wait to be asked.  If Paris should be unlucky enough to 
host Kiss of the Dragon 2, there won t be a building or a body left 
standing, no tourists to insult and no Parisians to insult them.
There s not much plot to Dragon, and no suspense.  That wouldn't be 
so bad nobody goes to a martial arts movie for plot or suspense but there's 
nothing much in the way of character or cleverness either. The sound is 
harsh, the music is strident, and the direction is inept.  Worst of all, 
there's no soul.  Li takes on all comers, singly, in pairs, by the dozens, 
with the same cold efficiency.  He scarcely ever breaks a sweat, and never 
changes expression.  Chop, wham, crunch, pop, slam! and off he goes, 
unsmiling, unwrinkled, and unconcerned.
Director Chris Nahon and his mentor, producer/screenwriter Luc 
Besson, seem to have understood the basic soullessness of their product, so 
they inserted a soulful character in the form of a whore with a heart of 
gold.  Jessica (Bridget Fonda) is a nice girl from North Dakota who has 
somehow wound up in Paris, had a daughter out of wedlock, got hooked on 
drugs, and got her daughter kidnapped by the villainous Inspector Richard 
(Tcheky Karyo) of the Paris police.  Now he's forcing her to work the 
streets to get her little girl back.  This whoring is clearly against her 
will, but sometimes she seems better adjusted to it than others.  The first 
time we see her she is so nauseated at the prospect of servicing a Chinese 
drug lord in a luxury hotel room along with another hooker that she flees 
to the bathroom and escapes the ensuing massacre by throwing up.  Later on, 
though, she's more than willing to repay Li for his gift of a couple of 
bags of shrimp chips with the only coin she has at her disposal.
We meet Inspector Richard (this movie is shot in France with French 
people, but everybody speaks English, and the inspector isn t even Ree-shar 
, he s just plain Richard) in the act of pounding a helpless man to death 
with his fists in a hotel kitchen, so we are left with no doubts as to his 
badness.  We quickly see where this badness is headed he plans to frame the 
Chinese cop for a few of his brutal killings, but Li escapes with a 
computer disc containing visual evidence of Richard s guilt.  Boy, is he mad!
For the rest of the movie Richard has the entire Paris police force 
out after Li.  The cops spend most of their time annihilating everything in 
sight with automatic weapons, Hong Kong movie style.  Hotels, bridges, 
cars, bateaux mouches, sewers, shops, and police headquarters are reduced 
to powder.  There s more broken glass than you'd find at a Russian New Year's
Eve party.  They do show a little restraint with the gunfire when they 
get the drop on Li at a girl s orphanage, which I thought showed a nice 
touch of delicacy.  Li fights back with hands, feet, the occasional 
firearm, and a wrist band of little acupuncture needles that he uses 
expertly for good or ill and never for more ill than in the forbidden Kiss 
of the Dragon.
Li moves through it all with the look of a jaded Puritan minister, 
black-clad and joyless. His martial arts moves are phenomenal, but without 
a story or a sense of style to give them purpose they lose their power to 
entertain.

Directed by Chris Nahon.
Cast: Jet Li, Bridget Fonda, Tcheky Karyo, Ric Young, Burt Kwouk, Laurence 
Ashley.
2001 - 95 minutes
Rated R (for violence, profanity, sexual situations, and gore).
Reviewed by Dustin Putman, July 6, 2001.
Chris Nahon's Jet Li vehicle, "Kiss of the Dragon," makes the cardinal sin of 
trying to persuade the viewer that it is more that it actually is. Setting 
aside time to attempt character development and a deep emotional core, the 
film, instead, flounders in desperately overwrought dialogue and one of the 
most incomprehensible plots since 2000's "Battlefield Earth."
Jet Li stars as Liu Jiuan, a Beijing cop who has traveled to Paris to aid in 
a police raid against a heroin smuggler. When the head of Paris' police 
department, Richard (Tcheky Karyo), ends up murdering the suspect, as well as 
a prostitute, in a hotel room and setting Liu up as the murderer, it is up to 
Liu to escape suspicions and seek revenge on the crooked cops behind the 
operation. Giving Liu an added reason to go after them, Liu meets Jessica 
(Bridget Fonda), a mother-turned-drug-addict/hooker whose daughter is being 
held hostage by Richard.
The motives behind what Richard, the archenemy, does throughout is both 
muddled and never explained. For instance, why is he trying to frame Liu for 
murder when he has just met him? And why does Richard insist that Jessica 
must remain a prostitute or have her young daughter be killed? Furthermore, 
why was Liu sought out in Paris from Beijing for a simple drug bust? Action 
movies, especially those that work as an exciting thrill-ride, do not always 
require stringent logic, but "Kiss of the Dragon" is so flawed on the story 
level that it can't be taken seriously for even one moment. 
As for the vital action and martial arts sequences, the best that can be said 
about them is that they are well-choreographed, and often very violent and 
bloody. Their innovation level is close to nil, however, and seldom exciting. 
The thought of the very small Liu taking on a whole room full of martial arts 
students, leaving all of them pounded to the floor but without a scratch on 
himself, is ridiculous even for this genre of film.
Jet Li (2000's "Romeo Must Die") is adequate as the wronged Liu, but his 
English isn't very good, and this bars him from being able to express his 
character's feelings clearly. As a woman who simply wants her daughter back, 
but has found herself stuck in a grimy life of prostitution and needles 
shoved through her veins, Bridget Fonda (1999's "Lake Placid") is so much 
better than this movie. It's actually a bit disheartening seeing the usually 
very bright Fonda stuck in an unattractive role that has her saying the most 
godawful dialogue this side of a cheesy '80s slasher flick. Rounding out the 
three main players, Tcheky Karyo (2000's "The Patriot") grunts and narrows 
his eyes on cue as the incumbently vicious Richard.
Ineptly directed by newcomer Chris Nahon and written by the usually reliable 
Luc Besson (1994's "The Professional") and Robert Mark Kamen, "Kiss of the 
Dragon" may pass as a minor divergence for hard-core action fans, but 
everyone else should stay away. With a script that is a mess of cliches and 
bad drama, and not one scene that has the ability to get your heart racing, 
you have been officially warned.

I didn't think Rush Hour 2 was coming out until August, so imagine my
surprise to see it in theatres in early July.  It wasn't nearly as funny as
the first one, but all of other the important components were there - the
little Asian man who can't talk the English too good, his annoying,
marginally talented sidekick, and a whole bunch of kicking, punching,
gunplay and explosions.  But I think Chris Tucker has contracted that
strange disease that made Michael Jackson white.  And his voice seems to
have gotten a bit lower, too.
What?  That wasn't Tucker and Jackie Chan?  My apologies.
Okay, I've got it now.  The film I saw must have been a re-release of Luc
Besson's The Professional, which is about a lethal killing machine with a
heart of gold who tries to rescue a young, innocent girl from the evil
clutches of a corrupt rogue cop, played by Gary Oldman.  And at the end,
there's a great scene where the good guy storms the police station with no
help and raises all kinds of hell.  Remember?  It was Natalie Portman's
first big film.
Huh?  It wasn't The Professional, either?  But it had Besson's name in the
credits and everything.
Oh, yeah.  It's Kiss of the Dragon, and Besson is only a producer and
screenwriter (rookie Chris Nahon directs).  The good guy isn't Jean Reno,
but rather Romeo Must Die's Jet Li, who came up with the idea for this film
all on his own.  He plays Liu Jian, China's top government agent who, as the
film opens, has embarked on a top-secret mission in Paris.  The French
customs officer asks if he is there for business or pleasure, and Liu
answers, "Pleasure," even though we know he's all business.
Liu's operation involves participating in the protection of some Asian
bigwig in conjunction with the Parisian police, headed by Richard (Tchéky
Karyo, The Patriot).  But it's all a big setup - in an unnecessarily
complicated opening, a murder occurs, and Liu unwittingly becomes Richard's
patsy.  We don't know who the stiff is, or why Liu needed to protect him. We
don't know why Richard wanted to snuff him, either.  So how come everything
is such a big secret?  Because the script is lousy.  The answers to these
questions don't matter one bit, and, therefore, are never answered.
In the meantime, Liu befriends a recovering junkie/whore named Jessica
(Bridget Fonda, Monkeybone), whose young daughter is being held hostage by
Richard, who also happens to be Paris' top pimp.  With her street
connections and his bracelet full of acupuncture needles, the two form an
unstoppable pair.  Yeah, I said acupuncture needles.  Liu uses them to
incapacitate his enemies.  Seriously.
Although everything takes place against a lovely Parisian backdrop (which is
nicely shot by Besson's cinematographer Thierry Arbogast), most of Dragon is
laughably bad.  Like Romeo, Li's action sequences are so choppy, you can't
tell what he's doing (as opposed to Jackie Chan's films).  If you edit a
scene enough, you could make Walter Matthau look like a black belt.  Karyo
has fun chewing up the scenery, but he's yet another one of this summer's
non-threatening bad guys.  He's French - how scary can he be?  And Fonda,
the kiss of death for any prospective hit, simply takes up space.
Ironically, she starred in Point of No Return, the American remake of
Besson's Le Femme Nikita.
1:40 - R for strong violence, language, some sexuality and drug content

"I would appreciate it if you didn't do that again."
Starring Jet Li, Bridget Fonda, Tchéky Karyo, Burt
Kwouk. Directed by Chris Nahon. Rated R.
It's no secret that martial arts film often use their
plot simply to get from one action sequence to
another. When the fight scenes are enough to justify
paying admission, there is no problem with this, as in
most Jackie Chan projects and a lot of the Hong Kong
actioners. When they aren't, well, we're in bad shape.
Kiss of the Dragon, Jet Li's second consecutive
American misfire, plays like one big miscalculation,
and fails even as the most rudimentary entertainment.
Now before I start getting e-mails angrily touting the
genius of Jet Li, let me explain myself. Li is as
spectacular as ever here, and I don't think anyone
would ever dare call his martial-arts-star skills into
question. The problem isn't with him, it's with the
movie's tone. The much touted fight-scenes here are
filmed with such unflinching, unrelenting brutality
that they are unpleasant to watch. They're joyless,
perfuctory; Li's rogue Chinese detective is more of a
killing machine than a hero, a Terminator with a black
belt instead of a metal skeleton. But even the
Terminator in Judgement Day had a sympathetic side.
The plot isn't relevant, but if you're curious, it's
some nonsense about a Chinese law enforcement officer
(Li) sent to Paris to investigate a possible drug ring
and encounter a corrupt Chief of Police (Tcheky
Karyo), who kills people and does sinister things with
no motivation whatsoever. Oh yeah, and Li's character
is also an acupuncture expert who is able to ease pain
and/or kill at the touch of a needle. "Kiss of the
Dragon" is the name of an acupuncture maneuver, in
which you stick a needle in a precise location on the
back of the victim's neck, somehow redirecting all of
the body's bloodflow to the brain and killing the poor
sap more or less immediately.
There's a vague attempt to humanize Li by having him
fall in love with a downtrodden prostitute, whose
daughter is being held hostage, for some reason, by
the villain. This is one of the worst love stories I
have ever seen on screen, even worse than the one in
Pearl Harbor. There's no conviction whatsoever as the
movie barely pays lip service to it; it's only here
because someone apparently thought there should be
some kind of boy-meets-girl subplot.
Kiss of the Dragon was written by Luc Besson, whose
screenplay The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc,
for all of that film's flaws, was at least thoughtful.
I don't know why the guy got himself involved in this
train wreck, but perhaps he wanted to so something
more mainstream after the neverending weirdness of The
Fifth Element and the aforementioned stylized biopic.
I suppose you could call this mainstream, but I'll
choose the bizarre any time of the day.
If action scenes in a movie are going to be brutal
instead of dazzling, you need a story to justify
watching them. The filmmakers behind Kiss of the
Dragon should have rethought their strategy. No one
will walk out of this misbegotten project smiling, but
I hear Rush Hour 2 is coming in just a few weeks.

PLOT:
Jet Li is a Chinese cop asked to help some French policemen nab a bad 
guy. But one thing leads to another, and the next thing you know, Li's 
being chased by the same French cops with whom he was supposed to be 
working. A lot of ass-kicking, face-whippings, gun fights and...okay, a 
little more ass-kicking ensues.
CRITIQUE:
Very cool! Now here's a movie that gives you exactly what you're looking 
for, if what you're looking for is kickass action, a palpable good 
cop/bad cop story line, some hardcore stunts and Jet Li slam-dunking 
everyone in sight! The film also moves fast (a mere 95 minutes), 
develops a certain "cute" chemistry between Fonda and Li, has nice 
surroundings (Paris, baby!) and gives us one of the best bad guys that 
I've seen all year. Tcheky Karyo is the devil incarnate in this film. He 
is pure evil. They should have called this movie BAD LIEUTENANT 2 as 
Keitel has nothing on this man. What a great, great monster! My favorite 
line of Tcheky's was when Li was explaining the whole "kiss of the 
dragon" thing to him and he cut him off by saying "kiss my ass!" Pure 
action movie poetry. Anyway, other than him, Jet Li also handled his 
"acting" pretty well in this film, with very little real dialogue to 
say, but enough to make us believe his character. Actually, just looking 
into the man's eyes generally tells you a lot. Fonda was also pretty 
good, despite playing one of the most trashy and abused women that I 
have seen in quite some time, but I still felt kinda bad for her, so I 
guess she did her job okay.
But in the end, nobody goes to see this kind of movie for Oscar 
performances. We go to see Jet Li movies because we want to see Jet Li 
kicking a lot of ass from side to side, and this film delivers 
gangbusters on that front. And yes...they have no wire-fu in this 
movie...I say again...no wire-work, no bullshit stunts with Li floating 
around in mid-air for over a minute. It's all straight action, fist to 
fist, boot to face and all around cool stunts. If that's what you're 
looking for, I don't see how you will be disappointed with this film. 
Yes, it's not very original in plot (just take Luc Besson's own LA FEMME 
NIKITA and mix in plenty of his own THE PROFESSIONAL et voila!), does 
have an annoying hip-hoppy soundtrack that just got on my nerves after a 
while (I also would have gotten rid of the whole acupuncture thang...) 
and will have anyone not willing to restrain their disbelief, rolling 
their eyes all over the place. But was I entertained? Thoroughly. Does 
the film feature more gunplay, martial arts and over-the-top kills that 
most recent action flicks? Yes, again. Does this sound interesting to 
you? Well, the answer to that question is entirely up to you. One thing 
that I would definitely recommend is, as Jet Li pointed out himself on 
his website, that you leave the kids at home for this one. In fact, you 
might even wanna leave yourself if you can't handle the more violent of 
sequences. All in all, a rippin', roarin' fun time!

   In one of the opening scenes of this martial arts action drama,
a Parisian makes the patronizing point to Jet Li--who had just
arrived from Beijing--that French history doesn't amount to a hill
of beans compared to the chronicles of China.   You may or may
not believe this but as you watch Jet Li in action in the role of
China's top government police agent, Liu Jian, you might easily
go along with the notion that this guy of medium height and build
could be the finished product of China's long and often glorious
record.  Liu Jian works awfully hard to make his presence felt
knocking out lights in the City of Lights and while he's China
leading maestro of martial arts, he's also skilled in the science of
magic.  When he's not literally kicking up a storm, he's doing
some awfully strange things with his acupuncture needles, which
in the picture serve as double-edged swords for both their
curative powers and their capacity to inflict suffering on the
enemy.   The ultimate magic of these needles is their ability to
deliver the kiss of the dragon, which makes its ironic, less-than-
amorous appearance at the very end of the film.
   The story--such as it is--opens at the customs booth at Orly
International Airport as an sinister-looking passport inspector
asks Liu  his purpose in visiting France.  When Liu answers
simply "pleasure" (because he's no way in the same class as
James Bond, who'd say, "Pleasure: is there any other?"), we can
believe that what the typical foreign tourist considers fun is not
breaking up a sinister gang of murderous criminals led by French
police Inspector Richard (Tcheky Karyo).  Liu has been sent by
his government in Beijing to assist the French police in protecting
a member of his nationality, but when that official tells the two
hookers who have been assigned to make his visit pleasant, 
"send me to heaven," he did not have in mind the same type of
travel that Richard had planned for him.  When the police
inspector turns out to be somewhat worse than Javert--a
downright killer, super-pimp and more--Liu is in for the adventure
of his life: at least until his next movie opens in a year or so.
   The "Kiss of the Dragon" is a violent tale involving Uzis,
flamethrowers, grenades, and of course the supernatural limbs of
its hero as well as his trusty needles.  "Kiss" involves Bridget
Fonda as well in the role of Jessica, a North Dakotan who when
asked how she wound up as a Paris streetwalker, explains to Liu
that some guy she was with spoke a beautiful French to her and,
well, that explains everything.  The movie suffers from a plot that
is more difficult to understand than the intrigue of Alain Resnais'
"Last Year at Marienbad," but no one in the audience except for
some elitist critics expects much of a storyline: we're here for the
action.  Do we get it?  Not really.  We're not sure that Liu can
easily knock out an army of twenty black belts whom he meets in
a building and who happily take him on, but Liu has the benefit of
one good friend to help him: Marco Cave, who is the most
powerful man in the movie.  Who's he?  The editor, of course,
whose assistance enables Liu not only to polish off an army of
guys in karate outfits, a pair of gigantic blond twins (Cyril Raffaelli
and Diddier Azoulay), to dodge an avenging hand grenade and a
threatening firestorm, and to outrace 157 bullets directed at him
from a variety of marksmen.  
   Not even Bridget Fonda comes off looking good in this generic
actioner, and director Chris Nahon must be quite an
accomplished director to realize a feat like that.  What's more
we're hard put to believe that the great Luc Besson, who gave us
the thrilling "La Femme Nikita" (which evolved in the American
"Point of No Return" starring Bridget Fonda in a far better role)
and "The Professional," which laid out the story of a hit man
(Jean Reno) made into a gentle dude while taking care of a
young orphaned girl.  But Jet Li does his best in a film that gives
him not a single line of humorous or witty dialogue and, even
harder to believe, not even arch-villain Richard--who at one point
threatens only half-heartedly to put Jessica's five-year-old
daughter to work in a Parisian Red Light district--gets to say a
single sentence to evoke an audience sneer.
