     There's a playful absurdity to SUDDEN DEATH that wouldn't be 
out of place in a John Woo movie.  Sure, the plot--about a lone 
fireman (Jean-Claude Van Damme) in a terrorist-held hockey rink--
is a rip-off of DIE HARD, but the over-the-top approach could have 
come straight from Hong Kong.  Of course, director Peter Hyams 
(TIMECOP) is no John Woo.  (Or, for that matter, even a Robert 
Rodriguez.) He can't construct a tightly choreographed fist-fight 
to save his life.  What Hyams *is* good at, though, is the *big* 
stuff:  impressive aerial shots of the Pittsburgh Civic Arena, 
surrounded on all sides by the flashing lights of emergency 
vehicles.  Or the in-your-face hockey footage that is juxtaposed 
through- out the film.  (The plot has the Vice President held 
hostage during a Stanley Cup playoff.)
     Hyams liabilities as a lean-and-mean action director are 
evident in the very first scene.  Cut to a residential 
neighborhood, where Van Damme's character, a Pittsburg firefighter, 
is trapped inside a working house fire.  The short sequence is 
staged with no more finesse than your average TV movie and that's a 
sign for us.  We know, in those first few minutes, that the rest of 
the action is going to be only OK.  Not great, just OK.  (The later 
"oohs" and "aahs" you hear are from those who have never seen the 
good stuff, such as John Woo's HARD TARGET, made with Van Damme in 
1993.)
     With the visceral impact diluted, the incentive to keep 
watching comes from the honest humor--which is unusually generous 
for a film of this sort--and the parody.  Or is it self-parody?  
Who can tell where to draw the line after watching a free-for-all 
kitchen brawl between Van Damme and a woman in a mascot suit?  When 
a giant penguin tries to push our hero's head into a deep-fat 
fryer, we know not to take things too seriously.  SUDDEN DEATH is 
not a dumb movie, per se, but it is dumb fun.  So, relax and roll 
with the punches.  After all, this *is* a hockey game.  (Rated 
"R"/~110 min.)

     The "DIE HARD formula" rears its head several times each year, 
sometimes with great success (SPEED), but more often as a miserable 
failure (UNDER SIEGE 2).  SUDDEN DEATH, a DIE HARD meets BLACK SUNDAY 
action flick with Jean-Claude Van Damme playing the hero, falls squarely 
in the latter category.  Even the weakest entry of Bruce Willis' trilogy 
(this year's DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE) was markedly better than SUDDEN 
DEATH.
     Admittedly, any DIE HARD clone is going to demand a heavy dose of 
the ever-popular "suspension of disbelief".  However, there's a 
significant difference between accepting a few contrived plot devices 
and being asked to swallow a storyline that is utterly preposterous and 
implausible.  Nothing in SUDDEN DEATH makes any sense, and there are 
times when the action is so outlandish that the film moves into the 
realm of self-parody.  About the best thing that can be said about this 
movie is that the action scenes, directed by Peter Hyams (OUTLAND), are 
choreographed with flair.  Unfortunately, the material connecting them 
is worthless.
     Van Damme plays the typical John McLane-type hero:  some down-on-
his-luck guy who gets stuck in the crossfire when a nastier-than-nasty 
bad guy (suavely essayed by Powers Boothe) decides to take some 
hostages.  In this case, our villain chooses game 7 of the Stanley Cup 
Finals at Pittsburgh's Civic Arena to spring his trap.  His hostages -- 
in addition to every man, woman, and child in the stands -- include the 
Vice President and Van Damme's daughter (Whittni Wright).  If a huge sum 
of money isn't transferred into his numbered bank accounts, he's going 
to start killing people -- first one or two, then everybody attending 
the game.
     While trying to stop Boothe's Foss, Van Damme gets to fulfill a 
fantasy:  defend the Penguins' goal at a critical juncture of the game.  
Never mind that no one, including his teammates, recognizes he's not the 
real goalie, or that he's supposed to be finding and defusing bombs 
instead of slapping around a puck on the ice.  If this seems like the 
scene from THE NAKED GUN where Leslie Nielsen impersonates an umpire, 
it's probably just a coincidence, although both films have about the 
same level of believabilty in these instances.
     Hard as it may be to accept, Van Damme has finally found a cast 
that acts on his guttural level.  Powers Boothe looks as if he could 
care less about the role, and appears content to do the absolute minimum 
to cash his check.  He's neither sinister nor menacing, and doesn't 
offer a single biting one-liner.  The young actors playing Van Damme's 
children are awful and Raymond J. Barry's Vice President is a walking, 
talking cliche.  There's nothing interesting about any of these 
characters, and no real reason to care whether they live or die.  For a 
movie trying to build suspense through the dynamics of character 
relationships, that's a fatal flaw.
     Simply put, SUDDEN DEATH is a bad movie.  Although not quite as 
unwatchable as two of this year's similar entries -- MONEY TRAIN and 
UNDER SIEGE 2 -- the film has virtually nothing to recommend it to 
anyone who allows their brain to continue functioning while in the 
audience.  Deriving shallow enjoyment from SUDDEN DEATH's poorly-acted, 
extravagantly absurd series of predictable action sequences demands one 
of three characteristics: an irrational fondness for Van Damme, a love 
of stale, artless films, or an unhealthy tendency towards masochistic 
experiences.  This particular DIE HARD clone comes dead on arrival.

     SUDDEN DEATH is a Jean Claude Van Damme action film.  If you feel
like a DIE HARD II type of movie and are ready to switch your brain to
autopilot, this movie will provide an acceptable time at the Bijou.
Sometimes after a hard week at work, you want a little fast paced
albeit highly implausible compendium of chases and shoot 'em ups.
     It's the seventh game of the Stanley Cup playoffs.  Darren McCord
(Jean Claude Van Damme) is an ex-firefighter who quite years ago after
a frightening rescue attempt of a small girl.  He is now a fire
inspector at the big dome stadium where the game will be played.  He
has two tickets so he takes his son (Ross Malinger) and daughter
(Whittni Wright) to the game with him.
     At the game, renegade government operative Joshua Foss (Powers
Boothe) breaks into the box of the Vice President of the United States.
He calls the president and demands that he transfer zillions of dollars
to foreign banks or he will kill people at the end of each period and
then kill everyone in the stadium at the end of the game.  Think about
the title, and you can write most of the rest of the movie yourself
without Gene Quintano's simplistic script.  Most of the movie consists
of McCord single-handedly disarming the bombs while Foss's large team
of bad guys try to stop him.
     The director (Peter Hyams) has a Spartan approach that sticks to
action (read killing) without much worry about plausibility.  I never
realized how many ways there are to kill people in a kitchen.  The
lines are broadly written and sometimes funny.  When the Vice President
asks Foss what he wants, Foss replies, "What do I want? World peace, an
end to bigotry, and no more mini-malls."  The pacing by editor Steven
Kemper is clean and crisp.
     This movie is pure escapism and action scenes.  Think of it as DIE
HARD II crossed with BLACK SUNDAY.  If that is what you want, you could
worse that SUDDEN DEATH.  Every once and a while, play-by-play
announcer Mike Lange would come on with such tidbits as, "He hit his
head on the ice.  He hit it so hard that his kids will be born dizzy."
Not particularly original, but funny nevertheless.
     I find Jean Claude Van Damme a strange actor.  He does not have
the charisma of a Steven Seagal or the energy of a Bruce Lee and yet
his low key approach to killing bad guys holds a certain fascination no
matter how ridiculous.  Powers Boothe is always good as an evil figure
and here he gives his standard performance.  The best scene of all, and
one worthy of a much higher quality movie, is the one where Van Damme
gets to suit up and go on the ice.  It is wonderful.
     SUDDEN DEATH runs 1:50.  It is rated R for massive violence which
sometimes makes you squeamish but more often is more cartoonish than
anything.  After you see scores of people killed with little small
bullet holes in the head, it becomes more unreal than frightening.  I
think the show is acceptable for teenagers if they are mature.  I can
not bring myself to recommend SUDDEN DEATH, but it did provide a nice
diversion albeit a totally forgettable one.  I give the film **.
Opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's.

Starring Jean-Claude Van Damme; Powers Boothe; Raymond J. Barry & Whittni
Wright
The Muscles from Brussels is back. This time good old Jean-Claude Van Damme
plays a fire marshal who just happens to be assigned to check the arena for
fire violations before an N.H.L. playoff game. Now this normally would not
be much of a basis for a movie. (Not even a Van Damme movie.) If you throw
in the fact that the Vice President of the United States is going to be in
attendance at this game, and then add a few terrorists to the whole mix, you
may have the ingredients for a half decent little action thriller. Maybe.
Powers Boothe plays Joshua Foss, a terrorist who decides that he wants a
little cash. He figures the best way to do that is by taking over the
private box that the Vice President is watching the game from by using men
with big guns. Just to make sure he has everyone's attention he wires the
whole arena with explosives. If anyone tries to get in or out of the arena,
they are in for a little surprise.
Now back to our hero. Well good old Jean-Claude's character, Darren McCord,
has taken his two kids to see the game while he does whatever it is fire
inspectors do during a hockey game. As bad timing would have it, he manages
to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and it is up to him to
single-handedly save everyone in the building, including the Vice President,
assorted dignitaries and his two kids. The burning question here is -- Gee,
will he manage to do it? Well, I'm pretty sure that you can take a wild stab
at that one.
Maybe I'm being a little hard on the plot line, but it deserves it. As
original as this idea is, and to the writers credit it is an original idea,
they just take it waaaay over the top here. I'm not going to give anything
away but lets just say there is really no need of our intrepid fire marshal
getting into hand to hand combat on the peak of the roof of the stadium.
All right, I've made my cracks. If you can get by the total lack of
believability in the plot you will find Jean-Claude giving one of his best
performances to date. (Let's face it, if you enjoy this type of film you
realize that in most cases plot is an afterthought at the best of times.) We
still aren't talking a possible best actor nomination here, but his acting
skills do seem to be getting better. Powers Boothe is great as the villain.
While he is truly evil, somehow you have to like him. It's a shame Boothe
isn't more widely recognized for his work, or for that matter given better
roles, since he is always a lot if fun to watch on screen.
I've got a few other beefs with this film. One of them is a subplot
involving how Van Damme's character came to become a fire inspector. As a
firefighter a child died as he was trying to save her, and he hasn't been
the same since. I really don't know why this story line was included in the
film. Perhaps it was to make him more sympathetic and make us root for him
against the bad guys all that much harder. Although I was left asking why
are they wasting my time on this crap?
In the end I would say that I would probably recommend this film to Van
Damme fans or to those who just love action flicks regardless of the
questionable writing. To everyone else out there, I would have to say that
there are better Van Damme films out there. If you are in the mood for the
"one guy takes on as bunch of terrorists" theme -- rent the original
Diehard.
