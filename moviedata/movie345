Chad'z rating: ***1/2 (out of 4 = very good)
1971, R, 136 minutes [2 hours, 16 minutes]
starring: Malcolm McDowell (Alex), Patrick Magee (Mr. Frank Alexander),
Anthony Sharp (Minister of the Interior), Michael Bates (Chief Guard),
written, produced, and directed by Stanley Kubrick, based on the novel by
Anthony Burgess.
"A Clockwork Orange" may be the epitome of the idea of portraying a theme
through allegory. The only problem is that sometimes the allegory becomes
blatant, but the story told is still interesting because of its bizarre
nature. 
The film takes place in an alternate reality, where crime is out of control
and technology seems both advanced yet ancient at the same time. We don't
know how the world got this way, it is just implied and assumed as Gothic,
sci-fi tale. 
We meet the four "Droogs" as lead by Alex (McDowell), a sadistic hoodlum
with a sharp wit and quick reflexes. The Droogs go around beating up bums for
pleasure, fighting with other gangs simply because of rivalry, and have even
more fun by storming the countryside and raping a woman while forcing her
husband to look on. This is a very disturbing picture, not in just the
graphicness, but because of the pleasure they take in their actions. Kubrick
uses this to emphasize the human element by paradoxically dehumanizing the
characters.
A "Julius Ceaser" plot develops when the Droogs betray Alex and lead him to
be captured by the police. Almost instantly the film starts to lose its
artistic edge, as everything seems "normal" compared to the surrealistic
opening. Alex is sentenced to prison, but we don't get a surrealistic, brutal
image of prison. Instead, Alex studies with the prison chaplin, and reads the
Old Testament because of its many violent tales of war.  
The real theme of the story starts to develop when Alex volunteers for a
psychological "cure" created by the government to reduce crime. The
treatment's premise seems promising, as it will subconsciously stop Alex from
committing crime, but in effect, he loses his sense of true free will. Some
will argue man has no free will to begin with, and this film serves as a
battleground for such philosophical arguments.
When Alex finds himself wandering the streets, the earlier Gothic mood seems
to be gone. Through a series of events that are almost mirror images of the
beginning of the story, Alex becomes the victim. 
As moving as "A Clockwork Orange" is, it could have been even more powerful
had it not be so gratuitous in some respects. I found the much of the nudity
and sexual innuendo quite excessive. I loved the dark, twisted mood that
opens the film, but why wasn't the atmosphere as surrealistic throughout?
Still, the film's ability to make for such a grand theme despite its shock
value is remarkable.

"A Clockwork Orange" has created more diverse reactions in audiences and 
critics alike than in any other Stanley Kubrick film. Even Kubrick himself 
was outraged at how the film induced copycat incidents in Great Britain, 
causing him to ban the film until his death (now it has been re-released 
since Stanley died in March of 1999). Despite how others feel about the film, 
in my estimation, this is the greatest film ever made about the nature of 
violence, and the nature of behavior and moral choice in a clockwork society. 
It is as relevant and awe-inspiring and as intellectually charged today as 
any other film since on the subject.
Alex, the punk, the Droog, remains the most ironic, complex, and sympathetic 
antihero in the history of the cinema. As played by Malcolm McDowell, he is 
vicious, murderous but also a lover of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. He also 
has nude paintings in his bedroom, has masturbatory fantasies to the tune of 
Beethoven with images from the movies (and himself as Dracula). Alex loves 
his working-class parents, his boa constrictor, and supposedly goes to school 
- he seems like a delightful lad you would see in your neighborhood on an 
"azure sky of deepest summer." There is only one difference - Alex has a 
knack, a love, for sex and violence. He has a creative imagination but it is 
fueled by his violent-proned rages - he seems to take delight in killing 
people. 
At the beginning of the film, in stunning close-up, we see Alex at the Korova 
Milkbar with his fellow Droogs drinking some milk substance that can "sharpen 
you up and get you ready for a bit of the old ultraviolence." Their nightly 
activities consist of beating up old winos in dark alleys, attacking people 
in their homes, driving like madmen on the roads, having sex with women they 
pick up in record stores, and it is usually all to the tune of Beethoven's 
lovely Ninth. These Droogs dress in white, have ripped-out eyeball 
ornamentations on their cuffs, and often wear masks with phallic, Pinocchio 
noses. Kubrick shows us quite a bit of violence in the first half-hour but he 
has more up his sleeve as the film continues. 
Alex is eventually caught by the police after being betrayed by his fellow 
Droogs (he is hit in the nose with a milk bottle). Once in prison, he gets 
wind of a "Ludovico technique" where a prisoner is subjected to a 
rehabilitative process that results in getting out of prison in no time at 
all. Alex wants to do good or, as he says, "one act of goodness." The prison 
chaplain (Godfrey Quigley) tells Alex that the technique has not been tested 
much and is considered dangerous. As the chaplain explains, "Goodness comes 
from within - goodness, is chosen. When a man cannot choose, he ceases to be 
a man." Alex doesn't comprehend such ideas, and decides to take part in the 
technique at all costs. He gets his chance when the Minister of the Interior 
(Anthony Sharp), who is looking for criminals to participate in such a 
technique, chooses Alex whom he considers ruthless, smart, and enterprising. 
In what remains surely the most perfectly realized scenes in the film, Alex 
is strapped to a chair with clamps that keeps his eyelids pried open as he is 
forced to watch violent film footage - at first, he enjoys it but slowly he 
becomes nauseous and sickly. Alex is becoming conditioned not just against 
violence but everything else he enjoys, including Beethoven's Ninth. 
So what is Kubrick trying to say? That in a clockwork, mechanized society, we 
have no rights - we must remain aligned with what is expected? All people who 
rebel are killers? Alex does not fit into society, he is in fact a rebel, 
allowing himself to choose violence over nonviolence because that is what 
makes him tick. Removing his instinctive behavior is not human - it is the 
result of a dehumanizing society and Alex is as human, direct and joyous as 
anyone else in the film, including the victims. 
Even in today's jaded world of ubiquitous sex and violence, "A Clockwork 
Orange" is still potent stuff - as disturbing now as it was in 1971. The 
reason is threefold: we, the audience, can't help but like Alex because he is 
so charming and ruthless despite his murderous ways. We are also asked to 
identify with him because we feel he is wronged by society and by the 
higher-ups who are abusing him and using him for political ambition. And yet 
Alex is not really cured, we sense he will go back to his violent self. 
The violence is both stylized and realistic. It is shown in slow-motion, 
time-lapse motion, and sometimes "viddied with the red, red vino on tap." 
When Alex kills his victims, it is shown at a remove, a distance from which 
we become observers particularly the attack on Alex (Patrick Magee), the 
Leftist writer, and his wife (Adrienne Corri), to the tune of "Singin' in the 
Rain." When Alex is attacked by his own droogs (who ironically become 
policemen) or by other higher-ups, it is realistic and bloody, with none of 
the enjoyment of "action and performance" that Alex feels when he inflicts 
pain or kills. 
Lastly, the film suggests that Alex cannot be changed by the Ludovico 
technique - his survival instinct is violence, it is what makes him a person. 
A moral choice cannot be made, as the prison chaplain says, because you 
cannot change a person's behavior. A liberal view to be sure but a 
justifiable view nonetheless.
"A Clockwork Orange" is terrifying, scary, witty, exciting, funny, and 
exhausting. It is Kubrick's most cinematic odyssey: beautifully shot and 
choreographed with almost monochromatic tones, and occasionally bursting with 
some bright, vivid colors of red and black justaxposed with blue and white.  
Malcolm McDowell gives what may be the seminal performance of any Kubrick 
film - exuding charm, arrogance and cleverness in the face of a callow, 
youthful killer. What's disturbing and provoking even today about the film is 
that Alex wants to retain his moral right to be bad. And we can't help but 
feel he is right.

A retrospective movie review by Walter Frith
Member of the 'Internet Movie Critics Association'
http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Studio/5713/index.html
Stanley Kubrick certainly has established himself as the master of
'dehumanization' in the medium of film.  His mechanics as a filmmaker
have made for better social commentary than almost any other attempt by
any director in the history of movies.  Kubrick's films are scarce.
Since 1975, he has only made three of them.  'Barry Lyndon' in 1975,
'The Shining' in 1980 and his last film, 'Full Metal Jacket', was made
over a decade ago, in 1987.  Scheduled for release sometime in 1998 is
his latest film, 'Eyes Wide Shut' with Tom Cruise.  Cruise has worked
well with other legendary directors such as Martin Scorsese and Oliver
Stone, so it will be interesting seeing Cruise work with a director not
known for choosing big stars in his productions.  I suppose Jack
Nicholson in 'The Shining' and Kirk Douglas in Kubrick's 1960 epic
'Spartacus' qualify as big stars but this is the exception rather than
the rule with Kubrick.
Kubrick had long been a director well ahead of his time.  His theme of
technology running amok has been evident throughout his career.  Look at
'Dr. Strangelove'.  The nuclear arsenal of the United States is
compromised when an insane general uses a loophole in the launch
procedure to carry out his own attack.  Thankfully, something like that
has never happened, but look at other examples.  The malfunction of the
HAL 9000 computer in '2001: A Space Odyssey', a computer trusted
to run the entire mission if the astronauts could not, and presently, in
real life, the millennium bug is plaguing all institutions that the
population relies on for routine service.  If it isn't fixed in less
than 2 years, the world could be in chaos.  The author of 2001, Arthur
C. Clarke, deserves much credit for this idea as well as Kubrick but
somehow Kubrick's visual style of film presentation gives it greater
impact.  What about the Challenger explosion in 1986?  Another prophecy
from Kubrick or simple neglect on the part of the mission controllers?
Any way you look at it, Kubrick is probably more misunderstood in his
storytelling than any other director and you certainly can't accuse him
of copying any other director.  In fact, I can't even think of one
director that Kubrick looks influenced by.  If anything, Kubrick seems
to have a style all his own.
Kubrick adapted Anthony Burgess' novel 'A Clockwork Orange', and
released the film in 1971 to a stunned audience.  Even more shocking to
many at the time was the film's claim to 4 Academy Award nominations
(Best Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Film Editing but
surprisingly no
acting nominations).  This angered many members of the motion picture
academy, particularly the older and more conservative ones who felt the
film was a deplorable exercise in showcasing violence and other ghastly
images of a graphic nature.  As usual, many missed the point with the
release of a Kubrick film.
The message in this film was actually anti-violence.  The story is set
in the future, after 1971.  Perhaps in the late 70's the 80's, the 90's,
or the 21st century.  We are not told. The opening shot focuses on Alex
(Malcolm McDowell).  A slow pullback of the camera commences and we see
another three young men with him.  This opening scene is accompanied by
eerie synthesized music and narration on the part of Alex.  Next, the
four young men, we discover, are a violent gang who, in some of the
film's early scenes, assault an old man, mix it up with a rival gang and
rape a woman in her own home and cripple her husband.  Alex is the
gang's self-proclaimed leader, a smart individual answering to the devil
on his shoulder rather than the angel.  He lives with his parents but
lies to them about his activities and later has a run in with his
juvenile parole officer that the next time he gets caught by the law, it
will be the real prison and not juvenile detention, as was the case in
the past.  His parole officer is a smarmy fellow.  He knows Alex is up
to no good but he can't prove it.  He teases Alex with the possible
consequences of Alex's actions but Alex pays him no mind.
Early in the film, Kubrick uses his camera as a metaphor to the human
experience.  Alex meets two girls in a record shop and takes them home
for some carefree sex.  As the scene begins, we hear the 'William Tell
Overture' and the camera speeds up to its maximum in rather comic
fashion to illustrate the quickness experienced in the joy of sex at the
peak of its most exciting moment.  Later, after a run in with members of
his own gang, Alex shows them who is boss as they are walking on the
waterfront and this time the camera is using slow motion as Alex takes
his walking stick, which he uses as a weapon from time to time, and
smacks one of his own fellow thugs in the crotch.  He then proceeds to
kick him, causing him to fall into the water and as Alex helps him out
of the drink, he cuts the back of his hand with a knife.  The camera's
slow motion effect illustrates the long suffering effects of pain.
Francis Ford Coppola used the effect of slow and fast editing a year
later in 1972's 'The Godfather'.  We see the picture slowly fade from
the movie producer's discovery of a horse's head in his bed to a rather
somber head shot of Don Vito Corleone sitting in his chair at home.
Later, Michael Corleone, acting as the godfather for his sister's son at
a baptism, is seen taking hypocritical vows in church as the editing is
faster, showcasing the murders of rival crime family members.
Alex is fond of classical music, particularly Beethoven.  He is captured
and sent to prison for 14 years after causing the death of a woman in a
robbery.  While he is in prison, he hears of a secret medical procedure
that can turn a person anti-violent.  He volunteers for the experiment,
with catastrophic results.  He is injected with a drug that will make
him immune to violent acts of any kind, and his persona changes as he is
forced to watch, with his eyelids propped up and in a straight jacket,
films of violent acts, both physically and sexually.  This is the key
turning point in the film.  Alex begs the doctors to stop but they say
it's for his own good and that he will be released shortly from prison.
One doctor notes to his colleagues that Alex's discomfort in watching
the films is the "punishment element" of the experiment.  Punishment for
his crimes, no doubt.
When Alex is released from prison, he finds everything in his life has
changed and he runs into some old adversaries, bent on getting revenge
for Alex's past deeds.  He finds that society is even more violent than
he could have imagined, and violence did increase dramatically in real
life society from 1971 on, and continued for many years.  Another
Kubrick prophecy come true?
Kubrick keeps the film light at times with injections of dark humour,
particularly those involving a prison official (Michael Bates), a man
who is captain of the guards and enforces his discipline with military
style tactics.  The scenes with him are among some of the film's most
hilarious moments.
As 'A Clockwork Orange' winds down, the political machinery involved in
Alex's attempted rehabilitation begins to unravel, forcing a deal
between Alex and the government to rectify any wrong doing.  The final
scene is truthful, honest and a real satisfactory way to end a film that
at times is a lacerating satire on society, complete with all the red
hot ingredients to anger and at the same time amuse movie audiences.
Success doing that is rare.

CLOCKWORK ORANGE (director: Stanley Kubrick; writers: adapted from
Anthony Burgess novel/Stanley Kubrick; cinematographer: John Alcott;
cast: Malcolm McDowell (Alex, Head Droog), Patrick Magee (Mr. Frank
Alexander), Warren Clarke (Dim, Droog), James Marcus (Georgie, Droog),
Miriam Karlin (Cat Lady), Anthony Sharp (Minister of the Interior),
Aubrey Morris (P.R. Deltoid), Godfrey Quigley (Prison Chaplain), Michael
Bates (Chief Guard), Paul Farrell (Bum), Sheila Raynor (Mum), Philip
Stone (Dad), Michael Tarn (Pete, Droog), Adrienne Corri (Rape Victim),
UK-1971)
There is something about this chic look at modern English society- one
that is filled with wanton sex, drugs, and violence- that is more
frightening than all the mayhem, perversities, muggings, and rapes it
shows on screen. I think that something has to do with the fear we have
of trusting the young people depicted in the film with the future of the
country. Kubrick moralistically seems to be pointing his finger at the
pillars of the community and at the politicians who are clueless about
what to do about the violence that is seen on an everyday basis, in a
society that appears to be a nihilistic one, where crimes are mainly
committed by youths;  he questions  society's responses to deterring
crime in general: by social reform, organized religion, scientific
experiments, political meddling (from the Right and the Left), and by
making prisons as a solution to society's problems.
That Clockwork Orange  has stood the test of time and is as relevant
seeing in 1999 as it was when it first came out, is a sign that society
has not changed much since that time and that the film has opened up
some skeletons in our closet about how we as a society still can't face
the severity of the problems manifested.
The film is shot in such pleasingly stylish colors, especially the
orange background, whereby the film gets its title from. It is so
visually splendid a film, that it is shameful that we are confronted
with so much violence, as it seems that even the violence as presented
and choreographed is all too entertaining for the grim message it is
trying to deliver. One might be beguiled into expecting a musical film
to be taking place, if one were not aware that Kubrick was the director.
The droogs (McDowell, Clarke, Marcus, & Tarn) as they call themselves,
are sitting in their favorite Korova milk bar hang-out, drinking their
drug-spiked milk and surrounded by white-fiber glass nude furniture and
statues of submissive women kneeling. They are wearing white trousers
and white suspenders to match, with black combat boots and derbies, and
have billyclubs at their sides. Every night, they commit stylized but
meaningless acts of terrorism. Their feeling is that they can take
whatever they want by force. Sex is the old in-and-out thing; if they
want an auto they just steal it, and for someone they don't like, they
just pummel them. These school-age kids do not necessarily come from bad
homes- so why are they so alienated from society, is the million dollar
question.
In the first part of the film, we see a drunken bum (Paul Farrell) get
beaten up for being a bum; a choreographed gang fight; a vicious rape
(Adrienne Corri) and the paralysing of her writer husband (Patrick
Magee); the slaying, with a giant phallus artifact, of a wealthy elitist
woman (Karlin), known as the Catlady, who runs a health farm; and the
fighting for control of the gang among its four members.
The gang leader, Alex de Large (McDowell), lives at the graffiti- ridden
Municipal Flatblock 18a Linear North with his trendy older mum (Sheila
Raynor), sporting purple-dyed hair, and his working-class dadda (Philip
Stone), who do not know how to get Alex properly motivated for school.
The school advisor (Aubrey) is an obvious homosexual, who can't relate
very well to the troubled Alex. Music, in the form of Ludwig Van
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, arouses Alex's love for sex and violence. It
is his theme in life, the very joy of his existence, the inspiration for
his perverse dreams. The other piece of music that plays a large role in
Alex's life, is 'Singin' In The Rain,' which he triumphantly sings
during the rape and is played as the credits roll down at the film's
conclusion, when Alex is supposedly cured; that is, he is able to have
his violent sexual fantasies again.
In this rather cynical and probing look at societal attitudes and what
can only be termed as a dehumanized society that Kubrick sees all around
him, the harshest comments are reserved for the scientific experiments
conducted on Alex, so that he will be conditioned out of his criminal
impulses, where he is serving his fourteen year prison sentence for the
murder of the Catlady. His fellow droogs Georgie (Marcus ) and Dim
(Clarke), upset with his bullying them around, turn the tables on him
and conk him over the head with a milk bottle on that escapade, enabling
the police to get him.
The "experimental therapy" treatment Alex agrees to, that gives the
convicted killer a chance for an early release, is backed by the new
right- wing government in power, as the Machiavellian Minister of the
Interior (Sharp) worms his way into the headlines, hypocritically
claiming that his adminstration will put a stop to the criminal by
controlling his thoughts. When a bad thought comes up, the patient will
experience a severe sick reaction which stops him from doing anything
bad.
Alex reenters society a so-called "changed" man with a physical aversion
to the following: sex, Beethoven's Ninth, and violence. There is a
strong enough reaction to these things to induce a nausea in him. But he
quickly learns that he cannot go back home, that he must pay for his bad
deeds, and in his new journey he re-acquaints himself with that past.
The same bum he once attacked, now gets other bums to rough him up, the
police who help him from this attack are his former cronies Dim and
Georgie, who now take him out into the woods and work him over,
explaining his surprise at their current occupation, by telling him they
are now of age to have such jobs. By mistake, he enters the house of the
writer he once attacked, and will be used by that writer's left-wing
group for political revenge against the government they can't stand.
They get Alex to try and commit suicide to the constant playing of
Beethoven's Ninth. Alex survives his fall with broken bones and the
renewed friendship with the minister, who descries that former
treatment, blaming the doctors who experimented on him for their foolish
plan. Meanwhile he arrests the writer as a political subversive, and
re-conditions Alex to be like before. He does all this so that his party
can keep being in power.
Kubrick's look at society is an unduly pessimistic one. There is
something evil in society, but what to do about it, that is the question
that remains. At least, for Kubrick, we better think about what we are
doing to ourselves, before it is too late. The most frightening part of
the film, was that all the extremes of violence and cultural debasement,
are pretty close to what the norms of society actually are.
I was left feeling unsure of how to take the film's message. Was there a
moral ambiguity exhibited toward the violence? Or, is Kubrick, as a
moralist, pointing his finger at everybody? There just doesn't seem to
be much to think about as alternatives to the way the problem youth was
handled. The film adaption from Anthony Burgess' satiric novel, results
in a pure Kubrick over-indulgent, brilliantly visual and graphic film.
The jargonistic language used (called Nadsat- an onomatopoetic
combination of English, Russian, and slang) made for a most arresting
film, one that can't be put aside without thinking about what kind of
impact it makes on how we view such moral and ethical problems. But I
just don't think we come away knowing anything more about what to do
about these problems than before seeing the film. Nevertheless, I did
find it to be a visual joyride, something that is terrifyingly pertinent
in an eerie sort of way; a memorable film, one that has become ingrained
in our culture and must be looked upon as one of those 'important' films
that one should see. I just didn't think it reached the level of some of
his other masterpieces (2001, Paths of Glory, The Killing, Eyes Wide
Shut, and Dr. Strangelove), that, for me, were on more solid
intellectual footing.

Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange" had to stun
its audiences upon release in 1971.  Like his previous
film, "2001: A Space Odyssey", Kubrick had violated
enough taboos to stretch the envelope of cinema:
what was previously unacceptable could now be done.
The contribution of "Clockwork" wasn't just the explicit
sexual violence and nudity, which had to be somewhat
edited to avoid an 'X' rating, but the film's misanthropic
attitude and bizarre sets.  The film covers sadistic
anarchy, black comedy, and deep cynicism of governmental
power. The whole cast is irredeemable except for the
prison chaplain (Godfrey Quigley), whose task in reforming
hardened criminals is presented as hopeless.
The lead (Alex, played by Malcolm McDowell) brings new
meaning to the term anti-hero.  He is a vicious, sadistic
monster who lives a nighttime fantasy life of beatings,
robbery and rapings, in which he is always the one delivering
the punishment.  As in "2001", a classic score dominates,
with Beethoven giving Alex the inspiration for his criminal
activities, which are luridly and explicitly depicted.
Alex's desire to control his fellow gang members backfires
when he is betrayed by them after committing a murder.
Alex is sentenced to prison, where he pretends to be
a born-again Christian to facilitate his release.
Alex's desire for freedom makes him a volunteer for
a brainwashing experiment, which makes him physically
nauseated when confronted with thoughts of sex or
violence.  Upon release, Alex can't escape his past,
as his former victims delight in their revenge on their
now-helpless past tormentor.
While I don't sympathize with Malcolm's character, I
do feel sorry for Malcolm.  Kubrick puts him through
the works: those eyeball clamps look painful, and it
couldn't have been much fun to lick shoes, get dunked
underwater for who knows how many takes, be trussed up
in a cast, plopped in spaghetti, etc.  Did he have a
stunt double?
Kubrick freely mixes the shocking and ironic with
blatant black humor.  The prison guard character
(Michael Bates) seems out of a Monty Python sketch,
while Malcolm's parents are stupid and maudlin.
Alex has a sculpture depicting a Jesus chorus line,
and commits a murder with a sculpture of a sexual
organ.  Kubrick skewers both conservative and liberal
politics, with the cynical, manipulative Minister
of the Interior (Anthony Sharp) no worse than the
half-mad 'subversive' writer (Patrick Magee).
By the way, there is another film in the American
Film Institute Top 100 that has even more nudity
and violence: "Schindler's List".  Presentation is
everything.

"A Clockwork Orange" has created more diverse reactions in audiences and 
critics alike than in any other Stanley Kubrick film. Even Kubrick himself

causing him to ban the film until his death (now it has been re-released

It is as relevant and awe-inspiring and as intellectually charged today as

Alex, the punk, the Droog, remains the most ironic, complex, and sympathetic 
antihero in the history of the cinema. As played by Malcolm McDowell, he is 
vicious, murderous but also a lover of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. He also 
has nude paintings in his bedroom, has masturbatory fantasies to the tune of

a man." Alex doesn't comprehend such ideas, and decides to take part in the 
technique at all costs. He gets his chance when the Minister of the Interior 
(Anthony Sharp), who is looking for criminals to participate in such a 
technique, chooses Alex whom he considers ruthless, smart, and enterprising. 
In what remains surely the most perfectly realized scenes in the film, Alex 
is strapped to a chair with clamps that keeps his eyelids pried open as he is 
forced to watch violent film footage - at first, he enjoys it but slowly he 
becomes nauseous and sickly. Alex is becoming conditioned not just against 
violence but everything else he enjoys, including Beethoven's Ninth. 
So what is Kubrick trying to say? That in a clockwork, mechanized society, we 
have no rights - we must remain aligned with what is expected? All people who 
rebel are killers? Alex does not fit into society, he is in fact a rebel, 
allowing himself to choose violence over nonviolence because that is what 
makes him tick. Removing his instinctive behavior is not human - it is the 
result of a dehumanizing society and Alex is as human, direct and joyous as 
anyone else in the film, including the victims. 
Even in today's jaded world of ubiquitous sex and violence, "A Clockwork 
Orange" is still potent stuff - as disturbing now as it was in 1971. The 
reason is threefold: we, the audience, can't help but like Alex because he is 
so charming and ruthless despite his murderous ways. We are also asked to 
identify with him because we feel he is wronged by society and by the 
higher-ups who are abusing him and using him for political ambition. And yet 
Alex is not really cured, we sense he will go back to his violent self. 
The violence is both stylized and realistic. It is shown in slow-motion, 
time-lapse motion, and sometimes "viddied with the red, red vino on tap." 
When Alex kills his victims, it is shown at a remove, a distance from which 
we become observers particularly the attack on Alex (Patrick Magee), the 
Leftist writer, and his wife (Adrienne Corri), to the tune of "Singin' in the 
Rain." When Alex is attacked by his own droogs (who ironically become 
policemen) or by other higher-ups, it is realistic and bloody, with none of 
the enjoyment of "action and performance" that Alex feels when he inflicts 
pain or kills. 
Lastly, the film suggests that Alex cannot be changed by the Ludovico 
technique - his survival instinct is violence, it is what makes him a person. 
A moral choice cannot be made, as the prison chaplain says, because you 
cannot change a person's behavior. A liberal view to be sure but a 
justifiable view nonetheless.
"A Clockwork Orange" is terrifying, scary, witty, exciting, funny, and 
exhausting. It is Kubrick's most cinematic odyssey: beautifully shot and 
choreographed with almost monochromatic tones, and occasionally bursting with 
some bright, vivid colors of red and black justaxposed with blue and white.  
Malcolm McDowell gives what may be the seminal performance of any Kubrick 
film - exuding charm, arrogance and cleverness in the face of a callow, 
youthful killer. What's disturbing and provoking even today about the film is 
that Alex wants to retain his moral right to be bad. And we can't help but 
feel he is right.

Review: **** (out of ****)
Dehumanization is at the heart of almost every film by Stanley Kubrick,
but none so much as his masterfully disturbing and ultimately edifying
"A Clockwork Orange." What makes it is troublesome is not the violence
itself, but the film's suggestion that violence is an inherently human
characteristic, and to take that potential away from someone is to, in
effect, make him less than human. That's hardly a pleasant thought, and
you have to wonder if it's the theme of this film, not so much the
actions portrayed on screen, that generated such controversy when it was
first released in 1971.
Through a first person narrative, the film traces the adventures of its
hero Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell), and his gang of Droogs (Warren
Clarke, James Marcus, and Michael Tarn). The film is set in England in
the near future -- a future which vaguely reflects our own, but it seems
that society has started to crumble, and at night the streets are
overrun with teenage gangs who run free of parental control. According
to the original novel by Anthony Burgess, Alex is only 15 years old
(although McDowell as 26 when he played him), which adds an additionally
disturbing dimension to his antics because he is at such a young and
customarily vulnerable age.
The first half hour of the film is a relentless portrayal of a typical
night for Alex's gang. They start off in the Korova milk bar, drinking
drug-laced milk that "sharpens them up for a bit of the old
ultraviolence." After leaving, they happen upon a drunk beggar who they
first ridicule, then beat senseless. They later happen upon a rival
group in the midst of raping a woman, and a gang fight ensues. Still
restless and looking for something to do, Alex and company steal a car,
break into a the isolated home of Frank Alexander (Patrick Magee), and
rape his wife in front of him. Even then, they still go back to the milk
bar for a few more drinks before going home at dawn and sleeping through
school.
Kubrick presents the violence in a dizzying, heightened fashion that
makes it alarmingly attractive. With close, hand-held camera shots, he
invites us to join Alex in raping and pillaging to show that violence
and power are inherently attractive. Alex is like the Freudian id
running free, and that pulls at something in all of us, making this film
all the more uncomfortable because you find yourself sympathizing with
such a morally repugnant person.
Alex's twisted life seems safe and secure, until one night his Droogs
double cross him when he's breaking into a woman's home. During an
attempted rape, he accidentally kills the woman with a giant phallic
statue, and his friends leave him for the police. He is subsequently
arrested, spit on and beat by the cops, and sentenced to prison.
While in prison, he hears of a new reform treatment, and willing to do
anything to get out of the suffocating world of prison life where he can
only dream of violence, Alex volunteers as one of the subjects. The
experimental treatment involves his being strapped to a chair in a movie
theater with his eyes pried open with clamps. He is then given a drug
and forced to watch violent films. The drugs causes him to feel
nauseous, and therefore his body adapts so that any time he is exposed
to anything violent, he becomes sick. He is therefore conditioned
against violence, and as the government proudly points out during an
ironic stage display to prove the success of the treatment, he is the
ultimate in goodness, unable to harm a fly.
And so he is released into the world where he runs into all the people
he harassed as a young hoodlum, including the drunk beggar, the husband
of one of his rape victims, and even his old Droogs who are now corrupt
members of the police. This all feels like contrived plot conveniences,
but "A Clockwork Orange" is really more of a fable than a story. It is
devised entirely to make its point about the nature of free will, and
everything in the film is contrived to work to that end.
Of course, Alex is unable to defend himself in the evil world he helped
create, and he becomes the victim. It is both harshly ironic and
ultimately heartbreaking. He is, as Burgess coined the term, a clockwork
orange -- seemingly a healthy and vital human on the outside, but inside
he is programmed, no longer able to make choices for himself.
Kubrick is single-minded in his goal, and at times the film feels a bit
preachy, especially near the end. But the rest of the film is unnerving
and invigorating in its ability to manipulate the audience. Never has
such a vile character been so charismatic and attractive as Alex.
McDowell's performance is cunning and lethal in its sincerity. He can be
brash, funny, horrifying or sympathetic.
Kubrick never gives Alex any excuses for his behavior -- he just asks us
to accept him as is. Reasons for his behavior are never clearly
explained -- his parents are shown, but they are weak and unguiding,
easily manipulated by Alex's obvious intelligence and craftiness. A
better explanation may come from the society he was raised in, which is
slowly but surely losing its moral fiber, and becoming a military state
with no care or control of its people. The state is so desperate that it
is willing to program its citizens in order to gain control, a sure sign
that they are near the end.
"A Clockwork Orange" continues to be a powerful film, more than
twenty-five years later. The on-screen violence, while probably less
explicit than half the action films shown today, still resonates of true
horror because it is tied to a deeper meaning, not just surface
exhilaration. With its dynamic futuristic set design by John Barry,
pulsating classical music score, and striking visuals by John Alcott
(who also did Kubrick's "2001" and "Barry Lyndon"), this is one of
Kubrick's masterpieces, a film will continue to strike chords and rattle
nerves for years to come.

"A Clockwork Orange" has created more diverse reactions in audiences and 
critics alike than in any other Stanley Kubrick film. Even Kubrick himself 
was outraged at how the film induced copycat incidents in Great Britain, 
causing him to ban the film until his death (now it has been re-released 
since Stanley died in March of 1999). Despite how others feel about the film, 
in my estimation, this is the greatest film ever made about the nature of 
violence, and the nature of behavior and moral choice in a clockwork society. 
It is as relevant and awe-inspiring and as intellectually charged today as 
any other film since on the subject.
Alex, the punk, the Droog, remains the most ironic, complex, and sympathetic 
antihero in the history of the cinema. As played by Malcolm McDowell, he is 
vicious, murderous but also a lover of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. He also 
has nude paintings in his bedroom, has masturbatory fantasies to the tune of 
Beethoven with images from the movies (and himself as Dracula). Alex loves 
his working-class parents, his boa constrictor, and supposedly goes to school 
- he seems like a delightful lad you would see in your neighborhood on an 
"azure sky of deepest summer." There is only one difference - Alex has a 
knack, a love, for sex and violence. He has a creative imagination but it is 
fueled by his violent-proned rages - he seems to take delight in killing 
people. 
At the beginning of the film, in stunning close-up, we see Alex at the Korova 
Milkbar with his fellow Droogs drinking some milk substance that can "sharpen 
you up and get you ready for a bit of the old ultraviolence." Their nightly 
activities consist of beating up old winos in dark alleys, attacking people 
in their homes, driving like madmen on the roads, having sex with women they 
pick up in record stores, and it is usually all to the tune of Beethoven's 
lovely Ninth. These Droogs dress in white, have ripped-out eyeball 
ornamentations on their cuffs, and often wear masks with phallic, Pinocchio 
noses. Kubrick shows us quite a bit of violence in the first half-hour but he 
has more up his sleeve as the film continues. 
Alex is eventually caught by the police after being betrayed by his fellow 
Droogs (he is hit in the nose with a milk bottle). Once in prison, he gets 
wind of a "Ludovico technique" where a prisoner is subjected to a 
rehabilitative process that results in getting out of prison in no time at 
all. Alex wants to do good or he says, "one act of goodness." The prison 
chaplain (Godfrey Quigley) tells Alex that the technique has not been tested 
much and is considered dangerous. As the chaplain explains, "Goodness comes 
from within - goodness, is chosen. When a man cannot choose, he ceases to be 
a man." Alex doesn't comprehend such ideas, and decides to take part in the 
technique at all costs. He gets his chance when the Minister of the Interior 
(Anthony Sharp), who is looking for criminals to participate in such a 
technique, chooses Alex whom he considers ruthless, smart, and enterprising. 
In what remains surely the most perfectly realized scenes in the film, Alex 
is strapped to a chair with clamps that keeps his eyelids pried open as he is 
forced to watch violent film footage - at first, he enjoys it but slowly he 
becomes nauseous and sickly. Alex is becoming conditioned not just against 
violence but everything else he enjoys, including Beethoven's Ninth. 
So what is Kubrick trying to say? That in a clockwork, mechanized society, we

Alex is not really cured, we sense he will go back to his violent self. 
The violence is both stylized and realistic. It is shown in slow-motion, 
time-lapse motion, and sometimes "viddied with the red, red vino on tap." 
When Alex kills his victims, it is shown at a remove, a distance from which 
we become observers particularly the attack on Alex (Patrick Magee), the 
Leftist writer, and his wife (Adrienne Corri), to the tune of "Singin' in the 
Rain." When Alex is attacked by his own droogs (who ironically become 
policemen) or by other higher-ups, it is realistic and bloody, with none of 
the enjoyment of "action and performance" that Alex feels when he inflicts

e - his survival instinct is violence, it is what makes him a person. A moral

Writer/Director: Stanley Kubrick (based on the novel by Anthony Burgess)
Starring: Malcolm McDowell, Patrick Magee, Aubrey Morris, Michael Bates, 
Philip Stone, David Prowse, Adrienne Corri
"A Clockwork Orange" finds Kubrick at his personal peak.  His past two 
films, "2001" and "Dr. Strangelove" are two of the greatest films ever 
made; one an epic space opera/satire, the other a black comedy/satire.  
"A Clockwork Orange" completes Kubrick's trilogy of his utter 
masterpieces (although his other films are also brilliant, but not as 
much as these are).  His subject, as it is in such films as "2001" and 
"Full Metal Jacket" is dehuminization.  And like the other two, he takes 
his film from a literary source and puts his own spin on it.
Many people believe this to be just another of those "anti-violence" 
films.  Uh huh.  And "Trainspotting" was just another "anti-drug" film. 
 "A Clockwork Orange" is a film about the dehuminization of people - if 
you take away the choice of violence, you can't really be a person, can 
you?  No.  Sad but true fact.  Kubrick paints a near future where the 
"good" people hide at night as ruffians and gangs come out and do their 
own schtick - raping, looting, singing Gene Kelly tunes, playing "Kings 
of the Road," you know, the usual.  The center of this intense, 
poignant, darkly comic satire is Alex DeLarge (the perfect, and I mean 
perfect, Malcolm MacDowell, also at his peak).  Alex is 15 in the novel 
by Anthony Burgess (which, in a newer publication of it with the final 
chapter Kubrick deleted from the film, has a forward published by him 
before his death where he basically he says he wrote it under pressure 
and basically regrets writing it 'cause he gets WAYYYY too many papers 
from students on it), but Malcom is a brisk 26.  No matter.  
Alex lives with his parents somewhere in England, rarely attends school 
and goes out at night to, what he tells his parents is his "night job," 
and proceeds to loot, rape, sing Gene Kelly tunes, play "Kings of the 
Road," and all that other stuff I talked about.  The first half-hour 
deals with a typical night for them: they go to a drugged-up-milk bar 
where they get drugged up and ready for some "old ultraviolence;" taunt 
then beat an old homeless man senseless; have a braul with another gang; 
play the aforementioned "Kings of the Road; loot an author's (Patrick 
Magee) house then rape his wife (Adrienne Corri); then go off to their 
respective homes where Alex finishes it off with some old Ludwig Van 
[Beethoven] (just in case you didn't know).  In the morning, he claims 
to have a huge headache to his ignorant parents and goes out (after a 
meeting with his Parole Officer, played with hamminess by Aubrey 
Morris), meets some young girls, has an orgy with them (set to the Lone 
Ranger section of the "William Tell Overture") then gets ready for 
another night on the town with his mates. All this in the first 30 
minutes.
This particular night, though, his mates set him up as he kills a woman 
with a giant phallic sculpture (heh heh) during a looting and is scooted 
off to jail finally at the ripe age of 15 (we assume).  Here is where 
the satire takes shape as he spends time in prison, reading the bible 
(but only liking the sex and violence parts) and chatting up with the 
wise chaplain.  He learns of a government experiment to rehabilitate its 
convicts quickly and efficiently...but it is still in the works.  He 
does everything to get it and he eventually gets chosen as the guinea 
pig.  The whole thing is to be strapped down with his eyes clamped open 
(he actually did have his eyes clamped open and reportedly almost lost 
his sight...but it's for a Kubrick film so it's worth it) and watch 
hours upon hours of sex and violence.  With drugs mixing into his system 
at the same time, he soon finds he is repelled to sex and violence and, 
unfortunately, Beethoven, for his Ninth Symphony is used in a film 
showing Nazis.  After a showcase where he is bullied by an actor and 
throws up when a topless woman walks right up to him, he is set 
free...only as a zombie...a clockwork orange, if you will.
Once out, everyone he had beaten turns right around and beats him 
(literally or figuratively): his parents have rented his room to a jerk 
who's doing a job and tell him to go elsewhere (in an emmotional scene 
perfectly heightened by the first, somber movement of the "William Tell 
Overture"); the old homeless guy he beat up, attacks him with all his 
homeless buddies; his mates ("droogs," really - I never mentioned they 
speak a weird lingo called "Nadsat" which is a combination of Russian 
Slang and something else, I don't remember) are now cops and they beat 
him and try to drown him; and to top it off, the old author he looted 
tries his way at vengeance since his wife had died from her rape wounds 
and he has gone a tad off-kilter.  At the end of it all, Alex throws 
himself from the author's top story in an attempt to kill himself since 
he is no longer able to defend himself...but he only hurt himself and he 
goes into a coma where he is rehabilitated to make a choice once he 
comes out.  With his last line, "I was cured all right," the film ends 
on a note of happiness and dread, knowing that he is back to his old 
self so he can make a choice and it will probably be for violence.
Kubrick reportedly feels that violence is eternal and you can never take 
it away.  This could not be better illustrated with this film.  Violence 
is a part of life no matter what, and taking it away means the end of a 
person.  The film not only satirizes this, but also the government's 
lack of being able to control society naturally.  The government in this 
film is working towards a nice cause - it would be nice to live in a 
world without violence and jerks - but it is impossible and amoral.  
Even though I think this world blows anyway, I certainly don't want a 
world with zombies like in "Brave New World."  Violence is actually 
something we need to make life worth living.  
"A Clockwork Orange" is one of the most thought-provoking films ever to 
be made.  It has so many levels to it that a full report on all of them 
would mean boring the hell out of people by the utterly huge length of 
it.  Also, I have to go to work soon, so I can't just rant on the 
meanings of this film.  It is very open to inerpretation and can mean 
different things to different people.  It also has stood the test of 
time: it is one of the most talked about, most contreversial, and most 
idolized films ever made.  I know that I have been majorly influenced by 
it.  The scenes are perfectly crafted by Kubrick to appear beautiful, 
horrifying, funny and intriguing all at the same time.  The violence is 
quite voyeristic and tempting.  With his hand-held direction, Kubrick 
invites us to join in the droogs fun because violence is something we 
need.  He illustrates this the best at the end when all the people he 
hurt attack him hypocritically and he has no way of defending himself.  
He actually makes the viewer sympathize with/for a totally amoral 
character as Alex, who is wonderfully portrayed by Malcolm MacDowell.
 It has also been spoofed in such films as Woody Allen's "Sleeper" and 
been inspiration for such films as "Trainspotting" and even a bit of 
"Fargo."  And besides, it spoofs "Singing in the Rain."  
Besides, this film is so fun to watch.  With its funny lines, comical 
violence scenes and outrageous sets and costumes, this was bound to 
become a cult hit.  Even if it has been viewed as a way to provoke 
violence (and reportedly influenced gangs to dress up like them and/or 
beat people to Gene Kelly tunes), you can't deny its intensity as an 
intense satire.  Its scenes live in your mind for the rest of your life: 
the first shot, which opens on Alex's face and slowly pulls back to the 
back of the milk bar; the infamous (and hilarious) "Singin' in the Rain" 
loot/rape scene; the accidental murder scene where Alex breaks a woman 
in the face with a giant sculpture of a penis; the shot of him strapped 
into the chair in pain; the shot of the crazed author taking ultimate 
pleasure in hearing Alex suffer; Alex being fed by the head of 
government as he lies in bed in a huge cast; etc, etc, etc.
"A Clockwork Orange" deserves to be esteemed from everyone, even if you 
really didn't care for the violence.
*Note: This film was originally rated X for intense and graphic 
violence, rape, sex, lots o' nudity as well as a bit of language.  I 
reccomend it to everyone, but it is hard to watch if you have a bad 
stomach and/or can't handle watching violence or rape.  
*Another Note: For us "Star Wars" geeks, look for David Prowse who 
played the guy underneath the Darth Vadar costume as the crazed author's 
physical therapist.  You can't miss him.  He's, like, 100 feet tall.
