        Even though it seems more parody movies are being 
released than ever, the well is quickly drying up. The last truly 
good one was the second HOT SHOTS movie back in 1993, and 
that judgment is certainly debatable. The thing is, with the old style 
parody films, they still seemed like actual movies. You go to the 
theater to see SPY HARD or DON'T BE A MENACE and come out 
thinking you dreamed the entire thing. That's just how bizarre the 
parody movies have gotten. Or maybe I've consumed too much 
Canola oil.
        HIGH SCHOOL HIGH is Jon Lovitz's first starring role, 
which is the funniest thing about the movie. Lovitz was bad enough 
in TRAPPED IN PARADISE, and there he had Nicolas Cage and 
Dana Carvey to fall back on. Here, he co-stars with Tia Carrere and 
Mekhi Phifer. Yes, that's a real name, not a random series of typed 
letters. If you're interested, this is what a random series of typed 
letters looks like: Mekhi Phifer. Damn.
        DANGEROUS MINDS was pretty laughable, but HIGH 
SCHOOL HIGH as an offshoot of that is infinitely whackier. 
Annoyingly wacky, actually, with so many strained punchlines 
and predictable gags that we're screaming at the top of our lungs, 
"Where's Leslie Nielson?!" Lovitz doesn't fit into the joke-a-second 
parody mold because the protagonists in these movies aren't 
supposed to know what's happening is funny or anything less than 
normal. Lovitz spouts more lame wisecracks here than a Catskills 
comic.
        The genre parodied this time is the inspirational high 
school drama, about an ambitious, idealistic teacher who comes into 
the inner-city school and teaches a bunch of underpriveliged kids to 
love all things school-related. These kinds of movies have been 
around forever, from the days of TO SIR, WITH LOVE on. It's ripe 
for parody but doesn't deserve the treatment it gets here, especially 
with Lovitz at the helm. What can you say about a movie whose 
greatest laugh comes when its main character tries to have sex with 
a cat?
        Lovitz is, of course, the teacher who quits a promising job 
at a prominent college to teach at Marion Barry High, probaby the 
most redundant three words ever. In his first ten minutes there, he 
gets his car stolen, finds himself in the middle of a gang fight and 
gets on the bad side of the principal. He also meets Tia and Mekhi -- 
Tia the administrative assistant he soon falls in love with and Mekhi 
the most popular student in the class, the one the others look up to, 
kind of like Enrico in DANGEROUS MINDS.
        The plot is secondary to the endless stream of sight and 
sound gags. Lovitz has the D.J. at the school dance play "Rhinestone 
Cowboy," a baseball bat gets caught in somebody's afro, Lovitz 
accidentally unravels the principal's dress, miniature police cars race 
around the parts in somebody's corn rows, Lovitz engages in a game 
of chicken with two other students, Lovitz tries to have sex with a 
cat, etc.
        Some of it is funny, mostly the same stuff they put in the 
HIGH SCHOOL HIGH trailer. If you've seen that, you've seen what's 
good about this movie, which just proves David Zucker needs his 
brother Jerry and Jim Abrahams to keep him from churning out crap 
like this.

The Substitute + The Naked Gun + Dangerous Minds = the hilarious new
satire, High School High. Lovitz (A League of Their Own) is hysterical
in his portrayal of a high school teacher trying to make a difference in
the lives of his students.
He feels that the only way to get through to his students is by
reaching their role model, a newly reformed, ex-gang member named Griff.
Of course, spoofing directly off of Dangerous Minds, his stu-dents
change their ways and the gangsta' look of Marion Berry High into
something more like West Beverly High (think Clueless?)
However, when the senior's take their SAT's, and all mysteriously fail,
it is up to Lovitz & Carrera (True Lies) to search for the culprit, who
turns out to be the school's principal, Fletcher (Flower's in the Attic)
and her gang of lowlife "homey-g's", who are also running a drug
smug-gling ring (hence The Substitute, which can also be seen in the
hysterical library scene).
So where does The Naked Gun fit into all of this. Throughout the film,
shots of idiocy can be seen in the background, with some serious
conver-sation in the foreground. For example, a few Afri-can-American
students can be seen stumbling down a flight of concrete stairs, trying
to walk up and hold up their baggy pants at the same time.         Although the
film is full of hysterics and ludicrous comedy, it lacks in the plot
department. Despite copying Dangerous Minds' reform plot, nothing was
really done to build up the plot's real potential.
What made this great comedy even more enjoyable, were the plush,
reclining seats at the new Magic Theater in the Northampton Crossings.
Even though, a small soda still costs a small fortune, you will never
have to worry about kicking them over again, since you can rest them in
the cup holders on the chairs, not taking any elbow-room away.
Sur-prisingly, the new Magic Theaters costs only $5.75, which is a good
price for what you get.
So if you want to see a good comedy and sit in good seats, then pick a
good Saturday night, find a couple of good friends, eat a good dinner,
and go to the Magic Cinema and see High School High.
Grade: B, *** out of *****

High School High (1996) ** out of ***** - Cast: Jon Lovitz, Tia Carrere,
Mekhi Phifer, Louise Fletcher. Written by: Robert LoCash, Pat Proft and
David Zucker. Directed by: Hart Bochner. Running Time: 84 minutes.
"Spoof" movies are a difficult genre of film. In a given year there may be
one released, sometimes two. There have been many great ones: The two
"Airplane" films, "Top Secret", the two "Hot Shots" movies, and "The Naked
Gun" trilogy. There have also been many dreadful ones: "Spy Hard",
"Repossessed", and almost all of Mel Brooks' films. What the good ones have
in common is in some way the participation of Jim Abrahams, Pat Proft, and
Jerry and David Zucker. When they are involved in a spoof film, its usually
guaranteed that a great deal of time has gone into the script, cramming it
with as many jokes as possible, and sometimes with more jokes than possible.
Well, despite the presence of Pat Proft and David Zucker in the film's
credits, "High School High" just isn't funny. With the good films of the
genre, there will usually be about 85 minutes of comedy in the film's 90
minute running time. With "High School High", there's maybe 5 minutes of
total comedy.
Jon Lovitz' comedic talents are wasted in this spoof of such films as
"Dangerous Minds", "The Substitute", "Lean on Me" and "The Blackboard
Jungle". He plays a naive school teacher who gets assigned to a run down,
criminal-infested school (Marion Berry High, the film's best joke) and
thinks he can make a difference in these kids lives. Fine, good so far. My
problem here is that there are so many targets available for ridicule here,
and NONE of which are capitalized upon. For example, no matter what your
views of "Ebonics" are, you just can't deny that it's a made-up language.
It's ridiculous. So why not make some jokes about it? Not here. Also, the
soundtrack of the film is comprised of real rap songs. Why not make up some
ridiculous rap songs? What struck me is that after about the first 15
minutes, the filmmakers actually started to try and make a SERIOUS movie.
Granted the tone is comical, but there's just so much plot here, and the
filmmakers ACTUALLY want us to care about it and the characters.
Late in the film there's actually a quick parody of a scene from "The Deer
Hunter", which angered me because 1) hardly anyone watching the film will
get the joke, and B) it's not even done well! Come on guys, if all of a
sudden you're going to do that sort of thing, you had better do a good job
with it.
A trend I've noticed in the genre since "The Naked Gun 2 1/2" is that makers
of spoof movies have started to create moments of silence in order to give
people a moment to laugh without missing anything. It's generally done by a
character saying the joke, then cutting to another character who tilts their
head like a dog hearing a high-pitch noise and then makes a puzzled face. It
happens about 300 times in "High School High" and it couldn't be more
annoying. And if you sit through this entire film you'll most likely come
away with a puzzled face as well. [PG-13]

     These days, whenever a new picture comes out with one of the old 
Zucker-Abrams-Zucker crew's name attached to it, it's easy to wax 
nostalgic for films like AIRPLANE! and THE NAKED GUN.  Those mvoies may 
not have been comic masterpieces, but at least they were consistently 
funny, which is more than can be said for HIGH SCHOOL HIGH, the latest 
product to come off of David Zucker's script-by-numbers comedy assembly 
line.  This film bears more of a resemblance to such duds as DON'T BE A 
MENACE TO SOUTH CENTRAL WHILE DRINKING YOUR JUICE IN THE HOOD and LOADED 
WEAPON ONE than it does to any inventive parody.  Put simply, HIGH 
SCHOOL HIGH isn't just bad, it's very bad.  What else can I say about a 
movie that drags on for 85 minutes without delivering a single solid 
laugh?
     The first problem is the casting of Jon Lovitz as Richard Clark, 
the so-called hero -- a high school teacher who views the world through 
rose-colored glasses.  As part of a comedy ensemble, Lovitz can be quite 
funny, but it's apparent here that he is incapable of carrying a film on 
his own.  His whiny antics quickly grow tiresome, and it doesn't take 
long before we start to dislike his character.  He's not exactly 
supported by a strong comic cast, either.  The best performers are 
typically those in small supporting roles (like Natasha Gregson Wagner, 
the daughter of Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner, as a pregnant student), 
and even they're not that impressive.  Tia Carrere (TRUE LIES), who 
plays Clark's love interest, is virtually invisible (or at least as 
invisible as she can be), and Louise Fletcher (ONE FLEW OVER THE CUKOO'S 
NEST), as an iron-fisted principal, acts like she's trying out for the 
headmistress' role in MATILDA.  I won't attempt to explain the presence 
of distinguished Shakespearean actor John Neville (THE ADVENTURES OF 
BARON MUNCHAUSEN), except to say that a paycheck is a paycheck.
     HIGH SCHOOL HIGH attempts to lampoon movies like THE BLACKBOARD 
JUNGLE, LEAN ON ME, and DANGEROUS MINDS, but the only thing it succeeds 
in doing is illustrating the satirical bankruptcy of the production 
team.  Without exception, the jokes are way too obvious.  If you play 
the "guess the punch line" game, you'll rarely be wrong.  Of course, 
predictability isn't the lone problem, because the spontaneous comedy 
doesn't work, either.  The sight gags simply aren't funny, or even 
clever, and the verbal barbs are disappointingly tame.  At least Glen 
Campbell fans have a reason to rejoice -- this is the first time I've 
heard "Rhinestone Cowboy" played since its heyday at the top of the 
charts.
     Had the movie been amusing, it would have been easy to forgive the 
throwaway plot, but, since the humor is so feeble, the lack of a 
credible storyline becomes a huge disadvantage.  (Ironically, in the 
production notes, the film makers state that they're proud of the film's 
depth.  Regarding HIGH SCHOOL HIGH, that statement has to be the biggest 
joke of all.)  Clark, an academic-minded individual who cares about 
educating his students, is the new teacher at Marion Barry High, a 
hellish school in the midst of an urban war zone.  After a few rough 
days that find him getting chained to his desk and participating in a 
"Chickee Run" (see REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE), he gains the respect of the 
class tough guy (Mekhi Phifer), and everyone else soon falls in line.  
Once Clark has his students' attention, it's up to him to find 
innovative teaching methods to keep them interested.  Along the way, he 
has time for a romance with the principal's secretary (oops, sorry... 
administrative assistant) while simultaneously foiling a big time drug 
deal.  
     Actually, all things considered, this year's THE SUBSTITUTE (one of 
the films supposedly spoofed here), which was mostly intended to be 
serious, contains more laugh-generating material than HIGH SCHOOL HIGH.  
This brand of mindless comedy has passed the point where it offers more 
than minimal entertainment.  Even graded on a liberal curve, there's no 
way HIGH SCHOOL HIGH can score better than an "F".

So, here's another spoof from the creator of The Naked Gun films (David
Zucker, although he didn't direct this) Dangerous Minds should be one of the
most easiest films to spoof, yet this film still manages to mess up. The
film just hasn't got enough laughs in it. I suspect this is not because the
writers aren't funny, but because they were trying to hard to stick to the
plot of the film! Imagine, a spoof with a plot!
And that's the films downfall. You can't really make quick fire gags around
a plot, and near the end of the movie, the film runs out of jokes altoghether.
So, this film is majorly dissapointing. Although Lovitz and Louise Fletcher
(who played the nurse in One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest) are funny, they
can't save the film. This film isn't as bad as the dire Spy Hard, but it
could have been much funnier.

Director:  Hart Bochner.
Screenplay:  Robert LoCash, Pat Proft, Jerry Zucker.
Producers:  Jerry Zucker, Pat Proft, Gil Netter.
Starring:  Jon Lovitz, Tia Carrere, Mekhi Phifer, Louise Fletcher, Malinda
Williams, Guillermo Diaz.
MPAA Rating:  PG-13 (adult themes, profanity)
Running Time:  86 minutes.
     Jon Lovitz stars in HIGH SCHOOL HIGH as Richard Clark, and it is
indicative of how far the film strays from the dependable groan-worthiness
of previous Zucker brothers projects (AIRPLANE!, THE NAKED GUN) that it
misses one of its most obvious gags:  there is nary a "Dick Clark" gag to
be found.  Obviousness was never really an issue for the Zuckers, because
their modus operandi was a non-stop assault of puns, pratfalls and pop
culture references, allowing every dud joke to be swallowed up by the next
one in line.  HIGH SCHOOL HIGH doesn't seem to have time for that kind of
comic machine-gunning, because it is too busy with -- of all things -- a
plot.  And this is that rarity among contemporary films, one which needs
less plot instead of more.
     Lovitz's Clark is a prep school history teacher when the film begins,
under the thumb of his father (John Neville), the school's domineering
headmaster.  Richard, however, has a dream of reaching and teaching kids
where they need the most help, which leads him to take a job at Marion
Barry High School (located just past the street sign marked "Inner City").
Richard finds almost everything working against him -- a burned-out
principal (Louise Fletcher), an antagonistic gang leader named Paco
(Guillermo Diaz) and indifferent students.  However, he does have the
principal's beautiful administrative assistant Victoria (Tia Carrere) on
his side, and a belief that if he can get a well-respected student named
Griff (Mekhi Phifer) to tune in, he can get through to everyone.
     It should be made clear first of all that the extent of Zucker
involvement in HIGH SCHOOL HIGH is David Zucker's participation as
co-writer and co-producer (brother Jerry being too busy now making
"serious" films like GHOST and FIRST KNIGHT).  HIGH SCHOOL HIGH was
directed by erstwhile B-actor and PCU director Hart Bochner, and he shows
little aptitude for the kind of frame-filling humor which characterized
other Zucker parodies.  Nearly every gag is front and center here,
providing little incentive to scour the background for throwaway bits.  On
the rare occasion when a joke is tucked away for discovery -- like a sign
in a topless bar-cum-theater which promises "Next Week:  All-Nude Ibsen"
-- it is like a gift.  Too much of the time, however, writers Zucker, Pat
Proft and Robert LoCash measure out the laughs as though aware that there
aren't that many to go around.
     They also can't seem to decide what kind of laughs they are going
for.  I'm not going to suggest that low humor hasn't always played a
significant role in Zucker films, since they were inspired largely by MAD
Magazine, but there was usually the sense that they were writing dumb
comedy for smart people, jackhammer-subtle but intricately absurdist.
HIGH SCHOOL HIGH is not nearly as clever, aiming many of its gags at the
same audience which Tri-Star is targeting with a hip-hop-heavy soundtrack.
The number of jokes aimed at gays or lesbians runs in the high teens; the
over-use or mis-use of urban slang runs a close second.  The latter
produces a few minor successes (Richard attempting to diagram the
sentence "Yo, you wack punk" for his class), but the former begins to get
repetitive and unpleasant very quickly.
     The dependence on a soundtrack and the surprisingly straight-forward
narrative often make HIGH SCHOOL HIGH feel less like a parody of DANGEROUS
MINDS than a slightly more amusing remake of DANGEROUS MINDS.  Actually,
in some ways it resembles this year's THE SUBSTITUTE even more, with its
sub-plot of drug dealing and administrative complicity, but THE SUBSTITUTE
was a more subversive film.  HIGH SCHOOL HIGH is not nearly hard enough on
the cliched movies made for and about urban youth, perhaps afraid of
insulting its own audience.  With its cast a combination of comic actors
like Lovitz and dramatic actors like Fletcher and Phifer, HIGH SCHOOL HIGH
slides uncomfortably between mockery and schlockery.  The surest sign of
HIGH SCHOOL HIGH's spartan comedy is that it almost isn't worth staying
through the closing credits, where the Zuckers usually tossed off half a
dozen silly little references.  It's just a basic crawl this time, which
also sums up the pace of the film rather nicely.

The big failing of 'send up' movies is that they are never as amusing or
as good as the original. Why see 'High School High' when you can have
heartier laughs watching Michelle Pfeiffer, pretend to be a ex-marine,
turned teacher, changing the lives of her pupils in 'Dangerous Minds.'
Needless to say these movies are out to make money. Scraping the
left-over crumbs from the far superior original movies, at whose expense
they make a living. So who are the big suckers of the general public who
are pulled into watching these send ups?  Most probably, those still
hung up about 'Dangerous Minds', or those still longing for more Opus
from 'Mr Holland's Opus', or as clueless as 'Clueless' itself. With the
exception of movie critics who have to watch the movie in order to
review it.
I won't have to say how bad it was, because that goes without saying.

          It is not bad enough that our schools are in bad shape.
It is not bad enough that illiteracy in the United States is so high.
What we do not need is a movie that lays it on in thick globs that
demean everyone.  In addition it is a boring film.
         I never liked Jon Lovitz whom I compare to Chevy Chase.  Both
have sneers that turn me off.  Lovitz, in addition, affects a dumb
look as his idea of being a comic.  In HIGH SCHOOL HIGH, he is a
teacher at a private school who opts to leave in order to teach at an
inner city school.  There he encounters every kind of mischief and
worse.  There he finds a principal (Louise Fletcher) who uses a
baseball bat to keep the "students" in line.   That this is the same
Fletcher who was so good in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, is hard
to believe. . . and it is very sad that she cannot get a better role.
         I would have liked to review more of the film but after one
half hour of this disgusting display I left.  It has been several
years since I walked out before a screening was over but that
happened twice in this one week.   Baaaad.
          This was supposed to be a NAKED GUN type of movie, or
AIRPLANE, but it fell flat on its face because it lacked the wit that
the other films had.
