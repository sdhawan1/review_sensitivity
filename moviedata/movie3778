     The formula is a familiar one:  two people meet, fall in love, and
spend the rest of the picture pretending they don't feel that way.  In
the bustling, big-city romantic comedy ONE FINE DAY, those two are
Michelle Pfieffer and George Clooney.  They play a pair of single,
working parents who are thrown together after their kids miss a field
trip.  The Cat and the Bat are an okay match, though neither actor
appears at a distinct advantage.  Mr. Clooney is not yet the Big Leading
Man that the hype would have him be, while Ms.  Pfieffer is stuck
struggling in a oddly unsympathetic role.  The latter point is
particularly problematic.  Pfieffer is portrayed as, well, a grouch who
can't control her son.  So when Clooney's character breezes in and
effortlessly takes charge of the situation, you can't help but wonder
what message is being sent.  Of course, these points are probably moot
as the movie itself is so exhausting that I'm tempted to label it
unwatchable.  Director Michael Hoffman (RESTORATION) overdoes it on
every possible front-- plot, music, repartee, etc.-- that the end result
is too much movie.  I just wanted to shut down and be done with it.

        There are movies that are sweet and there are movies that 
go way beyond sweet to the point of saccharine. And saccharine 
causes cancer in some people. So be aware that because I had a 
mostly positive viewing experience with ONE FINE DAY doesn't 
mean you'll be able to tolerate its sickening sucrose. I have a higher 
level of sugar tolerance than most even though my family has a 
history of diabetes.
        ONE FINE DAY covers a day and night in the life of two 
struggling, divorced parents, played by George Clooney and 
Michelle Pfeiffer. Clooney is an immature newspaper columnist who 
wakes up one morning to find he's got custody of his six-year-old 
daughter for the week. He's the type that feeds his kid Tic-Tacs and 
Smores and routinely forgets to do certain key things. One of the key 
things he's supposed to do on this fine day is call Pfeiffer and tell her 
his daughter doesn't need a ride to school after all. And of course he 
forgets.
        That means Pfeiffer and her six-year-old son, in the same 
class as Clooney's daughter, end up late for school and miss the big 
field trip. They show up at the same time Clooney does, and the 
sparks fly, in that cute, flirtatious movie way. Clooney and Pfeiffer 
share a cab back into the city, complaining about each other into 
their respective cell phones, and begin their hectic workdays with 
children en tow. Rest assured their paths will cross many a time 
until eventually they realize they're madly in love with each other.
        Yes, there is a plot in there somewhere. Pfeiffer has to show 
a presentation to some clients at 2:00 and must race across town to 
fix the scale model her kid was responsible for breaking, and 
Clooney has to track down an interview before 5:00. And somehow 
they switched cell phones by mistake. Little contrivances like these 
add up for Clooney and Pfeiffer and they have to humble their 
stubborn pride and admit they need each other's help.
        This movie would be excrutiating if not for a few details, 
like the fact that the script actually does contain a lot of laughs, 
minor and big, and that Clooney and Pfeiffer do have a weird kind 
of chemistry. The concept of George Clooney as a romantic lead 
wouldn't have occurred to me in a thousand years -- it's about as 
ridiculous as having him play Batman -- but he doesn't do a bad 
job at it. Now if he'd only get rid of that damn haircut...
        Michelle Pfeiffer was well-cast as the harrowed control 
freak who tries to juggle all those balls on her own, and the two kids 
are personifications of the word "cute." It does go on for way too 
long, but ONE FINE DAY makes for a good date movie (not that 
_I'd_ know about such things) and a not-half-bad teenybopper chick 
flick. I don't fall into either of those categories, at least not on a 
surface level, but still found the movie pleasantly entertaining.

Scheduled to open on December 20th is the comedy/drama 'One Fine Day'
starring Michelle Pfeiffer and George Clooney.  I had the opportunity to
view this movie in advance on the evening of December 5th here in my
hometown through various established contacts and I can tell you right now
that there's no need to hold your breath.  The movie is set in New York
City and Pfeiffer and Clooney star as the parents of kindergarten aged
children who arrive one morning escorting their offspring to school and
they are late and the class has already left for their scheduled field
trip.  She is an architect on the verge of a major promotion within her
company and he is a high profile journalist working on the most important
story of his life.  They are forced to juggle the needs of their children
and their careers and are inadvertently thrown together for ONE FINE DAY
of course meaning it will be one of the most chaotic and alarming days in
memory as they must bring small children to work with them!  Unfortunately
you can't build a film with a running time of 108 minutes simply around a
premise.  The premise must expand into plot and develop gears to get off
the ground.  This film never does that and I looked at my watch at
precisely the 24 minute mark which is a bad sign.  Clooney, who has struck
gold on television's 'ER' and who is presently shoooting next summer's
'Batman and Robin' in which he will star as the caped crusader is the only
character with some interesting aspects.  He makes the most of a
repetitive script by adding an easy going charm and likeability while
Pfeiffer suffers badly in a role that gives working women a bad name and
really makes them the target of male chauvanism.  The film plays more like
a network television movie rather than a big screen Hollywood presentation
and I was actually offended at the amount of unintended child neglect that
is associated with this film.  Michelle Pfeiffer is a remarkably talented
actress and gained breakthrough recognition and critical acclaim in 1983's
'Scarface' as Al Pacino's trashy and drug addicted wife.  Clooney has had
small success on the big screen but gained some surprisingly good notices
earlier this year for Robert Rodriguez's 'From Dusk Till Dawn' as a
murdering escaped prisoner on the lam in Texas trying to make it to the
Mexican border with his sexually psychotic brother and a family he's taken
hostage.  Clooney was one of the most chilling and unrepenting bad guys in
recent memory in that movie which was indefensible garbage.  I would like
to see Clooney perform well in a good film instead of being the standout
character in really bad movie which has been happening a lot lately.  'One
Fine Day' even has the nerve to insult us by having its two leading
characters who hate each other at the beginning of the movie slowly fall
in love and bring us to a disappointing conclusion.  I've given away
nothing but what a cliche!

One Fine Day must've seemed like a great idea at the time. Let's pair up 
Hollywood's latest heartthrob with Michelle Pfeiffer. I can see why the 
studio and the stars fell for it. Heck, I even fell for the idea. I was 
eagerly anticipating this movie. Unfortunately, the movie is empty, 
unfunny, and unromantic until the last 10 minutes.
Clooney stars as Jack Taylor, a newspaper columnist whose picture is on 
alot of busses. His wife drops his daughter off because she is going on a 
honeymoon with her new husband. Jack receives very specific instructions 
to call Melanie Parker and let her know if she doesn't need to pick his 
daughter up for a feild trip. Obviously, Jack forgets, and both Jack's 
daughter and Melanie's son miss the feild trip. This begins a long day 
(especially for the viewer) where they go on misadventures around the 
city with their kids, while trying to get their jobs done.
The first problem with the movie is it actually thinks we care wether or 
not Melanie and Jack are able to get their jobs done in time. It also 
thinks we care that Melanie's son has a deadbeat father who is touring 
with Springsteen. I cared about Melanie and Jack, because Clooney and 
Pfeiffer make them into interesting characters that I would like to see 
together. Unfortunately, the movie throws in a dozen subplots, few of 
which are interesting. I mean, I don't care if Melanie's son likes to 
stick things up his nose. I don't care if Jack's daughter has a penchant 
for wandering off. And then there is a scene with a kitten that is just 
so stupid it's not even funny.
There were some good moments in the film. Charles Durning has some 
hilarious moments as Jack's editor. George Clooney shows considerable 
skill at light comedy. He has a natural screen presence, and never seems 
like he's trying to be funny. Michaelle Pfeiffer is is terrific as always.
The final scene between Clooney and Pfeiffer is sweet and touching. 
After waiting the whole time for the movie to end, sudeenly I didn't want 
it to. But then it did.

Director: Michael Hoffman Screenplay: Terrel Seltzer and Ellen Simon
Producer:Via Rosa Productions / Fox 2000 Pictures
Running Time: Approx. 108 minutes.
Cast: Michelle Pfeiffer, George Clooney, Mae Whitman, Alex Linz
Rating: ***1/2 out of *****
OK, I admit I had a bad attitude about this film from the start. A romantic
comedy about the trials and tribulations of single working parents? With a
couple of incredibly cute kids thrown in for good measure? Yuck.
But it's not really too bad. It has a lot working against it, for me at
least. In addition to the above, it is typical of a lot of recent movies
in that it is really just a glorified made-for-TV movie, but longer and
with bigger stars, and you have to pay to see it. It does win you over,
though, even if it is painfully predictable.
Just think about it: Two single parents, with their cute kids, are
thrown together due to a missed field trip. Through a day of near
disasters, they cont inually meet, get in one another's way, cause
trouble for one another, and generally insult one another at every
opportunity. In fact, they hate each other so much that we know that
they are, or soon will be, in love. The only people who hate each other
more than lovers are married couples.
So this film is predictable, just as the screwball comedies of the
classical Hollywood cinema were predictable (and the screwball genre is
obviously Hoffman's model for this film). Will they get fired from their
yuppie jobs? Will they make the big soccer game that is so important to
their kids? Will Pfeiffer realize what a jerk her ex-husband, a drummer
for Bruce Springsteen, really is (aren't they all?)? Will they finally
kiss? Well, what do you expect?
But there is a certain amount of satisfaction in having our expectations
fulfilled, especially when it is done with as much humour, along with a
lack of sticky sentimentality, as it is in this film. Pfeiffer and
Clooney have a certain chemistry together that is surprisingly charming,
and the kids are neither shoved into the background nor allowed to steal
the show.
One word of caution, though. This film is being billed in some places as
a "family" movie. Don't let that stop you. However, I think most kids,
especially boys, would be pretty bored by this move. After all, nobody
gets killed and there are no explosions.
All in all, a good, non-offensive date movie.
The Flying Inkpot Rating System:
* Wait for the TV2 broadcast.
** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha!
*** Pretty good, bring a friend.
**** Amazing, potent stuff.
***** Perfection. See it twice.

     Just in case you think the term "soccer mom" was nothing but a
convenient demographic catch-phrase for the 1996 presidential election,
ONE FINE DAY presents Michelle Pfeiffer as an in-the-flesh soccer mom, and
her life is every bit as complicated as we have been led to believe.  In
between frying the bacon up in a pan and bringing it home, she has to deal
with child care dilemmas, unsympathetic co-workers and sleep deprivation.
It's one frantic day, all right, one that is equally frantic for "soccer
dad" George Clooney, and it begins to turn ONE FINE DAY into a
soci-political spin on PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES.  Unfortunately,
this is supposed to be a romantic comedy, and the romance is dropped into
this unfocused piece of work like an afterthought.
     Pfeiffer plays Melanie Parker, a divorced architect with a 6-year-old
son named Sammy (Alex D. Linz) and a very tight schedule ahead of her.
She is also responsible for bringing Sammy's classmate Maggie Taylor (Mae
Whitman) to school, and the schedule becomes even tighter when Maggie does
not show up on time.  That is because Maggie's mother has left her with
ex-husband Jack Taylor (Clooney), a cocky investigative reporter with a
somewhat cavalier attitude about parenting.  When both kids miss the bus
to a field trip, Jack and Melanie are stuck with their children though
both have little time to spare.  Out of sheer desperation, the pair end up
helping each other out with the kids, despite an apparent antagonism.
That antagonism begins to change into something else throughout the day,
as Jack and Melanie are forced to re-consider their priorities.
     If the idea of ONE FINE DAY is simply to show us how tough single
parents have it, then I suppose it does its job.  Both Jack and Melanie
lose and re-find the children with some regularity, both are forced to
make compromises and both find that working through their own relationship
issues is the last thing they have time for.  ONE FINE DAY is basically a
string of crises of varying magnitude, and while a few are amusing, the
cumulative effect inspires more anxiety than chuckles.  Sammy is a
particularly distressing case, a boy in desperate need of attention who
drives his mother to tears with his inability to stay in one place and
cause no damage.  With inserts of clocks consistently reminding us of
impending deadlines, ONE FINE DAY delivers the nerve-wracking realism of
impossible demands without leavening it with enough humor.
     It also delivers very little romance, and that's a shame, because
Pfeiffer and Clooney click in the few moments they actually share the
screen.  There is a pat quality to the contemporary urban
battle-of-the-sexes banter -- think WHEN HARRY MET SALLY AT THE DAY CARE
CENTER -- but neither star cranks up the sniping to an aggravating livel.
Clooney may not have the best comic timing (or hairdresser) in the world,
but he has an affable charm as the irresponsible Jack, and Pfeiffer's
attempts to maintain her dignity while wearing a dinosaur T-shirt to a
business meeting are equally winning.  In the film's final fifteen
minutes, when Melanie and Jack finally get a chance to take a breath,
there is a casual sexiness which finally seems in keeping with Natalie
Merchant's torchy rendering of the Carole King/Gerry Goffin title song
which opens the film.  By the time you get there, however, you may be
nearly as exhausted as Melanie and Jack.
     Director Michael Hoffman (SOAPDISH, RESTORATION) has made some
interesting films with a lot going on in them, but ONE FINE DAY is a case
where he just wasn't able to tame the script (by Terrel Seltzer and Ellen
Simon).  Somewhere in there is an energetic little modern romance, but it
gets buried under the side tracks of Melanie and Jack's respective
occupational dilemmas, to the point where a press conference where Jack
nails a corrupt politician is set up as the film's climax.  You may be
startled when you realize that there is still a lot of ONE FINE DAY left
to go, time for it to deliver at last the relationship it teased you with  
in trailers, posters, and ninety minutes of running time.  By that point
it has become clear that, like its protagonists, ONE FINE DAY is too busy
for something as mundane as a relationship when there are jobs to do, kids
to watch and, yes, soccer games to attend.

Michelle Pfeiffer (Up Close & Personal) and George Clooney (this
summer's Batman & Robin) are not compatible. It's as simple as that.
Pfeiffer's wrinkles don't exactly match Clooney's handsome, young looks.
So how could anyone expect the romantic comedy One Fine Day to be any
good?
Actually, it wasn't that bad. It depicted the hectic city life quite
well, but it failed in the romantic parts. You might ask yourself, "what
romantic parts?" Much like Sleepless in Seattle, the two don't get
together until the end, and when they do, they don't have the strength
to stay awake to enjoy the moment.
The chaotic movie revolves around two divorced parents, Jack (Clooney),
a self-conscious, stuck-up reporter,  and Melanie  (Pfeiffer), a
stubborn, tough-as-nails architect. They are both late for work and have
to get their kids to school. Their bosses' are breathing down their
necks and they have to find someone to baby-sit their kids. So they help
each other out. 
Jack watches his daughter, Maggie and her son, Sammy, while Melanie is
at her presentation. Then, Melanie watched the kids while Jack was at a
press-conference. And everything worked out okay, right? Wrong. 
The kids get into mischief wherever they go, with Sammy getting a marble
stuck up his nose and Maggie chasing after a stray cat and getting lost.
Sammy ends up wrecking his mother's model, the cat then eats Sammy's
class fish, a police search is issued for the return of Maggie and they
discover that they've accidentally switched cellular phones! Talk about
mayhem.
But it's not over yet. Sammy has a soccer game at 6 and is going to be
late because his mother has a meeting with a potential client. So they
end up rushing to the game to make it on time and Sammy and Maggie win
trophies. Isn't that just great.
Cellular phones can be a good thing, but in this movie, they turned out
to be more trouble than they're actually worth. Jack and Melanie end up
becoming each other's receptionists and mix up message after message.
The movie was relatively enjoyable, with fine performances by Clooney
and Pfieffer. Again, however, they just did not look good together, and
believing Clooney could find her to be "the most beautiful women he'd
ever seen" is basically impossible. If there's nothing else playing,
then go see it. But if you've got a choice, save One Fine Day for a
rainy day rental.
Grade: C+, **˝ out of *****

     Run Melanie run.  Run Jack run.  See Melanie and Jack run to take
care of their kids while maintaining their busy careers.
     Melanie Parker, played supposedly close to her real life by
Michelle Pfeiffer, is a harried and obsessive single mom in ONE FINE
DAY.  In contrast, Jack Taylor, played with childlike panache by George
Clooney, is a single father with a "Peter Pan complex."
     Over the span of one not so fine day, Melanie and Jack try to cope
with the problems of modern day parenthood.  Until the film starts the
only thing they share is that their 6-year-olds go to the same school.
In a single day, they will miss a field trip together, lose one of
their kids, swap cell phones by accident, worry about getting fired,
share childcare arrangements, trade numerous insults, and, of course,
finally fall in love.
     Highly predictable, certainly.  Funny?  Well, I think it depends
on the viewers.  I suspect that working parents of kids under twelve
will find that the humor works and the catastrophes of the story hit
home.  Others, may be inclined to write off the show as a lame comedy.
Most reviewers have been in the latter category.  Our whole family,
however, loved the show.
     Let me convince parents of the film's authenticity.  In the
opening, Melanie's little boy Sammy, played with heart by Alex D. Linz,
claims he had a bad dream although his head only hit the pillow seconds
earlier.  In the next scene he is in bed asleep with mom.  His arm
flies across the bed and slugs her in the face as she sleeps.  I have
long since lost track of how many times this has happened to us.
     Jack is a great dad and will stop everything to go play with his
daughter Maggie, played charmingly by Mae Whitman.  He is not, however,
terribly responsible.  In a typical scene Maggie tells him, "I'm
hungry."  He automatically replies, "Want a Tic Tac?"  When she says
no, he nonchalantly informs her, "That's all I've got."
     Since both adults have big meetings at different hours later in
the day, they will reluctantly agree to watch each other's child.
Director Michael Hoffman uses fast paced songs and frequent cuts to a
digital clock to maintain the film's high energy level.  He has his
actors pumped up like they are all on a sugar high.
     Both Pfeiffer and Clooney are good looking actors and full of
talent.  When Pfeiffer falls flat on her face, she stills looks
gorgeous.  Clooney's character has the women in his office falling all
over themselves to get an opportunity to flirt with him.
     Both of their jobs are interesting.  He is an investigative
columnist for a big New York City newspaper.  His boss Lew, played by
Charles Durning, repeating a character type he has done many times
before, threatens to fire him if he does not get collaboration on his
story by five o'clock.  "You aren't going to fire me," Jack smugly
tells him.  "My face is on buses."  The smart script by Terrel Seltzer
and Ellen Simon keeps the barbs flying.
     Melanie is an architect who has a big presentation of her work to
an important client at two o'clock.  Her son will cause her to trip and
smash her big model.
     In a comedy, you have to give the material a lot of leeway.
Although I do not expect accuracy, the treatment of her son in the
office was too far fetched.  Her boss, supposedly, may fire workers if
caught bringing their kids into the office.  Out of character for her,
Melanie denies she is Sammy's mother when her boss sees him there.
     Sometimes the hectic pace is broken by a dreamy musical interlude,
and New York City itself sometimes becomes a visual relaxation point.
For those of you who may have forgotten, there are many lovely sights
there, and ONE FINE DAY shows off several to maximum effect.
     During the day, the parents will face minute by minute tradeoff
decisions about childcare and their jobs.  While most are realistic,
having them all occur in a single day is not, but in a movie it works.
In another all-too-true-to-life scene, Melanie tries to reassure Sammy
with, "You're the most important thing in the world."  "No, I'm not,"
he quickly corrects her.  "Your job is."  What parents have not been
cut to the quick by their children with a line like that?
     The supporting cast is strong, and there is even a cute little
kitten that Jack gets to carry.
     The ending is superb.  "Let's do this right," says Melanie.  "Let
me freshen up so I'll feel a little more like a woman and less like a
dead mommy."  You will never guess how their date ends up.  Or then
again, those of you who are parents may.
     ONE FINE DAY runs 1:48.  It is rated just PG.  There is no sex,
nudity, or violence.  There are a few mild but, nevertheless, needless
profanities.  The lost child scene has some potential of frightening
very young children.  My son Jeffrey, age 7 1/2, gave it a 99 percent
thumbs up.  He downgraded it slightly due to the kissing scene.  (He
made me cover his eyes, but let him peak so he would not miss any of
it.)  He especially liked the part of the mother's broken model and the
way the dad was so playful.  He recommends the film to his friends ages
4 and up.  I'd raise the age to 6 and up, but I certainly recommend the
picture to all parents of kids less than twelve.  For others, I'm not
so sure.  I give the film ** 1/2.
Opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's.

      Charles Durning, Ellen Greene

     ONE FINE DAY has all the ingredients of an enjoyable romantic 
comedy:  a decent premise, likable leads, and a solid supporting cast.  
The problem is, instead of throwing the two main characters together and 
giving them an opportunity to get to know one another, the script 
insists on keeping them apart as they run around New York City, trying 
to sort out one crisis after another.  By the time they finally get a 
chance to snuggle together on a couch, too much time has passed for us 
to be enthralled by the long-delayed magic that materializes.
     Melanie Parks (Michelle Pfeiffer, last seen as the ghost in TO 
GILLIAN ON HER 37TH BIRTHDAY) is a single mom.  She's also a control 
freak, who, in her own words, doesn't have time for friends.  The only 
one who means anything to her is her young son, Sammy (Alex D. Linz), 
who loves his mother, but misses his father (a musician who has trouble 
finding time for him).  Things start going wrong for Melanie when, on 
the day she has the biggest presentation of her career, her son arrives 
late to school and finds the doors locked.  His class has already left 
on a field trip, and Melanie is stuck caring for him for the whole day.
     Meanwhile, Jack Taylor (George Clooney, last seen blasting vampires 
in FROM DUSK TILL DAWN) is in a similar situation.  His newly-married 
ex-wife has left his daughter, Maggie (Mae Whitman), with him for a week 
while she's on her honeymoon.  Jack, a rather disorganized, immature 
individual, is ill-prepared to care for Maggie for an extended period, 
and she, like Sammy, misses the field trip.  Jack and Melanie meet 
outside of the school, and immediately begin sniping at each other.  
But, in the time-honored romantic comedy tradition, their barbs hide 
their true feelings, which gradually surface over the course of the next 
ninety minutes.
     Michelle Pfeiffer and George Clooney make an appealing couple.  
They're both charismatic, and, when they're together, they generate 
sufficient electricity for us to want them to stay that way.  
Unfortunately, ONE FINE DAY keeps them separated for much of its running 
time.  Both Melanie and Jack are in the midst of work-related 
emergencies, and the film is determined to pursue their careers with as 
much vigor as it pursues their personal lives.  Frankly, however, Jack's 
attempts to verify the veracity of a newspaper column he wrote and 
Melanie's juggling of meetings don't make for compelling viewing.  Those 
elements are filler, and, because we want to see more of Melanie and 
Jack together, they're unwanted and irritating.
     ONE FINE DAY also moves at a breakneck pace, with a digital readout 
of the time occasionally appearing on screen to remind us that the hours 
and minutes are rushing by.  The contrivance of having a series of 
deadlines that come and go makes everything seem frantic.  Everyone in 
this film is under constant pressure, so there's no time for a quiet 
moment of dialogue.  It's all rather exhausting, with a payoff that 
isn't adequate for what we go through to get there.
     One saving grace is that the child actors, Mae Whitman and Alex D. 
Linz, give natural, unaffected performances.  They don't call attention 
to themselves, and, as a bonus, neither is so insufferably cute that you 
feel the sudden desire to strangle them.  Both consistently respond to 
all of ONE FINE DAY's crazy circumstances the same way any normal kid 
might, and they mesh well with their older, more experienced co-stars.
     ONE FINE DAY has a few enchanting moments, such as a scene where 
Jack sweeps Melanie off her feet (literally), then splashes around in a 
large puddle of water.  However, as a romantic comedy, this is a spotty 
affair because it's not really funny or romantic enough.  Keeping the 
leads apart might work for something like SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, where 
the intention is to develop an old-fashioned, long-distance romance, 
but, in a movie like this -- one that's being pulled in so many 
directions that it's coming apart at the seams -- it's a mistake.  For 
much of its running length, ONE FINE DAY lacks focus and direction, and 
that makes it one fine mess.

"One Fine Day" is yet another romanctic comedy in the "Sleepless in
Seattle" vein.  It has two people in love, two cute kids, and jobs that
are just too much for an ordinary person to handle.  But, "One Fine Day"
is a film that is rather hostile.
Michelle Pfieffer and George Clooney play the title characters, and they
meet when taking their kids to school, one fine morning.  They are
amazingly hostile towards one another, which of course means, in movies
like this, that they are in love.
Pfieffer's character, Melanie Parker, is an archictect.  I never knew that
being and architect was as stressful as it is portrayed in this film.
Clooney's character, Jack Taylor, is a columnist for a New York newspaper.
 I never would have guessed that being a newspaper columnist was as
exciting as it is portrayed in this film.  What I think the film tries to
do is take all of the stress involved with being a single, working parent,
and cram it all into one fine day.  It seems that the tension is
amplified.
The main problem for both of them is that they have to spend the day with
their kids; both are divorced.  And there are no available babysitters, as
neither of them have a nanny.  So, their fine day becomes "take your kids
to work day," as they switch kids, switch cell phones, and switch hostile
dialogue, all the while one contrivance after another is played out before
our very eyes.  These are the type of contrivances that invites everyone
to the edge of their seat, as they hope that things will go okay for the
protagonist.
"One Fine Day" is not a boring film, and it is not a bad film.  But its
sweet and mushy tone tries to numb us from the convention, which therefore
*is* the film's tone, and its dialogue.  The two main characters, Parker
and Taylor, are always arguing and remain reluctant to deal with their
emotions toward each other, as if their jobs have made them cynical and
sheltered.  But, "Jerry Maguire" is a much better film about people whose
jobs interfere with their lives, and it plays itself out with realistic
observations; "One Fine Day" is played for quick, cheap laughs, and
temporary gasps.  For example, all of the scenes where the cute little boy
keeps spilling things on his mommy's work clothes, when Mommy has
important presentations to give, most of which seem like shabby little
get-togethers and meetings where she must impress someone who is easily
impressed.  A lot of the film's early humor consists of the character
saying one thing, and then, in irony, the opposite has to be done.
I saw a paralell in this film between the growing relationship of the two
adults, and the relationship of the two six-year old children.  Both
consist of a lot of insignificant arguing, and bickering, while you get
the sense that it is being done to cover the emotions that are really
there, but not being dealt with out of fear and cynicism.  George
Clooney's character seems to be a kid in an adult's body, and he was
totally unconvincing as a man who happens to be a writer.  In the film,
the occupation of its characters are simply plot devices to present some
kind of urgency and delima, to keep the film at a fast pace.
"One Fine Day" is like a romanticised "Home Alone" for adults.  Its
fast-paced, and full of clever, yet cheap little traps, some of which I
admit I enjoyed.  But the detachment of both of the characters threw me
off, and it didn't seem as if either one was capable of holding a
conversation for more than five minutes.  The film is cute, but it is a
rather unromantic Romantic Comedy that has one fine day to lead up to one
fine romantic moment, which isn't as complete as it could have been.  Oh,
and it wasn't such a fine day after all; it rained.
