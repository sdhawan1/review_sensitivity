_The_Deep_End_of_the_Ocean_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
Michelle Pfeiffer turns in an impassioned performance of often
gut-wrenching intensity in a film that deserves far less.  It's not that
the basic story is without promise.  Beth Cappadora (Pfeiffer) loses her
three-year-old son, only to have him resurface on her doorstep nine years
later with no recollection of his former family (Ryan Merriman plays the
now-12-year-old son).  It's a setup ripe with psychological and emotional
conflict, and apparently Jacquelyn Mitchard did it justice in her novel of
the same name, which was not only a bestseller but none other than a
selection in Oprah Winfrey's book club.
However, director Ulu Grosbard and scripter Stephen Schiff follow
pedestrian TV-movie-like paces, from the abrupt and overly tidy ending to
the rebelliously-bitter-yet-guilt-ridden older brother, well-played by
Emmy-winning _General_Hospital_ star Jonathan Jackson.  In fact, all the
characters are well-played by the actors.  It's just that the material is
about as shallow as its deeply metaphoric title (the meaning of which, for
the record, is never explained in the film).

Adapted from Jacquelyn Mitchard's best-seller - which had the
distinction of being the first novel honored as an Oprah Winfrey book
club selection - "The Deep End of the Ocean" is a flawed but often
effective family drama that turns on the deepest fear of every parent
or guardian: that one dumb move, a single moment of neglect that can
turn the rest of your life inside out.
Though she somehow keeps things together, forgetful and disorganized
Beth Cappadora (Michelle Pfeiffer) is no model mom. But neither does
she deserve what happens to her after she makes the foolish decision
to take her three kids to her high school reunion in Chicago.  Shortly
after the family arrives in town, Beth's 3-year-old son Ben
disappears, sparking a frantic search that culminates with Beth
standing outside a detectives' office, listening to cops speculating
about whether or not Ben is still alive.
Predictably, the effect of this on Beth, her husband Pat (Treat
Williams) and the Cappadora's 7-year-old son Vincent (Cory Buck) is
cataclysmic, and director Ulu Grosbard manages to make this section of
the story both taut and heartwrenching. In one of the movie's sharpest
scenes, Vincent uses his baby sister Kerry to curtail a bitter fight
between Beth and Pat, who accuses his wife ofhaving "made a career out
of being unhappy."
At this point, "Ocean" jumps ahead nine years to show us the aftermath
of the tragedy on the household; the Cappadoras have survived, but
everyone's a little worse for the wear. Then everything changes again,
thanks to a near-miraculous discovery, the kind of twist of fate that
tends to happen more often in literature than in real life.
But if the plot goes off the deep end, even throwing in a caring
detective (Whoopi Goldberg) who becomes Beth's best friend, the
movie's emotional core is solid and the understated performances - a
Grosbard trademark - ensure that "Ocean" gets the tearducts working
overtime.  Pfeiffer, Buck and Jonathan Jackson (who plays Vincent at
age 16) are particularly good at getting across their characters'
emotional states without grandstanding.
Credit screenwriter Stephen Schiff (who did the similarly subtle
recent adaptation of "Lolita") with keeping what could have been a
soapy free-for-all under control. Once it has exhausted its surprises,
"Ocean" calms down to become a thoughtful, observant study of
self-persecution and the power of forgiveness.

It is easy to label something sentimental or tear jerking when one has
not experienced the heartache of losing a child  whether that may be in
life or in death. After having said that, I will also say that this
movie does all of the above very well. One gets that choking sensation
in the throat (because of grief) when one brother forgives another for a
costly mistake, or when a husband hugs his wife after a long
estrangement.
There is no ocean, no drownings and it does not conjure up memories of
yet another Ordinary People'. In fact the only thing remotely connected
to the ocean is probably tap water and the toilet flushing (not that
this literally happened in the movie). So what are the lessons learnt:
1. Don't take your children to class reunions.
2. Don't leave them alone in the lobby, not even for a second.
Michelle Pfeiffer once again plays the role of a highly-strung wife and
mother, a trend that started with A Thousand Acres' and One Fine Day'.
My comment is that she is exceptionally fine strung in this movie, so
much so that when she has a nervous break down, the veins on her temples
bulge impressively. Whoopi Golberg also puts in an understated
performance, playing a lesbian cop, with a name that makes one want to
reach for a lollipop. Lastly, who are the ideal companions for this sort
of movie  my grandmother comes to mind.

All movies begin with a script, and all scripts begin as idle thoughts
in the minds of writers. Most scripts, that is, because there are those
which aren't written directly from the screen and instead adapted from
novels, plays, short stories, articles, and compendia of all kind. The
latest is THE DEEP END OF THE OCEAN, an adaptation of Jacquelyn
Mitchard's novel by TRUE CRIME writer Stephen Schiff. While this Ulu
Grosbard film features some powerfully thematic content regarding the
strength of family ties, however, audiences and industry experts will
file this one away as evidence of the inferior nature of adapted movies. 
DEEP END tells the story of the Beth (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Pat (Treat
Williams) Cappadora. The Cappadoras are loving folks who show their
affection for each other by appending "-y" to one another's names, and
we like them instantly. Turns out they're raising three children in
Madison, Wisconsin, during the late 1980's -- three, that is, until
their youngest goes missing in a crowded Chicago hotel lobby at Beth's
high school reunion. Nearly a decade later, the Cappadoras have pieced
their life back together and are living well in a suburb of Chicago when
Beth spots a kid on their block whom she supposes to be their lost boy.
Under a different name, now, it's with the help of Detective Supervisor
Candy Bliss (Whoopi Goldberg) that they establish his identity and go
through the process of reintroducing him to the family. 
Unfortunately all of this comes off as a very lightweight drama for many
of the same reasons that caused the demise of last year's STEPMOM.
Adapted from a novel, the screenplay is by nature very brief, and, like
STEPMOM it cuts from scene to scene without building any true depth. The
characters are real enough, and acted well by the principals, but most
importantly they are simply cardboard cutouts which can be easily
dropped into any scene. Also, like STEPMOM, what should be a significant
and weighty event in a family's life is left largely unresolved or
treated with little respect. The return of the lost child (Ryan
Merriman) is not the focus of the movie; instead, the film's center of
interest is the shallow relationship between Beth and Pat. 
On the positive side, the movie has a very good nature to it, and if not
for the significant tragedy involved it could almost be called a
feel-good movie. This uplifiting nature is something that was missing
from both STEPMOM as well as Pfeiffer's last live-action role in the
tragic drama A THOUSAND ACRES. Here, the theme of the strength of family
is decidedly the director's favorite, and we feel its winning qualities
in the end. Although all loose ends are not tied in the movie's running
time, they are implicitly resolved, and for this the audience is
grateful. The performances of all involved are vital to this success,
and for this Pfeiffer, Williams, Goldberg, Merriman, and Jonathan
Jackson (in the role of the Cappadoras' elder son) are to be commended.
On the whole, however, there's too many small mistakes or an overbearing
theme that's not present to call this movie a wholly fulfilling watch.

Starring Michelle Pfeiffer, Treat Williams, Jonathan Jackson, Ryan 
Merriman, John Kapelos, Whoopi Goldberg
The Deep End of the Ocean is a drama based on the bestselling book by 
Jacqueline Mitchard (sp?). I'm sure the book itself is fine, but it 
was probably not a good idea to transfer it to film. Many scenes, 
such as one where Michelle Pfeiffer breaks down in an emotional fit 
and bites her husband's hand, may have read well on paper, but on 
film all they do is provoke laughter from the audience.              
Pfeiffer is a mother of three whose younger son Ben is kidnapped 
while she was making reservations at her high school reunion. The 
first half of the film deals with the aftermath of this loss and how 
the family copes with it. Pfeiffer turns into an emotional recluse 
and the older son Vincent starts to    
rebel. The father, played by Treat Williams, tries his best to hold 
the family together. The film takes way too much time here, telling 
us very little. It doesn't favor comparably with an early 80s film 
called Without a Trace. Kate Nelligan's cold, distant performance as 
the mother in that film was far more interesting and dramatically 
effective than Michelle Pfeiffer's crying and shouting here.
Then the setting shifts to nine years later, where the family has 
moved to a suburban neighborhood in Chicago. Everyone except Vincent 
seems to have recovered from the incident and the family appears to 
have moved on with their lives. One day a young boy shows up at their 
door asking if they   
need their lawn mowed. He lookes remarkably like Ben, the kidnapped 
son. A fingerprint match confirms this and Ben is reunited with his 
family.
The film here tries to explore complex relationships within the 
family and with Ben's adoptive father, who he still calls dad. The 
filmmakers are far more successful here, but there are still problems.
 As Ben, young Ryan Merriman is not up to the challenge of playing 
such a complex role. Not enough is done with Ben's adoptive father, 
played with admirable honesty by John Kapelos. In particular, the 
final scene feels false because it was not preceded by a scene with 
Kapelos and Merriman, that wouldve been crucial to the plot 
development.
If there is one great thing in The Deep End of the Ocean, it is 
Jonathan Jackson's portrayal of the older Vincent. The films most 
touching moments come when it explores the relationship of the two 
brothers, and this is mostly due to the strength and depth of 
Jackson's performance. He is so good, we can predict a scene of 
personal revelation one hour before the screenplay decides it's time 
to tell us in the final scene, And the final scene works on it's own, 
but it needed a preceding scene with Kapelos and a followup scene 
with the parents. Many more wounds needed to be healed but 
unfortunately the screenwriter was too lazy to attempt that.

 Deep End of the Ocean (1999) 3 stars out of 4. Starring Michelle Pfeiffer,
Treat Williams, Ryan Merriman, Jonathan Jackson and Whoopi Goldberg.
 For a parent, losing a child is the unthinkable. Nothing can assuage the
guilt or the void.
 The only way a parent can cope is to survive day-by-day and use
distractions to keep the buried memories from welling up and drowning him
or her.
 It is bad enough when a child is killed, but what if the child disappears,
is kidnapped, stolen? The uncertainty, the not knowing if that child is
alive or dead, can be so overwhelming that a parent can cease to function
as a parent and merely exist. Like the child, the parent disappears, but it
is into the self.
 All this is touched upon in "The Deep End of the Ocean" a powerful film
based on Jacqueline Mitchard's best-selling novel.
 Attending her 15-year high school reunion in Chicago, Beth Cappadora
(Michelle Pfeiffer) steps away for a moment from her young sons, 7-year-old
Vincent and 3-year-old Ben, in a crowded hotel lobby.
 When she returns, Ben is gone. He is nowhere to be found.
 Torn by despair and guilt, Beth retreats into herself, merely going
through the motions of daily life.
 Eventually the family moves from their Madison, Wis., home to Chicago
where Beth's husband, Pat (Treat Williams), fulfills his dream of opening a
restaurant.
 Nine years pass. Then one day, a miracle.
 A young boy is at the door talking to Beth's daughter, Kerry. His name is
Sam, and he lives a couple of blocks away.
 Yet Beth recognizes him as Ben. And so the family is reunited and whole again.
 The reason for divulging so much of the plot is because the story is
secondary.
 Even the circumstances surrounding Ben's kidnapping is explained in one or
two sentences.
 No, it's the emotions that resonate through the film, created by the
various situations that dominate "The Deep End of the Ocean."
 Beth and Pat are overjoyed. They have their son back.
 Vincent, however, is jealous, resentful. He has spent his growing years
fighting with a ghost for his mother's attention. Now that ghost is in the
flesh and he is again, the odd child out.
 And what about Ben/Sam. Beth and Pat may love him and shower him with
affection, but to him they are strangers. The boy is torn between his
new-found family and the love and protection of the man who raised him -
the only family he remembers.
 Pfeiffer gives a very taut, controlled performance as Beth. In a part
where the temptation for any actress might be to allow your feelings to
overflow the screen, Pfeiffer keeps herself contained, showing occasional
bursts of anger, confusion, pain, defiance and guilt.
 Williams has his best role in years. His Pat is the ultimate family man.
He, too, mourns the loss of Ben, but he refuses to wallow in self-pity. He
knows that the his son and daughter are still there, needing his support
and strength.
 The acting honors, though, go to a trio of young performers: Cory Buck,
Jonathan Jackson and Ryan Merriman.
 As young Vincent, Buck shows the resentment of being forced to grow up
quickly and become mama's little helper. He comes home from school to take
care of his sister, and displays his anger by casually smashing a vase.
 Jackson plays the teen-age Vincent, a rebellious youth bursting with guilt
and resentment. The shadow of Ben stands between him and his mother, and he
can do nothing to overcome it.
 Ryan Merriman is compelling as Sam, a boy torn from the world he knows and
thrust into the bosom of well-meaning, kind-hearted strangers who profess
to love him, yet hold him prisoner emotionally.
 Whoopi Goldberg also makes an impact in the supporting role of the police
detective trying to find Ben.
Director Ulu Grosbard uses a deft touch to keep the action moving. He does
not overplay his hand. He is a subtle manager. The scene in which
Goldberg's detective explains her sexual preference to Beth is done
matter-of-factly with no special emphasis, for example.
 Grosbard elicits a naturalness from his actors, showing them coping, or
failing to cope, under extraordinary circumstances.
 "The Deep End of the Ocean's" first half-hour-plus is peak filmmaking. And
while the rest of the movie cannot hold the intensity of the first act, it
still is gripping entertainment.
 "The Deep End of the Ocean" is intelligent, adult drama.

Susan Granger's review of "THE DEEP END OF THE OCEAN" (Columbia Pictures)
Based on Jacquelyn Mitchard's 1996 deeply moving novel, this
family drama revolves around every parent's worst nightmare: losing a
child. Michelle Pfeiffer plays Beth Cappadora, a loving, devoted
mother who juggles the demands of caring for her family with a career
as a photographer.  With her three small children, she arrives at a
Chicago hotel for her 15th highschool reunion weekend and, when she
glances away for a moment, her three year-old son disappears in the
middle of a crowded lobby. Despite a desperate search, he vanishes
without a trace. This tragedy has a devastating effect on Beth, her
husband (Treat Williams), and family but, eventually, their lives
return to some degree of normalcy - until, nine years later, a 12
year-old boy (Ryan Merriman) knocks on their door. Could it be he?
With the help of a tenacious police detective (Whoopi Goldberg), they
unravel a tangled web leading to a reunion which, in turn, raises
another emotionally wrenching dilemma. The boy has no memory of his
biological family, having been raised by a loving, adoptive father
(John Kapelos). What should they do?
Director Ulu Gossbard handles the melodramatic story with
sensitivity and the cast is superb. I find fault with the
stereotypical Hollywood ending but any other resolution might also not
play well. Problem is: there is no credible, satisfying answer for
everyone involved, which was the problem with "Losing Isiah," a
previous film that tackled the same subject matter. Three-time Oscar
nominee Michelle Pfeiffer delivers another memorable performance, and
she spear-headed the development of this film through her company Via
Rosa. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The Deep End of the
Ocean" is a powerful, thought-provoking 7, a heartbreaking story.

The meaning behind the mysterious title of "The Deep End of the Ocean" -
which remains unexplained even as the closing credits crawl up the
screen - may have something to do with the nearly bottomless mass of
troubled waters it covers. There's no bridge to cross over them here;
the movie immerses you directly into every parent's worst nightmare
within minutes of its opening. The result is an intriguing exploration
of familial bonds that, even in its missteps, avoids the manipulative,
tear-jerking techniques that would seem to come with the territory.
Credit restrained work by director Ulu Grosbard, screenwriter Steven
Schiff and their cast for the blessed idiosyncrasy.
This adaptation of the best-selling, hot-button novel by Jacqueline
Mitchard (also Oprah Winfrey's first book club selection) wisely casts
Michelle Pfeiffer in the lead role, a happy suburban Wisconsin mom who
drags her three young kids to a high school reunion - and loses track of
the middle child, a three-year-old boy, somewhere in the thick crowds of
the hotel lobby. He vanishes without a trace, much like the premise of a
1983 drama called "Without a Trace," leaving her and her husband (Treat
Williams) crushed with blame and grief. A helpful, matter-of-fact
detective (Whoopi Goldberg) aids them, but to no avail.
Nine years, countless tears and a move to Chicago later, a neighborhood
kid (Ryan Merriman) shows up on their doorstep offering to mow the lawn,
and Pfeiffer's maternal and/or gut feelings lead her to believe he's her
long-lost child. Whether that's true or not will have to be divulged by
watching the actual film or its coming attraction, which inappropriately
spills those beans as well as a few others. A surprise not given away
within those very detailed two-and-a-half-minutes, however, is that
"Deep End" goes long on its wrenching set-up, meaning that said plot
revelation doesn't occur until the movie's latter half. That's great for
developmental purposes.
Audiences spend a precious chunk of the running time submerged in
Pfeiffer's weeping and teeth-gnashing histrionics (Williams gets to do a
little lamenting as well), but none of it feels forced, staged or fueled
by a vain quest for an Oscar nomination - one of the biggest compliments
you can pay a film like this. If Pfeiffer's awesome portrayal of
emotional devastation is the key to "Deep End"'s success - and, very
likely, among her best work ever - then co-star Jonathan Jackson rates a
close second on the asset scale. Jackson, an Emmy-winner for his work on
"General Hospital," plays the older version of her eldest son, and
dignifies a rebellious teen-cliche in doing so.
To trump Pfeiffer and Jackson is not to take away from two other
noteworthy turns, nor does it suggest that performances are the only
thing going for "Deep End" - though they do provide a fine selling
point. Merriman, occasionally seen on the NBC series "The Pretender,"
conveys conflicted conscience at a remarkably early age, while Williams
acquits himself memorably in a role destined to be overlooked next to
his co-star's showier part. A lesser film might use this collective
acting showcase as its sole claim to justify cinematic treatment for a
story that sounds very TV-movie-ish, but rarely are TV-movies so
balanced in their portrayal of character and crisis.
Well, for a good, long while at least. The dynamite first hour gives way
to a problematic lead-up to a problematic conclusion, where resolutions
are too pat and dealings with the dilemma's flip side are shaky at best
- not to mention the existence of a _huge_ plot convenience that you
must accept in order for the movie to click. That last weakness can be
easily overlooked on the merits of the film's strong build-up alone, but
diminishing "The Deep End of the Ocean"'s powerful perspective is how it
fully details the early goings-on and moves through later passages like
an abridged Cliffs Notes summary. Final cut-tamperings have been
rumored, which would seem to be the case.
Still, it's difficult to come down very hard on a film that accomplishes
most of what it sets out to do, and even more so one that provides a
plethora of perfect small moments along the way: Pfeiffer breaking down
over Christmas presents that will never be opened, Jackson providing an
old stuffed animal as a silent peace offering, Merriman bonding with his
potential parents through a Greek folkdance. Missteps may be amassed as
"The Deep End of the Ocean" nears its hopeful whimper of a final scene,
but it's too late - lingering in the memory already are striking imagery
and some very intriguing food for thought.

Directed by Ulu Grosbard.
Cast: Michelle Pfeiffer, Treat Williams, Ryan Merriman, Jonathan 
Jackson, Whoopi Goldberg, John Kapelos, Cory Buck, Michael McElroy, 
Alexa Vega, Lucinda Jenney.
1999 - 108 minutes.
Rated PG-13 (for profanity).
Reviewed March 13, 1999.
Based on the Jacqelyn Mitchard novel, "The Deep End of the Ocean" has 
allegedly experienced a rocky road to the big screen, and it shows. 
Reshoots ensued several months after already wrapping, and although the 
press kit read that the film was 148 minutes, it actually was forty 
minutes shorter. Was that a mistake on the kit, when it should have said 
1:48, or was it really cut by nearly 3/4 of an hour? My guess would be 
the latter, since large chunks of the film seemed to be missing, and 
despite the exemplary performances from the whole cast, the editing is 
admittedly pretty shoddy.
The film begins in 1988 in Madison, Wisconsin, as joyful photographer 
and mother, Beth Cappadora (Michelle Pfeiffer), leaves her husband, Pat 
(Treat Williams), to go to her high school reunion, bringing along her 
three children, 7-year-old Vincent (Cory Buck), 3-year-old Ben (Michael 
McElroy), and infant daughter, Kerry. While in the hotel lobby where the 
reunion is being held, Beth walks away from a brief moments to check in, 
telling Vincent to hold Ben's hand, but when she returns, Ben is nowhere 
to be found. Immediately thereafter, a highly-publicized search starts 
for Ben, headed by investigator Candy Bliss (Whoopi Goldberg), but to no 
avail, and Beth, cloaked in a smothering vail of grief and remorse, 
starts to nearly ignore her other kids, notably Vincent, leaving it up 
to Pat to take on the central parent role. Switching forward nine years, 
the Cappadora family has relocated in the suburbs of Chicago and Beth 
has finally been able to get her life back together. And then the 
unthinkable happens: one summer day, Beth is greeted at the door by 
12-year-old Sam (Ryan Merriman), who lives two blocks away and asks to 
mow her lawn for her. Put into a near frenzy of sudden joy and hope, 
Beth becomes convinced that "Sam" is actually Ben, and her belief is 
reassured when Det. Bliss informs her that the fingerprints match. The 
less said about the further developments in the storyline, the better, 
since there are a few surprises. 
"The Deep End of the Ocean" is a rather frustrating drama because, on 
the one hand, it is a realistic and beautifully acted drama with several 
touching moments that come out of the screenplay, instead of taking the 
easy route and plucking at the heartstrings with maudlin melodrama. But 
then, coming away from the film, the flaws gradually began to shine 
through more clearly, not the least of being that nothing is really 
dealt with in a satisfactory manner as it seems to be constantly rushing 
to its conclusion which, by the way, feels tacked-on and unbelievable. 
While some characters are given satisfactory screen time and are handled 
well (Pfeiffer, Jackson, Merriman), others remain underdeveloped and 
pushed to the side-lines (John Kapelos, as the man whom Ben thought was 
his father, Williams, and Alexa Vega, as Beth and Pat's youngest child, 
Kerry). Also, several occurrences in the story are treated by only a 
shot of something (for the last half of the film, Pat sleeps on the 
couch, signifying marriage problems), or are brought up and then 
immediately forgotten (the question of who Ben will celebrate 
Thanksgiving with).
As already noted, nothing negative could possibly be said about the fine 
performances. Michelle Pfieffer is always authentic in her wide range of 
emotions, as a mother who is devastated and blames herself for her son's 
disappearance. Treat Williams, a generally underused actor (although put 
to good, chilling use in the 1986 masterpiece, "Smooth Talk"), is 
satisfying as Pat, Beth's husband, even if he could have had more to do. 
And as for the children, the standout performance of the whole cast is 
Ryan Merriman, making his feature film debut, who is truly touching as 
the boy who finds himself torn between the man he has always thought was 
his father, and his biological parents. Merriman is never anything short 
of astounding, and is a new, refreshingly talented find. Jonathan 
Jackson, as the misunderstood and oft-times ignored 16-year-old Vincent, 
shows that he has a lot more going for him, after all, than the soap 
opera he is on, "General Hospital," and if this film is any indication, 
Jackson should get off that show while he still has a chance at a 
prosperous film career. Meanwhile, in a minor role, Whoopi Goldberg is 
effective as the caring Candy Bliss, and has one zinger of a line after 
announcing her name ("I know, it sounds like a Las Vegas stripper"). In 
one peculiar scene, however, Det. Bliss tells Beth, for no apparent 
reason, that she is a lesbian, but what exactly was the point, since 
nothing is made of this revelation after Candy brings it up?
"The Deep End of the Ocean" is a respectable family drama, but is all 
the more disappointing since it is obvious that it could have been so 
much more. There is no doubt in my mind that much of the film's problems 
is due to what ended up lying on the cutting room floor, and I wonder 
exactly why Columbia decided to cut it like they did. I was never bored 
by the film, and if about fifteen to thirty minutes had been added, many 
of my criticisms would probably have vanished, or at least lessened. The 
performances in "The Deep End of the Ocean" are so strong and assured 
that it's too bad the obviously truncated screenplay didn't hold up its 
half of the bargain.

I won't go into the other classifications, except to say that this study,
subsidized with millions in governmental and private grants, is still in a
preliminary stage. Its tiniest category is "crying eyes." I have been able
to come up only with two actors: Sylvia Sidney.in older times; and Michelle
Pfeiffer in this generation.
Ms Pfeiffer is a wonderful actress and a beauty with class. I've always
sensed that her eyes were sad--and not only in moments that call for
sadness. Over and above screen parts and moods, I am sure that the eyes had
it.
The whites of her eyes are tinged with pink. So are the eyelids. Given her
attractive features, Ms. Pfeiffer gets a lot of close-ups.Time and again,
she looks like someone who is about to cry or has just finished crying.
The Deep End of the Ocean confirms this.Beth (Pfeiffer), is what makes the
movie with her unending sadness. I was continuously conscious of the pink.
Beth, a freelance photographer,is the happy wife of restaurateur Pat. They
have three children: Vincent, 7; Ben, 3; baby girl Kerry. They live in
Madison, Wisconsin. The year is 1988.
For a high school reunion of the class of 1973, Beth drives to a Chicago
hotel with all her brood.There, in the packed, high-decibel lobby, she goes
to register after leaving the younger kids in the care of the 7-year old.
When she returns, Ben has vanished. In spite of able police -- men and
women under the high-ranked Candy (Whoopi Goldberg),-- of volunteers,
posters and eager efforts, the three-year old is never found.
The portrait of a devastated family, with Beth as the central focus, is
powerful. Pfeiffer's despair is entirely convincing, totally wrenching.
>From bleeding --metaphorically--from all her pores she falls into a near
indifference which at times skirts catatonia. Beth is at the point where
she almost goes off the deep end -- which does not, however, justify the
dull title of the novel and of the film.
The family unravels, not in major, theatrical ways, but deeply nonetheless.
A typical scene has Beth in her bedroom, oblivious that the baby is crying.
Vincent goes to help the infant. But on his way out he pushes a vase that
crashes on the floor. Dysfunction follows duty.
Nine years later, the Cappadoras are now in Chicago where Pat opens a new
Italian restaurant. Vincent, at 16, is a rather bad, sullen boy, even
dislikable -- until you consider his peculiar family circle. Beth, still
doleful-looking, seems to have recovered somewhat, She's resumed some of
her photography.
Here begin the improbabilities. Sam, an unknown, 12-year old neighboring
boy, nice and polite, shows up, offering to mow the Kappadora's lawn. Beth
almost immediately recognizes him as the vanished Ben. She takes pictures
of him. With a speed that would make Kodak happy but puzzle photographers
who work out a basement darkroom, she develops the photographs, juxtaposes
them with old ones of Ben, and voila! Proof positive.
It turns out that Ben had been abducted by an unstable friend of Beth's (I
got a bit confused here), who then married nice Greek-American George
Karras. She later committed suicide. But Sam loved his "mother" and his
adoptive father. When the authorities ascertain that Sam is Ben and return
him to his biological parents, the young boy is not happy. Nor is George
who adores the kid and is as devastated as the Kappadoras were back in
1988.
(Incidentally, between Madison '88 and Chicago '97 Michelle Pfeiffer,
though a little more gaunt, has not changed or aged a bit!)
The Ben-found part is followed by Ben-lost-again as he sneaks back to
George Karras. In Act IV however, the boy, upon reflection, returns to the
Kappadoras, at least for now. It's a mixed picture: no guarantees, no
commitment on his part, no closure to the saga.
What's involved in these off-on proceedings strikes me as the result of
having a script that unavoidably shortens the original, a hefty,
best-selling novel. The cuts sometimes lead to choppiness and
simplifications.
On the other hand, I like the fact that the director does not invest in
excesses of sentimentalism. Belgian-born Ulu Grossbard has been a
successful stage director who occasionally makes forays into motion
pictures. His first feature, The Subject was Roses (1968) was a fine
adaptation of a Pulitzer prize winning play. His third, Straight Time,
starred Dustin Hoffman as a paroled convict in a milieu of powerful
supporting actors. It was impressive. True Confessions, Falling in Love and
Georgia were not hits but each had remarkable elements.
To  bring  together the rebellious Vincent and the confused Ben,  the film
uses as fact and metaphor, driveway basketball competition. The young men
are very good as players (actors) and as players (ball). The device works
well  -- yet I'd have to see the movie again to decide whether this is a
clever gimmick or a true dramatic touch.

Based on the best-selling novel of the same name, this film recreates a
nightmarish situation to which all parents could identify: the sudden
disappearance of a child. Michelle Pfeiffer takes on the role of the
absent-minded mom who loses the boy, while Treat Williams portrays the
steadfast and patient husband.
PLOT:
Regular family of mom, dad and three kids. Mom takes trip with kids, and
leaves her two sons alone in a hotel lobby for a few minutes. When she
returns, the younger boy has disappeared. They try to find him but to no
avail. Nine years later, the boy unknowingly shows up at her front porch
soliciting a lawn-mowing gig. His fingerprints are a match. Now, they must
survive his return and their ongoing struggles to cope with their divergent
feelings.
CRITIQUE:
Take a TV movie of the week, add two dashes of a solid actress via Michelle
Pfeiffer, an interesting, if not mostly given away by its own trailer,
storyline, some hugs, some tears, and you've got yourself a film whose title
still doesn't fully make much sense to me. Now despite me knowing exactly
what was going to happen up until the halfway point of this movie, this film
conquered the impossible, and still managed not to bore me too much. It did
however lack the overall emotional authenticity for me to qualify it as a
solid all-out dramatic piece of filmmaking. The acting was also a
half-and-halfer with Pfeiffer pulling off an excellent mom going through all
the obvious stages of grief and guilt-syndrome, while others like Whoopie
Goldberg stuck out like a sore thumb (That's right, she plays Whoopie
again!).
I also found the missing kid to be lacking much of the conviction needed for
his complex role. His character always seemed indifferent and emotionless,
and whether or not that was the actor's fault or that of the screenwriter, I
didn't quite find his full-circle plight all that believable. Having said
that, Jonathan Jackson playing the older brother was super in his role, and
Treat Williams, well, Treat Williams continues his artistic trek to restore
some much-needed legitimacy to his acting career. Mrs. JoBlo enjoyed this
film much more than I did, but I suppose that was to be quite expected,
considering the subject matter of the picture. All in all, I didn't think it
was a bad movie, but did wonder about its need for giant screen
presentation. The TV tube and a Sunday night would have been fine. All in
all, it is Pfeiffer and Jackson that give this movie some worth, with the
story never running into major boring moments (or any exciting ones for that
matter), and qualifying this movie as a worthy candidate for a video rental.
You might even want to check it out in the theatres, if you've been feeling
sensitive of late, and want a good cry. That, or if you're really intrigued
by its premise.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
The novel on which this film is based was endorsed by Oprah Winfrey's
wonderful Book Club. In fact, it was the first book picked by the super-rich
talk-show queen back in September of 1996.

THE DEEP END OF THE OCEAN (M).  
(Columbia/Manadaly/Village Roadshow)
Director: Ulu Grosbard
Stars: Michelle Pfeiffer, Treat Williams, Whoopi Goldberg, Jonathan 
Jackson, Ryan Merriman, John 
Kapelos, Cory Buck, Alexa Vega, Michael McGrady, Tony Musante
Running time: 108 minutes.
Writer Stephen Schiff (Lolita, the recent True Crime, etc) has
done a good job of adapting Jacquelyn Mitchard's best-selling novel
for the screen, and he turns the film into a compelling study of the
psychological damage a family can inflict upon itself under times of
great emotional stress.
The film opens in 1988, when photographer Beth Cappadora
(Michelle Pfeiffer) heads off to a school reunion in Chicago with her
three young children in tow.  In the hotel lobby though her son Ben
mysteriously disappears.  Despite an intense police search and
investigation, the boy is never found.
Nine years later, the family has got on with their lives,
although the tensions, guilt and doubts are still simmering away just
beneath the surface.  The Cappadoras have permanently moved to
Chicago, where Pat (Treat Williams, from The Prince Of The City, etc)
has opened a restaurant with his father and Beth has re-established
her career as a photographer.  Then one day a boy knocks on their
door, offering to cut their lawn.  Beth immediately recognises him as
Ben.
At first, The Deep End Of the Ocean's premise reads a little
like that of Olivier, Olivier, the 1993 French film in which a teenage
hustler tries to convince a family that he is their missing son.
However, in this solid and touching drama, the twist is the boy is
really the Cappadora's missing son.  Ben, or Sam as he is now known,
has been raised by his adoptive father George (John Kapelos), who was
unaware of his origins.
Sam's return brings with it a whole new set of complications,
and the emotional ripples further threaten the family.  Sam's presence
also begins the healing process between Beth and her strangely
disturbed teenage son Vincent (Jonathan Jackson, a star of tv soap
General Hospital), who is consumed by his own guilty secrets.
Another intriguing aspect of the film is the way in which the
characters have changed during the decade.  The only member of the
family who seems unaffected by these events is daughter Kerry (Alexa
Vega), who is given little screen time anyway.
Pfeiffer delivers an unusually strong and emotionally
demanding performance as Beth, who grows stronger and more confident
and controlled.  Jackson is excellent as Vincent, while Williams is
also surprisingly good as he portrays Pat's slow disintegration.
Whoopi Goldberg brings unusual restraint to her smaller role as a
sympathetic detective who befriends the Cappadora family.
Hailing from a theatrical background, Ulu Grosbard is a
director known for his solid character driven films (Straight Time,
Georgia, etc), and he brings a deep emotional resonance to this study
of a family in crisis.  He explores this emotionally complex and rich
material without becoming too manipulative, and keeps the mood
deliberately restrained and understated.  While Grosbard effectively
pushes a number of buttons, The Deep End Of The Ocean is never quite
the tear jerker that it could have been.

It was just for a moment.  Okay, maybe two.  You looked away or you
stepped away, and now the most important thing in your entire life is
gone.  Your child was right there.  From that now empty space there
screams a silent cry.
It's every parent's worst nightmare, and, as we all know, it happens to
us all.  Usually, we search and the child turns out to be just a few
feet away, but in a panic we miss seeing him.  Most parents can tell
just such a story.  I remember being on a payphone when my son was
three.  I was watching him, I looked away to dial, and then he was gone.
Luckily, my utter devastation lasted for just a few, unbearably long
seconds, as he had just scooted a few feet away so that a corner hid his
body.  He was never aware that he was missing, but my heart almost
stopped.
In THE DEEP END OF THE OCEAN, based on Jacquelyn Mitchard's best selling
novel, Beth Cappadora has to confront her worst nightmare, and it lasts
for years.  Arriving in a busy hotel without her husband and with her
three young kids in tow, she briefly leaves the middle child, Ben, a
mischievous and fearless 3-year-old in the care of Vincent, his
7-year-old brother, while she checks in.  Ben disappears, lost into the
crowd.  It's natural to be upset with both Vincent and Beth, but one is
too young to have been given such responsibility and the other makes a
momentary bad judgement, as we all do.
Although the press kit says that the cast was administered an
"anti-sentimental" pill every day, the story will reduce you to tears.
Is there any material more ripe to elicit strong emotions than that of a
lost child?  As directed by Ulu Grosbard and adapted for the screen by
Stephen Schiff, the movie is at its best and most convincing in the
tear-jerking first act.
Two characters play Rock of Gibraltar roles.  Treat Williams, as Beth's
husband Pat, is so unflappable that he will likely begin to grate on
your nerves.  Only a fight with Beth will elicit the anger that smolders
within him.  "Kids don't get lost," he yells at her in a telling scene
later in the story.  "People lose them."
The other rock in the story is Detective Candy Bliss (Whoopi Goldberg),
who will attempt not only to locate Ben, but also to help Beth get
through her unbearable ordeal.  "First thing I want to tell you -- this
isn't anybody's fault," which is exactly what Beth will never believe.
"Kids disappear all the time.  We find them," which is the closest thing
to a lie that the detective says.
The strength of the movie comes from the impressive power of Michelle
Pfeiffer's performance.  She displays a highly nuanced range of emotions
from depression, despondence and guilt to denial, withdrawal, and anger.
If she doesn't fill your tear ducts at some point in the film, see your
doctor and have them checked.
The last half of the movie is set 9 years later, when, as the trailers
reveal, Ben accidentally finds them.  This half isn't nearly as well
developed as the consistent and logical first half.
The cast, other than Pfeiffer and Goldberg, is hit and miss, and the
direction works only sporadically.  One minute the movie is completely
engrossing, and the next the characters are inconsistent and out of
character with Vincent, played by Jonathan Jackson, being the worst.
When his brother is located, for example, he doesn't show one iota of
interest, something that is very hard to buy, even given his repressed
guilt.
The screenwriter, having painted himself into a cinematic corner, leaves
himself several ending options, but none of them are satisfactory.
Reportedly, Pfeiffer wanted a different ending, which they filmed but
decided not to use.
The whole last act slowly grinds to a halt almost destroying the
emotional investment we made in the beginning.  The result is a moving
motion picture, but one that leave viewers conflicted.  Parts work so
well and others just are not set up properly.  And then there is that
ending, which isn't bad but isn't particularly satisfactory either.
THE DEEP END OF THE OCEAN runs 1:45.  It is rated PG-13 for some
profanity and mature themes and would be fine for teenagers.

   They say that blood is thicker than water and that biology
is destiny.  This means that no matter what friends you make
and what business acquaintances you bond with, you can
ultimately trust only your own family.
   They also say that no one should profit from the outcomes
of a criminal act.  If you innocently buy a Rolex watch which
is later found to have been stolen by the seller, you are
required to return the watch to its rightful owner.
   These homilies underscore Ulu Grosbard's "The Deep End
of the Ocean," adapted by Stephen Schiff from the best-
selling novel by Jacquelyn Mitchard.  The story centers on a
boy not quite three years of age who suddenly disappears
from a hotel lobby when his mother briefly turns her back. 
When he is found nine years later remembering nothing
about his true parents, he is taken from his adoptive father's
home and placed back with his real mom and dad.  If blood is
thicker than water, he should quickly acclimate to the new
surroundings, content to be with his natural parents.  The
judicial system also considers that a boy who is kidnapped by
a woman, later adopted by a man who is innocent of the
crime. must return him in the same manner that we he would
have to give up a stolen Rolex that he may have blamelessly
purchased.
   Though the seventy-year-old Ulu Grosbard has worked only
sporadically in the film industry, he appears a wise choice to
direct a movie of this genre.  Thirty years ago he helmed a
film adaptation of Frank Gilroy's play "The Subject Was
Roses," about a young veteran's strained relationship with his
parents, though three years later he proved inept in dealing
with comedy when he directed Dustin Hoffman in "Who is
Harry Kellerman and Why is He Saying Those Terrible Things
About Me?"  "The Deep End of the Ocean," like "Roses," is
about strained relationships between a twelve-year-old kid,
Ben, and his parents; between Ben and his older brother
Vincent; and between Ben's adoptive father and the boy's
natural parents.  Anguish, tensions, and hostilities fill the
screen, leaving little time even for Whoopi Goldberg's comic
touches in a melodrama that goes clear over the border into
the realm of TV soap opera.
   The title of the film comes from a quote in Jacqueline
Mitchard's 1996 book, a novel which proves only that the
public's taste for conventional, tear-jerking family stories is
insatiable.  "Are we at the deep end, Mom?" wonders little
Ben, to which the mother replies, "This is the ocean, Ben. 
There is no deep end of the ocean."  "It looks too deep,"
counters the kid.  "Don't be afraid," Mom reassures him. 
"Mama would never let the ocean snatch you away."
   Despite this promise made by Beth (Michelle Pfeiffer) to
her child, Ben (Michael McElroy), she leaves the boy briefly
in the care of his seven-year-old brother, Vincent (Cory Buck)
as she straightens out hotel reservations at a high-school
reunion in Chicago.  The kid vanishes.  Though half the
Chicago police force search frantically for the lad, he does
not turn up--for nine years.  When the 12-year-old Ben (Ryan
Merriman) does turn up in a coincidence far too improbable
to believe, he is ordered to return to his natural folks against
his will.  Given a similar situation, wouldn't you rebel against
leaving a man who has loved and sheltered you for nine
years only to be put into a strange home of people you do
not remember and with whom you spent only one-third of that
time?  The question that pervades the film is: Will the kid do the
right thing and return to the man who has shown him kindness and
affection for nine years?  Or will he follow his genes back to his
"natural" home?
   The dialogue is filled with fatuous daytime-TV dialogue. 
Pat Cappadora (Treat Williams), the boy's father, appeals to
his distraught wife Beth (Michelle Pfeiffer), "All I want is for us
to be a family again."  In another situation, Beth's friend
declares, "I would never do a thing to hurt you."  Ben's
adoptive father George (John Kapelos) looks with pity on his
boy's sorrowful appearance and angrily informs his real
parents, "He's never had a sad day in his life....today he's the
saddest boy in the world." Even the attempts at comedy by
Whoopi Goldberg as police detective Candy Bliss are feeble. 
When Beth tries to hug the sympathetic detective, she pulls
back reflexively, excusing herself by stating that she's gay,
she's black, and "the eyes of Texas are on me."  
   Michelle Pfeiffer does what she can with a banal script to
evoke sympathy from the movie audience while Treat
Williams is underutilized as the demanding father.  The best
performances are from young Ryan Merriman as the
bewildered but highly intelligent and articulate Ben, who is as
good at throwing baskets on the family court as he is in
expressing his feelings without even a single use of words
such as "like," "you know what I'm saying," and "totally." 
Jonathan Jackson is fine as the typical teenager who has to
deal with the sibling envy that led him to lose his brother nine
years back and which even now compels him to persuade the
boy to run away from home.
   Though the film is superior to the hopelessly cloying
"Message in a Bottle," "The Deep End of the Ocean" drowns
in its own mawkishness after feeble attempts now and then to
come up for air.

The Deep End of the Ocean is the type of tragic drama that is most often
seen as a TV movie-of-the-week.  Based on Jacquelyn Mitchard's novel, it
paints a stark, depressing picture, and adds a glimmer of hope
intermingled with a tough moral decision.  The result is choppy at
times, moving at others, yet never offers anything mandating a trip to
the theater.
In 1988, Beth and Pat (Michelle Pfieffer and Treat Williams) had a
seemingly "perfect" life.  However, that life crumbles down around them
in an instant.  In a crowded hotel lobby, Beth loses track of her three
year old son, Ben...and he is gone.
In the nine years which follow, their entire family must learn to cope
with the grief.  Beth is the most obviously pain-stricken, but her older
son, Vincent (played by Cory Buck and Jonathan Jackson) is extremely
hard hit, retreating into a shell of rebelliousness.
And then, a miracle occurs...or does it?  Beth notices that a neighbor
boy, Sam Karras (Ryan Merriman), looks an awful lot like her missing
son.  But his single father, George (John Kapelos), doesn't seem to be a
kidnapper.  Is she mistaken about one, or both, of them?  If she is
right, what should be done?
The pacing of The Deep End of the Ocean feels obviously condensed. Each
scene is connected, but rarely seems to flow with the ones fore and
aft.  The experience is not unlike reading every other chapter in a
book.  The gist of the story is there, but so is a feeling that
something is missing.
The film paints its way straight into a corner.  The moral morass
demands that, whatever the outcome, it won't be a happy one.  And yet,
impossibly, and implausibly, the film tidies things up too neatly.
The performances are good throughout, although Whoopi Goldberg seems to
be misused as a police investigator.  The strongest performance in the
film comes from John Kapelos, as Sam's father. In a few simple scenes,
he is able to create a character both sympathetic and memorable.
The Deep End of the Ocean does have its emotional moments. What film
about losing a child would be complete without them? But, you expect a
little bit more from a film at the cinema. Truth be told, The Deep End
of the Ocean is not much different from the run-of-the-mill crisis-bound
tearjerker that you'll find every week  on television.  This one will
wait for video.

Director Ulu Grosbard has only made seven movies in the last thirty one
years and one of them is 'The Deep End of the Ocean'.  Grosbard's career
began in 1968 with 'The Subject Was Roses' when he directed Jack
Albertson to an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.  The first film I saw
in a theatre directed by him was 'True Confessions' in 1981.  His other
four films are 'Who Is Harry Kellerman and Why Is He Saying Those
Terrible Things About Me?' (1971), 'Straight Time' (1978), 'Falling in
Love' (1984), and 'Georgia' (1995).  Grosbard's style is very leisurely
and his films have a tendency to look like television projects so why is
'The Deep End of the Ocean' such a wonderful film?  Because in many
ways, it breaks your way of thinking when it comes to having children.
Some people really want children but find the idea of raising them to be
a scary thought.  Others have no problem with it while others live
through the nightmare of losing them and not knowing for sure what
happened to them.  This is what happens to an average American family in
a movie that has no high or low points that stand out above the rest of
its running time and while the performances are solid, the story is
cleverly told mainly from the perspective of only one parent.
The film begins in Madison, Wisconsin in 1988.  Beth (Michelle Pfeiffer)
and her husband Pat (Treat Williams) are an average couple whose three
children range in approximate age from six months to three and seven.
Pat leaves for a business meeting in Chicago while Beth is to attend her
high school reunion.  While she's there, her three year old becomes
separated from her and no one can find him.  The usual panic sets in
complete with the trauma that will be experienced by any mother with
feelings in such a predicament.  Beth even becomes hysterical at one
point and has to be restrained and sedated by paramedics.  The story
then jumps ahead nine years and as her children have grown older, so has
Beth's memory.  She thinks about her son missing son Ben everyday and
looks very unhappy with life and her husband tells her she's made a
career out of looking unhappy.  Beth's feelings have interfered with her
marriage and her eldest son Vincent (Jonathan Jackson) has become
something of a teenage delinquent who likes mischief with cars.  One
day, Beth's daughter Kerry (Alexa Vega) talks to a boy at the front door
whom she knows that wants to know if the lawn needs mowing and Beth
comes to the door and instantly recognizes him as an older version of
her missing son.  Through a re-opened police investigation led by
Officer Bliss (Whoopi Goldberg), the boy turns out to be Ben (Ryan
Merriman) who goes by the name Sam and he is re-united with his
biological family but doesn't remember who they are.  The adjustment is
not easy and this is the central point of the film and how things become
resolved.
On the surface, you have to give this film credit for its original
subject matter.  An idea that is excellent in its conception and pretty
well executed.  It's written by Stephen Schiff based on the best selling
novel by Jacquelyn Mitchard.  I had a problem with the odds in which the
boy is re-united with his family.  Could they be in the millions?
Billions?  Certainly a stretch in credibility damages the film's
character and this is the key to enjoying the film as to whether or not
you can overlook this flaw.  Another factor that seemed out of place was
the re-action Ben's siblings have to the news of his return.  Not as
delighted as the parents are and their lives just go on as if very
little has changed.  Perhaps it's just in their nature and I suppose
this argument is borderline in making a case for the movie but I
genuinely felt moved by the story and the film is perfect for the
average movie goer who doesn't see a lot of movies and it doesn't insult
your intelligence the way many films released this time of year do.
I enjoyed the performance of Treat Williams in this film.  Mainly an
under rated actor, he is diverse in his roles and I enjoyed him since I
first saw his work as a corrupt cop in 1981's 'Prince of the City'.
Although 'The Deep End of the Ocean' is told mainly from Pfeiffer's
point of view as the parent responsible for her son's disappearance,
Williams plays a good supporting role and the husband and wife team
these actors play, they manage to distinguish themselves from each other
and that is the film's most impressive offering.  As the film looks for
resolution in the final twenty minutes, it reminds us that the most
wonderful thing in the world can indeed be to have children and one of
the worst things can be losing them.  'The Deep End of the Ocean' is a
film that will make you want to hug your kids just a wee bit longer the
next time you prepare them and send them off for the day to school.

Jonathan Richards, THE SANTA FE REPORTER
     The good news is that Ulu Grosbard's adaptation of Jaquelyn 
Mitchard's kidnapping bestseller steers scrupulously clear of the tear-
jerking excesses you might expect. The bad news is it seldom engages your 
emotions.  It's got moments of tremendous tension, and it provides a lot 
to think about.  But it never pierces the place where we feel.  
     The story, for those who have ignored Oprah's exhortation to read 
the book, is about Beth Cappadora (Michelle Pfeiffer), whose 3-year-old 
son Ben disappears from a crowded Chicago hotel lobby while she is 
registering for a high school reunion (it was a very good-looking class.) 
 She's wracked with guilt, and shuts herself off emotionally from the 
rest of her family -- 7-year-old Vincent (Cory Buck), baby Kerry, and 
husband Pat (Treat Williams).  
     And then nine years later, when the family, still miraculously 
together, has moved to Chicago, a neighbor boy named Sam (Ryan Merriman) 
shows up at the door to mow the lawn.  Beth takes one look at him and 
knows: it's Ben.  
     But we're only halfway through the movie, which extends way beyond 
the normal kidnapping story and explores the complexities of what's right 
and what's wrong for all involved when nobody still alive is to blame.  
Like Natalie Wood in John Ford's "The Searchers", the boy has forgotten 
his first family and loves the one he's grown up in.  When he does return,
 he doesn't know them and they don't know him.  "We've missed a lot of 
years," says Pat.
     Grosbard digs around in a cold fire of family and social issues, 
prodding sparks out of the embers.  He keeps us busy with things to 
consider, such as the role of the press, which the family uses to 
publicize and plead when the boy goes missing, and then shuts out when it 
swoops down on them in a feeding frenzy of intrusive questions.  We're 
asked to think about such things as how much grief and guilt is allowed 
and how much becomes excessive when you lose a child.  "You may think 
you're a rotten mother," the detective 
(Whoopi Goldberg) tells Beth, urging her back to her other two kids, "but 
you're the only one they've got."
     But they don't get enough of her, and neither does her husband; a 
big piece has gone with Ben, and though she pastes on smiles and goes on 
living, she's a long way from whole.  
     There's some excellent acting, led by the tightly-wound and wounded 
Pfeiffer, whose early radiance vanishes under her burden of guilt.  
Vincent (as a teenager played with compelling sullenness by General 
Hospital's Jonathan Jackson) has his load of guilt too -- he let go of 
his brother's hand when he was minding him.  And Pat labors under the 
guilt of blaming Beth, though he tries to conceal it.  They're a poster 
family for dysfunctionality.  The trouble is, they're so unable to 
communicate that they fail to communicate with us as 
well.  
     Grosbard doesn't pander to his audience, but he seems to be trying 
so hard not to that he skips along the surface of this story, hurrying 
from this scene to that, telling us with edgy coolness what's at issue 
and what's at stake, but never bringing us in to share it.

Michelle Pfeiffer stars as Beth Cappadora, mother of three, wed to husband Pat
(Treat Williams).  When she loses her three year old son, Ben (Michael McElroy)
at a busy Chicago motel, Candy Bliss (Whoopi Goldberg) steps in on the
investigation, and the search to find Ben.  What results from an unrealistic
setup (How many mothers would leave their children in a busy lobby, all alone?)
is a touching drama that has its obvious problems, but are watered down by a
few choice, touching family scenes.  After a long, nine year period, Beth
believes that she has found her son, who now goes by the name of Sam (Ryan
Merriman), and lives just blocks away.  Michelle Pfeiffer gives a strong
performance as her three dimensional character, as we see the effects of losing
a son, and the awful hardships this brings to a family, even nine years after
they occur.  Stephen Schiff's screenplay, based on the best selling novel, is
the major weak spot in The Deep End of the Ocean, as many scenes and lines seem
out of place- "Your legs are longer," comes to mind.  The film doesn't seem
complete, as it is losing a final touch.  The editing is particularly choppy,
and the film is uneven.  The Deep End of the Ocean's flaws are somewhat covered
up by the strong cast, some very touching scenes, but all in all, I was hoping
for more.  
The Bottom Line- The Deep End of the Ocean makes for a fun, yet rather
frustrating film to watch, and is definitely worth the price for a video
rental.
