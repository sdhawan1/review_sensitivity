**1/2 out of **** (not up to standards, but has it's moments).
Cast: Leslie Nielsen (Count Dracula), Mel Brooks (Dr. Abarham
Van Helsing), Peter MacNichol (Renfield), Steven Weber (Jonathan
Harker), Harvey Korman (Dr. Arthur Seward), Amy Yasbeck (Mina),
Lysette Anthony (Lucy), Megan Cavanaugh (Chambermaid), Mark
Blankfield (Martin), Ezio Greggio (Coach Driver), Anne
Bancroft (Madam Ouspenskaya).
Crew: Directed by Mel Brooks, Screenplay by Mel Brooks,
Steve Haberman, and Rudy De Luca, from an original
script by Haberman and DeLuca. Produced by Mel Brooks,
Peter Schindler & Robert Latham Brown & Leah Zappy.
Cinematography by Michael D. O'Shea.
What do you get when you team two of the funniest men in
comedy, Mel Brooks and Leslie Nielsen, and have Nielsen
do a takeoff on every classic Dracula film ever made,
with Nielsen parodying Bela Lugosi's Dracula?
A surefire winner like Young Frankenstein? 
Nielsen plays the Count, who is visited by lawyer Renfield
(MacNichol who, despite being amusing, is a poor substitute 
for Marty Feldman, who so obviously would've played this role, 
and done better with it, if he were still alive today) about 
leasing Carfax Abby, the house in England the Count wants
to buy. He takes him on as a slave, and they meet
Jonathan Harker (Weber), his wife Mina, who Dracula
bites, Dr. Seward (an amusing Harvey Korman),
and Lucy (Anthony) whom he kills. When Seward
has his nasty suspicions, he calls upon the
vampire expert, Dr. Van Helsing (Brooks. He's
funny, but nowhere near as funny as someone like
Gene Wilder could've been as Van Helsing)
to confront the Count.
This isn't the best film Mel Brooks has made, not even
close. This isn't up to the "loving tribute" style
his other monster parody, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, was--even
though it tries hard to be--and there's a reason for that.
He worked with Gene Wilder on YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN,
and he needed to work with him here too, to make
the film work. If he and Gene Wilder had
collaborated on the script, it might just've worked,
as they work well together. Maybe then, this
would've been in black and white like it should've been.
I also think the cast was wrong. Leslie Nielsen
is one of those comedic actors who's always
funny. Here is no exception, and he does an
excellent Lugosi impression, you can keep him.
Brooks did not act in YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN,
which was a wise idea, and he should've done that here
and given the role of Van Helsing to Gene Wilder,
whom I miss seeing on the screen, and also miss
seeing with Brooks. Comedian Mark Blankfield, who works 
for Brooks now, would've been better suited to be Renfield
instead of guard Martin, and I could see Kenneth
Mars of YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN playing Dr. Seward.
Weber is ideal as Harker as is Yasbeck as
Mina. Only then would this film have been
perfect.
I'd tell you to stick to LOVE AT FIRST BITE, which was
very funny, but I prefer parodies that do not trample
on tradition, which this tries not to do and gets
a passing grade for effort on, and that film does not.

     After the vastly disappointing ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS, Mel Brooks
really needed to prove himself by getting back to his YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN
and BLAZING SADDLES-type comedy.  The Dracula legend seemed like the
perfect way to do it.  But sadly, Brooks manages to hack it up like he did
to poor Robin Hood, thanks to some very stale jokes and overly repetitious
gags.
     Brooks basically takes BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA (Francis Ford Coppola's
film) and gives it the once-over, recreating the plot and characters
almost directly from that movie, and giving them supposedly funny lines. 
The problem is that BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA was pretty silly to begin with,
and Brooks' version comes off as poking fun at a film that was already
doing a good job of it all by itself.
     There are thankfully a few good lines in the film (my favorite:  Van
Helsing: "She's Nosferatu!"   Renfield: "She's Italian?"), but overall,
the movie sinks.  Casting Leslie Nielsen as Dracula was a good move, as
his antics are always good for a chuckle or two, but the continual
overexposure of people like Amy Yasbeck (as Mina) in films like this
leaves nothing new for the viewer to expect.  And while Lysette Anthony's
sultry Lucy is fun to watch...they kill her after 45 minutes.
     Most of the movie's gags involve tripping, falling down, running into
a wall or a window, or some other slapstick device.  But the most tedious
of the jokes is the nearly constant mocking of accents and overdramatic
speech the various characters use.  This gets old after the second scene,
where the stereotypical trill in a gypsy's voice is made by the manual
quivering of the skin around her throat.  Ha ha.
     Brooks fans won't be pleased, and neither will the vampire
aficionado.  Stay away from this film, and let it bury itself. 
Figuratively speaking, that is.

     Any excursion into the mind of Mel Brooks is an occasion for cele-
bration, even when it's a surprisingly slim spoof of Dracula films, old
and new.  Slight, and more than a little bit flat, DRACULA: DEAD AND
LOVING IT is at least an improvement over his last film, ROBIN HOOD:
MEN IN TIGHTS.  The laugh count is still awfully low--there hasn't
been a *funny* Mel Brooks movie since, oh, his 1983 remake of TO BE OR
NOT TO BE--but there are a *few* funny moments.  And at least one
classic scene involving a large quantity of blood.
     Casting is part of the problem.  In better days, Brooks had his
pick from the likes of Madeline Kahn, Gene Wilder, Dom DeLuise, and
Cloris Leachmen.  Here, with the exception of Harvey Korman and a few
fleeting old faces, he's working with featherweights.  Such as Steven
Weber (JEFFREY) and Amy Yasbeck (PROBLEM CHILD).  (To be fair, Peter
MacNicol is dead-on funny as the insect-loving Renfield.  He has a
great scene with Korman at a breakfast table.)
     Oddly, the role of Dracula seems miscast.  Leslie Nielsen is a
great bumbler, but far less effective as a suave Transylvanian.  (His
inclusion, I suspect, was more market-driven than anything else.  He's
amusing enough, but would people really have paid to see, say, Frank
Langella spoofing himself?)  Brooks, who appears as the vampire-hunting
Van Helsing, plays things straight; perhaps too straight.  Nobody
breaks into song; nobody appears dressed as a Nazi.
     However good-natured the humor is, DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT is
still flat on all fronts.  This movie is neither scary-funny enough;
nor quick-witted enough; nor authentic-looking enough to be effective.
(If anything begs for some serious spoofing it's those great visual
effects in BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA; effects that Brooks never takes a
hearty stab at.  Too bad.)  The old Mel Brooks shows his face in a few
scenes--an autopsy here, a gynecology line there--but, for the most
part, the man who made YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is still down for the count.

Cast: Leslie Nielsen, Mel Brooks, Peter MacNicol, Steven Weber, 
      Amy Yasbeck, Lysette Anthony, Harvey Korman
Director: Mel Brooks
Producer: Mel Brooks
Screenplay: Mel Brooks, Rudy De Luca, and Steve Haberman
Cinematography: Michael D. O'Shea
Music: Hummie Mann
U.S. Distributor: Columbia Pictures
     When it comes to spoofs of horror films, one of the greatest of all 
time is surely Mel Brooks' YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, a movie that's as clever 
as it is funny.  Now, more than two decades later, Brooks has attempted 
to re-create the magic by doing to Bram Stoker's vampire legend what he 
did in 1974 to Mary Shelly's gothic tale.  Alas, DRACULA: DEAD AND 
LOVING IT doesn't come close to the level attained by YOUNG 
FRANKENSTEIN.  It's a toothless parody that misses more often than it 
hits.
     Maybe one of the problems is that there have been so many attempts 
to lampoon vampires.  A few, like George Hamilton's LOVE AT FIRST BITE, 
have been genuinely funny.  However, most, like BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER 
and VAMPIRE IN BROOKLYN, have failed.  With DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT, 
Brooks is far from virgin territory.  Some of his jokes here have been 
used before, and, even for the good ones, familiarity mutes laughter.
     Ultimately, however, DRACULA is infected with the same disease that 
has plagued the last several Brooks films -- it's just not all that 
funny.  Sure, there are humorous bits here and there throughout the 
running length, but not enough to justify an entire movie.  DRACULA: 
DEAD AND LOVING IT sputters as badly (or worse) than ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN 
TIGHTS, LIFE STINKS, and SPACEBALLS, to name a few.  Whatever 
inspiration stirred Brooks to make YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN has long since 
deserted him.  
     The storyline of DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT is an amalgamation of 
all the various screen incarnations of Stoker's tale.  English 
businessman Renfield (Peter MacNicol) travels to Transylvania to meet 
with the mysterious Count Dracula (Leslie Nielsen).  While staying at 
the count's castle, Renfield falls under Dracula's spell.  Together, the 
two travel to England, where Dracula begins his reign of terror by 
draining the blood of two lovely women:  Lucy (Lysette Anthony) and Mina 
(Amy Yasbeck).  When Lucy's health fails, her guardian, Dr. Seward 
(Harvey Korman), and his assistant, Jonathan Harker (Steven Weber), call 
in the strange-but-brilliant Professor Van Helsing (Mel Brooks) to 
unmask the fiend.
     Given the comic turn his career has taken since the early '80s, 
it's hard to believe that Leslie Nielsen was once a serious actor.  
These days, thanks to the Zucker brothers (AIRPLANE, THE NAKED GUN), he 
has become an accomplished satirical performer.  His sense of timing is 
impeccable, and this asset has made him a sought-after commodity for a 
wide variety of spoofs.  Here, Nielsen takes on the title role, but his 
presence can't resurrect this stillborn lampoon.
     Unless you're a die hard Mel Brooks fan (are there any of them 
left?), there's no compelling reason to sit through DRACULA: DEAD AND 
LOVING IT.  The sporadic humor promises some laughs, but the ninety 
minutes will go by slowly.  The general failure of this movie leads to 
one obvious question:  why couldn't Brooks just leave Dracula dead and 
buried?

     It is faint praise, but DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT is the best
Mel Brooks comedy in quite a long while.  And for once he made a film
that without the humor might have been above average.  But some of the
nice visuals are just wasted here and the film remains only a very
mediocre effort with humor that is just too weak and mechanical to
carry the film.  The enema jokes and other unfunny run-on gags spoil
the few funny bits in this satire of three different film adaptations
of DRACULA.
     At one time Mel Brooks was a really good filmmaker with genuine
characters and a great sense of humor.  Consider the skill with which
he balanced personality with humor in THE PRODUCERS or the too-rarely-
seen TWELVE CHAIRS.  We have not seen much of that Mel Brooks in quite
a while.  Brooks's humor these days leans to cheap and easy gags,
scatological or just lame far too often.  And the weak humor sabotages
not only his own production values, but his better gags as well.
DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT is no YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, but it has a nice
visual sense and many of its jokes really are funny.  But Brooks needs
to get a better idea of which gags work and which fall flat.  In the
end this new film has too many jokes to work as a horror film and too
high a percentage of lame jokes for it to work as a comedy.
     DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT is basically a reworking of the 1931
screen version, itself a reworking of the John L. Balderston and
Hamilton Deane play.  That play, is a perennial favorite on the stage
and formed the basis of the 1931 Bela Lugosi and the 1979 Frank
Langella versions of DRACULA.  The Brooks film then recreates and
satirizes scenes from the Lugosi, the 1958 Christopher Lee DRACULA
(U.S. title: THE HORROR OF DRACULA), and the 1992 Gary Oldman BRAM
STOKER'S DRACULA.  There is even a quick nod to the 1921 NOSFERATU.
There is a nice recreation of the stairway and web sequence from the
1931 version and a beautiful recreation of the staking of Lucy from the
1958 version, even matching the odd color values.  It is in these two
scenes that the film has its best moments.  There are times when the
photography has an exaggerated dreamlike quality that really does work.
And the opening which takes us through famous graphic portrayals of
vampires is done with a great deal of style.  Unfortunately, these good
moments get lost in the film.
     By far not the smallest fault in the film is the transparent
casting of Leslie Nielson as Dracula.  Nielson's forte is playing
characters who are overly obvious like big children, while a quality of
mystery and otherworldlyness is necessary to play the famous vampire,
even in a comedy.  He is cast against type, and he plays against type.
If that was a gamble, it fails miserably, but more likely he is in the
film because of his associations with other films.  Harvey Korman as
Dr. Seward has more than a little Nigel Bruce in his performance.
     Brooks's writing has turned formulaic and that is slow death in
comedy.  He fills time in the film with pointless run-on gags that do
not seem to get any funnier with the repetition.  One of the run-on
gags only reaches its real point at the end of the credit sequence when
it plays mostly to empty seats--another example of where Brooks
misjudges his audience.  Too many of his jokes just end up a reference
to urine or feces as if that by itself is funny.  Also overused are
pratfalls.
     It is a sad state when all the best aspects of a Mel Brooks comedy
have little to do with the humor.  Brooks should take a look at what
made some of his early films so good and refresh his memory on the
difference between humor and gags.  The style of the film, perhaps
contributed by a good cinematographer, brings this one up to a high 0
on the -4 to +4 scale.

Mel Brooks has done a lot of films- this one being the most recent.  Sometimes 
they are great and sometimes they flop big time.  The main problem with 
DRACULA: DEAD & LOVING IT is that it relies on the fact that the viwer has 
knowledge of DRACULA from the film with Bela Lugosi, the 1990 remake with Gary 
Oldman, the novel itself, as well as a decent vampire lore knowledge to get a 
majority of the jokes.  I fit into this category, but those who don't would 
think the film is lame.
The plot follows the Bela Lugosi version exactly which was actually based on a 
play and is not that similar to the original book by Bram Stoker.  It begins 
with Renfield going to Count Dracula's castle to have him sign a deal to get 
land in London.  Peter MacNicol (the mad painter in GHOSTBUSTERS 2 and the 
American guy in BEAN) does a great job as Renfield.  At the start he is 
mediocre, but when he becomes insane the best performance of the movie comes 
out.  Renfield is perfect while having the little quirks that make a memorable 
character.
As for the other characters...  Mel Brooks does a good job as Van Helsing.  
Leslie Neilsen was a little miscast for the title role of Dracula since 
everyone is used to seeing him in the NAKED GUN movies.  He does an OK job, 
but is he a convincing vampire?  No, but he isn't trying to be either.  Amy 
Yasbeck, last seen in Mel Brooks' film ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS as Maid 
Marion, is fine for the role of Mina.  So the cast works fine with eachother 
and the script has some good lines.
Some of the lines, like I said before, require knowledge of prior Dracula 
films.  This line for example:
(A bat flies down and poops on the stairs)
Dracula: Creatures of the night...  What a mess they make...
See what I mean? It doesn't really work as a visual gag, yet the line itself 
is a pun on the line "Creatures of the night...  What music they make" done by 
Bela Lugosi in the original Dracula film.  The humor hits and misses.  The 
best scene involves when Van Helsing and Harker (played by some guy on the 
show WINGS) go to execute Lucy in her Nosferatu form.  I saw this film first 
in a theatre and rather liked it, yet the audience laughs were far and few 
between.  Renfield is great, as is the decent instrumental music score, but 
the film doesn't work because of the way the humor is done...  Mel Brooks 
hasn't made a horrid film, he just has done much better.
Overall, I give Dracula: Dead and Loving it **1/2 out of ****.  If you are a 
fan of vampire films or a fan of Mel Brooks film, go and rent it.  Others 
should rent some of the funnier Brooks films like SPACEBALLS, BLAZING SADDLES, 
YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, THE PRODUCERS, and ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS.
This film IS better than MEL BROOKS' HISTORY OF THE WORLD: PART I.

     It appears that Mel Brooks ought to retire from his long and
successful career as both actor and director.  His last films, LIFE
STINKS and DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT are sooo bad, it's pitiful.  I
would like to remember him for the great laughs he gave us over a long
career rather than for the ridiculous one note films he has been
turning out these past few years.  Mel, quit while you are still
ahead.
     In LIFE STINKS the whole story revolved around a very wealthy man
who gave up his all for one month to prove he could survive in the
sordid world.  In DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT, Dracula is a bumbling
idiot whose every scheme fails miserably.
     Satire is the most difficult form of comedy to write and
perform.  It's either brilliant or falls flat on its face.  This one
is not in the brilliant class despite heroic "shtick" by Leslie Nelson
as Dracula and Amy Yasbeck as the undersexed woman he tries to seduce.
Another "vampirette" is Lysette Anthony.
     Peter MacNicol is a groveling slave (remember Mel kissing the
boots of his lord and master in the wonderful 12 CHAIRS?) and Mel
himself plays a "vampireologist."   With the exception of 2 gags that
ARE funny, the remainder is an awful bore.  Mel: quit.
