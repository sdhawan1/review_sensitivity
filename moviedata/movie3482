Adam Sandler's latest flick has him playing the son of the devil. Must.... 
resist.... obvious.... one-liner. 
But seriously folks I'm starting to think Mr. Sandler must be the most 
powerful person in Hollywood because every celebrity on the planet is willing 
to appear in his movies no matter how bad they are. Technically, "Little 
Nicky" should be his worst movie to date because it is so unabashedly 
commercial and outrageous, but it's not. 
Sandler's style of comedy is directly responsible for a lot of the humor we 
see on TV and in the movies today. It's the "lowest common dominator" 
philosophy multiplied by stupidity. He's crude and lowbrow but he's also 
using ideas most others aren't. He'll do pretty much anything for a laugh and 
he never expects you to take him seriously. That worked back in his debut 
starring vehicle "Billy Madison" and it still works here. 
As I mentioned before, Sandler plays the son of the devil, Nicky. Actually, 
he's just one of the devil's three sons and he's the "good" one. A goofy guy 
with a speech impediment and a wacky face who doesn't really comprehend what 
it means to be part of the evilest family in existence. Harvey Keitel plays 
Satan who's trying to decide which of his sons will succeed him. But since 
he's the devil he of course chooses himself which irks the two really nasty 
sons Adrian and Cassius who flee Hell to set up camp on Earth. That screws up 
everything, the devil begins to "die" and Nicky is the only one capable of 
capturing his two mean brothers and making sure Hell stays where it belongs. 
The plots to Sandler's movies aren't exactly the most intellectually 
stimulating are they? His prior box office blockbusters have kept the story 
"realistic" for the most part, but this is his first foray into something 
more supernatural and more of a fantasy. When you're making a movie about a 
regular human guy you're kind of limited as to who the supporting characters 
and story situations can be. When you're making a movie about the idiot son 
of the devil whose friends include a talking foul-mouthed bulldog, an 
ambiguously gay actor, two stoned-out headbangers, and a homely designer 
student - you can go a bit hog wild. 
A lot of the film talks place in Hell and there's minor characters running 
all over the place, such as Rodney Dangerfield as the original Lucifer, a 
gatekeeper with breasts on his head and lots of demons and other monsters. 
Sandler's brand of comedy has been pretty lowbrow before, but since Satan 
himself is actually a major player in this story, the cruel, mean comedy is a 
bit more justified. Not that I condone the scenes of sodomizing Hitler with a 
pineapple, but the stuff that happens up above on Earth where Nicky must 
track down and battle his brothers is funny. 
Take for example a scene in which Cassius has possessed the referee at a 
Harlem Globetrotters game. When he makes the players bash their heads on the 
table, and throws everyone out Nicky steps in and the two battle each other 
with their "magic powers." The audience just thinks it's part of the show 
even though the things they do are totally impossible. Another showdown 
occurs near the end where Nicky and Adrian actually get into a pillow fight ov
er who the next leader of Hell will be. In between there's a lot of other 
stupid jokes such as Henry Winkler getting stung by a million bees and Nicky 
convincing Adrian's minions that bunnies are cute and Popeye's chicken is 
really delicious (not-so-subtle product placement has always been one of 
Sandler's most unique talents). 
"Little Nicky" doesn't have the best screenplay in the world, in fact it's 
probably one of the most contrived to come along in a few years. However, I 
must admit most of the jokes pay off. Sandler and his crew tend to repeat 
themselves with jokes about transvestites, bathroom functions, bodily fluids, 
and outrageous cartoony characters that end up getting hurt a lot. 
Technically, this stuff isn't much different from a b-movie but what makes it 
work is that it's consistent, and so over-the-top you know there's no way it 
can be taken seriously. It's almost as if you're laughing AT the movie 
instead of at the individual jokes. But as long as you enjoy yourself then 
what's the problem?

   Dogs in movies can be awfully cute but they do not often
steal the show.  When they do, the film is in trouble.  The
humor in even the funniest movie of the year so far, "Best in
Show," comes from the eccentric owners of the terriers and
hounds and other breeds and not from the four-legged
creatures who are primped and primed for the canine
competition of the year.  So when you hear that Beefy, the
talking bulldog in the latest Adam Sandler vehicle, draws the
one or two laughs that the Steven Brill's film evokes, you
know you're in for the kind of audience hell that the
filmmakers did not have in mind.
   To my mind, Sandler's only successful picture was "The
Wedding singer," because Frank Coraci's 1998 film is imbued
with Drew Barrymore's charm and has the grace to tell a
solid, heartwarming story during its 96-minute run.  By
contrast, "Little Nicky" is a patched-together quilt of Saturday
Night Live sketches featuring some embarrassing skits by
members of that TV troupe, especially by Jon Lovitz as a
peeping Tom who is blasted by a kid's sling shot while
pretending to be Big Bird and who plummets immediately
down to hell.
   While Steven Brill's concept of Hades offers a traditional,
Dante-esque view not in keeping with the Church's
contemporary interpretations, the place does seem more
interesting than the heaven which is rendered toward the
conclusion of the story.  A power struggle is in progress that
brings to mind the Gore-Bush election tussle.  Like Marcus
Aurelius in Ridley Scott's "Gladiator," Satan (Harvey Keitel)
seems about to leave his post, but after all, his is a reign
longer than those of Fidel Castro and Queen Victoria
combined. When he decides that a 10,000-year rule is merely
an internship and announces that he will stay on, his two
sons Adrian (Rhys Ifans) and Cassius (Tom Lister Jr.) decide
to overthrow him by escaping from hell into the bowels of
New York City. Talk about frying pan into fire!  But a third
son, Nicky (Adam Sandler)--like Shakespeare's Cordelia--
loves his dad and is determined to save him.  Satan is in the
throes of a progressive deterioration of body parts.  Nicky
must head to New York--his first visit to Earth-- to entice the
two wayward fellows into a bottle within a week to make
Satan's body whole once again.
   As though ingressing from another movie, Rodney
Dangerfield appears from time to time to complain that "even
in hell I get no respect."  Dana Carvey is almost
unrecognizable in the role of a possessed basketball referee
who at one point has members of the Harlem Globetrotters
banging their heads against a wall (funny, funny) and political
incorrectness holds sway when a blind preacher (Quentin
Tarantino) storms and rages down 42nd Street and a group
of wheelchair-bound athletes tear out from their basketball
game to chase Nicky--who has been framed as a mass-
murderer.  A couple of silly skits featuring Adolph
Hitler in drag trivializes National Socialism.
   The obligatory computer generation takes the form of a
powerful stream of steamy dog urine and only a single
instance of vomit.  Nicky's goodness is reflected in two
characters; Patricia Arquette in a Mia Farrow-esque role as
the object of his affection, and Reese Witherspoon as the
leader of a band of angels who all talk like Valley girls.
   A hell of a ride?  No way.  Crude and vulgar?  Fine.  But
unfunny? Inexcusable.
Rated PG-13.  Running time: 86 minutes.  (C) 2000 by

There are two kinds of people in this world: those who like Adam Sandler
movies and those who don't. I dig his humor, have enjoyed most of his films
and consider HAPPY GILMORE as my personal favorite. I don't believe him to
be the messiah of comedy or anything, but the man makes me laugh, and that's
the bottom line. What I've never seemed to understand is all of those people
who claim to hate him but still go to see his movies. Uhhhhm, what's up with
that?! If you don't like the music, change the station, right? But crappy
trailer and initially annoying voice aside, this film continues the Sandler
tradition of comedy, so if you know that going in and enjoy that type of
thing, you might as well check this one out as well. And if you don't like
Sandler, well...just stop reading this right now.
PLOT:
Satan has three sons. Two of them betray daddy dearest and take their
evilness to Earth. The third son, the shy, timid boy, must now go to Earth
and bring back his siblings before they take over their father's reign.
While in New York, the third son meets a nice girl and begins to feel a lot
more human.
CRITIQUE:
Some of the juvenile, over-the-top, stupid humor in this movie is very
funny, and some of it is not. If you have never been a fan of "Adam Sandler"
movies, don't bother seeing this one, because it certainly won't make you
change your mind about the man or his humor. I personally enjoy most of his
films and his persona, and would rate this film as one of his more ambitious
endeavors, but far from his most entertaining. Add to that the fact that
this film has obviously been written by a few guys smokin' a lot of weed,
and you've got the added bonus of many major "head trip" scenes. In fact,
there are many things in this movie that are just so over the top, that
you're either gonna laugh your head off or dismiss it all as crap on a
stick. A man who grows breasts on top of his head. Adam Sandler breaking
apart and transforming into a million little spiders with little Adam
Sandler heads on all of them. A dog shown "doggying" another dog. For me,
some of it was pretty hilarious, and some of it...so-so. Overall, the film
did entertain me enough to recommend to Sandler fans looking for a little
variety from the guy. Here he's taken his sweet, man-child character that he
plays in all of his movies, and placed him inside a preposterous plot
involving his father Satan, a talking dog and the greatest product placement
advertisement ever used in film! But unlike all of his other films, this one
focuses much more on the special effects, which is why it might have lacked
more of the big laugh-out scenes.
Another aspect of the film which others may not like as much as I did, is
the soundtrack, which was filled, and I mean filled with heavy tunes. Not
everyone's taste, I know. I also really liked all of the cameos in this
movie, and boy, were there ever a bunch! It seemed as though almost every
member of the Saturday Night Live cast from Christmas past made an
appearance somewhere in this film (including Chris Farley, who gets a nice
posthumous homage near the end of the flick), and even some characters from
previous Sandler films. Rodney Dangerfield was tops as the father of Satan,
"Even in hell, I get no respect!" For the most part, I went with all of the
over-the-top stuff, but some of it just didn't work for me. I didn't think
the Quentin Tarantino character was funny at all, and the talking dog also
didn't pie my piper. I did really like the angels in Heaven, which was a
great scene, with kudos to Reese Witherspoon for taking such a small role
and having a lot of fun with it. She played it perfectly. So overall, I
guess I'm torn here, folks. I would definitely not suggest that any
non-Sandler fans see this movie, because deep down, it's still the same ol'
Sandler humor, but I would mildly recommend it to fans of the goof.
One thing that will definitely help you appreciate some of the more
outrageous happenings in this movie is the addition of Mary and Jane to your
person. The film is just soooooo out there at times! But sober or chemically
"enlightened", this film does have enough funny to make for some good times
for most Sandler fans. By the way, am I the only one who is hungry for some
Popeye's chicken right about now?

Adam Sandler movies are easily an acquired taste--aside from almost all young 
teenage boys, who eat them up--and with every film he makes where he plays a 
normal guy whose ability to make audiences laugh comes from his charisma and 
talent, there are at least two movies that rely on him to be quirky and 
intellectually deficient, complete with a speech impediment. "Little Nicky," 
directed by Steven Brill, falls into the latter, lesser category, as his 
title character walks with a hunched-over back, has a crooked mouth, and, 
yes, a speech impediment. Sandler can be a great comic, but only with the 
right material, and when he doesn't try so hard. Here, he is afforded no help 
by the lame, forgettable screenplay that he cowrote with Tim Herlihy and 
director Brill. Is "Little Nicky" funny? Sometimes. But in the annals of the 
wildly popular Sandler flicks, this one falls into the same league as 1998's 
"The Waterboy"--better than 1995's stupefying "Billy Madison," but not as 
good as 1996's "Happy Gilmore" or 1999's "Big Daddy," and worlds below his 
one great picture, 1998's "The Wedding Singer."
Although he has a wonderful relationship with his father, the Devil (Harvey 
Keitel), Little Nicky (Adam Sandler) is a sweet, good-natured soul who 
doesn't seem to have much of the dark side in him, despite living in hell. 
With his father's 10,000-year reign to the purgatorial throne drawing to a 
close, it is up to him to choose one of his sons to succeed him. The only 
problem is, the Devil doesn't feel like his oldest boys, Adrian (Rhys Ifans) 
and Cassius (Tommy "Tiny" Lister Jr.), are mature enough to handle it, and 
Nicky is far too "heavenly." Adrian and Cassius, outraged at their father's 
decision, escape to New York City and plan to derail all laws, creating a 
Hell on Earth. 
With his body already beginning to deteriorate, the Devil sends Nicky out 
into the world above to find Cassius and Adrian and get them to drink from a 
magic-lamp-like flask that will suck and trap them in it for eternity. 
Partnered up with a wise bulldog named Mr. Beefy (voice by Robert Smigel), 
Nicky rents an apartment with an in-the-closet Broadway show fanatic (Allen 
Covert) and begins to search for his brothers. He even meets a cute fashion 
design major named Valerie (Patricia Arquette), all the while starting to 
feel strong emotions he's never felt before. 
Aside from the whole Heaven and Hell angle, "Little Nicky" is nearly a carbon 
copy, in terms of plot developments and stock characters, of all of Sandler's 
starring-role filmography. There is always a sidekick or two, with at least 
one of them gay, and there is a token love interest that he has a falling-out 
with due to a misunderstanding, but whom get back together before the end 
credits. There even is a person or two who stand in the way of the main 
character's wants and dreams. While the tried-and-true formula isn't solely 
relegated to movies with Adam Sandler, it is finally beginning to wear out 
its welcome. We've seen all of this before, and done much better and with far 
more charm ("The Wedding Singer"). Here, even the romance between Sandler and 
Patricia Arquette comes off as a slight, unfeeling subplot that isn't given 
hardly any screen time to develop.
With Sandler doing his usual schtick, there is some admitted fun in the large 
supporting players. Arquette, as the mousy Valerie, is winning, but given 
very little to do, while Harvey Keitel and Rodney Dangerfield, as the Devil 
and Lucifer, are very funny. Dangerfield, especially, gets a few zinger 
lines, including a clever placement for his getting "no respect" motto. Jon 
Lovitz, as a peeping tom who dies in the opening scene, left to be sexually 
violated by a giant black crow for all of eternity, is priceless, and his 
brief subplot in the opening is comically superior to anything else in the 
movie. Kevin Nealon, as a demon who grows a pair of buxom breasts on the top 
of his head, is eccentrically repulsive. 
Saving the best for last, the effervescently gifted and beautiful Reese 
Witherspoon shows up near the end as Sandler's loving and ageless mother, a 
heavenly angel who hangs out with her Valley Girl-style friends, and steals 
the show. Why Witherspoon agreed to be a part of such a waste of a movie is 
unknown, but for her ten minutes of screen time, she steals your heart and 
manages to tickle your funny bone in a fresh and innocent way. Aside from 
her, the film leaves you feeling oddly unclean with its repugnant premise and 
settings.
Laden with cheesy special effects galore, and not without a seemingly 
required helping of toilet humor and sexual innuendo (Adolf Hitler, for 
example, gets a pineapple showed up his backside while wearing a maid's 
uniform at four o'clock every day as his punishment). "Little Nicky" is 
marginally enjoyable, and not exactly a downright failure, but it is 
uninspired. A divergence for the eyes and little else, the movie has the 
ability to stay with you for about as long as its slim 84-minute running 
time, and then exits from your memory. Not exactly a sign of comedic 
brilliance, or a sign of being that good at all.

Nicky (Adam Sandler) is a good boy, a sweet boy. He is also the spawn of
the Devil (Harvey Keitel). Dad has been on the throne of Hell for 10,000
years, but decides not to abdicate to any of his three sons. Nicky's elder
brothers Adrian (Rhys Ifans) and Cassius (Tom "Tiny" Lister, Jr.) have
designs on dad's throne and the pair vamoose to the mortal world to upset
the delicate balance between good and evil. This upheaval would mean the
end of Satan and it's up to Nicky to go after his malevolent siblings and
bring them back to Hell to save his Daddy in "Little Nicky."
Adam Sandler is an extraordinarily likable actor and comedian who captured
the hearts of American moviegoers with his comedy/romance "The Wedding
Singer." He solidified his icon status (and a $20 million paycheck) with
the good-natured and goofy "The Water Boy," then again with the malevolent
hit, "Big Daddy." Now, the comedian takes on his biggest role every - the
Son of Satan.
On the surface, this should be a ready-made laugher that just has to
capitalize on the good-versus-evil nature of the story and the comic
presence of Sandler. Nicky has a sweet disposition even if he is the demon
seed of the Devil. He has no designs to replace his Prince of Darkness dad
and seems like the wrong one to send to earth to bring back his brothers.
Adrian and Cassius team up to corrupt the morals of man and replace Satan
in Hell. The demonic duo engineer such heinous events as lowering the
drinking age to ten and changing New York's logo to "I Love Hookers." When
they take over Hell, they want to be sure they have a lot of new clients.
As Nicky endeavors to capture his bad brothers, he falls for a good-hearted
mortal woman name Valerie (Patricia Arquette). This proves a problem as
Nicky is torn between his mission and his budding love for Valerie,
jeopardizing daddy's wellbeing. This complicates things, as Nicky has to
worry about his newly found love as well as saving his daddy.
The problem with "Little Nicky" is that it is a comedy without humor. The
screenplay, by Tim Herlihy, wastes most opportunities for laughs on routine
pratfalls and lame devil on earth jokes. Some attempt at cleverness comes
with the arrival of two goofy dudes, Pete and John (Peter Dante and
Jonathan Loughran), but these apostles are more like Led Zeppelin hangers
on than disciples of the potential anti-Christ. Another sadly executed gag
involves Curt Howard (Ron's brother) dressing in drag - there was something
funny about this in concept that is woefully humorless in execution. The
script also makes reference to Roberto Benigni's "The Monster," but fails
to capitalize on this, and to "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" and
"Frankenstein." It goes nowhere with these paths and just drops the thread
of these plot lines. Oh, yeah. The big battle for command of Hell is a
pillow fight
There is good-naturedness to Nicky that makes the character likable despite
the inane happenings around him. Sandler comes out best in a bad movie with
his self-effacing charm and niceness - you come to find out that Dad made
it with an angel (Reese Witherspoon) eons ago and Nicky was the result of
that union. The vast supporting cast around Nicky is made up of a who's who
list in Hollywood that, unfortunately, has little to do. Rodney Dangerfield
(as grandpa Lucifer), Dana Carvey, Jon Lovitz, Quentin Tarantino, Kevin
Neelon, Michael McKean, Carl Weathers, Rob Schneider, Henry Winkler, Ozzie
Osbourne and Regis Philbin, among others, make their appearances in cameo
perfs. It is a real waste of riches as no one has anything funny to do or
say.
Techs are good, but even visions of Hell can't save "Little Nicky." I give
it a D.

  Perhaps "Battlefield Earth" wasn't the worst movie of the
year! This offensive comedy raises that distinct possibility. Adam
Sandler ("Big Daddy") runs amok as the silly third son of Satan
(Harvey Keitel) who is sent to New York City in search of his two
rotten brothers (Rhys Ifans, Tommy "Tiny" Lister Jr.) who are
determined to corrupt enough souls to pull a devil of a coup. His
guide is Beefy, a talking bulldog. And a dorky design student
(Patricia Arquette) provides a whiff of romance. The gleefully
irreverent screenplay by Tim Herlihy and Sandler rides roughshod over
religion, race, politics, sexual orientation, plus drug and alcohol
abuse, offering much to offend everyone. Shortly into the film, it
becomes obvious that Popeye's Chicken has bankrolled the budget since
there's more of this fast-food product placement than I've seen in any
recent film. Except for Reese Witherspoon as a Valley-girl angel, the
cameos (Dana Carvey, Rodney Dangerfield, Jon Lovitz, Regis Philbin)
are crass and crude, particularly Quentin Tarantino's feeble attempt
at acting. When his holy man dies in a pillar of fire, it's
merciful. Sandler's so-called speech impediment, caused by a blow from
a shovel, has the annoying, irritating quality of nails scratching on
a blackboard. But director Steven Brill and lenser Theo Van De Sande's
Hieronymous Bosch-like depiction of Hell is fascinating, as is
watching Harvey Keitel tackle his first comedic role, particularly
when he disintegrates into talking lips. It takes a certain amount of
demented creativity to depict Hitler, dressed as a ballerina, being
tortured with a pineapple in a very dark, private portion of his
body. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Little Nicky" is a truly
stupid, cosmically embarrassing 1. To call it moronic is unkind to
morons.

Directed by Steven Brill. Screenplay by Tom Herlihy, Adam Sandler and
Brill. Starring Sandler, Rhys Ifans, Patricia Arquette. Running time: 94
minutes. Rated AA by the MFCB. Reviewed on November 28th, 2000.
Imagine a movie in which Adam Sandler stars as a perpetual underdog with a
speech impediment who dotes on a parent. Despite himself, he acquires a
girlfriend who's a bit of a social reject herself. He finds a purpose in
his life; it involves Sandler getting knocked down a lot. Oh, and Henry
Winkler appears.
Quick, am I describing "The Waterboy" or "Little Nicky"?
Indeed, Sandler's latest comedy effort, "Little Nicky", bears an awful lot
of similarities to his blockbuster "The Waterboy" -- it just has more
special effects and extraneous cameo appearances. The level of humour and
the appeal of the two films are virtually identical. Basically, if you
like Adam Sandler movies, you'll probably like "Little Nicky". Otherwise,
chances are you'll be better off steering clear.
In "Little Nicky", Sandler plays the title character, the third and
youngest son of Satan (Harvey Keitel). Whereas Nicky is timid and loves
his Dad, his brothers -- devious Adrian (Rhys Ifans) and powerful Cassius
(Tom 'Tiny' Lister Jr) -- want nothing more than to supplant their father
as ruler of Hell. When the Devil tells his boys that -- instead of
retiring after 10,000 years like his father before him -- he's going to
stay on for another ten-millennium term, a furious Adrian and Cassius flee
Hades for Earth, freezing the gates of Hell behind them. This prevents the
souls of sinners from entering the realm, and without them, Satan quickly
begins to physically deteriorate.
This means that it's up to Nicky to travel to Earth and convince his 
brothers to go home, before their father disintegrates completely. But
Adrian and Cassius have already begun turning our world into their own
private Hell, beginning with New York (presumably because it was the least
work). They use their demonic powers to possess major public and religious
figures, and have them promote acts of sin and degradation. Nicky teams up
with the awkward Valerie (Patricia Arquette), a talking bulldog named 
Beefy (voiced by Robert Smigel), and a motley crew of other misfits to 
save the day.
"Little Nicky" constitutes a series of wildly uneven gags; some of them
are hilarious, others fall desperately flat, and many just sit there
uncomfortably. It is Adrian's and Cassius' shenanigans which provoke the
biggest laughs -- they cause the legal drinking age to be lowered to ten
years old, for example, and make Regis Philbin talk about committing 
homicide on national television (at least, I think Regis was supposed to
have been possessed; it's been years since I saw "Live With..." so maybe 
he's always like that now). Ifans is particularly delicious as the fey,
machiavellian Adrian, camping up the screen like a latter-day Dr
Frankenfurter.
The other characters, though, are a largely unimpressive lot. Sandler
feels as though he's running in place with Nicky -- the differences
between this character and his past roles, such as Bobby Boucher in "The
Waterboy" and Robbie Hart in "The Wedding Singer", are fairly minimal,
Sandler has shown some capacity for comic range in the past, and he needs
to start demonstrating it as part of his movie career soon. Otherwise, he
risks quickly winding up in the same has-been hell as Paulie Shore and
similar would-be talents. With Nicky, he is playing a character who is
simply too soft and timid to match the caustic tone of the film. Instead
of being the center of attention like a lead actor should be, Sandler
stands on the sidelines for "Little Nicky".
Similarly, characters such as Arquette's Valerie and Nicky's roommate Todd
(Allen Covert) feel out of place and underdeveloped, being mostly the butt
of staid old jokes. Only Peter Dante and Jonathan Loughran, who play two
would-be Satanists ("Devil groupies" might be more appropriate), are
particularly funny, and even they get pretty old, pretty fast.
"Little Nicky" is littered with cameo appearances by Sandler's acting
colleagues, particularly ex-"Saturday Night Live" castmembers. Some of
these work well: Jon Lovitz is amusing as an ill-fate peeping tom, and
Reese Witherspoon is enormously charming as a Valley Girl-like angel. But
many of them are just bizarre and off-putting -- consider Dana Carvey as
an evil referee, and especially Quentin Tarantino, who hams up the screen
as a crazy preacher. Even Rodney Dangerfield, who plays Nicky's
grandfather Lucifer, can't mine his brief appearances for laughs of any
kind. By and large, these cameos are just gratuitous and unnecessary, and
detract from the overall flow of the film.
"Little Nicky" basically amounts to a lightweight version of "Dogma", last
year's wonderful Kevin Smith religious comedy. It is a movie which 
certainly has its moments; I admit, I laughed out loud on more than one
occasion. But it is frustratingly uneven, and settles more than a few
times for the sorts of immature, unfunny gags which have become the staple
of major comedies in the past few years. If you're hoping for a devil of a
good movie, look elsewhere: "Little Nicky" is a minor demon at best.

The Devil must have hired a new PR firm to spruce up his image here on
Earth. First, the Great Horned One took the form of a slinky, sexy
supermodel in Bedazzled, and here, in Little Nicky, Satan is portrayed
as a mild-mannered version of Hugh Hefner, right down to his velvet robe
monogrammed with a big `D.'
Little Nicky, like Bedazzled, is rated PG-13, hovers around the
90-minute mark and deals with a young man thrown into a
fish-out-of-water story.  Adam Sandler (Big Daddy) plays the titular
Nicky, one of three sons fathered by the Devil (Harvey Keitel, U-571).
Nicky is no bad ass, especially compared to his two older brothers,
Adrian (Rhys Ifans, The Replacements) and Cassius (Tiny Lister Jr., Next
Friday).  He might have turned out as evil as his siblings, but Nicky
was hit in the face with a shovel, leaving him with a sluggish brain and
a speech impediment that makes him sound like Renée Zellweger.
The gist of Nicky goes a little something like this: Satan is retiring
and needs to appoint one of his three sons to rule Hell for the next
10,000 years.  When he fails to make his choice, Adrian and Cassius get
pissed off and head for Earth, which, for some reason, blocks the gates
of Hell and causes the Devil to decompose faster than a leper in an
arm-wrestling contest.  The only thing that can save him from falling
completely apart is Nicky, who is instructed to find his brothers and
bring them back within a week.
On Earth, Nicky needs to constantly dress in warm clothes (a nice touch)
and experiences things like eating and sleeping for the first time in
his life.  He meets and falls for a nerdy, snaggle-toothed design
student named Valerie (Patricia Arquette, Bringing Out the Dead) and has
a great deal of difficulty tracking down his troublemaking brothers.
Part of Hollywood's fondness for Sandler is because his films gross well
while maintaining low budgets (aside from his salary).  Nicky is
probably the most expensive film he's made.  It's full of
computer-generated animation that seems as foreign to Sandler films as
comedy is to The Michael Richards Show.  And it appears they may have
saved some bucks by raiding the Hell set of Woody Allen's Deconstructing
Harry.
Nicky is also full of some wonderful cameo appearances from the likes of
Rodney Dangerfield, Reese Witherspoon, Ozzy Osbourne, Quentin Tarantino,
Dan Marino and a slew of former Saturday Night Live stars including Dana
Carvey, Kevin Nealon, Robert Smigel, Michael McKean, Jon Lovitz and Rob
Schneider  and that's just the tip of the iceberg.  Some recurring
characters from Sandler's previous films pop up, too.
Nicky's acting isn't anything to write home about, but that shouldn't
come as much of a surprise to anybody.  It's certainly funny, and may be
Sandler's most consistently funny film since Happy Gilmore  which I
consider to be one of the greatest comedies of the 90s.  His
performance here is paper-thin (like The Waterboy), and I'd much rather
see him play a normal Joe (like Big Daddy), but Nicky is entertaining
enough for that to be overlooked.  Tougher to ignore is the glaring
product placement of a certain fried chicken chain that is prominently
displayed in several scenes.
Nicky was directed by Steven Brill, who has acted in two of Sandler's
previous films.  As a director, his only feature film credit is the
kiddie pic Heavyweights, but Brill also penned the scripts for duds like
Ready to Rumble and The Mighty Ducks trilogy.  Like all of Sandler's
comedies, Nicky was co-written by Sandler and Tim Herlihy.  And don't
think about leaving the theatre early, or you'll miss the funny finale
in which you get to find out what happens to each of the characters.
1:24  PG-13 for adult language and violence

Be prepared to spend the first twenty minutes in humor hell, where 
several big name actors flop over gags that can't beat a rubber chicken 
on the funnymeter. Wait, I take that back, a ghoul with breasts on his 
head is pretty funny. 
Adam is the daft third son of the current reigning devil. The older two 
sons missing a chance at dad's throne decide to escape on up to Earth, 
freezing the fiery gates to hell and leaving pops to decompose appendage 
by appendage for a full week. Adam is the only one who can save dad. He 
must bop on down to Earth, capture his brothers in a whiskey flask and 
bring them both back to Hell before the seventh day. 
The film takes a break from being horrible once Adam gets "down to 
Earth." Here the film is still not good, but lovable despite - and the 
hearty-laugh to wincing-groan ratio improves as well. Several very funny 
bits coaxed audible chuckles from this narrow-eyed crowd. Managing to 
avoid a slip back into the horrible, "Little Nicky" never breaks into 
the excellent, or even the very good. 
Sort of a "Dogma" lite (way lite), "Nicky" still may capture the amore 
of a certain party animal crowd just after they've mauled a refer-laced 
cake seeking only to satiate their craving for the less than silly. 
Perhaps it'll even become the next "Rocky Horror" - who knows?

For better or for worse (mostly for the worse) Adam Sandler's back on
the big screen.  And it's pure, satanic family fun.
Little Nicky (Adam Sandler) is the devil's third--and least
impressive--son.  Bested in brains by his brother Adrian (Rhys Ifans)
and in strength by his brother Cassius (Tiny Lester), Nicky finds little
joy outside of hanging out in his hell-bound bedroom, banging his head
to heavy metal favorites.  That is, until his father's 10,000-year reign
draws to a close and it's time to name the new ruler of Hades.
When the devil (Harvey Keitel) decides to continue his rule rather than
bequeath the throne to one of his sons, Nicky's relief is palpable.  (He
knows full well the eternity of wedgies he might otherwise endure.)  But
Cassius and Adrian are not so agreeable, and they leap through the gates
of Hell to wreak havoc on the unsuspecting world above.  Now little
Nicky must face his fears and unleash the evil within himself to save
his father, and the world, from certain doom.
Perhaps the most amazing thing about the Adam Sandler phenomenon is the
actor's wild popularity and box office success, in spite of a pronounced
outward stupidity and total inability to act.  Not unlike Mike Myers,
Sandler is funniest at his absolute lamest extreme.  Just as he reaches
the zenith of idiocy, his humor becomes surreal and self-referential. 
He reflects each of us as grade school clowns, spewing milk from our
spastic nostrils.
But Sandler's attention to comedic detail betrays a greater intelligence
behind his work.  As Nicky dons his hellish robes to greet his father,
the robe itself is comedy, covered in heavy metal patches for Pantera,
Iron Maiden, and the like.
Like any Adam Sandler movie, Little Nicky is a Saturday Night Live
reunion, pulling cast members from as far back as the early eighties. 
The very first scene features Jon Lovitz peeping in on a panty-clad
woman, Kevin Nealon stars as the boob-headed gatekeeper of Hell, Dana
Carvey (as part of a carefully orchestrated--and probably
doomed--comeback) appears as a possessed basketball referee, and the
list goes on.  What's more impressive is the caliber of Sandler's
supporting cast, which includes Quentin Tarantino and Michael McKean in
minor roles, and cameos by Ozzy Osborne, Henry Winkler, and Regis
Philben.  Make no mistake; these are not great performances.  But these
self-effacing appearances lend a depth and clarity to the film's humor
that will assure it a place in cult history.
Ultimately, Little Nicky is a very stupid movie.  And that's just the
way we like it.

Steven Brill's LITTLE NICKY, starring box office champ Adam Sandler as 
Little Nicky, is a surprise in more ways than one.  Starting off 
abysmally bad, it manages to atone for its early sins and turn into a 
very funny comedy.  The credit for the success of its humor falls on a 
superlative supporting cast and a director who manages to coax the most 
out of each of them.  The special effects and the humorous sets add 
immensely to the revelry.  One wickedly funny scene features hundreds of 
charging spiders with Adam Sandler faces, ŕ la THE FLY.
The negative surprise is that, with raunchy humor like a cross between 
AUSTIN POWERS and THE NUTTY PROFESSOR, LITTLE NICKY is a PG-13 comedy 
that would have been more appropriately rated R -- more on some of the 
reasons why later.
The story has Little Nicky's Dad (Harvey Keitel), a.k.a. the Devil, 
literally falling apart after his two other sons, Adrian (Rhys Ifans, 
NOTTING HILL) and CASSIUS (Tommy Lister) escape to Earth.  Unless Nicky 
can bring them both back home to Hades, Dad will slowly disintegrate 
like the Cheshire cat, leaving only his frown behind.  Rodney 
Dangerfield, in one of many hilarious cameos, plays Lucifer, Dad's dad.  
(Quentin Tarantino, in another of the film's wild and wacky cameos, 
plays a blind preacher.)
Sandler plays his usual stupid character, only stupider this time.  A 
bulldog named Beefy serves as his guide in New York City where Nicky's 
brothers have gone to wreak chaos worthy of Batman's villains.  With 
lovable crudeness, the spike-collared dog tells it like it is.  Beefy's 
girlfriend is a sewer rat.
As Nicky's groupies, two stoner dudes and devil worshipers, Peter (Peter 
Dante) and John (Jonathan Loughran), follow him wherever he goes.  
Patricia Arquette, as Nicky's sweetness-and-light girlfriend, provides 
the perfect complement to a story brimming with wickedness.
Although a cogent case could be made for Beefy's being the best part of 
the movie, my vote would go to Reese Witherspoon (ELECTION and 
PLEASANTVILLE), who plays an angel named Holly.  After setting most of 
the film in either hell or New York City -- yes, you can tell the 
difference -- the story switches briefly to visit a heaven that looks 
like a parody of the Robin Williams film, WHAT DREAMS MAY COME.  Holly 
is the reigning teen princess in the land of the eternally juvenile.  
Witherspoon, an extremely intelligent actress who usually plays control 
freaks, is a ditzy Valley girl type this time.  She plays wonderfully 
against type, and her every word and gesture had me in stitches.
The level of sexual humor and language should have gotten the film an R 
rating.  The movie opens with a peeping tom (Jon Lovitz) in a tree, 
spying on a woman getting undressed in her bedroom.  This causes him to 
go straight to hell, literally.  Other stronger bits of crude humor 
include a transvestite (Clint Howard) getting his kicks from hot wax on 
his nipples, Hitler (Christopher Carroll) in a frilly dress being 
tortured by having pineapples shoved up his rear and Hell's Gatekeeper 
(Kevin Nealon) being punished by having breasts grow out of his head.
>From the angels we get the inside scoop on God's brain power.  "God is 
so smart!" says one angel.  "Like Jeopardy smart!" adds another.  And 
LITTLE NICKY, for all of its coarseness, is a surprisingly smart comedy.  
It's the first Adam Sandler film that I've ever recommended.  (I could 
almost recommend THE WEDDING SINGER.)  But, as I said, it is the 
ensemble cast, not Sandler himself, that makes LITTLE NICKY sizzle.
LITTLE NICKY runs 1:28.  It is officially rated PG-13 for crude sexual 
humor, some drug content, language and thematic material, but, as I 
said, I think an R would have been more appropriate.  Depending on the 
kid, the movie would be acceptable for kids around 12 or 13, and up but 
take in account my previously mentioned examples.
My son Jeffrey, age 11, thought the movie was pretty good and gave it ** 
1/2.  His favorite character was the bulldog.  His friend John, age 12, 
thought the film was a really good comedy and gave it *** 1/2.  His 
favorite character was Dad's dad.  John's twin, Steven, thought it was 
really funny and gave it ***.  His favorite characters were the stoner 
dudes.  All of the boys commented that the film should have been rated R.

     Back in the late '70s and early '80s, Burt Reynolds started making
movies that generally appeared to be cast parties committed to celluloid. 
Most notably in the CANNONBALL RUN films, Burt and a bunch of his pals
apparently got together and decided, "Wouldn't it really be great if we
took enormous amounts of a studio's money and then just got together and
screwed around for a couple of hours?" The result was the kind of film 
where it was obvious that everyone in the movie was having loads and loads
of fun. Viewers, on the other hand, generally found the experience about
as much fun as having the cars in the film back up repeatedly over the 
base of their skulls.
     In LITTLE NICKY, Adam Sandler decides to hold a reunion for all his
former "Saturday Night Live" cast-mates and cronies, only he forgot to
bring a script. Or anything funny to do. Or anything to counteract the
typically Y2K gratuitous crudeness that makes you want to swear off ever
seeing movies again. The premise finds Sandler cast as Nicky, the
milquetoast son of the Devil (Harvey Keitel). Dear old dad has recently
decided that he's not ready to give up the throne to one of his progeny,
which angers Nicky's nastier brothers Adrian (Rhys Ifans) and Cassius (Tom
"Tiny" Lister). Nicky's Satanic siblings flee to the world above,
determined to create a hell on earth (perhaps by financing additional Adam
Sandler movies). This development threatens to upset the balance between
good and evil, or something to that effect, so Nicky must go retrieve his
brothers -- and make out with Patricia Arquette, and do a feature-length
commercial for Popeye's Chicken -- before Daddy Devil disintegrates into a
pile of special effects-generated body parts.
     Let's leave aside for a moment the fact that LITTLE NICKY is based on
the morally itchy proposition that we're expected to root for the survival
of the Devil. There's plenty more repugnant stuff in LITTLE NICKY that may
make you wish you too were disintegrating into a pile of special
effects-generated body parts (ideally without any sensory apparatus to
take in the film itself). Sure, we could all just chuckle about it and
shake our heads ruefully about the increasing popularity of such "moron
movies." That would mean giving a pass to (ostensible) gags based on
children getting drunk and vomiting, dogs humping, jabs at a guy perhaps
being gay, various bodily fluids, a pair of comic relief Satan-worshipers,
a demon with a huge pair of breasts on his head and Hitler getting his
daily punishment of large objects shoved up his rectum. Please, somebody
throw me a pair of knee pads, 'cause they're aching from where I'm
slapping them.
     Of course, Adam Sandler fans would likely consider such a sarcastic
dismissal the whining of an out-of-touch guy who just doesn't get how
brilliantly hysterical Sandler is. And such a predictable view might be
remotely defensible if not for the fact that Sandler himself is reduced to
the status of straight man for most of the film. LITTLE NICKY finds
Sandler mugging and doing the requisite silly voice, yet generally
shrinking into the background while his supporting characters toss out the
lame punch lines. Like the good host, he defers to his "SNL" buddies 
(Carvey, Lovitz, Nealon, Schneider, writer Robert Smigel as the voice of
Mr. Beefy the Bulldog), cast members from previous films (Allen Covert,
Peter Dante, Jonathan Loughran) and even Harvey Keitel and Quentin
Tarantino. This is a film that asks you to laugh harder at a performance
by Quentin Tarantino than a performance by Adam Sandler. If you need to
know anything more to keep you away, your soul is already lost.
     LITTLE NICKY finds a brief spark of life late in the film when Reese
Witherspoon turns up as an angel in a heaven that's more like a sorority
house. The gags about giggling cherubim are at least moderately amusing,
and Witherspoon continues to show the comic chops that made her so good in
ELECTION. But LITTLE NICKY can never get past the vibe that the whole
thing was an excuse for Sandler to give work to his friends so they could
riff on the set. You don't need to waste time being outraged by a film
about a hero from hell, or by its stupidity and crass humor. You can save
all your outrage for the idea that Adam Sandler is asking you to for your
ticket dollars to finance his high-concept hot tub party.

After a 10,000 year rule, Satan (Harvey Keitel) decides to stay on the throne
instead of turning it over to one of his three sons.  That's fine by Little
Nicky (Adam Sandler), but not his brothers Adrian (Rhys Ifans, "Notting Hill")
and Cassius (Tommy 'Tiny' Lister, Jr.), who decide to leave their hellish
home and create their own on Earth.  Their departure freezes the gates of 
hell, causing Papa demon to begin to decompose, so it's up to Little Nicky
to save the world and his dad by returning his two brothers to Hell.
Adam Sandler movies are definitely an 'acquired' taste.  I've always found 
him likeable, even in his subpar outings ("The Wedding Singer" is really the 
only of his films that succeeds outside of his own genre).  While that's the 
case here as well, "Little Nicky" is otherwise so torturously awful that it 
makes one wonder how the highly paid Sandler could foist such bogus product 
into the marketplace.
This is the type of comedy that attempts to get yucks by having Hitler
appear in a French maid's outfit to have Satan place a pineapple where the 
sun don't shine.  The 'story' is just a long, drawn out 90 minute affair of 
having Nicky learn to do human things like eat (Popeye's Chicken is Sandler's 
fast food product placement of choice in this outing) and sleep,
and attempt to get his more powerful, smarter brothers info a magical flask
aided by Beefy, a talking demon bulldog (voice of Robert Smigel).  He also
falls in love with an awkward design student (Patricia Arquette) and ends
up with a roommate, Todd (Allen Covert, "Big Daddy"), implied to be gay
(more uproariousness!).
It's amazing to see all the misguided people who show up in this clunker.
First there's the seemingly brilliant casting of Keitel, who's never been
more dreadful.  His dad, Lucifer, is played by Rodney Dangerfield, milking
hoary laughs in a pitiful walk through.  Jon Lovitz appears as a sinner,
reminding us that any good performance he's gotten onto film must have
been an accident.  Michael McKean is the chief of police.  Quentin Tarantino
is a blind street preacher who 'smells' the devil (and overacts atrociously).
Clint Howard proves that he's the most shameless actor working
in film today.  Rob Schneider appears to repeat his 'you can do it'
encouragements from "The Waterboy."  Dana Carvey takes on Nicky on the
basketball court (amidst the real Harlem Globetrotters no less).  Carl
Weathers, Regis Philbin, Kevin Nealon, Ellen Cleghorne, Henry Winkler,
Ozzy Osbourne....what were they all thinking?  At least the terrifically
talented Reese Witherspoon provides a bubbly bright spot as a Valley Girlish
angel.
Technically the film averages out to mediocrity.  Hell's a blatant make
believe soundstage, costume is obvious, makeup nothing special.  Post dubbing
of dialogue appears to be synched incorrectly in several scenes.  Steven
Brill's (writer of all THREE Mighty Ducks movies) direction is pedestrian
at best.
There are maybe 3 laughs in the entire film (written by Tim Herlihy, Adam
Sandler and Steven Brill).  Nicky returns to hell whenever he dies, fairly
frequently and sometimes amusingly.  Sandler also gets a couple of laughs
from rock music references.  That's IT.
