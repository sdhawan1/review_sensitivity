     It is entirely likely that few viewers will think of HAPPY, TEXAS as
an instantly dated comedy.  They'll laugh along with the broad humor,
letting the premise take them along on all its wacky misunderstandings and
complications.  They'll roar like the audience member in front of me at
the incongruous situations.  And while there are plenty of things that are
worth a chuckle in HAPPY, TEXAS, there is this one glaring issue that made
it impossible for me to surrender completely to its zaniness.  You see, in
HAPPY, TEXAS, homosexuality itself is the punch line.  It's a superbly
cast feature-length episode of "Three's Company."
     The story begins on a Texas chain gang, where con artist Harry
Sawyer (Jeremy Northam), car thief Wayne Wayne Wayne Jr. (Steve Zahn) and
murderer Bob Maslow (M. C. Gainey) are on their way back to solitary after
a scuffle.  A close call with an armadillo sends the transport van into a
ditch, freeing the three prisoners, with Maslow freeing himself more
completely while leaving Harry and Wayne chained together.  After stealing
an R.V., the two escaped cons find themselves in the small town of Happy,
which has been expecting the two men in this particular R.V.  The two men
are Steven and David, profesional beauty pageant organizers hired to
prepare local grade-school girls for the Little Miss Fresh-Squeezed
competition.  Oh, and Steven and David also happen to be gay lovers.
     Naturally, Harry and Wayne's role-playing leads to confusion and
awkward moments.  Some of those moments are indeed very funny,
particularly Wayne's spastic first attempts at choreography and his
brusque manner with the children; others are ridiculously trite, like the
number of occasions in which Harry and Wayne are caught in what appears to
others to be a tender moment.  HAPPY, TEXAS tries to create some character
relationships, notably a pseudo-romance between Harry and local bank
president Jo ("Profiler's" Ally Walker), but there's not much to any of
the interactions that feels genuine.  When the film builds towards a
will-they-or-won't-they involving Harry and Jo, the more appropriate
question given the slapdash efforts at building Harry's character arc, is
why-should-we-care.
     The reason nothing has any resonance, or even much humanity to the
belly laughs, is that HAPPY, TEXAS seems entirely content to be a sit-com.
When the town's laconic sheriff Chappy (William H. Macy) reveals his own
affections for Harry, the scene could have been played simply for the
comic awkwardness of the moment.  Instead, you can feel the audience
responding giddily to the mere idea of one man touching another, to the
sight of a gay bar, to Chappy and Harry slow dancing.  The wonderfully
talented Macy invests Chappy with far more warmth and dignity than the
character deserves, but there's something disconcerting about the whole
enterprise.  While it may seem surrealistically forward-thinking to have
an entire small Texas town respond with tolerant indifference to the idea
of two gay men working with their children, the device actually serves the
opposite purpose.  I was left watching a fish-out-of-water comedy in which
the land animals weren't in on the jokes at the fishes' expense.
     HAPPY, TEXAS winds up even clumsier when Maslow returns, setting up a
car-chase-and-shootout showdown.  At least by that point the film has
surrendered to its lowbrow sensibilities, making for a raucous comedy
with little subtlety.  The talent in the cast keeps sparking HAPPY, TEXAS
to comic high notes -- Macy, as already noted, is utterly charming; Zahn
is a delightfully high-strung and bug-eyed -- yet those notes rarely blend
into a happy tune.  I can't imagine the film played that way on the page
with this many gifted actors interested, but HAPPY, TEXAS offers the same
situations John Ritter turned into laugh-track gold 20 years ago.  How
little has changed in the gay '90s.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Basically a 90s twist on Some Like it Hot, high-profile Sundance
acquisition Happy, Texas is cute, lightweight and not unlike a big bowl
of Chinese food  damn enjoyable while you're wolfing it down, but
ultimately leaving an empty feeling in your belly an hour after you
consume it.  Here, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are replaced by Jeremy
Northam and Steve Zahn, and instead of posing as female musicians they
must pretend to be homosexual beauty pageant coordinators.
The film opens with three convicts chained together while on highway
clean-up detail.  There is a brainy one named Harry Sawyer (Northam, An
Ideal Husband), a brawny one named Bob (M.C. Gainey, ConAir) and a
goofy, short one named Wayne Wayne Wayne Jr. (Zahn, You've Got Mail).
There is also a funny gag involving a dead armadillo (if you find dead
armadillos humorous) which leads to the three felons being driven back
to prison for punishment.  But their van crashes during a fight between
Wayne and Bob, and the jailbirds escape.
Bob heads in one direction while Harry and Wayne steal a recreational
vehicle from the parking lot of a convenience store gas station.  While
parked in the dark several miles later, they are picked up by Happy's
Town Sheriff Chappy Dent (William H. Macy, Mystery Men), who leads the
men into the courthouse packed with local officials.  Harry and Wayne
think they're about to be thrown back into the clink, while everybody
else assumes that they are David and Steven, the national beauty pageant
experts that Happy has hired to boost the chances of a local girl
qualifying for a state beauty pageant.  When the locals begin to
negotiate their salary, Harry and Wayne think that their prison sentence
is being haggled.  Hilarity ensues.
The cons plan on picking up their fee in the morning and skipping town,
but the observant Harry overhears the potential for a bigger score while
waiting in line at the town bank.  In two weeks, local farmers will cash
giant checks for the year's harvest, meaning the bank will have a ton of
cash ripe for misappropriation.  So Harry and Wayne decide to stick it
out and pretend to be the pageant pros, thinking that watching teen-aged
girls prance around in leotards may not be a bad way to spend some time
while laying low.
Surprise No. 1 comes when they find out that the contestants in the
Little Miss Fresh Squeezed Pre-Teen Talent Competition are about half
the age they expected.  Surprise No. 2 comes when they find out that the
guys they're impersonating are a gay couple.  The whole town of Happy
thinks the manly jailbirds are in a relationship and they have no choice
but to play along.  Apparently above the usual opinionated views that
small-town Southerners may have about alternative lifestyles, the
residents of Happy embrace Harry and David as celebrities, acknowledging
their obvious talent for pizzazz by admitting `They're crafty that way.'
Things proceed predictably from here, with Harry beginning to con the
relationship-phobic banker (Ally Walker, Profiler) and eventually
falling for her, while Wayne is stuck with the talentless kids, forced
to learn how to sew and dance.  Not to be outquirked, Sheriff Chappy
even has a sexual identity crisis.
Prior to the screening of this film at the Toronto International Film
Festival, first-time director and co-writer Mark Illsley (who was the
assistant on Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves) explained that about fifteen
to twenty minutes of footage was reshot and inserted into the film after
it played the Sundance Film Festival (where Zahn earned special acting
honors).  It appeared to me that most of the new scenes center around
the relationship between Harry and the banker, which is too bad because
I would have preferred to see more of the pageant preparation (Zahn) and
less of the romance.  You could also tell new footage from the old by
Zahn's disappearing soul patch (the hair right under his bottom lip).
But the film is still a blast to watch, if not just for the wonderful
actors involved in the project (Zahn took home a special acting award
from Sundance), who reportedly all worked for scale.

     Since few people saw DROP DEAD GORGEOUS, HAPPY, TEXAS will likely
not be remembered as the second beauty pageant comedy of 1999.
     The lighthearted story of two convicted felons who break out of
jail and find themselves impersonating a pair of gay pageant producers
in the sleepy town of Happy, Texas, this film has a lot riding on what
amounts to a one-joke concept.
     And boy, how they work that joke!  Wayne Wayne Wayne Jr. (Zahn) and
Harry Sawyer (Northam) are complete opposites.  They both find love
interests in the town, but everyone thinks they're gay!  Even the
sheriff (Macy) thinks so, if you catch my drift.  And they don't know
anything about beauty pageants!  Oh, the comic possibilities!
     And for the most part, those possibilities are wasted.  Whereas a
film like WAITING FOR GUFFMAN took a more savvy approach to basically
the same movie, HAPPY wastes its energy on one increasingly lame gay
joke after another.  Add to that the fact that Walker and Douglas (born:
Massachusetts) just don't fit as Texas belles, and HAPPY is a bit of a
mess.  Sure, it's cute and funny at times (thank the hilarious Zahn for
that), but overall, HAPPY is flat.

 I can't remember a single memorable quote from this dud. Sorry.
Starring Steve Zahn, Jeremy Northam, William H. Macy, Illeana Douglas,
Ally Walker. Rated PG-13.
Happy, Texas is the worst kind of disappointment, a film that has no
idea what to do with its ingenious comic premise. It takes a good idea
and then does everything wrong. Nothing works. The performances are way
off, the direction misses the point and the laughs are conspicuously
absent. Here is a film with nothing -- nothing -- going for it; how it
became a big hit at the Sundance Film Festival is completely beyond me.
The film actually shares some plot traits with the infinitely better
Three to Tango. Both films are about heterosexual people forced to
pretend they're gay; in this case to escape arrest, in the other to get
a job. Here our protagonists are two escaped convicts; Wayne Wayne
Wayne Jr. (Steve Zahn), who is very volatile and slightly slow and
Harry Sawyer (Jeremy Northam), who is the smart one -- and we know he
is smart, you see, because the movie tells us that he was convicted for
credit card fraud. See? Smart guy! In any event, the two manage to
escape when their transport van crashes. They seek refuge in a town
called Happy, Texas where they are mistaken for a gay couple who
organize kiddie beauty pageants.
Being smart, Harry decides to stay there. He appoints Wayne Wayne Wayne
as the pageant master while he himself deals with the more pressing
business such as planning a bank robbery and courting a town gal (Ally
Walker) without revealing his true sexual orientation (gasp! -- he is
straight!). Wayne Wayne Wayne struggles to manage the wee ones while
Harry hangs out with townfolk. Told you he was smart.
What smart Harry didn't count on was Chappy (William H. Macy), the town
sheriff and a closeted homosexual. All of a sudden Chappy decides that
Harry is his kind of guy and wants to go out with him. Not wanting to
compromise their position, Harry goes with him to a gay bar and fakes
a "relationship". Since he doesn't want to "do anything" with the
kindly sheriff, he must convince him that he likes to "move his
relationships along slowly".
This movie is a total mess. The premise is handled incorrectly. The
jokes just sort of sit there; director Mark Illsley never aspires to
take them a step further. Northam's Harry spends most of the running
time essentially denying the premise; he refuses to accept his own idea
of pretending to be gay. Even in his scenes with Chappy, he is oddly
reserved, never bursting into a sort of outrageousness we would expect
from a movie like this. Zahn hams it up like nobody's business to the
point where he is like one of the three stooges. Not funny. In the part
of the would-be pageant coordinator we want someone clever who will
think on his feet and give us something creative rather than some moron
who will do little but make a fool of himself.
The only performer who emerges out of this ordeal with some dignity
left is the great William H. Macy, the one actor here who is successful
in his role. Zahn and Northam simply have the wrong idea; their
performances are inadequate because of the way they choose to play
them. I don't know why someone didn't at least momentarily halt this
production half-way through and insist that it wasn't working. The real
disaster isn't even the film itself but the fact that reportedly
intelligent people let this movie's inadequacies get to the point of no
return.
Happy, Texas could've worked. All it needed was a good think-through.
Performances should have been altered and the script reworked. That's
what the film needed. It didn't get it. This is the result.

HAPPY, TEXAS (director: Mark Illsley; screenwriters: Ed
Stone/Illsley/Phil Reeves; cinematographer: Bruce Douglas Johnson;
editor: Norman Buckley;cast: Jeremy Northam (Harry Sawyer), Steve Zahn
(Wayne Wayne Wayne Jr.), William H. Macy (Sheriff Chappy Dent), Ally
Walker (Josephine McClintock), Illeana Douglas (Ms. Schaefer), M.C.
Gainey (Bob), Ron Perlman (Nalhober), Mo Gaffney (Mrs. Bromley), Paul
Dooley (Judge); Runtime: 98; Miramax Films; 1999)
A sitcom type of nonsensical comedy, one that has abolutely no bite.
Everyone in it is a cartoonish character, with the satire nonexistent
and the comedy coming in a forced and heavy-handed manner derived from
its physical comedy. It is such a forgettable film, that I forgot it 3/4
of the way through.
The film's one-idea joke is about a misunderstanding, as 2 of the 3
escaped convicts wind up stealing a homosexual couple's R. V. and find
themselves in Happy, Texas, expected to put on a beauty pageant as a gay
couple. The jokes are coming at the expense of the convicts being cast
as homosexuals, as the locals in this small-town accept them because
they want the young schoolgirls to win the contest so that they can go
for the first time to Dallas for the state regional finals.
The film opens on a Texas chain gang, where a smart, suave, con artist,
Harry Sawyer (Jeremy Northam), and a dumb, crude, goofy, car thief,
Wayne Wayne Wayne Jr. (Steve Zahn) get into a brawl with a mean-spirited
murderer, Bob Maslow (M. C. Gainey) and when transported back to the
prison for solitary confinement, their van overturns, allowing them to
escape.
Wayne and Harry go off chained together and steal the R.V., and soon
find that they are in Happy, Texas, and that Sheriff Chappy (Macy) is
there to escort them to town to see the judge and arrange for their job
payment. The humor comes about as the convicts find they stole the
vehicle of the gay couple David and Steven, who are professional beauty
pageant organizers hired to prepare the grade-school girls for the
Little Miss Fresh-Squeezed competition.
If there is anything amusing about this film, which is doubtful, it
comes at awkward moments for the two convicts, who are trapped into
being perceived as homosexuals. There is physical humor as Wayne acts
crass and unsure of himself around the children and their teacher Miss
Shaefer (Illeana). He attempts to choreograph their show numbers and has
no clue how to relate to the kids; while Harry's character gets caught
in a romance with the single bank president, Josephine McClintock
(Ally), who goes by the name of Jo. Their romance seemed artificial,
sort of like filler stuff for the fluff story. Not to be undone by
Harry, Wayne has an equally unconvincing romance with Miss Shaefer. And
to make things fit the formula pattern of this very soft satire, Chappy
and Harry start dating. This romance was just as unconvincing as the
others. The convicts are caught in awkward tender moments, which is
where the comic effort is always going. If this were on TV, where it
belongs as a sitcom, there would be canned laughter during the mock
romantic scenes.
The third escaped convict comes predictably back into the picture,
forcing the boys to go through with their plans to rob the bank, even
though the boys have a change of heart about robbing the bank, seeing
how everyone in town is so nice to them. This bank robbery is the final
clumsy attempt to draw laughs out of its unconvincing story, but this
robbery scene was too witless to watch without cringing. The film lacked
the art of making these situations funny...it didn't know how to draw
satire out of situations that were set to be mocked. The actors were
pleasant... but they just weren't too funny or believable.

Harry, a con man, (Northam) and Wayne Wayne Wayne, a car thief, 
(Zahn) are prisoners working on a chain gang in Texas.  They 
fight with a third prisoner and all three find themselves 
free due to a freak accident.  Harry and Wayne steal a van
belonging to a gay couple, David and Steven.  Soon they find
themselves in Happy, Texas and mistaken for the gay duo by
the local police chief (William H. Macy).  David and Steven 
specialize in little girl beauty pageants.  The citizens of 
Happy are desperate to win the Little Miss Fresh-Squeezed 
Beauty Pageant and have hired David and Steven to prepare 
their girls.  
Harry and Wayne decide to stick it out when they discover
how much money there is in the local bank.  They intend to
rob it.  The bank is run by Josephine (Ally Walker of 
Profiler fame).  Things get a little complicated as Harry 
falls for Josephine, the police chief falls for Harry, and
Wayne finds himself trapped with in a room full of little 
girls who expect him to teach them a winning number.
This is the kind of film that could easily be over the top
and not funny.  Instead, it is very funny.  It's directed
with a light touch and the performances are excellent.
Some of the best scenes are of Wayne trying to teach his
girls - who respond surprisingly well to his tactics.  Also
great is the date Harry has with the chief.  Macy gives 
his usual outstanding performance (when will he get the
lead role he deserves) and Walker is surprisingly good given
her mediocre performance on tv. There's even a small role
by Ron Perlman who always makes a movie for me.
I laughed throughout this film.  It's well structured and 
makes the premise work.  The laughs come fast and frequent 
and the plot loopholes are easily overlooked.  If you want
to see a funny film that doesn't focus on bodily fluids,
see Happy, Texas.

HAPPY TEXAS (M).  
(Miramax/Palace)
Director: Mark Illsley
Stars: Jeremy Northam, Steve Zahn, William H Macy, Illeana Douglas, Ally 
Walker, Ron Perlman, M C Gainey, Tim Bagley, Michael Hitchcock, Paul Dooley
Running time: 95 minutes.
Despite becoming more commercial over the years, the Sundance
Film Festival still manages to showcase some of the best of American
independent cinema and unearth a few new talented directors.  Happy
Texas was one of the surprise hits of the 1999 festival, and inspired
a bidding war amongst some of the studios.
This delightfully off beat comedy is the first film from
writer Ed Stone and director Mark Illsley, who crafted his skills as
an assistant with Kevin Reynolds (Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves, Rapa
Nui, etc).  Happy Texas tells the story of two escaped convicts who
hide out in a small town in Texas, and are mistaken for a pair of gay
pageant directors hired to prepare the local school girls for a
forthcoming beauty quest.
While the wonderfully named, barely literate car thief Wayne
Wayne Wayne jr (Steve Zahn, from Out Of Sight, Bandwagon, etc) is left
with eager teacher Ms Schaefer (Illeana Douglas) to help hone the
talents of his young charges, the more suave Harry Sawyer (Jeremy
Northam, largely cast against type) checks out the local bank, which
he judges is ripe for the picking.
But Harry slowly falls in love with the beautiful bank manager
(Profiler's Ally Walker), unaware that Chappy (William H Macy), the
town's lonely and closeted sheriff, has also secretly fallen for him -
hard.  Further complications develop when another escaped convict
shows up and forces Harry and Wayne to help him rob the bank.
Happy Texas follows on from those other recent comedies (In &
Out, The Birdcage, Three To Tango, etc) that embrace complex issues of
male sexuality and identity and milk the possibilities of the scenario
for laughs.  This charming and deftly written comedy also moves into
more familiar territory when it takes a non-judgmental look at the
mores and attitudes of small town America.  This is a town that
welcomes a pair of gay pageant directors with open arms because they
are strangers passing through, but somehow forces the sheriff to
conceal his sexuality because he has to live and work with these
people.  Happy Texas draws much of its genial humour from its look at
life in this small town and its quirky inhabitants, although there is
nothing malicious in it.
Unfortunately this zesty and fast paced film seems to run out
of puff before the final reel.  The film is let down slightly only by
the somewhat conventional nature of its very busy finale, which
includes a chase and a shoot-out.  Illsley manages to strike a nice
balance between the slapstick and the poignant here, and he directs
with surprising restraint, given his limited experience.
The solid cast throw themselves into their roles with
enthusiasm, but the film is lifted somewhat by two standout
performances.  The busy but always reliable Macy brings a nice touch
of pathos to his wonderful performance as Chappy, the lovelorn
sheriff.  Zahn is superb and brings a nice manic energy and physical
quality to his boisterous role.
During the hectic film going holiday season you should make a
detour via the multiplexes to check out Happy Texas.  It will put a
smile on your face.

   The playwright Plautus had a lot of fun with the comic
concepts mined from mistaken identity and so did
Shakespeare many centuries later.  Now it's first-time director
Mark Illsley's turn to have a ball with the notion and what joy
he must have had putting the script he co-wrote with Ed
Stone and Phil Reeves on the big screen.  "Happy Texas"
won't be Greek to anybody nor is the frolic-filled movie done
in the king's English.  In fact the great Jeremy Northam, to
whom we've been accustomed in lofty roles like "An Ideal
Husband" and "The Winslow Boy," puts on quite a good-ol'
boy Texas inflection and enjoys a happy chemistry with his
partner, Steve Zahn--who, incidentally, executes the first truly
fleshed-out role of his career.
   Opening on a Texas prison farm that sees a knock-down
fight between convicted killer Bob (M.C. Gainey) and petty
thief Wayne Wayne Wayne Jr. (Steve Zahn), a fight that is
observed with a sour face by Wayne's pal and fellow petty
crook Harry Sawyer (Jeremy Northam), Illsley takes us on a
wild ride through desert country.  One overturned prison van
later and stolen recreation vehicle later, Wayne and Harry 
wind up in the little town of Happy, Texas (actually Peru,
California) where they are mistaken by the burg's sheriff,
Chappy Dent (William H. Macy), for a couple of professionals. 
The folks have been waiting for two gay guys (who never
show up) to coach the munipality's annual beauty pageant:
Harry and Wayne seem to fit the description.  Thinking they
are going to "drive around and stuff hot bodies into tight
dresses," the daring duo become involved in pretending they
are significant others, in designing little outfits for 8-year-old
tykes who look up to the fellas as role models, and in
carrying on relationships with the county banker, Josephine
McLintock (Ally Walker) and eligible grade-school teacher Ms.
Schaefer (Illeana Douglas).
   Illsley cleverly divides the picture into alternating scenarios,
the best ones featuring Wayne as he molds the kiddies into a
winning troupe of budding Miss Americas and especially
Harry Sawyer as he gives avuncular advice to the woman of
his dreams, Jo, who all along is sure that he is a gay man. 
Only the town's loudmouth seems to catch on to the
chemistry between Jo and Harry: "He was looking at you the
way a fat man looks at fried food."  The plot thickens as
Sheriff Chappy Dent (Macy), certain that he has met the
partner of his dreams, furiously courts the bemused Harry.
   Shakespeare himself would be amused by the goings-on of
these people, who are not the usual blatant caricatures of
Hollywood hick humor-fetes but real people with hopes and
dreams looking to hook onto others who could give their
modest lives some more spice.  The down-home dialogue
features such goodies as the sheriff's restaurant order,
"Gimme the meanest steak you got, rare and I mean rare:
just dehorn it and slap its butt in here."
   As a movie centering ostensibly on a beauty pageant,
"Happy Texas" is a song and dance better than "Drop Dead
Gorgeous" and a heck of a lot less mean-spirited.  No
wonder this movie was a surprise hit of the last Sundance
Festival in Utah!

et a. A  Miramax release.  96 minutes.  PG-13.
"Happy, Texas" is set in the kind of place that goes by in a wink if 
you happen to drive through it.  Its motto is "a town without a 
frown." And the movie justifies it. It is also remarkable in many 
ways. It is a first film by its director (42-year old Mark 
Illsley).and the co-writers. Their previous credits in showbiz are 
minimal, even microscopic. What we have here is The Bunch That Came 
from Nowhere and certainly got somewhere.
The movie they made is loads of fun, improbabilities and 
impossibilities. But then, it is a comedy-farce, a genre that is not 
confined by verisimilitude. At the same time, while farce often has a 
lining of nastiness, even cruelty, this one does not have a mean bone 
in its body, while, additionally,  escaping the temptations of a 
feelgood picture.
The unreal plot has two convicts, Harry and Wayne, minor criminals 
and pals, plus a third one, a killer, returning to the penitentiary 
from road building. A vehicular accident frees them. The buddies 
snatch a motor home whose owners, in dire straits, will not report 
yet as stolen so as to get the insurance money. The escapees are 
(don't ask) somehow led by a sheriff (William H. Macy) to Happy, in 
the lawman's mistaken belief that the duo are the long-awaited 
organizers of Happy's Eighteenth Annual Beauty Pageant for pre-Teens.
It  happens that the genuine organizers are a gay couple, so that 
Harry Sawyer and Wayne Wayne Wayne must assume both professional and 
sexual identities. You get the drift by now. Everything is, and will 
increasingly become, a tangle of quid pro quos which is carried out 
with much brio and with the audience's willing suspension of 
disbelief. Helping the spectators is the overall kindness of Happy's 
denizens, their total lack of anti-gay (the word they use is 
"homosexual") prejudice, and, of course, love.
There are two appealing women in this tall tale, Josephine, who runs 
a diminutive bank that looks like something from an old Western; and 
schoolteacher Ms. Schaefer, whose pupils are the pageant's 
performers. (I must say here that this is not really a beauty pageant 
but a talent competition with other towns, a fact that gets us to 
avoid thoughts of a certain, murdered beauty queen).
 From the start the two buddies have started planning a robbery of the 
bank. The execution of this deed is Harry's job. Wayne gets stuck 
with training the kids. But what happens is --yes, a cliche, but so 
sweetly handled here-- that rapidly Harry and Jo (whose boy-friend is 
an on-off fellow)  are mutually attracted, while. more slowly, the 
same happens to Wayne and Mrs. Schaefer.
A third element, nicely worked in, is Sheriff Chappy, a very sweet 
fellow who discovers that he is attracted to Harry. And a fourth 
element, much later, is the reappearance of the third escaped convict 
who also wants to rob the bank while Harry and Wayne have second 
thoughts about it.
Does all this make sense? Not a bit, but who cares? The performers 
are all likable. The accents are fine, including Jeremy Northam 
(Harry Sawyer), the British actor recently seen in "The Winslow Boy" 
and in "The Ideal Husband."  Steve Zahn (Wayne), with his overgrown 
mustache and sideburns, and his redneck accent, is a model of 
vulgarity. Do notice that after his fling with Illeana Douglas, she 
shaves him, he loses his hickish looks and much of his low-class 
accent. A good, subtle touch.
Also subtle, during the weird courtship between Harry and Jo, is that 
he, her best friend by now, fixes her hairdo and makeup. This brings 
on a perceptible but un-showy progression of her looks from pleasant 
to beautiful.
The amorous sheriff is also subtly depicted, and so on. On the other 
hand, the film gets tangled up in too many directions which muddy the 
waters, especially in its second half.
When the only villain in the story (the nasty convict) takes 
hostages, robs the bank and has outside authorities come in, the 
slightly wounded sheriff says "I'm a little confused."
So might also say the public. What is a gay bar (or at least a Gay 
Night of dancing) doing in such a tiny town? Where did Wayne learn 
how to use a sewing machine? How do the kids get to be so so well 
prepared that they give a delightuful performance in the pageant. And 
more. But even then, even with a few dead spots, the movie's warm, 
inventive nature wins over the potholes of the plot.
Note: If you wish to see a splendidly comical satire of beauty 
pageants, get "Smile" a 1975 picture directed by Michael Ritchie, 
starring Bruce Dern.

Did I miss something? Along with the sleeper hit `The Blair Witch
Project', Mark Illsley's `Happy, Texas' was the most
talked about film at 1999's Sundance Film Festival. It was picked
up by Miramax for a hefty sum, and is now being released to critical
acclaim.  Disappointingly, the `Happy, Texas' which I saw is
nothing more than a dumb attempt at quirky humor that never finds its
footing.
Jeremy Northam and Steve Zahn portray, respectively, Harry Sawyer and
Wayne Wayne Wayne, Jr., two jailbirds who are freed when the van which
is carrying them crashes. The wanted criminals then rob an RV and head
for the nearest town, which happens to be Happy, Texas, `the town
without a frown.' Once they arrive, they are mistaken for a couple
of gay beauty pageant producers who are supposed to help the town
qualify for the statewide pageant. Fish out of water `comedy'
ensues.
Harry has his eye on the town's bank, which is run by Jo McLintock
(Ally Walker). She, like the rest of the town, believes that he is
gay, and they quickly become close friends. Harry, however, just wants
access to the bank's safe.
Meanwhile, Wayne gets stuck with the job of training the town's
girls. Along with a lady named Ms.  Schaefer (Illeana Douglas), Wayne
eventually figures out how to teach singing and dancing, through
rather unconventional methods. Soon he and Ms. Schaefer are a couple,
even though he's `gay'.
But the only sporadically funny bit of the film occurs when Harry
catches the eye of Chappy (William H. Macy), the town sheriff. Chappy,
a closeted homosexual, works up the courage to ask Harry out on a
date, and Harry reluctantly agrees. Being the typical movie small town
sheriff, Chappy is too dumb to realize that these two men are the
fugitives which he has been notified of in numerous notices.
`Happy, Texas' basically focuses on the four key relationships:
Harry and Chappy, Harry and Jo, Wayne and Ms. Schaefer, and Harry and
Wayne. Aside from the comic fireworks that William H.  Macy brings to
the proceedings, these main characters are rather dull creations.
The film, which does not live up to quirky small town gems like
`Cookie's Fortune', may have been more successful without
some unprecedented miscasting. The prospect of seeing Steve Zahn, who
has grown on me through his portrayals of stoners in `SubUrbia'
and `Out Of Sight', and Jeremy Northam, who has done fine
dramatic work in `The Winslow Boy' and `An Ideal Husband',
together in a comedy initially seemed exciting. But Northam can't
handle this type of comedy, and Zahn's characters have somehow
become similar and annoying. William H. Macy, who is almost as good
here as in `Fargo', should have been the one carrying `Happy,
Texas'.
The film has supposedly been edited since its premiere at Sundance,
and it shows. `Happy, Texas' can't be the same film that
people were raving about in Park City, because it just isn't very
good.  The screenplay, written by Ed Stone, Phil Reeves, and director
Mark Illsley just isn't very funny, and there isn't much that is
fresh or new. `Happy, Texas' is like `Some Like It Hot'
crossed with `In and Out', except with nowhere near as many
laughs or smarts as either of the two.
I guess good buzz can either be real (in the case of `The Blair
Witch Project') or way off (as in `Happy, Texas'). This
instantly forgettable trifle should be taken off Northam and Zahn's
resumes because both of them are fine actors, but `Happy, Texas'
proves that an actor is only as good as his role.

In the comedy genre of "Priscilla, Queen of the Desert" and
"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar," this whimsical
farce revolves around two convicts - Jeremy Northam ("The Winslow
Boy," "An Ideal Husband") and Steve Zahn ("Out of Sight") - who escape
from a chain-gang and steal a Winnebago, only to discover that its
rightful owners are two gay guys who travel around the country
producing children's beauty pageants. Their only hope of evading the
law is to assume these new identities, which is immediately funny
since neither crook is exactly in touch with his feminine side. When
they arrive in Happy, Texas, Zahn's job is to coach the pre-teen
contestants for the Little Miss Squeezed Pageant - to the delight of
supervisor Illeana Douglas - while Northam handles the business end.
Their plan is to pocket the contractual $1,000 fee and scram quickly -
after robbing the local bank. Only it's not that easy.  Beautiful
banker Ally Walker (TV's "Profiler") is attracted to Northam - and he
to her - but the only way he can be with her and maintain the charade
is to pretend to be her sympathetic confidante. And Northam's in for
an even bigger surprise when the tormented sheriff - that's William
H. Macy - has a hankering for him at a gay cowboy bar.  Screenwriters
Ed Stone, Phil Reeves and writer/director Mark Illsley were obviously
inspired by Billy Wilder's "Some Like It Hot" since there are many
similarities.  Curiously, in this era of Jon-Benet Ramsey's murder,
the jibes are gentle; somewhere, somehow there's irony buried in
juvenile beauty pageants that's yet to be unearthed. On the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Happy, Texas" is a snappy, screwball 6. And
if you like this, rent the video "Waiting for Guffman," which is even
funnier.

 Happy Texas (1999) 3 stars out of 4. Starring Jeremy Northam, Steve Zahn,
William H. Macy, Ally Walker and Illeana Douglas.
 "Happy Texas" is just that, a happy little, unpretentious comedy.
 The movie's impetus is that old chestnut about the escaped cons who are
mistaken for other people. It's a twist that dates as far back as Charlie
Chaplin's "The Adventurer."
 In this case, Harry (Jeremy Northam) and Wayne (Steve Zahn) are believed
to be two beauty pageant producers hired by the town of Happy, Texas, to
help qualify the town's girls for the Little Miss Squeezed Pageant.
 Oh, and the townspeople also think the pageant pros are gay. So, Harry and
Wayne go along in order to remain undetected by the law as well as to scope
out the local bank, which is ripe for pickin'.
 Along the way both men get involved with local women - Harry with Jo (Ally
Walker), the owner of the bank, and Wayne with Miss Schaefer (Illeana
Douglas), a schoolteacher.
 "Happy Texas "is one of those farces built upon mistaken identities. It's
a fun movie, filled with enjoyable, warm characters.
 And it has the added pleasure of William H. Macy as Chappy, Happy's
sheriff, whose low-key wooing of Harry is touching as well as comedic.
 Macy transforms a one-note character into a person with depth. When he
hurts, you feel his pain.
 Northam is the straight man (no pun intended), spending most of his time
wooing Jo and learning the intricacies of the bank. He's the brains of the
outfit.
 Zahn (best remembered as the girl-crazy member of The Wonders in Tom
Hanks' "That Thing You Do") is broader as the easily-frustrated Wayne. He
hates the idea of posing as a gay man since it is against his macho nature.
 Zahn is quite funny without being disrespectful.
And Douglas is a delight as the man-hungry Miss Schaefer who believes her
allure can help Zahn's Wayne switch his gender preference.
 Ultimately, the two cons become heroes and everything works out for the best.
After all, this is a comedy.
 "Happy Texas" written by Ed Stone, Phil Reeves and Mark Illsley, and
directed by Illsley, is an undemanding, good-time movie. The laughs are
consistent, and nearly continuous.
 But it also is a movie with heart, a delightful combination.

Small-time crooks Harry Sawyer (Jeremy Northam) and Wayne Wayne Wayne Jr.
(Steve Zahn) bust out of jail and steal an RV.  The RV, it turns out belongs to
David and Steven, a gay couple who go from town to town organizing beauty
pageants.  Harry and Wayne find themselves escorted to David and Steven's next
destination -- Happy, Texas -- where Harry and Wayne have to take over the task
of organizing a pageant for little girls.  Wayne gets the job of teaching the
girls to sing and dance, while Harry romances the owner of the local bank, Jo
McLintock (Ally Walker of TV's "Profiler"), with the goal of ripping off the
bank.  At the same time, thanks to his homosexual cover story, Harry is the
subject of unwanted advances from the local sheriff, Chappy Dent (William H.
Macy).  Wayne has a romance of his own with the kids' teacher (Illeana
Douglas).  Meanwhile, the law (Ron Perlman) and an enemy from prison (M.C.
Gainey) are gaining on the boys.
Despite this movie's quirky indie vibe, at heart it's painfully mainstream. 
Its plot is derived from the same formula as "Houseguest," "Sister Act," and
"Blue Steak":  the hero has to pretend to be someone he's not in order to hide
out, and in the process he changes his life and the lives of those around him. 
That plot is tame and predictable, I hoped that Harry and Wayne would actually
rob the bank and skip town, leaving devastation in their wake.  Instead,
everything goes pretty much as you'd expect.
The most redeeming feature of "Happy" is the performance of Macy.  His
character is a challenge:  a tough Texas lawman who's also a closeted
homosexual.  A lesser actor would have reduced Chappy to a cartoon of
masculinity, but Macy makes Chappy a fully-rounded, believable, and sympathetic
character.  When Chappy's heart is inevitably broken, the scene is devastating.
 Macy's work also keeps "Happy" from being just a homophobic gag, an updated
version of the men-in-dresses motif of "Some Like It Hot."
Sporting a thick drawl, Zahn wrings all the humor he can out of the script as
his character becomes increasingly obsessed with teaching his young charges to
strut their stuff. Northam is a fine actor -- he outacted the overrated Rupert
Everett in "An Ideal Husband" -- but "Happy" gives him nothing to work with. 
Likewise, Ally Walker seems to have potential, but Jo is just another "modern
woman making it on her own in a provincial small town."  Ho hum.
Bottom line:  the gay topic may seem avant garde, but "Happy, Texas" is pure
Disneyland.

I'm a firm believer in film critics admitting their biases, especially
when it may not be obvious.  Let me start by confessing that; as a
native Texan, I have always had a special place in my heart for
armadillos, a waddling Sherman tank of an animal that looks like a
possum with body armor.  Ever since they took to invading my outdoor
chapel service when I was a boy at camp, I've loved those little
critters.
In Mark Illsley's HAPPY, TEXAS, written with great glee by the director
and Ed Stone, an armadillo gets some revenge on its most common
predator, the automobile.  Forcing a prison vehicle off the road, the
armadillo ends up freeing the film's two heroes, a pair of likable
convicts, Harry Sawyer and Wayne Wayne Wayne, Jr.  Jeremy Northam (AN
IDEAL HUSBAND) with dashing charm plays Harry, and Steve Zahn (YOU'VE
GOT MAIL) with zany insanity plays Wayne, a guy with a brain 4 beers shy
of a six-pack.
After escaping into a vast Texas landscape filled by only the occasional
sagebrush, they end up stealing a beat-up RV owned by 2 gay guys, Steven
and David.  Harry and Wayne discover that the gay guys are local pageant
producers who advertise their product as "Princess Pageants at Pauper
Prices."  Visualizing voluptuous teenagers in skimpy bikinis, they are
happy to be mistaken for the pageant producers by Happy's Sheriff Chappy
Dent.  The sheriff escorts them into town, where they have been hired to
polish the local "talent."  The entire picture is marvelously cast but
none is better than veteran supporting actor William H. Macy (Academy
Award winner for FARGO) as the in-the-closet gay, Sheriff Dent.
The pageant turns out to be for the title of "Little Miss Squeeze," as
in oranges, and the contestants seem to be from the local kindergarten,
not the high school as Harry and Wayne had assumed.  As the pageant's
leader, Ms. Schaefer, Illeana Douglas (GRACE OF MY HEART) tells the guys
that the contestants were so bad last year that even their parents
didn't come to see them.  She sure is glad the town ponied up money to
hire professionals like them.
In a marvelously silly bit of physical comedy, Wayne screams at the
girls and tries to show them how to sing and dance.  He's a doofus
disaster at first, but, of course, he'll get better, which he manages to
make as prissily fun as when he is bad.  Wayne has trouble remembering
the name of the convict (David) he's impersonating so when Harry
introduces himself as Steven, Wayne calls himself "the other one."
Wayne becomes infatuated with Ms. Schaefer but being thought of as gay
slows him down.  Similarly, Harry has his eyes set on Josephine "Jo"
McLintock (Ally Walker), as well as the bank that she owns and that he'd
like to rob.  She adopts him as her "girlfriend," but some in town begin
to question his sexual preferences.  One of Jo's friends tells her that,
"he was looking at you the way a fat man looks at fried food."
One of the best subplots in a wonderful romp of a film concerns the
moves that Chappy puts on Harry.  On one date, Chappy takes Harry to gay
cowboy bar.  Ordering a steak, Chappy tells the waiter, "I want the
rarest steak you've got -- just dehorn it, wipe its butt and send it
in."
Is HAPPY, TEXAS for everyone?  Nope.  If you don't feel that you've
gotten your money's worth from a picture unless you can leave the
theater saddened by the gravity of the depressing situations, and if
your favorite films all have unhappy endings, then HAPPY, TEXAS may
leave you with an uncomfortably happy feeling.  But for those of us that
could use a little mirth in our lives, the good-spirited HAPPY, TEXAS
with its silly script and adorable antics is just what we need.
HAPPY, TEXAS runs a fast 1:44.  It is rated PG-13 for language, sexual
content and some violence and would be fine for kids around 12 and up.

CrankyCriticŽ movie reviews: Happy Texas
Rated  [PG-13], 104 minutes
Starring Jeremy Northam, Steve Zahn, William H. Macy, Ally Walker,
Illeana Douglas
Screenplay by Ed Stone and Phil Reeves
Directed by Mark Illsley
website: http://www.happy-texas.com
Lessee what we got here. We got three bankrobbers: one dumb, one brutal
and one average, normalguy con, all escaped from a Texas chain gang.
We've got an old maid school teacher. We've got a straight arrow cop and
a beautiful woman as a (business) authority figure in a small town in
which none of the principals have anything resembling a love life. Toss
gently with a case of mistaken identity and whether you call 'em stock
characters or stereotypes, if you've seen 'em once, you've seen 'em a
thousand times, written by a thousand different hacks, banging away at
their keyboards trying to pay the rent . . .
And on try number One Thousand and One, you find a pair of writers who
know what they're doing, in this case Ed Stone and Phil Reeves. The pair
take ordinary people in, for the most part, ordinary situations and give
a fistful of good actors some great material to build greater characters
with. When stuff like this happens, and it's usually with the "smaller"
and mostly independently produced films, we critics jump up and down and
yell until we're blue in the face, to try and drum up support for 'em.
Especially as the deluge of Oscar wannabe monstrosities comes surging at
us. But, being as the citizens of Happy, Texas are good, quiet folk,
Cranky will say it quietly: "please see this movie." It's sweet and it's
simple and it's heartfelt and it's well worth your time.
Simply: Three cons escape from a chain gang. Bob Maslow (M.C. Gainey)
finds the keys, unlocks himself and runs away. Harry Sawyer (Jeremy
Northam) and Wayne Wayne Wayne Jr. (Steve Zahn) either don't try to find
the keys that Bob has tossed, or are just to dim to go looking for 'em.
It doesn't matter; chained cons are just funnier. Harry and Wayne steal
a broken down RV and through coincidences to, um, coincidental to give
away, find themselves taking on the identities of the actual owners of
the RV in the sleepy little town called Happy. Year after year, Happy
has sent their happiest little kidlets off to the "Little Miss Squeezed
Pageant". Year after year, they failed to place any contestants. So the
good citizenry hired David and Steve, professional beauty pageant
coaches, to better their chances. The town knows they've hired pros 'cuz
they read about 'em in a magazine . . .
And, of course, the men are gay, which is probably why the people of
Happy think they've got the best. That's as far as any stereotypical
"gay" jokes go. "Steve" (formerly Harry) sees a bank ripe for plunder,
and a lovely bank manager named Joe (as in Josephine, played by Ally
Walker) to fall in love with. "David" (formerly Wayne) is left to teach
the seven year old kidlets how to sing and dance. He can do neither, of
course, but he has the aid of the local old maid schoolmarm, Ms.
Schaefer (Illeana Douglas). The entire town is protected by, and under
the watchful eye of, Sheriff Chappy Dent (William H. Macy) who also has
his eyes out for "love".
We spoke with William H. Macy back when Mystery Men came out and he made
a point of mentioning how happy he was with this movie. We're going to
go hunting down the clip so you can hear it for yourself. In the
meantime, if Happy Texas comes around (its initial release is so limited
you're going to have to keep your eyes peeled) do your approximation of
a two step shuffle-on-over to your local theater. You'll be remembering
Steve Zahn (first noted as the Peter Scolari lookalike last seen in Tom
Hanks' That Thing You Do) whose Wayne sets new standards for dense and
lovable.
With the new teevee season starting, I thought I'd mention that Walker
comes via the small screen's "Profiler" on NBC. Douglas is currently in
Fox's "Action". And once upon a time "Beast" Ron Perlman has a small
supporting role as the Texas Marshal from the next town up the street.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Happy Texas, he would have paid...

Somewhere nestled in the heart of the Lone Star state
is a small town where the citizens are as close to one
another as they are to their own families.  This place
(and the film's title) is Happy, Texas. It's the
typical postcard-pretty, one-sheriff town where
everyone knows each other's name.  One of the biggest
events for this charming community is the Little Miss
Fresh-Squeezed Pre-Teen Beauty Pageant.  Every year,
Happy's adorable little girls compete for the right to
represent their town in a statewide competition if
they can win.  But year after year, the little girls
aren't up to snuff.  This year, Happy will be the host
town of this year's pageant.  Knowing how well they've
performed in the past, the local community leaders
decide that they need some professional help to ensure
a good showing.  They anxiously await the arrival of
two men, who are just as well known for their success
at pageant consulting as well as their outwardly gay
lifestyle.  What they unknowingly get instead are two
on-the-run escapees from a local prison.  How does
this happen?
Prisonmates Harry (Jeremy Northam) and Wayne (Steve
Zahn) escape from their prison van and manage to steal
a beat up RV.  What they don't know is that the RV
belongs to the two previously mentioned pageant
consultants.  Though Harry and Wayne try to drive as
far away as possible, their van breaks down nearby
Happy.  Chappy Dent (William F. Macy), the town's
sheriff happens upon them saying, we've been looking
for you.'  They are escorted back into town where the
two think that they are being arrested.  Totally
clueless about what's really going on, they soon learn
that they are actually being hired and are supposed to
be a gay couple.  This strikes them as totally
shocking.  They want to escape, but Harry notes that
the town's bank would be an easy target, so they
devise a plan to stay.  Harry will befriend Jo, the
bank's president (Ally Walker), as he figures out how
to execute the heist.  Meanwhile, Wayne will take on
the responsibility of training the girls for the
pageant.
This wild setup starts off a very funny movie that
mixes elements of mistaken identities and fish out of
water.'  Zahn is extremely funny as the loony convict,
Wayne, who can barely keep himself from screaming.  To
start the little girls' training, he sings `99 Bottle
of Beers on the Wall.'  Harry's job is perhaps not as
difficult because Jo needs a friend that she can
confide in.  She takes comfort in the fact that she's
gay.  She speaks her mind and lets him explore her
house, which is his opportunity to learn the
combination of the safe.  It is not surprising that
Harry begins to fall for Jo or that Wayne begins to
fall for one of the teachers.  But because everyone
thinks that they're gay, Harry and Wayne must be very
careful not to give away their true identities.  This
situation becomes painfully funny as the two continue
to mingle with the various townsfolk and push through
with their tasks.
"Happy Texas" is a good-natured story that puts two
completely unprepared people in a situation totally
beyond their control.  They wrestle with the absurdity
of their predicament and squirm with agony.  The
result is a film that is funny and amusing and one of
the real comedic gems of the fall season.

Harry, a con man, (Northam) and Wayne Wayne Wayne, a car thief, 
(Zahn) are prisoners working on a chain gang in Texas.  They 
fight with a third prisoner and all three find themselves 
free due to a freak accident.  Harry and Wayne steal a van
belonging to a gay couple, David and Steven.  Soon they find
themselves in Happy, Texas and mistaken for the gay duo by
the local police chief (William H. Macy).  David and Steven 
specialize in little girl beauty pageants.  The citizens of 
Happy are desperate to win the Little Miss Fresh-Squeezed 
Beauty Pageant and have hired David and Steven to prepare 
their girls.  
Harry and Wayne decide to stick it out when they discover
how much money there is in the local bank.  They intend to
rob it.  The bank is run by Josephine (Ally Walker of 
Profiler fame).  Things get a little complicated as Harry 
falls for Josephine, the police chief falls for Harry, and
Wayne finds himself trapped with in a room full of little 
girls who expect him to teach them a winning number.
This is the kind of film that could easily be over the top
and not funny.  Instead, it is very funny.  It's directed
with a light touch and the performances are excellent.
Some of the best scenes are of Wayne trying to teach his
girls - who respond surprisingly well to his tactics.  Also
great is the date Harry has with the chief.  Macy gives 
his usual outstanding performance (when will he get the
lead role he deserves) and Walker is surprisingly good given
her mediocre performance on tv. There's even a small role
by Ron Perlman who always makes a movie for me.
I laughed throughout this film.  It's well structured and 
makes the premise work.  The laughs come fast and frequent 
and the plot loopholes are easily overlooked.  If you want
to see a funny film that doesn't focus on bodily fluids,
see Happy, Texas.

This is a madcap comedy that simply does not deliver. While the premise of 
two escaped convicts stealing a motor home only to find out they are supposed 
to be gay beauty pageant directors sounds promising, the outcome is dismal. 
The script isn't nearly as full of life as it might seem, and the actors do 
nothing to make their characters more vibrant and exciting. This is really a 
shame considering the cast assembled for this small production. 
Harry Sawyer (Jeremy Northam) and Wayne Wayne Wayne Jr. (Steve Zahn) portray 
the two convicts. They arrive in Happy, Texas where citizens are counting on 
them to help the town's girls win the Little Miss Fresh Squeezed beauty 
pageant. While in town, they come up with the idea to rob the bank after 
harvest checks are deposited. The bank is heavily unguarded. Joe McClintock 
(Ally Walker, formerly of NBC's The Profiler) runs the bank, and Harry 
figures the easiest way to get into the bank is to become close friends with 
Joe. Wayne gets left with the girls to teach and is aided by Ms. Schaefer 
(Illena Douglas), the girl's teacher. Thrown into the mix is Chappy (William 
H. Macy) the town's closeted gay sheriff who takes an interest in Harry. He's 
clueless to the fact that Harry is a wanted man, even though he's received 
several notices about him. 
The film is about the relationships between the characters, as each one of 
them is falling in and out of love. The love they feel for each other 
(particularly in Wayne and Ms. Schaefer's case) seems to come out of nowhere, 
and never reaches any level of believability. Macy is very funny as the gay 
sheriff, and he's the only member of the cast that seems to be having any 
fun. In probably the only truly funny scene of the movie, he takes Harry to a 
gay cowboy bar 2 1/2 hours from town. The awkwardness between the two in this 
scene is the movie's highlight. The memorable Chappy aside, there is no real 
reason to see Happy, Texas. Jeremy Northam who lately has been appearing in 
period films (The Winslow Boy, An Ideal Husband) seems uncomfortable with 
this modern comedic role. The rest of the cast does nothing with their roles, 
and the acting (and plot) get worse and worse as the movie goes on. Happy, 
Texas isn't helped by the bad makeup work and lack of good sound dubbing. 
Scenes where Wayne hits a man over the head with a dead armadillo, or runs 
out of a building with a real flaming baton appear contrived and stupid, and 
I was wondering when the movie was finally going to end. Chappy alone cannot 
save Happy, Texas, which is too lifeless, laughless, and boring for its own 
good.
