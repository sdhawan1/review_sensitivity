A simple story about innocence trying to cope with the pain and
uncertainties in an adult world and how other innocents try to help
their friend.  This gentle film is about Martin, a young boy, perhaps 8
or 9 years old, who lives with his mother.  He does not know who his
father is; his mother promises one day to tell him.
In school Martin is frequently in little troubles earning visits to the
principal's office.  And so when his mother dies, he doesn't tell
anyone for three days.  He's heard about orphanages and is not about to
take a chance.
A couple of schoolmates come calling at his home and discover the
reason he has not been to school these last several days.   In order to
keep it a secret they decide to get a coffin, or a long box, and bury
the mother.  Cross My Heart apparently refers to what each child
promises as more and more are let in on the secret because the body is
too heavy and where does one get a long box?  How about the antique
grandfather clock of a friend?
Odd behavior and undone lessons lead to Martin being told to have his
mother sign a note saying she is aware there is a school problem.  When
that is overcome (one of the girls forges the signature), he is asked
to bring his mother to school.  All kinds of subterfuges are used by
the children (such as a false bomb scare) to keep the secret from
coming out.
A sad, sensitive film. (Not to be confused with the poor 1987 film of
the same name that starred Martin Short and Annette O'Toole.)
