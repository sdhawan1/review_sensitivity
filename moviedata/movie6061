JUST THE TICKET (M).  
(United Artists/NewVision)
Director: Richard Wenk
Stars: Andy Garcia, Andie MacDowell, Richard Bradford, Andre Blank, Irene 
Worth, Elizabeth Ashley, Chris Lemmon, Ron Liebman, Abe Vigoda.
This curiously bland and unsatisfying romantic comedy is
something of a labour of love for co-stars Andy Garcia, who produced
it through his production company, and Andie MacDowell.  Garcia plays
Gary Starke, a ticket scalper who operates on the streets of New York.
His long suffering girl friend Linda (MacDowell) has grown impatient
with his lack of commitment to their relationship and his inability to
follow through in achieving his dreams.  When a chance to go to Paris
to pursue her career as a chef arises she is tempted to jump at the
opportunity.
But Gary has pinned his hope of salvation on one last
desperate roll of the dice.  The Pope is coming to New York to address
the faithful, and Gary is trying to get his hands on what will become
the hottest ticket in town.  Unfortunately, a new, better organised
and more ruthless operator is muscling in on his territory, and Gary's
chances of redemption are fading fast.
Just The Ticket is lumbered from the outset with an
implausible scenario and a pair of central characters that just aren't
likeable enough to warrant the time spent in their company.
Garcia rightfully dominates the film, and brings plenty of
energy to the screen.  Although a normally charismatic and charming
actor, he tries hard to evince some sympathy for his shallow
character.  However, his performance is too mannered, and he never
quite succeeds in winning the audience over.  MacDowell is also rather
bland in a role that gives her too few opportunities to shine.  Just
The Ticket never allows the two performers to develop a rapport, and
this lack of chemistry eventually damns the film.
Writer and first time director Richard Wenk takes a risk by
filming many crucial scenes on the crowded streets of New York.  This
technique brings a sense of energy and realism to the film, although
far too often the passers-by can be seen gazing questioningly into the
camera.
Only a very touching scene between Gary and his mentor Bennie
(Richard Bradford) brings some emotional punch to this rather
pedestrian and laboured effort.  And the only real comic touch comes
when Gary helps Linda cater a dinner for a spoiled rich matron (Irene
Worth).  It's all too little to salvage this patchy and dreary comedy.

_Just_the_Ticket_ (R) * 1/2 (out of ****)
Andy and Andie.  Execs at MGM/UA must have been falling all over
themselves with self-satisfaction when someone came up with the
ever-so-precious idea of pairing the homophonically-named Mr. Garcia and
Ms. MacDowell.  In the right vehicle, the two could possibly be as cute
as the pairing of their perfectly-matched first names. 
_Just_the_Ticket_, however, is not that vehicle.
The fact that writer-director Richard Wenk's basic story is wholly
unoriginal is the least of the film's problems.  Actually, that fact
isn't so much a problem as it is a slight annoyance.  It's another one of
those ne'er-do-well-straightens-up-for-the-love-of-a-right-woman stories,
with ticket scalper Gary Starke (Garcia) attempting one last
score--selling tickets to a sold-out papal mass in New York--before
settling into an honest living to win the affections of his fed-up true
love, aspiring chef Linda Paliski (MacDowell).  There wouldn't be a movie
without some types of complication, and the ones Wenk comes up with
aren't exactly new, either.  Among those Gary must contend with: Casino,
a hotshot newcomer moving in on his scalping turf; Linda's impending move
to France; and, as an added afterthought, Linda's _other_ boyfriend, Alex
(Chris Lemmon).
Garcia and MacDowell are likable enough performers that with those
elements in place, _Just_the_Ticket_ could have been a diverting, if
formulaic, trifle.  Yet it isn't.  While the fundamentals of his story
are not to blame, Wenk's execution certainly is.  Garcia is game, but
Wenk's listless direction saps him of all his energy; the film literally
plods to a predictable pace, alternating scenes of Gary selling tickets
with him wooing Linda.  Not helping matters is Wenk's less-than-sparkling
dialogue.  Not only do the one-liners and Gary-Linda repartee fall flat,
so do the straight-faced lines in general--a sure death knell for a film
as talky as this one.
The ineffectiveness of _Just_the_Ticket_ can simply be chalked up to the
fact that it's an astonishingly uninteresting piece of work.  There's
nothing particularly memorable about the story, the characters, or the
performances; I just about forgot each image or word as soon as it left
the screen.  The makers of _Just_the_Ticket_ undoubtedly set out to make
a light entertainment, but instead they've come up with something a bit
moreso--a film that's completely inert.

   Funny thing. I hang around Broadway most nights every
week and I've never been approached by a ticket scalper
looking to pawn off tickets to a hot show at a 100% markup. 
Why is this?  Could it be that Mayor Giuliani has locked every
one of these guys?  Maybe.  But someone in the know tells
me that I just don't look like the type who fits the
demographics.  I don't know whether to take that as a
compliment. In any case, "Just the Ticket" is about a ticket
scalper and his cuddly-lovable business partners who might
have been created by Damon Runyon (whose works inspired
"Guys and Dolls") but who instead have been constituted by
writer-director Richard Wenk.  It's also about the scalper's off-
again, on-again girl friend, who comes across more like a
wary denizen of a small town in South Carolina than a
hardened native of the Big Apple.  I suppose the main reason
to see it is to find out how well Andy Garcia can play a nice
guy albeit an irresponsible scamp, and how precious Andie
MacDowell can be as the woman who waited eight years for
him to grow up and is about to throw in the towel and go to
the Cordon Bleu cooking school in Paris.  It provides an
energetic outlet for Garcia, who competes quite favorably with
Michael J. Fox in the role of a streetwise, fast-talking New
Yorker who makes his living hustling tickets for just about any
event that requires admission passes--sporting events,
theatrical extravaganzas, even in this case a visit by the
Pope to a sold-out Yankee Stadium.
   Selling tickets at a markup is legal, provided that the sales
are made by a licensed brokerage house and the markup is
within legal limits, usually ten percent. But there is an
underground market governed by sharks who buy up blocks
of tickets from their contacts in box offices and sell these
hard-to-get passes at huge markups.  This is about the only
job that Gary Starke (Andy Garcia) feels comfortable with,
since he is a rootless New Yorker who has no particularly
interest in accumulating property and is just trying to sell
enough of his illegal product each day to get by and pay the
rent on his Spartan Chelsea digs.  That's fine by his friends,
especially the oldest of his buddies, Benny (Richard
Bradford), a one-time prizefighter who treats Gary like a son
and works as his gopher, but it is not acceptable for his
girlfriend Linda Paliski  Linda is a gourmet cook running a
catering business, a woman who has been more than fond of
Gary for years now but who has taken on a bland new
boyfriend because she cannot see herself spending her life
with a guy who never bothered to get even a social security
card.  When Gary is not dodging the police and dealing with
his new ticket-selling street competition, Casino (Andre
Blake), he is eagerly courting the conflicted Linda.  Linda
would like very much to team up with him but has decided to
call it quits because his puppy-dog eyes and charming
personality are not enough to raise a stable family.  
   Romantic comedies of this nature are as easy to sell to
some people as tickets to the SuperBowl.  Others, though,
are apprehensive about the genre, fearing yet another picture
that is mawkish and manipulative with overly sentimentalized
characters and villains who may beat up the heroes, but not
convincingly.  "Just the Ticket" is unfortunately in the latter
category: a glitzy picture featuring photographer Ellen Kuras's
sharp New York City lensing and has only one scene that
works wonderfully on the funny bone.  That one is set in the
home of a rich matron, Mrs. Haywood, who hires Linda to
cook for her party but refuses to pay her the amount agreed
upon.  When Linda and Gary trash the kitchen they display
high-spirited chemistry between them for the only time in the
movie.  They roll the roast in a basket of kitty litter, add
Tabasco sauce to the Scotch, and fling eggs about the
room--all unnoticed by the hostess who by this time is quite
inebriated. Otherwise, "Just the Ticket" is formulaic, overly
sentimental, and designed principally to make the audience
feel good as it leaves the theater.
