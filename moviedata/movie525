_I'm_Losing_You_ ** 1/2 (out of ****)
The one time the titular line is uttered in Bruce Wagner's adaptation of
his own novel of the same name is within the context of a cellular phone
conversation--as in, one is "losing" the signal on the phone.  But the
"loss" that is the main concern of this downbeat drama is the ultimate
one--loss of life.  Television producer Perry (Frank Langella) learns he
has terminal cancer at the beginning of the film, and that is indeed just
the start of it.  His struggling actor son Bertie (Andrew McCarthy) sells
life insurance policies for dying AIDS patients, and he falls in love
with a deceptively healthy-looking HIV-positive woman (Elizabeth
Perkins).  When Bertie's adoptive sister--and natural cousin--Rachel
(Rosanna Arquette) begins to learn the truth about her birth parents'
deaths, it sets her life on a morbid journey of self-discovery.  And so
on.
Well-acted and competently directed, _I'm_Losing_You_ does accomplish
what Wagner has obviously set out to do, which is create this
overwhelming and exhausting sense of melancholy.  But a few flaws in his
script keep the film from being a complete success.  Some late-inning
plot developments are forced and contrived; even less convincing is the
annoyingly inconsistent character of Rachel, who undergoes radical shifts
according to the needs of the plot.  As the film wears on, the title
could very easily be something Wagner says in reference to the audience.
