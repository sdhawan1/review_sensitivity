        THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT plays like a two-hour 
comic book, with tongue-in-cheek dialogue, caricatures instead of 
characters and more violations of the laws of physics than the Big 
Bang theory... No, I don't want hate mail from scientifically-minded 
people out there, so if you didn't like that "Big Bang theory" 
reference, just change it to "creationism" and everyone will be 
happy.
        Davis plays a conservative school teacher in a small town. 
She's got a daughter and a decent boyfriend, but there's only one 
problem. She doesn't remember anything from her life before eight 
years ago. No childhood memories, no teenage memories, nothing 
prior to 1988. She's hired private detectives to dig up dirt on her 
past, but has so far discovered nothing. Until one night, when she 
hits a deer and runs off the road. She starts having weird dreams 
and finds her mood changing every once in awhile.
        That's when Samuel L. Jackson, the lowest-rent P.I. she 
hired, finds an old postcard with her handwriting on it, announcing 
her engagement. When Jackson is bringing this information over to 
Davis' house, someone else is already at her house, trying to kill her. 
She discovers she somehow knows how to fight, and kicks the guy's 
butt while her meek boyfriend watches.
        Davis and Jackson head off the next day to track down the 
address on the postcard, eventually finding out Davis used to be an 
assassin working for a secret government organization. She slowly 
regains her old personality as more and more people try to kill her 
and she continues to send them to their graves. The transformation 
is complete when she cuts most of her hair off and dyes the rest 
platinum blonde. Then she sings "Heart of Glass."
        The conspiracy to murder her, predictably, stems from the 
same organization that she used to work for. It also involves a bomb 
somehow and Davis' kid gets trapped in a tractor-trailer. Along the 
way, Davis and Jackson outrun fire, jump out a window and land in 
an icy pond, and survive explosions and electrocution. None of it is 
believable, particularly Davis as Tank Girl.
        THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT at least has a sense of 
humor itself, Jackson's character in particular. Without Jackson, 
who is quintessentially cool no matter what movie he's in, this 
movie would have been damn near unbearable. This movie is only 
for those people who like cliched, cartoonish action movies that 
have no bearing whatsoever on the real world. There are good 
movies that fall into that category, but as far as this one goes, you 
can kiss it goodnight.

     "Life is pain.  Get used to it!" tells the formerly amnesiac
suburban mom to her frighten little girl.  Geena Davis plays mom
Samantha Caine and once paid CIA domestic assassin Charly Baltimore.
     The creative team of director Renny Harlin and his wife Davis, who
brought the world that bomb known as CUTTROAT ISLAND, this year give us
Davis as a female Steven Seagal in THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT.  Although
Davis is talented, Harlin has exactly one decent film to his name, DIE
HARD 2, and a string of ridiculous ones, including such turkeys as
NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 4 and THE ADVENTURES OF FORD FAIRLANE.
     If you like big budget, rock 'em, sock 'em action films and don't
mind repetition, then perhaps THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT will appeal to
you.
     If you saw CHAIN REACTION this year and liked it, you will get to
relive all of the explosions and fights.  Davis gets to put on a pair
of convenient ice skates to outrun a speeding car, but other than that,
you've seen all of the stunts before.  Harlin does manage to spend all
of his backers' money in one explosion after another proving that his
profligate excesses are rarely rivaled.  Oh well, the dream of every
producer is that escapism like this will sell lots of tickets and
popcorn.
     Mild mannered Samantha has been trying for eight years to find out
who she is and who is her daughter Caitlin's (Yvonne Zima) father.
Having run out of funds to hire real detectives, Samantha scrapes the
bottom of the barrel employing Mitch Henessey (Samuel L. Jackson), who
is a combination PI and scam artist.
     One day she is in a car accident that starts her transformation
back into a paid killer for the government.  Henessey is shocked by her
metamorphosis, especially the degeneration of her language, saying,
"Now, you go into a bar, and the sailors start running out."
     After innumerable explosions, fistfights, gun fights, and bloody
scenes straight out of NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, Harlin's action machine
concludes in Niagara Falls where he gets to blown up a bridge and the
obligatory tanker truck.  Whew.
     Character development along the way consists of lots of stick
figure CIA agents and bad guys working together to screw the taxpayers
out of their money.  Patrick Malahide plays CIA operative Perkins.  Of
course, the President (G. D. Spradlin) has dirty hands too.  Spradlin
has little acting range, but his demeanor is so slimy that he is quite
effective.  My favorite role of his was as the corrupt Senator Pat
Geary in THE GODFATHER: PART II.
     Unless you need an action fix, there are only two reasons to see
THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT.  First, there is good chemistry between Davis
and Jackson, who both have a lot of fun making the picture.  Second,
the dialog by Shane Black has several funny lines.  My favorite is when
Henessey explains on Larry King Live that, "I am always frank and
earnest with women.  In Chicago I'm Frank, and in New York I'm Ernest."
Most of the humorous lines are unprintable forms of double-entendre.
     THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT runs a full 2:00.  By half way through, I
got tired of seeing yet another blast and wished editor William
Goldenberg had exercised more control.  The film is rated R for
excessive violence too often reminiscent of a horror flick and constant
bad language used mainly to shock.  The film has no sex or nudity.
Teenagers used to a diet of heavy movie violence will probably like the
film, but I don't see why anyone would bother.  THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT
gets a thumbs down from me and a * 1/2.
Opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's.

     The much-publicized ballyhoo over THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT relates
largely to the $4 million paid for Shane Black's script.  The question
everyone is asking is, was it worth it?
     Well, yes and no.  Opening weekend is sure to bring in moviegoers
in droves enthralled by the sight of Geena Davis with a blonde dye-job,
but more discriminating viewers will probably be put-off by the plot
holes, inconsistencies, and downright silliness of the film.  I mean,
how many times *can* you outrun an explosion in one film, anyway?
     THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT starts with one hell of an idea -- suburban
schoolteacher Samantha (Davis) has had amnesia for eight years, and when
an escaped convict tries to kill her after he sees her on television,
the truth of her past is slowly revealed.  Along with private eye Mitch
(Samuel L. Jackson), Samantha discovers the reality of her life -- she
is a cold-blooded assassin in the employ of the CIA under deep cover, by
the name of Charly.
     Things go from bad to worse when everyone apparently wants the
resurfaced and now out-of-date Charly out of the picture, and it becomes
a game of cat and mouse with Charly's new goal becoming... well, we
never really figure that out, but it involves killing a lot of people,
and blowing up a lot of stuff.
     Jackson is hilarious here in another PULP-y Jules-esque comic
relief role, and Davis has the action-star makings of another Sigourney
Weaver.  And while the film on the whole is one exciting slam-bang
actioner (directed by slam-bang director and Mr. Geena Davis, Renny
Harlin), it's the glaring bits of incongruity that constantly bother the
viewer.  The conveniently placed props -- thin ice where it's needed,
always a gun handy, kerosene in a child's doll (I still haven't figured
that one out) -- and Harlin's insistence in pointing these out well in
advance so we won't be scratching our heads when they inevitably enter
the picture -- all of this gives the movie the feeling of a
methodically-planned operation, executed with the skill of... well, a
killer like Charly.
     THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT has other problems, most notably a poor
editing job, needed explanatory sequences obviously excised from the
film, and a disconcerting similarity of Charly at the end of the film to
MacGyver, but what's the point of worrying?  In the end, you're likely
to remember little but a lot of guns, explosions, and Geena's lovely
hair.

The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996) ** out of ***** - Cast: Geena Davis, Samuel
L. Jackson, David Morse, G.D. Spradlin. Written by: Shane Black. Directed
by: Renny Harlin. Running Time: 120 minutes.
"The Long Kiss Goodnight" is yet another failure from director Renny Harlin,
who's career once showed promise, peaked with "Die Hard 2", and has gone
downhill steadily ever since. He, along with his wife Geena Davis, deliver
another big budget waste of time without a shread of intelligence (see also:
"Cutthroat Island").
Geena Davis is absolutely wrong for the role of a former ruthless government
assassin who was the victim of a hit herself and suffered amnesia as a
result. She now believes that she's a school teacher with a normal life,
complete with a daughter and a boyfriend. The daughter is actually hers, as
she was two months pregnant when she was attacked. This all changes one
night when she hits a deer on the highway (in just about the most realistic
"car hitting a deer" scene I've ever witnessed). After the accident (which
one day it seems she'll be hospitalized for a long time, then she's
basically out the next day) she starts to recall things from her former
life.
She enlists the aid of a shady private detective (Jackson, in a funny
performance) after some of her old personal belongings are found. The two
set out to find out her true identity, but the "bad guys" find out she's
still alive and soon are in pursuit.
Before I address all the ridiculousness of the film, I will point out the
things I did like. Samuel L. Jackson gives another good performance and
should be proud of his work in the film. The action scenes are well-staged
(however completely implausible). And deep down, the story had potential.
However, there is not enough good here to overlook the bad.
It takes Davis' character about an hour to realize who she is, something
which the audience knew before the film even began just by seeing the
preview. I don't like knowing more than the characters in the film and then
have to watch them figure it out. That's why I can't ever watch TVs Columbo.
Then, in the first hour, there's all this "extra dialog", like this was a
Tarantino movie or something. At one point while Jackson and Davis are
driving somewhere, he notices an attractive woman and makes it known that he
finds her attractive. The two of them then have a discussion about men and
why they look at women and etc. etc. There's a lot of that in the first
hour, and it's out of place.
During the final scenes, they use a cliche that's SO overused I can't even
believe its still allowed to be used. After the bad guys capture Davis, who
is now completely her assassin persona, the actually devise some sort of
ridiculous scheme to kill her instead of just putting a bullet in her head.
In true James Bond fashion they lock her in a freezer so she'll eventually
freeze to death. Now on top of that, she actually says to the main bad guy,
"Since I'm going to die anyway, why not tell me the entire plan." And then
he does! And then she naturally escapes! Come ON! And on top of THAT, it
turns out that this whole thing is about the CIA being responsible for all
the terrorist attacks here in the United States since the end of the cold
war, just to get a budget increase! Now I know the government is corrupt,
even downright evil at times, but COME ON! This is ridiculous! News like
this would shut down the government and cause revolts, and in the end its
just simply another news story.
There are other little "picky" details I had a problem with. For example,
its mentioned that Davis' accident happened 8 years ago, in 1992. So, this
is taking place in the year 2000? Is that right? Hmmm. Also, actor David
Morse is AGAIN wasted in a nothing role. When will someone realize this man
is talented and give him a major role? I mean besides Sean Penn? Anyway,
it's just a shame that given the money and supposed talent involved here
that nothing more than a silly little action film came out. [R]

     Great premise, terrible execution.  How many times have I written 
that line this year?  It was true of too many summer releases, and 
apparently nothing has changed with the turning of seasons.  In the case 
of THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT, it's especially frustrating, though, because 
the basic idea is so intriguing -- the perfect background for a top-
notch noir thriller.  Unfortunately, director Renny Harlin (DIE HARD 2, 
CLIFFHANGER) wasn't at all interested in making a tightly-paced, 
character-driven movie.  What we get instead is exactly what we've come 
to expect from him -- lots of gunshots, explosions, and general mayhem.  
When the smoke finally clears for the final credits, we may have had a 
tolerably good time, but there's no lingering satisfaction.
     The premise involves that age-old plot staple of soap operas:  
amnesia.  Samantha Caine (Geena Davis) is the perfect mom.  A teacher at 
a suburban Pittsburgh elementary school, she doesn't allow cursing 
around the house and dotes on her 8 year old daughter, Caitlin (Yvonne 
Zima).  Samantha doesn't have much of a past, however.  She was found on 
a New Jersey beach eight years ago, and, because of a condition the 
doctors call "focal retrograde amnesia", she can't remember anything 
before that.  But lacking a personal history doesn't really bother her 
because her present is so pleasant.  She has almost given up on 
discovering her former identity -- almost, but not quite.  Then Mitch 
Henessey (Samuel L. Jackson), the latest in a long line of private 
investigators she has hired, finds a possible clue.  At the same time, 
Sam is involved in a car wreck, and, as the result of a head injury, her 
past personae -- a government assassin named Charly Baltimore -- begins 
to resurface. 
     It would have been fun watching Sam struggle with the emotional and 
moral consequences of uncovering a sordid past, but, what we get instead 
is a gallery of villains (Craig Bierko, David Morse, Patrick Malahide) 
using guns, bombs, and hand grenades to eliminate her.  (True to form 
for a 1996 film, some of the bad guys are government agents.)  She 
shifts effortlessly from Sam to Charly as circumstances demand, never 
paying a psychological penalty.  Maybe I was expecting a little too much 
from an action film, but the Hitchcockian ideas are so juicy that they 
deserve deeper exploration.
     The action, unfortunately, is distressingly routine.  There are 
some nifty sequences, such as when Mitch gets blown out of a window or 
when Sam does a little surfing on top of an out-of-control, overturned 
tanker truck.  Alas, these are nothing more than visual candy.  Missing 
is the freshness that marked that action sequences in Harlin's 
directorial debut, DIE HARD 2.  
     Apparently, Harlin did A LONG KISS GOODNIGHT to escape the ugly 
shadow of CUTTHROAT ISLAND, one of the biggest duds of last year.  
(Imagine anyone thinking they could make money with Matthew Modine as an 
action hero!)  His wife, Geena Davis, is again the lead, but for this 
role she has beefed up a la Sigourney Weaver (ALIENS) and Linda Hamilton 
(TERMINATOR 2).  Davis is a good enough actress to carry off the dual 
identity, although Charly seems a lot like a humorless cross between LA 
FEMME NIKITA and a female James Bond.  Sam is more appealing, which is 
obviously the intention.  Everything possible is done to delineate the 
differences between Sam and Charly.  We're supposed to root for Charly, 
the ruthless killer, knowing that Sam is buried somewhere in her 
personality.  At least the end is about reconciling these disparate 
identities.
     The real reason to see A LONG KISS GOODNIGHT, however, is Samuel L. 
Jackson, who steals the movie out from under Davis.  Jackson is 
magnificent, and I'm going to recommend the film largely on the basis of 
his turn as Mitch.  I wasn't wild about A LONG KISS GOODNIGHT as a 
whole, but this is the kind of delightful performance that deserves to 
be seen.  Jackson adds more than a dash of humor to the action mix, 
throwing out one-liners guaranteed to send audiences into paroxysms of 
laughter (his line about people trying to get out of New Jersey brought 
down the house, but that may have something to do with where I saw the 
movie).  Whenever Jackson was on screen, I forgot about the film's 
shortcomings and appreciated what he was doing with Mitch.
     Ultimately, I suppose an individual's enjoyment of A LONG KISS 
GOODNIGHT will be greatly affected by expectations.  If you're searching 
for a slick-looking, mindless, Bond-derived action film with a buff 
female hero, this should fit the bill nicely.  But if the premise leads 
you to expect something a little more interesting -- possibly even a 
change of pace for Harlin -- A LONG KISS GOODNIGHT will disappoint.  
Regardless of your viewpoint, however, keep your eyes on Jackson, and 
you'll understand how I can generate some enthusiasm for this otherwise 
uneven, overblown explosions extravaganza.

The Long Kiss Goodnight (R) *** (out of ****)
        Meryl Streep tried it and failed.  Even Pamela Anderson Lee made an
attempt but fell flat on her well-bared assets.  However, Geena Davis could
very well become the first bankable American female action star with The
Long Kiss Goodnight, a preposterous but incredibly fun action thriller
directed by her husband, Renny Harlin.
        Davis plays Samantha Caine, a mousy suburban school teacher and
mother whose memories only go back eight years.  With the help of ethically
questionable private detective Mitch Hennessey (Samuel L. Jackson), she
slowly remembers--and reclaims--her past as Charly Baltimore, tough-as-nails
CIA operative.  Needless to say, with the reappearance of Samantha/Charly
comes the appearance of an assortment of no-goodniks out to erase more than
her memory.
        Shane Black netted a cool $4 mil for his script; I'm not so sure if
his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag, but for what it's
worth, it delivers the goods.  Like Black's previous work, such as Lethal
Weapon and The Last Boy Scout, the script juggles some impressive action
scenes with funny, quirky dialogue.  The humor especially works well in this
case, for the story is so preposterous that the laughs help to keep things
from taking things too seriously.  But there's no argument that the more
unbelievable sequences are original and entertaining as hell: who can resist
the sight of Davis tossing her daughter from a hole in her house into the
nearby treehouse or chasing after a car... while ice skating?
        Jackson and Davis make a good team.  Jackson is funny as ever as
ever; in fact, his spirited line deliveries, especially when he first
appears, are more than reminiscent of his work as Jules in Pulp Fiction.  As
good as he is, the one who should benefit the most from this project is
Davis, who shows much promise as an action heroine.  What makes her so
effective and why she should succeed where Streep and Lee failed is that she
doesn't take herself too seriously.  She is obviously in on the joke, slyly
taking jabs at herself and at the situation.  This is not to say that she
doesn't need work--sometimes she lays on the "toughness" a bit too thick and
comes off too much as a caricature.  But should the public embrace the film
and, in turn, the notion of a kick-ass female, Davis could have found her
special niche.
        It seems as if Davis and Harlin's first collaboration, the middling
pirate epic Cutthroat Island, was just a dress rehearsal (albeit a very
costly one) for Long Kiss, in which the wife-husband team hit their action
stride.  Anyone simply looking for a fun, escapist entertainment that
requires little-to-no thinking will find this film to be a more-than-welcome
Kiss.

        Thirty years ago, if you were told that women would become beat
policemen, serial killers, or spies, chances are you seriously doubted
the first two suggestions, but not the third, after all the exploits  of
Mata Hari had been indoctrinated into the beliefs of the American male.
While the last thirty years has seen women become an integral part of
police departments everywhere and an occasional woman serial killer has
surfaced, the female spy has only taken a supplementary role in the
cinema. 
        In The Long Kiss Goodnight ( http://www.longkiss.com/ ), Geena Davis,
under the direction of her husband Renny Harlin, has broken, not only
the screen image "sweetness" that she has been saddled with since her
television days on "Buffalo Bill," and continued with "A League of Their
Own" and "Speechless," but she has given us a credible female spy/action
figure with her characterization of "Charly Baltimore, a former CIA
agent, who everyone thought had been killed, but who was really living
the life of her undercover character, Samantha Caine.
        Of course, she's not the first female to play a spy or an action
figure, Cynthia Rothrock tried, and Anne Parilla, in La Femme Nikita,
succeeded, but while it's one thing to succeed in France, one's not
really successful until the movie's made in Hollywood--and please don't
even think about Bridget Fonda's remake of Nikita, Point of No Return,
being successful because it lacked Parilla's conviction, however
misguided.
        As Geena Davis morph's into the character of Charly Baltimore, she
takes on a toughness that comes from living on the edge with glee.  As
her past creeps upon her, and her lurid past becomes an exciting
present, a spark returns to her life that Samantha Caine, schoolteacher,
had unknowingly suppressed.  For me the image of Charly, rolling a shot
glass of booze over her cheek until it's wrapped around her lips, speaks
more of her character than the hundreds of bullets she shoots from the
guns that abound every other frame of this action packed adventure.
        The web pages for The Long Kiss Goodnight are exceptional in their
delivery of behind the screens interviews from not only Geena Davis (
http://www.longkiss.com/Geena/gnacontnt.html ), but also Samuel L.
Jackson ( http://www.longkiss.com/Sam/samcontnt.html ).  Whole scenes of
dialogue are also available, with even storyboards of crucial ones such
as the scene where Charly is being tortured by being immersed underwater
( http://www.longkiss.com/Wheel.sc/wheelscript.html )
        If you long for a credible action movie and can accept that the lead
actor is a woman, then The Long Kiss Goodnight is just the movie for
you.

The Long Kiss Goodnight
Directed by Geena Davis' husband.  Starring Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson.
Cameo by Larry King. Reviewed by Michael A. Turton.  Dissed by everybody.
In the tradition of _Attack of the Killer Tomatoes_, sailing the course set
by _Cutthroat Island_, comes _The Long Kiss Goodnight_, a movie so bad it is
absolutely enjoyable. Laugh yourself silly over this disaster which scores a
perfect "0" in every category -- plot, acting, directing, editing, you name
it, all bad.  Of course, if you take movies at all seriously, you may not
like this bomb.
The idea (I won't use the word 'story') behind TLKG is that a plain
schoolteacher and single mother named Samantha Caine, who is suffering from
amnesia, is really a government assassin who is suffering an episode of
madness, hiding inside a fake identity, apparently to escape the burdens of
killing.  A (hugely predictable) car accident and a smack on the head bring
forth the old identity.  As Samantha Caine goes in search of her past in the
company of a private detective she has employed, Mitch (Samuel L. Jackson)
she happens to resurface just when her (unnamed) old agency is staging a fake
terrorist attack on the town of Niagara Falls (code named Operation
Honeymoon) to drum up support for funding in Congress.        The result is a
blizzard of ever more impossible and incredible events until the mind reaches
a state wherein the critical faculty ceases to operate in a serious mode and
laughter is the only possible response.
How to sum up TLKG in a single sentence? Suffice to say: in what other flick
can you hear the phrase "blithering idiot" uttered with complete earnestness?
I can't say when the last time was I enjoyed a movie so much.  There were
places where I laughed myself to tears.
Foremost among the movie's galaxy of failure is the acting.  Except for a
strong performance from the newcomer playing the urbanely psychotic Timothy
and Samuel L. Jackson, whose emotional outbursts seem like the flailing of a
man drowning in quicksand, everyone in TLKG has clearly studied at the Wooden
Indian Academy of Self-Expression.  The smirking, leaden delivery of Geena
Davis would drive Trek's Data mad with envy.  The professor who trained her
is a gem of bad acting working with an awful script, a cornucopia of pompous
nonsense poured out at lightspeed.
Plot and script meanwhile are a miracle of self-conscious silliness.  Bad
line follows bad line in orderly procession as though saved up for the
occasion (although here and there a good line pops out like a struggling hand
poking through the surface of a swamp).  The plot is a crystalline derivative
of everything that is objectionable about Hollywood, including the obligatory
self-sacrificing former jailbird who sustains serious injury in saving Our
Hero, the daughter who begs mom not to give up, the urbane psycho, the
nervous government officials in a rogue agency, the nice but stupid boyfriend
as well as the mandatory guns with endless ammo and characters who perform
superhuman feats of strength with various parts of the body out of
commission. Of course, it takes place at Christmas.  Of course nobody dies at
the end and all families are reconstituted.  Of course there is only one
black man, who is of course a former jailbird and divorced.  Being a
Minority, he of course is endowed with Primitive Wisdom which enables
Samantha to recognize her True self.
As if cliches weren't bad enough, implausibilities and continuity failures
abound.  How does a woman with no past get hired as a schoolteacher? What
happened to the man who was trapped in the burning car when Samantha has her
accident? Why do the government agents choose to make a hit on Samantha by
using automatic weapons in the middle of a crowded train station?  How did
Samantha and Mitch get out of the phone company after taking everyone there
hostage? Where are they at the end?  I could go on in this vein, but I'm sure
the reader gets the picture.
The directing and editing are in no way inferior to the acting, plot and
script.  Characters constantly undergo dimensional shift as they reposition
themselves in badly-edited shots.  Some shots are visually incomprehensible,
especially the scene of Samantha lying in the snow with the dead deer.        The
action in this movie must be seen to not be believed. My personal favorite:
while sitting in a chair, Mitch is blown out of a second-story window in an
explosion, blown through a neon sign, lands in a tree, falls into a snowbank,
and gets up immediately to throw a knife through an attacker's throat.        All
in a day's work for our hero.
There's no question that this could have been a great movie.  Under another
director's tutelage Davis might actually have been able to pull off an action
hero, but she lacks real bite.        Her sluttishness is an obvious act, her
menace comes off as mere irritation.  The potentially compelling conflict
between her submerged identity and her assumed one could have been
interesting, but comes off as cliched.        The fake terrorist attack was a
tactic contemplated to undermine Castro in the '60s, but there is no link
here to real government policies, so the government agents are purely stick
figures.  One yearns for the energy and dark genius of a Tim Burton.
The most fascinating question is: what idiot funded this clunker?  I suppose
"profound lack of judgement" must have become a job requirement for suits

PLOT:
Woman with amnesia is living the life of a simple schoolteacher & doting
mother when her memory suddenly jogs up her past as a professional assassin
for the US government. Along with the help of a two-bit, wise-cracking
gumshoe, she hits the road to discover her true identity.
CRITIQUE:
Fun, unique action-thriller finally offers us an interesting female hero who
alongside the humorous verbal quips from Sam Jackson, keep the film moving
at an entertaining pace, despite a couple of small lulls here and there. I
will admit to being biased in this case, since I do generally enjoy action
films that are set during Christmas time, but this film should be fun for
others as well, since it does offer a cool heroine, some great action
sequences, a few over-the-top moments and Sam Jackson firing off jokes left
and right. It's obvious that writer Shane Black drew his inspiration from
the French classic LA FEMME NIKITA, which is a much deeper film with less
humor, but for what this one is, it does okay. Don't expect the greatest
action film of all-time, since the movie does seem to plod on at some
points, but all in all, it is a fun time at the movies. I especially fell in
love with the cooler than cool Casino hotel room that they bunked down in
while in Atlantic City. Now THAT'S a room! Great dialogue, much funniness by
the way of Jackson's character, some decent action scenes, a good premise,
and definitely NOT a film to be taken seriously. If you're looking for
mindless fun...look no further than this movie!
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Writer Shane Black collected $4M for this script. In the first draft of his
screenplay, Mitch, the character played by Sam Jackson, died of his wounds.
One of my favorite lines in this film came from a Christmas well-wisher who
toasted folks along the lines of "This year, I am thankful that I do not
drink, smoke or curse....", which he quickly followed up with, "Shit, I DO
smoke and drink!".
Not sure if this was meant as an inside joke to one of Sam Jackson's most
popular character roles (Jules from PULP FICTION), but at one point in this
movie, Sam stands there with a gun at and says "I am one bad mutherf**cker".
A nod to one of Geena Davis' most popular roles (Thelma from THELMA &
LOUISE) came in the form of a scene featuring Davis riding a convertible
with sunglasses.
The two main characters in this film drink Finlandia Vodka. Director Renny
Harlin is from Finland.
Director Renny Harlin (Birth name: Lauri Mauritz Harjola) and actress Geena
Davis (Birth name: Virginia Elizabeth Davis) were a married couple while
making this movie. They separated in 1997.
Sam Jackson was nominated for a 1997 Image award for Outstanding Lead Actor
in a Motion Picture for his role in this film.
This film represented actor Craig Bierko's first major movie role. He
recently starred in THE 13TH FLOOR (6.5/10), and is apparently dating
actress Janeane Garofalo.

     It is easy for me to understand the reasoning which pegged Shane
Black's script for THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT as worth $4 million, because it
includes all the elements which tend to make studio executives soil
themselves in anticipation.  A high concept premise, plenty of gratuitous
violence, a little T&A, buddies exchanging profane one-liners, really big
explosions...these are the stuff of blockbusters, my friends.  They are
also the stuff of inane, incoherent garbage, unlikely to gain any style
points with inane, incoherent garbagemeister Renny Harlin (CUTTHROAT
ISLAND) at the helm.  The thing is that THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT is a
difficult film to dismiss, because it is just as often entertaining as it
is actively infuriating.  As inane, incoherent garbage goes, it's really
not that bad.
     Geena Davis stars as Samantha Caine, a small town Pennsylvania
schoolteacher with a large hole in her life.  Eight years earlier she woke
up on a beach pregnant and with no recollection of her previous life, and
has since become a simple working mother while detectives failed to
provide any clues to her identity.  But Mitch Henessey (Samuel L. Jackson)
manages to succeed where others did not, and finds names which may help
fill in the blanks.  It turns out that Samantha might not like what she
finds, as she learns that she was a government-trained assassin named
Charley Baltimore, and that she has plenty of enemies who are not at all
pleased to find her alive.  She also has friends, but the trick is
figuring out who they are before someone erases her memory for good.
     Harlin tried to turn wife Geena Davis into an action heroine in
CUTTHROAT ISLAND, and the result was the biggest financial disaster in the
history of the cinema.  Apparently that was not enough to shake his
conviction that Davis had the right stuff, and THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT
sort of proves him right.  There is something strangely satisfying about
watching Davis turn into a killing machine, while partner Jackson (as the
down-on-his-luck gumshoe who usually does the ass-kicking in such films)
generally looks on ineffectually.  It's primitive role-reversal stuff, but
it works; it's a great bit of business when hausfrau Samantha takes a pie
she has just baked in a Pyrex dish and uses it to beat in the head of an
assailant.  Jackson also gets a handful of simplistic but very funny gag
lines, and even a line in which he makes fun of making up gag lines.  It
would be over-estimating the subtlety of THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT to refer
to it as a satire, but its bending of conventions often works quite well.
     At other times, it is about as conventional as action film-making
gets, and distressingly brutal.  There is a sequence early in the film
involving a deer hit by a car which will raise plenty of hackles, and it
provides an appropriate prelude to numerous scenes of torture, disturbing
fantasy/dream sequences and plenty of good old-fashioned shootings and
stabbings.  Harlin and Black also play unfair with the tired device of a
child in distress, and manage to play plenty of bodily functions for gags
along the way.  Into the middle of this rather crude mess they then drop
half-hearted attempts at character development, with Davis' discovery
resulting in a split personality and Jackson trying to redeem himself for
something or other.  For four million bucks, I suppose Shane Black figured
he might as well throw in the kitchen sink.
     Yet I can't deny that THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT made me laugh, and that
there was never a time when I was bored.  Yes, villains appear and
disappear with scarcely a thought to explaining who they are or why they
matter.  Yes, it is overloaded and overblown in a way which can make
anyone who cares about good movies cringe.  Yes, it is sometimes becomes
so violent as to be off-putting.  THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT is an
exploitation film, but it is an exploitation film with a sense of its own
absurdity.  You may not care at all about Mitch Henessey as a person, but
you will probably find yourself enjoying his exasperated delivery of
Black's crude humor; you may not really believe Charley Baltimore _is_ a
person, but you might still find her exploits a guilty pleasure.  THE LONG
KISS GOODNIGHT is an easy film to like, and equally easy to hate.  What
else can you say when you walk away from an inane, incoherent piece of
garbage with a smile on your face?

    THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT is my favorite bad movie of the year, even
better than BARB WIRE, DIABOLIQUE, or, dare I say the name?, MARY
REILLY.  Sure, it's as fowl as any turkey of times past, but this
mega-million dollar Renny Harlin-Geena Davis-Shane Black bomb is never
off-putting.  That is to say, it's awful fun.  The major misstep is the
casting of Mrs. Renny Harlin as an amnesiac house- wife who awakens one
day to discover that she's really a former anti-assassin for the U.S.
Government.  Geena Davis has the pumped- up physique and, yes, the same
wide-eyed exuberance that passed for characterization in CUTTHROAT
ISLAND.  What's missing, though, is the *steel* behind the sheen.  You
just don't believe that she wants to kick your ass.  (Memo to Mr.
Harlin:  in the interest of preserving not one but two careers, please
stop attempting to cast your wife as an action hero.  She's about as
well-suited to that role as Demi Moore is at playing strippers.  Just.
don't. do it.)
     Compounding the confounding is a story structure that reveals her
secret at the very beginning of the movie, I mean RIGHT THERE IN THE
OPENING CREDITS.  (Arrive late?  No problem!  The filmmakers also
include a scene or two or three of the bad guys getting ready to get
Geena.) This "tipping of the hand" is a 100-proof mystery- killer-- the
audience ends up knowing too much too soon and that knowledge drains the
suspense right out of the story.  The rest of the movie is reduced to
red-stained catch-up, with Harlin trying his hardest to generate the
tension that should've been there from the beginning.  Instead of
intrigue we get pumped-up peril, very little of which excites the way it
should:  Mommy ambushed at home, Mommy sprayed with bullets in a bus
station, Mommy hitting a deer and wrecking the car on her way home from
a Christmas party.  (Has anyone figured out the purpose of that last
scene?  Other than the guilty pleasure of seeing someone snap Bambi's
neck?)
     Thank God for Samuel L. Jackson.  His low-rent private dick is the
perfect foil to Le Femme Nondescript.  In addition to adding some much-
needed humanity to the movie, he's the most colorful character in the
cast.  Tearing into writer Shane Black's delicious dialogue, Jackson
walks away with nearly every scene, except when upstaged by Brian Cox
(CHAIN REACTION, THE GLIMMER MAN).  The original Hannibal Lecter (look
it up) submits a priceless monologue about a dog and where it likes to
lick itself.  (BTW, has anyone transcribed that exchange?  Please
e-mail, if so.) The Brit is gone before long, but Jackson is on hand for
the duration and he's so fun to watch, even when reduced to little more
than a spectator to the various explosive set-pieces that get
progressively bigger, bolder, and brain-dead.  After all, this *is* a
movie by Renny Harlin, the guy who directed CLIFFHANGER and DIE HARD 2,
which means you can expect a basement explosion that's pretty cool and
one whammy of a tanker- truck wreck, with Davis hanging-ten a la Arnold
in TERMINATOR 2.  The final fireball is the best and almost beats the
pyrotechnics in INDEPEDENCE DAY.  Not bad for a bad movie.
