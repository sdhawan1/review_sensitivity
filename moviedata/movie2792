     "When I grow up and get married, I'm going to live alone," Kevin
McCallister decides after being alternately ignored and ridiculed by a
household full of his siblings and cousins.  Rebelliously, he wishes
he'd never see his family again and that he'd be home alone.  As the
old adage goes, be careful what you wish for lest you get it and, by
implication, loathe it.  Kevin will soon be alone, very alone, but he
will end up loving it.  Even when disaster looms eminent, he will rise
to the occasion, relishing the opportunity to utilize simple household
items to defend his home.
     In 1990, MRS. DOUBTFIRE's director Chris Columbus, brought out the
first in the extremely popular HOME ALONE series.  Starring Macaulay
Culkin in his first big role, the movie was a hit for its slapstick
humor as well as the age-old theme of a kid who bests the grown-ups.
     (The problem with your kids' watching movie series is that it is
not always easy to start them with the first episode.  Although we were
able to show our son, Jeffrey, the Bond and the STAR WARS series in
order, he got out of sequence on HOME ALONE, seeing the first one
last.)
     Two sets of McCallister families head to Paris for their big trip.
In one of the movie's best scenes Kevin's parents, while aloft, figure
that they forgot something, but can't determine what it could it be -
perhaps they left the garage door open says the dad (John Heard).
We've all had that experience but few have had the dilemma facing them,
they forgot a child - Kevin (Culkin).  It was a simple matter of a bad
headcount on the airport shuttle and, what with the commotion of
leaving, etc., they didn't notice Kevin's absence.
     Rather than panicking, as his parents do when they realize what
has happened, Kevin decides he is in hog heaven.  He starts doing all
of those things that under normal circumstances he would be absolutely
forbidden to do.  Watching "rubbish" on TV while feasting on mountains
of ice cream is but one of his many sinful pleasures.
     Culkin displays a wide range of acting emotions.  One minute he's
a hellion, and the next he's an angel.  He is especially cute hamming
it up in front of the mirror.  Looking brave, wise, and yet vulnerable,
Culkin is perfect for the role.  Imaginative, Kevin turns on all the
lights, cranks up the stereo, and moves cardboard cutouts on his
electric train to make his house look chockfull of adults.
     Using relentlessly upbeat Christmas music by STAR WARS's John
Williams, the movie contrasts the joyous holiday season with the less
than ideal situation in which Kevin and his parents find themselves.
     In the midst of the comedy is a well-acted subplot of an old man
who no longer talks to his grown son because they lost their tempers at
each other years ago.  A sagacious Kevin gives him advice in a touching
scene in church.
     Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, playing two bumbling burglars, set
their sights on robbing the McCallister house.  Although the two
robbers are central to the storyline, the movie is at its best when
they are nowhere to be seen.  They cause the sweet, original movie to
dissolve into cheap slapstick that you've seen many times before.
     Kevin defends his home from them with everything from blowtorches
to carefully laid nails.  Mainly the two robbers fall one minute and
get knocked on the head the next, ad nauseam.  A little of Stern and
Pesci goes a long way, and HOME ALONE has them in almost every scene in
the last half of the movie. Too bad Kevin's adversaries had to be so
terminally stupid - the rest of the picture isn't.
     HOME ALONE runs 1:45.  It is rated PG for comic violence and would
be fine for most kids.
     My son Jeffrey, age 9, gave the movie ***.  Of the three HOME
ALONE episodes, he ranked them HOME ALONE 3, HOME ALONE and then HOME
ALONE 2.

**1/2 (out of 4 = OK)
1990, PG, 103 minutes [1 hour, 43 minutes]
[comedy]
starring: Macauly Culkin (Kevin MaCallister), Catherine O'Hara (Mrs.
MaCallister), Joe Pesci (Harry), Daniel Stern (Marv), written and produced by
John Hughes, directed by Chris Columbus.
"Home Alone" is probably every child's fantasy; defending his/her home and
family against bad guys by using the same techniques they see on their
favorite cartoon show. However, when we consider the fact the film is
centered around the 10-minute-long, slapstick-laced climax, we realize this
isn't intelligent film-making, but at least it's enjoyable to watch.
Macauly Culkin stars as eight-year-old Kevin MaCallister, who is currently
sharing his huge suburban Chicago house with 14 other family members. They
are all getting ready for their Christmas vacation in Paris, and the place is
insane with children and eccentric adults running all over the place. Since
Kevin is the smallest, he is of course the one always being picked on and
ignored by everyone, which eventually leads him to attack his brother during
dinner and then get sent to sleep in the attic as punishment. These opening
scenes are told in a lighthearted manner that somehow seem completely
plausible. It has a funny sense of realism to it, somewhat sit-com-esque, yet
it doesn't rely on cliches.
Cliches are the backbone of comedy and without them Hollywood might actually
have to grown a brain and think of other ways to be funny and tell stories.
Through a series of events that are both believable but cliche, Kevin winds
up being left home alone while the rest of the family flies to France in a
mad panic.
Children have active imaginations, they can think of things adults would
consider crazy, but in Hollywood they're considered genius. Most of the film
tells the story of what would happen when you leave an eight-year-old boy
alone in a big, rich house almost as if he was exploring it for the first
time. We see Kevin do things he's not supposed to do such as watch R-rated
movies, eat junk food, look through his brother's personal belongings, sleep
in his parents' bed, shave, do laundry, go shopping, etc. Then again, some of
his antics are quite funny, such as sledding down his living room stairs and
out the front door, or when he talks to strangers, and the many scenes
involving his phobias.
But the entire premise of the film revolves around Kevin battling the
bumbling burglars Harry and Marv (Pesci, Stern). This is why the film could
be labeled as a "cartoon," because the idea of a small child outsmarting
idiot crooks is nothing new, yet it does not seem trite at the time. Harry
and Marv seem believable because they don't stand out compared to the rest of
the film. Just considering Pesci as the character he plays is funny, as he
has played so many vicious gangsters and now he is being foiled and tortured
by a little kid.
Harry and Marv constantly keep an eye on Kevin's house, and when they
realize he's home alone, they plan to rob it anyway. But Kevin is clever and
plants booby traps that could actually work, but only with the help of a
multi-million dollar production crew. Some of his traps include: glue,
feathers, tar, nails, matchbox cars, lots of ice, smashed ornaments, cut
ropes, and a perfectly edited gangster movie.
For the most part, the slapstick scenes paid off for me, but depending on
your own cynicism it might be more distracting. The problem is this only
works once, so in retrospect in seems rather stupid and silly, and that is
why the film is simply OK instead of good.
Still, "Home Alone" is a fair family-oriented comedy with a lot of Christmas
nostalgia to it. It doesn't try to be something it's not, but it should have
tried harder to be itself.

     I am a little leery of John Hughes films ... Hughes' movies seem
to be exclusively devoted to the topic of comfortable-middle-class-
white-American family life--not that there's anything inherently wrong
with that, it's just that when it's not properly handled it's about as
interesting as Wonder Bread.  But good reviews tempted me to see HOME
ALONE--and I didn't regret it.
     Okay, in praising this film I have to throw out a number of
warnings:  This is a "feel-good" Christmas film with a nice neat homey
message; it's a candy-cane and Christmas-tree-ornament sort of movie ...
"great" it "ain't."  But that said, it is fairly impressive that Hughes
and Chris Columbus could piece together such a movie with such craft
that it not only avoids nauseating the audience but actually gets them
rolling in the aisles at times.
     The premise is simple:  two families with hot-and-cold running kids
are taking off for Paris for Christmas.  One of the boys--eight-year-old
Kevin--gets everybody mad at him the night before they leave, so he's
sent up to the attic bedroom to cool off.  There's a power outage during
the night, the clocks are all knocked out, a mad scramble follows in the
morning, and due to the confusion (and a slight case of mistaken
identity) they all drive off ... without Kevin.
     Well, more than that I will not say, but the resulting story deftly
weaves together a plot with a number of subplots--a mean-looking
neighbor, a tarantula, a very bad old videotape, and two nasty burglars
who not only like stealing everything in sight but trashing everything
when they leave--with considerable economy into a smooth-running whole.
The boy who plays Kevin is very good, starting out as a peevish brat and
then evolving to a new self-reliance and even a little Gizmo-Rambo
militancy.
     Okay, entirely plausible it's not, but this is the movies, right?
When HOME ALONE gets rolling it achieves a Looney Tunes sense of timing,
and there is a fairly good sense of wit through the entire film.  Call
it John Hughes / Chris Columbus as Steve Spielberg / Joe Dante.  And
even if there is a message it is administered gracefully enough so that
at the very worst you won't mind it too awfully much ... and maybe if
you're corny enough in your heart of hearts you will nod your head and
smile.

*** (out of 4) At first glance, it appears that the Home Alone movies
are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds.
That's true of HOME ALONE 2 and I'd bet money that it's true of HOME
ALONE 3 (opening soon). But HOME ALONE actually has a lot going for it,
and the cartoon slapstick doesn't get in the way. 
The McAlisters, all 15 of them, are going to France for the holidays.
Four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before
heading to the airport EN MASSE. The littlest kid, Kevin, is the victim
of the older kids' cruelty. Kevin's patience runs out when he learns
that HIS plain-cheese pizza has already been eaten, and he's going to
have to starve. He attacks his big bully brother Buzz, who had been
teasing him. The fight disrupts the already-chaotic dinner, spilling
milk and soft drinks all over the table, a few cousins, and an uncle. 
The knee-jerk reaction is for everyone to blame Kevin. Nobody came to
his rescue when he was being teased, but they all point their fingers
when he fights back. The ultimate punishment comes from mom (Catherine
O'Hara) who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the
night. On his way up the stairs, he tells her that "families suck" and
that he hopes never to see any of his family again. 
That night the power goes out, knocking out the alarm clocks, so the
McAlisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport. In a
surprisingly plausible setup, Kevin is mistakenly accounted for, and the
family heads off without him. 
It's interesting that, in a subtle way, his parents never noticed him
missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from
their children. First they delegate the headcount to an older sibling,
and second, they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class.
They're two-thirds of the way across the Atlantic before they realize
they are missing a child. 
Meanwhile, Kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true. He's
finally rid of his family! Life is a dream come true. He can jump on the
beds, watch R-rated movies, eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips, and
dig through his big brother's secret box. 
Slowly, the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane. He grooms
himself, he does the laundry, he goes shopping ("I bought some milk,
eggs, and fabric softener"). He also starts to miss his family, not just
for their company, but for the security they bring. The furnace in the
basement is a scary monster, the old man next door is a snow-shovel
murderer, and two crooks are trying to break into his house. 
Macaulay Culkin is cute but he isn't much of an actor. Still, we can see
that Kevin's character grows, thanks to some good direction and editing.
For example, acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the
scene where Kevin searches out a seasonal Santa at night, just as
"Santa" is getting in his car. Kevin asks the man to pass on his request
- he wants his family back - to the real Santa. 
He learned how to deal with the furnace. You turn on the lights and it's
not so scary anymore. He goes to a church one evening and there he sees
the snow-shovel murderer, who actually turns out to be a nice man. They
talk about their fears and Kevin learns that age alone does not make you
less afraid. Finally, in the last 20 minutes, Kevin confronts his last
fear - the bandits, head on (literally). This last act is full of
violent comedic slapstick, and after the movie's genuine dramatic setup,
it is dessert. It's a lot of fun, and it doesn't overwhelm the rest of
the movie. 
On the whole, Home Alone is a great holiday movie. John Williams'
original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the
disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls, and the Christmas setting
can put you in the mood for those family gatherings. But it does have
its flaws. 
The smallest problem is that Culkin doesn't act very well. As I said
before, he IS cute, but repeated viewings reveal more about how Columbus
covered himself than about Culkin's insight into his character. The
biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda, the villains threaten
Kevin's life about five times. Instead of "I'm gonna GET that kid" they
say "I'm gonna KILL that kid." Some might argue that the tone is the
same, but I strongly disagree. Mixing comedy with specific and viable
threats of murder is a sociopathic faux-pas. 
I'll probably never see HOME ALONE 3, and I wish I had skipped HOME
ALONE 2, but I do enjoy HOME ALONE almost every year. Don't let your
impressions of the others detract from the original, which has much more
to offer than cartoon slapstick.

     I wasn't expecting much going to this film.  How funny can it be to
watch some wild child and his antics around the house while his parents
are gone?  The answer is: Not very.  Oh sure, there are some funny
moments, and some of the situations are amusing, but this is definitely
a movie that appeals to younger people than me.
     The biggest problems with the film are all the contrived things
that appear throughout the show.  There are also some odd asides that
have to be chalked up to "let's get a laugh," rather than some real
need.  The plot is all too predictable, and while there is occasionally
some inspiring camera work, young Macauly Culkin doesn't really have
what it takes to carry a whole movie yet.  Yes, he's funny, and he has
some great bits, but as a whole, he just didn't pack it.
     I should mention that as a "grown-up," I didn't really get a kick
out of it, but if the gales of hysterical laughter coming from about
every child in the theater are any clue, this movie has gobs and gobs of
appeal to the much younger crowd.  Perhaps they can relate better to
some of Kevin's family problems which appeared out of nowhere.
Rating:
     Take your kids to it, but if you don't have any, or can't get ahold
of some, then skip this one.  It's not trash, it's just not great.  2
stars (**) on the old 1 to 4 star scale.
