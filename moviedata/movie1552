     If you are looking for a movie that offers something different than the
usual cinema treatment of the war in Vietnam, you are going to be disappointed
with 84 MOPIC CHARLIE.  First of all, the movie should be called 84 MUMBLE
CHARLIE.  Throughout most of the first half of the movie the dialogue is
indecipherable, and in the second half it is only somewhat more understandable
because the characters spend most of their time yelling.
     This movie contributes nothing to our understanding of this war.  There is
absolutely no topic dealt with that was not better treated in films such as
PLATOON, APOCALYPSE NOW, or THE DEER HUNTER.  The only novelty of this film
was the audience reaction to the dark humor of the film which, to give the film
maker the benefit of the doubt, I don't think was meant to elicit the
disturbing laughter it in fact did (e.g., "he's so tough he'd eat the boogers
out of a dead man's nose")  Har, har, har.
     One by one the thinly developed characters in this movie get knocked off
by the VC right up to the end.  As with all American films about Vietnam, 84
MOPIC CHARLIE gives us no clue at all about what makes Charlie tick.  We have
no idea why the North Vietnamese fight the Americans.  Perhaps this might offer
American film makers a new approach to the topic of Vietnam.  The ground
covered by 84 MOPIC CHARLIE has already been covered many times.
