   Aris Iliopulos, who directed this film written by Ed Wood, must 
have woken up early one day and decided to make a film out of a 
script that had apparently died and rested in peace for over twenty
years.  Having won from the writer's widow, Kathleen Wood, 
the right to translate the text to celluloid after convincing her that he
would not put a word of dialogue into the movie, Iliopulos--a
portrait painter and photographer as well as a filmmaker--
somehow scraped up some of Hollywood's celebrated stars
to appear in this no-budget silent.  With Billy Zane ("Titanic,"
"Orlando," "Dead Calm," "Back to the Future") in virtually
every scene of the 90-minute, unabashedly "B" movie, the
entire cast seem to be having a ball hamming it up, struggling
to keep a straight face in a movie with Ed Wood's
characteristic 1950s ambiance.  Wood, considered by
cognoscenti to be the worst American director of all-time,
gained celebrity status when Johnny Depp and Martin Landau
starred in Tim Burton's 1994 film "Ed Wood," a film with a
decidedly loving look at the no-talent helmer whose "Glen or
Glenda" (1953) docu-fantasied about transvestism (Wood
himself starred as the title character who cannot decide how
to tell his fiancee he wants to wear her clothes) and "Plan 9
from Outer Space" (1959), about aliens seeking to conquer
our planet by resurrecting corpses from a San Fernando
Valley cemetery.  
   Iliopolus could have made a film to satirize Wood, but why
beat a dead horse? Besides he obviously has a soft spot in
his heart.  How can you help loving a guy with no aptitude
who carried on making film after film while riding on pure
enthusiasm?  Though "I Woke Up Early" has the feel of early
Wood, Iliopulos takes advantage of a few modern special
effects techniques to the extent that his budget would allow,
juxtaposing black-and-white dream sequences from the
principal character's youth with boldly colorful scenes
depicting his current odyssey.  This is the sort of film that 
kids in the seventies might have turned out for at midnight,
toking their weed and establishing their hip quotient by
turning out for the show on Saturday nights for a few weeks.  
   We can guess that widow Kathy Wood insisted  no
dialogue mar the film because any verbal exchanges would
put "I Woke Up Early" in the category of just another movie,
one to be judged critically by the usual standards.  By barring
conversations, she perhaps hoped to cement the movie's cult
status, signalling reviewers and Joe Sixpack alike that this
work should be judged on its own unique merits.  This is not
a silent film in the way we perceive the genre, though at
times Billy Zane may remind us of Chaplin and Keaton. 
Instead the soundtrack is filled with shrieks and eerie music
from the haunting, even maddening, strains of a Scottish
bagpipe (actually played by Ron Perlman who spent quite a
while learning to conquer the basics of the unusual
instrument) to the mellifluous tones of Nat King Cole crooning
"Nature Boy."
   While there is no maxim to be learned from the film--no
"love conquers all," or "life is short," or "persistence pays"--
the movie enjoys incorporating elements of Hitchcock, Brecht
and Fellini, challenging serious viewers to show their
erudition by analyzing the work semiotically and casual
moviegoers to open their minds to an experience unlike any
other they're likely to see this year.
   The plot is anything but confusing.  The Thief (Billy Zane)
escapes from a California mental institution by knocking out
or perhaps killing a nurse (he plunges the long syringe all the
way into her arm), donning her uniform, and making his
getaway.  Quickly stealing clothes more appropriate to his
gender from the local clothes lines, he robs a lending
institution of $15,000 and becomes a wanted man after
shooting the owner.  Attending what he thinks is the victim's
funeral, he hides the money in a coffin which locks the cash
in, making it inaccessible to the thief.  He then shadows each
of the mourners in turn hoping to find the loot.  
  Staying a step or two ahead of the police (Andrew
McCarthy, Steven Weber and Rick Schroder), he confronts
the caretaker (Ron Perlman) and a succession of mourners
whose names he finds on a list.  During his murderous
adventures, he attracts women at a dance hall and, in one
more or less compelling scene is invited to have fun in his
flophouse room by a teenaged hooker (Christina Ricci).  
   If you judge the picture as though it were just another entry
in the annual march of cinema, you will likely conclude that "I
Woke Up Early" is a hollow experience: unemotional, bereft
of traditional character development, pointless, just one-
damn-thing-after-another.  The movie is all that, but what
redeems the whole enterprise is the affection that
paradoxically comes through from its director, who obviously
has tender memories of Mr. Wood.  From time to time, we
regular moviegoers need to watch both serious and comic
stars simply cut loose and have a good time with a script that
is so silly that we wonder whether its writer was as nuts as
The Thief who's in the limelight.  If nothing else, the film may
encourage us to go back to the silents to see how all those
movies made from 1895 to 1927 succeeded in riveting
audiences purely on their visual imagery.  While "I Woke Up
Early" can hardly be called riveting--it's no "Birth of a Nation"-
-there is somehow enough going on visually and sufficient
charm exuded by the admittedly undeveloped characters to
keep us in our seats, despite its absence of either flat-out
laughs or authentic Hitchcockian suspense, genuinely
Brechtian devices or seriously amusing Felliniesque
characterizations.

     CAPSULE: An escaped mental patient loses the loot from a robbery
and goes on a search for it.  This is basically a silent film.  It
often borrows its style from Chaplin and other comics, plus adding some
manic style of its own.  Do not expect to see much Ed Wood here.
Rating: 3 (0 to 10), high -1 (-4 to +4)
   - Hollywood really is the place where dreams come true.  Clearly
     with the renewed popularity of Ed Wood somebody wanted to have a
     new Ed Wood film to cash in with.  Supposedly this is a lost
     script from Ed Wood.  There is little about I WOKE UP EARLY THE
     DAY I DIED to remind one of Ed Wood's style (or lack thereof).  If
     this unfilmed Wood script really exists not much of it seems to
     have made it to the screen.
   - A lot of familiar people in small roles.  Billy Zane is the star,
     going from a huge-budget film called TITANIC to a very low-budget
     film.  He is actually better as a comic actor than a serious one.
   - Some scenes could be out of an Ed Wood film so either parts really
     are by Wood or are made to be in his style.  But there are not
     enough of those.
   - No dialog except on pieces of stock footage.  The claim was that
     this was the first time that was done.  Actually it wasn't.
   - Tippi Hedren, John Ritter, and Bud Cort in small roles.
   - A lot of slapstick.  (Anyone remember Wood even putting
     intentional humor in a film?  His films usually took themselves
     very seriously.)
   - Hip and occasionally funny but unlikely to be authentic.  Not
     funny enough to deserve a good rating.

Well, here's an odd little number with an interesting history. Written by the 
late, not-great Edward D. Wood (director of two of the worst films ever made, 
"Plan 9 From Outer Space" and "Glen or Glenda"), "I Woke Up Early the Day I 
Died" was one of his long-lost screenplays that was recovered years ago, but 
his widow, Kathleen Wood, would not agree for anyone to produce it until a 
director was found that would stay very close to the written page. The person 
for the job happened to be Aris Illiopulous, and in translation to the 
screen, the director has made a movie without a line of spoken dialogue, and 
with an all-star cast who constantly ham it up in pure Ed Wood fashion. Aside 
from Billy Zane, every actor appears only for a brief cameo, each of which 
are so unsatisfying that the fresh stars (Christina Ricci, Jonathan Taylor 
Thomas, Rick Schroder, Tara Reid), veteran performers (Tippi Hedren, John 
Ritter, Will Patton), and camp divas (Eartha Kitt, Karen Black, Nicollette 
Sheridan) come off as mere distractions that hurt, rather than help, the film 
as a whole.
The picture begins as a mental hospital inmate, billed as The Thief (Billy 
Zane), dresses in a nurse's uniform and escapes. Looking for money, he shoots 
and kills a loan shark at a bank and instantly becomes a wanted man. While at 
what he thinks is the funeral of the loan shark, The Thief spies on the four 
mourners (Sandra Bernhard, Tippi Hedren, Michael Greene, John Ritter) whom he 
later suspects stole the money he hid in one of the graves, and stalks each 
one, hoping to find his money. Or something like that.
"I Woke Up Early the Day I Died" goes off in all sorts of directions after 
this basic set-up, as we also briefly (and I mean very briefly) meet cops 
(Andrew McCarthy, Steven Weber, Rick Shroder), a preacher (Will Patton), a 
teenage hooker (Christina Ricci), an undertaker (Carel Struyken) and his 
assistant (Max Perlich), a boy and girl at a beach (Jonathan Taylor Thomas, 
Summer Phoenix) who find a dead body after it plunges off a cliff, a singer 
(Eartha Kitt), a bar waitress (Tara Reid), and a ballroom woman (Nicollette 
Sheridan). I couldn't really explain too much more of the story in fear that 
it would simply get far too confusing, but suffice to say, the film concludes 
on the day The Thief gets up early before he dies. 
Empty would be the perfect word to describe this obviously extremely 
low-budget picture (which Zane also produced). Although it is questionable if 
the film really is exactly like the Ed Wood script, it certainly has the look 
and feel of one of his godawful, but lovingly-made features from the '50s and 
'60s, which is actually a negative thing. As much as Wood loved the art of 
film, the truth was that he had no real talent, and this latest incarnation 
only proves such a thing, as the story and plot developments are inept, 
hollow, and vacant of any human emotions. Never do we identify with The 
Thief, or even understand who he really is, and everyone else is a famous 
person who made the film for no sane reason, since the movie never gives them 
a chance to do anything but camp up the proceedings (as if they already 
weren't camped-up enough).
Writing this approximately four days since I saw the film, it has already 
become foggy in my memory, so don't count on having it stick in your mind for 
more than the 90-minute running time. If anything, "I Woke Up Early the Day I 
Died" is an interesting failure. Choosing not to include any words (aside 
from the lyrics on the soundtrack which, by the way, are pretty memorable 
songs, more so than the movie) was a fairly courageous move on Illiopulous's 
part, and I also liked the idea of having portions of the script occasionally 
superimpose over a scene, so as to fill us in on what exactly is going on. 
It's just too bad that the talented array of actors assembled for this 
production have nothing to do but walk on and walk off; with a good script, 
they could have brought us a, no doubt, showstopper. As is, "I Woke Up Early 
the Day I Died" comes off as a gimmicky experiment that does not pay off, and 
is unable to rise above the thin material. Like all of the films Ed Wood 
directed, this new movie is a pure and simple dud.

You don't look at a René Magritte painting and search for a deeper
meaning. You likewise don't look at one for 88 minutes straight.
Surrealist works are notable for their quirks, and they are fun, but
looking at one quirk for an hour and a half is exhausting. That was my
experience with I Woke Up Early the Day I Died, a surrealistic,
hyperactive comedy with no dialogue. It's not a silent movie; there is
lots of atmospheric music, occasional screams and weird sound effects,
but nobody ever utters an audible word. Though the film is distinctive,
its unique style wore thin after about 20 minutes, and as it progressed,
watching became a chore.
The only reason the script ever got filmed is because it was written by
the pseudo-legendary Ed Wood, the man behind such "classics" as Plan 9
>From Outer Space and Night of the Ghouls. The joke, of course, is that
his films are so bad, they're good; so humorous in their inanity that
they become hits. I Woke Up Early the Day I Died, unfortunatly, is so
bad that it's really bad. It stars Billy Zane (Titanic) as a dangerous
lunatic who overpowers a nurse, escapes from a mental hospital and
proceeds to wonder around, stealing a car, clothes, and a load of money.
Our thief reaches a cemetery, where he witnesses a bizarre ritual. He
falls asleep and finds himself, literally, in a hole, with his money
gone. For whatever reason, he is bent on getting his hard-unearned cash
back (considering how easily he stole it the first time, why didn't he
just go steal some more?). He comes upon a list of the people who were
at the mysterious ceremony and commences to seek out each of them and
kill them if they don't have what he is looking for.
I don't think either director Aris Iliopulos nor Ed Wood realized that
this would have made a glorious 20 minute short. The subject and the
style seem to have been made for it. Unfortunately, twenty minutes worth
of material is stretched out to more than four times that length, and
the film simply overstays its already dubious welcome. It grabbed my
attention in the beginning and gradually lost it as it went on, up to
the point where halfway through I was already weary. It might seem odd
that a film as furiously paced as this one can be so tedious; but the
surprise will wear off when you consider how repetitive it is.
I Woke Up Early the Day I Died is a comedy, I guess, though it could
have fooled me. Unlike most Ed Wood films, this one tries to be funny
and fails, instead of the other way around. There's nothing inherently
wrong with that, in fact, I think it would only make sense for someone
who has been so "good" at making unintentional comedies to take a stab
at a real one. Whether Wood actually went for comedy in his script we'll
never know, but in either case, this is a failure.
Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Christina Ricci, Summer Phoenix, John Ritter and
others show up for short and pointless cameos. Ricci, for example, plays
a prostitute. Her role consists of dancing around with Zane in his motel
room and then being thrown out. Thomas is an astonished onlooker as a
woman gets thrown off a cliff. Was the Home Improvement teen heartthrob
really that desperate for work? Zane, meanwhile, occupies himself by
making weird faces at the camera when he is not called upon to run
around wildly and beat people up. Lack of dialogue makes him the
ultimate caricature.
The carnival side-show climax manages to demonstrate everything that is
wrong with this no-budget production. It's desperately unfunny, but
thinks it's the funniest thing since Plan 9;, it's so spontaneously
surrealistic it makes your head spin all while being confusing enough to
make your head spin twice as fast in the other direction. I hope another
film is made from an Ed Wood screenplay for I Woke Up Early the Day I
Died is not a fitting send-off.

Unrated contains violence and brief nudity.
There have been bad films in recent years: 'Mr. Magoo' was by far the worst ever
made, the spectacularly bad 'Blue In The Face', the horrible 'Baby Genuises'
and now 'I Woke Up Early The Day I Died'. It may not however be the worst movie
made but it certainly ranks as one bad movie. The film's acting (if that's what
you want to call it) is well mediocre to me. Loaded with a sensational cast you
would think that the cast would at least save the film a bit, boy was I wrong.
After escaping from a mental institution 'The Thief' played by Billy Zane goes
out in the real world and finds that it is pretty harsh and gritty. He turns to
burglary to survive, robs a loan back, kills the loan officer and runs with
thousands. A country-wide man hunt is on for him to catch him and bring him
down. He ends up in a cemetery where he puts his money in a coffin to keep it
for later, comes back and realizes that someone took it and put it somewhere.
Now he is determined to kill all the visitors at the funeral earlier that day
until he gets his money back, ultimately leading to a finale that is less that
satisfying.
A film which was based on a 'long-lost' script by Ed Wood, I have only one
question: No dialogue, only music and movement where exactly is the point? The
film moves along at a rather slow pace, but does have one advantage: the
soundtrack which is catchy and vibrant except the first song which can be
offensive to some. It opens with a fun, innovative opening credits sequence and
quickly goes downhill after that.
Some of the low points are when 'The Thief' steals a woman's purse, and then
she faints, Sandra Bernhard as a dancer and Tippi Hendren as a deaf woman whom
'The Thief' kills to the music of 'Psycho'. Come on people get some new ideas
already! What's even worse is that the film has no plot at all. Well to a
certain extent it does, but who cares by the time the middle of the film
arrives we're bored out of our mind and ready for something fun and exciting to
happen.
'I Woke Up Early The Day I Died' is a perfectly bad film. It shows us how low
filmmakers get sometimes just when desperate to make a movie. Even with the
huge cast talent, the film is a waste of my time and certainly a waste of
yours.
