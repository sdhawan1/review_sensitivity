It's sad...Chris Farley's last film is also his worst.  It's a bad
epitaph, and a worse movie.
Matthew Perry stars as Leslie Edwards, an explorer whose goal is to beat
Lewis and Clark to the Pacific Ocean.  To achieve this goal, he hires
the second best tracker in early America, Bartholomew Hunt (Chris
Farley), a drunken buffoon who has blundered his way into his
reputation.
And that's about all there is which passes for plot in this film. Their
party contains some purportedly colorful characters such as jealous
Frenchman Guy Fontenot (Eugene Levy), and encounters some purportedly
colorful characters, such as the vain Spaniard Hidalgo (Kevin Dunn), but
someone, somewhere forgot the humor.
There are only two sequences in the entire film which are barely
chuckle-worthy (Farley's eagle trials, and the group of elderly
warriors). But they in no way can justify anyone in their right mind
suffering through the rest of this atrocious film.
Die-hard fans of Farley will undoubtedly visit this travesty even though
they would be better served by reviewing his best work: his skits on
SNL. Farley was never able to locate a worthy movie for his talents.
(Tommy Boy was the closest, but a messy and cluttered attempt that was
more miss than hit.)  Perhaps the problem was his reliance on the
"fat-guy-falls-down" brand of humor that worked well in sketch comedy,
but seemed labored when stretched out to fill a full movie. He never was
able to either transcend the juvenile level of humor, or to make a movie
filled with juvenile humor actually entertaining.
But, if Farley did a bad job here, at least he had company. Matthew
Perry does a horrifically bad job.  He actually manages to outshine
Farley in the overacting category - an impressive feat, mind you, but
not one conducive to a pleasant viewing experience.  The rest of the
cast are for the most part forgettable (a fact which I'm sure many of
them will appreciate).
Director Christopher Guest takes a major wrong turn after his appealing
Waiting for Guffman. Almost Heroes wallows in stupidity...not
stupid-funny...just plain stupid. I got the feeling that some of the
material might have played better had the movie allowed itself to stray
from the rigidity of its plot.  For example, the subplot involving an
injury prone explorer could have actually been humorous if the movie
allowed its tone to resemble that of say, Monty Python and the Holy
Grail, or even South Park.  But, no, the movie never strays far from
reality, and as a result, the humor stays grounded.
Why were Edwards and Hunt left out of the history books? Anyone who sees
this movie will have a good idea: it's definitely not something you want
to remember.

     Several days after having seen this movie, I'm still trying to 
determine what director Christopher Guest, a man whose sense of humor I 
usually appreciate, found funny in either the concept or the execution 
of ALMOST HEROES.  This is a dreadful motion picture  a lowbrow example 
of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an 
exceptionally poor laughs-to-jokes ratio.  There's a kind of desperation 
in the movie's approach to humor that reveals the film makers' 
uncertainty about how entertaining the material is; the manic style 
betrays itself as a last-ditch attempt to hide the flaws of a failed 
script.
     The premise doesn't sound especially amusing to begin with  ALMOST 
HEROES tells the tale of two explorers, the effeminate Leslie Edwards 
(Matthew Perry) and the uncouth Bartholomew Hunt (Chris Farley), who are 
racing Lewis and Clark on the trip to the American Northwest.  Edwards 
and Hunt are accompanied by the kinds of weirdoes we find in road movies 
(albeit of the early-19th century variety), including a Frenchman named 
Guy Fontenot who claims to speak hundreds of languages (none of which 
prove to be useful), a pretty Indian maiden who turns into the 
obligatory love interest, and a bizarre man who suffers a series of 
debilitating injuries.  Along the way, the intrepid explorers encounter 
bears, bald eagles, aging Native American warriors, and a conquistador 
named Hildago (Kevin Dunn) who raves about his beautiful hair.  The 
explorers' trek takes them through forests, across the snow-capped Rocky 
Mountains, and over a waterfall.  
     This setup leads to a lot of shouting, a great deal of lunacy, and 
very few laughs.  Farley engages in his usual shtick of falling down and 
bellowing, but, aside from an momentarily diverting confrontation with 
an eagle, his heart doesn't seem to be in it.  Matthew Perry, one of the 
stars of TV's FRIENDS (who had some modest success in the romantic 
comedy, FOOLS RUSH IN) is badly miscast.  As a foil for Farley and an 
antidote to his runaway energy, Perry lacks the necessary edge of the 
proverbial straight man.  I'm not a big fan of David Spade, and I didn't 
like TOMMY BOY, but at least he and Farley worked well together.  As far 
as the supporting players go, none of them makes more than a fleeting 
impression.  Eugene Levy is wasted, and Kevin Dunn is about as 
interesting here as he is in GODZILLA.
     Frankly, it's a disappointment to see something this dumb and ugly 
come from Christopher Guest, the brilliant comic force behind such films 
as THIS IS SPINAL TAP, THE BIG PICTURE, and WAITING FOR GUFFMAN.  
Although Guest gets the costumes right, this nearly-inconsequential 
success is no substitute for the weak script and unfunny execution.  The 
special effects, such as they are, are execrable.  For an example of 
some really poor blue screen work, look at the scenes where the 
characters are shooting the rapids (they're obviously getting buckets of 
water thrown on them) and where Farley is being carried off by an eagle.
     Even though Farley didn't have the most stellar of acting careers, 
he doesn't deserve the kind of unfortunate epitaph offered by ALMOST 
HEROES.  While some of the more outrageous attempts at humor may coax a 
few guffaws from 12-year old boys, the level of comedy in ALMOST HEROES 
falls far below the level of sophomoric.  Farley fans who see this film 
as a way to say goodbye should be commended for their loyalty, since it 
takes real stamina to stay seated for the full running length of this 
cinematic torture session.

While he had a number of memorably funny moments during his starmaking
stint on _Saturday_Night_Live_, the late Chris Farley's big-screen starring
vehicles--_Tommy_Boy_, _Black_Sheep_, and _Beverly_Hills_Ninja_--ranged
from bad, worse, to amusingly bad.  Sad to say, his final film,
_Almost_Heroes_, is every bit as sloppily made as his previous starring
efforts--a virtually laugh-free comedy that puts a sad end to the woefully
lackluster screen career of a talented comic.
It's hard to believe that Christopher Guest, who directed last year's
smart and funny mockumentary _Waiting_for_Guffman_, helmed this disastrous
enterprise.  Then again, no director could have salvaged the witless script
by Mark Nutter, Tom Wolfe, and Boyd Hale.  Matthew Perry and Farley play
Leslie Edwards and Bartholmew (sic) Hunt, two explorers determined to beat
the legendary Lewis and Clark to the Pacific Northwest territories in 1804.
 Needless to say, the effete Edwards and the boorish Hunt are in over their
heads, falling into a number of precarious, would-be comic situations (such
as running into a merry band of evil conquistadors) en route to the
Pacific.  The odd-couple teaming of Perry and Farley sounds promising, but
the two generate little comic chemistry.  While this is partly the fault of
the actors (a distracted-looking Perry seems more concerned over
maintaining his uppity New England accent than selling one-liners), the
script never gives them much opportunity to play off their contrasting
comedic styles--Perry's deadpan wit and Farley's wild physicality.
Instead, the writers succumb to the lazy trap that befell the scribes
behind Farley's previous starring vehicles--jam as many "fat guy falls
down" gags as possible.
This time around, though, these obvious gags have an underlying tone of
sadness, since Farley's frustration with such gags has become well-noted
after his death.  Even more troubling are the gags centering on Hunt's
alcohol consumption.   These jokes would have been only moderately amusing
at best had Farley lived to see this film's release, but in light of the
substance abuse-related circumstances of his death, the gags come off even
cheaper, not to mention all the more insulting to the late star.
In my review for another unscreened-for-critics (wonder why) from Warner
Bros., the awful _Major_League:_Back_to_the_Minors_, I noted that not even
the guy in the audience who laughs at just about anything let out a single
chuckle throughout the movie.  The most I can say about _Almost_Heroes_ is
that the laughing guy was back in his element, greeting many a joke with
explosions of laughter.  Everyone else, though, was stonefaced and
silent--at least those strong enough to not walk out of the auditorium.

John Belushi's last film was a failed satire called "Neighbors." The deadly
duo "Wagons East" and "Canadian Bacon" were John Candy's final efforts. Now,
Chris Farley continues the tradition of corpulent comedians leaving a lame
comedy as their legacy with "Almost Heroes," a sloppily made period piece
that's collected plenty of dust in the Warner Brothers' vault since it was
completed more than a year ago.
So much for "always leave 'em laughing."
Had Farley known he only had one more film to make, it's hard to believe he
would have picked this to be his swan song. Directed by Christopher Guest
without so much as an iota of the comic invention and energy he brought to
"Waiting For Guffman" and "The Big Picture," "Heroes" is an odd send-up of
the Lewis and Clark expedition of 1804; perhaps screenwriters Mark Nutter,
Tom Wolfe and Boyd Hale were inspired by the Ken Burns PBS series.
Like many films that studios would prefer to sweep under the carpet,
"Heroes" has a cheapish look to it and shows signs of having been truncated
in the editing room. Many scenes end abruptly with no punchline or
resolution, and others appear to have been clumsily pasted together, with a
surplus of reaction shots to cover up gaps in continuity.
Farley is typically boisterous as folksy trailblazer Bartholomew Hunt, who
teams up with genteel explorer Leslie Edwards (Matthew Perry) in a race to
beat Lewis and Clark to the Pacific Ocean. "Fear will be our breakfast and
stark, raving terror our lunch," Edwards promises.
Along the way, Hunt, Edwards and their band of misfits run afoul of placid
Indians, bad-tempered bears, an old coot who keeps a brothel full of
scarecrows, and a Spanish conquistador with a mane Fabio would envy. What
they don't discover is anything particularly humorous.
Although both Farley and Perry mug excessively in an attempt to tweak the
dullish material, it's mostly in vain. Occassional sparks fly between the
two, but "Heroes" ultimately does little to further Perry's screen career or
enhance Farley's memory.

Written by: Mark Nutter, Tom Wolfe and Boyd Hale
Directed by: Christopher Guest
Running Time: 90 minutes
I guess when you go into a movie with very low expectations, it's more
satisfying when the film turns out to be not so bad.  That's the case
with Chris Farley's last starring vehicle Almost Heroes.  I expected a
cross between Farley's disasterous Black Sheep and John Candy's final
film, the similarly themed Wagons East.  Thankfully, it turned out to
be pretty funny, along the lines of such low-brow comedies like
Kingpin and Dumb and Dumber.
The plot is a simple one: explorers Edwards and Hunt (Matthew Perry
and Chris Farley) set out on a cross country expedition a few weeks
after Lewis and Clark do, hoping to beat them to the Pacific Ocean.
The plot really doesn't mean anything however, as Almost Heroes is
mainly just a collection of sketches using the same locale.  Each
scene seems self contained, as there will be a set-up for a joke, then
the execution of that scene's main joke, and then we proceed on to the
next sketch.  Previous scenes are rarely acknowledged.
Thankfully, most of the jokes and situations work.  Highlights include
a campfire story with a really bizarre punchline, and Farley's
character searching for an eagle's egg.  These moments and many others
got laughs out of me, and still do whenever I think about them.
Surprisingly though, it's Matthew Perry who's the real star of the
film, as Farley seems more of a supporting character, simply providing
reasons for upper-class Perry to react to his lower-class shenanigans.
Eugene Levy is also good in his role, and I've always considered Levy
to be an underrated comedic talent.
What does bother me is the film's final 10 minutes or so.  The film
just completely falls apart.  Not only does Farley get carried off by
an eagle (he holds onto the eagle's legs as it flies, yeah right) but
it also re-writes history along with making the film's title
meaningless.  According to the end of the film, Edwards and Hunt BEAT
Lewis and Clark to the Pacific Ocean!  What the hell?  Also, there's
no dedication to Farley anywhere in the film's closing credits,
something that I thought would be customary.  [PG13]

Walking out of this movie, a friend mentioned to me that, although not
every comedy is great, they all have their 'moments.' This needed no
explanation, for the law of averages says that as long as you keep
trying, you're bound to succeed sometime. What's unfortunate, though, is
that the genuinely comical setups in ALMOST HEROES are so far and few
between that all of the remaing humor - as crass, crude, and obtrusive
as possible - makes the movie completely not worth the money. 
The foremost scapegoat for every failed comedy is the screenwriter, or
in this case the team of three responsible for this cinematic atrocity.
Mark Nutter, Tom Wolfe, and Boyd Hale, none of whom (save possibly
Nutter, who's had supporting roles in MICHAEL and TV's JAG) have any
experience in the motion picture industry and have penned no other
feature films, have drawn out a script that's painful to watch.
Literally painful as well, it's nothing more than a series of
half-hearted conversations which string together drug-induced
caricatures and non-sequitous physical comedy. You don't write much
worse than this. 
But even the worst of screenplays can be made to look plausible with an
inspired bit of acting. Unfortunately that's all the audience gets: bits
and pieces. The late Chris Farley plays Bartholomew Hunt, and Matthew
Perry is Leslie Edwards. Together, the two, along with a hodgepodge crew
of derelicts and invalids, are mounting a mission to go west before
Lewis and Clark do. Farley is outrageously comical, but in this setting
his enthusiasm is mistaken for scene-stealing, and he doesn't win much
audience appeal. Perry is downright obnoxious, and his character is so
unlikeable that he has no chance either. The rest of the crew are simply
stereotypes which were designed solely for the purpose of being the butt
of many jokes. 
This is the second movie of such low quality in a remarkably short
amount of time (after the earlier-in-May BLACK DOG). Maybe it says
something about the willingness of Hollywood to produce downright
unwatchable films, for the cinema is being increasingly saturated with
stale products such as ALMOST HEROES. This one can't be seen to light
under any setting, except for extremely enthusastic Farley fans. It
doesn't come near his other films in appeal or taste, and should be left
to wallow in the wake of more worthy, upcoming summer films.
FINAL AWARD FOR "ALMOST HEROES": 1.0 star - a poor movie.

I had been looking forward to this film since I heard about it early
last year, when Matthew Perry had just signed on. I'm big fan of Perry's
subtle sense of humor, and in addition, I think Chris Farley's on-edge,
extreme acting was a riot. So naturally, when the trailer for "Almost
Heroes" hit theaters, I almost jumped up and down.
A soda in hand, the lights dimming, I was ready to be blown away by
Farley's final starring role and what was supposed to be Matthew Perry's
big breakthrough. I was ready to be just amazed; for this to be among
Farley's best, in spite of David Spade's absence. I was ready to be
laughing my head off the minute the credits ran.
The humor is spotty at best, with good moments and laughable one-liners
few and far between. Perry and Farley have no chemistry; the role that
Perry was cast in seems obviously written for Spade, for it's his type
of humor, and not at all what Perry is associated with. And the movie
tries to be smart, a subject best left alone when it's a Farley flick.
The movie is a major dissapointment, with only a few scenes worth a
first look, let alone a second. Perry delivers not one humorous line the
whole movie, and not surprisingly; the only reason the movie made the
Top Ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with
Farley. And Farley's classic humor is widespread, too. Almost heroes
almost works, but misses the wagon-train by quite a longshot. Guys,
let's leave the exploring to Lewis and Clark, huh? Stick to "Tommy Boy",
and we'll all be "Friends".
