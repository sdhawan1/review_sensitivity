   Westerns--or at least the conventional type involving
stagecoach robberies--have been passe for quite a while
now.  Originally the domain of young, westerns were
accorded adult status when Gary Cooper's stirring role in
"High Noon" showed the advantages of presenting a well-
developed character in a genuinely tense and uncontrived
situation.  A film like "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"
could always break through the passing of fashion, but
remember that George Roy's masterwork featured the
extraordinary star power of Paul Newman and Robert
Redford, whose chemistry together was of a quintessence
and because "Butch Cassidy" was not really a western but a
serious character study sharpened by edgy dialogue which
masqueraded as a cowboy movie.  And oh what a song by
Burt Bacharach!
   Now Jake Scott, son of Ridley Scott and nephew of Tony
Scott, moves to bring the westerns back and targets the
youth audience in much the way of the horse operas of the
forties and early fifties.  There may be a coincidence here,
but we cannot help thinking that he is following in the
footsteps of his role models in styling the movie.  Ridley, for
example, began as a set designer and moved into his own
production company, manufacturing razzle-dazzle TV
commercials.  Kid brother Tony followed a similar path,
directing commercials before turning out his best-known hit,
"Top Gun," an empty action movie with the look of a TV
commercial--though he later turned on a youthful arthouse
crowd with "True Romance."
   Jake, like the two other directors in his family, puts grace
and elan only into his design and costumes rather than into
his plot, making "Plunkett & Macleane" a potential contender
for the production design Oscar.  His England of the mid-18th
Century is part Dickens, part Merchant-Ivory, one which
throws the rabble into high contrast with the bloated
aristocrats of the time.  Unfortunately for the film, the
script--written by a committee of five with three getting the
credit for this muddled writing--tells us virtually nothing about
the ragged background of its title characters and presents the
blue bloods as absurd, unbelievable caricatures.  With the
aristos portrayed in a campy manner and the highwaymen
presented as seriously noble lowlifes (one with pretensions to
the gentry), we don't know what to make of the array of
personalities.  Their juxtaposition just doesn't add up.
   James Maclaine and Will Plunkett were real characters,
interesting enough to have their careers and backgrounds re-
created on the screen rather than bowdlerized and made
contemporary with MTV editing, loud contemporary music,
and an absurd ending that would have rung true had the
scripters instead followed the actual bios of the men.  The
screenplay would have done better dramatize James
Maclaine's background in Ireland, refusal to sit at a desk with
the business his father left to him, and his trip to England
where he failed as a businessman.  After meeting a failed
pharmacist, Will Plunkett, the two took to robbing individuals
and coaches, showing personal differences in make-up. 
Maclaine did not have the heart for the criminal action while
Plunkett plunged into the underground career with passion.
   In the film, however, a less arresting difference in
temperament is played up.  Scott presents Macleane (Jonny
Lee Miller) as a man determined to rise in class into high
society while Plunkett (Robert Carlyle) maintains a contempt
for the aristos, retains his raggedly threads, and plays the
servant to his partner.   
   Cashing in on the affection of the young for vulgarity, Scott
has Macleane meet Robert under offensive conditions as the
more earthy Plunkett acts in jail to extricate the ruby he has
swallowed to avoid detection by the police.  They form a two-
man squad and, as eager as Willie Sutton to go where the
money is, they devise a scheme whereby Macleane would
dress in the Armani outfits of the day while Plunkett would
keep his Dickensian clothing and act as footman.  As they
move on to robbing and blasting stagecoaches--with Scott
throwing in the finest special effects that look at all authentic
with the firepower available in 1749--Macleane falls in love
with the feisty, unconventional Lady Rebecca (Liv Tyler), who
does not fit in with the rest of society, who is turned on by
stagecoach robberies.  Guessing the identity of the two men,
she urges them on to one final bit of larceny--against her own
coach.
   Ken Stott turns in a winning role as the most evil of villains,
a kind of police chief named Chance who operates in an
almost anarchic England, where people got hanged for
pickpocketing and where Chance and Lord Chief Justice
Gibson (Michael Gambon) are put under increasing pressure
by the prime minister to bring the two highwaymen to justice.  
Alan Cumming steals his scenes, as expected, playing the
bi-sexual--actually by his own admission one who "swings
every way"--who seems to have pierced eyebrows and who
operates in his country apparently before the anti-homosexual
laws that put Oscar Wilde in prison.  While Robert Carlyle
thankfully does not talk in Scottish and though Jonny Lee
Miller has matinee-idol good looks, they are no Robert
Redford and Paul Newman, their star power insufficient to
save a film that substitutes one-liners for wit and humor, rock-
video editing for continuity and silliness for romance.

CrankyCriticŽ movie reviews: Plunkett  & Macleane
Rated  [R]
Starring Robert Carlyle, Jonny Lee Miller and Liv Tyler
Screenplay by Robert Wade & Neal Purvis and Charles McKeown,
based on an original screenplay by Selwyn Roberts
Directed by Jake Scott
website: www.reellife.com/plunkett.html
IN SHORT: Best guilty pleasure of the year, and I'm not embarrassed to
admit it. tee hee . . .
. . . and while you will probably see the high brow critics savage video
director Jake Scott's bigscreen debut, Plunkett & Macleane, Cranky will
tell you that he wishes he had purchased the humongous sized popcorn
combo. As far as "guilty pleasures go", and I'm one of the few who gave
thumbs up to Wild Things and The Big Hit and Ringmaster, this "new wave
take on historical drama" is a killer.
Or maybe it's that I worked in the music biz in the heydey of new wave.
Plunkett & Macleane sets itself in the 18th century, while all the
characters speak with 1990s attitude and language. Visually, think of
the darkness of some Ultravox vids crossed with Jimmy Somerville's fey
vocals, Adam Ant costumes and a pounding Eurobeat rhythm track. In
short, it's every mid to late 80s "new wave" video cuisinart-ed together
and played again and again, blasting out at you from the big screen with
occasional pauses for things like plot and story to seep through.
Extremely loosely based on the fact that a pair of highwaymen called
Plunkett & Macleane actually existed back around 1745 or so, one of whom
(Macleane) was so polite and well mannered to his victims that he was
dubbed "The Gentleman Highwayman". The England of this time had no
organized Police Force and any villain of means could buy his way out of
jail with a well placed bribe to a guard or judicial official.
When we first meet James Macleane (Jonny Lee Miller) he is a Gentleman
in Debtor's Prison, a dank and dirty place whose quiet is disturbed by a
violent robbery gone awry. This introduces us to Will Plunkett (Robert
Carlyle), who has been after a fairly large ruby. Through a series of
sequences I won't describe, the pair form an alliance to escape from a
prison they are in. From the start, it is obvious how great the economic
gap is between the rich and the poor, even in prison! On the outside,
the pair decide to go with their strengths (they don't particularly like
each other, but Partners rarely do). Macleane will impersonate a
Gentleman and get the goods on who has what, where it is and when it can
be stolen.
First victim is the pompous and corrupt Lord Chief Justice Gibson
(Michael Gambon) and his lovely niece Rebecca (Liv Tyler). Maclean is
lovestruck at first sight. Rebecca is more observant than she lets on,
though she'll drop clues that she's discovered the identity of the
Gentleman Highwayman as she flirts with an unmasked Macleane at various
events. The sexual innuendo is shoveled on thick. It drips from every
scene it can and wraps itself around as much of the dialog as possible.
Not just from these two. Also from the bisexual Lord Rochester (Alan
Cumming), a friend of Macleane and a man that would as soon cut your
heart out with a rapier as he would perform a wee act of buggery . . .
The "good guy" is called Mr. Chance (Ken Stott), a sadistic and corrupt
lawman for hire. He, too, has a thing for the lovely Rebecca and a good
mind for landing on the right side of the churning political waters. His
pursuit of the pair takes up most of the movie and the resolution
borrows heavily from Bonnie and Clyde. The bad guys must die and the
Good Guy must win out, but in this case the bad are good and vice versa,
even the "bad guys must die" rule still applies.
How does the film manage both? I ain't telling.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Plunkett & Macleane, he would have
paid...
Which is dateflick level for a flick that probably should be rated down
at rental or pay-per-view. Sue me. I enjoyed it. Plunkett & Macleane is
just as clever as Wild Things, only with a little bit of class . . .
warfare.
That doesn't excuse the blatant ripoff of (the chorus section of)
Talking Heads' Houses in Motion in the end credits tune "Horses In
Motion" -- Yeah, right. It's a tribute. Puh-leeze. David Byrne should
call a lawyer.

 "The wise man mocks the man, the mocked man mocks the mocker"
Starring Johnny Lee Miller, Robert Carlyle, Liv Tyler, Ken Stott, Alan
Cumming. Rated R.
Plunkett & MaCleane is a period piece mired down by modern MTV
pretentions. I have nothing against the MTV approach to filmmaking --
used properly it can save a movie (see Stigmata) -- but it ruins this
one, making a muddled, incoherent mess out of a potentially interesting
premise. There are certain genres that just don't go together.
The film opens with a sequence that I still don't understand. It
involves some sort of prison outbreak, a robbery, and a gem that keeps
being eaten. In any case, the caper (whatever it may be) brings
together Plunkett and MaCleane (Robert Carlyle and Johnny Lee Miller,
respectively), two happy-go-lucky Brits with no way to make a living.
They make a pact to steal money from the rich and give it to themselves
until they earn enough money to buy a ticket to America. Their first
heist involves a young debutante named Lady Rebecca (Liv Tyler); a
woman Macleane was especially friendly with at a party just earlier.
His decorum when stripping her of her valuables earns our two crooks
the name "Gentleman Highwaymen."
Lady Rebecca also happens to be the niece of the Lord Chief Justice, a
glaringly arrogant man nearing the end of his political career. He
demands that the robbers be caught and punished immediately, leaving
the job in the hands of the devious Chance (Ken Stott) who has a few
more things on his mind than catching criminals. Meanwhile, Macleane
falls in love with Rebecca infuriating the businesslike Plunkett, who
doesn't want his plans to be foiled by his partner's mindless romantic
travails.
Director Jake Scott, son of Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner), has his
father's knack for setting up atmospheric shots but none of his skill
in actually moving the camera. Most of the action scenes are filmed in
such a rapid, jerky way that it's impossible to comprehend what's going
on. The camerawork is even more nauseating than in the purposefully
dizzying The Blair Witch Project due to its lack of fluidity. Instead
of utilizing panning shots to impress upon us the scope of the events
Scott uses attention-deficit-disorder edits. He barely ever holds a
shot for more than ten seconds and during the faster scenes it seems
more like a couple frames between each cut.
The weird, almost defiant lack of dialogue (there are no -- NO --
conversations lasting over, say, 20 seconds) undermines character
definition and our two protagonists come off as ciphers rather than
characters. The love affair between MaCleane and Rebecca is no
different, emotionless and unrealistic. When the script calls for
Macleane to decide between going to America and going to meet his
lover, there is no reason for us to believe it would be worth it for
him to abandon his goal; he and Rebecca barely even speak to each other
throughout the film.
Plunkett and MaCleane wants desperately to be a triumph of style over
substance but since its style, quite frankly, blows, the film has no
hope of succeeding on any level. I wanted to appreciate this movie on
the basis of its admittedly kinetic pace but I couldn't -- it was so
kinetic it gave me a headache.

"Plunkett & MacLeane", the new 18th century action-adventure from
music video director Jake Scott, defies all the rules of conventional
period piece logic. It is hip, vibrant, and a lot of fun. The film
reunites "Trainspotting" stars Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller as
Plunkett & MacLeane, two ex-cons paired together against their will to
become Britain's most notorious highwaymen.  Plunkett provides the
skills, and MacLeane provides the social stature. The two collaborate
in order to steal from the rich and give to...themselves. When the men
hold up the coach of the Lord Chief Justice Gibson (Michael Gambon),
MacLeane falls in love at first sight with the Lord's feisty niece,
Rebecca (Liv Tyler). While Plunkett tries to rob money for the two to
get to America, MacLeane tries to win the affections of Rebecca. When
I saw "Plunkett & MacLeane", I wasn't quite sure what to
expect. However, after a couple rough opening scenes, Jake Scott
(relative of directors Ridley and Tony Scott) presents us with an
immensely likable, techno-beat-driven period piece adventure for the
MTV generation. Scott's film might be hard-pressed to find an
audience, since it's quirky tone seems to appeal neither to the
costume drama crowd nor the younger action crowd. Hopefully,
moviegoers will look past the facade and "Plunkett & MacLeane" can
become an art house hit.  Whatever the outcome of its theatrical run,
"Plunkett & MacLeane" is quite an enjoyable little film, and an
admirable debut for Jake Scott.

PLUNKETT & MACLEANE, a lavish costume drama set in London in 1748, has
it all: huge, powdered wigs, men with lipstick, rock music, fast edits,
squalor and decadence.  In short it's the perfect movie for those people
who think the main problem with the cinema today is that it lacks an MTV
video gloss.
First-time film director Jake Scott has an extensive resume of --
surprise! -- rock videos.  PLUNKETT & MACLEANE is a hyperactive movie
that is a treat for the eyes but offers little for the mind.  Billed as
a comedy, it doesn't contain a single funny scene with the possible
exception of a remark about halitosis.  When someone uses bad breath as
an insult and that elicits a film's only laugh, you know the movie is in
trouble.
Loosely based on the tale of a real-life robber known as the "Gentleman
Highwayman," the movie is BONNIE AND CLYDE meets BARRY LYNDON, all
scored with a rock sensibility.
A typical scene, filmed through a golden filter, is set at a lavish
costume ball in which the decorations appear to be leftover floats from
the Main Street Parade at Disneyland.  The floor looks like an Escher
print, and the heavy rock beat is as topical as the music from your
local radio station.  Did I mention the crazy costumes?
The setup for the plot is that two working-class criminals develop a
scam whereby one, Macleane (Jonny Lee Miller), will impersonate a
gentleman in order to find who is carrying the most money and valuables.
Plunkett (Robert Carlyle) will act like he is Macleane's servant.
Together they will rob the coaches of the richest of the aristocracy.
This life of crime has predictable twists and turns, right down to the
ending, which is lifted out of a hundred similar movies.
Liv Tyler, as the story's love interest, Lady Rebecca, continues in her
tradition of delivering lifeless performances to characters that are
already badly underwritten.  At the party in which she is introduced,
she is inexplicably the only person, male or female, without a wig.
The best supporting character is played by Alan Cumming, as Lord
Rochester, a bisexual dandy who sports the show's most outlandish
wardrobes, with his large purple hat and accompanying crimson and
lavender jacket being perhaps the most wonderfully silly.
Visually attractive like VELVET GOLDMINE, the movie suffers the same
problem.  It's a good-looking picture, but it's never more than just a
good-looking picture.  The characters are poorly drawn, the script is
DOA and the director only knows how to create flash.  Boiled down to its
three-minute rock video essence, it might prove diverting.  At a
full-movie length, it tests the viewer's stamina.
PLUNKETT & MACLEANE runs 1:33.  It is rated R for some strong violence,
sexuality and language and would be acceptable for older teenagers.

The eighteenth century in Western culture was a different time, with a
markedly different class structure from the present time. No middle
class then, and thus there was a large, unbridgeable gulf between rich
and poor. In fact, England at that time more closely resembled what
would be considered a "developing" country today. This backdrop
provides the setting for a tale of two outlaws who infiltrate the
social circles of the aristocracy in order to rob them.
MacLeane (Jonny Lee Miller) is a gentleman languishing in a debtor's
prison after losing his place in society. One day the wall of his cell
is crumbled by a coach that is being robbed by Plunkett (Robert
Carlyle) and his partner while being pursued by the authorities.
Although his mortally wounded partner is brutally killed by the savage
lawman Mr. Chance (Ken Stott), Plunkett is able to escape with the
freed MacLeane. However, the two are apprehended and sent to prison,
but not before Plunkett swallows a large ruby. In prison, the pair
negotiate their release by bribing the warden with the concealed
gemstone.
After gaining their freedom, Plunkett hatches a plan that can earn
them some money. Since MacLeane was a gentleman, he could pass himself
off as an aristocrat with Plunkett being his servant. This would allow
the pair to determine targets for robbery by getting close and finding
out who has money and what their whereabouts will be. Using a small
sum of money that Plunkett has saved, they begin their ruse.
At their first foray, MacLeane meets, is enchanted by, and
subsequently robs the captivating Lady Rebecca (Liv Tyler). Likewise,
she takes an interest in him, who contrasts with the revolting suiter
her guardian, Lord Gibson (Michael Gambon) keeps pushing on her. She
immediately suspects MacLeane of being the "gentleman highwayman" who
robbed her, but is only charmed by the gentle bandit.
Although it is sketchy and slow to develop, the premise constructs an
interesting scenario. Although the pair are conspiring to criminal
activity, they will the be the protagonists because in the class
politics of the time, the aristocracy are symbolic of greed,
corruption, and oppression. However, at the point at which the pair
begin their criminal exploits, the plot competely withers. The writing
omits any attempt at plausibility, such as having the pair barely
conceal their identities, or always finding their victims unguarded
and unarmed. Plunkett is portrayed as a former apothecary, but is
given powers more like a wizard, using a dazzling command of chemistry
and pyrotechnics to escape from hopeless situations.
The art direction is the only dimension in which the film is
successful. It is apparently the the skeleton around which all other
aspects were meant to serve, which may explain why they were so
underdeveloped. The costume and setting realistically represent the
time period, but the soundtrack gives a arresting but effective
contrast by having a modern tone. Particularly striking is an
elaborate society ball where a period dance is performed while modern
techno music is scored. While these dimensions of the film are
entertaining, they do not redeem the uninspired, cliche-driven plot.
The acting is capable but hampered by the poorly sketched characters.
Only Carlyle is able to raise his character to anything beyond dull
and cliche. Especially poorly written is the character of Chance. From
his first scene he is depicted as vile and sociopathic. However, the
script feels it necessary to bludgeon the viewer with this in every
scene he occupies, to the extent that he becomes predictable and
dismissively uninteresting.
Recommended against. This is a dull, uninspired film that is all style
and devoid of substance. The costume, art direction, and even score
are well done, but the writing is so poor as to make the entire
experience boring at best.

When two 18th century highwaymen start plundering their way
through London's upper class the first victim is historical accuracy,
which seems to have been sacrificed in order to make this period yarn
more appealing to a youthful audience.  The script takes many
liberties with the facts, while debut director Jake Scott (son of
famed director Ridley) deliberately adds a number of contemporary
trappings, including prolific swearing, some raunchy sex, generous
dollops of violence, and a heavily techno- influenced music score from
composer Craig Armstrong.
Plunkett And Macleane reunites Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee
Miller, two of the stars of Trainspotting, who play the highway
robbers with an energy and humour that lifts the material.  Carlyle
seems to be enjoying himself immensely here as Will Plunkett, a
notorious thief and crude outsider.  He reluctantly joins forces with
Captain James Macleane (Miller), a disgraced soldier, when they both
end up in prison.  Plunkett convinces the well-connected Macleane to
use his charms to gain entry into the homes of London's wealthy and
check for potential victims.  As their crime wave increases, pressure
mounts on the sadistic chief law enforcement official Chance (a
suitably menacing and grim Ken Stott) to bring the pair to justice.
Liv Tyler may as well have phoned in her lines for all the
impact she has on the film, trapped in a rather thankless role as the
beautiful young Lady Rebecca, who falls for the handsome Macleane.
Scott brings plenty of energy to his first feature film, and
Plunkett And Macleane maintains a reasonably cracking pace for much of
its length.  He gives the film a flashy visual style and a slick
surface, that betrays his background in advertising and rock video
clips.  The tyro film maker shows that he has learnt a lot of his
father's visual tricks and flair, but little of his meticulous eye for
accuracy or period detail.
The production design is quite impressive, with Prague
doubling for dingy 18th century London.  But the film has primarily
been shot in dark tones by John Mathieson, who prefers to use the sort
of natural lighting that seems to have become popular in many modern
movies.
 It may emphasise the shadowy mists and fogs of London, but it also
makes it hard to discern what is happening, and strains the eyes.
Plunkett And Macleane is ultimately let down by an overall superficial
quality that suffuses the production.
This should have been a jolly old romp through the decadence,
debauchery and corruption of Georgian England in the company of a pair
of likeable thieves.  Instead it turns into something of a misguided
and disappointing mess, and its contemporary touches jar.

Starring Robert Carlyle, Johnny Lee Miller and Liv Tyler
Directed By Jake Scott
Running Time: 1 hour 40 minutes.
Plunkett & MaCleane marks the directing debut of Jake Scott, brother of
Ridley and Tony. Naturally, this got me worried. Would Jake's talent be
inherited from Ridley or Tony? If it was from Ridley, than the movie would
be a thoughtful suspensor with action thrown in. If it was from Tony, it
would be wham bang drivel. Unfortunately, the latter is true for this
worthless picture with little charm. Carlyle and Miller are the titular
highwaymen, Plunkett (Carlyle) who is poor and unruly, and Captain James
MaCleane (Miller) a clean cut gentleman. As the tagline clearly wants to
make known, they rob the rich and nothing else. The film basically follows
the rowdy hold ups the two stage, along with romantic interludes with Lady
Rebecca (Tyler.) Hot on both their tails is Mr Chance (Ken Stott) who wants
to see them both dead.
Plunkett & MaCleane is an annoying little film that serves little purpose.
Although undoubtedly slick and fast paced, there's very little merit
contained in the film. Carlyle and Miller are fun enough as the foul mouthed
pair, although their characters are criminally undeveloped. It appears that
much of the money has been spent on the expensive looking sets and costumes,
but not on the script. The five(!) screenwriters (three credited) have
produced an still born movie: there's very little development in the story.
Also, major events, such as Mr. Cash finding out who Plunkett and MaCleane
really are, are so rushed that they barely happened. The story is a bit of a
mess, frankly.
The performances aren't bad: Carlyle and Miller are typical lads, but Liv
Tyler is a huge disappointment as the love interest. Her irritable, stilted
performance sticks out like a sore thumb, and I was quite unsure on what
accent she was trying to put on. She looks nice, though. More interesting is
Alan Cummings as the campy Lord Rochester, and although his character
amounts to nothing more than a two dimensional comedy gay character, he hams
it up well. Ken Stott is suitably evil as Chance, but again he is nothing
but a flat character. I didn't particularly care when the predictable death
sequence arrived.
Although a disappointment in writing, and a minor success in acting, the
film certainly look lavish, with good costumes, and wonderful sets. But
production design alone can't save a movie, especially a movie as bad as
this mess. Jake Scott would be more suited to directing a music video rather
than this failed update of a period drama: the only update seems to be the
fact that everyone must talk dirty, with 'f*ck this' and 'stand and f*cking
deliver' splattered all over the place. The MTV editing and direction are
flash enough, but in the end decidedly empty.
Plunkett & MaCleane is a massive disappointment. Although somewhat enjoyable
during parts, it's so light it could float off the screen if it wasn't just
images on a reel. There's no thought, no development, no plot, just a series
of manic edits and quirky camera angles to make this film appeal to
Gen-Xers. Although it's a great idea: update a period drama to the MTV
generation: it's execution is awful, and would more likely bore than excite.
Sloppy and occasionally off puttingly tasteless, it's hard to recommend
Plunkett & MaCleane as a movie, but easy to recommend it as a overlong music
video. Give it a miss.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
A gorgeous-looking but uneven twist on Robin Hood, Plunkett & Macleane
reunites two Trainspotting stars as criminals that rob from the rich,
but keep the wealth for themselves rather than passing it along to the
poor. The promising directorial debut from music video director Jake
Scott brings to mind Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet  another pic that
modernized (to an extent) a period piece. The script is a bit of a mess,
but the film's astonishing look is more than enough to offset any story
problems.
Set in 1748 London, the film opens with Captain James Macleane (Jonny
Lee Miller, Hackers) en route to debtor's prison. His stagecoach crashes
with another and, while crouching in the darkness, Macleane witnesses
two shadowy figures rob the passengers. One crook swallows a giant red
jewel after being shot by the approaching authorities. As he lies there
slowly dying, the lawmen press his wound in an attempt to procure the
name of his accomplice. The wounded criminal doesn't finger his friend
and Macleane watches as he is put out of his misery.
Several days later, the on-the-lam Macleane watches the outlaw's funeral
from a distance and returns that night to dig up the body and fish the
jewel out of the cadaver. But his grave-robbing is interrupted by the
dead man's partner, who has returned to lay claim to the jewel. His name
is Plunkett (Robert Carlyle, Ravenous) and, with his gun to Macleane's
head, Plunkett makes him delve into the corpse's innards in a very
disgusting-looking and sounding scene. They eventually surrender as
authorities surround them and Plunkett swallows the oft-eaten jewel for
safe keeping.
In New Gate Prison, we discover that Macleane is formerly of wealth but
ended up in tattered clothes because of monstrous gambling debts.
Plunkett approaches him with a plan  use the jewel to buy their way out
of the clink and, once freed, join forces to rob the rich. Macleane
agrees, but the two must wait until Plunkett passes their bauble, which
eventually hits the metal pan with a satisfying "clang."
The plan includes reestablishing Macleane as a "gentleman" in local
society as he stakes out the ritziest parties in town in an attempt to
learn the most vulnerable rich folk to rob. He loses money gambling at
these parties only to promise "I'll get ii back," which he does  and
then some  as he and Plunkett hijack the mark's stagecoach on the way
home. Macleane will even go so far as to copulate with disgusting
richies and at one point gets a bad case of "the pox," an early venereal
disease. Later, the men disrupt the heifer's wedding, robbing its
opulent guests during a fantastic fireworks display in this
great-looking scene.
As their escapades continue, their notoriety rises, as well as their
reward for capture. Plunkett and Macleane even knock over an important
figurehead in local government, who happens to be escorting his lovely
young niece (Liv Tyler, Cookie's Fortune) for whom Macleane fall. Of
interesting note, this is Tyler's second period piece that features
characters drawing at ten paces. The other is the upcoming Ralph Fiennes
film Onegin.
The picture's modern twist includes piercing, prominent cursing,
widespread gambling and the use of modern music, which is a bit
distracting at first, but as the film continues you realize that it's
better than the typical harpsichord crap that would ordinarily accompany
a frocky period piece like this. Critics will probably laugh this film
off, but its fantastic looks  especially the nighttime robbery scenes 
appear to be equal to that of the upcoming Sleepy Hollow (at least from
what I've seen from the trailer). The hodgepodge script comes from five
writers and the movie was filmed in three locations - London, Prague and
Spain.
