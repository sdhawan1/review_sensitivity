     I'll be honest with you:  the last thing I was expecting from the
Paramount-distributed TREKKIES was a warts-n-all documentary about "Star
Trek" fandom.  Paramount, after all, was the corporate homeworld of the
United Federation of Planets; how critical a look could the studio
_really_ take at those who so proudly wore the milk moustaches from its
most lucrative cash cow?  Roger Nygard's TREKKIES, however, is about as
far from an officially endorsed whitewash as one could imagine.  In fact,
though its character studies are at times undeniably amusing, it's almost
too focused on turning its subjects into the oddballs everyone already
suspects Trekkies of being.
     Narrated by actress Denise Crosby (who portrayed Tasha Yar on the
syndicated "Star Trek: The Next Generation"), TREKKIES is essentially a
loosely assembled collection of cast member anecdotes and portraits of the
hardest of hard-core fans.  Among the individuals profiled is Barbara
Adams, a Little Rock, Arkansas bookbinder and "Commander" of a local fan
organization who gained national attention when she served as a Whitewater
trial juror in her full Starfleet uniform.  Another tour guide is
14-year-old Gabriel Koerner from Bakersfield, California, who leads
viewers through a typical "Star Trek" convention -- one of 28 he has
attended -- complete with merchandise tables, auctions and guest
appearances by cast members past and present.
     The bad news for many "Trek" fans expecting a sympathetic portrait is
that those two characters are among the more mainstream folks in the film.
TREKKIES doesn't hesitate to show us characters like the cross-dresser who
performs "Trek"-inspired folk songs, or a woman whose obsession with Brent
Spiner (the artificial life form Data on "The Next Generation") borders on
stalking, or an engineer who travels the streets of Minneapolis in an
enclosed wheelchair-like device modeled after a "Trek" prop.  When the
subject matter swerves into the pornographic fan fiction which has been
created using "Trek" characters, it no longer feels like Nygard is just
creating a comprehensive catalog of the manifestations of Trekkie-ism.
There's an element of side show exploitation to these aspects of TREKKIES,
a sense that Nygard is less interested in understanding the phenomenon of
Trekkies than in turning their eccentricities into punch lines.
     That's truly a shame, because the "why's" of Trekkies could have been
at least as fascinating as the "who's".  In an utterly unique way, the
universe created by Gene Roddenberry affected viewers as no other
television program has in the history of the medium.  There are moments of
insight into the way "Star Trek" changed the lives of those involved in it
forever, as in actor James Doohan's ("Scotty") emotional story about how
he helped save the life of a suicidal woman.  TREKKIES also touches on the
impact of the show's positive portrayal of multi-ethnic integration, and
on the optimism of its messages of inclusion and acceptance.  Such ideas
should have made it easier to see Trekkies as social outsiders who have
embraced a mythology in which they are tolerated, and even celebrated.
It's ironic -- and somewhat disappointing -- to watch the film turn them
into social outsiders once again.
     There's no denying that TREKKIES is occasionally quite funny, whether
in the answers of cast members to the strangest fan experiences they have
had, or in the ways various Trekkies have integrated their love of "Trek"
into their lives (like dentist Dennis Bourguignon's "Starbase Dental"
office). It was only after I left the theater that I realized I had been
laughing at these people more than I was laughing with them.  Yes, there
are comments about how intelligent most "Star Trek" fans are; it's too bad
they feel like token gestures.  Many Trekkies themselves seem to have
embraced the film, but I'm not sure they should appreciate the way they
are turned into exactly what the broader population generally thinks of
them.  There's not enough balance between the unusual things these people
do and the love that inspires them to do those things.  It was brave of
Paramount to endorse a film like TREKKIES.  It also seems like a bit of a
betrayal.

***1/2 (out of 4) TREKKIES is one of the funniest movies of the year,
but it's not a comedy. It's a documentary about the fans of STAR TREK
who are fanatical, loyal, optimistic, and just a little crazy.
Although its "five-year mission" was canceled after only 3 seasons, STAR
TREK made an indelible mark on American culture. It captured the hearts,
minds, and imaginations of a generation (myself included). Some admired
it for its respectful treatment of science. Others, for its optimism
with regards to race, class, and nationality. And some were just happy
to see science fiction get a decent TV show.
But no matter how much you like STAR TREK, there's always someone who
carries that admiration too far. These people are the Trekkies. (Even
Trekkies try to separate themselves from the hard-core geeks by
splitting themselves into two camps  TrekkIES and TrekkERS  although
the distinction is purely semantic.)
Denise Crosby, the short-lived Lt. Yar from the NEXT GENERATION series,
narrates the movie and conducts some of the interviews. She shows us her
own collection of fan-junk (several large boxes), including sketches of
her and co-star Brent Spiner in naked, romantic, passionate poses.
Other actors have received bizarre stuff from their fans. The late
DeForrest Kelly (who played Dr. McCoy) tells of a fan who, along with
her photo, sent him a marijuana cigarette. James Doohan (who played
Scotty) told of a fan who sent a suicide note. Although he probably
should have forwarded the note to a psychologist or police, he responded
to the person by insisting that she show up, alive and well, at the next
convention. More letters came and Doohan kept responding in the same
way, until eventually, the fan was in the clear. Doohan gets choked up
when he thinks about it, awestruck that a simple actor could do
something as noble as save a life.
Still other cast members (I didn't note who, and I won't try to guess),
recount their trip to a NASA launch, where they hoped to get some
autographs of REAL astronauts. But when the astronauts saw who had come,
they got excited and turned everything around. The ASTRONAUTS ended up
asking for the ACTORS' autographs.
Nygard intercuts these interviews of actors, with interviews of their
fans - and boy did he find some doozies.
A fan dressed as a Klingon explains that there's now a Klingon-English
dictionary and a complete translation of Hamlet. A Klingon Bible is on
its way. He boasted that Klingon is now more widely spoken than some
fading tribal tongues.
A dentist in Florida has done up his entire office in a STAR TREK motif.
The walls and ceiling are covered with Trek stuff, and every employee
wears a uniform  including one receptionist who held out for a year
before finally agreeing. The dentist and his wife both wear their
uniforms at home, as well. They say that role-playing characters from
the show helps their "relationship." (Thankfully, Crosby didn't ask for
details.)  
Another promising young trekkie is writing a script for a new STAR TREK
movie. He's already modeled a spaceship fly-by on his home computer, and
the new uniforms he designed for the movie arrive back from the tailor
during his interviews, just in time for the next convention.
Another, older man dresses in the Starfleet uniform from the early
movies. He admits to the camera that if he had the money, he'd get his
ears surgically pointed to look like Spock's  something he had
obviously never mentioned to his wife, sitting next to him.
The only thing missing from Nygard's documentary is the Saturday Night
Live sketch of William Shatner at a Trek convention. After a few
ridiculous questions from hard-core fans, he breaks down, shouting "you
people need to get a life!"
In that spirit, and with the admission that I, too, am a Trekkie, I'll
close with some of my favorite quotes from thefans:
"One of my goals is to build a great big shelf." "I spent a lot of time
in vans." "I'm gonna connect my house with Jeffries tubes." "Every year
it gets bigger. This year we had a girl come." (REFERRING TO A GATHERING
IN IOWA.)

I can't remember ever having laughed so hard at any movie...
let alone a documentary.  Not that the film mocks Trekkies. 
That would be cruel, as well as quite unnecessary  Plus it
would be counterproductive to the filmmaker's intent.  What
was done was simply send Denise Crosby and a film crew to
conventions and such, and let the Trekkies speak for
themselves.  Denise Crosby played the long-limbed Lt. Tasha
Yar on `Star Trek: The Next Generation'; her character was a
kind of low-wattage Seven of Nine.  She's almost absurdly tall
and blonde.  The  obsessive fans turn positively garrulous in
the presence of this minor deity of the Trek pantheon, although
a couple of them become confused to the point of forgetting
their names.
It's almost unfair.  As they ramble on, what stands out most is
their extraordinary earnestness.  In Trek they find a vision of
the future, a code to live one's life by.  One caller to a radio
show tells how a Trek episode helped him deal with a death in
his family.  Well and good, except that I couldn't help thinking
that maybe a moment in life as profound as the death of a
parent should be one's own, personal, and not influenced by
the plot of any TV show.
Realizing that theirs is an obsession, they feel compelled to
defend it.  And invariably sink themselves.  Certainly, it's okay
to like, even to be passionate about a TV show.  It's okay to get
together with other like minded fans, to talk and swap
memorabilia.  The next step is dressing up and getting in
character at these events, and that's okay too.  Since it's
nothing to be ashamed of,  the logical next step is getting on a
city bus and going to work that way.  By small steps of
Vulcan-like logic, they end up acting like crazy people.  
Invariably, they know there is a line that shouldn't be crossed.
Invariably, that line is always somewhere just around the bend. 
Like the 50-ish man who says he'd stop short of getting his ears
surgically altered to Spock points.  He has remodeled his home 
to resemble a Trek set, he goes to the supermarket in his
Starfleet uniform, his wife wears a uniform too and they've
even put one on their poodle.  But getting his ears done... no,
THAT would be crazy!
It's almost inspiring that people can be so impervious to
embarrassment.  Or so unencumbered by social niceties.  There
is a dentist in Florida whose office is a Trek microcosm.  He
wears the uniform, as does his staff; the decor is all Trek.  He
and his wife show Ms. Crosby around the place.  The tour
concluded, the wife explains that sometimes at home they `do'
different characters.  Since she's too short to play Denise
Crosby's character, she explains, her husband puts on a blonde
wig....  Okay, I don't know what was said next because at that
point I lost it.  As did Crosby.  (I've never seen someone
actually jump in astonishment before.)
Which brings up-- to mix my sci-fi metaphors-- the dark side of
the whole business.  There is the woman who keeps hundreds
of pictures of Brent Spiner, aka the android Data, in a steel
floor safe.  Lest they be lost to fire or earthquake, she explains
(see, it's all completely rational...)  Then there is the stuff that
fans send to the stars.  Crosby opens her garage: she's got
boxes full of it.  People have sent her artwork, including some
technically proficient and rather torrid nudes of her and the
aforementioned Data, embracing as lovers.  `At first,' she
explains, `I was offended.'  
AT FIRST?!!  I suspect she's being a bit disingenuous. Denise
Crosby proves much more skillful as an interviewer than she
has ever been as an actress.  By not  establishing any
boundaries, by not setting any limits with the Trekkies she
interviews, she lets them take plenty of rope.  They promptly
hang themselves.  And they have no one to blame but
themselves.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Roger Nygard's hysterical documentary about the fans of Star Trek can be
summed up in one scene, where one aficionado describes the growing
popularity of his annual Trek party by proudly stating that `This year,
we had a girl come and everything!'
Such a brazen mockery of the world's easiest target is particularly
welcome among film critics, since Trekkies are the only group lower in
the social food chain.  We may be dorky, but we don't force our pets to
don miniature replicas of Kirk's uniform (they do).  We also don't bid
thousands of dollars for a piece of latex that previously served as one
Trek character's ridged forehead (they do that, too).
But the film also serves an educational purpose.  Viewers will hear both
sides of the timeless `Trekkie' versus `Trekker' battle, learn how to
speak Klingon, and find out which action figures are worth liquidating
their 401(k) to buy.  You can also see Leonard Nimoy scratch his head
while trying to figure out what the hype is all about.
Remember that wacko that insisted on wearing her Star Fleet uniform when
she was called for Whitewater jury duty?  She's here.  So is a dentist
that not only sports his Commander attire to work every day, but also
forces everyone in his office to do the same.  Their stories are mixed
together with dozens of other crackpots, including one particularly
strange woman that swore her cat was a big fan, too.  The film's closing
credits reveal a dedication to that same cat, who I am assuming took its
own life just to get away from the lunatic clutches of its owner.  (1:26
 PG for mild sexual and drug references)

"Reality is a crutch for those who can't handle science fiction" reads a
t-shirt that has been in production in one design or another for decades.
Although you could substitute "soap operas", "gardening", "guns", "rock and
roll", "politics" or any number of other pastimes for "science fiction", sf
fans are a special breed. And "Star Trek" fans are a unique mutation within
that species.
Director Roger Nygard and Denise Crosby (Tasha Yar from "Next Generation")
traveled the convention circuit interviewing fans and have come up with some doozies.
Probably the most famous is Barbara Adams, chosen for jury duty in the
Whitewater trial. Wearing her Starfleet Commander's uniform to the courtroom,
she seemed oblivious to the incongruity of the situation. "I'm an officer of
the Federation 24 hours a day," she explains, "Every day I would walk past the
reporters with a Vulcan-like stoicism."
Sometimes the film takes a loving look at the phenomenon. Nichelle Nichols of
the original series tells of a very young Whoopie Goldberg who ran screaming
through the house shouting, "Everybody come look! There's a black lady on
television and she ain't a maid!"
Unfortunately, too often the film presents the fans like a freak show and I
found myself cringing in a combination of fascination and embarrassment. A man
speaks of having his ears surgically altered to look like Spock. A woman
exhibits her hundreds of nearly identical photographs of Brent Spiner (Data)
and talks about gazing at the hill near which Spiner lives.
Fourteen year old Gabriel Koerner sits at his computer creating wondrous
graphics, but he is so self-satisfied about his collection that you hope, if
he were in the series, he'd be the extra who beamed down to the strange planet
never to return.
I may have never said this about a film before, but as the camera pours over
the minutia of a Treked-out dentist office, you have to wonder why this is a
movie. It'll be a hoot as a video, but in the theater I felt trapped.
(Michael Redman has written this column for a very long time and confesses to
having seen every "Star Trek" episode several times...well, except some of
those from "Deep Space Nine".)

There was a late episode from "Star Trek: The Next Generation" which
had the new Enterprise crew rescue Scotty from the old series.  Through
the course of this episode, Scotty gets homesick, and, through the
magic of the holodeck, he visits the bridge of the old Enterprise and
reminisces over a bottle of Romulan ale (or somesuch).
I'm told that this old Enterprise bridge was borrowed from a Star Trek
fan club: the fan club actually went and built the bridge in precise
detail, and Paramount found it easier to rent it than build their own.
I'm surprised this story didn't make it into the documentary,
"Trekkies".  It would have fit in, alongside the stories of the
15-year-old fan whose club is making a movie -- he's doing the special
effects on his PC -- or the dentist who dresses up as a Star Fleet
officer to see his patients (and has his receptionists and assistants
dress in uniform, also).  Or, for that matter, with the Whitewater
juror who came to court every day in her Commander's uniform.  Such is
the energy and zeal being unleashed on things Star Trek by its fans,
and spilling out into the mainstream world.
I have to admit that I can identify an undisclosed number of Star Trek
episodes given only a five-second sample, but not all of them, and
probably not the majority from ST:DS9 or ST:V.  I have never worn
Vulcan ears and remain horrified by the "Q Virus" story from
"Trekkies".  As a more casual fan, seeing all this wackiness from more
ardent fans is a treat:  there's sufficient familiarity with the milieu
to identify with much of the more extreme behavior, and to be surprised
in a good way by the creative ways fan devotion is expressed.  Yes, I
know that Commander Sisko shaved his head and grew a goatee midway
through the series, but would I have imagined that a fan would take the
Sisko action figure, file off its plastic hair and paint a little
goatee on it?
And Star Trek is a positive force, with notions of public service
deeply embedded in its vision of the future (for an interesting
discussion, take a look at this Salon article:
http://www.salonmag.com/ent/movies/feature/1999/06/15/brin_main/index.html).
This moral vision has not been lost on its fans.  The woman who wore
the Commander's uniform to the Whitewater jury, for example, heads up a
local fan club, and her reasoning for wearing the uniform is that the
fan club is dedicated to community service, and what better represents
civic duty than serving on a jury?  The uniform is merely the visible
symbol of this ideal of service.  Indeed, the idea of community service
crops up here and there among the fans highlighted in "Trekkies", from
the aforementioned Commander to the local Klingon crew.  The dentist
who dresses up in uniform is just trying to make his patients feel
better -- the hokey transporter set up over the dentist's chair is
meant to transport the patient away from the root canal procedure.
Overall, Star Trek has been a positive influence, whether as a spark
for individual creativity or as a larger framework for public
consciousness.  There can be worse things than being a Trekkie.
So, is there a real difference between the story of Babe Ruth visiting
sick kids in the hospital and Kate Mulgrew, Capt. Janeway from ST:V,
doing the same?  Both are indulging the passions of their fans, giving
them a chance to feel a bit better in their illnesses.  Baseball and
other sports are more revered and accepted than Star Trek by the
mainstream -- we don't give weird and slightly disgusted looks to
people who know who won the Cy Young in 1966, and we think the guys who
paint their bodies in the team's colors and stand half naked in subzero
weather are just jolly clowns -- but it's just a particular pastime,
hobby or passion.  [A Userfriendly cartoon has nice swipe at this
silly bias:
http://www.userfriendly.org/cartoons/archives/99may/19990516.html]
"Trekkies" is a good documentary, but like most documentaries, it
doesn't get much screen time.  In New York, it's currently playing at
the local 2nd-run movie house (known as the $3-movie theater in a city
where the average ticket is $9) without having actually made it to the
first-run houses.  A pity: it's worth it for both fans and non-fans to
see Trek followers at their most ardent, and see that, while their
behavior may appear kooky or extreme, it's not really a bad thing, all
things considered.

 Trekkies (1999) 4 stars out of 4. A documentary directed by Roger Nygard.
 If you know the name of the bit actor who played the red-shirted security
officer zapped within the first minute of episode eight of the second
season, or if you can speak Klingon, than "Trekkies" is your kind of movie.
 "Trekkies," directed by Roger Nygard, is a documentary about one of the
largest fan phenomenons in pop culture.
 And the truly amazing aspect of Nygard's look at some of these eccentric
people is that he treats them with respect.
 How easy it would have been to make a documentary mocking the obsession of
these fanatics. Instead, Nygard displays an affection for them. His
approach is non-judgmental.
 The movie has no narration; these people speak for themselves.
 Our guide through this strange world is Denise Crosby, who serves as the
film's co-executive producer, and who played Lt. Tasha Yar on "Star Trek:
The Next Generation" before deciding to leave the show.
 Crosby takes us into the conventions, the homes and workplaces of people
and families to whom "Star Trek" is more than a television series.
 In "Trekkies" we meet such people as Barbara Adams of Little Rock, Ark.
Adams had been chosen for jury duty in the Whitewater trial and wore her
Starfleet uniform every day.
 Some people may consider such behavior odd, but, as Adams sincerely
explains, as Lt. Cmdr. Barbara Adams she never leaves home without her rank
pips, tricorder, phaser and communicator badge.
 Adams has embraced the philosophy of "Star Trek" and lives her life
accordingly. We see her at various "Star Trek" conventions signing
autographs. Because of the publicity affored her by wearing her uniform to
the trial, she has become a minor celebrity in her own right, admired by
others for her convictions.
 Then there is Dr. Denis Bourguignon, an Orlando, Fla., dentist whose
office has a "Star Trek" theme. He and his entire staff wear "Star Trek"
uniforms, and his office is a treasure trove of "Trek" memorabilia.
 "Trekkies" may elicit some rather odd reactions. At first you may feel
embarrassed for some of these people. You laugh or chuckle, maybe even
mentally ridicule them. You think to yourself that you wouldn't want to be
caught dead in the same room with them.
 But as you watch and listen, a feeling of understanding and respect and
possibly even a bit of admiration creeps into your psyche. They may be
different, but they are principaled and decent human beings.
 They are devoted individuals who have found a purpose in "Star Trek."
 And that is this documentary's greatest asset. Cast members from the
various "Star Trek" series and films are included and they speak with awe
and great affection of their fans.
 Even William Shatner, who mocked them years ago in a famous "Saturday
Night Live' sketch in which he told the Trekkies to "get a life," speaks of
his regard for these individuals.
 "Trekkies" is a warm, enjoyable experience, as cuddly as a tribble and as
refreshing as a cup of tea - Earl Grey.

I wonder if the majority of Star Trek fans have an intense dislike for
Star Wars. Those Star Wars fanatics have been labeled as the most daring
and the most idolatrous of them all, mainly because of their standing in
line for months to see The Phantom Menace when in reality they can't
hold a figurine up to some Trek followers, often referred to as
Trekkies. Trekkies, the new documentary from Paramount, which ironically
is the studio responsible for Star Trek, brings us an account of this
devoted group of Trek enthusiasts.
Trekkies narrated by Denise Crosby, an actress on Star Trek: The Next
Generation, and what the film does is take a rather random approach in
portraying and profiling die-hard Trekkers. There is a woman who showed
up for jury duty in her Star Trek uniform, saying that she did it
because she doesn't "want any of [her] officers to ever be ashamed of
wearing their uniforms." I searched in vain for any hint of a smirk,
some sign that she really is not serious about all this. There was none.
Star Trek is her world, her whole existence.
Another major focus point of the film is a family of Trekkies, a father
a mother and two children. The father is a dentist. Their office is all
Trek. Everywhere you look you see Star Trek memorabilia, the
secretaries, the nurses and the doctors all wear Trek uniforms (of
course, if I walked into a dentist's office where the doctor was dressed
up as a starship captain I'd run as fast as I could, but then that's
just me).
Director Roger Nygard does not water down this movie one bit, and it
features fans as outrageous as fans get. That is deceptively daring
because nobody expected Paramount to come out with a movie that portrays
trekkies in all their glory and wackiness. And, indeed, Trekkies is
often times riotously funny, though it is unclear whether we are
actually laughing with these people or at them.
The question is whether these hard-core trekkies are worthy of our
derision and our mockery. Alas, they're not. I looked at them, and I did
not see freaks. I saw families and societies coming together in harmony
to participate in something that is of mutual interest. At the risk of
sounding hackneyed, isn't it a hell of a lot better for kids to be going
to Star Trek conventions and sewing Trek uniforms than building bombs?
Those that tell these people to "get a life" are promoting a double
standard, especially as far as the children are concerned. For years, I
have heard society insist that if children got involved in inoffensive,
social activites rather than making trouble the world would be a better
place. Telling these "trekkie kids" to "get a life" is, then, a
contradiction.
I am myself a passive Trek fan, although I don't consider myself a
trekkie. Watching Trekkies, I did not feeling smug or conceited. If
nothing else, I was felt left out.

The most indelible image of the news coverage of the hoopla surrounding
_The_Phantom_Menace_'s opening was not the many people in line dressed up
as Darth Maul, but people out of line dressed up as characters from that
_other_ long-running sci-fi series, in particular one woman: leading a
protest of all the media attention lavished upon _Star_Wars_ while dressed
up as Borg, she held a Yoda doll in a noose, dropped it onto the ground,
and then proceeded to stomp on it furiously.
Sadly, such (for lack of a better term) "deviant" behavior is not
chronicled in _Trekkies_, a documentary about _Star_Trek_'s fervent fans,
but there are plenty of extremes on display.  Witness the Whitewater juror
who insisted upon wearing her Starfleet uniform to court and only likes
being addressed as "Commander."  Marvel at the dentist who turned his
office into a pretty neat microcosm of the _Trek_ universe.  Listen in
astonishment as one fan, who already dresses his poodle in Starfleet
clothes, contemplates having his ears surgically altered to resemble a
Vulcan's.  Laugh hysterically at the infamous "Q Virus" story and one fan
who drives around in a working replica of an unusual transport vehicle
featured in the TV series.
All of this holds a strange fascination, but as one can glean from the
above paragraph, it does get somewhat redundant after a while.  Not to
mention grating at times--the fan who gets the most screen time,
14-year-old Gabriel Koerner, is so smugly pretentious one wishes he would
end up on the wrong end of a phaser.  _Next_Generation_ star Denise Crosby,
who also produced, makes an engaging tour guide to all the madness, but the
film loses steam halfway into its slim 86-minute running time.

  I confess: I am a "Star Trek" fan. I tape "Deep Space Nine"
and "Voyager" when I can't be home. I even had a bit part in a "Star
Trek" movie. But my enjoyment of this sci-fi series is nothing
compared with the fanaticism of hard-core devotees of Gene
Roddenberry's cultural phenomenon. Before there was a "Star Wars,"
there was a "Star Trek." Over 30 million fans watch "Star Trek"
programming each week. "Trekkies" are the only fans listed by name in
the Oxford English Dictionary. "Star Trek" is seen in more than 100
countries, translated into dozens of languages.  More than 63 million
"Star Trek" books are in print and, since July, 1986, every "Star
Trek" novel has been a New York Times paperback best-seller, making it
the best-selling series in publishing history. The average Trekker
spends $400 per year on merchandise, which is why "Star Trek" products
have earned over a billion dollars in retail sales in the last five
years. And "Star Trek" conventions are held every weekend of every
year, in at least three different cities, attracting a million
fans. In this funny documentary, Denise Crosby, who played Lt. Tasha
Yar on "The Next Generation," and film-maker Roger Nygard capture the
obsessive behavior of some truly serious "Star Trek" fans - people who
live through and for "Star Trek." Like print-shop worker Barbara
Adams, who claims she's a Starfleet officer and always wears a
uniform. Like a Florida dentist who converted his practice to Startrek
Dental. Like devotees who learn the Klingon language and an elderly
man who wants to have his ears Spocked. On the Granger Movie Gauge of
1 to 10, "Trekkies" is a benign, amusing 7. Don't forget, the
U.S. Space Shuttle was dubbed "Enterprise" after NASA received 400,000
requests from "Star Trek" fans.

I used to be able to say, "I love Star Trek."  Back then, you could
say that and everyone would know what you were talking about.  These
days, with the old series, the movies with the old cast, The Next
Generation, the movies with the Next Generation cast, Deep Space Nine,
and Voyager, I have to really qualify my statement.  I love the old
series and the movies with the old cast.  I like the Next Generation
and their movies.  I have almost no feeling toward Deep Space Nine and
Voyager.  To see the premiere of the new Star Trek film used to be
something really special.  Today, there's so much Star Trek, a new
movie is practically taken with a grain of salt.  What, I have to PAY
to see this?
Still, there is currently a larger fan base for the entertainment
enterprise than ever before, and it's even more diverse due to all the
different forms of Star Trek available.  They come from all walks of
life.  They are doctors, students, psychologists, housewives, radio
personalities.  They are from the upper class and the lower class and
everywhere in between.  Many may not even speak the same language, but
they all have one thing in common:  They like the message that Star
Trek delivers.  If we try hard enough, we will all survive and get
along with each other in the future.  But just what makes a person
devote more than a passing interest to a television show?  What kind
of a person attends conventions, or dresses up like his or her
favorite character when it isn't even Halloween?  It's these types of
questions Roger Nygard tries to answer in his documentary, TREKKIES.
After the first five minutes or so, I thought I was going to be sick.
The film immediately begins documenting the extreme in Star Trek
fandom; the ones that take the show way too seriously.  The freaks.
Sounds of laughter erupt from different pockets of the theater, and it
seems this film is taking cheap shots and making people laugh at the
expense of others.  I felt embarrassed.  Unfortunately, this trend
lasts a while until we spend more time with each of a number of fans
and their lives get a little more personal to us.
The documentary shows us a pretty wide range of people who are
associated with Star Trek, but the most time is spent with those who
have seemingly gone off the deep end.  After all, the normal people
are boring, right?  A few people we meet are a dentist whose practice
is one big Star Trek fantasy (his office is adorned with all kinds of
memorabilia and he and his assistants are dressed daily in costume), a
man who wears his costume to the supermarket and would get his ears
cut to points like Mr. Spock's if he could afford it, and young man
who is making his own Star Trek movie.
TREKKIES is narrated by Denise Crosby, who played Lieutenant Tasha Yar
for the first year and a half of the series, Star Trek:  The Next
Generation.  Crosby also serves as the interviewer in many of the
film's sequences, and it's nice that she seems to be going on the same
journey we are.  It's as though she is facing these people with the
same unjaded incredulity, and head-shaking amazement as the audience,
even though we know she must have faced some of this before.  However,
if it's an act, it's a good one.
Whereas we'd like to end up feeling a connection with the fans in
TREKKIES, the film doesn't go into sufficient depth so that we
understand why they do the things they do.  Is it insecurity?  The
need to feel like they "belong" to something?  Or is Star Trek just
something they think is really, really cool?  By staying on the
surface, we unfortunately never get far past the feeling of amusement
or even pity.  Take, for example, a woman who belongs to a Star Trek
fan club in which they assign ranks to members.  She insists that her
co-workers at Sir Speedy print shop refer to her as "The Commander,"
and although she may not wear her uniform every day, the communicator,
phaser, and rank insignia are usually found as accessories to her
apparel.  We might admire the fact that she is so devoted to her
passion and her club, but she likens the wearing of the uniform to
being part of a military organization.  The thing is, it's not like
that at all.  Her uniform is part of a television show and isn't meant
to be worn in public, save for the novelty.  By the way, this woman
was actually on the O.J. Simpson trial jury, and yes, she wore the
uniform to court every day.
Another woman we meet is obsessed with Brent Spiner, who plays the
android Lieutenant Commander Data on The Next Generation.  She calls
herself a "Spinerfem" and keeps her album of Brent Spiner photos in a
fireproof safe in her closet.  Since she lives relatively close to his
home, she goes out on her balcony and gazes toward it to cheer her up
when she feels depressed.  One fan talks about the informal backyard
gatherings he annually attends in the unofficial birthplace of James
T. Kirk, Riverside, Iowa.  He informs us that the previous year was
great.  They had a few more people, and even "had a girl come."  This
is not a film with a lot of sympathy toward its subjects.
One of the better elements of TREKKIES is its interviews with the cast
members, who share some truly interesting and touching anecdotes
involving their experiences with fans.  For example, James Doohan, who
played Scotty in the original series, literally saved a fan's life by
keeping in contact with the suicidal girl and telling her he wanted to
see her at the next convention.  However, a movie that is essentially
about the fans cannot be built upon pieces such as this, and must
revolve around the fans themselves.  It's a pity that Nygard's
documentary only gives us unfeeling looks at the extremes, as the gems
involving the actors contrast greatly to the bleak picture painted for
us by the fans about which they are supposed to be talking.
If this film had delved deeper into the "normal" folks who enjoy Star
Trek without having it run their lives, it would have provided a much
needed balance.  Would this have been less interesting than seeing
fans who live and breathe Star Trek?  On the contrary, I believe it
would have helped answer the original questions of who these people
are and why they like Star Trek.  We would have found that they aren't
just the people you'd cross the street to avoid, but are also you and
me.  Instead, we only learn that there are some pretty strange people
in the world.

'Trekkies' is Roger Nygard's documentary that covers the networks and 
peregrinations of 'Star Trek' fans.  As one speaker - a psychotherapist and 
devotee himself - reminds us, "fan" is short for "fanatic."  What we see, 
then, is various subcultures of very ardent fans, and lifestyles inspired by 
Gene Roddenberry's ideas.
As in many serious films, the title surfaces, here assisting in dividing 
fans into a couple of categories.  "Trekkie" appears to be a slightly 
belittling term, applied perhaps to a more casual watcher and occasional 
collector.  "Trekker," on the other hand, is a heavier nomenclature, 
pointing out people who "walk the walk," as it were, with the minds who 
created the philosophy and world-view behind the original television series 
and its sundry spinoffs.
Thus the woman dismissed from the jury in the Whitewater trial for wearing 
her Lt. Commander outfit is a "Trekker."  We meet her at the printing 
company where she works, and where her fellow employees and bosses call her 
"Commander."  Another Trekker is the 14 year-old who designs computer 
graphics and real costumes.  (In a smart narrative move, Nygard has this 
boy, who speaks clearly, like a young Danny Ackroyd, guide the camera around 
a Star Trek convention.)  There's the young woman, Anne Murphy, who has 
idolized the actor who plays "Data" in 'Star Trek:  The Next Generation' -- 
Brent Spiner.  She prefers "Spiner Femme" to the less precise fan names.  
One of the more extensively covered aficionados is an Orlando dentist who, 
along with his wife (one of his dental assistants), has converted the office 
into "Starbase Dental."  The place is packed with 'Star Trek' paraphernalia, 
starship models suspended from the ceiling, cardboard standups of Worf and 
Picard and Crusher, assorted rubber masks positioned atop cabinets.  
Although one of his hygienists took some convincing before she donned a 
signature jumpsuit, the dentist's patients seem to love the original 
approach to office décor.
The film's 86 minutes are filled well with shots of these and other fans, 
along with snippets of interviews with several cast members of 'Star Trek' - 
mostly from the original late 60's series but some from the updates.  An 
aspect employed to insure success is Denise Crosby, the actress who played 
the security chief "Tasha Yar" on 'The Next Generation."  Now in her early 
40's, Crosby acted as a producer, and no doubt supplied contacts with a lot 
of the other actors and facilities.  She does much of the interviewing and 
interacting with the Trekkers; she even shows off some of the mementos sent 
her by fans - such as skillfully drawn sketches of her and fellow crew 
members.  Crosby's screen presence is comfortable and assured.  It certainly 
adds diversity to the narrative elements edited together to tell the story.  
Cinematographer Harris Done helps considerably with his work in the dramatic 
interludes - the short montages used to capture mood.  In one sequence we 
see a quartet of Klingons enter a McDonald's.  The young cashiers look at 
them curiously, and then we watch a wonderful series of Dutch angles, the 
camera canted as the bony-headed impersonators chow down on their Big Macs.
At its best, the film captures the fond ambivalence of the actors toward 
their loyal fans.  Most of these emotions are indeed fond; only occasionally 
does the attitude "Get a Life!" slip out.
The film is to be admired for not condescending to ardent fans.  The notion 
we come away with is these fans are intelligent and compassionate people, 
themselves full of tolerance and the mindset that engendered the "Prime 
Directive" followed by the advanced civilization peopled by Spock and his 
cohorts.  At its worst, the film is a tad too long, and goes in a series of 
circles, the result of portraying a number of individual stories instead of 
a more linear, climactic plot.  But this is a downfall inherent to the 
documentary.
You do not have to be a 'Star Trek' fanatic to enjoy this film.  Its 
built-in satire and wide range of factual storytelling make it charming and 
very watchable.  You will be reminded how many common references and figures 
of speech have come from the show, and you will understand a little more the 
people who pursue all things 'Trek.'

You don't need to be a Star Trek connoisseur to enjoy "Trekkies," an 
affectionate portrait of some the more "colorful" fans of the ubiquitous 
sci-fi phenomenon. The funniest documentary since "Cane Toads: An 
Unnatural History," "Trekkies" draws more belly laughs than any film in 
recent memory, including "There's Something About Mary." 
Working on a shoestring budget with film stock of varying qualities, 
director Roger Nygard copes by editing "Trekkies" in the herky-jerky 
style popularized by MTV. In fact, an apt subtitle for the film would be 
"The Unreal World." Denise Crosby, Tasha Yar from "Star Trek: The Next 
Generation," serves as tour guide into the realm of Trek fandom, setting 
the benign, nonjudgmental tone that makes the feature work so well. While 
I enjoyed Michael Moore's "Roger and Me" and "The Big One," how 
refreshing it is to see a humorous documentary that doesn't batter its 
subjects with snide commentary. "Trekkies" simply lets the fans speak for 
themselves, with hilarious results.   
Working off a "schematic" scrawled on a piece of notebook paper, one 
fellow shows off a glittery ball with assorted attachments. "It's a 
Romulan cloaking device," he explains without a hint of irony, "but I 
think I can modify it to work on a Federation ship." You know, I bet he 
can. Watch a befuddled Radio Shack clerk, eyeing the camera warily while 
the Trekkie shops for parts. Try, just try, to keep a straight face as 
the Uberfan tools down the street in his customized Captain Pike life-
support motorized space-chair, with only his head sticking out of the 
bizarre contraption. As if the spectacle isn't freaky enough, he sports a 
brown corduroy winter hat with earflaps because, hey, it's chilly out 
there.
We also meet Barbara Adams, an employee of the Sir Speedy print shop who 
gained national prominence when, as a Whitewater trial juror, she 
insisted on wearing her Federation uniform to court. "Every day I would 
walk past the reporters with a Vulcan-like stoicism," she says with pride,
 before launching into a sermon on the ideals espoused by "Star Trek."
The original "Star Trek" debuted in the '60s, when the Vietnam war and 
sweeping social changes were turning the country upside down. The show 
presented a vision of a future where mankind not only survived, but 
thrived, with adventurers of varying races and nationalities united as 
they explored the far reaches of the heavens. Despite the mini-skirted 
sexism and imperialistic undertones of the show (as well as a notable 
lack of gays that continues to this day), the optimism of the series 
resonated with a determined group of disenfranchised viewers. More than 
30 years, three TV series, nine films and countless books later, "Star 
Trek" lives on.
There's a sweet naiveté beneath the ridiculous costumes and garish make-
up of these "Star Trek" fans that makes their eccentricities, if not 
necessarily endearing, at least understandable. Faced with a tumultuous, 
uncertain world, they've elected to move to a nicer one. I laughed at 
Gabriel, a 14-year old computer whiz who fusses over the detailing of his 
Federation outfits while over-enunciating multi-syllable words, but I 
also remembered my own painful adolescence enough to like him.  
Some of the folks are considerably weirder. There's the transvestite 
Trekkie who dresses as the nameless wife of some obscure peripheral 
character, the guy considering having plastic surgery done to give his 
ears Vulcan-shaped points, and the "Spiner-Femme" who displays an album 
stuffed with photos of Brent Spiner (Data from "The Next Generation"), 
before aiming her telescope into the distance and wistfully noting that 
she can almost see the roof of the actor's home. Incidentally, I'm barely 
scraping the surface here. Wait until you hear about the "Q" virus!
"Trekkies" gets a bit stuffy towards the end, devoting too much footage 
to testimonials about the spirit of "Star Trek" before recovering with a 
last dash of humor, but that's a minor quibble. The film is an absolute 
hoot, an extremely funny cavalcade of outrageous fans who, outlandish 
costumes aside, are just people like the rest of us. At one time or 
another, we all get passionate and obsessive about something. We may not 
dress like Klingons or wave around phasers, but when you come right down 
to it, we're all pretty damn silly. Trekkies just wear their goofiness 
with pride.
A Discussion with Denise Crosby and Roger Nygard of "Trekkies"
Whether you're filming the founder of the Interstellar Language School, a 
man who legally changed his name to James T. Kirk, or a group of Klingons 
dining at a fast food joint, the trick is to avoid making color 
commentary. That's the philosophy behind "Trekkies," a hilarious 
documentary about Star Trek fandom. "We knew the audience would get it," 
explained Denise Crosby, co-executive producer of the film. "Just let 
them reveal themselves and tell their tales and you'll be touched, you'll 
be moved, you'll laugh, you'll go 'Oh my God, I thought I had some odd 
pastimes!'"
Crosby and "Trekkies" director Roger Nygard talked "Trek" during an 
interview at a downtown Indianapolis hotel. I congratulated Crosby, who 
just finished a year-long break after appearing in "Deep Impact" and 
having a baby, on her personal restraint in "Trekkies." Where many actors 
would have hogged the camera, Crosby served only as a pleasant, subdued 
host to the proceedings. She responded, "It was refreshing, actually, to 
be in that position. I can't stand that bombarding ego that actors have, 
so I was really happy to just kind of... " Nygard finished her sentence, 
saying "Be the Anti-Shatner?" The pair broke into gales of laughter over 
the dig at William Shatner, the notorious ham who played Captain Kirk. 
Crosby threw up her arms and gleefully shouted, "Yes, that's it, I am the 
Anti-Shatner!"
Denise Crosby gained fame as Tasha Yar on "Star Trek: The Next Generation,
" considered by many to be the best incarnation of the venerable 
franchise. Several months into the series' extremely shaky first season, 
she asked to be written out, frustrated with scripts that left her 
standing around far too often. "I was going to become sort of lobotomized 
if I stayed on the show much longer," she said. Ironically, the episode 
where her character was killed offered her a long, eloquent monologue, 
exactly the kind of material she had craved in the first place. "It was 
very beautifully written, and really hit some personal notes, how I 
personally felt about all those actors," she explained. As to the rather 
arbitrary method the writers used to dispose of Tasha Yar, she said, "I 
knew the concept that Gene Roddenberry was after, that my character's 
death should be so unprovoked and so sudden that it would render itself 
horrific, but in hindsight it just fell flat. I think most people felt 
that, here you are killing off a well-loved character and it should have 
been more spectacular."
I asked about one the first season's most notorious episodes, a story 
which reinforced negative racial stereotypes. "We were just talking about 
this," Crosby said. "I think that show will go down in history... people 
will scratch their heads and say 'How did this ever get on the air?' I 
mean, they finally have a planet that's populated with a black race and 
then they present them as savage warriors, and the men want the white 
girl!" Shaking her head and laughing, she went on. "And they speak like 
the guy from the old Cola-nut commercials! Oh my God, I was just rolling 
my eyes the whole time."
In subsequent seasons, when the quality of the show radically improved, 
did she ever regret leaving the series? "You know, I never looked back," 
she answered. "I'm going to be really honest, I've never seen an episode 
since I left the show and I've never seen 'Voyager' or 'Deep Space Nine.' 
It's not that I have some sort of distaste for it, there's just not a lot 
of TV that I do watch. I watch films." "And documentaries!" Nygard 
chirped with a grin.
Crosby remained close with several cast members after leaving the show 
and was pleasantly surprised when the producers invited her to revisit 
her role in a superb time-travel story. The episode, "Yesterday's 
Enterprise," caught her by surprise. "When I left the show, that was it," 
she explained. "I had no plans of ever returning, I was dead. And then 
they called me up and said they had this idea and would I be interested? 
I said 'Absolutely.' They sent me this great script and I thought 'This 
is so clever! This is wild!' I had a great time doing it. And I got to 
work with Whoopi Goldberg, which I had missed due to my departure." 
The success of the episode led to Crosby's idea for another character. 
Sela would be the child of Tasha Yar, born when she traveled backwards 
through time (don't ask). In Crosby's conception, the child would be a 
human raised by the Romulans, enemies of the Federation. "I had a meeting 
with Rick Berman (head honcho for the franchise after Roddenberry's 
death) and pitched the story," she said. "He kind of went away and 
thought about it for a couple of months, then called me and said they 
wanted to go with the idea, but with the slight variation that Tasha was 
pregnant by a Romulan general, so she had a half-human, half Romulan 
daughter." Nygard laughed and added, "Yeah, with the slight variation 
that you don't get paid for the idea!" Crosby appeared as Sela, and was 
invited back as Tasha Yar for the series' grand finale. "I thought that 
was really nice, actually," she said. "That was a surprise. I just had 
wished that Wil Wheaton was there. He was missing from the last show and 
it would have been nice if everyone could have been there."
Crosby met Nygard in 1991, when he cast her in the comedy "High Strung." 
A veteran guest at numerous "Star Trek" conventions, she proposed the 
idea of a documentary about the fans to Nygard, amazed that one hadn't 
been made already. Producer Keith Border financed the film through his 
company and shooting began in 1996.
The team received no help from Paramount, parent company for the "Trek" 
franchise. Instead, they attended conventions, ambushing cast members for 
interviews and eventually shooting 35 hours worth of footage. So when did 
Paramount, distributor of "Trekkies," finally embraced the film? "When we 
had an offer from a competing studio," laughed Nygard. "We always wanted 
to give them the benefit of first choice," said Crosby, "because 'Star 
Trek' is their franchise and I have a history with the studio, but they 
weren't jumping to the mat, so we shopped it around. Our lawyers got back 
to them and said 'We're moments away from letting so and so have this 
film. Does that interest you at all?' Boom. Offer's on the table."
Crosby and Nygard, who is currently finishing "Six Days in Roswell," a 
documentary about UFO enthusiasts, may do a follow-up "Trek" documentary 
focusing on the vast European fan base. They're not overly concerned 
about offending Trekkies. Nygard explains that any fan going out in 
public in "Trek" regalia knows they'll be noticed and possibly laughed at,
 and is willing to accept the consequences. Referring to one fan who 
tools around in a motorized "Trek" space-chair, he said affectionately, 
"That's just his preferred mode of transportation, because it shows his 
love of 'Star Trek.'"

     TREKKIES, Roger Nygard's energetic and hilarious documentary,
brings viewers into the world of the Star Trek conventions.  The beauty
of the film is that it is good old fashion fun for Trekkies and
non-fans alike.  (The film generally writes off the Trekkies vs.
Trekker polemic as not worth arguing about.)  The good-spirited movie
TREKKIES easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of
uncontrollable, loud giggles, yet the picture treats its subject matter
with respect and a certain awe.
     Denise Crosby, who played Tasha Yar on "Star Trek: The Next
Generation," serves as the host.  In the opening credits the movie
reminds us that Trekkies are the only fan group listed in the Oxford
English Dictionary (OED).  (The OED cites a February, 1976 caption in
the "New Yorker" as the first recorded usage of the word.)
     Unless you've been to the conventions, I posit that you have no
idea of the dedication of some of the fans.  One pointed out,
apologetically, that the stripe on his new uniform was slightly
inaccurate.  Others talked about how many Star Trek conventions they
had attended, several dozen being typical and hundreds not unheard of.
     My personal favorite fan is Sir Speedy photocopying worker Barbara
Adams.  Arguably the most famous of all the Trekkies, she wears her
uniform every waking hour as many die-hard fans do.  Her claim to fame
is that, as a juror on the Whitewater trial, she wore it in court as
well.  "Every day I would walk past the reporters with a Vulcan-like
stoicism," she says, describing her way of dealing with the crowd of
reporters who became obsessed with her obsession.  She doesn't quite
understand all of the uproar.  "I'm an officer of the Federation 24
hours a day," she reminds us.  Her fealty to her hobby approaches that
of a religious faith.
     Along with the laugher the show evokes, there is an equal measure
of sincere appreciation for people with such loyalty.  And their
infectious joy provokes a certain envy of their enjoyment.  Few other
avocations could give this much satisfaction.  These people are having
the time of their lives.  (For the record, I'm not a Star Trek fan
although I have seen some of the movies.)
     The film interviews the various Star Trek series's stars as well
as its fans.  The stars had thought the convention idea was a lark and
would soon fade, but over twenty years later, the conventions are still
going strong.
     Filled with anecdotes, the show talks about the happenings at the
various conventions.  At one, the actor who plays Q was so sick that he
thought he would have to cancel.  After appearing briefly, he drank
some water and left.  They decided to auction off his half-empty glass,
joking that it had the "Q virus."  The guy who won the bidding
immediately drank the water and screamed to the crowd that he now had
the Q virus too.  With dedication comes a certain amount of stupidity.
     Not just flitting among people, the documentary takes the time to
let you get to know the Trekkies.  One guy is a Trekkie cross-dresser,
another dresses her cat, and then there is the dentist.  The dentist
has his entire office made up to look like a Star Trek set.  He, his
oral hygienists, his receptionist, his wife, and his kids wear the
outfits all of the time.  It appears that his workers are permitted to
take them off when they go home, but not his family.  For variety, he
and his family do change characters from time to time.  He says his
patients like it.  Well, there was this one complainer, but he had a
problem with his bill anyway.
     There are summer schools for Klingon with Ph. D. linguists to
teach the language.  Hamlet is now available in Klingon, albeit perhaps
not at your local bookstore, and they are working on translating the
Bible.
     They even sell United Federation passports that are real enough
that Trekkies have used them to fool Customs, even U.S. Customs.
     The movie bogs down only briefly when it tries to argue the
series's larger meaning about diversity and humanitarian concerns.
Sandwiched in-between the levity, the switch in tone doesn't work.
     The incessantly up-beat film ends with a singing Elvis
impersonator.  He fits right in.
     TREKKIES runs a breezy 1:26.  It is not rated but would be PG for
brief sexual references and would be fine for all ages.

In the history of American television, no series has attracted as much
devotion as Star Trek. The original series and its progeny have
created a following that contains elements stranger than anything that
ever appeared on the science fiction series. This film is a
documentary that examines the obsession some people have with the
show.
The film is narrated by Denise Crosby, who is a former cast member and
also a participant in the documentary's inquiry. The technique used is
primarily interviews and profiles of particularly possessed
individuals, interviews with current and former cast members
recounting their experiences, and encounters with the show's fandom.
Interspersed with the interviews are many scenes and quick sound bites
from several of the many of the series' ubiquitous conventions, where
fans gather, in complete space regalia, to listen to cast members
talk, buy and sell memorabilia, and generally commiserate with other
fans. The propensity of the conventioneers to dress as characters from
the show creates an odd and humorous mood. It is not unusual to see
people take an interest, but the absurdity of the lengths they go to
is continuously laughable.
What is most compelling is that it is possible to discern several
different types of fans. There are those who digest the moral order
espoused by the show and synthesize it as a personal religion by which
they live. There are some who put all their creative energy into
following the show, like the teenage fan who appraises and trades
memorabilia, and who even developed a computer graphics generated
sketch of an episode based on the series. Some fans are more casual
and do not feel the need to outwardly display their affiliation with
the show but they see the meaning and poignancy developed in the
series' narrative, and they like to discuss this with others. All of
these seem like harmless and quirky individuals who have an interest
but not an unhealthy attraction to the show. However, one type of fan
was unnerving, and that is those who have an obsession with a
particular cast member and character. One woman in particular keeps
her multitude of pictures and other totems connected to her favorite
cast member in a safe, and paints a disturbing picture of obsession.
The primary flaw with the film is that it does not have a focused
theme that it follows through its narrative like a standard
documentary. It meanders between the various interviews with short
convention snippets collected in between. Without a central theme, the
film appears to be little more than a carnival freak show.
Recommended. Judged by the requirements of documentary filmmaking,
this film is lacking in vision by not making a clear statement about
its subject. It is definitely entertaining. Watching the film is
probably more fun as a group activity, since a group of viewers can
laugh together at the odd creatures on screen.
