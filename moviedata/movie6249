I welcome the newness, the fresh look of the King of Kitsch. Quentin
Tarantino's new movie, Jackie Brown, is just that. Bt it's also alot
more. It shows a director maturing. And a mature Quentin is a good thing
indeed.
 Based on the book Rum Punch by Get Shorty author Elmore Leonard, Jackie
Brown revives Pam Grier from a life of blaxplotation retirment, and
Robert Forster, who turns in what may be the film's best performance
(obviously, since it got him that Oscar nomination).
 Grier plays Jackie Brown, an airline stewardess and sometimes money
runner for Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson, who ignites the screen as
always). When ATF agent Ray Nicolet (Michael Keaton) and an LAPD officer
pick Jackie up for running money, she begins to get a scheme.
 Robbie goes to get her bonded,and sees bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert
Forster). And soon after, Jackie is double-crossing all who try to stop
her plan from working. Plus, Cherry begins to care for Jackie, and the
expressions on Forster's face as he watches Jackie from afar or even
talk to her is reminiscent of a lonely little boy in elemenatry school,
eager for the popualr girl's attention.
 Also along for the ride in this Tarantino epic is Robert DeNiro,
suprisingly subdued, as Louis Gara, Ordell's cronie from the days of
yesteryear, and Bridget Fonda as Melanie, Ordell's pot-smoking,
sex-obsessed, tan beach bunny.
 One clever scene involves a conversation and a photo between DeNiro and
Fonda. It is perfectly Tarantino. There are many other memorable
moments, like a POV shoot from three different people. All in all,
Quentin Tarantino's latest film is a winner, and makes one salivate for
his next project. (and the play he's in now, Wait Until Dark) What else
would you expect from the Master of Witty Dialogue? One of the best
films of 1997, and definitely one of the very slim films of recent years
that makes you wish that the film would never end.

JACKIE BROWN (director/writer:Quentin Tarantino; cinematographer:
Guillermo Navarro; cast: Pam Grier (Jackie Brown), Samuel L. Jackson
(Ordell Robbie), Robert Forster (Max Cherry), Michael Keaton (Ray
Nicolette), Robert De Niro (Louis Gara), Bridget Fonda (Melanie),
Michael Bowen (Mark Dargus), Chris Tucker (Beaumont Livingston), 1997)
 An unconventional film adapted from an Elmore Leonard story about
double-crosses and gun smuggling. Former black exploitation picture
queen, Pam Grier, plays the hard luck 44-year-old airline attendant who
works for the gun-runner Samuel L. Jackson in order to supplement her
low paying job (her salary is only 16 grand a year), but she gets caught
smuggling drugs and money in from the Mexico to L.A. flight. She
realizes that she has been set-up, so she cuts a deal with the AFT agent
(Keaton) & the L.A. cop (Bowen) to entrap Jackson, and she makes a deal
with Jackson so that she can continue to take money in for him by
telling him about the deal she cut with the feds; whereby, she can bring
him his half million dollars he got from his guns and she'll get 50 g's
from him for her effort.
What is unconventional about this film is obviously not the plot, we
have seen all this before, but the dialogue that is deliciously witty
and outrageous, every character in the film has something to say that
flies in the face of convention.These are people I wouldn't want to
spend quality time with. I certainly would not want to be exchanging
barbs with them. But I do find them charming on the screen, as I am able
to ignore how inane the dialogue really is and how threadbare the story
is, all because there was too much to like about this film to be over
critical of it (I liked Tarantino's homage to Grier and the '70s, as he
plays some Delphonics soundtracks and introduces Pam's appearance in the
film with a '70s soundtrack of Bobby Womack singing "Across 110th
Street").
This is a film about characters not story line. Bridget Fonda plays the
part of the sex-pot, druggie girlfriend of Jackson, who possesses a
twisted sense of humor that doesn't sit too well with Robert De Niro. He
is the bumbling ex-con and right-hand man of Jackson, reacquainting
himself with the crime scene after just being released from prison,
serving 4-years for a bank robbery. This is a very quiet role for an
actor of his stature, but he performs it as he should, on a low level,
not upstaging the loquacious Jackson. Chris Tucker is the Jackson
employee who screws up and who Jackson bails out of jail and then asks
him as a favor to him if he can get into the car trunk and take a short
ride with him so that he can pay back what Jackson did for him by being
a back-up for him in a gun deal Jackson has going down. The scene is
brilliantly funny, as Tucker tells Jackson why he doesn't want to get in
the trunk. It is funny even after we see and realize the violence that
follows because we don't care what happens to most of the characters in
this film, not even to the rather sweet Pam, though we are somewhat
affected by her desperate situation for a moment or two. But when we
start thinking about where she's at, and even if we realize that she is
forced into being so cunning as a matter of survival, we are still not
that sympathetic to her.
Robert Forster plays the 56-year-old sentimental yet hard-nosed bail
bondsman who falls for Pam and helps her carry off her scheme. He steals
the picture in a low-key, enigmatic performance. He might be the only
one in the film we could care about, and the only one we wonder about,
but, even for him, we do not feel deeply emotional. His silence and
hidden motives are contrasted with Jackson's blatant loudness, and he
comes off rather well. After a while the Jackson character becomes too
much for us to handle and actually starts wearing on our nerves.
The film pulls off its goal to be entertaining, but falls way short of
being as entertaining a film as PULP FICTION. What is noteworthy about
the film is how crisp the acting was. I, especially, liked the way Pam
played her part. It was very believable and without believing her the
picture would have fallen apart. But, overall, the story lacked the kind
of depth needed for it to be anything but a rather well-made and
entertaining film.

     Three in a row.  'Reservoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction' and now 'Jackie
Brown'.  An impressive string of films over five years for Quentin Tarantino
who proves he's the director of his generation with 'Jackie Brown'.  This is
another examination of colourful, low-life characters in the big city
(Tarantino likes the L.A. area) and the amount of violence is restrained and
the innuendo the film uses is brilliantly amplified by its cast.  A
relatively small cast this time as well.  Twelve actors and their characters
were the focus of 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Jackie Brown' has half that number.
John Travolta's first movie after 'Pulp Fiction' came out in 1994 was 'Get
Shorty' in 1995 and that film was based on the novel by Elmore Leonard.  I
wonder if it's just a co-incidence that 'Jackie Brown', Tarantino's first
film as a director since 'Pulp Fiction' is also based on an Elmore Leonard
novel, this one entitled 'Rum Punch'. 
     Pam Grier, a 70's actress is resurrected in the same manner in which
Tarantino brought back John Travolta probably hoping he could salvage
another lost talent.  I don't think this film will do as much for Pam
Grier's career compared to what 'Pulp Fiction' did for John Travolta but she
is a fascinating and strong protagonist who holds her own with the other
actors. 
     Samuel L. Jackson is an illegal gun dealer with Robert De Niro is his
sidekick and 
pseudo partner just released from prison.  Bridget Fonda is Jackson's
live-in girlfriend, Michael Keaton is an ATF (A lcohol, T obacco and F
irearms) agent and Robert Forster has the film's most cleverly under played
role as a bail bondsman helping Grier execute the perfect scam. 
     Grier is a flight attendant with a criminal past who now works for a
bottom rate airline and she's caught in illegal trafficking before boarding
by Keaton and another agent and has to make a deal to help catch Jackson.
Jackson, meanwhile, is attempting to get a friend out of jail using Forster
as his bail bondsman.  Grier works out a scam to get rich, rid Jackson from
her life as he is trying to kill her to prevent her from giving the police
information about his business and she wants to walk away from the
authorities free and clear all at the same time.  It's a very complicated
double cross which can't and for the purposes of spoiling the picture, won't
be explained here. 
     As I'm sure you recall if you've seen the film, 'Pulp Fiction' used a
brilliant patch of returning to previous story lines and didn't tell its
story in total sequence. Tarantino does something similar in retracing a
scene near the film's last half hour which shows many different ways the
characters split and then divulges the consequences of their actions.  I
suppose this format of story telling will be Tarantino's trademark in the
future. 
     I can't stress the point strongly enough that although parallels can be
drawn between any two films just as they've been drawn in this review of
'Jackie Brown' to the points in 'Pulp Fiction', that it is only fair to
judge any movie on its own merit and if you forget about 'Pulp Fiction' and
relax and follow the trappings of 'Jackie Brown', it will be a much more
satisfying experience. 
     The entire cast has just the right amount of spotlight to match their
importance in the film's story line and Tarantino proves again that he has
the perfect skill for making the most important part of any film, the
script, crackle and vibrate with the most memorable dialogue written by
anyone working in today's film industry.

Quentin Tarantino has a remarkable talent.  Not only is he able to director 
cinematic masterpiece and write potent screenplays and stories, but he also 
achieves something that goes beyond experience or credits - he creates a stir. 
Tarantino's knowledge of film came from his experience as a video clerk, and 
because he was never a film school graduate he didn't develop an identical 
style for all his films.  Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown are all 
strikingly different.  This is not to say that they don't bear the same 
extraordinary scents - the dialogues in his films are so delightfully original 
that it is hard to label them as anything else except "Tarantino."
Jackie Brown, his third directing attempt, has a much more adult feel to it 
than Quentin's other films.  It's the story of middle aged adults contemplating 
the rest of their life, their health and desires, and everything that develops 
in between.
Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is a flight hostess who works for a bottom rate 
airline, supplementing her miniscule income by smuggling money into the US for 
gun dealer Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson).  However, after one flight she is 
caught out by an ATF agent (Michael Keaton) and an LA cop (Michael Bowman).  
They offer her a simple deal: go to prison or rat on Ordell.  Either way, piles 
of money is involved.  Ordell has around half a million dollars tucked away in 
Mexico, and becomes desperate to obtain it before it's too late.  
We are introduced to the eccentric life of Ordell, his dim-witted partner Louis 
Gara  (Robert DeNiro) and one of his girlfriends, the happy-and-high Melanie 
(Bridget Fonda).  Sympathetic bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster) is 
thrown in the midst of Jackie's situation when Ordell pays him to release her 
from jail.
So let's examine what we have here: there are seven people and half a million 
in cash.  Each has their own plan, each has their own desires - but the real 
question is: who is playing who?
Obviously, whatever Quentin Tarantino comes up with is going to be compared to 
the mosaic masterpiece that was Pulp Fiction.  But as Quentin himself states: 
"Pulp Fiction is an Opera, this is a chamber."  Although Jackie Brown is much 
more straightforward than Pulp, it is in many ways a better picture.  Tarantino 
shows some camera aspects that are so original it is hard to believe that 
anyone would dare attempt them - one time the cinema screen splits in half 
(showing us two parts of the story), anther time an entire scene is shot in 
almost complete darkness. 
It is with a strong passion for effective film making that Tarantino makes 
Jackie Brown, a wonderfully acted and shrewdly put together film delicatessen. 
 It is a stylish, and very cool, middle aged film.
4 and a half stars out of 5
Maybe not Pulp Fictionbut theirs plenty of cult friction

Caught a special sneak preview last night of Quentin's latest, "Jackie
Brown." What should you expect? A lot of the same, which in this case is
good.
"Jackie Brown" has all the usual Tarantino elements: it's long, it has a
range of characters who all fit together somehow, time shifts in unexpected
ways, there's little romance or sex, violence is random and there are
moments of delicious tension. The difference this time is Elmore Leonard's
complex story about who's scamming who in order to walk away with $500,000
in dirty money, and following the different stories spun by the characters
is quite a challenge. Leonard's story is darker, as characters talk about
growing older rather than about foot massages. This is as much a movie about
life choices and how we screw them up than about the dark pleasures of the
crime underworld.
Pam Grier is, as reported, excellent. She carries the picture without a
hitch and looks great doing it -- it's hard to take your eyes off her and
her crooked smile. And when the '70s music cues on her, it's heaven. Sam L.
Jackson is his usual brash, charismatic self, only this time he's a bit less
lovable than "Pulp Fiction's" Jules. In fact, most of the characters are
harder edged, not having been infused with QT's child-like love of dialog.
DeNiro seems wasted in this respect -- his Louis character is almost
monosyllabic and seems to serve little purpose other than to be Jackson's
sidekick. It would have been interesting (and also a little more predictable
which is probably why QT didn't do it) to have DeNiro and Michael Keaton
switch roles.
But, on the whole, "Jackie Brown" is good for all the right reasons. Like
everything Quentin does, it's both fun and funny.
Interesting sidebar: Just like in "Pulp Fiction," the funniest moment in
this movie seems to be when someone gets shot (I won't spoil the surprise
and say who, but it's the scene in the parking lot).

JACKIE BROWN (Miramax - 1997)
Starring Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Forster, Bridget Fonda,
  Michael Keaton, Robert De Niro, Michael Bowen, Chris Tucker
Screenplay by Quentin Tarantino, based on the novel RUM PUNCH by
  Elmore Leonard
Produced by Lawrence Bender
Directed by Quentin Tarantino
Running time: 155 minutes
Note: Some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers.
      Be forewarned. 
    -------------------------------------------------------------
   During the three years since the release of the groundbreaking
   success PULP FICTION, the cinematic output from its creator, Quentin
   Tarantino, has been surprisingly low.  Oh, he's been busy -- doing
   the talk show circuit, taking small roles in various films,
   overseeing the production of his screenplay FROM DUSK TILL DAWN,
   making cameo appearances on television shows, providing a vignette
   for the ill-fated anthology FOUR ROOMS -- everything, it seems,
   except direct another feature-length film.  It's been the long
   intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which PULP
   FICTION reached which has made Mr. Tarantino's new feature film,
   JACKIE BROWN, one of the most anticipated films of the year, and his
   third feature film cements his reputation as the single most
   important new American filmmaker to emerge from the 1990s.
   Things aren't going well for Jackie Brown (Pam Grier).  She's 44
   years old, stuck at a dead-end job ("$16,000 a year, plus retirement
   benefits that aren't worth a damn") as a flight attendant for the
   worst airline in North America -- and she's just been caught at the
   airport by ATF agent Ray Nicolette (portrayed with terrific childlike
   enthusiasm by Michael Keaton) and police officer Mark Dargus (Michael
   Bowen) smuggling $50 000 from Mexico for gun-runner Ordell Robbie
   (Samuel L. Jackson), who has her bailed out by unassuming bail
   bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster).  The loquacious Ordell, based
   out of a Hermosa Beach house where his horny, bong-hitting surfer
   girl Melanie (Bridget Fonda) and agreeable crony Louis Gara (Robert
   De Niro) hang out, operates under the policy that the best rat is a
   dead rat, and he's soon out to silence Jackie Brown.  Meanwhile, the
   authorities' target is Ordell, and they want Jackie to help them by
   arranging a sting to the tune of a half-million dollars.  Only
   through a series of clever twists, turns, and double-crosses will
   Jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses.
   Although JACKIE BROWN marks Mr. Tarantino's first produced screenplay
   adaptation (based on the Elmore Leonard novel "Rum Punch"), there's
   no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film.  While
   he's adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense, the
   setting has been relocated to Los Angeles and the lead character's
   now black.  In terms of ambiance, the film harkens back to the 1970s,
   from the wall-to-wall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to
   the nondescript look of the sets -- even the opening title credit
   sequence has the echo of vintage 1970s productions.  The opening
   sequence featuring Ms. Grier wordlessly striding through the LAX,
   funky music blaring away on the speakers, is emblematic of films of
   that era.  The timeframe for the film is in fact 1995, but the
   atmosphere of JACKIE BROWN is decidedly retro.
   Of course, nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of
   Pam Grier and Robert Forster as the two leads, and although the caper
   intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists, backstabbing, and
   deceptions deliciously unfold, the strength of JACKIE BROWN is the
   quiet, understated relationship developed between Jackie and Max;
   when they kiss, it's perhaps the most tender scene of the year.
   Tenderness?  In a Quentin Tarantino film?  Sure, there've been
   moments of sweetness in his prior films -- the affectionate exchanges
   between the Bruce Willis and Maria de Madeiros characters in PULP
   FICTION and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of Tim
   Roth and Amanda Plummer, or even in RESERVOIR DOGS, where a deep,
   unspoken bond develops between the Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth
   characters -- but for the most part, Mr. Tarantino's films are
   typified by manic energy, unexpected outbursts of violence, and
   clever, often wordy, banter.  These staples of his work are all
   present in JACKIE BROWN, but what's new here is a different facet of
   his storytelling -- a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant
   emotional undercurrent, and a patience to draw out several scenes
   with great deliberation.  This effective demonstration of range
   prohibits the pigeonholing of Mr. Tarantino as simply a helmer of
   slick, hip crime dramas with fast-talking lowlifes, and heralds him
   as a bonafide multifaceted talent; he's the real deal.
   This new aspect of Mr. Tarantino's storytelling is probably best
   embodied in a single character -- that of the world-weary, sensitive,
   and exceedingly-professional Max Cherry, whose unspoken attraction to
   Jackie is touching.  Mr. Forster's nuanced, understated performance
   is the best in the film; he creates an amiable character of such
   poignancy that when he gazes at Jackie, we smile along with him.
   Much press has been given about the casting of blaxploitation-era
   icon Pam Grier in the lead, with the wags buzzing that Mr. Tarantino
   may do for her what his PULP FICTION did to bolster John Travolta's
   then-sagging career.  As it turns out, Ms. Grier is solid in the
   film's title role, although nothing here forces her to test her
   range.  I do have to take exception to the claim that this film marks
   her career resurrection, though -- she's been working steadily over
   the years, often in direct-to-video action flicks, but also in such
   recent theatrical releases as Tim Burton's MARS ATTACKS! and Larry
   Cohen's ORIGINAL GANGSTAS (where she first teamed up with Mr.
   Forster.)  Of course, it's true that her role here was a Godsend -- a
   meaty a part as this is rarity for *any* actress, let alone one of
   her age and current status in the industry.
   While JACKIE BROWN may disappoint those looking for another PULP
   FICTION clone, it marks tremendous growth of Mr. Tarantino as a
   director whose horizons are rapidly expanding, and whose
   characterizations have never been better.  And while the film's
   narrative doesn't really warrant a running time of 155 minutes, it's
   filled with such sumptuous riches, ranging from the brashness of the
   vivid soundtrack to entertaining, inconsequential conversations
   between the characters, that there wasn't an unengaging moment.  With
   an impressive trio of feature films under his belt, it'll be
   interesting to see what he tries next.

"There was a six-year-old girl sitting near me, and she piped up 'That's
 Harvey Keitel' within seconds of the film's start.  I want to know what
 that kid's been seeing." - Charles Odell

Watching "Jackie Brown" for the second time, still
somewhat confused from its intricate plot of criminal
double crosses, I was reminded of "Get Shorty",
which had the same bewildering complexity.  It turns
out that both films were based on novels by Elmore Leonard,
with "Jackie Brown" an adaptation of "Rum Punch".
But "Get Shorty" was a much lighter film, while
"Jackie Brown" is more tense and violent.
"Jackie Brown", of course, is the third film fortunate
enough to have the talents of Quentin Tarantino
both as a director and screenwriter.  (We won't count
"Four Rooms", a.k.a. "Four Directors")  Elements present
in the first two films are here as well.  There is rampant
violence and obscenities, imaginative casting, scenes
taken out of chronological order, heavy doses of pop oldies
and outstanding dialogue.  While "Jackie Brown" may not
be as great as "Reservoir Dogs", it may actually be better
than the deservedly much-lauded "Pulp Fiction", and has
to be considered to be a nearly complete success.
The title character, an airline stewardess in her forties,
is played by Pam Grier.  She works with violent and
talkative arms merchant Samuel L. Jackson smuggling
currency into the country.  Jackson has several beachfront
properties, sharing them with girlfriends Bridget Fonda,
Lisa Gay Hamilton, and Hattie Winston.  (Fonda fans will
be glad to learn that her druggie "surfer girl" character
gets much screen time and shows much skin.) Robert DeNiro
shows up as Jackson's brooding assistant.
Grier is busted by cop Michael Bowen and ATF agent Michael
Keaton.  Grier, with her liberty, career and life at stake,
devises an elaborate scheme with lovestruck bailbondsman
Robert Forster.  Can she recover the illicit money,
and keep it from both the cops and revenge-minded Jackson?
The score is loaded with pop-soul oldies from the 1970s,
one of the best of which, "Long Time Woman" is performed
by Pam Grier herself.
Tarantino, despite casting African-Americans in the two
most important roles, came under criticism for the script's
heavy use of the n-word.  In my ever-ready opinion, this
word is in the same category for a screenplay as an expletive,
meaning that it can be readily abused but also can be
powerful in the proper context.  In Tarantino films,
expletives are typically used by violent and desperate
criminals, a context which seems appropriate.  I don't
believe that Tarantino's films promote violence either.
Like old gangster flicks starring James Cagney or
Edward G. Robinson, the proponents are unredeeming and
tend to meet death by their own measures.

Chad'z rating: **** (out of 4 = excellent)
1997, R, 155 minutes [2 hours, 35 minutes]
starring: Pam Grier (Jackie Brown), Samuel L. Jackson (Ordell Robbie), Robert
Forster (Max Cherry), Robert De Niro (Louis Gara); produced by Lawrence
Bender; written and directed by Quentin Tarantino; based on the novel "Rum
Punch" by Elmore Leonard.
Seen January 3, 1997 at 3:40 p.m. at The Latham Circle Mall Cinema 9 (Latham,
NY), theater #3, with Matt Perreault and Chris Wessell for $5. [Theater
rating: **1/2: fuzzy picture, good sound, average seats]
        It's funny how basic truths can be misleading. The promotions for "Jackie
Brown" mention something about six players after a half million dollars in
cash, while at the same time playing each other, and for the most part this is
true. However, the hook to the film is not so much the conflict involving the
money, but the way each character relates to and uses the other, and the
detailed specifics of how they interact. 
        Pam Grier stars as Jackie Brown, a black airline stewardess in her 40s who is
doing the best she can to get by. When she is taken into custody by ATF agent
Ray Nicolet (Michael Keaton) for supposedly smuggling in a large amount of
cash, we begin to learn more about her and a shady past (and present) she is
trying to put behind her. We are also introduced to gun-runner Ordell Robbie
(Jackson), a clever, talkative thug who has just been reacquainted with Louis
Gara (De Niro), a quiet, slightly dim-witted ex-con. There's also Ordell's
sexy, but lazy, lady-friend Melanie (Bridget Fonda) whose attraction to Louis
makes for great, unspoken tension. And last, but certainly not least, Robert
Forster as seasoned bail bondsman Max Cherry, who gives an ordinary character
an overwhelming sense of being.
        In "Pulp Fiction" Tarantino was able to tell several over-lapping stories
that served as a both a great anthology and complete story, all strung
together by excellent characterization. Here we get just the opposite - a
chiseled character study which pushes and pulls the plot from all directions.
Where other directors and/or screenwriters might rush to establish and develop
a story as complicated as the one we get here, Tarantino takes his time, which
allows us to enjoy the ride even longer. For example, the basic story concerns
Ordell's efforts to use Jackie to smuggle in 1990S from Mexico, but everyone
else wants (and needs) a part of the scam in one way or another. Jackie wants
the money to buy a better life, but Agent Nicolet needs her to help him catch
Ordell. Max has been smitten by Jackie's charm and wants to help her, but not
put himself at risk in the process. Meanwhile, Melanie distracts Louis which
somewhat botches Ordell's plan, but not enough to further her own agenda.
        This premise may or may not sound complicated, but simply watching how the
film breaks down the plot from story arc to individual scenes and even
intricate shots themselves gives one the sense of awe. This isn't just a story
about people after money, it's a great exercise in character interaction and
what they are capable of. All of the characters may be typical, but their
characterization is not. It's fascinating to watch how a seemingly everyday
person like Jackie can almost single-handedly outsmart the vileness of Ordell
and the valor of Nicolet. Everything she says and does makes complete sense
and seems realistic, while at the same time utilizing Tarantino's pulp-esque
appeal.
        It's remarkable how fluidly the story to "Jackie Brown" flows, especially
considering how it uses violence, double-crosses, and vulgarity to its
advantage without becoming remotely gratuitous. Every character is so
authentic they practically radiate auras, as the witty dialogue and
outstanding performances perfectly enhance each other. At no point is there
any way to tell which direction the story will go next - why can't all movies
be like that?

     Usually my reviews are written before films are released, but what
with the busy crush of openings for the Christmas season, it was not
possible for me to get to all of the press screenings.  I missed the
JACKIE BROWN screening because I always give preference to kid's films.
Even though MR. MAGOO, which screened at the same time as JACKIE BROWN,
proved to be the worst film of the year, I don't regret the decision to
take my son and his friends.
     So it was that I went to JACKIE BROWN late, knowing that some of
the major film critics loved the picture.  As I sat watching the overly
long movie slowly unfold, I began to wonder what was the fascination
that others had found and that I didn't.  Although it was by a
director, Quentin Tarantino, who has made exactly two good films (PULP
FICTION and RESERVOIR DOGS), and although it had more stars in it than
I could count, JACKIE BROWN is a surprisingly mediocre movie.  With
different names on the marquee, I posit that the reviews would not have
been so glowing even if the performances were the same.
     All of this notwithstanding, JACKIE BROWN isn't a bad film or an
uninteresting one; it's just a disappointing movie.  The performances
are okay although I do not see any that are of Oscar caliber as many
are proposing, and its story of a scam usually keeps your attention.
The best part of the movie, written by Tarantino and based on the
Elmore Leonard novel, "Rum Punch", is its nice, albeit too infrequent,
collection of one-liners.
     As illegal gunrunner Ordell Robbie, Samuel L. Jackson plays a part
he's played many times before and better.  Since he only kills a few
people, Ordell becomes almost a pacifist for a Tarantino story.  Half
of the laughter in our audience came from his attempt to cram in the
maximum number of uses of the word "nigger" into the already
profanity-laced dialog.
     The movie's best line has not a racist or profane word in it.
When Ordell opens the trunk of his car to show the dead body in it to
his old, bank-robbing buddy, Louis Gara, played as a semi-senile old
con by Robert De Niro, Ordell gives a simple explanation of who the
corpse is.  "An employee I had to let go," he explains seriously and
without one scintilla of emotion.
     The title role is played by Pam Grier, who started in a slew of
low-budget, black, action pictures in the 1970s.  In her biggest part
ever, she plays 44-year-old airline stewardess Jackie Brown.  Jackie,
who has been in trouble with the law before, now works in a low paying
job at one of the worst air carriers on earth.  She makes up for her
lack of opportunity by smuggling in cash from Mexico for Ordell.
Arrested by ATF agent Ray Nicolet (Michael Keaton) for concealing
$50,000, she devises a scheme to cheat Ordell and the feds out of the
half million dollars that Ordell plans on retrieving from Mexico.  The
scam has a few twists, but it's nothing special.
     In a role that Robert Forster hopes will advance his career out of
the doldrums, he plays Ordell's favorite bail bondsman, Max Cherry.
Ruggedly handsome, 56-year-old Max, with a no-nonsense exterior but a
softer interior, falls for Jackie, but their romance, such that it is,
keeps firmly in the platonic arena.
     Bridget Fonda, looking like a teenager again, is Ordell's "little
blond-haired surfer girl," Melanie.  Dressed in cutoffs and brief
halter tops, she sits with her legs constantly draped over the sofa as
Ordell and Louis talk business.  Melanie has a simple philosophy.  All
she wants to do in life is "to get high and watch TV," which we see her
doing ad nauseam.
     "I'm not your partner," a tough-as-nails Jackie says to Ordell
when explaining her plans to him.  "I'm your manager.  I'm managing to
get your money out."  Jackie is a woman who knows where she's going and
no gun-running murderer is going to get in her way.
     After an intriguing ending told serially from three different
perspectives, Tarantino tacks on a lethargic, feel-good epilogue worthy
of a television movie.
     On the way home, my wife and I discussed long scenes and whole
characters we would have eliminated to advance the story better and
faster.  JACKIE BROWN is just good enough to make you wish it were much
better.
     JACKIE BROWN runs way too long at 2:35.  It is rated R for
violence, profane and racist language, and drug usage.  It would be
okay for teenagers only if they are both older and mature.

Cast: Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Forster, Bridget Fonda, 
      Michael Keaton, Robert De Niro, Chris Tucker
Director: Quentin Tarantino
Producer: Lawrence Bender
Screenplay: Quentin Tarantino, based on the book RUM PUNCH by 
      Elmore Leonard
Cinematography: Guillermo Navarro
U.S. Distributor: Miramax Films
     It has been three long years since Quentin Tarantino stunned the 
cinema world by claiming the Cannes Film Festival's Palme D'Or, a $100 
million-plus box office gross, and an Oscar nomination Â all for his 
sophomore outing, PULP FICTION.  Since then, the talented film maker has 
been virtually invisible, surfacing briefly as a co-director of the 
wildly uneven FOUR ROOMS and the screenwriter of the gory vampire-fest, 
FROM DUSK TILL DAWN.  In between, he has moonlighted as an "actor" with 
several decidedly unmemorable performances.  Now, with much fanfare and 
anticipation, Tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort, 
JACKIE BROWN.  And, while this motion picture, adapted from Elmore 
Leonard's novel, RUM PUNCH, offers solid entertainment, those expecting 
another bravura outing from Tarantino will leave theaters disappointed.  
For the most part, JACKIE BROWN is a pretty ordinary crime movie.
     The story, which starts out slowly, develops into a twisty affair, 
with double-crosses and triple-crosses.  And the movie is littered with 
occasional Tarantino trademarks:  witty dialogue, unexpected gunfire, 
'70s pop tunes, and close-ups of womens' bare feet.  Yet, for all of 
that, the production is something of a letdown.  The sheer, in-your-face 
exuberance that marked RESERVOIR DOGS and especially PULP FICTION is 
absent.  The mostly-straightforward chronology of JACKIE BROWN doesn't 
match up favorably to the non-linear style of Tarantino's previous 
efforts Â an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives.  
And there aren't nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this 
time around.  There's a Samuel L. Jackson monologue about guns, a 
Jackson/Chris Tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car 
trunk, and a Jackson/Robert De Niro exchange that recalls some of the 
Jackson/Travolta material from PULP FICTION, but that's about it. 
     JACKIE BROWN's lone "innovation" is its presentation of a crucial 
sequence from three different perspectives.  This isn't exactly an 
original technique Â it has been done numerous times before, most 
famously in Akira Kurosawa's RASHOMON and most recently in Edward 
Zwick's COURAGE UNDER FIRE.  However, while in those two movies (and 
others), there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points-of-
view, Tarantino's sole purpose for using it appears to be because it's 
unconventional.  Had the scenes in question been shown from only one of 
the three vantages, nothing would have been lost.  As a result, this 
aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity.
     For the second picture in a row, Tarantino is attempting to revive 
the career of a '70s icon.  This time around, instead of John Travolta, 
it's Blaxploitation queen Pam Grier (Foxy Brown has become Jackie 
Brown).  In one of many nods to the most famous segment of Grier's 
career, Tarantino uses a '70s song to accompany her first appearance 
during the opening credits.  There are also several instances during 
JACKIE BROWN when the director offers a sly wink towards certain 
conventions of the Blaxploitation genre (although Grier never does any 
butt-kicking).
     Grier is Jackie Brown, a flight attendant who gets caught 
transporting drugs and money into the United States.  She's working for 
gun dealer Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson), but she keeps her mouth 
shut under questioning, despite pressure from Ray Nicolet (Michael 
Keaton), a Federal official.  No longer sure whether or not he can trust 
Jackie, Ordell arranges for a bail bondsman, Max Cherry (Robert Forster, 
TV's "Banyon") to post the necessary $10,000, then plans to shoot Jackie 
if she proves disloyal.  Jackie passes Ordell's test, however, and soon 
the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle $500,000 of Ordell's money 
into the United States without tipping off the Feds.  Soon, just about 
everyone is after that money, including Jackie, Max, Ray, Ordell's 
perpetually oversexed and drugged-out girlfriend, Melanie (Bridget 
Fonda), and his right-hand man, Louis (Robert De Niro).  
     Unsurprisingly, the most memorable performance is turned in by 
Samuel L. Jackson, but Ordell isn't nearly as invigorating or compelling 
a character as Jules from PULP FICTION.  In addition to looking 
fantastic, Pam Grier is also quite good, although hers is not an Oscar-
caliber performance (although she might get a nomination).  Robert 
Forster and Michael Keaton are solid in their tough-guys-who-rarely-
smile roles.  Bridget Fonda is around for three discernible reasons: to 
look sexy in a bikini, to provide a little twisted comedy, and to 
satisfy Tarantino's foot fetish.  Robert De Niro is criminally underused 
in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy-
looking, middle-aged actor.  
     The film, which clocks in at several minutes over the two-and-a-
half hour mark, is probably too long for the material, but the plot is 
convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout (although the payoff is 
a letdown).  Tarantino keeps things moving along nicely, with a heavier 
dose of humor and less violence than in PULP FICTION, but, on the whole, 
this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than 
something from the director himself.  When it comes to recent caper 
films (like THE GRIFTERS and BOUND), JACKIE BROWN is a second-tier 
effort.  It's an entertaining diversion, but not a masterpiece, and 
certainly not an Oscar contender.

"No art passes our conscience in the way film does, and goes directly to our
feelings, deep down into the dark rooms of our souls"

Author

Starring Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert De Niro, Bridgett Fonda,
Robert Forster
Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino
Rated R for violence and language
How do you follow-up "Pulp Fiction," without question one of the greatest
films of the last decade?    
You shift gears and get serious, which is exactly what "Jackie Brown" 
does, and very well.
Although it's clear during "Jackie Brown's" witty, off beat and colorful
dialogue that it is without a doubt from the same mind that spawned "Pulp",
this film, however, is more low-key and ponderous.   There is a point in
the film where the camera zooms in on Ordell's (Jackson) face at a very
pivotal point-showing the serious anguish on what he has to do next. 
"Pulp"  would never have taken the time to ponder like that.  He would have
just done it and it would be off to the next crazy scene.
Yes, in this film, Tarantino slows down, takes his time, and tells a story.
 And a fairly predictable one at that.  But, what makes this work is the
way its told, with lots of character development-and yes, Tarantino-esque
dialogue.
The film begins with a long shot of Jackie, as she's running through an
airport.  And with the Bobby Womack song "Across 110th Street" accompanying
her, her part is firmly established.  A middle aged stewardess for a shitty
little airline who is (paraphrasing the song) "doin' what she can to
survive".  And in this case, she's running cash for Ordell.  
Samuel L. Jackson plays Ordell with the same panache he gave to Jules in
"PF", but where Jules says he's a "Bad Mother Fucker"-Ordell truly is-in
fact, where Jules finds a religious redemption (bizarre as it may be) at
the end of "PF", Ordell is almost the devil himself.  His dialog is
edgy-hardly a sentence goes by without the word "nigger" in it.  There are
moments when he shows some doubt about what he is doing, but he doesn't let
conscious stop him from doing his dirty job.
Even Robert De Niro and Bridgett Fonda make what could easily be "nothing"
roles shine.  Fonda plays Melanie, who's function as far as Ordell is
concerned is really not much more than window dressing, but Fonda and De
Niro share some of the best moments in the film.  De Niro plays Louis, a
just-released ex-con who, by the critical point in the film, the viewer
wonders the same thing Melanie asks: "How in the hell did you rob all those
banks?"  Both Fonda's and De Niro's roles complement each other-and their
respective demises are fitting in that respect.
Robert Forster plays Max Cherry, the bail-bondsman who manages to forge a
unique relationship with Jackie-and sort of falls in love with her too-just
enough so Jackie knows she can "use" him to help with her caper.  Not that
she doesn't share some feelings in return-but she realizes the position he
is in, and takes advantage of the situation.  Max cherry is probably the
most good natured character ever seen in a Tarantino film to date-he is
pretty much a regular guy who falls for Jackie just when she needs him.
And finally, there's Michael Keaton, who plays the somewhat slimy, by the
book ATF agent, is, by the end,  just another pawn in Jackie's little
scheme.
Chris Tucker also plays the hapless Beaumont, who provides good comic
relief, as well as a tool for Cherry to figure out what Ordell is really up
to.  His brief time on the screen is some of the funniest in the movie.
This film (albeit not quite as fun to watch) is a bit more mature than
"Pulp Fiction".  The craziness that was the signature of that film is
merely used as a tool in Jackie Brown to develop the characters.  If you go
see this film waiting for the witty, in-your-face, quirkiness you loved in
"Pulp", you get it, but it's in smaller doses and it is in service to a
more serious story-that takes itself much more seriously.

Many times when I watch a movie, I'm very interested in knowing what's
going through the minds of the characters up there on the movie
screen.  What makes them tick?  What motivates them?  What makes them
do the things that they do?  Character development is one of the key
ingredients to a good movie when, after sitting through a 2-hour
movie, we finally get to the payoff.  Hopefully, everything will wind
down to a congruously satisfying ending.
Gangsters and hoodlums are an interesting breed.  What fuels their
day?  Is it the money?  Is it loyalty among the underworld?  Is it the
power that comes from sidestepping the laws that are in place?  The
strength of "Jackie Brown" lies within it's writing (thanks to Quentin
Tarantino), in which an in-depth exploration of the minds of several
twisted low-lifes are examined.  Early on, we meet up with the woman
from the title of the movie (Pam Grier), and learn that she transports
dirty money between the US and Mexico for her gun-running boss, Ordell
Robbi (Samuel L. Jackson).  Robbi seems to be the typical crook who
makes his living selling guns to the highest bidder, with the possible
exception that he's an intelligent thinker, is verbally eloquent, and
is consumed with his personal safety.  For example, if one of his
associates is arrested, he rationalizes that his associate must be
killed to ensure his freedom.
Robbi's world is truly chaotic, and skeptically relies on his
dim-witted, right-hand man, Louis Gara (Robert De Niro), and a trio of
women (including Bridget Fonda as a bitchy, opiate-addicted surfer
girl) whose places he uses as hideouts.  His true friend, however, is
only himself, and Jackie Brown knows that.  So, she works on a plan,
with the help of her bail bondsman, Max Cherry (Robert Forster), to
find a way to stay ahead of the police that want to keep her in jail
and to stay ahead of Robbi, who would feel better if she were dead.
These are all smart people, and it will be the smartest one among them
all that will emerge victorious.  Add in $500,000 of dirty money
that's up for grabs and an intense effort to outmaneuver each other,
and the result should wind down to a congruously satisfying ending,
right?  Well...
This movie is rich with character development.  We see Jackie's cool
and collective nature.  Displaying toughness and poise, Grier
successfully carries the movie through it's various twists and turns.
We understand Max Cherry's involvement and attraction for Jackie.  And
we see the ineptitude of Robbi's situation, who is basically a
short-tempered captain of a ship of fools.  I especially liked Bridget
Fonda, who, despite her character's lassitude, seemed to be the
smartest of the bunch.  Indeed, we are treated to some nicely shot
scenes filled with witty banter in a cloak and dagger atmosphere.  But
what we don't get is the great payoff that makes us say "I'm glad that
I sat through that 160-minute movie."  Eventually, the slow pace
killed the sense of urgency, which I felt should have been the reward,
at least for this particular critic.  
Yet, I want to applaud Tarentino's texturally rich adaptation of
Elmore Leonard's novel Rum Punch.  He has a good eye behind the camera
and proves that he has an uncanny capability to engross us with odd
chatter in bizarre situations.  "Jackie Brown" certainly had some of
the intoxicating effects of rum, but ultimately lacked the punch.

Jackie Brown (1997)
Rated R for language, sex, violence, drug use, and offensive dialogue.
----------  Out of 4 stars: ***1/2 (3 1/2 Stars)
Starring: Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Keaton, Bridget Fonda,
Robert De Niro, Robert Forster, and Chris Tucker
Quentin Tarantino seems to have a knack for giving his stars big
careers.  After his PULP FICTION, many actors began receiving many
offers for jobs.  John Travolta made his come-back and is now one of
today's most bankable stars.  Bruce Willis proved his acting chops and
is now considered an actual actor.  JACKIE BROWN, on the other hand,
boasts quite a well known cast, except for the main lead: Pam Grier.
Most likely you have heard of her and seen her in films, but she's
never really had a breakthrough performance (her first film was in the
Roger Ebert-written BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS).  That is, until
now.
JACKIE BROWN is a highly anticipated feature film from Quentin Tarantino, whose last film was the huge hit
PULP FICTION.  After mediocre acting jobs, Tarantino returns to what made his name a household one: directing
and writing.  JACKIE BROWN is the result, and it is fantastic entertainment.  Despite excellent direction from
Tarantino, the cast steals the film, giving one good performance after another.  Pam Grier gives a stunning
performance as Jackie Brown, and she is supported by an incredible mix of talent--Samuel L. Jackson, Bridget
Fonda, Michael Keaton, Robert De Niro, and Robert Forster.  More than likely, you will see a few of these
names in the Oscar pool come Oscar nominations.
Describing a Quentin Tarantino film is very difficult, as you really
can't say much or you spoil it for everyone else.  I will tread
lightly.  JACKIE BROWN opens with an impressive shot of Jackie Brown
(Grier) in a blue outfit walking through the airport.  The camera
tracks along with her, and ends up revealing her occupation.  We are
also introduced to Ordell Robbie (Jackson), who sells illegal guns to
interested buyers...  for a hefty price.  Ms. Brown carries the money
from buyer to Ordell in order to keep the cops away.  However, an FBI
agent (Keaton) and a local L.A. cop (Michael Bowen) are out to find
Ordell and catch him while taking the money.  They try to reach him
through Beaumont Livingston (Chris Tucker), one of Ordell's buyers,
but he mysteriously ends up dead.  They try again through Brown, but
she is hesitant to admit to any wrong-doing.
But after unknowingly carrying some drugs for one of Ordell's friends
(Fonda), she is caught and sent to jail.  Ordell pays her bail through
a bail bond agent, Max Cherry (Forster), and then wants to find out
what she told the cops.  After she claims to have said nothing, she
reveals the fact that she will tell them about Ordell in order to stay
out of prison.  Ordell doesn't like this, but they both come up with a
scheme to throw the Feds and cops off their track.  This scheme seems
to be going as planned, but unexpected occurances may or may not foul
up their goal.
Revealing more would spoil the fun of JACKIE BROWN, and that's the
biggest reason to go see a Tarantino film.  Tarantino seems to have a
fascination with hitmen and unusual predicaments (and slang terms),
but they are always done very well and believably.  His hitmen are
normally cruel, but pleasant, in that nasty sort of way.  They talk
like normal people, except for when doing business, and they are rude
to their girlfriends.  Of course, this is a Tarantino film, and you
know you can expect some awkward situations to arise.  And perhaps the
biggest flaw with JACKIE BROWN is the slow middle section in which the
pace begins to drop.  Of course, Tarantino fixes this by moving onto
the climax of the film, adding a lot of his RESERVOIR DOGS-style
storytelling to it.  Things are told from one person's perspective,
and then from another, and then from another, each time learning more
and more.  This all leads up to a very interesting conclusion, which
decides who is on whose side.
On the technical side of JACKIE BROWN, Quentin Tarantino directs it
with the same style as he did with his 1994 film.  However, this time
around it isn't as nearly as impressive or original.  The writing, on
the other hand, is quite good, although I do find Tarantino's use of
slang terms offensive.  The story jumps back and forth in time as in
PULP FICTION, but it's much more easy to understand.  His previous
film needed a second viewing in order to understand the time
differentiation, but JACKIE BROWN is very simply to follow, especially
considering that the time is given during the "leaps" in time.
Perhaps this is a result of the screenplay being written from the
novel "Rum Punch" by Elmore Leonard.  The dialogue is pretty much
intelligent, and all the characters are fully realized.  The
cinematography is very well done by Guillermo Navarro (who has worked
with Tarantino on previous films) and the editing is very good.  And
as with PULP FICTION, the music is a highlight, bringing back
memorable songs from the 70s and 80s.
The acting side of JACKIE BROWN is unforgettable.  The performances
are incredibly rich, with hidden meaning behind every characters'
actions.  Nothing is quite as it seems, and you can't really tell
which side one person is on.  The real treat, of course, is Pam Grier
who gives an astonishing performance as Jackie Brown.  Her poor living
conditions are superceded by her superior wits, which play an
important role in the film.  Watching Grieg, I could tell what was
going through her mind, even if I didn't know what she was thinking.
Her face portrays a lot of emotion that you can tell when she is sad,
happy, or in deep thought.  Bridget Fonda gives a very good
performance as a druggie couch potato.  I didn't even realize it was
Fonda until I saw her name in the final credits (her performance
actually reminded me of Heather Graham's in BOOGIE NIGHTS).  Michael
Keaton comes across very well, as does Michael Bowen.  Chris Tucker
has a small, but effective performance.  Samuel L. Jackson is very
good, but it seems to me that he was replaying his Jules Winnfield
character from PULP FICTION (although much less cynical).  But no
matter... Jackson is very strong in his role.  Robert De Niro is
actually a little annoying at times, but overall he does a good job as
one of Ordell's perspective clients and friends.  Robert Forster gives
one of the best performances in the film, as he has one of the most
developed characters.  He is present throughout most of the film, and
he holds his own against Jackson and Grier.
JACKIE BROWN is rated R for language, sex, violence, drug use, and
some offensive remarks.  As a film by itself, JACKIE BROWN is a
terrific piece of entertainment, with a complex plot to draw viewers
in.  However, one can not help but compare it to Tarantino's PULP
FICTION, and expect great results.  When compared, it comes up short,
but not that short.  It's a worthy effort, with terrific acting and
some impressive writing from Elmore Leonard and Tarantino.  Perhaps
the best thing about JACKIE BROWN is the discovery of Pam Grier as a
major Hollywood actress.  I can't remember seeing her in anything
(except for a small role in MARS ATTACKS!), but hopefully she will get
many more roles from this one.  Expect to see her name floating around
the Oscar nominations (and hopefully she will even be able to nab
one).

Jackie Brown is not the film you'd expect from the phenom director
Quentin Tarantion.  In Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs he used an
offbeat amount of quirky dialogue spiced with suprising, comic shots of
violence.  Jackie Brown tells us that Mr. Tarantino is the real deal,
making one of the most grown up crime movies I've seen.
In Jackie Brown, based on novel Rum Punch by the wondeful Elmore
Leonard, the title character must outsmart a drug/gun dealer in Sam
Jackson and find time to fall in love with Max Cherry (played by Robert
Forster, WHO SHOULD HAVE WON THE BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR AWARD).  These
scenes are handled with Tarantino's trademark great dialogue and humor. 
The film is also decisivly less violent than his previous and much more
human.
There are two common complaints about this film.  One of them is Sam
Jackson's character Ordell Robbi's use of the word "nigger."  I want to
strain that this is Ordell Robbi saying this and NOT Tarantino or
Jackson.  Spike Lee has spoken out about this very point asking weither
Quentin wanted to be made "an honorary black man."  This is absurd, are
white people not aloud to write black characters? Are white writers not
aloud to have their characters saying offensive material?  Are there not
people who talk the way Robbi does?  Spike you made Get on the Bus, a
movie I appreciated, and the black Lexus dealer uses the word
prevasively throughout his FEW MINUTES of screen time.
The other complaint about the film was the length.  It runs long but was
not at all boring and much better writen that Titanic.  This film also
has many strong performances from Sam Jackson, cute Bridget Fonda, funny
Robert DeNiro, and two great performances from Robert Forster and Pam
Grier.  
On a side note I am very happy to see Pam Grier back in good films.  She
had quite a career in the seventies blaxploitation films.  She was
notable as the one that got naked and showed off her impressive bossom,
and for her charasmatic acting.  Her body left such an impression I
remember one critic of this film complaining that we didn't even see her
shoulders.  She gives a great performance here and in films like Coffy
and Foxy Brown, lower scale but still very entertaining.

Three years and numerous talk show appearances, acting gigs, and media
potshots after the release of his landmark Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino
has finally directed a full-length follow-up, Jackie Brown.  But those
expecting the blood-drenched, trigger-happy Tarantino of old are in for a
surprise--his adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel Rum Punch is a more
mature, only moderately violent, and a most unexpectedly romantic and
moving caper comedy/drama.
OK, I know what you're thinking--a good review from me is just about
guaranteed for Tarantino, right?  No.  I walked into the screening with my
expectations dramatically diminished, partially based on some early
positive-but-not-great notices and the virtual lack of buzz attached to the
finished project.  My expectations were neither boosted nor diminished
further by the amusingly kitschy, retro-'70s opening credit roll, with Pam
Grier's title character moving on one of those airport conveyor belt
walkways, the hard-driving soul of Bobby Womack's "Across 110th Street"
blaring on the soundtrack, and the appearance of a copyright notice under
the film's title card.
Jackie is a 44-year-old, down-on-her-luck flight attendant for Cabo Air
who also works as a money courier for arms dealer Ordell Robbie (Samuel L.
Jackson).  When the Feds, led by ATF agent Ray Nicolet (Michael Keaton),
catch onto her extracurricular activities (without knowing exactly whom she
works for), Jackie devises a complex scheme to rob Ordell of
$500,000--_and_ stay in the good graces of law enforcement, whom she pits
against Ordell.  Figuring into her plan is her bail bondsman, burnt-out
50-something Max Cherry (Robert Forster).
Leonard's basic storyline is pretty standard, but Tarantino tells it in a
straightforward fashion, but not without a certain amount of his unique
panache, albeit slightly altered in some respects.  Predictably, his
dialogue has great snap, but while there are the trademark pop culture
references, they are noticeably in shorter supply--a wise move, so the
speech never distracts from the twisting plot.  His penchant for nonlinear
storytelling shines in a brilliantly handled climactic money exchange
sequence, told three times over, each from the perspective of a different
character; however, that sequence is an exception, for the rest of the way
he uncharacteristically follows the story linearly.  Naturally, this being
a Tarantino film, there is also violence, but, oddly enough, these
incidents are depicted with a minimum amount of bloodshed.  These instances
still shock, though, mostly because the actual depiction of violence is
surprisingly sporadic; there is always the mere threat of it hanging in the
air, and Tarantino milks that threat for maximum tension.
But what makes Jackie Brown so surprising is its (gasp) heart.  For all
the caper antics and profanity, the film essentially boils down to an
earnest love story between Jackie and Max.  At first the romantic angle
plays less like a genuine angle than a joke; when Max becomes enamored of
her at first sight as Bloodstone's classic "Natural High" plays in the
background, it is hard not to snicker.  Also pretty comical is how Max goes
to Sam Goody and buys himself a tape of the Delfonics' "Didn't I Blow Your
Mind This Time" (which becomes the de facto recurrent "love theme") after
first hearing it at Jackie's apartment; he then plays it in his car and
lipsyncs along.  But the underlying romantic nature of their
relationship--which is played out as a mere business alliance--is so
skillfully and subtly developed that I was taken aback by how much I felt
for the pair by the film's close.
Jackie and Max's likability onscreen owes a great debt to the actors who
play them.  As proven by his resurrection of John Travolta in Pulp Fiction,
Tarantino has a great eye for forgotten talent, and he has once again hit
the jackpot with Grier and Forster, who should be Oscar contenders next
year.  Former '70s blaxploitation queen Grier is an immensely appealing
performer; not only is she blessed with a natural beauty and sexiness, she
is able to project a sympathetic vulnerability even when violently showing
everyone who's boss.  Forster, who has long toiled in anonymity in films
such as Original Gangstas (which, as it happens, also starred Grier), is
more than up to the tough task of suggesting Max's love for Jackie without
clearly spelling out his true intentions.  As is the case with Tarantino's
previous efforts, the rest of the ensemble is also solid.  Jackson is his
usual first-rate self, and Robert DeNiro and Bridget Fonda  develop an
irreverent comic chemistry as Ordell's dim loser sidekick, Louis Gara, and
Ordell's beach bunny stoner girlfriend, Melanie Ralston, respectively.
Jackie Brown is not a complete return to Pulp Fiction form for Tarantino;
though the film is consistently engrossing, at 155 minutes, it is overlong
by at least 20 minutes, and the unspectacular climax is quite
disappointing, especially when compared to the terrific money exchange
sequence.  Nonetheless, the very well done Jackie Brown marks the welcome
return of the filmmaker who revolutionized independent cinema.

Harvey S. Karten
   When Jack Dawson held Rose De Witt Bukalter at the aft of
the Titanic in the Jack Cameron movie of that name, he said,
"Do you trust me?"  Rose did.  She held her arms wide and
leaned over the swirling waters of the North Atlantic ocean. 
Her confidence proved accurate.  Though Jack seemed
irresponsible as seen through the eyes of the upper-class
passengers who scorned his class, he is consistently
accountable--far more so than the snobs riding the ship on
the upper deck.
   By contrast, Quentin Tarantino's film "Jackie Brown," among
the most talked-about openings of the year, features a parade
of characters who are the very antithesis of trustworthiness. 
They lie, cheat, steal, and above all betray one another to
such a degree that we wonder whether any criminals would
be caught without the betrayals of their fellow lawbreakers--
who are willing to tell all to the authorities if such disclosures
would save their tails.  With the one exception--a rare
relationship between the title character played by Pam Grier
and an honest, but burned-out bail bondsman performed with
particularly quiet eloquence by Robert Forster--"Jackie Brown"
holds that there is no honor among thieves.
   Given Quentin Tarantino's audacious,  film "Pulp Fiction"
three years back, it's no wonder that this one is being
received with impressive anticipation.  While some may leave
this drawn-out episode disappointed in its relatively mild tone
(most of the violence takes places off camera), others will
cheer Tarantino's reigning in of mayhem to concentrate on the
developing connection between the white bail bondsman and
the black stewardess.  There is much to cheer in the film. 
Based on Elmore Leonard's novel "Rum Punch," Tarantino's
screenplay highlights witty dialogue, hard-edged action, and
most of all an attitude toward crime which is joky without
being irresponsibly dismissive.  Pam Grier's casting in the
central role of a seemingly defenseless, down-and-out woman
in her forties rather than a post-pubescent bimbo, is daring
enough at a time that Hollywood has scant enough lead roles
for females in obvious middle age.
   The opening moments set the tone.  As the credits role,
Jackie is shown heading through the corridors of Los Angeles
airport like an icon, her stony face and Mona Lisa smile
projecting both determination and vulnerability.  Stopped at
one point by two law-enforcement officials, one from the
Alcohol, Firearms and Tobacco Agency (Michael Keaton), the
other from the L.A.P.D. (Michael Bowen), she is busted for
smuggling in $50,000 cash which she retrieved from her
departure airport in Mexico and asked to cooperate in return
for a reduced sentence.  Her initial reluctance to collaborate
followed by her apparent willingness to help the officials catch
bigger prey is just one example of the betrayals which flood
the film from its cynical beginning to its stifled upbeat windup.
   In the role of chief villain, Samuel L. Jackson proves once
again that no one else can read Tarantino's dialogue or
respond to his direction like him.  Playing a salesmen of
illegal firearms who has hired Jackie Brown to bring $500,000
which he has stashed in Mexico, Jackson is Ordell Robbie, a
intimidating man with blazing eyes, a fierce determination, a
set of impossibly ludicrous wigs, and an apparent loyalty to
his small gang of petty thieves.  He keeps the beautiful but
perpetually stoned Melanie (Bridget Fonda) as one would
tend a pet Afghan, at one time encouraging his bank-robber
henchman Louis (Robert De Niro) to enjoy her supple frame. 
His only fear--that members of his band may talk if arrested
and promised a deal by the prosecutors--keeps his trigger-
finger itchy.  His casual execution of Beamont Livingston
(Chris Tucker), whom he bails out of jail, cajoles into the trunk
of his car, and then shoots, is shown in Tarantino's typical
clowning style.  Tucker, a fast-talking veteran of prancing
pictures like "Money Talks" and "House Party 3," is his usual
self here, refusing at first to stash himself in that closed
compartment, then coaxed into it by the man who got him
released from prison.
   After Jackie Brown's arrest, Ordell's defense are again up,
but he appears for a while to trust her to carry in the
remainder of his loot with the promise of a decent
commission.  Little realizing that his nemesis would be not the
L.A.P.D. or the A.F.T., but rather a middle-aged, middle-class
white man who befriends Jackie and identifies with her even
to the extent of buying soulful tapes for his car radio, he
remains only dimly aware that Jackie would expertly play
Ordell off against both the authorities and the members of his
gang.
   In the movie's most structurally effective scene, Tarantino
hones in on a scam which takes place in a boutique shop
involving Jackie's switching of shopping bags with Melanie. 
The scene is shown from three points of view: from that of
Jackie, who slips the bag with the alleged $500,000 under the
dressing room door to Melanie; from that of Melanie, who
soon has a tussle with Louis for possession of the bag; and
from that of Max Cherry, the bondsman who watches all with
a sly smile of appreciation on his somewhat wan but curiously
attentive face.
   The success of Tarantino's "Jackie Brown" as a wily
parable of crime and its consequences poses a challenge to
Spike Lee's view that primarily black movies must be helmed
by black directors.  Featuring a great soundtrack and a
panoramic view of assorted banal locales in southern
California, "Jackie Brown" is a slick, sly, soulful story of
paranoia, misgivings, a dominant theme of vengeance and a
tone of whimsy.  Rated R.  Running Time: 155 minutes.  (C)

I have a feeling many people will be let-down when seeing Quentin
Tarantino's follow-up to "Pulp Fiction" as it is not a "Pulp Fiction." 
Or a "Reservoir Dogs" for that matter.  It's not a hip, non-linear
morality play, doesn't contain any big speeches on popular culture, and
doesn't have a ton of shoot-outs, blood, or a lot of gore.  "Jackie
Brown" is all about simple pleasures, telling us a simple story
motivated entirely by characters.  It's not a retread of either of his
films, yet still remains amazing in its own right, which means one
thing: That's right, Mr. Tarantino is the Real McCoy.
I've read a couple Elmore Leonard novels, and the great thing about him
is that he creates a world that's so seductive that it's almost a pity
that it has to end.  He tells simple crime stories, filled with
characters who are living breathing people.  They have a vernacular all
their own, and they clash off of eachother, creating the storylines
entirely from them.  None of them are stuck in a crime story, they're
stuck in the crime world.  And instead of Quentin doing his own schtick,
he has adapted one of his novels ("Rum Punch"), and it's about time,
because seeing his others films, you know it's a perfect duo.
"Jackie Brown," which is the name of the protagonist changed a bit to be
an homage to that old Pam Grier classic "Foxy Brown," is a simple story,
made complex by the characters.  It centers a middle-aged flight
attendant, Jackie Brown (Pam Grier, getting a career lift, after all
those years of crap Segal flicks), who has a side-line of running gun
money for a small time arms dealer in Compton: Ordell Robie (Samuel L.
Jackson - who else could have done this role?).  The cops have caught
her, and they give her a choice: either spill the beans, and probably
definitely be killed by Robie...or do some time, which would mean she'd
be screwed for life, since she's 44 and all, and a flight attendant.
Meanwhile, a bail bondsman named Max Cherry (Robert Forster, who's
biggest thing other than this was a starring role in that John
Sayles-penned creature feature, "Alligator") who meets Jackie when he
gets her out of jail for Ordell at the beginning, and falls deeply in
love with her.  The two begin helping eachother out and all, and we get
a nice tender love story going on which never feels forced or corny
(thank god).
Also in on the film are two ATF agents (Michael Keaton and Michael
Bowen), who are working with Jackie; a dim-witted ex-prison con named
Louis Gara (scummy-looking Robert DeNiro), who's working with Ordell;
and the beach girl/pot head Melanie (Bridget Fonda), who has a lot of
wit in between her inhalations.  
What's interesting is that all of these characters have intelligence,
and are never restricted by the plot.  These characters do a lot of
talking, and there are some scenes where they're just hanging out that
are just as fascinating if not more than the suspense sequences.  I
loved the scene where Melanie and Louis were talking about a picture,
mainly because it was so excellently written, acted, and subtely
directed.  He pulls us into a world where the characters reign, and lets
us drop in on them just chilling.  That's what's great about Tarantino.
The plot is complex and all, yet simple.  What I liked about it was how
it was never overwhelming, and how it was never in the foreground.  Even
Jackie being caught by the police was justified since one of the
less-intelligent characters gave her away.  Tarantino's characters have
never been as well-defined than in this one, and his dialogue has never
really been as brilliant, in respects to the way he makes the characters
sound like real people.  Sure, there are no big speeches about European
McDonalds, and even no great one-liners like "I'm gonna get medieval on
your ass," but he allows us to get drawn into the characters, and never
overwhelms us with anything else.
The acting from everyone is flawless.  There's not one bad performance
in the movie.  Pam Grier gives the performance of her career, hitting
every single note of her character, and making her seem first and
foremost like a person.  After all, it's kind of a biographical
character.  Here's a woman who's had some good things happen to her (the
whole blaxploitation thing in real life), but is stuck doing a crap
thankless job (flight stewardess in the movie; bad films in real life),
and has a chance to get away rich (the half-a-million in the movie; the
movie in real life).  Watching her in this movie, even I wanted to cast
her in a movie of mine.  She's amazing.
But she doesn't do the best acting job.  That award goes to Robert
Forster, who needed a career face-lift because he's never really had a
big career.  Older than Grier is, he provides the film with heart, and
gives a flawless performance as the older bail bondsman, stuck in a crap
job, and possessing a bit of puppy dog love for Grier.  Watching him act
is one of the true simple joys of watching "Jackie Brown."
Everyone else is great too.  Samuel L. Jackson is predictably brilliant,
shouting out the N-word over and over and over again (last night on
Charlie Rose, Quentin discussed this, and said that's how someone like
Ordell really talks - and also talked about the whole Spike Lee being
pissed off again spiel). DeNiro fits perfectly into the world of
Tarantino (maybe he and Keitel can finally get a film together where
they actually have some good screentime), also hitting every single note
of his character.  Fonda is amazing as the pot headed beach bum who's
motivation it is to get stoned and watch TV - I loved her in every
single scene she had.  And Keaton has a small part, but utilizes it
wonderfully, without every going "Beatlejuice" with it.  Christ Tucker,
who has a very small one-scene role is hilarious without getting too
"Fifth Element"-y (in fact, it seems like he took some well-needed
prozac).
But the best thing about this is Quentin, the man on the marquee (do you
think people are rushing to see this for Pam Grier?).  He's still in
love with every single frame, and it shows.  His style's still in tact,
but it's more subtle this time, to reflect on the state of mind of
Jackie, who's worn out.  This works brilliantly, especially since this
film wouldn't work with anything outrageous.  There's no ear cutting or
male rape; and there are only a few shocking scenes, and even they
aren't really shocking.  There are so many things I loved about this
film that I couldn't even list them since it would go on forever.  
At a running time one minute longer than that of "Pulp Fiction," the
film would seem to go on foerever.  But he directs this leisurely, and
we just chill with the characters.  Quentin directs this like a grown-up
blaxploitation film, starting off with a typical blaxploitation opening
(which hints at the opening of "The Graduate"), with Pam looking all
cool, then shows her just going to work.  This kind of maturity is what
"Jackie Brown" is all about.  This is the film that shows that Quentin
can actually direct.
Along with "Titanic," this is the best film to see right now.  It's a
damn-near flawless little piece of film noir, filled with excellent
characterization, and just the right bit of hipness.  I looked hard but
could not even find one thing wrong with the film.  Every single thing
is in tact with the film.  This is not "Reservoir Dogs" or "Pulp
Fiction."  It's "Jackie Brown": a completely different film.  And that's
what I loved about it.

RUNNING TIME: 154 MINUTES (2 HOURS 34 MINUTES)
STARRING PAM GRIER, SAMUEL L. JACKSON, ROBERT FORSTER, BRIDGET FONDA AND
ROBERT DE NIRO.
DIRECTED BY QUENTIN TARANTINO
Before starting, I'll get the obvious out of the way first. Jackie Brown is
not as good as Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction. Right, now I'll get to
reviewing the film on it's own (without comparing to Tarantinos previous
films) Jackie Brown, based on the novel Rum Punch by Elmore Leonard, is the
story of an air stewardess, called Jackie Brown (Grier) who has the chance
to sneak off with $1 million dollars. To do this, she must enlist the help
of bondsman Max Cherry (Forster), and try to fool Ordell (Jackson), an arms
dealer who kills anyone he thinks will blab to the police (including Grier)
and dopeheads Melanie and Louis (Fonda and De Niro) who plan to steal Griers
money. Along the way, she must also use the help of cop Ray Nicloet (Keaton)
who wants to take Ordell down.
Throughout the plot is Tarantino typically good dialogue, and some good
performances from Grier, Fonda and Forster. Tarantino has written another
good script, but it seems more restrained because he is working from a
novel. Somehow, the script never reaches the dizzy heights of Pulp Fiction
(1994), which is a shame. Tarantino is a great scriptwriter, but not such a
great adapter. He needs more creative freedom. Hopefully, he won't adapt
another book after this movie. I have not read the novel Rum Punch, so I
don't know how close the characters are to to the book, but the performances
were all pretty good. Grier, a former blaxploitation star and seen recently
in Mars Attacks! (1996) is good as Jackie Brown, delivering a suitably 'hard
ass' image (although it's difficult to believe she could be an air
stewardess.) Jackson is practically repeating his role as Jules in Pulp
Fiction, which is a shame. His character isn't very interesting, but he is
funny, and he has some of the best one liners in the movie. Fonda is superb,
and very sexy, as dopehead Melanie, but she hardly features in the film. De
Niro, like in Copland (1997), is seemingly on auto pilot. Forster is
excellent as the burnt out Max, with a suitably gravely voice, and some good
acting. The audience relates to his character the most.
However, the audience just doesn't really relate (with the possible
exception of Jackson and Grier) to the other characters. Most of them are
flat and two dimensional. This is a shame, and all the characters have
potential which is never fully developed. Considering the running time, a
little bit more effort could have been based on reinforcing the characters.
Also, Tarantino seems to be directing on autopilot. Apart from some split
screen and a generally good final 30 minutes, the direction is plodding, and
nowhere near as good as (sigh) Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction.
There's a good soundtrack, however, and the dialogue can get good.
Jackie Brown, overall, is good, entertaining, and never really gets boring.
However, I guess I just came into the cinema expecting more, and the film
never really delivers. Although disappointing compared to Reservoir Dogs and
Pulp Fiction, on it's own, Jackie Brown is an above average crime thriller.
OVERALL RATING= *** OUT OF *****
REVIEW BY DAVID WILCOCK

Author
E. Benjamin Kelsey
Do film critics have morals? Are there any unwritten laws an ethical movie
critic would or should follow? Naturally we don't want to go into a film with
any preconceived notions, which is pretty tough but something we all have to
accomplish. Secondly, and along the same line, we can't prejudge a film
because of it's stars, director, etc. The difference? Well, in the first one,
we'd go into a film thinking it's going to be dumb or it's going to be good,
and that would affect our viewing (that movie sounds and looks dumb, so I'm
not expecting much). On the second hand, we're simply assuming it will be bad
or good because of a personal "grudge" against the film company (It's made by
Disney? Oh, it's just a merchandising ploy then), the actors (Jim Carrey's in
it? It's gonna stink!), or the director (who? can't be that good). This is
more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint. Make
sense? Ok, but what about comparing? Isn't that kind of along the same lines?
When we compare a certain actor or director or even composer's credibility in
one film to another they were involved in, is that really fair? Sure, in
sequels you can expect and accept comparisons a lot more, but what about
JACKIE BROWN, for example? Is it fair for me to take the review and turn it
into a comparison of PULP FICTION, just because Quentin Tarantino directed and
wrote the screenplay for both?
I think it is, and I'll tell you why. A good critic should be able to view the
film from the "average joe (or jane)" viewpoint, while still taking into
account the artistic integrity behind the film. Sometimes that can be tough.
"The acting was superb, but I was bored" or "I loved it!! It was sooooo
cheezy!" might be used to describe a film. These are contradictions, and a
critic has to weigh both sides and come to a suitable balanced critique. But
which is more important? And which is better? An extremely well shot and acted
film that is boring, or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to
again and again? Getting back to the point, my philosophy on comparing films
being fair works because we're reflecting what the public wants to know
anyway. Every average person out there who's interested in this film is likely
to ask "How does it compare to PULP FICTION?" And so, as a critic, I'm already
responsible to ask that same question.
JACKIE BROWN stars Pam Grier, the "Blaxploitation" heroine from the 1970's,
who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title
character. Tarantino's PULP FICTION is in big part responsible for John
Travolta's sudden revival in the movie industry, and with talks of an Oscar
nomination, the same is likely to happen for Grier. (We've made it thru
comparison #1!) Jackie is a 44-year-old airline stewardess who brings in extra
cash, and probably her main revenue, by smuggling large sums of money into the
United States for Ordell Robbie (PULP FICTION's Samuel L. Jackson and
comparison #2). Ordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted
the aid of Louis Gara (Robert De Niro), a bank robber who just got out of
prison after serving four years, to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half-
million dollars.
Trouble arises when Jackie is stopped by ATF agent Ray Nicolet (Michael
Keaton) and taken into custody for possession of narcotics, as well as having
more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed. Naturally this
proves an obstacle to Ordell's plans and, not as friendly intended as we'd
hope, he posts Jackie's bail after she is put behind bars. The thing is,
Ordell is in this for no one more than himself, and as we learn from his
previous actions, he's willing to kill anyone who stands in the way. Jackie
finds herself in a tight squeeze. Ordell won't think twice about taking her
out if she fails to help him as she's always done, yet at the same time, a
compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against Ordell
was provided. It comes down to a simple question: would Jackie rather face
Ordell or prison?
What ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question
who Jackie is really out to help: the law, Ordell, or maybe just herself.
Coming into play is another 70's veteran, Robert Forster as Jackie's bail
bondsmen Max Cherry. Max's obvious fondness for Jackie will become a major
benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system, and Forster plays
him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance. Also involved is
Ordell's "surfer girl" girlfriend Melanie (Bridget Fonda), a ditzy sun-
bleached babe who spends her time watching TV with a bong in hand. Fonda does
the best she can with an essentially thin role, but there's nothing more to
her, and therefore, she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise
flourishing bouquet of characters.
De Niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few
bucks for himself. De Niro is a brilliant actor, but a character who hardly
ever speaks doesn't need a De Niro to play him. Compared to PULP FICTION
(comparison #3), the characters in JACKIE BROWN and very thin and replaceable.
In PULP FICTION, even the small, seemingly irrelevant characters were
wonderful, complete, and lifelike, whereas JACKIE BROWN has such common
figures that it wouldn't have suffered much with a lesser talented cast, the
exception being Grier. Tarantino wrote this script with Grier specifically in
mind, so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth. Sadly,
Grier too could have received a bit more attention, especially when the story
is all about her newly-jarred perception of life.
Jackson teams up with Tarantino again, but the chemical reaction isn't as
awesome as the first time. Jules was the rambling, bible-quoting hitman in
PULP FICTION, and Jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off. And
although Jackson is really, really good in JACKIE BROWN, I don't think he's
quite as irreplaceable. In fact, maybe a new face would have been better.
Jackson could've remained Tarantino's Jules, and a new guy could have become
Ordell, forever to remain so in our memories. Sadly, these characters are too
much the same, except Ordell just isn't as impressive, and putting this in the
hands of Jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections
of Jules. Another problem is that Ordell is way too focused on in the
beginning. This is Grier's film, so why spend so long getting to know a man
who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses? It not
only makes the movie feel a little too slanted, but it makes for a slow
beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story.
It is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to
be those anxious to partake of Tarantino's quirky dialogue and eccentric
directing style, and not so much those interested in seeing a silver screen
adaption of Elmore Leonard's novel "Rum Punch". For those movie-goers, don't
expect another PULP FICTION and you'll be satisfied, for the script oozes with
the familiar brash qualities that has made Tarantino an icon of 90's film-
making. The directing has toned down a bit, however, yet we're still reminded
that this is Tarantino's movie thanks to odd split-screen story-telling
devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints. So
getting back to the question that I began with, this isn't PULP FICTION at
all. It's good, but it isn't anything that made PULP FICTION such a
revolutionary effort in the first place. This is a more conservative
Tarantino, but not one that won't satiate true fans. If you can realize that
this isn't going to knock your socks off, then you'll be happy to at least let
it massage your feet. After all, we all know how much Tarantino loves that
particular part of the human anatomy.

I walked into the cinema with a strangely familiar, sick feeling in my
stomach; my head spining the words, ÂOh God not another Tarantino film.'
PULP FICTION actually nauseated me with it's bloody lack of respect for
life, and the dread feeling that I was about to be hit with another bout
of movie onset vertigo re: Jackie Brown, airline hostess, money
laundering, smart pussycat in high heels, andÂÂ
We have none of that usual excessive Tarantino, violent sick shit of
bullets spraying flesh, blood, parting heads from body, riddling torso,
an absolute lack of self-control permeating the likes of hits like PULP
and RESERVOIR DOGS. None of that Quentinessential nonsense hindering
this film, although some scenes do come perilously close. Instead I
found a likeable mix of down town funky 60-70's tunes (Tarantino always
has a good ear) matching the heartbeat of the movie. Also a cleverly
thought out plot and stylish look of direction not too dissimilar to
PULP, but without the high body count. Style and Look is the word, and
Quentin's eyes captures the soul of his character's, each have
distinctive personalities and motivations, and the dialogue is as sharp
as Quentin can get it.
So Ms Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is a gal in strife, an independent woman
in her 40's who has to out talk, out smart the likes of a murderous, gun
dealer Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson), his hardened criminal henchman
(Robert De Niro) and the feds (Michael Keaton and pal). Up for grabs is
half a million and Jackie Brown is out to secure it.
Pam Grier is wonderful as the beauty with brains and a cool disposition
that matches her leggy heels and panty hose. She has the Look. Samuel L.
Jackson merely reprises the street wise, foul mouthed pretentious
intelligentsia that shocked and humoured everybody in PULP FICTION. He
excels in these stereo type roles. His co-partner in crime, the always
reliable Robert De Niro, is unfortunately miscast as a rather lifeless,
boring sidekick, a role which should perhaps have gone to someone
equally lifeless and boring. I haven't seen Bridget Fonda give such a
good performance, since IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU. She glows on screen like
a bride or pregnant mother, but her character is that of a slut Â oddly
charming.
An overall well performed, disciplined Tarantino exercise into movie
making, which is moderately entertaining.

     A lot of the reviews I read for Jackie Brown started to sound the same. 
 Too long, bringing back Pam Grier like Travolta, yada yada yada.  So I 
wrote my own thoughts down which I haven't had time to do in some time.  I 
cut through a lot of crap like re-telling the plot which you already know if 
you watched it.  Everyone said Jackie Brown was too long and self indulgent. 
Guess what - so is my criticism, read it or not!
     First off, Tarantino didn't have to cast Pam Grier for this role.  
There were no other options.  Pam Grier IS Jackie Brow. In my book it's a 
beautiful thing that Tarantino has written this role, better yet, this MOVIE 
for Pam Grier.  Altering Elmore Leonard's original title of "Rum Punch" 
(What's that mean any ways?) and Jackie's last name to more closely fit 
Grier's persona as the 70's biggest female blaxploitation star (Actually, 
Grier was one of the biggest box office draws of the 70's - period).  
Jackie's description could be Grier's - Strong but aging, black and 
beautiful, still working but having seen better days. Grier plays Jackie 
with above all - determination.  Like James Brown howled, "Got to get over, 
'fo we go under" - Grier and Jackie both get over magnificently.  Might as 
well stick to casting since the other characters DID have to be cast.  
Samuel Jackson as Ordell - excellent of course.  I've read some people say, 
"He's pretty much like Jules in Pulp Fiction".  No, he's not really much 
like Jules at all.  Jules Winfield was the real thing.  Ordell is a 
wannabee.  Unlike the real Macks with a whole stable of 'fly ho's' Ordell's 
has three - a stoner, a simpleton, and an chubby loon.  He put's on gloves 
like I used to do pretending to be David Hasslehoff in Knight Rider.  He 
wants to be important, a player... and that is why he must surround himself 
with the likes of Lewis, Beaumont, Melanie, Sheronda, and Simone - they are 
less bright than he and thus to him he's the Man. Ordell's character is a 
lot closer to the one Jackson played in John Paul Anderson's "Hard Eight"  - 
an up and comer who is pulling some strings, but can't close the bag (I'm 
speaking of the character of course, but the same might apply to Anderson). 
 Robert Forster as Max Cherry.  I'm unfortunately somewhat unfamiliar with 
Forster's 70's T.V. and B-Movies work.  Nevertheless, it was all the more 
surprise to see such a great performance from this 'unknown'.  Max Cherry IS 
a "Cherry" (Virgin) of sorts... I don't think we know if Max is single, 
divorced, or what, but it's obvious he has lived a calculated life somewhat 
removed from a more sexual or emotional existance... much too calculating to 
know what to do when he is smitten by Jackie Brown. Poor Max calculates 
until the very end, and as his time runs out he can't compute the options 
fast enough.  Forster plays Max with the all the restraint required as his 
prominent role could have been easily overplayed.   Keaton as the cop.  It 
works I guess.  In Tarantino's world cop's are generally a. White and B. 
Dorky and Keaton performs both with ease.  He's fairly on the ball, but he 
like Ordell, has a long way to go - if you want to BE the man, you gotta 
BEAT the man right?    Bridgette Fonda as Ordell's "Little Surfer Girl" 
Melanie. Perfect. Bridgette=Gidget?  Good to see her do something 
substantial, Singles and Bodies, Rest, and Motion seem like eons ago.  Maybe 
get a new agent?  Chris Tucker as the short lived Beaumont Livingston - just 
fine - Tucker is perhaps the blackest of the young black actors.  Easily 
black enough to hang with Jackson and Grier.  If Chris Rock hadn't 
overexposed himself and done so many goofy commercials perhaps he would have 
been the one getting in the trunk?  Last but not least - DeNiro as Lewis.  I 
had some problems with this.  I first thought, "DeNiro can't play such a 
looser!".  Then I thought.. "But he played two of the greatest losers in 
film history".  So what was the difference?  DeNiro before played sick, 
angry losers.  Here he is asked to simply to be a stupid, sad, looser in 
which some stupid, sad, looser should have been cast.  The role was beneath 
Bob, but DeNiro gives Lewis all he possibly can muster with such a limited 
task.  Ok, that's casting.  Tired yet?  Too bad.
     Now where?  Direction?  Tarantino's direction is a major break from his 
previous works.  While Tarantino is still quite indulgent with the camera, 
he is more restrained than before.  Absent are Tarantino's post modern 
tendencies - the "new" new wave tendency of drawing attention to the film 
itself. Gone are the prefabricated gaffes, stylized deaths, slowed motion, 
cartoon boxes drawn in the air, etc.  Jackie harkens back to the 70's ultra 
realistic, slowly spun crime tales such as Friedken's French Connection or 
Lumet's Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, and the Anderson Tapes (Tarantino is no 
doubt a fan of all).  And while Dogs and Pulp were comprised from so many 
different bits and pieces and styles - in Jackie, Tarantino invest in a
singular style - (will this be called "his own" now?) which is something he 
really hasn't done before.  I could find no distinguishable film references 
in Jackie in either dialogue or shots other than one mentioned later.  One 
might say this was because it was an adaptation and not Tarantino's own 
writing - yet I believe this was a deliberate action by Tarantino to hush 
the loud mouths who said he has no talent as a director above and beyond 
homaging other's works.  It wouldn't be that hard to make film references 
regardless of the source material...  Danny Boyle took Irwin Welsh's 
Trainspotting and meshed a wide range of references from the likes of A Hard 
Days Night to a Clockwork Orange.  Again, I believe it was a deliberate 
choice.  One of Tarantino's smaller trademarks does survive... the POV shot 
from the car trunk now appearing in 4 Tarantino movies.  Another difference 
is in the look of the film as Guilermo Navaro must have been a cheaper 
Cinematographer than Andrzej Sekula who worked on Dogs and Pulp.  I liked 
Sekula better, but Navaro's images seem a little brighter and sharper which 
does work ok with the more realistic style of Jackie. 
     Ok, what about those 2 obvious 'tricks' that Tarantino does use in 
Jackie?  The Split Screen, and the repeated time sequence.  The split screen 
job might be considered an all-purpose homage to 70's film making (see QT 
favorite De Palma use it in Carrie or Norman Jewison back in 68 in a 
probable QT favorite the Thomas Crown Affair).  The shot is ballsy.. but 
masterful.. it would be difficult to envision the scene being done any other 
way after viewing it.  Secondly, the repeated time sequence.  I read others 
say it's similar to his previous non-linear time constructions. Again, 
totally different.  Previously Tarantino has taken the entire story and 
shuffled it, overlapping small portions creating a disjointing effect on the 
narrative that takes multiple viewings or some brainstorming to figure out 
exactly what DID happen.  In Jackie, the same small portion of the story is 
told exactly the same way, three times, from 3 different view points.  This 
actually increases the amount of information received, instead of 
diminishing it (of course, not much to think about later).  Prominent (and 
hard working) internet critic James Berardinelli likened it to Rashomon or 
more recently Courage Under Fire - yet those tales were repeated multiple 
times by different narrators and each narrator took his own liberties with 
the story and each version is told with direction to reflect the differences 
(well, at least Roshomon was).  I think the sequence in Jackie to be much 
more akin to Stanley Kubrick's "The Killing" where a strictly objective 
camera captures a heist from multiple view points and angles.  From one 
angle, a character is merely peripheral while the other character does HIS 
important task.. yet switch the angle to the peripheral character and now we 
see what HE is going through while the other character is now just a figure 
in the distance.  Thankfully there is no narrator to explain things to us as 
was needed in the Killing, but Tarantino does include a (visible) 'stop 
watch'  just as Kubrick provided an oral one to help out.  I think it's a 
fascinating use of film technique to tell the story. Is it necessary?  Of 
course not.  Then again, what in film really is?  They could have just 
filmed Jack Palance in an easy chair reading the story and it would be just 
as good right?
    The music - typical Tarantino fair?  Again, not really.  Not much of  
the surf and rockabilly of Pulp, and barely any of the 70's pop / rock which 
permeated Dogs.  Tarantino has turned to some fine, fine soul music.  More 
importantly, most (but not all) of the songs are used in a genuine manner - 
not as ironic counterpoint,  as could have been expected from the guy who 
had a cop beat to Joe Tex singing "I Gotcha" and brutal assaults set to 
"Stuck in the Middle" and "Commanche".  Tarantino treats these songs with 
much more respect and actually repeats songs as 'Themes' (every good hero 
should have one) for his characters which is something he has not done 
before.  The Delfonics "Didn't I Blow Your Mind This Time" scores the 
attraction between Jackie and Max.  An incredibly nasty instrumental tune 
which I have no idea what the name or artist is (Since it's an instrumental 
AND since they left it off the soundtrack) plays when Ordell is laying forth 
his halfbaked but nefarious plans.  Jackie's theme is "Across 110th Street" 
by Bobby Womack, incredibly telling for the character - "Pimps trying to 
catch a woman that's weak", "Doing whatever I had to do to survive, I'm not 
saying what I did was all right.."  The movie opens and closes with the song 
and to those (like me) who hold such soul music near and dear to their 
hearts, Jackie mouthing the lyrics while departing haven risen above her 
predicament is a pretty stirring moment.  This deep fried soul is no doubt 
much less accessible to the average Tarantino demographic from his previous 
two films but to those who have an appreciation for black music (and film) 
should really, really, really dig it.
     Well, I've just about covered most of the things I had in mind to say 
about Jackie Brown.  Lastly, some small themes and or sub text I picked up. 
 Usually it takes two viewings for this, so they are a bit scarce now.  
First is the somewhat obvious theme of "age" in the film.  Looking back, 
Tarantino's previous films do touch on the subject...  in Dogs everyone is 
to respect the Elder Joe Cabot who is referred to throughout as "Papa" or 
"Daddy".  More so in Pulp Fiction - Marcellus tells Butch he is too old to 
realize any dreams of being a contender.  Jules quits the business declaring 
"My ass is retired".  Travolta gained pounds as it was important that 
Vincent also be a hit man past his prime.  The Wolf is an elderly statesman, 
he tells his girlfriend she should "respect her elders".  In Jackie, most of 
the 'bad guys' are aging. It's not so much sub-text because they talk about 
it openly, but it's an interesting theme nevertheless.  Lewis coughs and is 
a bit too old for sex with Melanie (and on a separate thought.. has his 
incarceration made him more comfortable with front to back sex?).  Max and 
Jackie talk about how they are getting old while listening to a selection 
from her vinyl collection (at this point there is also some clever innuendo 
concerning how "black coffee" would be fine).  Any ways, I wonder if this 
theme of aging is something Tarantino has highlighted or created (perhaps 
some Allenesque paranoia exists in Tarantino?) or if this was merely part of 
Leonard's character traits that he chose to remain faithful to?  Lastly, 
some symbolism in a reverse fashion from Reservoir Dogs (literally, 
fashion).  In RD, the Dogs start the movie dressed immaculately in the super 
cool black and white retro-fitted suits made famous twice before by the 
likes of Godard and Woo.  As the film progresses though, sunglasses are 
lost, jackets tossed, and white shirts come un tucked and blood soaked.  
Jackie Brown encounters the reverse - as her situation improves, so does her 
outfit.  Jackie starts in her Stewardess uniform - nice enough, but a symbol 
of her, well, shitty commercial job.  She goes downward to "County Blues" 
and bathrobes and other unflattering attire.  But as Jackie is on the rise, 
she dawns a tight fitting red dress and is filmed notably more attractively. 
 Finally, with the execution of her plan - she purchases a chic, 70's style 
pant suit - black and white - not so much unlike the black and white duds of 
both the Dogs (before they all got trashed)  and of Jules and Vincent 
(before they had to dress like 'A couple of dorks'). This is no doubt 
nothing new to film as symbolic colors and wardrobe have always been 
important to the best film makers - but it's attention to such details that 
I believe will keep Tarantino among those great ones in the years to come.  
     Was Jackie Brown too long?  I can't hardly stand people objecting to 
the length of a film as a criticism for 'what's wrong with it'.  A bad film 
can be too long.  How can a good film be too long?  Why do people go to 
spend big bucks on a movie, and then bolt from the theater like they have 
something better to be doing?  I make it a point to get a seat before the 
trailers start.  I love trailers. By the time they are through I'm already 
through a box of Jr. Mints.  I watch the movie, I get comfortable, I focus 
on the whole screen and try and take it all in.  I listen to the music, and 
then when it's over I WATCH THE CREDITS.  Why not?  Is there not music 
playing on a sound system that costs thousands of dollars?  Aren't you in a 
comfy seat with a climate controlled environment?  Don't you want to see the 
songs and artists?  Do you know any of the people Tarantino thanked at the 
end of the credits??  Did you see the beautiful Jackie Brown logo in 198 
point "Boogie" font scroll up the screen to close the credits?  How about 
the inserts in credits of L.A. Confidential?  Are you watching the movie 
because you like film or you are killing time?  If you answer the latter, 
that's fine - we all need to kill some time.  It's just disheartening for 
people like me to hear an artist's work criticized for being too long simply 
because some folks's inability to relax and let those 'important' things 
rest for a few hours and REALLY take in a movie.
     Overall, Jackie Brown is not a monumental film.  It's almost as much 
pulp fiction as Leonard's novels are - entertaining, but somewhat 
forgettable.  No one will quote Ordell or Jackie on a daily basis.  The 
Simpson's won't have a homage to it.  Furniture commercials won't start 
featuring soul music.  But, it was a very, very good film and one that lets 
the load of 'what comes next' come down of his back.  Hell, I feel more 
relief than he does now that's it's over and done with.  It proves Tarantino 
is not a 'one trick pony'.  It shows a great deal of consistency when fellow 
film makers who were declared "Auteurs" after one film are failing miserably 
on their second and third.  It shows a definite turn towards a more serious 
style of film making, and perhaps, if he wants to make another, will lead to 
another monumental film.
Any comments or corrections are greatly appreciated.

Director: Quentin Tarantino
Cast: Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Forster, Bridget Fonda,
Michael Keaton, Robert De Niro, Chris Tucker
Rated R: Profanity, sex, drugs, violence
by Nathaniel R. Atcheson (nate@pyramid.net)
    Only Quentin Tarantino can make violence, drugs, lust, and bad
people this appealing. There's something so witty and downright fun
about these evil people and the horrible things they do. They way they
talk to each other in profanity-laden inner-city dialect, the way they
can't even manage a sentence without some kind of mind-altering chemical
running through their veins, the way murder and sex are used as
thoughtless tools--these elements, though completely unpleasant in
theory, always manage to make themselves likable in a film by Tarantino.
Jackie Brown obviously is no exception to this observation. It's a two
and a half our character study on a bunch of people that, for the most
part, are rather despicable.
    First, there's Ordell, a drug-pushing criminal who kills people in
his sleep. Played by Samuel L. Jackson with that kind of volatile
hilarity that only Jackson can manage successfully, we laugh at Ordell
even though he's a psychopathic monster. Every bit of concern and
consideration he shows is ultimately for his own good--he cares for no
one.
    Ordell's partner in crime is Louis (Robert De Niro). Louis is slow,
probably because he takes in more marijuana smoke than air. Louis is
also a murderous psycho, but only out of instinct. The flashes of
violence he shows are clearly beyond his control, although he can't
express this disability of his because he has basically no control over
the English language.
    Ordell's "surfer girl" is Melanie (Bridget Fonda) whose existence is
limited mostly to smoking, watching TV, and having sex with whomever is
nearby. She also likes to make people mad by patronizing them, and she
has no loyalty to anyone.
    There are some nice people, though. Pam Grier plays the title
character, a luckless flight attendant who gets nailed by a couple of
cops (Michael Keaton and Michael Bowen) with $50,000 in her bag. She has
the money because she's a carrier for Ordell; she makes very little
money as a flight attendant, but Ordell pays her well. The cops try to
cut her a deal, but she resists. Ordell, of course, thinks she's going
to rat him out, so he tries to kill her and fails.
    From this point on, the characters engage in a twisted sort of tag,
in which everyone is out to get a certain sum of money from Ordell.
Jackie enlists the help of the other nice character in the film, Max
Cherry (Robert Forster, in the film's best performance), who is Ordell's
bail bondsman and an ex-cop, and they manage to play everyone else.
    This film is so entertaining and energetic that I found myself
completely submerged in its reality through the entire running time. The
characters all have such strong chemistry among one another that
watching them interact in this conniving, back-stabbing manor is
embarrassingly fun. The relationship between Max and Jackie is
especially well-done, and surprisingly moving towards the end.
Tarantino's characterizations are right on, and he never misses a beat
with his calculated direction.
    I've heard some people say this film is boring; others talk about
the fact that it centers around immorality and that none of the
characters have any redeeming qualities. If you find this film dull and
overlong, then there's not much I can say--you must have some kind of
resistance to well-written and fleshed-out characters. If you don't like
these people and despise their actions, then that's even more of a
reason to see this film. In the last ten minutes, Tarantino makes it
perfectly clear that he doesn't condone the actions of these people. I
felt pretty safe in his hands knowing that the people in the film that I
liked would come out of the situation unscathed.

Aside from "Reservoir Dogs" and "Pulp Fiction," Quentin Tarantino has not
exactly grabbed audiences with some of his later work. Anyone care to remember
his minute directing bit for the awful anthology "Four Rooms"? Except for the
over-the-top "From Dusk Till Dawn," Tarantino was in danger of overexposure
since he appeared in dozens of less-than-wonderful supporting roles in other
directors' movies. Now, at last, comes Tarantino's first major film as writer
and director since "Pulp Fiction," and what a joy it is to see him back.
"Jackie Brown" is Tarantino at the top of his game - foul-mouthed, wickedly
funny writing with ball-of-fire performances by the whole cast. 
The titled character is played by glamorous, former blaxploitation star Pam
Grier as a 44-year-old airline stewardess who's carrying smuggled money from
Mexico to a suave arms dealer, Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson). Jackie,
however, is eventually apprehended and arrested by two ATF agents (Michael
Keaton and Michael Bowen) as she arrives in California. She doesn't want to
spend the rest of her days in jail so she cuts a deal with the agents to
double-cross Ordell (and, naturally, the agents) out of his remaining
half-million dollar stash. The switchover is to take place in a less
conspicuous rendezvous - a mall.         
Ordell's own life is always on the fringe. He has to contend with his beach
bunny, pot-smoking girlfriend Melanie (Bridget Fonda) who reluctantly answers
his business calls, and his sedate partner Louis Gara (Robert De Niro) who
continually smokes pot with Melanie. Ordell bails out Jackie by talking to the
taciturn, sensible bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster) who has been in
the business for far too long. When Max escorts Jackie out of jail, he becomes
deeply smitten by her. She loves the Delfonics, particularly on vinyl. He goes
out and buys the album on cassette, not understanding why she hasn't succumbed
to the "CD revolution." What develops is a sweet, subtle love story that is
quite unusual for Tarantino, but he handles it with grace and vigor.         
"Jackie Brown" is an unusual crime picture - it is slow, stately and handled
with refreshing restraint. There are no car chases, no heads are blown up and
there's not much gunfire. There are only four murders in the entire film and
they are handled discreetly. Did I say this was a crime picture? You bet. If
you're expecting the loud, pumped up volume of Quentin's earlier work, you'll
be sorely disappointed. Based on Elmore Leonard's solidly good crime novel "Rum
Punch," Tarantino's colorful, fast-talking writing is the movie's main star,
and his rhythmic dialogue has not failed him. 
Another major plus is the star-studded performances. Samuel L. Jackson is
terrifically engaging as the murderous, long-haired Ordell who is
simultaneously trying to support three different girlfriends and run a
business. He has a great scene, one of several, where he tries to coax "former
employee" Beaumont (Chris Tucker) into going in the trunk of his car. 
Robert De Niro does a great job playing the unbelievably stupid, oily Louis who
has a brief fling with Melanie. De Niro goes ballistic towards the end (during
the switchover) in one of the most riotous scenes in the movie. Bridget Fonda
is also cast against type as the flirty, naive Melanie who claims to "know as
much about guns as Ordell does."
Pam Grier and Robert Forster, however, are the main attractions of this film.
They both imbue the screen with a certain maturity and level of growing old
with grace that is both sweet and regaling. Grier exudes sex appeal, toughness,
charm and intelligence in various stages of distress and romantic interludes -
she has no qualms about sticking a gun at Ordell's privates. Forster gives a
beautifully modulated performance of understated humor and panache; it is one
of his best character roles since "Medium Cool." Academy Award nominations are
certainly in order here. 
"Jackie Brown" is longish and suffers somewhat from Michael Keaton's mannered
performance, but it is always entertaining and involving. It brims with many
pleasures and surprises, and there are the trademark pop-culture references and
sudden shocks of violence that are a major part of Tarantino terrain. Chock
full of snappy 70's tunes, "Jackie Brown" is Quentin's most accomplished work
by far - a twisty, exhilarating, revisionist take on film noir crossed with
pulp fiction.

JACKIE BROWN entered theaters with little fanfare and a lot of
expectation.  Even though advance publicity on this one was fairly
limited, the audiences waited for the showings with heightened
anticipation.  This is, after all, the first movie Quentin Tarantino
has directed since the highly touted PULP FICTION.  To say he has been
inactive in between would be to tell a falsehood, since he has been
involved in such projects as DESTINY TURNS ON THE RADIO, DESPERADO,
FOUR ROOMS, and FROM DUSK 'TIL DAWN.  He was also called in at the
last minute to help punch up the screenplay for CRIMSON TIDE.  (I'm
willing to wager the debate over which Silver Surfer is the only true
Silver Surfer was penned by him.)  Tarantino contributed on and off
screen to these films, but never took the director's helm.  Nearly
four years since gaining notoriety on the Hollywood scene and making
John Travolta a star once more, Tarantino returns with a film he can
call his own.
The film opens up with an homage to THE GRADUATE, with Jackie Brown
(Pam Grier) on one of those airport people movers as the credits are
displayed in front of her.  Jackie is a flight attendant for Air Cabo,
which flies back and fourth between Los Angeles and Cabo San Lucas.
This makes Jackie a convenient cash courier for gun dealer Ordell
Robbi (Samuel L. Jackson) who is currently keeping his money stashed
in Mexico.  However, while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into
the U.S. for Ordell, Jackie is apprehended by FBI agent Mark Dargus
(Michael Bowen) and ATF agent Ray Nicolet (Michael Keaton), who catch
her not only with the money, but with a bonus of a couple of ounces of
illicit drugs.  Jackie didn't know they were in the package with the
cash, but that's of no consequence to the authorities, who threaten
Jackie with a couple of years hard time if convicted.  Of course,
Dargus and Nicolet are just using the sentence to get Jackie to turn
over the big fish, Ordell.
Ordell uses honest bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster) to get
Jackie out of jail, but while Max is immediately attracted to her,
Jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety, since Ordell
killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up by the police.
Sure enough, Ordell shows up at Jackie's apartment that evening and
tries to silence Jackie for good, but she "borrows" Max's pistol and
manages to turn the tables on Ordell.  Instead of closing the irony
circle and relocating a bullet from the pistol's chamber to Ordell's
head, Jackie proposes a deal.  Since Ordell wants to get his money out
of Mexico, Jackie will get back up to her old tricks and be a courier
for him once more, but this time for a more substantial fee:  Fifteen
percent of Ordell's half million dollars.  With a gun in his face, how
can Ordell not agree?
By itself, this premise might have been interesting enough to carry
the film.  However, we are also introduced to a number of double
crosses which make us pay attention and think.  Jackie claims to be
bringing the money in for Ordell, but she's also making a deal with
the feds as well as with Max.  The film throws us off every once in a
while by leading us to believe the deal we thought was authentic is
actually a sham, but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel
jerked around.  Instead, it's actually a nice departure from the
predictability which is prevalent in so many of today's movies.  At
least this film has a little imagination.
Most of the performances in JACKIE BROWN are above par.  Pam Grier, of
whom I had never taken notice before, plays Jackie with a mix of
confidence and vulnerability which makes her character believable.
Samuel L. Jackson has a kind of mesmerizing quality about him as he
handles himself in situations where you know he is in total control.
Robert Forster is thoroughly likable because he comes across as such
an honest guy, trying to do his best..  Never mind that he belongs to
a profession where sneaking into a guy's apartment to zap him with a
stun gun is simply a matter of course.  He's just so down-to-earth,
the nature of his job really doesn't occur to us, even when we're
shown him bringing a handcuffed woman to prison, or when we see the
tools of his trade.
In supporting roles are Robert De Niro as Louis Gara, a recently
paroled friend of Ordell's, and Bridget Fonda as Melanie, one of the
girls Ordell keeps around town.  Unfortunately, De Niro is basically
wasted as his lines are few and far between, and then they are mostly
clipped sentences.  In this film, he's not really De Niro, but
STEREOTYPICAL De Niro, uttering things like, "Little bit," and "Pretty
much."  Fonda, on the other hand, plays the slightly spaced-out
Melanie with satisfactory relish and cuteness, such that even when she
is annoying Louis, we are taking her side.
As is characteristic of any film in which Tarantino has had a hand,
the dialog is quick and snappy.  It grabs our attention and is
actually interesting, and in many respects, this makes JACKIE BROWN a
film which needs few visuals; the lines are a form of art in and
amongst themselves.  Don't count Tarantino out when it comes to using
the camera, however.  There's a scene where Max is unwittingly
watching a dry run of a money exchange, and he's not really sure
what's happening, but by composing the scene just so, his realization
of what's going on is felt simultaneously by the audience.  We look at
the screen and think, "Gee, that's clever," and then think the same
thing about how the film induced us into that wonderful feeling of
catching on.
Although Tarantino isn't afraid to drag out a shot for dramatic
effect, it unfortunately works to varying degrees in this film.  There
are shots where a character is simply driving, and we watch this
person and somehow get an idea of what is going on in his or her head.
This is a tribute to both direction and acting.  However, there is at
least one other scene where we follow Jackie through a mall, and she
is looking for something; desperately looking for something.  We get
the idea of the frantic nature of her search, but we follow her for so
long that we end up not really caring about what she's looking for,
but instead hoping she'll just stop.
Overall, viewing JACKIE BROWN is time spent well.  Some flap has
already been made about the language used in the film, but it's really
not much worse than many of the other movies out there today.  In
fact, one might even be able to say that the way in which these
"offensive" words are employed almost cause them to parody themselves
and therefore transcend their own offensiveness.  Go see the film and
see what I mean.

Synopsis: 
Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) - -  an impoverished stewardess for a dumpy
airline - - makes money on the side by smuggling cash from Mexican
buyers to LA gunrunner Ordell (Samuel Jackson). She is caught smuggling
by Ray (Michael Keaton) - -  an agent from the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, and Firearms. Now the ATF wants Jackie to testify against
gunrunner Ordell, and Ordell wants Jackie very dead. Jackie tells Ordell
she'll fool the ATF and smuggle him half a million dollars from Mexico.
She tells the ATF she'll fool Ordell and they can catch him in the act
of receiving fifty thousand smuggled dollars. Her real plan is to have
the ATF arrest Ordell, and then pocket Ordell's half million dollars
herself through an elaborate ruse involving a shopping mall dressing
room - - so that she can finally live happily ever after with her
boyfriend Max (Robert Forster). Will Jackie's scam succeed?
Opinion:
JACKIE BROWN is fairly enjoyable but two things bug me. First, it takes
a whole hour for the movie to explain and set up the initial situation. 
After that, there is nothing left for the audience to figure out for the
next hour and thirty minutes. Once Jackie reveals her plan to Max in the
beginning of the movie, it seems the whole caper goes off predictably
without a hitch, twist, surprise, or problem. It's just a matter of
seeing the mechanics of the thing, and one scene is shown three times
(through the eyes of three different characters) to make sure we
understand how the money is switched. Still, it is kind of nostalgic
hearing the 70s soundtrack and seeing action gal icon Pam Grier get
tough on crime like the good old days. Of course, Tarantino throws in
some side characters with flippant, slang dialogue.
Director:
Director Quentin Tarantino is a master at elevating old B-grade movie
stuff to the status of A-grade retro. Like Woody Allen, he always gives
us amusing neurotic characters with hip dialogue. The difference is,
Tarantino's neurotic characters are always TV trivia savvy, and his bad
guys are likely to be violent. Sometimes Tarantino's movies seem to be a
collage of scenes or vignettes put together into a film mosaic.
Personally I would love to see Tarantino direct a sequel for the JAMES
BOND or SCREAM movie series because of Tarantino's talent for mixing
homage with edge. The Bond movie could pay homage to previous Bond
movies, while SCREAM 3 could add action to the horror whodunit series by
being about kung fu video trivia fans being stalked by a masked karate
killer.

Jackie Brown
Director: Quentin Tarantino
Starring: Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Forster, Robert De Niro,
Brigette Fonda and Michael Keaton
Approx Running Time: 150 min.
The problem that "Jackie Brown" will face is that it will always be compared
to "Pulp Fiction", and that's a battle "Jackie" will lose. 
Tarantino's first full-feature directorial effort since "Pulp" is a well acted
and well written crime caper. But through the brilliantly developed
characters, the realistic and gritty dialogue, and the signature of one of
America's newest hotshot directors lies a dull and uninteresting story. As I
sat through "Jackie Brown", I realized how much I liked the characters, and
cared about them, but hated what they were doing. 
Tarantino seemed to involve himself so much in developing Elmore Leonard's
characters (the film is based on Leonard's novel "Rum Punch") that he lost
sight of the fact that the story he drags out over the two and a half hour
time period is mundane to say the least. Every time I got lost in the
intensity of any given character, it seemed that the storyline whacked me in
the face with something too common to be in a Tarantino film. 
Before I get to the good stuff, one last complaint must be brought up. Michael
Keaton was terribly miscast in the film and brought down each scene in which
he appeared. The problem was that his character was too ordinary for such a
recognizable star to be overplaying him. Keaton was the only character flaw in
the film.
Now, for those of you that can't get enough of "Pulp Fiction", rest assured,
Tarantino lets you know that they guy who directed that one, did this one.
There are a number of things in "Jackie Brown" that reminded me of his last
film. Some were distracting, some weren't. Just as in "Pulp", Tarantino makes
brilliant use of one of the screen's best actors, Samuel L. Jackson. His
character, Ordell Robbie, is almost like Jules decided not to walk the earth ,
but instead decided to be a "badder muther fuc*er" and ended up here. Both
Ordell and Jules have striking similiarities, but this guy is ten times the
tyrant. Jackson is unforgettable in this film and has some of the funnies
lines as well as the most chilling glares.
Music plays a big part in the film. At times it seems destined to be a top-
selling soundtrack comprised of songs that are popular again because  they
were in a Tarantino film, but he manages to capture the mood of so many scenes
that the music fits the scheme perfectly.
Pam Grier did a smart thing by letting Tarantino cast her. Though it may or
may not do for her what "Pulp" did for Travolta, Grier, at the very least, has
shown people that may have forgotten about her that she is a good actress, and
that she deserves more recognition than she has gotten in the past twenty
years. She plays Jackie Brown, a flight attendant who runs cash from Mexico to
LA for Ordell. The film losely focuses on her struggle to keep Ordell happy,
the FTA happy, the cops happy and herself alive. She seems to have deals going
in all different directions that culminate in a sadly unsatisfying ending.
Robert Forster is also a man who is being brought into the spotlight as Max
Cherry, a bailbondsmen who gets wrapped up with Ordell and Jackie. He gives a
very strong performance which , though deserving of recognition, will probably
be overlooked come awards time. He has a tough look, but we see how normal and
lonely he is. He is never a fun guy, but for some reason (and by some reason I
must mean the script and the actor) we really care about him. At times, he is
the central part of the film.
Both De Niro and Fonda turn in exceptional performances as completely lame
people. Fonda's character is a life-long pothead and slut; she excels at it.
De Niro's character, Louis, is quiet and has few lines but uses them
effectively. He plays a man who has just been out of prison for a few days,
and he really looks and acts like it. Watching De Niro is still a thrill after
all these years.
Tarantino has left his mark, and "Jackie Brown" will command its portion of
discussion and respect, but will most likely suffer in the long run from a
lack of newness. The only way someone like Tarantino can continue to be fresh
is by writing his own material. Though he breathed fantastic life into these
characters, it was, above all else, merely an adaptation of someone else's
work. On the strength of this film, I look forward to his next screenplay. He
seems to have shed the "one hit wonder" label with "Jackie". And I think
Tarantino learned one other important thing; he doesn't have to be in all his
films. He wisely chose to stay out of this one and let the other actors do
their jobs.

In the three long years since the release of the dazzling "Pulp Fiction," 
Quentin Tarantino fans have wondered if the maverick director has still 
got it. The answer is yes, but he's really slowed it down. "Jackie Brown",
 adapted from Elmore Leonard's 1995 best-seller "Rum Punch," is a 
sluggish, but satisfying character study masked as a crime caper. While 
Tarantino's revered hair-trigger pacing is absent, he reveals new depths 
of filmmaking skill, while presenting some exceptionally well-drawn 
characters. The film hints at a level of substance beyond his trademark 
barrage of pop culture references punctuated with flashy violence. It 
appears that little Quentin may actually be growing up just a bit.
Closely adhering to Leonard's novel, while adding his own unique sense of 
flair, Tarantino introduces Jackie Brown (Pam Grier,) a middle-aged 
flight attendant in a heap of trouble. Caught transporting money and 
cocaine into the States from Mexico, Brown faces a stint in prison unless 
she gives up the identity of the man she's working for. Unfortunately, 
that man is weapons dealer Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson,) an 
extremely violent type with a penchant for murdering snitches. Faced with 
the prospect of jail or death, Brown proposes setting up a sting with ATF 
agent Ray Nicolet (Michael Keaton) to nail Robbie. Meeting with Robbie, 
she proposes using the sting to double-cross the cops, while slipping a 
half million dollars into the country right under their noses. Then she 
huddles with bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster) and asks for his 
help in twisting the sting into an elaborate triple-cross. If successful, 
Brown could get Robbie out of her life and end up with a great deal of 
money, but the set-up is risky in a dozen different ways. And so the 
caper begins.
Tarantino takes his own sweet time getting to the caper, devoting a good 
stretch of the film to an up-close-and-personal look at Ordell Robbie, a 
fast-talking hustler who is both riveting and repulsive. Samuel L. 
Jackson, one of the great actors of our time, is electric here, creating 
a hyper-active viper with an oily charisma. Almost as disturbing as his 
bursts of intense violence is his incessant use of the word "nigger," 
which pops up literally dozens of times during his staccato harangues. 
Tarantino may think lobbing the word around provides street credibility, 
but his fascination with the term feels juvenile and offensive. 
Robbie's right-hand man is Louis Gara (Robert De Niro,) a quiet ex-con 
more interested in getting stoned with Melanie (Bridget Fonda,) a 
girlfriend and shill of Robbie's, than in taking care of business. 
Jackson and De Niro are a colorful pair, though nowhere near as 
interesting as Jackson and John Travolta's Jules and Vincent in "Pulp 
Fiction."
Far more engaging are the characters of Jackie Brown and Max Cherry, 
wonderfully realized by Pam Grier and Robert Forster, the latest pair of 
actors to receive career resuscitation from Tarantino. Grier, a 70's pop 
icon as star of "Foxy Brown" and a host of blaxploitation flicks, is 
compelling in the film's lead role. Jackie Brown is a handsome middle-
aged woman whose great poise masks the despair and desperation she feels. 
Trapped in a low-paying, dead-end job with a small airline, she realizes 
that the clock is ticking and her options for success are extremely 
limited. Her legal crisis forces her to confront a bleak future, and take 
what could be her last big chance.
Robert Forster, who starred in "Banyon" and other forgettable 70s TV fare,
 exhibits a subtle, smoky charm as world-weary bail-bondsman Max Cherry. 
Another victim of middle-age malaise, Cherry trudges through life with 
dead eyes, until he meets Brown. Instantly smitten, he finds himself 
tempted to break free of his own dreary pattern of existence. When the 
two are together, they discuss little things, such as the weight gain 
that often comes when one stops smoking, but there's something bigger 
going on. They're really talking about their fear of aging and being 
alone, of regrets and missed opportunities. Mostly, they're testing the 
waters with each other, to try and determine if it's worth taking the 
chance of feeling again.  
That's pretty heady stuff for Quentin Tarantino, whose work in "Reservoir 
Dogs" and "Pulp Fiction" was sharp as a knife, but tended to lack depth. 
Using his camera more subtly than ever and employing lots of extreme 
close-ups, Tarantino deals with intimacy in a way he never has before. At 
two hours and thirty five minutes, "Jackie Brown" lags in spots, lacking 
the peaks and valleys necessary to sustain its length. Despite its 
difficulties with pacing, though, "Jackie Brown" is ample proof that 
Quentin Tarantino continues to grow as one of America's brightest 
filmmakers. Now if he'd just ease up on the "nigger" business...

In "Jackie Brown," the title character (Pam Grier) is a stewardess who is
caught by the feds (Michael Keaton, Michael Bowen) bringing in a shipment of
cash for arms dealer Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson).  Ordell sends
bailbondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster) to get Jackie out of jail, and Max
falls for her at first sight.  Jackie soon hatches a plan to play the feds and
Ordell against each other to make off with a sackfull of Ordell's money.
"Jackie Brown" attempts to introduce audiences to a different Quentin
Tarantino-more low key, more subtle than the fast-paced maverick of "Reservoir
Dogs" (1992) and "Pulp Fiction" (1994).  Touches of the old QT are here, of
course-Ordell and his pal Louis (Robert De Niro) are refugees from the
atmosphere of "Pulp"-but the heart of "Jackie Brown" is the romance of Jackie
and Max.  
The weakness of the movie is its casting.  Although he has two of the best
actors in Hollywood on hand (Jackson and De Niro), Tarantino gives the most
crucial roles to Grier and Forster, neither of which is up to the challenge. 
Tarantino offers several long close-ups of Forster's deep-lined face as if the
actor's expression is supposed to communicate Max's unspoken thoughts and
feelings.  However, Forster's expression says nothing.  Likewise, Grier,
obviously cast in homage to her 70's blaxploitation films, can deliver dialogue
with gusto but cannot lend her character the complexity that Tarantino's pacing
and script seem to desire.

     In the three years since PULP FICTION dazzled critics, raked in $100
million at the box office and polarized Academy voters, it has become
fashionable to brand Quentin Tarantino with that favored label of
contrarian pundits everywhere:  "over-rated."  Many film buffs dismissed
him as a cinematic plagiarist or a profane wordsmith drunk on his own
familiarity with pop culture; his attempts at acting (DESTINY TURNS ON THE
RADIO, FROM DUSK TILL DAWN) were viewed as ego run amok.  With a three
year output behind the camera consisting of one "E/R" episode and a
lackluster segment of the ill-advised FOUR ROOMS, it was easy to start
asking questions.  Had the Flavor of the Month lost his flavor on the
bedpost overnight?
     A lot of those same folks are going to see JACKIE BROWN as a
validation of their suspicions.  After all, it's not the kind of dizzying,
heart-stopping morality-play-disguised-as-nihilism PULP FICTION was.  It's
simply a well-crafted Elmore Leonard caper (based on his novel "Rum
Punch") about a middle-aged flight attendant named Jackie Brown (Pam
Grier) caught in a tight spot.  Nailed by ATF agent Ray Nicolet (Michael
Keaton) for transporting cash and cocaine into the country from Mexico,
Jackie faces jail time unless she's willing to give up the man she's
acting as courier for.  That man is Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson), a
gun-runner who has already shown a reluctance to let potential snitches
remain among the living.  Faced with a no-win situation, Jackie decides
she wants to win anyway, elisting the aid of bail bondsman Max Cherry
(Robert Forster) in a sting where she hopes everyone but her will get
stung.
     Both fans and foes of Tarantino tend to fixate on his writing, but
JACKIE BROWN may prove once and for all that the man is a remarkably
talented film director.  He does things with his camera that keep viewers
off-balance, while avoiding the swooping ostentation of many young
film-makers.  At times, he will linger on a shot just after a character
has moved out of frame; at other times, he may shoot a conversation from
behind the characters' backs.  In one hilariously perfect scene, he uses
complete darkness to build tension, complemented by an expertly handled
split-screen to deliver the punch line.  He directs a scene with such
confidence that he can convince a viewer to follow wherever he's leading,
because it always seems to be somewhere slightly unexpected.
     He's also got a gift for directing actors most directors will never
have.  John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis gave the
performances of their careers in PULP FICTION; even Uma Thurman had an
uncommon intensity.  In JACKIE BROWN, Tarantino resurrects the careers of
not one, but two forgotten actors of the 1970s.  Most of the press has
gone to Pam Grier, still looking as Foxy as she did in the 70s as she
plays nobody's-victim Jackie.  Grier does fine work, but it's Robert
Forster who breaks out of JACKIE BROWN with a superb performance.  A
veteran of B-grade cop shows like "Nakia" and "Banyon," Forster plays the
world-weary Cherry with natural charisma and a touching affection for
Jackie.  In a cast full of heavy hitters like Samuel L. Jackson and Robert
DeNiro (both of whom are also top-notch), Grier and Forster make an
unexpected romance between two people past their Hollywood-pretty prime
funny, sexy and convincing.
     It's true that JACKIE BROWN includes plenty of familiar elements from
previous Tarantino efforts:  bursts of unpredictable violence,
twelve-letter profanities by the truck-load, non-linear narrative,
creative use of old songs (doing for "Strawberry Letter #23" what
RESERVOIR DOGS did for "Stuck in the Middle With You").  It's also true
that JACKIE BROWN moves at the kind of measured pace which could have some
Tarantino fans tapping their toes with impatience.  It's not an instant
classic, just a sharp piece of entertainment with the kind of
tightly-structured script you wish Tarantino could teach to other writers.
I found it hard not to smile virtually from start to finish in JACKIE
BROWN -- not because it's constantly amusing, but because it's such a
pleasure to be in the hands of someone who knows how to use the medium.
Even if it's an over-rated, plagiarizing Flavor of the Month like Quentin
Tarantino.

 With all the betrayals among almost all the characters in this
crime-caper film, the laughs come fast and frequent.  Just about the
only non-betrayer is the white bail bondsman, Max Cherry (Robert
Forster) who is attracted to the black airline stewardess cum cash
smuggler Jackie Brown (Pam Grier).   Strong performances by both aid
immensely in the enjoyment and believability of the film,.
 Jackie, who works for a small airline, adds to her income by
smuggling cash for the gunrunner, Ordell Robbie (Samuel L Jackson).
In fact that is where she gets in big trouble with a Los Angeles
policeman, Dargus (Michael Bowen) and  Federal government agent,
Nicolette (Michael Keaton) who would like to throw Robbie in jail.
For this they need the help of Jackie.   Caught with the cash, she
is given the option of naming Ordell as the real owner of the money,
or they will see that she goes to jail . . . and she promises
herself she is never going to go to jail.
 What makes the movie a delight are the full-fleshed characters, all
played skillfully and frequently sympathetically.    There is, of
course, Robbie, who has a young floozie living in one of his
hideouts.   That is Melanie Ralston (Bridget Fonda in perhaps her
best acting) as a nymphet.    Playing off each other is the somewhat
dim-witted Louis Gara (Robert De Niro in a delightful role he must
have enjoyed doing immensely).    Melanie, who looks like a dumb
blonde turns out to be quite a bit less stupid than one would have
guessed.   Some very funny dialog when Robbie asks Gara if he went
to bed with Melanie whom he had instructed to "take care of Gara"
while Robbie was going out for a bit.
 Bail bondsman Forster is perfect for his role as is Pam Grier with
her crooked smile. With good dialog by Quentin Tarantino the movie,
while not as good as his    PULP FICTION, is one not to be missed.
For one thing, while there are substantial amounts of gore,
Tarantino wisely opted to keep imuch of it off-screen.  Movies have
already reached the point of overdoing mayhem and blood.   Time the
directors pulled back a bit and left something to our imagination.
In this, Tarantino succeeds nicely.

     Tarantino has become a cult item after the success of RESERVOIR
DOGS and the award-winning PULP FICTION.  He is the director that
everybody caught early in his career and on his way up and from whom
everybody expects great things.  That put a lot of pressure on him to
make his third film be really something special.  His public may be
disappointed to discover that they now have to invest two hours and
thirty-five minutes in his new film and in return they will get a
plain, old-fashioned, unspectacular crime drama.  This is just a good,
hard-boiled crime film, perhaps with a somewhat convoluted plot.  Most
directors could be proud of JACKIE BROWN as only a third effort, but I
suspect that it will fall well short of the expectations for the over-
hyped Tarantino.
     Ordell Robbie (played by Samuel L. Jackson) is an ambitious and
vicious gun dealer working out of his Hermosa Beach pad owned by his
girlfriend Melanie (Bridget Fonda).  To Melanie life is eating,
sleeping, getting stoned, getting it on, and watching TV.  To most
other people dealing with Robbie, life is short, or at least it is once
they become inconvenient to Ordell.  But Ordell wants to get out of the
gun business and in general out of the business business.  He thinks it
is time to retire to Mexico with Melanie and his low- life, lower-IQ
partner Lou (a role that wastes Robert DeNiro's talents).  But before
Ordell can retire he wants to get half a million dollars in payments up
from Mexico.  His courier is Jackie Brown (Pam Grier, still around
after a quarter of a century of black exploitation films).  Jackie is a
stewardess for a cheap Mexican airline and supplements her meager
income by running payments for Ordell.  But this time it gets her into
trouble.  Jackie is arrested by ATF agent Ray Nicholette (Michael
Keaton) and policeman Mark Dargus.  That makes her inconvenient for
Ordell, both she and Ordell know it.  Her one edge is that Ordell does
not know that she knows it.  She strikes up a shaky partnership with
the honest-seeming bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster) whom
Ordell uses professionally.  Together they have to outsmart Ordell to
stay alive.
     It is difficult to believe that this Samuel L. Jackson is the same
one who was in EVE'S BAYOU.  Jackson is a powerful and versatile actor
who has been getting a lot of work, but deserves the attention he gets.
One actor who does not get the attention is Robert Forster, who is
something of a poor man's James Garner.  He has Garner's ease and grace
in a role, but just does not have Garner's following.  For a treat
sometime see his HOLLYWOOD HARRY--not a great plot, but a fun
performance by Forster.  Moving down the list we get to Robert DeNiro,
Michael Keaton, and Bridget Fonda.  And what are they doing in this
film?  It is nice to see a familiar face in a role, but these are parts
that should have gone to some deserving second-stringers who could have
brought just as much to the film as the people cast.  I suppose they
may have wanted to work with Quentin Tarantino.  But still, folks,
let's move aside and give some other actors a chance to be seen.
     The film is by far Tarantino's least violent film, as some of his
fans will be happy to know.  Violence is neither a plus nor a minus
with me, but I do know of people who refused to see PULP FICTION
because of its violence.  Overall, Tarantino has made an acceptable
film, even if it is over two and a half hours long.  If it has less
magic than his previous work, it certainly has competence.  I rate it a
7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.
     Spoiler.... Spoiler.... Spoiler.... Spoiler.... Spoiler....
Spoiler.... Spoiler....
     Are you kidding?  In a dressing room?  Presumably some have
discreet anti-shoplifting surveillance.  I doubt that anyone who knew
what they were doing would ever assume that a dressing room is
completely private.
     There is a humorous bit at the beginning that involved a cameo by
Demi Moore.  I wonder how realistic that was?  I also wonder if the
noise from Keaton's leather jacket was intended as a subtle joke.

     After an eclectic array of post-PULP FICTION distractions-- vampire
flicks, script doctorings, horrid Christmas Day anthologies, etc.-- Q.T.
is back, doin' what he does best, adapting Elmore Leonard's "Rum Punch"
as the year's best black comedy/caper flick/love story/'70's musical re-
vue.  (Forget BOOGIE NIGHTS, this is the soundtrack to shake your booty
to.)  An exceptionally striking Pam Grier plays the title character, a
44 y.o. stewardess on a cut-rate airline, caught smuggling gun money
(and a bit of blow) for Sam Jackson's small-time L.A. arms dealer.  Fac-
ing a change to an already underwhelming lifestyle, she cuts a deal with
the feds, enlists the aid of a increasingly friendly been-there-done-
that bail bondsman (Robert Forster), and begins concocting a scheme to
win her freedom, and, maybe, just maybe, walk away with a chunk of the
half mil that's also part of the plan.
     Double and triple crosses ensue, but they're fairly easy to follow.
Far more jarring-- initially, at least--  is the relaxed pace and
straightforward narrative.  (That is, unless you've never seen a Taran-
tino flick, in which case you'll probably be blushing at Jackson's ample
use of n***** and m*****f*****.)  Other Q.T. trademarks are present and
accounted for, including the expected conversational asides.  (My fave:
Jackson detailing the influence of Hong Kong action flicks on handgun
demand.)  There's less violence than you might expect and only one zany,
brainy instance of time-shifting, which happens toward the end, when an
event is told thrice, from three different viewpoints.  The real joy,
though, is in the depth of characterizations.  We're given a generous
amount of screen time to know and grow to love the three principals.  In
turn, Grier, Forster, and Jackson reward us with rich (and, in Jackson's
case, also electrifying) performances.  Really, the only shame is that
it has to end.  With supporting turns of varying success by Bridget
Fonda, Michael Keaton, and Robert DeNiro.

Jackie Brown  *** (out of four)
R, 1997
Directed and written by Quentin Tarantino.
Starring Pam Grier, Robert Forster, Samuel Jackson, Michael Keaton.
I suppose Quentin Tarantino was in an almost impossible position after the
wide acclaim and endless hype of his 1994 film "Pulp Fiction," an offbeat
crime movie that was not only possessed by a unique kind of manic energy but
even emerged as something of a morality play by the time it was over.
Personally, I didn't think "Pulp Fiction" was quite the masterpiece that many
other movie-goers thought it was, but I can still see how it would be hard to
top in terms of basic in-your-face impact.  So I guess it's not such a
surprise that his follow-up, "Jackie Brown," is something of a letdown.
Don't misunderstand - this film is not without its virtues. The story, adapted
from a novel by Elmore Leonard, revolves around an upcoming payment of
$500,000 for illegal gun sales by Ordell Robie (Samuel Jackson). When airline
stewardess Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is caught bringing a smaller transaction
of money into the U.S. for Ordell, an ATF agent (Micheal Keaton) offers to get
her off the hook if she will set up Ordell for them and hand over the
$500,000. Meanwhile, Jackie formulates a plan that might, with the help of
bond officer Max Cherry (Robert Forster) let her "take the money and run." The
film spends most of the time following Jackie as she arranges things with Max
while still trying to convince both Ordell and the authorities that she is on
their side.
Numerous double-crosses and deceptions ensue, along with a surprisingly small
body count; Tarantino has toned down the violence considerably from "Pulp
Fiction" and his first film, "Reservoir Dogs." His offbeat humor is still
present, however, especially when Louis (Robert DeNiro), a recently released
bank robber who seems to have left his brain behind when he got out of jail,
is involved; the dialogue between Louis, Ordell, and Ordell's "little blond
surfer gal" Melanie make for some of the funniest moments. And as with most
"caper" movies, the plot itself is interesting enough to keep the audience
entertained most of the time.
I think the problem with "Jackie Brown" is just that it moves a little too
slowly. There were times in this movie when I was actually kind of bored, and
I think everyone, whether they liked "Pulp Fiction" and "Reservoir Dogs" or
not, can pretty much agree that Quentin Tarantino had never put a boring
moment on the screen before now. He has said publicly that he was aiming for a
more low-key style with this film rather than trying to top himself and thus
decided to focus on the characters, most notably Jackie, but I think he may
have overdone it in this respect. These characters are better developed than
those in most action/crime movies, but there are also some scenes which drag
on too long without telling us anything very revealing about them or about the
central storyline.
I figure that a movie that keeps me entertained at a very low level, through
basic action sequences or simple plot manipulations, deserves two stars.
"Jackie Brown" has the added benefit of Tarantino's style, humor, and
character development, so it gets three. Don't go to see it expecting "Pulp
Fiction II," but as a quirky, entertaining, and generally well-written crime
movie, it delivers the goods.

We all know what a John Ford Western looks like, and what an Alfred
Hitchcock thriller looks like, and what a Frank Capra drama looks like.
And, amazingly enough, we all know what a Quentin Tarantino movie looks
like.  Amazing, I mean, becaus he's only directed three movies.  Not
that either Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction arise to the level of The
Searchers, North by Northwest, or Meet John Doe, by any means, but
Tarantino has a style as distinctive as John Wayne's red bandanna or
Jimmy Stewart's stammer.
But the key to Tarantino movies has always been the dialogue.  That's
why True Romance is a "Tarantino movie", even though Tony Scott directed
Tarantino's screenplay.  That's why Pulp Fiction will be studied in film
schools long after films like Buddy and The Jackal have evaporated like
the smoke from a Red Apple cigarette.  And that's why Jackie Brown is
just a little bit short of being the best movie of the year.  (Which
would be Titanic.)
QT is working with an Elmore Leonard novel as his source material, and
his screenplay has taken pains to remain true to Leonard's snappy
dialogue.  Although he's transplanted the setting from South Florida to
the familiar suburban outback of Los Angeles, QT has studiously kept his
trademark conversational vignettes out of the movie.  Also, the native
quirkiness of Tarantino characters is curiously absent -- partially
because Tarantino's not working with his regular cast  (Tim Roth, Steve
Buscemi, Harvey Keitel, QT himself).  And there's not a Big Kahuna
Burger or a four-way gun confrontation in sight.
And yet, these are minor quibbles, important to only die-hard Tarantino
fans. (And QT does add several signature touches -- one funny
split-screen moment, one Indiana-Jones-type map, and the turning-point
of the movie, told in three different segments from three different
perspectives.)
Jackie Brown is a fine movie, driven by plot and dialogue rather than
car chases and shootouts.  At its center, it's a duel between ghetto
arms dealer Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson, in yet another
Oscar-worthy performance) and stewardess turned courier Jackie Brown
(Pam Grier, making a boffo return to the screen).  The winner will get
half a million dollars, the loser will die.
Ordell is a man who knows that it's good to be the king.  He rules his
large gun business and small harem like an empire, dealing ruthlessly
and efficiently with threats -- but he's a classy and smart king.
Jackson takes a character that could be instantly repellant and makes us
like and respect -- and fear -- him.  The only note that rings false
isn't Jackson's fault:  QT has grafted his musical taste onto Ordell's
character, and has him listening to the durndest music.
Where Ordell is powerful and commanding, Jackie Brown is dignified and
sharp.  Jackie is a 44-year-old stewardess on a cheesy airline, running
money for Ordell from Mexico.  An arrest by a federal marshal (Michael
Keaton, in a surprisingly colorless, Joe Friday role) forces Jackie to
try to walk a twisted tightrope to outwit both the feds and Ordell.
Grier is superb.  She makes Jackie Brown into a real person, rather than
just an older, wiser Foxy Brown.  We see Jackie in different moods:
quietly desparate in a small interrogation room, shouting down Ordell in
a tense confrontation in her apartment, tired yet dignified in getting
out of jail, alternately trying to overcome her nerves and then trying
to act nervous for the benefit of the cops, and in a wonderful scene,
rehearsing her fast-draw.
But the best reason to go see this movie is the one that no one
expected, the one that no one had ever even heard from in years:  Robert
Forster.   The veteran of such films as Maniac Cop 3: Badge of Silence,
Satan's Princess, The Kinky Coaches and the Pom Pom Pussycats, and Orgy
of the Nymphomaniacs somehow caught QT's eye, and got the part of bail
bondsman Max Cherry.  Forster isn't marquee-idol handsome, and his hair
plugs are painfully obvious, but he is...  Gary Cooper!  Yes!  When the
menacing Ordell explains that he doesn't have the money on him for a
bail bond, he replies calmly, in his flat, nasal voice:  "Is white guilt
supposed to make me forget that I run a business?"  Tough, smart, and
yet vulnerable to Jackie Brown's charms, Forster is a calm center of
gravity amidst the swirling plots and counterplots.  Maybe Forster
doesn't get an Oscar, but it's a crying shame that the Academy doesn't
give out a "Comeback Player of the Year" award.
However, the biggest disappointment in Jackie Brown is the performances
turned in by the veterans:  Michael Keaton and Robert DeNiro.  They're
both wasted in small, supporting roles -- Keaton as a hipster federal
marshal, DeNiro as a stoner ex-con.  DeNiro is primarily a sounding
board for Jackson, and for much of the movie, he sits around on the
couch with Bridget Fonda's surfer girl, smoking marijuana out of an
improbable statuette.  There's nothing wrong with any of their
performances, it's just that I would have like to have seen more use out
of this great cast.
But as good as the cast is, and a good as this movie is, the best thing
is this:  Jackie Brown makes me want to read more Elmore Leonard
novels.  That's a fine tribute to the skills of Jackson, Grier, and
Forster -- and especially to my main man, Quentin Tarantino.  In a
Hollywood obsessed with special effects, tiresome sequels, and unfunny
bathroom comedies, QT has once again proven that telling great stories
in a stylish and original way is magic.

*** (out of 4) There are a lot of things right in JACKIE BROWN, and they
all combine to form an entertaining, stimulating movie. 
First, the plot is a twisty little caper which Tarantino adapted from an
Elmore Leonard novel (whose GET SHORTY also made the favorable jump to
the big screen). It involves a flight attendant (Pam Grier) who's a
small-time smuggler on the side. When the cops catch up to her and tell
her she either informs or to goes to jail, she informs. Then she tells
her "employer" about the cops. We can't tell what she's got in mind
because she's playing both sides, which keeps us interested and involved
in the story. 
Second, the performances are top notch. The most surprising comes from
Robert Forster, a character actor who plays Max Cherry, a bail bondsman.
One is convinced that the person on the screen really is a bail bondsman
and not an actor. Samuel L. Jackson as crime boss Ordell Robbie and
Robert De Niro as his stoned sidekick Louis check in with their usual
badass performances. Pam Grier makes a solid showing as the title
character, though I don't see how she is irreplaceably perfect for the
role, as Tarantino has suggested (maybe he sees himself as the great
reviver of pop culture icons of the Â70s). 
Third, whether you like the look or not, Tarantino and production
designer David Wasco (who worked with Tarantino on PULP FICTION) have
created a unique style that successfully mixes elements of several
decades. The cop-funk music, the orange and brown interiors, and the
presence of Pam Grier all suggest the movie is set in the Â70s. But
Jackson's millinery and long hair puts the movie in the Â80s. The
pot-smoking blond beach girl and her VW bus pins the movie in the late
Â60s, while "Chicks with Guns" on the VCR reminds us that the real
setting is the Â90s. 
Finally, The cinematography and editing are fresh and interesting, but
they also serve the story  - they're not just there to show off.
(Cinematographer Guillermo Navarro has worked with Tarantino before.)
Early on, JACKIE BROWN looks like a student film. Long takes with a
static camera let scenes play out how they will. In fact, one of the
first shots of the movie is a long take showing Ordell and Louis on a
couch. After quite a while, Jackson orders his blond groupie to get some
ice. She was framed out of the picture and we didn't even know she
existed until the men became thirsty. It was a clever way to show
Ordell's disdain for women. 
Toward the end, a critical scene is played out from a few different
perspectives, each revealing new and important details about the scene.
It was a nice little RASHOMON bit (or a CLUE: THE MOVIE bit for the
cynical among you) that drew out the tension of the scene and gave the
whole sequence some extra weight. Since it is critical to the story, the
extra weight is appropriate. 
One final point is well worth mentioning. I am constantly surprised (and
pleasantly so) by how NORMAL people look in British movies. Actors are
chosen for how well they fit the parts and not for how many glamour
magazine covers they have filled. I think it's great that a 44-year old,
nonanorexic woman is the hero in this hip, slick, American movie. 
Congratulations to Tarantino for proving himself an able filmmaker who
promises to change the face of Hollywood movies.

After the terminally bleak Reservoir Dogs and the brutally violent Pulp
Fiction, Jackie Brown seems like something of a light-hearted departure
for Quentin Tarantino. It's more of a ho-hum heist story with characters
that speak the Tarantino language. Luckily, his showcase of actors
convert every morsel of possible enjoyment onto the screen, and Jackie
Brown has no trouble entertaining the average viewer.
The story introduces us to a street-wise black woman named Jackie Brown
(Pam Grier), a flight attendant who smuggles money and drugs from one
destination to another. She works for a bottom-of-the-barrel airline and
receives a minimal salary. But one day, she is picked up by a pair of
Federal Officials (including Michael Keaton as the tough-nosed Ray
Nicolet), and found with a handsome load of cash and a small bag of
smuggled dope. Jackie is working for a weapons dealer named Ordell
(Samuel L. Jackson), who pays her bail money but suspects her of tipping
off the feds about their operation. Soon Jackie and Ordell are plotting
a way to smuggle $500,000 through to them under Nicolet's nose, with the
help of Ordell's oaf of a partner (Robert De Niro) and drugged-out lady
friend (Bridget Fonda).
Also entering the picture is a bail-bondsman named Max Cherry (Robert
Forster), who takes a liking to Jackie and agrees at one point to make
the situation even more complicated (how I won't say). The big drop-off
is undoubtedly the high point of Jackie Brown, in which numerous
double-crosses take place and many clothing store bags (filled with
cash) switch hands. It's unfortunate that Tarantino takes his sweet time
getting there, and doesn't offer anything extremely compelling while
doing so. There are, as always, amusing exchanges between characters.
The funniest repartee is between De Niro and Fonda, as he becomes
annoyed with her constant bickering while making fun of his IQ, or lack
thereof. The most interesting relationship is between Max and Jackie. A
56-year old white bail bondsman and a 44-year old black flight attendant
with believable chemistry? You've got to commend the acting.
Jackie Brown is a seriously dragged-out exercise enlivened by such fine
acting. The film clocks in at a lengthy 2 hours, 35 minutes. Tarantino's
talky style manages to hold your attention heavily, but there are more
than a few dramatic lapses and crucial lulls in the storyline. Also,
fans of the director should be prepared for a lighter side to appear.
Jackie Brown has four major shootings, and two of those take place
mostly off-screen, so don't be expecting a typical Tarantino bloodbath.
You can expect frequent foul language, mostly coming way of Ordell, who
(much to the dismay of Spike Lee) uses the `N' word as part of his
regular vocabulary.
The acting is the glue that holds everything together. Grier, making a
sudden comeback from her reign in the 1970's, is more than adequate for
the title character. In fact, she's flat-out great. Another comeback
comes from former TV star Robert Forster, who does a grand job as Max
Cherry, and is perfectly cast in doing so. Michael Keaton makes his
presence felt, albeit in small but dignified moments, and De Niro is
ideal in playing the lug-head who goes over the edge. Speaking of that,
Bridget Fonda has relatively little to do as Ordell's bikini-clad beach
babe, and yet she manages to look fairly occupied.
There's not a single sign of misplaced dialogue or snubbed line
throughout the entire movie. Which is a life-saver for Mr. Tarantino.
The story barely holds together in the meantime, and we merely get a
small tremor whenever there should be a defeaning earthquake. But oh
well. Jackie Brown manages to be an enjoyable detour from Quentin
Tarantino, even if it is lacking the glaring and original bite of his
previous work. Let's just hope that the director hasn't gone soft on us.
