Hmmm...okay, let's take a classic tale from William Shakespeare, since he's
"hot" right now: "The Taming of the Shrew" (Note: When said real fast, the
title of this film may actually sound like it too!). Toss it the kids' way
by involving a couple of good-looking leads, some hipper than thou music, a
high school setting, and one of the worst movie titles of the year, and
you've got the tale of girl who nobody desired, and who in turn, desired no
one. Better all-around movie than SHE'S ALL THAT (6.5/10) and NEVER BEEN
KISSED (6/10).
PLOT:
Two diametrically opposed sisters, the younger being cute and outgoing, the
older reserved and independent, live under the rule of their strict father
who will not let the young one go out on a date until the older one gets a
date herself, which she is adamantly against. But halt, alas, here is a
mighty prince being paid a hefty compensation to attempt to date the
"unapproachable" girl by a weasel who wants to "nail" the younger one. And
what about the sweet kid who really does love the younger sibling? Find out!
CRITIQUE:
Light, safe, enjoyable little tale of the teenage world, boasts a couple of
charming and utterly convincing performances from its two stars, quite a few
chuckle-as-you-go-along jokes, and a surprisingly believable component of
depth within a few well-developed movie characters. Okay, so it's not
perfect, I mean it still has a couple of the one-dimensional players that we
find in all teenage flicks, along with the proverbially boring ritual of one
guy introducing another to the various cliques in a high school (Wow, what a
concept!), but overall, it plays well because of its non-stop pace, the
interesting relationship between the sisters, and most of all, the enjoyable
and engaging performances by stars-to-be Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles.
Little sister, Larisa Oleynik, also played her cutesy role to a tee, even
managing to add some credibility to her first-thought-of-as-one-dimensional
role. There were also plenty of romantic scenes in this movie, which are
sure to set any girl's eyes a-flutter (Mrs. JoBlo almost fluttered her way
out of her seat during the touching serenade in the soccer field scene).
Having said that, I think that I could have done without another "prom
scene" or some of the out-of-place eighties tunes playing during a party of
sixteen year olds (Do any of them even know who the Thompson Twins are??),
but all in all, this film managed to hook me into its net of romance, fluff,
comedy and teenage shenanigans. Mix that in with an utterly entertaining
presentation by the way of the overly cautious father, Larry Miller, and the
funniest teacher to hit the big screen in a long while, Daryl "Chill"
Mitchell, and you've got yourself a pleasant time at the movie garage, or a
decent nite of home video. Either way, don't forget the nachos and your
better half.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:  (Some facts gathered from
the IMDb)
Several names reflect the Shakespearean origin of this movie. Bianca's and
Katerina's last name is Stratford (Shakespeare was born in
Stratford-upon-Avon). Patrick's last name is Verona (birthplace of
Petruchio, the corresponding character from the play). The high school is
called Padua, which is the city in which the play is set. Groovy, eh?
Actress Julia Stiles was born in New York City on March 28, 1981.
Actor Heath Ledger was born in Perth, Australia on the 4th of April, 1979.
He starred in a film called BLACK ROCK, which was nominated for Best
Australian picture in 1997.
This is director Gil Junger's first feature film. He has directed many TV
shows before, including "Dharma & Greg", "Living Single" and "Ellen".  He
was nominated for an Emmy for directing the infamous episode of "Ellen" in
which she revealed herself to be Lebanese...I mean, a lesbian! :)
The man who played the funny teacher, Daryl "Chill" Mitchell was part of a
Hip-Hop group from the 80's known as Groove B. Chill. He played the
character of "Chill" in both HOUSE PARTY movies.
Larisa Oleynik considers actress Claire Danes and Winona Ryder as her role
models. She and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are both on TV's "3rd Rock from the
Sun".

1. Anybody who is familiar with some of Shakespeare's work is probably
familiar with Taming of the Shrew.  `10 Things' is a lighthearted
adaptation of the Bard's tale about a younger sister who yearns to go
out but is forbidden unless her craggy and highly opinionated sister
first dates.  In this film, the two siblings are Bianca, a wholesome
girl with a tender smile and Cat, a cute but spiteful witch who
instills fear in a majority of the guys at their high school.
2. This movie begins unpromisingly as we are introduced to the various
high school cliques consisting of white Ziggy Marley fanatics who talk
with Jamaican accents, future ivy-leaguers who seem like grandsons of
Thurston Howell III, and even cowboys who are shown twirling their
lariats.  Satirizing cliques is perfectly fine; however, these are
included as mere sight gags, and the movie seems to have ample
opportunity to reintroduce these cliques into even funnier scenes, but
they just sort of vanish.
3. Even the faculty is no less odd including Guidance Counselor Ms.
Perky, who spends her time writing erotic fiction and Mr. Gordon who is
a black teacher that raps Shakespeare sonnets.  I'm not sure whether
the great Bard would have been more shocked by his raps (which do have
a smoothness to them) or knowing that they made this movie based on one
of his tales.
4. We meet up with Cameron is a likable yet vapid sort of guy who is
taken by Bianca's beauty.  He has to overcome two formidable obstacles.
 One is that she can't go out unless Cat also begins to date.  The
other obstacle is the vain, Chachi-look-alike (from Happy Days) student
that also wants to go out with her.
5. To get Cat to go out, they secure the services of Michael, the
school desperado, who probably has what it takes to tame her. 
Inevitably, he will fall for his prey and she will do the same.  It is
also inevitable that she'll realize that she was the product of a wager
and that there will be 10 minutes of film time while she ponders
intensively before she forgives and forgets.
6. Cat is actually very well-spoken.  In fact, for sophomores in high
school, some of the dialogue is incredibly grown up.  They seemed
extremely savvy about life and love.  Yet, despite their verve, nothing
of any importance really gets said.  How odd.
7. I can't say that I really liked anything about this movie.  However,
I can't really say that I disliked it either since it is about kids in
high school trying to find love, and let's face itwe didn't really
know all that much when we were in high school either.  But here's a
sweet moment that stood out.  Michael, to get Cat's attention, bribes
that school marching band to play while he serenades her over the PA
system.  Nice touch, but everything else was just ho-hum high school
silliness.
8. What was a shame was that some of these kids show real promise, but
it's hard to break out of the gravitational grip of a high school
comedy.  They will eventually graduate to bigger and better things.
9. Thinking about it more, I believe that I just tend to view high
school romance genres with a sort of detachment.  It seems as if so
many have come out recently (Can't Hardly Wait and She's All That, just
to name a few), that it's like watching the same movie over and over
again.  So, it's not that this movie is bad.  It's just that it's too
bad that so many of these films have come out.
10. The lowdown is this.  `10 Things' starts off as silly fare, but
there are some subtly charming moments, and for the most part, it's
relatively painless fluff.

     Boy meets girl.  Another boy bets boy he can't score with girl. 
Boy pays third boy to try to loosen up girl's sister so he can get
girl.  Serious themes that haven't been explored since... well... since
SHE'S ALL THAT.
     At least 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU has one hell of a good title. 
I give it points for that alone.  And while this updating of
Shakespeare's "The Taming of the Shrew" is clever and funny at times,
much of the film is just not entertaining due to bad directing by
way-out-of-his-element first-timer Gil Junger.
     In this retelling, we find Cameron (Gordon-Levitt) falling for
Bianca (Oleynik), the prettiest girl in all the land.  But dad (Miller)
won't let Bianca date until her older sister does!  Too bad sister Kat
(Stiles) is a, ahem, a shrew.  Whereupon Cameron launches a plan to
manipulate a half-dozen or so people such that Kat and brooding outcast
Patrick (Ledger) are a cozy couple.
     Unfortunately, much of this potentially good material is paced like
a bad sitcom.  And never have I seen a movie so desperate for a laugh
track.  Turns out Junger directed the "coming out" episode of "Ellen,"
and even worked on the series "Blossom."  Well, you can draw your own
conclusions from *that*.
     There's fortunately some good comic relief in this flick, mostly
from the adults.  Larry Miller, in particular, deserves some kind of
award for having me crack up repeatedly.  And Mitchell's English teacher
proves that, yes, there is life beyond "Veronica's Closet."  Also of
note is a good pop score punctuated by personal faves Letters to Cleo
and Save Ferris.
     Too bad a generally good cast is largely wasted otherwise.  And
parents: PG-13 is a very generous rating.  You've been warned.
     And a final word: stay for the blooper reel during the credits. 
It's the best part of the film.
Director: Gil Junger
Producer: Andrew Lazar
Writer: Karen McCullah Lutz, Kirsten Smith

Susan Granger's review of "10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU" (Touchstone Pictures)
Geared toward teenagers, this updated version of Shakespeare's
"Taming of the Shrew" is fresh, sheer fun as the Stratford sisters -
vapid, beautiful Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) and crass, ill-tempered Kat
(Julia Stiles) - confront romance at Padua High School. Confounded by
her father's strict rules, Bianca, a sophomore, knows she cannot date
until her older sister, a senior, does so her wannabe boyfriend
(Andrew Keegan) bribes a sullen transfer student with an infamous
reputation, Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger), to woo the notorious Kat.
The scheme becomes convoluted, of course, as the Bard of Avon leads
the students on a merry chase.  "People perceive you as a heinous
bitch," observes the guidance counselor who spends most of her time
writing a sex novel. "I prefer 'tempestuous,'" tartly replies Kat,
who's reading "The Bell Jar."  Screenwriters Karen McCullah Lutz and
Kirsten Smith retain Shakespeare's morals and complicated conventions,
while director Gil Junger keeps the pace fast, dodging cliches as
often as he can. Bright young actors with fresh faces from TV shows
enthusiastically strut their stuff as rebellious misfits, desperate
malcontents, and prospective prom queens, discovering the truth about
themselves and finding love amidst a surreal Tacoma/Seattle setting -
and handsome hunk Heath Ledger from Australia seems headed for
stardom. Above all, the music rocks, particularly "Save Ferris" and
the Boston-based band "Letters To Cleo," as the dastardly cynical
politics of high school are revealed. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1
to 10, "10 Things I Hate About You" is a witty, definitively cool
8. There's lots of sly, sophisticated, acerbic humor, even for
non-teens.

Shakespeare is spinning in his grave.
Picture this figure of speech.  It's not so much poetic as graceless and 
gross, much like Gil Junger's 10 Things I Hate About You, a film loosely 
based on the Bard's The Taming of the Shrew.
Here's the premise:  two beautiful sisters living in Washington state 
stand for opposite worldviews  one superficial and pleasure-seeking, 
the other feminist and intelligent.  The position of Bianca Stratford 
(Larisa Oleynik), peeved that she is not allowed to date boys, worsens 
when her obstetrician father changes the rule.  Now Bianca can date only 
when Kat dates!  This seems unlikely, as Kat is the shrew of 
Shakespeare's title, a determined little termagant who shuns guys only 
after she has mentally outshone them. Here now  complications.  At 
wit's end, Bianca exploits a boy with a crush on her, a new kid in 
school named Cameron (Joseph Gordon Levitt).  In a convoluted series of 
schemes, a handsome bad boy (Patrick Verona, played by Heath Ledger) is 
paid to woo Kat.  Hence Bianca is free to date the slimy Joey Donner 
(Andrew Keegan), although she had suggested she'd be dating Cameron in 
return for his favor.
Still with it?  The basic love stories are promising, especially a minor 
one involving a friend of Cameron's and a friend of Kat's.  But the 
turns of romantic plot are too predictable, and the resulting 
relationships fall flat.  How can viewers believe a repulsive young man 
like Verona can become a desirable, even noble character?  Does Bianca 
truly overcome her shallowness and attain a mantle of decency?  And most 
crucially, why is the shrew tamed so relatively easily?  Heaps of 
questions occur to the watcher of this film.
Julia Stiles is the most striking cast member, and does a strong job 
portraying Kat's feminist bent.  Karen McCullah Lutz's screenplay, 
though, casts Kat as a closet Barbie, ready to comply when she is 
pleased.  A strong facial resemblance helps Oleynik in being convincing 
as the sister.  Oleynik is fine as Bianca, especially in portraying the 
occasional shallowness that is such a strong contrast to Kat's cultural 
politics.
Larry Miller plays the father of Kat and Bianca as an overprotective 
buffoon.  He's an undeveloped caricature about whom we ultimately care 
very little.  Let it be enough to say that the writing has him telling 
us about his character, when real characters show themselves.  Needless 
to say, his wife is missing from the scene.  The result does not make us 
sympathize for the plight of his single parenthood, as much as it makes 
us wonder if screenwriters don't kill parents off just to have less 
characters to flesh out fully.
In a couple of small roles, David Leisure and Daryl Mitchell play 
teachers who add funny moments to the film.  But the tones of their 
characterization again intrude, and the viewer wonders if she is 
watching realism or over-the-top camp.  The filthy language and personal 
insults used by Mr. Morgan (Mitchell's teacher) are downright 
unbelievable.  It's almost as though the film is trying to exaggerate in 
the same way the situations in Clueless were exaggerated  but 10 Things 
is much less successful.
The film's faults are many.  For one, Budweiser must have paid dearly 
for product placement.  How advisable is it, however, to place your 
product in the hands of hundreds of actors playing underage drinkers?  
Another, larger flaw is the sense of irresponsibility.  Again and again 
the youngsters peopling the film do nasty things to  each other and fail 
to pay for them.  From silly schtick  Bianca shooting her coach with an 
arrow  to major deception, 10 Things I Hate About You reinforces the 
notion that horrible behaviors often don't carry consequences.  Yes, 
there are the conventions of teen movies:  references to sex, scanty 
clothing (enough navels, already!) and endless sight gags.  Not that a 
film must be politically correct, but this one also points out several 
cliques, poking fun at each of them.  The satire is done nicely, but in 
the end the tone is less than tolerant.  Oh, besides Mitchell, there is 
one African-American actress, Gabrielle Union, as one of Bianca's 
shallow friends.  The lack of diversity is one shortcoming, but it's the 
film's careless accenting of reckless attitudes that crosses the line 
from harmless fluff to become offensive drivel.  In the current flood of  
teen-oriented films, when is a director going to respect this line?
The tie-in with Shakespeare is what drew my attention.  No similar 
relation exists with the spate of new teen flicks.  So for the millions 
of moviegoers not targeted by filmmakers exploiting this genre, do not 
hesitate to miss them.  Even the use of Good Will could not add weight 
to this piece;  come on, how much more lightness do the young people of 
the world need?

10 Things I Hate About You is an update of the classic play, The Taming 
of the Shrew. That said, drop any pre-conceived notions of what 
Shakespeare's work is supposed to be like and welcome yourself to 
Padua High School, home of a student counselor (Allison Janney) who 
obsesses over the male penis; a slightly too hip and racist 
African-American English teacher (Daryl Mitchell); a new kid named 
Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt); a model named Joey (Andrew Keegan), the 
subject of Cameron and Joey's crushes; Bianca (Larisa Oleynik); and 
Bianca's sister - the shrew (Julia Stiles in a marvelous 
performance)- whose name is Katarina, Kat for short.
With movies about high schools similar to these running through 
projectors like water down the Nile, it would be quite easy to write off 
10 Things I Hate About You as just another doltish comedic-romance. Yet, 
you must realize that the story is timeless, and a few hundred years 
later it is equally as witty and comical as when Elizabeth gleefully 
looked on, groundlings below and stuffed brassieres on stage.
The first reminder of the original scribe can be found in Katarina and 
Bianca's last name: Stratford. Their family is run by Walter Stratford 
(Pretty Woman's Larry Miller), a doctor who is all too familiar with 
teenage pregnancy and guards his children accordingly. In what he thinks 
to be a moment of ironic humor, the family "no dating" policy is amended 
to "Bianca can date...when [Katarina] does." With prom just ahead, 
Bianca's fate is grim; unless, of course, she can tame the shrew. 
Don't think this mission to be a simple one, as Bianca kindly points 
out, her sister "... is a particularly hideous breed of loser."
Getting Katarina to date is complex and oftentimes confusing. When 
Cameron, who likes Bianca, learns of her father's new rule, he is 
quick to consult a friend for advice. The scheme they dream up is to 
fully exploit "someone with money." In this case, that is Joey - the 
other guy with a crush on Bianca. Cameron's friend, a loser by teenage 
verdict, convinces Joey to pay someone who has enough guts to take the 
shrew out. The solution lies no farther away than the second blatant 
reminder of the master scribe: Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger). This 
Verona is far from fair; rumor has it that he previously laid his scene 
in prison. Moreover, Katarina openly opined to the aforementioned 
English teacher that "Hemingway was an alcoholic who hung around 
Picasso, hoping to nail his leftovers." The laws of high school cinema 
inexorably turn Patrick and Katarina into Romeo and Juliet.
Providing a constant reminder of the fact that this isn't exactly what 
Shakespeare had in mind are the elements obligatory to a high school 
comedy: A party polluted with liquor, a best friend's betrayal, and 
prom. It is the latter that has become infamous for closing films like 
Drive Me Crazy, American Pie, Never Been Kissed, Carrie, She's All 
That, and Can't Hardly Wait. Yet surely even these practices have 
roots in Shakespeare; Falstaff was a drunk, Romeo and Juliet met at a 
party, and Caesar learned about loyalty the hard way.

Starring Joseph-Gordon Levitt, Larisa Oleynik. Rated PG-13.
The teen comedy genre has been a wildly successful one these past few years,
as we've seen all kinds of rip-offs, abominations and even a few straining
originals. It's even spawned a few updates of Shakespeare and Dickens, the
weirdest of which was Leonardo DiCaprio's love-it-or-hate-it 1996 radical
version of William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet. Yes, we've gotten some
weird, weird films, some hopelessly raunchy, others openly profound. 10
Things I Hate About You is somewhere in between. Very loosely based on (maybe
even just inspired by) William Shakespeare's comedy The Taming of the Shrew,
one thing that 10 Things has going for it is a teriffic ensemble cast of
teens. Larisa Oleynik (of Nickelodeon fame) is Bianca Stratford, a gorgeous
and insanely popular sophomore that has one monkey on her back: her dad will
not let her date... until her sister, Kat Stratford does. The problem is that
Kat is rather anti-social, to put it mildly, and getting her to date is
almost as inconceivable to her as getting her dad to loosen up (fairly
inconceivable, in case you do not get my drift).
That also presents a problem for newcomer Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who
has a major crush on Bianca. Fortunately for him he has a quick-thinking pal
who gets Joey, the school hunk with a crush for Bianca, to pay another guy to
date Kat. The conflict, then is who will get the girl, Joey (the jerk) or
Cameron (the nice guy).
10 Things has little more in common with The Taming of The Shrew than my
mother does with Joseph Gordon-Levitt, but it doesn't really make much
difference. This is one of the more energetic teen films that I've watched
lately; not as hypnotically laid back as Varsity Blues or as uneven as She's
All That. That almost always works to the movie's advantage; because lame
scenes are made nifty by the movie's endless energy. Something like a guy
serenading a girl who is angry at him through the PA system on the soccer
field would be ridiculously schmaltzy in any other movie, but when said guy
starts running around spanking policemen who are trying to apprehend him the
whole scene takes on an appealing quality.
The performances in 10 Things are likewise stellar. Although Gordon-Levitt is
moderately annoying in a role it's difficult not to be annoying in, other
young actors and actresses triumph. Julia Stiles is achingly sincere as Kat
Stratford, with a kind of unapproachable vulnerability about her. Andrew
Keagan is effectively repulsive as the conceited school hunk used as a pawn
by Cameron and his friends. But the highlight of the bunch is the beautiful,
funny, charming Larisa Oleynik. Previously seen on the Nickelodeon tv show
The Secret World of Alex Mack, this actress is clearly likeable enough to
have a great future in Hollywood.
10 Things I Hate About You is certainly not without its flaws. We have the
usual "I was a bet?/You were payed to like me?" speech which is like a rubber
stamp in these teen movies. Another rubber stamp is the fact that the film
ends with a prom. The prom is a perfect symbol of teenage angst when utilized
correctly (remember Carrie?) but nowadays we see proms that end with disaster
so often (even in the recent Never Been Kissed which I happened to like) that
it is no longer effective at projecting teenage anger at the world.
Still, those relatively minor complaints are not nearly enough to discredit
this teriffic little movie, which is entertaining despite all of its flaws.
It is nothing unique to be sure, but it is a nice diversion if one has a
rainy evening with nothing to do on one's hands.

Starring Julia Stiles, Heath Ledger and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
Directed By Gil Junger
Running Time: 1 hour 37 minutes.
Shakespeare's 'The Taming of the Shrew' gets transferred to 90's America in
this fun tale of romance. Julia Stiles plays Katarina Stratford, a bitchy
'hate chick'  who's sister, Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) desperately wants to
date boys. However, daddy (Larry Miller) won't let Bianca date until
Katarina dates, and there isn't much chance of that happening. Enter Cameron
(Gordon-Levitt) who desperately wants to date Bianca. Of course, he can't
date Bianca until Katarina dates, so Cameron and friend Michael (David
Krumholtz) set in forth a plan to get weirdo Patrick (Ledger) to date
Katarina. Not everything, however, goes to plan.
Writers Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith have delivered a script that
makes Shakespeare actually quite good fun. The dialogue is funny, and the
film goes along at a cracking pace. In fact, the film moves a little too
fast, because some plot developments occur in a hurried way that aren't
entirely believable. The largest casualty of the fast paced script is
Katarina, who goes from independent chick to soppy, big eyed typical
teenager in the space of seemingly a few days. The film also gives the
current Hollywood saying, which is "if you don't conform, you won't be
popular." A worrying trend. Still, the dialogue is fresh, and the jokes come
out at a steady rate which gives the film a lively feel, and doesn't sound
like the writings of a forty year old desperately trying to sound cool.
The actors are obviously having a good time with the material. Most of the
cast have transferred from television, and are less brattish than some of
the brat pack appearing on the screen at the moment. Stiles has great fun
playing the easy role of being a bitch, and has fun running off the endless
insults. Her characters a little flat, however, and her transformation is
more than a little shaky. Still, she looks great, acts well, and handles the
main role with ease. The hulking Ledger is good fun as the seemingly
braindead Patrick, who's charm increases throughout the movie, until he
becomes the most likeable character in a likeable cast. Gordon-Levitt
suffers from the 90m.p.h script, and his character is therefore lacking. He
gives a decent performance, but he never has enough time to truly shine on
the screen. He also looks about thirteen years old. David Krumholtz is
hilarious as the typical geek, and this, following his performance in Slums
of Beverly Hills, shows he has a great comic talent. The pretty if empty
Larisa Oleynik (also known as Alex Mack) makes the least impression in the
movie, her performance is a bit boring and two dimensional. Allison Janey
pops up in a bit role as the horny school counsellor, and like most bit
roles gets all the best lines and disappears with her pay cheque.
The rest of 10 Things I Hate About You follows the standard teen flick
formula. There's a glaring rock sound track featuring a good selection of
rock tunes. There's the 'hip' school teacher, overplayed by Daryl Mitchell.
There's a performance or four by a live band. And the film ends at a prom,
and the weather is always good. It all seems a little too perfect, and for
some people watching spoiled kids live out their spoiled lives holds no
opinion. But it's better made here, and thankfully the characters are fully
likeable.
10 Things I Hate About You is a worthwhile teen flick, directed with a
bouncy flair by Gil Junger which gives the film a light, fluffy feel. The
ending is obvious, the sentiment piled on. But 10 Things I Hate About You is
a worthwhile movie that is good for a matinee.

Based upon "The Taming of the Shrew" by William Shakespeare
Starring Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Larisa
Oleynik
 Coming out of the movie theatre I began my weekly ritutal about telling the
staff of the cinema, including the cute new worker who keeps begging me to
put her in one of my reviews, how good or bad the movie I just saw was.  It
is the equivilant of pointing the thumbs north or south.  In the case of Ten
Things I Hate about You, my comment was "No where near as dumb as I
expected."  Behind me a bunch of high school Freshmen were gabbing about how
hot the guys looked or how sweet the story was while their very bored
boyfriends did the thing that very bored boyfriends have learned to do very
well.  Nod and smile politely.
 Seeing as the main word that kept coming up in their lemming-like
consciousness was "hip", I decided to do what I do best: burst a bubble.
 "I wonder if they know," I said loud enough that they could hear, "if the
film they just liked so much was based on a William Shakespeare play."
 "What?" came a nervous pipsqueak of a voice from behind me.
 "Yeah," I turned.  "It's based on 'The Taming of the Shrew'.  They changed
the place and the dialogue and some of the names around but the basic story
is intact.  You just watched Shakespeare."
 An eerie silence came over the entorage.  My only impression is that they
felt guilty, almost dirty, about having liked something by the Immortal Bard
that didn't star Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes packing 9mm's.
 This brings me to point number one of the "10 things I don't hate about 10
Things I Hate About You."
 1. It's underhanded.  It takes Shakespeare, the dread of high school
students everywhere, and puts him in a teenage movie with a cool soundtrack.
What's worse, it has very little Elizabethian dialouge, no big stars, and it
actually makes them laugh.
 2. It imports actors.   Sure, we all love imported food and we really love
imported cars (give me a BMW anyday), but do we like imported actors.  No,
we loathe them.  That is, everyone who likes pulp movies loathes them (The
Thunder from Down Under excluded).  However, 10 Things... a pulp film to the
core, has an imported lead.
 3. It has a brain.  No further explanation.
 5. It doesn't get lost somewhere between the 17th century and the 20th
century.
 6. It has a guidance counselor who writes sex novels.  So I'm human.
 7. Feminist music plays a large part in the movie yet Gwen Stefani is
nowhere to be found.
 8. It has teenagers who know show tunes.  Surreal, but very fun.
 9. The unpopular character is the one you love the most.
 10. For once, not everyone in the movie salivates over a model with no
brain.
 10 Things... is a movie that is blessed with a set of fine adaptors, a
director that I will remember the name of for his/her next film, and
performances by up and coming actors and actresses.  Like She's all That,
which had the audacity to make its satiric target its target audience, 10
Things... goes about in an underhanded way making the idiots laugh and the
wise man laugh harder.
 I honestly don't see how anyone under 25 could hate this film.

1) Shakespeare can be overbearing ... so many words so fast. This rewrite of
William Shakespeare's "Taming of the Shrew" is much more palatable stripped
of the Old English encryptions.
2) One viewer exclaimed, "Better than 'Shakespeare in love!'"
3) Here's the deal, two high school age sisters -- the sophomore: prep queen
seeks a normal dating life, the senior: bitch queen (her words) hates males.
Over-protective dad (thinking it a safe bet) won't allow the younger to date
until the older does. However, some young men interested in dating the
younger pay off an equally anti-social senior male to date the elder.
4) Slow beginning, then captivating.
5) Often very funny with a few endearing moments (one even jerked a tear
from me).
6) Great acting by leads.
7) Well paced.
8) Daryl Mitchell is hilarious as the literature teacher -- he raps to
Shakespeare.
9) Good music.
10) Stay for ending credits.
Starring Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles, Joseph-Gordon Levitt and Larisa
Oleynik.

 "10 Things I Hate About You" is a simplified and simplistic adaptation of
Shakespeare's "The Taming of the Shrew."
 Set at upscale Padua High School, the story revolves around the Stratford
sisters, Kat and Bianca.
 Kat is the school witch, a senior who hates guys and lives by her own
convictions. Bianca is a sophomore, the belle of the school, a popular girl
every guy wants to date.
 But there's no catch. As in the original, Bianca can have nothing to do
with the opposite sex until Kat is wooed. In other words, until Kat gets a
date, Bianca must sit at home and wait.
 The movie deviates from Shakespeare in several aspects, most notably
giving Kat a valid psychological reason for her disdain of boys.
 And while "10 Things I Hate About You" is not as intellectually
stimulating nor as bawdy as the original, it has enough to satisfy young
viewers and give them a sampling of the Bard's wit and style.
 A cast of basically unknown young actors breathe life into this 90-plus
minute confection, led by Julia Stiles as Kat and Heath Ledger as Patrick
Verona, the bad-ass student hired to tame "the shrew."
 The movie lacks weight. It's a fast-food film, easy to digest, but nothing
remarkable or memorable.
 "10 Things I Hate About You" follows in the wake of "Clueless" and "Cruel
Intentions" making the classics palatable for younger audiences. Whether it
stimulates young viewers to the point of actually reading the originals is
problematic.
 Older audiences may find the proceedings juvenile, but "10 Things I Hate
About You" is a fun date movie for the under-25 crowd.
 The only reason Shakespeare would roll over in his grave is any lack of
credit for inspiring this update. Well, that's Hollywood.

_10_Things_I_Hate_About_You_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
It would be easy to do take the cutesy and oh-so-precious route and make
this review a list of "10 Things I Hate About This Movie," but the truth is
I didn't exactly hate this film.  At its center, in fact, is a major thing
to like: newcomer Julia Stiles, who effectively plays the improbably named
Katarina Stratford, the "shrew" who comes to be "tamed" in this teen
modernization of William Shakespeare's _The_Taming_of_the_Shrew_.  Kat is
mercilessly bitter with the world, and she's not afraid to show it--to her
fellow students, her younger sister Bianca (Larisa Oleynik), and even her
doctor father (Larry Miller).  Even so, Stiles subtly instills enough
underlying vulnerability to make her relatable to the audience.
Also relatable are Kat's reasons for lashing out; the characters that
surround her are so vacuous, it's completely understandable why she
wouldn't want to associate with them.  These people include, in addition to
Bianca, her shallow best friend Chastity (Gabrielle Union); Bianca's two
suitors, egotistical model/actor Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan) and dull nice
guy Cameron James (Joseph Gordon-Levitt); Cameron's geeky friend Michael
Eckman (David Krumholtz); and, to a certain extent, the guy who eventually
thaws our ice princess, mysterious loner Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger, who
actually has some nice chemistry with Stiles).  They're all nice, selfish
targets for the full concentration of Kat's venom.  The problem is, while
director Gil Junger and writers Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith often
let Kat bare her fangs, she is given little to no opportunity to actually
bite.  Though this is a reworking of _The_Taming_of_the_Shrew_, the scale
is too heavily tilted toward the "taming" and not the "shrew."  Anyone
looking for the wickedness promised by the film's title or its taglines
("How do I loathe thee?  Let me count the ways" and "Romeo, oh Romeo, get
out of my face") will instead find a light dose of bile and a strong one of
the warm fuzzies.  (opens March 31)

   Suddenly Shakespeare rocks.  After generations of
suffering students have been forced to pore over the texts of
a language that looks to American teens about a
comprehensible as Tagalog would appear to a Malaysian,
Hollywood has found a way to excite a large demographic
group to the glories of the Bard.  This year alone will see six
adaptations from the great Renaissance writer, including a
version of Othello that takes place on a modern basketball
court.
   "The Taming of the Shrew" is an excellent choice of a 16th
century work to modernize since even in its own day it was
one of Shakespeare's most popular.  Filled with brilliant
language and witty wordplay, "Shrew" has a well-crafted,
easy-to-follow plot displaying the writer in one of his most
antic moods.  As his readers know, "taming" is not the best
word to describe what happens to Shakespeare's title
character, Katharina: "educating" would be the appropriate
term.  Kate is the spirited elder daughter of Baptista, a well-
to-do gentleman of Padua, who storms at her father and her
mild young sister Bianca, and rages against marriage--until
she finds that submission to her husband leads to more
happiness than she had dreamed possible.  The rationale for
"taming" her was a Renaissance belief in balance: life is best
when a woman follows the lead of a man.  When Kate acts
the shrew, she throws the universe out of balance.  A strong
man--Petruchio--was needed to bring the cosmos back to
order.
   This is not to imply that today's America is altogether
different.  Many men and a considerable number of women,
ignoring claims that the female gender is oppressed, actually
look forward to the day that the ideas of Betty Friedan are
reversed and, indeed, current post-feminism has gone a ways
toward bringing the pendulum back to the center.  This brings
us to "10 Things I Hate About You," a title so awkward that I
asked the nice young woman at the box office simply for a
pair of tickets to "10 Things"--to which she responded, "10
Things I Hate About You?"  Duh.
   Despite what you may have heard from critics who either
dismissed the movie as "an insult to teenagers everywhere"
at one extreme and "a film with some jokes that work and
some that don't" as a mainstream version of criticism, "10
Things" is one of the best high-school comedies in years--far
exceeding the so-called wit of "Jawbreaker" and more
involving, even more credible than the campy "I Know What
You Did Last Summer" and its sequel.  Padua High School,
which serves as the story's location (actually filmed in Seattle
and Tacoma) houses richniks who are more plausible than
the spoiled brats of "Clueless."  What's more its central
characters, Heath Ledger in the role of the tamer, Patrick
Verona, and Julia Stiles as the eponymous shrew, Kat, are
easy to look at.  Joseph-Gordon Levitt as the lovesick
Cameron James and Larisa Oleynik as Bianca Stratford as
the shrew's young, nicer sister Bianca, are drop-dead cuties.
   There's nothing terribly original about the plot (we've
already established that Shakespeare dealt with the theme
and he was known to plagiarize from ancient myths and
fables himself).  "10 Things" centers on the worn idea of a
young man's asking a coed to the annual prom only because
of either a bet or an offer of money.  Obviously the boy gets
to like the girl anyway, but when the girl finds out the financial
details, she's turned off.  
   In this case Kat is a stuck-up 18-year-old with a misguided
view of feminism.  She refuses the advances of all boys.  She
is determined to live her life by her own rules, not by those of
her father or of any other man.  Her father, a gynecologist
(played by Larry Miller), knows from pregnancy and refuses
to allow Kat's sister to date, or, at any rate, he permits her to
date only when Kat goes out with a man (which he assumes
will be never).  Younger sister Bianca wants to go out with
the school's conceited heartthrob, Joey, though she is shyly
pursued by Cameron.  Bianca must convince her older sister
to go to the prom and places her confidence in the
handsome, self-assured Patrick.
   A tired formula like this one need not bog a movie down. 
What brings "10 Things" to life is a series of comic scenes,
including a satiric portrait of the school guidance counselor
(Allison Janney) who writes sizzling novels with her laptop
computer on school time and the young English teacher,
(Daryl "Chill" Mitchell) who raps the lyrics of Shakespeare.
   Any young woman with sense in the movie audience would
drool over Heath Ledger, a princely dude with a provocative
Australian accent and root for him to win the affection of
haughty Katarina.  A climactic scene of Patrick's singing with
the accompaniment of the school band "I love you baby" to
the woman of his dreams who is out on the football field
works splendidly.  Larry Miller is terrifically amusing as the
understanding but overprotective father while David
Krumholtz serves well as Michael, who is Cameron's guide--
and our own--to the culture of this affluent school.  "10
Things I Hate About You" easily transcends its hackneyed
plot through vivacious acting, crackling dialogue, and
sympathetic characters.

rated PG-13
starring Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Larisa Oleynik,
David Krumholtz, Andrew Keegan, Larry Miller
written by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith
based on the play "The Taming of the Shrew" by William Shakespeare
directed by Gil Junger
In the wake of SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE's recent Oscar winnings, there
seems to be no better time to release a modern Shakespeare
adaptation. First-time director Gil Junger's 10 THINGS I HATE ABOU YOU
is loosely based on the Bard's "The Taming of the Shrew". As we find
out early in the film, the shrew, Kat Stratford(the Shakespeare
references don't end there), is most often referred to as "heinous
bitch".  Kat(Julia Stiles) is a very pretty girl, but a very
tempestuous one. To her, being nice is too normal, and she wants to do
whatever is unexpected. her sister Bianca(Larisa Oleynik), on the
other hand, is the most popular and gorgeous girl in school. But the
sisters are untouchable because their father(Larry Miller), who fears
pregnancy, will not let them date till college. But then, he decides
on a better idea. Bianca can't date until Kat dates.  It is then that
Joey(Andrew Keegan), a superficial asshole as well as a model, decides
to pay juvenile delinquent Patrick Verona(dont' mind the pun), played
by newcomer Heath Ledger, to take Kat out on a date so that he can
have Bianca to himself. But there is also the new kid Cameron(Joseph
Gordon-Levitt), who feels genuine infatuation for Bianca, and will do
anything to be near her.
The relationship between Kat and Patrick is basically the staple of
the movie, and for the most part, it works out rather nicely. But that
doesn't mean that 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU isn't contrived. There
are moments in the film in which you'll say out loud "Why would anyone
ever do that?" This film is basically nothing more than an
insignificant entry into the way-too-crowded teen movie genre, but
it's actually pretty fun for the most part, and should make most teens
happy. Julia Stiles(T.V's "The 60's") shows a lot of potential while
playing the part of Kat, and it's no surprise that she has a crowded
schedule to round out '99, including a couple more Shakespeare
adaptations.  10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU is dumb for the most
part(especially when it blatantly rips off CAN'T HARDLY WAIT), and it
is no excuse to not read Shakespeare, but it does deserve some credit
for being entertaining.

     It seems like only a few weeks ago -- probably because it was -- that
I was inveighing against the slew of "fill-in-the-blank, but with
teenagers" movies.  Still they show no sign of abating, with a
shudder-inducing sub-category creeping to the forefront:  Shakespeare, but
with teenagers.  Leading the charge (which will include a version of
OTHELLO later this year) is 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU, the under-20 set's
"Taming of the Shrew."  By all rights it should have been as incredibly
heinous as other recent juvenile jaunts, but it's actually kinda cute on
occasion.  Though still too concerned with cozying up to its audience's
sensibilities, 10 THINGS at least offers a blueprint for how to make such
material a bit more appealing.
    The setting is modern-day Padua High School of Seattle, where a
cunning plan is about to unfold.  New student Cameron James (Joseph
Gordon-Levitt) has become infatuated with beautiful, popular Bianca
Stratford (Larisa Oleynik), but he's thwarted by more than clashing
cliques.  Bianca's overprotective father (Larry Miller) has forbidden her
from dating until older sister Kat (Julia Stiles) does likewise, and Kat
is known as an ill-tempered girl with no interest in ordinary teen
pursuits like dating.  Cameron comes up with the creative solution of
finding someone to woo Kat, someone like mysterious loner Patrick Verona
(Heath Ledger).  Naturally the hard-edged Kat proves a tough shrew to
tame, until both prospective lovers begin to let their guard down.
     10 THINGS gets a leg up on most of its genre cousins simply by
putting people on the screen who can act a lick.  Julia Stiles is a
charming, smart and fresh presence as Kat, giving here attitude a little
something more than _just_ attitude; Australian actor Heath Ledger makes
for a nice foil with his combination of hulking presence and sensitivity;
and David Krumholtz has a solid comic relief role as Cameron's nerdy
comrade.  The adult roles are also satisfying for a change, primarily
because they aren't used simply as walls off of which teens can bounce
insults.  While Larry Miller obsesses as the Stratford' girls' teen
pregnancy-obsessed papa, Daryl "Chill" Mitchell gets a few funny scenes as
an angry English teacher and Allison Janney composes explicit romance
novels as guidance counselor Ms. Perky.  I actually found myself chuckling
at most of these characters instead of wishing desperately that they'd
just go away.
     Much of the credit for that should also go to writers Karen McCullah
Lutz and Kirsten Smith, who give the dialogue a bite that goes beyond
insult humor and high school patois.  Some of the best lines are
unprintable -- including Patrick's curiosity over why Bianca is so
desirable -- but they all seem to have been given at least a little
thought.  While the situations are teen-film predictable -- a party scene,
a prom scene, plenty of threats and posturing -- occasionally the writing
emerges to deliver an unexpected laugh.  It's not brilliant, but it's a
sharp step up from stupid.
     As likeable as parts of 10 THINGS aare, it's hard to get overly
enthusiastic about it.  Veteran sit-com director Gil Junger, making his
feature debut, slaps on a generous coat of sit-com glossiness, leaving
little room for the truly acidic wordplay of a "Taming of the Shrew."
It's a warm and fuzzy sort of teen film with some welcome positive
messages about independent thought and valuing depth of character, yet it
still rarely rises above the level of the blandly generic.  It might have
had a chance if so many sub-plots hadn't been packed into a tight
94-minute package, short-changing them all with shallowness.  Still, it's
enough of a surprise to find a teen film that doesn't overstay its welcome
instantly, let alone deserves more fleshing out.  It's enough to give you
hope that there's actually a good movie to be made in 1999 "...with
teenagers."

The lack of Cold War movies has left a gap --but the teen genres never die,
Shakespeare is up, classic English novels are up, and the old repertories
of American directors and writers have given way to a bewildering number of
new names, both in mainstream and independent film-making.
It was fated that at some point literature and high school would finally
meet. They did in 10 Things, but whoa! You don't really expect a high
school flick with students studying and learning, do you? No such thing in
the Land of the Free.
The way the Bard and the kids get together, as directed by a an experiences
TV person inhis first featurem and as written by first-timers, is to take
The Taming of the Shrew and deviously transport it to an institution of
middle non-education. Well, it's Shakespeare and not Shakespeare, in about
the proportions of a mouse to an elephant. But it's a big mouse. Still,
those who call this movie an updating or modernizing of the play should
have their Bard examined.I wonder why the credits don't say "Based on an
idea by Bill Shakespeare"?
There's a general concept of the father and the daughters. Here Padua's
Signor Baptista becomes Walter Stratford, his senior daughter Katharina
("Kiss Me Kate") is Kat, and the younger one, Bianca, remains Bianca.
The Stratford girls (get the joke?) go to Padua (sic) High School that
ought to get acting credit here. Played by that huge, superbly kitschy
Stadium High School in Tacoma, it looks like a cross between some of the
palaces the oil-barons built some 100 years ago, the Chateau Frontenac of
Quebec City, and other massively wild follies.
Bianca, who's vague and vaguely sweet, is popular. Period. There's nothing
vague about Kat. She's clearly a brilliant. But also a young Dragon Lady,
though unladylike as she goes around spreading haughtily her misanthropy,
militant feminism, disrespect (to put it mildly) of the entire staff and
student body whom she insults perpetually for their conformism, stupidity,
you name it. Her tongue is caustic and tart, and I don't mean like a Tarte
Tatin. Her manners are to match. She even backs up on purpose into the car
of Joey Donner, the school's pretty boy (and a professional model) who is
full of money and you-know-what. (Well, he had it coming).
The kids, with some exceptions (for audiences who keep up with TV) are not
played by familiar faces. They look generic, including Bianca and Kat, no
beauties, but then the latter, Julia Stiles, does a beaut of a job with her
role. If I ever wanted to cast Ilse Koch ("The Bitch of Buchenwald") I'd go
to Julia. In uniform, with boots, a couple of German shephers dogs and a
thicker waist, she'd be perfect.
Daddy is played with restrained humor by Larry Miller in a secondary but
original role. A single parent, an MD . A  gynecologist I believe, but then
the movie has the habit of leaving matters vague and with loose ends. He's
seen too many awful pregnancies, births, abortions and such. While
interestingly chummy with his girls he's firm about their keeping their
virginity. No dates, no fooling around, he has decreed. This may be OK with
Kat, whom he knows well. After school he casually asks her "Did you make
anybody cry today?"  "Sadly, no" she replies "But it's only 4:30."  That's
what's known as a felicitous repartee.
Bianca is another story. She's itching to go on a date, especially with
local Lothario Joey who has her in his sights. Eventually, smart Daddy
comes up with a pronunciamento. "You can date if Kat does" which he is
positive will never happen. And thereby hangs the essence of the story.
To liberate Bianca, Joey tries to set up Kat with someone. No piece of
cake, this. The only possible candidate is tough-looking, Australian-born
(like the actor who plays him) Patrick Verona (Get the references to Two
Gentlemen of Verona?)  But Patrick is no gentleman, or so it would seem.
"What! He's a CRIMINAL! " exclaims one of the boys who is assisting Joey so
that some other pal who's sweet on Bianca can have a chance.  He recites a
litany of the would-be suitor's horrible record which includes a break from
San Quentin (or something of the sort) and facts such as "He sold his own
liver for a new pair of speakers!" "He ate a live duck!"  Unfazed, Joey
bribes Patrick to date Kat, even though the boy from Down Under keeps
upping the ante. And that's where the courtship, the taming, the rigueur
misunderstandings begin.
It's an odd thing. Up to this approximate point the movie was clever and
very entertaining nonsense and way out funny details. But as we reach what
should be the core of the story, things go limp. Sure, there were cliches
before this, but freshly and imaginatively cooked, along with some original
bits.
Now the totally predictable is upon us, with unnecessary diversions,
sub-plots and asides that distract, add dead weight, put the breaks on what
was until now a fast-moving car. Kat is delighted to get accepted by Sarah
Lawrence College (back East) but Daddy is unhappy that she'll be so far.
So? Patrick visits a rather dismal femme-club. This adds little to the
developments.  I expected Maenads to attack this sole male customer, but
no.
Pat is too quickly,too obviously transformed, via hairdo and makeup, from
the "criminal," sullen type to a nice, neat fellow. Luxury student cars
abound. They limit the human interest as they set the film among the
Children of the Rich. (At least either Kat or Bianca leaven this later by
asking Dad "What's a hot rod?")
Irrelevancies and inconsistencies gather. At a party (deja vu all over
again), Kat gets drunk, which is what reveals her true (i.e.nice but
hidden) self. Is this promoting liquor among the under-aged as a catalyst
of truth? By party-time the film has lost its impetus, has become aimless.
It puts in too much padding --which means that there's too little for the
movie proper.  The inevitable prom, the Golden Fleece of high school
movies, doesn't help either.
No question about it, there are nuggets even among the pebbles of Part II :
Kat's brazen, sexy invasion of a detention schoolroom; recurring quotations
from Shakespeare's other works, aimed, no doubt, at the literati. Even
better, in both parts are several scenes with two supporting characters who
steal the show again and again. Mr. Morgan is a most likable and
non-cliched teacher of English (or writing) who raps deliciously the lines
of the Bard and whose familiar give-and-take with his students is sheer
pleasure. Equally appealing is Mrs. Perky, the guidance counselor whose own
rapport with the kids is a howl, especially as she never stops writing a
porno novel on her desk-top computer. Hilarious. And she casually asks both
the students and her secretary for synonyms, as for an enlarged male
member. Fast-reacting Kat comes up with a winner: "tumescent."
A pity that this picture starts on a strong three-star level but loses
steam approximately past  the halfway mark. Perhaps one should eventually
get a video and save on tape all the scenes with Dr. Stratford, Mr. Morgan
and Mrs. Perky.

"10 Things I Hate About You," a movie almost as warm and witty as its
title suggests, is the latest attempt to dress up Shakespeare in hip
garb.  Taking its inspiration from "Taming of the Shrew," "10 Things"
also throws in some slightly more contemporary ingredients - 1980s New
Wave hits, 1990s sexual frankness, etc. - and whips them into a bland
concoction that's a lot closer to sludge than it is to froth.  The
result seems to go on for weeks rather than hours; suffice it to say
there are a lot more than 10 things wrong with this film.
There's also one thing very right about it, the casting of Julia
Stiles as Kat Stratford, a high school student who drives around
listening to Joan Jett's "Bad Reputation" and who is denounced by her
classmates as a "bitter, self-righteous hag," even though she's quite
lovely in the rare moments when she's smiling instead of snarling. Kat
prefers reading Sylvia Plath and mailing out college applications to
socializing with the gang at Padua High, much to the dismay of her
younger, peppier and far more popular sister Bianca (Larisa Oleynik),
who prowls the campus in sundresses she apparently has been sewn into.
That makes Bianca prime date-bait, but Dad (Larry Miller), an
obstetrician who spends his days "up to my elbows in placenta" thanks
to teen pregnancies, has forbidden Bianca to go out until Kat finds a
guy, something that seems about as likely as Puff Daddy writing one of
his own songs. It's up to Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Bianca's
would-be beau, to contrive a solution that will get Kat out of the
house and put Bianca by his side.
The pleasingly acerbic Stiles, one of the few redeeming factors about
the recent mini-series "The '60s," gives it her all, and if the script
of "10 Things" had had one-tenth the zest of the now-classic
"AtomicShakespeare" episode of the TV series "Moonlighting" (which
also used "Shrew" as its springboard) she might have managed to make
something of the vehicle.  Unfortunately, as "10 Things" turns into
another guy-makes-bet-about-girl story, it ends up covering much of
the same territory as "She's All That," and with much less charm and
wit.
The dialogue is resolutely flat - "where did you come from? The planet
Loser?" Bianca asks Kat in one typical crack -and by the time
screenwriters Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith drop in the
inevitable "you're sooo not who I thought you were" scene, the film is
a lost cause.
It is worth mentioning, however, that Lutz and Smith are kind enough
to put in some bits that the Bard forgot to write, such as a
rollicking teen beer bash and a finale set at a prom that features not
one, but two second-rate bands. So much for the evolution of art in
the last 400-odd years.

1999 - 98 minutes
Rated PG-13 (for profanity and sex-related material).
Reviewed April 3, 1999.
In December of 1996, a little movie called "Scream," was released, 
became a box-office smash, and resurrected films targeted at teens. 
First, it was teen slasher movies that were the big fad (both "Scream" 
movies, "I Know What You Did Last Summer," "Urban Legend," etc.), but 
just recently, the popularity has switched over to the teen comedy genre 
(a 'la '80s John Hughes), starting with last June's "Can't Hardly Wait." 
It may be the first week of April in 1999, but so far this year we have 
been given a movie aimed at the 25-and-under market almost every single 
week: "Varsity Blues," "Jawbreaker," "Cruel Intentions," "Simply 
Irresistible," "The Rage: Carrie 2," and "The Mod Squad." Coming April 9 
are two more of this type: "Never Been Kissed" and "Go," and on April 
23, we've got the teen satire "Election" and the teen horror-comedy 
"Idle Hands." Jeesh! Out of all of these moves, however, the one that is 
most similar to the latest incarnation, "10 Things I Hate About You," is 
this past January's mediocre, ho-hum "She's All That." Although similar 
in plotting (ok, darn near identical), "10 Things I Hate About You," a 
modern-day version of Shakespeare's "The Taming of the Shrew" ("She's 
All That" got its inspiration from "Pygmalion"), is an infinitely 
superior film in every department, from the smart direction by 
first-time feature director Gil Junger to the charming and well-written 
screenplay by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith to the striking 
ensemble cast, who give the best group of performances in a teen comedy 
since 1985's "The Breakfast Club." And to top it all off, in the 
inevitable climax set at the prom, at least we didn't have to once again 
suffer through a goofy, inappropriate dance sequence (who could forget, 
or want to remember, for that matter, this ludicrous development in 
"She's All That?").
The day wide-eyed, shy new student Cameron James (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) 
starts school at Seattle-based Padua High, he is swept away at the sight 
of the beautiful and popular sophomore, Bianca Stratford (Larisa 
Oleynik). Although he doesn't know french, he purposefully learns some 
of it just so he can tutor her, but finds that her paranoid gynecologist 
father (Larry Miller) won't allow her to date until her bitter, 
unconventional older sister, Kat (Julia Stiles), a senior, decides to. 
Kat, of course, has sworn off the likes of boys, but Cameron sets out to 
find someone that will be the perfect match for her, which is exactly 
what he finds in the form of the rebellious Patrick Verona (Heath 
Ledger). Complicating matters, Cameron's dorky friend, Michael (David 
Krumholtz), decides to use a wealthy jock, Joey (Andrew Keegan), who 
also has his sights set on Bianca, as a pawn so that he will pay Patrick 
to get Kat to go out with him, and then Cameron hopes to steal Bianca 
away from Joey.
As you can see, "10 Things I Hate About You" includes a huge number of 
characters, some of which I haven't even mentioned, such as Kat's 
Shakespeare-obsessed friend, Mandella (Susan May Pratt) and Bianca's 
materialistic comrade, Chastity (Gabrielle Union). At a short, but 
well-used running time of 98 minutes, all of the characters are 
perfectly handled, satisfyingly developed, and, for the most part, are 
not treated as caricatures (another flaw of "She's All That," where the 
bad guys (and gals) ran around constantly saying, "you're vapor"). Since 
I could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central 
characters, and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were 
surprisingly effective, I got completely caught up in all of the 
relationships and was thoroughly entertained.
Aside from a good screenplay, it's the performances that can make or 
break a movie, and director Junger has really hit the jackpot. Aside 
from Joseph Gordon-Levitt ("3rd Rock from the Sun"), who gives his 
strongest performance to date here, none of the actors are that 
well-known, but it is this aspect that brings a particular freshness to 
the proceedings. As the main character of Kat, Julia Stiles (last seen 
in the miniseries "The '60s") is marvelous and always believable, and 
certainly has a bright future ahead of her. Even though it is her role 
that is initially the most difficult and hard-edged, it was easy to 
identify with Kat's way of thinking (she is against the silly tradition 
of the prom and loves reading Sylvia Plath), and I completely admired 
her individuality. No one, I think, could have portrayed her as 
perfectly as Stiles does. Heath Ledger, as the infamous bad-boy of the 
town, injects much life into Patrick, and has a lot of chemistry with 
Stiles. One other actor of note is Larisa Oleynik who, with the help of 
screenwriters Lutz and Smith, is able to turn Bianca into a person with 
multi-dimensions, even though she is accurately self-centered at the 
on-set. In one truthful scene, Cameron angrily asks her if she has 
always been so selfish, and Bianca grudgingly realizes that yes, she 
has. 
One off-beat element of the film, and a source of some hearty laughs, is 
the way that the school's staff act, which is strikingly unformal. 
Allison Janney, as the guidance counselor Ms. Perky, who is writing a 
trashy Harlequin romance novel, is comic dynamite, as is Daryl "Chill" 
Mitchell as the english teacher, who reads Shakespeare to the class in 
rap and, at one point, sends Kat to the office because, for once, she 
actually thinks one of his assignments is really good. Although there 
are a few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning, 
most of it actually works, especially in the humorous and witty dialogue 
exchanges and quirks between the characters. In one very funny scene, 
Chastity asks, "I know people can be overwhelmed, and they can be 
underwhelmed, but can people just be...whelmed?" At another point, 
Bianca and Kat's father (a stand-out Larry Miller), who is constantly 
terrified that his daughters are going to get pregnant, only allows 
Bianca to go to the prom on one occasion: before she leaves, she has to 
put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of what it's 
like to be pregnant.
"10 Things I Hate About You" once and for all proves that there is still 
life in the teen comedy genre, and this movie is probably more 
reminiscent of the great John Hughes than any other film of the '90s. It 
also helps that the movie has a perfectly-assembled soundtrack, mixing 
indie-rock with new wave '80s songs (and with, thank goodness, no rap). 
By the film's end, it actually had me rooting for certain characters to 
get together, and I was also quite pleased with how everything was 
wrapped up, especially in the final scenes involving Kat and Bianca, Kat 
and her father, and a flawlessly-acted and moving sequence in which Kat 
gets up to read the poem she has written for her english class (this is 
where the title comes from). Luckily, I doubt I would be able to find 
ten things I hate about "10 Things I Hate About You," but the positive 
aspects of the film far out-number ten.

10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU (Touchstone - 1999)
Cast: Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles, Joseph Gordon-Levitt,
      Larisa Oleynik, David Krumholtz, Andrew Keegan
Screenplay by Karen McCullah Lutz & Kirsten Smith
Produced by Andrew Lazar
Directed by Gil Junger
Running time: 97 minutes 
Note: Some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers.
      Be forewarned. 
    -------------------------------------------------------------
   When recently asked why I continue to bother with the mostly
   disappointing influx of recent teen films, I responded that I was
   looking for the next CLUELESS.  From its broad outline and sunny
   veneer, veteran TV sitcom director Gil Junger's feature film debut,
   10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU, would appear to be a worthy successor but
   falls decidedly short of the mark.
   Like CLUELESS, which reworked the plot from Jane Austen's "Emma" and
   transported it into a modern high school setting, 10 THINGS I HATE
   ABOUT YOU is a liberal adaptation of Shakespeare's comedy "The Taming
   Of The Shrew" set in the teen scene of the 1990s.  Unlike the Amy
   Heckerling picture, which breezily redid Austen without drawing overt
   attention to itself, this picture not only winks at the Bard, but
   gives a full-out bow to its antecedent -- with characters named
   Stratford and Verona attending Padua High, dialogue excerpts lifted
   directly from his plays, sonnet writing and a peripheral character
   obsessed with Shakespeare, it's hard to miss the connection even if
   the picture's tagline wasn't "How do I loathe thee?  Let me count the
   ways."
   Using the play as a jumping point, the picture introduces Stratford
   sisters Katarina (Julia Stiles) and Bianca (Larisa Oleynik), whose
   attitudes towards the social scene are at polar extremes -- Bianca's
   bubbly and wildly popular, while tempestuous Kat is a hard-line
   feminist who's indifferent to peer acceptance.  Much to Bianca's
   dismay, both of them are forbidden to date by decree of their
   overprotective father (Larry Miller), who tweaks the longstanding
   rule at the beginning of the picture to allow her to date once her
   older sister finds a suitor as well.  "But she's a mutant!" Bianca
   cries.  "What if she *never* dates?"  Anxious to woo Bianca, two
   dueling suitors -- narcissistic model Joey (Andrew Keegan) and nice
   guy Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) -- embark on a scheme to set up
   the notoriously hostile Kat with a new boyfriend, and resort to the
   outlawish new bad boy in town, Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger).
   The reworking of the story becomes rather creaky at times, and the
   teen film formula providing the support for this revised tale is
   glaringly apparent; to the beat, we can count on the requisite
   disposable party scene, the prom sequence, and the heartwrenching
   break-up and warm fuzzy reconciliation scenes to make their
   appearances; it's all inevitable material played in routine fashion.
   10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU also mildly suffers from being preceded by
   a few months by SHE'S ALL THAT, another teen film with a familiar,
   virtually identical plot (suitor is bribed to date unpopular heroine,
   with expected repercussions).
   The film is also rather slack in its setup.  While Kat's proudly
   nonconformist nature and disdain for the teen social sphere is
   wonderfully established in her wordless opening scene, the rest of
   the characters aren't particularly well-drawn before the mechanics of
   the plot kick into action.  In terms of its narrative, there's
   nothing remotely surprising in 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU -- all of
   the characters get their just desserts, even the goofy comic relief
   sidekick (David Krumholtz), so satisfaction with the storytelling
   lies solely with how engaging and sympathetic the players are drawn.
   The rebellious disposition of outsider Patrick is especially sketchy
   and unconvincing (rumours abound that he once ate a live duck sans
   beak and feet -- umm, sure), and that his misunderstood character is
   clearly a kind and gentle soul from the outset undermines interest in
   the early scenes of courtship between the supposed mismatched pair.
   Nonetheless, it's almost certainly the romantic angle between the two
   leads which carry the film, far moreso than the broad, scattershot
   and often juvenile comedy which typifies the remainder of the
   picture.  Stiles, who has the movie's plum role as the "shrewish" Kat
   and turns in a noteworthy performance brimming with intelligence, has
   nice chemistry with the likeable Ledger, and the relationship which
   emerges between their seemingly-disparate characters is entirely
   predictable yet appealing.  After setting the wheels in motion, the
   uncompelling romantic triangle involving Joey, Bianca and Cameron
   (whom the film gives misleading prominence at the outset) fades into
   the background as the volatile courtship between Kat and Patrick
   develops.  Also solid are the always-dependable Allison Janney in a
   glorified cameo as an unconcerned guidance counselor, and Daryl
   "Chill" Mitchell, who's very funny as the literature teacher
   exasperated with Kat's biting insights.
   The picture is also supported by a terrific, jubilant pop soundtrack
   dominated by songs from Letters To Cleo which imbues much energy into
   the aggressively-likable film.  It's also a nice (and somewhat
   disorienting) coup to feature an ensemble cast in a teen movie
   comprised largely of actual teen actors -- after watching endless
   groups of early- and even late-twentysomethings assuming these roles
   in other likeminded pictures, it's a refreshing bit of casting.  10
   THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU is a high-spirited, effervescent movie full
   of life which, while not quite as touching as it's meant to be nor
   nearly as funny as it ought to be (the outtakes during the credits
   are as amusing as anything in the film itself), is a pleasant, if
   totally forgettable, diversion.  CLUELESS, it ain't, though.

10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU (PG).  
(Touchstone/Buena Vista International)
Director: Gil Junger
Stars: Julia Stiles, Heath Ledger, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Larisa Oleynik, 
Andrew Keegan, David Krumholtz, Larry Miller, Susan May Pratt, Gabrielle
Union, Daryl "Chill" Mitchell, Allison Janney, Kyle Cease, David Leisure.
        Shakespeare gets a contemporary workout in this enjoyable teen
comedy which has broad audience appeal.  Essentially a modern version
of The Taming Of The Shrew set in a Seattle high school, 10 Things I
Hate About You uses the broad threads of the play to explore more
relevant themes and issues.
The shy Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, from popular tv sitcom
Third Rock From The Sun, etc) wants to date the beautiful and popular
Bianca Stafford (Larisa Oleynik).  The stumbling block is her older,
shrewish sister Katrina (Julia Stiles), who loves death metal, the
morbid poetry of Sylvia Plath, and whose sharp tongue drives away any
boy who shows even the slightest interest in her.  The girls' single
father (Larry Miller) constantly worries about his two daughters, and
forbids Bianca to go on a date unless Katrina also has a date.
Cameron is faced with the impossible mission of trying to coerce
someone to go out on a date with Katrina.
The answer to his dilemma lies in Patrick (played by Aussie
actor Heath Ledger, best known for his role in the short-lived series
Roar), the new boy in school.  Patrick has a reputation as a wild man
and is dogged by rumours about a dark past, all of which makes him
perfect for the challenge.  Cameron somehow has to persuade Patrick to
date Bianca.  Enter narcissistic and smarmy rich boy Joey Donner
(Andrew Keegan, from Independence Day, etc) to further confuse the
mix, and the scene is set for the typical showdown during the school
prom.
With its exploration of the cut throat world of high school
politics et al, the film ventures into familiar territory (most
recently She's All That, Jawbreaker, etc).  However, the script from
first time writers Karen McCullah Lutz and Kristen Smith is smart and
witty, and puts a fresh spin on some familiar and tired clichés.
Although some of the key plot developments may be fairly predictable,
10 Things I Hate About You sustains the interest, and is surprisingly
entertaining for this over done genre.
Director Gil Junger hails from a background in television, and
he knows how to milk the material for its humour.  There are some
clever sight gags, and the smart, bitchy dialogue will appeal to
broader audiences as well.  The performances of the young, largely
unknown cast are enthusiastic and bring these selfish and shallow
characters to life in likeable enough fashion.

(originally written for the Ubyssey, the student newspaper for the
University of British Columbia.  Unfortunately, it got cut for space)
   Keeping in the spirit of the film's title, here are ten things to
either like or dislike about the film.
10: Likely inspired by the success of William Shakespeare's Romeo +
Juliet, 10 Things I Hate About You is a modernized retelling of
Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew. While the original was about a much
loved Bianca who cannot marry until her older sister Kate is wed, the
retelling takes place in high school, where the most popular girl in
school (by Larisa Oleynik) can't date until her older, unpopular sister
does (by Julia Stiles). Not necessarily a bad thing in itself, but do
filmmakers really believe that all teenagers suffer from attention
deficit disorder and will only be interested in a more candy-coated
Shakespeare?
9: Note the key word "high school." This is a warning bell for any
moviegoer over the age of 21, especially with the teenage films with
very limited appeal for anyone not in the demographic. Fair enough. The
Generation X crowd had The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and
16 Candles, but we look back at these films with fond memories. Will the
current rash of teenage films like The Mod Squad (which I hated), Cruel
Intentions, and 10 Things be remembered in by current teens when they
become adults?
8: Still, 10 Things has a lot of charm and humour that may just make it
memorable. Despite the crude level of humour in much of the film (ie:
penis jokes, sheep jokes, and kicks to the groin), the film comes off
surprisingly well, something not expected of a film aimed at teens. The
adult characters are the more memorable ones, including standouts as the
perpetually horny guidance counselor, Kat and Bianca's overprotective
father, and Kat's English teacher.
7: But as befits a teenage film, 10 Things is riddled with some bad
clichés and stereotypes. For example, Bianca is the most popular girl in
the school, she's about as dumb as a piece of toast (this stopped being
funny a long time ago). While Kat is the most unpopular girl in school,
yet one look and you'd wonder why. The most popular guy has a really
fancy car and is a real jerk. And so forth.
6: Also a modern epidemic in the film biz is the 90-minute music video
being passed off as a film. Much of the time it feels like the
filmmakers are trying to sell copies of the soundtrack instead of
entertaining the audience. Please refer to the comment on teenagers with
ADD.
5: The performances are actually pretty good, although not much of a
stretch, considering that the actors and actresses actually are
teenagers (although in real life, Larisa Oleynik and Julia Stiles are
the same age). However, it does break the convention of teenagers being
played by actors and actresses in their late 20s.
4: While many moments in the film are rather charming, it eventually
gets to the point of inducing hyperglycemia. While the "aww, shucks"
kinda moments are well executed, the film's conclusion (which is
predictable, even if you haven't read Taming of the Shrew) cannot go by
fast enough. Some audience members may benefit from bringing along a
toothbrush.
3: Most importantly, many of the more misogynist elements from Taming of
the Shrew were removed when adapted. Despite the earlier complaint about
a candy-coated Shakespeare, 10 Things definitely have more resonance
with a more contemporary audience. 
2: Unless you want to be reminded of your age and how long it has
actually been since you've attended high school, this film is not for
you. For anyone who has been out of high school for more than two years,
this film is guaranteed to make you feel extremely old.
1: Regardless, 10 Things is a worthy adaptation of a classic, which
despite its limited appeal, actually manages to entertain.
Rating: 6.5/10 (8/10, if I was much younger)

10 Things I Hate About You (1999) 2 stars out of 4. Starring Julia Stiles
and Heath Ledger.
10 Things I Hate About You is a simplified and simplistic adaptation of
Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew.
 Set at upscale Padua High School, the story revolves around the Stratford
sisters, Kat and Bianca.
 Kat is the school bitch, a senior who hates guys and lives by her own
convictions. Bianca is a sophomore, the belle of the school, a popular girl
every guy wants to date.
 But there's a catch. As in the original, Bianca can have nothing to do
with the opposite sex until Kat is wooed. In other words, until Kat gets a
date, Bianca must sit at home and wait.
 The movie deviates from Shakespeare in several aspects, most notably
giving Kat a valid psychological reason for her disdain of boys.
 And while 10 Things I Hate About You is not as intellectually stimulating
nor as bawdy as the original, it has enough to satisfy young viewers and
give them a sampling of the Bard's wit and style.
 A cast of basically unknown young actors breathe life into this 90-plus
minute confection, led by Julia Stiles as Kat and Heath Ledger as Patrick
Verona, the bad-ass student hired to tame "the shrew."
 The movie lacks weight. It's a fast-food film, easy to digest, but nothing
remarkable or memorable.
 10 Things I Hate About You follows in the wake of Clueless and Cruel
Intentions, making the classics palatable for younger, unsophisticated
audiences. Whether it stimulates young viewers to the point of actually
reading the originals is problematic.
 Older audiences may find the proceedings juvenile, but 10 Things I Hate
About You is a fun date movie for the under-25 crowd.
 The only reason Shakespeare would roll over in his grave is any lack of
credit for inspiring this update. But, that's Hollywood for you.

Love and lust, however they might be combined, are probably the most
fascinating of human endeavors. People will do the strangest things when
obsessed with either. A combination of the two emotions is almost deadly. With
the stars in the eyes, rational thought goes out the window and a beautiful
delirium takes over.
Lovers will reveal their innermost selves to each other and often it's a
person that the outside world never sees. The hard-edged and cruel can turn
into puppy dogs. On the other hand, the nicest person in the world might
become a maelstrom. It's a fascinating thing to watch from the outside and an
alternate dimension from the inside.
Kat Stratford (Julia Stiles) and Heath Ledger (Patrick Verona) are seemingly a
couple made in hell. She's an hot blooded opinionated ill-tempered high school
beauty who has sworn off men. He's the local bad boy, drilling holes in text
books during shop class.
Kat's younger sister Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) is the opposite of her sibling.
She desperately wants to be popular and has her sights set on pretty boy male
model Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan). Her problem is that her dad won't let her
date until Kat does. Kat has no intentions of hanging out with the local male riff-raff.
Nerdish Cameron James (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is smitten with Bianca and
hatches a plot to toss Kat into the dating pool. He schemes with Joey and they
approach Heath with an offer he can't refuse. They offer him money to take out
the unapproachable Kat.
Loosely based on Shakespeare's "The Taming Of The Shrew", this is a notch
above current teen films. The characters are lively without being
unbelievable; humorous, but not remarkably stupid. There's a definite
chemistry between Stiles and Verona and both could become box office draws.
An aberration for high school films, the adults also have decent roles. Daryl
"Chill" Mitchell has a small but entertaining part as a literature teacher.
("I know Shakespeare is a dead white guy, but he knows his shit.") Larry
Miller is great as the girls' father. Unfortunately he is saddled with lame dialog.
There are other problems with the film. In any good story, the characters
eventually go through changes. Here they appear to transform instantaneously.
Bianca is shallow and self-centered and suddenly she's not. Heath is the
school bully but after 30 seconds with Kat, it turns out he's really an angel.
The biggest flaw is a plot device that must have been old even in the Bard's
time. After being paid to date Kat, Heath falls for her. It doesn't take an
olde English scholar to know that she's going to find out about the conspiracy
and break up with him.
This isn't a perfect film, but after the recent horrendous movies aimed at the
younger market, it's a tiny ray of hope.
(Michael Redman has written this column for over 575 fortnights and decided
that he'd write another one even though the perfect light-hearted film remains
elusive. Email tales of love and lust to Redman@indepen.com.)

Gil Junger, the director of 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU, had an idea.
He'd remake Shakespeare's "The Taming of the Shrew" and cast it with
teen actors.  Unfortunately that's only idea he seems to have had.  Even
if Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith's script, which is very loosely
based on the play, has some funny moments, it's so knowingly cute that
most of its jokes go nowhere.
The director, who lets his actors drift without guidance, falls back on
a series of hackneyed sight gags to pump up the laughs -- an
out-of-control motorbike goes flying over a hill, an errant arrow hits
the instructor in the rear and an oral sex gag tries to rival the hair
gel joke from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY.
The story is set at Padua High -- you're laughing already, right?  A
high school sophomore, Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik), isn't allowed
to date until bitchy senior sister, Kat (Julia Stiles), agrees to date.
Kat, who describes the boys at Padua as "unwashed miscreants," prides
herself on being repulsive.
The high school is filled with the stereotypes found these days in high
schools in the movies.  These include the beautiful people, the future
MBAs, the coffee drinkers, the audio-visual geeks, the jocks, and the
cowboys.
Into this mix comes a new student named Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
Innocent looking Cameron is instantly pegged as being unworthy to speak
to the beautiful people.  Although a wimp, he sets his sights on the
"unobtainable" Bianca.  The school's Mr. Beautiful, an underwear model
named Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan), thinks he already has dibs on her.
Cameron tries to hire someone to date Kat, thus making Bianca available.
In an interview sequence, the best response comes from one lad who
laughs off the prospect of asking Kat out.  "Maybe if we were the last
two people on earth, and there were no sheep," he laughs in response and
then adds, "Are there sheep?"
Kat's equivalent on the male side is one Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger),
who is so tough he's reputedly sold his own liver and even eaten a live
duck.  With his handsome flowing locks, his not-so-hidden beauty matches
that of Kat's.  He is the one who accepts the challenge and financial
rewards of attempting to date her.
Besides the film's cliched predictability, the major problem is the lack
of convincing characters.  One minute Patrick is obnoxious, and the next
he's sweet.  Similarly, after Kat guzzles hard liquor at a party, she
goes from sober to puking drunk and right back to sober in a matter of
seconds.  One suspects that all of the film's leads are talented, but
this movie makes it hard to be sure.  There are some sparks here and
there, but the film never really ignites.
10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU runs 1:35.  It is rated PG-13 for profanity,
explicit sexual humor and underage drinking and would be acceptable for
teenagers.

PLANET SICK-BOY:  http://www.sick-boy.com
Surely you've already heard that Hollywood has run out of original
ideas.  So you shouldn't be surprised that the sharpest and most
successful films recently released are classic novels or plays reworked
into modern settings with young stars, preferably from popular
television shows.  It started with Clueless (Austen's `Emma') a few
years back.  Then there was William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet.  So
far this year we've had She's All That (Shaw's `Pygmalion') and Cruel
Intentions (de Laclos' `Dangerous Liaisons').  And don't forget new
version of Shakespeare's `Othello' and `Hamlet' due later this year, as
well as a more traditional rendition of `A Midsummer Night's Dream.'
10 Things is essentially Shakespeare's `The Taming of the Shrew' set in
present-day America.  It's about two sisters  one popular (Larisa
Oleynik, The Secret World of Alex Mack) and one dubbed `a heinous bitch'
by her peers (Julia Stiles, The Devil's Own).  Like the play, they are
respectively named Bianca and Kat(e) and they live in a town called
Padua.  Bianca has many suitors, but isn't allowed to go out with boys
until her older sister is ready to date.
Enter new Padua High student Cameron (Joseph-Gordon Levitt, 3rd Rock
>From the Sun) who instantly falls for the pasty Bianca and cooks up a
plan to persuade popular jock Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan) to pay the
school psycho to date Kat.  Of course, he's not really a psycho; he's
just misunderstood because he has long hair, wears dark-colored clothes
and works in the metal shop.  His name is Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger,
Roar), and he quickly realizes that taming this shrew might be a lot
more difficult than he had originally thought.
The script is surprisingly witty and filled with razor-sharp barbs
hurled from just about every character.  And that's pretty shocking,
considering it came from a writing duo (Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten
Smith) with no previous screenplay experience.  While avoiding an `R'
rating, they manage to weave a tapestry of near-obscenities that will
make even the most cynically jaded adult chuckle just as loud as the
pre-teens that this film's marketing campaign will target.  Particularly
funny are Padua's English teacher (Daryl Mitchell, Veronica's Closet)
and guidance counselor (Allison Janney, Private Parts).  (1:38  PG-13
for some mild adult language and situations)

Good ol' William Shakespeare. Ya gotta give the guy credit. 
First, he's an awfully prolific writer, turning out more performances
than Mel Brooks. Second, he writes romantic poetry that is the envy of
any man who's ever wooed a woman. (And we're not talking about any old
"one fish two fish red fish blue fish" junk; we're talking about sonnets
the length of a Bible that nobody understands but everyone pretends to.)
And third, people still read his stuff today, and, on the outside, they
make a couple movies about it now and then. 
The latest of these is an adaptation of the Bard's romantic comedy, THE
TAMING OF THE SHREW, otherwise known as veteran TV director Gil Junger's
10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU. Interestingly enough, the movie has a
twofold purpose, which hints at an intelligence not normally found in
teen comedies such as this. First, Junger's film begs to be stood
against Shakespearean movies which display a mastery of the English
language and use to inspire laughter, tears, and thought. Second,
Junger's film begs to be stood against the trite genre of the teen
romance, which boasts unworthy competition like SHE'S ALL THAT and ROMEO
+ JULIET. In both respects, the movie makes great strides. 
In regards to the first of the two marks, the script is written not only
intelligently and articulately, but also with a story to tell. The Karen
Lutz and Kirsten Smith script takes a straightforward romantic idea --
girl can't date unless undesireable sister does, boy interested in girl
hires other boy to date sister, other boy and sister fall in love -- and
front-loads it with clever English. Unlike 1996's ROMEO + JULIET,
however, the movie does not distract with such poetic dialogue; instead,
it adds to the movie's value as a witty comedy. And wit is most
definitely the best way to present a teen romance. 
The teen romance -- the second of the two areas for 10 THINGS to cover
-- is also better than usual. Our boy Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt,
who's really a wimp for most of the movie) is interested in the lovely
Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik), but Bianca can't date unless her
less-than-desireable sister Kat (Julia Stiles) does. So Cameron, with
the help of his friend Michael (David Krumholtz), goes about hiring a
date for Kat. They succeed in getting outcast Patrick Verona (Heath
Legder), and thus the plot is in motion. The plot itself does not make
the movie succeed, but instead, the fresh approach does. New faces
outweight the clichés (like the oily KARATE KID-esque villain or the
predictable falling-out between Kat and Patrick), and almost every actor
present has talent. 
So 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU succeeds at both of the paths it tries,
and for this it's a most welcome entry into contemporary cinema.
Definitely a worthwhile flick, and definitely the best date flick of the
year thus far.

Ten Things I Hate About 10 Things I Hate About You:
10. The Downsizing of Shakespeare.  Poor William Shakespeare.  Who'd
have thought his plays could sink so low.  10 Things I Hate About You is
loosely (very loosely) based upon his play, The Taming of the Shrew.
Updated to a modern high school setting, the movie strips away virtually
all of the dialogue, characterizations and plot.  What's left?  Some
vaguely recognizable names: instead of Katharina, we are given Kat
(Julia Stiles); instead of Petruchio, the film gives us Patrick (Heath
Ledger); and, in place of Lucentio, we get the plain Cameron (Joseph
Gordon-Levitt).  And, well, that's about it.  In place of Shakespeare's
finely crafted comic plot, we get:
9. The Plot That Wouldn't Die.  You may remember it most recently from
She's All That, and from countless other films.  In short, Patrick is
dared (or in this case paid) to date the shrewish Kat.  Along the way,
the two fall in love...but eventually his terrible secret must come
out.  When it does, the couple is driven apart, only to realize their
true love for each other and come back together.  Fade to black.  Whew!
8. Whiplash Relationships.  10 Things I Hate About You must have decided
that one hot-and-cold relationship wasn't enough for a film.  So, in
addition to the maelstrom of Patrick and Kat, we have the sweet-and-sour
relationship of Kat and her sister Bianca (Larisa Oleynik).  Then
there's the affections of Cameron for Bianca that range from love to
indifference and back again.  Now, throw in another student, Joey
(Andrew Keegan), who has love and hate relationships with both Bianca
and Kat.  And we haven't even started to look at the secondary
characters!  You need a scorecard to keep track of who's hating whom at
every moment of the film.
7. Teen cliches.  Luckily, if you're completely confused by the ever
changing character allegiances, there's one thing you can count on:  the
omnipresent cliches.  10 Things I Hate About You doesn't just present
them and move on, no, it revels in every predictable detail.  From
absolutely cartoonish archetypical students, to the "standard" events in
any teen movie (including not only a wild party, but even the prom),
this film has them all.  It handles itself better than other recent teen
flicks, but not by much.
6. A Horrendous Lack of Pacing.  Have you ever seen a comic with
absolutely no sense of timing?  That's the same feeling you get when
watching this movie, which leaves a pregnant pause after every other
line of dialogue.  What little humor there is doesn't take that long to
digest, nor is it inclined to provoke plot obscuring bouts of laughter.
5. The Interaction Between Patrick and Kat.  The two characters have
perhaps the best dialogue exchanges in the movie.  However, it not only
pales in comparison to Shakespeare's original wordplay, but makes the
rest of the movie's dialogue look terrible in comparison.  Rather than
being sharp, cruel and biting, most of the screenplay's wit is rather
limp.
4. An Overwhelming Sense of Falseness.  Whether the film is trying to be
spontaneous, happy or sad, the film's scenes just don't quite ring true.
You're always aware that these are actors reading from a script; you
never get lost in the characters.  Nowhere is it more evident than in
the acting of...
3. Julia Stiles.  She's able to display emotions, but she never truly
expresses them (a fact that is particularly evident during one of her
final speeches). Stiles never seems to fit her part...whether she's
being shrewish or sweet, it all seems to be an act.  It further
distances us from the movie.
2. The Scarcity of Larry Miller, as the father of Kat and Bianca.  His
scenes provide the few genuine moments of humor present in the whole
movie. 10 Things I Hate About You certainly could have used more of him,
or at least more characters as entertaining as him.  The film tries to
spice things up with a romance novel-writing guidance counselor (Allison
Janney), and a hip-hop English teacher (Daryl "Chill" Mitchell)...but
fails, miserably.
And, the thing I hated most about 10 Things I Hate About You:  1. The
Fact That It Inspired Me To Write My Review In This Ridiculous Format.
Enough said.

Young Kat Stratford is Padua's resident evil ice queen.  Bianca
Stratford is her seemingly more down-to-earth younger sister.  Bianca
has caught the attention of Cameron, a gawky newcomer who endeavors to
court her the first time he sees her.  Cameron's quest for Bianca has
hit a snag: her father won't allow her to date.  With some prodding by
his daughter Bianca and her hopeful suitor, the patriarch of the
Stratford family slyly agrees to a deal knows he'll never have to
honor: Bianca can date when Kat dates.  Fearless, Cameron takes on the
challenge of making the apparently incorrigible Kat fall in love with
someone.
Sound familiar?  It should, because 10 Things I Hate About You, a
comedy from director Gil Junger, is a thinly-veiled adaptation/homage
to Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew.  This version of the story
takes place amongst hip teens at Padua High, a fictional public school
in Seattle.  Given the kitschy premise, it's surprising that 10 Things
manages to be a funny, endearing movie on par with Clueless or even
Fast Times at Ridgemont High.
The "shrew" in this retelling is played with infectious energy by
newcomer Julia Stiles.  As the angel-in-witch's-clothing Kat, Stiles
gets to be both wicked and gentle, slowly revealing the lovelorn
softie behind her character's rigid mask in fleeting, satisfying
emotive bursts.  The guy responsible for Kat's transformation is
Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger), the long-haired loner who has
reluctantly accepted money to date her.  Ledger seems a virtual clone
of Marky Mark Wahlberg, with a soft-voiced Aussie accent substituted
for Bostonian.  Oddly enough, Stiles and Ledger have a charming
on-screen chemistry, even when she's throwing up on his shoes.
Joseph Gordon-Levitt ("3rd Rock From the Sun") is pitiful -- in a good
way -- as Cameron, the transfer student whose simple plan to date the
lovely Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) backfires messily.  He's
unintimidating, his voice cracks just a little bit, and he looks like
he's never dated anyone his entire life (Try to picture Ryan Philippe
playing the same part and you get a hint of the wisdom of 10 Things'
casting directors).
The thematic elements of The Taming of the Shrew -- the social
conditioning of women, family politics, the gender battle of wills --
have been nicely updated for a modern audience.  This contrasts
starkly with 1996's William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet, whose
too-strict adherence to the text practicially negated the story's
relevance to the film's ultra-modern setting.  Junger and writers
Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith have made their characters and
story engaging enough that the original Elizabethan-era inspiration
seems more of a noteworthy suggestion than a direct influence.
Here is that once-in-a-blue-moon instance of a film whose fresh cast
is able to carry the film in spite of a totally predictable plotline.
Had a more recognizable, older crop of actors (read: Jennifer Love
Hewitt, James Van Der Beek, or anybody on the WB Network) been chosen
to fill the lead roles, this film's tried-and-true teen-movie cliches
and stock characters would probably be harder to stomach.
The actors not only look like real teens -- they talk and act like
them as well.  Though there are winking dialogue references to the
original source material sprinkled throughout, the script for the most
part shuns the "Dawson's Creek"-inspired trend of having young
characters talk like post-collegiate philosophers.  Let's hope that
Hollywood gets the drift that teens need not be portrayed by actors
who cop adult attitudes and radiate squeaky-clean winsomeness to be
appealing.

TEN THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU by DeWyNGaLe    Rating: C+

Lately, Shakespeare has been the subject of many movies, including the winner
of the Academy Award for the Best Picture of 1998, Shakespeare In Love. 
Throughout 1999, moviegoers will also be able to experience William
Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dreams and Hamlet.  Ten Things I Hate About
You is the adaption of the Shakespeare piece, "The Taming of The Shrew."  The
plot of Ten Things I Hate About You revolves around the Stratford sisters, two
students who attend Padua High that despise each other.  First, there is Bianca
Stratford, played by Larisa Oleynik, a popular, self centered person who
doesn't care about others.  Then, there is Bianca's sister named Kat, played by
Julia Stiles.  Kat is very disrespected at her school.  According to Bianca, at
one time Kat was popular, but because sick of the popularity.  Now, Kat is very
anti-social, mainly because she doesn't want to go with what everyone wants her
to do.
At Padua High, there is a new face around school.  His name is Cameron, played
by 3rd Rock From the Sun and Halloween H20's Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  His eye is
immediately caught by Bianca Stratford, and now he is desperate to win her
love.  Cameron is immediately facing a problem.  Joey, played by Andrew Keegan,
is a very popular jock at Padua High.  He also likes Bianca, so Cameron must
get to her first.  Now, Joey and Cameron are facing another problem.  Bianca is
not allowed to date because of the rule made by her father, played by Larry
Miller.  With the prom coming up, Bianca desperately wants to be able to date. 
Her father makes up a new rule.  If Kat dates, Bianca can date.  The rule
sounds extremely unfair to Bianca, considering Kat doesn't even want to date. 
Cameron and Joey must find someone to take out Kat, so Bianca can date. 
Patrick, played by Heath Ledger, seems to be the right one to take out Kat.  He
is bribed to take Kat out, and then the film goes into very predicable
sequences which I feel like I have watched over and over again.
TEN THINGS I LIKED ABOUT THIS MOVIE
1. Julia Stiles's wonderful acting performance.  Julia was very realistic and
believable as a teen.  She has a bright future.
2. Larisa Oleynik's performance as Bianca.  She was also very realistic as a
teenager.  Her character is much like many kids at my own school.
3. The way that it got its ideas from Shakespeare.
4. There are a number of funny sequences.
5. The soundtrack is fast and fun.  It adds to the feel of the movie.
6. Heath Ledger's character was a pretty likable, fun character.  
7. The way Bianca realized that she is selfish and she should be different than
that.
8. The way the parent doesn't like their children be wild and uncontrolled like
many movie parents do.
9. Larry Miller's performance as her father was an amusing role.
10. The title.
TEN THINGS I HATED ABOUT THIS MOVIE
1. The character of Joey, along with the performance by Andrew Keegan.
2. The character of Cameron, along with the performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt
3. The way it is predictable.
4. The way it tries to mix little kid comedy with teenager comedy.
5. The way it is so much like other teen comedies.
6. The character of Michael.  
7. Julia Stiles's character wasn't seen more.  She was a great character.
8. It is very similarly to She's All That.
9. The way it leaves so many untied knots.
10. The ending.
