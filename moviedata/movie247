It's been 27 years since The Exorcist forever changed the nation's
perception of pea soup.  The film, which was nominated for 10 Oscars,
including Best Picture, Best Director and three acting roles (it won for
sound and screenplay), allegedly caused some people to flee theatres in
a horrified panic.  But since its theatrical release in 1973, The
Exorcist has only been seen via badly edited TV versions and fading,
crusty old copies of the videotape.  The fact that the film spawned two
lousy sequels (one from The General's John Boorman, and one from The
Exorcist's author and screenwriter William Peter Blatty) didn't help
either.
Thanks to the wonders of modern technology, The Exorcist has been
restored with a cleaned-up picture, completely overhauled sound and
about a dozen additional minutes that didn't appear in the original
version (although some were on a recently released DVD).  But one
lingering question remains  will viewers today be as affected by the
film as they were back in 1973?
The answer is probably not.  The screening I attended was plagued with
mocking laughter and people leaving out of sheer boredom.  I should
mention that the screening was sponsored by a local `modern rock'
station, and most of the crowd was made up of young men and women that
have been weaned on a steady diet of slasher flicks that prominently
feature a grisly murder before the opening credits roll.
What these little douche bags don't understand is that you don't need a
high body count, gallons of fake blood and things making you jump every
five minutes to make a suspenseful film.  In fact, that's the alluring
part of The Exorcist.  Director William Friedkin (Rules of Engagement)
paces the film so slowly, the ending almost becomes a reward in
patience.
Just take the opening scene, where Friedkin takes a brief, five-page
epilogue from the book and audaciously transforms it into a 12-minute
segment that has little to do with the rest of the film.  In it, we are
introduced to Father Merrin (Max von Sydow, Snow Falling on Cedars) an
elderly priest on an archaeological dig in Northern Iraq.  He finds a
creepy idol (not unlike the one Greg had in The Brady Bunch's
multi-episode Hawaiian vacation) and begins to shake uncontrollably
while reaching for both the drink and his nitroglycerine pills.
Meanwhile, movie star Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn, Requiem For a Dream)
and her 12-year-old daughter Regan (Linda Blair) are temporarily living
in Georgetown while Chris shoots a film.  They rent a lovely home
(complete with a staff of three), but their lives are interrupted by a
demonic spirit that decides to take up residence in young Regan.
Thinking there is something physically wrong with her daughter, Chris
drags Regan to a bunch of clueless doctors that run a lot of pointless
tests before sending her off to a shrink.  It's really funny to watch
the doctors whip out cigarettes while they give cheesy explanations for
Regan's odd behavior (Ritalin is their treatment).  They blow smoke in
Chris' face while they blow smoke up her ass.
Looking for alternatives to medications and asylums, Chris turns to
Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller, Rudy), a Jesuit priest and
psychiatrist struggling with his faith after the death of his mother.
Damian's freaky nightmare montage of his dead mother emerging from the
subway entrance is one of the best ever.
Friedkin takes his time developing the characters, which makes the
ending that much more emotional for the viewer.  It's over 30 minutes
before anything makes you jump, 45 before anything remotely supernatural
occurs, and an hour has passed before the real hijinks start.  The
spooky events are spaced far apart and grow more disturbing as the film
progresses.  You begin to dread each time Chris runs up the stairs and
into Regan's room.
Purportedly based on true events, The Exorcist was adapted from Blatty's
best-selling 1971 novel.  The film's acting, especially from Blair and
first-timer Miller, are fantastic.  At that year's Academy Awards, the
14-year-old Blair lost to 10-year-old Tatum O'Neal (Paper Moon).  The
redone sound is marvelous.  You can even hear the aquarium in Regan's
room, which is kind of exciting because you can barely tell she has an
aquarium in the tape at your local video store.
2:15  R for adult language and violence

The Yards begins with a rebirth of sorts.  A subway train emerges from a
tunnel into daylight.  It is carrying Leo Handler (Mark Wahlberg) out of
the darkness and home, after spending time in prison.  He has taken the
rap for an auto theft circle, one including close buddy Willie (Joaquin
Phoenix), and is returning to a grateful homecoming.  But The Yards is a
dark crime drama, and Leo's future doesn't remain in the light for long
in James Gray's impressive, classically styled mini-saga.
Gray, recently appearing with The Yards at the Boston Film Festival,
based his tale of New York City subway vendor corruption on his own
father's experiences.  The filmmaker has given us a well-composed
script, deftly flowing through intertwining relations of families,
friends, enemies, and politicians.  He sustains a hopelessly dim design
throughout the film, even having the mind to steal wonderfully from a
few Godfather scenes (he claims by accident), and lifting Gordon Willis'
outstanding cinematography with his DP, Harris Savides (on purpose). 
Gray's direction gives us an overriding sense of doom that retains
suspense far beyond that of a second-time filmmaker (his first being
1994's grim Little Odessa).  But all that is nothing without Mark
Wahlberg.
The movie world is finally becoming convinced that Wahlberg can tackle
just about any role and carry an entire picture if need be.  Initially,
he had to sell himself to Gray, assuring him that having done jail time
himself, he "gets it" and could make Leo his own.
Instead of playing the streetwise punk that Gray may have first
envisioned, Wahlberg nails a more sympathetic Leo -- tough, proud,
loyal, uneducated -- all with a pinpoint conservation of emotion and
energy.  He walks through most of The Yards in a daze, not knowing how
to handle a larcenous offer but sliding into it anyway, slowly
contemplating his moves after one particularly disastrous jam.
When Wahlberg finally stages a fistfight with another actor, it has an
explosive feel, as if we've been tensing up for the entire movie right
along with him, staying quiet and pensive, and finally letting it out. 
Wahlberg knew well enough to keep the tone way down, and Gray was smart
enough to take advantage of it.
If Wahlberg is great casting, the company as a whole is inspired:  James
Caan as a crooked company boss (he finally gets to play the Don!), Ellen
Burstyn as Leo's ailing mother, Charlize Theron as Leo's cousin, Faye
Dunaway as Caan's well-to-do wife, the raw, talented Joaquin Phoenix as
the buddy, and the piece de resistance, crooner Steve Lawrence as the
Queens borough President.  (The first time Lawrence appears on screen,
Gray makes him look like a typical movie mobster, not only creating a
surprise in casting, but making a telling statement between crime and
politics.)  This cadre performs like a team.  They come together easily
to work the flow of cross-conversation and ad lib, and they make the
more structured scenes click like clockwork.
Moments of slick predictability aside, Gray uses that cast to create a
classic tragedy, taking eternal themes from some of history's great
storytelling.  While that always carries with it a sense of timelessness
and honor, Gray adds the kind of design and style that make The Yards
his own, and casts Mark Wahlberg in an increasingly more impressive
light.  Highly recommended.

THE YARDS, by director James Gray (LITTLE ODESSA), is a keenly observant 
film about a pair of two-bit hoods who accidentally get in way over 
their heads.  The charismatic but foolish criminals, Leo Handler and 
Willie Gutierrez, are played masterfully by Mark Wahlberg and Joaquin 
Phoenix.  Reminiscent of a gritty 1950s crime drama, the quiet film is a 
poignant character study of smoldering intensity that could easily have 
starred a young Marlon Brando and James Dean.
Just out of prison for stealing cars, Leo, with his soulful, downcast 
eyes, just wants to keep his nose clean.  The movie's central, tragic 
figure, Leo needs a job to help his poor and ailing mother (Ellen 
Burstyn).  Turning for help to a relative, Leo visits his uncle, Frank 
Olchin, who runs a large repair facility that specializes in fixing New 
York City transit trains and buses.  A corrupt businessman but caring 
family man, Frank is played in a sweetly nuanced performance by James 
Caan, last seen, impressively, as an aging crook in THE WAY OF THE GUN.
Frank wants Leo to learn a trade and become a union machinist, but Leo 
isn't willing to live off of hand-outs from Frank until he finishes his 
training.  Instead, Leo wants to "work with the suits" like his old 
buddy Willie does.  Willie, you see, specializes in greasing palms to 
land and keep lucrative city contracts for Frank.  Frank's wife (Faye 
Dunaway) likes this idea, as does his step-daughter (Charlize Theron), 
who is close to being engaged to Willie.
Besides dispensing graft, Willie is also in charge of a band of 
hooligans who destroy the competition's handiwork.  When Willie and Leo 
are on one of these search-and-destroy missions at "the (rail) yards" in 
Queens, things go badly awry, and someone dies.  This taxes Frank's 
legendary ability to control situations.  It may be something that even 
he can't cover up.
If the script, by James Gray and Matt Reeves, has a problem, it is that 
so much effort has gone into preparing three juicy roles for Leo, Willie 
and Frank that the other parts don't have much to do other than provide 
filler.  But that's a minor quibble for this simple story of great 
power.  The music, including "Saturn" from Gustav Holst's "The Planets," 
reinforces but doesn't overwhelm the solemnity of the drama.
The best part of the production is Harris Savides's warmly intimate 
cinematography that is lit with light that seems to come from small 
incandescent bulbs filtered through old, yellowed lamp shades.   Shot in 
shadows through door slits and frequently from a distance, he makes us 
observers of the action rather than participants.
The journey is the reward in this somber, cautionary tale.  Wahlberg's 
sympathetic portrayal of an unlucky loser is probably the best work that 
he has ever done.  But almost everything about the movie is an 
exception.  In an era in which Quentin Tarantino's influence means that 
films usually opt for maximum violence, THE YARDS has remarkably little, 
concentrating its energy, instead, on a perceptive examination of the 
characters, not the action.  
THE YARDS runs 1:55.  It is rated R for language, violence and a scene 
of sexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers.

"Code of Silence" or "Honor Among Thieves" -- not that these are very
exciting alternate titles, but then "The Yards" isn't hard to beat. Equally
humdrum, the opening act (first third) of the film which slowly introduces
the characters in the play.
Leo (Wahlberg) has just been released from prison and embraces his ailing
mother. Willy (Joaquin), his buddy, is close with cousin (Charlize) who's
stepfather Frank (Caan) runs a big train parts company that employs Willy
and offers Leo a job as well. Willy and Frank keep the money coming in by
"playing ball" with local officials and politicians. Soon Leo is in over his
head.
A full act is too long to wait for a compelling moment. I must say, the film
finally did "reel" me in mid-way through and held me near to the end with
some very absorbing developments and a character or two to root for, but
then traded those attentions for a cheap bit of melodrama. Ultimately, I
left the theater saying "so what?" Additionally, the church organ soundtrack
is somewhat disorienting.
This is obviously a product of a lot of talented people. The acting is
strong (I love this cast!), the characters rich, the direction mighty, even
some nice cinematography ... but where is the heart? A drama for the sake of
drama? Perhaps one who appreciates a Shakespearean plot more than myself may
find this family/power opera a bit more quenching.

   What a fine society we'd have if people were all community
minded.  Usually, though, each of us acts to benefit not only
himself but his immediate family and maybe best friends as
well.  Only after that do we look after the welfare of
the greater society.  This comes across as the subtext of
James Gray's taut, restrained, suspenseful drama of people
acting in a corrupt manner to allow their own cliques to
prosper at the expense of the greater society.  Filmed in New
York City, particularly in the boroughs of Queens and
Brooklyn, Gray's movie aptly demonstrates the backstabbing
and betrayals that we all know go on in local politics.  Thanks
to a fine cast of celebrated performers, the script written
by the director and Matt Reeves cleverly communicates this
pattern of duplicity by pointing out the cynical ways that
loyalties change in a moment.  Given the right circumstances,
your best friend can quickly become your assassin, your
oppressed group can shed its airs of martyrdom to demand
its own share of unscrupulously derived loot.
   As the tale unfolds, we discover that Leo Handler (Mark
Wahlberg) is the only good man in an extended company of
family, friends, and rivals in business. After unfortunately
taking a bum rap for stealing some cars, he serves part of his
term and, seeking a gig to please his parole officer, he
asks his uncle Frank Olchin (James Caan) for a job in a
company that builds and repairs subway cars for the city of
New York.  Devoted to his sick mother Val (Ellen Burstyn),
Leo does not have the patience to take a two-year training
program in school, so he hooks up with his best friend, Willie
Gutierrez (Joaquin Phoenix), who like Uncle Frank is
engaged in shady dealings involving payoffs to cops and
politicians.  Willie, like Frank, wants only to provide the good
things for the family he anticipates having with his gorgeous
girl friend Erica (Charlize Theron--here with black hair to give
her the appropriate ethnic look), and while he brings his pal
Leo into his disreputable arrangement, he will not hesitate to
sell the young man out if his own neck is on the line.
   James Gray, whose previous work, "Little Odessa,"
portrays a hitman who is disowned by his adulterous father
during a bleak Brooklyn winter, is in his element.  Gray is
adept at conveying the drama's melancholy atmosphere in
the way he partially lights the faces of his characters as they
act out their conspiracies in indoor locations and is equally
competent at imparting the sensuality of a samba-loving
nightclub known as Club Rio, the happy dancers bearing their
upraised arms as they swing and sway to the pulsating
rhythms of the night.  
   Part of the picture takes place in an actual  subway yard,
known to New Yorkers as a place so immense that fun-loving
teens are able to patrol the area at night affixing their favorite
graffiti to the sides of the cars.  The damage is greater in this
case, though, as groups of thugs hired by a company eager
to procure valuable city contracts go about the business of
vandalizing competing companies' work in order to discredit
them.
   Mark Wahlberg, whose sullen bearing anchors this
generally gripping movie, is wonderfully cast--a young man
who compared to those around him is almost a saint and who
eventually plays Serpico in the mean streets of one of New
York's outer boroughs.  The friendship between him and his
friend played by Phoenix is as palpable as the affection
portrayed between Phoenix and Theron.  Recall Phoenix's
striking role as Marcus Aurelius's backstabbing Commodus in
"The Gladiator" and you have an idea of how  this fine actor
can play the part of betrayer in his sleep.  Particularly striking
as well is Howard Shore's score, somber music which never
needs to be pumped up, as "The Yards" is anything but the
typical Hollywood slam-bam gangster melodrama that forever
captures the attention of a less discerning audience.
Rated R.  Running time: 115 minutes.  (C) 2000 by

Much has been made about this film and its well-rounded cast. Here you have
some of the older school's finer wines including James Caan, Ellen Burstyn
and Faye Dunaway, mixed in with some of the new generation's younger punks
including Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron and Joaquin Phoenix. A diverse cast
to say the least. Add writer/director James Gray to the top of the totem
pole, a man who waited six years after his directorial debut of LITTLE
ODESSA to create this film, and you've got an interesting melange of
cinematic experiences. Now let's see how this mixture tastes...
PLOT:
Having taken one for the team, Leo returns home after spending some time in
the pen, hopeful to return to the straight and narrow. Working for his
uncle, Leo gets trained by his buddy Willie, an expert in the dirty
political games prevalent in their industry. But it isn't long before one
such shady incident goes terribly awry and it's every man for himself. Of
course, Leo is once again left flailing in the wind of suspicion.
CRITIQUE:
This is a decent morality tale strapped to a very dark and depressing
setting, ultimately salvaged by many top-notch performances. A "gritty urban
drama" is probably the best way to describe this damp flick, a film that
certainly does present an interesting story, but does so in a manner that
just didn't grab me as much as I thought it would. There is very little
enthusiasm in this film, it's slow-paced, dreary and pretty gloomy for the
most part. In fact, the lead character played adequately by Mark Wahlberg
looks like he's going to kill himself in almost every other scene. He's down
and out. The film reminded me a lot of Scorsese's breakout 1973 picture MEAN
STREETS in many ways. Both pictures take place in the "mean streets" of New
York City. Both flicks seem to have an aversion to bright shots. And just as
in Scorsese's film, the so-called "dire" circumstances in this story
underwhelmed me for the most part. I mean, it just seemed like people were
making too much of things that didn't seem to necessitate all that hoopla.
Now don't get me wrong, the film does contain real moments of suspense,
characters caught in situations in which they have little way out.
But on the whole, I never really felt very close to any of the characters,
and telegraphed much of the film's grinding progression. But despite all
that, the performances were strong across the board, with Caan and Phoenix
grabbing most of the gusto. Burstyn and Dunaway were decent, but had very
little to do, while Theron took on yet another look and still managed to
punch in a solid performance. But it is Joaquin Phoenix who will likely be
the one most remembered for this film. Alternating between the many
different facets of his character, Joaquin danced the perfect line and will
hopefully be tagged with a nomination of some sort at the end of the year.
And despite the many similarities between this film and his directorial
debut, James Gray did manage to put an authentic representation of the times
on the screen, but not without overstylizing some of the film's more
poignant moments (appreciated by others, I found some of his tactics to be
distracting). So don't expect any major originality points with this film
but do expect to see some great actors doing their thing. And if you enjoy
dramas which focus on family, loyalty, redemption and all that fun stuff,
this film certainly packs much of that in its mix. Just don't expect to be
smacked upside the head by it all. Maybe just a gentle tap...
