Talk about bad timing - "O," which transplants Shakespeare's "Othello"
to a modern US high school, was scheduled for release two years ago. But
then some twisted boys in the real world went to school and shot their
classmates and teachers. Suddenly, a movie with a key scene depicting
armed students attacking one another didn't seem like such a great idea.
For awhile, it looked like "O" would never be screened. Then a smaller
studio took the troubled film, releasing it not in early summer but in
late August  just in time for the new school year. Hmmm.
In this version of the classic tragedy, Othello becomes Odin Jones
(Mekhi Phifer), star basketball player (and the sole black student) at a
private Southern school. O, as he is better known, has everything going
for him  he's a sure bet for the NBA, Coach Duke Goulding (Martin
Sheen, doing an operatic Bobby Knight impersonation) treats him like
royalty, and his girlfriend, Desi Brable (Julia Stiles) is charming and
beautiful.
Ah, but trouble is brewing. Coach Goulding's son Hugo (Josh Hartnett) is
jealous because dad likes O more than him. So the boy hatches a plan. He
will use insecure, horny Roger (Elden Hensen), naďve Emily (Rain
Phoenix), O's best friend Michael Cassio (Andrew Keegan) and his own
poison tongue to ruin his rival.
The melodrama works because high school is quite possibly the most
melodramatic place on Earth. When O takes in Hugo's lies, you
understand, because love makes a high school student susceptible to the
most outlandish ideas. As the Shakespeare play heads toward the horrific
ending we know so well, it seems plausible, given the emotional
fragility of the participants.
Still, this is a bumpy ride. The script makes liberal use of the word
"nigga" and tosses a few "faggots" in as well. I don't know about you,
but I could go a lifetime without ever hearing any variation of those
words again. And don't waste my time arguing about oppressed groups
reclaiming hate words for their own benign use  when one of those words
is voiced, regardless of the circumstances, some dim-bulb will assume
that means it's okay for them to use it as well.
The acting is spotty. Josh Hartnett, sporting that godawful bed-head
hairdo he favored before "Pearl Harbor," gives a performance consisting
almost solely of wincing and whining, while Julia Stiles seems overly
confined playing a character forced by the script to act illogically at
the worst times. Mekhi Phifer struggles a bit during the more grandiose
parts of his meltdown, but is credible overall.
Sadly, "O" is most convincing during its darkest moments  partially
because of the filmmakers effective use of the mossy Southern settings,
but mostly because it has now become far too easy to equate horror and
high school.

        Leave it to Hollywood to make a bold, challenging film for teens (and
adults) only to let it collect dust on a shelf as proposed release dates were
set, then scratched, many times over.  Such was the sad and unfair case with Tim
Blake Nelson's _O_, which original distributor Miramax seemed ready to consign
to direct-to-video oblivion after scuttling their final planned theatrical
release date in April 2001--three years after the film's production.  Luckily
for the film and audiences everywhere, Lions Gate came to the rescue of what is
by far the most successful modern-dress adaptation of a William Shakespeare
work--and the rare teen-targeted film to have something of real substance to
say.
        The "O" of the title is Odin James (Mekhi Phifer), the only black
student in a ritzy South Carolina prep school.  The star player of the
basketball team, Odin has the respect and love of his peers, not to mention the
team coach (Martin Sheen), who favors him over his own son, Hugo (Josh
Hartnett).  Bitter and jealous, Hugo sets out to destroy the too-trusting Odin
by planting seeds of doubt about his girlfriend Desi's (Julia Stiles) fidelity.
        Placing the Bard's _Othello_ in a modern high school context was a most
inspired idea on the part of director Nelson and screenwriter Brad Kaaya, for so
many elements in the original play so seamlessly translate to the charged
atmosphere and psychology of adolescence: the destructive rumors that are too
easily taken for truth (in a way, _O_ the cautionary tale last year's horrid
_Gossip_ wanted to be); the unspoken but ever-present prejudices; the selfish
pride; and--perhaps most crucially--the melodramatic tendency to blow petty
events and any resulting emotions into an out-of-proportion life-and-death
matter.  That last point in mind, the story's inevitable leap to violence is all
the more real--and hence more disturbing and deeply tragic.
        The emotional intimacy and intensity of the piece owes a huge debt to
the performers.  The charismatic Phifer is a perfect match for the charming and
(over)confident Odin; his natural likability makes his simmering jealousy and
rage that much more upsetting.  Before that happens, though, he forges a strong
rapport with the radiant Stiles; their early scenes have a genuine tenderness
that doesn't come off as sticky.  Delivering the breakthrough turn is Hartnett,
who wisely eschews the urge to overplay; his rather quiet, understated turn adds
to the menace of the character, not to mention it makes Odin's misguided but
unwavering faith in him easy to swallow.
        Nelson, however, deserves most of the credit for making a Shakespeare
play not only work but feel relevant in a contemporary context.  A part of that
success is definitely due to his and Kaaya's decision to not retain the
Shakespearean dialogue, which had such a distancing effect in Baz Luhrmann's
_Romeo_+_Juliet_ and Michael Almereyda's _Hamlet_.  It may not retain the Bard's
words, but _O_ works better than those films due to a fidelity of a different
kind: that to the spirit of original piece.  There's no blatant pandering to
youth (as in _R+J_'s quick-cut, MTV-ready eye candy) or contemporary audiences
in general (_Hamlet_'s aggressive push of modern settings and products, as in
the infamous Blockbuster Video-set "To be or not to be" scene).  _O_ is as
unflinchingly dark as its source material, and seeing the physically and
emotionally violent story play out--with little strain in believabilty--in the
here and now just makes it more unsettling.
        Miramax failed to see the big picture with _O_, zeroing in its violent
content without paying attention to context; as such, the film's release was
tabled countless times due to real-life instances of high school bloodshed. 
It's quite a sad statement on the movie industry that between '98 and now, a
number of youth-targeted films--be them of the horror, action, or even comedy
genres--that exploited violence as a means of stimulation have easily seen
release while a film that seriously deals with the issue and its aftereffects
has had to languish in limbo.  _O_ is the type of film that one should want to
release in the aftermath of a high school shooting: a film where the acts of
violence are shocking not because of graphic gore or sensationalism, but because
one can profoundly feel the lives being destroyed.

None of this is meant to say that O is a total waste of time.  At the
very least, it's a far better film than the obtuse 1995 version of
Othello, which starred Lawrence Fishburne and strayed far from the
original tale but still relied on cryptic Elizabethan-era English.  O is
far more faithful to the original story than I would have suspected,
even handling those tricky asides and character-hiding-in-a-closet
scenes with aplomb.  Ultimately, the source material keeps O mostly
afloat, telling a unique and tragic story about how a single,
well-placed rumor can ruin the life of somebody who otherwise has it
made.
Mired in the "marketing violent movies to teens is bad" controversy of
1999-2000, O has been sitting on the shelf for a while, building a large
volume of clips that claim it's the most violent thing since Natural
Born Killers.  A word to audiences -- this is far from the truth.  In
fact, those expecting a Columbine-style rampage (a ridiculous link which
I've nonetheless found in 538 articles on Nexis.com) will be
disappointed by the relatively tame ending -- comprising four gunshots
and a quiet strangling.

Pretty boy Josh Hartnett, last seen unimpressively in PEARL HARBOR, delivers an
even more underwhelming performance in Tim Blake Nelson's O.  First-time
screenwriter Brad Kaaya's script for O is very loosely based on Shakespeare's
Othello.  Set to a hip-hop beat and cast with a bunch of young actors too old to
be in high school, the story takes place on and off the basketball court as a
high school team tries to win the state championship.  
Mekhi Phifer (I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER) plays the team's star, Odin
James, and Hartnett is the team's very jealous, utility player, Hugo Goulding. 
As soon as Odin wins the MVP award from Coach Duke Goulding (Martin Sheen),
Hugo's dad, Hugo starts plotting to take Odin down.  To fill out the
teen-friendly cast, Julia Stiles (10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU), who seems to
specialize in loose Shakespeare adaptations, plays Odin's girlfriend, Desi
Brable.  
Nelson has all of his actors speaking in whispers.  This risky technique can
work, as it did spectacularly in THE DEEP END, but with actors more interested
in posing than working, the effect is sleep inducing.  Sheen, to his credit,
does chew up the scenery in a hopeless attempt to wake up the sleepy
production.
The very preppy, southern school -- both sexes are required to wear blazers and
ties -- has only one black, Odin, a kid of fairly average height who appears NBA
bound.  Having one lone black allows the screenwriter to throw in a bunch of
clichéd racial lines.  ("White girls are snakes," Hugo warns Odin about Desi. 
And later, Odin reminds everyone, "My mom ain't no crack head.")
Although it contains one of the most unconvincingly staged murders in recent
memory, the last act does breathe some needed life into an otherwise s-l-o-w
movie.  
O runs 1:35.  It is rated R for violence, a scene of strong sexuality, language
and drug use and would be acceptable for most teenagers.
The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, August 31, 2001.  In
the Silicon Valley, it will be playing at the AMC and the Century theaters.

O (1999). 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Mekhi Phifer, Josh Hartnett, Julia
Stiles, Martin Sheen, Andrew Keegan, Rain Phoenix, Elden Henson and John Heard.
Written by Brad Kaaya. Directed by Tim Blake Nelson. Rated R. Running time: 91
minutes. 
 A welcome cinematic trend over the past couple of years has been to make the
works of Shakespeare more accessible to the younger audiences who are the vast
majority of moviegoers by contemporizing the Bard and altering the settings to
familiar surroundings. 
 A prime example of this is 1999's 10 Things I Hate About You, which was
basically The Taming of the Shrew in a high school. 
 Less successful was last year's adaptation of Hamlet with Ethan Hawke as the
heir apparent of the Denmark Corp. Here the setting was the corporate world of
New York. 
 Now comes O, a faithful retelling of one of the most tragic of Shakespeare's
tragedies. 
 Like 10 Things I Hate About You, the stage is a high school - a private prep
school where Odin James (Mekhi Phifer) is the on-court general, the basketball
team's standout player. 
 Julia Stiles, featured in 10 Things I Hate About You as well as performing
Ophelia in Hawke's Hamlet, plays Desi Brable, Odin's girlfriend, whose father
also happens to be dean of the institution. 
 Josh Hartnett (Pearl Harbor) is on hand for the villainy, playing the scheming
Hugo, who sets the tragic wheels in motion. 
 O was actually filmed a couple of years ago, but was shelved because of the
Columbine High School tragedy. 
 The movie, directed by Tim Blake Nelson - best known for his co-starring role
in O Brother, Where Art Thou? - and written by Brad Kaaya, is very grim. An air
of tragedy weighs it down from the opening scene to the closing credits. And
that is how it should be. 
 Of all of Shakespeare's tragedies, Othello is the most harrowing, not because
of any body count, but because of the psychological havoc wreaked by Iago, whose
motivation in the sheer pleasure of his treachery. 
 Kaaya's profane-filled script - after all, these are high school kids - does
offer Hugo a subtle motive of sorts. The young man considers himself the
basketball team's prime utility man who does a little bit of everything - pass,
shoot, rebound - but is constantly in the shadow of Odin. 
 Plus his father, the team's coach - played with a ferocious intensity by Martin
Sheen - showers more love and concern on his star player than on his own flesh
and blood. 
 The script follows the familiar lines of the classic. Hugo begins dropping
hints to Odin concerning Desi's fidelity, eroding the star's confidence in those
he considers closest to him, affecting both his relationships and his game. 
 It all ends in blood, of course, which is why the movie was originally shelved.
 The performances in O vary. Phifer is at first cocky and self-assured, emotions
he handles with ease. He also does quite well displaying Odin's darker side; his
defensive sensitivity about being the only black at the institution, his growing
distrust of those he loved, his rage and the erosion of his belief system. 
 Hartnett is appropriately cool and Machiavellian as he weaves his deadly web of
lies and deceit, turning friend against friend, and lover against lover. 
 Stiles seems a bit stilted, but occasionally also rises to the occasion, moving
from adoration to confusion to fear of her young knight. 
 The film does contain a few missteps: A subplot involving Hugo's theft of the
school mascot is left hanging. 
 Also Desi's actions concerning Michael (Andrew Keegan), Odin's former teammate
and best friend who was kicked off the team because of one of Hugo's
machinations, is puzzling. Why she would continually be seen with Michael -
however innocent the circumstances - when she knows her man suspects the two of
cheating behind his back. It is irrational. 
 But these are minor carpings. Overall, O is a stylish and faithful adaptation.
 If nothing else, it may encourage some people to read the original text, and
that will counterbalance the severity of this feature.

"All my life, I've always wanted to fly."
Starring Josh Hartnett, Mekhi Phifer, Julia Stiles,
Andrew Keegan, Elden Henson, Martin Sheen. Directed by
Tim Blake Nelson. Rated R.
Shakespeare has been subjected to numerous so-called
"adaptations" in recent years. They usually go
something like this: a screenwriter takes the
storyline from one of the Bard's plays, sticks it in a
modern setting, fills it with teenybobber stars, and
finds some way for it to be set in a high school. 10
Things I Hate About You skewered The Taming of the
Shrew and Get Over It tinkered with A Midsummer
Night's Dream for its own nefarious ends. O, directed
by Tim Blake Nelson, was actually filmed before both
of these, but was delayed after the Columbine
shootings made Miramax apprehensive about releasing an
Othello with teenagers. All the hubbub is misleading:
the violence that punctuates the film isn't graphic or
gratuitous, and the movie doesn't exploit
Shakespeare's play but demonstrates its startling
relevance.
Othello is now Odin (Mekhi Phifer), the star
basketball player of a rich, secluded prep school
(also the only black kid in said school), where the
students have apartments and friendship can quickly
turn into politics. He is given a prestigious award by
the riled-up coach (Martin Sheen), and promptly shares
it with his friend, colleague, and co-star, Michael
(Cassio; Andrew Keegan). This casts a long shadow on
second-rate player Hugo (a pre-Pearl Harbor Josh
Hartnett), who is jealous that the coach - his father
- showers attention on Odin and Michael while he is
left wholly out of the spotlight.
So Hugo - playing the part of Iago, of course - sets
out to ruin Odin and get rid of Michael in the
process. He enlists Roger (a.k.a. Roderigo), a
bullied, insecure young man, to make it look like
Odin's girlfriend Desi (Desdemona; Julia Stiles) is
fooling around with Michael on the side. What follows
is known to everyone who has read the play: trappings,
misunderstandings and sinister plots eventually drive
O very nearly insane, culminating in a climax of
characteristic Shakespearean violence.
O has the conviction to stick very close to Othello's
original story in the face of inevitable objections to
the way it plays when brought into present day. I can
envision this happening; if not in a high school, then
definitely at a university, where athletic competition
reaches an absurd level. Remarkably, I can't remember
any moments that seemed glaringly phony; if the
business about the handkerchief seemed a bit trivial,
it was kind of silly in Shakespeare's setting as well.
Nor does the film wimp out at the end; the stabbings
turn into shootings, and the strangling takes place as
you would expect. The build-up to the climax is so
strong, that even though we expect the murders, the
sudden turn to violence is still jarring. The ending
provides no closure or comfort; no pat justification
for what took place to settle everything nicely in the
viewer's mind. Like in the best films, and the best
plays, we are forced to figure it out for ourselves.
Or maybe there's nothing to figure out. An
undercurrent in the film seems to be that this is the
natural course of human events, slightly exaggerated:
competition creates jealousy, jealousy escalates and
turns into malice, which becomes violence. It's a
chilling sentiment, but a daring one.
Josh Hartnett is especially strong in a film filled
with good performances; he needs to take more edgy
projects like this and less autopilot blockbusters
like Pearl Harbor. I also liked Elden Henson as Roger,
a role that carries real emotional weight and
emphasizes sides of the character that were ignored or
subdued in Othello. Director Tim Blake Nelson, himself
an actor (you may remember him as one of George
Clooney's dimwitted companions in O Brother, Where Art
Thou?), knew how to handle his youthful cast, though
Julia Stiles looked somewhat uncomfortable.
O is about teens but, like Ghost World, it is not a
"teen movie." It is a powerful film, and a real one,
making the case that even without the Olde English,
Shakespeare's plots don't go stale.

PLOT:
Odin is a great high school basketball player. He's dating a hot girl and the
coach loves his ass. In fact, the coach even admits to having fatherly feelings
towards him. Unfortunately, the coach's real son, Hugo, isn't too pleased to
hear that. In fact, he doesn't like hearing about any of Odin's triumphs, as
they generally supersede his own. So what does he set out to do? Well, let's
just say that he starts to mess with people's heads and one thing leads to
another thing which leads to...well, you'll see.
CRITIQUE:
A very powerful, thoroughly depressing, well-acted "non-teen" movie starring a
bunch of teens. Credit director Tim Blake Nelson for creating a modern day
version of this Shakespearian classic, set in a realistic high school
environment, with the basketball championships as the backdrop and an impending
sense of doom as it core. You also have to give it up to all of the actors in
this film, who turn over some very convincing performances, taking you through
all of their characters' ups and downs. Hartnett especially should be applauded
for taking on such a despicable character, a dude who you just want to grab by
the throat and beat the shit out of (sign of a good actor, if you ask me).
Phifer also comes to play in this movie, with a nice blend of charisma, fear,
love and anger spread over his character. I was always on this guy's side and
definitely felt sorry for him as things moved along. Julia Stiles was also good,
but her character wasn't much different from others that she's played recently.
I was however very surprised with Martin Sheen's showing, since I hadn't taken
him too seriously as an actor over the past few years. His character is
definitely over-the-top in this film, but I appreciated his fervor, his rage,
his ultimate and blind desire to win above all. A great example of a workaholic
man who cannot see the trees from the forest.
I did have a few reservations about the movie though. First of all, what was
with all of the gangsta hip-hop music used in pretty much every other scene
transition? It was cute at first, but became a little too obvious and annoying
after a few times. The film was also edited pretty choppily...like some scenes
were cut out and no one "cleaned it up" afterwards. I also didn't like the fact
that Hartnett's character, the man behind much of the nastiness that goes down
in this film, was infallible. In other words, pretty much everything he says or
asks of someone, happens automatically and without any goofups. I mean, I know
the guy is smart and all, but I would have appreciated a little more "realism"
under some of the circumstances. But overall, the movie will devastate you. It's
not a "fun date movie". It's not a movie about the high school basketball team
and how its black star falls for the white girl from the other side of the
tracks. It's about jealousy, love, envy, fury, passion, revenge and pretty much
any other negative thought that's ever passed through your head. Is it worth
seeing? Oh, most definitely! (pun intended) It's a moving picture with great
performances, no Shakespearian speak (thank you, God!) and an outstanding
directorial job by Nelson. The final scene alone is enough to send a massive
chill down your spine, and I was especially impressed with the director's choice
of music near the end. In fact, the whole sequence was quite reminiscent of the
final showdown scene from TAXI DRIVER, and I guess that's saying something right
there.

The title is enough to strike fear into the hearts of the testosterone-laden
around the world.  But don't worry - O isn't Oprah's big move from making
crappy books into crappy films (that's already happened with Where the Heart
Is).  It's a modernization of Shakespeare's Othello set at a Charleston,
South Carolina prep school, and despite the heavy baggage it lugs into
theatres, O is a pretty decent flick.
That baggage, in case you've been living under a rock, is the film's violent
content and target audience, which caused the original distributor to push
back targeted release dates for two years before dumping it off onto a
smaller, gutsier company.  You're probably thinking O is one violent
sumbitch, but it isn't - the film simply had the misfortune of being
scheduled for release around the same time as Colombine, and since it's
about high school students and murder, and stars actors popular with the
under-17 crowd, people got freaked out.
Unlike Baz Luhrmann's updating of Romeo + Juliet, this film doesn't keep the
Bard's dialogue intact, which will be welcome to some and considered a
tragedy to others.  The action takes place at Palmetto Groves, a private
school home to a successful basketball program run by Coach Duke Goulding
(Martin Sheen, Apocalypse Now Redux), which means the Duke of Venice's court
has been transformed into a basketball court.  The Hawks are headed to the
state tournament, thanks to the prowess of senior Odin James (Mekhi Phifer,
Shaft).
The film begins at a pep rally for the team in which Coach Duke presents
Odin the team MVP award after emotionally confessing that he loves his
high-scoring threat like a son.  Not the kind of thing you want to hear when
you're the Coach's real son, like Hugo (Josh Hartnett, Pearl Harbor).  To
make matters worse, when Odin is handed the trophy, he calls down sophomore
Michael Cassio (Andrew Keegan, 10 Things I Hate About You) to accept the
award with him.  Why, it's almost enough to set somebody off on a murderous
rampage, isn't it?
Most of the elements of Shakespeare's play are here, including Odin's
girlfriend, Desi (Julia Stiles, Save the Last Dance), who also happens to be
the daughter of Palmetto Grove's Dean, who is named Brable instead of
Brabantio (John Heard, Pollock).  Hugo has a pawn in Roger (Elden Henson,
The Mighty), and Desi's friend Emily (Rain Phoenix) gets wise to the whole
thing before anybody else.  The only thing surprising here, at least when it
comes to the story, is that Hugo and Desi share very few scenes together,
and it's never clear whether he wants her for his own or not (it sure
doesn't seem like he does).  O isn't as heavy on the race stuff as I had
expected, either, even though Odin is a real fly in the buttermilk as the
only black student at Palmetto Grove.
Hartnett really shines as the oft-overlooked Hugo, who is one of the most
likable, admirable antagonists to hit the screen in a while.  As he plants
both evidence and seeds of doubt in anyone he pleases, you have to wonder
how he'd fare as a contestant on Survivor or Big Brother.
O was directed by Tim Blake Nelson, who is probably best known as Delmar
from O Brother, Where Art Thou? (you know, the Soggy Bottom Boy who wasn't
George Clooney or John Turturro).  The script was written by debut scribe
Brad Kaaya, who does a good job at changing the setting of the play and
incorporating a handful of Shakespeare's original lines, as well.
1:35 - R for violence, a scene of strong sexuality, language and drug use
