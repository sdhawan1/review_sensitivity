Misrepresenting the content of a film is an unpardonable mistake in my
book of movie viewing. In this instance the crime is in reference to the
movie capsule on the jacket of a video. The error in this case, is so
obvious, that whoever wrote it, obviously did not watch the film. It
states that five prisoners on death row have been placed in the latest
state of the art penitentiary; they must survive against a group of
terrorists who have taken over the complex. In actual fact, the
death-row-in-mates are merely petty thieves, political extremists,
fraudulent, a rapist and a cop wrongly convicted of a crime. The most
annoying fact is that the highly publicised MAXIMUM SECURITY prison, is
merely an empty block of offices. The security tower has multi-access
from open corridors, making this the most insecure prison I have ever
seen. Amusingly, the erotic sex scenes are also very badly timed ie A
cop (Paul Michael Robinson) and female reporter  (Landon Hall) are
trying to escape the prison, with terrorists hot in their pursuit. A
nuclear bomb is about to explode on timer, a rapist stands guard outside
the kitchen, whilst the two Â‘heroes' spend a good ten minutes of the
viewer's time making salami in the kitchen!
Since the success of TERMINATOR in 1982, there has been a-dime-a-dozen
release of similar clones hitting the video shelf. Usually, they entail
the presence of an indestructible machine/monster +\- the elements of
time travel and changing futures. None to memory have been comparable.
TIME UNDER FIRE, is such a movie. A submarine travelling through the
Bermuda Triangle? Suddenly hits a time\water continuum and are
conveniently transported into the future. The future is bleak and
hostile place, and mankind is suffering under the evil totalitarian rule
of a mad man. Sound familiar? So the mission is to basically get back to
the past, murder the man responsible for the catastrophe and set the
future right. The outstanding elements of this film was not how
unoriginal it was, but how the blood on the dead men looked like spilt
paint, and how the machine gun fire rattled unprofessionally like
firecrackers.
