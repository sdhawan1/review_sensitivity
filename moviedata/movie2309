     Indie horror is always a hit-and-miss affair, but true splatter
fans will find a lot to like in Dante Tomaselli's Desecration, a truly
bizarre tale of a boy (Danny Lopes) who accidentally kills a nun and
then suffers the otherworldly consequences.
     As cinematic oddities go, Desecration ranks right up there with
Eraserhead, rarely making much sense but creeping you out every chance
it gets.  Made on a $150,000 budget, the film has a lot of big-budget
flourishes made possible by clever camerawork and odd lighting coupled
with good sound effects.  Does it work as a story?  No, but it is
genuinely creepy and would probably work better as atmosphere for your
Halloween party, what with its demonic nuns and clown-men, than anything
else.
     In many ways, Desecration reminded me of the original Phantasm,
long on cheese but leaving you scared to death -- of all things -- of a
metal ball.  You'll never look at nuns the same way again.
     The DVD also includes an excerpt from the original short film of
Desecration, which, if it's possible, is even weirder than the feature.
