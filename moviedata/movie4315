Synopsis: Lifelong friends Rafe (Affleck) and Danny (Hartnett) join the US 
Air Force and are stationed at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Rafe goes to England 
to fight alongside British pilots and is seemingly killed in action. Danny 
falls in love with Rafe's girlfriend, Evelyn (Beckinsale), but Rafe 
survives and returns to confront his former friend. Meanwhile, the 
Japanese sneak attack is imminent...
Review: "Pearl Harbor" is a perfect example of movies as product rather 
than as art. It is little more than a crassly-calculated attempt to woo 
the masses, enticing them with big stars, big effects, and a big setting 
-- but no heart. It is difficult to criticise the actors, because they do 
everything the movie demands of them. Sadly, this amounts to barely more 
than reciting dialogue of such sheer banality that it makes one eager to 
see the script Randall Wallace wrote with his right hand at the same time 
as he was writing "Pearl Harbor" with his left. The plot here is pure 
cliche, and the wartime setting simply a convenient backdrop. There is no 
genuine exploration of what Pearl Harbor meant to the United States, and 
no insight into its vital role in inciting that country to join World War 
II. Instead, there is just an assembly-line love triangle, some empty 
patriotic rhetoric, and a laughable attempt to placate Japanese viewers 
via the inclusion of some reticent Imperial commanders (when one intones, 
"I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant", I nearly fell out 
of my seat). To the movie's credit, it does include a fantastic portrayal 
of the attack itself, an exciting and dizzying hour which plunges viewers 
into the war. If only the remaining two hours had been crafted with such 
skill, perhaps this Memorial Day non-event would have been worth watching.

"Pearl Harbor." We have been hearing about this event film for over a year
and finally, like a plague of locusts, it has descended on theaters
everywhere. Director Michael Bay has parleyed his estimated $135 million
budget into a 3-hour tome that, I have to say, I could have done without.
Don't get me wrong. I knew that the draw for "Pearl Harbor" would be the
much-discussed special F/X and computer graphics used to depict the
Japanese sneak attack on the slumbering battleship fleet of the US Navy
stationed at the Pearl. I expected that Bay and "Braveheart" scripter
Randall Wallace would shoot for an old-fashioned romantic yarn to wrap
around the action that we're there to see. They do this but, unfortunately,
the tale we get is bland and insipid, with little dimension given to the
players in what amounts to a romantic triangle with a backdrop of war.
I'll get to the kick-ass F/X in a minute, but I really want to complain
about the story and its inherent silliness. I knew things were going to be
cliched and little more when, early in the film, fighter pilot Rafe
McCaully (Ben Affleck) gives his beau, Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale), an origami
bird to remember him by. My immediate thought was, "An origami bird? That's
stupid!" It turned out to be the kick off gesture of the contrived yarn
that is to come.
The huge cast is lost in the turmoil of the telling of the story as the
setup is made for the pending attack while the individual stories of the
stars unfold. Cocky Rafe, on the verge of love and war in the Pacific,
takes an offer by the British to join the American Eagle squadron to do
battle with the Nazis in Europe. He becomes missing-in-action and his best
friend, Danny (Josh Hartnet), must break the bad news to Evelyn. Danny
can't help being smitten with the beautiful Evelyn, but propriety and the
memory of Rafe keeps him from acting hasty. As the months pass, the two
can't help but fall in love. Then, Rafe miraculously appears on the scene
and the triangular romantic angst surfaces. The lack of life given to the
characters keeps this core story from ever getting off the ground.
If you are patient, though, and don't mind spending your movie-going
dollars on the 35-minute long extravaganza of the attack on Pearl, you will
have a visual treat, at least for a little while. From the moment that the
Japanese lead pilot signals "tora, tora, tora," you are in for some of the
most action packed, violent eye-candy we have seen since the opening of
"Saving Private Ryan." As a matter of fact, there is more than passing
borrowing from that Spielberg film, James Cameron's "Titanic," "From Here
to Eternity" and a myriad of Hollywood war movies from the 40's and 50's.
Too bad Bay garners the most mediocre of these contributing elements.
Historical accuracy has never been high on the list of things-to-do for
Hollywood filmmakers and that tradition continues with "Pearl Harbor."
History mavens will be, gleefully, all over this movie like ugly on an ape.
Details like the paint jobs on the Japanese Zeroes, the types of ships
anchored in the harbor, the kinds of uniforms and more will be scrutinized,
closely. Erroneous details like the presence of Admiral Yamamoto aboard the
attacking carriers or President Roosevelt rising out of his wheelchair
unassisted will make some cringe. But, it's about what I expect from the
man that brought us "Armageddon." Oh, yeah. I almost forgot that it's not
just about the attack on Pearl. Once that is over, the makers tack on an
extended sequence depicting Jimmy Doolittle's daring raid on Japan, a la
Mervyn LeRoy's "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo." With a few more bucks added to
the budget, Bay could have added the Korean War, too.
Special F/X and a bunch of money do not make a good movie. There has to be
a story, a believable one at least, to attach everything to and that does
not happen here. "Pearl Harbor" bombs and I give it a C+.

"Pearl Harbor"  Ambitious Plans, Fair Results
If "Pearl Harbor" were released at any other time
during the year, this film would at best be considered
a thin offering that's often more banal than moving. 
It's oversimplified perspective on history and it's
underdeveloped cast of characters never adequately
portrayed the stark realities of war, the strains of
rivalry, the importance of camaraderie, the glory of
love, or the necessity of sacrifice.  
But it's the summertime and we crave special
effects-laden movies.  Thus with a theme that mixes
war, love, and glory and the multitude of impressive
dogfights and battle sequences, there's plenty to keep
people seated through the 3-hour film.  Seated yes,
riveted no. 
After watching this film with my best friend (Daniel
Scher) and my roommate (Ming Shih), I was intrigued to
learn that we all came away with similar reasons to
applaud the movie and similar reservations as well. 
This is interesting to note because Daniel prefers
dramas, Ming favors love stories, and I like anything
that gives me an excuse to sip soda.  So, no matter
what you look for in a film, you will probably note
these observations as well.
Of distinction was the ambitiousness of this project
and its epic feel, which seemed to pull ideas from
films like "Titanic," "Saving Private Ryan," and "Top
Gun."  The central story of love and friendship is
told against the backdrop of WWII.  Our likeable
patriotic flyboys, Rafe and Danny (Ben Affleck and
Josh Hartnett), battle each other for the love of
dedicated nurse Evelyn (Kate Beckinsdale).  The
stability of their friendship, however, may be as
fragile as chances for peace with Japan in late 1941. 
With its high production values, the film ably evoked
America's image as a society of 'weaklings and
playboys,' the frenzied atmosphere of trying to
ascertain Japanese fleet movement, and the imminent
danger that lied ahead.  Most stirring were the
moments leading up to the fateful sneak attack as
dozens of Japanese squadrons flew toward their
military targets unnoticed by American listening
posts.  FDR's (Jon Voight) emotional appeals for
action were also moving.  And the film incorporated
black and white camerawork to give the imagery an
added sense of realism.
However, our chief reservation was that its tone was
noticeably indecisive, flirting between an epic love
story and war film.  The story about friendship and
sacrifice could have stood on its own without the
clutter of war.  But with the haze of combat, it
became unclear what happened to many of the
interesting secondary characters.  Most shameful,
though, was the weak segment on Dorie Miller (Cuba
Gooding Jr.), a real-life cook who manned a gun during
the Pearl Harbor attack to defend his ship, and who
was the first colored man to receive the Navy Cross.  
Actually, the whole Pearl Harbor sequence did nothing
to advance the story and at the very least, seemed out
of place.  It does not succeed in establishing any
tone or groundwork for some future occurrence.  This
could have been spliced out and made into its own IMAX
feature.  Meanwhile, much of the other war aspects was
heavily sanitized to gain a mass audience-accessible
rating of PG-13.  As such, this component lacked soul.
At times, the movie achieved some majestic and
poignant highs.  At other times, the syrupy Harlequinn
Romance dialogue and music brought it to embarrassing
lows. For several of you, this may be a time that
tries mens' souls.  But the overall effort is
certainly worth a matinee ticket and a bucket of
popcorn.

PLOT:
Two best friends turned fighter pilots are put right into the action in 
1941, as WWII is swelling up and casualties are mounting. It isn't long 
before the Japanese conduct their surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, the 
American base in Hawaii, and the two boys are once again, put into the 
middle of things. Oh yeah, they've also both fallen for the same girl in 
the meantime...sheesh!
CRITIQUE:
The first hour of this movie was so-so. The second hour of this movie 
kicked some mighty ass. The third hour of this movie was so-so, with a 
weak ending. So, overall? Well, I'd say that this is an average flick 
that doesn't need to be seen in the theatres unless you really wanna 
check out all of its awesome visuals on the big screen. Otherwise, wait 
for video so that you could fast-forward through all of its boring "love 
triangle" shite. I guess I'm kinda half and half on this movie. Granted, 
the attack sequences were freakin' amazing! They lasted long, they 
delivered excitement, pain, frenzy and everything else you'd expect from 
a film trying to convey some of what went down in Pearl Harbor back in 
1941. But does that all that cool stuff make for a complete movie? Of 
course not...especially not a film which asks that you remain seated for 
three hours. That's usually up to its characters. So did the leads in 
this movie draw me into their plight, engage me as I expected to be 
engaged, make me cry when they cried, laugh when they laughed...well, 
you get the picture. Unfortunately, the answer to all of those questions 
is a resounding "no"! I didn't care for any of the main characters in 
this movie and I certainly wasn't interested in their phony-baloney 
three-way romance thingamajig.
I figure...the movie is called "Pearl Harbor", not "Love in the Skies". 
Of course, I wouldn't be making such a big thing about this whole 
romance aspect, if they had just made it a "small" part of the bigger 
picture (or if it had worked!), but sadly, it basically IS the picture! 
(unlike ENEMY AT THE GATES, which managed to slip in a little romance, 
but not without affecting the war movie aspect as a whole). In this 
movie, it basically just felt like the whole "war thing" was happening 
in the background, while this great ol' romance took center stage. But 
the chemistry just wasn't there, the emotions just weren't there and to 
be honest with you...it just felt tacked on! Like the filmmakers knew 
that they wanted to tell the story of Pearl Harbor, but believed 
audiences to be uninterested in such a film unless told through the eyes 
of some goofy romance. I don't know. Either that or they figured that 
their box-office grosses would be greater with a "love" thing happening, 
but whatever the case, it just didn't gel for me.
Which is why I don't blame the actors, who were just doing their jobs, 
but what can they do when the script that they're studying is missing 
one main ingredient...humanity! I remember weeping like a child when I 
watched TITANIC because I had actually started to give a shite about its 
characters. This movie amazed me with its visuals but pretty much bored 
me with its human interactions. Next time, how about taking some of that 
money from your gigantic budget and hiring some writers who can develop 
some real emotional attachment to their characters? But enough about 
that. Actor-wise, I was actually quite impressed with two thespians in 
particular, one being the almost unrecognizable Jon Voight as President 
Roosevelt, and the other, Alec Baldwin, who delivers across the board as 
the tough as nails Colonel James Dolittle (GLENGARRY anyone?). The 
directing and authenticity of the period were also quite impressive, 
especially during the war scenes, although I didn't particularly care 
for the "blurry vision" style utilized by Bay during the hospital 
scenes. It just frustrated me. And surprisingly, much like TITANIC, this 
film didn't really feel like three hours to me, although it did tend to 
slow down (or maybe that was just my disinterest) during its so-called 
"emotional" moments.
So is it an entertaining movie overall? No, not overall. Some of it does 
definitely entertain, but most of it just makes you wanna slap the 
filmmakers for ruining a good war flick with an overlong, sappy and 
uninspiring "romance" angle. Oh well, now let's see how much money it's 
gonna make...
Where's JoBlo coming from?

I recall a short 1995 film by director Arthur Penn made in conjunction with the one-hundred-year anniversary of the Lumiere films. The film focused on a group of Japanese children running through a playground as the camera tracks them and we hear explosions in the soundtrack. The area they played in was a Hiroshima bombing site. The film was a meaningful, poetic way of conveying the message that war can destroy dreams, especially those of innocent Japanese children. Not that I expected Michael Bay's souped-up, more-bang-for-your-buck extravaganza to capture such poetry but it could have at least tried. "Pearl Harbor" is "Armageddon" for people who love revisionist, dumbed-down history for the sake of some special-effects. Considering that "Harbor" and "Armageddon" come from Bay, I should have known better than to expect a serious treatise on one of the more tragic events in American history. 
The bulk of "Pearl Harbor" is a tired, cliche-ridden - not let's rethink that. The bulk of the film is a bland, superfluous romance suffused with enough syrupy music and dull melodrama to make women swoon for all the wrong reasons. Ben Affleck is Rafe McCawley, the flyboy pilot whose aspirations outweigh his romantic charisma. He falls for a nurse (Kate Beckinsale) after being injected with hypodermic needles in his arse. They fall in love too quickly even for standard screen time, and it is no wonder since neither has much inner life or interest beyond blind love. Rafe's childhood buddy, Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett), is also an ambitious pilot. He falls for the nurse exactly three months after Rafe has been premused dead from being shot in the skies by enemy fire. I am sure you'll know what to expect next. I would have thought that a soap-opera plot like this would have died eons ago. Honestly, why would such a simplistic love story interest anyone now in this millenium? 
About one hour and a half later, the film gets to the Pearl Harbor tragedy where over 2,500 people died after being bombed by Japanese fighter planes. The whole frenetic sequence lasts forty minutes. Then we segue back to the love story itself before we get a climax where the U.S. bombs Tokyo in retaliation (the inspiration for the novel and film of the same name, "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"). In the meantime, the Japanese commandants are briefly shown to be dubious of their attack strategy, only to be shown as inhuman villains for the sake of some forced heroic chutzpah from the Americans in Tokyo. 
The two attack scenes are full of razzle-dazzle effects and plenty of explosions but something feels off in the execution. The attitude is all wrong and that should come as no surprise for those who enjoyed the popcorn mentality of "Armageddon" (I was among the minority). Director Bay enjoys visual overkill and he loves Dolby-ized explosions but all at the expense of human involvement or human tragedy. He does not present it as a post-"Saving Private Ryan" reality where we feel the loss of innocent lives by unforeseeable forces. Instead, it is an exciting sequence but almost too exciting - the thrill is sickening knowing how many people actually suffered and died (especially those trapped inside the "Arizona" ship). We may as well be watching "Rambo" rather than a serious World War II film.
 If the attack scenes were omitted, we would be left with two hours of an interminable, sappy romance that lacks passion and chemistry. Ben Affleck can't cut it as a romantic leading man. Josh Hartnett is simply fodder for Affleck so he can have at least one bar fight and a final reconciliation that smacks of pure sentimental hogwash. Kate Beckinsale comes off unscathed but compare her thankless role to her work in "Last Days of Disco," and you may be left wondering what a potentially exciting actress is doing in a movie like this. 
With Affleck as a witless flyboy, Jon Voight as former president F.D.R. who seems ready to have a stroke, Alec Baldwin as the pontificating Col. Dolittle and Beckinsale as the love object of the two pilots, not to mention a characterless tragedy portrayed as the latest in flag-waving American propaganda, "Pearl Harbor" manages to sink history down the drain and everyone involved with it. 
Note: I have the feeling that nowadays, people can't handle or admit to certain truths. They rather have their history toned from an R rating so it is more acceptable to the masses, thus causing the least amount of controversy possible. It is disheartening to know that people will see this movie to see the Pearl Harbor fireworks sequence, forgetting that it should be upsetting to watch, not exhilarating.

Telling a love story amidst a tragic, historical backdrop isn't a new 
conceit. In 1998, James Cameron's "Titanic" captured the attention of 
audiences everywhere to make it not only the highest-grossing film in 
history, but also the Oscar winner for Best Picture. "Titanic" was clearly 
the most notable model for director Michael Bay (1998's "Armageddon") and 
screenwriter Randall Wallace (1995's "Braveheart") when they set out to make 
the $135-million, 3-hour-plus "Pearl Harbor." Unfortunately, all of its 
striking similarities only serve to expose "Pearl Harbor" for what it really 
is: a pale imitation of a brilliant, modern-day classic.
Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) are top-notch 
bomber pilots, circa 1941, who have been best friends since their 
Tennessee-based childhood. Their life is changed with an encounter with 
beautiful nurse Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale). Rafe is clearly smitten, 
and after a glorious four weeks together, they are hopelessly in love. Soon, 
Rafe is gone to Great Britain to participate in combat, only to end up 
presumed dead after his plane is shot down. Turning to each other for 
comfort, Danny and Evelyn, now stationed at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, begin 
their own romance, not yet knowing that Rafe is alive, after all. By the time 
Rafe walks back into their lives, causing turmoil in each of their respective 
relationships, December 7, 1941--"a date that will live in infamy"--is about 
to begin.
The thought of Michael "bang-bang-blow-things-up" Bay attempting a 
serious-minded, historical motion picture was disconcerting, at first. Bay, 
whose strong suit is most definitely not realism and three-dimensional 
characters, is acclaimed for making "popcorn" movies with quick edits and 
non-stop action, not a historical recreation of one of the most distressing 
occurrences in U.S. history. "Pearl Harbor" could have been a filmed disaster 
of a real-life disaster. It could have been an embarrassment for all of the 
creative forces involved in its production. And, most of all, it could have 
stood as a terrible, Hollywoodized disservice to a slice of American history. 
It turns out that it is, thankfully, none of these things, although it does 
have its own problems.
The movie can easily be divided into three sections, with each offering up 
varying degrees of success. The opening 90 minutes lay out the development 
and basic groundwork for the three central characters--Rafe, Danny, and 
Evelyn--as their unfortunate love triangle falls into place. The disastrous 
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor takes up the next 35-40 minutes of screen 
time, as we follow each character's heroic role in the battle. And the 
remaining 50 minutes bring us back to settle the love story, as the aftermath 
of the Pearl Harbor attack is dealt with and General Dolittle (Alec Baldwin) 
puts into effect the 1942 raid on Tokyo.
The tragic, powerful love story of "Titanic" was so very effective because it 
dealt with characters who were deeply involved in the sinking of the cruise 
liner, and whose relationship and lives were changed because of it. Jack and 
Rose, played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, stood for all of the 
passengers aboard the fateful maiden voyage of Titanic, and therefore, they 
meant a great deal more to the viewer. In "Pearl Harbor," the love triangle 
that arises does not garner the same potency, due to the flawed screenplay, 
and the fact that the outcome of the relationship has literally nothing to do 
with what happened at Pearl Harbor. The romance simply is not very 
convincing, and occasionally clangs with the real-life accounts of the months 
leading up to World War II.
In the world that writer Randall Wallace inhabits, human beings say things 
like, "Every time I see a sunset, I'll think of you," and "You've captured my 
heart." The dialogue is intermittently so cringe-inducing that you feel bad 
for the actors who have to utter those howlers, followed by a period of time 
in which you question why they didn't laugh at Wallace and tell him to 
rewrite it to match what real people might naturally say. Whenever one of the 
protagonists says such cheeseball lines, which luckily isn't so often that it 
completely destroys the movie's dignity, it sends the whole romance angle 
into jarring orbit.
More strong is the friendship between Rafe and Danny, whose bond ultimately 
can't be broken by the conflict of a woman in the middle. As portrayed by Ben 
Affleck (2000's "Bounce") and Josh Hartnett (2001's "Town & Country"), the 
outcome of their relationship is far more poignant and compelling than that 
of them and Evelyn, because the platonic love that they share for one another 
is so honestly felt. 
All three main performers should be commended for taking what could have been 
stock roles, and turning them into seemingly real people, even when they are 
saying silly lines. Affleck's Rafe is a little too smarmy at the onset, but 
the view of him gradually warms up as the film progresses, and Affleck does 
well with his cocky charm. Josh Hartnett is even better as good-ol'-boy 
Danny, whose quiet, unforced innocence is unmistakably engaging. Rounding out 
the trio, Kate Beckinsale (1999's "Brokedown Palace") brings an intelligent 
sweetness to Evelyn that could be superior to both of her male counterparts. 
It is too bad, then, that her part of the story--that of the love 
story--works the least successfully.
In supporting roles, James King (2001's "Blow") and William Lee Scott (2000's 
"Gone in Sixty Seconds") are very good as a fellow nurse and fighter who fall 
head over heels for one another, with ill-fated results. Jon Voight (1999's 
"Varsity Blues") is emphatic as wheelchair-bound President Franklin 
Roosevelt, while Alec Baldwin (2000's "State and Main"), Dan Aykroyd (2000's 
"Loser"), and Mako (1997's "Seven Years in Tibet") make equally memorable 
impressions. On the flip side, Cuba Gooding Jr. (2000's "Men of Honor"), 
whose role of a real-life cook on one of the U.S. ships at Pearl Harbor who 
shot down two Japanese fighter jets, is superfluous and far too brief to make 
a notable impact. Gooding Jr. is a fine actor, but his appearance simply pads 
out the running time an extra ten minutes.
The centerpiece of "Pearl Harbor" is, of course, the Japanese invasion, and 
it does not disappoint. Suspenseful and frighteningly real, this is the one 
section in which director Bay made the correct choice in not hamming the 
proceedings up. With stark photography, tight editing, and magnificently 
rendered visual effects by Industrial Light & Magic, this middle interlude is 
certainly the highlight for sheer entertainment value. Incidentally, though, 
it is the only section in need of more palpable emotions. Ships are blown up 
and countless lives are lost, but viewer reaction to this is oddly mote, 
perhaps because of how fast it moves from one scene to the next.
"Pearl Harbor" is a difficult movie to review. It is in no way a great movie, 
but it also is far from bad. There is a lot to recommend, from the 
performances, to the two war sequences, to a climactic scene that is simply 
heartbreaking, but there are also a fair share of detractors. The film 
presses on for just over three hours with no clear destination or purpose, 
and the supposed-to-be cathartic final scenes are hampered by a needless, 
misguided narration that seems to cheapen the realities of World War II. 
Nonetheless, the calamitous events that occurred on December 7, 1941 are 
boldly brought to cinematic life, and it demands to be seen. "Titanic," it 
surely is not, but "Pearl Harbor" has enough finer points to pass as a good 
film that could have been better.

As part of the pre-release hype for "Pearl Harbor," World War II vets
attended screenings of the film and then voiced their reactions to the
press. To no surprise, they were enthralled by the production. One
soldier expressed his decades-old fear that the memory of Pearl Harbor
would fade from the public consciousness. He was no longer concerned,
though, for this epic film was a guarantee that he and his comrades
would never be forgotten. Watching the parade of aged veterans before
the cameras was stirring  stirring enough to make it seem vaguely
unpatriotic to criticize such a noble endeavor.
If "Pearl Harbor" bolsters the legacy of those men and women, that's
wonderful, but it should not obscure the fact that the three-hour saga
isn't a very good movie. Intended to tap into the lucrative "Titanic"
audience, "Pearl Harbor" is two-thirds cheesy love story and one-third
fireworks extravaganza. Imagine a vintage Grade B WW II romance with
state of the art special effects, edited by someone with attention
deficient disorder, and you'll have an idea of what to expect.
The tale follows Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) as the
best-friends-since-childhood become pilots in the U.S. Army Air Corps.
Rafe falls in love with Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale), a dedicated nurse,
shortly before volunteering to travel to England and fight in the Battle
of Britain. Shot down by enemy aircraft, he is mistakenly reported as
dead. After a mourning period, Danny and Evelyn become a couple.
Of course, Rafe reappears in their life, leading to exactly what you
would expect. The high drama between the three is interrupted when the
Japanese launch their staggering assault on Pearl Harbor. Later, both
men must leave Evelyn, this time to take part in a daring retaliatory
raid. Let into command headquarters by a sympathetic officer, the
terrified nurse listens to air reports of the attack that might rob her
of the two most important men in her life.
Comparisons between "Pearl Harbor" and "Titanic" don't hold up. The love
story in "Titanic" worked because the young man and woman served as
representatives for all the souls onboard the disaster-bound ship. They
were the embodiment of the hopes and dreams that were cut short when the
massive boat went under. The romantic triangle between Rafe, Danny and
Evelyn lacks that resonance. These characters are cut from the pages of
a cheap paperback. When Evelyn describes the first time she met Rafe,
her girlfriends listen raptly, giggling too hard at just the right
moments because they are supporting players and that is their job. When
Rafe and Danny race to try and stem the initial Japanese assault, each
man's survival is assured because an old-time hero cannot die unless he
is making a noble sacrifice in the final reel.
The battle scenes are just what you would expect from Michael Bay, the
director of "Armageddon". The film jumps like lightning from one action
image to the next, with jiggling cameras attempting to create a sense of
verisimilitude as planes whoosh by in breathtaking fashion and
weapons-fire explodes all around. Every few seconds, the screen fills
with carefully composed panoramas of the devastation being wrought from
above. The big money shot follows a Japanese bomb as it drops from the
plane and plummets into a United States ship, resulting in a massive
explosion.
It's an extremely cool visual, which is precisely the problem. In a film
that is supposed to be honoring the men and women of Pearl Harbor,
should we be oohing and aahing as we watch them die? The battle scenes
in "Saving Private Ryan" put us right in the middle of the nightmare of
combat. "Pearl Harbor" is a throwback to the war-as-spectacle school of
filmmaking and, at least for me, that is no longer viable.
Incidentally, Bay's tendency to whoosh is not confined to the battles.
Even during the gentle moments, his cameras repeatedly glide alongside,
below and above the actors. The crane operators for this movie must have
made a fortune. Bay doesn't know when to lighten up, and neither does
the bullying orchestral score, which attempts to force emotions up the
audience ear. On the positive side, while the idyllic vistas in the
early scenes are too perfect to be believed, they are nonetheless quite
lovely, using the color palate well.
Within this cavalcade of overkill are a group of talented actors. When a
British officer asks Rafe if all Yanks are "so anxious to die," the
airman replies, "Not anxious to die, sir, anxious to matter." That Ben
Affleck is able to keep a straight face while delivering that hack line
is a tribute to his skill. As Danny, Josh Hartnett hits the right notes
and Kate Beckinsale is quite striking as Evelyn. Other cast members play
characters based on real people. In a crucial supporting role, Jon
Voight is flat-out amazing as FDR, totally disappearing into the persona
of the commander-in-chief. Alec Baldwin breathes life to aviation legend
Jimmy Doolittle, despite being saddled with a nonstop barrage of lines
straight from Cliché Central. Allotted criminally short screen time is
Cuba Gooding Jr., who gives a restrained performance as Doris "Dorie"
Miller, the first black soldier to be honored in WW II.
Even though it rips off a slew of other movies and tries to turn war
into a thrill ride, "Pearl Harbor" deserves credit for honoring the work
of nurses and, albeit briefly, servicemen of color, in addition to white
male veterans. It also deserves credit for treating the Japanese fairly
and for showing, if only for a split second, the bigotry aimed at
Asian-Americans. "Pearl Harbor" is not an awful movie. It is simply
another example of what happens when a film is made by technicians
instead of artists.

The son of a Tennessee crop duster, Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) taught
his best friend Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett, "The Virgin Suicides") how
to fly and even protected Danny from his abusive, WWI vet dad (William
Fichtner).  Years later, Rafe is tapped to fly with the British Eagle Squadron 
while Danny is shipped off to Hawaii as is Rafe's girlfriend, Evelyn (Kate 
Beckinsale, "The Last Days of Disco"), an Army nurse.  The threesome's paths 
will all cross again, though, on the date that will live in infamy, the 
Japanese attack on "Pearl Harbor."
Director Michael Bay, known for the pyrotechnics of "The Rock" and
"Armageddon," attempts to take the James Cameron route of mixing a love
story with disaster.  While he delivers a magnificent, thirty-five minute
special effects knockout, Randall Wallace's ("Braveheart") script
only gives us one minor character worth caring about.
The film's first half gives us the Spielbergian Tennessee boyhood that segues
to New York to establish the adult love story.  In a pitiful 'meet
cute' moment, Rafe appeals to Evelyn to pass him on the eye exam (he's
dyslexic before there was a word for it) and she does, but also keeps him in
his place with a couple of hard, nasty needle jabs (all the nurses are 
presented as pinup sadists).  True love inexplicably ensues, but when Rafe 
volunteers for combat duty in England, he nobly decides not to consummate the 
relationship and hands over care of Evelyn to Danny.
Rafe's shot down (and we never for a minute believe he's dead) and shy Danny
delivers the news to distraught Evelyn.  Gradually, they connect as a couple
and do consummate their relationship in a parachute hanger scene that 
looks like a fashion shoot.  When does Rafe return?  Why, on December 6th, of
course!  The attack on Pearl Harbor is reduced to a means for Rafe and Danny
to repair their relationship.
Wallace's script offers a few true moments.  When Rafe strides onto the
English air field and asks for an immediate assignment, he's given a shot
up plane with a blood spattered cockpit, fresh from battle.  Red (Ewen
Bremner, "Trainspotting"), a pilot with a severe stutter, becomes bait for
the ladies of WWII and attached to Betty (James King, "Blow"), a sweet,
seventeen year old runaway-turned-nurse.  The Japanese are portrayed 
sympathetically with Admiral Yamamoto (Mako) making his famous anti-war 
statement and Zero pilots surrounded by family photos.  (Disney's decision to 
edit the film for Japan and Germany is a politically correct front
for corporate greed.)
Yet, Wallace's attempt to include the story of Dorie Miller (Cuba Gooding Jr.),
the cook who became the first African American to be awarded the Silver Star, 
feels tacked on.  Worse yet, the idea that one man (Rafe) would be in the Eagle
Squadron, be one of two pilots that get airborne during the Pearl Harbor 
attack to shoot down six Japanese Zeroes, and then survive Doolittle's (Alec 
Baldwin) raid, is suspension of intelligence, not belief.  The resolution of 
the romantic triangle is never in doubt (you can practically see the death's 
head looming over one of the three stars).  
During the attack sequence, one of Bay's initial shots is straight out of 
Spielberg's "Emperor of the Sun," as young boys playing on a cliff are startled
by Japanese planes flying by.  We see men in the water being strafed "Saving 
Private Ryan" style (Bay throws in an American flag for good measure) and men 
sliding down the deck of the U.S.S. Arizona just like their unfortunate
counterparts in "Titanic."  Rafe and Danny even execute the canyon flying 
stunts of "Star Wars."  Throw in some John Williams' music from "Midway" and 
we've got Bay as Spielucasron.  The overall effect can't be denied, yet only 
one death has emotional resonance.
Ben Affleck looks the part of the WWII hero, all square-jawed determination,
but there's no depth to the character.  His is an artificial nobility.  He's
at his most believable responding to the pain of shooting himself in the eye
with a champagne cork.  His 'I'm not anxious to die, I'm anxious to matter'
line rings hollow.  Kate Beckinsale, in the film's most underwritten role, 
is, not surprisingly, the most shallow of the three leads, a pretty face who 
seemingly responds to whichever pretty face is placed in front of her. 
Hartnett is the most believable of the three leads as a shy, quiet guy dealing
with extraordinary circumstances.  
Cuba Gooding Jr. is as good as his largely symbolic role allows and Alec
Baldwin makes for a loyalty-inspiring Doolittle.  The best acting comes in
some of the smaller roles.  Colm Feore as Admiral Kimmel looks commanding
and projects frustration at the lack of intelligence he has to work with.  
Jon Voight makes for a dogged and empathetic F.D.R.  James King is touching 
as naive nurse Betty.
In the end, "Pearl Harbor" is a bloated epic that features a U.S. wartime 
disaster as a special effects extravaganza.

 PEARL HARBOR (2001) 2 stars out of 4. Starring Ben Affleck, John
Hartnett, Kate Beckinsale, Cuba Gooding Jr., Alec Baldwin, Jon Voight
and Mako. Music by Hans Zimmer. Screenplay by Randall Wallace. Produced
by Jerry Bruckheimer. Directed by Michael Bay. Rated PG-13.
 Hollywood has this unfathomable necessity to transform any monumental
historical event into a backdrop for a trite and clichéd love story.
 Thus it was with Titanic, and so it is with Pearl Harbor.
 And while the film isnít a total dud, it is ó considering the script is
by Braveheart writer Randall Wallace ó a disappointment.
 The characters are by-the-numbers archetypes, the dialogue at times is
purple prose and the situations are very predictable.
 Only the special effects offer this three-hour elephant any saving
grace.
 The story revolves around two fighter pilots ó Rafe  McCawley (Ben
Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett). They have been friends for
life, almost like brothers.
 So, of course, a woman, Nurse Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale), is who
comes between them.
 Actually, Kate originally falls for Rafe, but when she and Danny
believe Rafe is killed flying for the RAF, they turn to each other for
consolation.
 But then on the eve of the Pearl Harbor attack, Rafe returns from the
dead.
 And before he, Danny and Evelyn can resolve things, the Japanese are
impolite enough to ruin a perfectly good Sunday morning by staging their
surprise attack.
 The raid, which comes about 90 minutes into the film, finally relieves
the doldrums that have been building since the opening scenes.
 The pyrotechnics, computer-generated images and stunt work are first
rate. Yet, it also is oddly impersonal. The sailors and soldiers who are
killed and wounded are merely props. We hardly learn about any of them.
 The performances by Affleck and Hartnett are stalwart. However, neither
is challenged dramatically. Both merely are called upon to look
resolved, brave, sad or determined.
 The same can be said of Beckinsale, who has the added burden of
maintaining an American accent. But she has lovely teeth, which she
flashes frequently.
 Pearl Harbor is a pretty movie. The opening scenes between Rafe and
Evelyn have that 1940s camera look to them, containing several extreme
close-ups.
 For a movie supposedly built around an event that transformed the
United States from an isolationist nation into a world leader, it treats
that occurrence like an intrusion.
 The day after the attack, when Evelyn goes to visit Rafe, who has been
ordered stateside along with Danny, she winds up telling him, ěAnd then
all this happened.î
 The movie seems to trivialize the attack, which is insulting to the men
and women who made the ultimate sacrifice in Hawaii.
 Pearl Harbor, at three hours, tries to cover a wide audience spectrum ó
romance for the women and action-adventure for the men. And in that
aspect it succeeds. Yet the two components never really mesh.
 The movie is also a politically correct outing. The Japanese are
portrayed as reluctant warriors who launch the attack because they see
the United States as a threat to their empire.
 You can almost hear the filmmakers, director Michael Bay and producer
Jerry Bruckheimer, apologize for allowing World War II to intrude on
their love story.
 There is nothing that can be written to dissuade anyone from seeing
Pearl Harbor. Itís the big summer blockbuster, so people are expected to
go see it.
 Pearl Harbor is an uneven venture, an overblown balloon of a movie.
Considering the subject matter, it fails to inspire.
 Enjoy the explosions and the aerobatics. That is mostly all this movie
has to offer.

Harvey S. Karten
   Of the many wars and military interventions to which the
United States has been a party, only one was not declared or
pursued by America before this country was attacked by a
hostile power.  World War II was the lone conflict forcing
America's hand: abruptly, dramatically, devastatingly. What is
the relevance of this historic detail?  Simply that because the
territorial lands and waters of the United States were hit while
the U.S. was at peace, few Americans of fighting age rushed
to graduate school or to parenthood to escape the draft and,
in fact, the morning after the Pearl Harbor attack found
thousands of young people lined up outside their military
recruitment centers itching to sign up and fight to restore their
country's honor.  Here was a clear-cut moral war against the
forces of fascism, a struggle to inspire a rebirth of nationalism
after a long passive stance of listless isolationism.  Here was
a conflict made for the movies, and thanks to the advanced
special effects people from Industrial Light and Magic who
furnish some awfully dramatic explosions together with
patriotic action sequences and a screenplay that does not
treat the Japanese as boorish caricatures, "Pearl Harbor" is
not a picture you'd want to skip.  Nonetheless the film is
seriously flawed.
   Through this $135 million presentation, producer Jerry
Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay attempt to equal or
outdo major war pictures like "The Bridge on the River Kwai,"
"The Longest Day," and "Saving Private Ryan" as a proud
and entertaining testament to the men and women who kept
our nation and its allies free from the totalitarian grip of a 
relentless adversary.
   I suppose some hearts will beat rapidly at both the soapy
romance that emerges at strategic times during the action and
even leap up while watching the feel-good ending that
features the courageous Jimmy Doolittle's daring, almost
suicidal bombing attack directly on Tokyo just months after
the Pearl Harbor debacle.  Despite Bob Badami's attempt to
browbeat us with banal music which in a few instances all but
drowns out the soapy dialogue, one could not be blamed for
feeling proud to be an American--cheering on the Doolittle
raid while suffering trepidation at the appalling damage done
by wave after wave of Japanese "zeros" during an attack of
an hour or so that left over 3,000 people dead on the island
of Oahu. At two hours and fifty minutes not including the
thirteen minutes of credits that thankfully appear only at the
end, however, the overlong film should depress anyone who
has seen Steven Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan" as
unfortunately second-rate in its battle sequences.  The
millions who will compare the amorous activities on the
screen with those present in James Cameron's "Titanic" might
not be blamed for thinking that something this time around
has been plagiarized from a Harlequin romance.
   Since Bay and Bruckheimer may realize that they've
already got the lovers of guns and glory sold well in advance
of the opening day, they've opted to spend the greater part of
the film's time on the eternal, romantic triangle:  the courtship
of Nurse Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale) by airmen Rafe
McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett). 
The film's opening in 1923 positions Rafe and Danny as best
buddies in rural Tennessee. In one scene that points out their
desire to fly, they play around in a crop-dusting plane,
surprised by the aircraft's sudden liftoff, which lasts about as
long as the Wright Brothers' first flight but probably scares
them quite a bit more.  They join the United States Army Air
Corps at which time Rafe, volunteering for an extra
immunization shot in the butt from the strikingly pretty,
girl-next-door Nurse Evelyn, falls in love, yet volunteers to join
a British company some months before the attack on Pearl
Harbor.  He goes down with his plane and is presumed dead. 
Evelyn teams up with Danny--signalling the audience that
trouble is about to brew between the best buddies that will
tear them up even more than the war experiences to follow.
   Director Michael Bay ("The Rock," "Armageddon") teams up
for the fourth Bruckheimer production determined to give the
huge expected audience what he's sure it wants the most:
sappy and sentimental love juxtaposed with the best that
state-of-the-art special effects can supply.  While the
protracted attack on the U.S. fleet at Pearl Harbor might invite
comparisons to the opening half hour of "Saving Private
Ryan," the latter had one large advantage.  Since the landing
in France in 1944 was a surprise move engineered by the
U.S., viewers could focus on Tom Hanks's character
throughout the harrowing battle scene as he directs his squad
of seven men in the invasion.  By keeping his camera close to
the ground pointing up at the men, photographer Janusz
Kaminski gave us an unsurpassed view of what it must be like
to be in the hell of a firestorm.  By contrast, since the 1941
attack in "Pearl Harbor" was engineered by the Japanese--
who are shown in the planning as rational commanders who
even cancel the plan for a third wave because the surprise
would be lost--John Schwartzman's lensing shows mostly a
prolonged period of confusion, unable to focus on one man in
the manner that Tom Hanks was used in "Ryan."
   Some of the visuals are quite good, of course, as you'd
expect from a film costing as much as this one (but still 65
million less than "Titanic"), my favorite being a closeup of a
torpedo dropped from a Japanese fighter plane that brought
me back to the final scene in Stanley Kubrick's far more
imaginative "Dr. Strangelove," in which a crazed right-wing
American fighter rides an atomic bomb from his plane right
down to its target.  
   Between the furious action and the romance, there is some
strong, even humorous accompanying action with strong
imagery.  In one, Dorie Miller (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) pummels a
fighter in the boxing ring while implicitly pointing out the
discrimination that blacks faced during that war.  Wanting
nothing more than to man a gun, he is relegated to the
kitchen as one of his ship's cooks.  As Col. James H.
Doolittle, Alec Baldwin serves to inspire his men to go on a
suicide mission designed to raise the morale of the America
people after the disaster of Pearl Harbor.  On the Japanese
side, Mako turns in a strong performance as Admiral Isoroku
Yamamoto, who directs the attack on Pearl Harbor together
with Commander Minoru Genda (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa),
planning the campaign for several weeks in advance while
incredibly managing to keep the Americans clueless about his
mission and flaying about in an attempt to guess where the
Japanese would inevitably strike.
   Jon Voight inhabits the role of the wheelchair-bound
President F.D. Roosevelt splendidly, showing genuine
emotion at the losses suffered at Pearl Harbor, and recreating
the opening to his dramatic address to the U.S. Congress one
day after the Pearl Harbor attack.  Josh Hartnett and Ben
Affleck are fine as best buddies who have a serious falling out
over a woman, with the lovely British actress Kate Beckinsale,
hair makeup always in place even while racing about the
hospital in search of morphine or getting it on inside a
parachute with Josh Hartnett, is a perfect icon for the
excellent work done by women who administer to the
wounded and even fall themselves in the heat of battle.  
   Fine performances aside--bogged down by Randall
Wallace's mushy and hackneyed dialogue, drowned out by
Bob Badami's bullying beat, and intimidated by Mr. Kaminski's
ever-soaring and descending camera, "Pearl Harbor" ends a
victim of the sort of over-production that motivates producers
and directors who believe that a mass audience must be
afflicted with attention-deficit disorder.
Rated PG-13.  Running time: 183 minutes.  (C)2001,

The more I think about Pearl Harbor, the more it pisses me off.  It seemed
enjoyable enough while I was watching it, but afterwards, the flaws began to
bubble up through the calculated, jingoistic schlock.  It's a day later and
I'm liking it even less.  Oh, and just so you know, I'm talking about the
film - not the actual events of December 7, 1941.  A lot of you people out
there are too dumb to tell the difference, which accounted for a number of
messages condemning me to a painful death for not feeling enough sympathy
for the men who lost their lives on the Andrea Gail.  I didn't like The
Perfect Storm, but a bad review of that film doesn't mean I'm glad the ship'
s crew are fishing with Jesus now.  Ditto for Harbor.  What follows is a
critique of the film - not history.
Plenty of films use music and imagery to coerce you into feeling emotions
that you may not particularly want to feel, but Harbor takes the
manipulation cake.  On the surface, it appears to be a simple combination of
action and romance, so, a la Titanic, there's something for John and for
Mary.  That's not so bad, but dig a bit deeper and you'll find Harbor to be
a shameless, cunning monster that has carefully checked and double-checked
every important demographic of every potential moviegoer. African-Americans
like films?  Let's add a completely meaningless subplot about a black Navy
cook.  Hillbillies spend money at the theatre nowadays?  Let's give a
Southern accent to both male leads.
That's not so bad either, and it's been done before, so it's easy to
overlook.  But when you consider the parallel between Harbor's revisionist
history and the Japanese box office gross of Titanic, things become a little
more sickening.  James Cameron's film took in over $200 million in Japan, so
Harbor's producers (Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer) had to carefully find a
way to make the antagonist Japanese characters into a likeable bunch that
had no choice but to wipe out most of the U.S. Navy.  They practically made
it seem like the bombing of Pearl Harbor was our fault, just to guarantee a
decent take at the Japanese box office.  Think that's bad?  Variety has
reported that Disney will send special cuts of the film to Germany and Japan
with toned down references to "dirty Japs" and other defamatory slang (like
nobody was hurling slurs like these in the '40s). Now that's artistic
integrity!
On to the story now, and you don't really need a recap if you've seen
Titanic (some scenes were even shot in the same giant water tank).  Harbor
takes about 90 minutes to set up the love triangle between nurse Evelyn
Johnson (Kate Beckinsale, Brokedown Palace) and hayseed pilots Rafe McCawley
(Ben Affleck, Bounce) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett, Here on Earth).  Then
something tragic happens (iceberg/bombing) that is both a special effects
extravaganza and approximately 40 minutes long.  And then somebody dies.
Because Harbor is set during a pivotal moment in World War II, it will draw
unfavorable comparisons to Saving Private Ryan, although its PG-13 rating
doesn't allow the violence to become too gruesome (after all, scaring away
the kids means less cash in the coffers, and this is definitely all about
the money).  Unlike the claustrophobic Ryan, which allowed the viewer to
track a particular group of soldiers during the invasion of Normandy, Harbor
's scope is much grander.  That's not to say it's bad (there's something
about seeing American soldiers caught so off guard that they've got
toothbrushes in their mouths as they watch the Japanese Zeroes spray
everything with bombs and bullets), but it's definitely not as personal and,
as a result, lacks the emotional oomph of even a typical episode of Buffy
the Vampire Slayer.  Is it impressive?  You bet.  Would I see it again?
Only if I showed up 90 minutes late to miss the preamble, which made me feel
like a POW.
While Harbor smacks of both Titanic and Ryan, it thankfully doesn't fall
into the same
set-in-modern-day-but-told-primarily-through-one-long-flashback trap that
served as nothing but a distraction in those two films.  That's about the
only positive thing I can say about Randall Wallace's script, which is yet
more evidence that his Braveheart must have been a total fluke.  Hans Zimmer
's (Hannibal) score is cold and manipulative but does manage to drown out
some of Wallace's cheesy dialogue.  Director Michael Bay (Armageddon)
relaxes his spastic style a bit and, with cinematographer John Schwartzman
(The Rock), concocts some nice-looking scenes (although some, like the
Hartnett/Beckinsale sexual romp through a hangar full of hanging parachutes,
inspire only a gag reflex).
As far as the acting goes, there's only so much you can do with a bad script
and a preponderance of scenes that were probably shot against a blue screen.
Affleck, Hartnett and Beckinsale fail to connect with the audience in any
manner whatsoever, and most of the supporting cast isn't around long enough
to make a lasting impression.  Aside from the stammering Ewen Bremner (Spud
from Trainspotting), the rest of the flyboys (William Lee Scott, Michael
Shannon, Matthew Davis) are all identical and as vanilla as their real-life
names.  The nursing crew is compromised of a gaggle of actresses best known
for starring in films/shows with one-word titles (James King, Blow;
Catherine Kellner, Shaft; Jennifer Garner, Felicity; Sara Rue, Popular).
As part of his ongoing effort to tackle every Navy cook role in Hollywood,
Cuba Gooding Jr. (Men of Honor) plays Dorie Miller, one of Harbor's few
characters based in reality, even though the film wouldn't have been a
smidgen different with him.  Dan Aykroyd, Alec Baldwin, William Fichtner,
Tom Sizemore and Colm Feore all log in decent yet small turns, but the best
performance belongs to Jon Voight, who, along with numerous facial
prosthetics, plays Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
2:55 - PG-13 for sustained intense war sequences, images of wounded, brief
sensuality and some language

There's a point in Pearl Harbor when Cuba Gooding Jr. leaps into a
battleship's gun turret and starts shooting down Japanese planes while
hell rages around him.  It's a dramatic moment... until you realize that
it's that "Show me the money!" guy from Jerry Maguire, shooting CGI
bullets at a CGI plane... and you are reminded once again just how phony
everything you've seen in Pearl Harbor has been.
Ironically, this incident, where ship's cook Dorie Miller took charge
and shot back during America's worst hour on December 7, 1941, is just
about the only true event to be found in the entire, oppressive
three-hour film.  (And our producers are quick to remind us of just how
ripped-from-history this little vignette is.  Never mind that Gooding
has a pitiful excuse for a role with maybe five minutes of screen time.)
After more than a year of hype, Pearl Harbor finally hits theater
screens this Memorial Day weekend, anxious to repeat that Titanic
experience, by throwing us a love story set in the most inhospitable of
locations.  In Titanic, of course, it was a sinking ship.  Here, it's in
the middle of a military base while the bombs are dropping around the
smoochie lovebirds.
The trailers have been coy with the plot, and I'll do my best to keep
the various twists secret (except for that whole Japanese invasion
bit... sorry).  Pretty boy Rafe (Ben Affleck) and his scruffy best
friend Danny (Josh Hartnett) grow up on a farm, dreaming of taking to
the skies in the Air Force.  They get their wish when they enlist in
1940, and as Rafe prepares to ship out, he falls madly in love with
Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale), half nurse, half pin-up girl.
Rafe, "a slow reader" but damn if he doesn't look good in uniform,
volunteers to serve in the British air force, surprising Evelyn and
Danny, who head for the sunny, peaceful shores of Hawaii's Pearl Harbor
naval base to "sit out" the war in Europe.  While Rafe fights the Nazis,
our other pals soak up some rays.
After much gnashing of teeth, we're thigh-deep in a love triangle.  But
wouldn't you know it?  Just as the Titanic began to sink halfway through
the film, the first bomb is dropped on Pearl Harbor at 1 hour, 30
minutes into Pearl Harbor.  35 minutes later, the siege is over, and we
are left to contend with an iffy dénouement (which takes another 55
minutes to get resolved, as the U.S. plans its lame, first
counterstrike).
Plot excepted, Pearl Harbor is a good-looking film.  When the planes
whoosh by we can almost feel the wind.  When the bombs drop, we feel the
shudder.  And when lovable supporting characters get blown to bits, it's
hard to suppress the waterworks.
However, anyone expecting a think piece on the war in the Pacific is
going to be sorely disappointed.  Unlike, say, Tora! Tora! Tora!,
history gets short shrift in Pearl Harbor, as director Michael Bay's
WWII for Dummies gives us laughably simplistic details about why the war
with Japan was entered into.  Bizarrely, yet in a blatant attempt to
garner an international audience that is not offended in any way by the
movie, the film virtually absolves Japan of any wrongdoing, excusing the
sneak attack as their regrettable only option.
Thank God, at least, that we are mercifully spared the Saving Private
Ryan and Titanic flash-forwards to a melodramatic, length-padding
present.  With a lame and drippy score courtesy of Hans Zimmer, there's
plenty of sap already, thank you very much.  As well, the film's few
attempt at lightening things up garner few laughs, if ever.
Critics (myself included) are going to endlessly compare Pearl Harbor to
Titanic, and for good reason.  However, aside from the length and the
love story, these are radically different pictures.  Ultimately, Pearl
Harbor is not a film made by a man fascinated with history (a la James
Cameron), but rather a studio-manufactured tearjerker, with nothing left
to chance.
Titanic was so opulent and obsessed with period detail it almost made
you forget that Billy Zane can't act.  Pearl Harbor is clearly the work
of hundreds of computer experts dueling it out to see who can make the
biggest explosion.  Been there, done that, folks.
Titanic was a big risk that took guts to make.  Pearl Harbor is just
another step toward the Disneyfication of our collective memories,
trying unsuccessfully to prey upon a resurgence of patriotism.
Titanic was epic, and it made you forget about the passage of time. 
Pearl Harbor is soulless and desperate in its cheesy attempt to appeal
to women, running at three hours long mainly because it's all done in
slow motion.
Which is funny, because the actual invasion in 1941 only lasted for less
than two.

     Months ago the trailer for PEARL HARBOR intrigued me.  Then I
got a rude shock at the end that it was produced by Jerry
Bruckheimer and directed by Michael Bay.  Bruckheimer is the king of
sound and fury action film blockbusters.  Michael Bay was his
director on THE ROCK and ARMAGEDDON.  PEARL HARBOR got some really
negative critical response prior to its release.  This may have
lowered my expectations, but I really do not see what the fuss was
about.  I would probably call PEARL HARBOR a flawed film, but not a
bad one.  Its historical accuracy is better than many films set in
the past but still worse than some.  PEARL HARBOR suffers a great
deal from comparison to TORA! TORA!  TORA!, one of the finest and
most accurate films about World War II and the classic account of
the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.  The plot is a somewhat mythic
story (some might call it "cliched") of two close friends who fall
out when they innocently both come to love the same woman.  Then
they have their relationship patched up when they face a cause more
important than their differences.
     PEARL HARBOR is the story of two men, friends since their
boyhood in Tennessee.  Rafe McCawley (played by Ben Affleck) and
Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) have a friendship based on each's love
of airplanes and flight.  They join the Army Air Corps together and
during the physical Rafe falls for an attractive nurse, Evelyn
Johnson (Kate Beckinsale).  Evelyn quickly becomes the second love
in Rafe's life; flying remains the first.  Even as he woos her,
giving her origami birds, flying is never far from his mind.
(Origami is ironically a Japanese art.)  When Rafe gets an
opportunity to fly with the RAF he takes it leaving Danny and Evelyn
behind.  Then he is shot down and thought to be dead the predictable
love triangle is set in motion.
     The casting of PEARL HARBOR, like most aspect of the film is
flawed.  Affleck is hardly the most charismatic lead, but here he
flies rings around the low-key Hartnett.  Beckinsale is a good
actor, probably most familiar for her role in COLD COMFORT FARM.
John Voight's face is just enough wrong for FDR to be irksome, like
a musical note played just slightly off-key.  Mako, of the Conan
movies, somehow plays a very different type of officer from how we
are used to seeing Yamamoto from films like TORA! TORA! TORA! and
MIDWAY.  Alec Baldwin plays a somewhat idealized Doolittle while Dan
Aykroyd, looking a little fat, is a navy intelligence officer.
     It is, perhaps, unfair to compare TORA! TORA! TORA! too closely
with PEARL HARBOR.  The former is an attempt at a very accurate
representation; the latter is a polished and soft focus love story
told against a backdrop of America's entry into the war.  It might
be more accurate to compare it to HANOVER STREET, even with the big
spectacular set piece of the half-hour of film devoted to an attack
that was only about an hour long in real life.  Bay uses time to
show the viewer a lot of different scenes of the destruction and how
the Americans fought back.
     PEARL HARBOR is a film that has an extremely nice look.  The
cinematography seems far better than the writing.  It is one of
those films in which you could take a frame from one of any number
of the scenes and use it for a poster for the film.  The frame
composition is often beautiful and occasionally even a little too
perfect and overly dramatic.  Early in the film Bay captures a very
nice 1941 feel and then drenches the scenes in a rich blue to top
off the image.  The viewer can frequently tell the CGI from reality,
but when it is following a bomb from the moment it is dropped down
into a compartment in a battleship, at least it is an imaginative
use.  At another point two sailors on a scaffold on the side of a
battleship see a torpedo approaching below them and hitting their
boat.  In another interesting usage of the visual effects a nurse is
slowly overcome by the horror of the casualties she is seeing she
enters a state of shock.  The camera shows this by leaving her in
focus and selectively loses focus on her surroundings.  These are
scenes that could never have been shown even in a TORA! TORA! TORA!.
     The style of PEARL HARBOR is spotty.  While the film shows half
an hour of unremitting violence, it is fairly reserved in its
showing of blood and there is no visible dismemberment, unlike
SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  Only the hospital scenes show serious carnage.
The dogfight scenes seem a little too much like a video game.  And
the rock song over the end credits was horribly out of place and
will be an embarrassment when this film is seen again in years to
come.
     Pearl Harbor is over three hours long, but is always worth
watching, if not worth listening to.  The film had undeniable
problems, but it was released needing only a fine tuning not the
overhaul must critics are implying is called for.  I rate it a 6 on
the 0 to 10 scale and a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.

Susan Granger's review of "PEARL HARBOR" (Disney/Touchstone Pictures)
          It's a glossy, three-hour, epic love story about the loss of 
innocence, set around the tragedy of "the day which will live in infamy," 
according to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (Jon Voight). And at $140+ 
million, it's also the most expensive movie ever made. So, is it a patriotic 
blockbuster? Yes. Is it an Oscar-contender, like "Titanic," its obvious 
inspiration? No. 
  Written by Randall Wallace ("Braveheart"), directed by Michael Bay 
("Armageddon") and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, "Pearl Harbor" delivers 
primarily in the violent, realistic action sequences: the Japanese sneak 
attack on the U.S. fleet on the fateful morning of December 7, 1941. Planes 
swoop in. Bombs explode. Battleships sink. Machine guns fire. 
   The two-pilots-and-a-Navy nurse love story fares less well. Ben 
Affleck and Josh Hartnett are boyhood pals who fall in love with the same 
woman, Kate Beckinsale. Affleck meets her at an Army induction center, where 
she inoculates his bare rump - twice. Romance ignites and blazes until his 
plane is shot down in the Battle of Britain. In Hawaii, Hartnett, delivers 
the news to Beckinsale and soon they find passion under the parachutes in an 
airfield hangar. But Affleck's not dead, and Beckinsale's pregnant. If it 
sounds trite, sappy and prosaic, it is. Without high drama or sentimentality, 
there's an emotional detachment, and it takes Col. James Doolittle's (Alec 
Baldwin) Tokyo raid, four months later, to resolve their destiny. But Cuba 
Gooding Jr is charismatic as cook who shot down Japanese Zeros and was the 
first African-American awarded the Navy Cross; too bad his part is so 
truncated. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Pearl Harbor" is an 
stunning, explosive 6. It's a contrived, commercial war movie. If you want 
accurate history, rent "Tora, Tora, Tora."

Producer Jerry Bruckheimer, using the same sensitivity that he did in 
COYOTE UGLY, turns his attention from scantily clad women who make their 
living by dancing on a bar to one of the seminal moments in our nation's 
history.  The result is that PEARL HARBOR is a lame love triangle in a 
patriotic wrapper.  It's the movie that everyone feared, incorrectly as 
it turned out, that TITANIC would be -- a big, expensive special effects 
extravaganza without a heart.  And it's the kind of movie that leaves 
viewers angry for wasting incredible amounts of their time with such 
drivel.
You'll laugh.  You'll cry.  You'll undoubtedly laugh out loud at its 
many sappy moments of ridiculous hokum.  And you probably at least feel 
like crying that such an important event in our country's history has 
been turned into a silly romance with one clichéd line after another.  
What a colossal wasted opportunity.
Buy the popcorn and go for the big tub.  You'll need something to do as 
you wait forever for the movie to get to its raison d'ętre, the 
destruction of most of the United States's navy at Pearl Harbor.
The movie's story concerns a pair of hotdog pilots, Rafe McCawley (Ben 
Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett), who grow up together and 
"fly" their first plane at age 9.  Once grown, they both end up as 
military pilots and in love with the same woman, Evelyn Johnson (Kate 
Beckinsale).  All of the characters are reduced to stereotypes so that 
you'll likely care little when tragedy strikes them.  Even the movie's 
sex scene, which is shot with a soap commercial gloss, is laughable.  
Sometimes the film gets so over-the-top that you begin to wonder if it 
is an intentional parody of a wartime romance.
The trite dialog includes such gems as, "You don't dogfight with a 
manual," "If I had one more night to live, I'd want to spend it with 
you," "All I ever wanted was to have a home and grow old together," and 
"Good huntin'."  After most such lines, the music is brought up 
dramatically.  The movie, with its heavy, syrupy score, frequently seems 
more like a music video than a movie.
Writer Randall Wallace (THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK) does come up with one 
good line.  When Rafe is asked by Doolittle (Alec Baldwin) if he knows 
what a "top secret mission" means, he replies that it's "the kind of 
mission where you get medals, and they send them to your relatives."
Yes, PEARL HARBOR, directed by Michael Bay (ARMAGEDDON), does have one 
of the best trailers ever.  The trailer scenes form the body of the 
movie's only successful part, the half-hour section that occurs just 
past the midpoint in this endurance contest of a picture -- it's over 
three hours long.  My advice to you is to arrive ninety minutes late 
since nothing, absolutely nothing, of interest happens until the 
Japanese Zeros arrive to obliterate our fleet.  A typical scene during 
the cinematic wasteland that is the movie's first half has Rafe stealing 
a police boat so that he can show the New York City lights to Evelyn.  
What, you will be asking yourself frequently during this period, does 
this all have to do with Pearl Harbor?  And, as you twiddle your thumbs 
waiting for something to happen, you'll keep asking yourself, "Why does 
this story have to be over three hours long?"
Responding to a compliment on his brilliance, the Japanese officer 
planning the infamous sneak attack, replies, "A brilliant man would find 
a way not to fight a war."  Which brings us to the movie's most 
intriguing revelation.  Pearl Harbor was our fault!  In a fascinating 
bit of revisionist history, the movie has the Japanese leader explain 
how they were forced into it.  Kind of makes you wonder what insights a 
Bruckheimer story about Hitler would divulge about his real motives.
If you're willing to put up with the saccharine nonsense of the first 
half, the movie's middle section -- a CGI tour de force -- will send 
chills up your spine as our boys are almost completely annihilated and 
sent to watery graves in which many still lie.  The computer generated 
effects are awesome, which is a good argument for seeing a film about 
the making of PEARL HARBOR.
"I'm not going to make it," one of the brave soldiers says at the end.  
I know just how he feels.  I barely made it through the long ordeal of 
watching the movie.
PEARL HARBOR runs a butt-numbing 3:03.  It is rated PG-13 for sustained 
intense war sequences, images of the wounded, brief sensuality and some 
language and would be acceptable for teenagers.  Its PG-13 rating is 
quite questionable since the horrific scenes of the wartime wounded, who 
squirt blood everywhere, are much more intense than you'd ever expect to 
find in a PG-13 film.
The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, May 25, 2001.  
In the Silicon Valley, it will be showing at the AMC and the Century 
theaters.

Just in time for Memorial Day Weekend of 2001, producers Jerry Bruckheimer 
and Michael Bay have brought out PEARL HARBOR, their treatment of the sneak 
attack with which the Japanese military  according to one of their own 
admirals  "awakened the sleeping giant" of the United States.
It was the final catalyst that brought our country into the complicated 
global skirmish of the Second World War, which had been raging for more than 
two years across different continents.  Needless to say, the attack on 
December 7, 1941, and the events surrounding it, would be difficult topics 
for any filmmaker.  That director Michael Bay succeeds in many dimensions is 
most commendable;  but the film is not the epic he has tried to engineer.
The opening scenes show a couple of tow-headed American boys in Tennessee in 
1923, playing war in a dusty plane parked in a barn.  We don't discover why 
this plane is abandoned when viable aviation had been around only ten years 
or so (could a plane get so dusty if it were used just five years before, in 
the Great War?).  A charming little opening, the action has little Rafe 
McCawley (played as an adult by Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (played later 
by Josh Hartnett) accidentally begin a take-off in a real plane, the crop 
duster belonging to Rafe's dad.  Characterization kicks in when Danny's 
father starts to whup his little boy, and Rafe conks the offender with a 
board  from here on, Rafe is Danny's guardian, a role we know will be 
tested in the future.
Skip ahead to 1940-41, when the boys are young men and aspiring pilots for 
the Army Air Corps.  In several of the scenes Bay and screenwriter Randall 
Wallace sketch their characters as likable and vibrant, but the rather 
slow-paced romance that develops between Rafe and Navy nurse Evelyn Johnson 
(Kate Beckinsdale) bogs down the story.  Only the interesting historical 
background redeems the story in the first hour or so.  We follow Rafe in his 
odyssey with the squadron of American pilots who flew with the British 
against the German Air Force  before any American declaration of war.  We 
watch a few human interest plots develop out on Oahu, at the base at Pearl 
Harbor.  Hawaii was thought to be a safe and distant outpost. But the 
Japanese Empire was pursuing their own military and industrial agendas, 
putting them on a collision course with the Pacific fleet of the United 
States.
When Rafe returns from his harrowing journey, his best friend has taken his 
girl, an old but still striking twist of events.  Yes, there is turmoil 
among the three young and passionate people; but the attack that shook the 
world interrupts the love triangle, and provides us with very exciting 
action.
I was hoping that the film would take all necessary steps to preserve the 
dignity of all of the Americans who died in the raid, and all those who 
survived it.  For the most part, this dignity comes out intact.  Part of the 
hype surrounding this huge movie event, as a matter of fact, has been 
involvement with survivors, veterans now around 80 who are educating younger 
generations through interviews and television specials.  In one scene, 
Colonel Jimmy Dolittle, the flying ace of the First World War who is now 
leading a raid on Tokyo, comments that victory will be ours.  When he points 
to Rafe and Danny, we know that he is speaking of the entire generation of 
solid Americans who would exert whatever efforts required to defeat the Axis 
powers.
You have to hand it to Michael Bay.  He knows what patriotic chords to 
strike, what heartstrings to pluck.
Perhaps the most affecting moments come when President Roosevelt, himself an 
icon to our eyes, reflects the iconography of the times.  Jon Voight is very 
credible as the President (save for the foam padding lining his neck); when 
he delivers the ingenious rhetoric of Roosevelt and his policymakers ("Tell 
that to the Marines") and especially when he struggles out of his 
wheelchair to argue a point, we sit enrapt and tingling with patriotism.  
Fortunately, Bay does not linger on sepia-tinted scenes of yesteryear, as he 
did in ARMAGEDDON, in which we were made to watch men sitting around 
traditional barber shops, listening to the radio, or children running 
through dust motes and past a mural of JFK still visible on clapboard stores 
40 years after his election.  Thank goodness this tone of mindless jingoism 
does not come through in PEARL.
Many of the shots remind us that Michael Bay got his chops directing videos 
that riveted the interest of MTV fans.  At times the pace is frantic; in one 
sequence during the main attack, viewers are assaulted with at least 30 
different shots in one minute.  It is always a challenge to watch such a 
series of images;  with any text that moves so quickly, the viewer must 
spend enormous energy just to make sense of the events.  More viewings would 
be needed to notice the finer points of composition and detail.
The images are remarkable, though.  In this new look at the attack, computer 
generation is used very well.  Seeing such a large portion of the U.S. 
Pacific fleet at anchor inspires awe.  It's a great recreation of the ships, 
and some of the best battle footage has the camera zooming straight through 
the strafing and bombing, the battleships exploding all around.  Still, we 
see a fuzziness about the bottom of the shots, as if we are watching 
animated paintings of the conflict, perhaps an artist's grim and smoky 
depiction for the cover of a paperback novel.  Dog fights are also 
supercharged by computer generated images.  Tracers zip and scream 
everywhere, adding to the furor of the new war.  No doubt many of the Zeros 
are digital replicas  but their sheer numbers are astounding (Japanese 
Commander Fuchida attacked with over 350 planes, and lost 29 to ground fire 
and a small pack of American pilots who managed to get aloft).  It's hard to 
tell which explosions are enhanced, but the gore of the casualties lends 
realism in many scenes.  At times Bay blurs the picture to simulate the 
chaos created by the carnage.  We watch Evelyn and her fellow nurses 
scramble around the once-empty base hospital, now packed with panic-and 
pain-stricken soldiers and sailors.  These shots are effectively crafted and 
arranged to evoke the mood of sudden tragedy.
Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett both deliver good performances.  Their acting 
is transparent, and their brotherly relationship causes us to realize that 
they will go on as brothers despite loving the same woman.  These actors do 
all that is asked of them, though some of it is telegraphed too early for my 
tastes; I got the bitter taste of predictability early, like a penny touched 
to the tongue.
Kate Beckinsdale does fine in filling her role; she is sufficiently at a 
loss when she discovers she must choose between the men she loves.  An 
engaging subplot develops with Evelyn and her fellow nurses, and we are 
moved when the larger conflict encroaches upon their lives.  A small rub: 
the long and flowing hairstyles of some of these women are laughable in a 
hospital setting.
Tom Sizemore and Dan Ackroyd are underused, as a gruff plane mechanic and a 
code-breaking specialist, respectively.  Wonderful character actors, they 
are.  The same can't be said of Alec Baldwin, a good actor given lines full 
of platitudes and feel-good bravado: thanks to the script, his Dolittle is a 
cardboard commanding officer of the type that Baldwin might himself mock on 
a future "Saturday Night Live."
It was very heartening to look around the theater and spot viewers of 
various ages.  Early summer movies hoping to become blockbusters usually try 
to attract teenagers, a key to financial success at the box office.  But I 
spotted several watchers who were children on that fateful Sunday morning of 
the actual attack. I can imagine the film will be used in middle and high 
school history classes, though the long running time would probably result 
in only scenes being shown.  In any case, the PG-13 rating is warranted 
because of combat violence and language, with one love scene in which there 
is no nudity.
PEARL HARBOR falls short of epic status, though it does honor the  men and 
women represented by these actors.  Of course visual tribute is paid to the 
generation who lived through Pearl Harbor  in the devastating scenes of the 
battleships and other vessels buckled and sunk by torpedoes, in underwater 
shots of sailors and an American flag riddled with holes.  The real 
Battleship Arizona appears at the end, its big guns encrusted with rust and 
plant life.  In our image-conscious world, all of these shots helps to 
memorialize Americans who sacrificed their hearts and lives; but perhaps the 
best homage is paid through reminding young viewers about the identity of 
Americans, through reviving the history that helped to shape the world we 
live in every day.

Coming out of the new three-hour extravaganza about the bombing of Pearl 
Harbor I heard a teenage boy say "That's the best movie I ever saw!" But 
then again, back in the '70s I heard a teenage girl in a record store 
say to her friend "Did you know Paul McCartney was with another group 
before Wings?" The point is, teenage memories are short and context is 
limited.
Pearl Harbor is likely not the best movie you will ever see, but it is 
probably not the worst. For the palate refreshed by explosions there is 
plenty of nourishment here, though it's long in coming. For the eye 
delighted by Hawaiian sunsets and attractive young people there is much 
to feast on. For the mind that craves emotional subtlety, historical 
complexity, or depth of character, the menu is thin. For the ear that 
lives for true and credible dialogue, there are always earplugs (and 
these will be handy too for Hans Zimmer's bombastic score - how did they 
expect people to fight a war with all that music going on?)
Producer Jerry Bruckheimer, director Michael Bay, and screenwriter 
Randall Wallace understood that three hours of bombing were too much 
even for an American audience, so they constructed their tale of the 
Japanese sneak attack on the American fleet around a love triangle. 
Cocky, square-jawed Rafe (Ben Affleck) and shy, square-jawed Danny (Josh 
Hartnett) are childhood pals from Tennessee whose love of flying lands 
them in the military flying planes first chance they get (Affleck, 
crowding 30, looks like he might have already logged about ten years in 
the service, but who's counting?) Rafe meets lovely nurse Evelyn (Kate 
Beckinsale) while she's jabbing a needle into his bare fanny in the 
induction center, where she overlooks his inability to read an eye chart 
because he's obviously a born flyer even if he is illiterate (but not 
too illiterate to write and read eloquent love letters later on.)
Who wouldn't fall in love with a girl like that? Rafe does, but then he 
volunteers for a dangerous assignment to the Battle of Britain, and is 
shot down. After a suitable period of mourning Danny steps into the 
romantic picture, and the triangle is joined when something unexpected 
(to them, not to us) transpires.
Soon (some would say not soon enough) romance is overshadowed by infamy 
(or, as a tearful Evelyn puts it to Rafe, ".and then all this 
happened!") On come the Japanese, and the havoc wrought is truly 
spectacular. Some of it is viscerally stunning, some of it is 
emotionally devastating, and some of it looks like a video game.
Meanwhile, back in the White House, FDR (Jon Voight) is waging a heroic 
battle against his infirmity - not the polio that has crippled his legs, 
but the latex wattles that threaten to fall off his face whenever he 
waxes wroth. And in the Japanese fleet, Admiral Yamamoto (Mako) 
struggles with portentous doubts and dialogue ("Brilliant, Sir!" 
exclaims an aide, and he retorts "A brilliant man would find a way not 
to fight a war.") And nobody fights more hopeless odds than Alec Baldwin 
as the valiant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle, who is saddled with some of the 
worst lines in the movie ("There's nothing stronger than the heart of a 
volunteer,") but still manages some welcome swagger.
Bruckheimer & Co. don't want to leave us bummed out over the devastation 
of Pearl, so they've tacked on the bonus of Doolittle's daring 
retaliatory raid on Tokyo, and a romantic coda at the end which leaves 
us wondering how these sorely needed veterans got out of the service 
while, by the evidence of the age of the little boy, the war must still 
be raging.
Pearl Harbor is overwrought and underwritten, but for a generation to 
whom WWII is vague and ancient history, it serves to bring into focus a 
time when America lost its innocence and rose up to kick foreign butt.

A dull and oppressingly long three-hour ode to the glory of war and
killing. It's about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor produced by the
schlockmeister himself, Jerry Bruckheimer, and directed by-the-numbers
by Michael Bay ("The Rock"/"Armageddon"). This strictly commercial
film's budget was for $135 million and uses as its model for financial
success "Titanic" and its anti-historical way of telling its historical
story. It's a film made for the huge crowds it hopes to pull in, by
giving them all the goo they could possibly ingest in one sitting. It
ran a cliché romance story for two hours worth of the film and after 80
minutes of this corny love story, the Japanese at last attack Pearl
Harbor and the film to its credit accurately gets the chaos of the
events right (the only thing it got right in the film). This invasion
was the heart of the film and lasted for about 40 minutes; it got its
money's worth in good airplane battle footage from the
computer-generated imagery (though the scene itself had a flatness that
made it appear uninvolving but competenly done; there was no emotional
resonance to any of the action; it was respected for its technical
achievement rather than for being artistic). For the last third of the
film you could have skipped out and missed nothing, because it went back
to that annoying love story it was hammering out.
Every thing about this film was second rate; especially, when compared
to modern war films such as "Saving Private Ryan." The trite dialogue,
inept script, misuse of history, irritating character portrayals, the
soapy background music, and the clanky acting by everyone concerned,
made this overlong work into a critical bomb. The main characters were
either boring gung-ho militarists with serious personal disorders or
all-American beauties posing as super-dedicated nurses, whose only other
interest besides nursing was hunting a man down. Every character was a
stock character seen in many other Hollywood films. The funniest moment
in the film, which was a purely Hollywood fictional moment and meant to
be deadly serious, had a heavily puffed up latex faced FDR (Jon Voight)
climb out of his wheelchair to rally his White House advisers after the
attack. I couldn't help myself from laughing, it was such a silly
attempt at patriotism. After the attack and FDR's stirring "A Date Which
Will Live in Infamy" speech to the nation, the country was prepared for
war and phony scenes such as the FDR one was misleading as well as
revolting.
The film opens in 1923 and shows farmboys Rafe (Affleck) and Danny
(Hartnett) as best friends in Tennessee, only interested in airplanes.
That's about as deep as we get into their characters. They join the
United States Army Air Corps in 1941 and both show an ability at being
hotshot pilots while training under the command of Jimmy Doolittle
(Baldwin), in Long Island. Rafe passes the eye test, despite his
apparent dyslexia, on the mercy of pretty nurse Evelyn Johnson (British
actress, Kate Beckinsale), accepting his pompous speech to her how he's
the best pilot in the world. Kate has fine features and virtuous good
looks, and an empty expression that is the same both for love of Rafe
and of country. He gets to meet her after he takes an extra immunization
shot in the butt and he falls on his nose. They fall in love during
their brief few weeks of courtship, but he volunteers to join a British
Eagle Squadron to help them stop Hitler's Luftwaffe invasion of their
country. News comes back that he was killed in action when his plane was
shot down in the ocean. The shy Danny then falls in love with Evelyn,
and he soon makes love with her under one of many white parachutes left
on the ground. The romantic triangle becomes gooey when Rafe comes back
alive and he tells how he was rescued at sea and remained in
Nazi-occupied France. Trouble between the best buddies results when
Danny tries to explain to Rafe in an Hawaiian nightspot what happened
and the two get into a brawl requiring MP's to break it up. Rafe acts
irrationally, believing his buddy stabbed him in the back and is angry
at both Evelyn and Danny. But all three of them are at Pearl Harbor on,
Dec. 7, 1941, the day the Japanese under Admiral Yamamoto (Mako) attack,
and the two heroically work together to fight back from the sneak attack
by engaging in dog fights with the enemy. Evelyn is splendid in the
bloody hospital, never even getting one hair out of place as she rushes
around treating the maimed. The most memorable scene from the attack, is
the hundred or so sailors from the U.S.S. Arizona entombed below and are
down too far to be rescued as they died scratching out for help.
The attack starts off by showing the 350 Japanese bombers coming in
formation through the early morning sunshine as housewives hang their
clothes on the lines and children play baseball. The bombers then go on
to attack the American ships grouped-together, planes on the ground, and
personnel in almost the same time frame the real attack occurred. The
film plays it safe and lays no blame on why Pearl Harbor was so
unprotected. Admiral Kimmel (Feore) can only say the War Department's
warning of an attack came an hour too late. Cuba Gooding Jr. plays Dorie
Miller, a real-life cook aboard the U.S.S. Arizona, whose heroics during
the attack made him the first African-American to receive the Navy
Cross. His story in the film is reduced to using him as a demographic.
Miller's story is shot in a number of brief scenes: he wins a boxing
match against a burly white guy, tells Evelyn he wants respect and wants
to fire the weapons instead of being a cook in the segregated military,
is complimented by his commanding officer for his boxing skills and
later comforts him when he's dying, and shoots down a plane. No
character in the film had any shading or depth, everyone was a
forgettable personality. The Kate Beckinsale was particularly empty, we
never find out her history or anything about her. We only know her
father was a pilot.
The last third of the film has the two men assigned to Colonel
Doolittle's secret mission, where they bomb Tokyo (actually Gary,
Indiana steel mills) to show them that we're ready to take them on and
show them what we're all about. Evelyn waits back at a military base for
them to return, but there's no excitement about anything in this film,
including who she chooses as her man. The one-dimensional characters
just say their lines and the film keeps moving along. Though this film
failed in every which way to provide a history lesson, or an engaging
story, or be an entertaining film; still I'm afraid it will have
box-office success. It reduced everything to the lowest commom
denominator by the crass Bruckheimer rules for commercial success (keep
the dialogue banal and down to the film's theme, and keep everything in
motion so no ideas could get in the way of the mindless violence on the
screen; this way it remains on a fourth grade level and can be easily
understood by the masses). It would be difficult to make a film more
shallow than this one; but, I'm cynically looking forward to Bay and
Bruckheimer teaming up again, I think they have the potential to stoop
lower than they have so far (because as bad as this film was, it could
have been worst).
