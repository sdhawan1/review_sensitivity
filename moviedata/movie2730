   Move over Ingmar Bergman.  Only a relative handful of
American moviegoers ever saw your "Scenes from a
Marriage," however honest and searing a portrait that
wrenching 168-minute film.  Here in America, we have
another voice telling us about the disintegration of a
marriage, and what's more, he tells all in English so that we
don't have to read those pesky titles or hear people like Max
von Sydow endlessly drone, "It was the bleak winter following
a wet and discouraging summer, a time that Eva was birthing
her fourth child and thinking of going away for a spell..."
  Just kidding, Ingmar, nobody will compare with you when it
comes to depressing the heck out of us about the miseries of
matrimony, but even you might get a kick out of Rob Reiner's
mixture of comedy and pathos in "The Story of Us."  The
picture is loaded with side-splitting side roles, particularly
those involving the director who is acting in his own
production, with whimsical one-liners thrown in by the frizzy-
haired Rita Wilson, a trio of full-of-themselves psychologists,
a literary agent, and even an irrelevant piece of nonsense
from none other than Red Buttons as the wife of perennial
AARP spokesperson Betty White.  What's more Reiner
coaxes yet another surprisingly adept performance by Bruce
Willis who once again does not lay his finger on a gun, and
gets some movement from one of my least favorite gorgeous
actresses, Michelle Pfeiffer.
   "The Story of Us" is about history: not about the sort that
begins in Sumer but the history of a marriage: how it begins
as two people fall in lust, how, like the good citizens of
Sumer and Troy they build something (in this case a couple
of model kids), and how like all glorious civilizations they fall
apart.  The ending is an out-and-out copout, because Reiner
is not Bergman and American moviegoers are presumably
not as realistic and down-to-earth as Swedes.  If you left the
theater four minutes before the conclusion, as some did
believing that the movie had already run its course, you were
lucky to miss the contrived conclusion.  Notwithstanding, the
picture ranks as a insightful if not brilliant piece of story-telling
that does not quite rise to the level of myth.  The Big Truth
about relationships, though--that honeymoons last for only a
year or two--is already too well known by most of us, even if
we act as though we'd never heard the concept.
   In Alan Zweibel and Jessie Nelson's screenplay, Reiner
relates the highs and lows of a 15-year marriage between two
people who--by the looks of them--should never have had the
troubles they experienced. Unfortunately they each had a
different pair of parents who indoctrinated them in distinct
ways, so that when one marriage counselor advises that
"when you go to bed, there are six people lying with you" and
when Reiner graphically illustrates this well-known idea, we
get the point.
   Reiner uses a stage device sparingly and effectively.  From
time to time, Katie (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Ben Jordan (Bruce
Willis) face the camera separately and tell us in the audience
what's on their minds. Each is eager to have the viewers as
allies.  You can tell from their soliloquies, though, that as
much as they expect to split, they dream of reconciling their
differences.  Katie composes crossword puzzles for her boss
while Ben is a novelist.  Ben is the more spontaneous
person, one who does not even wear a watch, while Katie is
more the type who goes through life on schedules.  Ben
declares aloud to Katie, in full volume, "You turned into your
god-damned mother," while Katie muses, "When is the
moment in a marriage when a spoon becomes just a spoon?"
   Each time the two are getting along just fine, one of them
says something that sounds to us innocent enough, but that's
all it takes to set off another war of the roses.  Bruce Willis as
Ben and Michelle Pfeiffer as his wife of 15 years, Katie, do
not really convince us that what they say can be responsible
for these orgies of verbal destruction, but anyone who has
been married as long as their characters have been can
relate to the fact that just about anything can be used as an
excuse to let off steam.
   The real fun comes from side characters, though,
particularly director Rob Reiner in the role of Ben's best
friend.  In one discussion, he uses a down-to-earth illustration
to prove his point.  "Look at me," he suggests to Ben, leaning
over.  "What do you see?"  "Your ass," replies Ben, the
seemingly obvious answer.  "Wrong.  I don't have an ass.
That is an illusion.  This is just the tops of legs butting
together--that's why they call it a butt. Love is an illusion, just
like the ass.  Love is lust."  When Katie gets together with her
best friends, played by Rita Wilson and Julie Hagerty, they
too discuss the nature of relationships, taking a similarly pithy
route, with even more ribald terminology than that used by
the men.  
   What is most diverting about the flashbacks is the mere
sight of the characters as they appeared fifteen years back. 
Ben, now with thinning hear, sports hippie-ish locks and Katie
looks dazzling with her hair long and flowing freely.  The
scene shot in Venice, where the troubled couple went to try
to repair their regressive marriage, is especially convincing
and droll, particularly when Ben and Katie meet "the Kirbys
from Cleveland," each the epitome of the ugly American.  
   The tagline for the film is, "Can a marriage survive 15
years of marriage?"  Ingmar Bergman and Rob Reiner have
different answers, each suitable for his own kind of audience. 
Bergman's is the more realistic.  Reiner's will bring in the box
office.  So then: "The Story of Us"--a worthwhile feature in
the Rob Reiner comic tradition with two perfectly fine
performances by Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer.

Rob Reiner's "The Story of Us," the new comedy-drama about the highs and lows 
of a couple's rocky 15-year marriage, is a film that gets so many of the 
details exactly right, that it comes as a disappointment to find that the 
denouement arrives about twenty minutes too early, apparently due to either 
numerous cuts made prior to its release, or a promising, if uneven, script 
that wasn't ready to be put onto film. The talent is all in place, it seems, 
but its snappily-paced structure in which it goes back-and-forth in time only 
causes the proceedings to feel episodic and strangely disjointed.
Ben (Bruce Willis) and Katie Jordan (Michelle Pfeiffer) have been married 
fifteen years, and to most, give off the appearance of being gloriously happy 
with each other. At dinner with their children, 10-year-old Erin (Colleen 
Rennison) and 12-year-old Josh (Jake Sandvig), each night, they like to play 
a game called High/Low, in which they go around the room and each family 
member must state their highest and lowest point of that particular day. Once 
alone, however, Ben and Katie's exteriors transform from marital bliss to 
their plans on what they are going to do when the kids leave for summer camp 
the following day--they will leave together, for the children, but Ben is 
then going to start packing up some clothes for his stay at a nearby hotel, 
without Katie. Once separated by everything but the telephone (they construct 
artificial excuses just to call up each other because they do secretly long 
to be together again), both sides of the progressively-drifting-apart couple 
reminisce about what their life has been like since they first met each 
other. Will they realize that fifteen years is simply too much time for them 
to throw their relationship away, or will they come to terms with the fact 
that they'll most likely be better off apart? I'll leave the particulars of 
the answer to this question up to the viewer to discover, but let's put it 
this way--had the more subtle, skilled Woody Allen have made the picture 
(and, for the most part, it really is reminiscent of his work), the outcome 
probably would have been a little different.
As it should be, the two people that are front-and-center for the entirety of 
the brief 96-minute running time are Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer, both 
of whom have never been better (aside from Pfeiffer's marvelous role as 
Catwoman in 1992's "Batman Returns"). Willis, usually burdened by an 
unknowing smirk plastered upon his face, throws the majority of his usual 
acting mannerisms to the wind to create a character we have never seen him 
play before, and his performance here--and it hits all of the right notes, 
mind you--is even superior to his delicately poignant turn in the recent 
box-office smash, "The Sixth Sense."    
Michelle Pfeiffer, an engaging actress who, nonetheless, makes frequent 
missteps in her film choices (just take a look at her work in the otherwise 
mediocre 1999 drama, "The Deep End of the Ocean," and 1997's painfully 
overwrought "A Thousand Acres"), is Willis' match in every way. Bringing off 
an astute believability to the premise, Pfeiffer, more than even Willis, 
makes her character someone who creditably appears to be longing for a 
reconciliation with the man whom she still loves deeply. And her final, 
tearful monologue is a real winner, evoking the distinct feelings of joy, 
pain, sentimentality, and frustration that, no doubt, comes with any close 
marriage. Despite being instructed to scream at one another a few too many 
times for my taste, the marital woes of Ben and Katie are effectively and 
realistically brought to life, as we find ourselves truly caring about what 
happens to them. 
It's not so much that there is anything distinctly wrong with what appears in 
the finished product of "The Story of Us," as there is merely a sensation 
floating overhead that tells me the film could have been remarkably better 
had the screenplay, by Alan Zweibel and Jessie Nelson, been more 
fully-written. The flashback-laden construction of the plotting is 
smoothly-done, but for it to really work to its fullest potential, the film 
calls for itself to be of epic proportions, a motion picture about the truths 
of marriage and love/hate relationships, similar to Ingmar Bergman's 1973 
drama, "Scenes from a Marriage." As is, there are many on-target moments that 
hold just the right tone, while several montages are included to rush us 
through protracted periods of time. The problem is, the montages seem like 
nothing but advertisements for the actual film, and, I swear to you, one 
montage late in the picture is almost exactly like the theatrical trailer, 
with even the same music score, by Eric Clapton, in the background.  
The supporting cast is chock-full of recognizable thesps that are 
unfortunately all wasted. Rob Reiner and Paul Reiser briefly appear as Ben's 
friends, and ditto for Rita Wilson and the severely underrated Julie Hagerty 
as Katie's. Tim Matheson has nothing to do but play the potential guy that 
Katie is considering having an affair with, and there is no attempt to turn 
him into anything more than a one-dimensional figure whose purprose is to 
cause a conflict. Really, the only supporting performance that is worth 
noting is that of Colleen Rennison as Erin, Ben and Katie's young daughter. 
The 12-year-old Rennison (last seen in a pair of 1996 bombs, "Carpool" and 
"Unforgettable") proves to be a naturally-gifted actress who is touching as a 
girl who suspects something is wrong with her parents, but hopes only for the 
best.
In its depiction of a marriage on the rocks, "The Story of Us" is successful 
in its ideas, but not necessarily in its treatment. There are many wonderful 
moments, including an interlude midway through in which Katie and Ben decide 
to take a trip to Venice in an attempt to rekindle their flames, and a 
particular scene that shows them dancing along the water is simply magical. 
Its major fall, however, comes in its generally crowd-pleasing conclusion 
that, to be sure, leaves things on an uplifting note, but feels like a cheat 
when considering the validity of the situations that had come before. It has 
been widely reported that Willis filmed this movie around the same time his 
own marriage with actress Demi Moore was coming to an end. Perhaps in staying 
with the film's truthfulness, Willis should have suggested a less-neat finale 
that remained faithful to its characters and their plight, without going into 
what could basically be described as fantasy territory.

"The Story of Us" could be described as a sequel to "When Harry met Sally,"
you know, like fifteen years later and with a heavier drama to comedy ratio.
There's a lot of the same back and forth talk about the nature of men and
women and relationships that's probably been going on for centuries with
very little universal resolution. However, instead of single people
chattering about this, we now have two very married folks with very real
kids. The weight of their history is far too heavy to support a Harry/Sally
lightness.
About midway through, Bruce and Michelle head off on a Venetian vacation in
hopes of "jump-starting" their waning marriage. This is were they meet the
movie's comic relief: a hilariously annoying couple from the States. But the
bickering stalemate demands further relief, so Paul Reiser and the director
himself (Rob Reiner) make comedic appearances. Though these two are amusing,
you'll still have to wade through more than a few yelling spats from the
leads.
I don't know about you, but I don't enjoy arguments at temper's edge. In
fact, when neighbors raise their voices to each other, my usual reaction is
to take a walk. Though this film's arguments are very well acted and
probably ring dissonantly true for many married (or divorced) movie-goers --
I just wanted to take a walk during those parts. That said, the highlight of
the film is a Willis monologue that brilliantly combines humor, sarcasm and
heartfelt soul-searching. Pfeiffer has a similar, yet less effective
monologue (near-missing the mark despite her fine efforts).
As for a plot ... Bruce and Michelle start the movie in marital discord
hobbling towards separation. To keep your attention, the filmmakers rely
entirely on strong performances, topical chit-chat and basic suspense ...
will they break up or realize that they're perfect for each other?

The Story of Us, a Rob Reiner film, is the second movie this fall that touches
the viewer in a way they are rarely touched by a film, as they can see their
everyday lives in the usually once in a year films.  Well, 1999 has two of
them, the other being the instant classic about a very dysfunctional family,
American Beauty.  The Story of Us, a film about the highs and lows of marriage
and family, is a well written, heartbreaking and insightful film that made the
majority of the audience, including myself, cry.
The Story of Us tells the story of Ben (Bruce Willis) and Katie (Michelle
Pfeiffer) Jordan, and asks the question, "Can a marriage survive 15 years of
marriage?"  The film is about two individuals who have come together, spent a
good chunk of their lives together, and shows when our main characters are
"him" and "her" (during the bad times), and when they are "us" (during the good
times).  The Story of Us is about their entire 15 years of marriage that is
collapsing day by day.  Ben and Katie now only see and live with each other
because they don't want to devastate their children with the fact that their
parents no longer, or at least say they don't, love each other anymore.  Ben, a
cartoonist, and Katie, a crossword puzzle writer, have grown apart during their
fifteen years of marriage, as they have grown to follow different views on
life, family, and marriage.  Katie is the more organized, sophisticated type,
who wants to plan everything out, while Ben is a spontaneous, adventurous
individual who doesn't mind doing things differently than they were planned.
The Story of Us plays out nicely, as the film opens with Ben sharing his story
with a therapist, told to the viewer through flashbacks.  As the film
progresses, it switches between Ben and Katie talking to their therapist, with
their stories being told with flashbacks of their marriage.  This method is
highly effective, as we see the characters changing from year to year, slowly
growing apart.  Through the flashbacks, we get to see the story of them through
both of the character's eyes, and this gives us a strong sense of what their
characters are really like, as The Story of Us has three dimensional,
believable main characters.
The screenplay, written by Jessie Nelson (Stepmom) and Alan Zweibel (Dragnet),
is a touching, down to earth work that hits a chord within the viewer, much
like another one of Nelson's films, Stepmom.  The script has an open honesty
and outlook on life, one that is so realistic, you feel uncomfortable at many
times, because so many situations the characters are in are undeniably
familiar, as most families these days most go through the hard times, as Ben
and Katie must.  If it wasn't for the first 15 minutes that the writers wrote,
which are rugged and certainly flawed, The Story of Us would have been this
year's best picture.
Bruce Willis, a usual action/adventure star, has certainly turned himself
around in the past year- He went from being a man who was being typecast to the
same role in action movies, to a distinguished, sophisticated actor, as in last
summer's The Sixth Sense; and now in The Story of Us, Willis shows the world
what he can really do if he is fed a good script.  Although I wouldn't pick
Willis as the choice actor for Ben Jordan, Willis handles himself nicely, and
shines in a few of the film's most powerful scenes, enough that make his
performance a definite contender comes awards season.
Where to start about Michelle Pfeiffer?  Pfeiffer's performance is spellbinding
and ultimately strong, as she brings her character to life with such charisma
and emotion, you wonder how, how it is possible for someone to portray a real
person with such realism.  Pfeiffer's performance is one that if not recognized
by the Academy next spring, will be in the heart's of any viewer that has
watched this moving film.
The Story of Us is one of 1999's most real, yet funny films, as the razor sharp
script evens out the laughs and the tears to keep the viewer hooked.  Superb
acting, direction, writing, story, and soundtrack that always sets the mood for
the film, which is beautifully composed by Eric Clapton and Marc Shaiman, make
The Story of Us a touching, unforgettable motion picture that will touch the
hearts of viewers across the country- And will certainly become one of the most
talked about movies of the fall.  The film's major high points are the fights
between Ben and Katie, as the two constantly accuse of each other of whose
fault it is that their marriage has collapsed, and although they also say
things like "It's over," or "I hate you," you can tell the two still share a
deep connection, and that inside, somewhere, they are still an "us."
The Bottom Line:  A wonderful, enchanting, and heartbreaking film.  One of the
most realistic, heartbreaking films in recent years.

Don't be ashamed if you think of your marriage or relationship during
segments of `The Story of Us'. Although his presentation is problematic,
director Rob Reiner successfully navigates a mine field of clichés to
deliver a truthful and touching romance. Some may argue that the
constant, hateful bickering of the two main characters is depressing to
watch transpire. But, surprisingly, it does wonders for the one vital
element that a successful romance requires: realism.
`The Story of Us' is the story of Ben and Katie Jordan (Bruce Willis &
Michelle Pfeiffer), a separated couple who have reached the crucial
juncture of contemplating divorce. He's an accomplished writer, she's a
crossword puzzle creator - and over the course of a rocky 15-year
marriage, both have grown apart from each other. The only reason Ben and
Katie remain bonded by marriage is their two children. Even though they
have lost the spark that once lit their relationship, both want to avoid
leaving an entire family in devastated ruins due to their unfortunate
inadequacies.
Out of the gate, substantial problems surface for Reiner & company. Ben
and Katie talk directly to the camera in personal monologues to share
their separate, opinionated views. We've all become accustomed to this
approach, haven't we? But just as `The Story of Us' seems destined for
failure, Reiner straps us in and provides an overwhelming roller-coaster
of emotions. The most surprising thing is that these emotions seem
genuine and heartfelt, and not manipulative or preachy. We laugh and cry
along with these characters, because if we were placed in a similar
situation, our actions would not be indifferent. If this is a strategic
form of manipulation, then it is effective and impressively disguised.
Chalk down another point for Bruce Willis, who delivers his second
excellent performance of 1999 (the first was his restrained, effective
execution in `The Sixth Sense'). Give the man, who is normally
accustomed to firing machine guns and thwarting evil terrorists, due
credit for flexing his dramatic muscles with such success (just for the
record, Willis also gave a strong performance as an imaginary pink bunny
in Reiner's abysmal orphan comedy `North'). Pfeiffer is equally
wonderful, despite the glaring fact that her character does not possess
the clear, accentuated definition that Ben does. Both actors have
lovely, touching instances of understated power - each breaking through
the threshold to truthfully capture a moment in time. These brief
seconds are so well realized that they make `The Story of Us' worthwhile
as a whole.
What are these instances? Well, Willis has a knockout scene in which he
boils over with rage in a restaraunt, and Pfeiffer deals a climactic
speech that brought teary eyes to the majority of viewers at the
screening I attended. As good friends of the Jordan's, Rob Reiner and
Rita Wilson are highly amusing and compatible together, but the talented
Paul Reiser (as Ben's agent) gets cornered with the film's worst
material. There's an early drought that slips into unfunny, perverse
humor, but `The Story of Us' gradually develops into a real charmer.
Reiner has dealt with similar material before, namely the acclaimed
romance `When Harry Met Sally'. There's wonderful assurance behind some
of the crucial scenes, even if it feels strangely minor and trifling.
What it all comes down to is a credible, amusing and affecting tale of
two `real' people negotiating themselves through a `real' situation. If
Reiner breaks any rules, it has to be the questionable finale. But the
actors do so well painting an accurate portrait of a tumultuous
separation that it actually seems to work. It's hard to pull something
like that off, folks.
If you have the hankering for a phony, artificial romance - the
happily-ever-after type - stay away from `The Story of Us'. This is the
real dirt on the study of romance.

_The_Story_of_Us_ (R) ** (out of ****)
The screen pairing of macho action star Bruce Willis and serious actress
Michelle Pfeiffer appears to be an odd one, and it is the tale of their
surprising electricity together that is the only story worth telling from
_The_Story_of_Us_--certainly not the messy contrivances of this wannabe
weepie romantic comedy-drama.
Director Rob Reiner is a proven hand at romantic comedy, as seen in
_The_American_President_ and, most famously, _When_Harry_Met_Sally..._. 
The shadow of the latter looms large over _The_Story_of_Us_, but it's not
because their stories bear any resemblance.  The "us" whose story is told
is Ben and Katie Jordan (Willis and Pfeiffer), who, after 15 years of
marriage, discover that life is far from blissful.  The film's fragmented
time structure reflects the couple's state of mind as they look back on
their union: the good times and the not-so-good ones that led them to
ponder a breakup.
With these flashbacks ranging from short to long and occurring at the
drop of a hat, _The_Story_of_Us_ is already a mess without a needless
enhancement that Reiner and scripters Alan Zweibel and Jessie Nelson
somehow felt the need to include: every so often, Ben and Katie are
separately shown sitting on a sofa, bearing their souls directly to the
camera.  It's not quite as annoying as the throwaway interview segments
with old couples that Reiner cut into _When_Harry_Met_Sally..._, but it
has the same obtrusive, distracting effect.  I'm not a terribly big fan
of voiceovers, but if their internal comments were simply heard and not
seen, the film would flow a bit more smoothly.
 And one wonders why the Jordans' marriage hasn't gone so smoothly.  The
audience isn't given a clear idea exactly why things go bad other than
some vague suspicion on Katie's part that Ben is having an affair.  There
are also a number of brief bits showing the two angrily yelling at each
other, and Willis and Pfeiffer play the angry scenes for what they're
worth, but those passages aren't terribly convincing because one usually
doesn't know why exactly what leads to each incident.  The cozier scenes,
which comfortably showcase the two stars' unforced rapport, are more
believable, and as such, the film is heavily skewed toward their happy
times and leaves little suspense as to how things turn out.
Willis and Pfeiffer are ably supported by the likes of Rita Wilson, Paul
Reiser, and Reiner himself; the standout is Wilson, who gets most of the
film's too few good laugh lines.  And that pretty much says all that
there needs to be said about _The_Story_of_Us_: a collection of
performances that are more than the creaky material deserves.

  The Story of Us (1999) 1 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Bruce Willis,
Michelle Pfeiffer, Rob Reiner and Rita Wilson. Directed by Reiner.
 I wish I could say I liked "The Story of Us." I found it enjoyable and
entertaining, but at the same time, simplistic and shallow.
 "The Story of Us" is a look at a marriage at a crossroads.
 After 15 years and two kids together, Ben and Katie Jordan (Bruce Willis
and Michelle Pfeiffer) have nothing left to say to each other.
 As one of them narrates, the silences between the pair were louder than
any arguments.
 Yet the script by Alan Zweibel and Jessie Nelson fails to really show how
Ben and Katie grew apart.
 There is a lot of talk of neither one listening to the other, of the
demands of parenthood and career creating wedges between them. And
sequences highlighting these events are shown.
 But the entire thing feels superficial and slight. Ben and Katie are
presented as two highly educated and articulate individuals, so it is
difficult to buy into the proposition that they cannot communicate.
 Directed by Rob Reiner, "The Story of Us" is sunny and perky. And that is
another of the film's problems It is bathed in a cheery glow that sabotages
the supposed dark tone of its main plot.
 For in essence, "The Story of Us" is a comedy. Thus it is difficult to
seriously accept or be concerned with the disintegration of the Jordans'
marriage.
 You instinctively know from the outset what the outcome will be.
 This is not to imply that "The Story of Us" is a bad movie. It is bubbly
and warm, almost at odds with its storyline.
 Willis and Pfeiffer are most likable. The only quibble is with Willis'
various hair pieces, which become distracting as the film bounces back and
forth through various flashbacks into the Jordans' relationship.
 As usual, when he is not playing macho he-men, Willis gives a well-rounded
performance. He allows Ben's vulnerability to show, as well as his
character's rage and frustration with his situation.
 Pfeiffer is luminous and golden. Her big, expressive eyes shine with joy
or mist with sorrow.
 Where the movie falls short is in explaining the estrangement between Ben
and Katie. There problems seem so ordinary, so minor - and their love for
each other seems so strong - that you wonder what their problems actually
are.
 An attempt to show their differences by bringing in their parents fails,
as does the glimpses of the pair with various counselors. You just cannot
take their estrangement on face value.
 A talented supporting cast, featuring Reiner and Rita Wilson, work hard to
help out Willis and Pfeiffer, but all are undone by a weak script that
makes light of the main premise.
 "The Story of Us" will satisfy fans of Willis and Pfeiffer, but that's
about it. It contains several laughs, but very little insight.

     As THE STORY OF US nears its conclusion, Katie Jordan (Michelle

camp, trying to determine whether their 15-year marriage is worth saving.
Finally, the tense meetings and what's-best-for-the-children 
rationalizations dissolve into tears as Katie rants for several minutes
about everything that has been right and wrong with their relationship,
and about the history they share.  It is a wonderfully affecting moment,
beautifully performed by Pfeiffer with all the love and frustration that
makes up a marriage.  It's a moment that can't help but bring mist to the
eyes of anyone who has known that love and those frustrations.
     It's also a moment that is a complete cheat.  Theoretically, THE
STORY OF US is the story of how easy it is, in the middle of all the white
noise and tension of everyday life, to lose track of why you fell in love
with someone in the first place.  Unfortunately, it's such a fragmented
narrative that it's just as easy for the _audience_ to lose track of why
they fell in love in the first place.  The script by Alan Zweibel and
Jessie Nelson sprinkles flashbacks through the summer of the Jordan's
separation -- a peek at their meeting and first date here, an interrupted
dalliance on the butcher block there -- but there aren't nearly enough of
them.  THE STORY OF US spends virtually all its time showing us the
relationship already in trouble, making it incredibly difficult to
appreciate what made the relationship good in the first place.  We're
asked to invest ourselves emotionally in the success or failure of the
Jordans' marriage without getting enough evidence that it should succeed.
     It's even more frustrating to realize that THE STORY OF US is so
solid at its core that it could have been wonderful.  The film is not
always a pleasant experience, showing off some extremely unfair fighting
between its protagonists and the wrenching moments when emotional damage
seems beyond repair.  Willis and Pfeiffer deftly turn their
post-separation scenes into awkward shuffles between longing and despair;
where most films treat divorce either as all-acrimony or all-indifference,
this one captures how much people want it all to work out.  But at only 92
minutes, THE STORY OF US feels bereft of context.  Somewhere on the
cutting room floor is the arc of a relationshp from affection to simple
coexistence to a blur of petty bickering.
     If only more of the so-called humor had found its way to the same
floor.  Along for comic relief are some usually reliable performers --
director Rob Reiner as Stan, Ben's best friend; Rita Wilson as Rachel, 
Katie's best friend and Stan's wife; Paul Reiser as Ben's agent -- who
wind up stuck with painfully un-funny material.  Wilson rants about how
men never change the toilet paper roll, a gag that hasn't gotten any
fresher since it was generated by bad stand-up comics 20 years ago.
Reiner waxes philosophical about how "there is no ass, just the fleshy
tops of your legs."  Reiser spends five minutes degrading an idea for a
book about Ben's grandparents, inspiring only stony silence from the
audience.  Reiner and his writers keep trying so hard to lighten the mood
they only end up breaking it, with little to show for their efforts but a
few half-hearted chuckles.
     It's easy to see the comedy as part of Reiner's attempt to create a
companion piece to his 1989 gem WHEN HARRY MET SALLY.  With its direct
addresses to the camera and hairdo-change time lapses, THE STORY OF US
does sometimes feel like WHEN HARRY LEFT SALLY.  Yet while this film was
unlikely to be as purely entertaining, it could have been far more
resonant.  Some of the individual scenes in THE STORY OF US are
heartbreaking, and a few are truly charming.  They just never quite add up
to the story of them in a way that provides real catharsis.  Just before
Katie's big emotional scene, we get a 60-second montage of hights and lows 
from a 15-year marriage.  It's easy to understand why those snippets would
move Katie to tears; after all, she lived those moments.  THE STORY OF US
could have moved us all if only we'd been allowed to live them, too.

     Okay, let's get thing straight, right up front.  If you have been
led to believe from the trailers that THE STORY OF US is a romantic
comedy, you are in for a huge shock.  This is a mean, bad, melodramatic
horror story about two bickering people.  There is little comedy to be
had in the entire thing.
     Which is a surprise.  This is the man who brought us the masterful
comedy WHEN HARRY MET SALLY.  And here we are, with people on couches,
talking to the camera about their relationship.  Same premise, right?
Ohhhhhhh noooooo.  THE STORY OF US can be summed up quite simply:  Bruce
Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer *hate* each other.  They spend two hours
yelling, cursing, crying, and pouting.  Then maybe they get back
together.  The end.
     Great film?  Uh, no.  Proof that people like Rob Reiner have too
much power.  When you find yourself spending the whole film trying to
read the wine labels in the scenes, you know you're watching something
that's going to be remembered as one of the worst films of the year.
Even the music is annoying  the same acoustic guitar-based Eric Clapton
song is played at least six times.
     Aside from a (very) few chuckles, this film is completely without
merit.  It's mean-spirited and just plain offensive.
     As usual, I saw this movie with my wife.  If our marriage can
survive THE STORY OF US, well, it can survive anything.

Oh my word, what a weird movie this is. Rob Reiner's "The Story of Us" is 
atrocious from every angle, a film with a pointless concept, evasion of its 
central issue and the most embarrassing moments of comic relief you could 
possibly imagine. Who wants to see clips of a married couple fighting for an 
hour and a half, especially when we never really understand what they're 
arguing about, we don't know how seriously we're supposed to take it, and it 
keeps getting interrupted by some of the worst-written 'wit' in entertainment 
history? Not me.
Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer star as the husband and wife, who live in 
suburbia and have two young children. He's a sitcom writer. She scripts 
crossword puzzles. They put on an act of happy families for the kids, but in 
private can no longer stand each other. Flashbacks attempt to show us the 
marriage disintegrating. Present-day scenes involving the former lovebirds 
are a combination between shouting matches and uncomfortable silence.
One my major problems with "The Story of Us" is that we're rarely actually 
informed what it is the couple are fighting about. The one scene that does 
reveal the problem at hand is completely insipid -- Willis is trying to tell 
Pfeiffer that his old apartment block has been demolished, and she's doing 
something else, and can't hear him. Aww. The rest of the time the pair are 
telling each other how bad they feel or how much they hate each other, but 
they don't say WHY. What started all the fights we see? Who knows. Reiner, 
the director, and his screenwriters, Jessie Nelson and Alan Zweibel, just 
want to show us a parade of insults.
The characters are strange people anyway. At the dinner table, they always 
play a game called "High-Low", which involves all family members taking turns 
to share their best and worst moments of every day. Do people do things like 
that in real life? I thought that kind of sentimental crap was just for 1950s 
sitcoms?
The dialogue is abysmal. People around me in the screening of the film must 
have thought I was an oddball, because I was literally wincing at it. Then 
again, maybe they knew how I felt. There is an array of dire ironic speeches 
in the movie, all of which are so transparently constructed that they come 
across as read rather than spoken. They appear when Willis and Pfeiffer are 
asking their friends for advice, and resemble obnoxious versions of the 
chatter in "Seinfeld". Typical example: "Hey, I jerked off to your secretary 
last night; is that okay, or against the rules?" "Pound away, man, it's not 
an affront to me." "Cool. Hey -- whaddya think -- is masturbating technically 
cheating, or not?"
Here's an even worse moment, involving Reiner himself, in a smug cameo 
appearance as one of Willis's friends. The two guys are walking in the park, 
talking things over. Reiner stops in the middle of a pathway, bends over and 
says something to the effect of: "You see that? That's my ass, right? Wrong. 
There is no ass. Just a fatty part at the top of my legs. There just is no 
ass! And just as there is no ass, there is no true love. It's all an 
illusion." I swear to God I'm not making this up. The movie really is this 
bad.
The ending is yet another speech, a big, loud emotional moment in which 
Pfeiffer starts screaming a revelation about why she and Willis should stay 
together. This goes against everything that has gone before, and her 
reasoning, essentially, is that even if the couple end up leading miserable 
lives, at least they won't have to face change. Was this movie made by aliens 
who wanted to satirise human irrationality? If so, I wish someone had told me 
before I went in. It would have clicked things right into context.

Christian Critic's Movie Parables - http://www.christiancritic.com
DIRECTED BY:      Rob Reiner
STARRING:         Bruce Willis, Michelle Pfeiffer, Rob Reiner, Rita
Wilson, Tim Matheson
WRITTEN BY:       Alan Zweibel, Jessie Nelson
RATED:            R for language and brief sexuality
SCRIPTURE
REFERENCES:       Ephesians 4:26, Mark 10:1-9, Ecclesiastes 9:9
Cinematic stories about an introspective journey are among the most
difficult to tell.  So, telling a story about two such journeys
simultaneously is understandably twice as hard.  Director Rob Reiner's
(THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT) latest work, THE STORY OF US, is a strange
mixture of a movie.  Combining comedy and drama, pathos with vulgar sexual
bantering, the film contains both hits and misses but ultimately doesn't
quite succeed in sustaining an emotional connection with its audience.
Ben (Bruce Willis, THE SIXTH SENSE) and Katie (Michelle Pfeiffer, THE
DEEP END OF THE OCEAN) Jordan have been married for fifteen years.  They
have produced two delightful children and the four of them appear to be
enjoying a wonderful life together.  The trouble is, whenever the kids
leave the room, the life leaves with them.  Over time, whatever kindled
the spark of this marriage has long since died out.
The movie focuses on the Jordans' attempts to present a happy facade for
their children's sake even while each is trying to figure out what went
wrong in the marriage and why.  He is more of a free spirited
individual... A fun and spontaneous kind of guy.  She, on the other hand,
feels pressed to be the responsible one of the duo.  And after fifteen
years of being the "designated driver," she resents it.
Using a series of flashbacks, voice-overs, and interviews (a la WHEN
HARRY MET SALLY), Mr. Reiner explores the effect that everyday "life" has
on a marriage relationship. The Jordans move from a happy, sexually
compatible, vibrantly fun couple (seen in the flashbacks) to a pair of
individuals who allow the minor irritations of idiosyncratic behavior to
build and fester until it reaches intolerable levels.  The film's chopped
up structure is used to try to show each character's perspective of their
failing marriage but, in so doing, it manages to distance us from
connecting with those characters.  The non-lineal time line forces us to
view the story with our heads rather than our hearts.
Bruce Willis is very good as the man who hasn't quite grown up.  His
repeated protest of "I am not a third child!" is obviously born of an oft
heard accusation.  There are times when he looses his anger at levels
incongruent for the moment but overall, his work is quite pleasing.
Michelle Pfeiffer is just wonderful.  Few actresses can portray a
deadened soul and still be interesting, but Ms. Pfeiffer does just that.
When her children leave the room, and the camera zooms in for a close up
of her, we literally can see the light go out in her eyes, leaving an
empty shell of a woman.  Her three minute monologue at the end of the film
is singly able to lift the entire project out of its mediocrity and raise
it a notch in our esteem.
Supporting the lead characters are friends played by Rob Reiner (EDTV),
Rita Wilson (SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE), Paul Reiser (MAD ABOUT YOU), and Julie
Haggarty (AIRPLANE).  They are less effective and are disappointingly used
for the sexual bantering mentioned earlier.  Ms. Wilson is seen in the
worse light, coming across as a foul-mouthed harpy.
The premise of the film is something that is important to consider.
Contrary to popular thought and hundreds of romantic comedies, love is not
something one "falls in or out of."  It is a decision one makes.  Once we
decide to love, we take certain actions because of that decision.
"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son."  John
3:16a [KJV]
"For this then is the love of God, that we keep His commandments." 1 John
5:3a [KJV]
Ben and Katie so loved their children, they took actions to hide the fact
that they were considering separation and divorce.  Yet they did not take
the proper action needed to strengthen their own relationship, choosing
instead to suffer silently through the minuscule annoyances experienced
when living with another person.  The mistake they made (and a mistake
many couples make) was to let the little issues go by unresolved.  When we
do that, we aren't building bridges, we're building wedges.  Build a big
enough wedge, and the strongest love won't be able to hold a relationship
together.

THE STORY OF US (M).  
(Castle Rock/Universal/UIP)
Director: Rob Reiner
Stars: Bruce Willis, Michelle Pfeiffer, Rob Reiner, Rita Wilson, Julie
Hagerty, Paul Reiser (uncredited), Tim Matheson, Jake Sandvig, Colleen
Rennison, Jayne Meadows, Tom Poston, Betty White, Red Buttons
Running time: 92 minutes. 
Cynics would suggest that Bruce Willis stick to doing what he
does best - saving the world with all guns blazing - and leave acting
to more qualified thespians.  But Willis has, in the past, delivered
some quite surprisingly rich and subtle performances that have
demonstrated more to his range than a smirk and a quick way with the
one-liners - the troubled Vietnam vet in In Country, the abusive
husband of Mortal Thoughts, the faded boxer in the cult classic Pulp
Fiction.  The runaway box office success of both Armageddon and The
Sixth Sense has given Willis the clout to again try his hand at
serious acting, and damn what his fans or the studios want.
While Breakfast Of Champions has not fared well at the US box
office and is likely to disappear straight to video here, his other
uncharacteristic venture is far more enjoyable.
The Story Of Us explores a marriage headed for the rocks after
fifteen years.  Willis plays writer Ben Jordan, while Michelle
Pfeiffer plays his wife Katie, who briefly separate and reassess their
relationship while their two kids are away at summer camp for a month.
While their kids are around the two try hard to present an outwardly
happy facade, but when alone they either bicker or descend into
silence.  Rather than comfortable, these silences are oppressive,
shaped by tension and the weight of memories, both good and bad.
Their friends (Rob Reiner, Rita Wilson, Julie Hagerty, and an
uncredited Paul Reiser) offer well meaning advice.  Eventually, Ben
and Katie learn that no marriage is perfect, and that the key to
establishing a lasting relationship is compromise.
Written by Alan Zweibel (Dragnet, etc) and Jessie Nelson
(Corrina, Corrina, etc), The Story Of Us is a genial enough romantic
comedy that puts the ideal of marriage under a microscope.  This is
somewhat familiar territory, having been explored previously in films
as diverse as War Of The Roses, Divorce American Style, He Said, She
Said, and the twee The Last Married Couple In America, etc.  While it
would be easy to be cynical about the whole concept of marriage today,
the film is surprisingly optimistic, warm and laced with some winning
humour.
Director Reiner (When Harry Met Sally, etc) is a dab hand at
romantic comedies, and handles the material efficiently enough,
although there are a few scenes that are badly misjudged.  However,
the montage sequences that encapsulate fifteen years of highs and lows
in about fifteen seconds are quite effective.
Willis seems quite comfortable playing largely against type,
and his performance is solid, revealing several layers to his
character.  However, the scenes in which he is required to cry are not
convincing at all.  At the time he was filming The Story Of Us, Willis
was undergoing his highly publicised split from Demi Moore, and one
can only guess at the psychological insights and emotional baggage
that he brought to the role.  Pfeiffer is a veteran of playing
romantic leads (One Fine Day, etc), and one would have expected a
lighter, more assured and convincing performance from her.  The
biggest problem is that they never quite gel as a couple, and their
obvious mismatch more often than not works against the movie.
Nonetheless, The Story Of Us is an entertaining enough
romantic comedy, and, at a rather brisk 90 minutes, never quite
outstays its welcome.

WHEN HARRY MET SALLY (10/10) is one of my favorite movies of all-time. This
film comes from the director of that film and features the trials and
tribulations of a married couple after a 15-year run. Some might say that
it's the continuation of WHEN HARRY..., others, like myself, would say that
it's a rough draft of an interesting story featuring some great acting, but
ultimately burdened by too many copycat (And less successful) moments from
the former film (See Little Known Facts).
PLOT:
A married couple, with 15 years and two kids under their belts, suddenly
find themselves caught in a state of indecision on whether or not to
continue their relationship. You see, they have recently come to realize
that their initial love for one another has faded over the years, and that
all they seem to be left with are many differences of opinion. Will they
break up or keep going?
CRITIQUE:
Decent film featuring great performances by Pfeiffer and Willis, an
interesting story about a couple going through some rough waters in the
later years of their marriage, but too many "written" flat jokes by the side
characters, an easy ending and an annoying soundtrack placed this film on an
overall plate of mediocrity for me. Okay, so I am also a little biased
because I thought there were way too many blatant photocopied moments from
the successful WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, but even with that aside, this film
just seemed to dissolve into too many bickering arguments at certain points,
with moments of phony conversations with their "witty" friends just slowing
the whole process down further. I think I would have enjoyed this film so
much more, if it had focused more on the relationship between Willis and
Pfeiffer.
Both actors were at the top of their game in this film with many touching
and funny moments between them and their kids. I thought the flashback
sequences used in the film were effective and useful in driving us closer
into the characters, and appreciated the numerous relationship up-and-down
moments to which many people surely were be able to relate. I did find that
there was a little too much emphasis on the screaming/shouting variety of
scenes, as opposed to more of the lighter moments, but I suppose that was
the whole point of the film, you know, to show the "darker" side of a
marriage. All in all, I think that most people who have been in
relationships should be able to relate to several disagreements from this
film, certainly the core reasons behind the conflicts, if not the actual
circumstances themselves. Ultimately the film didn't blow me away with any
of its rehashed situations, and led me astray with the contrived "witty"
banter of their friends. Dramatically, I would recommend it higher, but the
comedic low-points should keep you away if you're looking for that sort of
escape. Either way, rent WHEN HARRY MET SALLY and thank me in the morning.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Bruce Willis was also going through his own divorce with wife of ten years,
Demi Moore, during the filming of this movie.
Having seen WHEN HARRY MET SALLY over thirty times, it was all too easy for
me to notice the blatant similarities between these two films. Admittedly,
many of these moments may show up in other films as well, but appreciating
the fact that both of these movies were directed by the same man, makes me
wonder if they were coincidences at all. Some might just call it laziness.
Please DO NOT read any further if you do not want to ruin any plot points
for yourself. SPOILERS AHEAD!
Similar scenes between the superior WHEN HARRY MET SALLY and THE STORY OF
US:
1. A scene featuring one of the main stars making a spectacle of themselves
in a restaurant (Willis in this film/Ryan in WHMS).
2. A cute scene featuring a woman wearing a piff helmet (Pfeiffer in this
film/Ryan in WHMS).
3. A meeting of a man and a woman looking for books in a bookstore (Pfeiffer
in this film/Ryan in WHMS).
4. A scene featuring one of the main stars fast-walking with their friend
and discussing their love-life (Pfeiffer in this case/Crystal in WHMS).
5. Both films feature the main couple having best friends who also happen to
be married to one another (Reiner & Wilson in this case/Carrie Fisher &
Bruno Kirby in WHMS).
6. Breakthrough final scene features a reconciliation by the way of one of
the characters breaking down and admitting their love for the other, while
describing all of the little endearing idiosyncrasies in the other's
behavior (Pfeiffer in this one/Crystal in WHMS).
7. Final scene features couple talking directly to the camera about their
future (Pfeiffer & Willis in this film/Ryan and Crystal in WHMS).

Susan Granger's review of "The Story of Us" (Universal Pictures)
Instead of the usual vows, perhaps the marriage ceremony should
include the question: "Do you have any idea how difficult this is
going to be?" Because that's what intrigued filmmaker Rob Reiner to
wonder: Can any couple with two kids survive together for 15 years?
Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer play a suburban dad-and-mom whose
constant quarrels have made them decide on a trial separation while
their kids are in summer camp. As they fumble through the nitty-gritty
of living apart, flashbacks reveal what abrasive episodes led up to
their edgy estrangement. Basically, she's a crossword-puzzle creator
who's a highly organized, compulsive perfectionist while he's a
laid-back, playful writer who flourishes in an unstructured
existence. (One is tempted to interpret Willis' obviously raw hurt as
a spillover from his real-life divorce from Demi Moore.) Writers Alan
Zweibel and Jessie Nelson re-visit bittersweet marital territory
that's been explored many times before, stressing that any successful
relationship is a work-in-progress. One winces for the obvious hair
pieces and/or transplants Willis feels compelled to wear, while
Pfeiffer is so breathtakingly beautiful that her efforts to be a plain
housewife are pathetic. And when Jayne Meadows, Tom Poston, Betty
White, and Red Buttons pop up as the in-laws, you're acutely aware
that these are aging stars playing cameos.  Nevertheless, Reiner's
slickly inventive direction and the sheer charm and likeability of
Willis and Pfeiffer prevail, set to the tune of Eric Clapton's guitar
strumming "I'm Sorry." On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The
Story of Us" is a shaky, sentimental 6. It's "When Harry Met Sally" -
15 years later - with "best friend" Rita Wilson outrageously
attempting to update the orgasm-in-a-deli scene.

For over 90 minutes, The Story of Us innocuously runs through the 
projector. At film's end, the audience is not shocked. There are no 
great revelations, massive special effects or even unforgettable 
moments. That is, however, not to say that The Story of Us limps along, 
drags, or even approaches boredom. The movie is just a sweet and 
poignant work that is not today's typical Hollywood fare.
Ben (Bruce Willis) and Kate Jordan (Michelle Pfeiffer) have been married 
for 15 years and seem to be the ordinary couple. They have two kids, 
they each have their own job and close friends. But something has 
happened, and after they drop their children off for camp one summer, 
they each go home- Kate to the house and Ben to an apartment. The 
tagline on the film is "Can a marriage survive 15 years of marriage?" 
Evidently not. But over the course of the 8 week summer, Ben and Kate 
will discover if a separation can survive 8 weeks of separation.
Hall of fame singer, songwriter and guitarist Eric Clapton is credited 
with the music for this film. That is a little deceiving. Clapton did 
perform all the original music; the movie just neglects to mention that 
that entails all of one song. Good as it may be, that single track is 
overplayed to a point of annoyance, accompanying almost all of the 
film's montages. I only noted one other vocal performance, and it was 
indeed by Clapton. The song was "Wonderful Tonight," which I can assure 
you was not written for this production.
Willis and Pfeiffer are both at their best in this film. She is near 
perfect for her role, and he seems to have had no trouble adjusting from 
the role of "Oil drilling space hero" in last summer's Armageddon to 
"hopeless romantic" in this picture. A strong supporting cast fills the 
other roles in this predominately two person movie. Rita Wilson, Paul 
Reiser and Rob Reiner are all a pleasure to watch as the closest 
confidants of the separated couple. Also, Tim Matheson rather nicely 
portrays a divorced parent who Kate begins to date.
The Story of Us is not a typical film. Almost every movie these days has 
a side plot involving either a married couple or a close boyfriend and 
girlfriend. But those are extra scenes meant to attract female audiences 
and make certain films considered "date movies." The Story of Us does 
just the opposite. It even takes the reverse one step further. Rather 
than employing a side plot, the movie stays focused and never ventures 
astray from Ben and Kate's family. There was a time when singular plot 
films like this were normal. But today it is a rarity, and when strict 
one-plotters (especially romances) romances do surface, it is not often 
that they are of this quality.
---Editorial Criticism of the Motion Picture Association of America 
(MPAA)---
The MPAA rated The Story of Us "R". That means that children under the 
age of 17 cannot see this film, unless accompanied by a parent or 
guardian. The MPAA also rated Fight Club, the other major film opening 
the week of October 15, "R". Here is a comparison of the two films' 
offenses:
The MPAA and its president, Jack Valenti, seem to believe that giving an 
identical warning to parents about these films will suffice. That's 
funny, because my parents always told me that sex and family were normal 
and okay things in life. I guess they skipped the parts about violence 
and destruction.

1.Why I Saw This Movie. The able and smart main film-critic of this 
country's best newspaper, unlike many other reviewers, is especially 
kind to movies. Yet this person's write-up on The Story of Us was so 
unusually scathing that it piqued my curiosity.
2. Whom I Saw It With.  A substantial audience. They seemed to like 
it, laughed often. I did too, but much less.
3. What Does The Film Remind Me Of. The same director's When Harry 
Met Sally (1989) --in reverse. Call it When Ben and Katie Separated 
After 15 Years of Marriage and Two Kids. But this wouldn't fit the 
marquee.
4. What I Learned About Bruce Willis. He is left-handed, bald and 
uses terrible hairpieces. He plays a writer, but I didn't figure out 
precisely what he writes. More importantly, he can not only do action 
flicks but he can also act.
5. What I Found Out About Michelle Pfeiffer. She is 42, lovely as 
ever, still at the very top of the list of appealing stars. Her eyes 
continue to fascinate me by their beauty and the oddity than they are 
always ever so slightly bloodshot. This reinforces their power to 
suggest sorrow.  Here Pfeiffer is a professional crossword-puzzle 
editor, undoubtedly a most instructive job.
6. How Her  Profession Is Worked Into The Movie. Just a little. On 
the other hand, as a working Mom she has a normally frantic life.
7. What  Genre The Film Belongs To.  The romantic comedy. (You know 
even before you get your ticket that there will be a happy ending. It 
takes the form of a long speech by Pfeiffer, is phony , and too 
artificially emotional for the usually cool Michelle). The real 
sub-genre is Comedies of Remarriage. Couples split for whatever 
reason but get back together. Some great old movies in this group are 
My Girl Friday, My Favorite Wife, the Hitchcock rarity (not a 
thriller) Mr and Mrs Smith.
The couple hide their ever-increasing differences, gripes and other 
Bad Things from their teen-age children so as not to upset them. 
Which is ridiculous as the presumably intelligent kids ought (but 
have not?) seen or sensed their parents' problems. The separation 
starts after the parents have taken the children to summer camp. 
Willis moves to an hotel, then an apartment.  Pfeiffer enters, by 
chance, into a relationship with a divorced family acquaintance. 
Honor is Safe. Supposedly nothing happenes between this new  twosome, 
beyond cooking beautiful Thai food together. Come on!
A familiar yet realistic touch. When the man finds out that the 
couple has split up, he expresses his strong sorrow then makes an 
immediate pass. But other sections are over the top: a sequence of 
Willis and a close friend (played by director Rob Reiner) 
philosophizing about couples is forced;  a sequence where Willis, 
Reiner and the latter's wife (Rita Wilson) go to a posh restaurant 
and Willis starts shouting out his problems is ham-fisted; a scene 
where Willis tells pal Dave (Paul Reiser, unusually sufferable) that 
he wants to write a book about his (Willis's) grandmother is gauchely 
worked into the story.
The story is related in bits, with a profusion of flashbacks, 
flashforwards, flashsideways, and with the spouses addressing 
directly the camera. One of the flahsbacks, a trip to romantic Venice 
(in Italy, not California) in order to rekindle the old passion and 
make them an "us" again, is rather amusing Especially when they meet 
an older couple of obnoxious, loud and jocular tourists from 
Cleveland. But the return home is artificially made into an instant 
fight. There are, too, three flashbacks to shrinks/marriage 
counselors, all three forced.
The flick travels in time non-stop. It uses sitcom humor with 
sitcom-ish fragmented action, the only difference being the 
uncensored language. There is brio, albeit overdone, in a raucous 
restaurant sequence in which Pfeiffer and her best friends Julie 
Hagerty and Rita Wilson discuss husbands and sex. This is 
mechanically paralleled (though also lively ) in a restaurant meeting 
of Willis, Reiser and Reiner who discuss  wives and women. Both have 
some humor, plus a lot of four-letter and sexual anatomy descriptions 
by Rita Wilson.
If all this sounds like a sloppy script, it is. Curiously, however, 
the picture does not feel irritating, dull or overlong -- at least 
not until about minute 80 (out of 92).

Rob Reiner's THE STORY OF US, starring Bruce Willis and Michelle
Pfeiffer, could have been more aptly titled SCREAM were that name not
already taken.  Opening opposite FIGHT CLUB, it feels the more violent
of the two, even if the combatants in THE STORY OF US confine their
weapons to shouting matches.  (You may want to bring earplugs, these two
angry spouses can get awfully loud.)
Watching these two attractive actors verbally slug it out is about as
much fun as experiencing your own divorce.  With its choppy editing, the
film's images fly by like a music video, destroying the effect of many
scenes which on their own contain little gems of truth.
When we meet Ben and Katie Jordan (Willis and Pfeiffer), they are
visiting their respective analysts.  The story of their arguments is
frequently interrupted -- actually the whole movie feels like one long
interruption -- by visits to various analysts and marriage counselors.
Although the story reportedly concerns the entirety of a marriage, in
reality it focuses on the end game, as their marriage is torn to shreds.
They have two amazingly well adjusted teenagers, who are somehow
oblivious to their parents' difficulties.  Since neither child has a
hearing problem, this becomes very hard to believe.  Perhaps one of the
secrets is that the kids appear to spend all summer, every summer, at
camp.
Between his film's emotional outbursts, director Reiner, working from a
script by Alan Zweibel and Jessie Nelson, tosses the audience the
opportunity for a few cheap laughs.  They might be laughs, if we were in
the mood.  There's nothing wrong, of course, with downer pictures like
this one, assuming the story has honesty and insight, something sorely
lacking in this picture full of missed opportunities.
"The Ten Commandments were probably easier to stick to when we all died
at 35," Dave (Paul Reiser) tells Ben over lunch.  Another example of the
film's message-based humor comes from Stan (Reiner).  "Love is just
lust, and lust fades," Stan explains to Ben.
Ben and Katie don't have many problems other than their personalities,
which ignite periodically in huge, unprovoked explosions.  The story
offers few insights into why they flare up like rockets at each other.
The only thing that seems clear is that the only time they truly like
each other is when they are apart.
After an hour and a half of misery, admittedly interlaced with memories
of some of their good times, the story in the last few minutes has the
characters make an abrupt change.  Completely out of left field, Reiner
sticks on a feel-good ending that rings completely false.  Admittedly,
he telegraphs this in the first scene, but the body of the movie argues
against the ending's huge copout.  It feels like an ending devised by a
test group who couldn't stand what was happening and demanded that the
stars relent in the end.
THE STORY OF US runs 1:32.  It is rated R for language and brief
sexuality and would be acceptable for teenagers.

Rob Reiner has done the unfathomable: The accomplished director has
actually made a film as bad as his previous career low North.  With The
Story of Us, Meathead blends top Hollywood talent with an irritating
script to deliver a slow, torturously towering achievement in bad
filmmaking.  Not coincidentally, North author Alan Zweibel created this
story as well.
The film doesn't immediately seem to annoy, opening with a monologue
from Ben Jordan (Bruce Willis, The Sixth Sense) as he explains his idea
of true love.  Something about being married for sixty years and dying
days apart from one another; I don't know.  The film then launches into
present day, where Ben and his wife of fifteen years, Katie (Michelle
Pfeiffer, The Deep End of the Ocean), share a seemingly happy dinner
with their two children.  They play a game called "High/Low," where each
takes a turn describing their best and worst moments of the day.  It
seems like the perfect family, with white, toothy smiles all around.
Once the children excuse themselves, we eventually learn that it's all a
façade.  Ben and Katie's marriage has been rotting from the inside for
several years and, despite the approach of their anniversary, the two
plan to separate once they ship the unsuspecting kids off to summer
camp.
Katie explains to the camera  in her own monologue  why she feels her
marriage to Ben is failing, drawing a strange analogy between him and
the children's book Harold & the Purple Crayon.  I'm still not sure I
understand what she was talking about.  But we all know the real reason
Katie is unhappy.  I've seen the uncut version of Color of Night.  The
girl just isn't satisfied, if you know what I mean.
Anyway, the kids go to camp, Ben moves into a hotel, and through a
never-ending string of flashbacks we see how the two met and how things
got to the point of dissolution.  We glimpse a flashback montage of
bedroom fights.  We see flashbacks of happier days.  We view another
montage of hapless marriage counselor flashbacks.  As if the flashbacks
weren't enough, Reiner peppers the film with more monologues than
Macbeth.  It's almost like the guy is just scared to make a simple film
in the present time.
To make matters worse, we are also introduced to Ben and Katie's friends
as each meets their gender-specific cronies for lunch.  He tolerates his
two pals (Reiner and Paul Reiser) as they talk loudly about
masturbation, colon exams and cyber-sex.  She is treated to her chums
(Rita Wilson and Julie Hagerty) bitching about their husbands without
taking a second to either breathe or eat.  Ben and Katie just sit and
watch, amazed that so little has changed since the times of cavemen.
And can I just say how annoying Mrs. Tom Hanks is? Paul Reiser, too.
And why does Rob Reiner have to talk about his ass in every scene?  Does
he think he's Garry Shandling?  Writer Zweibel was the co-creator of
It's Garry Shandling's Show, so maybe he's the one with the ass
infatuation.
After two weeks, Ben and Katie can't stand being apart from each other
and make up excuses to call one another.  Thanks to some dry-cleaning
they meet for dinner, Ben as nervous as a pimply teen picking up his
prom date, while Katie glows like an 11-year-old that just got her first
kiss.  Things go well, but the evening is ruined in the film's only
legitimate comedic sequence.  I won't ruin it, but I will say that it
involves a bed, Red Buttons and Steve Allen's loudmouth wife.
If you have seen the film's trailer, you already know that the film is
chock full of melodramatic acoustic guitar playing.  It's fitting for a
movie featuring two idiots that think if they just touch each other's
feet in bed, all of their marital problems will be magically solved.
Willis, who was so wonderful in The Sixth Sense, reminds us how horrible
he was in the little-seen Breakfast of Champions, no doubt using his own
failed marriage as fodder for his celluloid screaming.  Pfeiffer, who
hasn't been in a blockbuster since she wore a cat-suit, looks pretty and
gets to have a bunch of different hairstyles because of the incessant
flashbacks.
Exiting the theater after a screening of this film, I overheard one
knucklehead saying that she didn't care for the language but was "happy
with the way everything ended," as if there was any doubt that they
would get back together.  I'm just glad they were able to do it in under
100 minutes.  I'm sure if the film went five minutes longer, Ben and
Katie would be history.
Potential viewers should just stay home and argue.  It's a lot cheaper.
1:35  R for language and brief sexuality

        On one level, "The Story of Us" plays like one of those shallow
"dramedies" that turn up regularly on the Lifetime network. Most of the
pain it exposes is surface level, the conflicts often feel manufactured
and the comic elements writers Alan Zweibel and Jessie Nelson have
shoehorned into their script generally operate at cross-purposes with
the overall theme of the film.
 Yet somehow the movie comes close to hitting its mark
nonetheless. That's largely due to the combined star power of Michelle
Pfeiffer and Bruce Willis, and also to some genuinely evocative patches
in Zweibel and Nelson's screenplay. Every time "Story" wanders
perilously close to the border of soap opera, the authors steer it back
on course.
 Although the subject matter -- an upper-middle-class couple
drifting straight for the rocks -- inspires memories of such searing
break-up dramas as Diane Keaton and Albert Finney's "Shoot the Moon" or
the classic "Two For the Road" with Finney and Audrey Hepburn, the
glossy execution of "Story" recalls last Christmas' "Stepmom," another
attempt to address a difficult subject in a crowdpleasing manner.
"Stepmom" was a bit more effective than this film because it focused
mostly on the young woman (Julia Roberts) trying to find her place in
her husband's family and the ex-wife (Susan Sarandon) struggling to hold
on to a world she was no longer intimately a part of.
 "Story" is more scattershot, and while we may root for Kate
(Pfeiffer) and Ben (Willis) Jordan to overcome their differences and
rekindle that old flame, we'd be cheering more enthusiastically if the
movie had let us get a better sense of their history together. What it
presents instead are flashes of events major and minor, from the time
Ben and Kate tried to get it on on the kitchen counter to the death of
their son's goldfish.
 The rest of the movie shifts a bit uneasily between some nasty
marital arguments and several quirky discussions between Kate and Ben
and their friends, played by comedians such as Paul Reiser, Rita Wilson
(who gets to do a reprise of her weeping fit from "Sleepless in
Seattle"), Julie Hagerty and Reiner himself. A lot of this talk is
undeniably amusing ("the Ten Commandments were probably a lot easier to
stick to when you dropped dead at 35," Reiser's character moans), but it
also serves to severely dilutes whatever impact the main story might
have. The jokey segments tend to stop the picture cold, often just as
it's building some momentum.
 The gimmick of having characters speak directly to the audience
is currently being done to death both in movies and on TV, but it works
surprisingly well here, as Ben and Kate's confessions turn out to be
among the film's strongest bits. At one point, Kate compares her
relationship with her husband to the children's book "Harold and the
Purple Crayon," explaining that Harold was always determined to create
his own perfect environment. "When one person is always drawing the
world the way they want it to be, the other person has to draw the world
the way it is," she sighes, "which is probably why they never wrote a
book about Harold's wife."
 There's also a certain poignancy in Ben and Kate's careful
conversations about whether or not their kids are "O.K.," as well as in
the borderline ridiculous excuses they make for calling each other
during a period of separation.
 The movie's ultimate trump card, however, is a breathless,
delirious monologue Kate delivers near the end. It's a moment that might
have been insufferable in the hands of a less skilled actress, but
Pfeiffer makes the words ring with hurt, humor and pure emotion. "The
Story of Us" has more than its share of aggravating bits and empty
scenes, but the finale manages to tip the scales in its favor. James
