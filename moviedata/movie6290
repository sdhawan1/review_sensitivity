In what circumstance would you deem someone lucky to have been involved in
the production of the critically panned GODZILLA (6/10)? When the
circumstance is such that you are the second unit director on said project,
and big-time movie director Roland Emmerich decides to take a chance on you
in his next producing gig, which ultimately turns into this movie.
PLOT:
A virtual reality program in which one could consciously transport oneself
into another universe is at the heart of this story that begins with the
murder of the man who invented the simulation itself. When one of his prime
employees is accused of the man's murder, he must go inside the machine
himself, in order to find out who really killed his boss and how he ended up
on the most wanted list.
CRITIQUE:
It is very appropriate that the famous quote of "I think, therefore I am"
precedes this film's credit run, since "thinking" is the primary exercise to
which this movie will have you subscribe. To a certain extent, it is quite
unfortunate that this "virtual-reality" film comes on the heels of other
similarly themed ones such as THE MATRIX (7.5/10), eXistenZ (7.5/10) and
DARK CITY (9/10), since we cannot help but compare it to the others, and
depreciate from its originality which is diluted due to its repetitive
ideas. Having said that, I still did enjoy most of this film which actually
starts off feeling more like a BACK TO THE FUTURE movie than anything else.
Its grainy, vintage look also appealed to me, as did the murder mystery that
absorbed its first half.
Unfortunately for its creators, the film does seem to lose ground during its
second half, when everyone and their grandma seems to be moving from one
parallel universe to the other (One dude walked out of our screening
mumbling something about "not knowing what was real anymore"). The only
scene that confused me was the final one which did not seem to make sense to
me according to the explanations that had preceded it before, but alas, I
might've missed something. The actors were all pretty good with Mol and
D'Onofrio pulling off fine dual roles, and newcomer Craig Bierko (new to
me!) punching in his best poor man's George Clooney imitation (Nice 'burns,
tough guy!). All in all, the movie had enough mood and mystery to spark my
initial interest, enough plot to keep it going in the midsection, but
ultimately too similar in story to many of the better films specified
earlier to register in my mind as anything more than a virtual-noir sci-fi
leftover plate. By the way, if it's action or special effects you're looking
for, this film is not for you! It contains neither of the two, but does play
many a mindgame with your head, if that's your vibe.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
This film is based on the book "Simulacron 3" written by Daniel Galouye.
Producer Ute Emmerich is director/producer Roland Emmerich's sister.

          Since movies, on the average, take a year - from the
beginning of filming to theatrical debut - it's interesting that three
similar glitzy, high-tech, virtual reality thrillers - "The Matrix,"
"eXistenZ" and this - overlapped. Loosely based on Daniel Galouye's
'60s sci-fi novel "Simulacron 3," the idea revolves around a computer
that enables its user to time-travel. Only a story never develops from
the original concept of juxtaposing sepia-toned Los Angeles in 1937
with the full-color reality of the present time. Blame it on director
Josef Rusnak's and Ravel Centeno-Rodriguez' underwritten screenplay,
riddled with wooden dialogue.  Computer visionary Armin Mueller-Stahl
is the first to download time-travel but he runs into foul play, which
brings his over-wrought assistant, Craig Bierko, to the rescue. Then,
when more trouble ensues, technie Vincent D'Onofrio goes back in time
too. All three encounter lovely femme fatale Gretchen Mol, who is
trying to pass herself off as Mueller-Stahl's daughter. Or is she a
check-out girl at a local grocery store? That's a question bothering
Dennis Haysbert, a detective. The visually stylish, art deco
atmosphere in the somber, cavernous simulated world is appealing but
it's not enough to sustain interest as the plot evaporates.  Craig
Bierko seems like a poor man's Alex Baldwin, complete with a two-day
beard growth, while Gretchen Mol works hard at evoking Marilyn Monroe
but she's weak. Neither displays an ounce of screen charisma in this
ultimate bad trip. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The
Thirteenth Floor" is a self-destructing 3. Cyberspace confusion 3D
Existential poppycock.

     It would be easier -- and kinder -- to think of THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR
as a simple case of bad timing.  After all, this is the fourth film in
three months in which characters begin to doubt the nature of their
reality, following THE MATRIX, eXistenZ and OPEN YOUR EYES.  That much
head-tripping could be wearying under the best of circumstances, and THE
THIRTEENTH FLOOR is far from the best of circumstances.  This is genre
film-making at its most superficially plot-driven, compounding its shallow
characterizations with a ridiculous degree of self-importance.
     The story opens with the murder of Hannon Fuller (Armin
Mueller-Stahl), a software engineer who has created a fully functional
simulated computer world modeled after 1937 Los Angeles, complete with
digital characters possessing a sense of self.  One prime suspect is
Fuller's partner Douglas Hall (Craig Bierko), who stands to profit most
from Fuller's death and can't remember where he was at the time of the
murder...or how bloody clothing ended up in his laundry.  When he learns
that Fuller left a message for him inside the simulation, Hall "jacks in"
to the life of one of the simulation characters, and discovers that
another one of the characters (Vincent D'Onfrio) has learned that his
world isn't real.  As Hall continues to investigate, he begins to suspect
that there is more to his own reality than meets the eye.
     There's nothing remarkably innovative about the film's premise at
this point, but director/co-writer Josef Rusnak can't be faulted for
bringing up the rear of the virtual reality parade.  He can certainly be
faulted, however, for the way he approached that premise.  THE THIRTEENTH
FLOOR apparently wants Hall's existential crisis to matter, yet the film
never gives us enough background to understand Hall, his friendship with
Fuller, or any of his anxieties.  It often appears that key scenes of
character development have been edited out and replaced by expository
dialogue, leaving little but essential plot-advancing events and Craig
Bierko's dead-eyed performance.  That makes it virtually impossible for
the story to develop any depth, or for Hall's romance with a mysterious
woman (Gretchen Mol) to be anything but functional.  When the film's real
"villain" shows up for the first time with about 15 minutes left, it's
obvious that Rusnak's primary goal is moving the story, character
development be hanged.
     A science-fiction thriller can work, of course, without much profound
commentary on the human condition; heaven knows THE MATRIX wasn't out to
score philosophical brownie points.  THE MATRIX also didn't make the
mistake of pretending to be anything more than it was, treating its
subject matter with a playful, giddy energy.  THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR is one
of those bleak, somber exercises in which the gloom is meant to suggest
significance but instead makes it even more impossible to enjoy the story.
On only one occasion, involving the confusion of Fuller's simulation
counterpart, does THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR aspire to some kind of
understanding.  Most of the time it's a plodding bore, grinding through
the plot as though its themes were medicinally good for you instead of the
stuff of paperback novels.
     I suppose it's praiseworthy that THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR does work at
providing clues for its plot twists instead of dropping them in your lap.
Mueller-Stahl and D'Onofrio are solid in their dual roles, almost making
up for the blank attractiveness of Mol and Bierko.  The film certainly
achieves the atmosphere it's aiming for; unfortunately, that atmosphere
provides neither entertainment nor insight.  Even if you're prepared to
overlook the inevitable head-scratching convolutions of plot, you're not
likely to care about where they're taking you.  I can imagine an alternate
reality in which film-makers have figured out there's nothing more to say
about alternate realities, at least for the time being.  It must be a
better place than this.

What a difference time can make. Time is an important factor with The
Thirteenth Floor. And it is with time that The Thirteenth Floor fails. The
film runs too long and was released too late. These aren't its only
failings though.
On the 13th floor of some corporate building, a project is being tested.
This ultra-secret and ambitious project allows for people to jack into a
computer-generated world. Are the people in the computer-generated world
are so real that they could come out and hurt someone in the "real" world?
The world generated by the computer is of Los Angeles around 1937.
The project is headed by Hammond (Armin Mueller-Stahl) Fuller and his right
hand man Douglas (Craig Bierko) Hall. When someone murders Fuller, an LAPD
detective, McBain (Dennis Haysbert) suspects that Hall is the murderer.
Hall has everything to gain from the death of Fuller, including the whole
company that Fuller started. But, things get more complicated as Fuller's
daughter Jane (Getchen Mol) arrives in town to take control of the company.
The movie flips between the current time, which isn't specified, but I take
it to be 1999, and the computer-generated 1937. And it is in these trips
back and forth that The Thirteenth Floor makes its first time based error.
The trips do not really serve much purpose, some of the travel does reveal
information, but for the most part the travel is unneeded.
The murder mystery that is at the heart of the movie is flat. The romance
that supposedly exists between Douglas and Jane fizzles. And thrill in the
movie is rather tame. There are also a few attempts at some action
sequences, but those are rather dull also.
The plot of the film is so meticulously setup that at about an hour into
the film I was able to correctly predict how the film was going to end. The
script by Josef Rusnak and Ravel Centeno-Rodriguez contain some good ideas,
but all have already been covered and done by the more exciting and
thrilling The Matrix. And because the ideas have been done before and done
better, this is where The Thirteenth Floor makes its second time based
error. The release time of The Thirteenth Floor was too late. While The
Matrix is still doing well in the theatres, why would anyone go to see the
mediocre at best The Thirteenth Floor?
The movie comes out of the production house of Roland Emmerich and Dean
Devlin, the two guys who brought us Universal Soldier, Stargate,
Independence Day, and Godzilla. Some may argue that I should have known
better. For those of you who have read my Independence Day and Godzilla
reviews, you know that I'm not a big of fan of anything that comes from
Emmerich and Devlin. (For the record though, I did enjoy Stargate). So, why
would I go see The Thirteenth Floor? One reason only: Getchen Mol.
Mol who didn't get enough to do in Rounders also gets relegated to doing
not much in The Thirteenth Floor. That's too bad because I think that she's
got great talent. If only someone in Hollywood will give her something
worthwhile to work with. Mueller-Stahl is also not given enough material to
work with. He is the best actor in this film and that's a waste of talent.
Haysbert goes over-the-top with his portrayal of Detective McBain and it
goes to his advantage. His McBain is one of the most memorable characters
of the film because of Haysbert's performance.
As for the lead actor in the film, Bierko, that is one of the failings of
the film. Bierko, who does a mean imitation of George Clooney, is bland and
ineffective in his role. He has two types of onscreen emotions, angry or
confused. Because Bierko is the point of view of the film, him being the
weak link is a point against the film.
The one thing that I loved about the film is the cinematography. When you
look at the film you can tell that the cinematographer, Wedigo von
Schultzendorff, spent a lot of time with director, Josef Rusnak, planning
out the look of the film. The distinct look of the 1937 world compared to
the 1999 world is wonderful. The 1937 world is brown and colorless, it is
also not a perfect recreation of the 1937 Los Angeles, but one of which
Fuller remembers. The 1999 world is bluish-green and a bit more futurist
looking than being set in the 1990s. Kudos to von Schultzendorff for a
beautiful looking film.
Had The Thirteenth Floor been a shorter film and had been released a year
or two earlier, it would be a film to recommend. But, at this point, what
the film presents has been done and has been done better and there is
nothing to recommend about this film. Should you see The Thirteenth Floor?
No, don't see on the big screen nor on video for a good movie about
alternate computer-generated realities, for that watch The Matrix. But, if
you like Gretchen Mol or want to see some beautiful looking cinematography,
then check out The Thirteenth Floor on video.

        The Thirteenth Floor is a bland, obligatory exercise in genre
film-making.  If I hadn't recently watched The Matrix and Open Your Eyes
-- both of which are similar but far superior -- I might have been a
little nicer to this picture.  Craig Bierko makes an adequate hero as
Douglas Hall, the rich co-creator of a perfect human world simulation
who is suddenly blamed for the murder of his boss (Armin
Mueller-Stahl).  Everything that was subtle and smart about the
previously mentioned films is battered over our heads in this one, and
characters stare at each other for maddeningly-long periods of time and
refuse to communicate on any realistic level.  The acting is okay, but
the film suffers from every logical flaw one could think of, and
features a script (co-penned by director Josef Rusnak) loaded with
cliches and stock characters.  There are individual scenes and ideas
that work -- I like the thought of a sentient computer program -- but
none of the film's strengths are recognized to any meaningful degree. 
Producer Roland Emmerich, based on this and his previous directorial
efforts, seems hell-bent on bringing us the ultimate standard in
mediocre science-fiction.

THIRTEENTH FLOOR, THE (director: Josef Rusnak; cast: Craig Bierko
(Douglas Hall/Joe Ferguson), Armin Mueller-Stahl (Hannon Fuller),
Gretchen Mol (Jane Fuller),  Vincent D'Onofrio (Whitney/Ashton), Dennis
(Detective Larry McBain), Steve Schub (Zev Bernstein), Jeremy Roberts
(Tom Jones), 1999)
This science-fiction thriller is based on the 1964 novel "Simulacron 3"
by Daniel Galouye. It asks the question, how would you react in finding
out that your world is not real? This is a theme a number of  '90s
sci-fi films have already done. It seems as if the movies are running
out of ideas for this world and need the after-life for more material.
The film opens with a quote from Descartes (1596-1650), "I think,
therefore I am." Supposedly, I am being prepared for a film that will
make me think. Instead, what I got was a sci-fi film that left me
somewhat confused by its being both a murder mystery and a time travel
sci-fi'er. It was very difficult to keep track of what was going on, as
the film moved back and forth between two different time frames. It was
also difficult for me to grok what is meant by the creation of parallel
dimensions and how it is possible for our world to be a copy of another.
What made it even more difficult, was that the story line was built
around the murder case and not around the more interesting ideas
generated by time travel. Yet, it was this virtual reality computerized
world that left me dazzled with its engrossing ideas.
Though the film tried, it simply couldn't create too much depth for its
characters.They remained tied to the sci-fi part of the story. This
meant that they had to act as copies. They performed their task well,
but their characters couldn't expand because of the limitations they
were presented with. They just didn't have too much sparkle to them.
Even the romance between the leads was jejune. This proved to be a fatal
flaw in the film.
The plot centers around a virtual reality device created that allows the
user to "jack-in" and play out various experiences in 1937 Los Angeles.
These creations have feelings and emotions just like people; but they
don't know they're not real.
The film opens, as Hannon Fuller (Armin) leaves a mysterious letter with
an unreliable bartender, Ashton (D'Onofrio), in a virtual reality world
of 1937 Los Angeles. The bartender reads the letter he was supposed to
give only to Douglas Hall (Bierko). Hannon Fuller is next seen in bed
with his wife. But he is soon in a hurry to leave his apartment and go
to this seedy bar. Once there, he leaves an urgent phone message on his
underling's phone machine. When he leaves the bar, he gets fatally
knifed in the street, in front of the bar. This murder takes place in
the real world of modern Los Angeles.
The letter he gave the bartender had a warning in it that they must stop
the program they are running. It is too dangerous. All signs point to
the killer being his colleague and heir to the computer empire, Douglas
Hall. He, unfortunately, can't remember a thing, as he wakes up in his
apartment with a blood-stained shirt in the wastebasket. Thusly, Doug is
forced to "jack-in" and return to 1937 Los Angeles to look for clues so
he can find the real killer. He is helped in this endeavor by his
colleague Whitney (D'Onofrio). Yes. Whitney is Ashton in the parallel
world. In the 1937 world that Doug returns to, he will be identified as
a bank teller named Joe Ferguson.
Detective McBain (Haysbert) is in the real world and it is his job to
get the killer. He shows up at Hannon's computer empire and starts
grilling the logical suspect and number one employee of Hannon, Douglas
Hall. Jane Fuller (Gretche Mol) is the love interest of Doug. She turns
up on the 13th floor of Hannon's computer empire, claiming to be the
daughter of Hannon, who was never mentioned to Doug. In the 1937 world,
she is a gum-chewing check-out clerk in a supermarket.
The 13th Floor, directed by Josef Rusnak from a screenplay he wrote with
Ravel Centeno-Rodriguez can be valued for its re-creation of a 1937 Los
Angeles of fancy bars, booming oil wells, and a magnificent Wilshire
Boulevard setting. All this ostentation taking place in the middle of
our great depression. It was fun to see this opulent depiction of a town
that was to only grow more opulent and depressed in the future. It took
this cyberthriller into noir film territory, as the falsely accused
hero, goes searching for the bartender to help him solve the mystery.The
simulations that brought him back to 1937, are a result of a computer
chip developed by Hannon. In this most original story, it seems Hannon
has made one too many simulations himself and now wants to abort this
project.
All the characters had different roles in their former lives. Hannon
Fuller was a poor junk store owner in 1937, contrasted with his role in
the present world, as the very wealthy corporate magnate. In his
simulations he frequented the glitzy bar, which provided him with girls
for pleasure.
I got mixed messages from this film. I thought it was an interesting
concept, that somehow didn't seem as exciting as it should be on the
first viewing. I will reserve final judgment on it, since I think it
could look better upon seeing it again. As for the flatness of the
characters, that I'm afraid won't change. But I must say, I thought the
actors did a really fine job considering the limitations placed on them
by the script...Also, the filmmakers did a good job with their use of
costume and set designs. I wanted to like this film more than I actually
did, but I couldn't fully enjoy it, for the simple reason that too much
of the film was taken up by the uninteresting murder case.

Starring Craig Bierko, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Gretchen Mol. Rated R.
Can there possibly be anything new to say about the concept of virtual
reality impersonating reality? In the past two years, Hollywood has
pummeled us drilled with the idea that the world as we know it may not
be what we think it to be -- films such as Dark City, The Matrix,
eXistenZ and now The Thirteenth Floor have all been brooding over the
thought. Notice that I have recommended all of the above, the reason
being that I love these kinds of movies; they have the potential to
excite my imagination and get my adrenaline flowing, if done well. Oddly
enough, these four movies have all been done well.
The Thirteenth Floor is an ambitious little movie that dares to open
with Descartes' famous quote "I think therefore I am." At first glance
it will seem ill-advised and pretentious, especially if you've seen any
promo material for the movie. But stick with it, and you'll find that
the presence of that quote in the very beginning provides the movie with
the power to stick with you for some time after it is over.
It opens with what seems like the early 19th century. We see an elderly
man (Armin Mueller-Stahl) leave a hotel (where a beautiful young girl is
peacefully sleeping on a bed), leave a note for the bartender to give to
someone else and head home. He comes home to his wife, gets into bed and
we find out that the guy is playing an elaborate computer game; indeed
he wakes up in a computer lab. Sooner than later, he is stabbed to
death. All evidence points to a young executive of the company, Douglas
Hall (Craig Bierko) to have killed him. Doug's only hope, it seems, is
to find a message that his now-deceased boss allegedly left inside the
simulation. What he finds changes his perception of reality, himself and
the people around him.
What's terrific about the first two thirds of The Thirteenth Floor is
how the movie plays out as a mystery; revealing its secret by slowly
peeling away its layers. It succeeds in keeping the deductive viewers a
half step ahead of the characters (mainly because for a corporate
executive, Douglas isn't terribly bright), but not so far that we become
bored.
Unfortunately for those that have just begun to get wrapped up in the
proceedings, the film falls apart completely towards the end. The
script, never particularly outstanding to begin with, starts to move
with undesirably rapid speed towards inanity, and the romance that
develops betweed Douglas and a beautiful woman with a dark secret
(Gretchen Mol) is not only horridly written but it is also
dissappointing as a payoff (this is what we get?!?). The ending leaves
too many loose-ends untied to be particularly satisfying, and it is also
telegraphed about 30 minutes before it actually happens so that one
pretty much knows for sure what is going to happen.
Mueller-Stahl is engaging in a role that never quite dies. Bierko is
just okay as the protagonist, although unfortunately he doesn't project
his shock at his discovery convincingly. Gretchen Mol is absolutely
dreadful in an essential role, but going into the explicit details of
her performance or her character will ruin a few surprises, so I'm not
going to go into detail here.
I never like seeing a movie that shows such promise nearly destroy
itself by such an uninspired resolution. The Thirteeth Floor is
regardless a respectable movie (although, for the record, I was
originally going to go with a much less enthusiastic **1/2, until I
found myself thinking about the movie more during that same night) but
it could easily been truly excellent -- it could have been the best
movie of the year. But it's not, and The Matrix holds on to that dubious
distinction.

Techies and software geeks need not get too jacked up over the glossy new
cyber-thriller `The Thirteenth Floor.' Sure, a really cool supercomputer is
at the center of things, but for all its nifty lighting effects, it might
as well be a Sharper Image version of an H.G. Wells-inspired way-back
machine.
Those waiting for a sophisticated fable about the computerized tomorrow
won't get too much sustenance from what is primarily nothing more than a
servicable noir borrowing plot points from virtual reality. This stylish
potboiler brings up fascinating questions, but leaves them on the table.
Not nearly as jarring an experience as `The Matrix,' to which it is
destined to be compared, `The Thirteenth Floor' -- like `The Matrix' --
plays with the notion of computer-invented planes of reality. But what
makes the thing go is a time-honored cinematic formula: dark interiors, a
mysteriously sad-eyed girl, a suspicious cop, a perplexed and paranoid hero
and an unsolved murder. Film Noir 101.
For such a high-profile pre-summer release (it comes from the same creative
team that afflicted us with `Godzilla'), `13th Floor' is pleasingly
star-less. The able cast is headed up by Craig Bierko (`The Long Kiss
Goodnight'), a kind of poor woman's Vince Vaughn, who stars as Douglas
Hall, a software hot-shot working closely with his mentor, the aged
computer science pioneer Hannon Fuller (Armin Mueller-Stahl). The two men
are on the verge of realizing a life-long ambition: the creation of a
virtual reality machine that re-creates a simulated world so real, the
computer-generated `people' have separate minds and free will.
The simulated world is Los Angeles, 1937, the period of Fuller's youth.
While the younger Hall is out of town, Fuller dives into his
virtual-reality machine before the kinks are ironed out to throw his money
around in nightclubs and bed down Depression-era show girls (talk about
your killer apps!).
One night, after one of these virtual joyrides, Fuller is murdered in a
dark alley and Hall, waking up not able to remember the night before, finds
a bloody shirt in his apartment. An intimidating cop (Dennis Haysbert)
fingers Hall as the prime suspect and Hall, not able to provide an alibi,
dives into virtual 1937 in search of clues on who could have murdered
Fuller, against the wishes of his techie assistant Whitney (Vincent
D'Onofrio, looking like a young John Malkovich).
Enter Jane (Gretchen Mol of `Rounders'), Fuller's mysterious but beautiful
daughter (whom Hall, Fuller's closest confidant, had never heard of).
Shooting off major seduction sparks in Hall's direction, Jane moves with
agility to claim Daddy's company.
If that weren't enough, Hall runs across more mysterious characters in 1937
(filmed in nicely burnished browns and golds). A suspicious bartender, a
virtual twin of his co-worker Whitney, holds the key to what happened to
Fuller. But the bartender, oozing malevolence, misleads a baffled Hall and
sets out on his sluething adventure. The bartender -- who is, remember,
just a computer-generated `unit' -- finds out the truth of his existence
and leads Hall to the humbling realization that he might not be `real'
either. Follow me so far?
Loosely adapted from Daniel F. Galouye's novel `Simalacron-3,' `13th Floor'
works on the proposition, as does `The Matrix,' that one's consciousness
can be downloaded into a living, breathing replica of one's self in a
artificially constructed world. It doesn't measure up to `The Matrix,'
however, in explaining the dangers and consequences of such reality
tampering, instead diluting its sci-fi ambitions with whodunit cliches. 
The film's reach exceeds its grasp when it settles into murky, existential
philosophizing on the nature of reality. The most advanced thinking in
computer science does indeed touch on the profound questions of
consciousness and perception. While `13th Floor' admirably ventures out
onto the shaky limb of such paradoxes, it does so in a facile manner,
postulating on what possibly isn't real but never really addressing is
real.
The film's most clever representation is, in fact, its view of 1937 LA,
balanced with just enough glitzy back-lot Hollywood touches to slyly
suggest that if we are able to create simulated worlds of the past, they
will be modeled more on romantic, movie-fed images of the past rather than
strictly historical models. Also, with the sober-minded professor Fuller
behaving in his made-up 1937 like Bill Clinton at a sorority mixer, the
film tantalizingly opens the question of whether morality and personal
conduct have any meaning in computer-generated worlds of pure fantasy.
These intriguing themes bow, however, to the demands of a rather rote
murder mystery, creating a faint but lingering air of disappointment -- an
emotion still unique to us carbon-based CPUs.

MOVIE VIEWS by Jamey Hughton:  http://Welcome.to/MovieViews
A good sci-fi is hard to come by these days. For every ingenious,
mind-boggling rarity like The Matrix, there are half a dozen idiotic
atrocities such as Virus. Where does The Thirteenth Floor come into
play? Somewhere in the middle, I should think.
During every twist and turn of this movie, you can sense the abundance
of good ideas stirring. The problem is, these ideas are never allowed to
escape, and the experience were left with putters along for an
incredibly hollow two-hour running time. Director Joseph Rusnak
obviously thinks that less is more. Well, in a situation like The
Thirteenth Floor, more would have definintely been appreciated.
The story involves brilliant scientist Hammond Fuller (Armin
Mueller-Stahl), whos created a possible link to a parallel dimension; a
visual simulation that allows the user to be transported circa 1937 and
experience the old days. As we soon learn, Fuller has something very
important to tell a co-worker of his named Douglas Hall (Craig Bierko).
But before he successfully passes on the message, he is brutally stabbed
to death by an unknown assailant outside a bar. The first twenty minutes
of The Thirteenth Floor contain just the right dosage of intrigue and
paranoia, but the story soon dissipates into a jigsaw puzzle that never
gets finished. It has the right pieces, but never uses them quite right.
Yes, this film does have obvious comparisons to Dark City, eXistenZ and
The Matrix. But its approach is so laid-back and boring you dont seem
to care. Even when the plot gets up into high gear (if thats what you
want to call it), you still want it to go that extra yard.
The premise is quite intriguing, but I needed far more convincing. In
the last third, theres an interesting sub-plot that delves into the
question of what is reality? Could it be possible that their world is
also a simulation, and that Fullers creation had already been
experimented with and they were the resulting product? Could their world
be a mere fabrication for others enjoyment? The Thirteenth Floor raises
so many questions, but unfortunately very few are answered for our
convenience.
The cast has a fun time playing dual, or sometimes triple roles with
this scenario. Vincent DOnofrio plays a present day computer programmer
named Whitney, but also the tight-fisted bartender Ashton in 1937.
Gretchen Mol is unfairly wasted as a mysterious woman charading as
Fullers daughter, but also as a part-time clerk at a grocery store. The
one actor who plays just a single character is Dennis Haysbert,
captivating yet underused as a LAPD detective on the case.
With all of its shortcomings, its thankful the visual appearance of The
Thirteenth Floor is both diverting and impressive. There are marvelous
old-fashioned crane shots that cover the towering, shimmering buildings
of present day Los Angeles, and the 30s are shown with convincing
effect.
Its really too bad that The Thirteenth Floor couldnt have amounted to
more. It had the potential to be a great science-fiction film. Its
always important to have a strong premise in this sort of film, but the
payoff is even more vital. The rising action will set the audience up,
hopefully captivate them for long enough, until the much needed payoff
takes over and carries a movie to a sturdy finish. The Thirteenth Floor
has nothing of the kind.
This is not a bad film, when it comes down to it. The intelligence and
creativity are above average for the genre, the actors are competent
enough to carry the project... where, pray tell, did it all go wrong? I
believe the answer to that lies within the directors choice to
completely ignore the third (and most important) act. The material here
would have gone a long way, if the movie was about 30 minutes long.

     The year is 1937.  As our story opens we follow an elderly man
(played by Armin Mueller-Stahl) from his mistress's bedroom to a
nightclub.  He leaves a letter he has written someone in the care of a
bartender (Vincent D'Onofrio) and goes home to his wife.  As he lies in
bed, suddenly he is propelled into the present. The world of 1937 was a
fully functioning world, realistic is every respect but one.  It was
not actually real but a total computer simulation.  And it was a very
complete computer simulation.  It is not just a virtual reality program
creating for one person what could be a three-dimensional world.  Each
person in the 1937 world has a life and personality of his or her own
and continues even when there is nobody to see him.  It is an entire
virtual world functioning on its own.  And our elderly gentleman is
Hammond Fuller, "the Einstein of our generation" who created the
cyber-world.  But tonight Hammond Fuller is going to be murdered and
suspicion will fall on his chief programmer Douglas Hall (Craig
Bierko).  Hall and his friend and coworker Whitney (Vincent D'Onofrio)
have worked for Hammond for years and think that they know him fairly
well.  Now that he is dead, they are not so sure.  A daughter (Gretchen
Mol) has turned up mysteriously and nobody knew Fuller had a daughter.
Discovered also is that Fuller has been repeatedly projecting himself
into his created world of 1937. Even Hall had not realized that was
possible yet.  Now Hall will have to solve a mystery spread across two
different worlds.
     Part of what makes this film as remarkable as it is is that it
comes from Centropolis Film Productions, Roland Emmerich's company.
Until now the best thing we have seen coming from Centropolis is their
imaginative opening banner. However, the approach for THE THIRTEENTH
FLOOR is entirely different from that of STARGATE, INDEPENDENCE DAY,
and GODZILLA.  Director Josef Rusnak, experienced mostly in European
films, has kept the use of special effects modest.  Rather than having
a visual carnival, this film is instead intelligent and filmed with a
great deal of visual style.  Cinematographer Wedigo von
Schultzendorff's style uses relatively modest special effects.  His
views of 1937 Los Angeles are lush and gorgeous, generally filmed with
a sepia filter to give us a Los Angeles where Philip Marlowe would feel
right at home.  von Schultzendorff has made his modern-day Los Angeles
looks like a giant electric-blue circuit pack.  Where the 1937 city has
a rich period feel, 1999 feels electronic and electrically charged.
     Rather than paying expensive stars, Rusnak has two little known
actors, Craig Bierko and Gretchen Mol, in the two top-billed positions.
He has saved the familiar faces for supporting roles.  His familiar
actors are more known for good performances than for powerhouse marquee
value.  Armin Mueller-Stahl had a long career in Germany and now
frequently appears in English-language films including SHINE, THE GAME,
and THE X FILES.  Vincent D'Onofrio has also been a familiar character
actor since his pivotal role as a somewhat retarded Marine recruit in
FULL METAL JACKET.
     So now we have had released in about a month three films about
worlds that seem real but are in reality created in computers.  We can
see how three different filmmakers have each handled the theme in an
action-adventure.  This is a rare opportunity.  The Wachowskis created
in THE MATRIX a future world that was visually imaginative and gave us
a plot that to a very great extent was chases, fighting, and martial
arts.  David Cronenberg's worlds in "eXistenZ" are basically our world,
but ones where the line between the totally inanimate and the
biological is breaking down.  Josef Rusnak has dusted off the 1964
science fiction novel SIMULACRON-3 by Daniel F. Galouye, toned down the
Frederik Pohl aspects (in the novel the world are used to predict
public opinion) and played up the Philip K. Dick aspects.  He has given
us a beautiful sepia-toned view of the 1930s to compare with an
electrically charged view of the present.  Perhaps which you prefer
says something about you.  THE MATRIX will clearly be the most
profitable, but THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR is the one I want in my
collection.  I rate the latter film 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high
+2 on the -4 to +4 scale. (Oh, and when we see a newspaper toward the
end, June 21 should be a Friday, not a Monday.)

Another "Twilight Zoney" Sci-Fi where what is real and what is merely
virtual aren't easily distinguished. The film starts strong presenting a
captivating scenario, then somewhere in the second half dips into a sappy
romance.
Sporting a great 1937 reconstruction of Los Angeles and good performances by
all involved, "13th Floor" looses focus when a love scene comes out of
nowhere. Most of the real action is reserved for the end, but the tension is
enough to keep the mystery ball rolling until then.
Starring Craig Bierko, Gretchen Mol, Vincent D'onofrio, Dennis Haysbert and
Armin Mueller-Stahl.
Directed by Josef Rusnak.
Screenplay by Josef Rusnak and Ravel Centeno-Rodriguez.
Produced by Roland Emmerich/Ute Emmerch/Marco Weber at Columbia/Roland
Emmerich.
Rated R.

Virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre. Since
'Dark City' (1998), films about alternative universes and parallel worlds
have been coming one after another. The most popular and original of them
all has been The Matrix. All the films released after it, have been less
successful. David Cronenberg's eXistenZ, released only a couple of months
after The Matrix, was accepted and even appreciated (by some), but the hype
was gone. And when 'The Thirteenth Floor' aired this fall, it was completely
overseen and ignored. I admit that this issue has become something between
tiring and annoying, feeling like eating the same meal over and over again.
It was therefore I was less than excited, when I went out to see to 'The
Thirteenth Floor'. However, I was positively surprised by Josef Rusnak's
latest picture. Matrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and
reality, combining the best of Hollywood's action and effects with an
intelligent story. eXistenZ was a violent, gory and unsettling journey
through reality and virtual reality, ending in blood and madness. 'The
Thirteenth Floor'  is somewhere in between. Instead of going after the
crowds - the action audience (like The Matrix), or aiming at the horror fans
(like eXistenZ ), 'The Thirteenth Floor' presents a more intelligent plot,
witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience, that the
true science fiction lovers will find rewarding.
In a near future...On the thirteenth floor of a classified building, a
genius scientist, Hannon Fuller, has created a simulated world, his personal
dreamworld, where every inhabitant is a complex, selflearning program that
only believes it is real. Right after the first testing of this world,
Fuller () is found murdered. Douglas Hall (), his closest friend and
business partner, immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter
through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth. A beautiful woman
(Gretchen Mol) who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the
mystery, which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence.
The first "download into simulation" is impressive. It is the creator's
first visit to his world, his creation. In order to enter this virtual
universe, you have to take over someone's identity, become another person.
This is called conciseness transfer, and this is part of the tragedy in the
film: People "wake up" in unknown places and strange things start happen.
They start to doubt in their own sanity. These innocent people pay for the
mistakes of their "users" and creators with their sanity and their lives. It
is a frightening reality; the fact that all the people in the simulation
(the program links) are living out their lives, oblivious, not knowing that
they are puppets in someone's fantasy.
With an appealing ("Blade Runner" - type) of detective story, this film
presents the beauty and possibilities of virtual reality and the lurking
danger that is always present. Our modern world is metal and glass -- cold,
unfriendly, impersonal. The thirties are different -- colorful, beautiful,
elegant, virile. This contrast demonstrates a wish for change. Virtual
reality is here portrayed as a magical, enchanting power that seduces you
into its endless possibilities. To some it is just a journey to their
personal paradise, to some a personal playground -- a life without any
consequences. For others - a way to start over and "correct" their mistakes,
by living in an illusion of their past. Virtual reality is a wizard that
transforms your hopes, dreams and fantasies to life. At least that's how it
is all beginning. But when you're waking up from your dream, the real world
seems worthless and unreal and all you can think off is returning to your
personal paradise. This, almost narcotic effect, soon turns into confusion
and ultimately madness. Some important and interesting philosophical
questions are raised -- what is real? what is thought? who are we? If these
were answered, this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made.
They are off course not answered, but posed in an intelligent manner. The
visual aspect of the film is one of the key elements, since it portrays the
contrast between these computer-simulated universes. Kirk M. Petrucelli has
done a marvelous job with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour,
grace and color; and setting this world in opposition to our own -- an
almost caricatured recreation of the nineties. There are some honest and
decent performances by an almost unknown cast and Harald Klose's moody
musical score that is at in right place at the right time.
A rather unusual thing about'The Thirteenth Floor'  is the almost complete
lack of special effects. There are no CGI animated creatures, no bullets in
slow motion. This is a more philosophical approach, reminding about the
European way of filmmaking. This is off course a major disappointment to the
audience that is used to endless gunfights and mutated amphibians, but the
more serious science fiction buffs and 'Dark City'-fans will be pleased.
This film is interesting and inspiring. It has everything eXistenZ doesn't,
but it lacks the immediacy and intensity of The Matrix. And then there is a
happy end which, like in 'Dark City', completely alienates it from the rest
of the story and context. The plot itself is not as original as the
filmmakers want us to think, since they have virtually sucked out all
information from the best science fiction classics, including Blade Runner
and 'Dark City' . With this in mind,'The Thirteenth Floor' doesn't make an
Oscar candidate or a film that will be remembered a year from now, yet this
is a beautiful, elegant and intelligent take on virtual reality.

The Thirteenth Floor: interdimensional mol
The tagline for The Thirteenth Floor is 'You can go there even though it
doesn't exist.' As far as things go that don't exist, though, the simulated
1937 we start with is pretty convincing, or, is made even more convincing by
Armin Mueller-Stahl's Hannon Fuller character, whose nervous eyes, hesitant
accent, and slight bearing seem to somehow fit director Josef Ruznak's 1930s
quite properly. Of course, however, Hannon Fuller is nervous for a reason:
though the simulation is 'his,' he's nevertheless made some discovery about
it, which he must pass on. But there'd be no movie if it was all that easy.
Meaning he dies to forward the plot, and with him dies a lot of the
potential depth of The Thirteenth Floor--the moral issues etc involved with
using this alternate reality as a hedonistic rest stop, where you can have a
whole nother identity if you choose. eXistenZ kind of stuff, just without
the overt game aspect. Or, Dark City kind of stuff, without the
skull-piercing hypodermics. Or, talking the last couple of weeks, Matrix
kind of stuff, with a smaller budget and lot more noir.
But back to the plot Hannon Fuller died for, the investigation which results
from his death and tries to form the dramatic backbone of the movie. The
chief suspect here is research associate / business partner Douglas Hall
(Craig Bierko playing Bruce Campbell), who, to clear himself, of course has
to go back into the simulation, gumshoe around for clues. Like
Mueller-Stahl, too, the costumers make him fit the 1930s very nicely. In
fact, he fits there so well he starts having some ontological difficulty,
('what constitutes the real?') so when one of the computer-generated
characters (Vincent D'Onofrio) begins acting strangely, as if he might
somehow be aware that this is all computer-generated, the simulation starts
crumbling. Along with Hall's life, and his chances of getting out of this
investigation alive.
His only chance, really, is figuring out what role Fuller's
long-lost-and-never-mentioned daughter Jane Fuller (Gretchen Mol) is
playing. Or, really, figuring out who she is, if she is, all that fun stuff
that goes hand in hand with virtual reality. In the detective drama The
Thirteenth Floor is trying hard to emulate, Jane Fuller is the mysterious
lady, the trouble-bringer. Meaning of course the two have to fall into bed
together, just to settle their differences. And this goes on for a while,
perhaps too long, or, definitely too long without some forward movement. But
this is an easy mistake to make in noir--more attention given to how the
rain looks on the asphalt at night than the dramatic stuff going on. At
least there's no voice-over. That would have been too much. Is the ending a
surprise, though? In light of eXistenZ, maybe not. Think of it as the
Nightmare on Elm Street ending, the one for which Gotcha! had the right
title.
Ignoring all the other VR movies for the moment, The Thirteenth Floor is
strong; in light of them, however--or, in it's own Pink Floyd tribute-light
(lasers, smoke)--things start to feel just a little conventional. The
Thirteenth Floor isn't so much a victim of weak movie-making as it is a
victim of a burgeoning genre, a genre trying to be both identifiable through
a recognizable group of developments and original each time. Thing is, the
two don't go hand in hand. Meaning a well-written, well-directed, well-acted
movie like The Thirteenth Floor can fail, simply because it's not breaking
any new ground. And who knows, perhaps Ruznak was aware of this, and thus
made the outer fringes of his simulated world ('the VR-genre') degrade into
lines of light, much like Tron, which had the freedom to create the
conventions as it went along. The characters in The Thirteenth Floor stare
out into that primal, laser-graphed reality with a combination of fear and
desire, as if they wonder what might still be out there. The whole genre is
wondering with them.

Even before filmmaker Josef Rusnak's new sci-fi picture, "The Thirteenth 
Floor," had been released, people were already comparing it to such 
recent films as "The Matrix," "Dark City," and "eXistenZ," but this 
comparison actually holds no water and is only related in a superficial 
way. Although "The Thirteenth Floor" has acquired a similar storyline 
concerning alternate realities and virtual technology, the style in 
which the subject matter is approached relies more on '30s film noir 
than action or fantasy (even though it has a little bit of both). If 
anything, the film reminded me of 1994's Jean-Claude Van Damme pic, 
"Timecop," if you can believe that.
Hannon Fuller (Armin Mueller-Stahl), a groundbreaking computer designer 
and leader of a corporate tower, has invented a virtual reality system 
that stands as a realistic simulation of Los Angeles, circa 1937. It 
seems Fuller has been "jacking in" quite a lot lately, and found himself 
a hunted man in both worlds, the simulation and 1999. Before he is 
killed, however, he leaves a note with a bartender in 1937 to be given 
to his close confidante and computer researcher, Douglas Hall (Craig 
Bierko). When much of the murder evidence ominously points toward 
Douglas, he decides to go back to the simulated '30s in hopes of finding 
out why Fuller was killed, and if he really did do it. Meanwhile, a 
mysterious, fetching young woman, Jane (Gretchen Mol), claims to be 
Fuller's daughter, and immediately grows an attraction with Douglas, 
both of whom are struck with an odd sense of deja vu that they've met 
before.
Sony, the studio behind "The Thirteenth Floor" (which is based upon the 
Daniel F. Galouye novel, "Simulacron 3"), probably couldn't have chosen 
a more inopportune time to be releasing this film. The summer of big 
blockbusters has just begun to gear up in recent weeks, and this film is 
a deliberately-paced, rather un-mainstream movie without a "name" actor 
in the whole cast. Not only that, but "The Matrix" is still playing in 
most theaters, and the television spots for "The Thirteenth Floor" have 
probably been too similar to picque sci-fi fans' interest. Perhaps an 
early-spring berth would have been a more intelligent release time 
because, as is, the film has next to no chance at being a box-office 
success.
So, regardless of money, how is the actual film? Well, after a rocky 
opening twenty minutes that never really grasped ahold of my interest, 
the movie gradually got more and more involving and intriguing until I 
actually began to enjoy it midway through. The idea of alternate 
realities is not a new one, but it almost always seems fresh here, most 
likely because it doesn't follow the usual genre bandwagon and go for 
non-stop action, explosions, and special effects. There is an actual 
brain working within "The Thirteen Floor," and while this is always 
apparent, the film ultimately fails to take off in time to fully save 
itself. By the end, there are still many noticable plot holes that 
certainly needed to be worked out, but maybe I should just be thankful 
that it was at least comprehensible, as opposed to the overblown, 
overplotted, overrated "The Matrix."
The cast is good for what they're worth, but no one ever really comes 
off as fully developed and three-dimensional. Craig Bierko is an 
unfamiliar face who has what it takes to act as the protagonist, but I 
never really grew to care about his fate. The same goes for Vincent 
D'Onofrio, as Douglas' buddy in the present and a bartender in the 
simulation world. Armin Mueller-Stahl is thoroughly wasted as Fuller, 
the vital chaacter who sets the plot into motion, but all but disappears 
afterwards. And finally, we come to Gretchen Mol, a luminous young 
actress whom has occasionally, and unfairly, been criticized for her 
questionable acting talents. What "those" people fail to understand, 
however, is that Mol does have range, but her full abilities have not 
been put to the cinematic test yet, since most of her roles thus far 
have been relatively small. Mol is the one strong link in "The 
Thirteenth Floor," and in several scene, particularly one set at a 
grocery store, she manages to not strike one false note.
By the time "The Thirteenth Floor" had reached its climax, I was far 
more engrossed in the goings-on than I was in the first hour, but the 
film still came off as nothing more than a valiant failure. The 
screenplay, by Josef Rusnak and Ravel Centeno-Rodriguez, brings up many 
thought-provoking questions and unpredictable twists, but the dialogue 
and characters needed another re-write. "The Thirteenth Floor" is one 
case in which individual moments and ideas come off as far more 
powerful, and memorable, than the overall whole.

   I've been a fan of Daniel F. Galouye's work for over four decades.
Galouye was a WWII Air Force hero, retired early due to service-related
injuries; he switched professions to become a journalist, and when
further health problems appeared, became a free-lance writer in several
genres.   His work in Speculative Fiction, particularly minor milestones
like "DARK UNIVERSE" and "SIMULACRON-3," put him near the top of the SF 
field, and earned him a good deal of respect (and awards nominations.)
   For over three and a half decades, I've wanted to see a good movie
adaption of "SIMULACRON-3."   In fact, in the middle seventies, I
pitched the idea to a couple of Suits at Universal, trying to get them
to acquire the rights for a TV-movie.   
   Hilariously, I was completely unaware that Rainer Werner Fassbinder 
had already done a German TV "miniseries" adaption, which by all accounts
was competent, respectable, decent work (1974).   I have yet to see a copy
of it, and as far as I know, no English-language or dubbed versions exist.
The German version had a pretty healthy budget and production capacity
behind it, so at least Daniel Galouye got to live long enough to see his
work done on the screen, apparently by folks who did it well.
   It's a pity that Galouye didn't live another couple of decades to see 
the current Emmerich/Rusnak version; I strongly believe he'd have been
delighted, flattered, and hugely pleased.
   "THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR" will be largely savaged in reviews, and not get
the box office it deserves, due to the heavy mining of the concept and
similar concepts in recent years;  viewpoint characters lost in ambigous
realities finally shown to be a sham have been thrown at us over and over
again, with over-budgeted c**p like "DARK CITY," "MATRIX," and "eXistenZ,"
and respectable efforts like Weir/Niccol's "THE TRUMAN SHOW."  ( And 
Carrey was robbed, come Oscar Time, but I digress. )
   Sadly, most of the movie-going public will simply not realize that
Galouye did it first, did it better, and has been adapted by scriptwriters
who obviously took the trouble to actually *READ* the book and show it
some respect during the adaption process.  The very real accomplishment
here will be drowned out and buried beneath the high-budget flash of
predecessors who derived their storylines from conceptual descendents
of Galouye's original work.   ( Galouye didn't do it first in prose SF,
by any means; he was just the first one to do a really good job of it,
and in its era, his novel was hugely innovative and important.)
   The only prior English credit I can find on Joseph Rusnak is a
second-unit director job on "GODZILLA, and I've certainly never heard
of Ravel Centeno-Rodriguez, but I want to go on record as formally 
thanking them for not messing up one of my favorite books.
   The movie's opening scenes, with Hannon Fuller ( played by Armin 
Mueller-Stahl, who's practically a German national treasure ) Seriously
Fooling Around In, and leaving a mysterious message in, a Virtual Reality
world -- and then getting killed after he returns to the real world --
set the tone for the entire movie:
   Wonderful period sets, props, and costuming, and a selection of film
stock and processing that creates a beautiful color version of classic
"film noir" to establish a period "feel" very important to the rest of
the movie.... the cinematographer, Wedigo Von Schultzendorff, has created
a unique feel and look for the movie without blowing the entire budget.
The handling of the obviously purposeful use of non-modern lighting,
grain, and color balance are absolutely wonderful work, particularly
considering the movie's base budget.  The period music is handled
superbly and is lovely to hear, in an era when movies seem to pride
themselves on their ability to damage the patrons' hearing.
   For me, the movie's greatest strength is that most of the major cast
members are not "stars," but are professionals, quite good indeed.
   Craig Bierko, who plays Douglas Hall, the much-beleaguered hero, and
Gretchen Mol, his love interest, are both excellent and understated in
their roles.  The have to portray slightly unreal characters, in slightly
unreal environments, and still make us believe in their characters; they do.
   While it's a truism that any competent actor should be able to change
into a different character with only alterations of body language and
micromomentary facial expression, we don't often get to see it done with
a reasonable degree of skill.   Bierko, Mol, and Vincent D'Onofrio probably
had a good deal of fun with their on-screen character transitions.
   The plot is a bit simplistic by our present-day standards; Hall has
to figure out how, and why, his life is being messed with, and Who The
Mysterious Lady actually is.  Long-time SF fans will see everything
coming a mile away, since Galouye's major plot points have been recycled
and fiddled with for decades.   But like any classic or minor-classic
work, the joy lies in the process, the trip.
   The only carps I have about this movie are the relatively gratuitous
use of zooming-tunnel-of-light symbology during the consciousness-transfer
scenes, and sparkling eyes.  Neither were necessary, and possibly should
have been avoided.  I would have preferred different architecture and
atmosphere for the final scene, but it worked just fine the way it was,
so what the heck. 
   This is the first movie I have ever seen with Emmerich's name on it 
that I was not embarrassed to admit in public I'd sat through all the 
way.   I plan to see it at least one more time while it's still in the
theater, just to take a few notes.
   You'll be amazed by the exterior scenes from the late 1930's.  The
work is occasionally breath-takingly good.
   I've been told that "THIRTEENTH FLOOR" was shot on $35 million, and
frankly have trouble believing it; that's a pretty danged decent piece
of work on a relatively average budget for something with FX work in it,
and all I can say is, if this is the quality of work that Emmerich can
manage when he's constrained to a sensible budget and does *NOT* have
Dean Devlin on the staff, I'll be looking forward to his next project.
   I might have gone five stars, if they'd left out the Descartes quote
at the beginning and the diving-through-light-tunnels footage.  ( Well,
once would have been okay, since the glowing-network imagery was nice,
and a good subliminal referent to neural dendritic structures. )
  As far as I'm concerned, this one is " * * * * " out of five possible.
In my personal rating system, this equates to "worth evening prices,
WITH popcorn."

If you ever find yourself in a simulated world, don't tell the natives.
It can be very upsetting to learn that your flesh and blood is just a
stream of bits on someone's computer.
Opening with the "I think, therefore I am" quote of Descartes, Josef
Rusnak's THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR serves notice that this is a pretentious
movie.  Indeed, the script by Josef Rusnak and Ravel Centeno-Rodriguez,
based on Daniel F. Galouye's novel "Simulacron 3," does a masterful job
of setting up a plot with an intriguing premise.  With shades of THE
TRUMAN SHOW and THE MATRIX, the movie takes so much risk that it is a
shame that about its only memorable parts are the cinematography and the
set decoration.
A billion dollar software company lead by Hammond Fuller (Armin
Mueller-Stahl) has just finished creating the ultimate virtual reality
system.  Fuller's company, housed in a large building, appears to have
only 2 employees, a pair of programmers named Douglas Hall (Craig
Bierko) and Whitney (Vincent D'Onofrio).  All 3 characters have
counterparts in the simulated world that their system creates.
The present is a hazy, neon blue world filled with bright laser beams,
ominous skyscrapers and dark supercomputers.  The simulated past is set
in a handsome 1937.  Colored in hazy sepia tones, this attractive world
features showgirls that dance the night away to big bands.  The sets in
the past are art deco masterpieces.  Between the two, the choice is
easy; go for the inviting past.
As the story opens, Fuller is in the past but quickly makes his way back
to the present, where he is murdered.  A scruffy, black cop, Detective
Larry McBain (Dennis Haysbert), dressed in classic film noir garb, tries
to investigate this multiple-reality murder.  Complicating his
investigation is the appearance of a woman named Jane Fuller (Gretchen
Mol), who claims to be the daughter of the dead man.  Since Hammond
Fuller had no known relatives, this confuses everyone.
As the mystery deepens, the story has our two software designers getting
on and off the laser light table that transports them between
timeframes.
The film's coldly antiseptic present matches all too perfectly the style
of the acting.  None of the characters has any warmth or genuineness.
The screenplay has so many logical holes and out-of-left-field events
that you're liable to end up snickering at it, as our audience did.  And
suspension of disbelief is a prerequisite.  If you're a grownup and have
never been out of town, take this as a sign that something may not be
quite right in your world.
Still, for all of its flaws, the story possesses a strange fascination,
and you're unlikely to be bored.  "You can't just plug your brain into
this machine and not be affected by it," Jane says.  Watching this movie
is like that.  It becomes more intriguing that it has any right to be,
given its limitations.
If you want a good science fiction film, then this frustrating one may
not be the one for you.  On the other hand, if it's a good-looking
science fiction film you're after, then look no further.  THE THIRTEENTH
FLOOR is exquisite eye-candy for the sci-fi set.
THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR runs 2:00.  It is rated R for violence and some
profanity and would be fine for teenagers.

Synopsis: 
Douglas Hall  (Craig Bierko) has a problem. His best friend, a rich old
computer genius named Hannon Fuller (Armin Mueller-Stahl) has created a
virtual 1937 Los Angeles inside a computer simulation that is so realistic
that the computer characters think they really exist. The problem is that
Fuller has just been murdered, and all the clues point to Hall as the
murderer. Poor Hall can't remember a thing about where he was the night of
the murder despite a bloody shirt. Hall chases down a possible clue inside
the Los Angeles simulation, while trying to prevent the character
simulations from finding out that they are not real. He meets a mysterious
woman (Gretchen Mol) and tries to clear himself while exploring the new
"reality."
Opinion:
The trouble with THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR is that it's a concept movie.
Characters go through long dialogues passing movie minutes until the film's
ending delivers the big "surprise" revelation. Unfortunately, the
revelation is no surprise because this year we've seen similar "reality"
revelations from countless other virtual simulation theme movies such as
THE MATRIX. 
I can recommend the beautifully done cinematography; 1937 Los Angeles is a
visual feast. But there's not enough danger and the end is predictable.
It's hard to pay full attention to THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR for more than half
an hour no matter how wonderfully the visuals are rendered.

Take a trip to "The Thirteenth Floor" and enter an empty room with a
fantastic view. The see-worthy sights are courtesy of this sci-fi
thriller's dazzling recreation of the glitz and glamour of 1930s Los
Angeles, but even opulent backdrops like elegant nightclubs and posh
hotel lobbies can't make up for a lack of soul or any real suspense. And
those are the least of its problems - another one of those
alternate-plane-of-reality flicks, "Thirteenth" reeks of beamed-there,
theorized-that coming so fast on the heels of like genre fare including
the hit "The Matrix," David Cronenberg's artsy "eXistenZ" and the
Spanish import "Open Your Eyes."
Moviegoers may be closing their eyes and dozing off after such an
interesting prologue sequence pulls them from the aforementioned setting
to a futuristic-looking but contemporary version of the same metropolis,
where the film makes its familiar agenda quite clear. Apparently, a
group of '90s programmers (Craig Bierko, Vincent D'Onofrio and Armin
Mueller-Stahl) have been fiddling around with a computer simulation of
Jazz Age L.A. Mueller-Stahl ("Shine"), the project leader, gets wind of
a major bombshell regarding the experiment but is killed before he can
pass the information along to lackeys Bierko ("Sour Grapes"), the
straight-arrow, and D'Onofrio ("The Newton Boys"), the wild-card.
Thanks to evidence stacked against him, Bierko becomes suspected of the
murder and frantically searches for clues to prove otherwise using the
time-travel contraption. This intrigue coincides with yet another - the
sudden appearance of the deceased's globe-trotting daughter ("Rounders"'
Gretchen Mol). She shows up to claim her old man's business and property
upon learning of his demise, demonstrating that this is the kind of
movie where characters gasp lines akin to "He never mentioned a
daughter!" Matters begin to grow confusing here, what with all of the
trips between surrogate L.A.s and each of the main acting quartet
playing two versions - if not eventually more - of his or her initial
role.
Still, "The Thirteenth Floor"'s collision of past and present is no less
perplexing than "The Matrix," a similar techno-mystery it faces
inevitable comparisons to. In fact, people not among "The Matrix"'s mass
of avid supporters - this critic included - might note how "Thirteenth"
offers grander scenic dazzle, a tighter edit and nil in the way of
mumbo-jumbo regarding Chosen Ones or Oracles. But at least that movie
packed in some taut kinetic thrills. "Thirteenth"'s idea of sensory
explosion is to throw Bierko and Moll, both fine in past work but not
cast to their strengths here, late passionate professions that don't
rate the slightest pulse.
>From this unlikely coupling on, it's all downhill - as in runaway and
unrecoverable. Already stopped dead in its tracks by a superfluous
romance, "The Thirteenth Floor" proceeds with a denouement and climax so
sudden, wrong and noodle-headed that they'll polish off whatever mild
interest - and patience - remains in most viewers. The finale, an
unequivocal high point in "The Matrix," sputters with absurdity,
predictability, plot holes and a confrontation worthy of a "Fatal
Attraction"-esque potboiler. Even those who thus far have enjoyed
themselves need to heed this advisory: Exit "The Thirteenth Floor" a few
floors early.

"Here it is at last, the first 150-minute trailer. Armageddon' is cut
together like its own highlights. Take almost any 30 seconds at random,
and you'd have a TV ad. The movie is an assault on the eyes, the ears,
the brain, common sense and the human desire to be entertained. No
matter what they're charging to get in, it's worth more to get out."

   Like others of my generation, I was born too early.  Sure,
we had games just like everyone since the Flintstones.  We
played stick ball in the street, bounced spaldeens for punch
ball in the back yard, and pushed and shoved those pinball
machines, avoiding "tilt" as much as we could.  Nowadays
we're not too old to fool around with a joystick, virtually
wiping out terrorists or solving the intricate mysteries of Myst. 
But darn it, I don't think we'll be around long enough to
create whole new worlds of people who look and talk like us
and stab and shoot one another in much the same way we
do now.   But at least we can enjoy those pleasures
vicariously on the big screen for under ten bucks a pop.  One
such diversion that's come our way is "The Thirteenth Floor,"
which will keep everyone over the age of 30 guessing while
bringing patronizing grins to the faces of the more youthful
constituency. I think that even H.G. Wells would have a
difficult time guessing just what the heck is going on as the
strikingly handsome Douglas Hall transports himself from
present-day Los Angeles back to 1937 to discover that he's
just as cute then, albeit with a mustache, but that during the
Depression, the only color that city planners could afford for
the streets was sepia.
   Don't forget to wear some extra padding in your briefs.  By
the time the story ends and we get the big aha(!) of the
concise epilogue, you'll kick yourself hard for not perceiving
the game plan all along--if you're over 30, that is.
   This is quite an intriguing movie, surely more layered and
convincing than David Cronenberg's "eXistenZ" and for my
money more absorbing than "Matrix."  Inspired by (rather
than adapted from) Daniel Galouye's sci-fi book "Simulacron
3," "The Thirteenth Floor"--scripted by its director, Josef
Rusnak, and Ravel Centeno-Rodriguez--opens with the
Cartesian quote, "I think, therefore I am," which considering
what follows is somewhat pretentious but at least is not
written in Latin.  We're thrust into the L.A. of Depression
times quicker than you can say "Eddie Murphy," as an elderly
gentleman whom you'd call dignified had he not shown his
proclivity toward young women thrusts a letter into the hands
of a night-club bartender.  You wonder why a fellow who is
allegedly the head of an envelope-pushing corporation would
trust a bleached-blond barkeep with this portentous epistle,
but that's just one of the story's jostles against our credibility. 
We learn that Hannon Fuller (Armin Mueller-Stahl) has big
plans for the man he has chosen to succeed him as
corporate honcho, Douglas Hall (Craig Bierko), but the mail-
robbing mixologist Ashton (Vincent D'Onofrio) has other
schemes in mind.  Fuller then makes his second mistake: he
propels himself into the L.A. of 1999 where, predictably
enough, he is stabbed to death, arousing the interest of
LAPD Detective Larry Mc Bain (Dennis Haysbert).  The noir-
like cop suspects Hall, who is heir to the corporate fortune,
but before he can arrest the legatee, Hall falls instantly in
love (as anyone would) with Fuller's daughter Jane (Gretchen
Mol).  With the police suspicious of Hall, the comely hero
begins to think that he did indeed commit the murder but
wiped the memory from his mind.  To get to the bottom of
this, he zaps back to '37 with the assistance of computer
geek Whitney (Vincent D'Onofrio again).  Hall becomes more
deeply enmeshed in the whole affair, involving himself in
violence with bartender Ashton and a liaison (which he
prefers) with the lovely Jane.
  Sci-fi fans in the audience cannot be faulted if they compare
and contrast "The Thirteenth Floor" with others of the genre
having similar plots.  Roland Emmerich's "Stargate" comes
first to my mind, the tale of a scholar of ancient languages
and hieroglyphics recruited to decipher the mystery of a stone
gateway, which actually leads to another universe.  Like
"Stargate," "The Thirteenth Floor" is an involving odyssey
with a few fascinating cyber effects, especially the involved
pattern of interconnecting bars that our time traveler runs into
out in the Arizona desert. And like "Stargate," this one
sometimes loses its dramatic projection amid a plethora of
visuals.  Craig Bierko--who, according to the buzz of women
around me stands to become the next cover guy on the celeb
magazines--is a more interesting performer than Kurt Russell,
more the guy with the dimensions of "Stargate"'s James
Spader.  His expressions are riveting as he turns from
obsessively curious computer scientist to vulnerable do-
gooder to bemused object of a gorgeous woman's affection.
Though he is not yet a household name, movie buffs may
remember his role with Geena Davis in Renny Harlin's "The
Long Kiss Goodbye" and in the underrated Larry David
comedy "Sour Grapes."  Vincent D'Onofrio, one of my
favorites, can do no wrong, not even here where he's given
makeup that might have been inspired by Bruce Willis's artist
in "The Jackal."  Armin Mueller-Stahl, one of the world's
greats, is above criticism.  The 69-year-old leading man of
German stage and screen who turned in a memorable
performance in Costa-Gavras's "Music Box" ten years ago
and as the domineering father of David Helfgott in "Shine"
comes across this time as a plausible scientist eager as a
puppy to have fun with his invention during his later years. 
Gretchen Mol is given little opportunity, however, to strut her
stuff, here playing a vapid temptress with stilted romantic
dialogue, as she discusses her experience with love at first
sight and in an alternate life transforming herself into the
even more insipid gum-chewing supermarket checker.
   See if you can guess the secret, but don't leave the theater
when you think the movie's over, as some did in a preview
screening.  Those who bolted to beat the crowd either knew
something the rest of us didn't or will have to wait for the
movie buzz to discover the concealed message of this film--
which for all its lack of humor and engaging dialogue is a
memorable experience in visual imagery, crisp acting, and
resonant imagination.

In its time, "The Twilight Zone" was groundbreaking television, but 
watching it today often proves to be a taxing experience. Many episodes, 
built around ideas that felt startlingly original then, seem trite now. 
Too many were terribly padded, with sketchy characters chattering 
incessantly to kill time until the big surprise payoff at the end. And as 
for those surprise payoffs, some still hold up beautifully ("Don't get on 
that ship! That book, 'To Serve Man,' it... it's a cookbook"), but many 
others ("It's a planet called... Earth," "Pleased to meet you, Eve, my 
name is... Adam") feel so painfully obvious that it's embarrassing. 
Which brings me to "The Thirteenth Floor," the latest entry in the "what 
is reality?" genre. Loosely based on Daniel Galouye's novel "Simulacron 3,
" the idea for this story was probably hot stuff when released in the 
'60s, but in the post "Dark City," "Matrix," "eXistenZ" cinematic world, 
it has a decided "been there, done that" sensibility. While the 
production boasts some jazzy visuals, the characters are so generic and 
undeveloped that it's impossible to care what happens to them. The film 
is boring and, if you haven't figured out the lame "surprise payoff" by 
the time our hero takes his first drive into the country, then you simply 
weren't trying.
The set-up (don't worry, I'll keep this short) goes like this: Some 
computer whiz kids have cooked up a virtual reality device that allows 
the user to "jack-in" and play out various experiences in a sepia-toned 
(they're still having troubles getting the color right) 1937 Los Angeles. 
When one of the creators gets murdered in our world, his colleague takes 
a dangerous trip into the simulated past to search for clues. 
If you just found yourself thinking "Wow, that reminds me of Jean-Luc 
Picard having a Dixon Hill adventure on the holodeck," then 
congratulations, you're as big a geek as I am.
Even though the whole "what is reality?" thing has been done to death 
lately, the film still could have worked had the screenplay been better, 
but the characterizations here are utterly flat. Armin Mueller-Stahl 
injects what life he can into his role, but has relatively little screen 
time to work with. The rest of the cast, particularly leads Craig Bierko 
and Gretchen Mol, are just plain bad. 
What the film does get right are some of the visuals. 1937 Los Angeles is 
beautifully detailed and looks great, and a shot of one character 
reaching the edge of the simulation, while overly reminiscent of the 
aforementioned holodeck, is striking nonetheless. Other effects are less 
successful. Wormhole style images of characters entering the virtual 
world have been better realized in everything from "Contact" to "Sliders" 
and the buildings in the closing shot are both cheesy and illogical (I 
don't want to give anything away, so I'll just say that the date and the 
architecture don't exactly gibe).
Had "The Thirteenth Floor" been cut to 22 minutes, it might have made a 
superior episode of "The Twilight Zone." As a feature film, though, this 
is a bloated trifle, with pleasures too minor to warrant the expenditure 
of your time and money. If you're in the mood to question reality, do it 
with "The Matrix" or "Dark City."

     All right, we know we've reached a new level when every the completely
surreal seems completely predictable.  When the weird is the norm, something
is very, very wrong.  Right now you're saying something along the lines of
"Come on: since when have we been able to predict movies that make no sense
whatsoever?"
     The answer: ever since The Thirteenth Floor.
     Either gifted or cursed (depending on your mindset) with a complex
plot, The Thirteenth Floor is the first movie that the blundering idiot of a
producer Roland Emmerich has turned out that has any plot at all.  The
lesson to be learned from this: be careful not to use to much cooking
sherry, lest you get drunk while eating.  Emmerich, normally playing the
fool as to the lack of plot he gives us, tries instead to give us too much
to be supported by the weak frame of a story that is set up.
     The story, having something to do about playing God, piles onto us a
lot of unnecessary romance, uninteresting intrigue, and piss-poor subplots.
Although the plot is completely surreal and bizarre, it comes off as a mix
and mash between Dark City and The Matrix we are all living in a virtual
reality experiment  where we can never get to a certain location.  In a
foolish attempt to make the story more interesting to us, The Thirteenth
Floor throws in a bit of eXistenZ to boot.  This virtual reality we live in
is a recreational game of sorts which someone is trying to repair.  Then,
perhaps as a personal bit to annoy intelligent viewers, it places in an
idiotic romance.
     The tekkies will hate this film for one simple reason, a flaw in the
story.  The way the characters discover their illusion is travelling to its
end, where they see a grid of green lines.  If the programmers of this
"genius" experiment are intelligent enough to render sight, smell, taste,
touch, and sound, not to mention the consciousness of all of the characters
living inside the machine, then why the hell can't the stick them in an
indefinite loop which will send them to the other side of the simulation?
An easy wrap around?  Sure, the characters would know something was wrong,
but they wouldn't be able to pinpoint it.
     Now that I am finished taking apart its plot I choose to take apart the
acting.  Wait, the acting is fine, but the roles are weak.  Vincent
D'onofrio confirms my suspicions that he is getting all of the creative
roles left by his portrayal as both protagonist and antagonist.  Seriously,
who's he bribing?  Gretchen Mol, who I saw once before in Rounders, gets a
slightly better written role in this one, but still not a great part.  The
movie completely makes waste of Armin Mueller-Stahl.
     Can't someone pass some legislation regarding wasting good actors in
bad roles?
     The one thing that I must mention at the end of this review is for
people who are interested in The Thirteenth Floor but think that Ethernet is
some kind of hospital anesthetic: for people who don't know technology,
people who don't like science fiction, and people who don't have high
standards for film, this film is fine for you.  Although the characters are
underwritten, they will attach onto you like leeches and thus stick with
you.  Although the plot and story are predictable to anyone who spends time
trying to figure them out, the film can be enjoyed by those willing to shut
their minds off.  Just don't expect anything anywhere near as intelligent or
scary as the previews imply.

     I want to start by mentioning that I actually work on the 13th
floor of a real live building in downtown San Francisco.  My business
card actually reads `13th Floor'.  Reading my business card is more
interesting than this film.
     Interesting premise: Computer geniuses build a virtual reality
machine that lets them go back in time to 1937 Los Angeles.  Only the
virtual people have feelings and emotions just like us; they don't know
they're not real.  But then they find out.
     Horrible execution: Working from a screenplay from Rusnak and
Centeno-Rodriguez  neither of whom have written anything I've ever
heard of  and under the direction of Rusnak  whose only
English-language credit is as second unit director on GODZILLA, THE
THIRTEENTH FLOOR has little to no raw talent behind it.  Rusnak
obviously couldn't put together a love scene if he was in it himself
with Cindy Crawford - the film's little tryst between Bierko and Mol
drew howls of laughter from our audience.
     On technical merits, FLOOR is an even bigger failure.  I haven't
seen a film in the last 20 years that has such bad lighting and poor
choice of film stock.  And I'd be remiss without pointing to the
hideously flawed soundtrack on our test print  or maybe it was the
theater.  (Maybe that was a blessing.)
     After two good VR flicks: THE MATRIX and EXISTENZ, I suppose we
were ripe for a failure in going for three in a row.  You know, in most
buildings, the thirteenth floor doesn't exist.

The 1990s produced two brilliant science fiction films.  One was
_Gattaca_.  The other was
_The Thirteenth Floor_.  Just as _Gattaca_ was overshadowed by the
mighty _Titanic_, _The Thirteenth Floor_ was relegated to obscurity by
_The Matrix_.  However, _The Thirteeth Floor_, though it deals with
similar themes, is a much better movie than the frenetic, childish and
improbable _Matrix_.
A cutting edge computer scientist, Hannon Fuller (played by the charming
Armin Mueller-Stahl), is murdered.  His associate, Douglas Hall, (Craig
Bierko) apparently framed and suspected by the police, enters into the
simulated world they have created in order to unravel the mystery.
Along the way a beautiful blonde (Gretchen Mol), more bodies, and a
deepening mystery about simulated worlds complicate the picture.
_The Thirteenth Floor_ unfolds slowly and telegraphs its punches,
choosing to elicit the more complex emotional response of empathy and
anticipation rather than the cheap one of mere surprise.  The result is
a movie that is a failure from two conventional points of view.  First,
its plot revelations can be foreseen if one has carefully followed its
complex storyline.  Second and more seriously, it demands that its
audience think and feel. No wonder it fell through the cracks.
Done in film noir style as a murder mystery, this is a relatively deep
movie that functions on several levels. Many audiences will simply be
bewildered by it, rather than engaged, which is a shame, because this
movie amply repays a little emotional and intellectual investment.  I
recommend a second viewing simply to get the flavor of the frequent
ironic foreshadowing in the opening parts of the movie.
Despite its philosophical challenges, _The Thirteenth Floor_ derives its
emotional force from the love story between Jane Fuller (Mol) and
Douglas Hall (Bierko), as well as the close friendship between Douglas
Hall and Hannon Fuller. In that sense it is more akin to _Gattaca_ than
_The Matrix_, which, for all of its cute philosophical byplay, is an
adolescent movie with no emotional depth whatsoever. The moment when
Jane Fuller confesses her love for Douglas Hall is at once satisfying,
wrenching and intellectually challenging.  In its final moments the film
even takes on itself, when David, Jane's husband, who has come to enjoy
killing, accuses her of being the sick one.  Although there is a victory
for the leading characters, this resolution suggests a disturbing
element of fantasy in Jane, and thus a deep-seated character flaw.  In
fact, Hannon Fuller's activities in the simulated world, the behavior of
Jane's husband, and the effects of entering the simulation on Douglas
Hall all hint at similar issues with those characters.  This is not a
film of good people beset from without by great evil.  The tragedy is
not in their stars, but in themselves.
The major actors, all of whom are required to play two or even three
roles, perform extremely well.  Bierko, who will be familiar as the
psycho from _The Long Kiss Goodnight_, is outstanding. D'Onofrio as
Whitney, who plays a pivotal role in support, also turns in a good
performance. The lovely Gretchen Mol, whose elegance, integrity, and
determination suggest Bergman in _Casablanca_, does a wonderful job. Her
voice, however, lacks the necessary weight at times.  This could be
because she was given the worst lines in a movie whose major weakness is
the script.
Some minor flaws, hairline cracks in fine porcelain, appear in places.
There are one or two instances of jerky editing.  The script takes the
edge off the film's climaxes.  The atmosphere becomes too claustrophobic
at times (yet, there is a clue there too).  One wonders if even after
two decades, _Blade Runner_ is still casting its long shadow over sci-fi
films.  One can see a group of suits in their suite, waving their hands
imperiously at directors like the Emperor in _Amadeus_: "make it more
like_Blade Runner_, you know, dark and rainy."
_The Thirteen Floor_ is that rare exception among Hollywood movies: a,
rich, emotionally satisfying, intelligent sci-fi movie.  And yet,
ultimately, it proves the suits right.  For when good sci-fi is made,
where is the SF community turning out in droves to see it? If we don't
support great SF, who will?

THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR by DeWyNGaLe    Rating: B
The Thirteenth Floor, the third in what I would call "the reality check movie
series", is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year,
The Matrix and eXistenZ.  All three made you think, made you wonder what is
real, what isn't, and if our world is just a huge game.  The Thirteenth Floor
doesn't reach the level of originality, creativity, and curiosity sparked by
The Matrix and eXistenZ, but it certainly gives a great shot at it.  In The
Matrix, we were told that the humans are simply a virus.  In eXistenZ, we
learned that our life could be just a game.  In The Thirteenth Floor, we learn
that we are just electronic devices, living under another world of electronic
devices.  There is just one world on top of another, and everything in them are
fake and electronically generated.
The Thirteenth Floor took a huge, risky turn that I didn't expect it to take,
and I'm not very sure it was such a great turn to make.  Rather than focusing
just on the reality parts of the film, The Thirteenth Floor becomes a murder
mystery that ends up tying in with the different worlds.  After the mysterious
murder of computer program designer Hammond Fuller, played by Armin
Mueller-Stahl, Douglas Hall, played by Craig Bierko, a man that worked under
Fuller for many years, must travel through an electronic computer device that
Fuller was using, to the year 1937, which consists of computer generated
characters only.  The simulation of 1937 is just like it was back in the olden
days.  All of the people involved are just characters, or are they?  Douglas
strongly believes that a character traveled through the transport from their
world to ours, and killed Fuller.  Along the way, Douglas interacts with many
different potential suspects, and a woman who claims to be the daughter of
Fuller, Jane Fuller, played wonderfully by a talented young actress, Gretchen
Mol.
The Thirteenth Floor is a plot driven movie from the time the film gets going,
and doesn't use spectacular special effects and big sound to keep the viewer's
interests.  I was worried that this film would be too much like The Matrix and
eXistenZ, and I wouldn't enjoy it, but there were enough twists and turns to
keep me thinking and attentive to the film.  Unfortunately, many potential
would have been great scenes were thrown away with predictable content, letting
the viewer know the outcome of the scene long before it happened.  The scenes
that aren't original or interesting seem to go absolutely nowhere, leaving you
wondering, " What is the point of this?"  
Sometimes it was hard to believe that this story, with terrible dialogue, some
bad acting, especially from Craig Bierko, and scenes that go absolutely
nowhere, are actually true.  I know this isn't a true story or anything, but a
film should be able to make you think that it is.  On the plus side of acting,
we get to see the missing from main character action since the film masterpiece
Shine in 1995 actor, Armin Mueller-Stahl. In The Thirteenth Floor, he is back
and is still giving believable and amazing performances.  Another plus is
Gretchen Mol's realistic performance, creating her character with depth, not
just staying in the one-dimensional phase.
Don't expect the intensity of The Matrix or eXistenZ to come out of The
Thirteenth Floor, just expect another film that messes with your mind for
awhile, and shuts you down like any other movie would.  Thrills, chills, and
spills aren't what you will get in this film, but you will just get another
trip to send your mind on, scrambling it until you've had enough.  
The Bottom Line- Let's hope this is the last of the "reality check" based
movies for awhile.

THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR (M).  
(Columbia Tristar)
Director: Josef Rusnak
Stars: Craig Bierko, Gretchen Mol, Vincent D'Onofrio, Armin 
Mueller-Stahl, Dennis Haysbert, Steven Schub, Leon Rippy
Running time: 100 minutes.
Michael Crichton's Westworld sounded the first cautionary
warning about the possibilities of what could happen when a
computerised theme park ran out of control.  His Jurassic Park updated
the concept, with its additional theme of man tampering with nature.
Tron further blurred the distinctions between reality and virtual
reality within the framework of a computer game out of control.  The
Lawnmower Man and its hideous sequel explored the potential of virtual
reality, as did the nasty, straight- to-video thriller Brainscan.
David Cronenberg's upcoming Existenz also taps into a similar theme,
albeit from a more intellectual perspective.
But it was the recent and ambitious, high-tech The Matrix that
brilliantly blurred the distinction between the real world and a
computer generated virtual world with a barrage of the best cinematic
special effects seen this year.  This new thriller from producer
Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, Godzilla, etc) and colleague Josef
Rusnak, who worked as second-unit director on Godzilla, also explores
a similar theme.  However, The Thirteenth Floor is a high concept idea
given a low brow execution, and it will leave most audiences feeling
even more confused than The Matrix.  At least The Matrix was
sufficiently intriguing and dazzling that it drew many back for a
second viewing to puzzle out its intricacies.  The Thirteenth Floor is
unlikely to have the same effect, as once is definitely enough for
this disappointing blend of sci-fi and murder mystery.
Computer genius and soft-ware developer Hannon Fuller (Armin
Mueller-Stahl) has developed a virtual reality program that enables
him to recreate his own imaginary world.  He has recreated his own
vision of Los Angeles, circa 1937, which he visits at regular
intervals through this new technology.  But then something goes wrong
and subjects from his virtual reality world become able to interact
with his real world, with devastating results.
When Fuller is brutally murdered, his collaborator Douglas
Hall (Craig Bierko, from The Long Kiss Goodnight, etc) becomes the
chief suspect.  His attempts to understand what has gone wrong lead
him and his technical programmer Whitney (Vincent D'Onofrio) into a
world of danger, murder and technological mayhem.  It also leads him
to the beautiful but elusive Jane (Gretchen Mol, from Rounders, etc).
But Hall soon discovers that Fuller's artificial world may not be the
only one, and that other people, with more sinister agendas, are also
able to move between worlds, manipulating events to their own perverse
design.
Eventually, this complex film raises a few questions about
technology out of control, and even forces us to question what is real
and what is not.  Ultimately though, the plot has a number of holes
that can't be disguised by technology or whiz bang effects, and
director Rusnak fails to create a genuinely unnerving atmosphere.
Even the special effects here are rather routine, given recent
achievements in sophisticated computer generated imagery.  However,
the recreation of Los Angeles of yesteryear is quite spectacularly
done, and Wedigo von Schultzendorff's muted, washed-out cinematography
is quite atmospheric.
The performances throughout are rather bland.  Mol looks as
though she is sleepwalking through her dual role, while D'Onofrio does
his usual angry young man thing with a frightening intensity and
flair.  Even they seem as unconvinced by all this nonsense as the
audience!
