   Does America produce too much wealth, and do too many
Americans make too much money?  Of course not. 
Production and accumulation of wealth are not the problems. 
The issue is consumption--what we do to get that wealth and
what we do with the money we make.  Left-leaning critics of
the American way point to the manner the powerful U.S.
arrogates to itself the right to make decisions for other
countries (the Vietnam War as the principal example), to what
the country must do to continue extracting abundance from
both the land and its people (pollute the land, create ugly
malls, inundate the air waves with moronic commercials), to
the selfish attitude that prevents the world's mightiest nation
from considering the inequities of the income produced both
at home and abroad.
   A good deal of this reproach was reflected in the literature,
theater and movies of the 1970s, at the time that Kurt
Vonnegut, Jr. wrote "Breakfast of Champions" (1973) to
append his convictions to the political climate.  Antonioni's
"Zabriskie Point," which hit the screens in 1970, is a
foreigner's take on the aggressive, materialistic style of living,
a film written partly by Sam Shepard.  Stuart Hagmann's "The
Strawberry Statement," which came out as well that year,
treats the Columbia University riots, the sometimes violent
demonstrations by privileged kids against the allegedly racist
nature of the school's administration.
   The corruption that has accompanied American prosperity
has not gone away, though serious attempts have been tried
to make the distribution of income more equitable and to cut
back the destruction of the air, land and water.  Despite all
the shots we've taken, the air waves are still desecrated by
mindless commercials for inconsequential products, the span
between the higher earners and the poor is the greatest in
the industrialized world, and large corporations are drowning
small stores while downsizing workers and homogenizing the
cities and suburbs with tasteless malls.  Pointing out these
evils, "Breakfast of Champions," a novel considered by some
to be impossible to film, has been captured for the screen by
Alan Rudolph--a director noted for experimentation with indie
films like "Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle," "Afterglow,"
and "Welcome to L.A."  Considering the absolutely non-
commercial nature of his "Breakfast with Champions," we can
imagine that its all-star cast must have taken far less than
their usual compensation for doing the movie, one which
comes across as so off-the-wall zany and surreal that its
targeted audience would have to be a small one indeed.  
   Aside from the difficulties you can expect from the
nonlinear narrative, aiming at targets not as a sharpshooter
would but as would a farmer firing a shotgun full of buckshot
flying hither and thither, "Breakfast" ridicules profanities too
familiar to be shocking in our own time as they were when
the novel was published.  Filmed by Elliot Davis as though
the genre were a Merry Melodies cartoon shot by John
Waters and not a genuine dispatch by live actors, "Breakfast
of Champions" centers on the bespectacled and toupeed
Dwayne Hoover (Bruce Willis), the principal celebrity of the
town of Midland City (filmed in Twin Falls, Idaho) by virtue of
his near monopoly of local TV commercials for his car
dealership.  "You can trust Dwayne Hoover," is his motto, an
obvious giveaway to a knowing movie audience for his
probable debauchery.  He is in the midst of a nervous
breakdown, wondering "who am I?" and about to eat his gun,
when he is called to the table by the maid for his breakfast of
champions--a large plate of fried eggs, bacon, pancakes,
potatoes and toast.  (Later in the film, the titled breakfast of
champions would become a martini.)  
   Because of his total attention to his dealership, he has
distanced himself from his depressed and suicidal wife, Celia
(Barbara Hershey) but is to be powerfully affected later on by
an aging, sardonic writer of sci-fi novels, Kilgore Trout (Albert
Finney--who is in some ways a stand-in for Mr. Vonnegut),
who travels to Midland City to receive an award during the
town's first arts festival.
   Every character in Alan Rudolph's land of plastic, polyester
and all-around schlock is nuts, and Rudolph must have had a
grand time characterizing Harry Le Sabre (Nick Nolte),
secretly a transvestite who dresses like a mortician during the
day to cover up his problem; Francine (Glenne Headly), who
works as Hoover's receptionist and pliable girl friend; and
Wayne Hoobler (Omar Epps), an ex-convict who looks up to
the materially successful Hoover as though the salesman
were the creator of the universe.  When the cranky Kilgore
Trout looks about him at the pretentiousness, the phoniness,
the polluted waters, the very sterility of the place, we do not
wonder that he envisions an alternate world, a tropical
paradise free from capitalism's messes, where he can
become young and innocent again.
   Rudolph certainly means well, having the grit to make this
movie from a novel whose criticisms of society are still valid
but whose shape is old-hat.  And the first-rate cast including
Bruce Willis, Nick Nolte, Glenne Headley, and Barbara
Hershey are to be honored for contributing to the effort at a
presumably lower pay scale that they would customarily
require.  But "Breakfast of Champions" is so chaotic that after
twenty minutes you can easily lose patience for its
scattershot arrangement and redundant reproaches.  For a
more sober approach to the issue, go back to the classics
and open Sinclair Lewis's "Babbitt" (1922), about a man from
the twenties who likewise lived in a town of standardized
architecture and interior decorations who, for a time, was
reborn during a trip to Maine but who later fell back to his
habitually reactionary and insular ways.

"Nobody's Happy. They're just trying to sell you something."
Breakfast of Champions.
Like it or not, this is an interesting film. I have the feeling that it's
going to be one of those pictures some people just love, while others just
love to hate.
Put it in the odd comedy genre. You know: "Rushmore," "Life Less Ordinary."
Though mostly a dark comedy, this film's got a wonderful sideways feel;
riding like a stunt car up on its two side wheels. In fact, I felt like a
stunt viewer. Not sure what to expect from that teetering perspective, I
still had fun even while suspending worries of the car flopping back down or
over before the end of the trials.
Too bad, that's exactly what happens to "Breakfast of Champions." Perhaps a
shade cockier than necessary, it extended it's own test course (by 20
needless minutes) falling on all fours with just about that much time left
in the film. A harsh disappointment after such an exhilarating ride.
Still, Bruce Willis (as the suicidal car dealer/celebrity) and especially
Nick Nolte give great performances. Actually, Nolte's performance as Willis'
right-hand, dress-wearing man at the dealership deserves Oscar
recognition -- and you can quote me on that.
Starring Bruce Willis, Nick Nolte, Glenne Headly, Barbara Hershey, Albert
Finney, Omar Epps and Lukas Haas. Director/Screenwriter Alan Rudolph.

Breakfast of Champions
Directed by:  Alan Rudolph
Starring: Bruce Willis, Albert Finney, Nick Nolte, Vicki Lewis,
Barbara Hershey, Glenne Headly, Lukas Haas, Omar Epps, Buck Henry,
Ken Campbell, Jake Johannsen
Running time:  110 minutes
My rating (5 star scale):  ****
This film is based on the novel by Kurt Vonnegut.  Since Vonnegut's
novels don't have straightforward plots or easy to understand
characters, the movies made from them are complicated and not
exactly mainstream.  Which makes the appearance of so many big stars
in this film very surprising.
Fresh from his success in The Sixth Sense, a film in which
he rarely spoke above a whisper and had no action scenes, Willis comes
to a film where he is often shouting and engages in a lot of action.
But it still isn't a typical Willis movie.  There are no terrorists,
no bombs, no bad guys.  Instead, we have a town full of people who
are going mad.  Some have already gone there.  Dwayne Hoover (Willis)
is a successful car dealer whose family life is a shambles. His wife 
is clearly ill and popping pills. His son goes by the name of Bunny
and was a big disappointment at military school.  His mistress is
more interested in getting a chicken franchise than having sex.  His
sales manager (Nolte) is a secret cross dresser.  And coming to see 
them is Kilgore Trout, hack writer deemed genius by Elliot Rosewater.
The movie follows Hoover's search for the meaning life. A question
he hopes Trout can answer.  It does a good job of emulating the 
inchoate style of Vonnegut's books.  Willis and Nolte do a great 
job of portraying their psychologically damaged characters.  And
Albert Finney is exactly what I imagined Kilgore Trout to be.
I've seen some negative reviews of this movie and I think it is one
you will either love or hate.  I've also seen some people claim it 
is a ripoff of Brazil.  You can only reach that conclusion if you 
have never seen a movie other than Brazil.

For your own protection, keep your arms and legs inside this movie review at
all times. No smoking will be allowed, although you really shouldn't enter
the premises without the proper mind-sponging substance floating through
your great white yonder, and prepare to meet the man some refer to as Dwayne
Hoover, or his master of creation, Kilgore Trout. This is the story about a
man and his dog. Well...actually...it isn't!
PLOT:
Used car salesman extraordinaire Dwayne Hoover loses his identity in the
midst of a massive mid-life crisis which leads him to cheat on his wife,
whose hooked on pills, attempt to kill himself every other day, and seek out
the answer to the questions in his mind. Very few answers follow.
CRITIQUE:
Bubble, pill, bubble, pill, bubble. Exit 11, take a left please. This film
is based on the apparent "unfilmable" novel written by one Kurt Vonnegut Jr.
Much like last year's unfilmable film FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS (7/10),
it offers much style and esoteric gobbledygook in a narrative which cannot
be described as anything more (or less) than incomprehensible. The
ladieswear department is down by the last aisle, sir. I personally enjoyed
the film on the level in which it was obviously meant to be taken...a
spiritually enlightening chemically-induced psychedelic soul searching
vehicle, in which many people seem to float through the floors, see images
of paradise reflecting from the mirrors, death looming, and bubble with
overly fake enthusiasm/depression. You can call me Bunny, dad. Strobe,
strobe. Don't call me Dwayne, it's Wayne, Wayne Hoobler...like Dwayne
Hoover, you know! Crying won't help, but an apparent big dick and sex with
the secretary f**k machine will? Good soundtrack. The answer for Hoover
obviously lies within life itself. Spiraling lights and a nice, olived marti
ni. Take two!
The actors were all very good in this film, with Bruce Willis standing out
in another very different role for him. He plays this cartoon character very
well and never draws his colors outside of the idiosyncratic line born to be
this person. Dwayne Hoover~?! Is that you~?!! Why don't you just come out
and say it, "I wear women's clothing and I like it!". Nick Nolte is awesome!
His role in this film rivals any in his career! Expect Mr. Nolte to walk
away with many more high award recognitions this year. Best worst part. And
no more goodbye to Blue Mondays after this movie, that's for sure.
Hardy-har-har, Mr. Trout! If that's your "real name" . I also
enjoyed the style of the film which was basically its only actual film
component, seeing that the substance was only to be discovered through two
highly enriched characters named Mary Jane and Lucy in the Sky with
Diamonds. Thirty-six bucks for a car?! You got it!
I personally will be adding this film to my collection of "high" level
quality productions which one could only truly appreciate when-is that
BIRDSH*T on my car?!! All in all, I would say that I had quite a few laughs,
no serious moments whatsoever, passed the two hour runtime like it was a
five-minute trip through the dentist's waiting room (Top floor, of course),
and appreciated the cooky-wooky soundtrack. Last stop in Brownsville. I love
you and life should be lived while attending life! Please remove your
seatbelts on your way out and make sure to move your hands away from the
aisles. This review has now ended. Thank you for flying in our friendly high
skies. Please check the rating on your way out.
(7/10) --> If you actually understood and appreciated aspects of this review
and enjoy puzzles.
(5/10) --> If you didn't understand and DO NOT WANT TO understand any aspect
of this review, and do not like puzzles.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
This might explain a few things about this movie: Novelist Kurt Vonnegut Jr.
once attended College with fellow author Dr. Seuss (Theodore Geisel). Think
about it? Remember all that Who-hash from THE GRINCH WHO STOLE CHRISTMAS?
Vonnegut Jr., on whose novel this film is based, also makes an appearance in
this movie as the "TV commercial director". He was born in 1922.
This is Nick Nolte's second time in a film based on a Vonnegut Jr. novel.
His first was 1996's MOTHER NIGHT.
Director Alan Rudolph and Bruce Willis had previously worked together in the
1991 film MORTAL THOUGHTS co-starring Bruce's then-wife Demi Moore.
Co-producer David Willis is, you guessed it, Bruce Willis' real-life
brother. He has been involved as a producer on 9 movies since 1990, 7 of
which starred his big-shot brother in one way or another. You go, girl!
This film was nominated for a Golden Berlin Bear award at the 1999 Berlin
International Film Festival.

Susan Granger's review of "BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS" (Buena Vista Pictures)
   Writer/director Alan Rudolph has attempted to make a deep,
dark comedy out of Kurt Vonnegut's satiric '70s fable - and has failed
to such an extent that it's an embarrassment for all concerned. Bruce
Willis plays a suicidal car dealer, Dwayne Hoover, a minor celebrity
in Midland City since his commercials seem to play non-stop on local
television. His pill-popping wife (Barbara Hersey) is clinically
depressed, and his gay son (Lukas Haas) is an aspiring lounge singer.
Is that why Dwayne thinks he's losing his mind? We're not really
sure. Meanwhile, his devoted secretary (Glenne Headley) doubles as his
hot-to-trot mistress and his sales manager (Nick Nolte) is a troubled
transvestite. (Nick's legs do look sensational in sheer black
stockings!)  Plus there's a pollution scandal. In the midst of this
muddled mess, the town decides to honor a mumbling, misunderstood
pulpy science-fiction writer named Kilgore Trout (Albert Finney) at
its first arts festival. "Midland City is ready for a renaissance, and
you shall be our Leonardo," gushes his sponsor. Predictably, when
Dwayne Hoover meets Kilgore Trout (Kurt Vonnegut's alter ego), he
discovers the meaning of life and achieves some kind of bewildering
redemption. Appropriately, the '50s ballad "Stranger in Paradise" is
an integral part of the soundtrack, repeatedly underscoring the
bizarre caricatures and surreal situation. Like Terry Gilliam's
adaptation of Hunter Thompson's "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas," Alan
Rudolph's attempt to dramatize Vonnegut's zany '60s protest fantasy
seems distorted and woefully out of date. On the Granger Movie Gauge
of 1 to 10, "Breakfast of Champions" is a crude, crass, incoherent 2.
Flaky, tasteless breakfasts like this could lead to indigestion!

     The word `unfilmable' is often bandied about over cult classic
books.  That never stops people from filming them.
     Witness THE ENGLISH PATIENT, which turned out to be filmable after
all.  And then there was FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS, which wasn't.
But maybe unfilmable is the wrong word.  BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS might
have proved filmable, but it sure isn't watchable.
     This, of course, saddens me greatly.  Kurt Vonnegut is my favorite
author ever, and BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS was his first book that I read.
It made enough of an impression for me to track down his entire oeuvre,
which I have devoured.  This film just shouldn't have been made, sadly.
Take CAT'S CRADLE (his second-best work) next time Â that ought to make
a great film.
     Why is this BREAKFAST so bad?  Because the book is about
craziness.  Dwayne Hoover (Willis) is a crazy auto salesman, married to
a crazy wife (Hershey), and he becomes obsessed with a crazy sci-fi
writer named Kilgore Trout (Finney).  Trout's sales manager (Nolte) is
also a crazy guy that likes to dress in women's lingerie, and his
secretary (Headley) isn't all together.  Oh, and Trout's son (Haas)
wants to be a lounge singer named Bunny.
     What made the book so good is that you can go inside these
characters, heads, plus Vonnegut's writing style is so nutty that it all
actually works.  Director Rudolph tries to do this, too, with wacky
camera angles, digital effects, and other tricks, but none of this
works.  In fact, it's just annoying and is barely entertaining for even
a minute.  A couple of wisecracks aside, this BREAKFAST is unedible.

_Breakfast_of_Champions_ (R) no stars (out of ****)
        If you're debating whether or not to see _Breakfast_of_Champions_, ask
yourself one simple question: do you want to see Nick Nolte in lingerie? 
The only people who would get much enjoyment from Alan Rudolph's chaotic
adaptation of the Kurt Vonnegut novel is the cross-section of the
population with the unhealthy urge to see that unpleasant sight. 
Everyone else--and I'm hoping that's most people--would be wise to steer
clear of this excrutiatingly unfunny mess.
        Actually, though, the sight of Nolte in high heels is one of the more
amusing things about this muddle, which focuses Dwayne Hoover (Bruce
Willis), the owner of Dwayne Hoover's Exit 11 Motor Village in Midland
City.  Not only is he a huge success as a businessman, he's also
something of a celebrity, his face made recognizable by an ongoing series
of television commercials.  With a nice home and family to boot, Dwayne
appears to have it all the ingredients to be happy--yet he's not.  His
wife Celia (Barbara Hershey) is perpetually in a pill-induced haze; his
son George (Lukas Haas) is a flamboyant lounge singer who goes by the
stage name "Bunny."  Not only that, the Environmental Protection Agency
is on Dwayne's ass over a building development project.  It's enough to
send Dwayne on a nervous breakdown--that is, if he doesn't succeed in
blowing his brains out first.
        Meanwhile, Midland City is about to host a fine arts festival, and the
guest of honor is one Kilgore Trout (Albert Finney), a writer who is far
from the renowned author the festival's organizer (Buck Henry) was led to
believe--in fact, he's a penniless hack who writes second-rate sci-fi
that appears in porn magazines.  His trek to Midland City is also a
spiritual journey, one that reaches its apex after meeting Dwayne, who
for some reason thinks that Trout will hold for him all of life's
answers.
        The above is already a longer plot synopsis than I usually give in my
reviews, but, ironically, I have barely scratched the surface.  I haven't
yet mentioned Wayne Hoobler (Omar Epps), an ex-con with an obsessive
admiration for the similarly-named Dwayne.  Then there's the matter of
Francine (Glenne Headly), Dwayne's devoted secretary.  Not to mention
Dwayne's employee and old friend Harry LeSabre (Nolte), the one with the
secret penchant for cross-dressing.  And so on.  The film is essentially
Dwayne's story, but too often Rudolph goes on distracting tangents with
the eccentric peripheral players that one often wonders what the point
is.
        Rudolph does arrive at a point (more on that later), but it's blunted
and obscured by his hyperactive approach to the material.  The surreal
visual style, complete with printed words flying through the air and into
Dwayne's ears, is obviously meant to convey a sense of madness, but its
bludgeoning nature is likely to make viewers mad.  The actors are called
on to act accordingly, resulting in some of the worst, most overdone work
all of them have ever turned in.  Willis fares best of all--but that's
because his frozen expression of befuddled bewilderment mirrors that of
the audience.
        With such an aggressively outrageous atmosphere for nearly all of its
running time, it comes as a shock when things suddenly turn serious, and
Rudolph tries to make a statement.  Unlike _American_Beauty_ (a film that
_Breakfast_ resembles in more than a few ways, to its great detriment),
there isn't any palpably earnest undercurrent that would prepare the
audience for the big shift.  As such, the cartoony characters fail to win
a sympathy that needs to be earned; and the film attempts, to no avail,
to reach a profundity that it doesn't deserve.
        Vonnegut's original novel is considered a classic, but it had been
called unfilmable--the same that was said of Hunter S. Thompson's
_Fear_and_Loathing_in_Las_Vegas_, which was disastrously committed to
film last year by Terry Gilliam.  With the similar failure of
_Breakfast_of_Champions_, will Hollywood ever learn that books labeled
"unfilmable" inevitably results in a film that is unwatchable?  Likely
not.

CrankyCriticÅ½ movie reviews: Breakfast of  Champions
Rated  [R]
Starring Bruce Willis, Albert Finney, Nick Nolte, Barbara Hershey,
Glenne Headly, Lukas Haas and Omar Epps
Screenplay by Alan Rudolph
Based on the novel by  Kurt Vonnegut
Directed by Alan Rudolph

IN SHORT: Like eating Tang straight from the bottle
As a rule CrankyCritic.com doesn't compare to Source Material, but we
will make these observations: Among Cranky's favorite authors are Hunter
Thompson, whose work doesn't translate to the big screen. Neither does
Tom Robbins. Tom Wolfe is batting .500. I keep waiting for someone to
take a Kurt Vonnegut story and get some of the madness and
totally-perfect-for-the-page-and-only-the-page storytelling therein,
wrestle it to the ground and figure out how to stuff it into the
celluloid frame in a way that doesn't require immersion in the published
text. The wait continues.
Writer/Director Alan Rudolph sure has pumped some of the craziness onto
the big screen in his adaptation of Breakfast of Champions, but the fact
remains that Vonnegut doesn't translate. Part of it has to do with the
fact that the cultural climate of his most famous work included the post
WWII parents of Vietnam era kidlets and all the nutzoid schisms of the
60s. Thirty years later, give or take, the touchstones don't ring with
the same vibrancy. Well, maybe in California . . .
But the location on the map reads Midland City, which looks very much
like Twin Falls Idaho, a town with Dwayne Hoover's (Bruce Willis)
massive car lot on one side and the expansion settlement called Sugar
Creek -- built on a toxic waste dump -- on the other. In between is a
major traffic jam. Hoover's wife Celia (Barbara Hershey) is zonked out
on a tranquilizing medication called RelaxÂ. His son George (Lukas
Haas) prefers to be called Bunny, after his slippers and backpack, and
entertains the local patrons and various adulterers at the AmeriRest
Inn, coincidentally owned by and patronized by Dwayne, and dedicated
secretary Francine Pefko (Glenne Headly). Wait, there's more . . .
Frank Le Sabre (Nick Nolte), Duane's sales manager, likes to wear
women's clothing. Frank's dominating better half (Vicki Lewis) wants to
move to Maui. And there's an ex-con named Wayne Hoobler (Omar Epps)
idolizing the similarly named Dwayne Hoover living in a car on the lot.
Not to mention the looming presence of an EPA investigation of Sugar
Creek, or the Midland Arts Fair featuring "world renowned" author
Kilgore Trout (Albert Finney), who believes mirrors are better called
"Leaks" because parallel universes leak into each other via their
reflective properties. Or something. It is only when Hoover meets Trout,
is a sort of sanity and understanding imparted into a world which has
pushed him to the brink of eating a .38 shell for lunch.
Trout, whose work is published as filler in porno magazines of the type
not seen since the 50s, is a recurring character in Vonnegut's books as
a reflection of the author, so I've read. Finney says Vonnegut told him
to go out and create a character. What Finney delivers is the only
"sane" performance in a story that is otherwise about going insane. Of
course, Trout looks and rants like a paranoid homeless person as he
hitchhikes towards Midland City. This performance, grounded in reality,
is the one I walked away happy with. But it's been many years since I
avidly devoured Vonnegut, and my brain turned to mush long ago. I should
have liked Breakfast of Champions more, but I didn't.
It is strongly recommended that you read the book first.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Breakfast of Champions, he would
have paid...
Rent it. Trafalmador is never mentioned, but you get a glimpse of it at
the end of the flick, if I remember my books correctly. If not, it still
doesn't mean much to the overall scheme of things.
