Reviewed by Dustin Putman, May 20, 2000.
Last November, audiences who went to see "Toy Story 2" were treated to an 
advanced look at this summer's tentpole Disney animated feature, "Dinosaur." 
A beautiful and majestic peek at the world when dinosaurs ruled the Earth, 
the trailer was awe-inspiring not only because of its revolutionary step 
forward in visual effects (placing lifelike computer-generated characters in 
largely live-action settings), but also because, for once, it seemed as if 
Disney was growing up themselves. It should have been self-evident that the 
studio had not matured that much, as "Dinosaur" misleadingly appeared to be 
dialogue-free and a fairly realistic glimpse into the Jurassic era. Instead, 
what Disney chose to do with this supposed-to-be-insurrectionary family film 
is they not only gave the dinosaur characters' voices, but they implanted 
them in a story that has been recycled in practically every other animated 
Disney movie ever made, but with only one-tenth of the charm and 
entertainment value. The animation may be the most realistic created, but 
that is where the compliments stop for the abysmally featherbrained 
"Dinosaur."
The sweeping prologue (the only section that spares us stock character 
voices), in which an Iguadon egg becomes misplaced from its mother's nest, 
and through a series of circumstances, ends its journey on an island 
primarily populated by Lemurs, tiny, kind, monkey-like creatures, is as 
imaginative as this picture gets. When they egg hatches, there is a moment of 
pause by the Lemurs due to the Iguadon's nature to be a meat-eater, but soon 
they have adopted him and named him Aladar (voiced by D.B. Sweeney). Time 
passes and just as Aladar has grown a little older, and a lot larger, tragedy 
strikes. Narrowly escaping, a violent meteor shower (visually reminiscent of 
the bomb dropped on Hiroshima) wipes out their entire island. While trekking 
through a wide, desolate expansion of dry, open ground, Aladar and his four 
Lemur family members join a group of dinosaurs traveling to a green, more 
healthy and peaceful place to live, headed by the gruff Kron (Samuel E. 
Wright).
"Dinosaur" has too many problems to count, but one of its biggest is that the 
story, written by John Harrison and Robert Nelson Jacobs, was never fully 
thought out. In fact, there is very little in the way of a plot to speak of, 
and, aside from having to ward off two violent T-Rex-lookalike Carnotaurs, no 
true dilemmas to overcome. The film almost immediately shoots down the 
hopeful notion that it would present a serious look at the alleged nature of 
dinosaurs, and their interactions with the different species', opting to tell 
an awkward PG-rated kiddie flick that undiscriminating children will enjoy, 
but will likely leave all other viewers out in the cold.
There are certain elements that define the quintessential animated Disney 
film. They are usually inhabited with memorable characters; a rightfully 
nasty and original villain; have a great deal of heart; are filled with 
musical numbers that the characters carry out in all their glory; and are 
superbly animated. "Dinosaur" does away with the musical numbers, which is a 
somewhat amiable change of pace, but bars the picture from having any other 
defining or noteworthy qualities outside of its technical skill in the 
animation arena. Meanwhile, "Dinosaur" is wholly devoid of the three former 
Disney attributes. 
Unlike Minnie Driver in 1999's far superior "Tarzan" or Demi Moore in 1996's 
"The Hunchback of Notre Dame," the voice work, supplied by several well-known 
actors (i.e. Julianna Margulies, Joan Plowright, Alfre Woodard, etc.), is 
forgettable, and just like the ho-hum direction by Ralph Zondag and Eric 
Leighton, their hearts simply do not seem into this project. The writing does 
not help, as the characters are purely disposable and have few defining 
personality features to tell them apart, and, most importantly, remember them 
once the lights go up.
At 82 minutes, almost ten of which are taken up by the end credits, 
"Dinosaur" is almost over before it begins, and good riddance. A crushing 
bore in the story and character department, and not taking full advantage of 
its grandiose vision (save for the astounding opening and the meteor shower 
sequence), "Dinosaur" is a distressingly lifeless concoction. The fact that 
it holds so much promise makes the outcome all the more calamitous.

Disney's annual kiddie-pic summer extravaganzas are usually pretty sure
things box-office-wise, but Dinosaur is a whole different story.  First,
the Mouse House bumped up its customary mid-June release date for the
weekend before Memorial Day.  Then they hired a screenwriter with an
extensive background in horror films to pen the story, which has
resulted in Dinosaur nabbing an un-Disney-esque `PG' rating (the same as
Woody Allen's film, which is being released the same day).  Oh, and
there's also the little issue of recouping the money it cost to make the
film, which has been rumored to be in the $150-200 million range (it
cost $80 million just to build the facility where the film was created).
Kids, of course, don't give a flying fig about a film's price tag.  What
they do care about is seeing cute, cuddly creatures with funny voices
and promotional tie-ins at fast-food chains and toys that they can get
their parents to buy simply by threatening to hold their breath until
they turn blue.  And I'm just not sure that Dinosaur is that film.  Like
Antz, the creatures in this film are downright unattractive, and if
Dinosaur pulls in numbers much higher than its CG animated predecessor,
you will literally be able to see heads rolling down South Buena Vista
Street.
Dinosaur begins with the breathtaking ten-minute minute journey of an
Iguanodon egg from its mother's nest to a tree inhabited by a tribe of
lemurs.  There's no dialogue for this segment of the film, which makes
it even more appealing as viewers will be able to fully concentrate on
the computer-generated creatures inserted over real backgrounds.  But
once the egg hatches, the ugly things start talking.  The head lemur,
Yar (Ossie Davis, Doctor Dolittle), sees the baby Aladar as a dangerous,
cold-blooded monster, but he eventually decides to raise him like a son.
Flash forward several years, where Aladar (D.B. Sweeney, Fox's cancelled
Harsh Realm) is now several times larger than even the largest lemur. He
watches sadly as the boy primates and girl primates practice mating
rituals, fully knowing that he'll never find one of his own to fall in
love with.  Then a meteor hits, and the world bursts into flames,
leaving Aladar and the surviving lemurs to flee through a Nam-like
flaming jungle, where they run into a herd of various plant-eating
dinosaurs looking for a new nesting ground.
Although Aladar has never even seen another dinosaur, he gets to
experience the full gamut of dealing with his own species, from
bureaucracy (butting heads with militaristic head dinosaur Kron), to
love (Kron's sister Neera [Julianna Margulies, ER]), to pity (by helping
older, slower dinosaurs Eema [Della Reese, Touched By An Angel] and
Baylene [Joan Plowright, Tea With Mussolini]), to fear (being stalked by
two blood-thirsty Carnotaurs).
Dinosaur will be way too scary for some young kids (several were howling
during my screening, and many families left early).  Maybe Disney
thought that the whole running-through-the-burning-forest thing would be
okay because they already did it in Bambi.  But here, it's more like
Hell on Earth.  And the Carnotaurs are a little too much.  Dinosaur was
co-directed by Ralph Zondag (We're Back!  A Dinosaur's Story) and
first-timer Eric Leighton, who previously worked as an animator on the
creepy films James & the Giant Peach and The Nightmare Before
Christmas.  The script was co-written by Robert Nelson Jacobs (Out to
Sea) and John Harrison, who is best known for his work in the horror
industry (Tales From the Crypt, Creepshow).
Thanks to the cost of producing a CG film, Dinosaur clocks in at a lean
eighty-two minutes and offers no superfluous plot.  The voice work is
merely adequate, with Marguiles, Sweeney and Alfre Woodard (Love &
Basketball) particularly unstriking.
1:22 - PG for intense images and violence

 Dinosaur (2000) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Featuring the vocal talents of
D.B. Sweeney, Ossie Davis, Alfre Woodard, Max Casella, Hayden Panettier,
Julianna Margulies, Joan Plowrightand Della Reese
 Disney's latest  creation, "Dinosaur," is a magical meld of digitally
enhanced live-action photography, special effects and computer animated
wonder.
 Though a bit ragged on the technical side, the film showcases a simple
story with a moral that the younger members of the audience can
understand and appreciate, plus some heroic and amusing characters with
whom they can relate.
 The story is reminiscent of the animated "Land Before Time" of several
years ago: A group of dinosaurs seek a legendary verdant valley
containing enough food and water to sustain them.
 "Dinosaur" follows the adventures of an Iguanodon named Aladar (voiced
by D.B. Sweeney) who is separated from his own species as a hatchling
and adopted by a tribe of Lemurs.
 Years later, a catastrophic event forces the family to flee and join up
with a herd of dinosaurs searching for a safe nesting ground.
 In a sense, the movie is anti-Darwinian. Its message that survival of
the fittest is a brutal misconception, while standing together and
cooperation - the mighty protecting the weak - makes for a more viable
and stronger community, is a lesson the children will easily grasp.
 Moreso than the special effects, it is the characters who drive
"Dinosaur."
 Besides Aladar, there is his Lemur parents, Yar (Ossie Davis) and Plio
(Alfre Woodard); his best pal, Zini (Max Casella); sister, Suri (Hayden
Panettiere); and the friends they make on the trek, Neera (Julianna
Margulies), another Iguanodon; Baylene (Joan Plowright), an elderly,
dignified Brachiosuar; and Eema (Della Reese), a gruff, but lovable
Styrachosaur.
 The movie's real stars, though, are the various technicians who
recreated the world of 65 million years ago. Though the effects are
sometimes dark and murky, the Disney team has created such
fully-developed creatures, plus some beautiful vistas that you tend to
gloss over the rough spots.
 Aided by a rousing score by James Newton Howard, which contains echoes
of a previous Disney winner, "The Lion King," "Dinosaur" is a movie that
will engross the younger set.
 One concession I really appreciated is that none of the dinosaurs nor
Lemurs break into song and dance. That would have been a bit too much,
even for an animated feature.
 Though it contains some violence, "Dinosaur" is basically a
good-hearted saga, and at a little under 90 minutes, it will hold the
attention of the youngest viewer.
 "Dinosaur" is basically a family movie. Adults will find it simplistic,
but they will enjoy it if they see it with their children. And an
entertaining movie with a moral is always a good bet for a family
outing.
 "Dinosaur" is not as colorful as "Tarzan," nor does it pack the
emotional wallop of "The Lion King, "but it does provide breathtaking
scenery, the latest in special effects and lovable characters.
 You can't lose with this combination.

A boy dinosaur is raised by monkey-like creatures and takes on their 
charming, playful personality. When
the dino and his family find themselves struggling for survival with a pack 
of dinosaurs the film turns into a
preachy debate over Darwinian philosophies. 
Parents, don't be fooled, this isn't "Toy Story" with dinosaurs, it's pretty 
much a soap opera and a horror
movie meant for children. Since there's dinosaurs you know there's going to 
be the friendly, cute ones we
love versus the huge, ugly, scary monsters that make a lot of noise and want 
to eat our heroes. At least that
would be original, which is more than I can say for the script which is so 
lame and boring it just keeps
wandering for most of the film without much characterization or point. The 
battle scenes are pretty intense
and will probably scare younger children.

Year: 2000. Starring the voices of D.B. Sweeney, Julianna Margulies, 
Joan Plowright, Ossie Davis, Max Casella, Alfre Woodard, Samuel E. 
Wright, Peter Siragusa, Della Reese. Story by Thom Enriquez, John 
Harrison, Robert Nelson Jacobs, Ralph Zondag. Screenplay by Walon Green 
(original), John Harrison, and Robert Nelson Jacobs. Directed by Eric 
Leighton and Ralph Zondag. Rated PG.
"Dinosaur" is a great technical accomplishment. It's one of the 
best-looking movies I've ever seen. Every prehistoric creature is 
rendered in astonishingly convincing fashion, the backgrounds are lush 
and detailed (sometimes real-life locations into which the animated 
characters are placed), and the whole thing filled with crisp, colorful 
visuals. The first 15 minutes feature a breathtaking sequence in which a 
mother Iguanadon nests her eggs, only to lose them when a giant predator 
attacks. The egg is picked up by a Pterodactyl and deposited on a nearby 
island. All of "Dinosaur's" brilliance as a sensory experience is on 
display during this opening sequence. Then all potential for an 
original, innovative work gets tossed out the window when a little 
lemur-like creature opens its mouth and starts talking, in English, to 
its little lemur children, who also speak in English. Oh well.
It would be more honest, however, to say that the primary failure of 
"Dinosaur" is not, as some critics have suggested, that the dinosaurs 
talk. Nor is it that the film's plot is formulaic, though such an 
observation would certainly be true: The plot deals with an orphaned 
dinosaur named Aladar (voice of D.B. Sweeney), who is raised in the care 
of small mammals on a solitary island. A firestorm destroys Aladar's 
home, and after he and his adoptive lemur family narrowly escape the 
ordeal, they are forced to hook up with a group of migrating dinosaurs 
searching for the fabled "mating grounds," presumably an oasis in the 
hostile terrain. The dinosaurs are lead by Kron (Samuel E. Wright), a 
gruff Darwinist bent on following the "survival of the fittest" mantra 
to the death: He leaves all old or injured animals to fare for 
themselves, pushing only the able-bodied ones endlessly onward. Aladar, 
already having rubbed Kron the wrong way by sticking up for some older 
dinosaurs, runs afoul of the troop's gruff leader even more by taking a 
liking to his younger sister Neera (Julianna Margulies).
Sounds like many a Disney plot, doesn't it? In fact, the setup of the 
outcast looking for acceptance from his peers sounds alarmingly similar 
to that of "Tarzan," Disney's last animated feature. But previous Disney 
films have been enjoyable despite their predictability, so complaints 
about a formulaic plot seem somewhat wrong-headed. Likewise complaints 
about talking animals don't really get to the heart of "Dinosaur's" 
problem. The enjoyability of a Disney film stems not from its daring, 
ground-breaking originality, but from the "little things." You enjoy 
them because they tell a recognizable story in pleasing fashion, with 
amusing elements to spice up the proceedings. They have catchy songs 
("Beauty and the Beast", "The Little Mermaid"), exuberant voice work 
(Robin Williams in "Aladdin", James Woods in "Hercules"), or 
breathtaking action sequences ("The Lion King", "Tarzan"). "Dinosaur," 
unfortunately, is severely lacking in the little things. There are no 
catchy songs (not necessarily a bad thing, as the quality of songwriting 
had gradually declined as the years passed -- the songs in "Mulan" 
weren't memorable at all). None of the celebrity voices provide much 
distinction: You don't say, "Omigod! Julianna Margulies did such 
wonderful voice work!" You say, "Oh! That was Julianna Margulies?" The 
characters just come off as old Disney archetypes thrown into reptilian 
forms, and none of the humor is fresh or witty, unless one finds the 
term "jerkasaurus" absolutely hilarious. Some of the action sequences 
are exciting: A battle sequence between Aladar and some Carnataurs (a 
species invented for the film for reasons I've yet to discover) in a 
cave provides some excitement, and the aforementioned opening egg 
journey is quite breathtaking. But none of the scenes come as a natural 
continuation of what's occurred before them, and as a result, the story 
simply doesn't flow.
And that's the other big problem with "Dinosaur": It's okay in bits, but 
it doesn't cohere, doesn't involve the viewer. Most discoveries come out 
of nowhere. There is no catharsis when Aladar inevitably takes his place 
at the head of the herd, or when the nesting grounds are found. There is 
no urgency to the story. The herd marches towards something that they 
want to find tomorrow, but it doesn't make much difference if they don't 
find it until next week. Character arc is zero: The principle characters 
-- Aladar, Neera, Kron, and the lemurs -- don't much change at all from 
beginning to end. But the film's worst sin, again, is its complete and 
utter lack of flow. "Dinosaur's" structure is a strict cut-and-paste 
job, with pieces borrowed from earlier Disney films that worked their 
formulas to more pleasing effect.
So the story has no punch, the characters are bland, and the film 
contains almost no lively musical numbers, witty comic relief, or 
standout vocal characterization. What then can the audience enjoy but 
the visuals? And, to be fair, "Dinosaur" almost gets by solely on those 
merits. It's easy to conceive someone liking the film as nothing more 
than a sheer sensory experience (as I almost did). As a technical 
achievement, "Dinosaur" is stunning. As a movie, it's dull. For all its 
impressive wizardry, Disney's latest effort mostly comes off as a 
visually spectacular lesson in how not to tell a story.

     Leave it to Disney to finally come up with a family-friendly way to
explore natural selection.  Much like The Lion King's "Circle of Life,"
Dinosaur regales itself in survival of the fittest, only few people are
going to be humming "Hakuna Matata" after this one.
     For starters, Dinosaur is that rarest of Disney animation flicks
which is not a musical.  There's a thumping James Newton Howard score,
but the only singing here comes from trumpeting iguanodons and
brachiosaurs.  The story, on the other hand, is typical Disney kiddie
fare: Iguanodon Aladar (D.B. Sweeney) is orphaned as a wee dino-egg on a
remote island, where he is raised, Tarzan-style, by a family of lemurs
(er... okay).  When a freak meteor strike blows the island away, along
with much of the rest of the world, Aladar swims to the mainland with
his lemur family on his back, where he meets up with the surviving
herbivorous dinosaurs who have banded together to trek to "the nesting
grounds," a Waterworld-style vale which hasn't been reduced to desert
and ruins like, apparently, the rest of the earth.  (And never mind the
fallout; there is none...)
     Pushed on by embittered leader Kron (Samuel E. Wright), the group
struggles across the wastelands, with Aladar quickly becoming the
dissenting voice of teamwork, goodwill, and intelligence.  Despite his
sheltered upbringing, Aladar soon proves to be The Smartest Dinosaur of
All Time, managing to save the clan time and time again by magically
learning how to dig for water in the desert, how to fight off carnotaurs
by banding together as a group, and even advanced tunneling-through-rock
techniques.  Part warrior, part motivational speaker, Aladar is your
dino-Spartacus.
     I won't bother to go into the various love-story subplots
(involving, quite naturally, Kron's sister Neera (Julianna Margulies)),
but suffice it to say there's at least one martyr who takes it for the
team, a triumph over evil, incredible odds shattered, and a happy Disney
ending.  Dinosaur does not go lacking for obviousness.
     As for its animation, computer-generated movies took two giant
leaps forward with Toy Story and Toy Story 2, yet fall far behind with
Dinosaur.  While the textures and movements of the dinosaurs look quite
realistic, the fur of the lemurs (which appear so prominently, Lemur
might have been a better title) look oddly like Muppets on a bad hair
day.
     Compounding the problems is the weird confluence of genuine
landscape photography with digital animation: Imagine animated beasts
splashing around in Wild Kingdom streams.  This does not convince the
audience in the slightest and is disarmingly reminiscent of 1970's TV
show Land of the Lost.  The effect is so cheesy I was expecting the
Sleestaks to show up.
     Some of the humor is funny, but a lot of the jokes are recycled
("Is he going to gum us to death?").  My personal favorite part of the
film is the anklyosaur Url, who plays the dialogue-free part of a
panting lap dog.  Not highbrow, but humorous.
     Kids will probably enjoy the film since it lets them see dinosaurs
as heroes of the past.  There's not much to think about, and by and
large it's all in good fun.  In its production notes, Disney
acknowledges it took liberties with history by placing lemurs and
dinosaurs in the same era.  However, its bigger liberty is not mentioned
at all: Dinosaurs could not speak English.  Oh well.

Written by: Thom Enriquez, Walon Green
Aladar (D.B. Sweeney) is a dinosaur with none of his own kind to be
with. As an egg, Aladar was carried away to an island dominated
entirely by monkeys.  While there, the lead monkey, Yar (Ossie Davis),
takes Aladar into his home as a son after some coaxing from his wife,
Plio (Alfre Woodard).Years later, Aladar is grown up and wishes he
could be with one of his own species.  However, before he has a chance
to think too much about how lonely he is, meteorites hit the
planet. Aladar, Yar, Plio, and Plio's children, Zini (Max Casella) and
Suri (Hayden Panettiere), are forced away from their home.  The five
soon come across a herd of other dinosaurs who are heading across the
vast deserts for the fabled nesting ground; the one remaining spot on
the planet which still has water and life. The herd is led by the
arrogant Kron (Samuel E. Wright) and his sister, Neera (Julianna
Margulies). A rivalry soon grows between Aladar and Kron. They aren't
given much time to feud however, because two cartosaurs (t-rex's) are
on their tails.
"Dinosaur" is the kind of movie which is going to have two age groups
gaping at the screen in awe. Kids are going to be thrilled by the
chance to see dinosaurs brought to life like they haven't been able to
see before (granted, I'm assuming their parents haven't allowed them
to see "Jurassic Park"). Anyone over the age of forty or so is going
to be shocked by how far animation has come, since "Dinosaur" is (in
some ways) even more impressive than "Toy Story". The problem is that
anyone between those two age groups will be used to seeing effects
this impressive, and there isn't enough of a story to "Dinosaur" to
hold their attention. Much of the movie consists of watching dinosaurs
walk, and walk, and walk over a whole lot of desert.  In the beginning
of the film, when we were able to see all sorts of different dinosaurs
in interesting looking jungles, this was enough to keep our
attention. Watching the same herd of dinosaurs walk over a lot of sand
for forty five minutes just doesn't work.
The voices in "Dinosaur" are a mixed blessing. Joan Plowright (1996's
"101 Dalmations") and Della Reese (television's "Touched by an Angel")
give some wonderful personality to two elderly dinosaurs, who befriend
Aladar and his family. Ossie Davis ("Grumpy Old Men") does a nice job
providing the elderly Yar with a subtle, comic touch. Samuel Wright
("The Little Mermaid") is a perfect choice for the stubborn, haughty
Kron. The weak links are, unfortunately, the lead
voices. D.B. Sweeney, who usually gives great performances in shows
like Fox's short lived "Strange Luck", is a rather poor choice for
Aladar. Sweeney simply sounds too experienced and, frankly, too old to
be playing a naive young "man" going out into the real world for the
first time. Julianna Margulies ("The Newton Boys") sounds strangely
cold and detached as Aladar's perspective girlfriend. Scenes where she
is forced to intervene between her brother and Aladar there is almost
no emotion in her voice. She sounds as though she's reading directly
from a que-card.  Alfre Woodard ("Love and Basketball") nicely
underplays her role as Yar's sometimes submissive, sometimes tricky
mate.
Let's face it, the main reason everyone is going to see "Dinosaur" is
for the insanely expensive computer animation. In fact, this is the
most expensive animated film ever created by Disney. The effects may
have cost a fortune, but they certainly are impressive. Every dinosaur
is detailed right down to the last scale and the intricacies of their
eye movements. The landscapes look shockingly real at times, and the
oceans reflect images perfectly. The animation makes up for what is
lacking in the rest of the script, but not by much. The story is even
more predictable than your usual Disney film, but the usual Disney
humor is sadly absent throughout most of the film. In movies like "Toy
Story", Disney writers did a great job combining juvenile humor and
jokes adults would find amusing. The humor in "Dinosaur" is so cheesy
and childish that adults will only be rolling their eyes while their
kids squeal in delight. The only exception is a little spiked
dinosaur, named Earl, who doesn't say a word but runs around like a
typical family dog. I hate to admit it, but I couldn't help but laugh
at his antics. I'd recommend "Dinosaur" to anyone who loves computer
animation and certainly to every kid who ever had a thing for the
giant lizards (I know, I know, they're warm blooded yadda yadda). The
movie runs a nice, fast 84 minutes, and I give it three and a half out
of five stars.

I read a review of the latest Disney animated film DINOSAUR in which the 
writer stated the faces of the animals were amazingly expressive without 
seeming human.
The whole conceit of almost any animated fare starring animals is that they 
must be humanized.  Personification is the name of the game.  In this film 
we do see compelling animation, the sad and happy expressions of the lemurs 
who adopt a baby herbivore (Aladar, voiced by D. B. Sweeney), and even the 
fierce grimaces of the leaders of the herd (Kron, done by Samuel E. Wright, 
and Kron's right-hand man Bruton, voice of Peter Siragusa).  Wonderful 
animation  computer-generated images superimposed upon enhanced backgrounds 
filmed at real places around the globe.  But these creatures talk and laugh 
and play: there's an ugly/cute anklyosaur that plays a doggie-like role.  
And Aladar's Modern-age thinking goes against the theories of most 
behavioral scientists:  how many dinos do you think disregarded their 
survival instincts to help out differently-abled brachiosaurs and 
triceratops?
So, we have to suspend just as much disbelief as we do in watching other 
animated adventures.
This adventure starts with a carnivorous dinosaur, horned and fierce, 
charging into the nesting ground of herbivores.  Dinosaurs of various 
species scatter, and Aladar's egg is the only one not crushed from his 
mother's particular nest.  We watch the egg change hands a few times,  from 
an egg-sucking thief who drops it in the water, to the pterodactyl that 
drops it into the forest over an island far out into the sea.
On this island Aladar hatches and grows up among a family of lemurs  
animals that did not actually exist during the Mesozoic era.  We witness the 
typical shenanigans that go on among the young ones  the playful 
monkey-like lemurs as well as the huge Aladar.  It's not hard to tell that 
the newest animation techniques are the only original element in this film.  
Clearly, we have seen the plot many times.  Think THE LAND BEFORE TIME, or 
even the TARZAN films for their themes of exile, selflessness and personal 
redemption.  Disney was firing on all pistons when they produced THE JUNGLE 
BOOK; here they have let go another film that is pleasing to look upon but 
not very deep, another JUMANJI.
The meteor shower is quite an accomplishment, the gigantic and fiery rocks 
slamming into the sea around the island, causing the animals to flee to the 
mainland for their lives.  Also eye-catching are the vistas through which 
Aladar and his small, shaggy family travel  moonscapes as well as lovely 
meadows and ranges of real mountains.  When they meet up with the herd led 
by the grouchy Kron, the characters trudge through what looks like the Old 
West, plains cracked by dryness, canyons and rocks everywhere.
Perhaps the film would be more compelling with stronger conflicts.  What's 
going on here is that a couple of cousins of the T-rex are stalking the 
herd, which consists of an amalgam of dinos, the rear brought up by Joan 
Plowright's Baylene and Della Reese's Eema, a couple of aged but still game 
beasts who appreciate Aladar's kind and gentle approach toward migration.  
Will the herd, and particularly the crusty but lovable oldsters, elude the 
drooling, evil carnosaurs?  Secondarily, will Aladar survive threats from 
the leader of his own pack, Kron, whose sister he seems to be falling in 
love with?  The sister, Neera, by the way, is voiced by Julianna Marguiles, 
in a competent but unremarkable performance.
Music is also unremarkable, from the pen of James Newton Howard.  Most of it 
seemed transparent, accompanying the action scenes well enough.
The actors do wonders in this thinly-plotted work.  Besides the main 
characters listed above, Max Casella does a nice comic turn as a lemur 
called Zinni.  Ossie Davis plays a cantankerous grandfather lemur, Yar, his 
raspy voice imbued with character.
Who is the most likely audience for DINOSAUR?  Children.  It is rated PG for 
some scenes of violence, but these are used to suggest the realities of 
living in a world dominated by carnivores.  Nowhere do we glimpse anything 
too graphic  only one long-range killing, a couple of fight scenes, the 
skeletal remains of a fallen dinosaur.  Modern kids will not be scared.  
This film has gotten a lot of hype, and indeed its trailers looked slick and 
awesome.  But the movie as a whole is a collection of clichés bound together 
by some very nice animation (though even some of this looks plastic and 
fake-y).  Disney's best bet was releasing it now, in May, so that it would 
not be buried by the hopeful blockbusters of summer.

If there were some way to weigh a film's quality against its budget, movies
like `The Blair Witch Project,' `Clerks' and even `The Godfather' would
score excellent ratings. On the other hand, movies like `Titanic,'
`Waterworld' and `The Postman' would receive shamefully low grades. But
those infamous three works no longer need to worry about being at the very
bottom of such a list because, in one of the more surprising revelations of
the year, Disney has dumped $200 million on `Dinosaur'  a truly wretched
plague upon the silver screen.
Plot? What plot? Yep folks, Disney seems to have forgotten that they are
what they are today because they used to be in the story-telling business.
`Dinosaur' starts off with a semi-amusing storyline, even though it is
stolen from another Disney film, `Tarzan,' (a creature born to and raised by
the wrong species, in this case a dinosaur and some furry little monkeys
respectively) but then the movie becomes more or less a tremendously
oversized David Mamet play where the protagonists just wander back and forth
contemplating life's issues. Now, this works quite well with two or three
characters, a simple set and a highbrow audience. But here we have a whole
stampede of prehistoric creatures, no defined setting (is the film in
Africa? Montana? Earth?) and a target audience of tots to early teens.
Imagine sending in the 82nd Airborne to work as meter maids in a small Rhode
Island town - now you get the picture.
But hey, even when Disney fails elsewhere there are always those
embarrassingly catchy tunes to keep you entertained, right? Not here. Nope,
folks  the Mouse House seems to think it has outgrown Elton John. Big
mistake! This leaves the audience with officially no pop-music salvation and
only a mawkish score to distract themselves.
So at least there is $200 million worth of eye candy to stare at for
80-someodd minutes, right? Not exactly (do I feel like a Hertz commercial or
what!). Actually, the 3.2 million hours of work, 45 terabytes of disc space
(approximately equal to 70,000 CD-ROMs) and enough money to pay the
President of the United States' salary for the next millennium accomplish
very little. Steven Spielberg's `Jurassic Park' has better dinosaurs, Jerry
Bruckheimer knows how to make a better chase scene and Joel Schumacher is
superior in terms of manufacturing a scarcely-lit film. The prehistoric
creatures, although obviously carefully crafted, look too childish and
stereotypical - the good ones are smooth, the bad guys have sharp teeth and
horns while the little ones possess hearts of gold. One early scene with an
explosion looks like a combination of the bomb being dropped over Hiroshima
and Nicholas Cage narrowly escaping being engulfed in a gigantic fireball.
As for the seemingly never-ending thunder and lightning that conveniently
roles around every time something bad happens, it creates more of an `8MM'
type feeling than that of a kids movie.
Further confusing the target audience are a couple of very muddled morals.
On one hand, the film earns major points for encouraging teamwork. On the
other hand, (SPOILER AHEAD) the picture's hero will ultimately act alone, as
his peers look on, to win the final battle of the film.
There is little doubt that Disney will recover from `Dinosaur' and once
again find itself at the top of the animation kingdom. Actually, they
already have a $75 million visual effects studio that was built for this
movie but will be reusable for future projects. For the mean time, though,
trust your science teacher  dinosaurs are extinct for a reason.

Dinosaur is beyond belief in so many ways. The computer animation is 
astonishing, and it will blow you away. Never before has any film combined 
live action backgrounds with computer generated characters so seamlessly. 
Shots where real waterfalls with cascading water blend with images of 
dinosaurs of all species create a truly unique experience. It really makes a 
difference to how real you might think it is. The animal's characteristics 
may be very human-like, but they are always beautiful and interesting. There 
are so many little details that get closely examined. The ways a lemur's fur 
might ruffle, the texture of a triceratops's skin, and even more trivial 
animal elements get handled with the greatest of care. With so much attention 
to these small particulars, it's amazing one major part of the movie gets 
entirely overlooked. This gorgeous movie has one derivative and horrendous 
script. 
Like the latest Aardman Animations production Chicken Run, Dinosaur borrows 
heavily from other animated films. Aladar is a dinosaur whose egg gets 
dropped off with a bunch of lemurs before he is even born. After some 
discussion between the heads of the lemur group, the animals decide to adopt 
the dinosaur and raise him as their own. As Aladar grows up, he longs for 
others of his species to be with. It appears as if writers John Harrison and 
Robert Nelson Jacobs copied and pasted the first part of this movie from the 
script of last year's Disney film Tarzan. A devastating meteor shower forces 
the lemurs and Aladar off their small island. On the mainland they meet up 
with a herd of dinosaurs of several species. Aladar finally realizes he's not 
alone. He soon falls in love with Neera, a female dinosaur whose brother Kron 
is the head of the group. Kron favors himself and the other stronger animals. 
He believes that only the strong should survive and hopes to rid himself and 
others of the weak animals that Aladar tries to help. This of course sounds 
just like the influence of Gene Hackman's General Mandible who had a similar 
plan in the 1998 film Antz. The group must travel under harsh conditions to 
reach the glorious mating grounds, a lush place for dinosaurs. The Land 
Before Time did the same thing. A Jurassic Park aura is also present.
The problem with Dinosaur is its level of implausibility. Not only do the 
dinosaurs and lemurs look spectacular, they talk too. There is a good mix of 
dinosaur roaring and talking in English. This is obviously there for more 
appeal, but I seriously doubt that before anyone on the earth was born we had 
lemurs using terms like, "raging epidemic." One rather humorous alternative 
to the dinosaurs talking and roaring would be to have them roar, and only 
roar. Their roars could then get translated into subtitles that would appear 
on the bottom of the screen. However, subtitles aren't exactly kid-friendly 
and stars like Alfre Woodard and Ossie Davis couldn't get listed as voices. 
The lack of needed humor was also rather shocking. If the dinosaurs are going 
to talk, at least give them some good lines. Instead, we get humor like Neera 
referring to Aladar as a âjerkasaurusâ? when they first meet. This movie got 
rated PG for intense images and is likely to frighten young children. There 
are some very scary and tense scenes (even a few that had me jumping out of 
my seat) that might send the little ones into crying hysteria. Not being of 
the tyke type, I found these sequences to be thrilling. The older viewers 
finally get treated to something heart-pounding that moves things along. 
There is a string of action moments where the animation and score really 
shine through.
The formulaic story does have a few bright moments, but it's mostly the 
standard child's movie fare. Looking back at the kid's animation genre, this 
formula gets used again and again, and is quite tired. Any change to the 
strict policy these films adhere to would be welcome. At this time we get 
left with Dinosaur, which is worth seeing for its visuals, but not its 
content.

Disney has gone on record saying that it actually built a "secret lab" in
order to create this film, which combines photo realistic CGI dinosaurs and
actual background footage. They also claim that the film cost around $130
Million, while others speculate that cost to be much higher. Of course, none
of that would really matter if the film turned out to be an entertainment
bonanza, right? Uhhh, well...time to get back to the "secret" drawing board,
fellas. You forget to spend enough money on a good script! (having four
writers never helps)
PLOT:
Set in the prehistoric times, this story tells the tale of a baby dinosaur
brought up by monkeys (lemurs, to be exact). But when a meteor shower sends
them wailing onto another island full of sorted dinos, the family must keep
up with a herd of the giant beasts, in order to survive and make their way
to the nesting grounds.
CRITIQUE:
Hey, I thought kid's movies were supposed to be fun?! This one is downright
dark, with very few laughs, zero songs and dances, a lame script,
computer-generated-looking monkeys, and granted, some excellent special
effects here and there. Top that off with a 80-minute runtime (although I
must admit that it felt much longer), an extremely strong overall sense of
deja-vu, and this film certainly didn't do much to bowl this critical dude
over. Granted, the film starts off okay, with some awesome visuals of the
dinos, the landscape, and definitely the whole meteor shower scene, but once
the monkeys begin their long journey in the desert alongside the dinosaurs,
the film really doesn't go very far. Sure, they've tossed in a couple of
bogus "bad guys" here and there, but with such little charisma or excitement
being generated from any of the main characters, it was hard to actually
give a crap about anything that was to happen to them. Having said that,
impressed was I with the few battle scenes which did liven the film up a
bit, even though I will admit that are probably a little too realistic, even
harsh, for kids. The TOY STORY movies worked because they combined many
factors, prime among them being awesome scripts, fun and interesting
characters and an overall sense of joy and excitement.
This film just felt dry. It honestly didn't entertain me much, save for the
fight scenes, and it most certainly didn't convince me to recommend it to a
friend. Of course, kids might like it because of the whole dinosaur angle,
but geez Disney, why did you have to make it so boring? I'm not asking for a
Robin Williams appearance or anything, but slap a few funny jokes in there,
ixnay all the death scenes, and for God's sakes, give us some characters and
a story which actually generate a little pizzazz. So perhaps your children
will enjoy it, but even then, more than likely because of the film's
generally spectacular visuals or powerful battle scenes (although smaller
children might actually get scared), not the story. I doubt that many kids
will want the toys associated with any of the lifeless characters in this
film...or remember their names, for that matter. All in all, some great
visuals (except for the phony-looking monkeys), cool action scenes, but the
lame story and uninteresting characters just drag any fun out of it. I
honestly don't know why this would excite anyone after seeing the JURASSIC
PARK films. Unless of course, you're in the mood for a dinosaur documentary
or something.
Note to studios: Enough with the dinosaur movies!

 That phrase used to be fairly commonplace in movie promotion,
but with the truth-in-advertising laws, it's rarely applied to anything
these days. The fact is, after enduring decades of 3-D films,
Sensurround epics, Cinemascope, gigantic IMAX visuals, digital stereo
and even the short-lived Smell-A-Vision, most audiences can't imagine
there's anything new under the sun.
 But "Dinosaur" is truly like nothing you've ever seen before.
 If your primary experiences with computer animation were "Antz"
and the "Toy Story" movies, you owe it to yourself to take a look at
"Dinosaur," just to appreciate how far this relatively new art has
already progressed. You'll find a styrachosaur with skin that ripples,
lemurs with fur that ruffles in the breeze and bloodthirsty raptors that
move with an almost alarming dexterity. The action takes place against
rich, vividly detailed backgrounds and it's followed closely by cameras
that can effortlessly zoom along the ground, swoop into the sky and
plunge into a river.
 The fluidity and gracefulness of this work makes the similar
effects in "Jurassic Park" and "The Lost World" seem almost clunky by
comparison; there's even a none-too-subtle jab at Steven Spielberg's
epics about two-thirds of the way through the movie. By the time
"Dinosaur" offers us the sight of seemingly hundreds of homeless
dinosaurs moving wearily across the desert in search of water and food,
it's likely you will have forgotten the creations you're watching are
not real, living, breathing creatures. The five years of work producer
Pam Marsden (a Kalamazoo College graduate) and her team of animators
have put into the film pay off magnificently: The illusion captivates us
completely.
 Like "Titanic," "Dinosaur" is basically a very simple tale made
compelling by astounding technology. Since this is, after all, a Disney
film, there's a hero who doesn't fit in with his peers (see "Tarzan,"
"Hercules," etc.), a character-building journey toward self-discovery
(as in "Mulan," "Pocahontas," "The Hunchback of Notre Dame") and a
climactic face-off with a terrifying villain, in this case, a savage
carnotaur with a theater-rattling roar.
 The carnotaurs and the raptors don't speak, but everyone else
does, and the script sometimes strains to be reassuringly jokey, one of
the film's few real weaknesses. On the plus side, we are spared any
musical interludes. There's not even an anthem slapped on the end
credits -- hurrah!
 The plot of "Dinosaur" revolves around Aladar (voice by D.B.
Sweeney), a compassionate young iguanodon who grows up among a playful
family of lemurs after being stolen from his crib and deposited by a
pterodactyl on a remote island. When his home is destroyed by a
spectacularly rendered meteor shower, Aladar and the surviving lemurs
make their way to the mainland and join up with scores of fellow
refugees being led to a new nesting ground by the surly Kron (Samuel E.
Wright) and his gruff partner Bruton (Peter Siragusa). Like some sort of
prehistoric cult leader, Kron drives his troops mercilessly and demands
complete loyalty, although his sister Neera (Julianna Margulies)
eventually tires of his stern single-mindedness and opts to follow the
more compassionate Aladar.
 With less than 90 minutes in which to tell its story,
"Dinosaur" zooms along, maintaining a relatively high level of intensity
for a Disney drama. The vicious attacks by the carnotaurs and the
raptors are guaranteed to get viewers on the edges of their seats and
parents should be warned they are not entirely bloodless. Although
"Dinosaur" isn't the relentlessly scary experience the last half of
"Jurassic Park" was, the movie's PG rating is well-deserved.
 The movie cushions the shocks somewhat with the comforting
presence of grandmotherly brachiosaur Baylene, who speaks in the
beguiling British tones of Joan Plowright, and her friend Eema, a
styrachosaur with the earth-mama voice of Della Reese. When one of the
lemurs hitches on a ride on top of Eema, she bellows, "That's just what
I need -- a monkey on my back," and Reese's reading makes the pun much
funnier than it should be.
 What will rope most viewers -- especially kids -- into seeing
"Dinosaur" more than once is not the humor, however. It will be the
sheer spectacle of the film, the brilliance of the animation, the
glorious, all-encompassing sound and the thrill of sitting spellbound in
the dark alongside hundreds of other moviegoers while you discover a
wondrous new frontier of filmmaking. Even with the best home theater
system money can buy, that kind of excitement is impossible to recreate
in your living room, and that's why millions will be lining up at their
local theater to savor the "Dinosaur" experience this weekend. James
Sanford

The press kit for Disney's computer animated children's movie,
"Dinosaur," contains eight pages of cast and crew biographies, nine
pages of credits and 15 pages of production notes. Included in the
copious technical section is one paragraph on the actual story, which
reveals a lot about the filmmakers' priorities. "Dinosaur" is a 75
minute (82 with closing credits) showcase for computer animation, with a
standard issue Disney storyline slapped on. And, despite the jazzy
visuals, it's a surprisingly mundane affair.
Of course, the very young target audience for the movie will love every
minute of it, but then again, they also look at Lunchables as fine
dining.
Set in the late Cretaceous Period, "Dinosaur" chronicles the adventures
of Aladar (voice of D.B. Sweeney), an Iguanodon raised by a family of
frolicking lemurs after his egg turns up on their island paradise. A
meteor shower forces them to flee to the mainland, where they join a
diverse group of dinosaurs trudging across the ravaged land seeking a
new nesting ground. Aladar's insistence on staying with caravan
stragglers like the slow-moving Brachiosaur, Baylene (Joan Plowright),
and the brassy Styrachosaur, Eema (Della Reese), draws the ire of
Iguanodon herd leader Kron (Samuel E. Wright), even though his sister,
Neera (Julianna Margulies), clearly considers the rebellious young
dinosaur to be quite a stud.
Think Disney's "Tarzan" minus the exuberance and "The Lion King" with
less majesty and you'll know what to expect from the retread plot. Think
fuzzy wuzzy and you'll understand the story's philosophy. In the press
notes, Margulies states, "The film has a beautiful message, especially
for younger viewers, that it's so much cooler to help the weak ones than
to go along with the bully who hates everyone and can be mean just
because he's more powerful." The villain of which she speaks is Kron,
and his crime is driving the herd to a safe haven, even if it means
leaving behind those who can't keep pace. Apparently, Disney-think
allows no room for distasteful concepts like survival of the fittest.
But enough carping over plot and philosophy  after all, this is a film
concerned primarily with cute characters and dazzling visuals.
"Dinosaur" strives to raise the bar for computer animation, placing CG
characters in real world settings. The production's first unit shot in
California's Mohave Desert and in Hawaiian botanical gardens, along with
other sites on the Big Island, Maui and Kauai, while the second unit
captured images in Australia, Jordan, Venezuela and the beaches of
Western Samoa. Animators studied light and shadow with great care,
attempting to seamlessly insert their computer generated creations into
real backdrops.
Their success rate varies from scene to scene. Some composite images are
crisp, sharply defined and remarkably convincing, while others have a
creamy, storybook appearance that is far less credible, but still
attractive. The most impressive shots are close-ups where the animators
obviously strained to break new ground. In the past, computer renditions
of water and hair generally ranged from barely passable to flat-out
cheesy, but "Dinosaur" gets them right. For scenes of a soggy lemur, fur
stylist Charles Colladay dealt with both, explaining "To study wet hair,
I experimented at home by wetting down my cats to see what they looked
like. The hair comes to thousands of little points and you can see the
skin in-between. That gave us some direction to go in and we came up
with a hair-clumping tool where we could actually grab a single hair on
the computer and clump a bunch of others to our target hair. We went to
the zoo to study real lemurs, but they kind of frowned on us wetting
them down."
Even though "Dinosaur" periodically breaks new ground, the film suffers
from a been-there, done-that feel. Ads for the film trumpet, "You've
never seen anything like this before!" Apparently, they forgot about a
little feature called "Jurassic Park." When Laura Dern and Sam Neill
first saw a dinosaur grazing in the sunshine, rising on its hind legs to
snatch some leaves from the top of a tree, my jaw dropped as far as
theirs did. I never experienced that sensation during "Dinosaur." I've
no doubt that kids will go wild over the movie, but for this adult, the
grafting of grandiose images to a Sesame Street storyline left me cold.
Scientists theorize that dinosaurs became extinct as a result of Earth
being struck by an asteroid. After sitting through this tepid spectacle,
I wonder if they simply died of boredom.

Not quite the realistic Dinosaurs of "Jurassic Park," nor are they the
decidedly caricatures of "Toy Story 2." These Mesozoics are a cute computer
cross between cartoons and muppets.
In the grand opening scene, a fought after dinosaur egg trades hands (er..
ah claws) from one reptile to the next until a pteranodon (bird-like
reptile) drops it on some distant Lemur Island. (Anybody know if primates
and dinosaurs shared the same geological time period?) Anyway, the dominant
male lemur wants to discard this inauspicious scaley baby, but is soon
endeared to it. So, too, was I. Expecting big things from these Disney
people, the sweeping egg-toss sequence didn't quite grab me; and then with
the advent of that inter-species adoption - I sniffed a "Tarzan" copy.
But with the pace of a shooting star, the film changes direction as the
inhabitants of the lush Lemur Island are forced into a hasty exodus. I'll
leave the reason for their flight a surprise, but will say this ... it's
lovely. Absolutely lovely. A fantastically magical, chillingly glowing,
horrifically compelling sequence. It sucked me in like a tar pit (but it
wasn't a tar pit).
>From there the now grown dinosaur (Aladar) and his small pack of chimps join
a herd of other "sauruses" as they brave the dangerous and course migration
to a dreamy nesting place. Aladar exhibits some
out-of-previously-established character, cocky behavior, especially
inappropriate given present circumstances. This oversight could have been
corrected with the addition of a scene or two in Aladar's growing up period.
Kron (the head honchosaurus) leads the pack with an evolutionary Darwinistic
iron fist (er.. ah claw). "Then let the weaker ones die, they'll slow our
predators." Apparently, Darwin had never been to Disneyland. Of course,
Aladar encourages everyone to work together for the common good -- help each
other out. It's kind of hokey, but aside from a few hints at "mating" that's
about all the film has to offer in the meaning department.
But in the adventure and waycool-to-look-at departments - the film boulders!
(er.. ah rocks!)

Way back when, I fell in love with a movie called THE BEAR, a film that 
explored the non-animated, non-comical lives of two bears fighting 
against man and nature.  When it finally came out on DVD, I bought it, 
savoring the memory of having seen a rousing story told without the 
trickery of singing beasts and wisecracking sidekicks. I mention this 
because, for a short while, I had a glimmer of a hope that - given the 
beautifully epic sweep shown in its previews - DINOSAUR could also tell 
its tale without smarminess, or at least with the finesse of a TOY STORY.
The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
After being mistakenly dropped, as an egg, into a group of lemurs--among 
them, father and group leader Yar (Ossie Davis), mother Pilo (Alfre 
Woodard), Zini (Max Casella), a hopeful (hopeless?) bachelor and Comic 
Relief, and daughter Suri (Hayden Panettiere)--Aladar the dinosaur (D.B. 
Sweeney) is brought up as a member of the lemur family.  Aladar and the 
lemurs' world is changed forever when giant meteors fall onto their 
island, and they find themselves among other plant-eating dinosaurs, led 
by Darwin-loving Kron (Samuel E. Wright), his heart-of-gold sister Neera 
(Julianna Margulies), tough guy Bruton (Peter Siragusa), Baylene the 
slow-moving Brachiosaur (Joan Plowright), and Eema (Della Reese), a 
Weary Ol' Styrachosaur--all searching for the "nesting grounds", while 
trying to stay two steps ahead of the dreaded meat-eating Carnotaurs.
The Upshot:
Actually, I'm probably being unfair to DINOSAUR in comparing it to the 
cinematic wonders of a "Bear" or the Fun Enough For An Adult (But It's 
Made For A Kiddie) fare found in a "Toy Story"; then again, with the 
oodles and oodles of dough Disney dumped into this project, you'd think 
they'd remember the number one rule: make the story interesting.
Instead, they blew their wad on making the pretty pictures, and 
scripting some awfully pedestrian lines which were proffered up by good 
actors like D.B. Sweeney, Ossie Davis, Joan Plowright, and Alfre 
Woodard--all actors whose talents belie what sounded like mere 
journeymanism on their parts.  I was never convinced that these were 
anything but actors reading scripted lines (don't laugh; Toy Story had 
me every step of the way); instead of seeing big dinos and silly little 
monkeys, I found myself listening for familiar voices ("yep, that's 
Julianna Margulies reading 'Neera', sounding a whole lot like 'Carol 
Hathaway'...and hmmm, I wonder what James Earl Jones would've sounded 
like as 'Kron'...").    
The filmmakers seemed to count on childrens' love of dinosaurs (and, uh, 
hasn't that fad played out by now?  Last I checked, Pikachu was the 
in-thing with the young'uns) and All Things Disney, to carry the day by 
coming to see this movie in droves.  That they'll get the kids in, I 
have no doubt.  Will the movie keep their hyperactive attention?  Well, 
that's another story.  Will it reel in the adults?  Well, it's a 
certainty that it didn't keep my attention.  
Why?  That one's easy: it lacked the spirit of fun, going instead for 
the preachiness of  pounding a number of morals into the audience's 
head, to the point where I went begging for aspirin for the headache I 
developed.  It certainly didn't help that for some bizarre reason, a 
narrator was tacked on to the beginning and ending, a'swingin' away with 
the Whifflebat Of Exposition.  I reckon it's not A Good Thing when you 
start rooting for the bad meat-eating dinosaurs to corner the cute 
little plant-eaters and thrash them about the head until they just shut 
up, ya think?  And if I see and hear another wisecracking movie monkey, 
I think I might do Damage.
[And at risk of being roasted by parents of young kidlets everywhere - 
"This is a children's film, you insensitive cad!" - let me just say that 
Black folk ain't the *only* ones who talk at the movies.  Maybe It's 
Just Me; maybe it's asking too much to expect parents to tell their 
children that, no Billy, it's not polite to scream at the top of your 
lungs every time you get bored and want more JuJu Beans.  Yeah.  It's 
probably Just Me.]
DINOSAUR certainly had its Moments.  On the technical front, it was 
drawn beautifully, and the creatures' movements seemed to be handled 
realistically (as much as one could expect); the lemurs, for instance, 
were made to move in a somewhat-sideways gait, not the straight-ahead 
walk of, say, apes. [And, speaking of lemurs, correct me if I'm wrong--
but since when would there be dinosaurs occupying the same era as lemurs?
I mean, *talking* lemurs are bad enough; d'ya really expect me to swallow
the lemurs talking before their proper time? I think not!]  Story-wise, 
I chuckled a few times at Della Reese's Weary Ol' Black Chick lines.  
And if you've seen the long trailer--the one without the talking 
lemurs--you've pretty much seen the most exciting part of the flick.  
But a few Moments here or there do not an interesting story make, 
especially in a movie that's supposedly a Big Summer Event.  The 
animation-lover in me was dazzled by the drawings, but like a 
badly-dubbed karate flick, the pictures and the sound didn't quite match 
up.
I don't doubt for a second that this movie will make a gazillion dollars 
this year and beyond, judging from the number of rather loud (but, 
noticeably, not laughing) kids in my audience.  Still, box office 
considerations aside, DINOSAUR is a big and pretty airhead of a movie.
Bammer's Bottom Line:
DINOSAUR may have been great eye candy to look at--and until the monkeys 
first spoke, it was indeed beautiful, without distraction--but they 
forgot to build something into this movie: heart.  Fun- and story-wise, 
the toys in Toy Story and the ants in A Bug's Life ran circles around 
the big dino brutes.  One thing in its favor, though: at least there 
were no singing prehistoric critters.
DINOSAUR (rating: flashing yellowlight): 
This one's sense of wonder went extinct about 10 minutes in.

It's kind of like watching the powers that be draw lines in the sand and
egg each other on with one technical achievement after another. Steven
Spielberg and George Lucas pushed ILM to the limits to create and
integrate live action and CGI animation with both Jurassic Park films
and Star Wars Episode One. Dreamworks SKG and its partners cracked the
problem of CGI'ing realistic water in Antz. The Disney folk built a
digital studio from scratch to deliver Dinosaur, the most perfect
integration of animation and "live" film since the Lumiere Brothers came
up with the idea about a hundred years ago [From the Earth To The Moon,
in 1896???], or since Winsor McCay stepped from the vaudeville stage
into his animation of Gertie the Dinosaur, and rode off into the sunset
on her back. I know it's most perfect because I sat dead center of the
theater thinking, "nice water" before I realized that I was watching
"live" footage of water with animated splashes and dinosaur feet in the
middle of it. When you totally lose the idea that you're looking at
something created in thousands of mega-gigabytes of computer memory,
that's kind of transcendent.
While I catch my breath, I'll point to the West Coast where our Paul
Fischer sat down with directors Eric Leighton and Ralph Zondag, and the
voice cast, to explain how they done it. Click here.
I admit to being swayed by the technology, whose soul is the work of
hundreds of animators and technicians and the equivalent of 70,000
CD-ROM's worth of CGI power. At it's heart, Dinosaur is a simple "get
from point A to point B" story, one with a couple of moments of where
those of us of parental age shuddered to think that there were four year
olds in the audience. The four year olds next to me had no such problem.
More on that below. And while some of the classifications and names of
dinos have changed over the years, I'm sticking to the old ones 'cuz I
think most of y'all would have a better mental image of a Brontosaurus
than a Bracchisaur, which looks pretty much the same to me. So . . .
With a camera point of view that moves around, below and above a herd of
leaf-eating, egg-laying Iguanodon munching in a meadow. Other species of
dino flitter and fly about until a meat chomping T-Rex comes crashing
out of the bush, stomping on nests of eggs and making a quick breakfast
of a not too fleet of foot beastie. Other scavengers sift through the
wreckage, carting off an egg, which will be tough enough to withstand
several new owners, a river dunking or two, a flight through the air in
the jaws of a pterodactyl and a long plummet to earth. Discovered by a
tribe of lemurs led by Yar (Ossie Davis), whose initial reaction is to
order the death of the new hatchling, though the calmer view of his
mate, Plio (Alfre Woodard) prevails. Raised to adulthood, Aladar (D.B.
Sweeney) and his lemur pals frolic in the pre-historic forests and watch
with wonder as meteors come plummeting through the atmosphere to wreak
havoc on the Earth.
That's two sequences that'll have you going "oo" and we're only twenty
or so minutes into the flick.
Barely surviving the nuclear level detonations nearby or the churning
waters drowning most of his pals, Aladar and his "family" make it to the
barren mainland, where a herd of a similar species plus remnants and
stragglers of stegosauruses and brontos (and so on) is being led to
their equivalent of a Promised Land, a verdant nesting ground whose
image is lovingly maintained in their memories. At the head of the pack
is Kron (Samuel E. Wright) a marine sergeant of a dino who prefers to
leave the stragglers behind so the trailing 'raptors can pick them off.
Only the strong survive in Kron's world, and his second in command,
Bruton (Owen Klatte), is quick to make the cut of the old and weak.
Behind the 'raptors, though, is something much, much worse and much,
much larger. They're called "carnotaurs" which, for purposes on old folk
like me, means more pumped up than T-Rex, and a lot nastier. Rounding
off the story is Aladar's love interest, Neera (Julianna Marguiles),
sister of Kron. You know that's gonna mean trouble somewhere down the
line.
Aladar, though, has been raised to be cooperative and kind. Cut from the
herd 'cuz he's helping the strays, which include an elderly stegosaurus
named Eema (Della Reese) and equally old brontosaurus called Baylene
(Joan Plowright). Aladar, with best friend Zini (Max Casella) and the
rest of his mini-herd learn the meaning of teamwork and find their own
route to the promised land . . . and then head back to help the rest of
the dinos and teach them to cooperate with each other to defeat the
carnotaur. This is where the battle sequences made this old wimp a wee
bit antsy. As for the two four year olds sitting in the adjacent seat,
one turned to the other and said "This is the scarey part" and the other
said "OK". So, parents note, if your kid made it through either of the
Jurassic Park flicks, and to this day I still cannot watch the first one
on my big screen TV, this Dinosaur story should pose no problem.
Were it not for the perfectly matched sound effects that accompanied the
battles between the lead beasties of each group; the battle for control
of the herd; the battle against nature just to stay alive, this simple
story could have sunk for the reason that it is just too simple. I have
no problem with teaching kidlets that cooperation is a good thing. The
Dinosaur story felt like a back to school kind of experience for this
man two score beyond first grade. No big deal. I could watch the CGI all
day, even if the furry lemurs look more like Muppets than monkeys.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Dinosaur, he would have paid...
Dinosaur was a pretty satisfying sit. I didn't walk out feeling pumped
but I sure did enjoy it.

In an era of rapid technological change, the film industry stands out as
a veritable dinosaur.  So it is all the more noteworthy when a film like
Disney's DINOSAUR makes such a stunning visual achievement through
radical blending of technologies.  Combining some of the most
sophisticated computer-generated animation that you've ever seen with
(digitally enhanced) live-action backgrounds, the ground-breaking film
becomes a dinosaur documentary on steroids.  It is the sort of picture
that has you sitting there going, "Wow!"
What are sorely absent, however, are Pixar and their band of merry men
to craft a script that can hold your attention.  Instead, Disney relies
on writers John Harrison, mainly a television writer known for his dark
pieces in series like "Tales from the Crypt," and Robert Nelson Jacobs,
whose only other released script is the senior citizen comedy OUT TO
SEA.  The result is a story that is a pale imitation of THE LAND BEFORE
TIME, which had more endearing characters and more effective humor.  In
THE LAND BEFORE TIME, the big reptiles were off to find the legendary
"Great Valley."  In DINOSAUR, they are migrating to a similar looking
locale, but this time the lush and peaceful valley is referred to simply
as the nesting grounds.
Still, it's not that the script bombs, but that it fizzles.  There are
several nice sections of dialog, and some imaginative characterizations.
But when a Disney film leaves one nostalgic for THE LAND BEFORE TIME,
that's not a good sign.  They want the kids to come back and see their
movie a second time, not go rent the competition's videos.
The way to approach DINOSAUR, however, isn't to ponder how good it could
and should have been, but to enjoy what it does best, which is to
recreate the world of the dinosaurs toward the end of their reign on
earth.  Best of all is the realism shown in the skin of the dinosaurs,
which has a texture so life-life, that you'll swear they've located real
dinosaur flesh and digitally imposed it on computer generated
wire-frames.  This magic extends to all of the textures including those
of the dinosaur's comical sidekicks, a group of lemurs, whose fur can be
seen convincingly blowing in the breeze as the lemurs leap from tree to
tree.
The story concerns an Iguanodon, Aladar (D.B. Sweeney), who is raised on
an island without other dinosaurs by a group of little lemurs.  When the
matriarch of the lemurs discovers the newly hatched Aladar, the elder of
the lemur clan, Yar (Ossie Davis), warns them about Iguanodons.  "Things
like that eat things like us for snacks," he admonishes them.  Zini (Max
Casella), soon to be Aladar's best bud, laughs off old Yar's admonition.
"This monster's got no teeth," Zini points out.  "What's he going to do?
Gum us to death?"  Soon, Aladar is a thousand times their size, but he
is still his original playful self.
After meteors rain down from the heavens, turning the world into
something akin to a huge battlefield, Aladar and his "family" end up
swimming to the mainland, where Aladar finally gets to meet dinosaurs of
various species, not all of them friendly.  He is first chased by a pack
of blood-thirsty Raptors with some really ferocious teeth and claws.
Scariest of all are some chillingly realistic Carnotaurs, which look
like T-Rexs, who roar a lot and eat everything in sight.
This brings us to the issue of the film's rating.  Disney's animated
motion pictures are almost always rated G.  In order to make the movie
as authentic as possible, Disney allowed the filmmakers to bring
DINOSAURS in at a PG rating.  But it is an extremely intense PG that has
significant potential to scare little ones.  These Carnotaurs would have
been happy to nosh on little humans, something that the small fry will
easily be able to imagine.  And when the meteors hit, it may look like
the end of the world to impressionable youngsters.  After all, for the
dinosaurs the event was the start of the end of the line for them.
The body of the story concerns the herd of dinosaurs, as well as
Aladar's lemur pals, migrating to the dinosaur's breeding grounds.
Along the way, our hero finally meets an eligible female, who at first
refers to him as a "Jerkasaurus."  The rest of the storyline follows a
formula so cast in stone that it could have been written by a computer.
Maybe it was.
The movie's press kit proudly brags about what a technical tour de force
it is.  And rightly so.  There were 70,000 lines of software code
written by the "Dinosaur software group," it tells us.  Since software
designers use the word "dinosaur" as a derogatory term, the irony of
this claim has a delicious charm to it.  Although one can argue whether
knowing the amount of code means anything, it did bring to mind the
technical genius that went into the production of DINOSAUR.  Even if the
film has shortcomings, its visuals are nothing short of incredible.
DINOSAUR runs 1:24.  It is rated PG for intense images and would be fine
for kids around 8 and up.  Parents with kids who frighten easily should
carefully consider whether their children are ready for this picture.
My son Jeffrey, age 11, loved the movie, giving it a full ****.  He
particularly liked the computer generated animation.  His favorite
characters were Aladar and his lemur friends.  He said that he enjoyed
it when the movie scared him a little bit.

Directed by Eric Leighton and Ralph Zondag. Screenplay by John Harrison
and Robert Nelson Jacobs, from a story by Thom Enriquez, Harrison, Jacobs
and Zondag, based on an earlier screenplay by Walon Green. Starring D.B.
Sweeney, Alfre Woodard, Max Casella. Running time: 83 minutes. Rated PG by
the MFCB. Reviewed on June 13th, 2000.
When a movie targeted at children tries to appeal to adults, it usually 
does so by offering an additional, more mature level of dialogue and
humor: material which will go unnoticed by the younger set but
will be appreciated by the grown-ups. There is some of this in "Dinosaur",
but not a lot. Instead, what will entertain the adults is pretty much
exactly what will entertain the kids: a visually spectacular production
which takes the art of computer animation to a whole new level.
I first became aware of the possibilities of computer graphics when I saw 
"Jurassic Park". I can still remember the thrill I felt at actually being 
able to watch dinosaurs walk, eat, attack, and interact with one another.
And while "Jurassic Park" is still pretty impressive -- certainly, seven 
years on it has not dated badly at all -- on a technical level, it has
been altogether surpassed by "Dinosaur". For here not only do we see the
reptiles as more of a presence in their environment than ever before, but
we are witness to a tremendous variety of the creatures, all acting as
though they were real, individual beings. One of the most incredible shots
in the whole picture sees the camera pan up over a rise to show a massive
caravan of dinosaurs, dozens of them representing many different species,
all galloping off into the distance.
And the success of "Dinosaur" lies not just in these bold, epic scenes 
but also in the details. Check out the way the wind blows realistically 
through the hair of the lemurs, for example, or how the sand breaks under 
the feet of the heavier dinosaurs. Granted, the animation is not perfect: 
the dinosaurs feel entirely too textured and clean, and many of the faces 
(especially the lemurs) still bear a hint of their cartoon ancestry. But 
these are minor gripes; "Dinosaur" is the sort of movie you can just sit 
back and watch for an hour and a half, and let your eyes feast.
Of course, there's a story too, although it's a relatively simple one. 
Aladar (DB Sweeney) is a dinosaur who has been raised by a family of 
lemurs after his stolen egg was dropped into their midst by a flying
creature one day. (Realistically, mammals were nowhere close to this level
of evolution prior to the extinction of the dinosaurs, but in this case
the science gaffe is forgivable, with the lemurs acting as more
accessible audience identification figure than most of the dinosaurs.)
Aladar leads a happy, if somewhat lonely, life with the lemurs on their
verdant island for many years.
Then one evening, a violent meteor shower rains down upon the land,
forcing Aladar to flee the island with as many of his family as he can
carry. (This sequence is a wonderful example of mixing beauty and horror;
the storm is initially very beautiful, burning across a purple evening
sky, and very gradually builds in intensity and fury.) The survivors
include misfit "love monkey" Zini (Max Casella), young Suri (Hayden
Panettiere), Aladar's "mother" Plio (Alfre Woodard), and lemur patriarch
Yar (Ossie Davis). Swimming to the mainland, Aladar and friends discover
it to be a burnt, barren wasteland in the aftermath of the meteor storm.
(It's not made clear if this shower is intended to be the one which would
eventually lead to the extinction of the dinosaurs.)
They soon come upon a huge pack of dinosaurs in search of the fabled
Nesting Grounds, a secluded valley paradise. The dinosaurs are led by the
draconian Kron (Samuel E Wright), whose sister Neera ("ER"'s Julianna
Margulies) quickly attracts Aladar's eye. Kron adheres strictly to the
law of the survival of the fittest, and is perfectly happy to let the
older dinosaurs, such as Aladar's new friends Eema (Della Reese) and
Baylene (Joan Plowright), perish if it means stronger, younger pack
members will live. The dinosaurs soon find themselves crossing a long
stretch of arid desert a la "Lawrence of Arabia", with the terrifying,
fang-mawed carnotaurs at their backs and only the faintest promise of
reaching the Nesting Grounds ahead.
"Dinosaur" is well-written, although the simplistic, straightforward 
script by John Harrison and Robert Nelson Jacobs leaves little doubt
about the intended audience. But there are some very amusing sequences
(after Zini's ill-considered attempt to get Neera to notice Aladar, she
quips, "That, children, is what we call a jerkosaurus"), and the story
proceeds at a reasonable pace which shouldn't allow tedium to set in for
adults or kids.
After an opening ten-minute sequence in which none of the animals actually
speak, it is initially rather jarring when the lemurs and Aladar begin
conversing. But this feeling of displacement quickly fades, and the
voicework is altogether competent. Much of the characterisation is fairly
shallow, however, so the artistes don't have a lot to do besides read
lines. Only Davis, as the gruff but lovable Yar, really stands out.
The movie benefits from some luxurious cinematography by David R
Hardberger and S Douglas Smith. Images of the sprawling grasslands and 
waves pounding the ocean cliffs are beautiful even without the presence of
the animated dinosaurs. Also helping to raise the bar is the glorious
score by James Newton Howard, which adds an epic feel to the events.
Most kids will enjoy "Dinosaur", and the content is generally quite 
appropriate. There are some nice lessons to be learned about the value of
teamwork and the importance of caring for the elderly, and the movie
doesn't get overly preachy. Parents of very young or sensitive children
should be warned that a handful of scenes are quite savage, however. The
destruction of the lemurs' island and the antics of the carnivorous
dinosaurs, like the ferocious carnotaurs, have the potential to be
nightmare fodder for some. For the most part, though, "Dinosaur" is a
rousing and delightful adventure, another success from the Disney stable
of animated films.

Di$ney's latest mega-blockbuster Dinosaur is set in the age of the
dinosaurs (duh, obviously), around the time of their proposed demise at
the hands of a comet or meteor smashing into the Earth.  The film's main
dinosaur Aladar (voiced by D.B. Sweeney) attempts to lead a group of
other dinosaurs (as well as the monkeys who raised him... long story) to
safe haven away from the destruction. 
My rating for Dinosaur is actually a composite of two separate ratings. 
The first is for the technical aspect of the film.  In terms of
execution, Dinosaur is a five star movie.  The computer generated
animation (with digitally enhanced real life backgrounds) are simply
gorgeous.  Granted the real world shots are limited, but when they are
used it's some of the most flawless integration of real film and
computer animation I've ever seen. 
Secondly, there are three fantastic sequences in the film.  The first is
the opening of the film... the "Egg Travels" sequence that was seen in
the initial trailers for the film.  The next one (and the best of the
three) is the meteor shower.  And last is the climactic battle between
Aladar and a T. Rex. 
Finally, there's the rousing score by James Newton Howard, his best (and
most memorable) since 1994's Wyatt Earp.  His score here should be
rewarded at year's end with numerous awards. 
The other aspect of the film's rating is the creative side, and it
unfortunately receives only one star.  Dinosaur is about as creative as
a pile of mud, and only slightly more entertaining.  Amazingly, SEVEN
people are credited with writing Dinosaur (two with the story, three
with the actual screenplay itself, and two with "additional story
material").  I'd love to have sat in on those brainstorming sessions... 
"Good one!  Hey... what if we have one dinosaur who can't keep up and
our hero dinosaur has to keep nudging it and giving words of
encouragement!" 
Hey folks, give me one dollar... that's roughly 1/7th of what you'll pay
to get in to Dinosaur and I'll let you watch me walk.  I'll even bring a
friend along to poke me whenever I can't keep up and to tell me to
"never give up". 
The biggest creative pitfall of Dinosaur is the fact that the dinosaurs
talk.  Now I know there was no chance in hell Di$ney would make a movie
like this without dialogue (no talking plush dolls to sell for $30.00
each), but the film would have been much more effective if it had done
without the talking.  The aforementioned "The Egg Travels" sequence was
so effective without one word of dialogue in it.  You understood all the
action and emotions in the scene without the need for one spoken word. 
So let's talk about talking dinosaurs for a moment then.  I know
Dinosaur is a kid's movie and I know you're not really supposed to argue
logic with kid's movies, but I just can't turn off that part of my brain
like Di$ney wants me to.  My main problem is that the dinosaurs are
using modern day terms and expressions.  Now fine, I'll buy the fact
that the dinosaurs are speaking English even though no such language
existed.  For argument's sake I'll buy that what we're hearing is just
an English translation of dinosaur speak.  But why do they have to use
modern day terminology and catch phrases?  I mean... school? 
Professor?  Love monkey?! 
And how do the characters even know what they are?  Characters are aware
if they are a monkey or a T. Rex or whatever... but these are terms
humans came up with to describe animals.  Dinosaurs didn't tell us what
they wanted to be called.  Then there's a BRITISH dinosaur.  If all the
dinosaurs had one accent (American, Russian, Norwegian, whatever...) I'd
have been fine.  But having different accents in there just throws
everything out of whack.  (Yes, I realize that the entire language
itself was made up by humans so technically the dinosaurs shouldn't know
any of the words at all, but when they speak they... oh dear I've gone
cross-eyed.) 
The dinosaur hierarchy also doesn't make any sense.  One dinosaur has a
pet dinosaur, and the pet dinosaur behaves like a dog and is unable to
speak.  Why?  And the "villain" of the film, the T. Rex, doesn't talk
either.  If you're going to aim for every cliché in the book (and the
writers clearly were), then why not make the T. Rex all creepy and
menacing by casting Jeremy Irons or Dennis Hopper to do its voice? 
If you want to see a kid cry, go up to one leaving the theater. 
Dinosaur actually has a happy ending, with surviving dinosaurs
frolicking in the promised land without a care in the world.  Go up to
that kid and tell him or her that about a week after the movie is over,
all the cute little dinosaurs they just fell in love with will be dead. 
It's fun, and historically accurate. 
Dinosaur is rated PG for some intense scenes, and deservedly so.  But
the audience I saw the film with didn't seem to care.  Kids are
fascinated with dinosaurs... they're the only monsters we tell kids
about that actually exist.  They'll laugh at the monkeys and at the
stupid dialogue and make their parents take them to see it over and over
again, earning Di$ney billions of dollars.  And at Di$ney, that's all
they care about.  [PG]

Susan Granger's review of "DINOSAUR" (Walt Disney Pictures)
 Cinematic dinosaurs have always captured our
imagination. Back in 1905, an early film called "Prehistoric Man" is
believed to have featured the first animated dinosaur.  Then animation
pioneer Winsor McCay made "Gertie the Dinosaur" and Willis O'Brian did
"The Lost World."  Others followed. Disney showed a battle between a
Tyrannosaurus Rex and a Stegosaur in the original "Fantasia" and, in
1993, "Jurassic Park" introduced the first computer-generated
dinosaurs. IMAX then did a 3-D version with "T-Rex: Back to the
Cretaceous." So this visually thrilling, technical marvel, "Dinosaur"
continues the legacy, ingeniously depicting these giant reptiles with
expressive, distinctive personalities in a wondrous "photorealistic"
world, blending digitally enhanced live-action photography, special
effects, and computer-animated characters.
  This story revolves around Alador, an orphaned Iguanodon,
who is raised from an egg by a lively clan of lemurs and, eventually,
reunited with other herbivores in the midst of a desperate
migration. Perils abound - from natural disasters, like a devastating
meteor storm, to brutal attacks by voracious carnivores.  Problem is:
there's no whimsy, no light-heartedness. "Dinosaur" is heavy-going
serious in the scripting department, utilizing many of the same
"misfit" plot points as "The Jungle Book," "Tarzan" and "The Lion
King" - extolling kindness, generosity, perseverance and hope - but
with no real villain, no emotional involvement, and no colorful,
amusing characters. Rated PG, it might scare the tiny tots so judge
accordingly. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Dinosaur" is an
amazing, spectacular 7, filled with striking visual excitement. But
it's great splendor in need of some fun.

_Dinosaur_ marks another advancement for Walt Disney Pictures' animation
division.  It is the first computer-animated feature from the Mouse to be
produced entirely in-house, as opposed to their hit collaborations with
the Pixar animation studio.  The film also convincingly blends CGI
characters with live action backdrops.  With such innovation on display,
it's unfortunate that the makers of _Dinosaur_ couldn't find a more
interesting story to tell.
_Dinosaur_'s story is typical of Disney's traditionally animated
features, where a young protagonist comes of age.  Here it is the young
iguanodon Aladar (voiced by D.B. Sweeney), who is raised by a loving
family of lemurs after his egg is displaced (in a truly spectacular
wordless opening sequence).  Aladar's pleasant life with foster
caregivers Yar (Ossie Davis) and Plio (Alfre Woodard) is violently
interrupted when a meteorite destroys their island home, and they and
young lemurs Zini (Max Casella) and Suri (Hayden Panettiere) find
themselves with a herd of dinos braving battering heat and a lack of
water to make it to their lush nesting ground.
That's the entire film--the dinosaurs making their long trek to the
nesting ground, with Aladar coming into his own while bonding with
budding love interest Neera (Julianna Margulies) as well as old dinos
Eema (Della Reese) and Baylene (Joan Plowright), and butting heads with
the group's leader Kron (Samuel E. Wright), who sees no fault with
letting the weak in the pack get lost and/or die.  There are some good,
thrilling set pieces, namely those involving the ravenous carnotaurs who
stalk the pack.  But they are just pieces in the larger puzzle that is
Aladar's coming of age, a tale that Disney has told in more entertaining
and emotionally satisfying ways in films past.
However, Disney hasn't told the tale in such a visually striking way. 
The seamless compositing of the CGI creatures with the live action
settings has a lot to do with the nearly photo-real quality of the
computer effects.  The textures, from Aladar's scaly skin to the fur of
the lemurs, are remarkably lifelike and meticulously detailed.  The
creatures also move convincingly like dinosaurs; the dinosaurs' ability
to speak aside, the film feels like an authentic recreation of life
during the cretaceous.
Perhaps that's why that opening sequence, in which Aladar's egg is
removed from its nest and dropped onto the lemur island, is _Dinosaur_'s
big highlight.  Told without a single spoken word, it is so compelling
because it feels so real.  When the speech and the familiar story kick
in, the film feels less so--and, hence, less fresh.  _Dinosaur_ is indeed
a sight to behold--and one well worth paying the full movie ticket price
to see--but it could've been a more nourishing feast for the mind.

     For approximately five minutes, the computer-animated DINOSAUR is
undeniably spectacular. The story creeps up without dialogue, following
the fate of one little dinosaur egg from its trampled, abandoned nest
across an astonishing primeval landscape. Creatures of the water nudge the
leathery ovum along in lakes teeming with life; creatures of the air carry
it over plateaus and through verdant valleys. Seven years removed from the
revolutionary screen creations of JURASSIC PARK, I didn't think it would
be possible for the mere sight of digital dinosaurs to seize the
imagination, but it happens in DINOSAUR nonetheless. With its entirely
visual storytelling, DINOSAUR's prologue offers a giddiness-inducing
prospect: an introduction to a lost world as quietly, primally engrossing
as Kubrick's "dawn of man" prologue to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.
     I knew going into DINOSAUR that it was a Disney film aimed at kids,
so I can't say I was expecting anything more profound than the story it
ultimately provided. That didn't make its presence any less disappointing. 
That story follows an Iguanodon named Aladar (voiced by D. B. Sweeney),
orphaned in true Disney protagonist fashion after hatching from the
aforementioned egg to a family of primitive Lemurs. He lives happily with
his adopted mother Plio (Alfre Woodard), grandfather Yar (Ossie Davis) and
brother Zini (Max Casella) until a meteor shower wreaks havoc on the
lemur's habitat. Aladar and his family find themselves back in the realm
of the dinosaurs, joined with a herd migrating across a decimated
landscape in hopes of finding their nesting ground spared from the
meteors' destruction.
     Along the way, of course, conflicts develop. The Aladar clan
befriends and helps a pair of geriatric dinos -- Brachiosaur Baylene (Joan
Plowright) and Styrachosaur Eema (Della Reese) -- much to the
consternation of the herd's proto-Darwinian Iguanodon leader Kron (Samuel
E. Wright, erstwhile Sebastian from THE LITTLE MERMAID). Aladar,
previously isolated from any others of his kind, swoons over Kron's
sweet-natured sister Neera (Julianna Margulies), further provoking Kron's
wrath. There are confrontations with a pack of hungry Velociraptors and
with a pair of equally hungry Carnotaurs (think T. rex, only with even
worse dispositions and devilish horns). There are close calls, narrow
escapes and grand battles.
     Yaaaaaaawwn. Disney's animated features have generally been pretty
formulaic, so it's no shock to discover that DINOSAUR features a
by-the-numbers script. This variation, however, is so relentlessly somber
and dreary that there's nothing left but formula. The personalities of the
principal characters are so bland and the vocal performances so uninspired
that the characters threaten to disappear into the backgrounds -- no small
feat considering the overwhelming brown-ness of the desolate
post-apocalyptic scenery. Even the minor characters like Zini and Eema --
those theoretically present to provide a little comic relief -- can't
inject any life into the film. In recent Disney films, the musical numbers
have come off as purely obligatory, but I found myself pleading for a
snappy tune to breathe some life into the film. It's hard to imagine what
young viewers would find to embrace in this grim production, and even
harder to imagine what would keep an adult awake. 
     There's no denying that the technology involved in the creation of
DINOSAUR is extraordinary, mixing the computerized cast with some
real-world settings so seamlessly that it's virtually impossible to tell
where reality and hard drive overlap. Apparently, however, co-director
Ralph Zondag has become no more adept at dinosaur-driven storytelling than
he was for the limp 1993 animated feature WE'RE BACK! That film seemed
rushed into theaters to capitalize on that summer's Jurassic juggernaut. 
This one misses its opportunity to step out of the Spielbergian shadow,
gradually devolving into a series of all-too-familiar set pieces. That's a
sad end to a film that begins with so much promise. Of course no one would
risk millions on DINOSAUR without anthropomorphized animals. Better to
recycle Disney's orphan fetish without a whiff of personality or humor,
its early grandeur slowly but steadily fading into extinction.
