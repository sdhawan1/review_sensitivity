   One sister gets married, then the other sister does. 
There's not much plot in Garry Marshall's new movie, but
that's not what we came for.  "The Other Sister" features a
crackerjack performance by Juliette Lewis, the twenty-four-
year old actress whose career has found her in vulnerable
roles but with a determined sexual presence.  In her most
complex performance to date, Lewis plays Carla Tate, a mildly
retarded young woman who seeks first a refuge from her
overprotective mother, later opts for the independence of her
own apartment, and finally goes for the same pleasures of
domesticity that are the birthright of every decent person.
  At the opening of the story, Carla (Juliette Lewis) is headed
home from an institution for the mentally challenged,
accompanied by her well-heeled dad, Bradley (Tom Skerritt). 
She has mixed feelings, and no wonder.  Her mother,
Elizabeth (Diane Keaton), does not treat her like the grown-
up woman she is, but instead smothers her, insisting that she
need not go back to school at least in the near future, and
demonstrating virtually no trust in a rosy future for her
slow-talking, slow-thinking girl. Apparently forgetting that
Carla has at the same emotional needs as her other two
daughters, Caroline and Heather, she is later dismayed to
discover that Carla has formed an emotional bond with a
mentally-challenged young baker, Daniel (Giovanni Ribisi)
and wants an apartment of her own.  While Elizabeth basks
in the glow of Caroline, who is about to marry a devilishly
handsome and articulate fellow, she is none too delighted
with young Heather, a lesbian whose partner Michelle is
ostracized and refused an invitation to Caroline's wedding.
   The principal attraction of the movie is Juliette Lewis,
whose portrayal of an intellectual dull and emotionally volatile
20-something is deeper and more affecting than was Dustin
Hoffman's poker-faced performance as Barry Levinson's
autistic "Rain Man."  She draws laughs by her innocent way
of fouling up dignified affairs.  In one scene, her mother is
being honored for her founding of a shelter for stray dogs. 
Carla blamelessly barks at one German Shepherd and opens
the gates to free the animals from their benefactors.  In the
film's prize moments, Carla takes advantage of a free facial
makeover at a San Francisco department store, not realizing
that only half the face is to be a promotion, the other
requiring fifty dollars.  She ambles away from the store hiding
her plain side from the staring crowds not unlike Brendan
Gleeson's Cahill in John Boorman's "The General."  
   Giovanni Ribisi turns in a fine complementary role as
Carla's intellectually limited boyfriend, Daniel, and in several
scenes that are too cute by half, the two lovebirds negotiate a
mutually satisfactory day to "do it."  They follow the
guidelines of Alex Comfort's "The Joy of Sex" as though it
were a textbook for a course they are taking at a private
academy--where Carla manages to get a passing grade in
her computer science class.
  Garry Marshall, best-known for directing "Pretty Woman,"
the remarkable "Frankie and Johnny" but also turkeys like
"Dear God," evokes a stirring performance from Juliette Lewis
while contenting himself with more one-sided dispatches from
Diane Keaton as smother-mother and Tom Skerritt as a
caring, but bland and underdeveloped dad.  Life among the
wealthy in a San Francisco suburb is sharply photographed
by Dante Spinotti in a film which at first sounds like yet
another insipid "Stepmom" but emerges as a winning account
of the fears and joys of a remarkable young woman.

The Other Sister (1999) 2 stars out of 4. Starring Juliette Lewis, Giovanni
Ribisi, Diane Keaton and Tom Skerritt.
 Sometimes you can tell a film has problems merely by reading its credits.
 Four writers are credited with the story for The Other Sister, two of whom
went on to write the screenplay. And if ever there was a clear example of
that clich√© about too many cooks ... this is it.
 For The Other Sister lacks a definitive focus. It spreads itself too thin
trying to cover too many points. It is a movie that feels more cobbled
together by committee than written.
 And what exactly is The Other Sister? A love story? A dramatic
mother-daughter character study? A two-hour promo showcasing the abilities
of the mentally challenged coping and functioning without being a burden on
society?
 I do not mean to sound insensitive, but at times The Other Sister seems to
be all of the above. It also has a disturbing underlying aura of
patronization and condescension.
 The Other Sister is the story of Carla Tate, a slightly retarded young
woman recently returned home from many years at a "special school."
Carla (Juliette Lewis) yearns for freedom. She wants to prove to her family
- and especially her mother - that she can take care of herself.
 Her mother, Elizabeth (Diane Keaton), is an overprotective control freak
who tries to manage Carla's every waking second.
 Carla rebels, and she is reluctantly allowed to enroll at the local
community college and eventually get her own apartment. She also meets
Danny (Giovanni Ribisi), a mentally challenged young man, and the two fall
in love.
 Any student of movies can guess the rest, and despite the quartet of
writers, the plot doesn't really deviate from the path you expect.
 What keeps The Other Sister from being unbearable is the stellar
performance by Lewis. A gifted young actress who is best known for playing
troubled teens (Cape Fear, Natural Born Killers), she shows zest and heart.
 Lewis creates a whole woman out of what could have been a one-dimensional
stereotypical character. She is capable, yet vulnerable, sweet, yet steely,
childlike and calculating.
 In other words, she is a typical young woman.
 Ribisi holds his own as the young man who wants to make a life with Carla.
He brings a warmth and maturity to his Danny. Despite his disability, you
feel confident he can and will succeed.
 Tom Skerritt is wise and loving as Carla's father. He overcomes the
cliched aspects of his character to breathe life into a man who sees that
to hold onto his daughter he must let her go.
 Which brings us to Keaton. Her Elizabeth, unfortunately, throws the movie
a-kilter. Basically, she is a one-note, grating, mother from hell. She
talks sweetly and professes to love her daughter. And while we don't doubt
her sincerity and concern for Carla's well-being, she comes off as
condescending and a bit duplicitous. She feels that the only way Carla can
be safe and protected is if she listens to mother.
 And while The Other Sister can be described as a bittersweet romantic
comedy, Keaton's performance almost pushes it over into melodrama.
 Director Garry Marshall, who also is one of the four writers as well as
one of the screenwriters, could have done some trimming on the running
time. At nearly two hours, The Other Sister moves at an uneven pace. There
are a few dead spots, too many scenic views of San Francisco.
 The Other Sister is a flawed film, made palatable by the performances of
Lewis, Ribisi and Skerritt, but a more focused screenplay could have raised
it higher.

_The_Other_Sister_ (PG-13) * (out of ****)
A couple of days ago a friend told me about a conversation he had with
screenwriter Robin Schiff about a sequel she had written to her fun,
frothy _Romy_and_Michele's_High_School_Reunion_.  In this promising
second installment of the bubbleheaded blonde best buddies' adventures,
Lisa Kudrow's Michele gets hitched, and she and Mira Sorvino's Romy open
up their own restaurant, complete with--yes--a lunch special for
businesswomen.
Sadly, Touchstone turned down the script, citing that it would not draw
an audience even though the original was a midsize hit.  But if Buena
Vista's idea of audience-drawing films are projects like
_The_Other_Sister_, the Mouse is in serious trouble.  In this film,
Juliette Lewis stars as Carla Tate, a mentally challenged young woman who
wants to be treated like an independent adult once she returns home after
years at a special school.  Her parents, however--especially her
overbearing mother (Diane Keaton)--are hesitant to let her go.  Carla's
romance with Danny McMahon (Giovanni Ribisi), another mentally challenged
student at her vocational school (the scenes at which were all filmed at
my and Cameron Diaz's alma mater, Long Beach Polytechnic High School),
gives Carla's parents more reason to worry.
I could see this story possibly working as a drama; Lewis is
particularly effective, delivering an understated and often touching turn
as Carla.  But director/co-scripter (with Bob Brunner) Garry Marshall
play the material for laughs.  Cheap laughs.  For a film that aims to
empower the mentally challenged, almost all the attempted comedy comes at
the expense of Carla and Danny.  Marshall would probably argue that the
audience is laughing with them, but when a scene where Carla loudly yet
earnestly describes human reproduction is played for comedy, the audience
is clearly supposed to laugh _at_ her.  The same thing goes for the
entirety of Ribisi's performance, which is over-the-top to the point of
mockery.  The press notes describe _The_Other_Sister_ as "uplifting" and
"bittersweet"; a more accurate description would be "insulting."

This film is totally delightful.  Juliette Lewis is excellent as
the mentally disabled Carla Tate, who has recently returned home
after years in a home for disabled youngsters.  From the moment
she returns home, she is on a quest for independence and proves
that she is willing to do anything to get it.  Her life takes a
totally different turn when she meets Danny (Giovanni Ribisi)
while attending vocational school.
They fall in love and much of the movie focuses on her efforts to
convince her mother, Elizabeth (Diane Keaton), that she is no longer
a little girl but a grown up woman with the same hopes and dreams as
other women her age.
Keaton is excellent in her role of the overprotective mother
who means well but who can't seem to stop trying to control the
lives of her three daughters or to get over her guilt of sending
Laura away to school.  Tom Skerritt is also good as Laura's
father who has somehow managed to stay sane despite a bout with
alcoholism and dealing with a controlling and guilt ridden wife.
Ribisi is great as Danny who is more in touch with his emotions
and life than most people who are not mentally disabled.
Both he and Lewis are uninhibited in their roles which allows for
many of the enjoyable and, oftentimes, humorous scenes in the
film.  This movie is definitely well worth seeing.

"The Other Sister" is one of the most genuinely sweet love stories to 
come along in quite some time. Well-directed by Garry Marshall, the 
film, if anything, puts to an even larger shame the false sentimentality 
and writing of the recent "Message in a Bottle," for here you actually 
do believe that the two central characters are in love without having to 
suffer through one unbelievable tragedy after another.
At the start of "The Other Sister," Carla Tate (Juliette Lewis), a 
mildly retarded young woman in her early 20s, has just obtained a 
certificate from a special school she has gone to for a large chunk of 
the latter part of her life. Returning to her family's wealthy San 
Francisco home, and to her overprotective, but loving mother (Diane 
Keaton) and more understanding father (Tom Skerritt), Carla announces 
that she wants to be a veterinarian's assistant one day and also wants 
to go to the local Polytechnic school, even though it is primarily for 
people without a mental disability. On the first day there, she meets 
Daniel (Giovanni Ribisi), who also is mentally disabled, at the 
registration center and helps him out when someone calls him a "retard." 
Thus begins a delicate relationship between Carla and Daniel, both of 
which can understand the other person unlike anyone else, since they are 
both very much alike in their ways of thinking. Carla is intrigued to 
find out early on that Daniel has an apartment of his own, which his 
father is paying for while he is in school, and she decides that it's 
time she get an apartment herself. 
It is difficult to describe the "plot" of "The Other Sister," since the 
film wisely has decided to be more of a character study between two 
people who, yes, do have a disability, but are able to love each other 
just like anyone else can. It is this aspect of the film that I 
appreciated the most, because the screenplay, by Garry Marshall and Bob 
Brunner, does not look upon or treat the characters of Carla and Daniel 
as "different," nor do they want to make us feel pity for them. Quite 
the contrary, they are regarded as regular people who do have a handicap 
to deal with in their lives but not when dealing with each other. The 
dialogue between the two also never feels anything short of exact and 
accurate, and through their actions we quickly are allowed to care very 
much about them, while we also can laugh with joy at their veritable 
innocence.
Juliette Lewis, always an interesting and talented actress (1991's "Cape 
Fear," 1993's "What's Eating Gilbert Grape," 1996's "The Evening Star"), 
gives a tour de force performance after being absent from the screen 
since 1996, and she proves here in spades that she is nothing short of a 
brilliant actress, one of the best of her generation. To substantiate 
this point, take a look at her in this film, and then view her as an 
unstable serial killer in 1994's "Natural Born Killers." If Lewis could 
not be classified as diverse, no one can, and if Academy Award members 
did not have such frustratingly short attention spans, Lewis would 
certainly garner a Best Actress nomination come next year, and there is 
no doubt in my mind that she would have this year if the picture had 
been released in December. To avoid short-changing Giovanni Ribisi, he 
also gives a completely believable performance and amazingly has a lot 
of chemistry with Lewis. As Carla's mother, Diane Keaton develops her 
character to be one that we don't always agree with since, after all, 
she is so overprotective, but also one that we can relate to and 
understand her reasoning behind certain judgements. And also lighting up 
the proceedings, even with a relatively small part, is Poppy Montgomery 
as one of Carla's sisters, who was the highlight of last year's 
otherwise badly-made comedy, "Dead Man on Campus." When, or if, 
Montgomery is ever cast in a lead role, I have no doubt that she will be 
able to pull it off, since she has already marginally salvaged one poor 
film and has made an impression here with only a limited amount of 
screen time.
Throughout "The Other Sister," the more dramatic moments are always 
skillfully done and, thankfully, never overly dramatic. In one 
particular scene where Daniel discovers he failed his school class, the 
film wisely uses a light emotional tone, avoiding simple melodrama, and 
therefore comes off as a far more effective and touching moment. Without 
giving away anything, another heartbreaking sequence, and one that 
admittedly did bring a few tears to my eyes, involved Daniel saying 
something very much inappropriate in front of a crowd, which brings 
Carla to a state of confusion, anger, and tears, and the following scene 
set in a parking lot between the two could not have been as powerful 
without the performances that director Marshall was able to get out of 
Lewis and Ribisi.
Although perhaps a bit overlong (with a running time of 130 minutes, a 
few scenes could have easily been edited out without losing anything 
substantial), "The Other Sister" is probably the most winning and joyful 
film I have seen so far in 1999. The love story element got me deeply 
involved in the characters, and the handling of the mental disability 
angle was subtle and intelligent. But what I will remember most, and 
will continue to remember throughout the year, is Juliette Lewis' 
flawless, lovely performance. Not even the nearly incomparable Meryl 
Streep could have done it any better, and that is, for sure, a testament 
to Lewis' wonderful abilities.

Screenplay:  Bob Brunner and Garry Marshall.

Running Time:  127 minutes.
Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.
     I never bought Dustin Hoffman as an autistic savant in RAIN MAN.  Tom
Hanks as slow-witted FORREST GUMP was all vocal mannerisms.  Kevin Bacon
in the soon-to-video DIGGING TO CHINA seemed to be mimicking Pee-Wee
Herman.  Movie stars trying to play mentally handicapped characters do so
for any number of reasons -- the parts are juicy, the challenge is unique,
and (if two of the three above examples are any indication) the chance for
an Oscar is pretty good.  Clearly plenty of viewers (and other critics)
eat up such portrayals with a spoon.  I generally spend two hours watching
a movie star failing miserably at suspending my disbelief.
     THE OTHER SISTER is a ghastly exercise for any number of reasons, but
the primary reason is Juliette Lewis.  Lewis plays Carla Tate, a
24-year-old woman with a slight mental handicap who has spent several
years in a "special" boarding school.  Returned at last to her wealthy San
Francisco family, Carla finds that the adjustment is difficult on both
sides.  Her mother Elizabeth (Diane Keaton) alternately coddles Carla and
pretends she is completely normal, while father Bradley (Tom Skerritt)
quietly deals with his guilt at having sent her away at all.  Into this
picture steps Danny McMahon (Giovanni Ribisi), a young man with a similar
mental handicap living on his own.  Carla is inspired by his independence,
and tries to break away from her family even as she and Danny become
romantically attracted to each other.
     The set-up for THE OTHER SISTER owes a major debt to the 1979
TV-movie "Like Normal People," in which Linda Purl and Shaun Cassidy
played the developmentally challenged young people coping with familial
opposition to their romance.  Leave it to director Garry Marshall to make
a TV-movie look like a paradigm of subtlety and sensitivity.  THE OTHER
SISTER is nearly as big a narrative mess as Marshall's all-but-unwatchable
DEAR GOD, and as unabashedly candy-coated as his PRETTY WOMAN (the
Disney-does-lesbians subplot involving Carla's older sister is nearly as
convincing as Disney-does-hookers).  The story leaps from episode to
episode in search of a consistent tone, dragging its fine cast through the
muck along the way.  Diane Keaton fusses and fumes as a parody of a
patrician dame trying to ignore the lack of "normalcy" in her family; Tom
Skerritt fares better as the stolid, slightly passive dad.  They're the
worst kind of Hollywood character constructions, sit-com versions of Mary
Tyler Moore and Donald Sutherland in ORDINARY PEOPLE.
     And the wacky premise for that sit-com just isn't funny.  I'm sure
that everyone involved in THE OTHER SISTER felt they were making a
heart-warming tale of triumph over adversity, which it very well might
have been if there seemed to be a shred of authenticity to the situations.
Lewis is a large part of the problem, and not necessarily because she does
such a terrible job.  It's somehow easier to buy Ribisi, though his
performance certainly isn't light-years beyond Lewis's.  Juliette Lewis,
however, is always Juliette Lewis, from the first minute she's on screen
until the last, an actress trying to convince me she's a mentally
handicapped person.  Watching Lewis screw up her face and twist her
dialogue becomes like watching a white actor playing a character in
blackface -- not just a case of miscasting, but wrong on a gut level.
     That reaction isn't mitigated by a script which, frankly, draws
nearly every one of its laughs from the goofy behavior of its handicapped
characters.  Viewers may kid themselves into thinking they're laughing
good-naturedly at the struggles of these characters to be more like
"normal people," but every gag is really at their expense.  THE OTHER
SISTER is a sideshow masquerading as a feel-good tale -- see the
handicapped kids trying to figure out sex!  see them get drunk and say
inappropriate things!  Indeed, THE OTHER SISTER stands as a shining
example of all that can go wrong in a film about mentally handicapped
people.  In the rare examples that have worked -- Leonardo DiCaprio in
WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE, Tom Hulce in DOMINICK AND EUGENE -- you felt
someone was telling a real story of which handicapped characters happened
to be a part.  This one finds Juliette Lewis shucking and jiving in a
handicapped minstrel show.

Carla Tate, played with an inviting spunk by Juliette Lewis, has gotten
her own apartment.  Although generally not unusual for a woman who's
about twenty, it is for her since she's a mentally challenged young
woman just out of a boarding school for those with diminished
capacities.  Described by her doctor as someone who "pushes the edge of
the envelope," Carla wants to explore the world on her own, and she even
has her first boyfriend, Daniel, played equally realistically and
charmingly by Giovanni Ribisi from SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. Carla and Daniel
have been taunted all their lives as "retards," but, now grown, they are
really enjoying their lives and their newfound freedom.
As directed by PRETTY WOMAN's Garry Marshall and written by him and Bob
Brunner, THE OTHER SISTER is two movies for the price of one, but only
one is worth paying for.  Watching Carla and Daniel's beautiful but
naturally awkward love affair and experiencing their coping with the
world provides a wonderful movie-going experience that is alternately
sweet, poignant, romantic and humorous.  It does all this without ever
falling into crass manipulation.  Unabashedly uplifting, the movie never
stoops to exploiting the vulnerability of the leads' conditions.
Carla and Daniel are as natural and believable as the supporting
characters are plastic and clich√©d.  As Carla's mother, Diane Keaton is
a rich busybody, who likes to flip rapidly through the pages the
"American Art" magazine in reverse.  She orders Carla around like a
6-year-old, not the independent woman Carla thinks she is.  Tom Skerritt
plays Carla's loving Dad, a reformed alcoholic, who wants the best for
Carla.  Scenes vaguely link his old drinking habits with some of Carla's
difficulties.  In completely unnecessary plot embellishments, the family
also has two other daughters, one a lesbian and one about to be married,
and a longtime, live-in maid, who serve only to clutter up the storyline
and take screen time away from the leads.
Although her mother pooh-poohs all of her ambitions, Carla enrolls at
the Bay Area Polytechnic so that she can eventually become a
veterinarian's assistant.  It is at school that she meets Daniel.  Their
first date is to a bus terminal.  Daniel's passion is college bands, and
it is from the bus station that he takes the bus to the games.  Every
destination placard is music to Daniel's ears since it reminds him of
the college nearby.  Daniel, who likes to play loud marching band CDs in
his apartment, doesn't understand Carla's preference for dead blues
singers.  Nevertheless, they hit it off marvelously, and the quirky,
romantic chemistry between them is a joy to behold.
Having never dated, sex - what they call "doing it" - is constantly on
their minds, but they don't rush it.  Approaching it like a subject in
school, they get "The New Joy of Sex" book and discuss which page
numbers they like and which they don't.  This is done so seriously and
sweetly that it will have you doubling over with laughter.  ("I wonder
who thought sex up in the first place, Daniel" Carla asks inquisitively.
"I think it was Madonna," he replies seriously.)
The movie works best in its many innocent moments.  On Halloween,
Daniel, dressed as a cute little puppy, comes to pick up Carla, as a
swan, for the Halloween party.  With self-mocking humor, he laughingly
assures Carla's fastidious mother with her multimillion dollar, spotless
mansion, "Don't worry, cause I've been housetrained."
The movie builds toward an emotional crescendo that will fill you with
tears, many of joy.  Even if the last act is full of predictable scenes,
they are so exuberant that they are delightful.  Every time the movie
approaches the mawkish line, it manages to avoid stepping over it,
mainly through the strength of the astonishing acting by Lewis and
Ribisi.
"I love you more than band music and more than cookie making," Daniel
tells Carla.  That a movie could make a line like that sound genuine is
all the testimony it needs.
THE OTHER SISTER runs a bit too long at 2:10.  It is rated PG-13 for
thematic elements involving sexuality and would be fine for kids around
12 and up.

It is apparent that the makers of The Other Sister intended their film
to be a thoughtful comedy-drama exploring the subjects of love and
mental retardation. But, the film's depiction of mental retardation
never rises above a simple gimmick. The end result is slightly
condescending to the audience (and its characters), and robs the film
from any hope of its intended dramatic impact.  However, The Other
Sister is still able to skate by (barely) on the merits of its comedy.
The main character of The Other Sister is Carla Tate (Juliette Lewis), a
mentally retarded teen who has just returned home from an institution.
Her rich parents, Elizabeth (Diane Keaton) and Radley (Tom Skerritt),
don't quite know what to do with her.  Carla's goal is to get a high
school diploma and become a veterinarian's assistant. Elizabeth thinks
that's out of the question.
But Carla is determined to declare her independence, whether her parents
approve or not. Soon, she's enrolled in the local PolyTechnic school,
and hunting for an apartment of her own.
The final test of her parents' patience comes when she meets Danny
(Giovanni Ribisi), a classmate of hers who is also mentally retarded.
The two form a quick friendship, and fall in love.  But when the topics
of sex and marriage are raised, Carla's parents are at a complete loss.
Juliette Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi apparently attended the same acting
class on the subject of portraying the mentally handicapped. They both
deliver the same affectations, and an overabundance of mannerisms that
bely a true lack of confidence in their characterizations. They are
never able to get lost in the characters; in each and every scene, you
are always acutely aware that you're watching someone acting.
The script provides them plenty of crutches to work with: She has a
childlike affinity for animals, and he has a childlike affinity for
marching bands.  She throws a childlike tantrum when people laugh at
her, he throws a childlike tantrum when he is called "stupid".  But
these lovable quirks are the end-all and be-all of their characters.
And it doesn't end with Carla and Danny...every single character in the
film can be singularly identified by a defining quirk.
The Other Sister has its cute moments, several of which actually do
work. However, the majority of the movie is elaborately over-staged. The
film is perfectly willing to sacrifice believability for a quick laugh.
The movie is also surprisingly long.  It clocks in at over two hours, an
excessive amount of time for what is in actuality a simple romantic
comedy.
The Other Sister is much too self-conscious to pack any dramatic weight.
But, as a lightweight, throwaway romantic comedy it's harmlessly
entertaining.

        There is a scene early in "The Other Sister" which
demonstrates the kind of film it could have been.  Carla Tate
(Juliette Lewis), a slightly retarted young woman in her late
teens, has just come home from an institution.  Sitting at
the dinner table with her family for the first time in a decade,
Carla proudly eats her meal with a fork, something she was
unable to do the last time they saw her.  No one at the table
notices, or offers any sort of positive reinforcement.
Undeterred, Carla continues to eat her food, though her eyes
register a subtle look of hurt and disappointment.
        It's a thoughtful scene, indicative of a movie that
plans to take an honest, unabashed look at the world of the
mentally handicapped and the challenges and triumphs
contained therein.  Unfortunately, it's the only such moment
in the film.  "The Other Sister" rapidly plummets to the
level of crowd-pleasing formula, cheerfully abandoning the
opportunity to say anything worthwhile.  Worse, director
Garry Marshall and his screenwriters seem to be laughing
at the concept of retardation, and encouraging, no,
*begging*, the audience to do the same.
        Carla has a difficult time adjusting to home life,
thanks to her mother, Elizabeth (Diane Keaton), a stuffy,
overbearing woman who seems determined to shape her
daughter into something she has no interest in being.
Although her father Bradley (Tom Skerrit) is loving
and supportive, Carla's mother seems determined to
prevent her from doing anything that might indicate
normality, such as going to college or moving out on
her own.  Eventually, however, our heroine meets
Daniel McMann (Giovanni Ribisi), a retarded student
at a nearby technical school.  His sense of adventure
and independence impress Carla; soon the pair are
romantically linked, allowing the film to set up scene
after scene of standard romantic fare.
        There is barely a moment in "The Other Sister"
that deviates from convention or shows any independent
thought whatsoever.  Some examples: we have a "falling
in love" montage.  We have the required "couple has a
big fight and split up, only to get back together again"
scene.  We have an overbearing parent, which is standard
issue for any film that centers around a teenager.  And
when Carla's mother angrily announces that she doesn't
want Carla to have anything to do with Daniel, I was able
to predict the moment of reconciliation within three
seconds of when it actually appeared on the screen.
        An adherence to cliche is to be expected in films
of this nature, though, and it's not why I disliked the
movie.  I was offended and annoyed by the fact that "The
Other Sister" exists in a perpetual state of contradiction
with itself.  Carla understandably gets furious any time she
thinks people are laughing at her; indeed, one such scene
which occurs near the story's climax is heart-wrenching.
But despite this, the film continuiously gives Carla and
Daniel ridiculous dialogue that's clearly intended to be
funny:
        Why does Marshall want us to laugh at the
ignorance of the same people the film is supposedly
championing?  Why does the movie abandon the more
thoughtful issues it raises without so much as a
backwards glance (such as the scene in which a young
Carla pushes a little boy down the steps and severely
injures him, and another in which Daniel is being
evicted by his father for flunking out of school)?  Why
can't it devote more thought to a subplot involving
Carla's gay sister Heather (Sarah Paulson)?  As it
stands, the Heather character seems to included for no
other reason than lesbianism is "in" at the moment.
        The acting is acceptable, although neither Lewis
or Ribisi are completely convincing in these challenging
roles.  Again, I blame the script more than the actors:
their lines make them come off not as mentally retarded,
but as stand-up comedians with funny voices, rather like
Adam Sandler in "The Waterboy."
        From beginning to end, I despised "The Other
Sister," a movie which tells us not to laugh at the
disadvantaged... then conveys them as loveable goofballs
continuously spouting sitcom-tinged dialogue.  It tries
to convince us that the mentally handicapped are valiant
people, struggling in the face of adversity and deserving
our respect (a sentiment I agree with), then makes them
appear so "cutesy" that one is reminded of trained
animals performing tricks at the circus.  This is a film
that didn't need to be made, and doesn't need to be seen.

"I'm the mother of a dedicated underachiever, a gay workaholic and
Carla," says Elizabeth Tate (Diane Keaton) as she and her husband
Radley (Tom Skerritt) prepare for an afternoon on their boat.
Despite their wealth, life for the Tates has not always been smooth
sailing.
Radley is a now-sober alcoholic, while Carla (Juliette Lewis), their
youngest child, has just returned home after eight years at a "special
school." She's decided she wants to further her education and get her
own apartment, ideas that jolt her mother, who does her best to
quickly squelch any talk of Carla leaving home again. Elizabeth would
rather see Carla take origami and calligraphy classes.
The stage is set for a major throwdown, but if "The Other Sister"
sounds like it might develop into a message movie about the rights of
the mentally challenged, be forewarned that the film comes from
director Garry Marshall ("Pretty Woman," "Frankie and Johnny"). In his
world, street corner hookers look like Julia Roberts and the dumpy
waitress in a greasy spoon turns out to be Michelle Pfeiffer.
So instead of frank talk about real issues, "Sister" stubbornly
accentuates the positive, offering up gorgeous houses, chic San
Francisco apartments, frighteningly green lawns and a sweeping pop
soundtrack instead of any sort of insight into the problems a woman in
Carla's situation might face.  Even the story's major complication, a
crisis involving Carla's new boyfriend Daniel(Giovanni Ribisi), feels
wholly manufactured and unconvincing.
In the midst of all this artifice though, stands Keaton, who couldn't
be synthetic even if she tried. Elizabeth says things like "it would
behoove us to suppress the minutia," but Keaton undercuts the woman's
high-handedness with a few quirks - reading magazines backwards, for
instance - that bring surprising warmth to a character many actresses
would have written off as simply another chilly mom.
Lewis and Ribisi are also fine, if a bit studied.  Marshall regular
Hector Elizondo makes a token appearance as Daniel's understanding
landlord, and fans of 1960s TV may be amused to see Juliet Mills of
"Nanny and the Professor" fame in the role of the Tates'
trouble-shooting housekeeper.
Though slightly long at almost two anda half hours, "Sister" is
pleasant enough and occasionally even tickles the funnybone.  But
there's no real heart to the story, no emotional core. Marshall has
whipped up a glittery, lighter-than-air confection that sends you home
feeling like you missed dinner.

"The Other Sister" (1999) - Diane Keaton, Juliette Lewis, Giovanni Ribisi
        "The Other Sister" features Juliette Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi
playing characters with unspecified mental disabilities. Since this has
little bearing on the fact that it's a very good movie, it will only be
mentioned twice more during this review.
In part, "The Other Sister" is about a character most of us can
relate to: the overprotective parent, in the form of Diane Keaton. Lewis
has spent most of her life away from home at a boarding school, but
finally comes home. She has to re-adjust to her sisters ("a dedicated
underachiever and a gay workaholic," quips Keaton), her parents, a new
school, a whole new environment.
Keaton thinks she knows what's best for all her daughters, while
her more laid-back husband (Tom Skerritt) is generally willing to let them
make their own mistakes.
Lewis and Ribisi, both outcasts of a sort, meet and go through all
the traditional courting rituals, right down to a Halloween dance at their
trade school (where the always-ambitious Lewis is studying to become a
veterinary assistant).
That's right, it's a love story. That means it's bright, generally
cheerful, and we all know how it ends. It's also very well done, invoking
only a few of the cliches inherent to the genre. The unique nature of the
leads' roles even allows humor in some surprising places (watch for the
"sex talk," the ongoing references to "The Graduate," or the comic-erotic
use of marching band music).
"The Other Sister" is blatantly formulaic, from the requisite
overbearing parent to the "falling in love" montage. But everyone on
screen practically oozes charm, such that when the expected complication
in the relationship comes up, we know on a gut level that everything will
be alright.
Matching the positive mood of the movie, the technical credits are
about two notches above average. Visually, the film is as bright as its
irrepressible characters, and the soundtrack, featuring everyone from
Savage Garden to Alison Krauss, is similarly uplifting without being
obtrusive.
In fact, it's hard to find anything even remotely depressing
happening on-screen. This movie is uber-cheerful, making it almost
impossible to not like it. It somehow pulls this off without making it
obvious that it's happening.
"The Other Sister" was made by Touchstone Pictures, a part of
Disney. So it's not unfair to say that its depiction of mental retardation
is about as accurate as "Aladdin's" depiction of the Middle East. But this
is the only real failing in an otherwise excellent movie. This sin, while
arguably a large one, can be forgiven since the rest of the movie is so
darned uplifting.
(This review was originally published in The Capaha Arrow, the student
newspaper of Southeast Missouri State University.)

There are certain rules in Hollywood involving the portrayal of romantic
relationships on the big screen.  Certain combinations of leads
naturally go together ¬ñ handsome men and beautiful women being the
predominant pairing.  Lately, a trend has emerged involving cute young
adult males and lovable teenage females (usually with shows on Fox or
the WB) and, once in a while, moviegoers are treated to the unlikely
affairs of rickety old men and chicks half their age.  Stars are always
fit, have great teeth, skin and hair, and are usually white.
Films that stray from these templates of success are generally
resounding box office failures.  Why?  Because people won't line up for
Number 18 with Hunan Foot, the touching story of a Chinese guy with a
really large head who falls in love with a 70-year-old lady leper.  They
will also reject Mommy, I'm Taller Than Daddy, starring a middle-aged
single mom with a huge raised birthmark on her face and her lucky find ¬ñ
a midget with one eyebrow and a cowlick.
Howard Stern has made a career out of shining a spotlight on those
aforementioned oddities.  Until now, if you wanted to hear a drunk
dwarf, paranoid stutterers or alien lesbians, Howard was the only place
to go.  Hollywood could only ignore his phenomenal ratings for so long.
So, along comes The Other Sister (* 1/2), a film that bills itself as `a
romantic comedy for the emotionally challenged.'  Translation ¬ñ a love
story about two retards.  They meet.  They fall in love.  The have a
fight.  They get back together.  They get married.  And they drive off
with their car dragging a `Just Lobotomized!' sign.  Okay, I made that
last part up, but it would have been more original than anything in
Sister's tiresome script.
The film opens with Carla (Juliette Lewis, Natural Born Killers) having
just graduated from the Roselake, a school for mentally-challenged
children.  Carla flies home to San Francisco, where her father (Tom
Skerritt) and overbearing mother (Diane Keaton) seem intent on keeping
her at home under a watchful eye.  They live in a giant house with a
live-in maid and a gate, so one has to wonder why they didn't just lock
her in the attic.  Like the Kennedys.
But Carla has other plans.  She wants to enroll in a public vocational
school.  Her parents say no but eventually give in.  She wants her own
apartment.  Her parents say no but eventually give in.  She wants a
boyfriend.  Her parents say no but¬Öhey!  Are you tired of reading this
yet?  Try sitting through 130 minutes of it.
Lewis is remarkably unremarkable as Carla.  But, then again, Carla isn't
too far off of the roles that she usually plays.  Her love interest
Daniel (Giovanni Ribisi, Saving Private Ryan) is much better, but also
not much different from his recurring role of Phoebe's brother on
Friends.  Actually, the only difference is fake teeth.  Keaton's mother
is purposefully and pleasantly annoying while Skerritt is just plan
scary sans facial hair.
Sister was written and directed by Garry Marshall, who hit the big time
with ¬ë70s television shows like Mork and Mindy and Laverne & Shirley.
His resume as of late boasts the blockbusters Dear God and Exit to
Eden.  This is the first script he has written since 1984's The Flamingo
Kid, proving that writing must not be like riding a bike.  But, hey ¬ñ if
you watch with your eyes closed, it sounds just like Howard.

Some subjects never get a fair shake in the movies.  Mental retardation is
one: offhand, I can only think of two movies that had retarded characters who
were entirely convincing and human.  "What's Eating Gilbert Grape?" and
"Dominick and Eugene" were both wonderful movies regardless of their subject
matter.
Maybe that's the heart of the problem.        "The Other Sister" would be a
dreadful movie even if the retarded characters were Nobel laurelates.  It's
overlong (130 minutes), overplotted, tedious, contrived, and absolutely
agonizing to endure -- especially if your understanding of mental retardation
goes beyond TV movies-of-the-week.
In the film, Juliette Lewis plays Carla, a retarded girl of 18 who has spent
most of her youth in an institution for the mentally handicapped.  She now
wants to go back home and train to be a veterinarian, but her mother (Diane
Keaton), as is always the case in movies like this, is opposed to her
daughter doing anything that doesn't fulfill the label of "retarded person". 
The father (Tom Skerritt) is all for it, of course.  It wouldn't be a movie
without conflict, but the conflict here is fake.
Carla eventually enrolls in a local polytechnical school and meets up with
Danny (Giovanni Ribisi), who is also retarded, and whose job seems to consist
of unstopping the brass instruments in the school band after they've been
pelted with marshmallows during football games.  Yes.  Why are they
interested in each other at all, retardation aside?  A more honest movie
would not need to use manufactured scenes, like the cringe-inducing one where
they puzzle over "The Joy of Sex", to make them comprehensible as a couple.
The movie also commits the cardinal sin so common to movies like this, where
retardation is used as a gimmick and not taken seriously.  In one scene, Danny
gets drunk (under circumstances which any bartender or seasoned drinker would
find ludicrous) and delivers a speech that is so obviously not his own words,
but the screenwriter speaking through him.  How's about that?  The movie not
only doesn't bother to give us convincing characters who are retarded -- it
doesn't even allow them freedom of speech!
I know a fair number of retarded people.  Most of them resent being
condescended to; they are not "cute", not "quaint", not "funny", and certainly
not insensitive to callousness.  They are also, alas, not as sitcom-witty as
the folks in "The Other Sister", but that's life: nobody in real life talks
like a sitcom (and if you do, see a doctor).
The director, Garry Marshall, has Ribisi and Lewis act retarded by having
them garble half their lines and walk funny.  Does he know anyone who is
retarded? Dd they really think that the lameness of the performances would be
overcome by everyone's good intentions?  Didn't anyone realize how contrived
and phony this story was, before it was put on the rails?  Evidently not. 
"The Other Sister" (even the title is virtually inexplicable) is going to be
stuck in my craw for a long time as one of the worst movies of 1999.

Because many Americans feel awkward around people with handicaps, one 
might think a film starring two mentally challenged young people would 
not have a chance.  But the acting of Juliette Lewis, as Carla Tate, and 
Giovanni Ribisi, as Danny McMann, saves the film from the dangers of 
patronizing overtures and maudlin sentimentality.
Carla Lewis, the daughter of wealthy parents, has spent the last decade 
growing up in an exclusive boarding school for the mentally challenged.  
The film opens with her father, Dr. Radley Tate (Tom Skerritt), picking 
her up and flying with her back to their mansion and family.  Mother 
Elizabeth (Diane Keaton) is overprotective, but eventually gives in to 
various manifestations of Carla's independence.  First, Carla desires a 
high school diploma, and after her mother's resistance she succeeds in 
enrolling in a vocational school, her goal to become a veterinarian's 
assistant.  Goal number two is to obtain her own apartment, an idea she 
conceives initially from school mate Danny McMann.  Danny is also 
mentally challenged, and lives in an apartment paid for by his father.
Of course Carla's largest wish is for freedom within her relationship 
with Danny.  As the two fall in love, Carla becomes more concerned with 
her mother's opposition.  Carla has seen how her mother treats Heather 
and Caroline, Carla's sisters;  Mrs. Tate bullies one about her 
impending wedding, and refuses even to meet the lesbian lover of the 
other.  So the stage is set for extended conflicts, especially after 
Danny alienates himself from the family by humiliating Carla in front of 
the Tates' friends at Sutter Hills Country Club.
The partial result of these conflicts is a predictability that hinders 
the film.  Diane Keaton's character is so afflicted by tunnel vision 
that we begin to dislike her.  Her bull-headedness may have roots we can 
understand - an old worry about protecting the girl from childhood 
taunting.  But writers Bob Brunner and Garry Marshall extend her concern 
into obsession.  At least Keaton never becomes hysterical, but it's just 
hard to watch her redundant characterization.  As her husband Radley 
Tate - a dentist, we presume, as he gives out toothbrushes for Halloween 
- Tom Skerritt is miscast.  Skerritt is the right age to have three 
grown daughters, but perhaps the role is underdeveloped.  In any case, 
Skerritt does not seem to inhabit the role in a sense large enough to 
make it convincing.
Hector Elizondo gets to play a more fleshed-out father figure.  As 
Ernie, the owner of the apartment occupied by Danny, Elizondo is 
compassionate and supportive, if a little dry.  He also gets to show off 
his guitar playing skills, and it's always good when a director utilizes 
an actor's particular talents.  Ernie is another example of the film's 
realism, the extra dimension added by a well-written supporting role.
The best things about the picture are Lewis and Ribisi, though.  The 
nuances of their performances are quite engaging.  Just as Lewis seems 
to be in peril of over-acting, she tempers her portrayal with the 
pronunciation of a single word or a careful stride.  It is a studied 
performance - one can imagine Lewis practicing how to move or react;  
but the sweetness she brings to the role imbues the movie with a 
lightness that makes the viewer more comfortable with the subject 
matter.  Ribisi does not emphasize his mannerisms as much as Lewis does, 
but neither is his manner subtle.  "I love you more than marching bands 
and more than cookie-baking," Danny tells Carla, with one line showing a 
sincerity that makes us love him.
Another admirable trait the film displays is not solving serious 
problems easily.  The approach is almost unsettling when the characters 
disagree to the point of alienation;  although it takes awhile to set up 
and then to close these conflicts (the film runs two hours and ten 
minutes, just a little long), we are gratified by the realistic 
handling.  
For fans of 'The Graduate,' there is a wonderful schtick in which Danny 
plays the Dustin Hoffman role.  The older film is worked in wonderfully, 
and is played both for comic and serious effect.  Viewers should take 
note of another scene, a flashback Carla recalls as she ascends the 
stairs to her old bedroom.  Kendra Krull plays the young Carla with a 
sign "Follow Stupid" taped to her back, a line of children following her 
up the stairs.  When Carla lashes out and pushes a teasing boy down the 
stairs, we see the older Carla's horror instantly relived, a mix of 
guilt and revulsion at mockery.  And Carla is made touchingly human, 
feeling emotions as sharply as anyone around her.
Even though all the characters are not flawlessly written, 'The Other 
Sister' is a moving and original treatment of the boy-meets-girl, loses 
her, etc. scenario.  The film is to be admired for its gutsy approach to 
an oft-avoided topic:  it neither condescends nor lectures about 
society's treatment of people with handicaps.   'The Other Sister is 
rated PG-13 due to discussions of sex, and would be fine for children 12 
and up.

I screened this film at a special sneak preview the weekend of the 20th
whose crowd was nearly unanimous in their responses. Filmmakers often make
us laugh and cry in the same picture, "The Other Sister" accentuates these
extremes. When our audience laughed -- they laughed in a wave. It's unusual
for a group of 50 or more people to be tickled at the same time, but we
were.
Carla Tate (Lewis), the "special" daughter of Elizabeth (Keaton) returns to
the wealthy "Tate Estate" after spending many learning and growing up years
in a "dedicated" institution. Momma Tate, combatting her guilt over that
abandonment, sets out to make it up to Carla, now a young woman. Momma's
smothering-mothering blankets her two other daughters as well. So you can
guess mom's reaction when Carla wants to attend a "regular" college, have
her own apartment and then (oh-my-gosh) date.
Danny (another "unique" individual) who enjoys riding buses and listening to
marching bands, makes the move on Carla. "Will you be my girlfriend?" Carla
silently rummages through her purse. Danny worries, "Are you getting the
pepper spray?" The two fall in love. In a charming scene, they discuss the
possibility of sex -- using manuals to make sure they get it right. "Man,
who thought of sex in the first place?" ... "I think it was Madonna." These
simple yet fresh responses make the movie sincere and humorous.
Occasionally, however, restraint is lost and Carla blurts some predictably
"usual" lines that had me wincing in pain. As for Danny and his unexpected
quips -- they're completely adorable.
"Maybe we should wait for a holiday to have sex. Holiday's are special,"
Carla considers. Danny grimaces, "I feel special right now."
Aside from a few sticky moments (mostly in the early part of the film), "The
Other Sister" is strong, rich with little details, and charming. But mostly,
it impressed me with its hardy ability to tickle and tear its audience.
Side note: This is the third recent "O.S." film, and I liked them all:
October Sky, Office Space, The Other Sister. Hmmmmm.
Starring Juliette Lewis, Giovanni Ribisi, Diane Keaton and Tom Skerritt.

THE OTHER SISTER (M).  
(Touchstone/Buena Vista International)
Director: Garry Marshall
Stars: Diane Keaton, Juliette Lewis, Tom Skerritt, Giovanni Ribisi, Poppy 
Montgomery, Hector Elizondo, 
Juliet Mills, Linda Thorson
Running time: 129 minutes.
This romantic comedy about two intellectually handicapped
people who fall in love is also cloaked with the melodramatic excesses
of the typical dysfunctional family drama.  This results in a film
that is manipulative, overly sentimental, saccharine and mawkish.  But
The Other Sister will also have audiences unashamedly blubbering in
the aisles.
The Tate family is the scion of the local community.  However,
the three Tate sisters are something of a disappointment, particularly
to their mother Elizabeth (Diane Keaton), who is aware of her
prominent position in the social elite.  One of her daughters is a
workaholic lesbian, one is a determined under achiever, while the
other sister, Carla (Juliette Lewis), is intellectually handicapped.
For ten years, Carla has been shut away in an exclusive special
school, but now she has returned home.
Carla is determined to live life on her own terms, with
independence from her over protective family.  But first she has to
escape from her domineering, smothering mother, who is too wrapped up
in her social status to really listen to the concerns of her three
daughters or share in their experiences.  Father Radley (Tom Skerritt)
is more sympathetic to their needs, but finds it hard to accede to
their wishes without some sort of conflict.
Carla wants to attend a local school, so that she can learn
vital skills and further cement her independence.  At the polytech,
she meets Danny McMann (Giovanni Ribisi, from Saving Private Ryan,
etc), who is also intellectually handicapped.  He loves brass bands,
but is not quite as self confident as Carla.  He lives in a small
apartment, begrudgingly funded by his father, but is watched over by
the sympathetic caretaker Jerry (Hector Elizondo).  Romance slowly
blossoms between the two, but it is not always a smooth or happy path.
This awkwardly titled film gives Keaton and a surprisingly
strong Lewis plenty of big scenes in which they can emote for all
they're worth, and their clashes fire up the screen.  An often under
rated actor, Skerritt plays the stereotypical, understanding father
with compassion, although the script doesn't give him much to work
with.  Ribisi is also solid, although his mannered performance
occasionally reminds audiences of his character from the sitcom
Friends.  The rest of the cast, including Aussie actress Poppy
Montgomery (recently seen in Dead Man On Campus), seem to get lost and
fail to leave much of an impression on the material.
Director Garry Marshall (Pretty Woman, etc) gives audiences a
roller coaster ride of emotions, mixing humorous scenes with revealing
emotional moments, to great effect.  Although he comes from a
background in television sitcoms, Marshall is no slouch when it comes
to tugging the heart strings of his audience either (check out
Beaches, etc).  Marshall and co-writer Bob Bruner throw everything
into the mix of this uneven and over long film, and there is plenty of
unnecessary padding.  Some scenes seem embarrassing and uncomfortable,
while others work beautifully.  The film is often quite predictable,
and numerous references to the seminal The Graduate also telegraph
several key plot developments.
Nonetheless, The Other Sister is a wonderful example of the
sort of sentimental weepie that Hollywood does so well.  But not often
enough!

If you loved "Patch Adams" and "Stepmom," ignore this review and run, do 
not walk, to see "The Other Sister." If, however, you detest cheesy, 
emotionally manipulative, contrived pabulum, avoid this sap-fest like the 
plague. As the proud father of a retarded son, I generally applaud any 
film championing acceptance and independence for mentally-challenged 
individuals, but this movie is insufferable and, at 128 minutes, a 
torturous endurance test. 
Like most contemporary melodramas, "The Other Sister" features uptight 
white people fussing with their kids in affluent settings (apparently the 
filmmakers believe that those unable to stomach the story can at least 
while away the time admiring the plush houses). In this case, the rich, 
white pain-in-the-ass is Diane Keaton, playing a priggish woman standing 
in the way of her mildly-retarded daughter's romance. 
The mother of three, she beams with pride at her one "normal" daughter, a 
radiant girl about to marry an all-American guy. Meanwhile, she refuses 
to acknowledge another daughter's female lover, explaining to her 
exasperated offspring that she isn't a bigot because she donates money to 
gay causes. As for her retarded child, Mom adopts a strained martyr's 
smile anytime the girl commits a social faux-pas and throws a fit 
whenever the young woman tries to assert her independence. Tom Skerritt 
suffers nobly as the crinkle-faced ex-drunk husband, a kindly soul who 
serves as the voice of reason and acts as arbitrator between mother and 
daughter. The only intriguing question raised by the film is why a man 
like this remains married to such an unrelenting harridan. 
Juliette Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi play the mentally-challenged love 
birds, affecting "retarded" voices, but otherwise using perfect syntax 
and eloquent phrasing. Right. Never for a moment do they seem like 
anything other than two actors doing handicapped shtick. Playing a 
retarded person is difficult. Tom Hulce pulled it off in "Dominick and 
Eugene" and Leonardo DiCaprio was convincing in "What's Eating Gilbert 
Grape," but more often than not, even the most talented performers come 
across as mannered and unconvincing. Lewis and Ribisi, two generally 
impressive actors, are patently phony here (when Lewis asks Ribisi who 
invented sex, watch him recite his punchline while shamelessly aping 
Dustin Hoffman's "Rainman" delivery).
Their characters are painfully unrealistic Hollywood clich√©s, mentally-
challenged individuals presented as eternal children in adult bodies, who 
possess a naive wisdom and innate decency that makes them so very, very 
"special." One of the film's most irritating scenes shows the pair 
dressed up for a Halloween party in an absurd swan outfit and a ragged 
puppy suit. Virtually every mildly-retarded person I know wants to be 
viewed as an adult and not "special" or childlike. They have to work 
extremely hard to receive the same treatment the rest of us take as a 
given. Ask my son to put on a puppy suit and he'll tear your head off, 
chastising you for even suggesting he do something so babyish and 
undignified.
Had the folks behind "The Other Sister" done a little research, they 
might have noticed things like that. But, of course, that's a lot to 
expect from director and co-writer Garry Marshall, the amiable boob 
responsible for such TV perennials as "Happy Days," and cinematic gems 
like "Pretty Woman," "Dear God" and "Exit To Eden." Marshall is the king 
of glossy schlock and "The Other Sister" fits neatly into his sit-com 
oeuvre. Adept at grinding out handsomely photographed trifles filled with 
contrived moments calculated to get the crowd cheering, Marshall wouldn't 
know a genuine emotion if it came up and bit him. Actually, it's 
surprising that he wasted valuable time on a film like this when he could 
have been developing money-making projects more attuned to his skills, 
you know, something along the lines of "Laverne and Shirley: The Movie."

Susan Granger's review of "The Other Sister" (Disney's Touchstone Films)
"Pretty Woman" director Garry Marshall has struck gold, once
again, with this fresh, engaging, provocative story of a mentally
challenged young woman (Juliette Lewis) who returns from ten years of
confinement in a special school determined to lead an independent
life, much to the chagrin of her guilty, indulgent father (Tom
Skerritt) and smothering, over-protective mother (Diane Keaton). When
she falls in love with a similarly impaired man (Giovanni Ribisi) and
demands her own apartment, their concern turns to absolute panic, as
the story revolves around the parental dilemma of what to do when a
child with special needs becomes an adult.  Juliette Lewis is
magnificently vibrant and totally captivating as the defiantly spunky
woman whom her doctor describes as "pushing the edge of the envelope."
And Giovanni Ribisi is endearingly vulnerable as a man besotted by
marching bands, yet haunted by taunts of "retard." Having never dated
- with only the sketchiest knowledge of sex - their romance is
innocently awkward, painfully poignant, and hilariously funny. "I
wonder who thought up sex in the first place," she muses in one
cleverly comical scene. "I think it was Madonna," he answers, quite
seriously. As co-writer with Bob Brunner, Gary Marshall's sensitivity
is apparent, allowing the audience to enjoy and empathize with these
two young people who embark on a challenging journey of
self-discovery. The only weakness of the film lies with the cliche'd
writing of the parents' roles and the so-called "normal " sisters: one
engaged, the other a lesbian. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
"The Other Sister" is an exuberant, life-affirming 9. It's a charming,
delightful, bittersweet and most unusual love story.

1. The other sister is handicapped.
2. Handicapped people have feelings like ¬ënormal' human beings.
3. They need to love and be loved by others, as we all do.
4. They also ¬ëdo it' (have sex). This is a valid topic and shouldn't be
subject to taboo. Although the issues of contraception should have been
more clearly brought out in the movie. But I guess there's only so much
one can explore within the boundaries of dominating mothers, lesbian
sisters and retarded boyfriends.
5. Every one has their song, and marching band music can be a real turn
on.
6. This is a romantic comedy that will bring laughter and tears to your
eyes at the same time.
7. The main actors Juliette Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi are not
handicapped in real life, although their performance may convince you
otherwise.
8. This movie should be viewed by anyone who has an unexplained fear of
disabled people.
9. This movie has more depth to it than ¬ëPretty Woman'. Although I would
have loved to see Julia Roberts and Richard Gere play a retarded
prostitute and demented business man respectively.
