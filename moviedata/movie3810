     You know, there are occasionally some well-done idiotic movies.
NAKED GUN wasn't bad.  HOT SHOTS wasn't bad.  As long as you took them
for what they were.
     Not LOADED WEAPON.  This was just plain stupid, more in the line of
THE PERILS OF GWENDOLYN IN THE LAND OF THE WHATEVER IT WAS" [YIK-YAK.
-Moderator].  A weak, nay, gasping for breath plot.  Emilio Estevez
apparently was supposed to play some macho cop walking the edge.  All I
got was that he was suffering from a combination of food that didn't
agree with him, and a mega-wedgie.  His acting was wooden.
     I can't remember who played his partner, other than he was in
PATRIOT GAMES, but whoever he was, he was definitely slumming, and
definitely didn't fit the part.  [Samuel L. Jackson  -Moderator]
     The only redeeming virtue in the whole show was a brief view of
Kathy Ireland in some rather interesting attire.  Not that it made up
for the cost of the movie, but at least it wasn't a total disaster.
     LOADED WEAPON kind of reminds me of the "little movie that could."
I think that a parody of LETHAL WEAPON and other cop movies could be
done, and done well.  But for whatever reason, the makers of LOADED
WEAPON really dropped the ball on this one.
Rating:
     1 star (does the system go any lower?) out of 4.  Just
     plain pathetic.  A few sight gags garnered a couple
     chuckles, but it couldn't overcome stilted dialog,
     plain acting, and a pathetic script.
Enjoyability rating:
     Ah, here it does go lower.  Don't go see this movie.
     Don't even suggest it to your worst enemy.  Don't rent
     it when it comes out on video.  Boycott theatres that
     are showing it, don't even go to the other movies at
     the same complex.  Write letters to the editor
     denouncing this piece of movie tripe.

     "By-the-book" cop Samuel L. Jackson and "loose cannon" cop Emilio

interest Kathy Ireland.
     NATIONAL LAMPOON'S LOADED WEAPON 1 is a great film from the people
who brought us ANIMAL HOUSE, CLASS REUNION, CLASS OF '86, VACATION,
EUROPEAN VACATION, and CHRISTMAS VACATION.  LOADED WEAPON 1 is a
slapstick comedy film like the recent films HOT SHOTS! and NAKED GUN 2
1/2.  I feel that LOADED WEAPON 1 is as good as HOT SHOTS! but not up
to the level of NAKED GUN 2 1/2.  I recommend this film to fans of
slapstick comedy.  On a scale of zero to five, I give NATIONAL LAMPOON'S
LOADED WEAPON 1 a five.   LOADED WEAPON 1 is rated PG-13 for explicit
language, adult situations, adult humor, and violence.
     LOADED WEAPON 1 lampoons many recent films, the most obvious being
the LETHAL WEAPON series.  The most excellent I of these parodies I feel
were WAYNE'S WORLD and BASIC INSTINCT.
     For the most part the cast isn't overly memorable, but are great
fun to watch during the film.  The leads Samuel L.  Jackson (AMOS &
ANDREW), Emilio Estevez (MEN AT WORK, FREEJACK), and Jon Lovitz (MOM AND
DAD SAVE THE WORLD, A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN) do a great job impersonating
the people from the LETHAL WEAPON series.   Kathy Ireland (DANGER
ISLAND, NECESSARY ROUGHNESS, MR. DESTINY) is beautiful and has an
amusing character.  Tim Curry (CLUE, THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW)
makes a wonderful Wilderness Girl.  
     Like the recent film THE PLAYER, LOADED WEAPON 1 has many big name
stars in cameo roles.  The best cameo role I think was Richard Moll as a
jailer.  Charlie Sheen (HOTSHOTS!, CADENCE), Emilio Estevez's brother,
has a great cameo.  Lance Kinsey (the POLICE ACADEMY series) makes a
great moron cop.  Whoopi Goldberg (MADE IN AMERICA, THE PLAYER) does a
wonderful stiff.
     On the other hand, Phil Hartman ("Saturday Night Live," HOW I GOT
INTO COLLEGE) has the worst cameo in this film.  I didn't think that his
character was at all funny.  Corey Feldman (MEATBALLS 4, EDGE OF HONOR)
was wasted in this film because he can do a good job when given
material, but he wasn't given anything to do.
     LOADED WEAPON 1 is excellently written.  It kept me laughing
throughout the film.  If one joke misses you then another will come
along and catch you.  This film is also filled with hilarious sight
gags.

Starring:  Emilio Estevez, Samuel L. Jackson, Jon Lovitz, William Shatner, 
           Kathy Ireland
Director:  Gene Quintano
Producers:  Suzanne Todd and David Willis
Screenplay:  Don Holley and Gene Quintano
Music:  Robert Folk
Released by New Line Cinema
     Jack Colt (Emilio Estevez) is a burnt-out, alcoholic cop pining for
his lost dog.  Wes Luger (Samuel L. Jackson) is a straight-laced,
by-the-book officer days away from retirement.  When Luger's ex-partner
is killed, the two are brought together to investigate.  They soon
discover that the murder is only the tip of the iceberg.  The evil
General Mortars (William Shatner) is hatching a plot to begin massive
shipments of drugs via Wilderness Girl cookies.
     As expected, LOADED WEAPON 1 is pure spoof.  While its obvious
target is the LETHAL WEAPON series (with Estevez playing a Riggs-type,
Jackson playing a Murtaugh-type, and Lovitz doing a bad impression of
Joe Pesci), it sets a few other recent films in its sites as well,
including SILENCE OF THE  LAMBS, BASIC INSTINCT, and WAYNE'S WORLD.
There are cameos galore (by such notables as Whoopi Goldberg, Charlie
Sheen, Bruce Willis, James Doohan,  Dr. Joyce Brothers, and others),
and a seemingly endless supply of puns and sight gags.  Yet somehow the
movie never quite clicks.
     LOADED WEAPON 1 aspires to be a NAKED GUN, but Emilio Estevez has 
neither the screen presence nor the deadpan delivery of Leslie Nielsen.
Also, with the recent release of so many other films of this sort, the
luster is beginning to fade.  They're not as clever or quirky as they
once were.
     LOADED WEAPON 1 has its funny moments.  There isn't much subtlety
in the humor--it's up front and obvious.  There is a whole barrage of
jokes--several per scene.  Predictably, some work and others don't,
and while the film isn't a credit-to-credit barrel of laughs, you would
have to be made of stone not to at least chuckle once or twice.
     The cast is mostly unremarkable.  The most memorable performances
are turned in by the various cameos.  Bruce Willis' somewhat unexpected
appearance is perhaps the shining moment of the movie, although James
Doohan's brief scene is almost as good.  Of the "regulars", William
Shatner is especially disappointing  Given his propensity for
over-the-top acting, I expected a scenery-chewing romp.  Instead, what
he delivers is bland and of the "hand me the check so I can get out of
here" variety.  He's flat, boring, and completely wrong for the role.
     Basically, the film is unremarkable.  There's nothing new or
original in it, so there isn't any compelling reason to see it.  With
much better fare of this sort available on video (AIRPLANE, THE NAKED
GUN, etc.), renting a tape will be more satisfying, not to mention
cost-effective.  LOADED WEAPON 1 is good for a few laughs, but it's a
rather feeble feature-length film.

These days, people have rather short attention span and
hardly anything can satisfy them for the long run. 1970s
nostalgia is already wearing off, and now, people are
becoming more and more interested in 1980s. Few years in the
future, early 1990s are going to be regarded as next Golden
Age of nostalgia. However, I doubt that people are going to
be very nostalgic about the Hollywood products of that
period. One of the reason would surely be films like
NATIONAL LAMPOON'S LOADED WEAPON 1, that, in many ways,
symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary American film
industry - lack of originality and ideas.
Being made as some kind of parody on LETHAL WEAPON series,
this film pairs two L.A. policemen - Jack Colt (Emilio
Estevez), burn-out alcoholic cop on the edge, and Wes Luger
(Samuel L. Jackson), by-the-book policeman, days away from
retirement. Two of them, following the murder of Luger's ex-
partner, must confront evil General Mortars (William
Shatner), crime lord who is going to flood the market with
cocaine stashed in Wilderness Girl cookies.
The authors of this films (whose director, Gene Quintano,
worked on such projects like third and fourth sequel of
POLICE ACADEMY) lacked any original idea before they
undertook the projects, and that reflects in the lack plot,
characters, and, even original lines. The plot, or what goes
for the plot in this movie, is nothing more than a series of
gags that make laugh of some popular films made in previous
few years (apart from LETHAL WEAPON series, this film
"borrows" its female lead from BASIC INSTINCT). The best
gags, are, same as with many other similar movies, shown in
the trailers. The rest simply doesn't work. Only those who
used to watch a lot of Hollywood products in that period
would laugh. Others would probably wince at the lameness of
humour. Some would be entertained by celebrity cameos that
pop up every once in a while. But, at the end, spending hour
and half in front of this disorganised mess of a movie is
simply not worth the effort.
The film was sometimes criticised for being the parody of a
series that already had strong comic overtones. The authors
of LETHAL WEAPON returned the favour by using the LOADED
WEAPON 1 joke in their fourth sequel.
