Directed by James Wong. Screenplay by Glen Morgan, Wong and Jeffrey
Reddick, from a story by Reddick. Starring Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Kerr
Smith. Running time: 102 minutes. Rated R (MFCB). Reviewed on April 13th,
2000.
Since "Scream" revived the teenage horror genre, there hasn't been much
variation on its successful formula. Films like "I Know What You Did Last
Summer" and "Urban Legend" were largely direct knock-offs, lacking the
creative spark to try something different. Now comes the latest
youth-oriented thriller, "Final Destination", as usual sporting an
inexperienced cast culled from other recent movies and TV shows popular
with its target audience. But while the trappings of "Final Destination"
may seem familiar, it is not just another "Scream" wannabe -- its
screenplay is original, and more importantly does not speak down to its
audience. While by no means a movie for intellectuals, "Final  
Destination" is nonetheless possessed of an intelligence which I hope is
not lost on future scary movies.
As the film opens, a group of teenagers is boarding Flight 180 from JFK
Airport for a class trip to Paris. One student, Alex Browning (Devon 
Sawa), falls asleep before takeoff and has a dream in which the craft
explodes in midair, killing everyone on board. Convinced he has 
experienced a precognitive vision, Alex freaks out, trying to warn
everyone off the plane. He ends up fighting with jock Carter Hogan (Kerr
Smith, miles away from his character on "Dawson's Creek") and this results
in several of them being kicked off: Alex, Carter, Alex's best friend Tod
(Chad E Donella), Carter's girlfriend Terry (Amanda Detmer), nebbish
Billy (Seann William Scott), loner Clear (Ali Larter), and their teacher
Valerie Lewton (Kristen Cloke). Except for Clear, they all think Alex is
overreacting to a nightmare -- until moments later when, in a terrific
scene of building horror and anticipation, the plane does indeed blow up.
Alex is treated like a pariah thereafter. Some people (including the FBI)
believe he may be responsible for the explosion, while others just fear
him because they think he can see the future. But then, one by one, the
survivors of Flight 180 start to die under mysterious and highly 
improbable circumstances, and Alex keeps getting premonitions. He slowly
comes to believe that he and the others were not meant to survive the
explosion, and now Death is coming back to claim them. Having cheated
Death once, can he and the others do so again?
"Final Destination" is essentially composed of two types of scenes: scenes
where people die, and scenes where people talk about death. The former
might be, in a perverse way, the more enjoyable -- the movie boasts some
impressively elaborate ways of killing off its cast, some of them worthy
of Rube Goldman -- but it is the latter which sets "Final Destination"
apart. The script, by Glen Morgan and James Wong (of "The X-Files" fame)
and Jeffrey Reddick, does a good job of considering how death affects
people, and how young people in particular think about death. There's the
stereotypical attitude that teens think they're immortal, of course
(embodied in Carter), but also much discourse about fate and free choice.
What if the things we do today set in motion the events which will cause
our death years down the road? asks Alex. It is a question with deep
implications indeed.
But as much as "Final Destination" throws in touches of originality, in
too many ways it is also very predictable. The identities of those who die
and those who survive (or do they?) are not hard to guess, and as a
result the middle portion of the film is somewhat lacking in suspense. We
know people are going to die, we can pretty much guess who's going to die,
so we end up marking time until the next inventive death sequence. It's
not helped that almost every death is presaged by not just one but several
occurrences: gusts of chill wind, strange shadows, the strains of
"Rocky Mountain High" by the late John Denver ("He died in a plane crash,"
Alex notes early on). These touches added style to the killings the first
couple of times around, but by the end of the movie had been overused to
the point of farce.
The script is also hampered by a few gaps in logic. For example, after the
plane explosion, more than a month passes before any of the survivors is
killed, and then the deaths come in a rush. A similar stretch of time
passes later in the film. Did the Grim Reaper have to wait until his
calendar freed up? Also, we never learn why Alex has been gifted with
these visions, and while the answer to that question is not really
essential, I think some indication would not have been unwarranted. All
this said, "Final Destination" makes up for some of these imperfections by
eschewing the traditional Hollywood ending for something much darker and
more surprising -- albeit one that is really inevitable, in the context of
the movie. The writers deserve praise for sticking to their guns, instead
of tacking on a more palatable ending which would have only diminished the
picture as a whole.
The cast of "Final Destination" is generally solid, with Ali Larter
notable as the enigmatic Clear. Sawa spends a little too much time looking
wide-eyed and harried, but altogether does a good job in the lead role.
The direction, by co-writer Wong, is accomplished, developing the
atmosphere of paranoia without going overboard. Indeed, "Final
Destination" is a movie which is well aware of its more ludicrous
elements, and acknowledges them rather than trying to justify them --
witness a hilarious cameo by Tony Todd as a mortician, for instance.
"Final Destination" is not a great film, but as flawed as it is, it tries
valiantly to rise above the conventions of the thriller genre, to be more
than just another horror movie for teens. It doesn't just tell a story,
but tries to tell a story about something, and I can only hope that other
filmmakers follow its lead. "Final Destination" demonstrates that a movie
-- even a scary movie -- can have meaning, and still be fun.

"Live it up, Alex, you've got your whole life ahead of you," his father
prophetically advises.  Since James Wong's FINAL DESTINATION is a teen
horror movie, one immediately sees the humorous irony in this advice,
which occurs in the first few minutes of the story.
Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) and the rest of his French class are off to
France for the summer.  Using the horror genre's favorite weather, noisy
lightning, the movie sets the stage for what will be a disastrous plane
flight.
Filled with premonitions of catastrophe, Alex gets on board the
aircraft, only to see every mechanical part as a possible source of
failure.  After a daydream during passenger loading, he yells, "This
plane will explode on takeoff!"
Needless to say, this isn't something you want to go screaming on a
jumbo jet.  The crew does not take kindly to such outbursts and neither
do his fellow students.  The upshot of all of this is that the plane
leaves without Alex and 6 other would-be travelers to the land of Brie
and croissants.
Of course, the plane crashes in a massive fireball.  If you've ever been
afraid to fly, this isn't the movie for you.  Actually, if you are
currently okay with flying several miles up in the air in a long metal
tube, you still may want to avoid the film since its images may not go
away.  The rest of the story is a traditional teen horror flick with
severed heads and flying knives, but the plane crash is something else
entirely.  The director makes it seem entirely plausible and shockingly
realistic.
One problem that some viewers may have is that the details of the
tragedy sound remarkably similar to real-life plane crashes.  But, the
problem that most viewers will have with FINAL DESTINATION is that they
have seen it all before.  If you feel in the need for a generic teen
horror film, there is no reason to choose this one over any of the
others.
The body of the story has Alex trying to cheat death by outsmarting him.
Death, you see, doesn't like having had 7 of his intended victims
escape, so he's back on the prowl to collect them.
The movie is at its best when it goes more for humor than shock.  "I
will not let this plane crash be the most important thing in my life!"
the blonde bimbo survivor tells the others.  She doesn't need to worry.
It won't be.
FINAL DESTINATION runs 1:33.  It is rated R for violence, terror and
language and would be acceptable for older teenagers.

Susan Granger's review of "FINAL DESTINATION" (New Line Cinema)
  There's a difference between spooky and scary. Spooky refers
to things that are ghostly, weird and/or eerie, while scary involves
fright, panic and/or terror. Precognition can be both.  The story
begins as a jittery teenager (Devon Sawa) prepares to fly to Paris
with members of his Long Island high-school French class. Suddenly,
inexplicably, before the plane takes off, he has a premonition of
doom. Screaming that there will be a crash, he freaks out and is
escorted off the aircraft, along with six of his friends.  When the
plane does take off it, there is, indeed, an explosion. Why were these
seven survivors spared?  That's a question that gnaws not only at Sawa
and his cohorts but also at FBI agents who have been alerted to the
bizarre coincidence. So there are deep philosophical questions to be
answered, like: How does one escape from Death?  Can you ever cheat
fate?  Won't it catch up with you - one way or another?  Without
doubt, the first few minutes of the film are the best - after that,
well, this heavy-handed Death-as-a-slasher tale was made for a teenage
audience by James Wong and Glen Morgan, two TV veterans who wrote for
The X-Files, The Others and Millennium, along with Jeffrey
Reddick. They know how to eliminate characters in shocking, not to
mention unusual, circumstances. So prepare yourself for graphic gore,
black humor and some of the dumbest dialogue ever spoken. Trivia note:
several characters are named for horror favorites of the past, like
Chaney, Hitchcock, Todd Browning (Dracula), and Val Lewton (I Walked
With A Zombie). On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, Final
Destination is a grim, supernatural 4, packaged with a warning that
hearing John Denver sing "Rocky Mountain High" can be mysteriously
ominous.

Larter, Sean William Scott, and Brandon Fehr
 "I'm never going to die!" yells one character at a memorial for 39
fellow French-class students who died in a plane crash that, by all
rights, he should have died on too.  As incredibly laughable as this
line is, it provides the big flaw in the basic premise behind Final
DestinationÂ making a horror movie about people cheating death does not
have much potential.  Since you can't kill Death, destroy Death, or send
Death screaming back to its home planet, you have a no-win scenario in
front of you.  No matter what is said or done, everyone ends up getting
it.
 This is not to give you a spoiler and to say that everyone gets it in
the movie.  This is simply to point out the fact that no matter which
way they go, they're screwed.  Death is a no-win scenario.  If you're
going to make a movie about escaping death, make it a la Fearless, where
we focus on the human element.  But since it's a horror film the ball is
in the court of Director James Wong to provide us with something that
will keep us interested for an hour and forty minutes of inevitability.
 The film actually does a halfway-decent job of this, but only by going
so far pass the realm of the believable to enter into the land of the
ludicrous.  How so?  Well, virtually everyone who bites it in the movie
does so by the means of a Rube Goldberg contraption.
 Rube Goldberg, for those not familiar with his work, was drew comic
which often depicted a scientist trying to find the most complicated way
to do the most simple job.  A classic example of this is the machine in
which a cord is snapped, a mallet unlocks a cage, an anteater crawls out
from the cage and licks the ants on stamps, thus preparing said stamps
to be mailed.  Final Destination features several of Rube Goldberg's
guillotinesÂ forms of death that end up being so drawn out that, about
five minutes into the elaborate trap, you utter a groan and yell at the
movie to get on with it.
 The result is a movie that is only good for the target audience: the
young college student who is looking for an excuse to have his
girlfriend become utterly frightened and leap into his arms.  Do not
think in this filmÂ you'll find plot holes.  Do not pay attention to the
dialogue in this filmÂ you'll hate it.  Do not expect this film to be up
to par with half of the episodes of "The X-Files" that Wong has worked
onÂ you'll be severely disappointed.
 Final Destination is good for a horror film.  This means that the
acting is terrible, the script was probably written by monkeys, and
somehow you find yourself enjoying the film anyway.  So sit back, relax,
and watch itÂ but only if you like cheese.

While Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) waits at JFK to leave for a school trip to
Paris, bad omens seem to surround him.  As soon as he buckles into the plane,
he has a vision of the plane exploding seconds after take-off.  When the vision
begins to come true, Alex bolts for the door, dragging several students and a
teacher in his wake.  The plane takes off without them and explodes just as
Alex predicted.  He becomes an object of fear and suspicion among the
community, and the tension only increases as the survivors begin to die.  Alex
and another survivor, Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), investigate the suspicious
"suicide" of a friend, and a mortician (Tony "Candyman" Todd) clues them in to
the truth:  Alex interrupted Death's design by saving people who should have
died in the explosion, and Death will want to claim its rightful victims.  In
order to save himself and the others, Alex will have to figure out Death's new
plan and thwart it.
Of the countless horror films that have competed for a piece of the "Scream"
audience, "Final Destination" is the best so far.  Talented young screenwriter
Jeffrey Reddick offers a fresh variation on a familiar formula.  We've seen
hundreds of movies where a group of teenagers are murdered one-by-one by a
faceless slasher, but Reddick cuts out the hockey-masked middle-man and makes
the villain Death itself.  First-time feature director James Wong made the most
of that premise.  Every scene is permeated with creepiness and foreboding,
reminding us that Death is everywhere, can come at anytime.  Everyday objects
and events vibrate with menace.  The most amusing harbinger of doom:  John
Denver's "Rocky Mountain High," which is played several times in the movie
before someone dies.  (The link is that Denver died in a plane crash, and the
song includes a line about fire in the sky.)  
The performances are stronger than those usually elicited by teen horror. 
Devon Sawa, who previously starred in another horror flick, "Idle Hands," gives
a frantic and convincing lead performance.  Kerr Smith is Carter Hogan, an
antagonist of Alex's whose quick temper causes him to pulled off the fatal
plane.  Smith plays Carter as filled with anger and confusion that constantly
threatens to bubble over into violence.  Seann William Scott, who's also in
theaters right now in "Road Trip," plays the somewhat dim Billy Hitchcock and
provides a needed counterpoint to the intensity of Alex and Carter.  Tony
Todd's one-scene cameo is delicious but all too brief.  
Bottom line:  Watchable teen fright flicks are few and far between, but this
destination is worth visiting.

Final Destination (2000) by John Sylva    Rating: A
For this review and more, visit Clear Illusions (www.clearillusions.com)
The majority of scary movies signal the fact that a character is about to meet
their demise with cheesy music, worn out dialogue such as "I'll be right back,"
or simply with the overall tone of the scene.  How about a classic John Denver
song as a death signal for a change?  That's the kind of bursting originality
that allows "Final Destination" to invade the viewer's mind, even days after
seeing it, making one pause before ever entering a dark room, taking a shower,
or even going to sleep.  The unique and horrifying thriller is the best thing
to happen to the slasher genre since 1996's "Scream."  "Final Destination,"
directed by James Wong and penned by Jeffrey Riddick, Glen Morgan, and James
Wong, the latter two being writers for the T.V. series "The X-Files," is a
movie with wonderful ideas, and executes them effortlessly.  It's rare a film
of this nature can grab an audience's attention these days, as the genre has
seem to be completely worn outÃ¢Â`But "Final Destination" has more in store for
one than one can imagine.
Unlike "Halloween"'s Michael Myers or "Nightmare on Elm Street"'s Freddy
Kruger, "Final Destination"'s killer is of the supernatural, the dark one
himself, death.  The intriguing premise is as follows; A portion of a senior
class is set to travel by air to Paris for their class trip.  After boarding
the plane, one of the students, Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) dreams of their
plane exploding into flames just after takeoff, killing everyone on board. 
Once waking up, Alex gets himself and six others off of that plane, all of who
seem to be rather confused by the entire happening.  Shortly after their
departure, the plane takes off, and guess what; It blows up in middair.  Now,
Alex, and fellow survivors, who consist of friend Clear Waters (Ali Larter),
enemy Carter (Kerr Smith), Carter's girlfriend Terry (Amanda Detmer), the goofy
Billy (Sean William Scott) and his brother Tod (Chad Donella), and teacher, Ms.
Valerie Lewton (Kristen Cloke), are in extreme danger, as it seems they have
cheated death by getting off of that plane, and now death wants them.  The
number of survivors starts to peel back quite quickly as death goes around
offing those who got off the planeÃ¢Â`But who is next, and how will death get
them?
"Final Destination" is a film that is unbearably suspenseful; always making the
viewer frantic, as death will strike in the most unlikely of times.  John
Denver's "Rocky Mountain High" being played pretty much warrants another
deathÃ¢Â`Everyone on that plane learned the hard way.  Although it's usually
given whose life will be taken next, the intensity and unpredictability of the
film never fades, because you don't know when death is coming.  Like the
characters in the movie, I was constantly nervous and shaky during "Final
Destination".  The slightest noise or movement nearby would send me a mile into
the airÃ¢Â` And yes, the film is that intense.
The cast is surprisingly effective and up to par; the best ensemble in this
genre since "Scream."  The characters have multi-dimensional personalities for
a change, and for the most part, you highly sympathize with them once death
starts to come their way.  Devon Sawa and Ali Larter are the main focus of the
film, and both actors follow up their well written characters with even better
performances, that, like the "Scream" movies did for their cast, will launch
them into superstardom.  Kerr Smith and Kristen Cloke are also impressive,
although the two don't posses as much screen time as the leads.
"Final Destination" is one exhilarating, exciting ride.  Any age should be able
to enjoy the complexity and eeriness of the film, and should find an edge to it
that most slasher films lack.  For the blood loving moviegoer, "Destination"
contains buckets of blood, guts, and all that good stuff.  "Final Destination"
is a film that is destined to become a cult classic among horror fans, and a
sleeper hit at the box office.  Hands down to the first film in years that has
actually scared me.  By scare, I don't mean making me jump, or making me wonder
if I'm in danger, but by scare I mean a film that stays locked in your mind,
absorbing you, leaving one question that's constantly on your mind:  Is death
coming for me? 
The Bottom Line: Make "Final Destination" your destination.

Have you ever wondered if death is something that simply happens naturally, 
at any given moment, in life? Or if it is an occurrence that is predetermined 
by some much larger force within the world, or outside of it? These 
thought-provoking questions are the subject of "Final Destination," which is 
the most riveting horror-drama since 1999's "The Sixth Sense." Stylishly 
filmed and tautly directed by "X-Files" alum James Wong, the film deals with 
several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage 
characters (in accurately written "teen-speak," rather than overwrought, 
highly intellectualized dialogue that even Harvard scholars wouldn't use), 
all the while developing into a darkly foreboding, severely eerie thriller 
that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real opening twenty 
minutes to the less-successful, but still suspenseful epilogue.
At the start of the film, 17-year-old high school senior Alex Browning (Devon 
Sawa) is about to leave with his 40-student French class for a field trip to 
Paris. Progressively getting a case of preflight jitters, he spots several 
mysterious "coincidences," including the departure time being 9:25, the same 
as his September 25 birthday, as well as hearing the John Denver song "Rocky 
Mountain High" over the sound system in the airport bathroom. "John Denver 
died in a plane crash," Alex grudgingly mutters to himself. Once seated, Alex 
suddenly gets a horrific premonition about the plane exploding upon takeoff, 
and after causing a ruckus onboard, he, as well as six other students and a 
teacher, are thrown off. Arguing in the airport lobby, Alex's suspicion comes 
true when the plane really does explode in flight, killing all 300+ 
passengers, including the rest of their classmates.
As two investigators interrogate Alex about how he knew the plane was going 
to explode, the fellow survivors, whom he has saved, treat him in varying 
manners. Carter (Kerr Smith), the hotshot jock, holds him in contempt because 
he believes that it is only he himself who can decide his fate. Alex's best 
friend, Tod (Chad E. Donella), wants to stand by him but can't because of his 
fearful parents. The teacher, Mrs. Lewton (Kristen Cloke), is frightened by 
him, believing that it was he who somehow caused the disaster, as well as in 
a state of guilt for giving up her seat on the plane to a fellow coworker. 
Only outsider Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), who unboarded the plane due to a 
sudden connection to Alex's premonition even though she had never even spoken 
to him before, is sympathetic and thankful to him for saving her life.
That is only the setup of "Final Destination," and the less said about what 
follows, the better. Suffice to say, the film does, indeed, turn into a 
slasher film, albeit one that is more thoughtful than most, and replaces a 
knife-wielding maniac for the never-seen granddaddy killer of them all, the 
Grim Reaper itself.
The setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes, and "Final 
Destination" surely boosts some of the most inventive ones to grace the 
silver screen in years. Graphic and brilliantly orchestrated in a Rube 
Goldbergesque manner, they manage to occasionally be so intense you don't 
know whether to shrink down in your seat, tap your feet in nervousness, or 
turn away. 
Devon Sawa, a rising star who put his physical comedy skills to good use in 
1999's underseen slasher-comedy, "Idle Hands," is even more of a charismatic 
presence here. The conflicting emotions he feels for his survival, which he 
comes to believe he wasn't meant to do, as well as the loss of the other 
passengers, is superbly and subtly acted on his part. One scene, in which he 
is watching a news report on the crash and slowly begins to break down is 
especially realistic and powerful. 
Ali Larter (1999's "Varsity Blues"), in the other central role, is also 
effective, as a girl whose life was going well until her father died in a 
convenience store shooting years before, leaving her stuck with an 
increasingly uncaring mother who married a loutish man--the exact opposite of 
her now-deceased father.
The other roles are not as fully written, and most remain rather 
one-dimensional. The movie is mainly Sawa's, however, and the rest of the 
actors equip themselves well in limited roles. Tony Todd (1992's "Candyman"), 
as an arcane morgue attendant, pops up for a five-minute cameo, but his 
appearance is rather supererogatory. And the aforementioned dialogue 
occasionally hits the bullseye, while at other times it hovers over being 
just a little too stilted and campy.
Ultimately, what is so good about "Final Destination" is that, within the 
confines of the slasher genre, writer-director Wong and screenwriters Glen 
Morgan and Jeffrey Reddick have created a premise that has never been seen 
before in this manner, and a film that has the ability to both surprise and 
frighten--two things that are rarely found in today's horror films. If 
anything, it's safe to say you will never ever look at flying in airplanes 
the same way again.

Starring Devon Sawa, Kristen Cloke, Amanda Detmer, Chad Donella,
Brendan Fehr, Seann William Scott. Directed by James Wong. Rated R.
Final Destination, the latest from the teen horror genre, gets off to a
strong start and plummets downhill from there. It was written and
directed by X-Files veterans, but they choose to abandon what they do
best and pander to the lowest-common-denominator audience. By the time
the action reached its climax and all hell broke loose, I felt like I
was watching a group of obviously talented writers defeated by the
system. I've read that the original draft actually had the Grim Reaper
chasing the characters with his scythe. Perhaps that would have been a
bit more original -- not to mention funnier.
The movie starts off with a creepy titles sequence that has something
to do with fans and then cuts to Alex (Devon Sawa), a high school
student getting ready for his senior trip to France. He's a slightly
superstitious kid and he's been having bad feelings about this trip for
a while now. Creepy omens, premonitions, things like that. This
doomsday state peaks when Alex actually gets on the plane. As he
settles in his seat, he sees a disaster happen; first the plane shakes,
then it explodes. He panics, causing himself, 5 other students and a
teacher to be kicked off the aircraft. Minutes later, as the flight
takes off, they hear a crash and the airport window breaks violently.
The plane exploded and killed all onboard.
Understandably, this elicits tumultuous feelings from the 7 people who
got off the doomed flight 180. Most consider Alex to be a spook,
considering the unnerving way in which he predicted the disaster. The
FBI suspects him. The teacher he presumably saved reviles him. But then
things take a turn for the weird. The 7 people that lived start dying,
one by one. It seems that Alex's premonition wasn't part of Death's
plan and Death still wants them. But there is no Grim Reaper here;
Death comes in the form of bizarre accidents and coincidences.
There are some effectively creepy scenes in Final Destination's first
half hour. The plane sequence manages to evoke some actual jumps and
the first death is genuinely scary because it's not as overblown as
most of the ones that come later. Of course people will be talking
about the "bus scene," on which I won't elaborate beyond saying that it
evoked memories of a certain scene in Meet Joe Black.
Unfortunately, the movie can't keep it up. Once we pass the halfway
point, Final Destination starts to get more ludicrous, more standard-
issue with every minute of its running time. The climax is absurdly
self-important, with a lot of explosions, fire, et al. There is not a
touch of awareness that this has all been done before -- and better.
And the movie doesn't even have the guts to resist inserting that
obligatory final scare that we've all come to expect from horror
movies. It's always passed off as a big surprise, but is it that
surprising if it's present in nearly every film of the genre?
The performances are mostly unremarkable. Devon Sawa is merely ok as
the hero and Kristen Cloke is irritatingly snobbish as the teacher who
turns against Alex (it's almost fun to watch her get her comeuppance,
even though that probably wasn't the intention). Only Amanda Detmer, as
Alex's newfound buddy, gives a performance quirky enough to be unique.
Can these frighteningly good-looking teenagers cheat death and come out
alive? It's a plot brimming with potential but dependent on good
execution. Final Destination relies too much on mayhem and too little
on suspense to be an effective thriller, teen or otherwise. Someone's
going to get fired for this. I can feel it.

     After enduring FINAL DESTINATION, I have a renewed appreciation for
David Duchovny. I've always found his work on "The X-Files" to be plenty
entertaining, but I never realized how integral his performance as Fox
"Spooky" Mulder was to the success of the show. Duchovny has one of the
most thankless jobs on television: He spends a fair portion of every
single episode spitting out ridiculous speculative exposition. Mulder's
leaps of logic make him the Bob Beamon of investigative analysis; it is
only because Duchovny plays his dialogue with a strange combination of
confidence and deadpan resignation that you don't want to throw something
at the screen every time Mulder zigs from the Point A of "victim with cut
throat" to the Point Z of "werewolf on the prowl."
     Glen Morgan and James Wong have been part of the "X-Files" creative
team since day one, and have been key players in some of the series' best
episodes (including "Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man"). They've teamed
up for another wild supernatural premise in FINAL DESTINATION, but instead
of David Duchovny they have ... Devon Sawa. Sawa plays Alex Browning, a
high school senior looking forward to a class trip to Paris. While sitting
in the plane waiting to take off, however, he has a powerful premonition
of a mid-air disaster. Alex and several classmates are forced to leave the
plane in the ensuing panic-induced disruption, and consequently become the
only survivors when the disaster does come to pass. They all face a
mixture of relief and survivor guilt, but Alex has an even stranger
reaction. After one of the survivors meets a strange demise, he becomes
convinced that they were all meant to die on that plane, and that Death
itself may be stalking those who cheated it.
     Exactly how Alex becomes convinced is a huge part of the problem. 
Essentially, Alex accepts the rantings of a creepy mortician (erstwhile
Candyman Tony Todd) after he and fellow survivor/pseudo romantic interest
Clear (Ali Larter) break into a funeral home. The mortician expounds at
length on how Death might take exception to having its victims slip
through its fingers, and Alex instantly begins formulating a survival
strategy based on these wild speculations. Characters like the mortician 
are commonplace in supernatural horror films -- the protagonist has to
have some expert from whom to learn the rules of the strange game he finds
himself playing -- but this particular character is a ridiculous
contrivance. Alex finds an expert on Death's psyche just when he needs
one, never questioning for a second the credentials of an undertaker for
knowing the behaviors that get Death miffed.
     It doesn't help that Sawa doesn't exactly act the heck out of the
part. An earlier incarnation of the story by Jeffrey Reddick featured
adults as the survivors, before New Line, Wong and Morgan turned it into
an adolescent-centered shocker. The performers are generally functional at
best -- Chad E. Donella, himself an "X-Files" veteran as this season's
tormented brain-sucker, is a notable exception -- but it's the tragic
combination of Sawa and the script that sinks the film. The rules Alex
intuits for Death's modus operandi -- taking the survivors in the order
they were meant to die in the plane crash, skipping victims when someone
intervenes, etc. -- are convoluted at best. With Sawa dispensing those
rules to the audience, they're laughable. A more seasoned actor might have
made something of Alex's ever-more-obsessive interest in figuring out the
workings of fate. Sawa fumbles and flounders, lacking the least shred of
what Duchovny brings to similarly exaggerated material.
     Critics and viewers have learned not to expect much from horror films
heavy on teen cast members, even those with potentially promising 
pedigrees (e.g. the work of another "X-Files" alum, David Nutter's
DISTURBING BEHAVIOR). Still, you want to believe that talented people can
take a unique premise and give it a jolt of creativity. Wong brings
plenty of visual style to the table, and long-time writing partners Wong
and Morgan have fun nodding to their thriller forebears (characters named
after Hitchcock, Browning, Val Lewton and even their "X-Files" boss Chris
Carter) and selecting John Denver's "Rocky Mountain High" as the harbinger
of the Grim Reaper. They're just missing one crucial piece: a lead actor
who knows how to play the patently absurd with a wink and a shiver. FINAL
DESTINATION is left to play around with Rube Goldberg deathtraps, fatally
bereft of anyone who can take the silly and make it Spooky.

Have you ever wondered if death is something that simply happens naturally, 
at any given moment, in life? Or if it is an occurrence that is predetermined 
by some much larger force within the world, or outside of it? These 
thought-provoking questions are the subject of "Final Destination," which is 
the most riveting horror-drama since 1999's "The Sixth Sense." Stylishly 
filmed and tautly directed by "X-Files" alum James Wong, the film deals with 
several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage 
characters (in accurately written "teen-speak," rather than overwrought, 
highly intellectualized dialogue that even Harvard scholars wouldn't use), 
all the while developing into a darkly foreboding, severely eerie thriller 
that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real opening twenty 
minutes to the less-successful, but still suspenseful epilogue.
At the start of the film, 17-year-old high school senior Alex Browning (Devon 
Sawa) is about to leave with his 40-student French class for a field trip to 
Paris. Progressively getting a case of preflight jitters, he spots several 
mysterious "coincidences," including the departure time being 9:25, the same 
as his September 25 birthday, as well as hearing the John Denver song "Rocky 
Mountain High" over the sound system in the airport bathroom. "John Denver 
died in a plane crash," Alex grudgingly mutters to himself. Once seated, Alex 
suddenly gets a horrific premonition about the plane exploding upon takeoff, 
and after causing a ruckus onboard, he, as well as six other students and a 
teacher, are thrown off. Arguing in the airport lobby, Alex's suspicion comes 
true when the plane really does explode in flight, killing all 300+ 
passengers, including the rest of their classmates.
As two investigators interrogate Alex about how he knew the plane was going 
to explode, the fellow survivors, whom he has saved, treat him in varying 
manners. Carter (Kerr Smith), the hotshot jock, holds him in contempt because 
he believes that it is only he himself who can decide his fate. Alex's best 
friend, Tod (Chad E. Donella), wants to stand by him but can't because of his 
fearful parents. The teacher, Mrs. Lewton (Kristen Cloke), is frightened by 
him, believing that it was he who somehow caused the disaster, as well as in 
a state of guilt for giving up her seat on the plane to a fellow coworker. 
Only outsider Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), who unboarded the plane due to a 
sudden connection to Alex's premonition even though she had never even spoken 
to him before, is sympathetic and thankful to him for saving her life.
That is only the setup of "Final Destination," and the less said about what 
follows, the better. Suffice to say, the film does, indeed, turn into a 
slasher film, albeit one that is more thoughtful than most, and replaces a 
knife-wielding maniac for the never-seen granddaddy killer of them all, the 
Grim Reaper itself.
The setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes, and "Final 
Destination" surely boosts some of the most inventive ones to grace the 
silver screen in years. Graphic and brilliantly orchestrated in a Rube 
Goldbergesque manner, they manage to occasionally be so intense you don't 
know whether to shrink down in your seat, tap your feet in nervousness, or 
turn away. 
Devon Sawa, a rising star who put his physical comedy skills to good use in 
1999's underseen slasher-comedy, "Idle Hands," is even more of a charismatic 
presence here. The conflicting emotions he feels for his survival, which he 
comes to believe he wasn't meant to do, as well as the loss of the other 
passengers, is superbly and subtly acted on his part. One scene, in which he 
is watching a news report on the crash and slowly begins to break down is 
especially realistic and powerful. 
Ali Larter (1999's "Varsity Blues"), in the other central role, is also 
effective, as a girl whose life was going well until her father died in a 
convenience store shooting years before, leaving her stuck with an 
increasingly uncaring mother who married a loutish man--the exact opposite of 
her now-deceased father.
The other roles are not as fully written, and most remain rather 
one-dimensional. The movie is mainly Sawa's, however, and the rest of the 
actors equip themselves well in limited roles. Tony Todd (1992's "Candyman"), 
as an arcane morgue attendant, pops up for a five-minute cameo, but his 
appearance is rather supererogatory. And the aforementioned dialogue 
occasionally hits the bullseye, while at other times it hovers over being 
just a little too stilted and campy.
Ultimately, what is so good about "Final Destination" is that, within the 
confines of the slasher genre, writer-director Wong and screenwriters Glen 
Morgan and Jeffrey Reddick have created a premise that has never been seen 
before in this manner, and a film that has the ability to both surprise and 
frighten--two things that are rarely found in today's horror films. If 
anything, it's safe to say you will never ever look at flying in airplanes 
the same way again.

Chad E. Donnella, Seann William Scott and Amanda Detmer
Director-James Wong
Canadian Rating-18A
Released by New Line Cinema - 03/00
The premise of the new teen-targeted horror film `Final Destination'
causes a recollection of a memorable `Simpsons' Halloween episode. After
attempting to repair a malfunctioning toaster, lovably ignorant
patriarch Homer realizes he has created a portable time-machine. After a
trek into the Cretaceous period, Homer observes that any minor
alteration made there will erupt into a starling chain of events and
seriously modify the present world. Again and again, Homer toys with the
master plan and pays dearly for it. The characters of `Final
Destination' have also tampered with the blueprint schematics of their
existence - their `design'. Someone is after them with the strict intent
of correcting the mistake. That someone is Death.
You see, Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) and six others have cheated the Grim
Reaper.... but the dude has got some tricks up his sleeve. For a high
school excursion, Alex's French class is traveling to Paris by airline
transport. Alex, tense and neurotic, has a shocking premonition after
boarding: he sees the plane, and every passenger on it, spontaneously
explode in mid-air. In a panic of sheer lunacy, Alex charges his way
through the aisle and demands removal from the aircraft. After a handful
of others (including one teacher) follow and are denied admittance back
onto the plane, the unwitting Âsurvivors' watch in horror as the plane
actually explodes in the drizzling night sky. The loony vision Alex
experiences does actually materialize.  But Death won't be cheated so
easily, and one by one, the survivors of Flight 180 are offed in
mysteriously gruesome circumstances. The grisly murder count baffles the
local officials and FBI. Before I delve into the meat of the review, I'd
just like to confer.... is that one helluva premise, or what?
`Final Destination', creepy beyond rational comprehension, probably
reads more like an unsettling `X-Files' episode than `The Simpsons' -
therefore, the surprise is minimal when you discover the mutual creators
behind both are Glen Morgan and James Wong. On familiar turf, the task
of establishing footing is not difficult for Morgan and Wong, and the
opening 20 minutes of `Final Destination' reflects that. Unlike most
thrillers, the set-up is crisp and cool. You just deeply, sincerely hope
that the momentum won't unspool, leaving us with a second-string effort
with nothing but cheap, derivative shocks. Young viewers have a palpable
reason to expect this kind of formula deterioration, what with `I Know
What You Did Last Summer' and sequel, `Idle Hands' and -- a movie with a
nifty premise that just plunged like an anvil -- `Urban Legend'. After
the set-up, when I remained slouched apprehensively in my chair, I
started to really have fun with `Final Destination'. Low and behold, a
teen thriller that is actually unsettling, actually suspenseful and --
yes -- actually intelligent. Some splotty logic and a heap of
characteristic genre flaws aside, this film is among the most refreshing
and all-out enjoyable horror movies to submerge since the cutting-edge
`Scream' in 1996. `Final Destination' stimulates the nerves and offers a
exhilarating retaliation strike against all the blood-spattered slasher
crap we've endured throughout the past few years.
Not that the characters are that good. Sawa is game as Alex, a
connect-the-dots personality that we never fully comprehend. In
addition, the survivors are endearing geek Tod (Chad E. Donella), jocky
control-freak Carter (Kerr Smith of `Dawson's Creek'), Carter's ditzy
girlfriend Terry (Amanda Detmer), the none-too-subtly named Billy
Hitchcock (Seann William Scott, supplier of lukewarm comic relief) and a
lone teacher - the emotionally delicate Ms. Lewton (Kristin Cloke).
Aside from Alex, the primary center of interest is intended to be Ali
Larter (`Varsity Blues'), playing an abstract character named Clear
Rivers (what were her parents thinking?!?). The personality of Clear is
written with such a vague, nebulous definition that she resembles a
walking flash-card saying `Hello, I am the offbeat character designed to
identify with the main character's plight!' Toss a few stereotypical FBI
agents (Daniel Roebuck and Roger Guenveur Smith) and a....ummm...
`spiritual' mortician (former `Candyman' Tony Todd) into the mix, and
you have what could be another generic teenage frightfest with slicing,
dicing and assorted disembowelments.
Not so. `Final Destination' has no slicing and dicing, or at least none
dealt by a human killer, and the thought of Death itself as the unseen
stalker is unique and frightening. The extra dimension of disconcerting
irony rejuvenates the decaying Âmurderer-on-the-loose' concept, with
assistance from a shrewd, intelligently paced screenplay by Morgan, Wong
and Jeffrey Reddick. The plot twists are fun and clever without toppling
into utter absurdity (listen up, `Reindeer Games'). But I suppose the
most satisfying aspect of `Final Destination' is the murder scenes.
Creative, resourceful and breathlessly inventive, the death sequences
involve an unlikely string of events leading to a character's demise.
What will trigger the accident? Will it be the John Denver record, just
put on to play `Rocky Mountain High'? (yeah, sick humor). Will it be the
leaking toilet? The falling fishing reel in the corner? The murders are
startling and largely unforeseen, including one surprise incident that
made the audience jump out of their seats and giggle nervously for
roughly a minute afterward. A sense of giddy unpredictability is added
with this inventive approach. It gets sorta tasteless and cheap
sometimes, but who cares? It's fun.
In that simple regard, `Final Destination' is my cup of tea. This
stylishly executed thriller, although tagged with laughable
circumstances and the occasional snippet of lame dialogue, is an
immensely entertaining jaunt to the dark side. After the show, it will
also have an frightening impact on you. When will your Âdesign' expire?
Is Death waiting around the corner? The `Final' effect is a major case
of the heebie-jeebies.

                These days, if you see a bunch of teens on the screen
you can bet they're on their way to either a) the bedroom, b) the prom,
or c) an early grave. The luckless bunch in "Final Destination" turns
out to be on the express train to Heaven, but the movie is so absurd the
audience may feel trapped on the highway to Hell.
       The best that can be said of "Destination" is it starts
off with an intriguing idea, which should remind some viewers of the
1996 TWA Flight 800 tragedy. High school senior Alex (Devon Sawa) is
about to embark on a flight to Paris with his fellow students when he
suddenly has a terrifying premonition and becomes convinced the plane
will explode. When Alex freaks out, he's removed from the aircraft,
along with several others, including the obnoxious bully Carter (Kerr
Smith) and the cryptic Clear (Ali Larter), a loner who doesn't seem to
be able to afford any shirts long enough to cover her belly-button.
       Within minutes after takeoff, the plane does in fact blow
up, which arouses the suspicions of the FBI and almost instantly makes
Alex about as popular in his community as poor Cassandra was in ancient
Troy. Only Clear seems sympathetic to this reluctant soothsayer and even
she bristles a bit when Alex begins insisting the worst is not over for
this handful of survivors.
       Up to this point, director James Wong has cobbled
together a passably cheesy chiller. But once Alex's cohorts start to die
off suddenly (due to such odd phenomena as unexplained surges of toilet
water and semis that manage to move silently through downtown streets),
"Destination" goes into an irreversible tailspin. As the screenplay
becomes progressively sillier, Wong tries to compensate by piling on the
gore -- it's not enough here for someone to merely get their throat
slashed if there's also a way to have them set on fire and impaled with
multiple steak knives.
      What's behind it all? Evil spirits? The ghost of a
disgruntled classmate? Satan? Since the screenwriters are too lazy to
think up an answer, they have Alex simply attribute all the mayhem to
"Death."
      Give Death some credit, though. Instead of simply
inflicting these kids with fatal aneurysms or sudden strokes, Death goes
all out to give each of its victims a splashy going-away party. When it
appears check-out time is near for Clear, Death sends lightning bolts
out of a cloudless sky, has a downed power cable shower her house with
sparks, finds a way to crack open her above-ground swimming pool and
even takes the time to blow up her car.
     One of Alex's teachers is identified as Val Lewton, which
may or may not be a nod to the great director of such horror classics as
"Cat People," "Isle of the Dead" and "The Leopard Man." What Lewton
understood -- and what Wong and company miss completely -- was that
often we're more frightened by what we don't see than what we do. So
even though "Final Destination" refuses to spare us a single bloody
detail, it's a whole lot less chilling than it was meant to be. James

    Another teen horror flick in the wake of "Scream 3" written by the guys
who put the creepy in the X-Files. Sounds like a wild ride or is it? The
story centers around a group of teens who survive an airliner explosion
through a bizarre incident. After the crash, one teen (Devon Sawa) becomes
completely convinced that the Grim Reaper is after him and he is hunting the
group in the way they should have died in the explosion.
Producer, co-screenwriter, and director James Wong re-teams with his
partner Glen Morgan for a stab at the silver screen. Morgan and Wong's
greatest exploit has to have been the couple seasons of the X-Files where it
became the staple for TV suspense and to this day the series is still trying
to recapture. They have continue to dabble in TV with such series as the
little seen but at times brilliant "Space: Above and Beyond" and NBC's
recent hit "The Others". But with the debut of "Final Destination it's the
team's first real venture onto the silver screen.
Destination starts off with a great opening 20 minutes where we are
shocked and dumbfounded by the opening plot. I haven't seen that thrilling
of a plane disaster scene since 1993's "Alive". Wow, what a scene. And as
the film moves along a lot of the scenes are shocking and keep you on your
toes. But it's the latter half of the film that bugged me. The time I am
talking about is just when ex-Hollywood sex symbol Ali Larter's hair starts
to get blonder. Ever notice that in Hollywood films they always dumb down
the leading lady until she is supposed to catch the hero's eye? It's at that
point that Sawa's avoidance of the Grim Reaper get really hokey. That cabin
scene is a perfect example. Every movie like this needs a supernatural
ending and the finale here is gimmickry and unrealistic. If you love the
humor-horror trilogy of "Scream" like so many million people then
Destination has all that to offer but watch out for a couple goofy things
along the way.  I guess other "Scream" clone "I Know What You Did this
Summer" and especially its sequel got this back lash too.
The young people out there will love this, I am sure. (3 of 5) So Says
the Soothsayer.

   By being extra careful--eating right, exercising, moderating 
drinking and avoiding tobacco--we might cheat death for a
while.  In the end the grim reaper gets us.  How would you
feel, though, if you run into a person who could tell you more
or less when you're going to die?  This is the fascinating
concept behind first-time helmer James Wong's supernatural
thriller, "Final Destination," a teen-centered picture that
stands out from the "Scream" pack by avoiding slashers,
threats of slashers, and psychos, and yet keeps us on the
edge of our seats almost throughout.  The script is not what
rivets us: the screenplay was written by a committee.  But
Wong's graphic Rube Goldberg scenes are captivating to a
fault.  Characters die by some version of that great
cartoonist's notion of falling dominoes.  Example: A bowling
ball might roll down a ramp, dislodge a rock, which in turn fall
onto your toe which causes you to jump, hit your head on an
electric wire which breaks, fall into a puddle in which you land
and become electrocuted.  The schemes that Wong uses to
dispatch these mostly attractive characters are not only
ingenious: they provide some of the comic tongue-in-cheek
moments that are part and parcel of the genre.
   Photographed by Robert McLachlan in lovely Victoria, B.C.
to stand in for suburban areas of New York State and for
Paris, "Final Destination" centers on handsome Devon Sawa
("Idle Hands") in the role of Alex, an entirely healthy-looking
high school kid who has joined others in his French class for
a 10-day field trip to Paris.  Though the youngsters don't
carry guns, they could pass for high-school kids anywhere in
the country--making out in the airport lounge, shoving each
other playfully and not so playfully, freely using four-letter
words.  Just before takeoff from JFK, Alex has a graphic
premonition that the aircraft will explode upon takeoff, giving
director Wong the privilege off creating perhaps the scariest,
most trenchant look at an airline disaster from the point of
view of the passengers ever filmed.  Those who do not get
sucked out of the plane are slammed around the cabin and
eventually fried by a great ball of fire.  
   Alex creates a panicked disturbance to the dismay of his
classmates--who are looking forward to landing at DeGaulle
in seven hours--but a handful of his pals and one teacher join
him in bolting onto land.  Minutes later, the kids witness a
huge explosion that shatters the large windows of the lounge,
and from that point develop mixed feelings about Alex.  On
the one hand they are grateful for being saved.  On the other
they wonder whether simply being around this guy will mark
them for death--and no wonder.  Alex realizes that Death will
not tolerate being cheated and is going to go after these
people with a vengeance.  Alex illuminates a scheme by
which one survivor after another will soon die and to boot, he
knows the exact order of each person's demise.
   While the one hundred minutes of this movie seem to go
by like a shot, few films of this genre can match the delirium
of the initial twenty minutes as Wong takes us from the
comfortable home of Alex and his folks into the quick dream
sequence.  He follows up with a rousing eruption that insures
that "Final Destination" had better draw good box office its
first weekend because you'll never see this on in-flight motion
pictures.  Guaranteed.
   Some minor flaws challenge credibility.  Why does the
engineer not stop his train after he crashes into an
automobile on the tracks, totaling the car and presumably
killing its passengers?  And where are all these well-to-do
caring parents at take-off time?  Not one drives the young
people to JFK or hangs around to see the happy bunch off. 
The teens are a stereotypical bunch, all alike in some
respects but each representing a standard character trait.  Ali
Carter as Clear Rivers is the strong, intelligent type who
stands by her man and has faith in his ability to predict the
near future, while Kerr Smith in the role of Carter Horton is
the handsome but malicious kid who thinks he controls his
own destiny--that he will never die.  Wong has Daniel
Roebuck and Roger Guenveur Smith play the obligatory FBI
agents with some humor. When Agent Schreck Wiene
complains to his partner that "this kid gives me the creeps,"
Agent Roebuck counters, "Don't take this the wrong way, but
sometimes you give me the creeps."
   With "Final Destination" a more-or-less standard narrative
with the usual suspects in the role of teens, their teachers
and parents, and the officers watching them, turns into a
vibrant film pervaded with ingenious death-inducing devices,
an uncompromisingly vivid recreation of an air disaster taken
within the cabin and followed up smartly with a shattering
discharge, and an appropriate combination of somber
discussions and a lightly mocking mood.

Teen slasher has been noticeable these days. We've had films such as "Scream"
and its 3 sequels, "I know what you did last summer" and its far inferior
"sequel", "Urban Legend" and its sequel. What brought out these teen slashers
is the fact that they are sadly all hits. Even though I liked some of the
films, I did get tired of seeing teens running around getting slashes up, its
been done before and nothing is original. Well nothing could have gotten me
ready for a terrifying film, that I first saw a preview for on "Next Friday".
The trailer truly scared me, and made the film look great, but I knew it would
be just another teen slasher movie. Well I was wrong, you never see the killer
and the film never drops into that teen slasher feel.
The film starts out with a terrifyingly real plane crash, where a group of
students are getting ready to go to France. Aboard the plane Alex Browning
(Devon Sawa) has a dream/vision of the plane crashing in a realistic way.
Everything that happened prior in his dream, happens when he wakes up, and he
goes crazy, getting him and five of his friends kicked off the flight, and one
teacher. When he is back into the lobby he explains what happened in his dream,
to which no one believes, until the plane explodes, and all the students die. A
few months later, Â weird things are starting to happen, his friends are
starting to die by someone....something, Alex along with his friends has try
and figure out what is doing this, before it gets them, and he must remember,
he cheated death so death is after him.
The film is directed by James Wong and is fantastic. The thing that I found
best about the movie was the fact that you never saw who was killing these
people, most of which occured on accident in very very inventive ways. Some
brilliant ideas really flow throughout this movie, and I found myself stunned
in my seat about how far it strayed from being a teen slasher film, this is a
real mature adult movie only with a teen cast. The cast is a far cry from being
like others where the performances are wooden, this is a cast that is
definately talented.
Devon Sawa clocks in one great performance as the psychic Alex who can sense
what is going to happen in the future, his character is so well-thought and
Devon brings him out brilliantly, and gives us a character we can both relate
to, and hope we never have to. Ali Larter (who was previously in "House on
Haunted Hill" and "Varsity Blues") gives a great down to earth performance, as
a girl who is an outcast, not very well-known, but very special in her own way.
The rest of the cast includes Kerr Smith, Daniel Roebuck and the always great
Tony Todd round out a great cast.
This is one breathtakingly scary film, that is one of the scariest I have seen.
It's inventiveness never ceases to amaze me, the script is brilliantly written,
and James Wong is a great new director. I definately recommend "Final
Destination" to those who are tired of teen movies, and ready for a hardcore
horror flick.

Even if I did not know that director and co-writers James Wong and Jeffrey

The X-Files, I would have inevitably made a connection. The similarities are
very apparent from the inexplicable phenomenon- like plot, to the mysterious

fitting to see FBI Agents Mulder and Scully investigate this case, they witness
stuff like this on a weekly basis (in fact Mulder and Scully would have been a
much more welcome change to the bland one dimensional FBI agents seen in this
movie). Another more important similarity, is that both succeed in entertaining
and thrilling at the same time. This is a great accomplishment for a teen
horror movie, especially when compared to some of the trash, of the same genre,
released in the last couple of years (Urban Legend and I Still Know What You
Did Last Summer are classic examples from the bunch). 
What helps Final Destination is its unique premise. Unlike your average horror
flick in which some invincible psycho with a knife chases blonde cheerleaders,
the villain presented is unusual, it's the Grim Reaper. This being already has
predestined when and how you will die. According to the brief history lesson
given in this film, everyone was meant to die at a certain time, some people at
100, others at 17, whatever Death chooses. What is unique about Death is that
it's already dead, so you can't really kill it. The only way to defeat Death is
to cheat it; the question is how do you do that? This dilemma is what faces
Alex and a group of teenagers. Alex has been having some dreams that the
airplane which will take his class on a trip to Paris will crash, leaving no
survivors. Alex begins to realize that his dreams are a little too real and
eventually gets himself and six others kicked off the plane right before it
takes off. Shortly after, the plane does indeed crash leaving some of the seven
survivors confused and others feeling immortal. However, Death isn't through
with them yet. It gradually kills off the seven one by one, leaving those
currently still alive frantically trying to trick Death again.
The plot allows for some of the most creative, original death scenes I have
seen in a while.  Some scenes build up the perfect amount of tension until an
elaborate climax, others are so unexpected they will leave your jaw wide open
in shock. Creativity and originality are two adjectives lacking in most horror
films nowadays but Final Destination is not like most horror films. Sure, it
has your traditional share of jerks and outsiders (Ali Larter's character is
particularly annoying), but the shocks, from the beginning to the end, are
extremely entertaining. Also director Wong has the sense not to take the movie
too seriously. He knows its just another entertaining guilty pleasure that
won't win any Academy Awards (not even a Golden Globe). The myriad of inside
jokes and gags (the characters are named after famous horror directors, one
character who plays a jerk is named Carter, like X-Files creator Chris Carter,
and a song by John Denver, who died in a plane crash, plays whenever Death is
near) show this movie is a bunch of guys having a good time making a movie. And
from this, I had a great time watching the movie.

I found myself forced to fill in a questionnaire the other day, which at one 
point asked: "Are you offended by anything that offends good taste?" I had to 
answer no. While I do usually take a highbrow approach to things, there are 
no absolutes when it comes to possible emotional reactions. Sometimes it's 
healthy to view things from a low down and dirty point of view.
"Final Destination" proves my point. It's not a great horror movie, nor a 
scary one, and it doesn't even try to satirise its genre. It simply inspires 
its viewers to indulge lurid fascination with violence. I usually find that 
repellent -- look at my scathing reviews of "The Bone Collector", "Ravenous", 
"8mm" and "Urban Legend". What distinguishes this film from those is how 
up-front it is about its morbidity; it's unashamed Grand Guignol, rather than 
sick titillation pretending to be serious drama.
The story begins when a group of forty high-school students board a plane for 
Paris. One of them, Alex (Devon Sawa), has a vivid premonition of the 
aircraft exploding into flames after take-off. He freaks out trying to warn 
people, and in the ensuing commotion gets thrown off the plane, along with a 
teacher (Kristen Cloke) and five other students (Ali Larter, Kerr Smith, Chad 
E. Donella, Seann William Scott, Amanda Detmer). From the airport this group 
see that Alex was right -- the plane blows up before their eyes.
Are the survivors lucky? Well, no, because they soon start dying off anyway, 
and in a speech full of hammed-up grimacing and portentous groaning, a 
strange mortician named Bloodworth (Tony Todd) offers them an interesting 
theory as to why: In cheating death by getting off the plane, they've gone 
against the Grim Reaper's plan, and the creature is now stalking them to make 
up for it. All our heroes have to do is figure out the nature of this plan, 
and how to cheat it again. Ah, no problem.
It's unconventional to find a teen horror movie in which Death himself is the 
villain. Refreshing, too, since there is no opportunity for silly slasher-pic 
clichÃ©s involving friends creeping up on each other and causing false alarms, 
or moments where people creep around in the dark while a killer lurks in the 
shadows. Instead we get elaborate supernatural death traps, which are so 
twisted that our morbid curiosity is enthralled. I don't want to give too 
many specifics away, because the appeal of "Final Destination" lies in 
waiting to see how creative its moments of doom will get, but let me whet 
your appetite for their gleefully sadistic flavour: In one scene, a leak 
causes a kid's bathroom floor to get slippy, while he, unaware, uses a razor 
to nick a pimple from his neck, cuts his nose hair with a sharp scissors, and 
stands opposite a cord that could strangle him if he fell on it. We know he's 
going to die, we can see he's surrounded by potentially fatal objects, and we 
can't turn our eyes from the screen until we've seen him stumble into his 
demise.
This is of course sick, but it's fun, too, even after it's been repeated 
seven times. We leer at how gruesome the film is, allow ourselves to jump 
when death strikes, then laugh at ourselves for jumping. I suspect "Final 
Destination", unlike most horror movies, will not look dated in years to 
come, as it deals directly with the universally interesting theme of 
mortality. Okay, so it deals with it in a goofy way, but goofiness will live 
forever, too.

FINAL DESTINATION (M).  
(New Line Cinema/Village Roadshow)
Director: James Wong
Stars: Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Kerr Smith, Tony Todd, Kristen Cloke, 
Seann William Scott, Chad E Donella, Amanda Detmer, Daniel Roebuck,
Roger Guenveur Smith.
Teen hunk Devon Sawa (Wild America, Casper, etc) seems keen on
carving out a little niche for himself in the teen horror genre.
First there was the decidedly juvenile Idle Hands, and now there's the
formulaic Final Destination, a teen slasher film that seems influenced
by The Twilight Zone.  Final Destination also owes a lot to films like
Friday The Thirteenth and the Scream series, albeit without the
knowing genre references and irreverent style.
Sawa plays Alex Browning, who seems blessed, or cursed, with
the ability to see death coming.  When he and several class mates are
setting off for a trip to Paris, Alex has a premonition that the plane
will explode in spectacular fashion immediately after take off.  He
creates a panic, resulting in him, five friends and a teacher being
thrown off the plane.  Soon after, the plane does explode, and Alex
falls under FBI suspicion.  The seven survivors try to deal with their
guilt and sense of loss in different ways.  But it soon seems that the
seven have only temporarily escaped fate, as one after another they
begin to perish in bloody and mysterious circumstances.  Alex believes
that the deaths are following a pattern and desperately tries to save
his friends and cheat fate once again.  Under the guise of the
formulaic teen supernatural slasher genre, co-writers James Wong and
Glen Morgan (who contributed to episodes of spooky tv series like The
X Files) explore some important philosophical questions.  Is there a
pattern to the way we lead our lives and the manner and timing of our
deaths?  Can we really cheat death if our time is up?  Is Alex
deluding himself into believing that events are following a pattern,
and that he holds the power of life over death in his hands?  However,
many of these themes become a little loss amongst the gore and
bloodletting.
The symbolism during the opening scenes is heavy handed, but
Wong's handling of several scenes throughout injects some suspense, a
sense of dread and even some unexpected touches of humour into the
proceedings.  His direction sometimes shows flair and invention, and
an understanding of the demands and limitations of this genre.  He
maintains a fast pace throughout that, albeit temporarily, glosses
over many of the implausibilities, inconsistencies and gaping holes in
the narrative.  The performances of the mainly young and unknown cast
are more than adequate for this type of film.  Fans of the genre will
recognise Tony Todd, the original Candyman, in a cameo as an unnerving
mortician.
Final Destination may not be a classic of the genre, but it
delivers enough thrills and shocks to satisfy its target audience!

Television. What is it good for? Beats me. Movies have always been my game,
especially over the past few years. Once "Cheers" and "The Larry Sanders
Show" left the airwaves, I was left tinkering around with "Seinfeld" and
"The Simpsons" for a while, but all's I got left nowadays is my weekly
ritual of Mulder & Scully...also known as "The X-Files". Which brings us to
this film, which features the directing and producing debut of two writers
from some of the X-Files' most memorable shows, James Wong and Glen Morgan
respectively, and hopefully a good dose of dark, supernatural, creepy
shtuff!
PLOT:
A high school kid aboard an airplane to France freaks out when he has a
premonition about the plane's deadly fate once airborne, and gets himself
and a few friends kicked off the airlines. It is only when his prophecy
becomes reality a few minutes later, that the handful of survivors suddenly
find themselves in an adversarial position against death, who apparently
doesn't take too kindly to folks bailing out on his cataclysmic plans.
CRITIQUE:
Creepy, dark and unlike many of your standard teen slasher flicks that have
been tossed our way over the past few years, this movie combines an original
and realistic premise, a quick pace, many gruesome and creative death scenes
and a pretty cool ending, if I don't say so myself. Were there many "stock"
characters ready to die like in many of these other thrillers? Well, not
really, but I will admit that there was one dude who was pretty badly
written and did piss me off with his unrealistic attitude throughout most of
the film (without naming any names...Carter), but on the whole, the rest of
the kids were decent with the highest kudos going out to Devon Sawa in
another solid leading role. He truly bit into this character and delivers an
effective portrayal of a kid who finds himself fighting the battle of his
life...against death! This film's first 15 minutes are probably its
creepiest, with quick cuts, tense moments and a dark, rainy night adding a
real authenticity to the proceedings, and having me think twice about ever
flying again. This got me hooked.
After that, the film does wind into a pretty basic routine of a "killer" on
the loose with only the order of the victims to be determined, and yet, this
film didn't allow itself to be trite or boring at any point. In fact, the
killing scenes are probably some of the most original that I've seen in
years, and plenty of back-end intrigue via the FBI agents following the
case, the twists and turns discovered by Sawa's character and the general
intelligence of the script take this film above and beyond most of the teen
hokum out there. Granted, I thought they could have spiced up the FBI agents
a bit, and certainly removed an entire scene featuring Tony Todd from
CANDYMAN fame essentially reliving his role from that film, but all in all,
the film's originality, dark undertones and solid performance by Sawa won me
over. Also, it was nice to be scared by something that you couldn't really
"see" for once in a horror film (I guess that's how most people felt about
BLAIR WITCH...an overrated movie in my opinion), and be spared the two-bit
special effects gallery. And if you thought the last shot from BLAIR WITCH
was a keeper, well, let's just say that this one goes out with a bang! A
real scream... :)
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Devon Sawa was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
Actress Valerie Cloke, who plays the teacher character named Valerie Lewton
in this film, is married to producer/writer Glen Morgan in real life.
Devon Sawa's main co-star in this movie, Ali Larter, is probably best
remembered for her awesome debut role as the "whipped cream naked girl" from
VARSITY BLUES (7/10).
The characters' names in this film were apparently written as homages to
some of the greats of the genre. Alex's surname is Browning, as in Todd
Browning who directed FREAKS and the original DRACULA. Billy's surname is
Hitchcock, and Valeri is a moniker for Val Luten, whose credits include CAT
PEOPLE and WALK OF THE ZOMBIE.
Earlier drafts of this film's script featured no connection between any of
the characters who leave the plane early on in the movie, having them seek
one another out instead.
This film was originally titled FLIGHT 180, which is the number of the
flight the kids were to have taken early on in the film.

Final Destination: chronicle of a death foretold
Emily Dickinson started one of her poems off 'Because I could not stop for
death / He kindly stopped for me.' James Wong's Final Destination pretty
much just removes the 'kindly' from that idea. It gets going just as the
trailer promises, too: with a fiery plane crash. Meaning we know that this
planeload of students on their senior trip isn't making it to Paris alive.
Meaning this first sequence should, by all counts, be void of all tension,
as we already know the outcome, already know that all these 'portents' Alex
(Devon Sawa) is cueing into aren't just projections of his fear of flying,
but are in fact glimpses into the immediate future. In spite of this
foreknowledge, though--or, perhaps, because of it--Wong's still able to
generate all the nerves the sequence requires and then some (by focusing on
how Alex will get off the plane, not if), which sets the tone for the rest
of the movie, where Alex is the one with foreknowledge. He just doesn't
always know 'how' until almost too late. It's a very effective device.
And of course it's been done before, too, in every slasher movie to roll off
the assembly line. We know Michael/Jason/Freddy/etcetera is going to get
their quota of teens, we just don't always know how. Where Final Destination
distinguishes itself from the crowd, however, is that there's no Michael or
Jason or Freddy. In fact, there's no visually satisfying physical
manifestation of the Grim Reaper at all, which is quite a gamble. It pays
off, though: by keeping Death immaterial, it gains the ability to be
everywhere, charging every moment with the possibility of its presence. In a
way, too, we want Death to be there, to be picking off these people who
should have already died. It answers our need for balance, equilibrium,
justice.
This doesn't mean we want this unlikely crew of survivors to die, either,
though, which is part of the pleasure of Final Destination. Most of the time
it's enough to compel the drama forward via conflict between the characters,
their situation, all that. Final Destination ups the ante a little, by
placing the conflict in us, manipulating us into both sympathizing with the
stalker (Death, who was cheated) and the stalked (who seem to have done
nothing to deserve death, other than being between 12 and 19 in a horror
film). As if this wasn't enough, Final Destination also smuggles the whole
Boethian dilemma into the works: is Alex (God, here, though he denies it)
just 'seeing' all these events before they happen, or are they happening
because he's seeing them? To add to all this, too, there's a wonderful
spooky cameo by Tony Todd (Ben from the Night of the Living Dead remake?).
Here he's a mortician called Bludworth, and--though his role in Final
Destination is more myth-based (he's a 'helper'), and thus not really in
sync with all the slasher conventions--still, his performance is cool enough
that none of that matters. We're too busy listening to the owls calling
everyone's name, the bells tolling for him and him and her, a Faustian death
calling in its marker, all that fun stuff. And yes, 'fun stuff' does include
some lines like "I've got to get my head together" spoken moments after a
decapitation, but, unlike Scream etcetera, Final Destination doesn't live
and breathe by such cuteness. Instead, it just tacks it on here and there,
mutes it down enough to where it's there if you're listening, but doesn't
get in the way if you're not.
Granted, Final Destination is more or less a serious treatment of, say, Bill
& Ted's Bogus Adventure, where they also have to outwit Death (by playing
Battleship, among other things), but it's something in it's own right too,
simply because it rarely takes the easy way out, doesn't go for the cheap
scream each time. In this regard, it feels a lot like Disturbing Behavior,
only it's got a little more substance to it. And, like Lord of the
Illusions, it holds just enough back for--in Nix's words--"one final
illusion." All horror tries to do this, and only few succeed. Final
Destination is in the latter category here. And it gets there by not
breaking the rules it's already established, which is something of a feat in
itself, to say nothing of how elaborately that last death is staged, Mr.
Rube Goldberg. Never has 'how' been so fun to answer.

These days, teen slasher flicks are expected to be self-referential and
ironic. But in a strange reversal, Final Destination seeks to defy the
new convention by approaching the genre straight (although the writers
couldn't resist naming characters after film-makers such as Hitchcock,
Lewton, Browning and Murnau).  In this return to pre-Scream horror movie
making, characters just go about the traditional business of getting
hacked to bits without spending half the time discussing what would
happen if they were in a slasher flick.
The story has a premise that could have come straight out of The
Twilight Zone. A group of high-school students is about to leave on a
school trip to France. While in the aircraft on the tarmac waiting to
take off, Alex (Devon Sawa) has a premonition in which the aircraft
explodes after take-off. He panics and is removed from the plane, along
with a few fellow students and a teacher. Sure enough, the plane
explodes, and all onboard are killed. When bizarre and wickedly
entertaining accidents start disposing of the survivors one by one, Alex
realises that the killer is not one of those Freddie Krueger or Candyman
amateurs, but is the scythe-wielding Big D himself, determined to
restore natural order by dispatching those who cheated death in the
aircraft. 
As the film progresses, we wonder not only which member of the young
cast is next going to meet his or her end, but what grisly new twist on
slicing, mangling or skewering is going to be involved. Some of the
deaths are ludicrously protracted and involve everyday objects taking on
a life of their own, controlled by the unseen killer like a deadly and
perversely funny game of Mousetrap. Just to keep us on our toes,
director and co-writer James Wong, who cut his teeth on the X-files,
gives us one death that is shockingly abrupt.
Final Destination is a formulaic horror flick for the Saturday night
popcorn crowd, with flashes of inventively gruesome fun.

[asteriked footnote]-> *(By only the longest stretch of the imagination).
The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
It's the Laughfest Of The Year!  
Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) boards a plane bound for Paris with his high 
school classmates and French teachers, amongst them Tod (Chad E. 
Donella), his best friend; Carter (Kerr Smith), who doesn't like Alex; 
Terry (Amanda Detmer), Carter's girlfriend; Billy (Seann William Scott), 
the Comic Relief; Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), a girl who doesn't know 
him--yet; and teacher Valerie Lewton (Kristen Cloke).  But Alex has a 
vision that the plane will explode, and after he freaks out about his 
vision, the seven of them leave the plane--minutes before it actually 
explodes, exactly as he pictured it would.
His act of saving their lives, of course, fails to endear him to anyone 
but Clear Rivers ["Clear Rivers", get it?  Fun-nee!].  His premonition 
spooks most of the others out (except Carter, who is downright hostile 
to him).  But that's the least of his worries: he also has to deal with 
FBI agents Weine (Daniel Roebuck) and Trey (Roger Guenveur Smith) [ooh, 
these play-on-words names just keep getting better and better!]--and 
with the spooky Mortician (Tony Todd) named Bludworth [stop it, you're 
splitting my sides!] who warns Alex that Death isn't finished with them.  
His message to Alex?  "I'll see you soon."
Surely, this flick was a stroke of comedic parodying genius.  How else 
would one explain the many Signs And Guideposts foretelling the action 
ahead?  From the ominous "this is the end" line writ in red during the 
opening credits, to the first scenes of the mother tearing Alex's "lucky 
tag" from his suitcase against his wishes, to the "Ghost"-like Murky 
Death Images spattered throughout, to...well, damn near everything else 
in between, the audience quickly (and repeatedly) learns that someone is 
about to Die, wooo!  
And not just Die!, nosiree, that'd be too boring!  Our heros and 
heroetts are offed in the spectacular fashion befitting such a satiric 
look at Really Bad Horror Flicks like...oh, say, "Candyman" [parts 1 
through 12. So far. But I digress].  Death is one creative mutha here: 
mad as the dickens that Alex robbed it ("it", because Death isn't ever 
seen here; just its Instruments) of its rightful task, Death manifests 
itself via water, electricity, towels, fire, flying objects...heck, 
Death has itself one helluva party!  And not to be outdone, the teens 
sure could pull a fast one on Death!  Who knew that duct tape could be 
used as a Grim Reaper-stopper?
Yes, this had to be a riff on the horror genre.  Had to be; the actors 
were too solemn, too serious about the dumbest of situations, the most 
idiotic of lines, for it to really have been a straight-up thriller.  
Surely, FBI Agents wouldn't really be so laughably inept?  Surely, 
morticians wouldn't really Appear From Nowhere and start cutting up a 
corpse in front of trespassing teens?  Surely, next-in-line victims 
wouldn't really all but have bullseye signs drawn on them and stand 
right on the "I got your death right here, punk!" mark drawn in the 
ground?  Nah!  Director James Wong and writer Glen Morgan are comic 
geniuses, I tell ya!  Bravo!  Take a bow!  Right on this mark over 
here...  
You'll laugh!  You'll...laugh some more!  And when it's over, you'll ask 
yourself, "what the hell was THAT?"
The "Black Factor"  [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
Tony "Candyman" Todd's appearance as Bludworth the Mortician reminded me 
of Eric Todd-Dullum's  guest star turns on TV's "Homicide: Life On The 
Street" in that campy acting/pianissimo voice way they both had.  Though 
he has a fairly long credits listing on the Internet Movie Database, 
I've never seen Todd in anything else but "Candyman" (and I'm not sure 
I'd really want to).  Still, it was kind of a kick to see him in a 
non-maniac role for once, goofy though it may have been.
Bammer's Bottom Line:
You know that phrase "so bad it's good"?  It's got "Final Destination" 
written all over it.  But I'm not complaining; I needed a good laugh 
right about now. 
"Final Destination": 
(rating: greenlight): Early pick for Comedy Of The Year!
(rating: yellowlight): What, it's really supposed to be a thriller, not 
a comedy?  Whoops...

I'm not quite sure where to begin with this movie. First of all, I must say
that this film is bad, a tepid piece of trash really defines it well. Yet I
found myself somewhat drawn to the characters and their situation. This was
probably due to a script that (while stupid and cliched) is also fun, fast
paced, and exciting. Some of the moments where the writing shines through
(there are few of them) are mildly enjoyable, as are some several special
touches that will reward the horror movie junkie.
Alex (Sawa, who appeared in the even worse Idle Hands) is very sacred of
flying. He and a large group of classmates are heading to Paris for a week.
Before takeoff he has a nightmare in which the plane blows up in midair. He
awakens and screams that the plane is going to crash and gets himself, five
other students, and a teacher kicked off the plane. The plane does indeed crash
moments later, and there are no survivors. This is when Alex discovers his
skill (so to speak). He can see or tell when people are going to die. When
teens who got kicked off the plane begin mysteriously dying by strange causes,
he sinks deeper and deeper into paranoia. He eventually believes that death
itself is chasing after them, and there is no way to escape their fate. But
who's next on death's list?
One of the things that really bothered me about this movie was the use of
violence. The idea of death coming after teens instead of a masked serial
killer is original, but the ways of death are way too drawn out, implausible,
and gory. More than half of the blood could have been saved, and the movie
would still achieve the R rating it appeared the filmmakers were looking for.
Too many things just happen, and ideas about what is going on are grasped too
quickly by the characters and it takes away a feeling of mystery. The question
becomes not who the killer is, but how they will escape the killer. This movie
also comes out at a bad time. It's release comes just after several highly
publicized plane crashes. In particular, one that crashed while heading to
Paris with students on board.
One usually expects shaky performances from teen movies, but these are in a
whole new class. Seann William Scott (American Pie) and Kerr Smith (Jack on
Dawson's Creek) have given two of the worst performances I've witnessed in a
very, very long time. Ali Larter and Devon Sawa stand out as untalented actors
too. Larter really shows her chops while performing such gut wrenching scenes
as listening to a CD on a CD player, frantically trying to start a car, and
doing her best to look bewildered. Acting God Devon Sawa really shows us raw,
human emotion in such scenes as rolling down a hill, and looking through the
latest issue of Penthouse. If things couldn't get any worse, then Tony Todd (of
the original Candyman, apparently thrown in here for kicks) will really excite
you as a mortician named Bludworth who appears in one scene, and is never quite
explained. Other inside jokes include a character with the last name Hitchcock,
a woman listening to a John Denver record, and popping up for no apparent
reason, a poster for 1998's wickedly funny John Waters' film Pecker. It hangs
content on Alex's wall in the beginnings scenes of the movie. It's about the
only thing in this movie that isn't slapped with blood...or mediocrity.

Is it possible to cheat death, or can it only be delayed a little longer?
This is the primary question posed in "Final Destination", a remarkably
interesting film which could easily have been nothing more than another
teen-slasher movie. I'm not entirely sure just what I found so captivating
about this film; it may have been the performances from the talented young
cast, or the intelligent discussions about the nature of fate. I suppose it
could have been nothing more than morbid curiosity about how each person was
going to die. It may have been the consistently creepy atmosphere created by
James Wong (The X-Files television series), which is further enhanced by a
similarly creepy score from composer, Shirley Walker ("Mystery Men").
Whatever the reason, "Final Destination" turned out to be the movie that
"Scream 3" wanted to be.
Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) is about to go on a class trip to France with
four teachers and forty other students. After a shaky start on the day,
filled with bizarre images and strange gut feelings, he finally boards the
plane. While awaiting departure, Alex has a sudden vision of the plane
exploding in mid-air and all of the passengers being killed. After screaming
about the plane being destroyed, he is ejected from the plane along with
five other students and one teacher. The aircraft wastes no time in
fulfilling Alex's vision, and the seven survivors slowly move on with their
lives, dealing with their unexpected luck in different ways. However, as the
creepy mortician Bludworth (Tony Todd) points out, in death there are no
accidents, no coincidences, and no escapes. As the survivors are slowly
picked off, Alex must determine when death is going to try for him again.
James Wong's film is loaded with atmosphere; I suppose due to his work on
The X-Files. The death scenes are mostly done in a very stylish manner with
Walker's score playing hauntingly in the background, while we watch death
creep up on the unsuspecting victims. Alex's visions are interestingly done
as well. They never actually show him the deaths (except the plane crash
vision), he must determine how the things he sees might cause a death. Not
all the death scenes are slow and stylish; some are there purely for shock
value, and boy do they ever shock. One death scene occured so suddenly that
the audience and I didn't even have a chance to jump in surprise. Everyone
simply stared at the screen in shock, for several seconds, before exploding
into cheers and applause for how well the surprise was accomplished.
"Final Destination" features quite a talented cast. Devon Sawa ("Idle
Hands") is a very talented, young actor who I could see breaking into some
great roles. Ali Larter ("House on Haunted Hill"), who plays the strangely
named Clear Rivers, is excellent as the only person who believes Alex was
responsible for saving her life. The remaining young actors (Chad Donella,
Seann William Scott, Amanda Detmer) are uniformly good, each playing a very
different character. Tony Todd ("Candyman", "The Rock") may appear in only
one scene, but the man is so excellent at causing chills to run down your
spine just listening to him, that any appearance at all is welcome. The only
weak link is Daniel Roebuck ("US Marshalls") as FBI Agent Wiene. I don't
actually think this is due to Roebuck himself, as he is not an untalented
actor, but the character served no purpose.
Another thing I must compliment Wong about was the way in which he was able
to keep the film from falling into any typical teen-slasher movie patterns.
On nearly every occasion that the movie begins to show signs of becoming
cliche ridden, Wong reins it in nicely. The only exceptions are a long,
drawn out chase scene near the end and one somewhat predictable death scene.
"Final Destination" runs an admirable 100 minutes, though a little trimming
couldn't have hurt. I give it a full recommendation for some great acting,
an intriguing premise, and some thought provoking dialogue. I also admit to
having a weakness for atmospheric movies, and this one is steeped in it. I
give "Final Destination" a well earned four out of five stars.

Review by: Mike Summers  ** out of *****
        The premise of the new James Wong film, Final Destination, is that 
Alex Browning, the protagonist, prevents six of his friends from boarding a 
doomed airplane, thereby cheating fate. However, fate is not so easily bested, 
and Alex's friends soon begin dying in unusual circumstances. Essentially, 
this premise is a clever-way to make a slasher-flick without the slasher.   
Unfortunately, this is practically the only clever thing about the film. As 
far as teen horror flicks go, Final Destination is better than many.  There is 
enough shocking death, graphic gore, and requisite black humor to provide the 
essential "roller coaster" type thrill at the heart of the average horror 
flick.  Unfortunately, this film also suffers from the worst characteristics 
of this genre. The relationships between the main characters are tenuous and 
their motivations are meaningless except as excuse to set-up the next death. 
The scene where two of the characters break into a funeral home to view the 
body of their recently killed friend is suppose to be scary and dramatic but 
features some of the dumbest dialogue I have witnessed.  If you are looking 
for a Saturday night thriller to scare your date, this film might do the 
trick. Other than that, wait until it goes into heavy-rotation on cable.
