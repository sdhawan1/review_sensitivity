A month or so ago, Sony sent a 30-minute highlight reel of their
upcoming film Vertical Limit to Rochester for critics to get a special
sneak preview of the mountain climbing movie's dazzling action
sequences. Most of the scenes, especially the first, looked pretty good,
so there was legitimate potential for Limit to entertain where similar
films (like Cliffhanger and K2) succeeded solely in sucking.
They should have left well enough alone, as the additional 96 minutes
that were left off Limit's highlight reel are downright awful.  The more
I learned about the characters, the more I hated them.  Ditto for the
film's story.  Perhaps it's because there is an inherent problem with
rooting for those who seek thrills by doing dumb things.  People who
insist on partaking in death-defying activities, be they bungee jumping,
mountain climbing, downhill skiing or masturbating with a kitchen knife
while jumping on a trampoline, deserve to be hurt.  Badly.
Limit opens similarly to M:I-2, putting its star(s) on the face of a red
rock mountain somewhere in the American southwest.  Instead of a
stealthy spy with no equipment, Limit shows a family of three playing
`Name That Tune' while they make their vertical ascent.  But something
goes wrong, leaving father Royce Garrett (Stuart Wilson, Here on Earth)
and his two adult children dangling from a rope meant to hold two
people. Royce tells his son Peter (Chris O'Donnell, The Bachelor) to cut
him loose, while daughter Annie (Robin Tunney, End of Days) pleads for
her father to not sacrifice his life.  It's a heart-in-your-throat scene
that is well-executed and as dramatic as anything you'll see in an
action film.
Unfortunately, the potential for the rest of Limit drops faster than
Royce. Flash forward three years, where Peter has sworn off the mountain
in favor of a photography career for National Geographic and his
estranged sister Annie has become one of the world's top climbers.  The
siblings haven't spoken since the accident but somehow end up in the
same place  at the base of Earth's second-largest peak (called `K2').
Peter is there to film Himalayan snow leopards, while Annie is involved
in a climb with a crackpot billionaire (Bill Paxton, U-571) who plans on
using the ascent to promote his new airline company.
And, wouldn't you know it, Annie's group is trapped in a crevasse near
the peak of K2, and Peter has a limited amount of time to rescue his
sister before the cold and high altitudes finish her off.  For a
climbing mate, Peter chooses the wacky, wizard-like Montgomery Wick
(Scott Glenn, The Virgin Suicides), who lost his wife on the same
mountain during a climb sponsored by the same billionaire some four
years earlier.
Limit is poorly paced, just like director Martin Campbell's last effort,
The Mask of Zorro.  The scenes filmed outside look fantastic, thanks to
the keen eye of cinematographer David Tattersall (The Green Mile), but
Limit also features scenes filmed on hokey, ice-covered sets that have
"sound stage" written all over them (not literally, but they may as well
have). The transition from the lovely outdoors (filmed on and around New
Zealand's Mt. Cook) to the pretend outdoors looks awful and, at times,
is laughable.  Conversely, Limit's jokes and one-liners are anything
but.
2:06  PG-13 for intense life/death situations and brief strong language

Susan Granger's review of "VERTICAL LIMIT" (Sony Pictures Entertainment)
 I must confess that I am vertically challenged, meaning that
when I peer down a deep crevasse, my palms get sweaty and my knees go
weak. So, despite its inherent implausibility, this suspenseful
excursion into mountain-climbing had my heart pounding - but it was
more my acrophobia than the cliffhanger by writers Robert King and
Terry Hayes and director Martin Campbell ("The Mask of
Zorro"). Lifting liberally from "K2," "Wages of Fear" and the IMAX
film "Everest," the story begins with high drama on a cliff in Moab,
Utah, where Peter Garrett (Chris O'Donnell) and sister Annie (Robin
Tunney) survive a rock-climbing accident that costs the life of their
father (Stuart Wilson). Flash forward several years: Peter has traded
his carabiners for cameras, photographing snow leopards in the
Himalayas for National Geographic, while Annie, now a hotshot
mountaineer, has joined with another expert (Nicholas Lea) to lead
Elliot Vaughn (Bill Paxton), a millionaire entrepreneur - think
Richard Branson, to the summit of the world's second highest peak, a
commercial stunt perfectly timed coincide with a fly-over of a plane
from his new airline. But when they're trapped in a cavern by an
avalanche with just 36 hours to live, Peter assembles his own motley
team, led by a Jeremiah Johnson-like recluse (Scott Glenn), to lug
canisters of nitroglycerin up to blast through and rescue them.
    The outdoor scenes are quite realistic and cinematically spectacular, but the stereotypical characterizations are mundane and mediocre. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Vertical Limit" is a dizzying 6. The title refers to the high, oxygen-deprived altitude of 26,000 feet above sea level, where the human body cannot survive for long.

     After suffering through an airline showing of The Perfect Storm, I
could think of no better way to spend the evening than with another Man
vs. Nature story in 2000's take on the genre, Vertical Limit.
     As the thrill-packed trailer might already have cued you, this is
an action-filled mountaineering movie, with Chris O'Donnell as Peter
Garrett, the unlikely hero trying to save his stranded sister Annie
(Robin Tunney) from certain death atop K2, the second-highest place on
earth.  How'd she get there?  Glad you asked... three years after a
family tragedy sends Annie on a perpetual climbing quest and Peter
grounded on earth, the siblings meet up again at the base of K2, where a
Texas billionaire (Bill Paxton) is ascending the peak as a publicity
stunt with Annie in tow.  Naturally, we learn you can't mess with Mother
Nature for profit, and the climbing team ends up stuck in a crevasse
only a few hundred feet from the summit -- beaten up, but alive. 
Barely.
     Peter is forced to climb again -- even though he's sworn it off,
they suck him back in (it's Cliffhanger by way of The Godfather) for the
noble cause of saving sis.  After recruiting resident
weirdo/chip-on-his-shoulder-character Montgomery Wick (Scott Glenn) and
some other local rabble, it's a race against time to save the smarmy
billionaire and/or the innocent girl.  Wonder who'll get saved, dontcha?
     Oddly, Vertical Limit has very little going against it... and very
little in its favor.  So much of the film feels familiar, drawn from
Cliffhanger (though it desperately tries to avoid that comparison, but
fails) -- from the setting to the hokey jokes drawn from yesterday's
e-mail lists to some rather obvious plotting.  We've even seen Paxton
take on the elements before (in Twister).  That he's the bad guy here
doesn't seem to make much difference to the picture's originality.  The
movie isn't bad by any stretch, but it's just so plain that it will find
a rough time attracting a thrill-seeking audience on a crowded holiday
weekend.
     About all that is worth noting here is the attempt at remaking the
boy next door, Chris O'Donnell, as an action star.  It worked for Will
Smith, right?  O'Donnell, and I love the guy to death, is such a cute
little fella that you can totally buy him as Robin Tunney's brother, if
only Robin Tunney lived in Poughkeepsie and her cat was stuck in a tree
and, well, Chris had to climb the daunting 15 feet up there to get it. 
But O'Donnell at 26,000 feet is a contrivance that I doubt anyone is
going to buy, despite throwing the poor guy into way-over-the-top action
scenarios (you've seen the jumping-over-the-chasm clip by now), all of
which come out of nowhere as a platform for him to strut upon.  Sorry
Chris, get thee back to Circle of Friends.
     Overall, the movie is capably directed, poorly edited, and acted
with gusto.  Aside from this, it bears mention that Vertical Limit is
extremely (and surprisingly) gruesome and far too long, with too many
side stories and too few that don't suddenly end with an avalanche
(seriously).  Whether you like the movie or not, one thing's for sure:
After seeing Vertical Limit's spine-tingling opening, you won't be in
any hurry to rush up your local cliff-face.  Hell, I'm even trying to
keep away from the stairs.

Directed by Martin Campbell. Screenplay by Robert King and Terry Hayes, 
from a story by King. Starring Chris O'Donnell, Robin Tunney, Bill Paxton. 
Running time: 126 minutes. Rated AA by the MFCB. Reviewed on December 
16th, 2000.
I can remember clearly the moment I knew "Vertical Limit" was going to be 
a disappointment. Chris O'Donnell walks through a camp at the base of K2, 
the world's second tallest mountain. Another climber, played by Izabella 
Scorupco, spots O'Donnell. And that's when The Look transpires between 
them. They look, and they look, and they look. So artificial and 
transparent is the scene that it would have worked better had Scorupco 
been wearing a big sign around her neck reading "O'Donnell's Love 
Interest" -- at least that would have been worth a chuckle.
But "Vertical Limit" is short on imagination, and long on predictability 
and shallowness. It is populated by characters into whom very little 
thought has obviously been invested; they exist purely to fill their roles 
in the paper-thin plot and, once they have served this role, they are 
dispensed with, one way or another. That's how you know that, inevitably, 
Scorupco and O'Donnell will end up together. Or consider the mountaineer 
Skip (Robert Taylor). His purpose in "Vertical Limit" is to use his status 
at the K2 camp to goad others into joining O'Donnell on a rescue mission. 
This accomplished, an arbitrary whim of the story shunts him out of the
action, and he practically vanishes from the screen.
No more inventive are the plot twists, most of which hinge on the 
canisters of nitroglycerine the characters carry with them as they 
speedily ascend K2. It's bad enough that the explosive force of the nitro 
seems to vary depending on the needs of the plot (at one point, an entire 
crateful barely destroys a shed; later, a single canister nearly 
devastates a mountainside). It's even worse that the stuff seems to 
survive any amount of jostling, unless the story demands that it suddenly 
become a peril. But the sheer stupidity of the characters around it -- 
leaving a crate, which had been carefully stowed away, open in the 
sunshine for no good reason; or, later, sitting five feet away from it 
when they know there's a good chance it might explode -- is positively 
criminal.
To be fair, there are some good, tense moments. Mountaineering is an 
extremely hazardous sport, and "Vertical Limit" effectively conveys the 
many disasters which can befall even the most experienced climber. One of 
the best scenes in the movie sees Scorupco trying to save a fellow 
mountaineer, who is clinging by his pickaxe to the edge of a snowy ledge. 
As Scorupco edges out toward him, the ledge slowly starts to break away, 
threatening to pitch them both into the abyss beyond. Similarly, a scene 
where O'Donnell jumps a wide chasm and barely manages to hook himself into 
the opposite mountain face is genuinely exciting (even if, in reality, he 
probably would have torn his shoulders from their sockets).
But the dangers become too repetitive, too quickly. There's only so many 
times a yawning chasm, an incipient avalanche, or the ubiquitous 
nitroglycerine can be brought into play and still make the audience 
anxious. Director Martin Campbell ("Goldeneye", "The Mask Of Zorro") 
simply doesn't find a way to make each danger seem new and rivetting.
Of course, it's hard to expect much from a movie which borrows from 
Sylvester Stallone's "Cliffhanger" from the word go. O'Donnell plays Peter 
Garrett, a climber along with his sister Annie (Robin Tunney) and father 
Royce (Stuart Wilson). While scaling a sheer cliff face, the ineptitude of 
a couple of novice mountaineers puts the Garrett family in jeopardy, 
hanging from a single carabiner. Royce, who is on the bottom, tells Peter 
to cut him loose, since he knows the carabiner can't support the weight of 
all three of them. Reluctantly, Peter does so; in one of the movie's most 
gratuitous scenes, we then see Royce's body thud to the ground far below.
Three years later, Peter is a photographer for the National Geographic 
Society. He and Annie -- now a world-renowned speed climber -- are no 
longer on speaking terms, because she blames Peter for their father's 
death. By coincidence, Peter ends up in the vicinity of K2 at the same 
time as Annie, who is helping billionaire Elliott Vaughn (Bill Paxton) 
scale the peak as part of a publicity gimmick. Vaughn pretends that K2 
expert Tom McLaren (Nicholas Lea) is in charge of the ascent, but when bad 
weather hits and Tom wants to turn back, Vaughn goads him into continuing
on. Soon, the party is hit by a ferocious avalanche; everyone is killed 
except Vaughn, Annie and Tom, who fall into a crevasse. This leaves Peter 
to mount a desperate mission to save the trio before thirty-six hours pass 
and they all die from pulmonary edema.
Beyond this point, "Vertical Limit" transpires in typical disaster-movie 
fashion: a variety of supporting characters are introduced, only to be 
killed off one by one to show how truly fearsome the situation is. There 
is a villain, of course, and there is an old eccentric (Scott Glenn) who 
proves to be the key to the rescue mission, despite having a hidden agenda 
of his own. It is clear that scriptwriters Robert King and Terry Hayes 
have lifted this one step-by-step from "Screenplays For Dummies" -- 
there's not a single plot point you won't see coming a mile away.
Even worse, King and Hayes demonstrate no flair whatsoever for dialogue. 
"Vertical Limit" is full of overwrought, scarcely believable passages. 
There is precisely one good line in the entire film -- Taylor's 
description of Scorupco -- and even that probably won't have as much 
meaning for audiences outside of Canada.
Campbell does at least take good advantage of the tremendous Asian 
landscape; "Vertical Limit" is breathtaking visually, if in no other 
respects. But this is scarcely enough to save the movie as a whole. By the 
time the first wave of snow comes thundering down the mountainside, I 
found myself wishing it would sweep me out of the theatre, too.

For viewers who think movies should be more like plotless IMAX films, 
director Martin Campbell provides a feast for your eyes in the 35mm 
motion picture, VERTICAL LIMIT.  Your brain will likely feel starved, 
but your thumbs will get lots of exercise as you twiddle them waiting 
for the inevitable disaster to strike so that the story can finally get 
some traction.  
The producers should get their money back from writers Robert King 
(CUTTHROAT ISLAND) and Terry Hayes (PAYBACK) since the script is 
laughably weak.  Characters are killed off before we ever get to know 
them enough to care about their demise.  Their rapid deaths, of course, 
are done so that we can have as many dramatic incidents as possible.  
You don't go "wow" during an IMAX film for the dialog.  You do so when 
the IMAX movie makes you experience some vicarious moment of terror.  
Easily, the most ridiculous part of VERTICAL LIMIT is the proclivity of 
the characters to die for the greater good.  For most people, the idea 
of suicide as a way to help someone else isn't something they could do 
easily or ever.
After an opening reminiscent of the opening sequence of MISSION: 
IMPOSSIBLE II, the movie cuts to 3 years later when Peter and Annie 
Garrett (Chris O'Donnell and Robin Tunney), brother and sister climbers, 
are in the Himalayas.  Except for their displays of physical strength, 
neither O'Donnell nor Tunney gives much to their parts.  This isn't a 
movie that stands up to much logical examination.  Several of the film's 
sequences, while impressive, appear quite impossible.
The only real acting of any merit in the movie comes from Scott Glenn, 
as toeless, recluse Montgomery Wick.  Labeled a "lunatic" by some, Wick 
has spent the last four years climbing K2 alone, while looking for the 
body of his dead wife.  Wick is the only climber in the story who can 
scale K2's extreme heights without ever being out of breath.  
Surprisingly, only once does any climber, certainly not the 
indefatigable Wick, resort to using bottled oxygen.
Bill Paxton, as Elliot Vaughn, plays a megalomaniac, clearly patterned 
after Richard Branson of the Virgin Atlantic fortune.  One assumes, 
however, that Branson would not be willing to kill people in his search 
for thrills and for his own greater glory.  Although Paxton appears to 
be having fun, he delivers one of his weakest performances.  
After hosting "the highest party in the world," Elliot is off on an 
assault on K2 with Annie as a member of his team.  The party looks like 
a drinking scene from a generic teen comedy.  Gosh, isn't mountain 
climbing fun?  The story even includes a pair of Australian stoner dude 
brothers, who like to sun themselves in the buff, but who are really 
K2-capable climbers.  
Peter, deciding that Elliot has chosen the wrong time of day to begin 
the climb, asks Annie, "What does the mountain say?"  It's that kind of 
script.
My personal favorite among the many ridiculous aspects of the movie is 
its ability to telegraph key twists with absolute precision.  Carefully 
choosing a day in which their bank of computers has determined that it 
is 82% likely to have good weather, Elliot and company start their climb 
in glorious sunshine.  Without any computers whatsoever, exactly what do 
you calculate would be the chance that a storm will come out of nowhere?  
100%?
With its sweeping music and sometimes stunning cinematography, the film 
does have its rewards.  But if you're looking solely for visual thrills, 
go for a real IMAX film, not an ersatz substitute.
VERTICAL LIMIT runs a long 2:06.  It is rated PG-13 for intense 
life/death situations and brief strong language and would be fine for 
kids around 12 and up.

VERTICAL LIMIT (director: Martin Campbell; screenwriters: Robert King
and Terry Hayes, based on a story by Mr. King; cinematographer: David
Tattersall; editor: Thom Noble; cast: Chris O'Donnell (Peter Garrett),
Bill Paxton (Elliot Vaughn), Robin Tunney (Annie Garrett), Scott Glenn
(Montgomery Wick), Izabella Scorupco (Monique Aubertine), Temuera
Morrison (Major Rasul), Nicholas Lea (Tom McLaren), Alexander Siddig
(Kareem), Steve Le Marquand (Cyril Bench), Ben Mendelsohn (Malcolm
Bench), Robert Taylor (Skip Taylor), Stuart Wilson (Royce Garrett),
Roshan Seth (Colonel Amir Salem); Runtime: 126; Columbia Pictures; 2000)
A superficial but entertaining roller-coaster-ride of nonstop action
featuring cliché characters and contrived dangerous situations, mainly
conceived to show off the special effects. The story is so slight that
there is no danger of it interfering with the action scenes. It's a
Hollywood blockbuster for those in need of escaping reality for two
hours and should prove to be enjoyable for those who are willing to go
with the flow of the action and suspend their critical judgment. The
reward will be a visual treat of well-executed stunts and a film that
had the glossy look of a National Geographic photography shoot. The
director Martin Campbell ("Goldeneye") relishes in filming excesses and
creating one life-and-death scene after the other. Movie viewers could
go snowblind just watching a series of mountain catastrophes befall the
adventurous climbers, as the film throws out almost any possible danger
there is to be found on a mountain and the mountain climbers  try to
overcome these impossible obstacles and, there is, needlessly to say, a
race-against-time sequence, with a last second rescue in the works.
The opening eight-minute scene, derivative as it is, is brilliantly done
and captures whatever underlying tension the film was to later on build
up to. The Garrett family is out for a pleasure mountain climbing trip
to the ochre cliffs of Monument Valley, as Peter (Chris O'Donnell) and
his sister Ann (Robin Tunney) are climbing with dad Royce (Stuart
Wilson) and a couple of unnamed companions. One of those companions
first has his backpack fall and thereby loosens the tow rope entangling
the others, trapping the family with the other two companions dangling
off a peak. The companions can't hold on and tragically fall. Royce
warns that the line won't hold all three for long and pleads that his
son cut him loose to have any hope of saving his children. Ignoring
Annie's tearful protests, Peter cuts the rope and the father falls to
his death.
It's three years later and Peter is a National Geographic photographer
shooting in the Himalayas. He ends up at a Pakistani military base,
where they are in the middle of a war with India. Nearby is a K2 base
camp, where Annie is a crew member on billionaire sportsman Elliot
Vaughn (Bill Paxton) team that is set to climb the dangerous summit of
K2--the world's second-highest peak. The brother and sister reunite
after becoming more distant with each other. They never discussed their
father's death since the tragedy, but have gone their separate ways.
Peter has abandoned mountain climbing, while Annie has become known as
the fastest climber in the world and is a Sports Illustrated cover girl.
She is still upset with what Peter did and could hardly face him, much
less talk to him about it.
At the richly put together base camp of Elliot's expedition, the
arrogant businessman has surrounded himself with the best team money can
buy, including the foremost climber in the world, Tom McLaren (Nicholas
Lea). He is to lead Elliot to the summit of K2 in time to coincide with
one of the planes flying overhead from Elliot's new airline he is
launching. The commercial motive for the climb and the callous way he
will soon treat his fellow climbers, makes him the film's designated
one-dimensional villain, and adds some more spice to a film that is
overspiced already with clichés.
Warned by the base camp of severe weather conditions, Elliot refuses the
leader's advice to turn back and manipulates the leader to go against
his better judgment and continue on, where they reach the vertical limit
at 26,000 feet--significant because the oxygen is very thin. When a wind
storm hits--and, Elliot, Annie and Tom end up inside a deep cavern that
becomes sealed by an avalanche, the three realize that they have only 36
hours to survive.
Peter impatiently arranges for the rescue attempt, quickly assembling a
diverse team of volunteers who have little chance of succeeding, but
sign on for the glory, or their concern for the victims, or for the
money offered. The Pakistani Army helps out by supplying the six
rescuers with cannisters of nitroglycerin, an homage to "Wages of Fear."
The rescuers will try to blast the victims out of the cavern, but must
be very careful when climbing because with just one spill of the
explosive liquid there is the certainty of a tremendous explosion. There
will be many tremendous explosions that rock the Himalayas, and -- if
mountains repeatedly exploding and climbers falling down mountain peaks
in colorful ways is your idea of enjoyment, then this is the film for
you.
The rescue crew includes one of the world's beautiful supermodels, who
in this film happens to be a medic and an expert climber Monique
(Izabella Scorupco); a Muslim practitioner, the Pakistani porter Kareem
(Alexander Siddig); the comically insane Aussie brothers Cyril and
Malcolm Bench (Steve Le Marquand, Ben Mendelsohn); and, the leader of
the crew, a hard-assed master mountain climber who became a hermit and
for the last few years stopped everything to search only for his wife
who never returned from Elliot's last tragic expedition to K2,
Montgomery Wick (Scott Glenn). The craggy-faced Wick is bent on revenge
against Elliot, blaming him for his tour guide wife's death. He's also a
friend of Peter's father, and what goes for wisdom in this picture,
comes from his rugged lips.
The action keeps coming, the clichés get resolved somehow, and even
though the action sequences couldn't possibly be real, the great
photography and beautiful vistas made the locations seem out of this
world. The filmmaker used the Southern Alps in New Zealand as his
setting, and you could have fooled me, because it sure looked like the
Himalayas. It also looked like it could be a long commercial for
beautiful yuppie adventurers who are shooting an ad for Club Med, or a
National Geographic TV special, or even one of those action thrillers
that doesn't believe it needs good dialogue to tell its heroic fantasy
story.

By all rights, I shouldn't have liked VERTICAL LIMIT.  After all, Action
Flicks usually aren't my thing, especially mindless (or, in the case of
this movie, overly-earnest almost to the point of unbelievability)
Action Flicks.  So it came as a shock to me when I realized that not
only did I like this movie, I was thrilled, and even *surprised*, by it.
I reckon this was one of those times when you just had to sit back and
enjoy the ride.  And boy, whadda ride...
The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Our Earnest Young Hero, mountain-climber Peter Garrett (Chris O'Donnell)
is estranged from his fellow mountain-climbing sister Annie (Robin
Tunney) after a tragic accident involving their father (Stuart Wilson)
leaves Peter not ever wanting to climb again.  Peter learns that Annie
has joined the climbing crew of mega-billionaire Elliot Vaughn (Bill
Paxton), an eccentric adventurer who's using the planned climb up the
Really Big Mountain called "K2" as a publicity stunt coinciding with the
inaugural flight of his Majestic Airlines [Richard Branson...calling
Virgin Airlines' Richard Branson...]
Of course, Vaughn, an Evil Megalomaniac in disguise, has a Secret, one
which involves the Wizened Mystic climber Montgomery Wick (Scott Glenn),
who has plans of his own for the Evil Megalomaniac once Wick finds out
that Vaughn plans to go up K2 with a climbing team, led by Best Damn
Climber Tom McLaren (Nicholas Lea).
But when something goes Terribly Wrong with the climb, Earnest Peter
insists on rescuing his now-Damsel In Distress sister and company,
enlisting the aide of Wizened Mystic Wick, Comic Relief Aussie Dudes
Malcolm and Cyril (sorry; I can't find their credits listed *anywhere*),
Sensitive And Prayerful Guide Kareem (Alexander Siddig), and Medic
climber (and Peter's potential Warm Place To Put It) Monique Aubertine
(Izabella Scorupco).
Don't be fooled though: despite what the credits say, Chris O'Donnell
isn't really the star of this show.  No, the *real* focal point of this
flick is the mountain itself; K2, in all its treacherous glory, was far
and away the big kahuna here.
The Upshot:
If my rampant capitalization of those characterizations make me seem
cynical about all the Types that make up the characters of VERTICAL
LIMIT, it's because my genuine liking of this flick really surprised me.
In my book, there's little about the mix of an Earnest Young Hero, a
Damsel In Distress, an Evil Megalomaniac, an Wizened Mystic, etc., that
should Do It for me.  But yet, it did; *they* did.  Or, perhaps more
correctly, the mixologists - director Martin Campbell and
cinematographer David Tattersall - thrilled me with Gee Whiz action
shots galore.
The audience never had time to fret over the relatively-transparent
plotline, because whenever there was a moment to sit there and think
"hey, waaaait a minute...", **BOOM**! you're hit with something new
comin' 'round the mountain.  This kind of plotting couldn't hold the
movie up by itself - there's only so much Thrilling Action one can take,
even as good as "Limit"'s Thrilling Action was.  Fortunately for
VERTICAL LIMIT, a few of its characters - namely Bill Paxton's Vaughn,
the surprisingly well-used (and no, not That Way) Monique, and humorous
brother climbers Malcolm and Cyril - added a whiff of credible storyline
to the action surrounding them.
There are brief subplots involving the Pakistani army (as a
plothole-filled excuse to use devices which go **BOOM** way easily) and
one character's great need for Revenge, both of which strain the
viewer's ability to suspend disbelief just up to the point where Big!
Action! comes into play again.  I was able to work around it; some
viewers may not be able to do so.
VERTICAL LIMIT is one of those rare Action Flicks that overcomes (if not
transcends) the genre in which it resides; it maintains its high
excitement level throughout, keeps the viewer guessing about what comes
next, and even lets its supporting characters have more interesting bits
than the so-called stars have.  If only for its potentially big
surround-sound thump, VERTICAL LIMIT is most def on my "can't wait till
it's on DVD" list.
Bammer's Bottom Line:
"Story?  We don' need no steenkin' story!"  Seriously, though, VERTICAL
LIMIT was a helluva rollercoaster ride, from beginning to end; truly a
thrill a minute. If you don't mind a see-through plotline and story
resolution you can predict from a mile away, VERTICAL LIMIT is the
Action Flick to catch this season.
VERTICAL LIMIT (rating: greenlight):
Don't worry: I won't end this with a lame "Eagles" punchline.  I'll
leave that one to the movie.

Hanging from a cliff in Monument valley, Chris O'Donnell and Robin 
Tunney sing "Take it to the limit one more time." It's a breath-taking 
scene - so bring plenty of breath with you. In the beat of an eye, slip 
of the foot, snap of a rope, these siblings meet up again halfway around 
the world in the Pakistani Himalayas. Dessert to snowcaps, this film 
takes climbing to the extremes. 
And therein lies the anchor of the film, not just big climbing, but big 
climbing slips, slides and falls. At precisely these times when expert 
climbers lose their grip, the film becomes ... well, most gripping. The 
plot, clichČ motivations and complications are just rote steps strollin' 
up a mountain. 
The dialogue, like the film itself, is plagued by peaks and valleys. At 
one moment a sharp satirical line gets the crowd laughing, the next 
moment, a serious line ... well, gets the crowd laughing (if you know 
what I mean). And though I liked the international assemblage of 
climbers, the wind and less than perfect sound quality conspired to make 
still other lines difficult to understand. 
Visually, the film is mostly tight. Besides the excellent special 
effects, there's a fantastic shot of two young leopards play-fighting in 
the snow. Unfortunately, focus problems irritate other images throughout 
the production. 
Because the story plays second fiddle to the action, scenes that should 
be touching ... really aren't. In fact, the most endearing characters 
are a couple of secondary goofballs -- sort of the Beavis and Butthead 
or Trapper and Hawkeye of the Himalayas. 
Whelp then, to summit up, though some of the action sequences are a bit 
"over the edge," they're great fun to watch. If you're not in the mood 
for compelling drama and just want to enjoy a bumpy ride - take yourself 
to the "Vertical Limit."

_Vertical_Limit_ (PG-13) * 1/2 (out of ****)
With its dizzying depictions of courageous derring-do atop rugged
mountain peaks and perilously close to steep cliffs, the trailer to
Columbia's _Vertical_Limit_ has been leaving many a moviegoer
breathless... much like the teaser to the same studio's mountain climbing
actioner of seven years ago, _Cliffhanger_.  That's where the
similarities end.  _Cliffhanger_ was by no means a great film, but it was
an exciting thrill ride with no pretense whatsoever as to what it is and
what it should be.  The fact that the stars of _Vertical_Limit_ have gone
on record to say that they were attracted to the "relationships" in the
piece explains exactly how this film goes wrong--that and the name "Chris
O'Donnell" toplining the cast credits.
As displayed in _GoldenEye_ and _The_Mask_of_Zorro_, director Martin
Campbell knows how to stage a suspenseful action scene, and the action
sequences in _Vertical_Limit_ confirm his talent.  The first scene, in
which three climbers are left dangling on a single thin, quickly
unraveling cord, more than recalls the memorable open of _Cliffhanger_
and holds up fairly well in comparison.  In a later scene, a climber
makes a deadly slide down a snowy slope, narrowly avoiding a plunge off
of a cliff thanks to a fortuitously timed swing of a pickaxe.  Other
scenes involving the danger that can only come when you combine snow,
mountainous terrain, and canisters of nitroglycerin also generate
palpable, nail-biting tension.
The problem is that the visceral shocks are in the service of a script
that actually includes the stultifying line "There's not gonna be just
snow--there'll be ice and rock."  Those "relationships" that so enamored
the actors?  Number one: Peter Garrett (O'Donnell) and his sister, Annie
(Robin Tunney).  Following in the footsteps of their father, Annie is a
famous mountain climber; Peter was also a skilled in the activity, but he
gave it up following the incident that led to their father's death.  When
Annie and cohorts Tom McLaren (Nicholas Lea) and wealthy adventure-seeker
Elliot Vaughn (Bill Paxton) end up trapped in a crevasse while attempting
to scale K2, Peter must put his guilt and self-doubt aside and try to
rescue them.  Number two: Vaughn and Montgomery Wick (Scott Glenn).  Wick
is a mysterious mountain-dwelling loner who bears a grudge against Vaughn
for reasons initially unknown; he joins Peter's rescue teamin hopes of
getting a chance to settle the score.  As if these relationships weren't
hackneyed enough (and to fulfill some unwritten requirement for
"romance"), there's the out-of-nowhere attraction that develops between
Peter and the fetching French-Canadian nurse (_GoldenEye_'s "good" Bond
girl, Izabella Scorupco) who tags along for the mission.
All the overplayed and underthought melodrama is rendered even more
ludicrous by the overly earnest cast.  Not even Glenn, sporting dirty,
stringy locks and one toeless foot, seems to have a grasp on how
ridiculous his character or the entire affair is.  Whether or not that
latter fact is lost on O'Donnell is anyone's guess.  One has to wonder
why Hollywood continues to cast this stiff block of boredom in headlining
roles; to call him "vanilla" is to give that savory flavor an undeserved
bad name.  His lazy, inexpressive performance here should prove to the
suits once and for all that this walking, talking rice cake incarnate
does not have what it takes to become a major star.  Similarly,
_Vertical_Limit_ overall does not have what it takes to deserve major
holiday hit status.
