Whilst sitting through DEEP RISING, I began to wonder why I was feeling
so very comfortable on my cinema seat? Shouldn't I be on the edge,
feeling terrified or at least thrilled at the notion of a sea monster
devouring a ship full of passengers?
Then I realised that everyone in this nobody' cast, was trying to be
either too smug or funny for my liking. Even in death, they seemed at
ease. Hardly, befitting men about to become monster chomp for members of
the squid family! Once this path is travelled, it is hard to recapture
the apical beat of growing suspense ie ALIENS, with too many lapses in
concentration to be able to sustain this thriller.
The passengers disappear before the terrorists board the ship. The
monster then decides to play peek-a-boo' for a while, before
conveniently sucking the juices out of the baddies, leaving most of the
good guys intact. Full marks for an interesting computer generated
tentacle, but rather too reminiscent of the man eating plants from the
musical comedy, THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS. After this comparison how
can one take these tentacle-like-creatures seriously? So I just waited
out the end of this formulaic movie, with a regular pulse rate of sixty,
three yawns and a toilet break.
It is likely that the special effects department devoured a large chunk
of the budget, so it is not surprising that a relatively unknown cast
was hired. Then again, nobody famous would have signed on anyway. So the
solution to the problem, was simply to employ a Mel Gibson look-alike,
Indiana Jones wannabe hero (Trent Williams), and a Julia Roberts
identical (Famke Janssen). Both of whom, are overly cute with their
performance, and it is quite evident from their perky behaviour, that
they will not end up in the monster's belly.
An overly disappointing effort overall.

     Here's something to chew on:  what's the favorite food of big, 
cheesy-looking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the 
bowels of a luxury liner in DEEP RISING?  The obvious answer to this 
question is cardboard, because that's the depth of the most fully-
developed character in this painfully generic creature feature.  DEEP 
RISING demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something 
scripted by a computer.  In fact, considering the rigid adherence to the 
expected formulas, perhaps it was.
     The most astonishing thing about DEEP RISING is the exceptionally 
high level of gore.  Not since STARSHIP TROOPERS have this many chunks 
of flesh (both human and non-human) been scattered in all directions.  
We learn some bloody trivia, as well, such as how a sea monster 
spraypaints in red (it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied 
remains) and what it does with half-digested leftovers.  I suppose DEEP 
RISING's gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who 
love the macabre, but it doesn't do much for me.  
     On the surface, and that's about the only level at which this film 
can be analyzed, DEEP RISING feels like TREMORS grafted onto TITANIC 
(everyone else is citing the equally valid ALIENS/TITANIC connection, 
since James Cameron directed both).  In going for the big disaster angle 
of TITANIC and the tongue-in-cheek mayhem of TREMORS, DEEP RISING 
somehow misses both marks by a wide margin.  The film is not humorous, 
tense, or exciting.  In fact, it's downright boring, and, despite being 
half the length of Cameron's current box-office champ, DEEP RISING feels 
like the longer movie.
     Is it really necessary to say anything about the plot?  Probably 
not, since it's easy to guess, but I'll go ahead and oblige anyone who 
wants a synopsis.  The film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad 
guys on board a mercenary ship.  In addition to the usual cast of 
psychopaths and lunatics, there's Finnegan (Treat Williams), the boat's 
pilot, who's supposed to be an Indiana Jones knockoff; Joey (Kevin J. 
O'Connor), the inept sidekick who's supposed to be lovable and funny 
(but is really just irritating); and Hanover (Wes Studi), the 
"mastermind" (and I use that term lightly) of the operation.  Their 
goal:  attack a cruise ship, clean out the safe, then sink it using some 
illegally-acquired torpedoes.  The problem is, by the time they reach 
the Argonautica, the Titanic-like luxury liner has turned into the Marie 
Celeste.  Aside from a beautiful jewel thief (Famke Janssen) and a 
couple of crew members, there's no one on board.  The reason soon 
becomes obvious -- the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect 
that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight 
tentacles.
     The cast, which is led by Treat Williams, is primarily comprised of 
has-beens and probably-never-will-bes (two exceptions: Wes Studi, best 
known as the villain in THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS, and Djimon Hounsou, 
AMISTAD's Cinque).  Williams, once a "can't miss" prospect in Hollywood, 
has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for a 
lead role is a film like DEEP RISING, and his inability to create a 
charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his 
sputtering career.  Famke Janssen, who will forever be known as Xenia 
Onatopp from GOLDENEYE, is the perfect bland match for Williams.  Given 
her limited acting abilities, it's likely that she was chosen for this 
part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes.  Unfortunately, 
a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet tee-shirt for half of 
the picture.  Meanwhile, Kevin J. O'Connor, who has entirely too much 
screen time, exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a 
blackboard.
     These days, audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with 
computer-generated special effects.  This is a lesson that 
writer/director Stephen Sommers (who previously helmed the live-action 
JUNGLE BOOK) needs to learn.  The days of JURASSIC PARK, when viewers 
were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and 
imposing on screen, are past.  Now, movie-goers are looking for the 
sophistication of TITANIC -- visuals that are so well-incorporated that 
it's impossible to tell where they end and where "reality" begins.  In 
DEEP RISING, the monster, like everything, is artificial and 
unconvincing.  
     Unfortunately, the fundamental problem audiences are faced with 
here isn't so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture, but 
the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre (although, to be fair, 
DEEP RISING is a particularly bad entry).  Even once this film has sunk 
out of sight, the knowledgeable viewer knows it won't be the last of its 
kind.  Like the slimy, slithering things that inhabit the air vents and 
pipes of these movies, more are waiting just around the corner in 
ambush.  And that consideration, unlike anything on screen, is truly 
horrifying.

"No art passes our conscience in the way film does, and goes directly to our
feelings, deep down into the dark rooms of our souls"

If you're the kind of person who goes to see movies just because you
long for some of that overpriced theatre popcorn (butter optional),
then this is the movie for you!  Indeed, this has got to be either one
of the most unimaginative rip-offs of other recent action movies, or
an incredibly unfunny spoof of them.  It's difficult to fathom such
insipidness unless you actually watch this film.  But at least we're
warned very quickly that we may regret our ticket purchase, giving us
an opportunity to sneak on out and into the adjacent show.
What are the four ingredients of a really bad action movie?  First,
the movie gives us an introductory premise.  Huge caverns exist deep
beneath the ocean floor, and in this area, many ships have
disappeared.  Oooh...scary!  Secondly, a cheesy soundtrack tries to
connote a tone of mystery, but only succeeds in drowning our ears with
an abrasive musical score.  Third, the main character is a mercenary
that delivers goods without asking about the contents of his cargo
(Treat Williams).  He operates a sophisticated military-style PT boat
and every word that comes out of his mouth is awash in comical
flippancy.  Finally, in the cargo hold, we see those that hired him.
They are also mercenaries that have tough-looking haircuts, talk with
accents, and try to show how macho they are.
During their trip across the stormy sea, their boat suffers an
incident and requires repairs.  Spotting a cruise ship in the
distance, they make their way to the ocean liner and devise a plan to
raid the machine shop, take the parts that they need, and then
continue on their merry way.  Little do they know that this cruise
ship has become infested by some kind of ocean monster.  Yet, they
board the ship armed to the hilt with grenades and machine guns that
can kill dozens in a matter of seconds.
This is nothing more than a by-the-book action film.  Their
realization of the situation that they're in doesn't happen until they
are in the bowels of the boat.  Those who are dumb enough to stray off
on their own will ultimately get killed.  The corridors on the ship
are narrow, misty, and provide the kind of atmosphere that all
scare-fests must have. Yet, despite the predictable nature of this
film, there are some scary "boo" moments.  But most of it is just
outright silly.  And this film is unusually gory too.  Monsters
basically suck off the flesh and spit out skeletal remains.  There is
one particularly neat scene where a monster has been cut apart and
reveals a victim that is still alive.  He screams horribly as the
monster's digestive juices continue to slowly eat him away.
Additionally, it borrows heavily from Speed2, Alien and a bunch of
other recent films.  The mercenaries even run into a lone, surviving
passenger (Femke Jannsen) who looks amazingly like Sandra Bullock.
To be honest, when I left the theatre, I just had to laugh at how
witless the film was.  It's moronic fun at best.  So, if you're
hankering for a large bucket of popcorn served with a side of
silliness, then this might just hit the spot.

Deep Rising is a B-movie stuck in an A-movie body. Director Stephen Sommers
(Jungle Book) is able to keep the campiness high and not take the film too
seriously, which keeps the film from falling flat on its face.
Imagine a film about a large luxury boat sinking with thousands dead or
dying.  No, this is not Titanic.  Nor does this film have any of the great
characteristics that made Titanic so wonderful. Missing are the characters
that we can latch onto or the plot to completely pull you into the film.
A group of heavily armed mercenaries is about to over take this huge luxury
boat, The Argonaut.  When they arrive and board the ship, they find that
the ship is empty and very bloody.  Not one soul can be found, not even a
corpse.
The mercenaries, led by Hanover (Wes Studi), are taken out to the luxury
ship by Finnegan (Treat Williams).  Aboard the ship, untouched by whatever
got to everyone else, is a beautiful jewel thief, Trillian (Famke Janssen).
As the mercenaries, along with Finnegan and crew, search out the ship, they
soon run into Trillian.  Together they find that there is something
horrible aboard the ship.
About halfway through the film we are introduced to the horror that is on
the ship.  It comes in the form of an octopus-like creature that ravaged
the ship and its passengers. Now, do not imagine a common octopus that you
might see at the local aquarium.  This creature is huge and it is hungry.
How does the creature terrorize these people?  Think tentacles.  Think jaws
on tentacles. Think speed and deadly aim. That's how this creature
terrorizes the main characters.
Deep Rising is not a horrible movie but at points it's a painful movie.
What is most painful about the movie?  Kevin J. O'Connor.  His character,
Joey (Finnegan's ship mechanic), is written as the comic relief of the film
but serves as the opposite.  Every time he was on screen I kept mentally
cheering, "Die, Joey!  Die!"  Part of what makes him so annoying is his
voice and the other is the horrible lines that he gets. His screen time is
as enjoyable as chewing aluminum foil.
I'm happy to say that everyone else fares a bit better in the film,
especially Treat Williams and Framke Janssen.  Both suffer from bad
dialogue, but as a whole, their reputation comes out somewhat unscathed.
It's nice to see Famke Janssen again; she was introduced to us in GoldenEye
as a bad Bond girl. One face that might stand out is Djimon Hounsou's, one
of the mercenaries.  It's disappointing to see Hounsou in such a mediocre
and short role after seeing his wonderful performance in Amistad.
The music by Jerry Goldsmith is forgettable.  At times, the score seems
overly campy, which fits the movie just right.  Then there are times when
the score is too serious and falls out of place.
The special effects are admirable.  The creature is scary enough, but
director Sommers does not use it to its full potential.  One special effect
that disappointed was "the fireball." When is Hollywood going to learn that
it is impossible to outrun an exploding fireball?
Deep Rising's saving grace is that it doesn't take itself too seriously.
>From its campy script to its over-the-top action and its cool looking
creature, Deep Rising is a blast if you don't walk into the theatre
expecting too much.  If you want to have some mindless fun, catch Deep
Rising in the theatres.

Let's remember what movies were primarily made for.  Entertainment.  
That remembered, does Deep Rising succeed?
For those of you who don't know the plot, I'll paraphrase something I
read.  Pirates, Sea monster, you figure it out.  Have we seen all of this
before?  Done Better?  Well, yeah, but who cares?  This movie is a fun
ride that resembles a carnival haunted house.  A group of disposable
people run, swim and run some more from tentacles with teeth.  They have
guns that never run out of ammo (Cool!).  Some of the action sequences
are quite innovative actually.  There are even a few laughs in here
(especially that final shot).  The actors aren't taking themselves or
the movie seriously, so why should we?
If you're a Sam Raimi fan, you'll probably have a good time here.  I kept
waiting for the Treat Williams character to say "Groovy."

Ingredients: 
Giant growling octopus creature that attacks a luxury ship, small band
of armed travelers which includes elegant lady jewel thief and whiny
mechanic
Synopsis:
In the story, Finnegan (Treat Williams) is the driver of a rinkydink
boat and Joey is his whiny mechanic pal. Finnegan and Joey get captured
by well-armed DIEHARD-type commandos who plan to hijack and loot a big
cruise ship. The hijackers force Finnegan and Joey to boat them over to
the luxury liner, but in the process the little boat gets broken. And to
make matters worse, when they reach the cruise ship they find that
nearly all the passengers aboard the cruise ship have been devoured by a
nasty giant octopus that has mutant tentacles that have jaws on the tips
that open up to reveal smaller tentacles with more jaws that open up to
reveal even smaller tentacles with even smaller jaws! But not everyone's
dead. A beautiful jewel thief (Famke Janssen ) and the captain of the
ship (Anthony Heald ) also manage to crawl out of their hiding places in
the luxury liner to hook up with Finnegan and the hijackers. Now if they
can just beat the octopus and get out of there.
Taking a page from the ALIENS (1986) formula, the band of armed
passengers wages a running battle against the big sea beast as it lurks
in piping and ducts - - and picks off the hijackers one by one at
appropriate moments. Will Finnegan and friends be able to get to the jet
skis that conveniently happen to be stored on this cruise boat in order
to escape?
Opinion: 
What happens when you combine SCOOBY DOO characters (minus Scooby) with
a TITANIC ship and monsters the size of ALIENS and JURASSIC PARK? Then
you get DEEP RISING, an action spoof where a whiny pessimist, a pretty
lady, and a square-jawed young leader cross paths with a corrupt sea
captain and a giant octopus creature aboard a smashed luxury liner
overflowing with water. But right away you can tell it's not a serious
movie from the dialogue. When one of the panting characters barely
survives an octopus attack, he asks, "Do you just GET asthma, or do you
have to be born with it?" And as in SCOOBY DOO, the corrupt captain
would have gotten away with his plot, too, if it weren't for those
interfering young people. You've seen all the action scenes before in
other movies, but what they hey, it's a spoof.
Star Trivia:
Famke Janssen is a former James Bond girl and Dutch supermodel who is
said to wear size eleven shoes. Wes Studi is a Cherokee Indian who
played the bad Mohawk Magua in LAST OF THE MOHICANS. Djimon Hounsou is a
West African male model who played Cinque in AMISTAD, but in this movie
he's one of the mercenary bad guys.

I can't imagine what's wrong with my fellow reviewers. Here' the most
entertaining, best put together action film of the last 12 months, and they
trash it. It may be that they were expecting to find Sir Lawrence Olivier
or that they came in yearning for a transcendental experience. Well, to the
gentle readers who go to the movies looking for solid entertainment let it
not be said that in this here newsgroup an encouraging word will not be
heard. 
Deep Rising is everything that a full budget
action/adventure/monster/disaster movie should be: an elaborate production,
superb cinematography, flawless casting, very good acting and above all,
that sensitive element in which even Titanic failed and Speed 2 crashed and
sank: pacing. The pace and rhythm of the action is the one critical element
that most often makes or breaks a disaster movie. There is in disaster
movies a point at which "sustained hectic" starts to yield diminishing
benefits quickly followed by negative returns. Titanic transgressed the
line, but not to the egregious degree of Speed 2. Deep Rising achieves near
perfection in this respect. Hectic situations are resolved before they get
boring and the gore is briefly seen but not flaunted. The premise is
internally consistent and the monster will satisfy your expectations. 
The characters are one dimensional, perhaps as they should be and who
cares, if the acting is good? (Not at all a contradiction.) And anyway,
Treat Williams does wander into another dimension as you might expect from
such a fine actor. Famke Johnson is a Sandra Bullock look-alike with talent
to match. Kevin O'Connor fine tunes his character with inconspicuous
virtuosity.
That this level of intelligent, thoughtful moviemaking should get trashed
by would-be critics is beyond forgivable. So the dialog is deliberately
simple and direct; it is not Hamlet. All in all it the most satisfactory
flick of its genre to come by in many a month and perhaps in years, the
Alien series not excluded. Don't let my praise raise your expectations to
the level of a great film; it does not try to be that. It tries to be a
satisfying action and adventure film, and it succeeds splendidly. I
recommend it highly. 3 ˝ stars out of 5.

Screenplay: Stephen Sommers 
"Deep Rising" gives you that sinking feeling both literally and figuratively: Not 
only does the movie take place on a cruise ship slowly being immersed into the 
middle of the ocean by a squid-like menace, but the unfolding story is artificial, 
silly and almost completely derivative of countless other (and, for the most part, 
better) films. While dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures -- 
take, for example, the schlocky mountain highs of last spring's "Anaconda" -- "Deep 
Rising" has no tongue to put in its cheek. Folks, we're only a month into the new 
year, and already here's a candidate for one of its stinkiest releases. 
Most of the action takes place on the Argonautica, a luxury liner in the middle of 
its maiden voyage (uh-oh -- if these people had seen "Titanic," then maybe they'd 
have known to stay home) when it's attacked by a giant, tentacled sea creature . The
only survivors are slinky jewel thief Trilian (Famke Janssen), Argonautica owner 
Canton (Anthony Heald) and a few other crew members. A mercenary team, lead by 
resourceful captain John Finnegan (Treat Williams), board the Argonautica looking 
for assistance after their own boat breaks down nearby. But what their search of the 
ship uncovers is something blood-soaked, hungry and not very helpful. 
The main problem with "Deep Rising" is its overt familiarity; the movie makes 
absolutely no attempt to differentiate itself from most sci-fi/horror films in 
recent memory. The concept is "Leviathan" meets "Titanic," with a dash of "Speed 2" 
thrown in for good (or is that bad?) measure. This monster is equal parts "20,000 
Leagues Under the Sea" and "The Relic," knows how to open doors like the Raptors 
from "Jurassic Park" and even gets to expel a half-digested victim (a neat effect, 
admittedly) a la the giant snake in "Anaconda." Some of the attack sequences are 
straight out of "Jaws" and "Alien." A scene where the remaining survivors have to 
travel under water to escape death is right out of "Alien Resurrection." There's 
even a jet ski chase like "Hard Rain." And the list goes on. 
Watching "Deep Rising"'s cast battle the beast is a murky chore in itself, because 
none of them have well-developed characters, nor do they seem to project even the 
slightest sense of fear when facing their enemy. Williams is affable enough, but his 
Finnegan just isn't believable. An interesting supporting cast is thoroughly wasted; 
pretty Famke Janssen, best known as "GoldenEye"'s killer thighs, is trapped in a 
forced romantic interest with Williams, while Kevin J. O'Connor, as Finnegan's 
mechanic, provides comic relief with screechy manic shtick that gets old fast. 
Djimon Honsou, who received raves for his performance as a noble slave in December's 
"Amistad," pops up in a brief part. He needs to stay away from the water. 
The movie's final shot is a groaner, as is the 11th-hour regurgitation of a subplot 
involving an on-ship saboteur. As if a cast deserving of their snack food-fate isn't 
bad enough (when you taunt the monster, you're really asking for it), "Deep Rising" 
is a slow, stupid slog through a story without a single bright spot. And since we 
all know that the higher the casualty rate is, the closer we are to the end of the 
movie, rooting for this overgrown squid to swallow the whole ship isn't out of the 
question.

Rated R: Language, violence
by Nathaniel R. Atcheson (nate@pyramid.net)
    When I first saw the trailer for Deep Rising, I rolled my eyes
because I could see, just from the quick scenes depicted in the preview,
that the film would be a genuinely thorough Alien rip-off with some
nifty special effects. I expected a boring, ho-hum film showcasing bad
acting and silly characters who go into contrived and non-scary
situations only to serve as cannon fodder to a giant tentacled monster.
    But it only took me two minutes to realize that writer/director
Stephen Sommers knows exactly what he's doing. Here is a film that
consciously rips off most of its ancestors (from Alien all the way up to
recent siblings like Anaconda); what makes it such a blast, why I
enjoyed every bit of it, is the simple fact that it makes fun of itself
and its own genre. The acting is great, the characters are interesting
(better than cannon fodder), the humor is fresh and funnier than in most
comedies, the violence is ridiculously graphic and gory, and the film is
just plain fun.
    Treat Williams plays John Finnegan, a boat-operator who, in the
beginning of the film, is taking a group of shady individuals (led by
Wes Studi) to do something that he knows nothing about (his business
motto is "If the cash is there, we do not care"). When John's engine man
Joey (Kevin J. O'Connor) goes snooping around and finds a bunch of
missiles, the bad guys make it clear that they are actually en route to
sink a cruise ship. As it turns out, the owner of the cruise ship, Nigel
Carlton (Anthony Heald), isn't making enough money, so they're going to
loot the ship and sink it so he can live off the insurance.
    Sounds easy enough, until some kind of enormous mutant
creature--with seemingly endless numbers of tentacles all of infinite
length--attacks the cruise ship and destroys everyone on board. At this
point, it is up to our heroes to save the day, not only against the
human bad guys, but from the water bad guys as well.
    Sure, we've seen all this before. You'll find very few of the scare
tactics in this film new. Some of the scenes will even remind you of
films you might have just seen (the jet ski sequences are just like the
ones in Hard Rain). This isn't to say that the film is totally useless
as a horror flick--Sommers dumps the violence and gore on the audience.
The action, too, is really exciting. Scenes towards the end of the film
in which the tentacles come racing down corridors at high speeds are
just a few of the numerous fun-filled moments that Deep Rising has to
offer. Nor does the film feel low-budget and campy--the creature, though
clearly digital, looks professional; and the cruise liner, shot only at
dark and in the rain (not every film can look like Titanic) is at least
convincing for the few seconds that we get to see it. Overall, the
visual presentation of Deep Rising is pretty standard, but good
nonetheless.
    But that's not why I like this movie. The heart of my enjoyment lies
in the characters, who are surprisingly well-drawn and interesting.
Williams is terrific in the main role; he has a kind of passive
aggressive attitude towards everything, but he's so likable and
appealing that I was rooting for him from the start. O'Connor, however,
has all the funniest lines in the film. (He turns to someone, wheezing,
and says, "Can you, like, *get* asthma?") Not only is he funny, but he's
well-written as a character, which is unheard of in a film like this.
    The bad guys too, though there are a few too many (most of them
truly are cannon fodder), are all at least given some sort of identity,
whether it be different accents or sexual habits. Several of the actors
stand out among the crowd, including Anthony Heald, Wes Studi, Famke
Janssen (who plays an interesting pick-pocket thief), and Djimon Hounsou
(who some viewers might remember as Cinque in Amistad).
    I just love totally silly movies like this. Sommers is a sharp
director--he wanted to make a creature flick, but instead of trying to
go serious and disturbing, he made this hilarious and wild film that
looks at itself and laughs. I couldn't have imagined laughing at a film
in which I see a room full of thousands of mutilated humans, corridors
splattered with guts and blood and skin, and live people with only
half-heads screaming post-mortem, but now I've seen one. Deep Rising
isn't for the faint of heart, but it is for those who are tired of the
same old horror film garbage.

This becomes the catch-phrase for John Finnegan in DEEP RISING, a movie
that starts off like kinda like SPEED 2, turns into a poor rip-off of
ALIENS/ALIEN RESURRECTION, and in the last 15 minutes, actually becomes
semi-original, leading up to a final ten seconds (yes, SECONDS) of film
before the credits roll that I think are gonna be pretty memorable for
me.  
Okay.  There's a cruise ship that's attacked by a big beast thing.  And
there's this group of bandits on their way to do... something (but we're
not supposed to know what) to said cruise ship.  Of course, when they
get there, they find the place mostly devoid of people, and why?  Some
kind of big squid thing, of course.  Add to that the fact that their own
boat is too damaged to be seaworthy, and you've got yourself an ALIEN
movie ripoff.
And what a ripoff it is!  I mean, they seem to try to take the
underwater scene from ALIEN RESURRECTION, make it as devoid of momentum
as possible, and slap the remainder of the copy into this movie. 
There's even a scene where exact dialogue from ALIENS is slapped into
the show just for kicks.  Yes, exact lines.  It's annoying on some
level, but wait a second...
...is this a spoof?  With such intentional ripoff signs, and the fact
that this movie sure as hell isn't scary at all, floating around in the
mist, I'd be inclined to say... maybe.  If so, and if viewed as such,
this is a funny flick.  Only bout **1/2 to *** star level, though,
because it doesn't quite take it far enough.  But it's still a good
satire.  But if viewed as another one of these traditional
monster-in-enclosed-space flicks, then, it ain't that hot.  *1/2 star
kinda movie.
Either way, the acting is alright (Treat Williams is always a likable
guy, and O'Connor is loads of fun, too), the evil CGI tentacles look
cool (but the big head thing didn't quite measure up), and the final
chase scene is actually worthy of... well, a better movie.
For me, the final moment of the film was just hilarious.  The rest of
the audience didn't seem to think so.  But for me, those final seconds
add about another 1/2 star to this baby.  I won't forget those ten
seconds anytime soon.
Overall, what do I give this, this exercise in
what-kind-of-movie-am-I-watching?  Well, I'm going to go ahead and give
it a medium rating of **1/2.  You'll have the most fun if your view as a
spoof of the ALIEN movies and their numerous ripoffs rather than a
serious monster flick.  But you'd certainly still be better off heading
down to the dollar theater to check out ALIEN RESURRECTION again, or
shelling out the bucks for another three glorious hours of TITANIC. 
Still, if you're in the mood for something else, sit back and... well,
just look at those darn cool tentacles.  Wait, there's a mouth inside of
another mouth on that thing there... uh... where have I seen that
before?

Imagine "Alien" invading "Titanic" . . . If you think this
might be a fun or interesting combination, "Deep
Rising" will be just your type of film. While it offers
nothing new plotwise, the visual effects are truly
stunning, and the action is nonstop.
There is really nothing to the story of "Deep Rising"
that hasn't been told before. Just like in "Alien," some
people are stuck in a remote location with a seemingly
invincible monster that's picking them off one by one.
As for comparing it to "Titanic," the only similarity is
that the events occur on a really big cruise-ship.
The story begins as the newest and most
state-of-the-art cruise ship sets sail on the South China
Sea. When a traitor from among the crew shuts off all
power, the ship loses its communication systems and
starts floating helplessly on the South China Sea.
Unfortunately for the passengers, the ship stalls right
above the location that is home to a bored sea monster
that needs a new toy.
Shortly after the attack by the sea monster, a band of
gunrunners with the intention of hijacking the ship
arrive on board to find that only three people have
survived the slaughter: the captain (Derrick O'Connor),
the ship's owner (Anthony Heald), and a con woman
named Trillian (Famke Janssen) who was locked up in
the galley because she had tried to rob the vault.
The antagonism between the stereotypical macho
males stranded on the cruise ship is fun to watch; not
only must they all try to survive the monster, but they
must also survive their trigger-happy companions. The
developing love story between tough guy Finnegan
(Treat Williams) and Trillian, the woman who tries to
act as tough as her male counterparts, is perhaps the
most tired part of the film.
Thanks to the spectacular visual effects, "Deep Rising"
rises far above mediocrity. The monster is elaborately
developed and its victims are portrayed in gory detail.
The director wasn't shy about showing the monster in
all its glory, another indication that this film relies on
strong visuals rather than suggestion to frighten its
audience.
In a superb scene, Trillian and Finnigan race a wave
runner through the ship's narrow passages, trying to
escape the clutches of the monster.
While "Deep Rising" relies on a somewhat tired
storyline, the visuals are so exciting that its few
shortcomings did not really matter.

  Deep Rising is one of those unoriginal, insipid movies that,when you
watch it, inspires delusions that you, too, can write a movie.
  A tip: If you try, be assured someone will visit you and break your hands
before you are finished with the first act.
  Heck, a chimp could have written Deep Rising. The movie is more an
amalgram of cliches and sequences lifted from other films. (The hero even
gets to say, "I got a bad feeling about this.")
 The story revolves around a charter-boat captain, a team of modern-day
pirates, a luxury liner and some giant creepy crawlies that suck all the
liquid out of people and "excrete their skeletal remains," as one character
so aptly puts it.
 Treat Williams (remember when he was a serious actor) plays Finnigan, the
charter-boat skipper who will take any fare without any questions.
 Williams, and the rest of the cast, run through their paces, yelling their
lines, most of which consist of variations of, "We gotta get outta here."
 Kevin J. O'Connor as Williams' engineer plays a variation on Bill Paxton's
whiny Marine in Aliens, except he is more shrill and obnoxious - as well as
the comedy r
relief.
 The special effects look cheap. As movie technology improves, it is
getting easier and easier to separate bad computer effects from good, and
these are at the low end of the scale.
 And, to try to create suspense, that old dodge of showing the beasties in
shadows and quick-cut edits is employed. Another tiresome cliche.
 An overblown, over-orchestrated score by the usually dependable Jerry
Goldsmith adds to the 90-plus minutes of discomfort.
 Deep Rising  is a movie that should be in the bargain bins and video
stores - and probably will be within the next six months.

Deep Rising is one of "those" movies. The kind of movie which serves no
purpose except to entertain us. It does not ask us to think about
important questions like life on other planets or the possibility that
there is no god...screw that , it says boldly , let's see some computer
generated monsters rip into , decapitate and generally cause irreparable
booboos to a bunch of little known actors. Heh! Them wacky monsters ,
gotta love 'em. Of course , since we can rent about a thousand B movies
with the same kind of story , Hollywood must give that little extra
"oumph" to  get people in theaters. That is where Deep Rising fails ,
which is a good thing. Confused? Let me explain:
Despite all them flashy effects and big explosions , Deep Rising is
still , at heart , a good 'ol B movie. Luckily , it's a very good B
movie. The worst cliches in movie history are a B movie's bread and
butter. Therefore , things that would destroy a serious movie actually
help us have a good time while watching a movie of lower calibre. Of
course we know there's a big slimy creature behind that door , that one
person will wander off to be picked off by said monster and we always
know which persons or person will make it out alive. We just don't know
when or how horrible it will be. 
I went to see Deep Rising with my expections low and my tolerance for
bad dialogue high. Imagine my surprise when i discover that Deep Rising
is actually , well , pretty darn funny at times. A funny B movie? Well ,
that's new. These flicks are not supposed to make us laugh. (Except for
a few unintended laughs once a while.) And before you know it , Treat
Williams , Wes Studi and Famke Jansen appear on the big screen. 
Our man Treat is the hero , he'll live. Wes is a staple of B movies , he
is the token victim. We know he'll buy the farm but he will take a few
creeps with him on the way out. Famke is the babe , 'nuff said. There is
also a guy with glasses ( the guy with glasses always dies ) a black
person ( B movie buffs know that the black guy always dies , never fails
) and a very funny , nerdy guy. ( Ah! Comic relief. How can we possibly
explain having to kill him...let him live.)
After the first fifteen minutes i felt right at home. I know who to root
for and who i need to boo too and a gum to chew. (Please kill me.) 
Suffice it to say that for the next hour and a half i jumped out of my
seat a few times , went "ewwww" about a dozen times and nearly had an
orgasm over all the explosions and firepower our heroes were packing.
I'm a man , we nottice these things. All in all , i'd recommend Deep
Rising if you are looking for a good time and care to leave your brain
at the door...but bring your sense of humor and excitement in with you.
The acting is decent , the effects top rate. 
How to best describe it? Put together the jet ski scene from Hard Rain ,
the bug attacks from Starship Troopers , a couple of James Bond like
stunts and all those scenes from Friday the Thirteenth and Freddy where
you keep screaming "don't go there , he's behind you" and you end up
with Deep Rising.
Rating: 3 and 1/2 stars out of 5 for creepy crawly goodness , tight
t-shirts , major firepower and the need to go to the bathroom every
fifteen minutes from seing all that water.

A luxury cruise liner is on its maiden voyage when terrorists decide to
hijack it. The terrorists only have one problem -- when they board the
vessel, they find that all the passengers have been killed by a sea
monster -- and they are its next meal. Deep Rising is not real heavy in the
plot department, as you might have gleaned from that very brief synopsis.
This is what you would call a typical b-horror flick if it weren't for the
fact that the production values are high enough to bring it out of the
low-budget b-basement. It's obvious that far more effort was expended on the
look of this film than on the story.
I'm taking my shots at this movie, but to tell the truth, as average monster
flicks go, this was fairly entertaining. The cast, while far from
outstanding, wasn't that bad. Treat Williams and Famke Janssen (Goldeneye)
head up the cast. Sure, Treat was a bit over the top, and Famke was clearly
cast more for her stunning looks that her acting talent, but they were fun
to watch together on screen. The supporting cast of mostly unknowns is good
while they are with us. But, as is typical with movies like this, most are
just meals in waiting for the nasty sea monster. It goes after, and devours
things with a great deal of zeal and gore. We mustn't forget the gore in a
film like this. If there were no gross-out moments, where would we be?
The CGI monster shots are not bad (certainly no where near as bad as
Anaconda was), but they won't be heralded as groundbreaking either. They
work well in a movie of this caliber. The ship is very well done -- most of
the action seems to take place on the lower flooded levels of this rapidly
sinking cruise liner, and it all is very impressive from that standpoint. Of
course, the lower decks are also consistently splattered with generous
helpings of gory slime and excreted digested human bodies. How appetizing.
Fun little flick. No more suspension of disbelief required here than in any
other typical horror/monster movie. Just sit back with a big bowl of popcorn
and enjoy. But I would finish the popcorn before they start going to the
lower decks, if I were you. Enjoy.

DEEP RISING (1998)

Say, who thought combining "Speed 2:Cruise Control" and "Deep Star Six" was
a good idea? Why it's none other than writer-director Stephan Sommers,
that's who. He's the one to blame. He's the one to hurl your stones at.
Let's do that now shall we?
Treat Williams stars as a complete and total rip-off of Han Solo, a sea
pirate of sorts taking on missions for lots of cash (at one point he
actually says "I've got a bad feeling about this..." straight from the mouth
of Solo). Anyway, as the film opens we learn that he's been hired by the
most racially balanced group of terrorists you'll ever meet. I believe every
nationality aside from maybe the eskimos and people from Atlantis are
represented by this group. Their plan (from what I can understand, since
it's never discussed in any real detail) is to hijack a super-expensive
cruise ship on it's maiden voyage and sink it, so it's owner can collect the
insurance money. When they arrive onboard though, they have a surprise
waiting for them: slimy sea monsters!
First of all, I know previews are misleading sometimes, but this is the
first time I can ever remember a trailer just downright LYING to the
audience. In the trailers, when we see footage of the terrorists walking
around the ship, the omnious voice over tells us that "They answered a
distress call". THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY WE'RE DOING AT ALL!!! They actually had
to lie to the audience, because they must have realized that NO ONE WILL
CARE about seeing terrorists eaten one by one by sea monsters.
I can give the film credit in two areas. One being the stunts and visual
effects. Granted yes, the effects are computer graphics, but these are
pretty good ones. Most of the time they seem fairly realistic, for monsters
anyway. The other would be the film's ending. Now normally I loathe it when
films (especially horror films) end the way "Deep Rising" does, but in this
case I don't mind at all. These people deserve this ending.
"Deep Rising" is one of those movies that's so bad, it's almost a fun
experience. For example: At the heart of the plot we have the fact that the
ship's owner, who worked all his life to build the ship, wants the boat
destroyed because he just realized that the cost to keep the boat up and
running far exceeds the money he'll make. WHAT??? You devote your life to
something and yet don't bother working out such an important detail like
that? It's that level of stupidity that sinks "Deep Rising". That, and the
fact that you've seen this done, oh, a million times before, and a million
times better. [R]

The formula is simple.  Trap a varied group of people on an isolated
location, then pop in a seemingly unstoppable monster to kill them one
by one.  These have been the successful ingredients for many good films
(The Thing, Alien, Aliens, and Tremors to name a few).  So, why is it
that so many films following this recipe end up pathetically bad?  (See
The Relic for a particularly putrid example.)  Perhaps it is simply too
easy to forget the necessary binding ingredient: effort and ideas.  Deep
Rising meets these two requirements part way, but not enough to salvage
the film.
Treat Williams is Finnegan, the leader of a small boat crew who hire out
their services (and their boat) for any activity...no questions asked.
This time, however, they may have gone too far.  Their passengers, led
by the ominous Wes Studi, are the type of multi-national terrorist
squads usually only seen in Die Hard films.  And their cargo...let's
just say it has very high explosive potential.
What is the target of these thieves?  Why, the Argonauticus, of course,
a high tech luxury cruise yacht on its maiden voyage. But something else
is hunting the Argonauticus...something ancient and deadly.  By the time
the thieves arrive, nearly everyone on board the  ship has been killed.
And now the creature senses fresh meat!
So, you have the thieves and their mercenary boat crew, joining forces
with the surviving passengers (including the ship owner Canton (Anthony
Heald), and a thief with less lofty goals, Trillian (Famke Janssen))
against the terror from the deep.  And the monster gets to pick them off
one by one.
Fortunately for the creature, this particular band of criminals happens
to be the dumbest the world can offer.  Why else would they indulge in
petty squabbling while they watch their friends become fish food.  If
there's a more clarion call for unity, I don't know what it might be.
It's pretty easy to guess who will get killed off when.  There are no
surprises in that the most interesting characters seem to last until the
end.  For the most part, the watery tentacles seem to be acting on the
audience's impulses to get rid of the most boring characters first.
(Although I wonder if the filmmakers might have extended Djimon
Hounsou's life a bit if they knew this would be released so soon after
his acclaim for Amistad.)
Treat Williams is a passable hero, and Famke Janssen does her best Julia
Roberts impersonation.  But while Wes Studi and Anthony Heald are
particularly slimy, very little of the rest of the company stand out in
any way.
The biggest treat in the film, however, has to be Pantucci, Kevin J.
O'Connor's whining engine-boy, under Finnegan's employ.  His constant
quips may be a bit over-written, but they manage to capture the same
vein of nerve-addled humor that Bill Paxton delivered as Hudson in
Aliens (or Todd Graff as Hippie in The Abyss, for that matter).  It's
just a stock part (the comic-relief character), but it almost makes this
tired Alien clone bearable.
As far as the monster goes, although the CGI is done well, the creature
has no logical consistency.  Think back to the great (or even just good)
movie monsters. They all had a set of "rules" about what they could do,
and how and why they would do it. Part of the joy of those films was
slowly discovering, along with the heroes, just what those rules are.
The tentacle monster in Deep Rising doesn't have a set of rules... or if
it does, not a very good one.  It merely eats (or drinks, as the case
may be), and there is no rhyme or reason for what it does in order to do
so.  The film never explains why the Argonauticus is attacked in the
first place.  It simply happens.
The action scenes are decent, but few are noteworthy.  The film
definitely does suffer from its proximity to Titanic.  Deep Rising's
peril in the water scenes pale next to Cameron's (but can you really
blame them).  Unfortunately, Deep Rising's efforts are more on par with
Speed 2.
On the plus side, however, the film's closing image shows some promise
for a potentially interesting (but unlikely) sequel.  Perhaps you'd be
better off waiting for that one.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Welcome to January  the month of movie hell.  One needs to only look
back to past Januarys to see that studios dump crappy projects onto the
unsuspecting audience faster than Kirstie Alley can pound tequila
shooters.  Fierce Creatures, Zeus & Roxanne, Turbulence, Bio-Dome, Eye
for an Eye, The Relic , Bed Of Roses  Bleah!  Chalk Deep Rising up to
the list of shame.
The way that I see it, if you're going to rip off another film, you
might as well make it a good one.  Deep Rising is a offensive
combination of bad Anaconda and a worse Event Horizon.  Its story is
unimaginative and the acting is even worse.  Treat Williams is making a
late charge for the elusive `Worst Actor Of The Decade' title.  Too bad,
Keanu got such a big jump on him.
The story begins on the super-luxury liner `The Argonautica', where the
rich dine and gamble until something knocks it all to hell.  Then, we
cut to a rag-tag bunch on a smaller boat.  The leader is John Finnegan
(Williams) and he and his hapless crew are apparently chartering their
boat to a group of missile-toting thugs.  They break down and seek
refuge on `The Argonautica'.
But, waitthe giant boat is empty, and thus the endless tirade of
cliches and unoriginal situations begin.  Finnegan even utters the line
`I've got a really bad feeling about this'.  So do I, pal.  So do I.
At one point, Finnegan rescues the stock female off of `The Argonautica'
and leads her to his boat to make the big getaway and she utters `That
heap of junk is your ship?'.  Well tape some cinnamon buns to her head
and call me a Wookie.  Finnegan also pilfers the line `Now there's
something you don't see everyday' from ConAir.  And it's not even a
great line.
There are a few good gory scenes and Finnegan's Shaggy-like sidekick
provides adequate comic moments, but it still stinks.  Director Stephen
Sommers, whose previous credits include both Tom & Huck and The
Adventures of Huck Finn, may or may not have been alive during
production.  He has been tagged to helm The Mummy from the Anne Rice
novel.  If she made such a big stink about Tom Cruise playing Lestat,
she'll drop dead over this.

     There may not be a critic alive who harbors as much affection for
shlock monster movies as I do.  I delighted in the sneaky-smart
entertainment of Ron Underwood's big-underground-worm yarn TREMORS; I even
giggled at last year's critically-savaged big-underwater-snake yarn
ANACONDA.  Something about these films causes me to lower my inhibitions
and return to the Saturday afternoons of my youth, spent in the company of
Ghidrah, the Creature from the Black Lagoon and The Blob.
     DEEP RISING, a big-undersea-serpent yarn, doesn't quite pass the
test.  Sure enough, all the modern monster movie ingredients are in place:
a conspicuously multi-ethnic/multi-national collection of bait...excuse
me, characters; an isolated location, here a derelict cruise ship in the
South China Sea; some comic relief; a few CGI-enhanced gross-outs; and at
least one big explosion.  There are too-cheesy-to-be-accidental elements,
like a sleazy shipping magnate (Anthony Heald) who also appears to have a
doctorate in marine biology, or a slinky international jewel thief (Famke
Janssen) whose white cotton tank top hides a heart of gold.  As it
happens, DEEP RISING is noteworthy primarily for the mechanical manner in
which it spits out all those ingredients.  A terrorist crew, led by
squinty-eyed mercenary Hanover (Wes Studi) and piloted by squinty-eyed
boat captain Finnegan (Treat Williams), shows up to loot the cruise ship;
the sea monsters show up to eat the mercenary crew; a few survivors make
it to the closing credits.  And up go the lights.
     It's hard to work up much enthusiasm for this sort of joyless
film-making, especially when a monster moview should make you laugh every
time it makes you scream.  Here, the laughs are provided almost entirely
by Kevin J. O'Connor, generally amusing as the crew's fraidy-cat mechanic.
Writer/director Stephen Sommers seems most concerned with creating a tone
of action-horror menace -- something over-populated with gore-drenched
skeletons, something where the gunfire and special effects are taken a bit
too seriously.  DEEP RISING is missing that one unmistakable cue that
we're expected to have a ridiculous good time, not hide our eyes.
     Case it point, comparing DEEP RISING to its recent cousin ANACONDA.
In DEEP RISING, one of the creature's victims is regurgitated back into
view, partially digested and still alive.  He shrieks in horror at his
freakish appearance and pain, in a moment a bit too disturbing to be
laughable.  In ANACONDA, we also see a regurgitated victim, partially
digested and still alive.  He looks at another character...and winks.
Make no mistake, DEEP RISING has ANACONDA beat all to heck when it comes
to technical proficiency and pacing.  It's also gloomy, uninspired and not
nearly enough fun.  I don't ask much of my monster movies, but I do ask
that they act like monster movies.  You don't have to show me a
fantastically impressive, massive beast with tentacles a-flailing.  Just
show me the massive beast burping, and I'll figure you get the point.
