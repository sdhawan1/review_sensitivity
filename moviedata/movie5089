     When watching old films, every once in a while you come across a real gem;
sometimes it's one that has been remarked upon, like BRINGING UP BABY, and
sometimes it comes out of the blue.  Here's one of the latter, a romantic
comedy which is a pleasure to sit through, and a star combination (Cooper and
Dietrich) which is dazzling to watch.  It was picked for the "Hollywood Code"
series due to its producer's ability to weave innuendo with innocence; in a
film that deals with a jewel thief's attempts to smuggle pearls, it's ironic to
see how Lubitsch smuggles Cooper into Dietrich's bedroom, and gets her off
scott-free at the end, even though she is definitely a con artist throughout
the film.  It's a pleasure to watch -- it's clear that the two have been
sleeping together, but any attempts by the censorship board to bring it up
would have looked foolish; Lubitsch's genius is how he made it appear that the
censors had dirty minds!
     A brief synopsis (I wouldn't want to spoil it for you): The opening shows
how jewel thief Dietrich pulls off an immensely amusing heist of a pearl
necklace.  On the run to Spain, she runs into (literally) Gary Cooper, a
Detroit automobile engineer who is taking two weeks vacation in Spain before
returning to the U.S.  Of course, they fall for each other, but there are some
nasty people after Dietrich on both sides of the law, and it's up to ol'
Montana Gary to get the lil' lady out of it.
