I HATE ACTORS (France, 1986)
Director/Screenwriter: Gerard Krawczyk (based on the novel by Ben Hecht)
Cast: Jean Poiret, Michel Blanc, Bernard Blier, Guy Marchand,
      Claude Chabroi
     In this short span of time we call life, we generally learn what to do and
what not to do through pleasure/displeasure response.  Yes, I know, there are
other (far nobler) reasons, but the majority of events, people and places we
avoid are due to repeatedly wretched experiences with them.  There are
exceptions, but statistically, they all fall into what Jimmy the Greek would
call "a bad gamble."  The freeway during rush hour; the old buddy who calls you
up for a "wild time" next weekend; the restaurant with the waiters who sniff at
your Levis.  And your French comedies.
     I really don't have much to say about this film.  It's shot in black and
white, and attempts to be a comic mystery set in the Hollywood of the 1940s.
It uses (make that 'attempts') a lot of physical humor and contains a lot of
characters who act stupidly.  I liked one bit with an Errol Flynn-like actor
performing a sword fight scene while on lithium, but other than that, it was a
blur.  It looks particularly sad next to WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT;  Eddie
Valiant has it over these goons any day of the week.  Amazing how little was
funny about this film....
