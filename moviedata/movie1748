Many hit songs (e.g. "American Pie") have been
conscripted as movie titles over the years.
The title may be somewhat appropriate to the
film's subject, but usually the plot of the
film has nothing to do with the song.  The title
has merely served to market the film.
Not so with "Ode to Billy Joe", the story of
which is derived from the 1968 hit.  And stretched
thin as well: the story sags in the final
third, with too much made of the unlikely
'shocker' that caused Billy Joe McAllister
(Robby Benson) to jump off the Tallahatchie
Bridge.
But despite the late-arriving pathos, most of
the film is much better than its reputation.
Writer Herman Raucher has a knack for dialogue,
adding life and dimension to the characters.
The rural deep South of the early 1950s is
credibly depicted.  While folks are not going
hungry, luxuries such as electricity and
indoor plumbing have generally not been
introduced.  The sweltering summers must be
survived without air conditioning, and the
boredom and lack of opportunity leads to
periodic rowdiness from the lily-white,
working class males.
Bobbie Lee (Glynnis O'Connor) is in her
mid-teens and has long since begun thinking
of boys.  Sheltered by her sympathetic but
conservative parents, she longs for lovestruck
Billy Joe, who tags after her to her obvious
delight.  But just as Bobbie Lee wheedles
dating concessions from her father, young
Billy Joe begins acting even more peculiar
than usual.  He is racked with guilt over
a deed which she cannot get him to reveal.
Benson and O'Connor were earlier teamed in
"Jeremy", a film with a different setting
but sharing the same theme of puppy love
between the leads.
