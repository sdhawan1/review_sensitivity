     These are the sacrifices that I make to see new animation.  Well, I guess
you can't call George Pal's Puppetoons "new" animation, but I had never seen
them before so they were new to me.  I wasn't sure what to expect even after
seeing the previews but am I glad that I went.
     Puppetoons were a form of animation where George Pal took various puppets
and moved them, carved new ones, and otherwise manipulated them in the
annimation process.  There is a fluid movement to his Puppetoons which was
particularly fun to watch, especially during his dance sequences.  As with most
of the early animation these seem to revolve around presenting popular music
of the day.  The clips shown in the movie come primarily from the 1930's and
1940's.
     The movie starts with Gumby and friends (take me now, Lord) talking about
George Pal.  You get a series of useless discussions and then finally they get
down to showing the puppetoons.
     Most of the clips shown are just that, clips that are thrown together.  I
found that to be a little disconcerting, but I imagine that they wanted to show
us as much as possible.  There are a few Puppetoons shown in their entirety
and they are gems.  "Tulips Shall Grow," "In Stormy Weather" and especially
"Tubby the Tuba" are excellent stories, well-animated and just a joy to watch.
The movie got me interested in finding out more about Puppetoons.
     Overall I can't wholeheartedly recommend the movie.  The clips get
tiresome to watch and there is no connection between the different Puppetoons
shown.  Still, if you would like to learn about another form of animation and
see some wonderful 'toons, go see this movie when it comes to your town.
