        Hollywood Pictures' DANGEROUS MINDS is a well-done modern
interpretation of the classic "lost kids are saved by a teacher with an
attitude" theme.  Similar to the film STAND AND DELIVER, this drama and
street action movie is certainly worth the cost at your local theatre.  The
film is well done with a nice touch of the true ghetto feeling that one can
relate to.  The screen and camera play exceeds the standard and the hip-hop
soundtrack will have you bouncing in your seat.  The talented yet largely
unkwown cast has put together one of the better films of this summer....

DANGEROUS MINDS boasts a winning performance from Michelle Pfeiffer and
that's about it.  She's a marvel as real-life teacher LouAnne Johnson, an
ex-Marine whose innovative teaching techniques help her in "combat" against
a distracted, disillusioned inner-city "audience."  She captures their
attention by demonstrating karate, handing out candy bars, and, in the
farthest leap from reality, getting them interested in reading by reciting
the lyrics to "Mr. Tambourine Man."  [ Insert sound clip of William Shatner
singing same. ]
In *this* version of LouAnne's story-- which is believable for all five
minutes-- the students can read *and* write, presumably because they're
rarely distracted by sex, drugs, or rounds of ammo.  Another stretch is
Pfeiffer's character, who apparently has no life outside of the classroom.
(A subplot with Andy Garcia as the boyfriend was cut.  He probably kept
blushing at her accent.)  She spends all of her time with her students, the
only students in the only period that we see her teaching.  Talk about
dedication!
The loss, here, is that DANGEROUS MINDS never goes far *enough* away from
reality to make a difference.  The soundtrack is juiced, but not the story.
It's neither real enough, nor *unreal* enough to be interesting.
Though it's already left Triangle theaters, Alex Graves' remarkable debut is
certainly worth a look-see if and when it arrives on video.  The story--
which plays like an inverted BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY-- centers on a
depressed Kansas housewife (Jennifer Taylor) who, literally, meets the man
of her dreams (Aaron Shields).
Shot for 14 days on mere $25K, this OASIS is hardly crude.  Sure, the
production values are modest, no duh, but Graves' writing and direction are
both dead-on.  Even blown up from 16mm, there's more dramatic potency here
than almost all of the summer stock combined.
The subject of cross-dressing has already, ah, come out of the closet in
recent films ranging from MRS. DOUBTFIRE to PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT.
The novelty of men-as-women has passed, making a full-length documentary on
the subject -- in the context of New York's annual drag festival -- seem
like too little, too late.
Despite an endless array of towering wigs and colorful costumes, WIGSTOCK is
a shrill, unfocused film with no real momentum behind it.  There's virtually
no story to hold the raw footage together.  In terms of sheer spectacle,
it's amusing enough; but it's camp without a sense of time, place, or
purpose.  Who are these characters?  What is this event??  The film never
tells.
The Great Saturation continues.  Some 100+ films are scheduled for release
over the next four months, from a host of Our Favorite Directors.  Here's

     In the movies, like in real life, it isn't enough just to have a heart
in the right place.  Good intentions are nice, but they need to be backed up
by an intelligent script telling an involving story.  In the case of
DANGEROUS MINDS, we get an idealized version of inner city life, where,
though problems may require more than the wave of a magic wand to remove,
the solutions still seem too facile.
     DANGEROUS MINDS is based on a true story (MY POSSE DON'T DO HOMEWORK,
written by Louanne Johnson), but never has the Hollywood sheen been more
apparent.  With master crowd-pleasers Don Smith and Jerry Bruckheimer behind
the production, there is never any question that this movie will pander to
the least common denominator.  Drama is pretty much by-the-numbers, tragedy
is shallow, and the resolution is expectedly upbeat.  Emotion and character
interaction rarely ring true.
     Ex-Marine Louanne Johnson (Michelle Pfeiffer) comes to a Palo Alto high
school in search of a job as a student teacher.  What she gets instead is a
full-time position teaching English to a group of bright but "socially
challenged" students that she quickly dubs as the "rejects from hell."  When
her first-day wardrobe choice and meek attitude earn her the nickname of
"White Bread", she tries a radical approach: wear a leather jacket, curse as
proficiently as the kids, and teach karate as a lead-in to English Lit.  It
works, and the students start to come around.  Despite protestations from an
uptight, by-the-book principal (Courtney B. Vance), lives are changed as a
result of Louanne's unorthodox approach of using Bob Dylan lyrics to teach
poetry and rewarding completed assignments with trips to amusement parks and
dinners at fancy restaurants.
     How much of DANGEROUS MINDS ended up on the cutting room floor?  A good
question, and the answer may explain why this film is so erratic.
Relationships that should have been better developed are left in an
embryonic stage.  The most notable is between Louanne and an especially
difficult pupil, Emilio (Wade Dominguez).  There's obviously something
missing in the way these two learn to relate to each other.  The result of
this incomplete, hit-and-miss approach diminishes the impact of the film's
central tragedy.
     DANGEROUS MINDS has a heart, but no soul.  In the face of hard-hitting
pictures like KIDS and TEEN DREAMS, it's difficult not to see this movie as
trivializing serious issues.  The seams in the script show a little too
clearly, and the heavy-handed attempts at audience manipulation stand out.
Michelle Pfeiffer gives a solid performance, as do a number of the young
actors playing Louanne's students, but DANGEROUS MINDS is in desperate need
of more than good acting.  It demands substance rather than the filler that
the film makers thought would make an acceptable substitute.

        The Movie Critic at LARGE in me found a lot wrong with 
this movie, but the idiot moviegoer in me liked it anyway. It was 
predictable, shallow and uneven, but I like that Michelle Pfeiffer, even 
if she was horribly miscast in the role of a tough teacher who wins 
over a class of gangstas. DANGEROUS MINDS never goes into the 
deep, poignant drama you'd expect, but instead has a lot of humorous 
and manufactured "touching" moments, which the idiot moviegoer fell 
for hook, line and sinker.
        Michelle Pfeiffer arrives for her new job teaching an English 
class for "special" students to find out they're not the geniuses she 
hoped they'd be but rather the exact same class from SISTER ACT 2 
(Or didn't you notice?) of aspiring rappers, pregnant girls and sleepers, 
a real public high school cross-section.
        Still, she determines to make them learn by taking them all to 
the amusement park (What better place to learn about Shakespeare, 
right? "Forsooth! Methinks I see The Nauseator up ahead forwith. I 
will tame the savage beast or spew out chasms of chunder for a 
fortnight in the attempt! Zounds!") and giving out candy bars to 
students with correct answers. No teacher I've ever had has gone that 
far to encourage learning, although my third grade teacher used to buy 
those packages of stale wafer-thin butter cookies that come in boxes of 
300 and sit in the factory until all hint of freshness and taste is sucked 
out, then sit on the supermarket shelf another few months and years 
until some woman on a teacher's salary comes in and decides she's 
gonna get her kids to learn even if it means spending that 99 cents on 
the 300 cookies. And it worked because, hey, we were kids, what did 
we know?
        So slowly Pfeiffer's students warm up to the bribes and get 
high on learning (higher learning, right? Wrong! Different movie!), as 
we all knew they would. And then, about three-fourths of the way 
through, when it seems like all is going right for Michelle and her 
young charges, we get the age-old contrived conflict, just as we knew 
we would. Here, one of the students is needlessly axed just to further 
the plot and teach a valuable lesson--always remember to knock. If 
you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about. If you 
haven't, that leaves the other option.
        Surely from reading this review, you see the myriad flaws 
both with DANGEROUS MINDS and my writing (I'm asking you to 
ignore the flaws in the writing.), but perhaps you'll see the movie 
anyway and fall prey, as I did, to the false sentiment and manufactured 
poignancy. I saw right through many other recent bad dramas along 
these lines (WITH HONORS, THE PROFESSIONAL) but 
DANGEROUS MINDS somehow got to me. I guess it's dangerous to 
let a movie like that get into your mind, but oh well.
