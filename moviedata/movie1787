Starring Brendan Fraser; Rachel Weisz; John Hannah; Arnold Voslo & Kevin J.
O'Connor
Brendan Fraser stars in this remake of the 1930's Boris Karloff classic.
This new mummy is not only a tribute to the original but it is very
blatantly paying homage to Raiders Of The Lost Ark as well. Brendan Fraser
is no Indiana Jones, but he comes pretty darn close. I'll admit right off
the bat that I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of The Mummy. I figured on a
few nifty special effects and not a whole lot else. I was in for quite the
surprise. The Mummy is a whole lot of fun, and will probably rank as one of
my favorite movies of the year. Fraser plays a former soldier turned fortune
hunter who, in no small way, resembles a certain character that Harrison
Ford made famous. Although, Fraser's character doesn't have a bullwhip. Rick
O'Connell (Fraser) is one of the few people who has ever seen the Lost City
of the Dead in Egypt. It is reported to contain an immense treasure and
volumes of great knowledge. He is hired by a librarian (Rachel Weisz) and
her brother (John Hannah) to take them to the city so that they can try to
find its hidden treasures. Once there they run into a bit more than they
bargained for. They inadvertently bring back to life a mummy which has been
sealed in the ancient city along with a very bad curse. Basically, once this
Mummy gets reawakened he isn't a real nice guy. And once he gets up to full
strength he will be able to control the world. By the way, the way he gains
strength is to replace the long rotted parts of his body with new flesh from
living victims. The Mummy has as his command the power to create plagues of
biblical proportion, such as locusts, making the water turn to blood and
fireballs falling from the sky. All and all, not the sort of fellow that you
want to be enemies with.
The plot of the movie is a little on the popcorn side of things. It is your
typical light summer fare. This is not a difficult movie to follow, yet on
the other hand there are enough spills, thrills and one liners to keep the
audience thoroughly entertained throughout the movie. I was not really
expecting a whole lot in either the dialogue or acting portions of this
movie. On both counts I was happily wrong. This isn't Oscar-caliber dialogue
mind you, but it is witty and often pretty funny. I found most of it was
designed to give the movie that Indiana Jones feel. Even in the worst of
situations, someone seemingly had a wisecrack. The acting was very
impressive. Brendan Fraser has never really been in a movie that ever really
impressed the heck out of me. This time he did. Fraser comes off as a young
Harrison Ford in this movie. He might not have quite as much talent as Ford,
but he certainly has the charisma and screen presence to make up for it.
Quite honestly, he is no slouch in the talent department either. Rachel
Weisz does a fine job as the take charge librarian who eventually falls for
Fraser's character. The actor who I enjoyed the most was John Hannah as
Weisz's somewhat roguish brother. His character was pure comic relief, and
Hannah delivered all the way. Arnold Voslo was also good playing the mummy.
Although his scenes were somewhat limited because of the nature of his
character.
The reason Voslo's scenes were limited was the fact that for a good portion
of the movie, the Mummy was purely a computer generated character. More or
less a walking skeleton with a little rotting flesh on him. Although there
was more and more meat on him as the movie progressed and the body count
mounted. The CGI Mummy was probably the most impressive CGI character that I
have ever seen in a movie. I would say it will be a long time before the
effects were surpassed if it weren't for the fact that Star Wars: Episode
I - The Phantom Menace wasn't being released a week and a half after this
film. The Mummy itself wasn't the only impressive computer generated horror
in this film. Special effects wizards also used computers to generate a very
impressive killer windstorm as well as the Mummy's undead henchmen. One of
the neatest touches was the CGI flesh eating beetles -- I'll say no more.
If, when you think of The Mummy, you picture a slow moving creature wrapped
in gauze chasing people at speeds approaching 1/4 of a mile per hour, you
are in for a shock. This new Mummy is slick, scary and a whole lot of fun.
The Mummy might not go down as a "classic" like the original, but it will
provide you with one of the most enjoyable movie experiences that you are
likely to see in a summer film.

Plot: In 1290 B.C. the Egyptian high priest Imhotep is sentened to a death 
too horrible to be described for daring to seduce the Pharaoh's mistress 
Anck-su-namun. In 1926 Evelyn Carnovan, a librarian at the Cairo Museum of 
Antiquities, comes across a map leading to Hamunaptra, the forbidden Ancient 
Egyptian city of the dead. Rescuing adventurer Rick O'Connell who promises 
to lead her there from the hangman's noose, she sets forth on an expedition 
to find Hamunaptra, although they find themselves in a race against a rival 
American expedition. But the attempts of both parties to be the first to 
discover the lost city end up reviving the mummified remains of Imhotep. 
Imhotep needs the human organs of a number of victims in order to regenerate 
and unleashes the twelve Biblical plagues as he attempts to claim the 
necessary victims, incarnate his beloved Anck-su-namun in the body of Evelyn 
and unleash a blight of evil across the Earth.
The mummy film is maybe one subgenre more than any other that is condemned 
to B programmer status simply by its theme. The 1932 Boris Karloff The 
Mummy' was a genre classic which, albeit cast a little too much in the 
shadow of the 1931 Bela Lugosi Dracula', was given enormous eerie 
atmosphere by director Karl Freund. But the subsequent mummy sequels 
produced by Universal - The Mummy's Hand' (1940), The Mummy's Tomb' 
(1942), The Mummy's Ghost' (1944) and The Mummy's Curse' (1944) - turned 
the title character into a clumsy bandaged-wrapped zombie wholly lacking in 
threat, before reaching the ignoble nadir of Abbott and Costello Meet the 
Mummy' (1955). England's Hammer Studios remade The Mummy' in 1959, along 
with a package of other classic Universal horror films. There the character 
was effectively fed through the dynamic polarization of Victorian reason 
versus animal passion that the early Hammer films effectively represented. 
But alas subsequent Hammer mummy films - Curse of the Mummy's Tomb' (1964) 
and The Mummy's Shroud' (1967), with the arguable exception of Blood from 
the Mummy's Tomb' (1971) - failed to escape the B programmer curse. And 
outside of the English-speaking world, the mummy's career path was well and 
truly on a long downward spiral, most notably being pitted in the ring in 
Mexico's Wrestling Women vs the Aztec Mummy' (1964) and Santo vs the Mummy 
(19) , while Spain offered gore-drenched efforts like Vengeance of the 
Mummy' (1972) and Dawn of the Mummy' (1981). It can almost be said that the 
most effective mummy films are those that escape B programmer status by 
virtue of subsuming themselves into some other type of genre. The only other 
halfway effective mummy film has been the underrated The Awakening' (1980) 
which dropped all bandaged-wrapped terrors and created an often subtle story 
about possession while modelling itself on the supernatural killings 
set-pieces of The Omen'. (It was also the first mummy film in fifty years 
to actually shoot on location in Egypt).
The latest remake of The Mummy' endeavours to abandon most connections to 
the mummy B movie and happily conflates the genre into a high adventure film 
a la the Indiana Jones series. If the 1932 version of The Mummy' was born 
out of the emergent romantic horror film created by Universal's Dracula' 
and the 1959 Mummy' was pitted in the British fight with morality and 
society over animal instinct, then the 1999 Mummy' is born out of the 
modern action-adventure spectacle and the CGI creature movie post-Jurassic 
Park'. This Mummy' quickly abandons any connection with the shuffling 
bandage-enwrapped creatures of yore and the new mummy becomes a much more 
dynamic figure whose abilities are writ on an epic canvas - it talks, it is 
a black sorcerer who transforms into flurries of sand, blasts sandstorms out 
of its mouth, raises armies of the undead and animated scarab beetles, while 
wielding the Biblical Plagues of Egypt (which have in a complete about-face 
been placed in the service of a great Egyptian force of evil rather than in 
the service of the Almighty wishing to free a slave race from the Egyptian 
yolk).
The Mummy' remake has been an oft-mentioned go-project for most of the 
1990s under directors such as Mick Garris and Clive Barker. Indeed when 
Anthony Perkins died in 1992 he was in the midst of shooting a subsequently 
abandoned remake. The director finally settled on, Stephen Sommers, debuted 
with the teen comedy Catch Me If You Can' (1989) and followed with the 
acclaimed 1993 The Adventures of Huck Finn' before making the underrated 
1994 live-action remake of The Jungle Book' which, although it bore more in 
common with Edgar Rice Burroughs than Rudyard Kipling, had a beautiful sense 
of epic jungle adventure to it. However Sommers disappointed with 1998's 
Alien'-at-sea clone, Deep Rising'.
Sommers though has a talent for crafting epic adventure. In The Jungle 
Book' Sommers created an adventure-movie version of India that was more 
fabulous and more mysterious than the real India could ever hope to be and 
in The Mummy' similarly creates a more fabulous and mysterious than the 
real Egypt adventure movie version of Egypt. The film is filled with 
incredible vistas of sandstorms, lost cities seen both in the fabulousness 
of their heyday and the spleandour of their ruins, treasure chambers, 
booby-trapped tombs. No sky ever seems merely blue but boils with coloured 
clouds and larger-than-real-life CGI moons. And Sommers has an ability to 
direct satisfyingly kinetic action set-pieces - shootouts with hordes of 
charging horsebound Bedouins, fights aboard burning ships, adventurers 
attempting to combat mummies with machine-guns and swords, biplanes racing 
against giant face-shaped sandstorms and a full-tilt Evil Dead'-styled 
climatic set-piece up against zombified mummy priests.
But for all that Sommers' film crumbles into a lightweight popcorn munch 
without substance whose taste is immediately forgotten when one leaves the 
theatre. When one looks at it, it stirs no more and no less than the sum of 
the elements that Raiders of the Lost Ark' assembled, yet Raiders' became 
an instant classic while The Mummy' falls well short of such stature and 
will probably barely even be remembered by the end of the summer. The 
difference is more akin to that between Raiders' and Indiana Jones and the 
Last Crusade' - where, by the time of the third of the Indiana Jones film, 
the sheer panache and kinetic inventivity of the first film had become 
ham-fisted slapstickery. Sommers great failing here is to play far too much 
towards common denominator audience-pleasing humour. The two leads make flip 
quips the whole way through and what few moments of horror there are drowned 
out by Army of Darkness'-styled gags with skeletons playing football with 
their heads, with Weisz accidentally knocking down a domino line of library 
shelves and the like. Sommers is working with a one-dimensional script and a 
less-than-serious attitude toward it by he and the principals is something 
that causes the film's suspension of disbelief to fold at the knees.
Neither do the leads work. Brendan Fraser comes with too much baggage as 
casting as an amiable lunkead in comedies like Encino Man' (1992), 
Airheads' (1994), George of the Jungle' (1997) and Blast from the Past' 
(1999). There is no depth to his character at all - we, for instance, never 
learn what he, an American, is doing adventuring in Egypt in the first 
place. A handsome stalwart leading man type such as Harrison Ford or Tom 
Selleck would have carried this part in their sleep but Fraser's goofy 
eye-rollings strip the character of any heroic stature. Similarly Rachel 
Weisz plays the fruity British accent up but, as always, she gives an awful 
performance and is not at all believable as a period woman. Arnold Vosloo 
has a certain sinister presence as the title character while John Hannah 
makes for irritating comic relief. But again the 
less-than-single-dimensionality of the writing makes the parts seem even 
slighter. Even more unforgivably most of the Arabic characters in the film 
seem written as comic foil racial caricatures where anybody of Arabic 
persuasion is portrayed as craven, greedy and stupid.
Eventually the film's persistent spectacle and sheer dynamism carries it to 
a certain level of likability, albeit entirely forgettable likability. You 
can't deny that Sommers directs action well, but neither can you deny that 
the miscast leads and a far too broad audience-pleasing sense of humour 
entirely deflates it as a film. Its lack of belief in its own seriousness is 
the dividing line between a forgettable popcorn film and what could have had 
the makings of a classic.

In the first scenes of the movie, when the Pharaoh's mistress appears,
you get the impression that this is not a movie for children.  But, you'd
be wrong.  Her `dress' is alluring, but it's only provocative, not
revealing.  For a few seconds, you think that she and her lover could be
the `good guys' but they are not.  This guy is NOT the Pharaoh.    She is
slain for being unfaithful, and her organs are removed and placed into
five jars.  Then, her lover becomes the Mummy of the title when he is
wrapped in gauze and put into a sarcophagus, with a jugful of roaches, and
buried.
Does this sound like a movie for kids?  Well, it is.  Throughout the
movie I kept thinking that my nine-year old grandson will love it.  There
are interesting moments as they dutifully explain the mummification
process.  It is not a great film by any account, but I'll bet that it will
become a favorite with young boys (and girls) all over.  When my children
were that age, they totally enjoyed a movie where the good guys battled
skeletons.  I think that it was `The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad' or such.  I
really didn't think that it was a very good film, but they talk about it
to this day.  The Mummy is that kind of film.  It makes you think of
`Raiders of the Lost Ark' and Brendan Fraser is very reminiscent of
Harrison Ford instead of being a cartoon character like George of the
Jungle. 
When movies such as the original Mummy and Frankenstein were made many
years ago, you knew that such events couldn't really happen, but they
scared you to death.  Too many films today show shootings, explosions, and
other mayhem to `entertain' you, but unfortunately, they could happen.  
That really scares me.    The Mummy is a fun, scary movie.  You know that
something is going to jump out at you, but you enjoy it.  The woman behind
me let out a scream that embarrassed her, but she was scared!  
You won't recognize most of the actors by name, but you'll remember
seeing them `somewhere'.  They are all excellent in their roles.  They
also reminded me of old-time actors like Peter Lorre, and J. Carroll Nash.
 It is well worth your time.  Take your kids and grandkids, and let
yourself just be entertained without analyzing the production values.

Based on the Boris Karloff's classic by the same name, The Mummy starts
off with the high-priest of Osiris, Imhotep, who murders the pharoah for
his mistress and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifying
way possible -- bandaged up, having his tongue removed, and being
covered in flesh-eating scarab beetles, then entombed...all while still
alive.
Recap a few thousand years later, where a soldier named Rick (played by
Brandan Fraser) aids a young historian named Evelyn (played by Rachel
Wiesz) and her brother, Jonathan (played by John Hannah) in finding the
book of Amon Ra, in the process inadvertently freeing the Mummy. 
Problem is that the Mummy wants to revive his mistress, using Evelyn as
a sacrifice...
Walking in with relatively low expectations, I thought this movie was
actually pretty good.  The visuals and CGI are astounding, and obviously
not cheaply done at all.  They pack a ton of detail into the images,
especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by CGI. 
The computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes, such as
unnerving moments involving flesh-eating scarab beetles and moments
where the Mummy goes after the people who freed him (after all, those
who took his artifacts are cursed).  
Unfortunately, the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span
of time, becoming a tug of war for control between genres.  On one hand,
it is a fast paced action film.  On the other, it's a frightening horror
film.  And on the side, it's a hilarious comedy.
Ideally, for it to be successful, the film would have to focus on one
the more action oriented aspect, with one character serving as the comic
relief (that would be Johnson).  The problem with this film is that it
has at least three characters serving as comic relief, with Rick
occasionally delivering his witty one-liner.  If they were trying to
make a horror-action-comedy, it would have helped if it were established
early on in the film, but unfortunately, with the backstory of Imhotep's
entombment, that would be impossible.
And then there's the slapstick fight scene between a sword-wielding Rick
and an army of mummies.  While really well done, it had the feel of
slapstick comedy.  Replace the sword with a chainsaw and you'd
effectively have Ash fighting zombies in Army of Darkness.  While
entertaining and funny, it feels really out of place.  But at least it's
a break from the naive heroes that Brendan Fraser has been playing a lot
of.  
On the whole, the movie is pure popcorn fare from beginning to end,
entertaining the audience.  But I must end my review with a plea to
movie theatre owners...TURN THE SOUND DOWN!  While a lot of theatres
have good sound systems, my ears were almost ringing as I walked out of
the theatre (the sound is particularly irritating and will make you crap
your pants if you're not careful).  When they were showing the trailer
for the upcoming Schwarzenegger film, "End of Days", it was so loud I
couldn't make anything out.

This mummy should have stayed under wraps
Ancient Egypt has been a source of fascination for the western world for
centuries. Mysteries surrounding the construction and meaning of the pyramids
have given rise to numerous theories: some outlandish, others difficult to
believe and none proven.
Most information concerning the arcane secrets of the gigantic structures has
been lost to vandals and the ravages of time. Were they built using science
that we no longer know about? By ancient astronauts from Sirius? By engineers
from legendary Atlantis? Or is there a more mundane answer that, for some
reason, we've been unable to discover?
Recent discoveries that the pyramids might be much older than previously
thought, that they are accurate astronomical indicators and that they might
not have been built as burial chambers verify how little we know.
The lack of facts only adds to the allure of the lost civilization. In the
early 1900s, occult groups dressed in Egyptian garb. There's even a pyramid
with a floating eye on the back of U.S. currency.
The film is loosely based on the 1932 classic which spawned at least seven
sequels and the Universal Films series of monster films. If we're lucky, this
version will die without any descendants.
In 1719 BC, Egyptian high priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) is caught with his
hands on the Pharaoh's mistress. Not living in a particularly forgiving
culture, he is mummified alive, doomed to spend all eternity in torment with
flesh-eating bugs for company.
Soldier of fortune Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) stumbles across the hidden
ruins of the lost city of Hamunaptra in 1923. A few years later he returns
with librarian and Egyptologist Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) looking for gold and
archeological treasure.
Unwittingly they unleash Imhotep, who now has almost unlimited powers although
he's not likely to show up in People's most beautiful people issue. His
wrappings eaten by the insects, the priest has decomposed and is...gooey.
Grabbing various organs from available humans, he rebuilds himself so he can
resurrect his long-dead lover.
The movie is filled with special effects designed to awe and frighten the
audience, but the most horrifying aspect of the film is that it is a comedy.
The original featured atmospheric lighting and smart directing to create
tension. The 1999 version is more like a high budget "The Three Stooges Meet
Indiana Jones And The Mummy".
The attraction that fills the seats is the anticipation of magnificent
effects. The previews are a masterpiece of promises that don't deliver. Some
of the effects are impressive, but others are surprisingly lame. The early
sequences in ancient Egypt are majestic, but the computerized scenery features
that too-smooth look that plagues recent films. It looks like the background
is filmed through a thick layer of Vaseline. Later, the re-animated bodyguards
aren't much better than the monsters in "Jason And The Argonauts".
There are missed opportunities galore. Director Stephen Sommers wastes time
showing Evelyn knocking over bookcases while virtually ignoring the mysterious
guardians of Hamunaptra.
Details of the plot are troublesome. Why would the Egyptians construct a
creature who would destroy the country if discovered? The other group of
treasure hunters racing to the lost city adds nothing to the story.
The cast is a mixed blessing. Fraser never connects with his character and
Weisz's damsel in distress is too goofy. The second bananas fare better. John
Hannah as Evelyn's scheming brother is a perfect foil for the adventurers.
Kevin O'Connor plays sniveling Beni with a presence that does Peter Lorre
proud. Oded Fehr as Ardeth Bay, leader of the guardians, is intriguing but
barely on-screen.
The film is less reminiscent of the original than it is of "Allan Quatermain
and the Lost City of Gold", a feeble "Raiders Of The Lost Ark" rip-off.
Producer James Jacks admits "Indiana Jones" was a role model.
Maybe they should have looked a bit more carefully at what made that movie
work. "The Mummy" is a farce masquerading as an adventure film based on a
classic horror film. It succeeds at none of the above.

Directed by Stephen Sommers.
Cast: Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, Jonathan 
Hyde, Kevin J. O'Connor.
1999 - 125 minutes
Rated PG-13 (for mild profanity and horror elements).
Reviewed May 8, 1999.
The first week of May apparently has become the new starting-off point 
for the Summer Movie Season, as a big special-effects blockbuster opens 
and cashes in tons o' money (last year was "Deep Impact"). This year, 
that film is "The Mummy" a loose-as-a-goose remake of the 1932 Universal 
horror classic. The funny thing is, this latest adaptation's villain 
isn't even an actual mummy, which sort of makes the title rather 
confused. On second thought, that's probably appropriate, since the 
whole film is a painfully muddled attempt at intermixing three genres 
(adventure/horror/comedy) that only a master director could pull off. 
Unfortunately, the director of "The Mummy" happens to be Stephen 
Sommers, a talentless filmmaker whose clumsy and idiotic 
monster-on-a-cruise-ship adventure/horror/comedy "Deep Rising" graced 
the silver screens last year, and whose motto probably is, "the more 
special effects shots, the better the film!" I'd say Sommers should have 
quit while he was ahead, but he's never actually been ahead.
In the brief prologue, set around 1200 B.C., a narrator that would sound 
better equipped for a slapstick in the "Naked Gun" vein tells the story 
of the high priest, Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), who was caught having an 
affair with the Pharaoh's wife, and then heartbroken when she killed 
herself. In an attempt to resurrect her body, the proceedings are broken 
and Imhotep is mummified alive and locked in a tomb with a mound of 
flesh-eating scarab bugs.
Switch forward to Cairo, Egypt, circa 1926, Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), an 
intelligent, klutzy librarian, is given a sacred map by her older 
brother, Jonathan (John Hannah), that points the way to Hamunaptra, the 
infamous city in which Imhotep's body stands amid treasure. With the 
help of the ruggish American adventurer, Rick O'Connell (Brendan 
Fraser), whom has been to Hamunaptra before, the three of them set out 
to find the treasures, including a consecrated book hidden amidst the 
ruins, but instead find The Book of the Dead. Once Evelyn foolishly 
unlocks and reads a passage from it, the ghoulishly decomposing body of 
Imhotep is resurrected, both to set into motion the ten deadly plagues 
of Egypt and to once again attempt the revival of his beloved mistress.
Pleasant and wickedly funny is the way I would have decribed "The Mummy" 
at the 45-minute mark, which mostly involves the characters of Evelyn 
and Rick and their travels to Hamunaptra. The dialogue was amusing (at 
one point when Evelyn gets drunk, she mistakenly says, "I bet you're 
wondering why a place like me would want to go to a girl like this"), 
and an action sequence in which they must jump from a firey ship when it 
is taken over by their adversaries was fast-paced and exciting. It's 
just too bad that these early scenes were simply the set-up for the 
resurrection of Imhotep (who, by the way, isn't a mummy but a rotting 
corpse) and a non-stop parade of mindless and flashy visual effects, 
courtesy of Industrial Light & Magic. Ultimately, once the main story 
arrived, the film completely fell apart, losing sight of its characters 
and concentrating solely on the millions of dollars that had been put up 
on the screen. Well, Sommer also was concerned about throwing a corny, 
completely inappropriate one-liner at us every minute, and I almost was 
apt to feel sorry for the waste of Fraser's talent until I remembered 
that he was the one that chose to appear in the film in the first place.
A more on-target title probably would have been "Prince of Egypt 2: 
Imhotep's Tomb," since the animated film from last December is 
frighteningly similar, minus the dead coming back to life. From the 
artificial first shot that would lead you to believe you were about to 
view an animated feature in which hundreds of slaves are shown working 
among the pyramids, to the subplot in which the plagues are set into 
motion, including a swarm of locusts and the river running red, the film 
was basically "The Prince of Egypt," but with comedy. Although ILM's 
effects look good, they are never actually convincing or threatening, 
nor is the film itself, since you get the notion right from the start 
that every character is bound to die except for our noble protagonists 
who improbably escape any sort of life-threatening danger that comes 
their way. 
Another plot development that threatens to strangle your suspension of 
disbelief concerns Imhotep's mission to sacrifice Evelyn in order to 
bring his love back from the grave. Oddly enough, he didn't need a 
female sacrifice when he tried the same ritual during the prologue. 
So what's to like about "The Mummy?" Let's see. I did like the opening 
sections and some of the line-readings were funny. Rachel Weisz is a 
stand-out in her role of Evelyn, the only three-dimensional and actually 
likable character in the whole film. Since her wasted turns in 1996's 
awful "Chain Reaction" and the failed "Stealing Beauty," she has clearly 
been a young actress on the rise, and with "The Mummy" she should 
graduate to a more well-known status. Once Imhotep is defeated (I'm not 
giving anything away since this is a given before you even walk into the 
theater), the film jumps back to life for the last ten minutes, in which 
they must race to get out of the underground city as it crashes down 
around them. 
A big-budget remake of "The Mummy" has been a much-sought after motion 
picture project since the mid-'80s, but such innovative directors as 
George Romero and Joe Dante had been turned down because the studio 
claimed that no straight-forward horror movie could succeed with a big 
budget. So what did Universal do instead? They traded in scares and 
suspense, not to mention far more impressive "mummy" designs (that can 
be seen in this month's issue of Fangoria Magazine), for a mainstream 
action-adventure directed by the newly-confirmed hack, Stephen Sommers, 
who obviously has no idea how to create tension, all in the name of a 
few extra box-office bucks. That's Hollywood for you.

Starring Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah. Rated PG-13.
I cherish energy in a movie. I cherish genuine wit even in the most
unlikely places. I cherish escapist fare that truly deserves that name -
- a movie that makes even the most critical of viewers forget it's own
faults (as well as the viewer's own troubles, if only for two hours),
sit back and enjoy. The Mummy is a movie I cherish.
The Mummy, believe it or not, is actually a remake of a 1932 horror film
of the same name and starring Boris Karloff. It is not a horror flick.
It's about a super-cool adventurer named O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) who
leads a young librarian (Rachel Weisz) and her brother (John Hannah) in
search of a forbidden Egyptian city. When they find it (quite easily, I
might add), the librarian screws up. She reads from a forbidden book and
that, you see, wakes up The Mummy (Aaron Vosloo), who has been stuck in
a tomb for thousands of years, has been given the powers to bring
horrible plagues on Egypt and needs human flesh and blood to regenerate.
>From the moment The Mummy awakens, director Stephen Sommers's (Deep
Rising) film goes into hyperdrive. It becomes a non-stop tirade of
special effects, action scenes and jokes. Damned if it doesn't work.
Throughout, The Mummy maintains a contageous sort of glee, a sense of
almost self-ridiculing facetiousness. It is the kind of movie where when
someone asks someone else what to do because the boat has been sabotaged
and is burning down, the other person responds "Stay here, I'll get
help" and jumps overboard. It's the kind of movie where the main
characters are constantly in jeopardy and yet the movie almost tells us
"Don't worry about them, look at that awesome wall of sand!"
Most of The Mummy is utter nonsense. Not only does the plot not make
sense, but the movie doesn't even make any attempts to justify it. This
is not a plot movie. All that matters is how the characters try to
escape their situation -- not even whether they escape, but how they go
about doing it. It's an excuse to showcase some eye-popping imagery, but
it's also a hell of a lot of fun.
The performances from Vosloo, Weisz and Fraser are barely worth
mentioning because they don't matter. I'm sure that their performances
are satisfactory, but if Stephen Sommers and his screenwriters could
have gotten rid of characters all together, they probably would have, so
the wall of sand could be the official star of the movie. The only
performance that bears any significance in The Mummy is that of John
Hannah -- the script has some ingeniously funny scenes reserved for him,
some of them eliciting applause from the audience (myself included).
There is a lot in this movie to hate. Cinematically, it's a piece of
crap. However, no human should be bored. Most should be greatly
entertained.
You have to get yourself in the right state of mind to enjoy this
picture. Don't look at it as a movie; view it rather as an outrageously
entertaining theme park ride. If you're not willing to strap yourself in
and drop your cinematic pretentions at the door -- don't go.
Š1999 Eugene Novikov

        Whether we like it or not, it has become standard practice for
Hollywood to remake classic films for modern audiences.  Stephen
Sommer's new cinematic retelling of "The Mummy" marks the first time
Universal Pictures has revisited one their most popular (and
profitable)
characters since the 1950s, a decade dominated dominated by cinematic
werewolves, vampires, and aliens.  Thanks to the popularity of the "B"
movie during this time period, the Mummy developed a loyal and
dedicated fan base.  The fact that he's back in theaters in '99 is not
nearly as surprising as the amount of time it took to get him there.
Is
the wait worth it?
        Early indications looked good-- the film has been receiving
favorable write-ups in entertainment magazines for a while now, and
innovative TV ads and a great trailer have only served to whet the
appetite of horror fans.  The thought of seeing a new story about one
of
the genre's premiere villains seemed like a great way to spend a
couple
of hours, and my expectations were high as the theater lights dimmed.
But alas, this movie won't go down as a classic, as some have
suggested; nor is it a modern "Raiders of the Lost Ark," although
portions of this movie are clearly inspired by it.  "The Mummy"
suffers
from a pace that borders on laconic, characters that are the epitome
of
cardboard, and a formulaic plot that's a little too neatly (ahem)
wrapped
up.
        The story opens with a splendidly filmed flashback.  Nearly
two
thousand years before the birth of Christ, an Egyptian priest named
Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) tempted fate by doing the unthinkable: falling
in
love with the Pharoah's mistress.  For this act of trechery, the
priest
was buried alive, and, for reasons I'm still not sure I understand,
imbued
with a curse: if his tomb is ever disturbed, the mummified priest will
come back to life and bring ten mighty plagues (the usual stuff:
locusts,
fireballs, turning water into blood, etc.) to Egypt.  (Why?  I have no
idea.)  But the Egyptians are so concerned that the priest will one
day
rise from his grave that they appoint a group of soldiers to guard his
temple (rather like the Holy Grail society in the third Indiana Jones
film).
This elite group is maintained over the millenia, with sons taking
their
father's places as they die.
        Flash forward to 1925, as Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and
his partners Johnathan (John Hannah, Gwyneth Paltrow's boyfriend in
"Sliding Doors") and Evelyn (Rachel Weisz, who looks like she's
desperately trying to be Kate Winslet) undertake an archaeological dig
in
the city of Hamunaptra.  No points for guessing what they find and
accidentally unleash while they're there.  Soon the locusts are a
buzzin'
and the sores are a runnin' as our explorers try to defeat the
reincarnated
Imhotep, who plans to imbue his mummified lover with Evelyn's spirit.
        With me so far?  Good... then perhaps you've already noticed
some
of the same problems that I did.  Let's start with the 'Guardians of
the
Priest's Tomb' concept.  Look, if the Egyptians are so concerned that
a
dead mummy might one day come back to life that they actually bred
generations of soldiers to guard his tomb, why not just burn the body?
For that matter, if this particular curse is such a dangerous one, why
cast it in the first place?  If the guy is that evil, why didn't they
just
kill him back in B.C. times and be done with it?  If they hadn't
cursed
him, he couldn't have come back to life later, and there'd be no need
to
breed generations of guards.  It seems like a silly loophole to me.
Or if
they simply *must* curse the poor guy, is it really wise to bury the
tools
needed to bring him back to life within easy reach of anyone who
should
happen to find the tomb?  Ever think about storing them somewhere
else,
guys?
        I have no problem with films that require little or no
thought;
indeed, if "The Mummy" hadn't caused me to think at all, I could at
least
have enjoyed it as a strictly visceral experience.  As it stands, I
spent a
lot of time mentally cataloguing the numerous plot inconsistencies and
contradications (of which the above paragraph is only the tip of the
iceberg) when I should've been paying attention to the eye candy and
special effects.  Spotting the various plot holes gave me more
enjoyment
than the movie itself.
        It's not all bad, though.  Much has been written about
Universal's
complete overhaul of the Mummy character, and I must admit that
they've
succeeded in making him pleasantly creepy.  Gone is the moaning,
slowly-walking man in the white bandages, replaced by a formidable (if
obviously computer-generated) opponent with complete mastery over the
elements.  The Mummy actually succeeds in becoming an interesting
character!  (Now that's a sentence I never thought I'd write.)  Too
bad he
appears in so little of the movie-- the film is halfway over before he
puts in his first appearance; hence the laconic pacing I referred to
earlier.  Brendan Fraser also does fine work in his first
"action-hero" role.
Although the script attempts to paint the character as an Indiana
Jones
clone, Fraser succeeds in rising above mediocre material and being
genuinely likeable, just as he did in "Blast From the Past."  This is
a
man who knows how to play up to a camera, and the audience absolutely
loved him.
        The second half of "The Mummy" is actually kinda fun, though
it's not extraordinary-- it's standard popcorn fare, with a lot of
action,
great special effects, and some audience-pleasing quips and humor.
The
tedious opening scenes, however, go on far too long and don't contain
enough relevent information to justify their length.  People don't go
to a
movie called "The Mummy" because they want to see people sitting
around a table talking; they go because they want to be scared, have
fun,
and root for someone (be it hero or villain).  The movie's second half
realizes this, and it's no surprise that it's the more rewarding of
the two.

'The Mummy' strikes a familiar chord along the lines of irreverent film
making in so much as that it turns out to be nothing more than popcorn
entertainment.  As this was clearly the intention, the hustle and bustle of
its sheer aim to please can't quite escape the fact that the film is out of
control, over the top, over simplified and overly dependent on special
effects.  There are few laughs because the campy humour isn't understood by
all, few injections of character fuel, and the film is like a rollercoaster
gone out of control.  Instead of building a slow momentum leading up to the
action sequences, the film is determined to make the hair on the back of
your neck stand up indefinitely in its second half and it never gives you a
chance to breathe and it feels all wrong.
'The Mummy' does deserve credit in several areas.  The first of which is its
look.  Designed to look and feel entirely different than the 1932 feature
with Boris Karloff (technology sort of makes it impossible to look like the
original I suppose), this film has impressive production designs, sweeping
special effects which are good but over done.  It's attempt to poke fun at
films like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and other movies of a similar nature
isn't necessarily a good thing.  Doesn't Hollywood leave the lampooning of
classic films to Leslie Nielsen?
Brendan Fraser stars as an American in the French Foreign Legion named Rick
O'Connell, who, on an archaeological dig at the ancient city of Hamunaptra
accidentally awakens the Mummy who is the evil Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) from
the days of the ancient Egypt around 1300 B.C. who was tortured, buried
alive and whose soul never laid down to rest upon his death and he seeks
revenge upon being awakened in what is now 1923.  O'Connell is joined in his
adventure by Evelyn Carnarvon (Rachel Weisz) and her brother Jonathan (John
Hannah).
The film might have come across better if it had a few big name and
experienced stars to carry it during its weak spots the way Jack Nicholson
carried 1989's 'Batman' through some of its weaker areas when the film
seemed like it was sagging and Nicholson's clear improvisation saved it from
collapsing.  The budget looked so big in 'The Mummy' that I suppose there
was little chance of latching onto a big name when most of them now command
20 million dollars a picture which is approximately 1/5 of a big studio
film's standard budget.
Director Stephen Sommers ('Deep Rising') makes the fatal mistake of allowing
the film to run over two hours (124 minutes to be exact).  'The Mummy' feels
like a marathon runner's feet at the end of a long run.  It's tiresome.
There's no doubt that the film is great to look at on the big screen in many
instances but the audience I saw it with had a lot of kids and after seeing
the look on the face of many parents in the crowd I think they realized the
film wasn't exactly a family adventure and the film definitely isn't for
young children under the age of 12.
On the veteran's end of the scale, 'The Mummy' has some redeeming
satisfactions.  Oscar winner and multiple nominee Jerry Goldsmith is
responsible for the film's sweeping original score and Oscar nominated
camera man Adrian Biddle ('Thelma and Louise') gives the movie a gleaming
and refined look of beauty.
Every entity has a weakness that leads to its destruction.  Superman had
Kryptonite, the Death Star had a hole two metres wide and the Blob had the
cold.  'The Mummy' has the distinction of being the type of film that over
uses special effects and doesn't have enough of anything else and it should
have realized that when special effects are involved, sometimes less is
indeed more.

MUMMY, THE (director/writer: Stephen Sommers; cinematographer: Adrian
Biddle; editor: Bob Ducsay; cast: Brendan Fraser (Rick O'Connell),
Rachel Weisz (Evelyn), John Hannah (Jonathan), Kevin J. O'Connor (Beni),
Arnold Vosloo (Imhotep), Jonathan Hyde (Egyptologist), Oded Fehr (Ardeth
Bay), Bernard Fox (Capt. Winston Havlock), Erick Avari (Dr. Bey, the
Curator), 1999)
A spoof on the 1932 horror classic The Mummy, in which Boris Karloff
played a dead priest who returns to life and falls in love with the
pretty girl he feels is the reincarnation of the woman he died for.
Unfortunately, in this ridiculous remake, the two films are only the
same in name only; though, in the broad sense they are both about a
three thousand year Egyptian curse. This Mummy put me into a petulant
adolescent mind-set, as I found myself madly screaming for more script,
more story, more tomes, after seeing this stinker and found that I could
only calm my rage by going to the video tape of the original Mummy and
seeing again for myself how richly quaint that film actually was.
This is a film that lives for the cliché, even relishes in it, flaunting
it as the reason the film was made in the first place. It is so much
like those thrashy "B" films in the early 1950s I saw on a Saturday
matinee, where the theater was so noisy the elderly matrons who were the
ushers looked like they were having conniptions, as they marched down
the aisles with their flashlights shining on the children with
loudmouths. Those were the "good old days," when you got to see two
pictures like this for the price of one, and didn't give a hoot how
raucous the theater crowd was, and how dumb and unbelievable the hero
was. This film is a return to that dumbness, only this time its appeal
is targeted for a more mature crowd and the price of the movie ticket
has skyrocketed.
This is a children's serial adventure thriller, the Indiana Jones kind
but without that film's charismatic actors. It is about a high priest,
Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), who couldn't keep his hands off his lover, the
pharaoh's daughter, and was tortured to death by the pharoah when he was
caught in the act. As his punishment he is "mummified alive," sealed
inside a sarcophagus with scores of flesh-eating scarab beetles (which
take their time in killing him). If his tomb is opened, and if he is
brought back to life, he will "bring about a walking disease," and
unleash the 10 proverbial plagues upon Egypt and the world. So wouldn't
you know it, his tomb is opened inadvertently by some ugly American
tourists.
Sometime in the 1920s, an American French foreign legionnaire named Rick
O'Connell (Fraser) is fortunate to have an Egyptian scholar and
librarian named Evelyn (Weisz), the plucky English woman, save him from
being hung. She does so because he knows how to find the hidden city
(having escaped from there once before) where the dead pharoahs are
mummified and lots of gold is buried. He joins with her and her annoying
brother Jonathan (Hannah) in their adventure, as fortune hunters, to
find Hamunaptra, the City of the Dead.
Rick is one cool guy, with a self-deprecating sense of humor, with an
unflappable personality, and with one eye for beauty and the other for
battle: in other words, a man's man. His mission in this film is
threefold: to rescue the damsel in distress, kill the bad guy, and save
the world. He teams up with the infatuated Evelyn, who pines for him
with bated breath and also earnestly digs being an expert in mummies.
They race to the cursed city against other American fortune hunters and
their lackey leading them there, who is named Beni (O' Connor). The
heroine tells us that this lackey is so wormy a character that he will
surely get his come-uppance by the time the film ends. There are also
bands of mysterious, black-robed nomads, who have something to do with
keeping tourists away from the lost city.The other so-called delights in
this special effect and overlong film, are the gibberish messages read
from the holy books, the one-liners coming off the lips of the
characters faster than the bullets from their blazing guns, and all the
free-spirited action scenes, that are non-stop, giving the film a
lighter than lighthearted look to it. Excuse me, for not finding this
nonsense film funny or even entertaining!  After seeing mummies becoming
undead and rising from the sand and enough gruesome killings to last me
a few milleniums, all I can say is, Mummies!

This is not your grandfather's "The Mummy."
Not to be misunderstood, Boris Karloff as the ancient priest Imhotep was 
quite menacing - face crinkled in leathery evil, stare capable of sending 
chills clear from the early 1930's.
But this is the turn of another century, and modern audiences would yawn at 
all but two minutes of the original "Mummy."  The new incarnation is a 
supercharged 127 -minute melee, most of it successful in mixing a decent 
plot with flatly amazing special effects.  The best element, though, is the 
fun.
You want to hear about the monster, don't you?  It's a hybrid of booger-men 
from various mythologies:  it's a good thing, I think, that there's 
originality here.  The producers would not have won had they gone with a 
Karloff-esque copy.  Anyhow, this Imhotep is a viscid corpse, suddenly 
animated through the most unfortunate of coincidences.  It's a manifestation 
out of Anne Rice, not only stable but agile, nimble despite parts of its 
anatomy skeletal or missing.  Its heritage is traceable to the vampire, as 
it somehow drains the vital liquids from its victims, enabling itself to 
regenerate.  Once it is whole (and the men who opened the forbidden book are 
grotesque husks), Imhotep is supposedly invincible, inflicting upon the 
modern world (the mid-1920's) the plagues of ancient Egypt.
The forces charged with stopping him include the mercenary Rick O'Connell 
(Brendan Frasur), who a few years previously was accosted by the evil forces 
lurking about Imhotep's desert tomb.  His help is enlisted by the pretty 
English Egyptologist Evie (Rachel Weisz), and her sometimes sober brother 
Jonathan (John Hannah).  Their caravan just happens to converge with another 
Egyptologist (the wonderful Jonathan Hyde) leading a band of greedy cowboys. 
  Their guide is the despicable Beni (Kevin J. O'Connor) who, along with 
O'Connor, happens to know the location of the legendary City of the Dead.    
After these expeditions simultaneously uncover different parts of the 
pernicious burial chambers, the mummy is awakened, members of the parties 
are hunted like bugs - and at times by bugs - and the "beginning of the end" 
commences, the horizon blackened by locusts and other harbingers of doom.
Possibly the most watchable moments involve close combat between the heroes 
and legions of re-animated mummies, the bodyguards of the condemned assassin 
Imhotep.  These shuddering soldiers appear as rapidly as the bony marauders 
from "Jason and the Argonauts," attacking O'Connell and losing their heads 
to his swift broadsword.  It's over-the-top and delicious footage, causing 
more chuckling than gasping.  We're also treated to the super-hero-like 
antics of fleet, shield- and spear-wielding mummies.  At once scary, gross 
and humorous, these scenes are a typical use of state-of-the-art technology. 
  They're cool, and they do the job of helping to tell an incredible story.
There are other complications of plot, of course.  A secret society, 
descendants of the guardians of the murdered pharaoh, is endeavoring to 
scare away the tomb raiders.  Before the mummy and his bedraggled ghouls, 
these black-clad preservers of order serve as the main baddies;  their role 
changes soon, as their tattooed leader sports a heavy machine gun to fight 
on O'Connell's side.  Legions of supernatural scarabs, by the way, 
contribute mayhem whenever they can, skittering around and de-fleshing 
whatever's in their way.
The imagery in the film is also cool.  Early on, O'Connell is cornered by 
enemy soldiers on horseback.  Suddenly the attackers retreat, and the sands 
around O'Connell stir violently, leaving the impression of a horrible face, 
mouth gaping in agony.  Later we see the face in the awesome wall of a 
sandstorm, as well as on the slack-jawed mummy himself.
Brendan Frasur is passable as an action hero.  Of course the premise is very 
different here than in "George of the Jungle."  What's in large part 
responsible for Frasur's success is the surplus of action scenes.  The guy 
is still very muscular from the George role, and seems practiced in running 
and handling firearms, many times blasting pistols in both hands.  At a 
couple of points Frasur is even allowed to deliver self-reflexive humor, 
commenting, "That happens a lot around here," when a sudden breeze 
foreshadows the presence of evil.  Frasur does not have the comic timing of 
Harrison Ford, and does not convince us in O'Connell's stubborn refusal to 
deliver more than his mercenary services are paid for.
The brother and sister team gets the job done.  John Hannah plays a good 
drunk, his Jonathan a wily rascal who seems cowardly but is ultimately 
dependable.  Rachel Weisz as Evelyn is good-looking in an unusual way, and 
gains our sympathy especially after the reanimated priest kidnaps her in 
order to raise from the dead his love from long ago.
Character roles are well-cast.  Kevin J. O'Connor as Beni is terrifically 
snake-like, betraying his friends at the least monetary provocation, and 
even working for the mummy, which holds out gold jewelry in the exposed 
cartilage of its hand.  The venerable Bernard Cox, veteran of countless film 
and television forays, plays a Royal Air Force officer looking for the 
danger he never quite found in war.  Arnold Vosloo, the South African actor 
who portrays Imhotep, is appropriately menacing, the ethnicity of his visage 
indistinguishable, like Anthony Quinn's.
One reason I hope the film engenders sequels is that the ones that followed 
the original "The Mummy" were so full of campy fun.  I'll be honest:  I 
wouldn't want to watch films like this every week, but on a spring evening, 
after a long day's work in the office or in the sun, there's nothing like 
the formulaic spectacle of a sharp "B" film.
"The Mummy" is rated PG-13 for excessive violence and partial nudity.  It's 
the stuff of nightmares for any viewers with vivid imaginations, a likable 
throwback in a genre I'm glad has been brought back to life!

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Remember that FOX special a few months back - the one where their crack
news crew got permission to bust into some ancient Egyptian tombs a la
Geraldo Rivera's ill-fated Al Capone vault fiasco from the 80s?  I had
a bad feeling that it was either (a) staged, as FOX doesn't have the
highest reputation for journalistic integrity, or (b) a very elaborate
commercial for the remake of the 1932 Boris Karloff classic, The Mummy.
Although I don't think it was either (a) or (b)  it was too boring to
be staged and the film comes from FOX rival Universal  the television
special was still rather fascinating and will, no doubt, inadvertently
help to fuel big box office numbers for the action-heavy/story-light
$80-million horror picture.
Written and directed by Stephen Sommers (Deep Rising), The Mummy opens
about 3000 years in the past, when some overly jealous Egyptian king
catches his bride with Imhotep, the High Priest of Osiris (Arnold
Vosloo, Zeus & Roxanne). Imhotep is buried alive with these nasty,
flesh-eating beetles and his tomb is guarded for centuries and centuries
because  get this  if he ever comes back to life, he will be a walking
plague on Earth.  Which may explain why he looks a lot like Billy Zane.
Maybe they should have put a poster for The Phantom on the tomb entrance
as well.
Flash forward to the early part of the 20th century, when French Legion
soldier Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser, Blast From the Past) stumbles
onto a map to Imhotep's evil crypt, but is eventually run off by its
guardians.  His interest is understandably piqued because of the legend
that Imhotep was buried along with his vast treasures.  Unfortunately
for O'Connell, most people believe that it is, in fact, just a legend.
O'Connell is able to hook up with a wacky brother/sister team that agree
to accompany him in his search for the lost sepulcher.  Evelyn Carnarvon
(Rachel Weisz, Chain Reaction) is a bumbling student of ancient Egypt
and her brother Jonathan (John Hannah, Sliding Doors) is just eager to
get his hands on some riches.  Just to liven things up a bit, there is
also a rival group of grave-robbers that simultaneously begin their trek
with our heroes.
Now, here's the problem  you don't see the Mummy until about two-thirds
of the way into the film.  When he's on the screen, it's really cool,
but then he turns back into the human Imhotep after about two minutes.
Here's another problem  Fraser is too simian to carry a film.  People
were surprised at how good he was in Gods & Monsters, but it was just
because he wasn't the star.  George of the Jungle?  His six-pack was the
real star of that film.  Blast From the Past was in and out of theaters
in two weeks because he kept his shirt on (he does here, too).
The Mummy tries very hard to be like The Raiders of the Lost Ark, but
it's much closer to last year's corny bore, The Mask of Zorro.  It is a
beautiful film, thanks to cinematographer Adrian Biddle (The Butcher
Boy), and also features some very funny supporting roles, including
Kevin J. O'Connor (Peggy Sue Got Married) and Dr. Bombay from
Bewitched.  Although its trailer gives the indication that the Mummy's
presence would be greater and that the film would offer non-stop special
effects, it can boast only a weak story, a crappy romance and a running
time that is forty minutes too long.  (2:11  PG-13 for violence and
brief nudity)

As a summer movie, The Mummy does not disappoint. It's a great, popcorn movie
that's a blend of comedy and action, and which is for all intents and purposes,
a poor man's Indiana Jones. As a horror movie living up to the original, it
falls more than a bit short. The movie opens with a rather corny, though
appropriate telling of how the mummy came to be. We're then taken to Egypt in
1923, where the French Foreign legion (led by Brendan Fraser after his
commander turns tail and runs)  is fighting a band of Desert raiders. The
foreign legion is crushed, and we're taken to Cairo, where we meet Evelyn and
Jonathan. Siblings who've found a map to the city of the dead. they then
proceed to wake the mummy, and the fun begins.
First of all, don't go into this film expecting a ghoulish horror movie. For
the most part, the movie is actually an action/comedy. Secondly, this film has
no deep, meaningful messages. This is pure movie going fun. As for acting, I
must commend Brendan Fraser. Normally I'm not a large fan of his, but his comic
abilities really shine here. Rachael Weisz and John Hannah both do respectable
jobs, and Arnold Vosloo is quite menacing as the title character. Though the
fact of the matter is, the mummy is usually shown as a CGI creation. 
The only real problems I had with the entire film, were the lack of horror, and
the fact that the movie never really figured out what kind of movie it wanted
to be. I frankly went in, expecting a Horror movie with comic bits thrown in.
While I still got a good, fun movie, it just wasn't what I was hoping for
personally. The other problem, is that the film switches from being deadly
serious at parts, to mocking itself at others, and then back again. Perhaps
being warned in advance of the lack of horror will help readers to enjoy the
movie more. I simply hope that when the sequal is made (and I guarantee they'll

     I am reminded of a favorite line from the Coen brothers' 1991 film
BARTON FINK in this era of the wildly over-produced blockbuster.  Barton
Fink, an intellectual writer who has come to Hollywood in the early 1940s,
reports to his studio boss that he's having trouble getting started on his
first assignment, a wrestling film starring Wallace Beery.  The baffled 
mogul responds, "Wallace Beery, wrestling picture...what do you need, a
road map?"  When it comes to genre film-making, there's an easy way to get
the audience to respond the way you want them to respond, and there's the
way writer/director Stephen Sommers chooses to craft his remake of THE
MUMMY.  Rarely has a film exterted so much narrative effort to say so
little.
     That narrative begins in 1719 B.C., where the Egyptian high priest
Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), after an affair with the Pharaoh's mistress, is
buried alive to carry a curse on the world should he ever be awakened.
Flash forward to 1923, where soldier of fortune Nick O'Connell (Brendan
Fraser) discovers the lost city of Hamunaptra, legendary site of untold
treasure and -- unbeknownst to anyone -- Imhotep's tomb.  Flash forward
again three years, where Egyptologist/librarian Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) and
her ne'er-do-well brother Jonathan (John Hannah) learn that the jailed
O'Connell knows the location of Hamunaptra, and win his freedom in
exchange for his aid.  Thus begins a journey to the lost city which
results in the release of Imhotep, who emerges into the 20th century with
a mission, an attitude and a whole lot of nasty supernatural powers.
     Unlike the 1932 original, this version is more action-adventure than
horror, focusing on derring-do over scaring-do.  It certainly delivers its
share of fight sequences; some of them are even fairly rousing, combining
unique visual effects with narrow escapes and a dose of visual humor.  The
echoes of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK are obvious, but THE MUMMY may actually
owe an equal debt to Sam Raimi's ARMY OF DARKNESS in its attempts at
supernatural slapstick.  Though nowhere near the level of the "Indiana
Jones" films -- and indeed, not even necessarily at the level of ARMY OF
DARKNESS -- THE MUMMY at times manages to deliver the goods.
     The goals of a film like THE MUMMY should be fairly simple, yet
Sommers manages to miss the point entirely over and over again.  The plot
summary above doesn't do remote justice to the sacks of exposition,
extraneous plot threads and go-nowhere characters with which THE MUMMY is
burdened.  The film takes forever to set up the premise, with the
exploration party finally reaching Hamunaptra at about the one hour mark.
Unnecessary complications ensue with the inclusion of a rival team of
explorers guided by a sniveling former colleague of O'Connell's (Kevin J.
O'Connor), increasing the body count in the least efficient manner
possible.  The danger to Evelyn -- targeted by Imhotep as part of his plan
to resurrect his former love -- is buried beneath the ten plagues of
Egypt, which Imhotep conveniently controls to allow for some more cool
special effects.  There's no economy to THE MUMMY, no understanding of how
to create a solid hero, a solid villain and a solid conflict and let the
action roll.
     It would be easy enough to snipe at the dopey dialogue and silly
performances in THE MUMMY -- I'm still waiting for someone to convince me
that Brendan Fraser has leading-man charm -- especially since it would
deserve every snipe.  There are a few clever touches, but mostly Sommers
seems to show the typical blockbuster disdain for characters and 
situations which do anything more than set up the next effects shot.  Yet
such complaints miss the point that THE MUMMY isn't even a good brainless
action film with its lumbering pacing.  All the jaw-dropping visual
trickery in the world doesn't help if a film wanders around in circles
before pulling out its "A" material.  Groan if you must, but THE MUMMY
needed to be wrapped up much more tightly.  The Mummy, horror
picture...what do you need, a road map?

        Do you remember that scene towards the end of "Raiders of the Lost
Ark," when the Nazi's jimmy open the Ark of the Covenant and those
screaming, smoke-like furies emerge, melting the bad guys' flesh right off
the bone and leaving large puddles of goo on the floor?
        Well, that's pretty much the tone of "The Mummy," a
just-in-time-for-Mother's-Day update of one of those old Universal horror
films of the '30s in which a dusty old geezer in bandages staggered around
scaring the bejeebers out of well-meaning archeologists and late-night TV
watchers like you and me.
        1999's "The Mummy," which stars Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, and a
tombful of special effects, falls somewhere between "Romancing the Stone"
and "From Dusk Till Dawn," a far cry from the original series of films
about an embalmed Egyptian looking to reincarnate his lost love.
        Let's just say that the unintentional humor in the Boris Karloff
version was a lot funnier than the intentional stuff here.
        As if the tongue-in-cheek approach isn't trying enough, the
134-minute film eventually wears you down with its non-stop assault on the
senses once high priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo, the only person playing it
straight in the movie) is reawakened some 3,000 years after being buried
alive for getting it on with his pharaoh's mistress.  With only a bucketful
of flesh-eating scarab beetles for company, no wonder he's in a bad mood!
        Those responsible for Imhotep's reemergence are an unlikely bunch
of 1920's gravediggers made up of a charmless librarian (Weisz), her
unctuous brother, and a death-row legionnaire called Rick O'Connell who
claims to know the location of the treasure-laden City of the Dead.  For a
brief spell they're joined by a corrupt prison official who agrees to free
O'Connell for an appreciable percentage of the spoils, but he makes the
mistake of complaining about hating bugs...
        The longer the film goes on, the more the chills give way to
slapstick.  Since there's so much silliness to contend with, you can't help
but chuckle every now and again.  John Hannah (as the brother) serves up
some decent laughs, but it's Fraser who seems to be having the most fun
with his role of O'Connell, even if his character seems closer to George of
the Jungle than Indiana Jones.  Weisz's character is pretty lifeless so
it's just as well that her relationship with O'Connell takes a back seat to
all that mummy-busting dering-do.
        If you go in expecting "The Mummy" to be a straitlaced adventure
flick or even a horror film, you'll be disappointed.  But if you anticipate
a dopey "Raiders" wannabe with some occasional scares, numerous gross-out
scenes, and enough special effects and inane attempts at humor to overload
three movies, you'll probably enjoy it a whole lot more.

It is the time of the ancient Egyptians, and the pharaoh's mistress is
one of the most beautiful women in all the land, coveted so greatly
that he forbids her to even be touched by another man.  Little does he
know that the enchanting Anck-Su-Namum has been doing a little fooling
around with the pharaoh's priest of the dead, Imhotep, until the
pharoah catches the both of them red-handed.  Stabbed in the back by
this traitorous act, he gets stabbed in the back once again and for
good by the happy couple.  Unfortunately for them, the pharaoh's
guards burst in to find their ruler murdered and proceed to take the
lovers into custody.  Of course, when you're talking ancient Egypt,
you know they're not just going to the slammer.  Anck-Su-Namum is
killed, and Imhotep is mummified alive, with a few hundred
flesh-eating scarabs for company in his sarcophagus.  But that's not
all!  No, a terrible curse is placed upon his body which will haunt
him in the afterlife.  One trick, though.  If he is ever exhumed, he
will return to the earth as a plague upon mankind.  Well, there's
always a catch, isn't there?
Skip ahead a few thousand years to 1923, where Jonathan (John Hannah)
has come into possession of a rare Egyptian artifact.  He just wants
to sell it, but when his Egyptologist sister Evelyn (Rachel Weisz)
opens the artifact and inside finds a map to the lost city of
Hamunaptra, where a trove of the pharoah's treasure supposedly exists,
they enlist the help of former French Foreign Legionnaire Rick
O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and embark upon a journey to rediscover the
lost city.  The problem is, they're not the only ones looking for the
city and its treasure.  Three Americans and another Egyptologist, lead
by Rick's former comrade-in-arms Beni (Kevin J. O'Connor) are also on
the hunt, and upon their arrival at the Hamunaptra ruins, accidentally
release our old friend Imhotep, wrapped up in a thirst for revenge
against the world.
For those of you looking for an honest-to-goodness scare, look
elsewhere because director Stephen Sommers' approach is definately a
departure from what we're used to.  Sure, there are some suspenseful
moments, and a few instances where you catch your breath in your
throat, but for the most part THE MUMMY is an action-oriented flick
interlaced with a decent amount of humor.  Sommers obviously didn't
want to gross people out or make them scream, but just give them a
good time instead.  Keep in mind, however, that "a good time" is a
relative term.
The change in approach is due in part to the mummy Imhotep himself.
You see, the mummy in THE MUMMY isn't like the ones we've seen in
black and white on late night television, arms out in front, slowly
moving forward toward its victim.  No, this one is able to change
itself into a whirlwind to move itself across the desert, convert
itself into a pile of sand in order to slip through a keyhole, and
overall just kick some serious ass very quickly.  Whereas the thing
about the old mummy was that it was slow, but it was going to get you
no matter how long it took, this one is much more conducive to an
action film.  After all, think about how boring it would be to try and
revolve an action sequence around a walking Ace bandage moving at a
quarter mile an hour.  This one is the full blown action mummy with
kung-fu grip.
Brendan Fraser's O'Connell also contributes to the action tone, being
a stock character for one of these films.  O'Connell is brash,
confident, full of bravado, but also completely competant.  You'd
expect to see a guy like him come walking out of an adventure novel.
Fraser plays him well, imbuing O'Connell with enough charisma to make
us forget that it seems totally normal to him that he's going to have
to go and kill this guy who's already supposed to be dead.  Rachel
Weisz's Evelyn similarly fits right into this film as the book smart,
but unworldly damsel.  Whereas Fraser plays his part with aplomb,
however, Weisz does little to distinguish this movie heroine from
countless others in the annals of movie history, an admittedly
difficult task when the script provides little help.  The rest of the
characters are pretty much in the film to fill in the requisite slots,
and it's too bad that the script doesn't offer them more than the
standard fare.
Visually, this film has some top-notch effects, most notably when it
comes to rendering Imhotep.  Starting off as a decaying corpse, the
mummy hunts down those who released him in order to take their vital
organs for his own.  As he becomes whole, he "fills out" so that at
any given time, he's part live and part dead to some degree, and the
line between real and computer generated is virtually unnoticable.
Unfortunately, while THE MUMMY presents us with a very unconventional
mummy movie, it's still a very conventional action adventure film,
complete with such cliches as the old washed up guy who gets to prove
himself one last time, the ever popular leaning against a wall and
revealing a hidden passage to a secret room, and not just one, but two
people getting done in because of their own greed.  THE MUMMY gives us
virtually nothing new, and therein lies its ultimate downfall.  I
don't think everyone wants to watch a film that just has more of the
same stuff you've seen in so many other films - except oh, yeah, this
one has a mummy.

What do you get when you combine old fashioned Indiana Jones-style
adventure with modernized special effects? Well, the result would look
something like The Mummy.
Sort of.
For hidden behind all the action, gun-fire and spiritual malarkey you'd
expect lies a very goofy foundation. As the opening scene suggests, this
remake often relies on self-parody and comic timing just as much as it
does with it's adventurous tone.
The movie begins in ancient Egypt, where a Priest named Imhotep (Arnold
Vosloo) is fooling around with the Pharaoh's daughter. The grisly
consequences entail that Imhotep be wrapped in bandages and incarcerated
for eternity in his tight-fitting sarcophagus. He is buried with a
terrible curse: anyone who wakes him will suffer the 10 Plagues of
Egypt, and will be used as spare parts for reanimation purposes.
Sure enough, in 1920, two expedition teams have set out to find the
treasure at Humunaptra (the legendary `City of the Dead'). One is led by
Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser), a rag-tag legion soldier who knows how
to handle himself. Accompanying him is a hieroglyphics-reading librarian
(Rachel Weisz) and her smart-mouth brother (John Hannah).
Then, of course, they awake the title character. Soon enough,
flesh-eating scarab-beetles, pesky locusts and walking corpses are after
them, and Imhotep is out to reconstruct himself and resurrect his
mummified bride. The special effects in The Mummy are not seamlessly
blended into the atmosphere, but they are rather excellent; the `wall of
sand' effect towards the finale is particularly effective. Fraser looks
surprisingly suited to this newfound role, and watching his form strikes
just the right balance in this ridiculously enjoyable
adventure/comedy/romance/horror- yes, it's complete funhouse of a movie.
Director Stephen Sommers is much better when it comes to adventure (The
Jungle Book) than horror (Deep Rising), which is why I am glad he put
such a unique spin on this classic remake. The jokes fly fast and
furious, mostly derived from Hannah's spirited performance and the
presence of Kevin J. O'Connor as the leader of the second expedition.
I'm embarrassed to say it, but I did laugh more than once. Okay, several
times. Even so, the consistent, familiar punchlines grow seriously old
as the movie progresses.
The Mummy is just stupid fun, no more. Fraser has battles with the
bandaged monsters, slicing off limbs with a delightful goofiness that
seems closely akin to Sam Raimi's Evil Dead movies. If you want a
blockbuster full of thrills and chills, this is not the movie to see.
The Mummy is silly, stereotypical, but above all, it's totally
enjoyable.

In the '30's and '40's, Universal produced a series of horror
films (featuring Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney) about a resurrected
Mummy seeking vengeance on those who disturbed his tomb.  Eager for a
crowd pleasing hit, Universal has whisked the dust off the character
and unwrapped it for a new generation.  Rather than a straight horror
film, this $80 million version of The Mummy is a rollicking good
adventure yarn in a similar vein to the popular Indiana Jones series.
The Mummy is perfect Saturday afternoon matinee material, albeit with
a distinctly '90's sensibility and a sophisticated edge.
The action of The Mummy takes place in Egypt in 1925.  The
B-grade Indiana Jones-type character here is Rick O'Connell (Brendan
Fraser), a foreign legionnaire who knows the location to Humanaptra,
the mythical lost city of ancient Egypt.  He is hired by virginal
librarian and amateur archaeologist Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz,
from Swept From The Sea, etc) to lead an expedition to the buried city
and its reputed treasure trove.
Along the way they encounter a rival expedition, led by Kevin
J O'Connor, which has less scholarly pursuits in mind.  However, when
they find the city they unwittingly unleash the ferocious power of
Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), an evil priest buried alive 3000 years
earlier for murdering the pharaoh, and are forced to join forces to
battle his supernatural powers.  Imhotep brings with him numerous
Biblical plagues as well as legions of undead, which he turns loose on
the modern world.  He also sets his sights on using Evelyn as a human
sacrifice in order to resurrect his dead lover.  Director Stephen
Sommers, best known for his live action version of The Jungle Book,
brings plenty of pace and excitement to the film.  He also maintains a
wonderful tongue in cheek approach throughout this entertaining yarn.
Cast largely against type as the swashbuckling hero Fraser is
superb, and he brings an enthusiasm, physicality, and sense of humour
to the role that ideally captures the film's tone.  Weisz brings a
combination of vulnerability and strength to her role as the bookish
Evelyn, who is suddenly out of her depth when fighting centuries old
curses.  John Hannah (from Sliding Doors, etc) adds much comic relief
as Evelyn's roguish brother Jonathan, although his occasionally
irritating character is something of a cliché.
Unlike another recent big budget sci-fi blockbuster currently
screening around town, the impressive array of digitally created
special effects on display here serve only to beef up the story.  The
effects, especially those that recreate fierce sandstorms and
re-animate skeletal armies, are superb and enhance the fanciful
material.  The Mummy is ideal entertainment, and heaps more fun than
the over hyped The Phantom Menace.

The summer movie season is always the biggest and brightest season for movies
throughout the year.  We are introduced to blockbuster hits that are usually
trashed by critics, loved by the people, and make tons of money at the box
office.  This year, the tradition continues with an update on the Universal
1932 classic, The Mummy.  I have always been a sucker for this kind of monster
movies, and I always seem to be the only critic who really likes them.  That
tradition continues as well with this fun special effects extravaganza.
In The Mummy, the up and coming Brendan Fraser stars as the adventurous
explorer Rick O'Connell.  He teams up with a curious, clumsy librarian named
Evelyn, played by Rachel Weisz, to find the mysterious city of the dead,
Hamunaptra.  Evelyn loves Egypt, and would truly like to visit the city that
people call a fable.  Rick has claimed he has been to Hamunaptra during a
battle, and that's why she chose him to lead her there.  Also tagging along on
the journey to the city of the dead is Evelyn's brother, Jonathan, played by
John Hannah (Sliding Doors).
Now in Hamunaptra, the three uncover "The Book of the Dead."  The curious
Evelyn unlocks the book, reads from it, and now the body of the ancient
Egyptian Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) becomes alive and is out to kill the ones who
opened and read from the book.  Along with Imhotep arising from the dead, the
Ten Curses of Egypt become in full effect, launching unbelievable forces
against the three and another group who set out to find Hamunaptra.  Not only
is Imhotep furious with those who awoke him, he is also out to restore the life
of his girlfriend that lost her life long ago in ancient Egypt.
Don't expect huge things out of The Mummy, but just expect to have a good time.
 This movie is extremely campy and plays out like an old horror film with
beefed up special effects, which may turn off some viewers.  On the other hand,
this type of film is one of my favorites, but that's up to you to decide.
There is one thing that definitely not campy or corny about The Mummy though. 
The state of the art special effects take you into a completely different
world.  We are dazzled by faces rising out of the desert, swarms of beetles and
locusts, and even creatures crawling under a human's skin.  These may have been
in other movies before, but not like in The Mummy.  As of now, The Mummy holds
the title for best special effects of this year, but all this could change when
Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace is released into theaters across the
country.
In the past, Brendan Fraser has played mainly comedic roles.  When playing
"George" in Disney's George of the Jungle, he was mainly not known by anyone. 
I would say that Gods and Monsters is the film that gave him a name, and now
The Mummy will give him a name amongst teens.  In The Mummy, Fraser gets to
play an action hero, and I liked him in this sort of role over the comedic
role, as in the films Blast From the Past and George of the Jungle.
Although Brendan Fraser is great, Rachel Weisz gives the best performance among
the cast.  Weisz really reminded me of a character from an old, horror film. 
The way she acts, looked, and talked all reminded me of someone not from this
time.  Evelyn is probably the only character that was likable, considering that
the other characters, like John Hannah's, didn't get much personal attention.
In many films, when different genres are mixed, the mixing usually works, and I
like it for the most part.  In The Mummy though, not all of the mixing works. 
There are some scenes that have a lot of potential horror, some with potential
comedy, some with potential drama, and some with potential pure action, but the
film tries to mix them together too often for the mixing to work.  The Mummy
could have gotten an
"A" rating from me if it had gone purely with one of these.  I didn't mind the
corny one-liners here and there during action sequences, but it certainly could
have done without them.  
The cinematography is amazing in The Mummy.  Particularly in one scene
depicting ancient Egypt, we are taken into a very fun portrayal of Egypt,
mummies, and the treasures left behind by the ancient Egyptians.  The costume
design in the film is also up there with the great cinematography.  From
ancient Egyptians outfits to original troops outfits, the costumes are always
top notch.
The Bottom Line- With The Mummy, the summer is off to its usually great start.

 The Mummy (1999) 1 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Brendan Fraser, Rachel
Weisz, John Hannah and Arnold Vosloo.
 At its core, the original version of "The Mummy" was a story of lost love.
 A priest in ancient Egypt loses his princess and, after her death, commits
blasphemy by trying to use a forbidden incantation to raise her from the
dead.
 He is caught, condemned and buried alive. Much later - 3,700 years later -
he is unearthed and accidentally brought back to life. This living mummy
then helps a team of archeologists find the tomb of his lost love so he can
again try to read that same spell and bring her back to life.
 It was the stellar performance of Boris Karloff that was the main
attraction to this - by today's standards - creaky and somewhat campy
horror film.
 The action-packed remake of this venerable classic owes more to Steven
Spielberg and George Lucas than to the Universal studio filmmakers of the
early 1930s.
 For the new version of "The Mummy" isn't a horror film. It's more a
combination of many things - Indiana Jones rip-off, Foreign Legion
adventure, Cecil B. DeMille extravaganza and video game shoot-'em-up.
 This remake of "The Mummy" may be bigger and incorporate the latest
technology in computer special effects, but it definitely is not better.
 It lacks the two key ingredients that made the original a classic -
atmosphere and sincerity.
 "The Mummy," starring Brendan Fraser, cannot decide what coat to wear. It
continually changes from adventure to horror to spoof, never settling on
one course. It also lacks the romanticism of the original.
 That much you learn at the outset. Instead of the priest, Imhotep (Arnold
Vosloo), being in love with pharaoh's daughter, he and the pharaoh's
mistress are two-timing the Egyptian ruler. He catches them, and they
assassinate him.
 Captured themselves, she is killed while he, like in the original, is
buried alive. However, because of the nature of today's movie audiences,
some embellishments are added for thrills. Imhotep has his tongue cut out
and a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs are dumped into his sarcophagus.
 The story then leaps forward to the Egyptian desert of the 1920s. A band
of legionnaires, among them daredevil and dashing Rick O'Connell (Fraser),
is battling a group of nomads in the ruins of the ancient, legendary city
of Hamunaptra. It's a scene straight out of "March or Die," as O'Connell,
the only survivor, is allowed to wander off into the desert.
 A couple of years later, O'Connell teams up with a brother-sister pair of
treasure-hunting archeologists (Rachel Weisz and John Hannah) to again find
Hamunaptra and carry off its treasures.
 And just for fun, there's another expedition, racing to the same locale.
 Of course, they find the city and inadvertently unleash the dead Imhotep,
who is not your slow, stiff-walking, bandage-wrapped dead Egyptian.
 No, thanks to computer technology, he can change into sand and be gone
with the wind.
 He goes after members of the expeditions, stealing their body organs to
assist in his regeneration, so he can resurrect his girlfriend and
together, they can conquer the world.
 "The Mummy" is not dull. It's action-laden in that outlandish, cartoonish
way most modern films treat such enterprises. People are mauled, beaten,
wounded, but, just like video game characters, they pop right back up and
return for more.
 Fraser is actually quite good. He gets into the spirit of the proceedings,
and keeps his tongue in cheek. He knows this is a lark and goes along for
the fun.
 Weisz is rather ditsy for an academic and totally unbelievable, while
Hannah is just along for comic relief.
 Admittedly, this update of "The Mummy" is exciting, but it's also sad. It
seems so cynical, so contrived.
 In the original, for all his foul deeds, you felt a twinge of sympathy for
Imhotep. You even were a bit sorry for him.
 In this remake, Imhotep is only pixels and memory bytes, to be shot to
pieces and reconstituted as the plot dictates.
 And that's too bad. "The Mummy" lacks heart. It's as cold and dead as a sphinx.

Sometime around 1100 BC, an Egyptian guy named Imhotep had an affair
with the Pharaoh's wife, killed the Pharaoh, and then was subjected to
horrible torture and an eternal curse.  Several thousand years later, in
the 1920s, an American explorer and a British librarian go looking for
treasure, but end up finding Imhotep.  Imhotep is still alive, but now
he's a mummy, and he's very mad.  He proceeds to unleash the 10 plagues
of Egypt on the people around him, while simultaneously sucking mortals
dry so he can get his skin back (after all, it's been three thousand
years, and most of his skin has decomposed).  
Anyone who takes Stephen Sommers' The Mummy seriously is wasting his or
her time.  This is not a serious film.  It's a two-hour joke.  It's also
relentlessly funny and entertaining as heck.  Purists will agree that
The Mummy is not as good as Sommers' previous film, the woefully
underrated (but similarly hilarious) Deep Rising, but there's still fun
to be had here.  You see, Stephen Sommers is a man who understands his
genre and knows that the only way to truly avoid criticism is to
criticize your own movie.  So many horror films go for poker-faced
stiffness and end up completely absurd (Virus, for instance, would have
been ten times better with Sommers at the helm).  The Mummy is a film
bursting at the seams with logical inconsistencies and senseless plot
developments.  It also features gleeful use of anachronistic dialogue
("This country is really messed up!" would not have been a common phrase
in 1926, even for an American treasure hunter).  But I can't avoid
admiration of a film in which a CGI mummy explodes into a fearful cloud
of dust after being hissed at by a fluffy white cat.
Speaking of dust, The Mummy is the sandiest movie I've ever seen. 
There is so much dirt and sand and dust here that I felt like I needed
to shake out my shoes when the picture was finished.  In fact, one of
the neatest effects in the movie features a wall of dust that turns into
Imhotep's face and swallows an airplane.  The characters are constantly
covered in sand, they're always sneezing, and the Mummy himself bursts
into dust whenever he can.
The Mummy is a loose remake of the 1932 film of the same name.  I can
recommend this film in good conscience only because it is so acutely
aware of its own badness.  The cast, too, is in on the joke, which helps
a lot.  Brendan Fraser, an actor I admire for his range, is quite funny
as Rick O'Connell, the surly American treasure hunter; he goes for the
throat with the macho-man attitude and hits the right note for the
role.  Rachel Weisz, playing the British librarian Evelyn, is very
appealing and shows splendid comic timing (she's also a Kate Winslet
look- and sound-alike, which probably is no accident).  John Hannah is
on hand as Jonathan, Evelyn's wife, and has some of the funnier lines in
the film.  Kevin J. O'Connor, who stood out in Deep Rising, has a fine
supporting role as Beni, the cowardly Egyptian guide.
There are parts in The Mummy that I found immensely funny.  The hissing
cat is one such moment.  Sommers makes the most of every cliche he can;
after a mysterious brush of wind passes by our heroes for about the
fifth time, Rick says, "That happens a lot around here."  The film is
adequate as an action picture; I liked a lot of the special effects,
including the sand wall and the walking corpses, and the finale features
some truly amazing swordplay between Rick and a horde of CGI skeletons. 
On the whole, however, the film is more effective as a comedy.  That, I
believe, will be its box office downfall.  The Mummy had a good opening
weekend, but the picture was marketed as a serious action-horror film. 
Fans going in expecting to see serious action will be disappointed.  I
wasn't disappointed; I got what I expected after learning that Stephen
Sommers is responsible for the movie.  And though I believe that The
Mummy could have been even funnier and a lot more thrilling, it's a
commendable effort from a man who clearly would rather make a horror
picture that prompts laughter rather than screams.

Brendan Fraser always seems to have his ups and downs. He can do well at the
box office, as displayed in George of the Jungle, and he can also do bad at the
box office, as displayed in Dudley Do-Right. Also, he can read the critics'
praise, as we saw in Gods and Monsters, but they can also rip him apart, as
seen in Blast from the Past. Now, coming out on video, we have The Mummy. Up or
down?
Well, it is a mix of both. Brendan Fraser's performance is nowhere near Oscar
worthy, but it is suitable for this action-packed film. His sharp wit and
ability to make us believe he is an action star make his performance great in
The Mummy. It was a box office boom and could have done even better if not for
the debut of Star Wars Episode 1- The Phantom Menace. The movie, as a whole, is
entertaining, but ultimately leaves you with a feeling of loss.
The film starts with the "background" of how the Mummy became, well, the Mummy.
This part leaves you utterly confused. However, things will eventually fall
into place. An Egyptologist, played by Rachel Weisz, finds a very ancient map.
Things set into motion from here. But, the film basically seems dry until
Fraser enters. This is when things start to happen. Fraser's performance is
terrific for this particular genre. I had doubts about this film being an
Indiana Jones rip-off, but Fraser sets himself apart. His performance proves
that he is a very versatile actor, and shows Hollywood he can open a movie all
by himself.
Speaking of that, the supporting cast really drags this movie down and probably
would have been better off leaving Fraser all by himself. Rachel Weisz gives an
adequate performance as the historical librarian, but other than that, the cast
is basically there to stand in Fraser's awe. The supporting cast, consisting
mainly of Weisz, Arnold Vosloo and John Hannah, is basically there for comedic
support. Despite Weisz's adequate performance, she has no screen power. She
basically stands there and adds the historical information to Fraser, maybe
chipping a one-liner in once and a while. John Hannah is even worse. He is just
the dumb goofball, supposedly the sidekick, and tells all the jokes. Sure, he
does get a few good laughs in, but mostly, the jokes are just sad and feeble
attempts at humor. Arnold Vosloo, who plays the Mummy in human form, probably
gives the best performance of the supporting cast. Ironically, he has very few
lines, none of which are in English. But, he does demand screen presence,
unlike the rest of the supporting cast. The best moments of The Mummy are when
Vosloo and Fraser are on-screen together, and unfortunately, that really does
not happen until the end.
The graphics in this film are superb. When the Mummy is not in human form, it
is generated with computer graphics from Industrial Light & Magic. The results
are nothing short of beautiful. The computer generated graphics range from the
minute scarabs all the way to the huge sand storm. Combine that with a
entertaining performance from Fraser and a menancing job by Vosloo, and The
Mummy turns into a wonderful popcorn flick.
All in all, most people will enjoy The Mummy. Sure, it does have some aspects
of Indiana Jones in it, but they are few and far between and Fraser's
performance will alleviate any doubts. Besides, I would rather see incorporated
themes of a good movie like Indiana Jones, rather than a bad film like The
Haunting. However, the supporting cast will leave a sour taste in your mouth,
because despite the presence of Fraser and Vosloo, two actors are not enough to
hold up a two-hour action film.

The Mummy is a seriously flawed film that is saved by only two things: Its
tongue-in-cheek attitude and the over-the-top action.  Sure, there were
some spectacular special effects, but they hurt the film more than they
helped.  I'll get to that later.
As the film opens we are transported back three thousand years where we
meet Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) a high priest that is cursed and buried alive
the burial/mummification is quite a nasty process.  Flash forward to 1923
where we meet adventurer Rick (Brenden Fraser) O'Connell who is hired to
lead a librarian Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) Carnarvon and her brother Jonathon
(John Hannah) to find the lost city of Hamunaptra in Egypt.  At Hamunaptra,
Jonathon expects to find a buried treasure.  Evelyn is going for the
challenge; Hamunaptra has never been found nor explored.  Along the way we
also meet a mysterious group of men who seem to have some vested interest
in Hamunaptra and give the adventurers a warning, `Leave or die.'  There is
also the sub-plot about another group of adventurers led by a backstabbing
former friend of O'Connell, Beni (Kevin J. O'Conner).
When the groups get to Hamunaptra both go in different directions with
their explorations.  But, together they find something completely evil:
Imhotep.  After mistakenly reading out of the wrong book, Imhotep is
revived from the dead and is now out to unleash the ten plagues onto Egypt
not a pretty sight given that it includes locusts, flesh-eating scarabs,
and other things that would make your skin crawl.  As you might have
guessed it, it's up to O'Connell, Evelyn, and Jonathon to save the world.
The Mummy is not a serious film by any means.  The previews do it injustice
by portraying it as some serious take on Indiana Jones  it's not.  The
Mummy is a comedy action-adventure film that does everything with its
tongue planted firmly in cheek.  There are numerous scenes where I burst
out laughing from either the sight jokes or from one-liners.  There are
quite a few tense, thrilling, and frightening moments in the film, but for
the most part to enjoy this film you need to walk into the theatre knowing
and expecting that it is a comedy action-adventure film that has a large
dose of special effects.
Fraser is brilliantly cast as O'Connell who is a tough guy with a sly
mouth.  Fraser has that rugged look, but also has the comic timing that is
needed to pull off the part of O'Connell.  In the action scenes Fraser is
fun to watch as he pretends he's in a John Woo film  double fisted pistols
and all.  Weisz, whom I last saw in the horrible Chain Reaction, does well
with her part also.  She does very well with the material she is given.
And John Hannah, who I enjoyed immensely in Sliding Doors, also does well
in The Mummy.  The person with the least spoken lines is Arnold Vosloo, but
he does very well as the creepy Imhotep.  Vosloo is absolutely horrifying
as Imhotep and during the scenes where he is in the stages between the
living and dead, he is terrifying.
The director, Stephen Sommers (Deep Rising) writes the script.  Sommers
needs to be paired up with another writer because his characterizations are
absolutely non-existence.  The script moves like a hyperactive child from
one toy to the next.  This script never stops to take a breath, sometimes
leaving the audience behind in its rampage to get to the next action scene.
 This film runs over two hours long and could have easily been cut to a
much better length at 90-minutes.  As a director Sommers shows that he
knows how to do action.  The action sequences in The Mummy are stand out
and are mixed with a sly sense of humor.  I enjoyed the action in The Mummy.
As for the special effects, they were laid on a bit too thickly.  Even as
the film opens there is a heavy dose of special effects that instantly took
my attention away from the story that's being told.  The special effects in
some places are used wisely, but more often then not the special effects
are used to wow the audience  some of which works, like the sand storm, but
most of it just does nothing but make the audience wonder how it was done.
I liked the special effects in the film, but wished that Sommers could have
shown some restraint in its usage.  The effect that I liked most was that
of the mummies.  They had this quality of being up-to-date yet old and
nostalgic.  You'll have to see the film to know what I mean by that.  The
mummies just look cool but move with that Jason and the Argonauts type
movement.
Overall, I enjoyed The Mummy, it doesn't quite make it up to the point of
being a Don't Miss film, but I do highly recommend it.  This is a great
popcorn fluff film that will scare you, make you laugh, and move you to the
edge of your seat.  The Mummy is one of those films that I like to stick in
the category of Stupid-But-Fun.  Catch The Mummy during a matinee showing
for its inventive action, special effects, and the comedy of Brenden Fraser.

Forget the guy wrapped in gauze bandages emerging from a
tomb. That's the old "Mummy" with Boris Karloff (1932). This new
version combines a monster thriller with a sense of humor and a dollop
of romance in an exotic setting, plus lots and lots of special
effects.  Perhaps having learned from the disasters of "Mary Reilly"
and "Frankenstein," writer/director Stephen Sommers ("Deep Rising")
has turned a low-budget horror movie into a big-budget adventure, set
in Cairo in 1925. The Mummy's story begins when the priest Imhotep
murders the Pharaoh for his gorgeous mistress. When she then dies, he
attempts to summon the deepest, darkest evil entities to bring her
back to life. Caught in this treacherous act, he's mummified alive
with his tongue cut out so he cannot scream. 3,000 years pass before
he's resurrected and regenerated by a French Foreign Legionnaire
(Brendan Fraser), a librarian/Egyptologist (Rachel Weisz), and her
greedy, ne'er-do-well brother (John Hannah), who arrive to plunder The
City of the Dead. The wrathful Mummy (Arnold Vosloo) retaliates by
releasing the seven Biblical plagues on humanity. He's the Terminator
Mummy in this hokey story which has the tone and feel of the
'90s. While Brendan Fraser ("George of the Jungle," "Encino Man")
capitalizes on his charming, self-deprecating goofiness - muttering,
"We are in serious trouble" - he's no Indiana Jones.  In fact, the
real "star" is the CGI wizard. It's terrifying to see a scarab
burrowing under someone's skin and moving up the arm; it's amazing to
watch people turning into boil-covered zombies; and it's awesome to
witness the "wall of sand" in the desert. On the Granger Movie Gauge
of 1 to 10, "The Mummy" is a scary, spooky 6. With a PG-13 rating,
it's the first of the big summer popcorn pictures.

Cast:  Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, Kevin
J. O'Connor, Oded Fehr.
Screenplay:  Stephen Sommers.
Producers:  James Jacks and Sean Daniel.
Director:  Stephen Sommers.
Cap: Unfortunately, this is not Indiana Jones, although Brendan Fraser
tries his best to fill his shoes; which is as near an impossible feat to
let's say raising a mummy from the dead.
The concept and feel of this movie is what draws a crowd. Drawn perhaps
by the romance and sands of Egypt, where long ago the forbidden love
affair between the High Priest and the Pharaoh's Mistress draws a curse
so great that it could destroy the world. Yeah Right! What is impressive
though, is the ensemble of special effects. Walls of sand, whirling
dervishes, mummified priests, death beetles that eat you alive  now
that's what we've all really come to see. And if that's what you're
looking for, then it comes more or less served as a ten-course meal.
With the rise of the mummy, returns the ten plaques of Egypt. Believe me
this is one very, angry, nasty mummy whose out for revenge. Where death
is only the beginning, he's back to suck the life force out of grave
robbers, steal the girl, sacrifice her to raise another girl, beat the
good guy to a pulp and just generally be big, mean and very nasty.
Overall, disappointing in the script and acting department. Particularly
disappointing was the heroine (Rachel Weisz), who was so British that it
almost made it impossible for the hero (Brendan Fraser), to get into her
knickers. In fact there was no chemistry between them at all. Perhaps,
and just perhaps, the only one who could have lit her fire was the
Mummy, but then only maybe. Even more annoying was her brother (John
Hannah), who was so annoyingly unfunny, as the side kick, they should
have hired a camel instead. But don't let all these setbacks spoil your
enjoyment of the otherwise thrilling Mummy.

Weisz, and Kevin J. O'Connor
     Normally, when a movie is really bad, the best part of watching the
film is watching the previews.  When watching The Mummy, Stephen Sommers
"not-quite-a-remake-but-really-is" of the 1921 version, I didn't even get
that satisfaction.  I think one of the previews was good, but not good
enough for me to remember its title.  I remember that Jan de Bont is coming
out with a new chic horror film called The Haunting of Hill House or
something equally cheesy, which looks to be worse than his last one.  I also
remember seeing a preview for a new Arnold Scwatzenagger movie that didn't
even dare put his name on it after him having been in the double-trouble
combination of Eraser and Jingle all the Way.
     No, to dispel a rumor it is not a remake of the 1921 film with the same
plot, same title, and same main idea.  To those people in charge of movie
studios who are telling me this, I ask you: what is it?
     Going on with my ripping the film to shreds, I will say that it has as
cheesy of a plot as The Mummy (no matter what year) has ever had: "it" boy
Brendon Fraser (portraying a French Legion Soldier who happens ot be an
American) has to save the world with British-thief Jonathan (John Hannah,
hopefully no relation to the talented actress Daryl) and
more-frigid-than-Antartica archeologist/librarian Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) have
to save the world from a very dumb, very ugly "mummy" (although he ends up
with a fairly good complexion and a full bunch of skin before he is killed),
played by Arnold Vosloo.
     Let's face it, every time that Brendan Fraser tries to do a mainstream
role he either fails miserably or psuedo-fails.  In George of the Jungle,
which I will only now admit to seeing, he made something that was already
stupid like dumber.  In Blast from the Past, a medicore movie due to its
script, he almost took a wrecking ball to it.
     Vosloo and Hannah are people that I've seen before but haven't remember
enough of to pay attention.  Stephen Sommers is someone who continues to be
a thorn in my side after killing two Mark Twain books and then coming out
with Deep Rising.
     Sommers' very own tailor made script shows that people should not buy
books on "How to Write your Screenplay in 21 Days" or "How to Make a Movie
that Sells" on a matter of princeple.  Sommers tries and fails at juggling
Adventure, Romance, Comedy, Action, and Horror around all at once.  In the
desparate attempt to keep the balls from hitting him on the head, he ends up
placing one-liners right next to screams of terror as a flesh-eating...
BEETLE?... devours someone from the inside.  Also we get to see Rachel Weisz
go from sub-zero to just plain zero as she "warms up" to Brendan Fraser.
     This is a film at which I took my own advice.  My advice: always get a
head start on an
angry mob.  Hence, I watched the last thirty seconds from the back of the
theatre.
     As promised by the preview for The Mummy, the special effects are good.
They are not, however, anything compared to what we normally see in the
pre-summer gameshow.  And, when I say special effects are good, you know
what that normally means...  It did also live up to its tagline, but not in
the way intended.  Let me tell you, personally, BEWARE OF THE MUMMY.

Bob the Happy Bastard's Quickie Review:
Brendan Fraser's stuck in the past again, but at least this time he has
something better to do than to quote sitcom lines and try to woo Alicia
Silverstone...
Fraser is the lead star of The Mummy, the second directorial effort from
action director Stephen Sommers (who also brought us the decent thrill
ride that was Deep Rising).  It's a rough adaptation of the 1932 film,
and I say rough because it focuses more on special effects than on some
guy in bandages, like Boris Karloff was engulfed in.
But who cares, the movie has a sort of swashbuckling quality to it you
can't get from, oh, say, Godzilla or Armageddon.  Fraser plays a soldier
who gets a premonition during a battle with soldiers in an Egyptian
ground.  Basically, it's a little sign from the mummy buried underneath-
a priest named Ihmoetep who was buried alive for taking part of
murdering the King and making out with his mistress.  His plan- wake
back up and wake her up also, making him invincible.
Of course, Fraser returns to the site years later with a librarian
(Rachel Weisz) and her brother (John Hanna), along with a former buddy
of his (Deep Rising's Kevin J. O'Connor) and some "Americans"...and
guess what?  Yup, Ihmoetep (Arnold Vosloo) awakens and wreaks havoc.
Fire flies from the sky, flesh-eating beetles crawl about, and, well,
Ihmoetep's plan begins to unfold.
OK, so it's not really all that new a story, but the way Sommers tells
it is entertaining enough.  The special effects from Industrial Light
and Magic are top notch, and the acting from Fraser and Weisz isn't half
bad either.  The action is pretty intense (favorite scene: the
sandstorm) and there are a few shocking scenes just to jolt you
horror-loving folks as well.
No, it's no Phantom Menace beater, but if you're looking for a solid
warm-up to the summer movie season, you won't find a better film under
wraps than The Mummy.  If this doesn't give Fraser forgiveness from
Blast From the Past and Encino Man, then nothing will.

   If tourism to Egypt drops off during the next month or so,
don't blame the Egyptian Tourist Board.  As Dan Quayle
might say, blame this on the movies, specifically on one that
makes the North African state appear to be a dull place
indeed.  "The Mummy" is the culprit this time: a pot pourri of
special effects that forgot about dialogue, acting and even set
design.  Brendan Fraser does OK in the role of a
self-deprecatory Yankee Zorro who falls for a pyramid
scheme.  He's a muscular enough guy as we noted in his
role as Adam in "Blast from the Past" and has a resonant
voice, proficient in commanding the folks trapped in the
wrong place at the wrong time.  As the object of his affection,
Rachel Weisz was more the three-dimensional human being
as the shy but caring Amy Foster in "Swept From the Sea,"
but looks darn good here as a flapper-librarian as adept at
knocking over bookshelves as she is at thumping Fraser's
heart strings.  But just as technology does not always do
things better than human beings, this "Mummy" does not
match the gauzy characters played by the likes of Boris
Karloff and Christopher Lee in sound movies as far back as
1932.  
   Though modern-day Hamitic people have shifted their
loyalties to more peaceful leaders like Anwar Sadat and
Hosni Mubarek, the vindictive slaveowners three millennia
back were anything but forgiving.  Because of their
malevolence, the title character of writer-director Stephen
Sommers's yarn has good reason to be irked.  For playing
around with Pharaoh's daughter, his judges did not waste
time on impeachment proceedings but rather sentenced him
to a death so horrific that the penalty had not before been
tried.  Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) was buried alive, his only
companions a horde of heckling bugs which, not being
exceptionally hungry at the time, dined leisurely on the
miscreant to afford him--and the pests--more time to think of
the pleasures of the flesh.  Needless to say the area of
desert that served as his shrine is called "evil ground," so
that everyone is advised to picnic elsewhere where the bugs
are not so ravenous.  Let sleeping studs lie.
   You'd think that mummies would be happy about being
awakened, cooped up as they've been for some millennia. 
But no, these ungrateful poster boys for Johnson and
Johnson are perpetually  angry.  Hostility is a tradition with
them, since 1932 , when Boris Karloff was revived after
thousands of years in an incarnation that was chills ahead of
its follow-ups, including the "The Mummy's Hand" made eight
years later; the 1944 "Mummy's Curse," the "Mummy's
Ghost" of that same year, the 1959 British "Mummy," and the
1967 bomb "The Mummy's Shroud."  This time around, the
fable has been deconstructed.  No bandages: the little
creatures took care of them, so that all that's left of Imhotep
since he nodded off in 1290 B.C. is a guy who looks like the
product of a seriously botched rhinoplasty.  
   When Sommers jumps to 1923, he focuses on the hulky
Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) who has just been promoted
to commanding officer of his French Foreign Legion troupe. 
He fights off a band of evil-looking men, giving orders in
perfect English, somehow hooks up with a comely,
hieroglyphics-endowed librarian, Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) and
her nerdy brother Jonathan (John Hannah), and goes off to
find a lost city with its buried treasure.  They wake up the
creature who, after three thousands years does not even take
time to go to the bathroom but who instead enlists the help of
some American tourists and Arabs to supply him with the vital
organs he needs (presumably to go to the bathroom).
   The only way to play yet another "mummy" is to take the
show to camp, but Sommers's script failed to capture much
more than a smile from the huge all-media audience at a
recent New York screening.  The sallies are on the level of
what we hear during the early part of the story, when the
Legion captain runs in fear from the galloping enemy and
Rick O'Connell's right-hand man tells Rick "You've just been
promoted."  The bugs that spring to life are generic horror
creatures that predictably crawl up their victims' bodies from
feet to neck and the mummy--who at first looks like a decent
drawing in Gray's Anatomy--comes off just a bit scarier when
he acquires his organs and looks like a human being.
   If only this title character did not talk so much, we could
have been in for some fun.  In a scene near the movie's
conclusion, he has the lovely Evelyn tethered to a board,
about to sacrifice her so that he can fully revive the princess
he's pined for these three thousand years.  Lifting a knife
ever so slowly, he says to no one in particular that when he
has plunged the dagger into Evelyn's ample bosom he will be
invincible.  This would not be the first time that announcing
plans gives the hero the time he needs to foil the villain's
strategy and to lead to the usual, predictable resolution.

Stephen Sommers, the writer and director of last year's universally panned
DEEP RISING, is back again.  This time he unleashes a cinematic plague on
his audiences with THE MUMMY, a lame INDIANA JONES wannabe.
A remake in name only of the 1932 Boris Karloff classic, THE MUMMY features
a host of gross and frightening special effects.  The movie never figures
out what it wants to be when it grows up.  It is alternately: a parody, an
adventure, a horror movie and an old fashioned B movie.  Universal had the
project in development for years before they gave it to Sommers.  They
should have waited for a better script and director.
Sommers's script, which is filled with logical gaps, is so confusing that
you begin to wonder if the print has missing hieroglyphic subtitles.
Certainly the story can be exasperatingly baffling, as if it were not
intended that mere mortals should be able to follow it.
The plot has to do with a high priest who was mummified alive after being
caught red-handed with the pharaoh's sweetheart.   More formally addressed
as Imhotep, High priest of Osiris (Arnold Vosloo), the Mummy comes back from
the dead in 1923 and unleashes plagues on the world.  This all happens
because an Indiana Jones character called Rick O'Connell goes looking for
treasure where the Mummy sleeps.  Never disturb a man resting comfortably in
his sarcophagus.
The only potentially promising part of the movie is the casting of Brendan
Fraser as Rick.  Fraser, who has delivered strong performances in every film
he has made until now, isn't the least bit interesting in THE MUMMY.
Miscast in an underwritten role, he never figures out what to do with his
character.
Cast opposite Fraser is Rachel Weisz as librarian and Egyptologist Evelyn
and SLIDING DOORS's John Hannah as her imbecilic brother Jonathan.
If any of the characters were worth caring about or possessed any depth, the
story might have a chance.  But the script plays like an outline that was
never filled in.
A few parts of the movie do come alive with a little spark of intelligence.
A drunken Evelyn tries to explain what she is doing in such a dangerous
situation.  "I know what you're asking," she tells Rick.  "How did a country
like this get in a girl like you?" The beauty of this seemingly mixed up
line is that it is precisely what she means.
Another episode that demonstrates some charm shows a terrified man trying to
save himself from the attacking Mummy, who looks like a creature from ALIENS
with a bad set of dentures.  Holding up a series of icons from a cross to a
Star of David, he's willing to profess belief in whatever religion will
protect him from the monster.
"We are in serious trouble," says Rick to his fellow treasure hunters.  "We
are in very serious trouble." And so are you if you're unlucky enough to
find yourself stuck in a theater playing this movie.  The picture deserves
its own mummification.
THE MUMMY runs too long at 2:08.  It is rated PG-13 for gross and
frightening images that will scare kids prone to nightmares.  For those with
strong stomachs, the film would be acceptable for those 12 and up.

If you plan to see "The Mummy," there are a few things you should 
know. First, although loosely based on the well-known monster movie, 
it's not particularly scary. Instead of trying to frighten us, the 
filmmakers elected to make an "Indiana Jones" style adventure tale. 
Second, as an "Indiana Jones" derivative, it's not particularly 
involving. The story takes forever to get rolling and the convoluted 
plot serves mostly as an excuse to whip out loads of flashy special 
effects. Third, some of those effects are nifty, but few are 
convincing and too many are simply cheesy. Fourth, most of the jokes 
aren't funny. Apparently realizing their creation was structurally 
unsound, the filmmakers attempt to distract viewers with an endless 
stream of wisecracks from the principal characters. Wrapping things 
up (ahem), I suggest you skip "The Mummy." 
The plot goes like this. In the mid-1920s, a plucky librarian (Rachel 
Weisz) reluctantly hires a ne'er-do-well adventurer (Brendan Fraser) 
to search for ruins of the ancient Egyptian city Hamunaptra, buried 
deep in the desert. They travel the Nile along with a competing team 
of cowboys bent on plundering the treasures of Hamunaptra. Once in 
the city, an unusually nasty mummy called Imhotep is accidentally 
raised from the dead by the cowpokes. The cranky 3,000-year-old 
immediately begins snagging body parts from those who released him, 
hoping to reconstitute his body so that he can unleash plagues on 
Egypt and bring his girlfriend back to life, presumably to rule the 
world at his side. And you thought Bill Clinton was a contemporary 
phenomenon.
"The Mummy" could have worked as a horror story, an adventure tale, 
or even a spoof, but writer-director Stephen Sommers ("Deep Rising") 
stumbles by haplessly trying to combine all three. While taking crib 
notes from the "Indiana Jones" movies, he should have studied more 
carefully, because he makes some fundamental errors here.
To succeed, films of this genre require a memorable villain. "The 
Mummy" starts with one, but undermines its effectiveness through bad 
writing. Even in the most dire circumstances, the lead characters 
continue trading one-liners as if they were playing flag football on 
a Sunday afternoon instead of facing death from a supernatural 
malevolent creature - - if they don't take the monster seriously, why 
should we? 
Fraser and Weisz spend so much time swapping comedic insults that 
they come off like a road company version of Sam and Diane from 
"Cheers." They are lightweights; two crazy kids on a madcap escapade. 
Brendan Fraser is a talented actor, but the script cripples his 
character, casting him as an enterprising puppy dog instead of a real 
swashbuckler. As Indiana Jones, Harrison Ford tossed off his share of 
caustic remarks, but he clearly recognized his opponents as genuine 
menaces. Fraser's character seems more like a big kid on nitrous 
oxide during a marathon paintball tournament.
The impact of the storyline is also lessened by the way the 
characters deal with death. A large number of cast members die 
gruesomely, but their friends show virtually no emotional reaction. 
Only once in the entire movie does anyone pause to display a moment 
of regret that a friend has been killed. 
After a while, my investment in the storyline disappeared completely 
and I just sat back and watched the special effects while waiting for 
the overlong film to end. "The Mummy" overflows with computer 
generated images of varying degrees of originality and quality. A 
prologue in ancient Egypt shows a lavish rendering of Hamunaptra in 
its prime, but the backgrounds are chintzy matte paintings and the 
computer renderings have that overly creamy look, similar to the CGI 
films shown in motion simulator rides. 
Later, flesh-eating bugs create some minor scares, although they too 
have the same cut-rate CGI appearance. Images of faces mystically 
appearing in sandstorms are more effective and shots of freshly 
revived mummies, while reminiscent of the skeletal version of the 
"Terminator," are nicely rendered. But effects do not a movie make 
and all the flashy imagery in "The Mummy" can't compensate for its 
soulless feel. 
The few scenes I enjoyed featured Bernard Fox, Dr. Bombay from the 
old "Bewitched" TV series, as a dotty soldier of fortune. I had no 
idea the veteran actor was still alive and his blustery performance 
was a pleasure. In just a few minutes of screen time, he showed more 
personality than the rest of the cast combined.
In his review of "The Mummy," Roger Ebert gave the film three out of 
four stars, acknowledging that it was trash, but arguing that it was 
enjoyable trash. I understand the sentiment, but his choice surprises 
me. If I'm in the mood for a so-bad-that-it's-good movie, I'll seek 
out something memorably awful, like "Roadhouse" or "Showgirls." "The 
Mummy" isn't bad enough to make my guilty pleasure list. It's merely 
one more overblown exercise in big budget lameness.

Directed and screenplay by Stephen Sommers. Running time: 120 minutes.
Rated PG-13 (for pervasive adventure violence and some partial nudity).
The Mummy is the first big movie to come out this summer. It follows the
summer movie formula to the last recipe (usually a bumbling idiot of a
sidekick) and offers up a fine appetizer for what is to come this
summer.
Loosely based on the 1930s classic The Mummy with Boris Karloff, the
1999 version burrows much more from the Indiana Jones films. Brendan
Fraser plays Rick O'Connell who is a gung-ho hero who is the only one
alive who knows the location of a secret land which may hold great
treasures. A kindly, if not accident prone, librarian Evelyn (Rachel
Weisz) finds a secret map and
key which may be related to the secret land. She along with her brother
Jonathan (John Hannah) get Rick out of an Egyptian prison and plan to go
searching for what Rachel wants the most, a lost book she has been
admiring for quite sometime that is of great importance (not to mention
made of pure
gold). Jonathan doesn't much mind the riches that are said to be there
either.
The three travel to a hidden temple where they find a book. Not the gold
book but the Book of the Dead. Rachel, being the fool she is, deciphers
the reading inside the book and reads them aloud. This causes an ancient
curse to awake from inside the temple. Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) was a
ruler who was condemned to the worst punishment before electric chairs,
being mummified alive. The mummy Imhotep breaks from his casing and
after he has regenerated he will try to bring his dead lover back to
life using a sacrifice. So Rick, Rachel, and Jonathan along with a team
of treasure hunters who just happened to be looking for treasure too try
to survive the mummy's curse
Industrial Light and Magic has provided some of the best visual effects
of recent years and they continue to with The Mummy. ILM turned actor
Vosloo into the living dead with amazing results. I can't wait until a
director decides to make a zombie film using today's technology. They
also create some great images using sandstorms and plagues.
The actors seem to have a fun time. Fraser seems well placed as the hero
and delivers the typical one-liners very well. Vosloo probably deserves
the most credit though. He delivers his lines with such gusto it is fun.
It's also cool since he probably had to talk to the effects people
before making any movements. Weisz seems a bit out of place but still is
good and delivers some good bumbling comic relief.
The one thing I would tell anyone planning to see The Mummy (which is a
good idea) is that is dumb. I'm not saying I didn't like it but the
movie is predictable. You can tell when jump scenes are going to occur
or when a character is going to "buy it". The movie is very fun though.
Much like an update of the classic monster movies of the past.
I would recommend The Mummy to most anyone who likes a fun movie that
will give them something fun to do for 2 hours. Teens will lap it up but
I wouldn't take the little ones to this picture. The decaying Imhotep
and the massive visuals may leave them with nightmares. Go into the
movie with an open mind and think of all the cheesy but fun monster
movies of earlier that you loved as a kid and secretly love to this day.

Chad'z rating: ** (out of 4 = fair/below average)
1999, PG-13, 127 minutes [2 hours, 7 minutes]
Starring: Brendan Fraser (Rick O'Connell), Rachel Weisz (Evey), John Hannah 
(Jonathon), Kevin J. O'Connor (Beni); produced by Sean Daniels, James Jacks; 
written and directed by Stephen Sommers.
Seen May 13, 1999 at 6:10 p.m. at the Crossgates Cinema 18 (Guilderland, NY), 
theater #2, by myself for free using my Hoyt's season pass. [Theater rating: 
****: excellent seats, sound and picture]
        There are some movies you don't actually have to watch to know what 
happens. There are some movies that are so standard, so cliche, so unoriginal 
they don't take much mental energy to pitch, produce and sell to the public. 
And in keeping with movies like this, which `The Mummy' is a perfect example 
of, us critics don't have to do much in the lines of reviewing them because 
the public, the film studios and us critics ourselves already know what we're 
going to say, it's just kind of a formality to sit down at a computer and 
push the letters on the keyboard in the proper sequence.
        So here's some quotes from reviews of other movies. I trust my 
readers are smart enough to figure out what I'm trying to say... I'll meet 
you at the end of the review while I go grab a beer.
        `From the title alone... doesn't sound too appealing because it's so 
generic and boring. It's the epitome of a sci-fi title, and not surprisingly, 
this is the epitome of a sci-fi movie. It... tries to use both intelligent 
reasoning and barbaric violence to solve problems - guess which method 
dominates?' - review of `Alien.'
        `Getting an audience's attention right from the beginning plays a 
major role in how today's films work. We want to have something exciting to 
watch, not a slow build-up of a story (God forbid!), and this film plays 
right into the mainstream's hands. The opening sequence uses mystery, comedy, 
and action simultaneously to give a sneak preview of the level of the 
in-your-face energy the film has,' - review of `Armageddon.'
        `It's clear the film doesn't want to waste time on reality and thus 
the attempt to establish plausibility (the most minimal amount necessary) 
comes across as a half-assed effort. Supporting characters and shady 
sup-plots are introduced, but as is the case with films made up of a large 
cast of characters, only a handful have any real significance... There's a 
fine line separating homage from plagiarism...,' - review of `Godzilla' (1998)
        `... this story is fine and the film does a good job in creating a 
suspenseful mood since we seem to be the only ones who can see the obvious. 
Horror stories thrive on this kind of element, so when the evil things happen 
we can say to the naysayers, "Told you so." However, the manner in which the 
film actually breaks down the plot and uses this element is quite 
exploitative,' - review of `The Exorcist.'
        `Unfortunately, as is the case with most modern thrillers, once the 
film showed potential for authenticity and intelligence, the cliches and 
action sequences take over,' - review of `The Jackal.'
        `Most of the film is a bad rip-off of the "Indiana Jones" films and 
just about every sci-fi movie and comic book ever. We get a lot of rhetoric 
that seems to justify all the unnecessary violence and bizarre storyline and 
mythology, but just considering the basic elements, it's too stupid to take 
seriously,' - review of `Stargate.'
        `The last act... seems like the world really will come to an end and 
yet none of the characters seem worried about it... The script conviently 
provides for the massive special effects disaster imagery it promises and a 
climatic resolution, but still fails to work even as eye candy as it's very 
unconvincing and ends much too quickly,' - review of `Deep Impact.'
        `There isn't much going for... other than its special effects and 
production design (which are excellent, I'll have to admit it), but that 
doesn't make up for the mediocre story. Maybe if it had been scripted with 
more wit, it would be worth getting excited over,' - review of `Aliens.'
        But seriously folks, what it all comes down to is that `The Mummy' 
tries to be funny and intense at the same time and it just doesn't happen. 
It's hard to find the intense and suspenseful elements intense and 
suspenseful when you already know what's going to happen. It's good they 
throw in the comedy to keep us laughing when there's no action or adventure 
going on, but why not through in the comedy during the supposed adventure 
elements? What we end up with is clashing moods which cancel each other out 
and all we're left with is people running around and special effects. We 
could watch `Waterworld' for that.

I am a movie critic; that much is obvious. But moreso, I consider
myself a movie lover.  Sometimes, in an awful movie, my friends will
beg me to leave the theatre halfway through the film. But I always
stay, hoping that a good ending can save the otherwise horrible
movie. But two-thirds of the way through the painfully bad The Mummy,
I realized there was no hope, and my more-than-willing friend and I
left the theatre then and there.
We walked through the campus of UCLA at midnight, and talked to the
fans waiting in line to get tickets to the new "Star Wars" movie. We
watched "L.A. Confidential" with them and waited for a cab. When we
got in the cab, the driver asked, "So, what did you do tonight?"  "We
saw a bad movie," I answered.  "The Mummy?" he asked. He explained
that the night before he had driven home people who felt as if they
witnessed a disaster by watching the movie. Enough said.
Brendan Fraser, whom I was just beginning to like, stars as Rick
O'Connell, a foreign soldier fighting in 1920's Egypt. He is fighting
for the lost city of Hammenabtra, known as the city of the dead. Many
years before, a man (Arnold Vosloo) had been mummified with a powerful
curse that would infect anyone who came into contact with him.
Anyway, Rick, a librarian named Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), and her
brother (John Hannah), go back to Hammenabtra to find ancient artifacts
worth millions. What they end up doing is waking the mummy, and trying
to stop him.
Going through all the problems of The Mummy would waste a lot of
precious time, so I'll just point out something that really pissed me
off. Director Stephen Sommers (Deep Rising) calls his film a "sweeping,
desert epic", and he is so visually derivative of The English Patient
in a couple scenes that I almost wanted to scream. If only Sommers
could have made his plot and characters a litle bit more like the
characters in The English Patient...
Universal Pictures is supposedly in need of a hit after notable flops
like Babe: Pig In The City, Meet Joe Black, and EdTV, but I think that
bad word of mouth will cut The Mummy off after a large opening
weekend. The film should do little to hamper Brendan Fraser's rising
stardom, but I'd like to see him choose more good roles like Gods and
Monsters or School Ties.
I feel as if I've wasted to much time on this review when I only need
to prove one point: The Mummy is crap on a reel.

Brendan Fraser, action star? Yessiree-Bobby!! Take him, slap him into an
adventure/horror flick with a bunch of other semi-unknowns, some superb
mummy special effects, and an updated version of the 1932 Boris Karloff
classic of the same name, and you've got yourself a good ol' rock 'n roll
time at the movies!
PLOT:
Set in 1923, 3,000 years after the horrific mummification of a man who
fooled around with the Pharaoh's mistress, this tale follows three divergent
personalities searching for the ancient City of the Dead, where the mummy
and some awesome treasures are said to be buried. A librarian with a
penchant for all things ancient, her goofy brother, looking for the fortune
of his life, and Rick O'Connell, your modern day hero.
CRITIQUE:
The fun summer thrill ride of action-packed popcorn movies with extra cheese
has begun with a major Egyptian blast, in this part-romance, part-action,
part-horror, part-comedy kick in the entertainment nuts! I would qualify
this film as being one of the closest deemed worthy of the title of
Indiana Jones Jr., with its charismatic lead actor, in Brendan Fraser, its
non-stop adventurous tone, and its mouth-dropping special effects of the
Mummy and his wonderfully wicked world of evil. This is the perfect movie to
go see if you want to escape to a place of the past, with breath-taking
images of the desert, damsels in distress, swash-buckling and gun-toting
heroes and a gallery of mummies ready to skin you to the bone, in hopes of
regaining their own livelihood. Check your brain at the door, and enjoy the
bumpy ride, cause this one will have you laughing, screaming and sighing
your way into the mysterious world of ancient Egypt and its spooky-dooky
myths.
Credit the special effects department with most of this film's greatest
moments, but don't take away from the always entertaining script written by
the director himself, Stephen Sommers, and the enjoyable action sequences
which mixed comedy and a slick choreography of guns, knives, swords, kicks
and punches. The cast is also very good, with Fraser leading the way as the
man who likes to kick mummy ass, John Hannah as the always amusing brother
of the leading lady, and Kevin O'Connor as the quirky weasel who gets into
cahoots with the bandaged corpse himself. All in all, a fun time at the
movies, with plenty of action, comedy, adventure and romance to satisfy
everyone waiting impatiently for THE PHANTOM MENACE, and some of the coolest
special effects this side of THE MATRIX (7.5/10). In fact, it's a perfect
place to take your own "mummy" on Mother's Day this weekend. Then again,
thousands of flesh-eating bugs munching a man alive might not be her cup o'
tea :)
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Brendan Fraser was born in Indianapolis and raised in Europe and Canada. He
was the fourth son of a Canadian career bureaucrat whose job for the office
of tourism required him to say the least, do some travelling. His first
screen role was opposite River Phoenix and Lily Taylor in the
underappreciated film DOGFIGHT (8.5/10). He currently resides in L.A. with
his wife Afton and dog Wylie. He stands 6'3".
You may remember actor John Hannah from his gay role in FOUR WEDDINGS AND A
FUNERAL (8/10) and SLIDING DOORS (7.5/10) with Gwyneth Paltrow. Before he
decided on a career as an actor, John was an apprentice electrician for four
years. He gave this up after being accepted by a drama school in Glasgow.
The man who plays the Mummy is born in South Africa and his name is Arnold
Vosloo.
After director Stephen Sommers attended St-Johns University and The
University of Seville in Spain, he spent four years performing in theatre
groups and managing rock 'n roll bands throughout Europe. From there, he
relocated to L.A., and attended the USC School of Cinema-Television for
three years, earning a Master's Degree. He also wrote and directed his last
film called DEEP RISING.
Several follow-ups to the original MUMMY film from 1932 include THE MUMMY'S
HAND, THE MUMMY'S TOMB, THE MUMMY'S GHOST and THE MUMMY'S CURSE.
This film took 17 weeks to complete filming in Morocco and the United
Kingdom. The political climate in Egypt during the pre-production period of
this film, made it impossible to set up such a major movie with all of its
inherent logistical problems.

     I am not old enough to have seen the original release of the Boris
Karloff THE MUMMY (1932).  I caught it on television as I was growing
up, and it is a cherished memory.  This concept was that mysterious
ancient magic was still powerful and you have to respect ancient
strange gods and their mysterious curses.  There was a real sense of
wonder in the great old film and in the idea it was based upon, the
idea that there was a degree of truth in the ages-old religion that
inspired the great stone enigmas of Egypt.  Karl Freund's film, often
deemed slow by today's teens, was not actually slow but hypnotic.  Its
unspoken premise was that the universe was full of possibilities,
including nasty ones that Isis and Osiris and Anubis were as powerful
as any gods, and they only for now chose to slumber.
     Today we live in the age of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," and our
teens have the answer to all that.  They know that in those old movies
the reason that people had all that trouble with mystical forces is
that they did not know martial arts.  If you run into particularly
nasty magic from the age of the pyramids, all that is really necessary
is that you kick a little harder.  All that old awe stuff was stupid.
So for this audience a mummy movie needs a lot of action and Indiana
Jones style thrills and funny jokes and special effects.  That really
is what we have gotten.
     The new version of THE MUMMY begins with an extended opening
sequence showing the origin of the living Mummy told as we tell it in
the 1990s.  As much as the film in general does, this sequence mixes
blessing and curse.  There is a beautiful computer animation, if
somewhat obviously animation, of an ancient Egyptian city.  While
somewhat idealized it looks fairly close to being done with a high
degree of historical accuracy.  This is followed by scenes of Imhotep
(Arnold Vosloo), here a high priest of Osiris fooling around with
Pharaoh's wife Ankhesenamun. The latter is dressed in a sort of fishnet
outfit. Let us say that historical accuracy is not uniformly
distributed.  Of course, the lovers are discovered and Pharaoh is
roughly as forgiving as one would expect of a living god.  Imhotep is
sentenced to be mummified alive, to be made immortal, and to suffer an
eternity of living death in his tomb in Hamunaptra, a treasure city and
sacred burial site.
     Flash forward to 1921 and we find American adventurer Rick
O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) is fighting with French Foreign Legion when
he runs across the ruins of what might be the legendary Hamunaptra.
>From there the general flow of the plot is obvious and not unlike a
hyped-up version of THE MUMMY'S HAND.  O'Connell gets involved with
Evelyn Carnarvon (Rachel Weisz) the daughter of a famous explorer.  Two
groups of people end up trying to find the riches of Hamunaptra and a
third group is trying to protect the city and its secrets.  The secrets
include an immortal mummy who when raised needs to collect living
organs to adopt into his body and recreate himself whole.
     Adrian Biddle's cinematography captures a big adventure feel and
spectacle that is unusual for traditionally low-budget mummy films.
Here, at least in the early parts of the film there is a good
adventuresome look for the film.  While Jerry Goldsmith's score is not
one of his better works and does not make itself memorable, at least it
underscores the action well.  There are certain dramatic problems with
the film.  Some tension is created as the mummy becomes more and more
complete by virtue of the organs he steals.  But when he is complete,
he just looks like Arnold Vosloo again.  It is something of a letdown;
Vosloo is no Boris Karloff.
     This new THE MUMMY is a comedy that does well what current films
do well, but it completely fails to do well what 1932 films did well.
In short, in spite of the title, this just is not THE MUMMY.  On
leaving the theater I felt like chanting, "Show me THE MUMMY!  Show me
THE MUMMY!"  This experience rates a 6 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +1 on
the -4 to +4 scale.
     1. The real Imhotep lived around 2980 B.C.E.  Imhotep, very
probably one of history's great geniuses, was a physician and an
architect.  He invented step pyramids for the Pharaoh Zoser, leading
the way for true pyramids.  However, he probably would not also have
been a priest of Osiris as the film portrayed him. The real
Ankhesenamun lived around 1375 B.C.E and was the wife of Tutankhamun.
Naturally Imhotep and Ankhesenamun never met, much less had a great
love.  The time difference is roughly the same as if it was suggested
that Attila the Hun had an illicit affair with Meryl Streep.
     2. The descendents of the original Egyptians are portrayed in the
film as Moslem; they would much more likely be Coptic Christians.
     3. Though unstated, Evelyn's father is clearly intended to be Lord
Carnarvon, who in 1923 would be pivotal in Howard Carter's discovery of
Tutankhamun's tomb. Lady Elizabeth Carnarvon's death in 1929 was one of
those linked to the supposed curse on Tutankhamun's tomb.
     4. Books with pages were invented in China and did not make it to
places like Egypt until something like the 4th Century C.E.

Here's the story: three-thousand odd years ago some Jafar-type priest /
sorcerer got caught romancing the pharaoh's wife. Pretty typical stuff, but
then the pharaoh turns out have gone to the same school as all the
Bond-nemeses, the one where they ask why kill the guy when there are so many
other imaginative ways to (not) get rid of him? To give the pharaoh some
credit, though, the idea is that the punishment must fit the crime, and the
crime here is measured by how fed up with all this the pharaoh is. As bad
luck would have it, too, he's seriously fed up, meaning the only punishment
that can assuage his anger is to have Imhotep (the Jafar-sorcerer; Arnold
Vosloo) granted immortality and then summarily entombed for 'eternity' with
some flesh-eating beetles. Of course, eternity only lasts about
three-thousand years, or, until French Foreign Legionnaire Rick O'Connell
(Brendan Fraser) stumbles upon the burial, Hamunaptra, fabled city of wealth
hid midst the shifting sands etc.
Too--and even though The Mummy's set in the early part of the 20th
century--O'Connell has evidently not only seen all of the Indiana Joneses,
but evidently committed them to memory, right down to proper attire. But he
doesn't awaken Imhotep quite yet. That's plot point 1, and anyway, there's
still some other characters to introduce, the most important of which is
Evelyn, (Rachel Weisz) the fumbling, supermodel librarian. Close behind is
her conniving brother Jonathan (John Hannah). Together they hire scrupleless
O'Connell to take them to this lost city, which, while not quite as
impressive as the Egypt of Stargate, is still pretty cool. Add to it a bevy
of special effects miles ahead of any other movie and everything's set up
for a walloping good time, the kind of ride the trailer promised.
And the mummy, wow. Gone are the days when his kind shuffled around with
rigor mortis of the arms and a confused expression. Now the mummy's
serious--fast, strong, gross, a definite improvement. He even has a voice,
of the same calibre as, say, Wishmaster's, which was some top-notch
low-bass. Unlike Wishmaster, however, The Mummy tries a little too hard to
have it all--action, humor, horror. It's as if director Stephen Sommers took
all the flashy elements from Indiana Jones and tripled their intensity, with
the intention of tripling the Indiana Jones effect. Which would have been
fine as concerns the action and the horror--you can never have enough of
them; they're what we're paying for here. But the humor, the zingers written
in practically every other line. With that kind of stuff, less tends to be
more, y'know? Best to use them as a John McClane might, in the Diehard
series. Or, perhaps, best to simply not write in a comic character for the
kids. Beni (Kevin J. O'Conner, a long way from his Swann-role), the mewling,
opportunistic (reluctant) side-kick of evil. He does have a couple of
honestly good lines, but they're hardly worth all his throwaway ones. If one
character can bring down a movie that otherwise has so much going fot it,
then Beni does. If one character can save that same movie, however, look to
the Encino Man himself, Brendan Fraser, fighting the mummy tooth and nail,
doing his best Harrison Ford, the kind where we know who the real immortal
is. Suffice it to say that if you were ever hungry enough for low-rent,
high-stakes relic hunting that you tuned into the young Indiana Jones
episodes, then The Mummy might be just light-hearted enough to satisfy.

Director: Stephen Sommers

Reviewed by Luke Buckmaster
On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
2 and a half stars
Sure, there's plenty of action, a lot of cool special effects and some
good looking leads, but somewhere along the line The Mummy lost my
winning vote. Perhaps it was the film's absence of a good villain and a
thrilling climax, or maybe it was because the whole darn thing was just
too exhausting.  During the first hour or so of the film, I was
convinced that it embodied few elements of standard Hollywood big-budget
movies.  But sure enough, The Mummy does eventually succumb to formulaic
filmmaking and, to make matters worse, draws its climax out so long that
you begin to forget what the hell the heroes were fighting for.  There
are plenty of scenes of pure carnage - all of which are staged quite
nicely - that brought back faint recollections of a far superior film,
>From Dusk Till Dawn, which succeeded in almost revolutionizing the
horror genre due to its total disregard for conventional filmmaking.
Well, The Mummy hasn't exactly done that, but it didn't need to.  It's
one of those films that are so obviously written to be commercially
successful - often at the expense of any artistic merit - and usually
leave most audiences content after viewing the plot elements that they
have come to expect and appreciate.  But The Mummy did not always
entertain me, and only occasionally intrigued me.  A couple of good
reasons to see the film are its special effects, which bring atmosphere
into the picture, and Brendan Fraser's comically heroic performance
which indeed reminds us that we will be seeing a lot more of him in the
future.  You might enjoy seeing The Mummy just for its special effects,
but on these merits, The Phantom Menace is a masterpiece.

_The_Mummy_ (PG-13) * 1/2 (out of ****)
Well, it seemed like a good idea: a lavish, big-budget retelling of the
1932 horror classic _The_Mummy_.  But after seeing the finished product as
written and directed by Stephen Sommers (who last perpetrated the undersea
howler _Deep_Rising_) one would be wise to heed one of its trailer's tag
words: "Beware."
To his credit, Sommers makes his _Mummy_ a different type of animal from
its precursor.  Instead of a traditional horror piece, this _Mummy_ is more
of an adventure film, with our central trio--American adventurer Rick
O'Connell (Brendan Fraser), British librarian Evelyn Carnarvon (Rachel
Weisz), and her brother Jonathan (John Hannah)--trying to unlock the
secrets of a legendary lost burial site in 1930s Egypt.  Once there, they
and a rival group of explorers--who are in the hunt for some buried
treasure--end up uncovering something more than they bargained for: the
awakened mummy of the ancient High-priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), who is
determined to bring himself and his lost love back to full life.
What Sommers is clearly after is the rollicking roller coaster vibe of the
_Indiana_Jones_ films, but one little detail is lost on him.  While the
_Indy_ flicks were in the light, jaunty vein of old serial films, Steven
Spielberg knew that the tongue could and should not always be kept in
cheek.  The scary parts were indeed scary; the suspenseful moments were
taken seriously.  The same cannot be said of _The_Mummy_, which wears a
silly, jokey attitude throughout and suffers for it.  How can one truly be
frightened or intimidated by Imhotep and his murderous rage when each
would-be shock is blunted by an idiotic wisecrack (which _every_ character
seems have ready) or slapsticky situation?
It would also help if the creature's appearance were scary or at least
creepy; unless you lose sleep over the Cryptkeeper from
_Tales_from_the_Crypt_, likely the sight of the mummified Imhotep won't
invade even a daydream.  In fact, with the exception of some impressive
visuals involving the movement of sand, the effects work in _The_Mummy_ is
strangely unconvincing.  The walking undead and deadly Scarab beetles look
like they never left the computer screen, and the opening shot--showing a
giant sphinx and pyramids as workers and others scurry by--is no more
lifelike than the nearly identical opening shot of _The_Prince_of_Egypt_.
Not that the flesh-and-blood actors are themselves give the film much
life, either.  Fraser has proven to be a terrific actor in small films as
diverse as the romantic fantasy _Still_Breathing_ to last fall's
Oscar-winning _Gods_and_Monsters_, but when it comes to big time popcorn
films, he always falls flat, to say the least.  First it was his painfully
broad turn in the unwatchable _George_of_the_Jungle_; now it's this
half-hearted attempt to channel Harrison Ford's roguish charm.  More
successful at evoking _Indiana_Jones_ is Weisz, but in the wrong way: her
Evelyn is only a notch less shrill than Kate Capshaw's Willie Scott
(_Indiana_Jones_and_the_Temple_of_Doom_), easily the worst heroine in the
_Indy_ series.
_The_Mummy_ definitely does not bore; it holds one's attention for its
entire running time, and the millions of its megabudget do show up on
screen.  But shouldn't an adventure film at least offer something
resembling excitement?

The trouble with remakes is that unless you have not seen their forefathers,
you will think you are witnessing cinematic artistry at its lowest. I cannot
advise someone retouching a classic, understated horror classic like "The
Mummy" (1932) which starred the incomparable Boris Karloff, or one of its best
remakes with Christopher Lee in 1959. This overheated, 90's version of the
Mummy attempts to throw everything into the mix including the kitchen sink. As
a result, it sacrifices its original storyline entirely, and what we have is a
Mummy for the Indiana Jones mindset - one of the film's many unforgiving
faults. 
The film begins promisingly with the Egyptian prince, ImHoTep, punished for
having an adulterous affair with the pharaoh's daughter. His tongue is cut, and
he is consequently buried in bandages in a tomb full of scrappy, ugly scarabs
(beetle-like bugs). We flash forward thousands of years later where ImHoTep's
tomb is uncovered by a team of explorers seeking the Book of the Dead (If I
recall correctly, there is more than one version in the catacombs!). One of the
explorers is an ambitious Egyptologist (Rachel Weiz), who has trouble
preventing bookcases from toppling at the Museum of Antiquities!
Once the Book of Dead is discovered and the forbidden sayings are uttered, all
hell breaks loose as ImHoTep rises from the dead and slowly regenerates his
human form. His objective is to bring back his beloved from the dead after
commanding all the thunderstorms and sandstorms in his wrath - all in the name
of love. 
"The Mummy" tries to be a fusion of Indiana Jones and horror cliches, and
attempts to tell a tragic love story as well. None work or blend easily. For
one, casting Brendan Fraser as a bland, stock Indiana Jones hero who's barely
shocked or scared by the Mummy is not wise - he does not have the integrity or
fierceness of Harrison Ford. Rachel Weiz is too cute and shrilly as the female
lead - she is more appropriate for a screwball comedy than a film of this type.
Arnold Vosoloo is the mean Egyptian mummy but his cold smile and angry eyes
are overshadowed by the whirlwind special-effects - this mummy does not even
wear bandages! He just evaporates and blows like a twister from one place to
another. Where is the sense of menace and succinct body language of Boris
Karloff? Whatever sense of loss emanated from ImHoTep's love affair is trampled
by an exceeding number of special-effects and histrionic action sequences. But
wait a doggone minute: Is this a horror film or an action picture?
"The Mummy" is a mindless blockbuster...but there are no delicious quips, no
sense of adventure, and no peril. Some of it may be considered serviceable fun
for young minds and there are some spellbinding sequences (the face-like
formations on the sand are fabulous). But it's a joyless enterprise - more of a
promo for extraordinary digital special-effects like "The Matrix" than a movie.
All you'll receive from this parched Mummy is a headache.

Universal Pictures, once was the bastion of the Horror genre. Such
venerable American icons as the Frankenstein Monster, Count Dracula,
Lawrence Talbot, the Wolfman, and in the 50's, The Creature; have
scared and endeared themselves to the movie going public. One of
Universal Pictures most maligned creations, Karis, the Mummy; was
relegated to the moderate level of 'B' picture. Having no other
purpose that to come back to life to aid a conniving Egyptian Priest
in his attempt to preserve their riches. All this while Karis himself
tried vainly to recapture the reincarnated Princess Annunka. While
these films were enjoyable programmers, they were never considered
classics and rightly so. The only film to gather any notoriety was the
original 1932 version of "The Mummy" which stared the venerable Boris
Karloff in the role of the dreaded Imhotep. In this new appraisal of
the classic tale, Director Stephen Sommers has created a sometimes
amusing, but mostly barren piece of fluff.
In a nicely constructed prologue, we witness the murder of the Pharaoh
by his Mistress, Anck-Su-Namun and her lover, the high Priest
Imhotep. Imhotep's lover sacrifices herself so that the Priest can
escape and through his magic, return her spirit to her
body. Unfortunately, the Pharaoh's guard interrupt the proceeding and
mummify the Priest in a dreaded procedure that has Imhotep buried
alive in a sarcophagus full of flesh eating beetles.
Flash forward to the 1920's. Rick O'Connell (Brendan Frazer) is
fighting off an army of unidentified Arabian fighters. As the army
decimates his men, O'Connell outruns the hordes until a huge statue
corners him. His pursuers suddenly turn and run away. O'Connell turns
and sees that he is standing beneath the statue of Anubis, the resting
place of Imhotep. The sands move and erupt, taking on the appearance
of the dreaded Priest, threatening to swallow O'Connell. He escapes
and wanders the desert. Finally captured and placed in a Moroccan
jail, he waits for his execution.
To his rescue, comes Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) and her brother Jonathan
(John Hannah), who discover that O'Connell may know the location of
the fabled city of the dead, Hamunaptra. The expedition
begins. O'Connell and Evelyn develop an uneasy romantic relationship,
as they uncover Imhotep's tomb. Unfortunately, another troupe of
treasure hunters led by actor Jonathan Hyde, follows them.  Finding
the tomb, Imhotep is released from his slumber and proceeds to murder
those who opened his crypt, taking their organs for his own
use. Imhotep soon kidnaps Evelyn to use as a sacrifice to the old
Egyptian gods, in preparation to brining his beloved Anck-Su-Namun
back to live.
The plot, as described above is pretty much, all there is to the
film. There are several other developments and sequences that deserve
attention, but they are of fleeting entertainment value. Suffice to
say that, there are moments of good fun in this film, but not enough
to warrant the 124 minute running time. At this length, the film seems
overly long. The script is wont with contrivances and plot holes. Once
Imhotep starts to wander about Egypt, the special effects take center
stage. While there are some very good visuals in the film, I had the
strange feeling that I was actually watching an old Charles Schneer
production.  Scenes of the computer generated mummy, it's skeleton
visible through sections of it's anatomy (imagine the Aurora model kit
of Grey's Anatomy, with some gauze raped around it and you'll get the
picture). Unfortunately, I kept being reminded of Ray Harryhausen's
Dynamation effects, rather than any sort of dread that these scenes
may have had. While the effects are quiet enjoyable and stunning, they
don't have that fission , that 'oh my gosh!' quality that drives this
kind of picture.
The performances are nothing special in the film. Brendan Fraser does
an okay job of filling in the matinee idol part. He fills the 'Indian
Jones' role quite well in fact. Mr. Fraser is one of those rare actors
that seems to enjoy the absurdity of the project he is involved in. A
refreshingly joyous quality.  However, his climatic fight with horde
of mummified warriors introduces lots of Hong Kong Wu-Shu type martial
arts, which are completely incongruous with his character and the
setting. I don't think most westerners had the opportunity to study
under the Shaolin monks at that time in history. But, this is a
fantasy, so it's forgivable to an extent.
Rachel Weisz brings to her character of Evelyn a nice dry wit. Her
comic timing is very refreshing. Moreover in a film being marketed as
a horror / adventure, the character should be a least a little
frightened. John Hannah as Evelyn's brother, Jonathan is completely
wasted. His character does nothing but whine and comment on the
proceedings, only occasionally getting involved in the action.  One of
the most interesting and ultimately most frustrating casting notes in
the film is the inclusion of Bernard Fox as the aging and slightly mad
Corporal Wilson. The character brings a welcome bit of comic relief to
the film that is not derived from the constant one-liners and
slapstick situations that abound in the film. Unfortunately, the
character is used solely as a device in which to get the characters to
their destination after which, he is conveniently killed off.
Kevin O'Connor is creepily amusing in his part of the cowardly,
Beni. His confrontation with Imhotep, wherein he tries to protect
himself from the approaching monster by holding up several holy
artifacts he wares around his neck. When he finally holds up the Star
of David, Imhotep recognizes the symbol as belonging to the Slaves of
his time, and takes the former guide as his accomplice promising him
untold riches. Unfortunately, Mr. O'Connor is afforded much too much
screen time, and consequently, the character becomes less and less
threatening, finally ending as a buffoon.
Arnold Vosloo is actually quiet good in the role of the re-constituted
Priest Imhotep. Having appeared opposite Lance Henrickson in John
Woo's "Hard Target" and the two 'Darkman' sequels, Vosloo carries with
him an appropriate air of menace and stature that are a welcome
benefit to the film. Vosloo is a natural screen villain. His charisma
is that good.
The script for "The Mummy" is comic book from start to finish. While
there is nothing wrong with that, what the script lacks is a sense of
dread that any horror film needs to have. All the adventure and action
in the world has no value without a sense of danger. Since none of the
characters express any sense of jeopardy, it is hard to feel involved
in the proceedings. While the film is enjoyably kinetic, it would have
benefited from a little more suspense and less visual buffoonery.
Also, there are the dreaded instances of contrivance throughout the
film. The inclusion of the flesh eating beetles as part of the
mummification process in the prologue of the film is a nice and creepy
touch. Yet having the pests remain alive after 3000 years of
starvation (not much to chow on in a sealed crypt), is a bit of a
stretch.  Furthermore, these beetles continue to crawl all over
Imhotep after he starts to replace his organs, the bugs crawling in
and out of his flesh. Why these bugs just don't eat the darn guy up
again is something that I cannot explain. A quick thanks should also
go to the prop managers who managed to leave a convenient assortment
of camels at the tomb for our heroes to escape on when the entire city
of the dead collapses in on itself.
As it stands, "THE MUMMY" is a fun time waster. There is nothing in
the film that will linger after you've left the theater. And the
possibility of a franchise is moot at best. It should be mentioned
that there are scenes of a grotesque nature in the film that may not
be acceptable for younger viewers. The PG-13 rating is an accurate
one.

Running Time: 2 hours 4 minutes
Picture the scene. Three Universal studios executives are sitting around a
large table deciding what their big summer blockbuster should be for 1999...
EXEC ONE: Aw man, after Babe 2, we *need* a hit man, or we're history!
EXEC TWO: Hell, I know. What the heck are we going to do?
EXEC THREE: Hey, I heard about this great movie, right, called 'The Mummy.'
It had Doris Karloff in it, or someone. You guys seen this movie?
EXEC THREE: That's okay, neither have I. So how about we just take the Mummy
character and put it in another film, and call it a remake or something.
Frickin' excellent idea, eh?
EXEC ONE: Holy mother of Jesus H. Christ, you're right! We don't have to
relate it to the original movie, none of the kids would have seen it. We'll
just fill it with impressive special effects by Industrial Light and Magic
and watch the money flood in!
EXEC TWO: Yeah! YEAH! And let's get a corny script, you know, one where the
hero says things like 'I gamble with my life, not cards.' And the rest of
the script contains words like 'gasp,' 'swoon,' and 'run.'
EXEC THREE: Yeah, you guys are getting the idea! Now, we'll need to hire
some cheap actors. We can't afford Harrison Ford, so let's get Brendan
Fraiser from George of the Jungle to play the lead character! I'm sure he
can do a great impression of Harry! And brit chick is in, but we can't
afford Kate Winslet after the special effect budget of Babe 2, so let's get
Rachel Weisz in instead! She has a English accent, right? And we'll have
John Hannah who serves no other purpose but to be annoying. We'll need
someone passive and non to domineering as the mummy, as most of the mummy
will be special effects, so lets get Arnold Vosloo to do this. Total cast
price: $10,000.
EXEC ONE: O.K, director. I think Mummy, I think suspense, danger, jump
scenes and action. Now we can't get Spielberg, Wes Craven or anyone good
really. I know...how about...that hack who did Deep Rising, you
know...Stephen Sommers! He can put together some knockabout fun and reduce
some of the tension from the film.
EXEC TWO: I'm loving this every minute! And let's introduce the Mummy one
hour into the film, so just as everyone is about to walk out or die from the
lame script, they'll come back for the second half of the film, which is
actually just Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.
EXEC THREE:  Bonza! I'll go tell the
boss!
Well, there you have it, the complete story of the The Mummy was placed into
production. The Mummy is, no doubt, a hideous movie with poor acting and bad
direction. But the film is good humoured and natured, and should be taken
not so seriously. If you turn your brain off, lower your expectations and
expect good humour than The Mummy is the sort of knockabout entertainment
that's missing from the glut of 'serious' fare that's dominating the cinema,
and worth a look.

A "B" movie wrapped in a winding cloth of "A" special effects. Universal
unleashes a film that feels like a ride at its studios in L.A. -- classic
Hollywood hoopla! Hundreds of screaming soldiers on horses, crashing
biplanes, scary monsters, and a wide-eyed Bob Hope kind of light-heartedness
"The Mummy" is not heavy drama ... it's scary-lite.
In ancient Egypt a man is naughty with the Pharaoh's mistress. She kills
herself and they mummify him alive. (You'd think that'd to teach 'em.)
However, much later (1923) an American adventurer (Indiana Jones without the
edgemacation) hooks up with a Hieroglyphics reading librarian and her
brother. Together they sort of accidentally awaken the mummy, whose "soul
mission" is to wreak havoc with its "human race ending" evil.
The crude toughened cowboy whose only knowledge is his experience couples
(in tasty contrast) with the clumsy, but proper librarian whose only
knowledge is theory. Though the film sets itself up rather nicely from a
scripting point of view; once the mummy kidnaps the girl, it isn't too much
more than a special effects vehicle.
What the movie did excellently: Pharaoh's Mistress' costume -- a great intro
to the film. Music - as powerful as were the special effects awesome.
Chuckles -- I laughed out loud more than a few times. And of course, KILLER
SPECIAL EFFECTS. The first appearance of the mummy is genuinely awe
inspiring.
What kept the movie from truly being great: Camels out run horses. A row of
soldiers stands in the line of fire, just to fall dramatically when shot. An
overkill climax that subtracts from the drama. Overuse of a great bugs
visual. And all though Brendan Fraser's first scream at the mummy is
pricelessly hilarious, all others thereafter fall short. But, the hardest
hit to this "big picture" was a cartoon-like plane crash that spanked a
disappointingly out-of-place end to a fantastic special effects sequence.
Though plagued a bit with bugs, "The Mummy" is still a whole heck of a lot
of fun.
Starring Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz.
Screenplay and direction by Stephen Sommers.
Produced by James Jacks and Sean Daneil at Univeral/Alphaville.
Rated PG-13.
