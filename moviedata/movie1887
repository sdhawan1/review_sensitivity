     CAPSULE: In a current-day cross-country trip a man picks up a
hitchhiker who claims to be Elvis Presley.  Harvey Keitel, Johnathon
Schaech, and Bridget Fonda star.  David Winkler directs the film with a
lot of heart.  Rating: 7 (0 to 10), 2 (-4 to +4)
   - A man haunted by the death of his wife a year earlier picks up a
     hitchhiker who is more trouble than he is worth.  He is a
     freeloader without money and though he does not look the part he
     claims to be Elvis Presley.  This is a warm film along the lines
     of MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET.  It toys with (without endorsing) the
     para-religious cult of worshipers of Elvis.
   - Not much resemblance to Presley, but perhaps that works.
   - That Keitel is good will come as little surprise.  Bridget Fonda
     pulls off a real tour de force as a Marilyn Monroe impressionist,
     even doing her own singing impression of Monroe.  Johnathon
     Schaech, a Peter Gallagher look-alike, holds his own as the main
     character.
   - Priscilla Presley is executive producer, though her contribution
     was mostly after production started.  She checked the script for
     accuracy and arranged for shooting at Graceland.
   - Nice regional photography.
   - It seems unlikely that main character would let anyone else drive
     his classic car.
   - Keitel does not do his own singing.
   - Definitely an enjoyable film even for people who are not Elvis
     fans (which includes me).
   - It is not clear if there is supposed to be a surprise twist
     involving the car accident.  You don't have to be Sherlock Holmes
     to figure it out.  Yet the script makes it seem like something
     kept secret.
