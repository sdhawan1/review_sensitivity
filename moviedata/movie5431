Winner of the Best Director award at this year's Cannes Film Festival,
"Yi Yi (A One and a Two)" is a broad, philosophical look at modern life
in Taiwan.  NJ (Nien-Jen Wu, writer/director of "A Borrowed Life") is a 
middle aged father of two who's facing a crisis at his electronics firm 
and the unsettling appearance of an old flame (Su-Yun Ko) while
his wife Min Min (Elaine Jin, "A Brighter Summer Day") suffers a breakdown.  
His teenage daughter Ting Ting (Kelly Lee) is involved in a love triangle 
complicated by musical competition with her best friend.  Eight year old 
Yang Yang (Jonathan Chang) has an unrequited crush and a budding passion for 
photography.  NJ's live-in mother-in-law (Ru-Yun Tang) is dying and his 
brother-in-law Ah Di (Hsi-Sheng Chen) is still being pursued by his old 
girfriend even though he's newly married to an expectant bride.
Writer/director Edward Yang's ("A Brighter Summer Day") "Yi Yi" is one of
the year 2000's most satisfying films on many levels.  The story, while 
playing like a soap opera on the surface, is chock full of wry human
observations while showing great affection for its characters.  Technically,
the film is striking in every aspect.
Nien-Jen Wu gives a note perfect performance as the beleaguered NJ.  With
little dialogue, Wu is always sympathetic as his character provides an anchor
for the confused adults who orbit around him.  NJ himself is only able to turn 
to Ota (Issey Ogata), the Japanese businessman NJ wishes to partner with.
Ota looks like the makings of a long time friend and provides much needed
advice cloaked in metaphor.  The other anchor in "Yi Yi" is the dying 
grandmother, another character of few words.  Min Min believes her life is 
empty after realizing that she tells her mother the same things daily and 
it 'only takes a minute' while Ting Ting obsesses over the drama in her life.  
In the film's opening scene, Ah Di's old girlfriend 'apologizes' to the 
grandmother at the wedding reception hall for not marrying her son.  Young 
Yang Yang waits for the film's closing funeral to speak his oddly mature and
though-proking piece.
Every woman in the film has her moment of hysterics except for grandma and
the moody, melancholy Ting Ting, who is at the receiving end of her best 
friend's condemnation for seeing her boyfriend, Fatty (Pang Chang Yu).  
Sherry, NJ's former fiance now married for the third time to an American in 
Chicago, arranges to meet him on a business trip to Tokyo obviously hoping to 
resume the relationship only to spend the weekend haranguing him for abandoning
her all those years ago.  Most of the film's gentle humor comes via Yang Yang
whether he's arriving home drenched and unnoticed or patiently explaining
to his uncle Ah Di that he's taken pictures of the backs of peoples' heads
as a service because they can't seem them themselves.
Yang and his cinematographer Wei-han Yang have created  a bold color design 
which shifts from reds (Ah Di's wedding), to yellows (Ting Ting's first
love) and blues (NJ's Tokyo interlude) before finally giving over to black
and white (grandmother's funeral).  Characters are framed in storefronts,
by pillars, trees and doorways and reflected upon by the outside world.
The film's editor, Bo-Wen Chen, expertly cuts among all the interweaving
plot threads, never more beautifully than when Sherry describes her and NJ's
first date as Ting Ting repeats the action in another time zone.  Kai-Li
Peng's score subtly creates mood.
While not every character's story line is as compelling as the others, such
is the way of life, and life is celebrated in all its glories, tragedies,
foolishness and profundity in "Yi Yi."

NJ Jian (Wu Nienjen) is at a mid-life crossroads but doesn't know it. His
family suffers through one crisis after another and his business,
prosperous only a year ago, is on the brink of bankruptcy. He is beginning
to question the direction his life has taken when he has a chance encounter
with Sherry (Ke Suyun), his first love and the girl he left behind, without
a word, decades ago. But, this is just the beginning of the stories of the
people who populate the family drama from Taiwan, director Edward Yang's
"Yi-Yi."
The "normal" problems of NJ's existence are further complicated on the day
(a fortuitous one according to the almanac) his debt-ridden brother-in-law,
A-Di (Chen Xisheng), gets married to the very pregnant Xiao Yan (Xiao
Shushen). The wedding, a raucous affair, is disrupted with the appearance
of Yun-Yun (Zeng Xinyi), A-Di's jilted girlfriend. NJ and his wife, Min-Min
(Elaine Jin), are suddenly called away from the reception when they learn
that Min-Min's mother collapsed and was rushed to the hospital.
Grandma (Tang Ruyun) is sent home, in a coma, to be cared for by her
family. Although it is unlikely that she will recover, the doctor
encourages the other family members to talk to the unconscious grandmother
because, maybe, she can hear them. Min-Min can't take the strain as she
comes to realize that her life is wasted - "I tell grandma about my day and
it only takes a minute," she bemoans as she runs off to seek the guidance
of her spiritual teacher, the Master. Her children, Ting-Ting (Kelly Lee)
and Yang-Yang (Jonathan Chang), also have problems talking to the silent
grandma. Ting-Ting blames herself for grandma's mishap, while Yang-Yang
refuses to talk to his grandmother at all.
Meanwhile, NJ is trying to save his stagnant company and it is suggested
that he and his partners team up with a brilliant Japanese games designer,
Ota (Issey Ogata). NJ is chosen to wine and dine the innovator and a fast
friendship develops between the two men. But, the plans they make are soon
subverted by NJ's partners who make a deal with a Taiwan tycoon, Boss
Huang, and opt to use pirated software rather than the quality product that
Ota can provide.
While all this is going on, Ting-Ting begins a romance with Fatty after he
tells her he is no longer dating Lili (Adrian Lin), Ting-Ting's new
neighbor and friend. Eight year old Yang-Yang gets in trouble at school and
has no one to turn to with mom in the mountains and dad trying to save his
business. Little Yang-Yang also harbors a crush on a pretty classmate who
swims. A-Di's investment manager has gone broke and fled the country,
leaving the luckless A-Di with nothing. Yun-Yun still feels she has control
over A-Di and crashes the couple's baby shower. Xiao Yan later finds A-Di
unconscious in a gas filled bathroom. Is it by accident or by design?
NJ, thinking the deal with Ota is genuine, heads to Tokyo for more
discussion and, coincidentally, to meet Sherry. His jilted lover still
carries a torch for the handsome, taciturn NJ, but he tells her, during a
private interlude, that he does not have those feelings anymore. He left
her, decades before, because he could not tell her, then, that she and her
mother were stifling him and forcing him down a path not wanted. Ongoing,
also, are the underhanded dealings of NJ's partners as Boss Huang forms an
"alliance" with the sexy owner of the knock off company and drives NJ's
business further down. On the home front, Ting-Ting is summoned from school
and learns that Fatty has attacked and brutally murdered a tutor who has
been having an affair with Fatty's old lover, Lili, and her mother.
There is even more going on in this epic-scoped soap opera of the life of
an extended family than what I have already described. The complex story,
written by helmer Yang, is a rich mining of the emotions, needs and desires
of normal people. Far from creating larger-than-life beings whose problems
are loftier than those for us mere mortals, the world of "Yi-Yi" teams with
average folk with very human flaws. At the center is NJ, a quiet,
intelligent man who is comfortable in his reserve. He learned, early in his
life, to go after what he wanted, not what was expected of him. As his
family faces their own crises, NJ, from the time he spent with the
deep-thinking Ota, relearns the lessons of life, once again taking matters
into his own hands.
With NJ as the anchor of "Yi-Yi" (English title is "A One and a Two?"), the
rest of the players are given free reign on their individual tales of love,
sadness, pain and pleasure. Some stories, like NJ and Ota and NJ and
Sherry, are more compelling than the others, but they are all intriguing in
their own way. This is one of those rare films, with a run-time of 173
minutes, which you beg to continue when the credits start to roll. Edward
Yang ties things up nicely at the end, but his storytelling is so masterful
that you want to see what happens next in this elegant family drama.
Capitalizing on the rich screenplay is the textured, beautifully composed
photography by Yang Weihan who frames every shot like a gorgeous
photograph. Helmer Yang uses the extended, near silent photography to allow
us to linger on the images up on the screen. It's almost like a leisurely
stroll in an art gallery to gander at the works of a master. The languid
pace afforded the wonderful cinematography pads the running time
considerably, but is such a visual pleasure you don't notice the time. The
visual impact of the film is key to its overall high quality. Of course,
production design, costume, the brilliant use of colors to change the films
mood and the rest of the techs all contribute to this superior work.
The vast ensemble cast revolves around Wu Nienjen as NJ. The screenwriter
turned actor/director plays the strong, silent type here, but a man with a
great deal of emotion and feeling under his inscrutable surface. The
terrific cast around him is too numerous to catalogue, but they all give
solid performances right down to little Yang-Yang, whose final speech over
grandma's casket tells it all. From the mouths of babes?.
"Yi-Yi" is a true universal film that has appeal across cultural and racial
boundaries as it tells its stories of the day-to-day lives and plights of
normal people in normal, and sometimes not-so-normal, times as they cope
with life's difficulties, both large and small. Kudos to Edward Yang with
his Taiwan-contender for Best Foreign Film this year. I give it an A.

"Yi Yi, which literally translates to 'one-one' means 'individually' in
Chinese. This signifies the film's portrayal of life through each individual
member at each representing age from birth to death. 'A One and a Two and
a...' is what's always muttered by Jazz musicians before a jam session ...
to signify what's following the title is not something tense, or heavy or
stressful. Life should be like a jazzy tune." Director, Edward Yang.
With a gentle pace the film clocks in at just shy of three hours. Moving
along with serene steps, the gait simulates the pace of real life. Save for
a few indulgences in drawn-out silent shots, the film moves wonderfully
through the night - giving one the feeling of an experience rather than a
spectacle.
"Yi Yi" centers on NJ, a middle-aged man with a wife and two children, as he
meanders through crises in his marriage and work life. His first love pops
up after thirty years to make matters even more interesting. Ting-Ting, the
teen daughter, also must navigate matters of the heart as she wrestles with
the guilt of her grandmother's illness amidst the emotional whirlwind of
dealing with the opposite sex. NJ's young son, Yang Yang, poked and prodded
by the older girls at school, plots his mischievous revenge. Then there's
NJ's brother-in-law who becomes a husband and father in the same month; he
must field the repercussive actions of his old girlfriend.
It's the confident direction that instills a marvel to the film. Though, the
lovely real people with real problems to care about certainly help. In fact,
(again aside from the few indulgences by the young boy and Japanese
businessman) the film is quite photo-realistic - a slice of modern life in
Taiwan, which has the added bonus of educating those who are unfamiliar with
the Taiwanese.
This nice picture has a few scratches; isolated bits of excessive profundity
bubble up like bulges in a perfectly round tube. And being a slice of life,
there isn't any one strongly focused theme, though tidbits of philosophical
thought are tossed about.
The film takes firm grasp our sympathies, and though never losing hold of
our interest seldom evokes strong emotions.
NJ's wife sits at the bedside of a relative who has fallen into a coma,
"Talking to you is like prayer. I'm not sure the other party can hear. I
wonder if I'm sincere enough. (Sobs in self-pity) Would you wake up if you
were me?"

     It wasn't fair.  For more than 10 years, Taiwanese director Edward
Yang made movies that were runaway hits in Asia and at festivals around
the world, but the films weren't released commercially in the United
States.  With Yi Yi, that's all changed, and the only question now is,
"What took so long?"
     Nearly everything about Yi Yi is odd and wonderful.  The movie
revolves around a middle-class family in Taipei struggling with everyday
life.  The main character is an uptight businessman named NJ whose
company faces bankruptcy.  His wife is a delicate woman who breaks down
when her mother suffers a stroke.  The family's youngest member, a
precocious 10-year-old boy, is preoccupied with photographing the backs
of people's heads. And the boy's sister is a student musician who falls
for the wrong guy.
        What makes Yi Yi special are its small details and absurd plot twists. 
At his brother-in-law's wedding, NJ (played with understated brilliance
by Wu Nienjen) runs into a former girlfriend, who yells at him for
deserting their relationship 20 years earlier.  NJ wants to reconcile
with his beautiful ex, but she is married, and he is a family man. 
Guilt-ridden and stressed by work, NJ finds refuge in the music of Bob
Dylan and other artists, listening to their songs on headphones while
figuring out what to do next.  After spending one night in a karaoke
bar, he gets the courage to call his old flame (aided by alcohol and the
advice of a wise Japanese game designer) and is soon flying to Tokyo to
get his "second chance" at love.
Yi Yi, which opens with a wedding and ends with a death, isn't for
everyone.  For moviegoers who need Hollywood stars, car chases,
shootings, and dramatic sexual posturing to stir their cinematic pulse,
the movie will seem like a long, boring waste of time.  Can you name
another film that lingers forever on a cloudy sky and the sound of
wind?  And what other recent film outside the oeuvre of Jim Carrey has
used urination as a transition device?  Yi Yi is poetic and crude,
literary and streetwise, serious and funny.  It is an international hit
in the best sense of the term, winning Yang the best director prize at
Cannes and the top honor from the National Society of Film Critics in
New York.  (Yi Yi beat out Traffic for this recent U.S. award.)
Music is a fundamental part of Yi Yi.  For the English translation of
the movie's title, Yang chose A One and a Two as a nod to the saying
uttered by jazz musicians. "(It's) to signify that what's following the
title is not something tense, or heavy or stressful," Yang told an
interviewer.  "Life should be like a jazzy tune."
If I had qualms with Yi Yi, it was with the film's first half-hour, when
so many characters were introduced at such a dizzying pace, it was hard
to keep track of developments and who was with whom.  Schmaltzy opening
music also detracted from the film, but in the big picture, these are
just quibbles.
Yang, whose best-known previous work is A Brighter Summer Day, is 53
years old.  With the critical success of Yi Yi, he has received more
offers to make films in the United States.  Perhaps he'll follow in the
footsteps of Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), Taiwan's most
successful director, who has already made the transition from China to
the West.  Yang himself is no stranger to America.  Born in Shanghai and
raised in Taipei, he studied in Los Angeles at USC film school, dropping
out after one semester to work as a computer and systems designer in
Seattle.  Yi Yi is full of references to U.S. culture.  The film's mix
of East and West and its urban setting are two more reasons Yi Yi may
seem relatively familiar to new audiences in North America.
Wherever you live, the film is worth seeking out.

To best enjoy "Yi Yi," I suggest you do the following: Stay in your car
for a moment when you arrive at the theater. Breathe in and out
deliberately, allowing your system to slow down. Remind yourself that
movies can be more than rapid-fire edits, explosions and dick jokes.
Continue the conscious breathing until you feel relaxed and centered,
then proceed to the box office.
Set in contemporary Taiwan, "Yi Yi" is a rich look at a middle class
Taipei family. Written and directed by the very talented Edward Yang,
the film (his seventh, but the first to be distributed in America)
presents a glossy family portrait as a completed jigsaw puzzle, then
begins removing the pieces. With affection and an unflinching lens, he
reveals the vast distances between people who are supposedly very close.
At the center of it all is Yang-Yang (Jonathan Chang), a bright-eyed
8-year-old boy with a habit of asking hard questions ("Daddy, I can't
see what you see and you can't see what I see. How can we know more than
half the truth?"). After numerous adults pat him on the head and move
away, he comes up with his own suppositions and acts on them, using a
camera to make his statement. Yang-Yang takes a series of photos of the
back of people's heads. Asked why, he explains to a subject, "You
couldn't see it, so I showed you."
His relatives are too preoccupied to think about what he has said.
Shortly after a raucous wedding, Yang-Yang's grandmother has a stroke
and goes into a coma. She eventually ends up at home, with doctors
encouraging her loved ones to try and stimulate her senses by talking to
her. The process proves to be more difficult than it sounds. NJ (Wu
Nienjen), the family patriarch, compares it to praying, because "you're
not sure the other party can hear, and you're not sure whether you're
sincere." His wife Min-Min (Elaine Jin) ends up in tears, exclaiming, "I
have nothing to say to Mother. I tell her the same things every day. I
have so little. How can it be so little? I live a blank."
Mom lights out for a mountain temple to meditate, leaving NJ in an even
more surreal space. The electronics executive runs into Sherry (Ke
Suyun), his first love, a woman he has not seen for 30 years. She is as
shattered by the encounter as he, following him to sputter, "Why didn't
you come that day? I waited and waited. I never got over it."
Why we end up with the people we do is a recurring theme in "Yi Yi." And
what if we had made different choices? NJ ponders these questions while
hanging with his friend, Mr. Ota (Issey Ogata), a Japanese games
designer with a gift for classical piano. NJ treats Ota with deference
and something approaching awe  Ota seems to serve the same function as
Min-Min's guru  but there are no obvious answers. He finally calls
Sherry, who wonders aloud, despite the fact that she too is married, if
they should pick up where they left off.
Mind you, this is just one relatively small part of a very large film.
Every member of the family has his or her own set of joys and
challenges, with decidedly more of the latter than the former. Director
Yang gently weaves together their circumstances, leisurely, but not
lazily. "Yi Yi" is nearly three hours long, but the film never lags,
drifting by like a silk ribbon on a breezy day. Yang knows the correct
pace for his story and expects us to be smart enough to adjust to it.
There are pauses inserted throughout the film. At one point he cuts to
an image of clouds against a blue sky and, by my count, holds the shot
for 19 seconds, which would be an eternity in most studio productions.
But pauses like that allow extra time for reflection, and a film like
this offers much upon which to reflect.
Yang further accents his character studies with striking camerawork.
Many scenes are filmed against, or through, reflective glass, presenting
the outside of these interior worlds. Where most directors overuse
close-ups in personal moments, Yang favors medium to long shots and,
rather than distancing the viewer, the placement makes the scenes seem
more intimate. We study the well-composed settings and listen to the
people in the middle that are trying to make sense of the life racing by
them. Watching them makes it a bit easier to put one's own crisis du
jour in context, just one of the many gifts that "Yi Yi" has to offer.

 YI YI (A ONE AND A TWO) (director/writer: Edward Yang;
 cinematographer: Yang Weihan; editor: Chen Bowen; cast: Jonathan Chang
 (Yang-Yang), Yupang Chang (Fatty), Chen Xisheng (A-Di), Elaine Jin
 (Min-Min), Ke Suyun (Sherry Chang-Breitner), Kelly Lee (Ting-Ting),
 Adrian Lin (Lili), Issey Ogata (Mr. Ota), Tang Ruyun (Grandma),
 Michael Tao (Da-Da), Wu Nienjen (NJ Jian), Xiao Shushen (Xiao Yan), Xu
 Shuyuan (Lili's Mother), Zeng Xinyi (Yun-Yun); Runtime: 173; Winstar
 Cinema; 2000-Taiwan/France)
It should duly be noted this film won best film for 2000 by both the New
York Critics Circle and the National Society of Film Critics over the
popular other Taiwanese film nominated, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.
Edward Yang (A Brighter Summer Day (1991)) wrote and directed Yi Yi;
it's a 173-minute, contemporary film set in Taipei, about the
middle-class Jian family and their individual struggles to find
happiness. The family includes: the taciturn father NJ (Wu Nienjen), the
sullen mother Min-Min (Elaine Jin), the sexually awakening high-school
daughter Ting-Ting (Kelly Lee), the precocious eight year old Yang-Yang
(Jonathan Chang), and the feeling too old grandmother (Tang Ruyun). They
are all overwhelmed by what is happening to them, and feel stuck and all
alone. They don't know how to communicate with each other, as each is
deeply troubled by their own concerns.
The movie begins with the chaotic wedding preparations for the groom,
A-Di (Chen Xisheng). He's Min-Min's brother and partner in a failing
software computer business with her husband. The blustering hustler's
uncouth bride, Xiao Yan (Xiao Shushen), is very obviously pregnant and
is marrying him at this late date because he superstitiously follows the
horoscope and this is listed as an auspicious day for the wedding. The
family looks very awkward together at the reception -  a portrait of the
bride and groom is not hung correctly, the family rigidly poses for
their wedding picture, and the groom's jilted girlfriend arrives
inebriated and uninvited; and, she then becomes hysterical upsetting the
reception.
By chance, NJ meets in the hotel lobby of the wedding reception his old
high-school flame, Sherry (Ke Suyun). He will say later on that she is
the only one he has ever loved, but for some unexplained reason he
failed to meet her at a critical time of their relationship and they
have not seen each other for over 20 years. She now lives in Chicago and
is married to a wealthy American businessman, who is doing business in
China.
Ting-Ting (Kelly Lee) feels guilty that granny has a stroke. At home,
right after the wedding, she failed to take out the garbage in their
luxury hi-rise apartment and granny was found lying in the driveway next
to the dust bins. She believes granny was taking out the trash in place
of her. Granny is discharged from the hospital; and, while at home, she
remains bed-ridden and in a comatose state. The doctor suggests that
part of the family therapy should be that they each talk to her so that
she knows they care about her and this could stimulate her to awaken.
She will not awaken from that state, except later on when the saddened
teenage daughter has a fantasy scene that granny comforts her. When the
family members try to communicate with granny, none of them can. The
wife is upset that her life is in a rut and can only tell her trivial
things. The teenage girl prefers to play the piano for her. The young
kid doesn't know what to say. NJ can only suggest that the nurse reads
to her from the newspapers. While grandmother's son could only
shamefully boast that she shouldn't have worried so much about his bad
habits and the way he always borrowed money from others, he has now
invested wisely in stocks and is a rich man.
Within a few days Min-Min has a nervous breakdown and retreats to the
mountain spot where her guru will counsel her. The futility of this
venture is seen from the onset, when NJ writes the guru a check for his
services. The mother will be gone in her religious retreat, while each
member of the family goes through a crisis of their own. When she
returns, she reports that nothing has changed for her.
NJ's midlife crisis is played out in Tokyo where he goes to court for
his firm the only adult in the film he really respects, a Japanese
inventor of computer games, Ota (Issey Ogata). The two developed an
honest and intense relationship while Ota was in Taipei pitching his
product. Both NJ's company and Ota have fallen on hard times, and need
to have some cash flowing in; nevertheless, they are more concerned with
their individual needs. While in Tokyo he will also court the only one
he loves, as Sherry accompanies him there and they try to pick up where
they left off as teenagers. But they seem to run into the same problems
they had back then, an inability to reach each other despite the deep
feelings of love they profess.
Ting-Ting's problems will revolve around her relationship with her new
next door neighbor, a teenager called Lili (Adrian Lin). She immediately
becomes close friends with the cello playing Lili. But later on a
problem of loyalty arises between them, as the agitated boy called
"Fatty" (Yupang Chang) that Lili was going out with is now interested in
her. She has the same trouble in communicating in her relationship with
him, as her father has currently with Sherry in Tokyo.
Yang-Yang is not only the namesake of the director, but speaks for him
in this film.  He tells his father innocently: "I can't see what you see
and you can't see what I see. So how can I know what you see?" His
father gives him a camera and he feels satisfied to take pictures of the
backs of people's heads. He will tell granny when she's dead that he
wants to grow up to tell people what they don't know. He is interested
in discovering the truth people can't see about themselves. At one point
of the film the director through the character who reacts the most
emotional, the very thin "Fatty," tells his movie date that movies are
not a waste of time, but enrich one's life. They even increase your life
three times because the movies tell us about things we could never
possibly know. He gives one example of murder, but that didn't go over
too well with Ting-Ting.
This one is a masterpiece, despite it being as inexplicable as a great
work of music sometimes is. It lays out the grief facing a problematic
family and we see it happening, but we never quite understand why; and,
we will have to accept as an answer that is because individuals are very
complex and if they can't tell us what is on their mind, we can only
guess what they are thinking. And, isn't that the way you find it with
many people? Maybe finding happiness isn't so simple a matter. Maybe we
are destined to follow a certain course and even if given a second
chance would still make the same mistakes. The director knows that we
are all unique and have our own way of seeing things, and he respects
that. But whatever, there was a certain raw, undefinable power that this
great filmmaker has that makes this story fulfilling; even if, we are
never quite sure if we are fulfilled by what we saw. But one thing is
certain, you can't put this iconoclastic filmmaker in a box and label
him. I wouldn't miss this one. As entertaining a film as Crouching
Tiger... was, it didn't have this film's depth and poignancy.

YI YI, by Taiwanese writer and director Edward Yang, would be translated 
ONE ONE in English.  The American distributors have chosen instead the 
less literal English title of A ONE AND A TWO, probably because the 
movie is about the rhythms of life.  Although voted best picture of the 
year by one association of film critics, it is hardly that.  While 
certainly not a bad picture, it is a long, meandering one that is rarely 
compelling.  Still, with its artistic filming -- most conversations are 
intriguingly shot from a medium or long distance -- it is easy to see 
how critics might fall in love with it.
The relatively formless, slice-of-life plot follows a large number of 
characters.  While the performances are all genuine, the script has 
trouble eliciting either tears or laughs from the audience.  Even though 
the story isn't all it could be, Wei-han Yang's cinematography is 
exemplary from start to finish.  Most fascinating are the scenes shot 
through the glass of moving cars.  As we watch the reflected skyscrapers 
pass by, we listen to the conversation going on inside the cars.
The central character of the grandmother (Tang Ruyun) appears mainly 
comatose.  After falling tragically ill, she becomes a vegetable 
confessor for her family.  Throughout the story, people come to her to 
bare their souls, not knowing if she can hear them or not.   Her 
daughter, Min-Min (Elaine Jin), tells her with despair, "I live a 
blank."  Her son-in-law, NJ (Nien-Jen Wu), whose company is failing, 
tells her, "Frankly, there's very little I'm sure about these days."
8-year-old Yang-Yang (Jonathan Chang) is the film's most indelible 
character.  Having one of the wisest conversations that you've ever 
heard from a child of his age, he points out to his father that they can 
never really quite understand each other since they see different 
things.  Yang-Yang also argues that people can only see half of the 
truth since they can see in front of them but not behind.  
Least successful and more traditional are the canonically comical scenes 
like the one of kids dropping a water balloon on an unsuspecting 
passerby.  Other failed attempts at humor include Yang-Yang being 
falsely accused by his teacher of having a condom in his pocket -- it's 
actually a balloon -- and a noisy couple in the throws of passion heard 
through thin apartment walls.
Although it has its moments, YI YI is the type of movie that, if rented 
on tape, would be one that you would likely turn off after half an hour 
out of sheer lack of interest.  On the other hand, with an hour chopped 
off of its three bloated hours, who knows what might have been?  The 
potential is there.  
YI YI runs a very long 2:53.  The film is mainly in Mandarin with 
English subtitles.  It is not rated but would be an R for language and 
brief nudity and would be acceptable for teenagers.
The film is playing in limited release now in the United States.  In the 
Silicon Valley it is currently showing at the Towne Theatre in San Jose.

   The pleonastic title of this Taiwanese film reminds me of a
play by August Wilson that was staged off-Broadway some
time ago, "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom"--about the exploitation
of black musicians by white music producers.  Throughout
the play, the lead musician opened each number with "A one,
and a two, and y'all know what to do."  The director of "Yi Yi,"
who, by the way, garnered the well-deserved best director
award at the last Cannes Film Festival, stated in an interview
that the title serves double-duty (evidently enough).  While "Yi
Yi" literally means "one one," or "individually," a looser
translation is "a one and a two," the typical introduction to
jazz numbers--signifying here that nothing really serious is
going down.  In fact, what stands out from the direction of
this family saga is director Edward Yang's taking a complex,
generational family story which, if directed in the U.S., would
come out something like George Stevens' "Giant," serving it
to us as though the narrative really deals with only one or two
people.  Wang is like the shortstop at Wrigley Field who
makes a complex double-play seem like second nature,
requiring no effort at all.
   Patience, viewers.  During the first half hour, Wang throws
a stack of characters at us that could make you think that
heavy going's ahead.  How is he going to sort out this pot
pourri so that we absorb the characteristics of each person,
and then again, is this going to be one of those avant-garde
works that will continue through its almost three-hour length
like a loosely structured Robert Altman movie?  Not at all.
   There is a genuine focus and a sincere theme to the whole
tale.  The central figure, known as NJ (Nien-Jen Wu) because
people in the computer industry get American-style
nicknames, is undergoing a mid-life crisis, or more accurately,
a malaise.  In his mid-forties he is worried.  He is beginning
to wonder whether he has made mistakes early in life that
messed him up to such an extent that he will never be able to
retrieve the essence he probably sought as a teenager.  NJ is
a partner with a reasonably successful computer firm that
may go bottoms-up because it is not keeping up with the
times.  He needs to support his wife, Min-min (Elaine Jin), his
teenage daughter Ting-ting (Kelly) and his eight-year-old lad
Yang-yang (Jonathan Chang).  (The duplication of names is
further evidence that no matter how heavy the going, Wang
does not intend for us to take his story too seriously.) 
Because NJ looks honest, he is asked to negotiate a deal
with a Japanese designer, Ota (Issey Ogata)--but at a bad
time.  His mother-in-law (Tang Ru-yun) is in a coma and not
expected to live; his teen is involved in her first love affair
with a skinny kid named Fatty (Pung Chang Yu), and he has
just run into an old sweetheart, Sherry (Ko Su-yun) whom he
had stood up some twenty years ago, arranges secretly to
travel with her to Japan, and ponders a new life with this
woman who still wails about his leaving her in the lurch.
   The central narrative in itself may be nothing huge to write
home about, but Mr. Yang's power is in his close observation
of details.  He patiently holds several visuals for a minute or
more to give us in the audience a brief break between
dramatic scenes but more important to emphasize images of
high emotion to the characters.  He points out to the pride of
his U.S. audience the hold that American culture has on the
Taiwanese, shown by the Batman and Robin poster on the
eight-year-old's wall and the H&H (New York) bagels shop to
which the teens repair on dates if they have not already
booked tables at McDonald's.  Carefully foreshadowing items
that will assume importance later on, he has his A-1
cinematographer Yang Wei-han capture the beauties of
nature, particularly the cloud formations that come crashing
together yielding thunder and lightning--as though to show
that in life, the loveliness and the tempests are intertwined.  
Opening on a scene involving the wedding of NJ's brother-in-
law A-Di (Chen Hsi-sheng) and his pregnant partner Hsiao
Yen (Hsiao Shu-shen), Wang demonstrates how the
Taiwanese are at least as boisterous as any in a similar
situation in the U.S. when the drinks are freely flowing.
   Of particular charm is the dialogue conducted in English
between the Japanese game designer and NJ as they meet
first in Taipei and then in Tokyo, the clever Japanese in effect
taking the role of a guru to NJ in much the way that a
spiritual leader comforts NJ's wife after she has had a minor
breakdown.
   Despite the frequent loitering visuals and the occasional
monologue, "Yi Yi" moves smoothly along, and though we
can guess the fate of the comatose grandmother, Wang
throws in a smart twist involving NJ's business that, together
with the get-togethers and break-ups of the individuals
speaks volumes about the ways we are regularly betrayed
and seem never to learn from our miscalculations.  Dialogue
is in Mandarin, Hokkien and English with English subtitles.
