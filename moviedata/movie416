PLOT:
A human space astronaut accidentally falls upon a planet ruled by apes. He is
taken prisoner along with some other humans, and tries his best to escape his
simian captors. Oh yeah, and did I mention that the apes can talk? Kewl!
CRITIQUE:
Despite this film not looking like a "Tim Burton movie" or its lead human
character showing any signs of being a human being himself, I did find myself
generally entertained throughout most of this film and do recommend it as fun,
summer fare. Although the thing that sets this movie apart from all others is
definitely its incredible ape make-up jobs and characterizations. I mean, I was
completely convinced that every single one of these apes was for real! I also
have to "give it up" to all of the actors inside the costumes, not only for
waking up at three in the morning every day to get make-up slobbered all over
them for 2-4 hours, but for coming through their costumed exteriors and selling
us their characters on the screen as well. I especially enjoyed Bonham Carter's
performance, who I believed to be the most developed character in the entire
film (human or ape) and Tim Roth's bad guy, who chewed up scenery and oozed evil
in every scene in which he took part. Plot-wise, I liked the beginning of the
film, the whole build-up once Wahlberg got into the village, the escape and most
of the fight scenes, but once things got out into the deserted area (and the
final battle sequence), I kinda lost a bit of my interest.
I was much more intrigued by the interactions between the characters and the
whole idea of "human beings as animals" then I was about the end battle
sequence, which just seemed a bit too typical for this kind of film. I also
hated the "kid" character who just got on my nerves and didn't really care for
the way that the battle sequence was resolved (I won't ruin it here but c'mon
guys...you coulda thought of something a little more plausible than that, no?).
But the thing that held this movie back more than anything else was its lead
character, his cold demeanor and the zero chemistry that he shared with either
one of his inter-species love interests. This dude didn't seem to give a rat's
ass about anyone but himself and I ultimately didn't really care about what
happened to him either. Now I'm not sure if this was the fault of the actor or
the script, but the film suffered because of it.
Visually, the movie was also nice to look at (especially the apes!), but I
definitely expected greater coolness from Tim Burton. The "surprise ending" that
highlighted the original PLANET OF THE APES film back in 1968, felt a little
tacked on here, and despite being interesting, didn't really make all that much
sense to me (unless you look at it from a sequel point of view). So overall, I
loved the whole "feel" of the planet, the apes that ruled it, the manner in
which they treated the humans, screamed, shouted and reverted the entire
evolution chain, but didn't appreciate the film's lack of human character
development (why was Kris Kristofferson even in this movie?) and the fact that
its lead male and female humans were just plain boring. But I would still
recommend this film as a fun, summer movie with laughs, creepiness and a really
cool premise.
PS: For anyone who has seen the original, I cannot believe that they didn't AT
LEAST bring back the scene in which the lead human character (in this case, Mark
Wahlberg) goes nuts at the world in which he's suddenly been thrust ("This is a
mad house!"- type of thing). The guy in this film barely seems to be "put off"
by the fact that he's surrounded by apes who can speak English!!

In the year 2029, Captain Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg, "Boogie Nights")
is training 'his' chimp Pericles to pilot a pod from the USAF Oberon
space station.  When an electromagnetic storm is encountered and Pericles'
pod is lost, Davidson sets out unauthorized and lands thousands of years
in the future on the "Planet of the Apes."
Maybe if 20th Century Fox had set the proverbial 100 chimps in front of
typewriters they would have gotten a better results than this adaptation
of the Pierre Boulle novel by William Broyles Jr. ("Cast Away"), and 
Lawrence Konner & Mark D. Rosenthal ("Mighty Joe Young").  Director Tim 
Burton's unique look and style are nowhere to be found in this silly,
pointless remake.
Davidson no sooner lands than he finds himself being swarmed by savages
running in terror, whom he wisely joins.  However, he's rounded up with
the lot of them by the apes which rule this plant and handed over to
slave trader Limbo (Paul Giamatti, "Duets").  Ari (Helena Bonham Carter,
"Fight Club"), daughter of the illustrious Senator Sandar (David Warner,
"Titanic") and simian bleeding heart, believes humans should live with 
apes on equal standing, an unpopular notion.  She takes a liking to Leo,
who she deems 'unusual.'  General Thade (Tim Roth, "Lucky Numbers") is
of the opposite opinion, wishing for declaration of martial law that will
allow him to annihilate the race.  He's sweet on Ari.
It's relatively easy to see where this 'new' story is going from the onset,
yet its ultimate revelation has gaping logic holes.  The much ballyhooed
'surprise' ending is a nonsensical let down.  An attempt at a
love triangle, conveyed by Ari and the human Daena (Estella Warren, "Driven")
giving each other 'back off' looks over Leo, fails because he never develops
a relationship with either of them.  The lone sex scene is some hilarious
foreplay between elder Orangutan Senator Nado (Glenn Shadix) and his trophy
wife Nova (Burton's squeeze, Lisa Marie).  Guffaws will also likely greet
Charlton Heston's cameo as Thade's Father, the one ape harboring a firearm (!)
who sputters some very familiar lines before dying.
The only real success of the 2001 "Planet of the Apes" is Rick Baker's 
makeup, and even that's an iffy affair.  No attempt was made to change the
human whiteness of the actors' eyes, a real distraction amidst
some otherwise impressive work.  Roth, Warner and Michael Clarke Duncan
(as Thade's right hand man Attar) are given the most impressive makeovers.
Giamatti looks more like a skull than an ape and the female apes are too
humanized to be given sexual appeal.  Tim Roth delivers the most impressive
acting job by getting the body language right - his nasty chimpanzee
character leaps about, most spectacularly when mounting his steed, but
even's he's undone by some obvious wire work.  Bonham Carter delivers a
goodly range of emotion from behind a stiff prosthetic, but is undone in turn
by the silliness of the writing.
Most of the film has a set bound look which no amount of mist can cover.
The ape's city resembles a dank complex of tree houses.  The apes' military
costumes (Colleen Atwood, "Sleepy Hollow") as well as their field tents
are reminiscent of Eiko Ishioka's work on Coppola's "Dracula."  That
oriental flavor is also found in Danny Elfman's tribal, percussive score.
"Planet of the Apes" was the last blockbuster hope for the summer of 2001,
a dismal movie season that's going to the dogs.

Planet of the Apes is all Tim Burton style. The movie plot is pretty 
simplistic and that is good since this is a summer movie. A pilot Leo (Mark 
Wahlberg) crashes on a plane that is ruled by apes. Humans are second class 
citizens on this planet and are treated like animals. Leo runs into a group 
of humans that he befriends, one of the humans is the beautiful Daena 
(Estella Warren). Helping this group of humans is an ape named Ari (Helena 
Bonham Carter). The plot? Humans fight for their rights on this planet and 
Leo is their saviour that fell from the sky.
Yes, there is one or two plot twists to this story and a ending that 
surprised me (thought was unsatisfying), but they story is pretty thin. So 
what is there to watch in this movie?
Simply said, The Apes. The apes in the movie upstage the humans! Tim Roth 
as the vile General Thade, Michael Clarke Duncan as Attar, and Carter as 
Ari all turn in wonderful perfomances from under all that make up. The same 
can't be said about the humans. Wahlberg is a very limited actor and it 
shows here. Watch just what little reaction he has when he encounters 
talking apes. And Warren is just there as eye candy, her part is so thin 
that if she disappeared halfway through the film I doubt anyone would miss 
it. The apes though are great! Not just because of the revolutionary make 
up that they have that lets they truly emote, but because the actors that 
play the apes are top-notch. Roth's performance is only a one note 
performance, but he plays that note well. And Carter as Ari adds some 
warmth to any otherwise bland character.
Rick Baker (Men in Black) has to be given many kudos for the work he's done 
for this movie. The ape make up is perfect. The score by Danny Elfman is 
perfection also. Every detail in this film is done to perfection and that's 
what should be watched for. It's too bad that all the perfect pieces don't 
fit together all that well. And although I enjoyed the movie and liked how 
Burton threw in the surprise ending, the movie in the end is just a 
mediocre movie -- something that's to be expected from a summer movie, but 
I expected a whole lot more out of Burton.

Susan Granger's review of "PLANET OF THE APES" (20th Century-Fox)
  In Tim Burton's re-envisioning of Pierre Boulle's novel which became a
1968 cult classic, the sci-fi premise remains the same: an astronaut (Mark
Wahlberg) crash-lands on a bizarre, brutal world where apes are the dominant
species and humans serve them. When captured, he's taken to the misty mountain
kingdom of Ape City by the orangutan slave trader (Paul Giamatti). He meets
defiant human rebels (Kris Kristofferson, Estella Warren) and discovers the
socio-political conflict between the tyrannical General (Tim Roth) and his
intimidating aide (Michael Clarke Duncan) and a passionate, liberal Senator's
daughter (Helena Bonham Carter) who believes humans should not be subjugated by
simians. Tim Burton's iconoclastic vision of this fascistic,
chimpanzee-dominated society is brought to life primarily by six-time
Oscar-winning make-up artist Rick Baker ("Gorillas in the Mist," "Mighty Joe
Young") who, incredibly, in a tour-de-force, transforms the actors into apes.
Credit production designer Rick Heinrichs and cinematographer Philippe Rousselot
too. Unlike the original, in William Broyles Jr.'s rather dull screenplay, the
humans are not mute and, despite the rumors, there's no inter-species sex.
Clunky Mark Wahlberg is hardly a heroic figure, as Charlton Heston was in the
original. But Heston does turn up as an aged, ailing ape, and once again, in a
quite different context, utters his famous line: "Damn them all to hell!" But,
basically, Paul Giamatti steals the picture, offering much needed comic relief. 
The conclusion, while not the Statue of Liberty, offers a surprising, if very
contrived, twist. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Planet of the Apes" is
a dark, primal, action-packed 5, proving "The smarter we become, the more
dangerous we get."

There's a whole lotta gruntin' goin' on as actors in ape suits overact with a
vengeance in Tim Burton's remake of PLANET OF THE APES, his BATTLEFIELD EARTH. 
Both films suffer from poor character development and dopey dialog.  Although
PLANET OF THE APES is much better made -- Burton is a great visual stylist -- if
forced to sit through one of them again, I'd go for BATTLEFIELD EARTH, at least
it was campy fun.  PLANET OF THE APES is dreary and overwrought.
Delivering the film's only credible performance, Mark Wahlberg plays Capt. Leo
Davidson, a human astronaut who accidentally lands on a planet where the apes
are in command and are abusing the humans.  Leo ends up teaming with a blonde
bombshell named Daena (Estella Warren, DRIVEN), who dresses like Sheena, Queen
of the Jungle, and acts like a zombie.  Kris Kristofferson, as Daena's dad,
plays one of the script's many clichéd characters.  Although most of the apes
look and act alike, it is Tim Roth, as General Thade, who is given the key role
of the main villain.  General Thade keeps scheming toward a Hitlerian final
solution for eliminating the humans from the planet.  
The apes run around saying things like, "How many times do I have to tell you to
wear gloves when you handle humans?"  When they're not spouting their ridiculous
lines, they fight like a bunch of wild animals.
In the big battle scenes, Burton finally gets it right.  These are great moments
worthy of a master of the visual.  But most of the movie is one silly scene
after another.  The original was fun, but the remake is dreary, violent and
takes forever to get to the brief last act, the only successful part of the
remake.
The movie does contain one comedic gem.  "Be sure and get rid of them by
puberty," a slave trader admonishes an ape who is in the process of purchasing a
young human child.  "One thing you don't want in your house is a human
teenager."
PLANET OF THE APES runs 1:59.  It is rated PG-13 for some sequences of
action/violence and would be acceptable for kids around 10 or 11 and up,
depending on how well they can handle violent, frightening images.
My son Jeffrey, age 12, gave it ***.  He thought it was awesome, realistic and
funny, but he was bothered by some of the story's logic.
The film opens nationwide in the United States today, Friday, July 27, 2001.  In
the Silicon Valley, it is showing at the AMC and the Century theaters.

The ending of Tim Burton's PLANET OF THE APES is one that I like. Because I
enjoy pondering the details of almost any film I've seen, this original
divergence from Pierre Boulle's novel  as well as from the 1968 Charlton Heston
vehicle  is fascinating, if rather unpopular among many American viewers.
Although the quality of Tim Burton's films is uneven, each one of his works is
an event. Craftsmanship and vision showing in each one, Burton's movies are
steadily building him the reputation of an American master. In his dark
imaginings Burton reminds me of the writer T. C. Boyle, who began publishing his
stories and in little magazines and then progressed to putting out novels with
major publishers. Likewise, Burton paid his dues early in his career, and has
been fortunate enough to be able to impose brilliant originality on his films 
even though the movie machines of Hollywood expect many dollars in return. Don't
know about you, but I'll admit to a willingness to see a film just because
Burton's name is the last one in the opening credits.
What's cool about PLANET? Perhaps the setting is not as visually stunning as in
BATMAN, but it is just as dark. In fact, most of the piece has received the
criticism of being rather lightless. The symbolism works well, though: the dark
heart of man has engineered this chaotic hell, and man is suffering the just
deserts. The simian beings that rule the planet  and there many races of apes,
as well as many forms of racism  occupy quarters that appear comfortable.
Structures sit among huge trees and hills that must be difficult to navigate for
mere humans. No doubt the set's magic is aided through painted backdrops and
canvases sketched upon the computer.
The film really does move. Not many subplots divert our attention. When Leo
Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), in an attempt to rescue a space pod piloted by a
chimp, flies into an electromagnetic storm, he is flung far into the future.
Crashing through the forest of this seemingly alien planet, he sinks in a murky
pool, reminiscent of the creepy swamp where Luke Skywalker is mentored by Yoda.
But Davidson has no familiar faces around. The humans he spies seem somehow
subhuman. After the apes round them up, the stage is set for an escape
engineered by Davidson, the American Air Force officer who is not willing to
accept this world turned on its ear. The escape attempt takes up much of the
running time, with the band of humans accepting aid from a female ape named Ari
(Helena Bonham Carter) and exploring the forbidden desert where, according to
mythology, the ape civilization began.
Apes caging humans? The irony is delicious, and the moral is as clear as it was
in the 1968 version. How should we treat animals? What role will evolution play
in the future? When will the world finally be free of slavery? Gladly, Burton's
version presents these questions while refraining from clearly answering them.
Unfortunately, the film's agenda also includes an oblique attack upon
Christianity, specifically, the idea that a being will return to spread
salvation upon his people. It certainly seems as though this founding father is
imbued with more superhuman traits than a mere Arthurian figure.
As Davidson, Mark Wahlberg is competent but not outstanding. His goal is to get
himself off the planet, and we like him only mildly because his character is
developed too quickly. His decision to steal a pod and try to rescue the chimp
has consequences that reverberate throughout universal history: here's what
would really happen if Star Trek's Prime Directive were breached! Wahlberg is a
decent action hero, though the script perhaps could have given him more
personality.
Carter is very good as the sympathetic ape Ari. She is actually a human rights
activist who is not human! Rick Baker's makeup people have given her comparably
little facial hair, so it is easier for us to accept a slight romantic interest
between her and Davidson. Bonham Carter's performance proves again that a good
actor can shine through the heaviest disguise.
The strongest acting is turned in by the baddie. If I might continue the
comparison to STAR WARS, what Darth Vader is to Luke, General Thade (Tim Roth)
is to Davidson. The perfect rival and foil  a simian Machiavelli. Roth must
relish the role of a "heavy," as he grows delirious with all-too-human hatred
and vengeance in PLANET. Along with Gary Oldman, Tim Roth is setting the
standards for villains in the modern cinema.
Paul Giamatti is buried under the guise of a slave-trading orangutan, but his
performance is solid. He's very funny; part of the irony here is the
personification that shines through this supposedly non-person. What a strong
character actor Giamatti is.
Estella Warren as Daena, the comely human woman who is part of the escaping
band, is underused. In this area the script is unsure what to do. Should
Davidson grow more attached to Daena or to Ari? We can't decide either. Michael
Clarke Duncan is barely recognizable as General Thane's protégé, General Attar.
This mammoth actor again turns in a rather quiet but solid job, though Attar's
character seems occasionally conflicted. Finally, Kris Kristofferson is vastly
underused. His craggy face just begins to add a rounder dimension to the plight
of the humans on this terrifying planet, when he is plucked from the story.
In a wise and witty appearance, Charlton Heston wears the ape latex in this
revisiting. He's Thade's father, whose dying words reveal some of the mysterious
history behind the race reversal. Look for some clever references in this
sequence.
In a season that is rather bare of well-made films, PLANET OF THE APES is
competent if not spectacular. It's full of action and engaging special effects,
and the appearance of the apes is, probably for the first time, believable,
thanks to Mr. Baker and his crew. What makes the film better than average is the
risks taken by Burton, especially with that heady ending.

Planet of the Apes (2001) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Mark Wahlberg, Tim
Roth, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan, Paul Giamatti, Estella
Warren, Kris Kristofferson, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, David Warner and Charlton
Heston. Screenplay by William Broyles Jr. and Lawrence Konner & Mark Rosenthal.
Based on the novel by Pierre Boulle. Music by Danny Elfman. Directed by Tim
Burton.  Rated PG-13. Approx. 2 hours 
I have to say it. Tim Burton's retelling of Planet of the Apes is more fun than
a barrel of monkeys. 
OK, that's off my chest. No more monkey puns, I promise. 
Seriously, though, Planet of the Apes is one rip-roarin' summer outing, filled
with thrills, action, adventure, wit and bits of funny (dare I say, monkey)
business. I know, I know, I promised. 
And for those film buffs who are fond of the original, Burton's version includes
a couple tips of the hat to that movie. 
Mark Wahlberg stars as Capt. Leo Davidson, a deep-space pilot whose ship gets
drawn into a magnetic field and hurled into the future. He crash lands on a
planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are hunted, captured and
sold into slavery. 
Despite being darker than the original, Burton's film is not as heavy handed nor
as sanctimonious. 
Some of the movie's flashes of humor are surreal as well as typically Burton: An
organ-grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig and removing
false teeth as he prepares for bed. Then there are the parents who buy a little
girl as a pet for there young daughter. The seller advises the parents to get
rid of the girl before she reaches puberty: "One thing you don't want in your
house is a human teen-ager," he says. You don't have to be an ape to realize the
truth in that statement. Touches such as these are what stamps this movie with
Burton's brand. 
Lines that hearken back to the original movie are sprinkled throughout: The
first words spoken by an ape to Davidson as the astronaut is regaining
consciousness and grabs the simian's foot to try righting himself are: "Take
your stinking hand off of me, you damned, dirty human." Anyone familiar with the
first version of the film will, of course, recognize the irony in that piece of
dialogue. 
Another of Burton's in-jokes is to have Charlton Heston, star of the original,
play the chimpanzee father of Tim Roth's Gen. Thade. The young chimp goes to
visit his dying father. Both have one thing in common, a hatred of humans. With
his dying breath, the elder spews out his vile: "Damn them, damn them all to
hell," he says before expiring. That is the famous line Heston's Taylor shouted
at the conclusion of the original after discovering the planet's terrible
secret. 
The performances throughout are top-notch. Wahlberg plays Davidson not as some
gung-ho hero, but as a confused and somewhat frightened explorer who only wants
to return home. He is reluctant to lead the human rebellion; his only objective
being to find a way off this upside-down planet. This hesitation is what makes
his character believable and vulnerable. 
Roth is ferocious, cunning, cruel and savage as the fascist chimp who wants to
rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity. He leaps and bounds as if he had
springs on his feet. It is a masterful turn. 
Helena Bonham Carter is Ari, the chimp who believes that apes and humans can
live in peace and as equals. Hers is a smart, compassionate characterization. 
Michael Clarke Duncan is big and brutal as Attar the gorilla aid to Thade who
blindly follows his leader until his faith is shaken. 
A fine comic outing is given by Paul Giamatti as Limbo, the ape slave trader
making a living off the misery of the humans he captures. As the battle between
apes and humans looms, the cowardly Limbo pleads, "Can't we all just get along,"
echoing the words of Rodney King. 
Much of the success of Planet of the Apes goes to Burton's technical crew,
especially production designer Rick Heinrichs and the legendary Rick Baker who
created the ape makeup. 
Burton's musical collaborator, Danny Elfman, provides another fine score, though
it is not as memorable as his work on Batman or Sleepy Hollow. 
The movie's only letdown comes at the very end where Burton tries to outshock
the finale from the 1968 original. He comes close, but falls short. 
Otherwise, Planet of the Apes is what a summer movie should be: An amusement
park ride filled with lots of action, stunts and a few laughs. This is one
feature in which the expectations lived up to the pre-release hype.

Tim Burton has now completed his evolution from the brilliant director
of macabre stories about outcast individuals yearning for acceptance,
and into a studio monkey whose name is used as part of multi-tiered
marketing materials for crap movies.  And here he hits rock bottom, with
Planet of the Apes.
I didn't expect much from this latest "interpretation" of Pierre
Boulle's classic novel Planet of the Apes.  I mean, how could you top
the force and impact of the original film, intelligently co-scripted by
Rod Serling (of Twilight Zone fame) combined with the overbearing Chuck
Heston growling and yelling at those "damn dirty apes," in one of his
best roles of his career?  Sadly, I sat down to watch Burton's version
of Planet of the Apes and within the first 20 minutes, I was checking my
watch and my girlfriend (a big fan of the original film) started to nod
off.
This time around, the story plays out like a cross between Enemy Mine,
Braveheart, and Project X.  Marky Mark Wahlberg, who was enjoyable in
Boogie Nights and The Corrupter, plays Leo Davidson, a hot shot U.S. Air
Force pilot.  Leo and his crew are in search of some mysterious magnetic
storms (no real explanation given in the film) and Leo sends one of his
genetically altered "smart" chimps into the storms to collect data.  Leo
and his crew lose communication with the chimp, Leo hops in another ship
to find the monkey, and then he's thrown through some type of time-space
wormhole which crashes lands on the Twentieth Century Fox studio
backlot, all mocked up to look like the Amazon jungle.
Leo ends up getting captured by a group of talking apes and is sold to a
slave trader named Limbo (Paul Giamatti) who in turn sells Leo to a
chimpanzee named Ari (Helena Bonham Carter).  The kind Ari then helps
Leo and his fellow humans escape to the mountains to find Leo's ship. 
Along the way, monkeys played by Tim Roth (overacting his role of a
vicious general named Thade) and Michael Clarke Duncan (who further
enhances his career by playing another heavy in a bad action movie)
strive out to hunt down Leo and his band of human savages, just like
Battlefield Earth!  In the end, it all culminates into another
Braveheart rip-off human versus ape battle scene.
While Rick Baker's makeup work is amazing, the script is a pathetic
hodgepodge (courtesy of three writers), the acting is horrible, and the
"surprise" ending feels like a swing from a ball-peen hammer into the
temple.  Wahlberg does not have the physical or mental presence of a
Chuck Heston to carry the film or any of its action sequences.  
This remake, or re-interpretation, as Tim Burton has proclaimed it, is
an insult to the intelligence and wit of the original film.  The ethical
arguments about the equality of species, fascism, and military buildup
have been replaced by tremendous amounts of ridiculous dialogue, an
unimaginative narrative structure, and a romance  between a monkey and a
human. Even Chuck Heston's anti-gun tirade (in the de rigeur cameo)
seems shallow and jokey.
But the main element missing from this Tim Burton Film is Tim Burton. 
Even though his name is plastered across every billboard in America,
John Badham could have directed this film.  Even Joel Schumacher could
have directed this film.  He probably should have.  Burton's predominant
themes of rejection, isolation, and the search for one's place in the
universe, as seen in Ed Wood, Edward Scissorshands, and Pee-Wee's Big
Adventure, are completely absent in this Planet.  I suppose that's what
happen when a great director gets sucked through a wormhole.

Directed by Tim Burton. Screenplay by William Broyles Jr, Lawrence Konner,
and Mark D Rosenthal, based on the novel by Pierre Boulle. Starring Mark
Wahlberg, Helena Bonham Carter, Tim Roth. Running time: 121 minutes. Rated
PG for frightening scenes by the MFCB. Reviewed on August 15th, 2001.
Synopsis: In the near future, astronaut Leo Davidson (Wahlberg) is lost in 
an electrical storm in space, and crash lands on a planet where apes are 
the dominant lifeform. Davidson comes to believe that they key to his 
escape lies in the remote Forbidden Zone. Allying himself with a ragtag 
band of humans, as well as human-friendly ape Ari (Bonham Carter), 
Davidson tries to reach the Forbidden Zone while being pursued by the 
malevolent ape leader Thade (Roth).
Review: Tim Burton is well-known for lending his films a distinct visual 
flair; in concert with a good script, this often produces a genuinely 
memorable moviegoing experience (such as 1999's "Sleepy Hollow"). Sadly, 
Burton's "re-visioning" of "Planet Of The Apes" is long on appearances but 
short on anything else. This is little more than a by-the-numbers action 
flick with an inordinate amount of money thrown at it. "Apes" is wonderful 
to look at; as good as the make-up was in the original, Burton's team has 
done an even more spectacular job in bringing the title creatures to life 
for the modern version. And there is much promise in an exciting early 
scene in which Wahlberg is captured by apes employing tactics that feel 
genuinely simian. But afterward, the picture degenerates into a standard 
chase story; there's even an annoying kid sidekick to complicate matters. 
The revelations which occur in the Forbidden Zone are likely to surprise 
very few, and a literal deus ex machina strains the bounds of coincidence 
much too far. Burton's biggest problem, though, is that he creates few 
characters of interest: Wahlberg is bland and unengaging, the villains are 
stereotypes, the other humans mere ciphers. Even Bonham Carter's unusual 
(and sometimes disconcerting) Ari simply services the plot. A pointless, 
tacked-on twist ending cements the banality of the whole exercise.

Because the press screening of "Planet of the Apes" was one day past
last issue's deadline, I was afforded the opportunity to see the film a
second time, listen to audience reactions and read a heap of reviews
before writing this piece. The chief complaints of those who disliked
the futuristic adventure appear to be that the movie focused on visuals
instead of substance, that the story was thin, that Mark Wahlberg's
character was colorless and that the surprise ending sucked.
To those people I would like to say  What the hell did you expect?
This is a Tim Burton movie, boys and girls. Tim Burton movies have great
art direction and thin, clunky stories. For the blissfully nasty,
disjointed and underrated "Mars Attacks!" (Jonathan Rosenbaum of the
Chicago Reader and I were two of the only critics in America to praise
the movie) Burton reportedly tossed vintage "Mars Attacks!" trading
cards onto the floor and based his story on the ones that landed face
up.
Burton's re-imagining of the 1968 story of an astronaut that lands on a
planet where apes rule men looks great. The apes, courtesy of make-up
magician Rick Baker, are dazzling and Ape City is a wonder to behold.
Like astronaut Leo Davidson (Wahlberg), the film hits the ground
running, whisking viewers through a head-spinning series of solid
one-liners and engaging vignettes and establishing a sense of thrust
that carries us through the more traditional fight scenes that come
later.
As for Wahlberg, consider what Burton does with his character. From his
start as a filmmaker, Burton has shown his fascination with colorful
misfits (Pee-Wee Herman, The Joker, Ed Wood, the ack-acking Martians,
etc.) and lack of interest in standard issue heroes. So Leo Davidson
spends most of the movie getting the living shit kicked out of him
before the biggest guilt trip in history is dropped on his shoulders. As
for lack of color, remember, Leo only launches into space to get his
monkey back. He doesn't want to lead humanity and he isn't looking for
romance from a pretty, but dull human (Estella Warren) or a dynamic ape
(Helena Bonham Carter, terrific as an equal-rights activist). As a man
who just wants out, Wahlberg is focused, subtle and sly.
The surprise ending provides the requisite shock (and some more dandy
visuals, particularly of the approaching authority figures), but
admittedly isn't nearly as satisfying as the one in the original. For
the original ending to work, we only had to make one simple connection,
for this one, we have to write a whole new screenplay.
The 1968 "Apes" boasted a handful of great scenes, cool looking monkeys,
a deliciously hammy performance by Charlton Heston (who appears
uncredited here as an aged chimp on his deathbed, re-delivering a
classic line) and a killer ending. But viewers had to suffer through
numerous dull stretches punctuated by social and political messages
delivered with the grace of a wrecking ball. The 2001 "Planet of the
Apes" offers a different set of great scenes, much cooler looking
monkeys, fine acting from Wahlberg, Bonham Carter, Paul Giamatti and Tim
Roth, and a not so good ending. It also gives us another chance to
experience the skewed vision of Tim Burton and that's nothing to
complain about.

    CAPSULE: The much anticipated re-adaptation of the Pierre
    Boulle novel comes to the screen as  a dark and a little
    dreary film with lots of chases and fighting, but very little
    intelligence.  Visually  there is much to like about this
    version, but the approach is to take an adventure after the
    style of  GULLIVER'S TRAVELS and treat it as an action film.
    That makes it a film without much center.   Rating: 4
    (0 to 10), 0 (-4 to +4)
Pierre Boulle, author of THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, wrote
PLANET OF THE APES  (a.k.a. MONKEY PLANET), the novel, as a
social satire.  It reads a lot like a fifth book of  GULLIVER'S
TRAVELS.  Humans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and
humans have  been reversed, not unlike the roles of horses and
humans on Jonathan Swift's island of the  Houyhnhnms.  The novel
moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all
the  things most film fans know to be true about the nature of
the planet.  It seems to me there is also a  statement about
human cruelty to animals, but perhaps I was just looking for
that.
When Rod Serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968,
he added a number of Serling  touches, familiar from episodes of
THE TWILIGHT ZONE and changed the ending to make it  more
Serling-ish.  The final irony of the original version has become
film history.  Without it there  could never have been a "Planet
of the Apes" film series.  I can surmise only that Serling ran
into  serious script problems in how to handle the tricky
question of language.  In the book the apes had  their own
language and the human eventually learned that language.  That
could have been done in  the film, but that would have required
the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking.
Serling avoided this by having the apes speak English and, of
course, there is some justification  for that by the end of the
film.  Justifying why the apes spoke English may have even been
the  inspiration for his surprise ending.  But Serling never
tackles the all-important question of why a  supposedly
intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that
the apes speak his  own language, a language they had no
opportunity to ever hear.  Few viewers questioned this  serious
plot hole, however, and the film has become well respected in
cinema history.  Partial  credit at least should go to Jerry
Goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of Goldsmith's
best if not his best.
When the film's success called for sequels, the filmmakers turned
up the violence and they added  well-intentioned, though not very
subtle, political messages about what was happening in the
United States of the 1960s and 1970s.  While the first film had a
little shooting of guns and what  was there seemed a little half-
hearted, by the second film, BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE  APES,
there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the
series had a lot of violence  and chases.  The series concluded
with BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES in 1973.   Now director
Tim Burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again.
For those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful
to the book, Burton's new  version is even less faithful.  First,
he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes.
He has them both be intelligent, articulate races battling for a
dominance of the planet currently in  the hands, uh, make that
paws, of the apes.  That could be a good story too, but it is not
PLANET  OF THE APES.  As with the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE films and so
many other cinematic  homages to the third quarter of the last
century, the title makes promises that the filmmakers have  no
intention of honoring.
In 2029 Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg, not this world's most
expressive actor) works on a space  station increasing the
intelligence and usefulness of apes.  Then a convenient time
storm sweeps  him up WIZARD-OF-OZ-fashion and drops him on an
alien planet.  (Yes, he survives this storm,  but then no storm
is perfect.)  He quickly finds, not greatly to any surprise he
shows, that on this  planet apes rule and humans drool, but
everybody talks.  And the language they talk is Earth- English.
Apparently it does not even occur to Leo that there is a mystery
that needs to be  explained about that.  The fact it does not
occur to Leo and apparently didn't occur to Tim Burton  either is
the heart of the real horror of this film.  Both just assumed
that if apes were going to talk  the language they would speak
would be English.  In any case having one talking race dominating
another makes this not a look at human-animal relationships and
more one of the master-slave  relationships.  Outside of Sudan
and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic.
Leo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by
Ari, played by Helena Bonham  Carter.  Ari is an attractive ape
with close ties to high political power.  She is bent on making
the  world a better place.  Perhaps in a previous draft of the
script she was called Hil-Ari.  In any case  with makeup that
stifles her usual pout, Carter is just about as attractive as she
has ever been in a  film.  She may want to consider this to
become her standard look from this point forward.
It is not long before Leo escapes with some human and only a
couple of sympathetic apes.  This is  a further abandonment of
the source material.  The chase severely limits the interplay of
ape and  human and the examination of each's place in this
reversed society, each important in the book.   We cannot see how
the society works because most of the screentime society has
broken down.   We see the humans either separated from the apes
or fighting them.  Burton chooses visceral  thrills over cerebral
ones at almost every turn.  This is a miscalculation, as
characters so lacking in  empathy value are difficult ones to
place much emotional investment in.  They are basically chess
pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win.
The 1968 script had little subtlety,  with lines like "I never
met an ape I didn't like," but at least we cared for what
happened to Taylor,  the main character.  Most of what this film
has to offer is in the visuals.
The visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that
so much of the film takes place in  the night or in fog.  This
tends to limit close looks at the makeup.  In general it seems
much  improved from 1968.  The makeup team is led by Rick Baker
instead of John Chambers, who did  it for the 1968 version. In
1968 Chambers makeup was a jaw-dropper. It was realistic enough
to  almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion.
Chambers is good, but if anyone had a  chance to best him it
would have to be Baker.  Today audiences have higher
expectations; Baker's  visualization is really an improvement.
These visuals work nicely.  What does not work is the  wire-
assisted leaps some of the apes make.  They look like they were
inspired by the physics- defying leaps of CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN
DRAGON.  Apes spring incredible distances.   Some of the best
scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape
posture, but when  they start flying through the air the effect
is lost.  One final visual problem is that the film  frequently
shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the
camera shows us only  a small group of people close-up.
Since the days of Lon Chaney and Boris Karloff few actors have
crossed over to stardom in a role  that required heavy make-up.
The one actor who has a shot is Paul Giamatti.  It is not that
his  lines are so good, most are silly jokes.  But he delivers
them very well.  He was always a  watchable actor, but has not
yet made stardom.  As the ape-trader Limbo he over-emotes to
overcome his ape make-up, but does it very well.  In doing so he
makes himself the most  interesting thing on the screen.  He is
probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories  of
Peter Ustinov's performance in SPARTACUS.
As an in-joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from
the 1968 film and an old ape  played by Charleton Heston becomes
an allusion to the first film by itself.  Danny Elfman's score
has a nice primitive feel, but Jerry Goldsmith's 1968 tour de
force score is a real classic. That  score and the whole film
will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten.  I rate the
remake 4  on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.

As cheesy as the original Planet of the Apes film is, it sets a pretty high
cinematic bar.  It'd be easy to outdo the special effects and best the
acting, but tackling the infamous Statue of Liberty ending is an entirely
different story.  Duplicating or removing it would be a cop-out, and
changing it virtually guarantees the new version won't be any good (it'd be
like making Rosebud a woman in a Citizen Kane remake).
While the new ending is a little clunky (and a lot predictable), director
Tim Burton does, for the most part, a pretty decent job with his
"revisitation" of Apes.  It's probably the most un-Burton-esque film he has
made, relying more on special effects, makeup and costume than his typically
stunning visual presentation.  Apes is a rare remake that is shorter than
its predecessor, and one that doesn't cast actors from the
original...because most of them are dead (aside from Charlton Heston, who is
dead only between his ears, and makes a brief appearance here).  There are
enough differences to make this film unique (for better or for worse), but
it's also similar enough to avoid sending diehard Ape fans into nerd comas.
Apes opens in 2029 inside a research station just outside Saturn.  Mark
Wahlberg (The Perfect Storm) plays Leo Davidson, a pilot chomping at the bit
to fly into an electrical storm (didn't Wahlberg learn to stay away from
storms last summer?), but a space chimp is tapped to make the journey before
any human lives are risked.  When the monkey's pod disappears, Leo takes off
after it, despite the orders to stop from his commanding officer.  Sure
enough, Leo's pod vanishes into a Contact-like wormhole that spits him out
several hundred years later as he crashes into a strange planet ruled by
apes.
Like the first film, there are humans on the planet, but they can talk and
have more interaction with their monkey overlords, who act a lot more simian
than they did in the original.  Some humans are slaves, some are kept as
pets and some have even been molded into butlers, but the apes are firmly in
control of things despite their apparent lack of ability to invent stuff
beyond rudimentary weapons and armor.  There are no guns, no doctors and
generally no knowledge of what lies over the mountain in The Forbidden Zone.
While Wahlberg's Leo is clearly crafted in the same mold as Charlton
Heston's Colonel Taylor, the only ape character that makes the evolutionary
leap from 1968 to 2001 is Ari, played by Fight Club's Helena Bonham Carter
(her ancestor was Dr. Zira, which is almost Ari spelled backward).  Ari, the
rebellious daughter of a senator and the ex-lover of the evil General Thade
(Tim Roth, Lucky Numbers), leads the Human Rights Faction and, for some
reason, develops an instant bond with Leo.
With a few exceptions, the second act follows the original film pretty
closely and finds Leo, his hot human squeeze (Estella Warren, Driven), Ari
and a handful of others trying to make it into The Forbidden Zone while
being chased by the gorilla army (led by Michael Clarke Duncan, See Spot
Run). But as things degenerate into Braveheart (Apeheart?) or, worse yet,
The 13th Warrior, it becomes clear this film is working its way to a more
upbeat resolution, which kind of blows, and, coming from Burton, is just
plain disappointing.  Yeah, there's a twist, but you can see it coming from
a mile away (assuming you know how the first film ended).
One major improvement in the film is the appearance of the apes.  Rick
Baker's (Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas) creatures look amazing
and can show much more emotion in their faces.  But nearly all of the apes
sound like a bunch of people with fake teeth awkwardly jammed into their
mouths (which is what they all are, but still).  Another minor effects
complaint is the over-the-top jumping skills of the chimps.  I can overlook
the fact that it's preposterous, but the editing of these scenes leaves a
little to be desired.  You never once see a clean landing, instead getting a
jumpy edit. It's like throwing a dummy off a cliff and then having an actor
pop into the shot from the bottom.
Apes, based on Pierre Boulle's novel, only scratches the surface of the
complex racial issues and battles over religion versus science that made the
first film such a treat.  The screenplay, from William Broyles, Jr. (Cast
Away), Lawrence Konner and Mark D. Rosenthal (Mighty Joe Young), does riff
on a few of the original's more popular lines, and includes more children
and teenage characters, both ape and human.  What's more amazing is the
inclusion of a swimming scene for Warren, who got to breaststroke in Driven,
too (she used to be a synchronized swimmer).
Maybe it's because half of the actors were buried under latex (or because
there's no Johnny Depp), but Apes seems like Burton's least actor-driven
film.  There's no weird cross-species chemistry between Wahlberg and Bonham
Carter, but there isn't any between him and Warren, either.  Roth sounds
nothing like himself but becomes a wonderful snarling antagonist.  If chimps
had moustaches, he'd be twirling his.  Danny Elfman's (Proof of Life) score
reaches its peak during the opening credits, never factors into the rest of
the film, and never equals the unmistakable power of Jerry Goldsmith's
original.
1:47 - PG-13 for some sequences of action/violence

   George Bernard Shaw, a lifelong vegetarian, once said that
when he died he would be greeted enthusiastically in heaven by
100 cows, sheep, goats and pigs.  That's good news for Shaw--we
hope that in 1950 when he expired at the age of 94 he found the
reception he predicted.  But it's bad news for the 98% of us that
are carnivores.  Tim Burton now shows us  what it must be like to
be a human being, having enjoyed steak and bacon, zoos and
caged pets, when finally the tables are turned.  This time the
apes, who considered themselves victimized and oppressed by
the human race which had hunted and caged them for a time,
turn the tables.  The tyrannized becomes the subjugators
themselves, treating homo sapiens as inferior forms of life on the
titled planet that they rule.  I suppose you could see "Planet of the
Apes," yet another of the sequels spawned from Franklin J.
Schaffner's classic 1968 movie, as an animal rights advocate's wet 
dream, but such an interpretation would be reductionist, though valid. 
The current version taken loosely from Pierre Boulle's novel with a
screenplay by William Broyles Jr., Lawrence Konner and Mark
Rosenthal, is at once a sci-fi drama with no small amount of action
and adventure and a misanthropic view of world history.  Revolutions
come and go.  The victims become the victimizers, then the
victimizers are defeated and once again either killed,
enslaved or humiliated.  In the Twentieth Century we've seen
revolutionists by Communists and fascists, fundamentalists and
secular governments, all promising freedom and equality of
opportunity for all.  But extremism breeds reaction and so the
cynical cycle of history continues.
   If you're looking for symbolism, you'll get some, but nothing of
the depth of the 1968 version, a visual delight thanks to John
Chambers's make-up department whose costumed actors would
pass muster even by today's special-effects and costume
standards.  Schaffner's innovative film was clearer in its allegorical
implications, taking on both race and class as he displayed the
orangutans at the top of the heap as administrators, the gorillas
as soldiers and the chimps as doctors.  The divisions are caught
vaguely this time around, mostly through dialogue rather than
display, as one of the ruling apes, perturbed that a human being
calls him a monkey, corrects him violently by stating that monkeys
are at the bottom of the status heap just a little higher than
humans.
   The drama takes off as astronaut Leo Davidson (Mark
Wahlberg), disturbed that his favorite and highly trained chimp is
in trouble in space, pushes off in his space pod on an unauthorized
flight to recover his pal.  He runs into an electo-magnetic storm
that pushes him from the year 2029 to a future time, his pod
taking a hard landing on a planet unknown to him.    He soon
discovers that the apes are in charge and humans are enslaved,
some people doing the favored indoor work (house slaves--does
that sound allegorical enough?) and others putting in hard labor. 
He gets together a family of his own species, including the human
leader Karubi (Kris Kristofferson), Karubi's nubile daughter Daena
(Estella Warren), and convinces one female chimp who is
politically on the left, Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) to join the
humans.  If Ari is the peacenik of the group, her diametrical
opposite would be the fascist-like defense minister, Thade (Tim
Roth), as villainous as "Sexy Beast"'s psychotic Don Logan and quite
a bit hairier.  As the rebellion picks up steam, Thade is granted
plenary power by the planet's senate, determined to capture all
the mutinous humans and to treat leader Leo with extreme
prejudice.
   "Planet of the Apes" is not without entertainment value, a
pleasant enough way to kill some time in the theater's air-
conditioned auditorium surveying the desolate and almost bare
scenery (especially that provided by Estella Warren).  But--to coin
a critics' cliche--oh, it could have been so much more.  After all
didn't Tim Burton promise to deliver not a remake but a rethinking
of the simian series?  Think back to Mr. Burton's surprising box
office hit, "Pee-wee's Big Adventure," meant for the little ones but
considered by many to stand out for its visual inventiveness and
originality of concept.  Recall  Burton's "Beetlejuice" and
"Batman," the former unfolding some dazzling special effects with
Michael Keaton's pulling out the stops, the latter, hitting the
screens just one year later, a sizzling adaptation of Bob Kane's
comic book.  Nor is there much of the imagination Burton evoked
in his "Edward Scissorhands," featuring a man-made boy whose
creator had died before attaching palms to the lad's arms.  
   Instead of psycho-villains like the one played by Jack Nicholson
in "Batman" or quirky characters like Johnny Depp's in
"Scissorhands," we get a Tim Roth who is wholly bereft of the kind
of wit that villains are wont to have and Mark Wahlberg, a 30-year-
old fellow who is all too earnest, humorless and generic.  What
passes for the kind of repartee that allows adults to enjoy the stuff
they take the kids to, we get a leaden take-off on Barry
Goldwater's statement that extremism in defense of liberty is no
vice, while the only allusion made to current politics (it's a stretch)
would be a display of what President Bush's missile shield could
do if it worked.
  In one scene, the wide-eyed Daena plans a big kiss on Leo,
asking him to return to the planet real soon.  Maybe he will, but in
a surprisingly adept final scene, we're sure that he's going to have
his hands full.  
   The film has inevitably generated some discussion of its alleged
allegorical import.   Critics together with a segment of the general
audience have already challenged the film on a racial basis (check
the OFCS.ORG website for a growing number of messages about
this aspect).  Says one OFCS member "there's something very
striking about the dichotomy between a bunch of very dark-looking
apes and very white-looking humans....with the exception of the
'token black guy'...all of the human are white...."Apes"...deals with
issues of race, especially a predominant white fear; black
dominance of society....it's not something everyone is going to
think about, but it's still there."  Unlike the old "Apes" film in which
apes are shown have technology and science, the new one in that
critic's view shows the simians as "a bunch of primitive,
self-destructive, drug-addled bush beaters...during showing of the
film when Mark kisses Helena...boils down to the taboo of
inter-race relationships, and the film encourages prejudice instead
of confronting it by using the idea as titillation....The most
disturbing image of all  near the end of the film [is of] the primitive,
unevolved chimp happily crawling back into his prison cell."

On a distant planet, perhaps in another galaxy or in
another dimension, apes have remarkably evolved to a
superior state while Homo sapiens, oddly, are the
animals.  The human race has become a scourge.  They
are caged, prodded, displayed for amusement, and sold
into slavery.  Some are even kept as pets.  At first,
this film seems to project itself as biting satire 
an ironic piece of social commentary about our own
arrogant sense of aggrandizement.  But the film's
initial edginess considerably dulls as these notions
fade and "Apes" devolves into an unremarkable story
about a lost space traveler trying to return home.
The 20-minutes-too-long opening introduces us to
Captain Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), a pilot working on a
research space station.  While on a search and rescue
mission, he is blindsided by one of those Star
Trek-like swirling spatial anomalies.  Hurled through
time and space, he eventually crash lands on a strange
planet.  
Looking like a contestant on "Survivor 4," without
benefit of supplies or technology, he comes across a
band of humans, dressed in post-apocalyptic fashion. 
They are running for their lives, pursued by apes. 
But these aren't the simians that Davidson remembers
back on Earth.  These species seem to be eons ahead on
the evolutionary scale.  They speak, have superhuman
strength, and are as nimble as Jackie Chan. 
Eventually captured, he meets militant extremist
General Thade (Tim Roth), who considers the human
population an infestation and wants to eradicate the
whole species.   However, Ari (Helena Bonham Carter),
a civil-minded daughter of a powerful Senator, keeps
his genocidal plans in check.  But her influence can
only go so far.  And when Thade becomes convinced of
Davidson's threat to the ape-world's balance of
nature, he calls up his army whilst Ari and Davidson
flee into the hinterlands.
Much of the film focuses on their journey to a
destination where they believe they can find help
while Thade and his military troops give pursuit.  But
their travels provide too few exciting or tense
moments.  Meanwhile, Mark Wahlberg lacked the
leading-man charisma, unable to inspire his ragtag
band of followers.  With this kind of leadership, only
the hand of God could prevent a complete slaughter. 
The Ape characters seemed more, wellhuman. 
Roth-as-Thade is gloriously malicious as the fascist
leader.  Carter-as-Ari turns in a compassionate
performance as the sympathetic aristocrat.  Also of
note is Michael Clarke Duncan who lends an air of
nobility as Thade's trusted friend.  And likeable was
an orangutan slave trader (Paul Giametti) whose witty
banter and sour disposition made him seem like a
distant cousin to Jim Carrey's "Grinch."
The realism of these apes is incredible as advanced
make-up techniques give these creatures an uncannily
human look.  Yet they still maintain such apish traits
as sniffing, roaring, beating their chests, swinging,
and walking with that distinctive simian gait.  Their
world is all the more imposing thanks to director Tim
Burton's dark and gloomy otherworldly visualizations. 
  Meanwhile, maestro Danny Elfman (who did "Batman")
composes a soundtrack filled with ominous sounding
passages and gothic/military anthems.
"Apes" gets an opposable "thumbs up" for visuals,
presentation, and for its overall imaginative look and
feel.  However, it gets an opposable "thumbs down" for
a bland story, a lackluster drama, and its absurd
resolution.  While competent and handsome looking, it
needed greater profundity, zip, and intensity.  As it
stands, there's no reason to go ape.

Reading a review of Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes by
an internet critic I respect, I stumble upon this
quote: "So, a "reimagining," as Burton has been
calling it, of Planet of the Apes would surely be ripe
for Burton's brand of psychological autopsy. A human
man, alone among hostile, intelligent apes, unable to
relate to the uncivilized, subjugated homo sapiens he
encounters... Bring on the angst, the hero's twisted
self-torture, all the stuff that makes you wonder what
happened to the director as a child!"* The reviewer
then expressed her disappointment that the film was in
fact nothing like she expected, that Burton strayed
from his usual cathartic misfit tale, as riveting as
his best ones have been. The fact that her sentiment
was echoed in reviews around the country shows how
unfair the critical faculty has been to this gem of a
sci-fi movie. From Burton, everyone expected a movie
that is extraordinary in spirit; this one is simply
extraordinary in craft. It had to happen sometime, and
I don't think I mind.
Mark Wahlberg takes over Charlton Heston's role in the
original 60's Apes, but not his loincloth. He plays
Captain Leo Davidson, a scientist/astronaut who takes
a shuttle from his space station to go after an
escaped chimpanzee and gets caught in an electrical
storm that rockets him two hundred years into the
future. He crash-lands on a planet where -- you
guessed it -- apes rule and humans are caged and
enslaved.
The biggest difference between this set-up and that of
the original movie is that while the apes Heston had
to contend with were merely skeptical and
condescending, treating humans much like we treat
monkeys, the simians here are downright malevolent.
Tim Roth, cast somewhat against type, plays Thade, the
cruel, fearsome, rotten-to-the-core villain who
ridicules the human rights movement led by Ari (Helena
Bonham Carter). When Leo is captured and imprisoned,
Ari helps him escape the clutches of the corrupt slave
trader Limbo (Paul Giamatti) and lead a group of
humans to his crashed ship, showing them that humans
weren't always the subservient species.
Much has been made of the ending. I won't go into it
except to say that it isn't entirely "Burton's new
ending." It's truer to Pierre Boulle's novel than the
original movie was, though even here it's slightly
modified. But in all the hubbub about its plausibility
-- or lack thereof -- something has been lost, and
that is Burton's pure technical skill in staging an
action movie. He is as comfortable operating in this
alien world as he was in the dank, foggy woods of
Sleepy Hollow. His Apes is, in fact,
remarkable-looking, though many were put off by the
fact that it's not his trademark look. Why not let the
guy do something different?
Wahlberg makes for a good no-nonsense hero, and the
love triangle between him, Ari and a sexy human female
is, until the very end, only implied, sparing us a
potentially laughable subplot. The make-up effects by
the legendary Rick Baker are amazing, making the
original look even sillier by comparison. And Burton
keeps the movie skipping along at a nice pace,
stopping only to give us a look at Roth snarling
ferociously at the camera (and to give Heston a nifty
cameo).
This is as solid a summer movie as one can expect,
beautifully mounted, well-acted and with a nifty
shocker of an ending. More importantly, despite the
detractors' loud grumblings, this is a Tim Burton
film.

One of the most visionary filmmakers working today is, unquestionably, Tim 
Burton. Interested in telling strange and unusual tales with a grand helping 
of imagination and wonder to spare, Burton is a groundbreaking director whose 
stamp seems to be all over his films, from 1985's "Pee Wee's Big Adventure," 
to 1988's "Beetlejuice," to 1989's "Batman," to 1990's "Edward Scissorhands," 
to 1996's "Mars Attacks!," to 1999's "Sleepy Hollow." In each of his movies, 
he is equipped with startlingly innovative production designs and haunting 
music scores from Burton regular Danny Elfman. In a nutshell, when one goes 
to see "A Tim Burton Film," one is sure to walk out having seen something 
they have never seen before. 
That being said, "Planet of the Apes," a re-imagining of the cult 1968 hit 
that spawned four sequels, is the most uneven motion picture Tim Burton has 
ever had the misfortune of directing. In fact, it doesn't particularly even 
seem like something that should go on his filmography next to everything else 
he has been involved with. Elfman's signature excellent score is still here, 
to be sure, but the movie is nearly devoid of inventive thought or human 
connection (whether it involve actual homosapiens or apes). Although nowhere 
near as badly handled or haphazardly constructed, "Planet of the Apes" 
remains Tim Burton's version of "Battlefield Earth." 
Set in 2029, astronaut Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) crash-lands his 
one-person space pod on an unidentified planet where apes are the superior 
life form over human beings, who are treated as slaves and animals. 
Immediately captured by General Thade (Tim Roth) and his gang of human-hating 
apes, Leo manages to promptly escape, along with a few of the other captured 
people, including the beautiful Daena (Estella Warren). Aided by ape-woman 
Ari (Helena Bonham Carter), who believes humans and primates should coexist 
as equals, the escapees begin their journey to a place called the "Forbidden 
Zone," where they hope to reach salvation. 
Murkily plotted and slightly written, by William Broyles Jr., Lawrence 
Konner, and Mark D. Rosenthal, "Planet of the Apes" is a marginally ambitious 
sci-fi adventure that feels like it could have used another rewrite. Very 
little seems to happen in its 119-minute running time, and what does is 
merely passable--unexciting, frequently uninvolving, and just sort of there. 
Also desperately lacking in character development, the film never allows you 
to grow attached to anyone onscreen (with one exception), and so you stop 
caring and become impatient. The talent roster is certainly impressive, 
especially for such a big-budget film, but not much is done with any one of 
them. Mark Wahlberg (2000's "The Perfect Storm") is an arresting actor who 
is, nonetheless, vapid as Leo Davidson. Nothing is learned about Leo in the 
course of the film, and Wahlberg's performance seems akin to a mirage--he 
just doesn't seem to be playing at the usual top of his game. Tim Roth 
(2000's "Lucky Numbers") disappears behind layers of Rick Baker's flawless 
ape makeup, as the villainous Thade, and with his human identity also goes a 
memorable presence. As for the sultry Estella Warren (2001's "Driven"), she 
is horribly put to waste as the human Daena, who says very little, and seems 
to be thinking even less. At the climax, we are led to believe that she has 
fallen for Leo, and it is one of the most laughably unwarranted film romances 
to come around the pike in some time. Had as much work been done in giving 
the people a little more personality as was spent on the Oscar-bound makeup, 
there might have been a little more material to chew on. 
Thank goodness for small favors. Helena Bonham Carter (1999's "Fight Club") 
is the aforementioned one exception to the character problems, and she is a 
standout. As the determined, earnest Ari, Carter paints her role with just 
the right shading of emotion, longing, and hopefulness, and the results are 
dynamite. When all is said and done, it is Carter's sparkling turn that 
should get the much-earned credit. 
Feeling obligated to one-up its 1968 predecessor, "Planet of the Apes" has 
two separate plot twists at the end. The first one is more or less 
predictable, and anyone with a sharp eye will be able to spot the setup 
during the early scene where Leo crashes his pod on the planet. The second 
twist appears at the very end, and it is almost enraging in how little sense 
it actually makes. While the undiscriminating viewer may think it is "cool" 
and move on, put up to a split second of closer scrutiny unveils it to not 
only be illogical, but also pointless. Tim Burton may have reimagined the 
older "Planet of the Apes" for his current version, but the outcome was not 
necessarily for the better.
