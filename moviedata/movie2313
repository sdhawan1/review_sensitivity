"There are actually two worlds -- our world and the digital world," 
explains the narrator of DIGIMON: THE MOVIE.  "But don't plan a vacation 
there since I don't even know where it is."  Finding out where it is 
will be the least of your problems since the movie's plot is about as 
clear as one of those obscure "illegal instruction" error message that 
your computer spits at you when it's angry.  In a movie designed solely 
for its fans who possess the magic, mental decoder ring, they alone will 
be able to decipher it.  And with the attraction of free trading cards 
-- while supplies last -- they will probably be going in droves as they 
did to the POKEMON movies, which featured the same come-on gimmick.
Speaking of the POKEMON movies, my wife said that she thought that she 
would never say it, but she found both of the POKEMON movies were 
superior to the DIGIMON one.  My son, however, disagrees, but he'll get 
his chance to chime in at usual spot at the end of the review.
Digimon are "digital monster" pets kept by human, mainly Japanese, kids.  
Most kids have only one, but there's this one kid in Colorado who is the 
lucky owner of two digimon.  The pets can do everything from pooping on 
the rug to launching nuclear weapons.  When they evolve, called 
digivolving, they cause such an electrical surge that it disrupts all of 
the electrical appliances in the city.
The film's animation is second rate with dull colors and fuzzy drawing.  
Neither this, nor the lackluster music, can compensate for the story's 
confusion.  In the spirit of full disclosure, I have to admit that I 
cheated!  A couple of times I had to lean over and ask my son, a Digimon 
aficionado, who was who, since most of the characters are so similarly 
drawn.
The best parts of the movie are a few funny lines, although some are 
unintentionally so, such as, "Diabormon is eating the Internet!"  When 
disaster strikes, Tai (Joshua Seth) tells Izzy (Mona Marshall), "Maybe 
we should call someone important like the president or Bill Gates."  The 
best comes when Izzy asks Tai, in disgust at his lack of knowledge, "Do 
you know what a semiconductor is?"  "Someone who works part-time at the 
railroad?" Tai guesses.
Izzy's idea of a good time, we are told, "is trying to upgrade his 
computer."  Unless you are already a knowledgeable Digimon fan, pass on 
the movie and have more fun by upgrading your computer.  Trust me, 
upgrading, probably not your idea of a good time, will be much more 
enjoyable.
DIGIMON: THE MOVIE runs 1:29, but it'll feel much longer.  It is rated 
PG for action violence and would be acceptable for all ages.
My son Jeffrey, age 11, gave the movie ****.  He said he liked 
everything about it except for the digivolving part, which went too 
fast.

_Digimon:_The_Movie_ (PG) * (out of ****)
If you think a passing familiarity with _Pokémon_ is preparation enough
for _Digimon:_The_Movie_--the big screen debut of the _Pokémon_
knockoff/rival television series--think again.  In fact, nothing but an
extensive knowledge of the DigiMythos will make the story of this
animated feature the slightest bit comprehensible.  Not that it really
matters, anyway--when it all comes down to it, this is just one
exhausting 70something-minute exercise in hyperactive visuals and sound. 
_Pokémon_ on speed, if you will.
After a baffling and completely unnecessary pre-film vignette about a
rabid _Digimon_ fan waiting in line at a movie theatre and imagining
herself in a _Digimon_ adventure (this piece of work makes the Pikachu
shorts that precede the _Pokémon_ films look like Oscar bait),
_Digimon:_The_Movie_ wastes no time in getting the plot underway.  A
brief voiceover narration by the character Kari (voiced by
_Gimme_a_Break!_ alumna Lara Jill Miller) dispenses some exposition
before the first of what are many battles between Digimon.  Now what
_are_ Digimon, you ask?  The nearest I could figure is that they're some
strange breed of monster that originates in cyberspace but sometimes
crosses over into the real world by way of an egg that somehow emerges
from a computer screen.  How or why this happens, I don't know.  Maybe it
was covered in that narration, maybe not--it is delivered so quickly that
it's impossible to not miss something.
Why do these Digimon fight?  I suppose it all comes down to some being
"bad" and some being "good."  The "good" ones are able to be summoned by
children called the DigiDestined (how they are selected and what they are
destined to do is beyond me) to defeat the "bad" ones in the digital
world.  In the first half of the film, the bad Digimon is a computer
virus that threatens to wipe out the world's computers, and its up to
Kari's big brother Tai (Joshua Seth), the rest of the DigiDestined, and
their Digimon to save the world.  It's no spoiler to say that Tai and
company do... but then the story picks up four years later, with some new
characters and an older Kari facing some remnant of said destructive
Digimon.
All this, of course, would make sense to the target audience of
6-year-olds who watch the _Digimon_ television series every weekday
afternoon on Fox.  But that's a moot point for them, since the show and
the film are all about the fire-breathing, bomb-exploding, all-stops-out
battles between Digimon.  And the makers of _Digimon:_The_Movie_ don't
skimp, barely taking a breath between action scenes.  While this ensures
that the tykes won't ever get antsy, it also guarantees one big
headache--and a severe case of motion sickness to match--for adults.  The
violence may be between the Digimon, but it's the older viewers in the
audience that feel the pain.
The pace may be quicker and the action louder and more extreme than in
_Pokémon_, but that doesn't necessarily make _Digimon_ better.  With the
assaultive nature comes the absence of any slight bit of humanity.  Say
what one will about _Pokémon_ poster critter Pikachu, one must concede
that he has personality, and there is some warmth to his relationship
with trainer Ash Ketchum.  Here, all the characters, human and Digimon
alike, are merely interchangeable pieces in a mechanical game--an apt
description for _Digimon:_The_Movie_, a "movie" in name only.
