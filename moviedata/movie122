Angels in the movies are nothing new. From Wings of Desire to A Life Less
Ordinary. Similarly, the idea of Earth as a battlefield is older than
Milton, and has been done as well (Prophecy I & II, etc). God's even taken
mortal (comic) form before, as George Burns. However, never before has
George Carlin been a cardinal, Chris Roc the 13th apostle, Selma Hayek an
exotic-dancing muse. Religion on the big screen's always been a little too
orthodox for that. As in sacred. As in be careful, Salman Rushdie. With
Dogma, Kevin Smith is more than just not careful, he's irreverent, glib,
interpreting the (Catholic) Church through, say, Ghostbusters. Meaning Jesus
Christ becomes 'J.C.' Prophets speak with profane tongues. Nuns are
corruptible. Angels carry guns and aren't at all reluctant to use them. In
fact, the one stable role in Dogma is Janeane Garofalo, the slightly bitter
abortion clinic employee. She's the only one not crusading, the only one
without holy import.
However--though roles like this were practically made for her--Jeanine
Garofalo's not the 'doubting hero' that just about every religious movie
needs to 'convert,' (where conversion stands in for character development)
but Linda Fiorentino is, as Bethany, which continues the longstanding
religious thriller tradition (Seventh Sign, Stigmata, etc) of having a
single women save the world. Kind of like an anti-Eve, just one who turns
fire extinguishers on burning, talking bushes. But who in the 20th century
wouldn't, right? This type commentary constitutes a large part of Dogma--the
lingering suspicion that religious iconography hasn't kept up with the
times. As Cardinal Carlin says, it's time for some revamping; as Nietzsche
might say, though, 'vamp' in that context means already dead. Dogma tosses
all of this around and more.
It all starts when two exiled angels--Loki (the Norse trickster?; Matt
Damon) and Bartleby (as in the Scrivener; Ben Affleck)--discover they can go
home again, via a biblical loophole in the garden state itself, New Jersey.
So now they have four days left to kill, literally, on Earth. The thing is,
though, if they do sneak back into heaven, it'll show that God (AWOL for 98%
of Dogma) isn't quite as infallible as s/he claims to be, and we can't have
that. Meaning his/her crack staff has to mobilize against Loki and Bartleby,
whose Swedenborgian hostility towards mortals is getting a tad out of hand
(see: office massacre, etc). Thus starts all the divine warfare,
interspersed with what turns out to be some rational theological
discussions. But then Kevin Smith's strong suit has always been dialogue.
If only he would have stuck to dialogue, too, Dogma would have been a much
stronger movie. As is, it feels effects-laden at times, (e.g., an
unnecessary fecal golem, etc) and all the delays in getting to the battle
scene in New Jersey feel forced, contrived--as if it's all been extended
simply to allow these top-billed stars a few more trailer-worthy scenes.
Surprisingly, too, a few of the jokes fall embarrassingly flat, even one of
Silent Bob's (Kevin Smith). And, unlike his compadre Jay, (Jason Mewes) he's
supposed to only talk when it really matters. They are dramatically written
in this time, though, so perhaps the occasional dead line is part of the
package.
In Dogma's favor, it is loud, fast and funny, it all just goes a little
long, tries to work in a few too many jokes, when less would have been more.
Compared to Clerks and Chasing Amy, Dogma is sub-par Kevin Smith. Or, Kevin
Smith with a real budget, no longer having to innovate. On its own, though,
it's still better than two-thirds of the movies out there, and has enough
in-stuff going on (Quick Stop, Dante, etc) that die-hard Kevin Smith fans
won't go away feeling cheated. In case you're not a Kevin Smith acolyte,
though, there's still the guiltysweet transgression ('hellworthy trespass,'
in Dogma-terms) of seeing 'God' in lowercase, in the credits, of hearing
angels swear, of dressing George Carlin up in robes, any of which make Dogma
just about worth the price of admission.

     One of my favorite comedies of all time is Stanley Donan's
BEDAZZLED featuring the writing and acting of Peter Cook and Dudley
Moore.  It is a retelling of the story of Faust in modern terms.  But
what makes it funny is are the often hilarious discussions of theology
and religious dogma between the Devil and a nebbish Wimpy Burger grill
man selling his soul.  Films rarely get into humorous examinations of
anything so abstract as religious belief and in the deft hands of Cook
and Moore it made for a really original comedy.  I hardly expected a
film along these lines from relative newcomer Kevin Smith, with only
the films CLERKS, MALL RATS, and CHASING AMY under his belt.  None of
these films indicated any inclination toward a far-out fantasy with a
humorous take on religious belief, one along the lines of BEDAZZLED.
When I heard that was what he had done I came hoping for a lot and I
got a lot, but not the same lot.  Smith wrote himself a script that a
many-year veteran director might have found overly ambitious.  There is
just too much in the film for it to all hang together.  One has the
feeling that any fleeting idea Smith had stuck to the script like
flypaper.  Somehow feces monsters, heavy violence, deep theological
discussion, fantasy, and an action thriller plot just do not all fit
comfortably in the same film.
     The plot is convoluted and often the viewer has to listen quick to
get the concepts.  Apparently two fallen angels Loki and Bartleby
(played by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck) have found a loophole in God's
rules so that they can get back into heaven, though they may have to
destroy the world to do it.  An abortion clinic worker Bethany (Linda
Fiorentino) is chosen by the archangel Metatron (Alan Rickman) to stop
the two angels.  Soon she is traveling with Kevin Smiths repeating
characters Jay and Silent Bob.  In DOGMA we learn they are prophets of
the Lord.  This may limit their usefulness to Smith in future films.
They are also joined by Rufus (Chris Rock), the 13th Apostle whom we
never heard about in the New Testament because he was black.  The fact
that the film also suggests that Christ was also black requires some
fancy explaining.  What Smith should have done was drop one idea of the
other and not was screen time reconciling the two ideas.  There is
enough explaining that has to be done in this film as it is.  George
Carlin has a small role as a Catholic Cardinal with a concept for
popularizing religion.  It is possible that the ideas for this sequence
were all Smith's or perhaps he was writing a pastiche in the style of
George Carlin.  But the whole George Carlin Buddy Jesus sequence is
very, very much in the style of Carlin and it would hardly surprise me
to find out that the long-time iconoclastic comedian had a lot of input
on his sequence or even wrote it himself.  Tiny roles go to Bud Cort
and Janeane Garofalo.  It is not clear why name actors were needed in
such tiny roles.
     With CHASING AMY Kevin Smith showed that he could write characters
with some emotional complexity.  Unfortunately DOGMA does not take the
time for developing characters in a meaningful way.  The acting and
seems much cruder in this film than in CHASING AMY.  Some surprisingly
crude production values betray the low budget this film must have had.
Particularly noticeable early in the film words seem to fit lips very
poorly as if the in studio dubbing were not competently done.  The plot
calls for special effects but they range from adequate to crude.
     The script is full of interesting ideas but frequently they go by
at lightning speed and such basic concepts as why the action is taking
place now rather than at some other point of the past or future seem
too quickly glossed over.  Consideration should have been given how to
convey the ideas better.  Inconsistencies mix into Christian theology
in the form of a muse from Greek mythology and the Norse god Loki.
Humor is always subjective and there were members of the audience
laughing, but for me much of the levity for me fell flat and was not
even germane to the subject matter (e.g. Wisconsin cheese hats).  Smith
needs to be more selective in the humor included.  Smith might well
have considered letting less be more.
     DOGMA comes close to subject matter I would have greatly enjoyed.
A little refinement of the script could have made this like BEDAZZLED,
an intelligent comedy to be savored for years.  It still has a lot to
offer, but I rat it only a 5 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +1 on the
-4 to +4 scale.  DOGMA's reinterpretation of theology is causing the
same protest that Milton or Dante might face if they were around today.
The upside is that the protests appear for now to be low-key and
generally ignored.

Year: 1999.
Starring Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Linda Fiorentino, Chris Rock, Salma Hayek,
Alan Rickman, Jason Lee, Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith, George Carlin.
Written by Kevin Smith.
Directed by Kevin Smith.
Rated R.
Kevin Smith's "Dogma" shows that the young director of "Clerks" and "Chasing
Amy"  has learned to make a big-budget movie without turning it into the
overstuffed turkey "Mallrats" was. This film is, for the most part, a fun,
thoughtful romp through the Catholic religion. It's clever and funny while
asking some very worthwhile questions about what the church has become.
Rather than being a condemnation of religion, as some advocates have
claimed, it is really more of a devout meditation on this filmmaker's own
beliefs, ones that are probably shared by a great many Catholics. It's not
perfect, and Smith's indulgences get in the way of the narrative (such as it
is) too often, suggesting he hasn't completely mastered his use of a bigger
budget, but it's still a funny, entertaining experience. "Dogma" is humorous
and thoughtful at the same time, something that is rare in a film from a
filmmaker as young as Smith, but very welcome.
Ben Affleck and Matt Damon star as Bartleby and Loki, two renegade angels
trying to get back into heaven through a loophole opened up by the Catholic
Church. Because of a doctrine passed down by Cardinal Glick (George Carlin),
they find that they simply need to pass through the doors of a church in New
Jersey in order to be absolved of all wrongdoing. Unfortunately, since this
will prove God fallible, it will result in the universe being blinked out of
existence. To stop Bart and Larry, a messenger angel (Alan Rickman) who acts
as the voice of God enlists Bethany (Linda Fiorentino), a Catholic abortion
clinic worker having a crisis of faith. Along to help her are Jay and Silent
Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) as unlikely prophets, Rufus the 13th
Apostle (Chris Rock), who was left out of the Bible because he was black,
and Serendipity (Salma Hayek), a muse who has taken human form, only to be
stricken with writer's block. Further complicating matters is Azrael (Jason
Lee), a demon with his own agenda who is actively trying to help the angels
and hinder the good guys.
Kevin Smith's best talent is as a writer, as the dialogue-driven "Clerks"
and "Chasing Amy" proved. In "Dogma," his fourth effort, Smith begins to
show some signs of growth as a director. He has begun making use of camera
movement and including action taking place behind the focus of the scene.
Smith has always been rather lackluster cameraman (by his own admission),
and his visual style is still mostly of the "talking-heads" variety, but he
shows a little more visual flair here than he has in previous films.
As always, when he concentrates on writing conversations, Smith tinges them
with just the right amount of wit to get his point across without becoming
preachy. His script is a little disjointed, with too much expository
dialogue, but it still contains enough worthwhile moments to overlook its
flaws. Smith does a good job of alternating between smart satire and the
"poop jokes" his audience has become used to. There are several priceless
bits, the standout being George Carlin's "Catholicism WOW!" program, in
which his Cardinal Glick announces that he will replace the "depressing"
crucifix symbol with the more jovial "Buddy Christ." Smith's idea of a Jesus
for the 90's is flat-out hilarious. Chris Rock has some good moments,
especially during his explanation of why his apostle was left out of the
Bible. Some other inspired bits have Matt Damon talking a nun out of
Catholicism and an unusual (to say the least) casting choice in the role of
God. Smith has a fine pop-culture sensibility, including references to
everything from "Sixteen Candles" to "Indiana Jones." Most of them work.
The performances in "Dogma" are varied. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck have the
same chummy chemistry they exhibited in "Good Will Hunting." Linda
Fiorentino is passable as Bethany, but she's hampered by a lack of emotional
range and Smith's obvious discomfort with dramatic scenes. Her one "big"
emotional moment comes off like an excuse to get her into a wet shirt, and I
'm still wondering if anybody in the real world has ever actually uttered
the sentence, "I'm physically and psychologically exhausted." Chris Rock and
Alan Rickman have plenty of good moments, the latter delivering all his
lines with delicious sarcasm. Jason Lee (who seems to Kevin Smith what
Samuel L. Jackson is to Tarantino) continues to impress as a solid
supporting actor, taking the role of the heavy with devilish glee (please
excuse the bad pun). Salma Hayek has yet to prove to me that she's more than
a pretty face, while George Carlin's scenes are all wonderfully inspired
("The Catholic Church does not make mistakes!"). Jay and Silent Bob, the
recurring characters of Smith's filmography, get a much larger slice of
screen time here, and their Mutt-and-Jeff antics keep the film continually
lively, even when it gets bogged down in exposition. Jay's stoner quips are
consistently funny (that is, if you aren't offended by constant use of the
F-word) and Silent Bob's facial expressions never cease to amuse me.
Where "Dogma" really runs into problems is in its story. Smith may be
proficient at writing witty dialogue and one-liners, but he still has yet to
understand good pacing. One of the reasons I think "Clerks" is still his
best movie is that he didn't bother with a story, just piecing together
scenes from a day in the life of a convenience store clerk. Here, he's got
an action movie plot as a vehicle for his discussions of Catholic dogma as a
vehicle for throwaway jokes and gags. Very often, the story gets lost in the
shenanigans. What "Dogma" needed after its fast start was a quick wrap-up.
Unfortunately, we get a long, drawn-out climax that takes far too long to
dispatch of the many characters it has introduced and is soiled by far too
much violence (a shame, since some of Smith's better jokes come in the final
sequence). This is a clear example of Smith getting too caught up in his
comic book indulgences, though the most egregious example happens when he
has a monster composed entirely of human feces threaten our heroes, only to
have him taken care of in a ridiculously conventional manner. I don't know
why he decided to leave this scene in, other than the obvious reason that it
cost quite a bit of money to produce. Smith needs to learn restraint before
he can be considered a "great" filmmaker. I do give him credit for trying,
though, because I see some signs of improvement here. He definitely didn't
indulge himself as much as he did in "Mallrats" (his other big-budget
production), which was a lifeless mess, save for Jason Lee's performance. If
he keeps on track, he should have a good grasp on what it takes to make a
complete motion picture.
"Dogma" is far from a perfect film, but it's nevertheless a worthwhile
experience, and sure to please fans of the director. (Note to Smith
devotees: Look for cameos by the two original stars of "Clerks," Brian O'
Halloran and Jeff Anderson.) Smith is a filmmaker with his own voice, and as
a practicing Catholic, he has clearly made a work that comes from the heart.
His discussion of Catholicism is intriguing, often exhausting, and always
honest, while his trademark wit remains firmly intact. Smith is a writer and
novice director who is clearly still learning his trade, but he is also
showing improvement. He has the pop-culture sensibility of Quentin Tarantino
and the scattershot politics of Spike Lee. If he keeps this up, he could
make some truly great movies in the future. "Dogma" is merely a good one.

     In DOGMA, Smith's long-awaited and already vilified indictment of
the Catholic church, the auteur has gone to great lengths to show us he
can take on any establishment and gut it wide open.  To wit:
     DOGMA tells the story of two fallen angels (Affleck and Damon,
natch) who decide to take advantage of a loophole in Catholic dogma and
weasel their way back into Heaven.  God's messenger (Rickman) is sent to
convince the cynical Bethany (Fiorentino) to stop the angels because if
they make it into Heaven, the world will end.  Along the way, Bethany
enlists the aid of a half-dozen nutty characters, including prophets Jay
and Silent Bob (Mewes and Smith), the muse Serendipity (Hayek,
inexplicably borrowed from Greek mythology), and the 13th Apostle Rufus
(Rock).  Jason Lee also makes his usual Smith movie appearance as
Azrael, a demon trying to stop Bethany.
     Make sense?  If it doesn't, don't worry.  Smith goes to great
lengths to explain things over and over again, in long-winded monologues
that pepper the entire film.  In fact, the sermons are DOGMA's biggest
failing.  In trying to point out the fallacies of Catholicism, Smith
becomes just as preachy and sanctimonious as the institution he's trying
to lampoon.  You can't fight fire with fire in this case.
     While any film that features George Carlin as a Bishop trying to
introduce a new Christian icon (Jesus giving the thumbs-up) gets my
vote, and DOGMA is not short on laughs, too much of the film is flat.
Jay's sex talk is disarming at first, tired by the end.  Alanis
Morrissette as God?  Snooze.  THE BUTCHER BOY already did Sinead
O'Connor as the Virgin Mary.  Now *that* takes balls.
     Still, DOGMA remains one of the funnier films of the year.  But
more importantly, whether you agree with Smith or not, you're sure to be
offended.

         After months of debate in the media over its supposedly
sacrilegious content, it's sort of bewildering to discover
writer-director Kevin Smith's "Dogma" is not an all-out attack on the
Catholic church but rather a rambunctious satire which ultimately turns
out to be an endorsement of faith. Is it irreverent and crude? Of
course, but what else would you expect from the man who made "Clerks,"
the first film to win an NC-17 rating purely on the basis of its
dialogue?
 In "Dogma," Smith (who professes to have been raised a
Catholic) asks some of the same kinds of questions you might expect to
hear from a precocious child after Sunday School. Did Joseph and Mary
ever consummate their marriage after Jesus was born? Did Jesus have
brothers and sisters? Why does the Bible skip over what happened to
Jesus between the ages of 12 and 30? As you might expect, the answers
Smith comes up with are, to put it lightly, a bit unorthodox. But he
takes pains to warn his audience about what's coming in a disclaimer at
the beginning of the film, asserting that "even God has a sense of humor
-- just look at the platypus."
 At any rate, anyone who's likely to be offended will probably
bail out on "Dogma" in the first ten minutes, right around the time a
cardinal (played by George Carlin, for heaven's sake) unveils the new
"Catholicism Wow!" campaign which promises "a renewal of faith and
style." The centerpiece of his press conference is the unveiling of a
statue of a grinning Jesus offering a thumbs-up sign to his followers.
The cardinal dismisses the old image of the crucifix, insisting "Christ
didn't come to Earth to give us the willies."
 That bit sets the tone for a meandering tale about the race to
stop fallen angels Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck) from
re-entering Heaven, a feat which would prove God's fallibility and bring
on the end of existence. Linda Fiorentino plays Bethany, an abortion
clinic worker who's astonished to find she's the one hand-picked by God
to prevent this calamity, especially since she's obviously a bit
spiritually conflicted. She attends Mass dutifully, but joylessly and
confides to her co-worker Liz (Janeane Garofalo) she thinks God is dead.
"The sign of a true Catholic," Liz cracks.
 Before long, Bethany will be joined in her crusade by Jay
(Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith), the duo who've become Smith's
answer to Laurel and Hardy after their previous appearances in "Clerks,"
"Mallrats" and "Chasing Amy." Although they score a few scattered laughs
this time around -- particularly when they reveal what lured them from
New Jersey to central Illinois -- the pair's shtick is beginning to wear
thin, and "Dogma" might have been a more focused film without them.
 Much more entertaining company is provided by the muse
Serendipity (Salma Hayek), who's currently visiting the Earth in the
guise of a stripper who does her act to New Edition's "Candy Girl," and
Rufus (Chris Rock), who claims he was the thirteenth apostle and was
left out of the Bible because he's black. Smith has given these
characters many of the script's choicest and most provocative lines.
 "Dogma" is practically bursting at the seams with ideas, some
of which Smith puts across with considerably more finesse than others.
He gets a delightfully dry performance from Alan Rickman as the
underappreciated seraphim Metatron who berates Bethany for not
recognizing him. "You people -- if there's not a movie about it, it's
not worth knowing," he growls.
 Smith also proves Affleck and Damon are good sports (and able
comedians) by working in a few jokes alluding to the rumors about their
off-screen friendship, and even manages a couple of nasty swipes at
writer-director John Hughes by having Serendipity claim credit for have
inspired 19 of the top 20 films of all time. The sole exception is "Home
Alone": "Someone sold their soul to Satan to get the grosses up on
that." James Sanford

     When you're already laughing before the picture starts, it's a good
omen.  Kevin Smith, whose tilt at church dogma has already riled Catholic
legions and caused Disney to bail, has prefaced his movie with a disclaimer
suggesting that passing judgment is God's province and the rest of us
(critics included) should cut him some slack.  
    Most critics have, and I want in.  This is a hilarious movie, delicious
enough in its best moments to forgive occasional lapses in concentration
and (dare I say it) taste.  One cringes at even typing the word taste in a
review of a Smith movie ("Clerks", "Chasing Amy"); still, even amid this
riotous avalanche of obscenity and raunchy, merciless barbs at organized
religion, there are some tediously sophomoric gags -- the most obvious of
these a drawn-out poop monster scene that should have been flushed.  But
it's a small price to pay for the deceptive depth and originality of
"Dogma".
     Cardinal Glick (George Carlin) is reconsecrating his Red Bank, NJ
church as part of an effort to revitalize the image of Catholicism.  He's
replacing the depressing crucifix with a winking, grinning, thumbs-up
"Buddy Christ".  On the day of the rededication, everyone passing through
the Plenary Arch will, according to dogma, receive absolution and get
automatic entry to Heaven.  Two fallen angels (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon),
banished by God for all eternity to Wisconsin, spot a loophole: pass
through that arch and He will have to take them back.
     The downside?  This will prove God fallible, and the universe will be
obliterated.  
     Space and good sense prevent any further plot synopsis.  The actors
have fun: Affleck and Damon, Carlin, Linda Fiorentino as a disillusioned
Catholic who tithes her income from an abortion clinic to the Church, Chris
Rock as a Black apostle left out of scripture by a White conspiracy, Jason
Lee as a devil, Salma Hayek as a stripper/muse who inspired the 20 all-time
top-grossing movies except "Home Alone", Alan Rickman as God's mouthpiece
and Alanis Morissette as God Herself, plus Smith regulars Jay and Silent
Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith).
     At two hours plus, the pace doesn't always sustain, and it's certainly
not for everybody. But "Dogma" is far from anti-religion.  It's very
devout, and if anything has a weakness for preachiness, but its heart is in
the right place. "I have issues with anyone who makes faith a burden," says
Rock.

Being a huge fan of Kevin Smith, I was expecting a lot out of his newest
project 'Dogma'. It might just be Kevin's best work to date. It's very funny
with smart and foul-mouthed dialogue while unexpectedly it has a serious
undertone to it and besides going against God and Jesus Christ, it actually
tries to tell people that there is such a thing rather than that there isn't.
In 1994 a little $27,000 movie premiered at Sundance. This little film was
called 'Clerks' and this little film went on to become a huge video sensation.
You really can't meet a person on this green Earth who has not seen 'Clerks'.
It was hailed by critics as one of the best movies of the year and soon a
sequel is coming. In 1995 Kevin made another movie 'MallRats' that flopped
horribly, thought it was not the best movie ever made it was a pretty good
little flick. It was panned by critics but hailed by audiences and in 1997
'Chasing Amy' came out and was Kevin's biggest success to date. Now in 1999 we
get a great little movie by the name of 'Dogma'. 
Wow! What a cast. Ok here is the plot in this movie: Linda Fiorentino plays a
regular woman who works at an abortion clinic. One day at her house Metatron
(the voice of God) appears at her house much to her surprise and tells her that
she must stop two fallen angels (Matt Damon and Ben Affleck) from getting back
into Heaven by ways of a church. Ok now get this, she is told to find two
prophets: One who talks a lot and one who doesn't, however she gets Jay and
Silent Bob instead (who give us great performances). Now on her way to New
Jersey with Jay and Silent Bob to try and stop the two angels the 13th Apostle
falls out of the sky (Chris Rock) and helps guide her to find these angels.
Salma Hayek plays Serendipity who also helps her out along her way. Azrael
(Jason Lee) who is a demon is trying to help the two angels out so that they
can win. Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) has to now use the help of all these people
to try and stop the angels before they cheat their way back to Heaven leading
to a violent and bloody end that will make you think twice about your faith. 
What a movie, it is everything rolled into one: An offensive, offbeat, smart
and sassy comedy that surprisingly has a great message at the end, and ends up
being a feel-good movie. Who would have known Kevin had such a soft side on him
that could make us know that he is a faithful person himself. Now for those of
you who get offended with this movie really should not take it to heart. Yes it
may target the Catholic community and bash them a lot, but it also seems to
rather than go against God and Heaven, it actually goes with God and Kevin
gives a message that there is a God. This review may sound confusing at first
but really the only way to understand it is to see this excellent movie. 
Kevin goes to new lengths in this hilarious comedy and gives us some great
characters with not too much background or study and rather we start to know
the characters as we watch the movie. Of course the best (and funniest) of them
all is the only duo in history that have made me fall out of my chair laughing
and that my friends are Jay and Silent Bob. Probably the best characters in
movies that I like. The star-studded cast is amazing and has some other cameos
by George Carlin, Jeanne Garafolo and so may more that we start to lose track
after a while. The script was written by Kevin Smith with many f'words in there
of course and a strong emphasis on sexual talk but he also seems to concentrate
on what is important rather that what isn't and makes us laugh at the same time
as we think. 
Chris Rock gives a hilarious performance and gets into his character very well,
with some classic lines. Linda Fiorentino is just perfect for her role and
makes us believe that she really is who she is. Of course Jason Mewes and Kevin
Smith do a great job as Jay and Silent Bob with some priceless lines from Jay
(as well as Silent Bob). Alan Rickman, Jason Lee, Salma Hayek round out the
cast with Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in the starring roles. Being Oscar Winners
for the classic 'Good Will Hunting' they give great performances here again but
Matt Damon seems just a little held back and to me did not give it all he
could. Ben however was all out and got very much into his character as well as
the story. 
The movie's only big flaw is that it has a few unfunny lines and some slow
parts to go along with it. However the direction by Kevin and the script by
Kevin as well as the priceless performance by many of the cast members, 'Dogma'
stands as a new classic and I think I can safely compare it to 'Clerks'. While
being funny at times, in the end it becomes a serious movie with an important
message that some may not agree with but can't deny it. 'Dogma' will offend
people, especially deeply religious people, but for those of you who are open
minded and want to see some very funny material then this is the movie for you.
All Kevin Smith Fans MUST SEE!!

Loki (Damon) and Bartleby (Affleck) are angels who have been 
expelled from heaven and sent to Wisconsin.  All they want to 
do is go home.  They find a loophole in the divine punishment.  
Cardinal Glick (Carlin) is offering absolution to the first 
people to walk through the rededicated St. Michael's church 
in New Jersey.  Loki and Bartleby forsake the cheese state for 
the garden state and a chance to reenter heaven.
Only if God is proven wrong, then the very fabric of creation 
is destroyed.  So, to prevent them, Bethany (Fiorentino as a 
Catholic abortion clinic worker suffering a crisis of faith) 
is given the mission of stopping them by Metatron (Rickman as 
the angelic voice of God).  Helping her are the prophets Jay 
(Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith) who functioned as Greek chorus 
in Smith's first film Clerks.  Along the way, she encounters the 
13th apostle Rufus (Rock) and Serendipity a muse now working as 
a stripper (Hayek).  Meanwhile, a demon from Hell and three 
rollerblading, hockey stick wielding demonic thugs try to stop 
her and her motley crew from completing their divine mission.
This film has been the victim of a boycott campaign launched by 
people who feel it mocks the Catholic faith.  I'm not a Catholic, 
but I know a fair bit about Catholic theology.  I also saw this 
film with a fairly devout Catholic.  Neither of us saw anything 
objectionable in this movie.  Some characters say and do things 
which the Church might disapprove of.  But the characters who 
are presented as angelic or saints always stay within established 
Catholic doctrine.  In fact, this is one of the few movies I have 
seen which correctly identifies angels as a separate order of 
creation (as opposed to the It's a Wonderful Life belief that 
dead people become angels).  It comes down firmly on the side of 
the virgin birth, the miracle of the incarnation, the absolute 
power of God, and the authority of the Church.  In fact, I can't 
think of a movie made this half of the century which so strongly 
affirmed the power and authority of the Church.
Having said all that, I understand why people feel the need to 
complain about this film.  It suggests one can be a good Catholic 
and yet disagree with Church policy (Bethany is prochoice but is 
found to be righteous by Loki).  The prophets (who are genuinely 
good at heart and clearly instruments of God) are drug dealers.  
But the key issue is that God is depicted as having a sense of 
humour.  And religion, as we all know, is a very serious 
business.
I think those people are wrong.  I like the idea that one can be 
a good person but sometimes do bad things.  That suggests we all 
have some chance at being good.  I like the argument that God is 
about redemption, salvation, and hope (all happy things) but all 
we focus on is sin, damnation, and punishment.  And if Smith's 
God acts in incomprehensible and bizarre ways, well what do you 
expect of a divine being so awesomely powerful that humans cannot 
even hear Him talk without being killed by the force of His voice.
I think Smith takes religion pretty seriously and incorporates it 
into his everyday life.  And I think he took that view with this 
movie, trying to bring out the spiritual aspects of mundane 
activities and mundane people.  I think he has some interesting 
things to say about religion and he's gathered some interesting 
actors to say it.  Rickman is great as the voice of God.  Damon 
and Affleck have a great time as the two desperately unhappy 
angels yearning to return home.  Rock is superb as the apostle 
with a mission, playing his part perfectly.  And Smith may be 
the world's only genuinely funny mime as the brilliant and 
insightful Silent Bob.  The rest of the cast never sink below 
good, although they rarely achieve excellence.
The problem in this movie lies not in the cast nor the idea, but 
in the general lack of jokes.  I did laugh.  I enjoyed the 
Catholicism Wow movement and the not so subtle attack on the 
Disney corporation.  Everybody in the theatre laughed at times.  
But there was no hysterical laughter, no uproarious moments.  
There were moments with decent laughs and no more.  As comedy, 
this film is average at best.  As a movie to make you think, 
it score a little above average. It's worth catching at matinee 
prices but I don't think I could recommend full price for it.

STARRING:  Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Linda Fiorentino, Chris Rock, Alan
Rickman, Janeane Garofalo, Jason Lee, Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith
DIRECTOR:  Kevin Smith
WRITTEN BY:  Kevin Smith
In the North America of the late 90's, a time and place wherein the
description "devout Catholic" is an oxymoron, you wouldn't think a film
like Dogma would have had trouble finding a distributor, much less
require the painfully self-embarrassed disclaimer which precedes it.
Surely even the most pious, guilt-ridden RC couldn't possibly take
offense to something Smith rightly calls a "comic fantasy," something so
purposely irreverent it rivals the Great Schism for sheer,
laugh-out-loud ludicrousness.  I mean, come on.  We're talking about a
movie that features Damon and Affleck as fallen angels (complete with
really fake-looking wings) who discover a policy loophole that will
either allow them to get back into Heaven with a clean slate-- or cause
the obliteration of everything, depending on whom you ask.  We're
talking about dusky-voiced Fiorentino as a heroine whose family tree
contains more 'begot's than the Book of Genesis, and Chris Rock as
"Rufus, the Thirteenth Apostle," who insists he was written out of the
Bible because he's black.  We're talking about inspired bits of ironic
casting like Alanis Morissette as God, or better yet, George Carlin as a
Cardinal who interprets Jesus' "Let the children come unto me," as "Get
'em when they're young."  We're talking about stoners Jay and Silent Bob
(Jason Mewes and Smith, who show up as these same characters in every
Smith movie) as prophets, fer chrissakes.  By all rights, a film this
goofy should have inspired nothing more than simple indifference, and
not just in Catholics.
Yet for the most part, it all clicks.  Damon and Affleck are ideal as
millennia-old buddies; their scenes together have a seemingly
effortless, comfortable ease, and they even get to poke fun at
speculation about their offscreen relationship.  Certain corporate
idolaters are slammed mercilessly, to hilarious effect.  Even Jay's
juvenile, expletive-riddled banter, annoying as it can be, often
provides a shockingly funny counterpoint when the going threatens to get
serious.  The film does lose some steam in the late going, however, and
the ending doesn't match the promise of the first half.  Still, Dogma
ends up being a thoughtful and heartfelt expression of Smith's simple
message about the difference between ideas and beliefs, faith and
religion, and why we're all here.

**1/2 (out of 4) DOGMA entertained me but it did not impress me.
Kevin Smith (Chasing Amy, Clerks) is both a good writer and a bad
writer. His ideas are inventive, perceptive, and honest. His material is
some of the freshest around. On the other hand, his characters speak in
wordy monologues and obvious plot-driven exposition.
DOGMA is a comic-book-like story of two angels bent on getting into
heaven as human souls. Their plan is to become human, walk through a
Catholic loophole to purify themselves, then die and go to straight to
heaven. Of course, once they do this all of creation will be unmade, but
what do they care? No foul, no harm, right?
The mythic rules of this heroic tale are those of the rich, complex
world of Catholic dogma. The hero (Bethany, played by Linda Fiorentino)
is referred to as the Last Scion. Her spirit guides are the Seraphim
Metatron (how's THAT for a comic book name? -- he's played by Alan
Rickman) and the thirteenth Apostle (Chris Rock). She's aided by two
prophets (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith, reprising their roles as Jay and
Silent Bob). And the beast trying to stop her is the Demon Azrael (Jason
Lee) who abets the fallen angels and sends three skating minions and a
Shit Demon against the hero (okay, maybe the Shit Demon isn't a Catholic
symbol).
At first glance it seems irreverent, if not downright heretical. Among
other things, Bethany works at an abortion clinic and must perform
euthanasia to save the world. But deeper down, Smith really seems to
take it seriously. He DOES poke fun at the church, but always as an
insider, like he's making fun of himself. He never takes any cruel,
cheap shots, and he never disses it just to shock or annoy. There's
always a sense of real acceptance of and interest in the church. No
other movie in recent memory has so many characters talking seriously
about religion.
Unfortunately this talking is often stagey and obvious. In order to work
in everything he has to say, Smith's characters speak as if in a play.
Nobody interrupts the paragraph-length discussions on race, the
structure of the church, and on the validity of "Plenary Indulgences" 
the loophole that will allow the angels to get away with the murder of
Creation.
Although the discussions are interesting and relevant to the topic of
the film, a narrative film isn't the best art form for what Smith's
lengthy speeches. A comic book would be much more appropriate. (On the
other hand, feature filmmaking has a broader audience for Smith's
message. As Metatron said, "If there isn't a movie about it, it isn't
worth knowing, is it?")
As a non-Catholic, I found DOGMA to be entertaining, but I could tell
that about half of the jokes went over my head. I felt like I was the
third person in a conversation between two old friends. In other words,
Smith's movie did not speak to me at all.
To Catholics with a sense of humor about themselves, I would recommend
this movie more highly. For the rest of us, it's an entertaining, if
unimpressive matinee.

At one point in the controversial religious comedy "Dogma," an
irritated apostle turns to a human and snaps, "I have issues with
anyone who treats God like a burden rather than a blessing, the way
some of you Catholics do. You people don't celebrate your faith; you
mourn it." Amen! There are few things more annoying than "true
believers" who squander the miracle of life by trudging joylessly
through their days, scowling at the wonders around them while passing
judgment on anyone who does not adhere to their particular
interpretation of "divine truth."
Take, for example, the Catholic League, who has spent months
campaigning against "Dogma." They haven't actually seen the film, mind
you, but they did read a version of the script over the Internet and
that was good enough to set off a series of protests from the outraged
members.
Writer, director and practicing Catholic Kevin Smith, the man behind
"Clerks," "Mallrats" and "Chasing Amy," tackles a lot in his fourth
feature. If anything, "Dogma" suffers from trying to cram too many
ideas into one movie. Stripped of its mountain of biblically sound
exposition, the story boils down to this: two renegade angels, cast
out of Heaven, find a theological loophole that will allow them back
in. Unfortunately, if they succeed in their quest, they will prove God
fallible and our world will wink out of existence. So a distant
descendent of a pivotal religious figure gets recruited to stop them.
"Dogma" is a wildly uneven film. Dense and overly talky, it is
consistently funny, vulgar and thought provoking. Moments of sheer
brilliance bang into segments of juvenile crap (I mean that
literally. In the movie's grossest scene, our heroes do battle with a
shit demon). Simple, eloquent statements about spirituality collide
with self-righteous tirades as excessively pious as those typically
made by the organized religion blowhards being satirized. "Dogma" is a
mess, but a glorious one. This is clearly a labor of love and
devotion. As with his previous works, Kevin Smith doesn't know when to
shut up. Another script rewrite and some severe editing would help the
story immeasurably. Still, "Dogma" remains an exhilarating treat that
couldn't have been created by any other author.
Your enjoyment of the film will depend in large part on your reaction
to Jay and Silent Bob, two mainstays of Kevin Smith movies who get a
lion's share of screen time here. I find the hapless stoners
hilarious. Jay (Jason Mewes) is an explosive motormouth obsessed with
getting laid (after an encounter with a deity in female form, he
confesses to getting a stiffy). His constant companion Silent Bob
(director Kevin Smith) is a stout, stoic soul who always manages to
come through when it counts. Together they make up the funniest duo
since Abbott and Costello.
But Jay and Silent Bob are just two of a cavalcade of unique
characters. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck do fine work as Loki and
Bartleby, the rampaging angels causing all the trouble. Their
squabbles and philosophical discussions are consistently
engaging. Chris Rock is a hoot as Rufus, the smart aleck 13th apostle
(he believes he was edited out of the Bible because of his skin
color). Salma Hayek and Jason Lee make lively appearances as a pair of
muses with decidedly different outlooks. And, get this: George Carlin
plays Cardinal Glick, the personification of all that is wrong with
organized religion. To make the church more palatable to contemporary
citizens, he cooks up a public relations campaign called "Catholicism
- - Wow!" that replaces the old, "depressing" crucifix with a new
icon, the "Buddy Christ": a cheesy, brightly colored Jesus who flashes
a toothy smile while pointing at the faithful and giving them a big
thumbs-up.
Anchoring all this lunacy is Metatron (Alan Rickman), a weary angel
who serves as the earthly voice of God, and Bethany (Linda Fiorentino)
a faith-impaired Catholic reluctantly drawn into the role of
savior. Rickman and Fiorentino are wonderful as the best-drawn
characters in the story. A subdued waterside conversation between the
two marks one of the most touching parts of the film.
The release of "Dogma" will likely bring a storm of damnation from
various commentators representing the religious establishment. I
suggest you see the film and decide for yourself. Despite its flaws
and excesses, I found the production extremely entertaining and very
spiritual. I lost both of my parents over the last year and, in the
months since, have found myself numb in areas of faith. The night
after seeing "Dogma," I finally closed my eyes and had a long
conversation with God. Thanks for the nudge, Kevin.

Susan Granger's review of "DOGMA" (Lion's Gate Films)
A holy war has been waged over this crude, controversial Kevin
Smith satire of Catholicism. Financed and developed by Bob and Harvey
Weinstein at Miramax, a Disney subsidiary, it was sold to Lion's Gate
after William Donohue's Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights
filed protests with Disney CEO Michael Eisner. The Catholic League
previously led a boycott of Disney over Priest, a 1995 Miramax release
which depicted a gay priest. Yet, despite all the fuss, Dogma is a
surprisingly dull parable. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck play fallen
angels who have been sent to everlasting exile in Wisconsin. Using a
loophole in Catholic doctrine, they know a way to get back into heaven
but their re-entry would negate all existence - at least that's what
abortion clinic worker Linda Fiorentino is told as her help is
enlisted by an angel (Alan Rickman). She's befriended by the black
13th Apostle (Chris Rock) and a spunky stripper-muse (Salma Hayek),
while being pursued by an exiled muse (Jason Lee). She encounters a
zealous Cardinal (George Carlin), who's promoting "a buddy Christ",
and discovers God is a woman (Alanis Morissette). So what? Among the
long, boring interludes is some particularly repugnant chicanery with
an excrement monster. Affleck and Damon are genial dudes but
Fiorentino mopes, smirks or snarls, showing no emotional or vocal
range. Kevin Smith's cult fans who enjoyed Clerks and Chasing Amy may
be the only audience for this feeble comic fantasy which is too heavy
on moralizing and too light on laughter. Smith's message - that
dogmatism is bad, that no one religion is better than any other - is
delivered with a thud. The sophomoric jokes basically bomb. On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, Dogma is an uninspired, trifling,
muddled 2. It's a dud.

A movie that has arose continuous controversy this year is Kevin Smith's
new comedy `Dogma'. The film was said to be deeply offensive toward
Catholics in it's manner of using organized religion as a basis for
comedy. Smith offers a disclaimer before the events in `Dogma' even
commence, stating that the film is not to be taken seriously and that
it's a work of comedic fantasy. He adds that `even God has a sense of
humor - just look at the platypus' (afterward, an apology is made to
platypus fanatics, but that's a different story).
In handling it's religious views, `Dogma' is certainly not as offensive
as you've been told. Smith actually takes the deep Catholicism quite
seriously, posing intriguing questions and answering them with a great
deal of faith and understanding. While not one of the best
films of the year, `Dogma' is a thoroughly interesting experience full
of surprising audacity.
Two fallen angels named Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck)
have been inhabiting the city of Wisconsin after they were banned from
Heaven for all eternity. Upon the arrival of an unidentified newspaper
clipping, the pair realize a possible way to re-enter the pearly gates:
a loophole in the Catholic dogma found in a church in New Jersey.
Passing through the arch at this church would grant them a trip back
into Heaven, but at the same time, it would wipe out all of human
existence. Metatron (Alan Rickman), the voice of God, is dispatched to
find the Last Scion' (or the savior of all human kind). The Scion is
none other than abortion clinic employee Bethany (Linda Fiorentino), who
must prevent Loki and Bartleby's passage into the church. Assisting her
are the two unlikely street prophets Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob
(director Smith), although they mainly just obsess about beautiful women
and smoke a lot of pot. Reprising their roles from `Clerks', `Mallrats'
and `Chasing Amy', Mewes and Smith are now (I'm convinced) two of the
funniest characters in modern cinema.
Along their trek to New Jersey, more heavenly assistance is sent. Rufus
(Chris Rock), who claims to be the unknown 13th Apostle, falls out of
the sky and lands on the highway pavement in the nude. Jay and Silent
Bob encounter Serendipity (Salma Hayek), a muse turned stripper who
claims responsibility for 19 of the 20 top-grossing films of all time.
Following our saviors is the horned demon Azrael (Jason Lee) and his
three roller-blading henchmen. I suppose `Dogma' is somewhat of a road
movie, and like most road movies, there are times the pace lags and the
interest is inconsistent.
There are also plenty of moments when the humor is side-splitting. The
duo of Mewes and Smith constantly delivers (Mewes with the punchline,
Smith with the deadpan reaction). As the leading heroine, Fiorentino has
too little to do with her important agenda, but the remainder of the
cast is solid and well-balanced. Damon and Affleck have always performed
well together, and here they provide the film's most thought-provoking
moments. Examine the scene in which Loki and Bartleby grill a group of
board members on their past sins, and you'll realize that `Dogma'
functions on separate levels than a simple religious comedy.
The remarkable script, written by Smith, covers a lot of unlikely bases
with a surprising amount of success. There's a hefty dose of cartoonish
violence thrown in (such as a sequence that could be dubbed Attack of
the Excrement Monster'), but none of it is particularly unsettling
because it looks purposely fake. Critic Roger Ebert has written that
perhaps non-Catholics should be issued a catechism at the door, but I
think the material doesn't lean that deeply into spirituality. `Dogma'
provides honest laughs and is sure to please the majority of Smith's
loyal followers (if they have forgiven him for `Mallrats'), but at the
same time, it's a bit of a departure for the acclaimed writer/director.
This film certainly has more widespread issues and pervasive violence,
but Smith never loses grasp, although he slips a bit in the occasional
interval of boring dialogue. An interesting move: Alanis Morisette has a
cameo as God. Isn't that ironic? (ha, ha... never mind).
Offensive? I don't think so. I would simply call `Dogma' a revelation of
truthful and interesting comedy.

DOGMA (director/director: Kevin Smith; cinematographer: Robert Yeoman;

It was hard to believe how bad this sophomoric spoof on Catholicism is,
but seeing is believing. Kevin Smith (Clerks/Mallrats/Chasing Amy) has
shown what it takes to make a satire that isn't funny and one that
doesn't have enough bite in it to be subversive (it is not shocking to
know that the director is a practising Catholic). This one is a yawner,
one in which I found it difficult to sit through, as its two hours of
belabored effort and uninspired acting seemed longer than that; and, it
was all in the name of getting beat over the head with the director's
inane indulgent musings on religion, as he tries to gross the audience
out with foul language, sight gags of unpleasant sights, such as a pile
of shit emerging from a toilet bowl, and an irrelevant premise for an
argument against Catholicism, an argument that is about as crude a one
as I have heard in some time. It is also a film that left me disgusted
not only because of its banal argument against Catholicism, but because
it was a wise-guy film, shot with a sneer, by someone without the
temperament and intellectual stability to make such a metaphysical film.
The filmmaker is way over his head in this attempt to combine serious
argument with one of silliness, spending most of his time lecturing and
moralizing the audience with his half-baked knowledge of theology and
then resorting to shock techniques to get across his laborious point of
view, as if it is a startling revelation he was revealing, that there is
politics in the Catholic Church. A typical aside to get at the church
dogma, used by Smith, is exemplified with this startling question to one
of the celestials who materializes, who is asked, "What the fuck is this
shit?" That is not the way a director who cares about what he is doing
probes his subject matter, unless he is a child trying to get the ire of
his parent and thinks his vulgarity counts for satirical genius.
The film's original distributor, Miramax, ran into trouble with the
Catholic League who complained about the film's sacrilegious content and
therefore forced it to be distributed by a smaller studio, Lion's Gate.
The protestors were right about one thing, the film is offensive. But
they are wasting their time protesting, this movie shouldn't be banned
(I don't want to see films banned). This film's only crime is that it is
a revolting film and there is no reason to make it a martyr, we have
enough martyrs in the world already.
This simple-minded tale begins on the boardwalk of Asbury Park, New
Jersey, as a homeless man (Bud Cort) is beaten unconscious by three
young thugs, who are rollerbladers, clad in hockey garb. It is important
for the story to note that the homeless person is put on life-support
and will later be shown to hide-in-him the body of God, who will come
out of him as real as sunlight and will be in appearance a woman
(Morissette). Take my word for it, seeing God in this film is
anticlimactic. The scene then shifts to a neighboring New Jersey
seashore community, Red Bank, and a Cardinal Glick (Carlin) is trying to
get a bigger audience for his church, by starting a movement to make
Christ a happier symbol for his congregation. That Carlin, a natural
comedian, is not funny in this role, a role that is ready-made for
comedy, indicates how poorly things are going for Smith.
The main plot revolves around the tale of two fallen angels, Loki
(Damon) and Bartleby (Affleck), who were banished to Wisconsin (which is
supposed to be worst than hell--yuk, yuk) by God for disobeying him.
They have found a loophole in church dogma to get them back into heaven
against God's will and therefore must go to Cardinal Glick's church in
Red Bank. The premise of "Dogma,"  is that Glick's church re-dedication
will allow
the banished angels to re-enter heaven, thus proving God fallible and,
thereby, negating all existence.
Linda Fiorentino plays Bethany, a young divorced Catholic woman,
questioning her faith, who works in an abortion clinic with Liz (Janeane
Garafalo). She is evidently a special person, a distant relation of
Jesus, and will become the human agent chosen to save the Earth.
The angel who speaks for God; you see, God can't speak to us directly,
his voice is too powerful for humans, so it is through Metatron
(Rickman) that this is done. He locates Bethany in her bedroom and
orders her on a holy mission to stop the two fallen angels from
Wisconsin from entering Glick's church. Fiorentino and Rickman are flat
and unconvincing in their roles, getting neither comedy nor drama out of
their performance, just giving me a mild headache listening to them
deliver their vacuous lines. For those who care, Bethany in the Bible,
is the home of Lazarus.
Bethany, while returning from the abortion clinic that night (it's never
explained why she is there alone at night, but then again, if one was to
look for holes in this story, the entire film would be full of holes),
is pounced upon by the same trio of thugs who did in the homeless man in
Asbury Park. To her rescue comes Jay (Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith), the
director himself, who is so full of hubris, he will even speak a few
lines during the course of the film. They fend off the attackers and
attach themselves to Bethany, showing themselves to be earthly morons
not tainted with religion, but horny guys interested in getting laid.
Catholic dogma declares God's word to be unquestioned and to be a good
Catholic one has to accept the dogma without questioning it. So Bethany
decides to go along with Metatron's story, never having left the church
completely, just disagreeing with its politics, and therefore she
reluctantly goes to New Jersey to restore her faith in God.
In any case, even if the the two earthbounds are misfits, they are now
considered by her to be prophets and, anyway, even if they are not
exactly what she thinks prophets should be, she could use their company
for protection. On the highway to Jersey, her car breaks down and Rufus
(Rock) falls nude from the sky hitting the road with a thud. You see, he
fell from heaven and tells them his tale about being the unknown 13th
apostle, but because he was black, the church fathers wrote him out of
the Bible. A few more diatribes go on about the church fathers, because
they were men, blamed women for sin in the world, and the more modern
faults of the church, such as going along with government policies on
slavery and remaining silent during the Holocaust, which compromised
their teachings for universal love. The problem with these revelations,
is that they are not exactly fresh news and they seemed to be delivered
in such a jarring manner, as if the actors were puppets just mouthing
words that seemed out of place. There was just no flow in this film,
just long periods of schlock comedy and boredom and endless talking.
Another helper is enlisted to the cause, on the road to Jersey, in the
the person of a stripper- muse named Serendipity (Salma), who is
discovered in a strip-tease lounge by the crew heading to Red Bank.
There is also an angel trying to play both sides of the fence, covering
all his bets, in the person of Azrael (Lee), a muse of Lucifer, who is
in charge of the menacing rollerbladers. You see, Lucifer, also has a
lot to lose if God is proven not to be infallible, after all, who would
then listen to him, especially after he couldn't get back into heaven
himself. So Azrael is seen as playing a double-edged game, helping God
and God's enemies.
What goes for comedy, is something like this, the crew is in a bar and
Azrael, equipped with horns on his head, tells the bartender to make him
a holy bartender and when he responds that he doesn't know what that is,
he is shot full of holes.
To take this film seriously is a big mistake, which is why I have no
sympathy for protestors of this film. If you got some laughs out of this
mishmash, then you got more than I did from it. I just felt relieved
that I sat through it and didn't walk out. Smith appears to be a very
limited director, he can't shoot action scenes, and his film was
childish and unfocused. It was one of the most disappointing films I
have seen, so far, in 1999, especially noting how it got some favorable
comments when shown in film festivals in America and abroad. What is
particularly disturbing for me, is that his religious message isn't
wrong -faith should not be a burden but a blessing, and his view on  the
corporate heads who finance films, who worship only money, is not
something that I entirely disagree with, I just don't see him as the one
delivering this message.

Reviewed by Dustin Putman, November 14, 1999.
At the opening of director Kevin Smith's latest opus, the 2-hour-plus 
"Dogma," there is a seemingly never-ending disclaimer (that turns into a 
hysterical joke) about how the following film should be taken as nothing more 
than a fantasy, and that religious groups (and movie critics) should take it 
as such. While "Dogma" is, in fact, obviously a fantasy with heavy religious 
themes concerning Catholicism, the main reason the disclaimer was tacked on 
was because this movie is, to put it simply, a long, rambling, intentionally 
corny train wreck of ideas and plot strands. If there had been no such 
disclaimer at the beginning, audience members would likely be booing at the 
screen five minutes in at its overall badness. On second thought, maybe being 
bad was half the point. I don't know why, but maybe.
Here's the rubbish (read: plot): Two fallen angels from Heaven, Loki (Matt 
Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck), plot to be relinquished of their sins and 
allowed back through the pearly gates by walking through the arch doorways of 
a church in New Jersey as it's being hallowed. Enter Bethany (Linda 
Fiorentino), a worker at an abortion clinic who has recently been struggling 
with her faith in God. Appearing before her in a ball of fire until she takes 
the fire extinguisher to him is another angel (Alan Rickman), who tells her 
that she has been chosen to travel to NJ and stop Loki and Bartleby, for if 
they step foot in the church, it could mean the end of civilization as we 
know it. Along to aid in Bethany's quest is the 13th black apostle Rufus 
(Chris Rock), the heavenly muse Serendipity (Salma Hayek), and, of course, 
Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith).
The first fifteen minutes of "Dogma" are its best; so entertaining and rich 
in energy that I questioned whether it would be able to stay at that level 
for a couple hours, which it ultimately does not do. Jumping off and running 
as a spoof in the "Airplane!"/"Naked Gun" tradition, the introduction to Loki 
and Bartleby is screamingly funny, particularly their run-in with a nun 
(played to the comic hilt by Betty Aberlin), whom they encourage should take 
the money she has collected in her cup and buy herself something nice. The 
intro to Bethany is equally inspired and appropriately wacky, especially in 
her late-night chat at a Mexican restaurant with the angel who hands her her 
mission. "Are we in Mexico?" Bethany asks when they magically appear there. 
His reply: "No, we're at the Mexican restaurant right down the street from 
your house." 
The proceedings in "Dogma" become shaky soon after, when Rufus literally 
falls from the sky and offers an extra hand in stopping the two angels, whom 
have recently gone on a killing spree of sinners as they travel to the NJ 
church. The tone of the picture changes gears here from being a crazy 
slapstick into simply being a cheesy, comedic hodgepodge, in which the 
majority of the jokes fall flat. While consonantly inventive, writer-director 
Smith's off-kilter mood quickly stops being particularly humorous and just 
grows overly tedious, with several particularly tough-to-endure dry patches, 
and a pointless interlude with a creature made of excrement.
While several of the conversations within the film are thought-provoking in 
their implications, "Dogma" is, otherwise, as light as a feather, with only 
the exciting, fresh cast keeping things afloat. Real-life friends Matt Damon 
and Ben Affleck, reuniting once again after 1997's "Good Will Hunting," have 
a chemistry on-screen that you rarely see, and their working together gives 
them an added spark. They are playing angels, however, so their performances 
stem from their philosophical, occasionally violent, personalities. Linda 
Fiorentino, in the central role, is the only thesp who remotely takes herself 
seriously, and her own internal struggles with her belief system is the most 
intriguing element of the whole film. And Salma Hayek, although having very 
little to do, is not only handed an amusing striptease scene, but also takes 
a stab at the comedy. Her best line: "I am the creator of 19 out of the 
top-20 highest-grossing movies of all time. You know the one with the boy at 
home by himself who had to stop those burglars and he put his hands on his 
face and went, 'Ahhh!'? Well, I don't know who made that crap." Annoying as 
can be is comedian Chris Rock; let's just say his jokes on racism are getting 
old very fast, and a little of Rock goes a long way.
Slightly too vulgar for its own good (Smith is head-over-heels in love with 
the F-word in every other line of dialogue, and it doesn't work well in the 
context of this film) and severely uneven on the screenplay level, "Dogma" is 
a petty little movie that can be pushed aside in the Kevin Smith collection, 
in hopes that next time he will make a movie more along the lines of his more 
biting 1994 "Clerks" or, his best film, 1997's phenomenal "Chasing Amy." 
Cameos by Alanis Morissette, as God, who turns out to have a goofy sense of 
humor, and Janeane Garofalo as Bethany's abortion clinic co-worker, are fun 
and, in the former's case, memorably funny, but what is the point of their 
appearances? "Dogma" is not supposed to be taken seriously, which is as it 
should be, but it's supposed to at least be worth the effort of going out and 
spending money to see it. It isn't.

        Hopefully, as Alan Rickman upholds in the movie, God does have a
sense of humor... for Kevin Smith's sake. The
writer-director basically upholds the faith, but in a very
unconventional way. Whether one could truly say his portrait of religion
puts it in a good light or not is really a personal opinion, but it's
clear he doesn't mind questioning his subject-- and what's
wrong with that?
        Smith makes films from the gut. He makes movies that he would
like to see and that's clear. This has paid off for him thus
far because he's pretty much an everyman and a lot of people want to see
the same things on the screen that he does. He
definitely has a strong instinct for filmmaking, but I'd far from call
it developed.
        I found this movie to be quite entertaining, but I couldn't
really say it was all that well made or even, for that matter, good.
None of the peices seemed to quite fit together right. His direction
lacks a lot, often giving in to cliche. I wouldn't even say it's
the classic Hollywood style, exactly, but a self-conscious pop version,
along the same lines as Tarantino. What lacks for Smith
is a definitive style to really set a tone and pace for his scenes and
the movie as a whole. Whereas Tarantino and so many of
pop-culturalist young directors rely on a melding of their writing and
directing for a unique style, Smith's writing comes almost
fully from his writing and it's as if the direction is merely an
afterthought. This is not to say that he is not a competent director,
but I'd venture to say he is not a confident one. I would love to see a
Smith-written script directed by another director who
could show just how much potential is there. Then maybe smith himself
would be able to find a way to mine his own material
for a little more depth.
        Again, as was the case with many in his first films, the
performances just aren't that great, and, in some cases, just
downright bad. I love Chris Rock [as a comic], but he just is not a good
actor. Salma Hayek was just a little better and Linda
Fiorentino had her moments, but none of the performances were really
anything to get excited about. Sure, they were able to
do well with some of the one-liners and other jokes, but that's hardly
acting. I wasn't really even impressed at all with Alan
Rickman, either. He just seemed too rehearsed. There was nothing at all
fresh about his performance. The only characters that
really seemed to meet their full potential were the unlikely prophets-
Jay and Silent Bob. Of course, their potential is to be
entertaining slackers- not a particularly hard task, but Smith and Jason
Mewes do it well. Damon and Affleck were decent
enough, but they didn't really seem to even be part of anything. For
some odd reason, it seemed like they were in a separate
movie than the rest of the cast [I really have no explanation for why I
thought this; I guess they were just out of place].
        As I said before, Smith's style comes almost completely from his
writing, which is steeped in pop-culture and slacker
references. He really has a pretty good story here. The problem is that
he seems unwilling to part with material. There were
jokes and gags that had no place in the film and only slowed or hindered
it. Something else I noticed in the film is that Smith has
his characters explain too much. It seemed so unnatural every time I
learned a new peice of backstory, etc. because it was
explained to death by the characters-- something that was actually made
into a joke itself in the film, but still would have been
better rectified.
        Kevin Smith knows entertainment, and I, for one, believe he also
knows good storytelling through good filmmaking. I just
don't think he realized his full potential yet. I'll probably see his
next film, and I expect it will be a step toward that.

Towards the end of Dogma, Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) gets to ask God a
simple, profound question:  "Why are we here?"  She doesn't get much of
an answer, really, which shouldn't be much of a surprise.  Most of the
great questions are unanswerable, whether they be "Why do bad things
happen to good people?" or "Why can't we all just get along?" or "Why
can't the Rangers score runs against the Yankees pitching staff in the
post-season?"
Dogma has an unanswerable question of its own:  "Why do good things
happen to bad movies?"
Dogma is a bad movie, no two ways about it.  It seems to be deliberately
designed to shock and offend as many people as possible (not that any of
the twentysomething slackers who made up the audience I went to seemed
to be shocked or offended by much of anything).  And it's not just the
anti-religious posturing, or the frenzied Catholic-bashing you've heard
so much about.  More than any other movie in recent memory, Dogma takes
unbridled glee in killing.  (Like Fight Club before it, Dogma seems
destined to spawn copycat incidences of violence.)  There's almost as
many laughs generated by scenes of mass bloodshed in Dogma as the Austin
Powers movies get out of potty humor.  (Not that there isn't potty humor
in Dogma, and of a particularly repulsive kind.)  The story, such as it
is, ambles on slowly to a predictable ending, slouching towards New
Jersey, if you will.  To top off the awfulness, Jason Mewes provides a
monumentally stupid appearance that seems destined to win a nomination
for this year's Fran Drescher Award for Most Annoying Performance.
(Jar-Jar Binks appears to have the trophy sewn up.)
And yet, just as Christian theology demands that we hate the sin but
love the sinner, it is possible to hate the horribly bad things about
Dogma and celebrate the good things, namely, five outstanding
performances out of Dogma's large ensemble cast.
Matt Damon and Ben Affleck appear here together for the first time since
they vaulted to fame, fortune, and Oscar success in Good Will Hunting.
Their performances here as fallen angels are nowhere near as good in
Dogma as they were in Good Will Hunting, but their friendship and easy
rapport with each other give life and sparkle to their comparatively
dull religious dialogue.  They've got an energy and verve that
counterbalances their purpose in the film -- which is, to kill a lot of
people for no good reason.  (One of the things about Dogma that will
cause many people offense is the way that it -- literally -- shoots the
"Touched by an Angel" stereotype of angels right in the head.)  Damon
and Affleck are a lot of fun together, and they seem to be having a lot
of fun, but one can't help hoping that they got together after filming
was done and got to work on their next screenplay.
The third and fourth remarkable performances are by Chris Rock and
George Carlin, two of our greatest comic geniuses.  Both, however, are
smart enough to keep their schtick marginally toned down here.  Carlin
has the smaller role as the Catholic bishop in charge of marketing the
Church to Generation X.  Rock has the showier part, as the 13th
Apostle.  They're both parts that could have been handled in a
completely over-the-top fashion, like so much of this movie.  But Carlin
and Rock both are able to just tone down their characters to fit the
satirical mode of the movie.  Rock, especially, is almost reflective and
gentle at times.  It's a side of him we don't get to see often enough.
And the fifth performance, for me, tips the Celestial Scales in Dogma's
favor.  Alan Rickman gives what may be my favorite performance of the
year as a sardonic angel.  From his first appearance as a pillar of fire
to the end of the movie, Rickman is a wry, sharp delight.  The script
wisely gives him huge chunks of the ridiculous exposition, which he
manages to leaven with a world-weary grace.  And when the time comes for
him to lay on the really bad news to Linda Fiorentino's human character,
he manages a surprising, almost heavenly tenderness.
Dogma will almost certainly offend many viewers and enrage still
others.  Catholics will be unhappiest, naturally.  Protestants (like
myself) will have less to complain about, but will still find some
scenes shocking.  (Jewish and Buddhist and Muslim folks will probably
leave the theater scratching their heads somewhat.)  But communicants of
the Church of Movies will be glad to find solace in the good work
displayed by most of the Dogma cast, which redeems much of the awfulness
that suffuses the movie.  In the end, to mix a religious metaphor, the
acting provides just enough karma to keep Dogma from getting run over by
the critics.  (Yes, I know it's a bad joke, but thank you for reading
this far anyway.)

Alex Ioshpe
Many things have been said about Kevin Smith's latest film and not
everything was good. This movie  has created more controversy than 'Fight
Club'. It has been cursed by the Vatican and dozens of hate letters were
sent to its creator. It truly is provocative, constantly on the edge, but
also wonderfully refreshing. This is one of the kind -- a magnificent black
comedy which is savagely funny and imaginatively philosophic. It is witty,
accurate, fast paced and possibly one of the best satires in the history of
the genre.
Starting with an apology that goes on for almost ten minutes, explaining to
the audience that all characters and events are fictions and are not ment to
be taken seriously, the story slowly takes shape.
Loki (Matt Damon) is an angel that got drunk and flicked off the Lord (among
others Alanis Morissette). Bartleby (Ben Affleck) is the co-conspirator who
indirectly got both himself, and Loki, permanently kicked out of Heaven for
Loki's infraction. Cardinal Glick (George Carlin) is the Catholic determined
to reinvigorate the Catholic church by eliminating sacred objects such as
Christ on the Crucifix, and replacing them with things such as Christ
winking, smiling and giving the "thumbs up" to fervent church-goers. In an
attempt to get people to give the "new and improved" Roman Catholic Church a
try, the Cardinal declares that anyone passing through the Church's doors
will be forgiven of all of their sins. This creates a loophole in church
dogma that will allow them to end their eternal exile in Wisconsin and
reenter the pearly gates of Heaven, sin-free. The problem is, if this
happens, God will be proven fallible, and all of existence will be erased.
With God having been put out of commission while on a holiday, the fate of
the world and all else rests with efforts of a ragtag bunch: Metatron (Alan
Rickman ), the angel who serves as the voice of God; Rufus (Chris Rock), the
bitter, heretofore unknown 13th Apostle; a heavenly Muse Serendipity (Salma
Hayek); a pair of familiar Prophets by the name Jay and Silent Bob (Jason
Mewes and Smith himself); and the reluctant key figure in thwarting the
renegade duo, Bethany (Linda Fiorentino), who has lost her faith in God,
when a heralding angel appears in her bedroom and declares her the last
descendant of Jesus and the potential savior of humanity. Of course there
are plenty of bad guys and nasty obstacles to get in the way of our heroes
and their attempt to save the past, present and future.
"Dogma" is never becomes boring or predictable. It is savagely funny with
its many humorous lines, such as the dialoge between the messanger of God
and Bethany:
Metatron: Moses was a drunk. Look what he accomplished. And no one's even
asking you to part an ocean. All you have to do is go to New Jersey
Metatron: Lonely. But funny. He's got a great sense of humor.
Or when the Muse is talking about her writing block:
Serendipity: Can you believe it? Me -- a muse, for God's sake! I sit down in
front of the typewriter, and what do I get? Nothing. Blank page. I can't
even write a grocery list.
Bethany: What about what you did with Jay and Silent Bob? You inspired them.
Serendipity: That's the cosmic joke. I can give out a zillion and nine ideas
a second, but I can't keep any for myself. Her [God's] quirky sense of
humor..
Between the humor and witty comparisons, lies a lot of intelligent and
thought provoking material. Smith is elegantly shifting from amusing comedy,
to intelligent drama, from sharp parody to creepy thriller. He plays with
religion, twisting and stretching it, posing it in another light. Sometimes
it feels like a humorous remake of Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's
Dream", where heavens open up and the divine creatures come down from Heaven
and Hell to play with us. There is no pompous dialogue and Charlton Heston
is not descending a mountain with a set of tablets in hand, however "Dogma"
manages to exhibit a deep knowledge of not only the bible, and also the
tenets of Christianity throughout the ages. And although that's what Vatican
is stating, the audience will not be discouraged by this film, loosing their
beliefs. There is a lot of symbolism in this movie, that is helping us
realize that there is a supreme power that watches over us. The purpose of
this film is not to provoke hatred and misbelief, but instead to gain faith
and maybe look at the question of religion from a broader perspective.
When it comes to the visual aspect of this film, it is flawless. A solid
cinematography and fast paced editing are framing the actors' impressive
preformances. The two friends, Damon and Affleck, repeat the success of
"Good Will Hunting" and are both a joy to watch. Alan Rickman and Chris Rock
are fabulous, and Linda Fiorentino convincing. So, basically this should be
a hit at the box office. But it's not just its provocative style and risky
premise that stops "Dogma" from a being a serious Oscar-contender. There are
some silly moments, when Smith goes a bit too far and the originality
transforms into stupidity. But, forgetting these minor flops (luckily there
are not many of them), this is a revalation. Some serious questions are
raised about Catholic dogma and organized religion in general. By virtue of
their definition and the fact that they're in regards to religion, these
questions would understandably upset religious groups. But what those
objectors fail to see that the questions raised, such as the dangerous
differences between "beliefs" and "ideas," are intelligent ones that would
only spring from the mind of someone who takes his or her faith seriously.
It is a hilarious, intriguing, intelligent, bizarre and daring experience
that is a spectacular analysis of human behavior, our needs, beliefs and
problems since the beginning of time. The angry reactions that have met
Smith, prove that he has managed to create an epic and should be taken as a
compliment. And remember my words: "Dogma" will gain the status of a cult
film in five years tops.

USA Release Dates: Dogma: Out & Sleepy Hollow: November 19, 1999
A copy of this review can be found at 
http://www.moviereviews.org/sleepy_hollow_and_dogma_-_reviews.htm
Sleepy Hollow and Dogma are two very different films dealing with death. 
Dogma is most effective because of its hilariously dark comedy and 
ensemble cast. Sleepy Hollow finds its success in a classic horror 
story, grizzly images and two remarkable performances. Both stand out as 
solid works with minimal faults and can consequently expect mid-range 
box office.
Dogma's Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck) are angels famous 
for Sodom and Gomorrah, Noah's Ark and several other acts of skilled 
labor. However, they have been ejected from heaven because of their sins 
on earth (not mass-murder, but quibbling with the Lord, consuming liquor 
and assorted others). They discover a loophole that may allow them back 
"home" when Cardinal Glick (George Carlin) decides to rededicate a New 
Jersey church as part of a newer, hipper Christianity called Catholicism 
Wow! (no mention of olestra is made). They fail to realize that their 
returning to heaven could trigger a small side affect: the end of all 
existence.
Sleepy Hollow's Headless Horseman (Christopher Walken in a deliciously 
chilling yet relatively small performance) is rejected from his grave 
because his head was severed from his body with his own sword and stolen 
shortly thereafter. He decapitates his victims and takes their heads to 
use in place of his own.
Dogma was condemned by The Church early on and consequently changed 
studios a few times before finally settling in at Lion's Gate. 
Director Kevin Smith makes light of this in his opening disclaimer which 
describes itself as "a statement made to save one's own ass" and 
includes a few below-the-belt shots at Disney, the original studio. 
Those without a sense of humor may have trouble dealing with a 
mass-shooting of company executives who make golden calves, a muse who 
strips for money because of writer's block and a pop singer, Alanis 
Morisette, playing the Big Guy (Gal?) in the sky.
Sleepy Hollow is a time revered horror story that has only been slightly 
modified for the film. Much of the light-fright is dependant on a 1799 
setting which provides candle-lit rooms, no automobiles and strong 
gothic elements.
The killing sprees in both films are highlighted by grizzly images and 
excessive amounts of blood. Whether a mass-slaughter at church or 
head-spitting tree is more disturbing, I leave up to you.
Washington Irving's classic tale, directed by horror master Tim 
Burton, is complemented by two key performances from Johnny Depp and 
Christina Ricci as Ichabod Crane and Katrina Van Tassel respectively. 
For Depp this is another dark role in the tradition of his title 
character in Edward Scissorhands and role in Nightmare on Elm Street. 
For Ricci this is an amalgamation of her career to date and testament to 
that fact that she is one of the most underrated actresses in Hollywood. 
The similarities to her classic portrayal of Wednesday Adams are 
obvious, but a closer look reveals that her character's love affair 
with Crane soon after her boyfriend's death show similarities to her 
role as Dee-Dee in The Opposite of Sex. The darker and more frightful 
elements can be compared to her part in the star-studded independent 
film Hurlyburly.
Dogma's cast is as endowed as Ricci's Hurlyburly. Affleck and Damon 
team up for the first time since their award winning Good Will Hunting. 
Other than the persistent use of the "F-word," the two films have little 
in common, showing how versatile the couple can be. George Carlin, a 
dignified legend in the world of stand-up comedy, gives a performance as 
funny as Walken's is frightful and equally sized (leading you to 
wonder how he got billing over Matt Damon, the film's co-star). Linda 
Florentino (of Men in Black fame) plays Bethany, the film's heroine 
who is sent to stop the rejected angels from entering the New Jersey 
church. She is a pleasure to watch and seems to be establishing herself 
as a solid actress. Other delights include Chris Rock reprising his 
traditional "'cause I'm black!" role, Selma Hayek as a much better 
muse than Sharon Stone, and the film's director, Kevin Smith, as 
Silent Bob the unknowing prophet.
Both films have faults, albeit minor ones. Dogma's audience is too 
busy laughing to put aside time for some meaningful and serious scenes 
towards the end. Sleepy Hollow has trouble developing its characters 
early and consequently you aren't sure of some victims' identity. 
But these are small flaws and in today's Hollywood both Dogma and 
Sleepy Hollow stand out as being well above average.

DOGMA (M).  
(New Line Cinema/Village Roadshow)
Director: Kevin Smith
Stars: Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Linda Fiorention, Chris Rock, Alan 
Rickman, Salma Hayek, Jason Lee, Kevin Smith, Jason Mewes, George Carlin,
Janeane Garofalo, Bud Cort, Alanis Morisette, Dwight Ewell, Jeff Anderson,
Barrett Hackney, Jared Pfenningwerth, Kitao Sakurai
Running time: 129 minutes.
Who would have thought the final apocalyptic battle between
the forces of good and evil for the future of the world would take
place in New Jersey, of all places?  Possibly only Kevin Smith
(Clerks, Chasing Amy, etc), the idiosyncratic writer/director who sets
all his off beat, low budget comedies in his beloved New Jersey.
In the past, Smith's films have offended many with their
misogynistic humour, their cynical take on relationships, and their
decidedly anti-authoritarian stance.  While Smith is obviously working
with a bigger budget here, Dogma is little different in style or
content from his earlier films.  However, Dogma is a far more
ambitious film, and finds Smith exploring more sophisticated themes
and ideas.  Smith deconstructs 2000 years of biblical mythology and
Catholic dogma, as well as tackling issues of mortality, faith, and
belief versus organised religion.  Among the more contentious ideas
offered up in Dogma are a female God (played with a curiously
childlike grace by rock singer Alanis Morisette), a black Jesus, and a
thirteenth, black apostle left out of the Bible for reasons of
political correctness.
In Dogma, hot young stars Matt Damon and Ben Affleck continue
the familiar best buddy schtick they have perfected through films like
Good Will Hunting, etc.  The pair play Loki and Bartleby, two vengeful
angels thrown out of heaven but anxious to return to the good graces
after centuries in exile.  They have now found a liturgical loophole
that will enable them to re-enter heaven.  However, if that happens,
it will somehow prove the fallibility of God and thus destroy
existence as we know it.
Tapped to prevent this cataclysmic event is Bethany (Linda
Fiorentino, from The Last Seduction, etc), a lapsed Catholic who runs
an abortion clinic in Pittsburgh.  Also along to help out is hyper
active, fast talking comic Chris Rock (Lethal Weapon 4, etc), who gets
some of the film's best lines as the very annoyed and ignored 13th
apostle Rufus.  The hapless duo of Silent Bob (played by Smith
himself) and Jay (Jason Mewes) have played gradually expanding roles
in each of Smith's films, and here the pair are given a major role to
play as they are mistaken for a couple of prophets mysteriously sent
to assist Bethany in her mission.
Dogma is very funny stuff, with plenty of great one liners,
Smith's irreverent, iconoclastic sense of humour, and the usual pop
culture references.  But Smith's penchant for clever writing often
leads to great long patches of dialogue and unnecessary
philosophising, that slow the film down to a crawl.  His fondness for
puerile scatological humour also surfaces, and while this base humour
may appeal to some in the audience it will not sit as comfortably with
others.
Fans of Smith's warped comic sensibility will find plenty to
enjoy in Dogma, while those who have never really appreciated him or
his films will find little here to redeem him in their eyes.

   Though some Catholics groups are tearing into this film,
considering it as scandalous as "Priest" and more so
than "Stigmata," "Dogma" is firmly pro-belief.  There is indeed
a God and there are angels and demons, according to writer-
director Kevin Smith.  Yet you can't discount the
apprehension that churchgoing Catholics and the Catholic
clergy feel about the ideas embraced by Smith in his fourth
film, which encompasses a grandiose theme you'd not expect
from a man whose previous works were contained in limited
spheres.  Those films include a $27,000 wonder about a day
in the life of a convenience store clerk and video palace bum
("Clerks"); a flop about a bunch of friends, largely geeks, who
hang around a suburban mall ("Mallrats"); and his best
feature, "Chasing Amy," about a comic book artist who meets
and falls for an attractive, personable female and pursues her
even when he discovers that she's gay.
   Like Rupert Wainwright, whose recent film "Stigmata" 
underscores the idea that "the kingdom of God is within you"
(thus discounting the need for showy Church rigmarole),
Kevin Smith in no way discounts the existence of God.  He
does, however, take aim against dogma, against absolute
convictions, and comically sends up the seriousness with
which religious institutions practice their creeds.  "God has a
sense of humor," he states in a written preamble to the
movie, "or how else to explain His creation of the platypus?" 
As one character in the story essentially holds, we should be
celebrating our religions, not treating them as a somber affair.
   Filmed in Cinemascope (though without a whole lot of
filmmaking style despite its special effects), "Dogma" opens
with a bang as three sinister-looking young hockey players
attack and beat an old man to a pulp as he watches the
ocean waves on a New Jersey boardwalk.  At the same time,
New Jersey Cardinal Glick (George Carlin) announces to a
small group of parishioners and reporters that he will put into
motion a campaign to help revive interest in the Church,
whose attendance has been steadily falling.  At this point
Smith offers the first of many sophomoric, flat-out unworkable
sight gags, as Glick unveils a statue of Jesus not in the
traditional posture of crucifixion, but with a wink, a thumbs-up,
and an arm extended to greet a following.  (Other crude
humor, some which could more than compete with the
vulgarities of Smith's "Mallrats," include an image of a man
reading Hustler magazine in his pew; a walking poop demon
which emerges from a toilet bowl and which represents the
waste products which have fallen from people who have been
crucified; a naked angel's falling from the heavens and
landing with a thud on a highway; and a talk between a hip
young woman and a nun in which the sister becomes
convinced she should get a man and have fun.
   The story centers on Bethany (Linda Fiorentino), a lapsed
Catholic working in an abortion clinic, who has been strangely
chosen by the angel Metatron (Alan Rickman) to save the
world from extinction.  Two cast-out angels, Bartleby (Ben
Affleck) and Loki (Matt Damon), exiled for a millennium to
Wisconsin, are eager to go back home to heaven.  They have
found a loophole that would enable them to do so.  They
need only walk through an arch in a small New Jersey church
and they'll be on their way, but since this loophole proves
God's fallibility, the world would be destroyed.  Obviously 
these angels must be stopped.
   Holy figures and demonic forms mix freely with human
beings in this wildly imaginative movie that uses Monty
Python grotesqueries, some crude and others divine; and a
barrage of one liners, mostly plastic but with some treasures.
Among the characters whose mission is redundant is Jason
Lee as the diabolical Azrael, who looks like Tom Wolfe when
sporting a large white hat but whose fiendish roots are
unclouded each time he removes his panama to reveal two
small horns.  Chris Rock gets to spout old-hat raillery such as
his insistence that though he is the 13th Apostle, he is
unmentioned in the New Testament because he is black,
while in a ten-second role a clerk at an intercity bus terminal
informs some ticketbuyers that all seats to New Jersey have
been sold for the day: "Never underestimate the power of the
Garden State."
   Just two performers stand out in this free-for-all whose
ultimate purport, "Belief is bad because it causes divisions
and warfare, while ideas are good because they are
changeable," is belied by an actual appearance from God
(Alanis Morissette).  One is Kevin Smith regular Jason
Mewes as the youthful, altogether dense young man who
takes the miracles he sees in stride, who gets to proposition
Bethany throughout the movie, asking whether she'd have
sex with him if she knew the world would end in five minutes. 
Though he spouts the f-word more than virtually any other
character in a non-Smith movie, each time he articulates the
term he draws laughs.  The other is Linda Fiorentino, so
remarkable in her role as a femme fatale in "The Last
Seduction," who does her best to cement a thoroughly
undisciplined bedlam as a woman who regains her faith after
discovering that she is a great-great-great-great-great
grandniece of Jesus Christ.  Perhaps the best scene in the
film, however, is one that does not involve the obvious use of
other-worldly forms.  When Bartleby and Loki invade a
corporate board room, they hilariously point out the
indiscretions of all but one well-heeled member of these film
studio suits--people who have profaned their trade for eons
by plying their films onto an altogether too undemanding
public, now condemned as well for making their families
miserable.
   What this meandering film needs is a good editor.  135
minutes of largely undisciplined muddle is too much to ask,
even of an audience perfectly willing to accept what some
would consider its blasphemous nature.  Kevin Smith needs
to reign in some of the effects he uses simply for generating
cheap laughs in favor of a more focused narrative.

The litmus test to whether you'll enjoy this movie
comes in the very first 15 minutes of the film.  An
eminent Cardinal of the Catholic Church is about to
unveil a marketing promotion to reinvigorate the
Church's waning attendance numbers.  Comedian George
Carlin plays the Cardinal.  He espouses the Church's
newest campaign, Catholicism Wow!  He points out that
people believe that the Church has lost its spark and
youthfulness.  This campaign intends to turn things
around.  To kick things off, he introduces the
Church's newest sacred image called Buddy Christ.  The
current holy but wholly depressing icon of Jesus
hanging from the cross gives the people the 'willies,'
as he puts it.  This updated, friendlier
representation has Jesus winking, giving a warm smile,
and displaying a Roger Ebert-like thumbs-up.  As
another component of his campaign, he designates the
entrance to his church as a mechanism of forgiveness. 
Simply pass through the arch, and all of your sins
will be forgotten.
This blessed arch is big news for two fallen angels,
Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck).  These
two were responsible for the destruction of Sodom and
Gomorra, which understandably incurred God's wrath. 
Exiled to Wisconsin, they have long-awaited their
chance to reenter paradise, and this new loophole in
Church dogma may just be their ticket.  The
consequence, however, is that we'll all be blinked out
of existence.  A celestial war is about to ensue, but
it is a human that will be needed to save us all. 
Bethany (feisty Linda Fiorentino) is selected for this
holy crusade.  She is visited by the 'voice of God'
(Alan Rickman) who asks her for her help.  Here's
another wacky moment.  He appears as a column of flame
(a la Burning Bush) in her bedroom.  She is not awed
by this presence, and instead, reaches for the fire
extinguisher.
She grudgingly accepts this bizarre mission.  Along
the way, she meets up with a host of celestial good
guys who want to help Bethany.  These include two
prophets, very foul-mouthed Jay (Jason Mewes) and
Silent Bob (Bob Smith); a muse-turned-stripper (Salma
Hayek); and Rufus, the 13th Apostle (Chris Rock, who
actually curses less than Jason Mewes).  Celestial bad
guys want to stop Bethany, led by Azrael (Jason Lee). 
He welcomes the end of existence and promises to help
Loki and Bartelby reenter paradise.
What detracts from an otherwise clever film is the
second act.  Story lines begin to splinter and it
isn't exactly clear who is trying to accomplish what
and for what reasons.  As the impending apocalyptic
events are about to unfold, explanations are given so
quickly that I felt that I needed to rewind the film
again in order to really understand what was taking
place.  Gratuitous violence begins to overshadow the
tone that has been established, and that made the film
seem unbalanced.
Still, I was able to get by the 15-minute litmus test,
and laughed at this satirically good-natured film.  In
part, I enjoyed Fiorentino's steady performance and
appreciated the unconventionality of this movie,
including Rufus's explanation of why no one has ever
heard of the 13th apostle.  And, if you can stay the
course, it would be no surprise that Jesus might
actually be black or that God was a woman (and they
might have been because I wasn't here 2000 years ago).
 Beneath the obscenities, there is intelligent
commentary about the belief structures in place within
Church doctrine.  I don't think it blasphemous of me
to say that Director Kevin Smith has certainly taken a
leap of faith with a film that has some genuinely
clever ideas.

DOGMA *** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (bill@filmfreakcentral.net)
starring Linda Fiorentino, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Chris Rock
written and directed by Kevin Smith
Linda Fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded
turn in the cable pic The Last Seduction, and her being cast as
Dogma's lead is nothing short of inexplicable. She's still in fine
form as Bethany, an abortion clinic worker who's lost her faith. One
night, a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in Bethany's
bedroom. He is Metatron (Alan Rickman), the voice of God, and he needs
her help: she must stop two fallen angels from entering a New Jersey
church-the fate of the universe depends on it. God would do it
Him/Herself, but He/She is...missing, having taken up human form
somewhere on Earth never to be heard from again.
Bethany is joined on her road trip to the Garden State by the
"prophets" Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith, doing
double-duty), the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of
Smith's films thus far. At some point, Rock drops naked out of the sky
as Rufus, the undocumented (and very black) "thirteenth apostle", and
offers his assistance, as does divine stripper Serendipity (Salma
Hayek). It's a wild ride.
They're in pursuit of Loki and Bartleby (Damon and Affleck,
respectively-this is probably the sharpest either has ever been), who
were banished from heaven to Wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic
loophole that will enable their return. Loki decides to wreak havoc
along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the
pearly gates. At one point, he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits
with an angry combination of words and bullets. It's a nasty, guiltily
enjoyable little scene that asks, "How corrupt are you?".
Wings of Desire this ain't.
Since debuting with Clerks, Smith has grown as a director,
particularly in terms of working with actors. (Chris Rock is this
film's only weak link-between jokes, he's wooden.) His no-frills
visual style hasn't changed much over the years, though (Dogma's
widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations), nor
has his writing-his characters still sit around delivering one
caustic, hilarious speech after another. Dogma chips
away at big religious issues-namely, the hypocrisy that accompanies
any organized system of beliefs-eloquently and articulately, but a few
of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition. As well, the
verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever.
Any movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time
maintaining momentum (Hurlyburly, anyone?), and eventually Dogma's
pacing goes slack. A long diatribe from Bartleby late in the game, in
which he laments the destiny of celestial beings, comes at a point
when we've heard enough. Because his change of heart (Bartleby is
initially the good cop to Loki's bad) drives the climax, said rant is
given a great deal of screen time. Sure, Affleck deserved a big moment
(Damon steals their scenes together prior), but it ultimately makes
the film and us feel bloated.
Like Tarantino, Smith was a video-age sponge who became a sample-mad
indie filmmaker. Dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch
of movies, including Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, with Silent
Bob doing his best Harrison Ford, and Weird Science-a shit demon
attacks our heroes! Smith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour: his
dexterous maneuvering between the satirical (a Cardinal played by
George Carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan
"Catholicism Wow!") and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of
comedy will leave Dogma feeling malnourished. I bust(ed?) a gut on
several occasions. Proceedings also get off on the right foot with the
opening with the funniest disclaimer ever.
It's a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease, for to read it,
one actually has to see Dogma. The prerelease ballyhoo is in the
tradition of The Last Temptation of Christ's, Martin Scorsese's
1988 adaptation of Nikos Kazantzakis' controversial novel, in that it
is not directly linked to the picture's content but to rumours and
heresy. There's a famous anecdote about Fletch director Michael
Ritchie inviting picketers of The Last Temptation of Christ into a
screening on his dime, just so they could know for certain what they
were rallying against. (Not one of them had watched it.) Every single
person refused.
Smith and Scorsese have a lot in common, and so do the two films in
question, because both Smith's Bethany and Scorsese's Jesus are hollow
shells without their faith. In fact, Dogma's denouement (which follows
a thrilling showdown that's worth the wait) is a Catholic love-in, a
veritable recruitment poster. (I felt sentimental about a religion I
don't belong to. Now that's powerful filmmaking.) Smith is nothing if
not sincere about his own devotion to God, and that spirituality
shines through. It's enough to make me forgive Dogma for its editorial
sins.
My religion is movies. When the Catholic League beats on Dogma
for imaginary crimes against a doctrine, in a roundabout way they're
attacking what I live for: freedom of expression through celluloid. I
therefore feel that, although I'm no Bible-thumper, I'm at least as
qualified to criticize Dogma as William Donohue and his followers.

DOGMA (1999)
Grade: C
Director: Kevin Smith
Screenplay: Kevin Smith
Starring: Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Linda Fiorentino, Jason Mewes, Chris Rock,
Salma Hayek, George Carlin, Jason Lee, Alan Rickman, Kevin Smith, Alanis
Morissette, Janeane Garofalo
 
"You know, pregnant women can have sex up until their third trimester," one of
the holy prophets so eloquently points out just as this bloated flick ambles to
its bloated finale. The prophet is played by perennial Kevin Smith stoner,
Jason Mewes, who utters all his dialogue in witless colloquialisms. Mewes
reminds me of the members of Howard Stern's Wack Pack: The radio host regularly
invites individuals with peculiar speech impediments to invoke scripted lines
on his show. Their is the stutterer who harasses celebrities with queries like,
"A-a-a-are you s-s-still in sh-showbizness?", the Woody Allen soundalike made
to say...well you can imagine. Mewes is a comparative performer, a one-noter
who delivers all his lines (no matter what they are) in a similarly loopy,
zonked out, phonation.
Admittedly, I did laugh at Mewes' stoned-beyond repair schtick in Smith's
earlier works, but this act has not aged well. Must this dimwit be in every
Kevin Smith movie? To call him one-dimensional would be rather complimentary.
Smith's insistence on sticking with the character smacks of insecurity with his
new material. That being DOGMA, a religious comic fantasy, in which Smith
sprinkles his philosophies regarding organized religion and Catholicism amid a
flurry of dick jokes.
Matt Damon and Ben Affleck play two fallen angels, whom we first encounter in
an airport discussing a loophole in Catholic Dogma that could possibly get them
back into heaven. Damon and Affleck both posses an affable charm that suites
the blandly attractive stars well. They play their roles like a couple of frat
boys presuming to emulate religious entities.
British thespian Alan Rickman is a good angel on a mission to obstruct the evil
frat boy angels, who will unknowingly negate our existence if they succeed in
their plan. He approaches a lapsed catholic, abortion clinic employee (sorry
for being so verbose, I just couldn't resist putting the words "abortion" and
"catholic" in the same description), Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) to aid him in
the crusade. Bethany's character is later related more relevantly, but I won't
give that away. She sets out on an adventure with two "prophets" (Jay and
Silent Bob), and a black apostle, Rufas (Chris Rock), who falls out of the sky
bare-ass naked.
As Smith uses his story to jump back and forth between both predicaments, he
manipulates his characters as vessels in which to voice his own (presumably)
religious ideologies. Whenever this occurs (and it does frequently) the flick
falls into preachy didacticism; the proceedings are halted for Professor Smith
to give us a little lesson.
We do get some of Smith's trademark raucous humor, but delivered without the
panache that is desperately needed. Smith knows that comedy is about
unexpectedly juxtaposing incongruities, unfortunately, here, he doesn't seem to
realize that timing is equally important.
Also problematic is his severely dull directing "style". The director has yet
to become aware of film as a visual medium. Nor is he conscious of how to
properly position his actors in front of the camera. The frame is constantly
cluttered, as if everyone had fallen into place. Smith has never been a great
director, but this was less than noticeable in low budget movies about impudent
clerks or slackers passing the time in a mall.
With DOGMA, Smith has switched genres. He's making an adventure. One that is
without action or movement, a stagnant talkfest with lessons! This wouldn't be
so bad if he were able to elicit more laughs from his cast. Oddly enough, most
of the actors seem rushed, and unsure of the material they are proclaiming.
Rickman speaks so rapidly we miss many of his punch lines. Mewes doesn't seem
to be aware of where his punch lines are. It's as if everyone were in a hurry
to get to the conclusion. Though that's doubtful; the conclusion is easily
DOGMA's weakest, most incoherent sequence.
Damon and Affleck give the most seasoned performances, at least early on. Damon
plays the more pugnacious of the two, an angel of death who gets off on taking
out his wrath on the not so innocent. Affleck plays good angel to Damon's bad
angel. Constantly fretting over Damon's irate jabbering, Affleck's hang dog mug
and Caesar hair cut conjures up that of an emasculated puppy. Watching the two
riff off each other is the movies prime regalement. I kept envisioning a much
better DOGMA, one that focused solely on these rascally fellows.
Suddenly, without warning their dynamic is incongruously switched. Following an
embarrassingly staged brawl aboard a train, Affleck's character is altered from
puppy dog to bull dog. He has an epiphany, turns certifiable and regenerates as
his own angel of death. The switch is completely out of character, and
pointless; there is no pay off.
As for the other actors, never have I seen such a talented group do more
execrable work. The usually deft, husky voiced Fiorentino is laughably miscast;
like Demi Moore in STRIPTEASE, she doesn't seem to be aware that she's acting
in a comedy.
Chris Rock is adept at handling the one liners (when asked if he knew Jesus,
Rock delivers the best line; "Knew him? Nigger owes me $12 bucks!"), but unable
to inject anything in the corny You-can-do-it speeches he ladles on Bethany.
Jason Lee, another Smith regular, overacts his demonic role, aggrandizing each
line. He's like a child, playing demon, but never becoming the malevolent
figure he's ostensibly aiming for.
Other appearances include Salma Hayek (as a stripper who never strips yet
somehow manages to pull in large quantities of dough), comedian George Carlin
(as a gravel voiced priest), a mute Alanis Morisette, and Janeane Garafolo in a
cameo too tiny to even comment on.
The disjointed performances puzzled me more than anything. Where these talented
thesps so mis-directed as to act as if they were appearing in a lousy high
school play, not a major motion picture?
I like Smith's other films. I even believe his much-maligned MALLRATS has some
merits, but his talents are beginning to seem increasingly limited. The
slacker\stoner whimsy that imbued the Jersey Trilogy (CLERKS, MALLRATS, CHASING
AMY), with contemporary mid-90's immaturity (albeit wily immaturity) has grown
tiresome.
And I didn't even mention the shit monster. . .

*DOGMA* (rated R, 125 minutes, Lions Gate Films)- "Dogma", the most
ambitious and highly anticipated film from comic auteur Kevin Smith
("Clerks", "Chasing Amy"), opens with a disclaimer.  It states that the
film, which puts a satirical spin on Catholicism, is not meant to be taken
seriously.  The disclaimer, which was recently added after many pointless
protests and death threats from Catholic radicals, contradicts what I think
Smith was trying to accomplish.  "Dogma" is more about faith than it is
about blasphemy, but how can anyone realize that if they don't take the film
seriously?  
The convoluted plot of "Dogma" involves an abortionist (Linda Fiorentino)
who finds out that she is the only remaining descendant of Jesus.  Along
with Smith regulars Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Smith himself), she
must save the world from two bad-boy angels (Matt Damon and Ben Affleck) who
plan to pass through the arches of a New Jersey church and thus negate all
existence.  Along for the wild ride are George Carlin, Salma Hayek, Jason
Lee, Alan Rickman, Chris Rock, Janeane Garofalo, who play some of the most
quirkily conceived characters I've ever seen (and yes, Alanis Morrisette
plays God).  
Once you get over just how funny "Dogma" is (it provides as many laughs as
I've had this year), you may realize that just about everything else about
the production is flawed.  Linda Fiorentino doesn't make a competent lead as
Bethany, and the Affleck/Damon pairing adds up to no more than a
distraction.  Kevin Smith wrote "Dogma" before his "Jersey Trilogy" and it
shows.  Smith, who mixes toilet humor with profound existential statements,
takes a step back into adolescence with this flick.  When compared with the
simplicity of "Clerks", or the unexpected poignance of "Chasing Amy", the
overly ambitious and overlong "Dogma" just doesn't cut it.  
It takes a couple viewings to really cut deep into "Dogma", and to realize
that its biggest surprise is an emotionally hollow center.  On the surface,
there's too much going on to absorb in one viewing, but deeper down there's
not enough emotion to fill even half of that.  In the end, "Dogma" doesn't
tell us much about the nature of belief (besides the opinion that
African-Americans are underutilized in the Bible), and the flat, cartoony
result is more like Kevin Smith's beloved pastime; a comic book.  After
watching this hilarious but overblown mess, I wanted to see something as
different as possible.  I wanted to see a Kevin Smith movie.  (now in
theatres)

     Kevin Smith's DOGMA is offensive. Devotees of film industry
scuttlebutt probably know that Miramax, DOGMA's original distributor, put
the film on the auction block after religious groups started turning up
the heat. Catholic organizations in particular declaimed the film's
subject matter, many proclaiming it sacrilegious sight unseen ("I don't
need to swim in a sewer to know it stinks," went one typical slice of
logic). It won't surprise any of those folks when I say DOGMA is 
offensive. And I'm not even talking about the theological content. DOGMA
should be offensive to anyone who expects more from a movie than two hours
of a filmmaker's musings on every religious notion that ever came into his
head.
     Those musings are linked -- rather tenuously -- to a plot involving
the very fate of existence itself. It seems two outcast angels -- Loki
(Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck) -- have found a loophole involving
the Catholic dogma of plenary indulgence, through which they plan to
re-enter heaven. Circumventing God's will would, however, result in the
end of all creation, so a human agent is summoned to thwart the angels'
plans. That human is Bethany Sloan (Linda Fiorentino), a Catholic of
questionable faith and even more questions about her mission. Accompanied
by several celestial assistants -- including unknown 13th apostle Rufus
(Chris Rock) and the muse Serendipity (Salma Hayek) -- and two very
earth-bound assistants -- Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin
Smith) -- Bethany tries to save the universe between lengthy
conversations.
     And oh boy, are there plenty of lengthy conversations. Smith's
eternity-threatening premise is probably meant to distract from an
otherwise non-stop series of metaphysical/scriptural/doctrinal discussions
on everything from the nature of God to religious intolerance. It doesn't.
DOGMA is an incredibly long sit, a deep-n-profound dorm room debate of a
movie without the benefit of cold pizza and beer. Sometimes Smith is
simply snarky (a deconstruction of "The Walrus and the Carpenter" as a
critique of organized religion), in which cases he often churns out
genuine laughs. Sometimes Smith is serious (Bartleby's rant against God's
unfair preferential treatment of humans over angels), in which cases he's
alternately perceptive and tedious. And sometimes Smith cops an attitude
(Loki's swift judgment on a corporate boardroom), in which cases you want
to remind him that anyone who gives Jay and Silent Bob major roles in a
film should look at the plank in his own eye before going after the mote
in anyone else's.
     When Smith actually does get into the events of his plot, things
don't get much better. Smith has always been a filmmaker only in the most
nominal sense, but his limitations are even more evident when he makes a
half-hearted effort to add supernatural action to the mix (radically
shifting the tone from comedy to grim violence along the way). In a way,
the low-tech fight sequences have their charms; battles always seem to
occur just outside the frame, and people come flying through the air from
improbable directions. It's hard to cut Smith that much slack, though,
because you can't help but think his choices are based entirely on his
limited visual vocabulary. He'll point a camera at people sitting around a
table as long as you'll let him. Ask him to throw in one piece of real
action for our efforts, and he turns into Captain Coy.
     I suppose the most frustrating thing about DOGMA is that, whatever
your feelings about its messages, Kevin Smith is the wrong messenger. It's
not that his insights aren't insightful -- he has some interesting things
to say about faith, religions and self-righteousness -- but that he's
pitching his weighty notions in such a scattershot fashion. LIFE OF BRIAN
could get away with borderine sacrilege because Monty Python played it
smart and scathing; DOGMA may be a sincere expression of belief, but it's
too juvenile too often. Smith opens the film with a disclaimer that the
film is only meant to be a satire, then includes a comment to the effect
that "God must have a sense of humor ... look at the platypus." You simply
_must_ do better than that if you want to turn sacred cows into fajitas. I
hope Smith feels better about religion after venting his spleen into a
feature film. Losing two hours to deep thoughts wrapped in limp jokes --
now _that_ I find offensive.

This one was a tuffy; I've stewed over it for a couple of days, trying to
keep the Objective Reviewer side of me separate from my
unsure-how-it-all-works Spiritual side, in order to rate this flick solely
on its merits on celluloid [knowing what I knew about this flick
beforehand, I made sure the non-objective side of me was anesthetized
before I entered the theater.  She's still asleep...shhh...]  For the most
part, I've succeeded--that actually wasn't the hard part--but it occurs to
me that in excising my (lack of?) faith from the picture, I may have
played right into writer/director Kevin Smith's dastardly plans. 
The Story (WARNING: EXTENSIVE spoilers contained below):
In this mostly-unfunny comedy, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (respectively)
play Loki and Bartleby, AWA (Angels With Attitudes).  They have Issues
with the Big G because, as Old Testament angels, they were cast out of
heaven for going against God's will (Loki was the Angel Of Death, and
Bartleby tried to get him to chill one day.  Big no-no, it seems; the Old
Testament God wasn't havin' it).  Banished to Wisconsin until the end of
the world, they hear about a loophole: in an effort to get parishoners
back in church, Cardinal Glick (George Carlin) invokes a dogmatic rule
that would wipe the slate clean for any and all sinners who pass through
the arch of his New Jersey church--and because the dogma of The Church is
considered canon, Loki and Bartleby reason that what's good for mortals is
good for angels, too.
Meanwhile, on the other side of town...Metatron, the embodiment of the
Voice Of God (Alan Rickman) contacts Bethany (Linda Fiorentino), an
abortion clinic worker with religious Issues of her own, and enlists her
to stop the angels from going through the arch.  In classic Road Movie
form, she meets a series of folks on the way: Jay and Silent Bob (Jason
Mewes and Kevin Smith), who she sees as the Prophets Metatron predicted,
but who see her as an potentially great lay; Rufus (Chris Rock), the 13th
Disciple who insists that he was left out of the bible because he was the
only Black Disciple; Serendipity (Salma Hayek), a Muse who somehow ended
up in a strip club; and on the side of Evil, Azrael and the Stygian
Triplets (Jason Lee; Barret Hackney, Jared Pfennigwerth and Kitao
Sakurai), Lucifer's henchmen and do-ers of bad deeds, such as beating Bud
Cort's character, old man John Doe Jersey [ooh, such a clever name] into a
coma.
The Upshot:
Ok, let's get this out of the way now: "Dogma", to my understanding of the
meaning of the word, is blasphemous.  Anyone who's seen the movie (and
that's an important qualifier, folks) and came away with a different
conclusion, is either in straight-up denial, is an atheist, or simply has
a different dictionary than me.  With scenes like the one where an angel
swears profusively at a nun, it won't ever be seen the Pax Network, that's
for sure.  I say again: "Dogma", to my understanding of the meaning of the
word, is blasphemous.  But here's the kicker: the blasphemy is directed
not at religion (that is, the faith of the believer) but at Religion (that
is, The Organization Known As "The Church").  Specifically, Religion in
the form of the Catholic Church (which, in my youth, I called
"stand-up-sit-down-stand-up-kneel").  And as someone who's had Issues with
The Church (specifically, The Baptist Church, aka "The Fashion Show". But
that's another rant for another time.), I Feel him.  For now, I'll leave
it at this: my lasting impression of the film is that Smith, as expressed
through Affleck's Bartleby, is indeed a religious man (or at least, like
some of us, has spiritual leanings that aren't quite fully realized), and
that his anger at The Church would be dissipated if The Church's rules
would have less impact than The Golden Rule.  And again, I most def Feel
that.
That aside, my feelings about the movie as a movie (versus the movie as a
Statement) are a lot less forgiving.  I was irritated at "Dogma" far too
often to recommend it unconditionally (case in point: you'd have to
totally drop your suspension of disbelief that God wouldn't be hip to what
Loki and Bartleby were up to; and worse was the "explanation" of why that
was, which, like a greek tragedy's Deus Ex Machina, magically made itself
known at the end of the flick); and worse were some of the
characterizations by actors who seem to have called in their parts. 
Amongst the sinners are Carlin's Cardinal (which, given his recent HBO
special where he totally thrashes The Church, makes his particular sin
unforgivable), Rickman (the actor must've imbibed the tequila that his
Metatron character kept spitting out; certainly, his Bad Guy in "Die Hard"
was much more convincing), Lee (a hammy devilette with horns...gimme a
break.  What, they couldn't get Jim Carrey?) and especially Fiorentino,
totally unbelievable in what should've been a key role; she damn near put
me to sleep with her bored-stiff acting.  And let's not forget the
(Smith's words, not mine, folks) "Shit Demon".  Actually, let's. 
But by far, the brunt of the blame goes to Damon and Affleck (and, of
course, Smith's pen).  Damon's Loki was just way too out-there, cussin'
for cussin's sake [and you'll remember, dear reader, that I had the same
Issue with Cuba Gooding Jr. in the crime-against-humanity, "Chill
Factor".]  Unique unto himself--and rather scary--at first, I had to
remind myself that Loki was after all, the Angel Of Death.  And Damon
played that to a T, initially; the Mooby scene was a little over-the-top,
but I daresay the folks at Disney probably turned a whiter shade of pale
after seeing it.  Affleck, too, played Bartleby rather nicely to begin
with; his Good Cop to Loki's Bad Cop, worked for awhile.  But then, it all
came tumbling down after the train scene; suddenly, they both got an
epiphany, and inexplicably (especially as far as Loki is concerned)
switched characterizations--and ruined any chances of redeeming the movie
from there forward.  And to top it off, the closing scene was corny and
hokey, as if Smith ran out of shock-value stuff to toss at the viewer,
yielding to conventionality at the end.   
There were, however, bright spots in the most unexpected of places.  Chris
Rock, as usual, was the funniest thing in the movie (though I had a Chris
Issue which I'll get to later); Salma Hayek, after her "Wild Wild West"
fiasco, totally surprised me by being pretty durn good here, certainly
measurably better than Fiorentino; Kevin Smith (yes, *that* Kevin Smith),
for being Silent as Bob, was amusingly expressive; and Jason Mewes...man. 
His wacked-out Jay was simply a trip.  Once I got over the shock of his
behavior, I kinda dug him.
In the end, I had a love/hate relationship with "Dogma"; I was mad at it
for not being what it could've been, but appreciated it for what it was. 
Even if I didn't always agree with it.
The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]
Chris Rock is, some might say, the reigning king of topical Black comedy. 
I don't know from all that, but of all the young Black turk comics on the
scene, he most def made a good choice as Rufus, the forgotten Disciple. 
At turns funny and thoughtful, I was With his character all the way up to
one point: the point when he called Jesus "that nigga".  Religious issues
aside, those words coming out of the same mouth that, in his HBO comedy
special "Bigger and Blacker", said "I love Black Folks...but I hate
'niggas'", was just too incongruous to me.  Yes, I know that those words
actually started from the writer's hands and not from Chris' lips, but
still.
Bammer's Bottom Line:
I'm still somewhat at odds with myself over how I feel "Dogma", at least
from the standpoint of a mostly-objective movie viewer.  I know full well
what the folks involved in it were trying to do, but in all their
eagerness to be Bold! And! Controversial!--while at the same time stay
user-friendly (read: not alienating the target box-office demographic) by
going for the funny bone (and missing), they left something to be desired
in the execution.  Still, you gotta give Smith & Crew an attaboy for
having the nads to at least give it ye olde college try.
The bottom Bottom Line? "Dogma" gets my greenlight rating if only because
I feel compelled to see it again, flaws n' all.
"Dogma" (rating: greenlight) 
The Spirit was willing, but the Flesh was weak, yes; but it had Teeth,
which is more than most mainstream flicks have going for them.

Please note that I have written this review with a great strain on my
objectivity. You see, besides Quentin Tarantino, there has been no greater
writing influence in my life than Kevin Smith, the director of this film. I
say this because I do not want you to think that I am pretending to forget
or put aside my grand respect for the man, because I couldn't do that even
if I tried. In fact, besides being a great writer/director, I simply believe
him to be an upstanding human being as well. Okay, now that you know my
dirty little secret, let's see what I have to say...
PLOT:
Two renegade angels attempt to get back into Heaven through a loophole that
they find at a church in New Jersey. A woman who works at an abortion clinic
is chosen by the voice of God to stop these men, along with the help of two
"modern" prophets, the 13th unknown apostle and a muse/stripper, before the
angels cross the threshold and lead to the end of all human existence.
Simple enough?
CRITIQUE:
Ambitious, original, funny film about a bunch of religious figures pasted
into a modern fantastical world environment with a lot of tedious
theological speak and a lot of "dick and fart" jokes (as Kevin would say).
It's hard to say who this type of movie is going to attract, since the
young, non-religious hipsters (okay, I'm not so young but I still consider
myself part of this group) will probably not appreciate all of the religious
points made in this film, and the older, religious non-hipsters will
probably not appreciate any of the more juvenile humor, which I thought was
hilarious. Maybe the older, non-religious, hipsters or the younger,
religious, non-hipsters? Either way, I personally enjoyed it for most of
what it represented which was an alternative point of view on religion,
Catholicism in particular, and the unrelenting humor written by Smith for
his Jason Mewes and Chris Rock characters. Jay simply rocked! I could
honestly say that if Silent Bob and Jay were not in this movie, I might be
hard pressed to recommend it so highly.
One thing that you have to know going into this film is that it is a
fantasy. A modern-day comedic fantasy, but a fantasy nonetheless. On the
whole, most of the mythical elements seemed to meche flawlessly within the
modern-day environment, but others just appeared too fake for me to get
around, like the wings on the angels and the horns on Jason Lee. Also, as
much as I tried I could not help but think "that's singer Alanis Morissette"
when God made her first appearance. I just couldn't help it! The more I
tried not to think about it, the more I did. Isn't it ironic? Anyway, I
recommend this film under the two main conditions that I liked it which were
the overall story, which was interesting, and the humor-laced script which
was peppered with particularly great lines for Jay and Rock. I thought the
Affleck, Damon and Rickman characters were a little too drowned in their
explanatory religo-babble (a 20-minute trim-job might've helped), and Hayek
distracting (well, in some good ways but also in some bad), but overall, the
film was original, funny and certainly inventive.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
A convention premiere of DOGMA in Atlanta during the first week of November
1999, provided some more insights into the man better known as Kevin Smith.
1) Kevin claimed that he only wants to direct ten films in total and that he
only has three ideas for future films ready now, so it might turn out to be
only seven. The one idea that he did mention was an adaptation of Mage
(comic book).
2) Kevin said that Jay and Silent Bob would probably be in one more film and
then would only appear in the comics and the Clerks Animated Series.
3) He also explained that one of the major problems that he had with
Superman producer Jon Peters while he was still attached to the project was
that Peters wanted Braniac to have a "gay" robot sidekick (similar to C3Po).
He even wanted the black guy from CHASING AMY to do the voice.
4) Other than Ben Affleck, Chris Rock and Matt Damon, Smith said he would
not try and get big name actors for his movies.
5) He said that the reason Jeff Anderson (Randall from CLERKS) wasn't in
MALLRATS or CHASING AMY was that Anderson had a falling out with Smith over
some money from CLERKS. The good news is that Anderson does have a small
role in DOGMA as the gun store clerk. Note that Brian O'Halloran (Dante from
CLERKS) also has a small role in DOGMA as the reporter.
Kevin Smith wrote the DOGMA script before he had ever written his first
flick, CLERKS, but shelved it because he wanted to do it with the proper
special effects.
British actress Emma Thompson was originally slated to play the part of God
but pulled out before filming began in order to have a baby.
As usual, dozens of other movie references show up in the film (too many to
enumerate here, but I'm sure they'll show up on many a Kevin Smith fan page
over the next few weeks), but at least five John Hughes films were referred
to directly in this film. Smith has always said that he "grew up" on John
Hughes comedies and admires them.
Smith got married to reporter Jennifer Schwalbach in 1999 and had a daughter
soon thereafter. The child was named Harley Quinn (also the name of a
character in TV's "Batman: The Animated Series").
This should also go without saying but Kevin owns his own comic book store,
"Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash" in Red Bank, New Jersey. He had
apparently sold his comic book collection for money to film CLERKS (which
cost about $27,000), but bought it all back once the film became a huge
success.
The "guy on the bus" character is played by none other than producer Scott
Mosier.

Christian Critic's Movie Parables - http://www.christiancritic.com
DIRECTED BY:      Kevin Smith
STARRING:         Linda Fiorentino, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Jason Mewes,
Chris Rock, Alan Rickman, Salma Hayek, Kevin Smith
WRITTEN BY:       Kevin Smith
RATED:            R for strong language including sex-related dialogue,
violence, crude humor, and some drug content.
SCRIPTURE
REFERENCES:       Mark 7:6-7, 1 Timothy 4:1-3, 1 Thessalonians 2:13
To paraphrase FORREST GUMP, "Dangerous is as dangerous does."  Contrary
to the prescreening buzz, the new Kevin Smith film, DOGMA, is not a danger
to our spiritual well-being.  It may be, at various times, brilliant,
boring, misguided, insightful, or offensive.  But dangerous?  No.  What it
asks us, in its irreverently humorous fashion, is to take a hard look at
our religious institutions and check whether we can still see God there.
If this is considered to be threatening to those institutions, perhaps an
introspective look is long overdue.
The film does levy a number of charges against organized religion,
specifically Roman Catholicism, calling it a place where people don't
celebrate their faith, they mourn it, treating God as more of a burden
than a blessing.
Ben Affleck (FORCES OF NATURE) and Matt Damon (GOOD WILL HUNTING) are a
pair of fallen angels, banished to Wisconsin for having the effrontery to
question God.  A public relations campaign (Catholicism Wow!) headed by
Cardinal Glick (George Carlin, BILL & TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE) has given
them an opportunity to take advantage of a "loophole" in God's edict, and
make their way back into heaven.  The trouble is, if they do so, it would
be proof that God is not infallible and the very fabric of existence would
be shredded.
To stop them, an angel, a muse, an apostle, two prophets and the great,
great, (followed by many more greats), grandniece of Jesus Christ band
together to save both heaven and earth.  God (Alanis Morissette) would do
it, but she has assumed human form to play skee-ball and hasn't yet
returned to heaven.
Mr. Smith has assembled an impressive array of talent.  Alan Rickman
(JUDAS KISS) is acerbically funny as Metatron, the voice of God, who is as
anatomically challenged as a Ken doll.  Linda Fiorentino (THE LAST
SEDUCTION) is Bethany, a woman whose faith is wavering but because of her
ancestral roots, has been tapped to save existence.  Chris Rock (LETHAL
WEAPON IV) is Rufus, the 13th apostle, who claims to have been omitted
from the biblical records due to racist bigotry.  Jason Mewes (CLERKS) and
Kevin Smith (MALLRATS) return as the Jay and Silent Bob characters of
earlier Smith films, playing a pair of prophets for whom "religious sects"
conjures up a phonetic meaning.
DOGMA is ultimately disappointing because it wastes a grand opportunity
to make some valid points.  It is hard to take seriously a picture that
features a creature formed from the excrement of those crucified at
Golgotha.  But it is equally difficult to dismiss a film which obviously
operates from a perspective that God is real and all powerful and that
Jesus Christ is His son.  If one can wade through the toilet humor, sexual
references, and shocking imagery employed by Mr. Smith, one might find a
number of theological issues worthy of consideration buried beneath the
profanity and offensive material.
What we find is that Mr. Smith has not pointed his judgmental (and
scatological) finger at God but rather at how men have chosen to worship
God via the frameworks they have constructed for that purpose.  The
disappointment of which I speak comes partly from the uneven presentation
of this legitimate message.  For every profound and verifiable observation
made by Mr. Smith, we are subjected to a number of erroneous suppositions.
And of course, it is all camouflaged within a package of outrageous
behavior and offensive humor.
For instance, Rufus logically instructs Bethany on the existence of
Jesus' earthly siblings, refuting the Roman Catholic view of Mary as a
perpetual virgin.  Such a claim can be substantiated by scripture (Mark
6:3).  But later, Rufus makes the statement that belief systems as a whole
are faulty and we should instead rely on the free exchange of ideas.  That
is simply a lie.  While false doctrines exist and should be avoided, there
is a truth which can be believed wholeheartedly.  There just wasn't enough
of it represented in this film.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Leave it to the Catholic Church to damn something that could actually
turn people on to God.  They've done it before with other films deemed
blasphemous  sight unseen  by their bible-thumping leaders.  Remember
The Last Temptation of Christ?  They were upset because Jesus had a
mortal thought.  The horror!  And then there was Priest, where the
leader of a Roman Catholic parish struggled with his homosexuality.
Like that's not happening anywhere in the real world.
With Kevin Smith's Dogma, it seems as if the Church has sunk to new
lows.  While going out of its way to openly mock organized religion,
Dogma is probably the biggest pro-God film in decades.  It's an
effective portrayal of redemption and faith that will really make people
think about their current religious beliefs, and it does it in a way
that doesn't hit you over the head.  Perhaps the Catholic Church is
frightened that its flock will see the film and then question the word
that has been spoon-fed to them over the years.  God forbid people think
for themselves.
When Dogma had its US premiere, throngs of vocal protestors yelled at
people entering the theater.  As Smith (Chasing Amy) hit the red carpet,
he tried to explain to them that his movie was a `really devout,
pro-faith' film.  But as right-wing protest organizer C. Preston Noell
III of The American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and
Property later explained, Smith was wrong.  How fortunate for this
talented filmmaker to come across someone able to point out to him that
a film that he wrote and directed is not what he thinks it is.  Noell
also stated that the movie is `made by sad, silly people who, in effect,
are puppets manipulated by the devil' and that his 200,000 group members
planned to picket theaters once the film opened nationally.  When asked
what he specifically objected to, Noell admitted that he had not seen
the film.  Understandable, since siphoning money from the wallets of
your followers has got to be pretty time-consuming.
So who do you believe?  The `puppets manipulated by the devil' or the
puppets manipulated by the Catholic Church?  See the movie and judge for
yourself.  You can't be damned to spend eternity in a lake of fire just
from watching a movie.  Not with today's ticket prices.  If you sneak in
without paying, that's another story.  And if you're still scared, stay
home and watch CBS's prime-time line-up.
Dogma opens (after a hilarious disclaimer discussing film critics and
platypuses) on the steps of a Red Bank, New Jersey church, where
Cardinal Glick (George Carlin, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure) is
holding a press conference to announce the launch of the new
`Catholicism  WOW' campaign that hopes to plant more asses in church
pews.  In addition to a new breakfast cereal (the wafer-like Hosties)
and the new `Buddy-Christ' (a winking, smiling Jesus giving a
thumbs-up), Glick also explains that this particular church is home to
an all-forgiving arch that will erase the sins of anyone that passes
through it.
News of the arch makes it to Wisconsin, where two fallen angels named
Loki (Matt Damon, Rounders) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck, Forces of Nature)
have spent their days since being banished from Heaven.  Loki and
Bartleby used to carry out God's dirty work - back when he was vengeful
- and see the arch as one last chance to escape the banality of
Wisconsin for the posh confines of Heaven's paradise.  The trouble is
that if Loki and Bartleby are forgiven, it will prove God's fallibility,
which will cause the world to end.
But God is wise to Loki and Bartleby's plans and dispatches angel
Metatron (Alan Rickman, Sense and Sensibility) to urge a mortal into a
crusade to stop the duo.  The mortal is Bethany (Linda Fiorentino, Men
in Black), an Illinois Planned Parenthood employee that has recently
found herself doubting her Catholic beliefs.  Although she initially
believes Metatron's visit was just a bad dream, Bethany reluctantly hits
the road, meeting  - in Wizard of Oz fashion - two horny prophets
(Smith's recurring characters Jay and Silent Bob), a forgotten
thirteenth Apostle named Rufus (Chris Rock, Lethal Weapon 4) and a
stripper/muse named Serendipity (Salma Hayek, Wild Wild West).
Other uniquely cast roles include Bud Cort (Harold & Maude) as a
homeless man and best-selling crooner Alanis Morissette as God.  If it
sounds like too much, it really is  especially Hayek's unnecessary
character and the scene with the poop monster.  Dogma is unrelentingly
and blisteringly hysterical, which, in measured doses, is fantastic.
Unfortunately here, like South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut, it
becomes tiresome after a while, leaving the film with a very uneven
feel.  But this can easily be overlooked, if not just for being an
incredible commercial for the very people that are trying to convince
you not to see it.  That is perhaps a greater irony than anything in
Smith's script.

Unusually high expectations are the bane of movie makers everywhere. They
nearly succeeded in killing the new Star Wars film, they caused people to
expect "The Mummy" to belong to a different genre, and they will most likely do
a good job of killing Kevin Smith's latest outing, "Dogma". I must admit, I am
guilty of having my expectations up a little too high, mainly because I so
vastly enjoyed Smith's previous outings. So it is entirely possible that my
review of this film is a tad biased.
Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck) are two angels who have been
banished from heaven. However, they have just found a loophole in Catholic law
which will permit their return to paradise. The catch is, if they succeed, all
existence will be wiped out because God will have been shown to be fallible.
The universe's only hope lies in the hands of Christ's descendent, Bethany
(Linda Fiorentino). Bethany will be assisted by two prophets named Jay and
Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith), and the 13th apostle, Rufus (Chris
Rock). Working against them are the demon Azrael (Jason Lee), three kids with
hockey sticks (dont ask), and the pair of angles themselves.
If there is one thing that Kevin Smith will be known for (other than for
playing the hilarious Silent Bob), it is his ability to write witty dialogue.
While "Dogma" certainly has its moments of wonderful dialogue, it is marred by
long spans of rather dull talk regarding the nature of religion. The comic
dialogue here is at its best when coming from Jason Mewes, who plays the
recurring character from Smith's previous three films and from Alan Rickman as
the voice of god, Metatron.
The cast here is really quite good. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon appear to be
having a tremendous amount of fun with their roles, Chris Rock is amusing as
the bitter, forgotten apostle, and Salma Hayek is delightful, as always, in a
turn as the muse, Serendipity. In fact, the only person who seems out of place
here is Linda Fiorentino. While normally a competent actress, she never seems
particularly comfortable with her role here and delivers her lines in a
particularly bored fashion.
While the film has been vastly criticized for its assaults on religion, I found
them to be nothing more than playful jabs at those who are too set in their
ways. The problem with this movie isn't its religious content, it's the fact
that the jokes here are few and far between. Smith seems more concerned with
trying to convey a moral message about understanding and the true meaning of
religion than he does with making the film comical. While the message is all
well and good, it isn't why most audiences are going to this film.
"Dogma" runs far too long at 130 minutes. In fact, I found myself drifting off
several times during this exessively lengthy film. Due to this and the lack of
humor, I'm forced to give "Dogma" two and a half stars and a recommendation to
wait for video if you're really wanting to see it

Much has been said about _Dogma_, much of that being negative.  For all
the talk I had heard about the allegedly inflammatory content of the
religious-themed comedy prior to seeing it, what shocked me the most were
those general accusations that writer-director Kevin Smith had committed
a cinematic act of sacrilege.  If you ask me, there is perhaps no other
filmmaker working today who is more serious about his or her faith than
Smith.  After all, is there any other filmmaker who has thanked God in
the closing credits of every single one of his films?
That said, after watching _Dogma_, I can see why people (namely the
Catholic League) have raised some objections.  After all, outrageous
elements such as dialogue passages criticizing the Bible's "bad
storytelling" and a thread where a cardinal starts a ridiculous
"Catholicism Wow" promotional campaign are bound to raise eyebrows--even
moreso when taken out of context, which is what the film's vocal
detractors have done (and how could they not, given the fact that they
haven't seen a frame of the film?).  And context is everything when it
comes to _Dogma_.
_Dogma_ is being billed as "a comic fantasia," and that description
should be taken to its core: it's a comedy; it's a fantasy.  As in it's
supposed to be taken lightly.  And not in a realistic fashion.  As a
hilarious typed pre-film disclaimer notes, this becomes clear within the
film's first ten minutes.  Smith's wacky plot revolves around the
dastardly scheme of two fallen angels, Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby
(Ben Affleck).  They discover a loophole in church dogma that will allow
them to end their eternal exile in Wisconsin and reenter the pearly gates
of Heaven.  The added consequence, however, is that their success would
spell the end of all existence.  With God having been put out of
commission while on a holiday, the fate of the world and all else rests
with efforts of a ragtag bunch: Metatron (Alan Rickman), the angel who
serves as the voice of God; Rufus (Chris Rock), the bitter, heretofore
unknown 13th Apostle; heavenly Muse-turned-stripper Serendipity (Salma
Hayek); a pair of familiar Prophets by the name Jay and Silent Bob (Jason
Mewes and Smith, reprising their recurring roles); and the reluctant key
figure in thwarting the renegade duo, Bethany (Linda Fiorentino), an
abortion clinic worker who, after a series of rough life experiences, has
lost her faith.
The last sentence points up _Dogma_'s central flaw: overpopulation.  In
addition to the aforementioned, also encountered along the way is a demon
named Azrael (Jason Lee) and his trio of hockey stick-wielding henchmen;
Cardinal Glick (George Carlin), who institutes the "Catholicism Wow"
campaign; and cameo roles played by familiar faces such as Janeane
Garofalo.  Some characters could have easily been jettisoned, namely
Serendipity; while it's always a pleasure to see Hayek on the silver
screen, her character is pretty much just the token female celestial
being (or, rather, the token celestial being with breasts, for those from
above have no gender).  All the extra bodies also draw valuable time away
from one of the story's more primary concerns, which is Bethany's winding
road to rediscovering her faith; as such, her ultimate enlightenment
doesn't pack the punch that it should.
Much like there are characters that don't quite work, there are also
scenes and gags in _Dogma_ that fall short.  Jay and Silent Bob's big
entrance is a throwback to the over-the-top and largely unfunny comic
book gags in _Mallrats_, and there's one elaborate effects set piece
involving a shit demon (yes,  you read that right) is a complete failure.
 Where _Dogma_ excels, however, is in the area of verbal humor, arguably
Smith's forte.  The most memorable moments are all in the written and
spoken word, and the film has more than its share of great dialogue:
Rufus' rumination on Mary and Joseph's sex life and his angry diatribe
over being left out of the Bible; Loki and Bartleby confronting a
boardroom full of execs on their wide variety of sins; and the general
byplay between Jay and Silent Bob, and that between the pair and Bethany.
Along its lighthearted and offbeat comic path, though, Smith does raise
(and in a fairly seamless manner at that) some serious and not-so-serious
questions about Catholic dogma and organized religion in general.  By
virtue of their definition and the fact that they're in regards to
religion, these questions would understandably upset religious groups. 
But what those objectors fail to see that the questions raised, such as
the dangerous differences between "beliefs" and "ideas," are intelligent
ones that would only spring from the mind of someone who takes his or her
faith seriously.  Smith isn't labeling anyone or anything as being wrong,
rather offering food for thought.
Aside from the uniformly strong work of the ensemble and Smith's wit and
ever-improving way with the camera (check out all the added action in the
background!), that's what makes _Dogma_ a cut above most other comedies:
the audacity to challenge the very audience that comes in for all the
penis and flatulence jokes (and no, they're not in short supply).  A lot
of people will walk out of _Dogma_ thinking back on its many laughs, but
just as many, if not more, will come out reflecting on their own
religious faith--people who, on any other given day, would probably not
give the issue a single thought.  And if that's not an act of piety--as
opposed to one of blasphemy, with which Smith has been so unjustly
charged--then I don't know what is.  (opens November 12)

Writer/director Kevin Smith's DOGMA is quite surprising, but not for the
reasons you might expect.  Smith, famous for his hilarious brand of
irreverent humor with films such as CLERKS and CHASING AMY, is back with
his best motion picture ever, DOGMA, the most politically incorrect
movie of the year.  This is all as expected given its early positive
buzz and its being dropped like a hot potato by its original
distributor, Disney.
What is truly surprising is that DOGMA, while unabashedly ridiculing the
Catholic Church, asks so many good questions and poses so many insights
into the meaning of faith that it becomes the most religious movie of
the year.  Usually when pictures want to make fun of organized religion,
as the recent and awful STIGMATA did against the Catholic Church, they
go for nothing but the cheap shots and never try to raise any genuine
issues about belief in God.  DOGMA, while firmly in the comedic camp, is
as good a serious film as it is a funny one.  Only in its gratuitously
violent scenes does the film go needlessly awry.
Knowing that he would get tremendous flack, Smith opens his film with a
written disclaimer.  He explains, among other things, that the film is a
"work of comedic fantasy" and asks viewers not to "pass undue judgment"
since that is "reserved for God and God alone (this goes for you film
critics toojust kidding)."  Already, he has softened us up, and the
movie hasn't even started.
Cardinal Glick, played by none other than George Carlin in an inspired
bit of casting against type, announces with great fanfare a new "buddy
Christ" figurine to replace the tired, depressing old crucifix.  Along
with the church's new upbeat icon is a fresh marketing campaign with the
theme of "Catholicism Wow!"  Now, you can see why Disney was worried
about protestors and boycotts.
The cardinal is a pragmatist to whom success means filled pews.  When
asked a question about the tobacco industry, the cardinal laments, "If
only we had their numbers."
Two angel outcasts, Bartleby (Ben Affleck) and the infamous Angel of
Death, Loki (Matt Damon), have been sent, not to Hell, but to Wisconsin.
They've been wandering around while trying to find a way back into
Heaven.  They discover a loophole in Catholic dogma which will let them
reenter heaven but will obliterate all human existence in the process.
God's forces, aided by selected humans, try to prevent this cataclysmic
tragedy.
As the angels make their way to New Jersey, where the loophole lies,
they go looking for sinners to punish along the way.  You can just
imagine how the Angel of Death deals with transgressors.  It's not
pretty, but most of the violence, thankfully, happens off-screen.
Typical of the show's serious side, the two angels, acting like a couple
of seminarians, get into a heated argument on the precise meaning of
freewill and religion.  This occurs in a vacant parking garage just
outside of New Jersey.   Generally nothing good happens in a parking
garage in the movies and certainly nothing profound.
Two stoner dudes, Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (the director Kevin
Smith), hang out at an abortion clinic where Bethany (Linda Fiorentino)
works, since they figure that they can find loose women to pick up
there.  Acting like they have a collective IQ of 50, the guys start
hanging out with Bethany, mainly hoping to have sex with her.  Bethany,
who confesses that she would give anything to get back the intensity of
the religious faith she had when she was a kid, learns that she has been
chosen to stop the angels.
Along the way the three meet Serendipity (Salma Hayek), a muse who
claims she's responsible for 19 of the 20 high grossing films of all
times.  She emphatically claims that she had nothing to do with HOME
ALONE, however.  All of the characters possess both a serious and a
comedic side.  "You people don't celebrate your faith, you morn it,"
Serendipity complains.
One scene of really gross bathroom humor features an evil guy known as
Poopyboy.  He will leave you thanking your lucky stars that
Smell-a-Vision never caught on.
A whimsical, violent, hilarious and perceptive motion picture, DOGMA
asks great questions.  What is the eternal question that you've always
wanted to ask God?  "Why are we here?" Bethany wants to know.  God, who
doesn't speak, has a perfect answer for her.  DOGMA, a motion picture
destined to be hated as sacrilegious by large numbers of people, most of
whom won't see it, isn't for everyone.  But if you can approach it with
an open mind, I think you'll find it an extremely funny and quite
rewarding film.
DOGMA runs 2:05.  It is rated R for strong language including
sex-related dialogue, violence, crude humor and some drug content and
would be acceptable for older high school students.

"Dogma" is unashamedly a pointless, crude comedy attempting to justify its
existence with writer-director Kevin Smith's dogmatic principles. Knowing the
controversy over the its portrait of catholicism and its ideals, I found
nothing offensive or demeaning or needlessly cruel about "Dogma." At the same
time, that is precisely its problem. 
"Dogma" begins with two Wisconsin angels named Bartleby and Loki (Ben Affleck
and Matt Damon) as they watch people arriving at an airport, noticing how many
of them arrive happy and content. The twosome are stuck in exile, and thus
lavish a plan to make their mark at a church in New Jersey, which has adopted a
new way of looking at God - it is called "Catholicism NOW!" with a statue of
Jesus winking and holding his thumb up.  Their hope is to reclaim their spot as
God's avenging angels, thus causing havoc and murderous rampages on their quest
- they kill all the sinners of the world. So far, so good. This stuff is funny,
clever and smart - pure vintage Smith.
Unfortunately, the movie then switches gears as it introduces a lonely abortion
clinic worker named Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) who has lost her faith, or
perhaps her faith in men! Enter a pale-looking seraphim (the droll Alan
Rickman) who convinces her she is the chosen one - she must stop the angels on
their trek to New Jersey. The two prophets who will accompany her are regular
stock characters Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith), the crude,
sex-starved stoners with nary a thought in their heads. Oh, yes, and out of the
sky falls the forgotten 13th apostle named Rufus (Chris Rock) - he was left out
of the Bible because he was black. "Jesus owes me twelve dollars," argues
Rufus.
I will say that Kevin Smith has some good ideas and juggles dozens of
characters around with some ease...but the tone is all wrong. Quite simply, the
staging and pacing of the film is as flat as the Kansas plains. There are jokes
but there are no real punchlines  - there is no conviction in the delivery of
dialogue. The acting is mostly stale and shoddy, not to mention the film's
cruddy, muddy look. Kevin Smith has never been known for visual flair because
his dialogue often saved the day - not this time. I think Linda Fiorentino is
the key to the film's faults. 
Fiorentino, an invigoratingly sexy and alluring actress, is given precious
little to do - her character exists solely for the purpose of salvation. By the
end of the film, you will wonder what was her real purpose. During Fiorentino's
first appearance, Janeane Garofalo makes a choice cameo as her fellow worker
and there is more wit and dry asides in her brief scene than in all of Linda's
scenes put together. I would have preferred Garofalo as Bethany any day.
However, every scene featuring Fiorentino is weak and drags the film downhill.
A real shame considering this is the same actress from "After Hours" and "The
Last Seduction."
Another big minus are the two avenging angels played by Damon and Affleck, two
actors of dubious talent at best. To be fair, I've enjoyed Ben Affleck in the
past but here, he takes himself too seriously resulting in a ludicrously
blood-drenched climax where he dons a pair of wings and initiates a massacre.
Matt Damon has the same blank stare throughout the film, and has no sense of
comic timing. His personality is nonexistent, merely a bland, bickering angel
attempting to make us laugh with his annoying wisecracks. He might better off
writing another film with his pal Affleck. 
Most of the film is full of bickering and theological discussions on the
virtues of faith in a faithless world, but hardly any of it is funny or
engaging. Though there are some shining moments of glory supplied by Chris
Rock, George Carlin (as a hip Cardinal), and the reliable Jay and Silent Bob,
there are also soporific moments by Jason Lee as a demon, Bud Cort in a
relatively mute role, Salma Hayek as Serendipity, a muse, a purely grotesque
monster called Golgotha, and three anonymous ice hockey minions of the devil
who barely cause a rift. None of this merits anything more than a mild chuckle
or two. By the end of this interminable stupidity, the shaky dogmatic
principles outweigh the comedic output.

Kevin Smith is like a big kid.  His humor is that of a sophisticated
juvenile's.  He grew up idolizing Star Wars and loves comic books, having
also written a few.  He also has a cult following, mostly composed of
teenagers, college students, and Smith's own fellow adolescent-minded
grownups.  Smith is hilarious in person and in writing, but when he tries
to be earnest and moralize, that is when he goes wrong.  Kevin Smith is a
better writer than director, and he'll be the first to tell you that.  That
might also be part of the reason why his moralizing comes across as so
heavy-handed.  Great directors show us their theses instead of having the
characters sermonize them.  This was true in the overrated Chasing Amy, and
it is true for Dogma as well.
That is not to say Smith's message is a bad one.  In Dogma, Smith tells us
that problems arise when people believe beyond any doubt that their insight
into God and God's desires is superior to anyone else's.  Basically,
dogmatism is bad.  Changing the minds of the dogmatic is virtually
impossible, and since the dogmatic believe that they have special insight,
they also know what is best for you, whether you like it or not.  This is
not exactly a new message in movies (see Inherit the Wind), but I have no
problems with recycling old ones, particularly since Dogma's protesters are
proving Smith's point.  Smith's own problem with delivering this message is
that he beats us over the head with it like we are reading a Dogma for
Dummies book.  But this is Smith's personality, and his simplistic views
neglect such adult issues as how does one interpret the Bible (or Koran,
etc.) correctly (or if there even is a correctly) and how one settles
disputes of heretofore dogmatic concerns.
The story concerns abortion clinic worker Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) being
chosen by Voice of God, Metatron (Alan Rickman), to prevent the destruction
of the universe by two fallen angels, Bartleby (Ben Affleck) and Angel of
Death, Loki (Matt Damon).  Along the way, forgotten thirteenth Apostle,
Rufus (Chris Rock), stripper muse Serendipity (Salma Hayek), and slacker
duo Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith himself) come to
Bethany's aid.  Fallen muse, Azrael (Jason Lee), proves to be the
behind-the-scenes manipulator for all the chicanery.
The logical but convoluted plot only exists as an excuse for the jokes and
to make Smith's points, and in itself, has little dramatic momentum.  Among
the supposedly outrageous claims made by the film is that God is a woman,
Jesus was black, and the Bible was written by a bunch of racist,
misogynistic white men.  Of course, Kevin Smith does not necessarily
subscribe to these ideas himself.  They are a metaphor for the fears and
insecurities of the dogmatic.  Smith says as much in his amusing disclaimer
that precedes the movie.  When Harvey Weinstein asked Smith to put it into
the film before Cannes, Smith thought it might give validation to
protesters' claims that the film was sacrilegious, but then he rethought it
and turned the disclaimer into a joke.
The film's humor is uneven.  Some parts are very funny as when Bethany goes
for a fire extinguisher when Metatron makes a burning-bush kind of
entrance.  But many of the film's jokes just bomb, as in virtually anything
involving Salma Hayek's Serendipity.  Also, some of the jokes can be seen
coming from a mile away.  Still, Smith keeps the zingers coming at a
sufficiently rapid pace.  Among the actors, Fiorentino and Rickman stand
out by far.  Fiorentino virtually by herself gives the film emotional
weight.  Damon and Affleck are fairly lackluster.  Rock and Hayek exist in
the film pretty much only as comic relief as are Mews and Smith.  But the
latter duo fare much better because Jay and Silent Bob, who recur in all of
Smith's movies, are much more in line with Smith's brand of humor.  Bud
Cort, George Carlin, Janeane Garofalo, Guinevere Turner, and Alanis
Morissette all make cameo appearances.

Unusually high expectations are the bane of movie makers everywhere. They
nearly succeeded in killing the new Star Wars film, they caused people to
expect "The Mummy" to belong to a different genre, and they will most likely do
a good job of killing Kevin Smith's latest outing, "Dogma". I must admit, I am
guilty of having my expectations up a little too high, mainly because I so
vastly enjoyed Smith's previous outings. So it is entirely possible that my
review of this film is a tad biased.
Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck) are two angels who have been
banished from heaven. However, they have just found a loophole in Catholic law
which will permit their return to paradise. The catch is, if they succeed, all
existence will be wiped out because God will have been shown to be fallible.
The universe's only hope lies in the hands of Christ's descendent, Bethany
(Linda Fiorentino). Bethany will be assisted by two prophets named Jay and
Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith), and the 13th apostle, Rufus (Chris
Rock). Working against them are the demon Azrael (Jason Lee), three kids with
hockey sticks (dont ask), and the pair of angles themselves.
If there is one thing that Kevin Smith will be known for (other than for
playing the hilarious Silent Bob), it is his ability to write witty dialogue.
While "Dogma" certainly has its moments of wonderful dialogue, it is marred by
long spans of rather dull talk regarding the nature of religion. The comic
dialogue here is at its best when coming from Jason Mewes, who plays the
recurring character from Smith's previous three films and from Alan Rickman as
the voice of god, Metatron.
The cast here is really quite good. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon appear to be
having a tremendous amount of fun with their roles, Chris Rock is amusing as
the bitter, forgotten apostle, and Salma Hayek is delightful, as always, in a
turn as the muse, Serendipity. In fact, the only person who seems out of place
here is Linda Fiorentino. While normally a competent actress, she never seems
particularly comfortable with her role here and delivers her lines in a
particularly bored fashion.
While the film has been vastly criticized for its assaults on religion, I found
them to be nothing more than playful jabs at those who are too set in their
ways. The problem with this movie isn't its religious content, it's the fact
that the jokes here are few and far between. Smith seems more concerned with
trying to convey a moral message about understanding and the true meaning of
religion than he does with making the film comical. While the message is all
well and good, it isn't why most audiences are going to this film.
"Dogma" runs far too long at 130 minutes. In fact, I found myself drifting off
several times during this exessively lengthy film. Due to this and the lack of
humor, I'm forced to give "Dogma" two and a half stars and a recommendation to
wait for video if you're really wanting to see it

  After seeing Dogma, I can't get it out of mind. The film is  filled with so
many messages and jokes, that I feel the need to see it again. Although Kevin
Smith brings some of the amateur humor along, he manages to maintain a clever
and sometimes provocative script that dares to be different.
  After all the controversy and arguments over Dogma, it quite surprisingly
paid off. While it is sure to offend some religious protesters, others may
understand what Smith was trying to express. I for one was completely
satisfied. Sure the film may be crude, but if you look closer, you will notice
that Smith was more or less mocking our world, than our religions. Like
Bartebly and Loki were saying, they can't believe how far our world has
dropped. People sinning left and right etc. To me this seems like a mockery of
how we treated God, or maybe not. It's just one of the many ideas floating in
my mind head about this film.
  The film opens with Bartebly (Ben Affleck) and Loki (Matt Damon), 2 angels
cast out of heaven for disobeying their Lord. They receive a letter about a
church that has a loophole that would bring them back to heaven. One thing the
letter fails to mention is the elimination of the world's existence, because
you can't betray God. So now our lives are in the hands of Bethany (Linda
Florentino),  Jay (Jason Mewes) Silent Bob (Kevin Smith), and The 13th Apostle
Rufus (Chris Rock). With the help of the voice of God (Alan Rickman), they can
save the world, but again they face another problem. It appears that Azrael
(The devil's muse) and a gang of thugs, will stop at nothing to let them enter
the church (because they would rather die then go to hell).
  The film is absurd on some levels, but there's so much to absorb here. That
was however a problem. Kevin Smith seemed a bit confused as well. It's like he
had too many ideas and made a mess of putting them together, but Dogma
straightens itself out. The same goes with the jokes. Just about everyone but
Jason Lee and Linda Florentino provide plenty of laughs to keep the film
flowing, especially Chris Rock. Speaking of Chris Rock, if it wasn't for his
presence, the film would have suffered badly. Since Linda Florentino was
totally miscast as the leading character, I was a bit worried that would permit
the film from flowing smoothly. Thankfully Chris came in the nick of time.
Although he wasn't his usual loud mouthed self, he still offered the most
entertaining scenes. The rest of the cast was good, but more notable were Matt
Damon and Ben Affleck. Although they were meant to be the villains, they
created some hilarious scenes, one of which includes a Mickey Mouse type of
animal named Mooby, undoubtedly a reference towards Miramax for turning the
film down because it was a Disney owned corporation.
  As I mentioned earlier, the script is very bold. You have to congratulate
Kevin on his achievement, even if you disliked it. What Kevin did was
brilliant, and this is without a doubt the best original screenplay of the
year. It most likely won't get nominated for an Oscar because of how harsh it
is, but I sure won't overlook it. 
  As for Kevin Smith, it's about time he has matured more. Once a comic book
nerd, now a respected director, I'm glad to see that he has stepped up. I will
be curious as to what approach he might take next. The sky's the limit.
  Crude and offensive it may be, but I love it. For once people should forget
about life and have an enjoyable time. After all, even "God has a sense of
humor."

Ater I came out of the cinema to watch Dogma, my reaction was "Kevin Smith
is a genius!". Not for directing this movie and starring in it, but for
writing it. In Dogma, Smith questions the whole concept of faith and
religion, by diving deeply into one religion and coming up with the big
reality of what religion should be, in a unusual and comic way.
Bartleby (Ben Affleck) and Loki (Matt Damon) are two angels wanting to get
back to heaven after being sent away by God years ago. They found a heavenly
loophole in New Jersey where they could go back, but at the same time by
doing that, they will destroy all existence. Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) is
then send by The Voice of God (Alan Rickman) to stop these two buddies from
entering the loophle. She is accompanied by two stoner-prophets, Silent Bob
(Kevin Smith), who only spoke 5 words during the entire movie, and Jay
(Jason Mewes), who spoke 500.000 words, 499.995 being "fuck". They are also
accompanied by Rufus (Chris Rock), the 13th black apostle.
On the way to New Jersey, a lot of things happens, and a few deep
discussions occur, talking about religion. From these discussions, Smith
wants to point out how the normal society treats religion as an obligation,
not as a faith. Which is, in some kind of way, exactly the same what I'm
feeling. And in between a whole lot of movie jokes.
So they made it to New Jersey. But how do you stop two angels, desperate of
going home back to heaven? Well, maybe God can help.
This movie is being criticized heavily by the catholic community, but I
think that is a bit unfair. Smith did make some jokes about catholics,
Jesus, and even God, but in the end Smith is actually showing the reality
about religion. People who can look through the profanity and the
poop-monster will be thinking a lot about their faith and religion, and
Smith is showing the way to what these people should do, which is believe in
God and do something about it.

Dogma  Written and directed by: Kevin Smith. Starring Linda Fiorentino, Matt
Damon, Ben Affleck, Chris Rock, Alan Rickman, George Carlin, Salma Hayek,
Jason Mewes, Alanis Morisette, Smith and assorted surprise cameos.
The pitch: a woman suffering a crisis of faith must stop two fallen angels
from sneaking back into Heaven and thereby negating existence in this
ribald, raunchy and occasionally provocative satire of Roman Catholicism by
the director of Clerks.
By turns gleefully offensive, juvenile and, yes, even brilliant, this edgy
comic parable doesn't deserve the hail of criticism raining from some
(non-official) segments of the Catholic Church. A contingent of bishops,
meanwhile, is calling for a boycott. Verily, film fans, here is the gospel:
those who lose or even doubt their faith after seeing this film didn't have
a strong grasp on it to begin with. The director is clearly a religious man,
if not a devout Catholic in the traditional sense. And he knows the Bible
better than some of his critics. His intent here is to question the
machinations and politics of the church, not the underlying principles of
faith that members embrace for meaning in their lives. And Smith doesn't
push as far as he could have gone: his camera never even enters a sanctuary.
No blasphemy has been committed here, although the picture is assuredly not
for all tastes. Perhaps the greatest offense, though, comes from people who
would condemn Dogma without seeing it. We can't do anything about that,
since willful ignorance and hypocrisy are not crimes in this country. Then
again, neither is blasphemy. Smith's great success is he removes religion
from the holier-than-thou hands of official church spokesmen and turns
possession over to the clumsy and imperfect people who must live in this
world.
Fiorentino stars as Bethany, a world-weary worker at an abortion clinic. One
of the movie's quiet ironies is Bethany's infertility. Alone in bed, she
receives a message from God in the form of a fireball that turns into Alan
Rickman (recall the terrorist leader in Die Hard). The sensible Bethany
blasts a fire extinguisher at the intruder, then threatens to crown him with
a baseball bat. She cools off when Rickman unfurls his wings and tells her
to settle down. Affecting a fey English accent, he explains that Bethany
must stop a pair of fallen angels (Damon and Affleck) from passing beneath
the archway of a renovated church in New Jersey. These wicked angels once
were God's messengers of doom  the fiery Old Testament stuff - but they
fell from Her favor and She banished them toWisconsin. Eager to regain
entrance to the Kingdom of Heaven after spending millennia in the land of
cheese, they discover a loophole in Catholic dogma.  If Damon and Affleck
walk through the church in Jersey, they may have a plenary indulgence  what
Catholics call instant forgiveness for all sins  which entitles direct
admission into Heaven. Problem is, that would show God is fallible. And that
would trigger an outcome worse than the apocalypse - all would cease to
exist.
The cardinal of the church (George Carlin, having a blast) plans to
rededicate his sanctuary to God with a new marketing campaign endorsed by
the Vatican  Catholicism Wow! At a press conference, Carlin unveils a
statue of the Buddy Christ, a grinning, winking figure with a prominent
thumbs up. Buddy is a new totem for a new generation bored with the
traditional symbols and rituals of the church (The posture of Buddy Christ
also bears passing resemblance to Mr. Natural, the brain-addled philosopher
in Robert Crumb's underground comics. That, if anything, might rankle the
devout, assuming they are hip to the subreference).
Back in Wisconsin, Damon enjoys toying with the fragile faithful. Wandering
through an airport like some sinister Hare Krishna, he convinces a nun that
she has wasted her life. Soon the poor sister heads off in search of a
one-night stand and fashionable clothing. Damon and Affleck snicker at their
mischief.
Bethany seems a strange choice to stop a pair of rotten angels. She is a
reluctant hero, preferring to tithe her salary from Planned Parenthood to
the church. Only when her life is saved by two unlikely prophets, Jay and
Silent Bob (Mewes and director Smith), does she believe in the urgency of
her mission. Jay and Silent Bob are recurring characters in all of the
director's films. Jay is coarse and chatty, a stoner with a sharp, foul
tongue who cannot conceal his basic cluelessness. And he damn-near steals
the film. As Silent Bob, Smith has three words of dialogue in the entire
picture, but his range of facial expressions can bring down the house. They
hook up with Bethany after she is attacked outside the abortion clinic by
three teenage demons wielding hockey sticks. After Jay and Silent Bob
dispatch the thugs, Bethany wants to know why they're hanging around an
abortion clinic.
`We thought it would be a good place to meet loose women,' Jay declares.
Together, this triumvirate is joined by Rufus, the 13th apostle (Chris Rock)
who literally falls from the sky to help them.
Rufus says his role was left out of the Bible because he's black. He also
claims Jesus once told him the meaning of life during a wedding reception in
Cana, `but I got drunk and forgot it.'
They meet a stripper-muse (the delectable Hayek). She claims to be the
inspiration for 19 of the 20 top-grossing movies of all time. But she won't
take credit for Home Alone.
`Someone sold their soul to Satan to get the grosses up on that piece of
crap,' she declares.
Extending the metaphor, the heroes are soon attacked by an excrement demon
that rises from a toilet and, wellwhat's a Kevin Smith movie without a
little potty humor?
While Bethany and her holy helpers ponder how to fight the demon, Damon and
Affleck make their way across the country, spreading murder and mayhem. The
fallen angels crash a board meeting of The Mooby Corporation, a company
clearly modeled after Disney (which passed on distributing this film,
fearing the ensuing controversy). Damon berates the board members. Enjoying
the power of omnipotence, he chronicles their private sins and then
slaughters them all, splattering their blood on the corporate mascot -- a
golden calf wearing Mickey Mouse pants.
Smith's screenplay is crammed with pop-cultural references, both sly and
obvious, from Star Wars characters to ancient commercials for floor wax. At
times, we wonder if he might be trying too hard, especially during the
longish second hour when each character gets to deliver a speech (sermon?)
that earnestly explains the importance of faith  regardless of religious
denominations.
The director also wobbles at the climax, when Affleck and Damon lay waste to
a city block surrounding the church. These and other scenes of jarring
violence seem out of place in a comedy. The bloodshed throws off the tone of
the film  illustrating once again that, as with most art forms, less is
more. When the point is made, move on.
Perhaps Smith is struggling to maintain his momentum. Maybe he'll sustain
that high note in his next film. But in Dogma, after soaring completely over
the top with two hours of anarchic excess, he literally ends with a squeak
when Alanis Morisette arrives for her cameo as God. Morisette may be an
impassioned vocalist, but she's no actor. And a movie that wants to push the
satirical limit needs a climax that packs an ungodly wallop and an almighty
bang, not the thespian exertions of a rank amateur.
Rated R for constant foul language, scatological humor, brief (but potent)
violence.
