Original Title: Rang E-Khoda
Starring Mohsen Ramezani, Hossein Mahjub, Salime Feizi, Elham Sharifi;
Written & Directed by Majid Majidi;
Cinematography by Mohammad Davudi
        The children in Majid Majidi's films seem to exist, at times, in a
state of grace, an earthly Eden where their experience of the world is
whole and uncorrupted.  Their perceptions are not filtered through
politics, sexuality, economics, prejudice, or other adult concerns.  The
world is there, and they are in it--they ask for no more.  Their actions
are motivated by love and selflessness, by reverence for creation.  They
are, to borrow the title of Majidi's previous work, the children of heaven.
        Such is the case for Mohammad, a young boy who happens to be blind,
but whose other senses are keenly attuned to the sounds and smells and
surfaces around him.  His teacher once told him that God favours the blind,
and while Mohammad--reasonably enough--questions this logic, at times we
understand what the teacher means, because Mohammad seems to experience the
undiluted essence of the world in a sensual communion which we could only
dream of sharing.
        Early in the film, Mohammad hears the cries of a chick which has
fallen out of its nest in a tree onto the grass below.  Acting by sound and
touch alone, he scares off a cat which is closing in for the kill, locates
the defenseless little creature, shinnies up the tree, and returns the
chick to its nest.   This tender moment may mean little in the grand scheme
of things, but it resonates with a sense of the interconnectedness of all
life.  And because this is a deeply religious film, implicit in the scene
is the notion that just as Mohammad cradles the chick in his hands and
lifts it to its place up in the tree, we too are cradled in the nurturing
hands of God, and will be lifted up to Heaven.
        Or perhaps not.  Mohammad's life is not easy.  Blissfully Edenic as
it seems at times, Mohammad nevertheless inhabits the secular world, where
the Word of God, if it exists, is written in invisible ink.  His mother
died several years ago.  His father does not want the burden of caring for
him.  At the beginning of the film, the father urges a teacher at his son's
school to care for the boy, claiming that he cannot manage on his own.  But
Mohammad's grandmother and sister care deeply for him, and when he returns
to his rural home at the end of the school term they are delighted to see
him.  We discover that the father is not concerned about his inability to
provide adequate care for his child, but rather is worried that having a
blind son will cause a setback to his plans to remarry.
        The movie is sweet and joyous in its contemplation of the
children's lives--innocent without being cloyingly cute--but it does not
ignore the troubles that complicate those lives.  The children are limned
by clouds of glory, but Mohammad's father is a tired, selfish, unhappy man,
beset by poverty and sorrow.  There is no childhood, no heaven, left in
him, and he cannot appreciate what it is that makes Mohammad's life
meaningful.  He cruelly insists that his son go to study carpentry with a
blind carpenter, taking him away from his sister and grandmother.  He
claims that he is acting in Mohammad's interests, but the grandmother sees
right through him.  She herself is another delightful character, but her
health is failing, and she serves as a reminder that even the children of
heaven are mortal in this world.
        THE COLOR OF GOD is not so much a story as an act of devotion.
Majidi concentrates on natural unembellished images, and allows us to
contemplate them until they take on a kind of spiritual depth.  He allows
us to share Mohammad's perceptions, to some extent, by holding the camera
steady and filtering out unnecessary sounds so that our attention is
focused on the noises the blind boy hears: woodpeckers in the forest,
seagulls crying above the roar of surf on the beach.  A sense of the
vibrancy of the living world is impressed upon us: close-ups of touching
hands, a dying fish being returned to its pool of water, a butterfly caught
momentarily in a girl's palm.  The movie reminds us of the delights of
simple things, and makes them seem almost sanctifying.
        The serene, hymnal mood is disrupted in the climactic sequence,
which forces a crisis in the relationship between Mohammad and his father.
It is an exciting and tense finale, but comes as a shock, and is rather
contrived, forcing closure upon a film which does not need it.  It does,
however, lead to a remarkable final shot which perhaps justifies the shift
in tone.  On a literal level, what we see is ambiguous, but its
significance is as clear and pure as the bells that ring out at the end of
BREAKING THE WAVES.  There is no question: it is, like the film as a whole,
an act of unadulterated faith in a world where a father--or perhaps
Father--allows his children to doubt his love.

_The_Color_of_Paradise_ (PG) *** (out of ****)
Like his crowdpleasing _Children_of_Heaven_, the latest from Iranian
writer-director Majid Majidi is also a tribute to the spirit and
innocence of a child.  Here, the subject is a smart blind boy named
Mohammed (Mohsen Ramezani, superb), who is unwanted by his heartless
father, Hashem (Hossein Mahjub).  Hashemsees his son not as a person, but
as an impediment on his forthcoming marriage and a burden on his life in
general.
Majidi takes his time to reach the inevitable crisis where Hashem is
confronted by his duties not only as a parent but a human being, but the
time getting there is fairly well-spent.  While he drives home the point
of Mohammed's good nature a bit too hard (I could've done without the
scene where he takes a fallen baby bird and puts it back in its nest),
the sight of the Northern Iran countryside is stunning; thanks to
Mohammad Davoodi's breathtaking photography, it's easy to see the colors
of paradise.  All this is just a prelude to the grabber of a final shot,
a simple image that is haunting in its ambiguity.  Similarly, the entire
film is memorable in its sweet simplicity.

In a mountain meadow bursting with colorful wildflowers, Mohammad
(Mohsen Ramezani), a 5-year-old blind boy, has come to find his granny
(Salime Feizi).  His two, bubbly sisters (Elham Sharifi and Farahnaz
Safari) form his advance party.  Dressed in colorful, native Iranian
costumes that rival the flowers, they find his granny and lead her to
the tree behind which he is hiding.
Mohammad is the central character of THE COLOR OF PARADISE by
writer/director Majid Majidi (THE CHILDREN OF HEAVEN).  A simple and
sometimes poignant tale, the story is completely overwhelmed by the
picture's lush visuals.  Much like Martin Scorsese's KUNDUN, the film's
enjoyment stems mainly from its look.  The story is so minimal that it
is barely present.
The narrative involves a poor father (Hossein Mahjoub) who feels unable
to cope with his bright, brave blind boy, so he takes the boy to his
paternal grandmother to live.  The boy's sisters already live with her.
The movie consists of small vignettes.  A typical one concerns a baby
bird, which Mohammad hears crying in the grass.  Digging slowly, he
locates the bird under some leaves.  Using his acute sense of hearing,
he climbs a tree until he discovers the mother bird wailing away in her
nest.  After uniting mother and son, Mohammad slowly retreats to the
relative safety of the ground.
Most scenes celebrate the joys of the Iranian countryside, where the
film is set.  Clouds float by, woodpeckers peck and rain pours.  The
problem with all of this pastoral beauty is that, with the absence of
much dialog, the picture is frequently sleep inducing.
The gripping ending makes the film much more intense than its PG rating
would imply.  Nevertheless, it is the best part of the movie.
THE COLOR OF PARADISE runs 1:30.  The film is in Persian with English
subtitles.  It is rated PG for thematic elements and would be fine for
kids around 11 and up.

THE COLOR OF PARADISE (1999) / ** 1/2
   aka RANG-E KHODA [Farsi; English subtitles]
Directed by Majid Majidi, from his screenplay. Starring Mohsen Ramezani,
Hossein Mahjoub, Salime Feizi. Running time: 90 minutes. Rated PG for
frightening scenes by the MFCB. Reviewed on November 7th, 2000.
To the best of my knowledge, "The Color Of Paradise" is the first Iranian
film to be screened in a Newfoundland cinema. I confess that I had little
idea what to expect heading into the showing. My general impression of
Iran, as a country, is less than favorable. I was raised during the
Iran-Iraq war and the reign of the Ayatollah Khomeini; when I reflect on
Iran, my first thought is of the infamous death threat made by the former
Ayatollah against author Salman Rushdie because of the content of his
book "The Satanic Verses".
But it would be a mistake for me to tar all Iranians with the same
brush. And indeed, "The Color Of Paradise" is a film totally divorced from
such international scandal. It is a very small, quiet, spiritual movie, as
far removed from world politics as it is possible to be. This is a story
not of political war or religious fanaticism, but of one sightless boy and
the way his blindness helps him to see God better than anyone else in his
life.
As the film opens, we are introduced to young Mohammad (Mohsen Ramezani),
who attends a school for the blind in Tehran. Classes have ended for the
year (city schools are better than rural schools, Mohammad later tells his
sisters, because they close earlier) and his father, Hashem, is supposed
to come and bring him home. But for a long time, Mohammad's father does
not come. When he finally does, it is a joyless reunion -- Hashem (Hossein
Mahjoub) asks the school officials to keep Mohammad for the summer. It
transpires that Mohammad's father, a widower, fears that having a blind
son around will impair his chances of finding a new wife, something he
wants very desperately.
Ultimately, Hashem is compelled to bring his son home. There, Mohammad
enjoys a happier existence around his two young sisters and his beloved
Granny (Salime Feizi). But Hashem eventually manages to pawn Mohammad off
on a blind carpenter (Morteza Fatemi), who agrees to take the boy in as an
apprentice. This decision precipitates an upheaval in the lives of all
Mohammad's family, and poses the question of who is truly blind -- the boy
or his father?
What is most striking about "The Color Of Paradise" is the way
writer/director Majid Majidi and cinematographer Mohammad Davudi have
managed to capture the simple beauty of northern Iran. Be it the humble
splendour of children playing in an alfalfa field, or the furious vista of
a summer rainstorm, the countryside is brought to vivid life, and is as
much a character as any of the people inhabiting the film.
This is accentuated by Mohammad Reza Delpak's excellent work on the
soundtrack. To reflect the enhancement of young Mohammad's other senses in
compensation for his blindness, the noises of the Iranian environment is
made as vital as its appearance. The movie is filled with the sounds of
nature, from the easily identifiable -- such as a woodpecker hammering at
a tree -- to the more mysterious and exotic. It brings a new dimension to
the movie, and demonstrates just how important and effective sound can be,
if handled skillfully.
Ramezani does terrific work here for such a young actor, delivering a very
natural performance as Mohammad. When the boy cries during an emotional
conversation with the carpenter, his grief is heartfelt and sincere.
Ramezani is not overly cloying or cute; even a rather sentimental scene in
which he rescues a baby bird which has fallen from its nest is not
overplayed. Ramezani makes Mohammad believable.
Less successful is Mahjoub, whose demeanour borders at times on the
preposterous. Majidi is wise not to portray Hashem as an entirely
villainous figure -- his motives in seeking a new wife are sincere, even
if his methods leave a lot to be desired. But Mahjoub cannot hope to 
compare to his young co-star's visceral portrayal, and this leaves Hashem
seeming weak and underdeveloped. Whereas Ramezani embodies his character,
Mahjoub feels very much like nothing more than an actor playing a role.
But although Majidi does an excellent job with the general presentation of
"The Color Of Paradise", he is less successful in its actual development.
These sorts of movies need a steady progression to maintain viewer
interest, but Majidi's story just stops for long stretches of time. As a
result, "The Color Of Paradise" makes for far less compelling watching
than it ought to, and indeed the pacing is so somnabulent in places that I
found myself almost disinterested. There just does not appear to be enough
substance in the movie to support its feature-length running time; I think
Majidi would have been far better served by transforming it into a short
film.
Also unfortunate is the movie's ending, which is so contrived as to strain
belief. It does, at least, deliver with an appropriate and moving pay-off 
which perfectly reflects the film's themes. But this is one of those cases
when you can see the puppeteer's strings; the events of "The Color Of
Paradise"'s climax appear to happen not because they are a natural
development, but simply because they were required to end the movie.
As such, "The Color Of Paradise" ends up being a well-intentioned movie
bogged down by clumsy filmmaking. Young people, who are presumably its
target audience, will likely be particularly bored by its slow movement
and lack of interesting characters (beyond Mohammad, of course).
Ramezani's performance and the beautiful imagery are commendable, though,
and ensure that a viewing of "The Color Of Paradise" is a memorable
experience.

Susan Granger's review of "THE COLOR OF PARADISE" (Sony Pictures Classics)
Majid Majidi's "Children of Heaven," about two children who
share the same well-worn pair of sneakers, received an Oscar
nomination for Best Foreign Film last year, yet it never had a
national release. However, this new entry by the Iranian film-maker is
being exhibited nationally. Mohsen Ramezani stars as Mohammed, a blind
eight year-old, who senses that his presence hinders the courtship by
his widowed father (Hossein Mahjub), a poor coal worker, of a much
younger new bride (Masoomeh Zeinti) with a bountiful dowry. Not that
the child is alone. He has a grandmother and two sisters who try to
cheer his spirits - and he spends much of the year at a special school
for the handicapped in Tehran. But the primal frustration and
emotional conflict eventually explode - on both sides. As a side note:
the child actor Mohsen Ramezani is also sightless. Which is
particularly poignant since Majid Majidi's seductively pastoral
cinematic world is splashed with vibrant color as well as the sounds
of nature. But it's what he touches and hears that makes Mohsen
recognize the message of a woodpecker, "read" the stones at the bottom
of a mountain creek, and respond to the rustle of leaves to discover
that a baby bird has fallen from its nest - right into the danger of a
cat. And you realize the lonely boy's innate courage when he carefully
climbs the tree with the chick in his pocket to place it back in its
nest. Along with "Children of Heaven," "The White Balloon," and "Taste
of Cherry," "The Color of Paradise" is a touching, memorable
contemporary Iranian film that focuses on imagery of the simple, quiet
faith and poignant innocence of children. On the Granger Movie Gauge
of 1 to 10, "The Color of Paradise" is a haunting, heart-breaking
9. It's in Farsi with English subtitles.

   The 16th Century French writer Henri Estienne once said
"Dieu mesure le froid a la brebis tondue," which translates
as "God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb."  Similarly,
Mahatma Gandhi insisted in the last century that God
reserves a special spot in His heart for the untouchables,
whom he called harijan--children of God.  Does the
Almighty really retain a special rank for those who through
no fault of their own suffer great misfortune?  That notion
is tested severely in Majid Majidi's "Color or Paradise," a
cinematically glorious, emotionally heartwrenching film that
deserves the accolades it garnered at the New York and
Toronto film festivals.  Majidi follows up on his big box
office success "Children of Heaven," his 1997 tale of a
young boy trying to replace his sister's pink shoes, a movie
showing the importance of family and honor which became
Iran's first Oscar contender for Best Foreign Language
film.  His current work centers like that one on an eight-
year-old boy--this time on one who cannot yet believe that
he is one of God's chosen.  Blind since birth, young
Mohammad (Mohsen Ramezani) attends a school for the
sightless in Tehran, but when the three-months' summer
vacation begins, he rightly suspects that his father,
Hashem (Hossein Mahjoub), would like to discard him.
   Majidi is not unlike Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the French
philosopher who in his "Emile" extolled children as
creatures of nature, uncorrupted by the complexities of the
world including its politics, hatreds, and other evils.  Early
on, we wonder though about Mohammad.  As he awaits
his father, he wanders about the school grounds, hissing
away a cat and even throwing a rock to scare the feline
animal away for good.  But we see why.  Using his acute
sense of hearing (presumably one of God's ways of
tempering the handicap of sightlessness), Mohammad
feels about the ground until he discovers a young chick
that had fallen out of his nest.  Climbing a tree with great
difficulty, he lovingly replaces the bird in his home.
   Majidi's attention shifts regularly from the boy to his
father, a self-pitying, middle-aged coal worker in northern
Iran who lives with his aging mother and his two young,
cheerful daughters.  At one point during a rainstorm, he
whimpers and cries out to Granny (Salime Feizi),
wondering about the very existence of God--who has made
him a widower and has given him a handicapped son.  We
discover later on that Hashem's dilemma is not that he is
unable to take care of the boy but that the child's existence
could threaten his proposed marriage to a much younger
woman (Masoomeh Zeinati), whose own father looks to a
future in which his daughter would be burdened with the
care of an old and sickly husband.
   Mohammad, then, despite his blindness and his
desolation at the thought that nobody loves him because of
his condition, lives in a happier world than his father. 
Attuned to nature, Mohammad joyfully witnesses the
sounds of woodpeckers in the forest chipping away at
trees in much the way that the local blind carpenter
(Morteza Fatemi) sculpts with his wood.  He glories in the
song of the seagulls which dart about among the rapids of
the starkly beautiful hilltops of the northern countryside
while his grandma, who shares the simplicity of rural life,
returns a trapped fish to deeper waters just as her
grandson had saved the life of a little bird.
   While Majidi's 1997 "Children of Heaven" was filmed
exclusively in Tehran, the writer-director opens us to the
glories of nature in his present work, featuring the rushing
rapids of the local river, the mist that forms among the
many hills, the land which seems removed by centuries
from the dust and traffic and commerce of the capital city. 
The final moment is a quiet blockbuster, if you will,
vindicating the story that leads up to a striking image. 
"Color of Paradise" lets us know in this painfully exquisite
labor of love that we may doubt God's existence from time
to time given the many tragedies that befall us, but when
the chips are down, we know that He is with us.
Not Rated.  Running Time: 90 minutes.  (C) 2000
