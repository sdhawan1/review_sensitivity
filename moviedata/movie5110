Susan Granger's review of "SISTER MARY EXPLAINS IT ALL" (Showtime TV)
          On-stage, I've been amused by Christopher Durang's biting, one-act black comedy about a teaching nun's former students who return after 20 years to perform a pageant at her popular Christmas lecture with the intention of confronting and embarrassing her. Supposedly, they are all dysfunctional with unresolved personal issues because her teachings failed to protect them from the pain and suffering of becoming adults. Soon the entire assemblage is caught in the middle of their unexpected challenge to Sister Mary's own particular orthodoxy and must witness how faith, when misapplied or taken to extremes, can prove to be fatal. But this crass, heavy-handed satire, directed by long-time Woody Allen-collaborator Marshall Brickman, underscores the virulent anti-Catholic theme and Diane Keaton's characterization of Sister Mary is particularly venomous and malicious. The quartet of former students includes Laura San Giacomo, Brian Benben, Wallace Langham and Jennifer Tilly - t!
alented actors who tussle with the unpleasant characters they're playing. As the lecture progresses, Sister Mary is increasingly more scary as she explains church doctrine and answers stereotypical questions about her family, sin, heaven and hell. Seven year-old Thomas (Max Morrow), her current favorite student, obediently recites the catechism and helps with the uncomfortable presentation. "Sister Mary Explains It All" premieres exclusively on Showtime, Sunday night, May 27th at 8 p.m. My advice is to avoid this unpleasant and abrasive experience which emerges as an insulting travesty of Catholic teaching.
