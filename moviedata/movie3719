   If you and your spouse wanted to go on vacation for a couple of
weeks, say, a drive to Reno or Vegas, how would you want to
go...just the two of you?  Go with an escorted tour?  Pick up your
best buddies, the couple you hang out with regularly?  Probably
that last option would be ideal.  How could you miss?  You all get
along, you have others to talk to and kid around with during the
drive of several days (if you choose to go by land).  But there's a
danger in that.  If two people become irritated with each other that
one's thing. Cart your pals with you and your annoyances are an
open book, and besides you can double your pain just easily as
you double your pleasure.  Roy (Patrick Swayze) and Candy
(Charlize Theron) found that out when they hooked up with the
favorite buddies Lonnie Earl (Billy Bob Thornton) and Darlene
(Natasha Richardson), picking up a brand new SUV and heading
from their home town outside Little Rock, Arkansas for Reno, the
Greatest Little City in the World.  They're armed with an AAA
triptik, to which we in the audience are made privy as director
Jordan Brady from time to time flashes a cute area map onto the
screen and we follow the bouncing vehicle on its way out west.  
   What makes the journey fraught with extra peril is that Lonnie
Earl is enjoying an affair with Roy's wife, Darlene; well actually just
two tosses in the hay if we are to believe his confession later on. 
Why did Lonnie Earl find it necessary to take up with his best
friend's wife?  If we believe his side of the story--which we might
depending on our interpretation of the four-way relationship--
Lonnie Earl's wife Darlene is not particularly the giving kind. She
comes across as fairly cold, whining occasionally, and judging by
the flamboyant way that Candy jumps into the motel pool followed
by Darlene's tentative steps into the water, I'm inclined to support
that view.
   "Waking up in Reno," which is so named because in that city
the four people are stirred out of their lethargy to reconsider their
relationships with one another, is a slight affair so to speak, an
inconsequential road-and-buddy romantic comedy which purports
to show that you don't always need a marriage counselor to learn
where change is necessary.  Just lock yourslef up, in effect, with
another couple for a week or so on what is billed as a carefree
vacation and watch the sparks fly.  One of the problems with Brent
Briscoe's and Mark  Fauser's story is its cop-out ending, a finale
which not even a TV soap would stoop to use.  The ubiquitous
Charlize Theron (whom I saw on the screen just last night at a
screening of "The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"),  looks ravishing
(as though one needs to say this) whie Patrick Swayze gets a role
that's so underplayed he appears generic.  Natasha Richardson
spends too much time looking literally like a farmer in Reno with
Levi's type overalls while Billy Bob Thornton has been known to
appear in more challenging roles.
