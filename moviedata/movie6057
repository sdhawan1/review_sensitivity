HEARTBREAKERS (2001) 2 stars out of 4. Starring Sigourney Weaver,
Jennifer Love Hewitt, Gene Hackman, Jason Lee, Ray Liotta, Nora Dunn and
Anne Bancroft. Written by Robert Dunn and Paul Guay & Stephen Mazur.
Directed by David Mirkin. Rated PG-13.
 Heartbreakers is one of those movies that tries to be all things to all
people and in the process disappoints.
 On one level, Heartbreakers is a wonderful farce about a veteran con
woman who tries to seduce an older, rich man into marriage so she can
gain his fortune.
 On another level, it's a gooey love story about a
tough-as-nails-on-the-outside-but-tenderhearted-on-the-inside younger
con woman who falls in love with a regular guy causing conflicts about
her living the grifterís life.
 Heartbreakers stars Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt as a
mother-daughter con team. Mom woos and weds them, daughter arranges a
seduction that mom can conveniently catch so she can collect a large
divorce settlement.
 Daughter wants to branch out on her own, but due to circumstances
beyond both womenís control they are forced to work together one last
time to try for the big score.
 They travel to Palm Beach in order to land a sucker.
 Mom sets her sights on William B. Tensy, a tobacco tycoon, played in
grand style by Gene Hackman.
 Hackman, as Tensy ó a cigarette constantly dangling from his lips ó
hacks, coughs and wheezes his way through his part. He seems to be
having a ball.
 And the scenes between him and Weaver, masquerading as a Russian
émigré, are the best in the film as she mangles her English and fakes
being charmed by this geriatric Lothario.
 Hewittís material is weaker as she vacillates between hard-bitten
bamboozler and love-smitten ingenue. Plus, Jack (Jason Lee), the guy she
falls in love with, is bland and rather dull.
 The possible reason for this schism is that three writers ó Robert
Dunn, Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur ó worked on this project.
Heartbreakers plays as if each ó Dunn working alone, and Guay and Mazur
teaming up ó concentrated on a specific character for director David
Mirkin who, afterward, merely melded the two disjointed scripts.
 Heartbreakers is a weak movie, one of wasted potential. It had the
makings of a great farce, but plays as if someone chickened out and
diluted the more biting story with an overdose of sweetness.
 As it stands, though, it is very enjoyable watching Weaver. As she has
shown in movies such as Working Girl and Galaxy Quest, she is very
comfortable at comedy. Her scenes with Hackman as well as with the other
men she ensnares ó most notably Ray Liotta ó come close to classic
screwball.
 Only in her scenes with Hewitt, when she tries to act motherly, does
the chemistry fail.
 Hewitt is lovely to watch, but her character is rather ill-defined. She
spends a lot of time complaining and whining, and it is difficult to
understand what Jack sees in this self-centered young woman.
 Hackman and Weaver are worth the price of admission. Unfortunately, you
have to sit through the rest of the movie to appreciate them.

The problem with a movie like Heartbreakers is that as hard as you try
to concentrate on the notable qualities of the film -- the clever
camerawork, the strong ensemble acting, the deft script -- every time
Jennifer Love Hewitt walks into a scene, her breasts take over.  Even my
date noticed the blatant attempts by the filmmakers in drawing all
attention to the chests of both Sigourney Weaver and Hewitt.  Alas, all
those breasts are never fully revealed -- like some bad 80's teen horror
film censored by Jerry Falwell.
Despite the massive amounts of boob time in Heartbreakers, the film
delivers all the goods of a solid comedic vehicle.  Max (Weaver) and
Page (Hewitt) are a mother/daughter team who swindle rich guys out of
their dollars in a con involving matrimony vows, extramarital trysts,
and divorce settlements.  Sort of like a cross between Anywhere but Here
and The Grifters.  With the IRS hot on their proverbial tails, the duo
team up for one last job, bilking cigarette tycoon William B. Tensy
(Gene Hackman) out of his cash.  Alas, during the con job, Page ends up
falling in love with a local bar owner (Jason Lee), a dead body ends up
in their trunk, Princess Leia shows up as a divorce attorney, and a
jilted ex-husband (Ray Liotta) shows up waving a gun and advising group
therapy for everyone.
The glue that holds this familiar story together lies in the actors
involved in the production.  Hackman delivers a memorable performance as
the wheezing, hacking, brown-toothed William B. Tensy.  Jason Lee, one
of the best young actors working in Hollywood these days, brings a warm,
subtle touch to his role of the lovelorn bar owner head-over-heels in
love with Page.  Weaver delivers another knockout comedic punch as the
protective mother Max.  And Hewitt actually pulls together a credible
acting job despite the screen time she has to share with her breasts.
The best work in the film is given by Ray Liotta, the most intense man
ever to grace the screen.  He has the uncanny ability to take one- or
two-dimensional roles, in such films as Cop Land, Hannibal, and No
Escape, and turn in an outstanding, memorable job.  The only problem is
that I'm still trying to forget about his roles in Turbulence and
Muppets from Space.
Despite the positives, Heartbreakers does have its minor flaws.  The
"protective mother" scenario drags on for too long, and the complete and
total ignorance of every male in the film over Max and Page's con jobs
is a bit too hard to swallow.  And not that I'm complaining, but who
wears skintight dresses every day of the year?
In a nutshell, though, this is a love story.  Beneath all the lying, the
cheating, the backstabbing, the hacking coughs, and the cleavage we find
a familiar tale of true love.  How sweet it is.

 HEARTBREAKERS (director: David Mirkin; screenwriters: Robert Dunn/Paul
 Guay/ Stephen Mazur; cinematographer: Dean Semler; editor: William
 Steinkamp; cast: Sigourney Weaver (Angela Nardino/ Max Conners/Ulga
 Yevanova), Jennifer Love Hewitt (Wendy/Page Conners/Jane Helstrom),
 Ray Liotta (Dean Cumanno/Vinny Staggliano), Jason Lee (Jack Withrowe),
 Anne Bancroft (Gloria Vogal/Barbara), Nora Dunn (Housekeeper), Gene
 Hackman (William B. Tensy), Michael Hitchcock (Dr. Davis); Runtime:
 120; MGM; 2001)
Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt are mother-and-daughter con
artists. Their scheme is for mom, a sexy fortysomething, to marry a rich
man after a short courtship and then get her curvaceous daughter, a
twentysomething, to entice the new husband to make sexual advances
toward her and mom thereby gets a quickie divorce settlement when he
succumbs to the enticements with mom viewing it. Then the deadly duo
finds a new target, using different names and disguises. It results in
laughs that are engineered from the lowest common denominator of comedy.
But the good news is, that there are laughs to be had, if you are
willing to bite into the over-the-top performances, the unseamly sight
gags, and absurd plot. The bad news is, the film is sympathetic to these
revolting hustlers and the film's amoral theme is hard to justify,
except to say that this is just a cartoon for adults. It also begins to
drag, as the premise grows weary from overkill.
Their latest victim is Ray Liotta, a chop-shop operator from New Jersey
and a womanizer who lusts for Weaver, that is until on their wedding
night she passes out from too much drink. Hewitt, his new office worker,
tempts him when he returns to the office during his wife's wedding night
sleeping attack. She bends down and shows him her lovely ass and big
boobs sticking out of her skimpy outfit, arousing him to the point of
pouncing on her and then getting caught in a compromising position just
as mom walks in, recovered from her wedding night blues.
The divorce settlement is $300,000 and a Mercedes-Benz, but it's not
enough to pay off the IRS according to an agent (Anne Bancroft), who
closes mom's bank account. The petulant daughter wanted out of the
partnership, anxious to go on her own con jobs, which is the reason why
mom arranged for the phony con artist IRS agent, her old friend who
taught her the ropes. She does this to keep Hewitt with her, even if it
is a dysfunctional relationship she is trying to save, one filled with
all the signs of a Freudian-like mother-daughter rivalry. Needing a big
score, the con women head to Palm Beach, Florida to lure tobacco tycoon
Gene Hackman, whom mom sees as a disgusting man on his last legs that
they can get millions from. But, while mom pretends to be an exotic
Russian to catch the chain-smoking and constantly coughing and wheezing
Hackman's interest, daughter falls for the only nice guy in the film,
Jason Lee, who owns the restaurant he is a bartender in and owns the
piece of waterfront property the restaurant sits on, that is worth
$3,000,000. She wavers back and forth on whether his love for her is
sincere or if he's just goofy, as she decides whether to con him or not.
"Heartbreakers" is a forgettable fluff film, that tries unsuccessfully
to work its way to romance and also be a caper flick. It works best when
showing off the boobs of Weaver and Hewitt, who are outfitted in dresses
sluts would wear to walk the streets, as the film proudly relies on the
old adage, that sex sells. There were a number of funny bits, and they
came from Hackman's W. C. Fields-like performance, calling out for the
love of smoking and preaching its virtues, even encouraging children to
take up smoking. In one scene he blows smoke into a parrot's cage and it
soon keels over. The rest of the comedy was delivered by Liotta's
enthusiastic over-the-top way of doing things, whether fishing by firing
a gun into the ocean, ditching a corpse New Jersey-style, or by
preparing for sex while almost completely naked and tied to the
bedposts. What the comedy had going for it, was a lot of spunk, enough
to overlook the film's many drawbacks.

The swirling sick feeling hit me just a few minutes into
"Heartbreakers." Ray Liotta's character was making out with his
secretary when his new wife knocked on the door of his office. While
scrambling to collect himself, he frantically shouted to her, "Just wait
a sex  er, I mean sec!"
I was struck by a wave of revulsion, thinking, "Geez, didn't lines like
that die when 'Three's Company' was canceled?" Over the next few
minutes, as the barely double entendres and lingering cleavage shots
grew more numerous, I realized that the mindset behind "Heartbreakers"
predated "Three's Company." Suddenly, I had an out-of-body experience as
my internal Way-Back machine swept me to the mid-1960s. All across
America, the counter-culture was growing like wildfire, but there was
scant evidence of it on TV. While young people were challenging
traditional values on the streets, frustrated teenagers like me were
stuck at home, sulking while our parents enjoyed the latest Bob Hope
special. Women in skimpy bathing suits would prance onscreen while Hope
made growling noises and leered at their breasts. On another channel,
Dean Martin made wisecracks about "booze and broads" and Peter Lawford,
decked out in love beads and a Nehru jacket, purred suggestive
one-liners as he ogled the go-go dancers.
"Heartbreakers" reeks of that stagnant mentality, from its lingering
shots of Jennifer Love Hewitt's vah-vah-voom breasts to its leaden
screenplay, which paints women as haughty schemers and men as drooling
buffoons too sex-obsessed to realize they are being manipulated. In
addition to Liotta and Hewitt, the cast includes Sigourney Weaver, Gene
Hackman, Jason Lee, Nora Dunn and Anne Bancroft. I can't imagine what
drew performers of their caliber to this project. Perhaps they thought
it was a parody of the sniggering sex comedies of the '60s. If so, they
were sadly mistaken.
The story revolves around a mother-daughter con-team. It opens with the
marriage of Max (Weaver) to Dean (Liotta), a New Jersey chop shop
operator. Having withheld sex until the honeymoon, Max pretends to pass
out on their wedding night. The next morning, she feigns illness,
sending a very horny Dean off to the office, where he ends up in the
arms of his new secretary. Just as the two are about to get overtly
physical, Max bursts into the room and catches them. The "horrified"
bride dissolves the union, garnering a healthy cash settlement along the
way. Of course, the secretary was really her daughter Page (Hewitt) and
the whole thing was a set-up.
The women move on, but an IRS agent (Bancroft) catches up with them and
demands a huge amount of money to cover unpaid taxes. In desperate need
of funds, Max and Page head for Palm Beach to replay the scam. Their
mark this time is William B. Tensy (Hackman, in hideous make-up), a
decrepit tobacco tycoon obsessed with the joys of smoking. Max starts to
put the game into action, but Page is so repelled by the old man (and
angry with her mom) that she slips off to enact her own score, targeting
Jack, a laid back young beach bar owner who is worth a fortune.
Complications arise when Page realizes that good-natured Jack is
stirring actual emotions in her steely little heart. As if that wasn't
enough, Dean reappears on the scene with revenge on his mind.
The attempt to weld a romance onto a caper comedy served only to remind
me of the infinitely superior "A Fish Called Wanda." I won't bother to
compare the two. Suffice to say that everything done right in "Wanda" is
done wrong here. "Heartbreakers" is soulless, inept and, at 123 minutes,
at least a half-hour too long. Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt
throw themselves into their parts, but have nowhere to go with the
metallic characters. Gene Hackman is utterly wasted in a one-note,
one-joke part that has him doing nothing but smoking, coughing and
waxing rhapsodic about smoking and sex. Poor Jason Lee is stuck in the
ingenue role and the normally charismatic actor comes off as merely
bland. Ray Liotta manages to squeeze a tiny bit of humanity and humor
into his walking cliché, but only a bit.
The low point in the film has Weaver employing a Russian accent bad
enough to make Boris and Natasha wince, while doing half-assed slapstick
with a broken off penis from a statue. Bear in mind, though, that this
is merely the worst segment of a movie made up of nothing but low
points. If you remember Bob Hope specials with fondness, this might be
your cup of tea. As for me, I'm going to watch "A Fish Called Wanda" now
and try to forget I ever saw "Heartbreakers."

Max (Sigourney Weaver) lures wealthy men into marriage so daughter Page 
(Jennifer Love Hewitt) can seduce them and the duo can cash in on a quick 
settlement.  Page is itching to con solo, so mom sets up a bankruptcy ruse
to ensure her cooperation for one, last big Palm Beach score in
"Heartbreakers."
This female rendition of "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" doesn't break any new
ground, but is more entertaining than it has any right to be due to its
talented cast who are clearly enjoying their own shenanigans.
The film opens at Max's marriage to Dean Cummano (Ray Liotta), a formerly
womanizing chop shop owner who clearly adores her.  Max plays Dean hilariously,
dancing til dawn before slipping off into champagne-induced snoring on
their wedding night.  The next morning a contrite Max makes a nauseous dash
to the bathroom, so Dean decides to drop in at the office before embarking on
their honeymoon.  There, planted as his new secretary is Page, with lethal
cleavage, a skirt barely covering her butt, and a propensity for dropping
things.  Max discovers the two in a compromising position and makes off with
her new Mercedes and 300 grand.
After getting busted by the IRS (which turns out to be a mother to daughter
scam played by old buddy Anne Bancroft), the two head to Palm Springs and
pick William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman), a billionarie tobacco man, as their
next sting.  While Max reinvents herself as Russian Olga at an auction, Page
tries to set up her own mark, but instead gets entangled with local bartender
Jack (Jason Lee, "Almost Famous"), who, she's informed, owns the bar and
the two million dollar parcel of land its situated on.  Meanwhile, Dean
decides he can't live without his ex-wife and makes his way to Florida.
As written by Robert Dunn, Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur, "Heartbreakers" is
a fairly typical slapstick caper comedy which would have been pretty limp
in lesser hands (and indeed, Love Hewitt's on again, off again seduction of
Jack paints her as a psychotic harpy and becomes annoying).  Director David
Mirkin ("Romy and Michele's High School Reunion") lets his cast of pros
run with it, though, to surprisingly entertaining results.
Sigourney Weaver, looking smashing at 50, revels as the femme fatale
whose early abandonment when pregnant makes her overprotective of her
daughter's potential romantic entanglements.  An early bet between Max
and Page to get an unsuspecting dupe (Kevin Nealon) to buy one of them a
drink has Max hilariously trump Page with smarts over youthful sex appeal.
Put on the spot at a Russian eatery, 'Olga' pays off a wised up waiter
(Yakov Smirnoff) and ditches a Russian folk song to deliver a campy
version of 'Back in the U.S.S.R.'  
Liotta puts a comic spin on past wiseguy performances and turns up the
notch on physical comedy.  He's terrific, even bringing warmth to his
character.  Gene Hackman is riotously repulsive as the constantly smoking 
billionaire.  The always likeable Jason Lee's laid back lover is such a
nice guy it's a bit of a head scratcher why he'd fall for Page, although
he presumably can see the softness beneath the brittle surface.  Love
Hewitt proves herself as a pratfaller and mostly keeps her own among this
cast of seasoned pros.  Nora Dunn adds some sharpness as Tensey's maid.
Luxurious locations and inventive costuming give the film nice eye appeal.
Original music by John Debney and the theme by Danny Elfman provide jaunty
accents.
"Heartbreakers" doesn't take us anywhere new, but provides a surprisingly
enjoyable 123 minutes.

Cleavage goes a long way. It's how a mother-daughter con team consisting of Max
(Sigourney Weaver) and Paige (Jennifer Love Hewitt) get their way with rich men.
Through careful selection, the two move from town to town exploiting innocent
creeps for big moola. Max seduces and marries them. Paige seduces and tempts
them. Soon after comes a large settlement. Their biggest and final challenge
lies ahead in Palm Beach. The two must work fast to reach an IRS deadline, as
Max has been less than prompt with the past eight year's worth of tax returns.
Simultaneously working a near-death, hacking tobacco tycoon (Gene Hackman), and
a young, potentially wealthy beach bar owner (Jason Lee), the duo move toward
the last con, with Paige's need for independence from her wacky mother growing
stronger by the day.
About that cleavage again, there certainly is plenty of it. By the halfway
point, the top halves of both breast sets should be quite familiar to the
audience. So should respective neighbors like the inner thighs and behind. The
flaunting sexuality is for the goggle-eyes of men, but these ladies are in
control of the entire species. It's their own lives where they lose course. They
conquer any obstacle because they are brilliant con-women. It's a hoot to watch
all the different ways Paige and Max will avoid paying for things like a meal or
a hotel stay. Conning is second nature to them, a great way to live life.
`Heartbreakers' is a comedy that's content to browse and poke its nose into
several genres of its pleasing. It doesn't work as the romance it tries to
become, but suits itself as one of the finer situation comedies in recent
memory. The last good-hearted comedy that didn't mock or make fun of its
characters was `Bring it On'. The film evokes just as many laughs with
sophistication, but lacks the same fast-paced editing.
At 123 minutes long, `Heartbreakers' is in major need of a chop down. It isn't
very succinct, and tends to lag. It has a problem with taking too long to set-up
locations and motivations, which doesn't work when it wants to pull the rug from
the audience's feet.
Sigourney and Jennifer are very believable as family. They look nothing like
each other, but their talents fill in the bond. After a long absence, and a very
bad TV movie, Jennifer Love Hewitt shows a high level of skill. Hewitt is often
miscast, despite her gifts. I suggest she have a serious talk with her agent
immediately. Sigourney Weaver shows she still has flair to burn, and that
`Alien: Resurrection' was just a serious case of bad judgment.
You will laugh and have a good time at `Heartbreakers'. It is a very funny movie
with some great scenes, and the actors have a blast with their roles. There
comes, though, when some inconsistency just can't be overlooked. As an example,
gay men and police have apparently no existence in this film's world. 
It's the perfect rental, and a good date movie. See it, smile, and inhale the
feeling of thoughtless fun at the movies. Just don't expect all your needs
fulfilled.
Disclaimer: I may have missed several plot details and jokes in `Heartbreakers'
because this film marks the first time I was physically attacked during a movie.
Isn't life wonderful?

   Joan Baez, while hardly a stay-at-home woman, loved to
sing the lyrics of Marty Tipton's Appalachian folk song
during the seventies: "Hard is the fortune of all womankind,/
She's always controlled, she's always confined,/ Controlled by
her parents until she's a wife,/ A slave to her husband all the
rest of her life."  This was obviously before she saw the
movie "Heartbreakers," definitive proof that men are the
weaker sex--or, as Harry Belafonte would chime in, "Put the
man and the woman together, to see which one is smarter,"
coming the conclusion that the latter will always emerge
victorious.
  "Heartbreakers could be called the women's revenge for
Frank Oz's 1988 comedy, "Dirty Rotten Scoundels," which
despite the presence of Oscar ceremony host Steve Martin is
no more than a pleasant parody about a male con artist who
takes women for a ride.  A better one, Preston Sturges's "The
Lady Eve," featured Barbara Stanwyck as a ripoff maestro
who makes the moves on the wealthy Henry Fonda.
    The David Mirkin ("Romy and Michel's High School
Reunion") story is of two strong women not unaccustomed to
twisting men about their fingers by setting them up in a scam
which, looking at its possibilities in the real world, simply
would not result in capturing any bucks at all.  The
mother-daughter team of Angela Nardino (Sigourney Weaver)
and Wendy (Jennifer Love Hewitt) sets up men by having
them fall in love with and marrying mom who, finding
an excuse not to consummate the union on the wedding
night, arranges to have her little girl organize them into a
compromising position.  Caught in the act (although nothing
really happens), the men come across with fat settlements
rather than have the cases go before a court which--in at
least one case--would have the effect of ruining a crooked
guy's profitable business.
   The film was a big surprise for me as I had gone into this
thinking it would be yet some more commercial pap, more
sentimental than cynical and with gags that would not
challenge the mentality of my 10-year-old terrier.  Yet
"Heartbreakers" was involving throughout its two-hour running
time and did not at all depend on the expertise of Gene
Hackman to bring it to life a half-hour into the game.
   Fans of "Hannibal" will get a kick out of seeing Ray Liotta
with his head screwed back on.  Liotta performs in the role of
a stolen-car serviceman, Dean Cumanno, who falls madly in
love with the sexy Angela only to be left high and literally dry
on his icy wedding night.  The following morning, his attention
is riveted on his pretty receptionist, Wendy, and while she is
engaging him under the desk the two are caught in the act by
the "heartbroken" Angela.  Looking to make one last score
before they hang up their uplift bras, the two hone in on
aging billionaire tobacco executive, William B. Tensy (Gene
Hackman), figuring that even if he doesn't buy the daughter's
mock seduction after marrying Angela, he might do them a
favor by dropping dead, thereby leaving them the major part
of three billion dollars.  Perpetually puffing on his product, the
liver-spotted Tensy not only kills a parrot instantly with
second-hand smoke but brags about his experiments
addicting nine-year-olds with the weed.  This movie does
more to deride the tobacco industry than Michael Mann's
"The Insider" could.
   In the film's only sentimental motif, Wendy risks falling in
love with Jack Withrowe (Jason Lee), owner of prime property
in California's Palm Beach--the very hazard that her mother
had warned her against.
   The fifty-one-year-old Sigourney Weaver never looked
better, figuratively running rings around her adorable but too
outwardly meanspirited daughter played by Hewitt.  The
mother-daughter combination works well, giving the audience
the impression of a love-hate relationship between a girl of
scarcely twenty years old wanting independence and her own
life while at the same caring deeply about her and respecting
the moneymaking schemes on which they thrive.  Jason Lee
does fine as a somewhat goofy and naive owner of a bar,
unwilling to see that he is being taken for a ride despite
ample evidence, and Saturday Night Live's Nora Dunn has a
grand moment as Miss Madress, a billionaire's housekeeper
not fond of letting any woman into the life of her aging
employer.  
   Except for Lee's character, there's no one among these
dirty rotten scoundrels that you'd want to take home (wait: I
take that back), but who cares?  This is a well-paced,
genuinely amusing piece of work that subverts the tobacco
industry as well as the more potentially deadly institution of
marriage.
Rated PG-13.  Running time: 123 minutes.  (C) 2001 by

In David Mirkin's HEARTBREAKERS, a sweet comedy which plays like a 
lighthearted version of THE GRIFTERS, Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love 
Hewitt are a mother/daughter pair of con artists.  Although they scam 
for everything from food to gas, their specialty is marriage 
settlements.  
When we first meet our connivers, Max (Weaver) is marrying Dean Cumanno 
(Ray Liotta), a respectable New Jersey chop shop owner.  When his new 
secretary, Page (Hewitt), entices him into a little oral sex, his wife 
of 18 hours arrives to catch them in the act.  "Honey, it isn't what it 
looks like here," Dean tries to explain to Max.  "Her hair got stuck in 
my zipper."  Cut to the lawyers office in which Max leaves with a chunk 
of cash and one of Dean's freshly built Mercedes.  
Although they look like Mutt and Jeff with their dramatic height 
difference, Weaver and Hewitt are a convincing and funny choice as 
relatives and rivals.  The rebellious Page thinks that Max treats her 
like a little kid, and Max thinks that Page isn't ready to go solo like 
she plans.  Their confidence games are quite believable.  Max looks like 
someone who would sweep you off your feet into an early marriage 
proposal.  And Page, with her lovely legs, micro skirts and ERIN 
BROCKOVICH-type bras that push her generous breasts skyward, looks like 
someone who might tempt even the most married of married men.  In short, 
the deliciously caustic chemistry between Weaver and Hewitt is the best 
part of the movie.  
The weakest link, other than the excessive running time, is the 
supporting cast.  Although Liotta is impressive, most of the others are 
either underutilized or miscast.  Anne Bancroft delivers a wooden 
performance as an IRS agent who forces the two crooks into their most 
ambitious scam ever.  Jason Lee (ALMOST FAMOUS), who isn't given much to 
do as the only guy with whom Page ever falls in love, phones in his 
performance.
As a cliché of a rich old geezer with yellow teeth, Gene Hackman coughs 
his way through his part as William B. Tensy, a tobacco company CEO with 
millions to burn.  If he will just live long enough to tie the knot with 
Max, she and her daughter will be able to pay their back taxes and live 
on easy street for the rest of their lives.  But Page hates the whole 
idea.  "I'm not dating the walking dead," she bitterly informs her 
mother, who replies, "we better work fast."
In Tensy's most memorable line, he reveals the secret of what really 
turns on a tobacco millionaire -- "smoke billowing out of a woman's hot, 
red nostrils."  The image almost makes the unflappable, non-smoking Max 
gag.  Gag isn't something you will do while watching this brightly 
written comedy.  HEARTBREAKERS isn't any laugh riot, but it is 
entertaining fun.  It's the sort of picture that will leave you with a 
smile on your face and a feeling that you got your money's worth.
HEARTBREAKERS runs needlessly long at 2:03.  It is officially rated 
PG-13 for sex-related content including dialogue, and with scenes of 
oral sex and bondage, this is certainly a film unsuitable for those 
under 13.

PLOT:
A mom and daughter team work together to con men into loving them, cheating
on them and then paying them upon divorce. But what happens when they
actually fall in love with their potential conquests? Find out when you
watch the movie.
CRITIQUE:
Despite its faults and "video movie" feel, I'd still slightly recommend this
movie because of its enjoyable premise, the two fun performances from Ray
Liotta and Gene Hackman, and the two other fun performances from Jennifer
Love Hewitt's breasts! C'mon everybody, let's all stand up and give those
puppies their rightful due . Okay, now
that I've gotten that out of the way, let's see what else this film had to
offer. Well, to start off with, I liked the whole mother/daughter
relationship between Weaver and Hewitt. I bought it and I liked the back and
forth bickering. I also loved the performance by Gene Hackman, who literally
stole every scene that he was in, as the old guy with a peculiar affection
for anyone who smokes. Very funny! I only wish there were more of him to go
around. Which brings me to my next point. Even though the general premise of
this movie is a good one, the filmmakers here seemed to think that over two
hours of it was required, so the last thirty minutes of the film ends up
feeling a little stretched, as the basic idea gets regurgitated over and
over again. I mean, how many times can the same guy fall for the same con?
There's also the disappearance of a very likeable character, which kind of
took me out of the movie as well.
But for the most part, the flick has enough laughs and funny moments to get
you by. The soundtrack also helps, with an upbeat tempo, and plenty of
sorted cool tunes. And being a fan of Jason Lee personally, it was also nice
to see him paying the rent as the "love interest". In fact, I even bought
most of the romance stuff between him and Jennifer Love. But despite some
stuff working in this movie, some other stuff could've been improved. The
dark nature of the film's premise could've really been milked with some
nasty black comedy, but the filmmakers decided to play the "safe card" with
this one, which is unfortunate because I really think that the extra spice
would have made this film so much better. The length of the film also hurt
its overall potency, and the ordinary nature of the comedy, which was for
the most part, so-so. I did however crack up at a few key scenes, including
one with SNL alumnus Kevin Nealon and some pretty funny lines, like the one
in which Liotta's character is asked whether he can "get rid of a dead body"
and he replies "I'm from Jersey, ain't I?" The film also has a handful of
cameos, including some small parts from Jeffrey Jones, Carrie Fisher and
Anna Bancroft. On the whole, the film is probably good-natured and safe
enough for most people to enjoy, and let's face it, nobody is going for an
Oscar here.
The film has enough laughs, entertaining co-performances from the conned men
and an interesting premise to definitely recommend on video. And as for
those contemplating a nite out at the movies with this one, I'd say to rest
your decision on whether or not you would like to see Hewitt's tremendous
figure on the big screen for two hours+ and whether or not you're just
looking for some flighty downtime. If so, then by all means, grab a box of
kleenex, a box o' nachos, a long raincoat and have a blast! And oh yeah, for
the ladies, we do get an impressive scene with Ray Liotta in his skivvies,
and uhhhh, yeah...the man's a packin'! Broke my heart, I tell ya... : )

Reviewed by Dustin Putman, March 28, 2001.
In a time when the only comedies that seem to be made are of the raunchy, 
Farrelly-esque variety, a funny, sophisticated one is quite rare these days. 
But "Heartbreakers," smartly directed by David Mirkin (1997's "Romy and 
Michele's High School Reunion"), is just that. A movie that does not wallow 
in bathroom or scatological humor, it is involving, biting, heartwarming in a 
refreshingly non-cloying way, and occasionally riotous.
Max (Sigourney Weaver) and Paige (Jennifer Love Hewitt) are a mother and 
daughter con-artist team who scam for Max to marry wealthy, unsuspecting men, 
only for Paige to seduce them in front of her, leading to a swift divorce and 
much cash flow. When their latest conquest seemingly goes off without a 
hitch, they head to Palm Beach, Florida for one last big score before Paige 
goes off on her own. They quickly set their sights on the richest man they 
can find, in the form of multimillionaire tobacco tycoon William Tensy (Gene 
Hackman). Tensy is repulsive, with cancer spots on his forehead, yellowed, 
rotting teeth, and a constant cigarette in his mouth. Max, posing as a 
beautiful Russian immigrant named Olga, bewitches him, all the while Paige 
gets a job as his new housekeeper, setting into play the type of scam that 
they are pros at. Things, however, do not go as planned for the relational, 
naturally bickering duo, threatening to expose their criminal acts.
Reminiscent of a female version of 1988's "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels," mixed 
with a comedic redux of 1990's dramatic "The Grifters," "Heartbreakers" is a 
hugely successful entertainment that plays out its story in a surprisingly 
unrushed manner that leaves the film running just over two hours (especially 
long for a comedy), but does not grow tedious once. Instead, its length aids 
in adding depth to both the characters and the different relationships, 
particularly that of the central figures, Max and Paige. A mother-daughter 
who do not always get along, but respect and stand up for one another when it 
counts, their interactions and dynamic are dead-on realistic. Best of all, 
despite some not-so-admirable things that they do throughout, Max and Paige 
remain likable and accessible to the audience. This is key in getting the 
movie to work; two nasty, annoying women would get old very fast.
As the alluring, sexy Max and the equally sultry Paige, Sigourney Weaver 
(1999's "A Map of the World") and Jennifer Love Hewitt (1998's "I Still Know 
What You Did Last Summer") have never, or rarely, been better. At 53, Weaver 
is not only physically stunning and gorgeous, but really proves to have a 
knack for the comedy genre. Her Max is an outwardly self-assured, inwardly 
insecure siren who fears the day when the only consistent person in her life, 
Paige, is gone. Their bond is obviously close, even when they argue, and in a 
life when they intentionally train themselves to stay at arm's length from 
caring about others, Paige is the only one whom Max is allowed to love. 
Holding up her half of the story just as well, Jennifer Love Hewitt has 
finally thrown her squeaky-clean, "teen" movie image out the window, acting 
as a young adult for the first time in a movie that has not a doe-eyed high 
school senior pining for her, or a hook-wielding fisherman out to kill her, 
in sight. Hewitt has surrounded herself with top-flight talent here, in a 
film that gives her ample opportunity to test out her acting chops, and she 
succeeds every step of the way.
While Max sets into motion the scam involving Tensy, Paige, out to prove to 
herself that she isn't still an amateur, targets handsome, single bartender 
Jack (Jason Lee), whose bar he owns himself is worth upwards of $3-million. 
With Jack irresistibly drawn to the sometimes difficult Paige, she grows 
scared when she finds herself guilty of doing the one thing con artists are 
never supposed to do: start to truly care about the person they are playing. 
The offbeat romance that blossoms between Paige and Jack is unforced and 
subtle, and its payoff is one of surprising emotional depth. A climactic 
sequence between the two is especially touching and well-played by both 
Hewitt and the appealing Jason Lee (1998's "Chasing Amy").
On the other hand, Max is faced with a moral dilemma that she isn't sure how 
to deal with. Realizing that Paige may very well be falling for Jack, Max 
questions whether or not she should continue to lead her daughter into a life 
of crime, or get out while there is still time to make something better for 
each of their lives. These thoughts are put into play even more when her 
previous husband, Dean (Ray Liotta), whom she conned and actually felt guilty 
about because of her own attraction to him, comes looking for her. Dean knows 
that Max swindled him out of money, but he still can't help but half-like 
her, and he's not giving up without a fight. Ray Liotta (2001's "Hannibal") 
gets another meaty role here in a picture that is graced with a superb 
ensemble cast.
It is Gene Hackman (1998's "Enemy of the State"), however, who steals the 
show. As the repugnant, if not bad guy, Tensy, Hackman hacks and coughs his 
way through a scene-stealing part that deserves Oscar consideration come next 
year. Never has Hackman been so outrageously funny, as Tensy's outlook is 
that smoking is something to be proud of, something that children should be 
started on at a very young age, and something that turns him on like nothing 
else. One of the great moments comes when Tensy proclaims, "There is nothing 
more attractive than a heavy stream of smoke billowing proudly out of a 
woman's fiery, enflared nostrils." "That image," replies Max, "will haunt me 
forever."
Max and Paige may be in an illegal profession that asks them to be cold and 
generally emotionless, but "Heartbreakers" manages to be neither of these 
things. There are enough nuances and energy in each of the actors' 
performances, and enough humanity in the screenplay, by Robert Dunn, Paul 
Guay, and Stephen Mazur, to ensure that the movie will leave you liking the 
people you've me, and feeling good. And despite one misstep in the final 
scene that almost contradicts what I thought the meaning of the film was, 
"Heartbreakers" is a sparkling comedy. It is one of the best films, thus far, 
in a year that seems to be short on quality filmmaking.

And Now For Something Completely Mindless.  And, funny.
The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
It's old one-two con: Dear Old Mom Angela (Sigourney Weaver) left-hooks
some poor fool into marrying her, then daughter Page (Jennifer Love
Hewitt) sucker-punches the schmoe by seducing him into a compromising
position, so that The Jilted Bride can collect on blackmail...er, I
mean, alimony.  All in the family, I reckon.
After snagging philandering chop-shop owner Dean Cumanno (Ray Liotta)
this way, Page wants out of the mother-daughter con game to set up her
own separate scams.  Angela doesn't think Page can hack it, but
reluctantly agrees to break up, until an IRS Agent (Anne Bancroft)
bursts their bubble.  Needing some quick cash, Page agrees to one more,
big con, so the two set off for prime Rich White Guy hunting grounds:
Palm Springs.
There, they pick out tobacco billionaire William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman)
as their new mark; the constantly-hacking Tensy seems an easy enough
mark, though Page would rather go after younger game.  But complicating
things for them both are Tensy's stern, dedicated housekeeper (Nora
Dunn) and Jack (Jason Lee), a bartender (and more?) with the hots for
Page's alter con-ego.  Could True Love be in the cards for Page?
The Upshot:
Well, it's not completely mindless.  Nope, that's MONKEYBONE territory.
HEARTBREAKERS was more like DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS with tits.  Oh boy,
am I gonna hear it for that one.
Despite all the flailing about, the ObLoveStory between Page (Love
Hewitt; LH, from now on) and Jack (Jason Lee, who I can't stop seeing as
Azrael from DOGMA.  Trust me; that's not A Good Thing.) was the least
interesting thing about HEARTBREAKERS, though I was shocked when I
realized that I actually liked both characters and their actors - taken
separately.  No, what HEARTBREAKERS had going for it was more an
ensemble groove, with each character, and actor, adding their own zesty
spice to the mix.
Sigourney Weaver, in one of her best comedic performances since WORKING
GIRL, and Ray Liotta, in one of _his_ best performances, *period*, in a
lonnnnnng time, had great comedic timing together, as did - much to my
shock - Weaver and LH (who I wouldn't have bet could Hold Weaver's
Jockstrap; thanks, Jim Hill, for that image).   As it stood, LH was much
more convincing as the put-upon condaughter, than as the Love Interest;
I could live with that, though, because the con was The Thing.  And
though his was a one-trick pony, Gene Hackman's hacky cigarette baron
character, William B. Tensy, kept me grinning for most of the movie.  I
wasn't crazy about his payoff scene, but I've gotten a lot of mileage
out of that statue [go see the flick, to catch my meaning].  The cast
seemed to get much giggles playing off each other; that translated well
to the audience, as we giggled right back.
There's not much depth to HEARTBREAKERS - certainly, nothing Exciting!
And! New!, despite the lame "I'm like this because I have Male
Abandonment Issues" subplot - but sometimes, a good laugh is its own
reward.  And lord knows, after the dismal early 2001 movie season, we
need all the rewards we can get.
The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
Um...how about the "Chick Factor" instead?
I admit I don't have much first-hand experience at being a horny guy who
has, apparently, never seen a push-up bra he didn't like, so somebody
help me out here: what is it about a curvy chick flashing her tits, that
makes guys stoopid?  I mean, didn't Julia Roberts already Go There with
"Airhead Broccoli" (or whateverthell it's called)?  Are fellas really so
desperate that all it takes is a little whiff of pus...er...femininity,
to make y'all give away the farm?  Well, somebody sure thinks y'all are,
given all the Curvy Busty Chick Snags An Idiot plots in comedies these
days.  But maybe I'm just playa-hatin' because I know I won't look half
as good as Ms. Weaver, when *I* turn 50.
Bammer's Bottom Line
No, it's not THE STING, nowhere near it.  But HEARTBREAKERS was a funny,
lighthearted comedy - and who doesn't like to laugh?
HEARTBREAKERS (rating: greenlight):
HEARTBREAKERS was a turn-your-brain-off-and-just-enjoy-it kinda flick.
Hey, everything can't be Deep, y'know?

HEARTBREAKERS (2001) 2 stars out of 4. Starring Sigourney Weaver,
Jennifer Love Hewitt, Gene Hackman, Jason Lee, Ray Liotta, Nora Dunn and
Anne Bancroft. Written by Robert Dunn and Paul Guay & Stephen Mazur.
Directed by David Mirkin. Rated PG-13.
 Heartbreakers is one of those movies that tries to be all things to all
people and in the process disappoints.
 On one level, Heartbreakers is a wonderful farce about a veteran con
woman who tries to seduce an older, rich man into marriage so she can
gain his fortune.
 On another level, it's a gooey love story about a
tough-as-nails-on-the-outside-but-tenderhearted-on-the-inside younger
con woman who falls in love with a regular guy causing conflicts about
her living the grifterís life.
 Heartbreakers stars Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt as a
mother-daughter con team. Mom woos and weds them, daughter arranges a
seduction that mom can conveniently catch so she can collect a large
divorce settlement.
 Daughter wants to branch out on her own, but due to circumstances
beyond both womenís control they are forced to work together one last
time to try for the big score.
 They travel to Palm Beach in order to land a sucker.
 Mom sets her sights on William B. Tensy, a tobacco tycoon, played in
grand style by Gene Hackman.
 Hackman, as Tensy ó a cigarette constantly dangling from his lips ó
hacks, coughs and wheezes his way through his part. He seems to be
having a ball.
 And the scenes between him and Weaver, masquerading as a Russian
émigré, are the best in the film as she mangles her English and fakes
being charmed by this geriatric Lothario.
 Hewittís material is weaker as she vacillates between hard-bitten
bamboozler and love-smitten ingenue. Plus, Jack (Jason Lee), the guy she
falls in love with, is bland and rather dull.
 The possible reason for this schism is that three writers ó Robert
Dunn, Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur ó worked on this project.
Heartbreakers plays as if each ó Dunn working alone, and Guay and Mazur
teaming up ó concentrated on a specific character for director David
Mirkin who, afterward, merely melded the two disjointed scripts.
 Heartbreakers is a weak movie, one of wasted potential. It had the
makings of a great farce, but plays as if someone chickened out and
diluted the more biting story with an overdose of sweetness.
 As it stands, though, it is very enjoyable watching Weaver. As she has
shown in movies such as Working Girl and Galaxy Quest, she is very
comfortable at comedy. Her scenes with Hackman as well as with the other
men she ensnares ó most notably Ray Liotta ó come close to classic
screwball.
 Only in her scenes with Hewitt, when she tries to act motherly, does
the chemistry fail.
 Hewitt is lovely to watch, but her character is rather ill-defined. She
spends a lot of time complaining and whining, and it is difficult to
understand what Jack sees in this self-centered young woman.
 Hackman and Weaver are worth the price of admission. Unfortunately, you
have to sit through the rest of the movie to appreciate them.

Harvey S. Karten
   Joan Baez, while hardly a stay-at-home woman, loved to
sing the lyrics of Marty Tipton's Appalachian folk song
during the seventies: "Hard is the fortune of all womankind,/
She's always controlled, she's always confined,/ Controlled by
her parents until she's a wife,/ A slave to her husband all the
rest of her life."  This was obviously before she saw the
movie "Heartbreakers," definitive proof that men are the
weaker sex--or, as Harry Belafonte would chime in, "Put the
man and the woman together, to see which one is smarter,"
coming the conclusion that the latter will always emerge
victorious.
  "Heartbreakers could be called the women's revenge for
Frank Oz's 1988 comedy, "Dirty Rotten Scoundels," which
despite the presence of Oscar ceremony host Steve Martin is
no more than a pleasant parody about a male con artist who
takes women for a ride.  A better one, Preston Sturges's "The
Lady Eve," featured Barbara Stanwyck as a ripoff maestro
who makes the moves on the wealthy Henry Fonda.
    The David Mirkin ("Romy and Michel's High School
Reunion") story is of two strong women not unaccustomed to
twisting men about their fingers by setting them up in a scam
which, looking at its possibilities in the real world, simply
would not result in capturing any bucks at all.  The
mother-daughter team of Angela Nardino (Sigourney Weaver)
and Wendy (Jennifer Love Hewitt) sets up men by having
them fall in love with and marrying mom who, finding
an excuse not to consummate the union on the wedding
night, arranges to have her little girl organize them into a
compromising position.  Caught in the act (although nothing
really happens), the men come across with fat settlements
rather than have the cases go before a court which--in at
least one case--would have the effect of ruining a crooked
guy's profitable business.
   The film was a big surprise for me as I had gone into this
thinking it would be yet some more commercial pap, more
sentimental than cynical and with gags that would not
challenge the mentality of my 10-year-old terrier.  Yet
"Heartbreakers" was involving throughout its two-hour running
time and did not at all depend on the expertise of Gene
Hackman to bring it to life a half-hour into the game.
   Fans of "Hannibal" will get a kick out of seeing Ray Liotta
with his head screwed back on.  Liotta performs in the role of
a stolen-car serviceman, Dean Cumanno, who falls madly in
love with the sexy Angela only to be left high and literally dry
on his icy wedding night.  The following morning, his attention
is riveted on his pretty receptionist, Wendy, and while she is
engaging him under the desk the two are caught in the act by
the "heartbroken" Angela.  Looking to make one last score
before they hang up their uplift bras, the two hone in on
aging billionaire tobacco executive, William B. Tensy (Gene
Hackman), figuring that even if he doesn't buy the daughter's
mock seduction after marrying Angela, he might do them a
favor by dropping dead, thereby leaving them the major part
of three billion dollars.  Perpetually puffing on his product, the
liver-spotted Tensy not only kills a parrot instantly with
second-hand smoke but brags about his experiments
addicting nine-year-olds with the weed.  This movie does
more to deride the tobacco industry than Michael Mann's
"The Insider" could.
   In the film's only sentimental motif, Wendy risks falling in
love with Jack Withrowe (Jason Lee), owner of prime property
in California's Palm Beach--the very hazard that her mother
had warned her against.
   The fifty-one-year-old Sigourney Weaver never looked
better, figuratively running rings around her adorable but too
outwardly meanspirited daughter played by Hewitt.  The
mother-daughter combination works well, giving the audience
the impression of a love-hate relationship between a girl of
scarcely twenty years old wanting independence and her own
life while at the same caring deeply about her and respecting
the moneymaking schemes on which they thrive.  Jason Lee
does fine as a somewhat goofy and naive owner of a bar,
unwilling to see that he is being taken for a ride despite
ample evidence, and Saturday Night Live's Nora Dunn has a
grand moment as Miss Madress, a billionaire's housekeeper
not fond of letting any woman into the life of her aging
employer.  
   Except for Lee's character, there's no one among these
dirty rotten scoundrels that you'd want to take home (wait: I
take that back), but who cares?  This is a well-paced,
genuinely amusing piece of work that subverts the tobacco
industry as well as the more potentially deadly institution of
marriage.

finally thrown her squeaky-clean, "teen" movie image out the window, acting 
as a young adult for the first time in a movie that has not a doe-eyed high 
school senior pining for her, or a hook-wielding fisherman out to kill her, 
in sight. Hewitt has surrounded herself with top-flight talent here, in a 
film that gives her ample opportunity to test out her acting chops, and she 
succeeds every step of the way.
While Max sets into motion the scam involving Tensy, Paige, out to prove to 
herself that she isn't still an amateur, targets handsome, single bartender 
Jack (Jason Lee), whose bar he owns himself is worth upwards of $3-million. 
With Jack irresistibly drawn to the sometimes difficult Paige, she grows 
scared when she finds herself guilty of doing the one thing con artists are 
never supposed to do: start to truly care about the person they are playing. 
The offbeat romance that blossoms between Paige and Jack is unforced and 
subtle, and its payoff is one of surprising emotional depth. A climactic 
sequence between the two is especially touching and well-played by both 
Hewitt and the appealing Jason Lee (1998's "Chasing Amy").
On the other hand, Max is faced with a moral dilemma that she isn't sure how 
to deal with. Realizing that Paige may very well be falling for Jack, Max 
questions whether or not she should continue to lead her daughter into a life 
of crime, or get out while there is still time to make something better for 
each of their lives. These thoughts are put into play even more when her 
previous husband, Dean (Ray Liotta), whom she conned and actually felt guilty 
about because of her own attraction to him, comes looking for her. Dean knows 
that Max swindled him out of money, but he still can't help but half-like 
her, and he's not giving up without a fight. Ray Liotta (2001's "Hannibal") 
gets another meaty role here in a picture that is graced with a superb 
ensemble cast.
It is Gene Hackman (1998's "Enemy of the State"), however, who steals the 
show. As the repugnant, if not bad guy, Tensy, Hackman hacks and coughs his 
way through a scene-stealing part that deserves Oscar consideration come next 
year. Never has Hackman been so outrageously funny, as Tensy's outlook is 
that smoking is something to be proud of, something that children should be 
started on at a very young age, and something that turns him on like nothing 
else. One of the great moments comes when Tensy proclaims, "There is nothing 
more attractive than a heavy stream of smoke billowing proudly out of a 
woman's fiery, enflared nostrils." "That image," replies Max, "will haunt me 
forever."
Max and Paige may be in an illegal profession that asks them to be cold and 
generally emotionless, but "Heartbreakers" manages to be neither of these 
things. There are enough nuances and energy in each of the actors' 
performances, and enough humanity in the screenplay, by Robert Dunn, Paul 
Guay, and Stephen Mazur, to ensure that the movie will leave you liking the 
people you've me, and feeling good. And despite one misstep in the final 
scene that almost contradicts what I thought the meaning of the film was, 
"Heartbreakers" is a sparkling comedy. It is one of the best films, thus far, 
in a year that seems to be short on quality filmmaking.

Some movies are bad enough to make you say, "One thousand monkeys in a room
with one thousand typewriters couldn't come up with an idea this bad."  Some
movies make you say, "I could eat a bowl of alphabet soup and throw up a
better story than this."  And then there's Heartbreakers.
The film opens with a wedding between Max (Sigourney Weaver, Galaxy Quest)
and Dean (Ray Liotta, Hannibal).  Apparently, they're waiting until their
wedding night to have sex, so he's as horny as can be.  But she falls asleep
before he can consummate the marriage, and Dean heads off to his chop shop
to tie up some loose ends before they begin their honeymoon.  17 hours after
their wedding, Max catches Dean getting oral from his receptionist Page
(Jennifer Love Hewitt, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer), files for
divorce and walks away with a wad of cash and a brand-new car.
The catch is that Max and Page are really a mother/daughter grifting team
(they're the Conners.get it?). This is the thirteenth time the
overprotective Max has participated in a phony marriage to squeeze money out
of an unsuspecting man, and it's supposed to be the last scam the two pull
as a team.  Page wants to go out on her own, but she's forced into one last
score with her mom when they learn an IRS agent (Anne Bancroft, Keeping the
Faith) has seized their bank accounts and expects another $200,000 in just
90 days.
So the two barracudas head for Palm Beach (home of the ignorant, if you
remember that little election snafu) and start casing potential marks.  Max
settles on billionaire William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman, The Replacements), a
chain smoker with baked-bean teeth who is on death's doorstep.  In the
meantime, Page sets her sights on a local bar owner named Jack (Jason Lee,
Almost Famous) whose property could be worth millions.  He's the nice guy
you know the conniving Page will eventually fall for after initially
disgusting her.
Heartbreakers is a mean-spirited comedy - a la Whipped - that thinks it can
get away with two hours of bile-spewing because its lead characters are
intelligent women who only pretend to be a couple of whores.  Imagine the
picketing if Heartbreakers was about crafty men scamming idiotic women in
the same manner.  In a good film, they'd end up getting grifted themselves,
but the script isn't even that clever.  What's more, it's implausible, too.
Extravagant weddings happen at the snap of the fingers, and the ending makes
as much sense as a New York City cabdriver.
Aside from Lee, who acts circles around Hewitt and still looks embarrassed,
everyone else seems like they've had their brains eaten (especially Liotta,
for some reason).  It's hard to tell where things went wrong, but when all
else fails, point at the writer(s).  There's three of them here, but two of
them penned the amusing Liar Liar.  Director David Mirkin is an Emmy winner
for The Simpsons, so he gets some slack.  Even the music is annoying, with
one snippet of a Danny Elfman song played until it's blue in the face.
The best part of the film is when Max has a breakdown at the end, shouting,
"I'm a horrible mother.  I'm a horrible person."  It wouldn't be out of line
to shout back "You're a horrible actress," or at least, "You have horrible
taste in picking projects" right back at her.
