Kids all across Syracuse are glued to the radio, and what they hear is
music to their ears, albeit not to their parents'.  No, it's not the
latest hot band.  It's the announcer with the blessed news that the
schools are closed for the day.  After an unseasonable hot spell, the
town has just awaken to find that they just had a record snowfall.
Chris Koch's SNOW DAY is a juvenile comedy that has a few nice moments,
but it puts you to sleep more often than it tickles your funny bone.
The poster boy for this lame farce would be the principal of the kids'
school.  He's a lanky doofus who shows up periodically for the sole
purpose of being pummeled by snowballs thrown from off-screen,
presumably by his students.  He's an embarrassment to card-carrying
adults.
The sweetest guy in the movie and the biggest surprise is Chevy Chase as
Tom Branston, the number three television weatherman in a three-station
market.  Tom's producer (Pam Grier) makes him wear silly outfits in an
attempt to boast their market share.  He hates it but feels forced to go
along.  In a semi-serious role, rather than his usual cheesy part, Chase
generates a modest amount of genuine sympathy for his character.
Although his acting isn't much, at least it isn't his usual abysmal
performance.
The weather man and his wife (Jean Smart) have three kids, Randy (Connor
Matheus), a precocious little kid, Natalie (Zena Grey), an adventuresome
preteen and Hal (Mark Webber), a teenager with raging hormones.
Hal and his best buddy, Lane (Schuyler Fisk, the daughter of Sissy
Spacek), hang out together as he dreams of dating the most popular girl
in class, Claire (Emmanuelle Chriqui), a golden goddess and a champion
athlete.  Claire, however, is part of "America's Dream Team," as her
popular and pompous boyfriend refers to their relationship.
The show's villain is provided by a hillbilly known only as the Snowplow
Man (Chris Elliott).  With teeth that look like dirty rocks, he's a
vicious slob who likes nothing better than mowing down helpless kids
with his monstrous machine.  The kids believe than the chains on his
plow come from the braces of crushed children.
The movie's two plots, both of which occur during the snow day, involve
Hal and Natalie.  Hal, ignoring Lane, pursues his dream girl.
Meanwhile, Natalie and her friends try to thwart the Snowplow Man in
order to force the school to declare a second snow day.
The movie doesn't have many jokes that you haven't heard before.  Randy,
for example, is a pest who blows bubbles in his food with a straw and
who gets his fist stuck in his mouth.  The script also features a smelly
bunch of flatulent fat boy jokes -- boy, that's original.
The only good line in the movie comes from Hal, who tells us what
happens to schools not lucky enough to live in snow country.  "I've
heard that in Los Angeles they get off for bad-hair days," he explains.
That's it.  The picture has only one good laugh, and now you know it,
leaving no reason to waste your money on the rest.
SNOW DAY runs 1:29.  It is rated PG for brief, mild peril and language
and would be acceptable for most kids.
My son Jeffrey, age 10, gave it ** 1/2, liking Randy the best.  Much of
the film kept putting him to sleep, literally.

     It's tough for a Texas boy to relate to the concept of a snow day.
We had the occasional sleet day or hurricane day, sure, but snow?
Whether you live in the tundra or not, I'm sure everyone can relate to
the real story of SNOW DAY, the tale of a boy who pines for the school
beauty, a girl far above his station with whom he never has a shot.
     Maybe we can relate a little too well.  This story has literally
been done to death (it feels practically like a remake of 1995's ANGUS),
but at least SNOW DAY is reasonably funny along the way.  Thanks to the
movie's "fresh new stars," SNOW DAY feels newer than it should.  And
thanks to leading kids Mark Webber (DRIVE ME CRAZY) and Schuyler Fisk
(daughter of Sissy Spacek), the movie has a lot of charm and heart.
     This is a kid movie, to be sure, and the little ones will have to
contend with four plotlines, all held tenuously together by the notion
that a sudden, freakish snowstorm shuts down their New York town and
that "anything can happen."  Center stage is Hal (Webber), who pines for
who must be the tannest girl in New York state, a girl named Claire
(Emmanuelle Chriqui), who comes off as cold and distant -- while the
earnest Lane (Fisk) wears her heart on her sleeve.  Hal's dad is hapless
weatherman Chevy Chase, who fights with his rival on another station.
And Hal's kid sister Trachtenberg wages war with Mr. Snowplow Man
(Elliott) to fight for a second snow day.
     The plot involving workaholic mother Jean Smart doesn't hold a
candle to the rest of the film, and I found myself often hoping for a
return to the core of the picture - Hal's hilarious pursuit of Claire.
But I'm sure you'll find one thing more annoying than the saccharine
Smart: the audience.  Only I don't know which is worse: the kids or
their trying-to-be-hip, mouth-breathing parents.

The magic that arises when children across the country listen eagerly to the 
radio after a snowfall to see if school has been canceled for the day is 
brought vibrantly to life in "Snow Day," a mildly entertaining diversion 
that, nonetheless, features at least three stories that do not mesh well when 
strung together, as they are clearly aimed at different age groups. Directed 
by Chris Koch, the film is a valiant effort that will only charm most 
audiences for one-third of the time, based on the viewer's age, and this is 
unfortunate, as the talent to make a truly winning family picture is present 
throughout.
The town of Syracuse is having a disappointing winter, with nary a snow storm 
in sight. But then something unexpected happens in the air pressure and the 
residents awake to find their outside surroundings blanketed in a heavy layer 
of snow. School is announced to be closed for the day, and for some of the 
members of the Brandston family, their lives will be changed--for the 
good--by nightfall. 
Story #1 involves teenage son Hal Brandston (Mark Webber), who is infatuated 
with high school beauty Claire Bonner (Emmanuelle Chriqui), and takes finding 
her ankle bracelet as a sign that they were meant for each other. Helping him 
out is his best friend, Lane (Schuyler Fisk), the girl in his life he fails 
to see he is really meant for. Preteens and teenagers are the target audience 
of this story, and it is the sweetest subplot in the film, terribly 
predictable, but consistently entertaining and equipped with a fetching 
innocence. Mark Webber is strong as the protagonist of this tale and the 
narrator of the film, but it is his female counterparts who steal the show. 
Schuyler Fisk, who is Sissy Spacek's daughter, proves that she very well 
could prove to be just as talented an actress as her mother, and is 
absolutely lovely as Lane. And the way in which the Claire character is 
handled is impressive and noteworthy, as she isn't simply written as the 
"seemingly unobtainable object," but as a real person who is charmed by Hal's 
persistence in winning her over. Emmanuelle Chriqui is a fresh face I look 
forward to seeing in the future.
Story #2 is far less successful, and aimed for the ages 5-11 bracket, as 
young Natalie Brandston (Zena Grey) sets out to stop the infamous Snow Plow 
Man (Chris Elliott), a maniacal worker for the city hell-bent on clearing 
each and every street by day's end. Syracuse schools have never been closed 
for snow two days in a row, and Natalie is determined to change that. While 
there are a couple intermittent laughs within this story, it is cliched and 
juvenile, and much of the humor is lame. Chris Elliott has a lot of fun as 
the villainous Snow Plow Man, but Zena Grey, as Natalie, is the type of child 
who rubs me the wrong way. Unctuous and annoyingly loudmouthed, Grey does not 
win any sort of plaudits from me.
Finally, Story #3 deals with the Brandston parents' adventures individually, 
so there  actually could qualify as being a Story #4, as well. Tom Brandston 
(Chevy Chase) is a news weatherman whose boss (Pam Grier) is always insisting 
he dress up in extravagantly silly costumes, in hopes that it will pull in 
viewers, when all Tom wants to do is be taken seriously in his profession as 
a meteorologist. Tom's wife, Laura (Jean Smart), is a workaholic whose job 
takes away from being able to be the involved parent she aspires to be. 
Snowed in and unable to go to work, Laura spends the day with her youngest 
son, and rediscovers why being a parent should come before her job. These 
subplots are tolerable, and a step up from Story #2, but generally slight and 
their payoffs are telegraphed far in advance. In the actor department, Chevy 
Chase is wasted and rarely given a snappy line of dialogue; Pam Grier is 
crazy to have even considered appearing in such a throwaway role; and Jean 
Smart is likable and entertaining.
When all is said and done, "Snow Day" fails because it is so resolutely 
uneven. It is unclear what director Koch was attempting by mixing all of 
these different stories for different ages, unless he was hoping he could 
possibly attract a wider audience and, thus, make more money. He may just 
succeed on that level, in getting them into the theater, but the film itself 
is a strange experience. While keeping an innocuous tone throughout, "Snow 
Day" is unsure what it wants to be, and never firmly finds its footing.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Realizing that the last time he was humorous was when he made a movie
set in the snow, former funnyman Chevy Chase (National Lampoon's
Christmas Vacation) returns to winter pics with Snow Day, the latest
film produced under television's Nickelodeon moniker.  Hilarity does not
ensue  details at 11:00.
Luckily, Chase is only involved in one of the four prongs of Day's
script.  He plays Tom Brandston, a wacky TV weatherman tired of playing
second fiddle to Syracuse, New York's meteorological deity, Chad Symmons
(John Schneider, The Dukes of Hazzard).  Tom is serious about his craft,
while smarmy Chad never even went to meteorologist school.  Like a
college education is a requirement for predicting the weather these
days.
Tom's wife Laura (Jean Smart, Guinevere) is a workaholic with a cell
phone permanently attached to her head.  The Brandstons have three kids,
and each fits the basic parameters for the typical Hollywood family.
There's fifteen-year-old Hal (Mark Webber, Drive Me Crazy), the dorky
teen on the brink of adulthood.  Then there's ten-year-old Natalie (Zena
Grey, The Bone Collector), the sassy middle kid that acts more adult
than the actual adults.  And then there's Randy (Connor Matheus), the
youngest Brandston, who is able to steal all of his scenes despite
barely being able to sputter out his lines.
When a record snowfall hits upstate New York, each character is affected
in ways that will forever change the way they approach life.  Okay, it's
not that mind-blowing at all.  Tom sees the storm as his big chance to
show everyone that he's the best darn weatherman in the godforsaken
city.  Laura realizes the importance of her family after she is trapped
at home all day with Randy the bastard.  Hal uses the day off to try to
woo school sexpot Claire (Emmanuelle Chriqui, Detroit Rock City) away
from bad-boy jock Chuck Wheeler (David Paetkau, Disturbing Behavior).
And charming Natalie tries to settle the score with a demonic snowplow
driver called Snowplowman (Chris Elliott, There's Something About Mary).
The kids will love the flatulence jokes and, Dads, keep an eye peeled
for Claire's see-through t-shirt  it's the most nipple I've seen in a
PG film.  The more hip adults in the audience may enjoy Iggy Pop (The
Crow: City of Angels), who plays the proprietor of the town's ice
skating rink, where he punishes customers with lethargic Al Martino
songs.  Did he call his agent after seeing Henry Rollins in Jack Frost
and say `Get me in a kids' movie with snow'?
But most of the good parts have to do with Snowplowman.  He's got teeth
like an Englishman, a bird named Trudy, a plow called `Darling
Clementine' and tire chains made from the braces of kids that he's run
over.  Like Natalie says, `It's a snow day  anything can happen.'  Such
as the fact that Hal narrates the film despite only being in twenty-five
percent of it.
Snow Day was made by the creative team that brought Kablam! to the small
screen.  Director Chris Koch and writers Will McRobb and Chris Viscardi
are all alumnus of the popular sketch comedy show and Day is the feature
film debut for all three filmmakers.  While it's not a particularly bad
film, it's better than the recent offerings from the sketch comedy
dinosaur Saturday Night Live.  Which brings us back to Mr. Chase, who,
once again, shows that he's as funny as a can of wadded beef.

Susan Granger's review of "SNOW DAY" (Paramount Pictures/Nickelodeon)
        What kid hasn't listened to the radio for that oft-anticipated 
but rarely realized announcement: "Schools are closed. It's a snow day!"?
After a groan from the grown-ups, the fun begins. But how to spend a
lovely snow day? For the Brandstons of Syracuse, there are many
possibilities.  Dad (Chevy Chase) is a TV meteorologist, actually the
wacky weatherman who predicted that an unexpected blizzard would hit
the area. Mom (Jean Smart) is attached to her cellphone, working on a
business deal in Beijing. So 15 year-old Hal (Mark Webber) is free to
pursue the perfect girl of his dreams (Emmanuelle Chiqui), who has
never acknowledged his existence, while taking for granted the genial
companionship of his best friend (Schuyler Fisk, daughter of Sissy
Spacek). Hal's 10 year-old sister (Zena Grey) has a bigger ambition:
she's seriously determined to defeat the demonic Snowplowman (Chris
Elliott), a suburban Darth Vader in a ten-ton truck who haunts the
kids' snow days. He has a pet crow, his rig's called Clementine, and
legend has it that he makes chains for his tires from the braces of
kids he's run over. And Hal's brother (Connor Matheus), the terrible
toddler, just wants to go outside and play. Writers Will McRobb &
Chris Viscardi and director Chris Koch deliver slippery slapstick
sketches with only a few slushy moments. Yeah, there are flatulence
jokes but they get big laughs from the smallfry audience. And the
adults snicker when they recognize punker Iggy Pop as the ice rink DJ,
playing old Al Martino records. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
Snow Day is a flaky 5 - silly, wintry fun for the kids and not too bad
for their parents either.

Growing up in the north, I, too, longed for that prized announcement over
the early morning radio, "SNOWDAY, Schools are closed!!!" In its attempt to
recreate the elation a blizzard brings to children, "Snowday" slips and
slides all over itself.
Fundamentally a formula family picture, "Snowday" adds little to the four
story lines it borrows from countless other pictures. Each conflict
resolving wholesomely, but with little power.
In the primary saga, the teen son (Mark Webber) chases a beauty out of his
league while ignoring gal-pal Schuyler Fisk. A few endearingly unique
moments grace this tale, but for the most part, it evolves just as expected.
Next, the boy's little sister must conquer her demon -- the evil snowplow
man. Not only will he "steal" a second snowday by clearing the streets, but
he delights in mowing towards blissfully sledding children. The chains on
his tires are said to be made from "the braces of kids that didn't get out
of his way."
Thirdly, mom is a workaholic who ignores her family's needs. This plot line
pains viewers as she tends to the phone while family chaos ensues.
Lastly, dad Chevy Chase plays the town's second best weatherman. In order to
be free of gimmicky costumes meant to maintain his ratings, Chase must
snatch top guy status from his super slick rival. Chase's charm keeps this
subplot above ice water.
Strong music wisps with the magic of "E.T." and "Close Encounters"
desperately trying to make a snowman from this slush. But the visuals and
story, like it's poster, feel quickly cut out and pasted together by busy
people with other things on their minds.

Snow Day (2000) 1 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Chevy Chase, Mary Kay
Place and Chris Elliott.
 "Snow Day" is a cartoonish feature that has the look and feel of a
made-for-TV movie.
 The characters are stock, the situations are cliched. The movie plays
more like one of those old "ABC Afterschool Specials" than a theatrical
release.
 One basic problem is the movie is unsure to which audience its wants to
pander, the younger kids or teen-agers. So, it offers a goulash of both,
satisfying neither.
 The best indicator of the reception this film will likely receive from
the under-10 set came from a little boy sitting a couple rows in front
of me at a preview screening.
 He punctuated the theater with a loud `yuk' three times. Each
exclamation followed a kissing scene between two teen-age characters.
 At just about 90 minutes, Snow Day moves at a brisk pace. But the story
is fragmented and is populated by types, not real people - or even real
kids.
 There's the geek who has a crush on the popular, beautiful girl; his
best friend, a pretty, honest girl who has a crush on him; the stupid,
jock boyfriend; the younger, but wiser, sister; the fat friend who emits
a symphony of sounds; and the buffoonish school principal everyone
hates.
 "Snow Day," a co-production between Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures,
is strictly by-the-numbers filmmaking.
 And in a sense, the film, though meant to be slapstick and a bit of a
fantasy, is somewhat irresponsible. For example, a group of young kids -
elementary school age - want a second snow day. To get it, they kidnap
`Snowplow Man' (Chris Elliott in a comically disgusting turn) and
commandeer his snowplow. Showing youngsters driving around in heavy
machinery is not my idea of a smart move.
 However, the kids are charming, and the film contains barely enough
action and gags to sustain it.
 "Snow Day" is aimed at an audience the filmmakers condescendingly think
are too young to have an opinion. But three `yuks' should tell them
something.
 Maybe they should have canned the romance and filmed more snowball
fights.

        On a snow day, anything can happen.  Young love can be requited.  A
TV weather forecaster with falling ratings can win the approval of his
community.  A mother can learn to put her family before her cell phone.
And the scourge of the neighborhood, a demonic snowplow driver with bad
teeth and a pet raven, can get his comeuppance.
        "Snow Day," a family film with the emphasis on family, doesn't get
too bogged down delivering on these individual plotlines, but it does have
a lot of fun getting there.  A Paramount Pictures/Nickelodeon Movies
production, the film features "big name" stars in Chevy Chase, Chris
Elliott, Jean Smart, and Pam Grier but, wisely, relegates them to minor
roles and allows its real stars, its child actors, to shine.
        Most engaging of these is Philadelphia's own Mark Webber, who plays
highschooler Hal Brandston.  Hal sees the unseasonably mild winter's first
freak snowfall as a sign to pursue the girl of his dreams, high-dive beauty
Claire Bonner (Emmanuelle Chriqui).  Hal's little sister Natalie (Zena
Grey) is more obsessed with derailing the efforts of the menacing snowplow
man (Elliott) in an effort to set the Syracuse record of two snow days in a
row.  Their flatulent younger brother Randy, played by Connor Matheus,
spends most of this time rolling around in the white stuff like a beetle on
its back.
        Chase and Smart are their parents, both heavily involved in their
careers, with Chase as Syracuse's No. 2 meteorologist playing second fiddle
to John Schneider's flashy Chad Symmonz, and Smart as a soft drink marketer
who cannot let the phone ring unanswered even if it means losing a bet.
Also a joy to watch is Schuyler Fisk, daughter of Sissy Spacek and art
director Jack Fisk, as Hal's down-to-earth friend and confidante Lane
Leonard--this is a promising performance from Fisk; watch for bigger things
from her in the future.
        "Snow Day" is not a remarkable film in any way, but in today's age
of indiscriminate sex and violence it's refreshing to watch a film in which
sexual situations are replaced by sincere expressions of teenage love and
violence is reduced to a high school principal being bombarded by unseen
snowball assailants.
        Chris Koch's film is silly and fun, tapping into that primal
excitement of hearing one's school closing number on the radio.
