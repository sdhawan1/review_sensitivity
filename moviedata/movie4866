Hard-Boiled has gained a certain fame since the sudden popularation of
Hong Kong action films, and it deserves every bit of it.  his film is
exciting and makes most American actioners look stale and unmotivated.
The plot is the regular male bonding esque story with small twists and
amazing set pieces.  We get a lot-o-death in a resteraunt, hospital and
factory.  Director Woo uses slow frames and sped up shots that inject
adrinalin to action scenes that seem almost hypnotic.  
Another praise of the film is in the use of hospital for climatic
setting. What a great idea.  There are plenty of patients who can't move
out of the way and of course a maternity ward full of babies.  When the
hospital may be blown up by terrorists every baby must be rescued and
delivered -- several stories down.
I have praised the action and it's exciting, also the film looks cool,
like a cold glaze over the screen.  It has the same look as many of the
Hong Kong action films that have began a wave of new fans.  For you
fans, this film is definatly worth a look, but first check out Woo's The
Killers.
