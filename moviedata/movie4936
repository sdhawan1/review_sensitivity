     We had an execution, jilted lovers, big-time payback, and at least
three sprawling examinations of someone's life.  Now we get an apartheid
film:  another in the string of "serious movies" coming out in the last
few weeks.
     CRY, THE BELOVED COUNTRY is James Earl Jones's magnum opus, a film in
which he gets to really stretch his range as an actor, even though the
film doesn't give him much room to do so.  The movie is the story of aging
Zulu priest Stephen Kumalo (Jones) and his search for his sister and son
in 1946 Johannesburg.  A stranger in a strange land, Kumalo soon finds his
country ways unsuited for life in the bustling city, and he is victimized
by thieves almost as soon as he arrives.
     Kumalo finds his sister soon enough:  she's a prostitute in the
seediest section of town.  Finding son Absalom is a different matter
altogether, and a convoluted investigation finally leads him to his son's
life of crime, a pregnant girlfriend, and the sort-of-accidental murder of
a prominent, white, social reformer.  To make matters worse, this man is
the son of Kumalo's wealthy neighbor, James Jarvis (Richard Harris). 
Kumalo becomes wrapped up in his son's trial, but more interestingly,
attempts to reconcile things with Jarvis.
     Harris and Jones are amazing when on screen together, but this is all
too rare, as they interact in only three brief scenes.  The rest of the
picture is very beautiful, but its deliberate, plodding pace seems to drag
the movie on for an eternity.  There's no big surprise about what's going
to happen, but the sheer heart that Jones, Harris, and director Darrell
James Roodt have imbued to the film give it an uncommon bouyance and it
manages to rise above its flawed pacing.
     The message of CRY, THE BELOVED COUNTRY, that compassion and
forgiveness are crucial if society is to develop to the next level, is
almost completely foreign in cinema today.  And it is that compassion that
makes this picture so oddly memorable.

     This story of two men from the South African countryside, one
white and one black, and their sons entangled in the same violent
events in Johannesburg, is one of the most famous and memorable
accounts of apartheid.  The novel was written by Alan Paton, a white
South African teacher, just after World War II, and filmed by Zoltan
Korda in 1951.
     So it was perhaps inevitable that, with the demise of apartheid
and the opening up of trade with South Africa, one of the first films
to be released to an international market would be a new version of
CRY, THE BELOVED COUNTRY.  It received its European premiere at
the London Film Festival last weekend and will go on release in the US
in a week's time.
     On the strength of its showing in London, the new film deserves to
succeed.  It works brilliantly at many levels beyond its portrayal of
apartheid.  There is the bewilderment of the black priest at the centre
of the film, when he first sees how his family live in Johannesburg.
There is the subtlety of the issues when a white man is murdered--but
the white man apparently embroiled in a racial dispute is actually a
liberal, and regarded by friends as a faint curiosity, for his
sympathetic treatment of the "natives."  There is the contrast
between collective violence, and bigotry, and racism, and the
acceptance and optimism shown by the individual characters.
     The playwright Ronald Harwood started working with CRY, THE
BELOVED COUNTRY, a few years ago when Johannesburg's Market Theatre
looked into the possibility of a stage version.  This was the idea that
evolved into Harwood's screenplay for the new film.  This is relevant,
partly because it is a reminder that the idea behind the film actually
predates the South African elections, partly because occasionally the
dialogue can appear formal and understated, in a way that suggests the
script's origins for the stage.
     Nevertheless the style of dialogue is appropriate to the story,
and the leading players--James Earl Jones and Richard Harris--invest
their roles with a good deal of humanity which is crucial to the
narrative.  And the whole film looks and sounds great: visually it
makes the most of the beautiful rural surroundings and their contrast
with the teeming city.
     It isn't always comfortable viewing, but its emotional power is
immense.  And its reminder, of quite how complex perceptions of good
and evil actually are, is as important as ever.

     Most films focusing on the racial division of South Africa are
framed around a mood of seething anger and tension.  The inequities of
the recently-abolished apartheid system have provided fuel for a series
of motion pictures steeped in bitterness and outrage.  Beyond the evils
of the system and those who supported it, however, were issues of racial
harmony and mutual tolerance -- subjects never dealt with more
effectively than in Alan Paton's landmark 1946 novel, CRY, THE BELOVED
COUNTRY.  This film, the second (and better) adaptation of the book, has
little room for hatred or anger.  Instead, its underlying tone is one of
a profound grief that the title hints at.
     Taken as a whole, Paton's novel promotes healing and understanding,
and it speaks as powerfully to audiences today as it did when it was
first published, fifty years ago.  This 1995 film version is entirely
faithful to its source material.  At times, sections of dialogue are
lifted directly from the printed page.  More importantly, however,
Paton's themes are brought home with devastating, soul-crushing impact
through a production that captures the book's spirit as adeptly as it
recounts the narrative.  There is not a false note in CRY, THE BELOVED
COUNTRY.  Every scene is an example of near-perfect composition and
execution.
     In the aftermath of World War Two, South Africa is a divided
country -- a land of growing injustice where the white man prospers
through the efforts of the black man, and where the majority of the
wealth is in the hands of the racial minority.  Whites live in
beautifully-constructed mansions with immaculately-groomed gardens.
Blacks are often forced to eke out an existence by turning to crime and
living as squatters in a shantytown.  The specter of fear looms large
over everything.  All men, black and white alike, feel its oppressive,
pervasive influence.
     In this climate, two very different men come to the city of
Johannesburg.  Though they are both from the rural district of Natal and
have a mutual dislike of city life, they have never met.  The first is a
black pastor, Reverend Stephen Kumalo (James Earl Jones), who has left
behind his poor community to make the journey in search of his son.  The
second is a white landowner, James Jarvis (Richard Harris), who has come
to Johannesburg to bury his only child, Arthur, the victim of a shooting
by three black youths, one of whom was Absalom Kumalo (Eric Miyeni),
Stephen's son.
     Arthur Jarvis was a well-known activist for native rights who
devoted his life to improving circumstances for the blacks of
Johannesburg.  Whites did not understand him; blacks embraced him.
Those at the Claremont African Boys Club, where he was president, loved
him not only for the money he spent on the facility, but for the time he
freely gave.  In his writings, he spoke of South African whites as
"tyrants, oppressors, and criminals."  Ironically, his own death came at
the hands of one of those he sought to help.  But Absalom Kumalo did not
kill out of malice.  His only defense when confronted by the police is
"I was afraid; I did not mean to shoot him."
     The meat of CRY, THE BELOVED COUNTRY concerns how events in the
wake of the shooting transform the lives of Stephen Kumalo and James
Jarvis.  Each is forced to abandon their naivete and confront the grim
truths of reality.  For Stephen, this means a crisis of faith and a re-
assessment of his role in the world.  For James, it means coming to
terms with the core of his son's beliefs and seeing his own bigotry for
what it is.  In the end, each gains more than he loses, yet the price of
that new knowledge cuts deeply.
     Both James Earl Jones and Richard Harris, two screen veterans, are
superb.  Finely-tuned performances like these illustrate how shallow the
acting is in most contemporary films.  Go over a list of potential
Academy Award nominees for 1995 and contrast their work to what Jones
and Harris accomplish here.  Few will weather that comparison favorably.
Separately, these two are riveting, but their scenes together lift CRY,
THE BELOVED COUNTRY to a higher plateau.  The initial meeting between
Stephen and James is one of the most potent scenes not just of the year,
but of the decade.
     The supporting cast is populated by lesser-known, but not
necessarily lesser-talented, figures.  Charles Dutton, a familiar face
from recent movies and television, has a small role as John Kumalo,
Stephen's political activist brother.  Leleti Kumalo, who had the lead
in SARAFINA!, plays Absalom's wife, Katie.  Vusi Kunene is Reverend
Theophilus Msimangu, Stephen's friend and guide in Johannesburg (this is
the part played by Sidney Poitier in the 1951 film).
     Many share in the credit for CRY, THE BELOVED COUNTRY's unqualified
success.  Jones and Harris head the list alongside director Darrell
James Roodt (SARAFINA!), whose touch is true.  Screenwriter Ronald
Harwood has adapted the novel with care, using voiceover narration from
the book sparingly (there are three instances of this:  at the
beginning, during a mid-point interlude, and at the end).  John Barry's
evocative score provides the perfect accompaniment to Paul Gilpin's
cinematography.
     Rarely does a motion picture touch the heart so deeply, with no
hint of artifice or manipulation.  Producer Anant Singh has said he
wanted to wait to film this version of CRY, THE BELOVED COUNTRY until
after apartheid's death so that the new climate in South Africa could
provide a more hopeful backdrop.  The timing is right, for today's
circumstances quiet one of Paton's great concerns:  that "when the white
man turns to loving, the black man will have turned to hating."  CRY,
THE BELOVED COUNTRY shows the path of tolerance and compassion that the
leaders of South Africa have finally found.

"There is fear in the land. And fear in the         hearts of all who 
live there. And fear puts an end to understanding and the need 
to understand. So how shall we fashion such a land when there 
is fear in the heart? The white man will put more locks on his 
door and get a fine fierce dog, but the beauty of the trees 
and of the stars, these things we shall forego.
"Cry, the beloved country, for the unborn child that is the 
inheritor of our fear. Let him not love the earth too deeply. 
Let him not be too moved when the birds of his land are 
singing, nor give too much of his heart to a mountain or a 
valley. For fear will rob him of all if his gives too much. 
Yes cry, cry, the
beloved country."
Even for people familiar with world literature, their first 
acquaintance with a South African novel was "Cry, the Beloved 
Country," by  Alan Paton (1903-1988), a white who had been 
principal of the Diepkloof Reformatory since 1935.  
The film (released in 1995) has adapted the beautiful, sad, 
poetic book with  maximum fidelity, including descriptions, 
dialogue and voice-over narration. It relates events in 1946. 
Stephen Kumalo, a Zulu pastor (James Earl Jones), leaves his 
rural area for his first trip to Johannesburg. With the sum 
total od his money, a paltry 14 pounds 6, and with dogged 
determination, he is looking for his sister and for his son.  
"My son, Absalom" echoes both the Bible and William Faulkner.
He finds the woman. She had become a prostitute of the saddest 
sort -- not from greed but by necessity.  He rescues her and 
her child. Then he eventually locates Absalom -- in prison.  
The young man had fallen in bad company and had a penal 
record. During an attempted burglary, with two companions, 
Absalom, panicking when the white occupant returned, shot him 
fatally. 
By coincidence, the victim, Arthur, was the only child of a 
landowner from Kumalo's area, James Jarvis (Richard Harris).  
There is no doubt that Absalom, as he stated to his father and 
the Court, fired unthinkingly because he was frightened. While 
no excuse in the eyes of the law, this is  a terrible 
indictment of a society of separate and unequal races, where, 
in the dominated group, "Fear Eats the Soul," to quote the 
title of a Fassbinder film.
Ironically, Arthur was a liberal and the creator of a black 
center (the Claremont Boys Club). Says a club official to 
James: "He gave us all of this,"  and adds: " He is the only 
man, black or white, to see me as I am."
Among Arthur's writings, James  reads: "It is not native crime 
which is the problem, but white crime..." James, not shown as 
a bigot, is, like so many others, guilty by ommission and 
ignorance. He learns from tragedy. During a sleepless night, 
he tells his wife: " There was something Arthur wrote, that 
day that he... He said we taught him nothing. He means that we 
taught him nothing about the country in which he lived. He 
said that we called ourselves Christians, but we were 
indifferent to the suffering of Christians. He said that  when 
we say we are Christians, what we mean is that we are 
white.... Oh, why... Why, why, why, why do we bring children 
into this world?" 
In ways too delicate and complex to detail or reveal here, the 
two distraught fathers meet. Jarvis, unaware of who the 
anonymous visitor is ( Kumalo almost collapses from emotion), 
treats him kindly. Then the preacher, with immense pain 
declares: "It was my son that killed your son." Jarvis, still 
gentle: "I understand what I did not understand.  There is no 
anger in me." They part with "Go well, umfundisi" (a 
respectful expression for "pastor")  and "Stay well umnumzana" 
("sir"). The sequence is heartbreaking, the actors superb, 
both tens on a scale of 1 to 10. 
James Earl Jones has an enormous presence, all the stronger 
for his contained agony. Richard Harris, in  his most 
underplayed, quiet role ever, is also a paragon of moving, 
unrhetorical, unshowy reactions.  The strange but believable 
bond between the two men is reinforced in the scenes that 
follow.  
I confess that I was a bit worried at the start of the movie, 
first because the music by James Barry sounded like a clone of 
his score for "Out of Africa," secondly because the trek of 
the Rev. Kumalo to Johannesburg, where he gets scammed and 
robbed on arrival, might overdevelop the aspect of a rube in a 
big city. But neither musical nor plot cliches appear. 
Instead, we get a series of events that go from touching to 
moving to devastating, both for the characters and the 
audience. The poignancy is cumulative, impossible to resist. 
It lasts to the very end when the preacher goes up to the 
mountain, with more Biblical echoes, not to mention Martin 
Luther King.
There is true emotion, dignity and nobility in this film, yet 
none that you might suspect of pulling out all the stops in 
order to influence the audience.  There is also, in the eyes 
of many critics, a great deal of true Christianity, but in my 
opinion the story transcends Christianity, Judaism, ancestor 
worship or totemism, reaching instead deep levels of humanity 
that cut across religions or non-faiths. 
Not everything is obvious. Neither the police nor the 
prosecutor or the judge are made into racist villains. During 
Absalom's trial, whenever Arthur Jarvis  is mentioned, it is 
not by name, but as "the white man." This speaks volumes. So 
does the richness of the film in major elements ( like the 
kindness and help shown Kumalo by a white Bishop and a black, 
complex clergyman), small touches (impasses for blacks, the 
hostility of the bordello's madam), integrated incidentals (a 
bus boycott that forces the two preachers to walk 11 miles), 
and much else. 
By Hollywood standards, this is an Un-American movie, I mean 
one that takes its time with feelings, reflections and 
reactions. Yet slow it isn't.  The running time is listed 
variously as 108 and as 120 minutes. It is quite possible that 
after its initial screening the film was cut, but even in that 
case, no harm was done. It still plays like a Greek tragedy 
for our time. Not to be missed.

     The only bad thing about *Cry, the Beloved Country* is that its
run in the "big houses" has been so very short. It ran in Chicago a
scant two weeks. Doubtless the film has lost money for Miramax. One has
to wonder  why the studio decided to make the investment at all, what
with apartheid in South Africa being dismantled and all. It seems that
for a  movie whose prominent feature is a hated political system to
succeed,  the politics have to be current. But there is the rub. In my
eyes, the  thing that makes the movie work is that the cruel system of
oppression  is now a fresh but receding memory. Had the system been
current, the  movie would have been much more harsh and strident. The
political  agenda to break the hated system would have dominated (and
destroyed)  this work as a film.
     Now, given a small buffer of time since the real thing, it can
concentrate on being a redemption story set in a beautiful but
treacherous place. The memory of apartheid is fresh enough that it
doesn't have to be explained, it simply is the great pall that hangs
over the whole. The action of the movie then gets its poignancy and
becomes all the more refreshing as you see convergence and healing and
forgiveness take place under this shroud.
     "Cry" is a faithful remake of Alan Paton's great novel by the same
name. Rev. Stephen Kumalo, (a simple Zulu pastor given heroic
dimensions by the incomparable James Earl Jones) receives news that he
must go to the great and frightening city of Johannesburg to try to
rescue his sister and his son. He finds only tragedy. His sister is
reduced to the life of a prostitute and his son kills a man in a
botched robbery attempt.
     The fascinating thing of the movie is watching Kumalo put one
faithful foot after the other, never failing in his trust, always in
the scriptures or in prayer, looking to the Lord. Imagine a character
about whom a fellow pastor says, "There goes the only truly good man I
have ever known."
     Jones' portrayal of Kumalo is so good and moving he deserves the
big awards for the work. It is sad that he probably won't even be
noticed because of the failed economy of the thing.
     The great moments are the reconciliation moments between James
Jarvis (Richard Harris) a wealthy white racist landowner and Kumalo. As
the pious pastor and the supremacist farmer encounter each other, and
Kumalo tells Jarvis that it is his son who has killed Jarvis' boy, we
watch as recognition, hatred, and forgiveness are processed. That such
process can happen is our audacious hope in the face of our
post-apartheid, post-OJ, post million-man-march angst. This is a deeply
spiritual movie that  has come at just the right time. Too bad most
folks won't see it.

    CRY THE BELOVED COUNTRY is set in Natal, South Africa in 1946.  It
is a remake of the 1952 movie of the same name by Zoltan Korda.  This
movie features James Earl Jones as an Anglican priest by the name of
Stephen Kumalo, and it is clearly the best performance of Jones's long
career of over eighty movies.
     CRY THE BELOVED COUNTRY starts with sweeping vistas of great
beauty filmed in luscious color thanks to the cinematography by Paul
Gilpin.  Although I have never been to South Africa, the terrain
reminded me of the Scottish Highlands where I have visited.  The beauty
of South Africa resonates perfectly with the richness of Jones's voice
in the narration.  The sets (David Barkham) with the contrast of the
claustrophobia of the big city and the poverty of the ghettos are
extremely effective.
     The movie tells the story of a black priest, Father Kumalo, who is
forced to leave his poor country church and travel into the big city of
Johannesburg.  He goes to find his sister Gertrude (Dembisa Kente), his
son Absolom (Eric Miyeni), and his brother John (Charles Dutton), but
he departs with great trepidation.  He tells his wife Katie (Leleti
Kumalo), "This is a journey I have always feared.  My people go there
never to return."  When he gets there he is robbed and the place seems
to be as bad as he feared.  There is a great scene of him lost in the
vastness of the big city.
     When he finds his brother, he turns out to be a politician with
impressive oratorical skills who is too busy to be bothered with his
relatives from the country.  Just as there is the clash between black
and white in South Africa, there is also the mutual misunderstanding
between the people living in the city and those in the country.  The
movie spends more time than most movies dealing with spirituality in
general and the true meaning of Christianity in particular.  It is
refreshing to see a movie where people of the cloth are taken seriously
for a change.  One priest explains another's actions by saying, "He has
truth on his side" to which Father Kumalo answers, "How can he have
truth without God?"
     The city is shown as a place of great sorrow.  In one of the most
horrific scenes Father Kumalo learns that his son has killed the son of
the rich white landowner James Jarvis (Richard Harris).  The movie is
about the search for Absolom and then his trial.
     The marvelous script by Ronald Harwood and direction by Darrell
Roodt weave a tale of great power and sadness but do it in an
understated fashion that never manipulates the audience's emotions.
Nevertheless, there was many a tear shed in the theater I was at, and I
could hear frequent sobbing.  Moreover, every single person stayed
until all of the credits finished and the house lights went up because
they were so mesmerized by the show.  The ending is perfect, and I
think hopeful.
     Ah, the acting.  Everyone in the movie was quite good, but Jones
was head and shoulders above everyone else.  He cried in the show, he
was scared in the show, and yet he was brave.  A more moving and
powerful performance I have not seen in a long time.  If he does not
get an Academy Award nomination for it, they ought to disband the
Academy as hopeless lost.
     The music by John Barry is extremely moving without ever being
overpowering.  I love the costumes (Rui Filipe) especially the large
brimmed hats that the priests wear.
     CRY THE BELOVED COUNTRY runs a fast 1:49 thanks to crisp editing
(David Heitner).  The movie is rated PG-13 for a little violence, but
there is no sex, nudity or bad language.  I would have no trouble
taking kids 10 and over.  This is a subtle but wonderful film that I
recommend to you strongly, and I give it *** 1/2.
