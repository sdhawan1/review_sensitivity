**1/2 (out of 4) THE 13TH WARRIOR is a fantasy/action movie that has
none of the trappings of the usual modern action movies. There are no
snappy insults, no romantic subplots, no comic sidekicks, and no
gratuitous pop songs blaring over the film or the credits. None of them
were missed.
It's worth mentioning that the two producers of this film were the
story's author (Michael Crichton) and the director. Perhaps it is
because the people close to the story had control, that the film didn't
become watered down. If so, it's a pairing I hope to see more of.  
Antonio Banderas plays Ahmed, an Arab poet. He is caught in a
compromising affair with a young princess and banished, along with his
teacher (Omar Sharif). The two head north out of the city.
Later, fleeing some bandits, the two invite themselves into the
hospitality of a tribe of Vikings who have wandered south. The next day,
a boy arrives from farther north, asking for help back in his home
village. The Viking fates decree that 13 warriors must go help, and that
the 13th man be not a northman. Ahmed the poet is drafted and his
teacher is sent back home.
The thirteen arrive at the besieged village to find almost no men of
fighting age left alive. The king welcomes the heroes-to-be, and tells
them that the Vin, a mysterious race of man-bear creatures, have been
making raids. The Vin always decapitate their victims and gnaw on the
remains.
It eventually becomes clear that 13 warriors and a village of farmers
are no match for a burgeoning tribe of cannibals. Expecting death and
defeat, they struggle for a plan that will make every life count.
Not many movies portray Vikings in the dark ages. In fact, the only one
that has had an impact on my generation is MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY
GRAIL. So the setting in THE 13TH WARRIOR is fairly original for 1999
(that is to say, unexploited by Hollywood).
The movie gives us a speculative glance at the lives the Vikings might
have led as well. Since our hero is an outsider, he gives the audience
someone to identify with as he learns their customs and ways. Having
that hero be Muslim adds an exotic flavor. It makes the entire setting
all the more exotic and foreign.
The movie has high production values, (a trait I admittedly respect more
highly than other critics). I was impressed by the look of the movie,
and by some of the obviously unfaked settings. A Viking village was at
least partially created, as was a great wooden Viking ship. A long scene
in a cave appeared to actually be lit by the torches carried by the
characters, and the cave itself appeared to be real, or at least made of
more substantial stuff than can be seen in STAR TREK.
Much of the movie was shot on location in British Columbia and other
parts of Canada. The cinematography (by Peter Menzies) captures the cold
outdoor atmosphere of northern climes. Whether it was the unsoftened
shadows at midday or some trick with the lens, the air in the north
looked crisp and cold.
In contrast, the nighttime battles and inky cave interiors were a dark
black, lit by harsh orange torches. The look could have been a cheap way
to save on precise special effects, but it was an effective way to
convey fear and claustrophobia.
One last noteworthy detail is the way in which McTiernan handles the
language barrier between Arabic, Latin, and Norse. It's the same trick
he used in THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, and it works very well. Perhaps he
drew too much attention to his trick, but it forestalled an objection
that had been forming in my head.
Yet in spite of the best things about THE 13TH WARRIOR, I still found
myself less than entirely engaged. I kept waiting for the REALLY
thrilling parts, always expecting something more. Clearly, my
expectations were wrong, but it's also probably fair to criticize the
movie for being slow in parts, and for meandering at the beginning.
THE 13TH WARRIOR never really wowed me while I was watching it, but I
grew more impressed with it afterwards. You won't find explosive,
blockbuster action in THE 13TH WARRIOR, but see it if you'd like
something a notch older, more serious, and more mature.

     Take a little BRAVEHEART, take a little BEOWULF.  Mix them together
with a bit of THE GOONIES, and you've got yourself THE 13TH WARRIOR
     Here, at last, is a movie that is *exactly* what you expect it's
going to be.  From the opening scene, where Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan (Bandaras)
is shipped across the world for political reasons, to the end, where
Ahmed finds himself an unlikely hero amidst a group of Norse warriors,
this is a traditional, big, action movie from start to finish.
     There's no mysterious surprise or turn of events.  The bad guys
(aka `The Eaters of the Dead,' taking their name from the Michael
Crichton book on which this film is based) are just a bunch of bad guys
with no reason for being bad.  The good guys are a bunch of Nordic
barbarians that spit, insult one another, and seem to enjoy pain.
Banderas is an Asian Zorro.  The movie clocks in just under two hours,
whereupon you get up from your seat and leave the theater, trying to
form an opinion about what you've just seen.
     And I found that incredibly difficult to do.  THE 13TH WARRIOR is
simply without thrills and excitement.  It's also without any huge
negatives that would compel me to tell you to avoid the movie.  It's
just *there*.
     And that's hardly worth getting excited about, for good or for
bad.  Skip this one, and check out the *other* McTiernan film playing
right now: THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR.
Director: John McTiernan
Producer: John McTiernan, Michael Crichton, Ned Dowd

       For more than two years, this cliche-ridden action adventure
has gathered dust on the shelf at Disney's Buena Vista Pictures. No
one knew quite when to release it or how to market its blood 'n' guts
content to the public. Antonio Banderas ("The Mask of Zorro") plays
Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan, an urbane Muslim poet-diplomat banished from his
Egyptian homeland during the 10th century, along with elderly Omar
Sharif, who acts as his translator.  Fleeing from Baghdad in a caravan
after Banderas has indulged in a foolish sexual liaison, they join up
with some growling, swaggering, blond Nordic warriors with names like
Helfdane the Large (Clive Russell), Skeld the Superstitious (Richard
Bremmer), and Herger the Joyous (Dennis Storhoi), among
others. They're led by Buliwyf (Vladimir Kulich) on a quest to
liberate a kingdom across the sea from a mysterious, marauding tribe
of bear-like savages who have been terrorizing everyone - at least
when it gets foggy. (They filmed it in British Columbia where the
mists obviously rise on cue.) Based on Michael Crichton's 1976 novel,
"Eaters of the Dead," it combines rowdy, swashbuckling brutality with
a hint of the supernatural as they pursue the ferocious "terror that
must not be named." Director John McTiernan did this long before "The
Hunt for Red October" and he would be wise to leave it off his
resume. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The 13th Warrior" is a
ridiculously bloodthirsty 3, proving grisly gore has no limits.

A strong B+, "The 13th Warrior" is a medieval adventure picture climaxing in
the big good fight. Antonio plays an Arab poet/scholar banished from his
homeland who bumps into a boatload of Viking-types from the North just as
they decide to help out a village that is being massacred by an evil so bad,
you can't even say its name. Well, unlucky again, Banderas gets strapped in
as the 13th warrior of evil.
Once on the path to the village, Banderas listens keenly to the Northmen as
they gruffly mock each other and especially him in their own language.
Finally, Bandaras defends himself (his mother actually) in their native
tongue -- shocking them all into speaking English. (Well not really English,
I mean it's supposed to be still Northmen-ese. But since we are more or less
experiencing the adventure through the eyes and ears of Banderas, when he
finally learns their language so then do we understand the words.) This
turns out to be a rather clever way of avoiding subtitles, you feel that
you've instead learned a foreign language and therefore need no translation.
Rather straight to the point, the film offers camaraderie, honor, and coarse
field battles (not unlike "Braveheart") with great sound mixed into a fine
score. The dark cinematography is pocked only at times by abrupt color
changes that create bumpy seams between scenes. In fact, I felt a portion at
the beginning of the film had been clipped out all together. Still a strong
"B+" almost an "A-".
Starring Antonio Banderas, Vladimir Kulich, Dennis Storhoi, Daniel Southern,
Neil Maffin.
Directed by John McTiernan. Written by William Wisher and Warrne Lewis.
Produced by John McTiernan, Michael Crichton, Ned Dowd at Touchstone.
Rated R.

A work (novel, movie, whatever) only gets the story-behind-the-story
treatment when it's been part of conventional knowledge for so long that the
audience gets all the little in-jokes, can appreciate the asides, the irony,
etc. To look at it another way, a work only gets the story-behind-the-story
treatment when it's been overdeveloped in so many other directions that
burrowing into the myth of its own origins is about all that's left. This is
what Shakespeare in Love does for Romeo and Juliet, what Love and War tries
to do for Farewell to Arms. This is also what the 13th Warrior tries to do
for Beowulf--to tell it from the POV of a minor/forgotten participant in the
'actual' event, of which Beowulf is a loose retelling. The thing is,
however, Shakespeare in Love had the advantage of coming right on the heels
of 199x's Romeo + Juliet, meaning the play was still fresh in our minds, we
were already piqued for a little more iambic pentameter, please. The 13th
Warrior doesn't have such an advantage: disregarding the recent
sci-fiBeowulf (not released in America),there's been nothing to leave us
hungry for Old English, mead, all that.
Writer/director Michael Crichton (along with Diehard's John McTiernan) was
likely aware of this poor timing, too, so, for the big screen, this
adaptation of his historical novel Eaters of the Dead draws more on, say,
the enthematic swordplay of Braveheart, the 'good fight' against-all-odds
feel of Starship Troopers, and, further back, all the Dungeons &
Dragons-type movies (Flesh and Blood(1985), Excaliber, etc.) which also
manage to assemble a rag-tag group into some honorable world-saving
campaign.
In The 13th Warrior, that rag-tag group is composed of twelve Viking
volunteers, plus the initially-reluctant exiled Arabian poet Ibn Fadlan
(Antonio Banderas). The world this group has to save is a village in
Scandinavia. What they have to save the village from are creatures of
legend--eaters of the dead. Which is to say transgressors of one of our most
fundamental taboos: cannibalism. And, when fighting cannibals, you're
automatically the good guy, which is how Crichton manages to erase any
raping and pillaging Eric the Viking-type associations, making the
campaigners honorable. In addition, though--or, to really establish the bad
guys' inhumanity--the bad guys are never really personified, which makes Ibn
Fadlen and Co.'s series of skirmishes with them impersonal, as it would be
with a mass of animals. And this isn't necessarily a weakness, but more of
an identification trick: the bad guys are as dark and mysterious to us as
they are to Ibn Fadlan and Co. It does have a flipside, though: when the
battle gets pared down to the individual level, it doesn't have that same
finality you get with, say, Conan and Thulsa-Doom. Meaning we're not sure
it's over when it is, in fact, over.
If that was the only flaw, The 13th Warrior could possibly be a great movie.
But there's more. There's the castle-intrigue in the opening sequence, which
establishes so little that it's never mentioned again. There's Ibn Fadlan's
love interest in the village they're saving, which feels tacked on. There's
Antonio Banderas playing a devout Muslim. There's some unwisely foregrounded
translation difficulty (Old English to Latin, then Latin to Arabian, which
is cinematically rendered in English, etc) which slows things down
considerably. On the plus side, though, there is a lot of flashy AD&D-type
sword and horseplay, there's an ancient woman who talks with Yoda-syntax
('Seek you me?'), and there's even something of a transformation in Ibn
Fadlan, which allows him to put pen to paper again, write that epic. More
than all that, though, what The 13th Warrior leaves you with is a distinct
nostalgia, not for a period in history that's lost, but for a period in
history that never really was, at least as it's presented on-screen. Which
is to say it does get us to buy its illusion, if only for a while.

  As you should know, this summer has been less than memorable. With a total of
4 decent films, it's not a surprise that these big budget failures keep
appearing. With that said, you can pretty much predict what my opinion on "The
13th Warrior"  will be.
  The film is based on the Michael Crichton"Eaters Of the Dead", in which Ahmed
Ibn Fahdlan is banished from his country for looking at a wife of a king. After
tarveling for many months, he comes across a gang of NorseMen, who are forced
to pick 13 men to protect a town from mythical monsters who travel in the fog.
So, they start picking men, and are left without 1, thus Ahmed is choosen. So
far it sounds interesting right? Not when all of this takes place in 15
minutes. After that, they basically run around killing. That alone shows how
much a script is needed for a film, because once your story is introduced, you
have the rest of the film to start developing it. Obviously that's not the case
here.
  Even if you are going into the film expecting an action packed adventure, you
will be disappointed. Since all the action takes place in fog, it is constantly
hard to see a scene clearly due to those circumstances, and to poor camera
work. Can't the camera men sit still? I'd like to actually watch a film in
focus, but again, they failed to deliver that as well.
  The film moves on and on until the point, where you can care less about
anything but the popcorn you're eating. With corny dialogue, that the
characters laugh at for some odd reason, a script that goes nowhere, dull
action sequences, a predictable ending, and worst of all weak characters,
there's basically nothing to like here, except for maybe the set designs.
That's the only thing that honestly caught my interest. 
  When I heard that John Mctiernan, the director, wanted his name kept out of
the project, that made me wonder why? Well now I know. Crichton's greed forced
Mctiernan to edit his finished product, which led to a big arguement. What's
there to argue about anyway? The film couldn't be saved, no matter how much
they spent or casted.
  Seeing films like The Haunting and Big Daddy making money, I wouldn't be
surprised to see "The 13th Warrior" become a hit. Please do me a favor and save
your money at all costs, or else you will be lost in the fog, like the film
itself.

"The 13th Warrior" comes at the end of as summer where we've already
experienced man eating sharks ("Deep Blue Sea"), man eating crocodiles ("Lake
Placid") and even a man hunting witch ("The Blair Witch Project"). Now, "The
13th Warrior" presents a tribe of flesh eating men who believe that they are
bears. 
The story, if that's what you want to call it, follows Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan
(Antonio Banderas) an Arabian poet who falls in love with his king's wife and
is banished from his home land. He then travels to the land of the Vikings and
becomes an Ambassador to them. Eventually the Vikings are called upon to
protect the people of the village who are being hunted by the flesh eating men.
Thirteen warriors are chosen to go on the mission, and as you guessed it, Ahmed
is chosen as the thirteenth. He's not a warrior, and at first not well accepted
by the Vikings, but as the movie advances he'll have to prove himself both on
and off the battlefield.
That's basically the entire plot. There is also a romantic subplot that has
been so badly mishandled and, one assumes, drastically cut that you begin to
wonder why the filmmakers didn't just edit out all of the scenes attaining to
that part of the story. Instead they chose to leave just enough of those scenes
in to annoy the viewer. 
The film is basically non- stop action and when it pauses and tries to develop
a story it becomes a laughing stock. The battle scenes, although well
choreographed, are not involving and not the least bit exciting. We don't get
to know any of the characters and so we don't care who lives and who dies. The
film, which wants to be Beowolf, comes across more as a failed action-adventure
story aspiring to epic proportions but not achieving it on any levels.
It was directed by John McTiernan who's, "The Thomas Crown Affair" is also
playing in theaters currently. And it's not that McTiernan worked
simultaneously on both films but that, "The 13th Warrior" was placed on the
shelf for so long with the studio just waiting for a time to dump it on
audiences. It belongs back on the shelf.

         Two kinds of movies wind up spending a lot of time on a studio
shelf: pictures that are so offbeat or unusual they give Hollywood's
marketing gurus sleepless nights, or films that are so wretched the
producers are ashamed to let them out.
 "The 13th Warrior" has been killing time in the vault at
Touchstone Pictures for two years, and not because it's an unappreciated
work of art. In fact, director John McTiernan reportedly washed his
hands of the movie after run-ins with Michael Crichton, whose novel
"Eaters of the Dead" was the basis for "Warrior," and seeing the
finished product, there's no mystery as to why McTiernan doesn't want to
be associated with it. Some cinematic fiascos at least provide a few
unintentional laughs; "Warrior" is simply a mess.
 It does, however, offer the sight of Antonio Banderas (in
eyeliner, no less) struggling to portray an Arab soldier, which must be
one of the most curious casting choices since Demi Moore played a
Puritan. In the proper role, Banderas can be a superb actor, as
evidenced by his films with director Pedro Almodovar, such as "Women on
the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" and "Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!". But
since making a much ballyhooed move to America in the early 1990s,
Banderas has missed more frequently than he's hit. This turkey won't
help balance the scale.
 The released version of "Warrior" must have been considerably
shorter than what McTiernan originally intended, since the movie opens
with a hasty narrated sequence explaining how our hero Ahmed (Banderas)
was banished to the northlands after taking a fancy to the caliph's
woman. One might also assume preview audiences were baffled by certain
segments of the film since voice-overs are constantly telling us what's
happening at any given time.
 For example, when Ahmed's party is chased by bandits who
suddenly retreat at the sight of a Viking ship, someone cries out "Look!
They are going! They are leaving!" over a shot of the cowards riding
away. Later, Ahmed pulls off the bearskin mask of a fallen enemy and
sees a human face underneath the fur. "It's a man, it's a man, it's a
man," he says, just to make sure we understand.
At the same time, the screenplay by William Wisher and Warren
Lewis does a pitiful job of establishing any sort of credibility in the
basic situation or of creating any characters worth paying attention to.
When Ahmed and his new Norsemen pals decide to take on the "terror that
has no name," a band of cannibalistic underground dwellers who are
terrorizing a settlement, no one is likely to care whether or not they
succeed. The good guys seem almost as uncouth and unappealing as the
flesh-eaters.
 The meant-to-be-rousing battles in "Warrior" are constantly
sabotaged by having been shot in medium close-up (so that we can't see
much of anything except torsos) with a hand-held camera that always
seems to miss the real action. Though a lot of heads and limbs go flying
in the course of the film, the fights are so chaotic and murky even the
gore is a bore. James Sanford

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
For some reason, films that begin with the word `thirteen' never seem to
be very good.  Anybody remember The Thirteenth Floor?  Didn't think so.
The best of the bunch is probably the cheesy 1960 B-flick 13 Ghosts
(filmed in `Illusion-O' by William Castle), where weak-hearted viewers
could opt to not see the spooks that appeared on the screen by looking
through a special hand-held viewer.
Could film titles containing `thirteen' doom the movie?  If they are, in
fact, cursed, then somebody at Disney must not know about it.  They
actually changed the name of this picture to The Thirteenth Warrior.  It
was originally called Eaters of the Dead, like the Michael Crichton book
on which it was based.  Maybe somebody wanted to distance it from Fox's
spring cannibal flop Ravenous.  Warrior has actually been finished for
quite some time and, for some reason, dusted off for a late summer
release.
Coming off as an attempt to combine Braveheart and Star Wars, Warrior
tells the story of an Arab who is forced to join a group of brawny
Scandinavians that hit the road to save a village from destruction at
the hands of an unspeakable evil.  He is far from being a great
mercenary and actually just happens to be in the wrong place at the
wrong time Â a toothless old seer says that the village will be saved by
twelve Nordic brutes and one man `who isn't from the North.'  Let me
also point out that the hag spoke one language, which was translated
into another Scandinavian dialect, which was in turn translated into
something else, and yet again interpreted into the Arab language spoken
by the protagonist.  The result seems like an old Swedish film being
uncovered and dubbed by Omar Shariff.  And when was the last time you
shelled out eight bucks to see one of those?
The Arab, played by Antonio Banderas (The Mask of Zorro), sets off with
the twelve barbarians the following morning.  He can't understand what
they're saying, can't lift their giant battle-swords and rides a puny
little horse.  Sounds like my first day of high school.  Although they
are a jovial bunch, almost constantly laughing even though they're
preparing to throw down with something so bad that its name dare not
pass their lips, the men are skeptical of Banderas, and shorten his
hell-a-long Arab name to Ibn (or `son of').
During one particularly silly scene, the film shows Ibn slowly learning
the Scandinavian dialect by silently listening to his mates talk around
the campfire every night.  When he finally masters the language, the
music swells like Luke had just used The Force for the first time.  Ibn
also stops at a blacksmith to whittle his heavy sword into a thin
scimitar and begins to fit into his new surroundings.
Yeah, the battle scenes are fun, but in an attempt to conceal the evil
force the warriors are fighting, they are left murky and jerky.  By the
way, the invincible forces sort of look like a saber-tooth bear that
walks upright and rides horses.  Try to keep your eyes from rolling back
into your skull when a crazy old village woman tells the warriors that
the only way to stop the creatures is to kill their Queen.  How
original!
Adapted for the screen by William Wisher Jr., who penned Terminator 2:
Judgment Day, as well as Crichton's upcoming Airframe, and directed by
John McTiernan (The Thomas Crown Affair Â which he had time to make
after this), Warrior is a mess of a film.  It's not the worst film in
the world, but if you pro-rate its entertainment value over what it must
have cost to make, you've got one heck of a stinker.  I wish that there
were a special viewer for this `thirteen' film Â one that would turn it
into something else.  (1:54 - R for bloody battles and carnage)

 These are the dog days of summer, that time of year when the kids go back
to school and the movie studios clear their shelves of junk that has been
languishing for a year or two.
 "The 13th Warrior" is a prime example. Filmed about two years ago, this
wannabe-epic, directed by John McTiernan of "Die Hard" fame and produced by
Michael Crichton, is based on the latter's book "Eaters of the Dead."
 No matter what the title, though, this stinker barks. It has been
fermenting for a couple of years as the creative minds behind it continued
to cut, recut then cut again, trying to make steak out of ground beef.
 Nothing can help "The 13th Warrior," not even the star presence of Antonio
Banderas, who, throughout the proceedings, looks like he wishes he was
somewhere - anywhere - else. Of course, that is how his character is
supposed to act through much of this "Excaliber"-lite, but it sure looks
like he added more emphasis to that part of his characterization. Perhaps
he read the script.
 This is merely a B movie with A movie pretensions. A blaring score by
Jerry Goldsmith seems to do nothing but try to convince the audience that
"The 13th Warrior" is an important epic, when it is just a shallow shadow
play.
 Banderas plays Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan, an Arab ambassador who hooks up with a
band of Vikings. When another tribe of Vikings is threatened by a menace
too horrible to name, 13 warriors are chosen to fight this unknown horde.
The catch is, one of the volunteers has to be an outsider, so guess who
goes from diplomat to fighter?
 The question remains: Why only 13 to fight such a fearsome force? Perhaps
because a title such as "The 1,450th Warrior" doesn't sound as sexy.
 Well, the heroic baker's dozen travel to the north to meet and combat this
menace. Along the way, Banderas' Ahmed picks up the Norsemen's language
merely by listening to them talk night after night. Suddenly, he begins
speaking to them in their language and before you know it, everyone is
speaking English. Ah, the magic of movies.
 So, our intrepid band of warriors arrives at the besieged village and
begins battling the baddies. Of course, the battle scenes are filmed rather
darkly, with lots of fog and smoke, thus making it hard to distinguish who
is killing who.
 But it really doesn't matter. The Norsemen all talk about Valhalla and how
great fighting is and how they have no fear, yadda, yadda, yadda.
 Nothing much else happens. People get beheaded and chopped to ribbons.
Body parts and gore fly everywhere, and then the end credits roll.
 "The 13th Warrior" is like those silly costume dramas Universal released
during the early and mid-1950s starring Tony Curtis, Jeff Chandler or Rock
Hudson. At least, they did not take themselves as seriously as those who
conceived "The 13th Warrior."
 Yes, it was an unlucky day for filmgoers when Touchstone finally decided
to do some housecleaning and foist this puppy on an unsuspecting public.

Fahdlan (Antonio Banderas, looking somber and pensive in heavy eye liner),
a diplomat and poet in 10th century Baghdad.  Banished to an unpleasant
nomadic ambassadorship after a dalliance with a powerful man's wife, Ibn
Fahdlan happens upon a group of Norsemen who have recently lost their
king.  When another king sends word that help is needed against a hideous
foe, the heir apparent Buliwyf (Vladimir Kulich) leads a band of thirteen
warriors -- including the reluctant Ibn Fahdlan -- to defeat the ghoulish
Wendol, who eat those they slay.
     All right, so the Arab hero is played by a Spaniard -- Hollywood
needs to crawl before it can stagger in a remotely straight line.  The
problem with THE 13th WARRIOR isn't its multicultural sensitivity, but the
unlikely context in which that subtext is placed.  At its core, the film
is the kind of swords-and-shields romp little seen since the early '80s
heyday of Schwarzenegger as CONAN THE BARBARIAN and Singer as THE
BEASTMASTER.  There are dimly lit battles, inhuman foes, tankards of ale
and much bonding between brothers-in-arms.  That the bonding occurs
between rambunctious polytheistic Nordic guys and a devout Muslim gives
the narrative a funky anachronistic flavor -- "Dungeons and Dragons" for
the "why can't we all just get along" '90s.
     There's nothing automatically off-putting about watching men
exchanging prayers in the first millennium -- it's not as though the 20th
century introduced the concept of tolerance.  It just happens to be the
most obvious example of THE 13th WARRIOR's insistence on attending to
subplots and subtext when it hasn't provided the basic framework for an
adventure.  Ibn Fahdlan's Norse comrades are so interchangeable and
lacking in personality that the press notes identify them both by name and
by some trait that might jog the memory -- "Helfdane (Fat)," "Ragnar
(Dour)," and so on.  The Wendol remain shadowy and indistinct, never
developing into truly threatening villains despite the gasps that
accompany the mention of their name.  Meanwhile, there's time spent on a
blink-and-you'll-miss-it romantic interlude for Ibn Fahdlan, and a bit of
Norse political intrigue which exists largely to provide one character a
chance to scowl and flip his fur cloak dramatically every time he appears
on screen.  Thank heavens for the occasional anarchic battle scene to
remind us that this is in fact an adventure film.
     Those battle scenes certainly serve their visceral purpose, perhaps
enough so to please the blood 'n' guts crowd.  It's just that the whole
mess is often too busy to get down to business.  In an early scene, Ibn
Fahdlan and his travelling companion Melchisidek (Omar Sharif) meet with
the Norsemen for the first time.  While Buliwyf speaks in Norwegian, one
of his men (Dennis Storhoi) translates into Latin for Melchisidek, who
then translates into Arabic (which we hear as English) for Ibn Fahdlan.
On the one hand, it's sort of a nice touch, emphasizing the culture clash
with which Ibn Fahdlan must contend; on the other hand, it makes the scene
such a jumble of cuts and translations that it grows dizzying.  McTiernan
has toyed with a pseudo-profound action film, and wound up with only a
pseudo-action film, another noble effort to file in the Department of
Token Praise.

Vikings v. Bears?  No, this isn't the lineup for Monday Night Football.
 Rather, these are the two opposing forces that will battle to the
death in "The 13th Warrior," a film that is as dramatically flat as it
is gratuitously gory.  Based on Michael Crichton's book, Eaters of the
Dead, this Viking saga tries to evoke the mysticism of fabled Norsemen
and the glorious battles that they fought.  Their strength and honor
would eventually etch their place in history among the greatest
warriors that ever picked up a sword.  Luckily for the Vikings,
however, their warring abilities were not as clumsy as this film.
Antonio Bandaras is Ahmed, a travelling ambassador.  Accompanied by his
friend (Omar Shariff in a cameo), they eventually come across a small
Viking village.  We see that the Vikings are an extremely proud group
whose greatest strength is their fortitude.  They laugh heartily, revel
in their arrogance, and sing songs of battles won.   But their
festivities are about to be halted when a messenger boy arrives to tell
the village leader that a great evil is threatening their land.  Help
is needed quickly.  An elderly, fortune-telling witch arrives.  After a
brief incantation, she proclaims that 12 warriors and one more "not of
Norse blood" are needed to ensure victory.  Personally, I always wonder
why people believe these oracles when they look so haggardly and on the
brink of insanity.  Nonetheless, 12 men eagerly accept their place
while Ahmed becomes the pivotal 13th. The group then sets out to do the
greatest battle of their lives.
Of course during their ride, Ahmed becomes the target of fun for the
other 12 burly Viking warriors.  But he ably shows that it's not the
size of the dog in the fight but rather the size of the fight in the
dog.  He is able to overcome the proud arrogance of the Vikings, but
will his skills (and that of the group) be enough to defeat whatever
evil is menacing the countryside?  It does not look promising.  These
creatures, resembling bears, are strong and have high morale.  They are
fearless and display a desire for decapitating the heads of their
enemies.  They attack by the hundreds and the next strike will come
soon.  The warriors prepare their defenses and pray to their Gods. 
They are ready to sacrifice their lives.  "This is a good way to die,"
says one of the fallen warriors.
Despite the larger-than-life battle sequences, I was unmoved by the
entire experience.  At many points, I was even confused.  For example,
somewhere in the middle of the film, a sub-plot creeps up involving the
Prince of the threatened land.  He seems to have an agenda to elevate
himself to greater power during this crisis.  However, the sub-plot
never fully materializes, and we are left scratching our heads as to
the purpose of its inclusion.  There are other questions that I had,
but the real problem was that the story (little of it that there was)
offered no characters to love or hate.  The leader of the Viking
warriors had the most charisma.  However, Banderas's role is completely
underwritten and it is unclear why being the 13th warrior makes him so
special.  An entire rewrite of the Ahmed character is in order.   
Also, much of the action takes place during torrential downpours or at
night, which made battles very difficult to follow.  I would have
preferred more time looking at the Viking culture and how their beliefs
shaped their decision to do battle against the enemy.  As it stands,
the film manages more confusion than intensity.  It would make Thor
cry.

As a late summer action/adventure entry, The 13th Warrior didn't look
promising. The production was delayed, reshoots were rumored, and the
film sat on the shelf for many months. There was also a feud between
director John McTiernan and author Michael Chricton, and the title was
changed from Eaters of the Dead (the original name of Chricton's novel)
to The 13th Warrior. Despite all of the apparent problems, the finished
product is a rousing sword-play epic with impressive battle sequences
off-setting some laughable dialogue and a non-existent plot.
Antonio Banderas was the hero of last summer's The Mask of Zorro, and
here he attempts to duplicate his success. Banderas plays an Arab
ambassador named Ahmed Ibn Fadlan, who is sent out to learn the ways of
the Vikings. He stumbles into their society in just the nick of time. A
messenger arrives, informing the warriors that his people have requested
their help in fending off a group of oncoming attackers. But these
attackers are not human. They are the Wendol - half-man, half-bear
savages who carry torches and destroy everything in their path. A
thirteen man defense team is dispatched, and Fadlan unwillingly becomes
one of the warriors on the dangerous mission.
What I've described is essentially the entire plot of The 13th Warrior.
What remains is a series of spectacular (and very gory) combat battles,
in which the Vikings attempt to defend neighboring tribes from the group
of beasts who decapitate their victims in very messy ways. Don't be
deceived when this gets off to a terribly rocky start. When McTiernan
brings out the big guns (so to speak), everything becomes easier to
swallow. The battle scenes are well-edited, consistently exciting, and
always accompanied by the marvelous score by Jerry Goldsmith.  The
intellectual aspects of the film are poorly handled, but the technical
credits and gorgeous landscapes practically clear your mind of any prior
ugliness in the script.
The are many problems in that area. When first accompanying the Vikings,
Fadlan learns their language by simply `watching them talk' (yeah,
sure....) There are plenty of these moments that you could speculate
about, or you could simply enjoy all of the bloody combat and beheadings
for what they are: a fun time at the movies. McTiernan also manages to
turn a weak script into a sumptuous epic, creating a believable
situation efficiently enough so that we don't ask any questions. Don't
look for The 13th Warrior to be among the nominees for Best Adapted
Screenplay award at next year's Oscars; the action scenes and impressive
sword tactics are the real show here.
Another thing I liked was the surprising range of the supporting cast.
You may think the other 12 Viking warriors would be dismissed as window
dressing, with lines like `Kill them all!' popping up occasionally. A
few of these characters actually show some depth; among them is Herger
(Dennis Storhoi), who cracks some amusing jokes and calls Fadlan `little
brother'. And then there's the Viking leader (Vladimir Kulich), who
displays more personality traits than his character limitations could
have allowed, even if he still is basically a big lug. Omar Sharif is
welcome as Fadlan's translator and guide when he first encounters the
Vikings, with a few brief but memorable early moments on screen.
The summer of 1999 hasn't been a memorable one, at least in the movie
department. The 13th Warrior is an exhilarating little adventure that
has more quality than you might expect, even with a pea-brained plot and
individual scenes of ridiculousness. For action fans craving some
carnage that the season failed to present, this one may just hit the
spot.

When a pair of films from the same director gets released just three
weeks apart, it could mean one of two things: that the recently
overworked individual is due for a well-deserved rest, or that either of
these movies has been sitting in a studio safe for a while and the
timing is merely a coincidence. The latter's the case with John
McTiernan and "The Thirteenth Warrior," which finally hits theatres a
year and counting after its original spring '98 opening - and fast on
the heels of McTiernan's "The Thomas Crown Affair" remake, a flick that
got good reviews. You don't have to believe superstitions to wager a
guess that "Thirteenth" won't be so lucky.
Reportedly shelved following skirmishes between McTiernan and producer
Michael Crichton, whose "Eaters of the Dead" novel provides "Warrior"'s
source (and its initial title), this messy melange of culture-clash
drama and brutal warfare feels empty and sluggish - sorta like
"Braveheart" without any of the passion. But the bloodshed certainly
remains: There's enough carnage on display here to satisfy those in
search of purely visceral thrills, though please note that the
admittedly pungent battle sequences containing all this death and
dismemberment alternate with talky passages interminable in their
dullness.
These circa-10th century clashes involve a roving band of cannibalistic
creatures capable of decapitating opponents with their bare hands and a
dozen Norse soldiers out to stop them from terrorizing the Viking
countryside. The good guys are loud, crude, often unintelligible and -
judging from their highly icky hygiene habits -- pretty smelly to boot,
which makes them perfect foils for the dignified Arab ambassador
(Antonio Banderas) who tags along quite reluctantly. They're also so
hard to tell apart that it hardly matters when a few of them meet
violent demises. You'll wince, you'll groan, you'll grouse, "Haven't we
seen this guy killed twice before?"
Banderas stands confused amidst the chaos, partaking mostly from a
distance as savages in Darth Maul facepaint and draped in the latest
animal-skin fashion run amok. He's not the hero - his soulful eyes and
lean build don't exactly herald a champion of Shwarzenegger proportions
- and "The Thirteenth Warrior" wisely doesn't pretend he is, allowing
his foreign and physically imposing co-stars to step into the spotlight
when the going gets rough. Let the characters interaction sans swords
and shields, however, and there's still a struggle - for the audience to
follow or even care about the story.
It isn't the end until audiences have witnessed a half-baked romance,
murky political intrigue, veteran actor Omar Sharif ("Funny Girl")
dropping by in a cameo role and a climactic "Indiana Jones and the
Temple of Doom"-esque chase through the villains' underground lair. All
this clutter receives stunning visual treatment courtesy of
cinematographer Peter Menzies Jr., but the collaboration between "Die
Hard"-helmer McTiernan and "Jurrasic Park"-creator Crichton should have
yielded more than sumptuous sights, graphic action and unintentionally
telling moments. Heard during "The Thirteenth Warrior"'s final scene: a
dog whimpering. How appropriate.

Grade: D-
In "The 13th Warrior," Arab poet Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan (Antonio Banderas) finds
himself kicked out of Baghdad for feeling up the king's old lady.  With his
translator (screen legend Omar Sharif in a small role), Ahmed heads north to
act as ambassador to the Northmen (Vikings).  He finds a group of warriors
mourning the loss of their king.  A messenger soon arrives from another kingdom
requesting assistance.  A soothsayer says that thirteen warriors must answer
the summons, twelve Northmen and one outsider.  Thus, Ahmed becomes the "13th
warrior."  
On the trip, Ahmed manages to learn the Vikings' language by listening to their
fireside conversations.  A bit far-fetched, it's true, but we have to swallow
it if this flick is going to manage a few lines of dialogue amidst the
grunting.  Ahmed, who's called "Ibn" by the Vikings, forms friendships with
Herger the Joyous (Dennis StorhÅi) and the Viking leader Buliwyf (Vladimir
Kulich).
When they arrive in the other kingdom, the thirteen warriors discover that
they're facing an army of supernatural cannibals that live up in the caves. 
Hereafter, most of the movie is battle scenes:  the cannibals attack the
Vikings, the Vikings attack the cannibals, the cannibals attack the . . . well,
you get the idea.  Just to add some action, there's also a Viking vs. Viking
duel.
Other movies insert scenes between the fights; these scenes are called
character development.  I suspect that "The 13th Warrior" had a better script
at one time and that it fell through the cracks because of the tag-team
direction.  The movie started off in the hands of John McTiernan (you'll notice
a lot of similarities between "Warrior" and McTiernan's "Predator," including
the chittering jungle sounds).  Somewhere along the line, McTiernan bailed and
Michael Crichton took over.  Crichton, whose novel "Eaters of the Dead" is the
basis for "Warrior," has directed a small assortment of goofy science-fiction
"thrillers":  "Westworld," "Coma," "Looker," "Runaway."  Their result of their
consecutive efforts is a murky and pointless movie.
Perhaps what "The 13th Warrior" needs more than anything else is a villain. 
The "eaters of the dead" are a faceless mob in blackface.  They have no
personality, and by the end they don't even seem particularly threatening.  The
audience has no target toward which to channel its aggression.  McTiernan
should know about the importance of an interesting villain; it was his "Die
Hard" that made villains seem fun and attracted big-name stars to the evil
roles in action films.
"The 13th Warrior" suffers from a lack of vision.  It wants to be "Predator"
meets "Braveheart" meets "The Magnificent Seven" meets "Dances with Wolves." 
With so many competing goals, all it can do is echo what it might have been. 
It might have been a satisfying action film.  It might have been a
beautifully-rendered medieval epic.  It might have been a thought-provoking
examination of the meeting of cultures.  What a shame it turned out to be
nothing in particular.
Bottom Line:  If you want to see Antonio swing his sword, rent "The Mask of
Zorro."

In a land of filth, muck and bad hair days, Antonio Banderas in THE 13TH
WARRIOR manages to keep his GQ looks.  With spotless, well-pressed
robes, he must know the location of the only dry cleaning establishment
in the tenth century land of the Vikings in which the story is set.
Eventually his perfect coiffure will be marred, but, even with a few
facial scars, his beauty will shine through.  This is good since there
is precious little else to do in the movie other than admire Banderas.
The script by William Wisher, Jr. and Warren Lewis, based on Michael
Crichton's novel called "Eaters of the Dead," is ludicrously bad.
Insults include such asinine epithets as "you pig eating son of a
whore."  And when Ibn Fadlan (Banderas) says "ah" a couple of times in
mild pain, he is reproached by the story's female lead (Diane Venora).
"That's a woman's sound," she admonishes him.
Along with Banderas, who is chosen to be the thirteenth warrior, are
actors playing the 12 other warriors plus a large assortment of
supporting cast and extras.  Since no visible acting occurs in the
movie, there is little point in listing any more names.  Suffice it to
say that most of the people approach their roles as Banderas does, which
is to spend most of the time in a pensive and vacant stare, as if he
were contemplating why he let his agent talk him into this film in the
first place.
For the first 15 minutes of the movie, when most of it is in unsubtitled
Norse (I'm not making this up), Ibn goes north with the other warriors
to save another settlement from a group so scary that they dare not call
its name.  These super strong bad guys like to eat the dead.
Unlike EYES WIDE SHUT in which the studio had to insert digital fig
leaves in the form of people in order to obtain a marketable R rating,
THE 13TH WARRIOR suffers no such problem.  The MPAA does not need to
threaten this film with an NC-17 since human beings are only being
hacked to death, with severed arms, sliced off heads and blood spurting
everywhere.  The humans in this movie commit atrocities, not sex, so
there is no need to protect the viewers' eyes.
After almost two hours of mindless and uninteresting action, the movie
finally stops.  Never does it realize that its one salvation would as a
parody.  From beginning to end, it treats its subject with the
seriousness of a documentary.  Not once does it have the good sense to
lighten up.
THE 13TH WARRIOR runs 1:52.  It is rated R for bloody battles and
carnage and would be acceptable for older teenagers.

I first saw the teaser trailer for John McTiernan's "The 13th Warrior" in the 
Fall of 1997. Of course, back then it was still called "Eaters of the Dead," 
which is the same title as the novel it's based upon, by Michael Crichton 
("Jurassic Park"). Sometime in 1998, however, it generically was retitled, 
"The 13th Warrior." Does a name really play a part in how good an actual 
movie is? Well, no, probably not, but my interest in seeing the picture 
plummeted down at the speed of light at the thought of this new name, and 
then the movie kept being pushed back and pushed back to the point where I 
began to wondering if it was ever going to be released. Stories and rumors 
abound of the studio, Buena Vista, frantically trying to reshoot and recut 
much of it after disasterous test screenings, much to the reluctance of 
McTiernan. Now that "The 13th Warrior" has finally been released theatrically 
over two years after it was filmed, it's difficult to say how McTiernan's cut 
might have turned out, but I know this much: no matter how much was reshot 
and edited, there is no possible way this film could be anything other than 
stupefyingly horrendous. Move over "Inspector Gadget"; I think I've found a 
new "Worst Film of 1999."
>From what I can gather about the specifics of the film, "The 13th Warrior" 
has no signs of an actual plot, or even a reason for being made and wasting 
reportedly over $100-million. Shouldn't it be illegal to spend so much money 
on a movie that is akin to my cat's stool sample? Antonio Banderas cashes a 
paycheck as Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan, an Arab aristocrat who is banished from 
Baghdad after being accused of looking at the King's wife crossways. Taking 
up with a ragtag team of Norse mercenaries in the 10th-century, Ahmed is 
called upon to become the 13th warrior and travel to Europe to fight a 
barbarous tribe of half-man/half-beasts. "I am not a warrior!" Ahmed says, 
but pretty soon, he will be.
There isn't an act, scene, shot, or frame in "The 13th Warrior" that I could 
say I liked, which is no small feat to achieve considering that, even in my 
review for "Inspector Gadget," I mentioned I liked one cast member. Abruptly 
starting off with nary a line of exposition, the film's structure goes like 
this: man forced to become 13th warrior, man fights barbarians, man leaves. 
Who is this man, you ask? I couldn't tell you, aside for saying that he is 
played by Antonio Banderas with a lot of eye-liner on. Throughout the 
excruciating 106 minutes this movie takes to reach its victorious end credits 
(victorious because I knew I could finally leave the theater!), there is not 
one fact I could tell you about any of the thirteen warriors, aside from 
saying that they love to fight and casually stab each other with swords, only 
to think nothing of it. And if we don't grow accustomed to the main 
characters, or feel like we've even been properly introduced, how do the 
filmmakers expect any of us to care at all about how things will turn out and 
who will live and die?
The screenplay was written by two people: William Wisher and Warren Lewis. 
They must have been comatose when they penned it, because I'll be damned if I 
can detect anything even resembling a script at work here. The movie's idea 
of a romantic subplot has Ahmed enchanging literally one line of dialogue 
with a pretty villager (Maria Bonnevie), only to see them in bed together in 
the next scene. The movie's idea of excitement is having the whole film 
revolve around three big battles with the barbarians, with lots of cut-off 
heads flying about, and no sense of understanding how to set up an action 
set-piece. And the movie's idea of atmosphere is having the cinematography, 
by Peter Menzies Jr., be so dimly-lit and washed out that, on a visual 
stance, you feel like turning your head away every minute. Maybe an 
overwhelming amount of dirt particles got on the camera lense, and director 
McTiernan never even realized a little Windex would do the trick. Or, better 
yet, maybe they spent so much money on the "breathtaking," "extravagant," 
"one-of-a-kind" action sequences, that they didn't have enough left to invest 
in some bright lights. That was supposed to be an example of sarcasm, just to 
let you know.
"The 13th Warrior" ends with them beating the barbarians, and Ahmed getting 
on a ship to sail off. Since there was no actual entertainment value that 
stemmed from one second of the film, nor did we ever satisfactorily learn who 
the barbarians were, why they were fighting, or even one character trait from 
the "heroic" central figures, I'd love a little insight into the point of 
making the film in the first place. "The 13th Warrior" is the most depressing 
cinematic experience to grace (or curse) the silver screen this year.

Starring Antonio Banderas, Diane Venora, Omar Sharif, Vladimir Kulich,
Dennis StorhÅi, Maria Bonnevie. Rated R.
Michael Crichton is quite a character; his films could use a little. The
Thirteenth Warrior, John McTiernan's long-delayed adaptation of
Crichton's Eaters of the Dead is gleefully entertaining in its tongue-
in-cheek delivery and its pseudo-rite-of-passage tale, but its bloody
battle scenes lack soul. A factor to elevate the movie above mediocrity
seems to always be missing. It's campy fun, but it fails to ever become
good filmmaking.
McTiernan casts Antonio Banderas as Ahmahd ibn Fahdalan, a Muslim (yeah,
right) who travels the world as an ambassador. He wonders into Norse
territory and meets a group of engimatic warriors. As he is wining and
dining with them, a message is brought: the Norse are being attacked by
horrendous monsters and the warriors must choose thirteen men to fight
them. The catch: the thirteenth man must be from another, preferably
faraway land. Three guesses on who the chosen one is. A hint: it's a
Muslim who looks oddly like Zorro.
The lucky baker's dozen sets off into the Viking lands to seek out and
destroy this mysterious nemesis. An unwitting Ahmahd soon winds up
discovering his warrior instincts. It turns out that even though he may
not be hot stuff with a sword, he can wreak havoc if you give him a
really big knife. Soon, he is fighting alongside his companions and
getting passionate about his mission, which he did not choose to accept.
Along with dedication comes the respect of his new peers. Before he
knows it, he is a warrior -- and a man.
The Thirteenth Warrior takes its story very seriously, but its delivery
has intermittent touches of wit. The film does its best to rid itself of
any sense of pretension. There it succeeds: it isn't a significant movie
in any way shape or form and it knows it, making its sole purpose to
have some fun with its premise. Is it fun? On occasion. The movie is at
its best when there is no fighting going on; it becomes curiously airy
then, and as such, entertaining.
The problems lie in the battle scenes. While the rest of the film is
inventive and sometimes even exhilirating, its action centerpieces come
off as almost perfunctory. There is nothing fresh in the fight scenes;
heads roll, blood flies through the air, but it all blends together.
There is little that's distinctive or that can grab our attention. It's
sensationally gory, but it lacks the audaciousness to make the gore
amount to much of anything.
It is obviously difficult to accept Antonio Banderas as Ahmahd.
Everytime he took out a sword or a knife, I expected him to carve a "Z"
into something. He is a good actor, but he has been horridly miscast. I
never had the feeling that I was watching anything other than Antonio
Banderas playing someone he wasn't meant to play. Dennis StorhÅi, on the
other hand, is interesting as the Viking warrior who befriends Ahmahd.
He's the sort of wisecracking sidekick-but-not-really we've come to
expect from these kinds of movies, but with a twist: he is the
protagonist's mentor rather than helper.
Here's a movie that works like a charm until it gets to the scenes that
are supposed to be its highlight. Almost everything here works, except
the most important element. As a result, The Thirteenth Warrior is just
plain ok.

STARRING:  Antonio Banderas, Diane Venora, Omar Sharif, Vladimir Kulich
DIRECTOR:  John McTiernan, Michael Crichton
WRITTEN BY:  William Wisher, Michael Crichton (based on Crichton's
"Eaters of the Dead")
At last, the long wait to bring this adaptation of Crichton's 1976 novel
(an interesting blend of an actual manuscript and the epic
poem "Beowulf") is over, giving audiences nationwide a chance to see...
a moderately entertaining, fairly by-the-numbers
Hollywood action film that lacks the scope and significance to make it
really click.
Banderas plays Ahmad Ibn-Fahdlan, a 10th-century Arab emissary who fools
around with the wrong woman and ends up
essentially banished to the North, where he meets a rowdy group of
Vikings.  After word is received that a village in the
Vikings' homeland is being threatened, he is chosen in typical
Hollywood-clichÃ© fashion to accompany twelve Norsemen who
will investigate the situation.  During the journey, Ibn (as he is
dubbed by the Vikings) quickly learns their language in typical
Hollywood-clichÃ© fashion.  When they arrive, they find partially eaten
bodies (which Banderas helpfully informs us have been
"gnawed upon") and a distinct lack of men.  That evening, they are
attacked by a group of Wendels (rhymes with Grendel, get
it?), mysterious creatures who just as quickly vanish, carting away
their own dead (along with the heads of a couple of Vikings
for good measure).  Soon enough, they are beset by a horde of Wendels,
which appear to be a hybrid of human and bear.
Barely holding out after the second night, they consult a local oracle
(an old, gap-toothed, Hollywood-clichÃ© hag that talks like
a Scandinavian Yoda) to determine a way to counterattack the Wendels.
The rest of the film deals with their covert raid on the
Wendels' lair, and the resulting final battle for the village before
reaching its resolution just shy of the two-hour mark.
Watching this film, one gets the feeling that McTiernan was too busy
this summer with his remake of "The Thomas Crown
Affair" and the upcoming "Airframe" (also with Crichton) to give "The
13th Warrior" his full attention.  Instead, he seems content to cobble
together a few hoary-but-useful Hollywood clichÃ©s, throw in some
recycled scenes from his own "Predator", and let Crichton's and
Banderas' reputations do the rest.  Banderas, in fact, is his usual
charismatic self, but he's at his most appealing when acting with women,
and this film gives him very little opportunity (not that this is a bad
thing; McTiernan and Crichton are to be credited with paying only lip
service to the love-interest aspect of the plot, which didn't need to be
any larger).  The film's major flaw is a glaring lack of
characterization of the Vikings, who have to be summarized with little
descriptions like "The Superstitious" during the end credits just so the
audience will remember who they were!  The actors are all suitably
craggy and bearded, but that's not enough.  The exception to this rule
is the extremely well-cast Kulich ("Firestorm") as Buliwyf, the group's
newly crowned King.  With his size and Nordic features (especially a
mane of blond hair that makes him look like the Marvel Comics version
of  Thor), he is completely believable as the strongest and most capable
warrior of the bunch.  Still, more time could have been spent developing
these characters, even at the expense of some of the battle sequences.
Speaking of which, they are some of the film's better moments, despite
their obvious debt to "Braveheart"'s skirmishes (which already seem in
danger of becoming a Hollywood clichÃ©).  The two films also share some
great cinematography; British Columbia fills in for the fjords, and
provides some striking coastal vistas and misty forest settings.
Unfortunately, "The 13th Warrior" lacks the epic scale and sense of
historical importance that distinguished Mel Gibson's masterpiece.
Combined with the lack of character development and the weight of all
those Hollywood clichÃ©s, it ends up feeling like a Reader's Digest
condensation of the book.
Nonetheless, it is well paced, the costume design is noteworthy, and the
"Beowulf" references sprinkled here and there (like
Buliwyf's line about luck resulting from courage) are a nice touch.
Action fans likely won't be disappointed.

The 13th Warrior reeks so badly of melodrama and poor acting that it 
carries a worst scent than a canine's least appetizing residue. The 
best part of the film would be a close contest between the closing 
credits and a brief moment in the middle where the screen goes entirely 
white and you hope that the film has slipped and caught ablaze in the 
projector. My vote goes for the ending credits, where you can start 
trying to put the awful experience behind you.
Ibn Fahdlan (Antonio Banderas) is an important official who is banished 
from his home for sleeping with another man's wife. He encounters a 
group of Norse warriors who convince him to join them on a mysterious 
journey to be taken by 13 men. Fahdlan is chosen as the 13th and last 
warrior in a moment that is so desperately overacted and overdone that 
numerous persons at the screening I attended broke out into laughter.
The movie proves to be a new low point for Banderas, who's acting 
seems closer to that of his role as the lover and caretaker for a dying 
gay man in 1993's Philadelphia, than that of a warrior. In the 
film's supposed pay off scene, he exclaims "I was wrong, these are not 
men!", a line intended to be the most memorable quote of the production. 
Unfortunately, Banderas delivers it in a fashion that makes Chevy 
Chase's career look like Oscar material.
The film, based on Michael Crichton's best selling novel, Eaters of 
the Dead was shot under that name some three years ago, and after 
numerous rewrites not only does the dialogue seem completely phony, but 
the plot is incredibly difficult to follow.
At the same time, The 13th Warrior makes you think about numerous 
questions. Questions like "Why do the characters always have perfect 
lighting on them even when it is pitch dark?", "Why does no one ever 
have blood cover both sides of their face, but rather just one side?" 
and finally, "Will the manager give me a refund?"
90 minutes into the 103 minute film, a man invites of the warriors "Come 
with me, there is a woman who can help." Unfortunately, there is nothing 
that could help this film. The most appropriate ending would have been 
for the 13 men to join hands, form a chorus line, and break into a 
rendition of "Springtime for Hitler."

After lying on the shelf for over a year, this epic tale based on Michael
Crichton's novel is released with little fanfare right before the Labour Day
weekend, a time generally reserved for servings of crap cinema. Is it that
bad? Not really. In fact, it does generate several scenes of decent combat,
but all in all, a wasted opportunity.
PLOT:
An exiled Arab is chosen to be the 13th warrior in a pack selected to defend
a king's homeland against the legendary half-man/half-bear predators from
the mist. The man is reluctant at first, but slowly acclimatizes himself to
the group and acquires the aptitudes of a true warrior.
CRITIQUE:
This movie starts off real slow and boring, has way too many scenes hidden
by darkness, way too many lines lost due to badly spoken dialogue, but does
offer a few invigorating sequences of violent battle and a couple of gory
scenes as well. If you are expecting another epic classic a la BRAVEHEART,
you may as well save your money right now, and rent a quick & easy pornos
instead. But if you don't mind a rinky-dink story and enjoy seeing
Viking-like men kick bear ass, this film might be of healthier interest to
you. I thought the second half of the film was much more enjoyable than the
first, but could not help but feel like there could have been so much more.
For one thing, it would have been nice to SEE many more of the battle
sequences, most of which were unfortunately masked by the darkness and lost
to my weak eyes. It also would have been nice to toss some speech therapists
the way of Antonio Banderas and the mighty Nordic men who all seemed to be
mumbling their incoherent lines through the entire gig.
On top of that, this is not necessarily a picture that needs to be seen on
the big screen. In fact, you may want to check it out on a lonely video
evening sometime next year, when the bad blood behind the making of the film
has all but dissipated. It may just go down better at that point. I also
think this film would have benefited from a name change. Forget THE 13TH
WARRIOR, which centres around the Banderas character, who to me, seemed
little more than a whiny beeyatch. How about the original novel title of
"Eaters of the Dead"!? Yeah, now there's a cool title! And those crazy
man-bears sure were creepy enough to merit that designation. Which reminds
me of a film that came out earlier this year, a cannibal tale it was, which
entertained me so much more than this sub-par offering. It was called
RAVENOUS (7.5/10) and supplied plenty of narrative, action and cannibalism
to whet anybody's bloody appetite. Now there's a movie to see! This one,
well, see it if you like films which start off slow, have plenty of scenes
in the dark, a few good battle sequences and incomprehensible men talking
bunk. Otherwise, stick to the cooler cannibal tale of 1999 and check out
RAVENOUS!
