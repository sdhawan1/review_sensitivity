The Road to El Dorado (2000) 1 1/2 stars out of 4. Featuring the vocal
talents of Kenneth Branagh, Kevin Kline, Rosie Perez, Armand Assante and
Edward James Olmos.
"The Road to El Dorado" is a bumpy one, filled with potholes and ruts.
 DreamWorks latest animation offering is pale and a tad old-fashioned
especially in lieu of the advances showcased in rival Disney's "Tarzan"
of last summer.
 It also is disappointing coming on the heels of DreamWorks magnificent
"Prince of Egypt," which was a splendid mixture of animation, story and
song.
 But "El Dorado's" main problem is in the screenplay. Any story set in
1519 that uses the common vernacular and contemporary jargon is a victim
of lazy writing.
 Perhaps it was done purposely for the young children who are the
movie's target audience. But hearing one Spaniard say to his amigo, `I
want in on the scam,' rings false.
 "The Road to El Dorado" seems to have been inspired by the old Bob
Hope-Bing Crosby-Dorothy Lamour series of the 1940s and 50s, in which
the intrepid trio visited such exotic places as Zanzibar, Morocco,
Singapore, Utopia, Rio, Bali and Hong Kong.
 At least those movies had some wit and style, most supplied by Hope and
Crosby's ad-libs.
 Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for "El Dorado." The film seems
to meander along at a pleasant pace. 
 Even the vocal talent cannot elevate this substandard production. 
 Kevin Kline is Tulio and Kenneth Branagh is Miguel, two lowlifes who
accidentally wind up on a ship heading for the New World. Miguel has won
a map in a crooked dice game showing the way to the fabled gold city of
El Dorado.
 Arriving in the New World, the two set out to find the city, which is
rather easily accomplished.
 Along the way they save Chel (Rosie Perez), an Indian maiden, and show
up the evil medicine man, Tzekel-Kan (Armand Assante).
 Unlike the Hope-Crosby tandem in which Bing was the brains while Bob
was usually the cowardly victim, there seems to be no clear delineation
between Tulio and Miguel. Only Miguel's blonde hair differentiates them.
 Perez, unfortunately, is totally miscast. You can take the girl out of
Brooklyn, but you can't take the Brooklyn out of the girl. Every word
she utters shatters the illusion the filmmakers are striving to create.
 The songs by Elton John and Tim Rice also are unremarkable, nowhere
near their compositions that helped make "The Lion King" such a success.
 Overall, "The Road to El Dorado" will satisfy the very young and
undemanding in the audiences. The older youngsters and adults may find
this adventure a bit of a bore.
 A lot of roadwork is needed to successfully pave the way to this "El
Dorado."

 THE ROAD TO EL DORADO is DreamWorks' second big attempt, after 1998's
PRINCE OF EGYPT, to break into Disney's monopoly on the animated film
business.  It is an effort as disappointing as the first.
 The one aspect of this film that fits squarely within genre conventions
is the subject matter.  Like such classics as BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and
ALADDIN, EL DORADO finds a classical fantasy in the lost city of gold,
couching it in a historical context: In this case is the Spanish
explorer Cortez's very real search for that mythical city.
Unfortunately though, Cortez is lost for the bulk of the film while we
are left to follow two roguish Spaniards (voiced by Kline and Branagh)
who stumble upon, in sequence, a map to El Dorado, Cortez's ship to the
New World, and El Dorado itself.  Once the two con artists find El
Dorado, they are of course hailed as Gods, and the bulk of the story
concerns just how they are going to carry out this charade and make off
with the gold back to Spain.  In the process, we are left with a
half-hearted conniving native medicine man voiced by Armand Assante as
our only hope for a true villain.  Once they find the lost city, the
plot follows turn for turn that of the 1975 Sean Connery vehicle, THE
MAN WHO WOULD BE KING.  One could argue that plagiarizing a great film
is not such a bad idea, considering a great bulk of the audience has
never seen said film or read the book it is based on.  Nonetheless, it
tends to irk any true movie fan to see great movies remade badly.
 Plagiarizing the plot is not the only evidence of cutting corners found
in this film; the action sequences also seem for the most part to have
been cut down into action shots.  Compared with TARZAN's extensive and
breathtaking use of deep canvas (the effect of making animation look
three-dimensional), EL DORADO feels downright static, at least until the
final climactic action sequence.  Likewise the dancing canvas we have
expected from musical numbers since FANTASIA are not only static, but
heavily infused with the fluorescent hues and musical bits from the
likes of YELLOW SUBMARINE.
 Witnessing DreamWorks fumble around the animated film genre for the
second time, one might wonder if Jeffrey Katzenberg was not perhaps
boasting a bit when he claimed to be the genius behind Disney's recent
success in the animated genre.  You might wonder in fact if Katzenberg
took anything at all from his experiences at Disney.  While Disney
continues to knock out quality animated fare in the tried and true
Disney tradition without Katzenberg (see 1999's TARZAN and TOY STORY 2),
DreamWorks continues to stumble in this arena.
 EL DORADO also follows in THE PRINCE OF EGYPT's footsteps bucking genre
conventions by lassoing a PG rating.  However, more risqué than PRINCE,
EL DORADO seems to claim its rating through a racy bit of sexual
innuendo between the roguish Spaniard Tulio (Kline) and the bad girl
native Chel (Perez).
 I wouldn't ordinarily paint myself as a fan of genre conventions or
brand names, but sitting down to see DreamWorks muck up the animated
film format, I found myself yearning for a Disney picture.  Does Disney
just have the magic touch, or have they patented and contracted into
infinity all of the elements of good animation?

Kenneth Branagh and Kevin Kline, as the voices of two sixteenth-century
conmen from Spain, are the comics around whom DreamWorks's animated
movie, THE ROAD TO EL DORADO, is built.  Upon the shoulders of these
wise-cracking characters, who are in just about every scene, rest the
success or failure of the movie.  Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio's script
for them, however, is several gold nuggets shy of a treasure.
Miguel (Branagh) and Tulio (Kline) find themselves adrift in the
Atlantic Ocean.  In a small rowboat with few provisions and with a
friendly horse that has the appetite of, well, a horse, Miguel and Tulio
have nothing to be thankful for, save their map to El Dorado, the
legendary city of gold.
Luckily, their boat strikes land near the entrance to El Dorado.  Once
inside the famous city, they are welcomed into a colorful kingdom that
looks like a new Disneyland attraction -- sorry, DreamWorks.  Besides
featuring lots of gold, it also has bickering native leaders -- a rotund
chief (Edward James Olmos) and a garishly made-up high priest named
Tzekel-Kan (Armand Assante).
Following the tradition of such encounters with natives, the story has
the Spanish swindlers being mistaken for gods by the locals.  ("It's an
entire city of suckers," proclaims a jubilant Tulio.)  A scantly-clad El
Dorado citizen named Chel (Rosie Perez) sees through the men from the
beginning and demands to join them in their scam, as they try to grab
the gold and get out of town.
For reasons which aren't clear, directors Bibo Bergeron and Will Finn
are never able to make effective use of their expensive voice talent.
Only Perez's spunky voice is recognizable.  The rest sound blandly
homogeneous like interchangeable radio newscasters.
The lively music for the picture features 6 original songs sung by Elton
John.  The movie's music and visuals easily surpass the story itself,
which only works in fits and spurts.  One good joke is followed by a
half-dozen ones that aren't.  The result is a movie that's kind of cute
but rarely anything more.
THE ROAD TO EL DORADO runs just 1:22.  The film is rated PG for mild
thematic material, brief male nudity and language and would be fine for
most kids of any age.
My son Jeffrey, age 10, gave the picture ***, but he complained that the
ending was too abrupt.  His buddies, Nickolas and Alan, both 10, gave
the picture *** 1/2.  All of the boys said that they thought the story
was really funny and that their favorite characters were the horse and
the monster.

For those out there that aren't long time readers, Cranky's a 'toonhead.
Loves animation. Almost wept when he had to sell a Gertie the Dinosaur
cel to support this site (didn't 'cuz I had two). In general, of the
post-Lion King run of animations from all the major studios, in general
I hate the second banana characters and really don't have much temper
for the multitude of songs that usually get in the way. Now that you're
up to speed . . .
What's a Cranky Critic to do when there are no second banana characters
-- to keep the kidlets giggling at the expense of grown up attentions --
to complain about? You know the type -- supporting monkeys or gargoyles
or whatever that usually infest toons from the other "D" studio but less
so from Dreamworks. You can blame or thank Jeffrey Katzenberg for this,
he did oversee The Lion King and many others at the Mouse, and is the
partner in charge of animation at Dreamworks SKG. The 'toons we've seen
from them in the last couple of years, Antz and The Prince of Egypt have
both aimed a wee bit higher, with more themes for the post thumb-sucking
set and less base comedy for the kidlets. Cranky likes that.
This year's offering, The Road To El Dorado, upgrades the second banana
type from support to lead and tries to duplicate the kind of chemistry
that made Hope & Crosby (or Lemmon & Matthau) a good screen team. El
Dorado tries and succeeds for the 'Works, delivering the most family
friendly of all their 'toon output. I know 'cuz I saw El Dorado twice.
Once with other critics, in preparation for StarTalk interviews with
lead voices Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh. Again, on the biggest
screen in New York, with an audience filled with media and their
kidlets. The kidlets were cackling at stuff that makes kidlets cackle
(don't ask me why) and the double entendre went right over their heads.
The big screen effect is discussed a couple of inches down.
Branagh and Kline voice Tulio and Miguel, two Spanish con artists who,
through every fault of their own, find themselves stowed away on the
conquistador Cortez' flagship on its journey to the New World. Cortez
(Jim Cummings) is searching for the legendary City of Gold called El
Dorado and has no tolerance for the stowaways (who just happen to have a
map to the city in their possession). The pair get washed overboard,
along with Cortez' stallion Altivo (who never speaks a word but is
"voiced" by the most expert and rightfully legendary Frank Welker) and
make it to the New World ahead of Cortez.
We're not telling how. It's funny. As is the pair's personal search for
El Dorado, which culminates in their finding it and being declared Gods
by the Chief Priest of the City, Tzekel-Kan (Armand Assante), who is
fighting a political battle with the Chief (Edward James Olmos) for
control of the tribe. Their Protector and Partner in Crime is the lovely
and equally greedy Chel (Rosie Perez) who tries to guide these
nincompoops in the how-to of breaking the bank, and winds up breaking
Tulio's heart. The interplay between Kline and Branagh's characters is
incredibly funny and dead on target (Kline's the Crosby, btw) and both
are topped by the vocal effects of Welker. To say the horse is smarter
than both men put together is a fine compliment, indeed. As for the
animation . . .
Let's talk honestly for a second. We all know the biggest market for all
feature toons is the post bigscreen video market. All of you with
kidlets know that for a fact -- how many times have you parked your
kidlets in front of [title here] or, for that matter, been parked by
your kidlets in front of [title here]? As I wrote, I saw The Road To El
Dorado twice. First, on a screen that was probably the size of the
bigger theaters in your local multiplex, which was enjoyable though some
of the CGI/traditional animation mix onscreen seemed obvious. Second
time was on a monstrosity of a screen with no such apparent "problem".
While there have been notable improvements in the technology of
background CGI character movement and water animation ('toonheads'll
catch it all), the climax of the film, in which a boat with sail
unfurled and filling with air evades a stone pillar crashing into the
water behind it -- absolutely breathtaking.
If you've got a theater nearby with a screen the size of the side of a
house, that's where you want to see The Road To El Dorado.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to The Road To El Dorado, he would have
paid...
Elton John and Tim Rice pick up their partnership where they left off on
The Lion King, though they've just done Aida for Broadway as well. The
songs in this flick are meant to narrate which they do better than
entertain, though the opening title and the Kline/Branagh sung "It's
Tough To Be A God" two (of five) are real toe-tappers. The radio hit
runs during the end credits, so it doesn't count. Sorry.

_The_Road_to_El_Dorado_ (PG) *** (out of ****)
_The_Road_to_El_Dorado_ is a reasonably entertaining animated feature,
which is more than enough to satisfy the family audience the film
courts--and, thus, enough for me to recommend it.  But a merely adequate
effort is somewhat disappointing coming from DreamWorks, the studio that
had so spectacularly redefined the barriers of feature animation with
their 1998 epic _The_Prince_of_Egypt_.  Instead of advancing the medium
even further, _El_Dorado_ finds the studio--and feature animation in
general--simply treading water.
El Dorado is the legendary lost city of gold hidden in South America,
where Spanish con men Tulio (voiced by Kevin Kline) and Miguel (Kenneth
Branagh) find themselves after escaping a ship piloted by the evil Cortes
(Jim Cummings).  The natives believe these strangers to be gods, and the
two play along in order to get their share of the riches.  Aiding in
their scheme is the saucy, sassy local  Chel (Rosie Perez), who keeps
their secret in exchange for a cut of all that's given them.
The premise is thin, and the set pieces that are hung upon it are
accordingly light.  Tulio and Miguel exchange good-natured barbs at each
other's expense; Chel incites some chaste looks of lust from the pair;
the duo get caught in slapsticky chases and sporting events.  These
elements are not without their simple charm, due in large part to some
sturdy art and animation and game vocal performances.  Perez's famously
squeaky voice, which often grates in her flesh-and-blood roles, is right
at home in a cartoon context.
But sometimes the light nature becomes "lite"--as in inconsequential and
forgettable.  The villainy--Cortes, a deceitful high priest named
Tzekel-Kan (Armand Assante)--never seems particularly threatening; the
big problem in the case of Cortes is that he doesn't have enough screen
time to establish himself as a major threat.  The songs by the
_Lion_King_ team of composer Elton John and Tim Rice, which are mostly
sung by John himself, are better suited to lite FM radio stations than an
animated feature.  The song score also suffers from the miscalculation I
call "_Tarzan_ Syndrome": if a film is going to use the tunes as an
underscore, it should not insert a big production number where the
characters sing.  Trying to have the best of both worlds--as Disney did
with _Tarzan_, shoehorning in a completely gratuitous Rosie O'Donnell
musical showcase--ends up shortchanging the film as a whole, especially
when the tunes are as unmemorable as they are here.
But those two complaints aren't so much annoyances as they are
distractions in a work that, while being completely pleasant to watch,
never really captivates.  As mentioned before, the animation and art are
fine, but there is nothing particularly distinctive about it.  After a
promising avant garde prologue that recounts El Dorado's legendary
origins, there is nothing in the way of fresh sights.  Tulio and Miguel's
number "It's Tough to Be a God" is meant to be the big animation
highlight, but anyone who's seen a Disney animated feature in the last
ten years won't find anything that one hasn't seen or done better before.
But maybe that was what directors Eric "Bibo" Bergeron and Don Paul were
hired to do: keep things familiar and, hence, comfortable for the
audience.  _The_Road_to_El_Dorado_ indeed fits that bill, a film as easy
to enjoy as it is to watch.  And while that's enough for me to give
_El_Dorado_ the seal of approval without hesitation, I cannot help but
feel that I would be more excited about the film had it been a bit more
of a challenge to like it.

In recent years the animation genre has greatly improved. Computers are leading
the way into a new dimension of thinking about animation. Witness the deep,
luscious jungles of Tarzan, or the amazing computer work in Toy Story 2. There
have also been animated films aimed at adults (like Antz, Princess Mononoke,
and South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut) that have seen success at the box
office. But for every Iron Giant, there must be a Pokemon: The First Movie.
While the images of The Road To El Dorado are beautiful, it's missing what an
animated kids movie needs most: A good story, humor, and memorable characters.
This movie is most likely to quickly fade away, just like the golden sun of the
city.
It's 16th century Spain, and Miguel (Branagh) and Tulio (Kline) are con men
trying to escape from Pamplona city guards. They stow away on a ship with the
mighty Cortez and are washed up on the island where El Dorado is. The two
journey through the forests and jungles until they reach the magical place. It
is marvelous indeed. Gold lines everything in sight, the two are in heaven. Due
to several natural occurrences and misunderstandings, the two men are mistaken
as gods and are worshipped by all of the people. They are hailed with gold and
riches, if they keep this up, who knows how much gold they could rack up? The
two decide to stay for several days,  rack up all the gold they can, and head
back to Spain. Soon sexy villager Chel (Perez) is also in on the con game. A
crazy priest (Assante) who believes that the gods deserve sacrifices also comes
into the picture, he's just one of the many badly motivated people in this
film, which is littered with potential bad guys. All of this builds up to a
predictable and inevitable conclusion.
The major rave I can give to the movie is the astounding animation. The hues
are vibrant and exciting, they really bring this movie to life. It's too bad
there wasn't a decent story to back this thing up. I found no real interest in
the two main characters, or their situation throughout the entire movie. Miguel
and Tulio have little chemistry or appeal and the most interesting character (a
horse with human emotions and no lines) kept catching my interest rather than
the human characters. Character and plot structure are so lackluster that, if
not for the bright colors, I could have easily fallen asleep amid the boring
middle of the film. I think the real clincher for me on this movie would be the
songs. They are so out of place and so easily forgettable that while trying to
recollect a single lyric from any one of them after the movie, I came up with
nothing. This is really a disappointment, considering the songs were written by
Tim Rice and Elton John who did marvelous work on The Lion King. The theme may
also worry some parents, the two leads lie, cheat, and steal...and usually get
away with it.
My only theory as to the creation of this film was that Jeffrey Katzenberg is
trying to prove to Disney that Dreamworks has just the same amount of
technology behind their animation studios as the mouse ears do. But Disney
films (and others like The Iron Giant) know that in order for a family animated
movie to be good, it must capture the imaginations of children and maybe even
some of the adults who accompany them. There is little sign of this here, the
visuals are there, but the inspiration, and sense of wonder are lacking. The
Road is rocky and unpaved, and certainly not filled with gold.

         Perhaps it's written in stone somewhere in Hollywood that every
animated film has to include songs, whether they suit the story or not.
 But "The Road to El Dorado" is a shining example of a film that
would have been much stronger if it didn't have to pause every 15
minutes for a musical number. The score in this case was penned by Elton
John and Tim Rice, but the old "Lion King" lightning has not struck a
second time: These ditties are ho-hum instead of hummable and several of
them, particularly the ballads, bring the action to a near-total
standstill.
 That's a shame, since "El Dorado" is an otherwise enjoyable
adventure, with a delightful beginning and an exciting finale making up
for a somewhat muddled middle. In many ways the plot is reminiscent of
Rudyard Kipling's tale "The Man Who Would Be King," which was
beautifully filmed in 1975 with Sean Connery and Michael Caine. Like the
Kipling yarn, "El Dorado" introduces us to a pair of fortune-seekers,
Miguel (voice of Kenneth Branagh) and Tulio (voice of Kevin Kline), who
find more riches -- not to mention more headaches -- than they ever
dreamed of when they stumble upon a secret civilization.
 Escaping a shady past in Spain, the two accidentally become
castaways and travel to South America, where a mysterious map leads them
into El Dorado, the legendary lost city of gold. Their arrival time
couldn't have been better: It seems the citizens were awaiting the
appearance of a couple of gods who would help usher in "the time of the
jaguar," and Miguel and Tulio cheerfully take advantage of the natives'
hospitality.
 The first portion of "El Dorado" is by far the funniest section
of the film, featuring a highly amusing episode at sea, some bouncy
banter between our heroes and the intoduction of a saucy, sinuous thief
named Chel (voice of Rosie Perez) who provides a bit of romantic
interest. El Dorado itself is introduced in a glorious sequence that
allows the animators to pull out all the stops.
 Once Tulio and Miguel have settled in, the movie settles down
-- perhaps a bit too much, as John and Rice haul out their maudlin
melodies. It's only when Tzekel-Kan (voice of Armand Assante), the
blood-crazed high priest, starts to get suspicious of the visitors that
the picture begins to regain its momentum. Certainly there's nothing
like the unveiling of a spectacular monster and the arrival of a tidal
wave to get kids back in their seats.
 "El Dorado" comes from Dreamworks, which previously produced
the scintillating 1998 feature "Prince of Egypt." Despite some
eye-popping effects and luscious colors, this one isn't in the same
class, although parents and older siblings who have to accompany little
ones to the theater will probably find this much easier to take than
"Pokemon" or "Snow Day." "The Road to El Dorado" has its potholes, but
it's definitely a scenic route. James Sanford

Susan Granger's review of "ROAD TO EL DORADO" (DreamWorks)
 Like the classic Bob Hope-Bing Crosby road movies, this
family comedy chronicles the misadventures of two bumbling, somewhat
inept con-artists whose enthusiastic camaraderie is as much fun as the
excitement they encounter. The story begins in 1519 in Spain, where
Tulio (Kevin Kline) and Miguel (Kenneth Branagh) win a map to El
Dorado, the legendary City of Gold, and inadvertently become stowaways
on the ship of the Spanish explorer Cortes. With the help of Ativo, a
clever war horse, they escape and stumble into idyllic El Dorado,
where they're proclaimed as gods. Only a smart, sexy schemer named
Chel (Rosie Perez) sees through their ruse. "I want in on the scam so
I can get out," she declares - and they agree. But, as the evil High
Priest (Armand Assante) plots to grab power from the Chief (Edward
James Olmos), Cortes and his army are marching on the city. That's
when Tulio and Miguel have their ingenuity and friendship truly
tested.  Road to El Dorado is the first major studio animated feature
of the new millennium - following the trail of Antz and Prince of
Egypt. The joke-filled script is character-driven with Tulio as the
cynical realist and Miguel as the romantic idealist; and the lush
visuals - combining traditional and computer techniques - are
exquisite, drawing extensively from the Mayan culture of the
Yucatan. The music is catchy and the lyrics clever in the six original
songs written by Tim Rice and Elton John, who does the vocals - except
when Kline and Branagh croon the witty, comedic "It's Tough to be a
God." And there's definitely a PG-rated moment when the bantering
rogues skinny-dip in the hot-springs. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1
to 10, Road to El Dorado is a fast-paced, raucous 8 - great fun for
spirited adventurers of all ages.

PLOT:
A map leading to the city of gold is what ignites two con men buddies in
their quest to find El Dorado. Once discovered, the duo are thought to be
Gods by the locals, and must keep up the ruse until they figure out a way to
get the gold, and themselves, back to Spain.
CRITIQUE:
I enjoyed it. I didn't go nuts over it...I didn't hate it...in fact, I don't
particularly remember any grand sequences from it...but all in all, I
enjoyed it while I was there, and I suppose that's the most important thing.
The two leads were actually very amusing, with much of their repartee
striking my own fancy on more than one occasion. The rest of the cast,
including Rosie Perez as the very shapely Chel, were also pretty good, but
no standouts a la Mushu from MULAN (7.5/10) or the Genie from ALADDIN. Of
course, the best animation films always feature the greatest "bad guys" and
despite this one teasing us with one very mean-looking son-of-em-bitch early
on in the flick, the main baddie ultimately oozed very little threat, so on
that front the film could be faulted slightly. Action-wise, the movie
generated a couple of cool puffball sequences early on, one big ass blowout
scene during its last few minutes, and generally managed to keep me
entertained throughout.
Were the songs any good, you ask? Well, personally I have never been a huge
fan of films which rely solely on their songs to do the talking for them,
but thankfully for this film, that wasn't the case. Sure there were a couple
of musical montages here and there, all to be expected, but all in all,
nothing over-the-top or crappy either. I do think that Elton John/Phil
Collins should put a cork in their animation song-writing schedules from now
on, since their voices generally propel my attention away from these films,
but then again, maybe that's just me! If you're gonna put songs in a film,
how 'bout having the characters and their voices sing 'em and forget these
over-the-hill Englishmen (no offense, gentlemen :). I did really love the
whole look of this movie with its magnificent array of color strokes lining
every frame just right, the city of gold exuding its powerful odors of
paradise and the characters all emitting a strong sense of personality.
Overall, I would suggest this film to all kids and certainly to most adults
who like these kinds of movies. Mind you...it's no FIGHT CLUB! :)

For several years Disney enjoyed a virtual monopoly on the lucrative market 
for animated features.  A monopoly breeds monotony, and Disney's annual 
offerings soon slipped into a predictable "ugly duckling" formula (a misfit 
having an identity crisis has an adventure and discovers how special he/she 
is).  Gradually, though, competition emerged:  Fox entered the fray with 
"Anastasia" (1997), and Dreamworks pulled off the unlikely combination of 
Woody Allen and family animation in "Antz" (1998).  "Antz" was followed by 
"The Prince of Egypt", Dreamworks' first foray into traditional animation.  
"Prince" stuck close to the Disney formula but showed a lot of guts in its 
choice of a religious subject and in its refusal to sugarcoat the unpleasant 
elements of the story of Moses.  (After the way Disney sanitized the myth of 
Hercules, I doubt the House of Mouse would have shown God's destruction of 
the first-born children of Egypt.)  Now Dreamworks gives us "The Road to El 
Dorado," which is a pleasant antidote to Disneyfication.
Inspired by the "Road" movies of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby, "El Dorado" is the 
story of two Spanish con men, Tulio (Kevin Kline) and Miguel (Kenneth 
Branagh) who win a map to the legendary city of gold, El Dorado, in the 
Yucatan.  When the losers discover that our heroes were playing with loaded 
dice, Tulio and Miguel beat a hasty exit and unintentionally stow away on the 
ship of explorer Hernando Cortes (Jim Cummings).  Cortes threatens them with 
a life of slavery, but the guys manage another escape with the aid of Altivo, 
a war horse who's smarter than both of them.  Wouldn't you know it, they wash 
up on the shores of the New World right at a spot on the map.  With the help 
of Chel (Rosie Perez), a young thief who's not too keen on life in the city 
of gold, Tulio and Miguel enter El Dorado and, much to their surprise, are 
treated as gods by the high priest Tzekel-Kan (Armand Assante) because their 
arrival fulfills an ancient prophecy about how the Age of the Jaguar will 
begin.  There's a power struggle going on between the evil Tzekel-Kan and the 
benevolent Chief Tannabok (Edward James Olmos), and both badly want to earn 
the favor of the "gods."  The boys have to keep up the ruse as long as they 
can if they want to get away with all the golden tribute they collect.  All 
the time, of course, Cortes is on his way . . . 
If you overlook the coincidences in the plot (our heroes just happen to land 
at a spot on the map, the natives just happen to be speaking the same 
language they do), "The Road to El Dorado" is lots of fun.  Kline and Branagh 
bring rare enthusiasm to their vocal roles, and the friendship between Tulio 
the realist and Miguel the dreamer is touching without the overbearing 
sentiment of Disney.  It's also refreshing to see such rascals as these in an 
animated film.  Altogether, it's a breezier "Butch and Sundance."
The music for "El Dorado" reunites the Oscar-winning musical team from "The 
Lion King": songwriters Elton John and Tim Rice, and composer Hans Zimmer, 
with marvelous results.  When I saw "Tarzan" recently, I grew to hate Phil 
Collins, but when I left "El Dorado" I wanted to run out and buy the 
soundtrack.

Rich rain forest green, as brilliant as those iridescent plankton at the
bottom of the ocean. And deep blue like the ocean too, pure crystal like
Linda Carter's eyes. Contrasted and balanced by crimson shadows cracking the
digital landscapes like a rainy day dawn casting blood-red beams across the
bottoms of surly purple storm clouds.
This may just be the first animated feature that's worth seeing for the
landscape scenery alone: a breath-taking crying waterfall, a flock of pink
and red butterfly flowers fluttering from the jowls of a grizzly cave. But
that doesn't mean there isn't a fun story. There is. Miguel and Tulio, best
buddies in light-hearted con set off for the riches of El Dorado - the city
of Gold! But greed, the mighty Cortes and his army, godly admiration of the
masses, and of course, a woman, challenge their friendship and purpose.
Most of the chatter between Miguel and Tulio (Kevin Kline and Kenneth
Branagh) is clever and charming (on an adult level), although the picture
relies upon it just a little too long leaving a lull or two for us to endure
between action sequences. At the same time, Cortes' mighty army, along with
Rosie Perez as the Eldoradan love interest are underused, leaving the
picture less 3-dimensional than it could have been. In fact, Rosie's sparse
dialogue would barely rival this paragraph in length. Having Rosie in a film
and not giving her a fiery speech of at least 30 seconds in length would be
like forcing Jennifer Lopez to wear a bra.
But I still liked this film! The action scenes charge and roll like bulls
through the streets of Pamplona. Kline and Branagh are more often charming
than not while the paint and pixels DreamWorks set swirling on the screen
effectively whirl excitement both aesthetically and physically inside their
viewers. The film's vivid wonder and wholesome story are sure to leave an
impression.
Despite its title, this isn't a "road" picture, but I suppose "Waterways to
El Dorado" didn't quite chime. Enjoy.

Dreamworks' latest foray into animation is the result of an interesting
idea.  Jeffrey Katzenberg and company decided to take the best aspect of
recently successful animated films  the wisecracking sidekick  and
build a film around this scene-stealing cut-up.  And just to drive the
hilarity home, the writers used two of these class clowns as the main
characters in The Road to El Dorado.  I can picture well-dressed
executives greedily rubbing their hands together while visualizing
coffers full of doubloons at the mere thought of a film with two hammy
leads.  Think of how great a movie would be with Eddie Murphy's Mushu
(from Mulan) and Danny DeVito's Philoctetes (from Hercules) as the two
main characters.
Okay, El Dorado isn't that great.  The two leads (Kevin Kline and
Kenneth Branagh) are funny, but not over-the-top enough to ruin the
film.  The slick animation is on par with Dreamworks' last traditionally
animated film, The Prince of Egypt, but the story is much more formulaic
than its predecessor.  And to top things off, the sidekick in El Dorado
still steals the show.
El Dorado begins in 1519 Spain, where soon-to-be-legendary explorer
Cortes (Jim Cummings, the voice of Tigger and Winnie the Pooh in The
Tigger Movie) is about to set sail for the New World, which he intends
to conquer for Spain.  In addition, Cortes plans to find and plunder El
Dorado, the legendary City of Gold.  He's a big meanie and points out
that his crew was selected more carefully `than Christ's apostles.'
Imagine that job interview.
Meanwhile, two lightweight hoodwinks - Miguel and Tulio (Kenneth Branagh
and Kevin Kline from Wild Wild West) - shoot craps with loaded dice in a
crowded Spanish alley.  Like Jack Dawson in Titanic, they win an unusual
pot that includes a map to the City of Gold.  Before long their
deception is discovered and, during their escape, the two men
accidentally end up on Cortes' ship.  Before they can escape, the ship
is already well into its voyage across the Atlantic.  With the help of
Altivo, Cortes' faithful horse, Miguel and Tulio manage to procure a
rowboat and steal away in the darkness of night.  With the horse.
After rowing around in circles for days, the trio finally reaches terra
firma.  Of course, the particular spot they land on is the precise
location that corresponds to the start point on the map to the City of
Gold.  So Miguel, Tulio and Altivo make their way through the jungle and
mountains and eventually find the city, which is run by the typical
friendly fat guy (Edward James Olmos, Selena) whose second-in-command is
the typical evil skinny guy that wants to be in charge (Armand Assante,
The Odyssey).
Thanks to an ancient legend and a healthy dose of dumb luck, the people
of El Dorado mistake Miguel and Tulio for gods.  The men want to stay
just long enough to pilfer all the gold they can carry from the trusting
inhabitants, and are able to fit in with the help of a local con woman
that looks like a porn star (Rosie Perez, It Could Happen To You).  Even
though they have to hit the road before Cortes and his men find the
city, Miguel and Tulio have a hard time leaving their new luxurious
lifestyle.
If El Dorado seems more Disney-ish to you than Egypt did, it's because
most of the filmmakers here were pilfered from the Mouse House.  The
film's three directors (Robert `Bibo' Bergeron, Will Finn and Don Paul)
worked on A Goofy Movie, The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Pocahontas,
respectively.  The music in El Dorado comes from the writing team
responsible for The Lion King, and features five new songs performed by
Sir Elton John.  There's also one of those Disney animating secrets that
animates - I swear to God - a bull with a nutsack the size of Rhode
Island.  If you don't see it, wait for the DVD.
The voice work is fine all around.  Kline and Branagh sound like they
had a great time working on this project, and Perez's voice isn't the
screeching nasal nightmare you're used to hearing.  She's much more
restrained and, as a result, her voice is quiet and  gulp  almost
soothing.
Now there's something I never thought I would say.

     In the last decade or so, animated feature film-making has not just
risen from the dead, it has become the most consistently reliable
Hollywood genre for creative entertainment. Compare the unqualified
artistic successes (BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, TOY STORY, TOY STORY 2, A
BUG'S LIFE, THE IRON GIANT) and solid entertainments (ANTZ, ALADDIN, THE
PRINCE OF EGYPT) with the out-and-out duds (QUEST FOR CAMELOT, THE KING
AND I ... pretty much everything from Warner Bros. _except_ THE IRON
GIANT, actually), and you'll find a batting average any studio would kill
for. The "Disney model" has led to films from several studios in which
strong scripts and genuine creative energy generate -- pardon the cliche
-- fun for the whole family.
     It's easy to visualize a live-action version of THE ROAD TO EL DORADO
as a colossal failure, clumsily mixing whimsy with huge production values. 
The animated version, however, manages a multitude of charms. The story
begins in Spain circa 1519, where Cortez is about to begin his exploration
(and plundering) of the Americas. Enter Tulio (Kevin Kline) and Miguel
(Kenneth Branagh) a pair of happy-go-lucky con artists looking for a quick
escape after winning a map in a rigged dice game. They become inadvertent
stowaways on Cortez's ship, eventually going overboard to make their own
way to the American shore. Soon they discover that the map actually does
lead to the legendary "City of Gold" El Dorado, where Tulio and Miguel are
received as gods come to earth. They also find themselves in the middle of
a power struggle between the High Priest Tzekel-Kan (Armand Assante) and
the amiable Chief (Edward James Olmos), and divided by the opportunistic
native girl Chel (Rosie Perez).
     In any number of ways, THE ROAD TO EL DORADO does feel like a
too-obvious attempt to mimic Disney's 1990s animated output. Like THE LION
KING, the film combines a Hans Zimmer score with songs by Elton John and
lyricist Tim Rice, among them the catchy (if not instantly hummable) "The
Trail We Blaze" and "It's Tough to Be a God." It also brings on board the
writing team of Terry Rossio and Ted Elliott, who contributed to the
script for ALADDIN. There's even a Disney voice veteran in Kevin Kline,
who previously worked on THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME. The basic story
progression is familiar, and the obligatory musical numbers are feeling a
bit more obligatory all the time. It's pretty fair to say that THE ROAD TO
EL DORADO doesn't do anything radically different than the dozen or so
Disney animated features that have preceded it.
     Then again, why mess with success? The makers of THE ROAD TO EL
DORADO seem to understand that telling a good story with wit and
excitement will be enough to satisfy virtually anyone. They begin with a
pair of roguishly likeable protagonists -- well-performed by Kline and
Branagh and splendidly animated -- who carry the story effectively. 
Directors Bibo Bergeron and Will Finn lead them through a series of wild,
high-spirited action sequences, unobtrusively combining computer-generated
details and traditional cel animation. And the script and the character
animation provide more hearty laughs than a dozen recent live-action
comedies. Sure, there's a formula to THE ROAD TO EL DORADO, but it rarely
seems like those involved are content to let their film feel formulaic. 
Within the constraints of their genre, everyone is working to keep the
film lively and appealing.
     THE ROAD TO EL DORADO certainly isn't the most inspired animated film
to come down the pike. The third act in particular begins to drag, relying
too much on a rift between Tulio and Miguel. The character development is
a bit sketchy, the villainous Tzekel-Kan doesn't get enough time to show
his villainy and even a toned-down Rosie Perez is still Rosie Perez. It's
not a dazzling visual spectacle, and it's not going to move anyone to 
tears.  It is, however, the kind of sturdy, generally smart film
craftsmanship that shows up far more often when a world is drawn than when
it's photographed. Maybe it's the unique creative perspective of 
animators; maybe it's the freedom inherent in creating a world from
scratch. Or maybe it's just one of those Golden Ages we here so much about
but experience so rarely. THE ROAD TO EL DORADO may not be solid gold, but
it continues an impressive string of animated features worth spending your
silver on.

For those out there that aren't long time readers, Cranky's a 'toonhead.
Loves animation. Almost wept when he had to sell a Gertie the Dinosaur
cel to support this site (didn't 'cuz I had two). In general, of the
post-Lion King run of animations from all the major studios, in general
I hate the second banana characters and really don't have much temper
for the multitude of songs that usually get in the way. Now that you're
up to speed . . .
What's a Cranky Critic to do when there are no second banana characters
-- to keep the kidlets giggling at the expense of grown up attentions --
to complain about? You know the type -- supporting monkeys or gargoyles
or whatever that usually infest toons from the other "D" studio but less
so from Dreamworks. You can blame or thank Jeffrey Katzenberg for this,
he did oversee The Lion King and many others at the Mouse, and is the
partner in charge of animation at Dreamworks SKG. The 'toons we've seen
from them in the last couple of years, Antz and The Prince of Egypt have
both aimed a wee bit higher, with more themes for the post thumb-sucking
set and less base comedy for the kidlets. Cranky likes that.
This year's offering, The Road To El Dorado, upgrades the second banana
type from support to lead and tries to duplicate the kind of chemistry
that made Hope & Crosby (or Lemmon & Matthau) a good screen team. El
Dorado tries and succeeds for the 'Works, delivering the most family
friendly of all their 'toon output. I know 'cuz I saw El Dorado twice.
Once with other critics, in preparation for StarTalk interviews with
lead voices Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh. Again, on the biggest
screen in New York, with an audience filled with media and their
kidlets. The kidlets were cackling at stuff that makes kidlets cackle
(don't ask me why) and the double entendre went right over their heads.
The big screen effect is discussed a couple of inches down.
Branagh and Kline voice Tulio and Miguel, two Spanish con artists who,
through every fault of their own, find themselves stowed away on the
conquistador Cortez' flagship on its journey to the New World. Cortez
(Jim Cummings) is searching for the legendary City of Gold called El
Dorado and has no tolerance for the stowaways (who just happen to have a
map to the city in their possession). The pair get washed overboard,
along with Cortez' stallion Altivo (who never speaks a word but is
"voiced" by the most expert and rightfully legendary Frank Welker) and
make it to the New World ahead of Cortez.
We're not telling how. It's funny. As is the pair's personal search for
El Dorado, which culminates in their finding it and being declared Gods
by the Chief Priest of the City, Tzekel-Kan (Armand Assante), who is
fighting a political battle with the Chief (Edward James Olmos) for
control of the tribe. Their Protector and Partner in Crime is the lovely
and equally greedy Chel (Rosie Perez) who tries to guide these
nincompoops in the how-to of breaking the bank, and winds up breaking
Tulio's heart. The interplay between Kline and Branagh's characters is
incredibly funny and dead on target (Kline's the Crosby, btw) and both
are topped by the vocal effects of Welker. To say the horse is smarter
than both men put together is a fine compliment, indeed. As for the
animation . . .
Let's talk honestly for a second. We all know the biggest market for all
feature toons is the post bigscreen video market. All of you with
kidlets know that for a fact -- how many times have you parked your
kidlets in front of [title here] or, for that matter, been parked by
your kidlets in front of [title here]? As I wrote, I saw The Road To El
Dorado twice. First, on a screen that was probably the size of the
bigger theaters in your local multiplex, which was enjoyable though some
of the CGI/traditional animation mix onscreen seemed obvious. Second
time was on a monstrosity of a screen with no such apparent "problem".
While there have been notable improvements in the technology of
background CGI character movement and water animation ('toonheads'll
catch it all), the climax of the film, in which a boat with sail
unfurled and filling with air evades a stone pillar crashing into the
water behind it -- absolutely breathtaking.
If you've got a theater nearby with a screen the size of the side of a
house, that's where you want to see The Road To El Dorado.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to The Road To El Dorado, he would have
paid...
Elton John and Tim Rice pick up their partnership where they left off on
The Lion King, though they've just done Aida for Broadway as well. The
songs in this flick are meant to narrate which they do better than
entertain, though the opening title and the Kline/Branagh sung "It's
Tough To Be A God" two (of five) are real toe-tappers. The radio hit
runs during the end credits, so it doesn't count. Sorry.

Directed by Bobo Bergeron, Will Finn and Don Paul. Screenplay by Ted
Elliott and Terry Rossio. Starring Kenneth Branagh, Kevin Kline, Rosie
Perez. Running time: 91 minutes. Rated PG for frightening scenes (MFCB).
Reviewed on April 13th, 2000.
"The Road To El Dorado" is perhaps one of the most inappropriately-titled
movies of the year. That's because DreamWorks' latest attempt to challenge
Disney's animation stranglehold isn't about the quest for the fabled City
of Gold so much as it is about what happens after the quest has succeeded.
This is a movie not about adventure, but rather about friendship and
sacrifice in the face of temptation.
Miguel (Kenneth Branagh) and Tulio (Kevin Kline) are con artists in
sixteenth century Spain. After acquiring a map to the legendary El Dorado
-- a City of Gold built by the gods themselves -- they inadvertently stow
away on board the ship carrying none other than the infamous conqueror
Cortes across the sea to South America. Escaping the boat with the help of
the faithful horse Altivo, Miguel and Tulio eventually run aground
somewhere in the New World. Following the map, they soon discover El 
Dorado itself, where they are hailed as gods.
Although the journey to El Dorado could easily have been the focus of the
movie, here it is essentially just forms the preliminaries. The movie
really gets going once Miguel and Tulio have reached the City of Gold,
whose citizens are divided in their loyalties between the jolly Chief
(Edward James Olmos) and the sinister High Priest Tzekel-Kan (Armand
Assante). The Chief is suspicious of Miguel and Tulio's divinity from the
start, but sees them as a harmless way to keep his people happy.
Tzekel-Kan, on the other hand, believes the arrival of the "gods" signals
the start of the Age of the Jaguar, a time of blood and human sacrifice
when he will rule the people through fear. And meanwhile, Cortes himself
has arrived in the New World, and has begun to follow Miguel and Tulio's
trail toward unsuspecting El Dorado.
"The Road To El Dorado" is certainly not the most ambitious animated film
of recent times. Storywise, it borrows from a number of other sources --
the "quest for the City of Gold", the "white men hailed as gods", and the
"evil high priest seeks power" subplots are all tried-and-true staples of
the genre. There is not much new here: even Tulio and Miguel's trick of
pretending to argue with one another in order to get themselves out of
trouble is a classic ploy. But it's all done with a healthy dose of humor,
and the pacing is such that the movie never really drags. If nothing else,
the relationship between Tulio and Miguel is well-developed. Although
there's never really any doubt how things are going to turn out, the
evolution of that relationship in the presence of temptations like gold,
godhood and girls (in the form Chela, an El Dorado native who becomes the
pair's partner in crime) is interesting to watch.
The real attraction of "The Road To El Dorado", of course, is its gorgeous
animation. Much of the film is illustrated in the half-realistic,
half-cartoonish style currently favored by Disney, but the movie is not
bound by this technique. For example, some portions (the creation of El
Dorado by the gods and an energetic feast segment) are drawn in the style
of Seventies-era cartoons, employing two-dimensional shapes, unusual color
choices and psychedelic imagery. There is also some gorgeous computer
animation, particularly during sequences set on water.
The voicework in general is capable but not spectacular, with the
best performances given by Kline and Rosie Perez, who plays Chela. Perez
in particular is important because she provides a much-needed female
perspective in the otherwise male-dominated picture. The music by Elton
John is largely forgettable, with the most interesting track being one of
the two end-credit songs, "Someday Out Of The Blue" (also the first single
airing on the radio). But it's a song that doesn't really have much at all
to do with the movie itself, and the rest of the tunes lack the punch of,
say, "Be Our Guest" or virtually anything from "Aladdin".
Although not a spectacular entry into the field of family films, "The Road
To El Dorado" is a movie which both children and their parents should find
enjoyable. It's got humor which appeals to both age groups, and although
the story is timeworn and simplistic, it's told with enough energy to keep
the audience interested for an hour and a half. Dreamworks might not be
challenging Disney with this release, but it's not doing too bad a job in
its own right.

As I walked out of "The Road to El Dorado", something was nagging at me, and
it took me awhile to determine what that was. The movie starts off by being
cute, with all the requisite cutesy little characters present that the kids
should ooh and ahh over; and throughout the middle of the movie it remains
cute, tacking on yet more adorable little characters. Finally, after sitting
through an hour and a half of this, it ends in a very predictable (and cute,
of course) way. In fact, that's all this movie ever was. It was never
interesting, exciting, or awe inspiring in the slightest. This was just one
of those mindless pieces of fluff that studios throw out for the kidlets
every year. I know I should go easy on "The Road to El Dorado" simply
because it's a film aimed at kids, but all the little kids in the theater
looked bored out of their minds as well.
Tulio (Kevin Kline) and Miguel (Kenneth Branagh) are two con artists on the
run from the authorities and a mob of angry people in Spain. In their haste
to escape, the two find themselves on board Cortes's ship as he heads for
the new world. Cortes discovers them, and he sends them off in a long boat
with only a horse and a map for company. After washing up on the shore of
South America, they find their way to the golden city of El Dorodo. The
friendly residents, led by their jovial (though nameless) chief (Edward
James Olmos) and an evil priest named Tzekel-Kan (Armand Assante), assume
that the visitors are gods and treat them as such. Only a young thief, named
Chel (Rosie Perez), sees through their con and wants in on the action. The
problem is, Cortes is hot on their heels, Tzekel-Kan wants to commit human
sacrifice in their names, and they have to keep up the charade for three
whole days.
Does that plot sound a little tired and recycled? It certainly felt that way
as I sat, bored out of my mind, waiting for this unbearably cutesy movie to
end. I honestly believe that it was possible to predict what each character
was going to say, long before they said it. I was rather amused by the fact
that this dull movie is so frantically paced. It's as though Bergeron and
Finn knew how boring their material was, and so they tried to bring the
experience to an end as soon as possible. In order to break up the trite and
dull sequences throughout this movie, we are occasionally granted musical
numbers, which seem to go on forever and ever, but do not contribute to the
story in any way. They are also shot in a bizarre, psychedelic manner,
making them appear to be straight out of something from the '60s.
I believe the two primary reasons people are going to see this movie is for
the animation and for Kenneth Branagh and Kevin Kline. I will say that the
animation used in "The Road to El Dorado" is quite nice, but it's certainly
nothing spectacular. I'd put the animation a notch or two below 1998's "The
Prince of Egypt". The fact that I had just seen a preview for the upcoming
and fantastic looking "Titan A.E." before hand, probably didn't help
matters. As for the star duo involved, I'm sorry to say that they aren't
given much to do in this movie. Anyone could have performed these exact same
roles, and no one would have known the difference. Part of the problem is
that the two sound utterly joyless in their roles, and who can blame them?
Their jokes are few and far between, and the majority of them fall flat.
"The Road to El Dorado" isn't without its high points. The animation is
quite lovely, and there are several truly hilarious scenes. One of the
supporting characters, a little armadillo which follows the heroes by
rolling around and squeaking seemed to delight the kids in the audience, and
even I found him rather amusing. Like I said, this is a clean, wholesome,
safe movie, which I might have expected a bit too much from. It runs only 82
minutes, but it feels much longer. I would recommend it to animation fans
since it is so nice looking, but not really to anyone else. I would
especially warn off history buffs, since the film takes more than a few
liberties with the realities of Cortes's conquests. I give it two and a half
out of five stars.

 Featuring the voice talents of Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh, Armand
Assante, Rosie Perez, Edward James Olmos, Frank Welker. Directed by
Bibo Bergeron and Will Finn. Rated PG.
I'll get straight to the question that was on many people's minds
regarding The Road to El Dorado: is Dreamworks' attempt at traditional
animation on par with the movies the Mouse House is releasing annually?
Well, for what it's worth, I liked it a little bit better than Tarzan.
It's certainly nowhere near as satisfying as some of Disney's previous
efforts. Still, this amiable little cartoon is an enjoyable diversion
even if it isn't (and it isn't) the animated masterpiece that
Dreamworks' CGI Antz was.
Essentially a cartoon version of Ridyard Kipling's "The Man Who Would
Be King," which was itself made into a movie starring Sean Connery in
1975, The Road to Eldorado tracks the adventures of Miguel (Kenneth
Branagh) and Tulio (Kevin Kline), two resourceful crooks looking for
adventure. They spend their days scamming passers-by out of their money
by playing craps with loaded dice and each feigning innocence when
discovered. In one of these craps games, they win a treasure map. With
nothing to lose and apparently a lot to gain, they stowaway on a boat
heading in the general direction of the destination indicated on the
map. Unfortunately, the ship happens to belong to one of Spain's most
militant explorers who finds the two crooks and throws them in the
dungeon.
With the help of one very groovy horse, Miguel and Tulio escape and
wind up in the New World -- exactly where they were heading in the
first place. Following the map, they discover El Dorado, a.k.a. the
City of Gold, whose residents along with the benevolent chief (Edward
James Olmos) and the malevolent High Priest (Armand Assante) are
convinced that Miguel and Tulio are gods. The con men play that for all
it's worth, of course, hoping to sail away in a brand new boat and with
a hefty load of gold to boot. But they can't do it without the
involvement of a scheming young woman (Rosie Perez) who discovers
Miguel and Tulio's plan and blackmails them to let her in on it.
The Road to El Dorado is thoroughly watchable and thoroughly harmless.
Much like Tarzan, the songs here are mostly kept in the background
(with one noticeable exception), keeping the film from being a full-
fledged musical. This is probably a wise choice: perhaps the biggest
criticism of the last few Disney 'toons was of the showtunes that
relentlessly permeated the action. When done well, they can get stuck
in your head (like every song in The Lion King) but when the
songwriters whiff it, they are at best forgettable and at worst
irritating. El Dorado sort of skirts the issue by making the songs
background music.
Kevin Kline is a wonderful voice talent with unbeatable deadpan
delivery. As Tulio, he more than makes up for the fact that Branagh as
Miguel is more than a little dull. Branagh simply fails to do anything
distinctive with his character. Kids need specific little quirks or
catchphrases to remember characters by and the movie, along with the
actor, fails to provide them for one of its protagonists.
Other than that, the film is well-intentioned and it mostly succeeds.
The adventures are fun, Rosie Perez is funny, the villain is
sufficiently menacing to make the young 'uns hate him and cheesy enough
to make adults chuckle. My one question: why did Dreamworks insert
skinny-dipping scenes and profanity to make the film PG instead of G?
It doesn't make any sense and if anything, it probably hurt the movie's
box-office.
The Road to El Dorado is hardly the Road Less Traveled, but it's decent
while it lasts. Not everything has to be for the ages.

The latest fully animated offering from DreamWorks SKG is out just in time 
for spring breaks and spring fever.  THE ROAD TO EL DORADO is beautifully 
drawn, skillfully voiced, and nicely scored.  It is also threadbare of plot, 
save for the final minutes.
The heroes of the film, Tulio (Kevin Kline) and Miguel (Kenneth Branagh) are 
con men who mistakenly stow away on the ship of the very men they have 
swindled.  Their punishment upon being caught?  Well, it is supposed to be 
flogging and lifetime enslavement in the sugar plantations of Cuba (where 
they are headed aboard the ship belonging to none other than the infamous 
Cortez.  But we never see the pair suffer, just as we never witness scenes 
anywhere close to graphic).  So the heroes escape with a sidekick in the 
form of a portly horse named Altivo, and use a map in an attempt to discover 
the legendary city that gives the story its name.
Enter a supporting character, Chel.  She's a temple robber, a lovely though 
sneaky woman who begins to drive a wedge between Miguel and Tulio.  When the 
trio are captured and dragged  into the wondrous city, they commence to 
scheme their way into an escape with all the gold they can carry - a very 
familiar premise.  What complicates their machinations is another case of 
mistaken identity:  the ignorant natives take the white men to be gods, 
resembling an ancient image of a magical pair riding a serpent.  As the 
connivers battle their own greed as well as factions led by rival power 
figures within the tribe, the specter of Cortez stands in the background.
What helps to make the film move along is the characterization provided by 
the voice actors.  By this time Kevin Kline is a veteran animated movie 
star, the male lead of Disney's THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME under his belt.  
Kline lends a quirky panache to Tulio, causing us to like the money-grubbing 
would-be god.  Kenneth Branagh also turns in a solid performance as Miguel, 
even though his voice occasionally takes on the stock heroic tone we heard 
from him in HENRY V.  Both actors supply their own singing voices in the 
only song not sung by Elton John.
Rosie Perez's character is sketched to resemble her, and unfortunately we 
also see a lot of Rosie's head wiggling attitude transplanted to this 
paradise in Central America.  Enough said.  The other voice actors are more 
transparent.  Edward James Olmos plays the obese chief, his voice often 
understated and subtly wise.  As the wily Tzekel-Kan, Armand Assante does 
perhaps the strongest job of the supporting players.  His intonation is 
striking and clear, the hallmarks of all good "baddies."
How is Elton John's singing?  Not as good as Tim Rice's lyrics.  The songs 
do an adequate job of both furthering and decorating the storyline, though I 
would not go out of my way to purchase the soundtrack.  Often catchy and 
multi-layered, the music nevertheless falls short of being memorable.  After 
leaving the theater I could not remember one of the airs to whistle myself.
Its colors lush and vibrant, the animation takes up much of the slack of 
mid-movie.  We observe the greens of the wildly growing jungle, as well as 
the reds and browns of the wondrous city.  Every now and then we come across 
scenery that appears virtually realistic, as in the objects of gold given to 
the fake gods.  On the whole, images of Central American Indian art serve as 
an engaging motif.  Especially striking is a giant, fancifully animated 
green lizard manipulated by the insidious Tzekel-Kan.  Beyond its 
achievements in vivid aquas and reds and teals, the angles of the animated 
"cameras" are average; there are very few visual joyrides like we 
experienced in last summer's Disney offering TARZAN.
THE ROAD TO EL DORADO does not stand up to DreamWorks' previous success, THE 
PRINCE OF EGYPT.  My daughter, a few months short of twelve, commented on 
how much she likes the city - a compliment to the team of animators.  This 
is only one indication in my mind that the story might have been stronger.  
Writers Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio could have picked up the pace in several 
scenes of building action, but their ending is both picturesque and 
action-filled.  All ages would qualify to enjoy THE ROAD TO EL DORADO - it 
is a diverting buddy movie and a magnificent series of paintings, done by 
both humans and computers.  I don't know that it will end up in our home 
collection of videos, but I am not sorry we took the children to see it.
