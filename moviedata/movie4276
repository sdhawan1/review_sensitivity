At first glance at the cast list, one may instantly become under the 
impression that "Down to You" is a "teen" movie. There's Freddie Prinze, Jr. 
("She's All That"), Julia Stiles ("10 Things I Hate About You"), Selma Blair 
("Cruel Intentions"), Shawn Hatosy ("Outside Providence"), Rosario Dawson 
("Light It Up"), and Ashton Kutcher (TV's "That '70s Show"). Times, how they 
are a' changin', as all of these actors have graduated from being in high 
school to college, and the finale is even set after college graduation. What 
has remained the same, however, are the maturity levels of the characters, 
most of which rarely act like adults, but rather twentysomethings who are 
still stuck in their high school days. 
Told in flashback as the two central characters annoyingly chatter away 
directly at the screen, discussing how their relationship blossomed, and then 
ultimately welted away, it is clear Al Connelly (Freddie Prinze, Jr.), an 
aspiring chef, and Imogen (Julia Stiles), a talented artist, are still in 
love with each other, so we are forced to sit around for ninety minutes until 
their inevitable reconciliation. Any film with such a predictable premise 
can, of course, still work, but it is vital that the writing be sharp, the 
actors appealing, and the plot developments satisfying and involving. One out 
of three isn't too bad, considering that it is January, the usual dumping 
ground for films that the studios have little confidence in, and that the 
other two 2000 movies I've seen ("Next Friday" and "Supernova") have been 
haphazard, to put it mildly.
When a film uses the vexatious gimmick of characters narrating the story as 
they talk squarely to the camera, the technique is usually a sign of 
amateurishness and desperation on the filmmaker's part. First-time 
feature-film director Kris Isacsson also wrote the screenplay to "Down to 
You," and you can easily tell it's a novice effort, as its approach to the 
subject matter is often shallow, uneven, or just a plain, old bad idea (Al 
talking to a spider in the middle of a supposed-to-be dramatic montage pops 
instantly to mind). The relationship between Al and Imogen, which the film 
centers entirely around, is one that isn't nearly developed enough to be 
fully engaging. After a couple charming early sequences where they "get to 
know each other," an overwhelming number of scenes between the two take place 
in bed, and since this is a PG-13 movie we're talking about, the proceedings 
come off as acutely tame, and rarely ever push the plot forward.
As Al and Imogen, Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Julia Stiles have winning chemistry 
with one another, but Stiles consistently acts Prinze, Jr. right off the 
screen. Clearly, a refreshingly bright talent, Stiles has been a standout in 
both last spring's superior "10 Things I Hate About You" and this film, and 
is able to inquire an added level of layers to her character of Imogen. We 
care for Imogen, and what happens with her, because she is an intelligent, 
sweet-natured young woman with ideas and goals for herself. In contrast, 
Prinze, Jr. is undeserving of his recent rising popularity. Frequently wooden 
or unable to sell the lines of dialogue he is given, his very limited thesp 
abilities are even more noticeable next to Stiles. Due to this, Al isn't a 
believable character, and next to Imogen, he seems intellectually lacking. 
What Imogen sees in Al outside of his cute physical appearance never is made 
particularly clear, and that is probably because Isacsson was unsure himself 
while penning the uneven script.
The supporting characters are almost unanonymously badly handled, with only 
Zak Orth and Shawn Hatosy, as Al's best friends, turning in something 
resembling more than one dimension. Orth, especially, makes quite an 
impression as Monk, a quirky pornography filmmaker whom Al is always going to 
for advice. Throughout the picture, up until his final scene, Orth is 
gradually able to unveil Monk's human side, and there is a very subtle 
development late in that is the one surprising element of the film, and 
actually makes perfect sense when you think back on his earlier scenes. 
Hatosy has less to do, but is a naturalistic actor, one that never 
disappoints, no matter how limiting his role is (and let's face it, it is very
 limited here). Meanwhile, Selma Blair, as Cyrus, a part-time student/adult 
film actress, is criminally wasted and only sketchily written, while Rosario 
Dawson, as Imogen's party-girl friend Lana, has even less to do.
"Down to You" is saved from being a total washout because of its final ten 
minutes, which hint at the possible depth and perceptiveness that the rest of 
the film is sorely lacking in its topics of true love and lasting 
relationships. The actors all have the ability to give strong performances, 
as they have in the past (except for Prinze, Jr., who hasn't proven anything 
to me yet), but either they are brought down by the unskillful writing, or by 
not even being given the chance to create flesh-and-blood characters. For 
example, Blair's Cyrus, we sense, is an individual hiding her insecurities 
just underneath the surface--a possibly intriguing subplot that the film 
frustratingly bypasses. For all of its attractive attributes, "Down to You" 
never rises above being merely skin-deep.

Cast: Freddie Prinze Jr., Julia Stiles, Shawn Hatosy, Zak Orth, Selma Blair,
Rosario Dawson, Henry Winkler, Lucie Arnez, Ashton Kutchner
Director: Kris Isacsson
Late in Down To You, the lead female character (Julia Stiles) states her
greatest fear is having an "artificial conversation" with her boyfriend
(Freddie Prinze Jr.).  The irony of this statement will not be lost on audience
members who have not yet walked out, fallen asleep, or otherwise given up on
this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy.  The film is a multi-million dollar
testament to everything artificial.  Filled with characters, motivation, plot
and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every step this is an unquestionable
disaster.
Prinze plays a college student intent on playing the field until he falls for
Stiles' freshman co-ed.  At first the movie seems to be an attempt to string
along scenes with the sole purpose of out-doing the previous in how "cute" it
can be.  The happy couple "psychoanalyze" each other; they pick out a song
because, as Prinze's DJ mother (Lucie Arnez) explains, every couple needs a
song; he smells her shampoo; she scratches his chest in the morning to let him
know she wants to make love.
Then, in standard romantic comedy style, things fall apart.  Why?  Well,
because they have to.  Otherwise the couple can't make up and live (presumably)
happily ever after.
Down To You exists outside the realm of normal logic.  Scenes do not connect to
each other and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism, but
this is handled so poorly that everything comes off random and stupid instead. 
A picnic scene involving the six key characters is just bizarre, not only for
the stretched logic of these people hanging out together, or even knowing each
other, but mostly because an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated to a
goat.
The supporting characters are remarkably flat, and insultingly ridiculous as
well.  Stiles' best friend (Rosario Dawson) is a pot head, Prinze's roommate
(Shawn Hatosy) is a girl crazy fool who can't meet women, and then there are
the porn stars (Zak Orth and Selma Blair).  He is one of those famous porn
stars who is frequently interviewed on television, does the college lecture
circuit, and stars in high budget costume epic porns that are shot on film. 
You know, the average porn star.  The costume epic idea gives him a reason to
appear in a different ridiculous outfit everytime he's on screen, the porn
angle exists just so there can be a couple of stupid sex jokes.  She is a porn
star mostly so we know she's slutty, so her very existence will make Stiles
jealous and Prinze tempted.
Attempts at drama (which means Julia is going to cry) include a pregnancy scare
and the big break up.  These characters are so insipid only the most forgiving
viewer would be manipulated by these weak scenes.
What happened here?  The cast is full of likable, promising, young actors
(Stiles especially seems to be going places).  Writer/director Kris Isacsson
has simply given them material so weak not even seasoned pros could pull it
off.  In fact the whole film feels like a reworking of last year's extremely
unpleasant The Story of Us, for teen audiences.
The direction is film-school-grad obvious.  It's stylish in a hugely self
conscious way which throws in split screen, a pointless parody of "Cops,"
characters walking into the flashbacks of other characters, and a hilariously
cheesy airport meeting between Prinze and Stiles where all the extras move in
fast motion while the couple moves in extreme slow motion.  Plus, the whole
story is told flashback style, narrated by Prinze and Stiles directly
addressing the camera.
This is the second film in a row (following Wing Commander) starring Freddie
Prinze Jr. which should have premiered on the aisles of the local Blockbuster
but was likely saved from that fate due to the fluke success of She's All That.
 If he doesn't start making better choices fast his future films won't be so
lucky.

DOWN TO YOU (2000) by JOHN SYLVA of OFCS (www.ofcs.org)
Freddie Prinze Jr. in a film directed at teenagers: This is usually a statement
that crushes any film true to it, but with "Down To You," I can't make the
inference of his films being so bad quite so easily anymore.  Kris Isacsson's
surprisingly respectable debut in directing and writing somewhat successfully
captures the complexity and hardship in relationships that touching dramas such
as 1999's "The Story of Us" did, rather than creating an extended metaphor of
teenager's lives that films such as "She's All That" did.  "Down to You" is
much more mature a film than one would imagine, as its ensemble of teenage
oriented actors (Freddie Prinze Jr., Julia Stiles, Shawn Hatosy) would imply
that this is just another, run of the mill, teeny bopper fest of proms, drugs,
and fighting, but Isacsson proves these stereotyped predictions wrong.
Set in college, "Down to You" focuses on Al Connelly (Freddie Prinze Jr., who
breaks out from the norm with an above average performance), and the
relationship that would forever change his life, that being with Imogen (Julia
Stiles), an aspiring artist, and the twists and turns and complete nose dives
taken throughout. The film unfolds in flashback (Hey! A real literary tactic!),
as we see Al meet Imogen at a popular college bar/hangout, where their
relationship will blossom.  The two seem to instantly fall in love, followed by
the usual arguments that sink relationships in romantic comedies, and also the
peaks that show the viewer why they're together in the first place.
The cast as a whole comes off with much positive energy and appeal, even if
many of the actors have resumes that couldn't impress anyone over the age of
16.  Freddie Prinze Jr. is somewhat mediocre as usual, but this time around
it's a higher level of mediocrity, a level that can almost receive a positive
grade.  As his energetic partner, Julia Stiles gleams in her natural
performance that is captivating and real.  Stiles adds a level of realism to
"Down to You" that hardly any so-called teen flicks can capture, as rather than
a self absorbed, snotty little brat, Imogen is a caring, realistic young adult.
It's apparent when Isacsson was writing "Down to You" for the sake of making
money, and when he was writing for the sake of making a good movie, as one
scene will hint at "teen" films such as "She's All That" or "Drive Me Crazy,"
but the next will hint at the dramatic intensity of films such as "Titanic." 
If the script was written for the sole purpose of quality over box office
gross, "Down to You" could have been a much stronger film with the maturity
level of adult relationship movies.  From a teen's point of view, "Down to You"
is probably the best thing since their beloved Backstreet Boys, as the
emotionally charged film is surprisingly high quality for the type of film it
is trying to be.
Sure, people will automatically label "Down to You" a "teen" film, but some of
the vibes that come off of the film tell me that this is actually a film with
much higher ambitions, one that could've been more appealing to adults than
teens.  The film comes close to pulling off a complete turn around for the
"teen" genre, but Isacsson throws in too many cliched scenes that fall flat. 
Nonetheless, "Down to You" is a highly entertaining, enchanting film, even if
it is terribly uneven, bouncing between a mature relationship film and an
immature teen flick.  
The Bottom Line: Surprisingly well-made film with a gem of a performance from
Julia Stiles.

Susan Granger's review of "DOWN TO YOU" (Miramax Films)
        More and more movies are being made for a target audience -
and this bland romantic comedy is aimed at an under-20 demographic,
particularly teenage girls. Rated PG-13, it's about a young couple
experiencing the thrill, along with the trials and tribulations, of
their first love.  Freddie Prinze Jr. (She's All That) plays Al, a
genial New York City college student aiming for a career as a
world-class chef, like his celebrated father, while Julia Stiles (10
Things I Hate About You) is Imogen, a talented art student who steals
his heart. Early in the plot, he brings her a cake. "This is sacred,"
Al says about cooking. "Cake is my world," Imogen purrs. But the path
of true love never runs smooth, particularly in this cliche-ridden,
one-dimensional soap-opera, written and directed by Kris Isacsson. A
silly sub-plot revolves around Al's kooky room-mate (Zak Orth), a
cynical, aspiring film-maker, being pursued by a seductive porn
starlet (Selma Blair) who used to study chemistry at M.I.T.  Plus
there's a guy named Jim Morrison (Ashton Kutcher) who's predictably
obsessed with this rock-star namesake. But there's no real dramatic
thrust. Henry Winkler and Lucie Arnaz do their professional best as
Al's parents who dream of the day when their son can work with his
dad, known as Chef Ray, on television; their high-concept show would
have the pair storming, like cops, into unsuspecting people's homes
and making dinner for them. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
Down to You is a cutesy, shallow, formulaic 3. Maybe it will work
better on video.

_Down_to_You_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
        When Miramax's publicity department announced that their youth romance
_Down_to_You_ would not be screened in advance for critics because they
were running behind in getting prints finished, it was easy to peg that
excuse as a bunch of hooey.  After all, this _is_ January, the
traditional dumping ground for cinematic refuse.  While I don't think the
film is quite at that low level, it does suffer from a big problem--one
that is, interestingly enough, suggested by Miramax's no-screening
reason: in terms of content, the film feels unfinished itself.
        First-time writer-director Kris Isacsson does have his basic components
in place.  The heart of the film is the love story--told in heavy
flashback--between two New York college students, aspiring chef Al
(Freddie Prinze Jr.) and artist Imogen (Julia Stiles).  Their love is
first love--meaning passionate, impetuous, and in many ways immature. 
For the most part, what is not immature is Isacsson's honest portrayal of
such a type of relationship.  This being a standard-issue Hollywood
romance, it's not a spoiler to say that Al and Imogen are destined to end
up together.  Adding authenticity to such a convention is the unforced
rapport between Prinze and Stiles.  Yet as easily as their chemistry
convinces that these two do belong together, one does get the sense that
these two characters aren't quite ready to make the commitment to match
their natural compatibility.  They're human, but they're also quite
young, and thus prone to do things that make little sense, least of all
to themselves--and Al and Imogen hold true to that fact.
        While Al and especially Imogen come off as real people, their supporting
cast is sketchy at best.  Selma Blair is wasted in a throwaway role as a
porn star attracted to Al; Rosario Dawson is similarly squandered as
Imogen's flaky friend Lana.   At one point, Al gets on the outs with his
actor/also-porn-dabbling friend Monk (Zak Orth), but one never gets a
clear idea of who Monk is and how close he is with Al that it's
impossible to care.  The background players that remotely make any
impressions are those used for cheap comic relief: Al's workout-happy
roomie Eddie (Shawn Hatosy) and Al's TV chef father (Henry Winkler).
        But even those two fail to serve their real purpose: they really aren't
all that funny.  Then again, neither are all of the stabs at comedy in
_Down_to_You_.  This being a PG-13 film, the numerous porn and sex gags
are not only dumbed-down but played-down, thus rendering them pointless. 
In fact, all the attempts for laughs feel pointless, for they serve to
distract from the real matter at hand--the Al/Imogen romance. 
_Down_to_You_ feels unfinished largely because Isacsson never decided
what he really wanted to make: a straight romance, or a romantic comedy. 
As such, we have a love story whose charm is often undercut by silly
would-be comedy such as one character's attempted suicide by shampoo
ingestion.
        Like its title, _Down_to_You_ ultimately comes down to one person, and
that is Stiles.  As she demonstrated in _10_Things_I_Hate_About_You_, not
only is she an actress blessed with beauty and real presence, she also is
quite talented; she is able to suggest a depth to Imogen not necessarily
written in Isacsson's script.  She is also able to bring out a charm in
her co-star that I had never before seen in his other films.  I look
forward to seeing her in a real movie, for underachieving fluff such as
_Down_to_You_ fail to serve this promising new star any justice.

Rated on a 4-star scale
Screening venue: Odeon (Liverpool City Centre)
Released in the UK by Film Four on May 19, 2000; certificate 12; 92 minutes; 
country of origin USA; aspect ratio 1.85:1
Directed by Kris Isaacson; produced by Jason Kilot, Joana Vicente.
Written by Kris Isaacson.
Photographed by Robert Yeoman; edited by Stephen A. Rotter.
The characters in "Down to You" are stupid, all right, but at least they're 
more convincingly ALIVE than most young folks in American movies. These are 
college-age kids in a cutesy romantic comedy who screw, drink, smoke tobacco 
and pot, are familiar with music that came out before the invention of the 
CD, and have detailed discussions about pornography. None of this is 
presented as risque, as it was in "American Pie" -- it's seen as normal.
That's refreshing. The rest of the movie is pretty lame. Freddie Prinze Jr, 
from last summer's teen romance "She's All That", plays the guy, Al. Julia 
Stiles, from last summer's teen romance "10 Things I Hate About You", plays 
the girl, Imogen. They fall in love, break up, and fall in love again. The 
end.
The vices of the characters and texture of the atmosphere make "Down to You" 
watchable -- I know that kids from the USA aren't as hard-edged as youngsters 
from this side of the pond, but surely they can't be the bland, non-alcoholic 
virgins that most teen flicks make them out to be. The downside of the movie 
is the way it frames its story in retrospect, with embarrassing 
direct-to-camera interview-style dissections of what's going on onscreen, and 
a voice-over narration that treats a typical Hollywood love story as 
something Really Important. Woody Allen can get away with that, because his 
screenplays offer witty insights and entertaining self-obsession. Here it's 
gimmicky and annoying.
What I will remember about seeing the film is that the group of young girls 
in front of me thought I was Freddie Prinze Jr. Every time a close-up of the 
star filled the screen, one of them would turn around, make eye contact with 
me, then shoot round again, whispering "It's him, it's him!" to another. When 
his name appeared in the end credits, a couple of them said it to themselves, 
as if making a mental note. I dimmed the lights when I got home, and checked 
my reflection in the mirror, and yeah, I can sort of see a resemblance. 
Similar cheekbones, similar hair (on that day), et cetera. But I don't look 
like him all that much, really, and I hope the girls didn't see me in the 
light. I wouldn't want to spoil their illusion.

Rated PG-13 (brief graphic language, other mild language, sensuality and
related themes), 100 minutes, 2000. Miramax. Freddie Prinze, Jr, Julia Stiles,
Henry Winkler, Shawn Hatosy, Zak Orth, Selma Blair, Ashton Kutcher, Rosario
Dawson. Directed by Kris Isacsson.
When he defined morality, Hemmingway said that if you felt good after doing
something it was fundamentally good, and if you felt badly it was fundamentally
evil. I felt bad after watching Down To You. Hyperbole, you say? Yes, of
course, I retort, but youâll thank me in the end.
Maybe it was that neither of these characters are especially good people that
we can even begin to care about. Maybe it was that they did and said wretched
things to one another throughout the course of what some critics are calling
The Story Of Us-lite. Maybe itâs that the screenplay isnât the least bit
involving, or original, and instead volunteers tired teen and college clichĂŠs.
But, even after all that, Iâm pretty sure it was the ending.
Down To You begins and develops in what is becoming a much too common way to
tie up your narrative. It must have been in the latest edition of "How to Write
The Great American Screenplay," or something. The characters speak directly to
camera (which, you would think, would be weird to the people around them; see
Wayneâs World for the real way to do this) and relate their trite and
exhausted tale of romance passed.
Al, played by the incomprehensibly effete Freddie Prinze, Jr., begins weaving
the story of how they met, his "first love," he says. Cut to a bar a couple of
years back, Alâs in his sophomore year of college, sitting in a booth at a
bar ("We thought it was cool âcause they didnât check I.D.") discussing
with a friend the latterâs venture into the porn industry, and another friend
who wants to get into the business through this guy, Monkâs, connections. (A
timeline in the forthcoming relationship is basically provided by how far up
the ladder Monk travels in the industry: first low-key star, then director,
then withdrawalâ'like Boogie Nights for the kiddies.)
Anyway, somehow Al catches a glance at Imogen (Julia Stiles, not as clever or
quick witted here as her heroine of last yearâs 10 Things I Hate About You,
although that film earned the same two-and-a-half stars), a freshman who spends
a lot of time drinking and doing drugs (not always on screen), but is somehow
constantly sober enough to pop out the occasional one-liner. They start
talkingâ'something about Patsy Clineâ'and eventually begin dating. There are
a few useless subplots, like constant flirtation between Monkâs co-stars and
Al, problems between Al and his dad (Henry Winkler), etc., etc. But mainly the
movie centers on the budding relationship of Prinze, Jr. and Stiles. 
Things start off well, but then itâs like a three-year-old with access to a
light switch. On and off. On and off. The bickering never ceases, and neither
does the making up, which, according to Al, is when "it feels best" to be with
her. So we get into this constant cycle, allowing them to have their odd little
"relationship high," cursing and blaming one another just to get back to making
up. Then it starts to fall apart, and after seeing these people fight for 90
minutes we finally get to see what we know would, at long last, make them just
shut up so we can go home. And then, ugh, the Hollywood clichĂŠ machine kicks
into gear, tosses us our happy ending, and says "everything will be all right
now, you can go".
Watching Down To You, which is the directorial debut of Kris Isacsson, I came
to realize what Hollywood is missing out on. When I saw the ultimately
disappointing 10 Things I Hate About You, I celebrated the performance of Larry
Miller, who played the concerned father of two teenage girls. Here, I noted the
dazzling performance of Henry Winkler. And while Winklerâs role is not as
well written as Millerâs, it came to me. What we need is not a movie about
teenagers starring teenagers, but rather a movie about teenagers starring
parents, because, apparently, they lead lives which are much more interesting
and creative than their children. At least then, rather than lamenting over the
silly college affairs of immature losers we could go behind-the-scenes of a
t.v. show Winkler pitches as an on-air chef: "Cooks." Like "Cops", but not.

Teen flicks. Can a film still be considered a "teen flick" when it is set in
college, speaks of "true love", the path of one's professional career and
reflective issues such as pregnancy, cheating on one's mate and
long-distance relationships? Of course! Especially when it stars two of the
hot young actors from last year's teen flick hits, SHE'S ALL THAT (6.5/10)
and 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU (7/10), Freddie Prinze Jr. and Julia Stiles,
respectively.
PLOT:
A young man set to begin his life after college, ponders the moments that
led to his first true love, their misadventures within the world of the
tingles, and the happy and sad times of their topsy-turvy relationship.
CRITIQUE:
Kinda cute, kinda sweet, kinda corny, kinda predictable, kinda romantic,
kinda funny, kinda dramatic and kinda forgettable...and ultimately, kinda
so-so. I've generally given greater points to these predictable "teen
flicks" when they come saddled with a couple of charming stars who can hold
my attention for the entire 90 minutes, and this one had just that, with
Freddie Prinze coming through once again as the shy, goofy, romantic lead,
and Julia Stiles, as the cute, ambitious, engaging co-star. Does the film
offer us any new insights into those loopy men from Mars or women from
Venus? Well, not really, but I suppose I just happened to be in the mood for
a light, romantic, easy-going drama with a couple of laughs (The "Cooks!" TV
show was pretty funny), and I guess this movie offered me just that with not
much else. Truth is, this film is probably more of a "video movie" than
anything else. Rent it with your better half, cuddle up next to a
wood-burning fire, warm up some nachos and get jiggy with it for the rest of
the nite. You might also want to bring a date to this film, seeing as it has
a lot to do with people meeting and getting to know each other better, and
be prepared to jostle over the film's depth for a maximum of five minutes
afterwards.
You'll also be happy to know that there are no fart, poop or vomit jokes in
the entire film (Although those types of jokes do have a place in some
movies), and that the two sing-a-long sequences from the respective stars,
despite lacking originality, were quite lovey-dovey and adorable in their
own sugar-coated, manufactured way. I have to admit that I didn't much care
for the exaggerated side characters in the film, especially Selma Blair and
Zak Orth, who just seemed to be there as "bizarre" distractions to the main
cute couple. All in all, I guess it would help if you were in a relationship
yourself when you see this movie, or at least have savored a touch of the
big L sometime in your lifetime. Otherwise, suck in all the sap and goofy
romance still rolling around in your grey ol' heart, and enjoy this light
feather of a film for nothing more than what it is: the simple love story of
a couple of cute kids.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
One of Freddie Prinze Jr's earliest roles was playing the role of "Tough
Guy" on the February 10, 1995 episode of TV's "Family Matters". He had a
four-line part playing some punk kid who brought a gun to school. He then
went on to star in several after-school specials, including one called
"Detention: Siege at Johnson High", co-starring the man who plays his dad in
this picture, Henry Winkler.
Some of you might remember Julia Stiles from one of her earliest roles as
Bridget O'Meara, daughter of Tom O'Meara, played by Harrison Ford, in 1997's
THE DEVIL'S OWN.
Selma Blair is probably best known for her "shocking" french-kissing scene
with Sarah Michelle Gellar in 1999's CRUEL INTENTIONS (7.5/10). Ironically,
Selma herself once auditioned for the role of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, a
role which Gellar has owned since the show's debut in 1997.
This is director Kris Isacsson's first feature film. In 1996, he was
credited as being Barbra Streisand's "assistant" for the film THE MIRROR HAS
TWO FACES (7/10).

In writer/director Kris Isacsson's light-weight film, DOWN TO YOU, two
college kids fall in and out of love.  Freddie Prinze Jr. and Julia
Stiles, the movie's likable stars, manage to be mildly interesting in a
film that almost never is.
The story has some intriguing story elements, but the director seems
lost about what to do with them.   And Robert Yeoman's bland and
uninviting cinematography doesn't provide much support to a movie that
could use some help.
Al (Prinze) is an upper classman who spies a beautiful freshman, Imogen
(Stiles), at a party.  Their initial exchange, with its excessively cute
dialog, doesn't bode well for the rest of the story.  Her name, she
feels obligated to explain, came from a name book that her mother used.
When she gets -- quite unconvincingly -- tipsy, she blames it on her
boozing style.  "I shouldn't drink between drinks," she tells him.
The movie's only effective moments are the frequent asides that the
leads give to the camera.  In these they seem to be honestly talking
about love, in contrast to their lack of much genuine chemistry when
they're together.  Stiles tries hard, but the obvious conclusion is that
she's better cast when she's nasty, as she was in 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT
YOU, than when she's nice, as she is here.
Much of the show concerns the many minor characters.  Al's father (Henry
Winkler) has a famous television cooking show, "Chef Ray."  His scheme
for his son is that they should create a "reality-based cooking show."
In a dream sequence we get to watch an episode as a SWAT team of chefs
descends on a typical suburban home.  With guns drawn, they throw out
the family's bad food and teach them how to cook better meals.
Another, and even lamer, subplot concerns Al's porn star roommate.  No
BOOGIE NIGHTS, DOWN TO YOU has the porn star spending his time in press
interviews, lecturing on college campuses and writing his first book.
His porn co-star is an MIT chemistry drop-out.
When the movie can't keep the romance angle going, it falls back on teen
movie clichés .  "What do kids do whenever they can't work things out?"
Imogen asks her roommate (Rosario Dawson).  "ParDEE!  ParDEE!" the
roommate fires back.
DOWN TO YOU runs 1:38.  It is rated PG-13 for sexual situations and
profanity and would be acceptable for kids 12 and up.

Starring-Freddie Prinze Jr., Julia Stiles, Zak Orth,
Shawn Hatosy, Selma Blair and Henry Winkler
Director-Kris Isaacson
Canadian Rating-PG
Released by Miramax Films - 01/00
Ahh yes. The teenage romance.  An attractive young cast is pitted into
an unlikely scenario that could only happen in the movies, and in the
end, the guy always gets the girl. And with the arrival of the breakout
hit `She's All That' last year (followed by a long catalogue of
imitators including `10 Things I Hate About You' and `Drive Me Crazy'),
the genre previously on life support is once again a hot commodity.
Along now comes `Down to You'. The folks at Miramax are obviously trying
to capitalize on the rabid `She's All That' craze with their latest
project, which has the studdly Freddie Prinze Jr. attached and all. Only
`Down to You' doesn't have the unlikely scenario' mentioned above. It
is an extraordinarily ordinary romance - a dull, unattractive teen
comedy that sticks to the boring game plan that we're accustomed to.
This is the kind of romance that only giggly 12-year old girls will find
convincing. In strictly textbook fashion, college sophomore and aspiring
chef Al (Prinze Jr.) meets freshman artist Imogen (Julia Stiles). They
hit it off like a couple can only in the movies. From here, it's the
standard boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl,
boy-drinks-entire-bottle-of-shampoo-and-may-or-may-not-get-girl-back
story. The plot is conveniently assembled to suit the requirements of
the main characters, who are frequently taking part in activities
that.... well, only happen in the movies.
Fortunately, the cast of `Down to You' has a certain appeal. Freddie
Prinze Jr. and Julia Stiles are an adorable couple, and when on screen
together, they radiate the sort of warmth and charisma that the movie
should have centered around. Zak Orth, as the newly realized porn star
Monk, shows an unmistakable flair with handling all of the film's
intelligent dialogue. Rounding out the impressive ensemble of young
talent are Shawn Hatosy (`The Faculty'), Selma Blair (`Cruel
Intentions') and Ashton Kutcher (TV's `That 70's Shows'). Even The Fonz
himself - Henry Winkler, the epitome of teenage angst and nostalgia -
has a welcome role as Al's dad, the host of the popular cooking program
`Chef Ray'. Maybe the concept of `Down to You' looked good on paper to
draw such a crowd. As a feature film, however, the finished product is
bland and tasteless fluff with only an occasional whiff of cuteness to
keep the gears from stopping entirely.
Perhaps worst of all, `Down to You' is not funny. The jokes are drawn
from obvious sources and the resulting humor is banal and uninspired.
The characters on screen, often laughing at each other's
goofy/embarrassing antics, seemed far more amused than the audience.
Even the giggly 12-year old girls had grown restless toward the end as
they waited impatiently for the formula to run it's course. The one
mildly clever segment featured Winkler and Prinze Jr. in a fantasy
sequence called `Cooks', a `COPS' take-off in which the father and son
would storm houses and cook a decent meal for needy' families (with the
assistance of a fully-armed SWAT team, of course). When this is the
highlight reel, you know the remaining film could leave something to be
desired.
In order to make a teen comedy work, you've got to have characters that
show something by way of depth and identity. `10 Things I Hate About
You' actually featured characters who were more than walking flashcards,
and the result was refreshing. No such luck with `Down to You'. It's
just a textbook romance where, despite absurd circumstances, everything
is bound to work out in the end. And at the end of the whole clichéd
ordeal, the nicest thing you could possibly say would be `.... only in
the movies'.

In 1997, I spoke with "Down To You" star Freddie Prinze Jr. about his
sly, perfectly measured supporting performance in "The House of Yes,"
a delicious little black comedy about seduction, madness, incest and
the Kennedy assassination. The talented actor was exceedingly polite
and well spoken as he enthusiastically discussed acting
techniques. After interviewing too many preening, pretentious,
self-absorbed Hollywood heartthrobs, Prinze's down-to-earth, working
class nature was very refreshing.
The only thing wrong was his hair. Styled in a fashion popular with
young showbiz studs, his coal black hair was close-cropped on the
sides and back, with the top left thick, messed-up and heavily
moussed. The desired effect of the hairdo, I think, is to look as if
you had just crawled out of bed and, should the right person come
along, would be ready to crawl right back in again. Of course, the
mousse ruins any appearance of spontaneity and the 'do packs about as
much oomph as a lacquered explosion. On a guy as genuine as Prinze,
such a trendy, artificial hairstyle simply didn't fit.
Drivel like "Down To You" doesn't fit Prinze either. Aimed at
starry-eyed young girls, the cookie-cutter romantic comedy is trite,
tedious and even blander than its title. To try and jazz things up,
the filmmakers throw in wacky parents, colorful sidekicks, flashbacks
within flashbacks and unusual scene dissolves, but there's no
disguising the dullness of the main storyline. You can arrange Pop
Tarts artfully on a platter, dust them with powdered sugar and
artfully drizzle stings of chocolate and raspberry sauce over
everything, but, in the end, it's still just a plate of Pop Tarts.
Prinze isn't alone here in the squandering of talent. Julia Stiles,
the tempestuous lead in "10 Things I Hate About You," also adds some
flotsam to her resume. And poor Shawn Hatosy, so winning as the
central character in last year's "Outside Providence," is reduced to
playing a perpetually horny goofball. As for Zak Orth (the loudmouth
boorish student from "In and Out"), his role here as a loudmouth
boorish porn star with delusions of becoming Orson Welles may actually
be a step up.
Prinze (and, although they have made fewer poor decisions, Stiles and
Hatosy as well) would do well to use Matt Damon as a role model. Damon
could easily have traded on his All-American good looks, playing
terminally pleasant pretty boys in one film after another, but
instead, he has carefully selected roles that challenge his skills, as
well as the sensibilities of his fan base. While the lure of an easy
paycheck is undoubtedly tempting, Prinze has gone from nervy ("The
House of Yes") to tolerable ("I Know What You Did Last Summer" and
"She's All That") to for-the-love-of-God-what-were-you thinking ("Wing
Commander," "I Still Know What You Did Last Summer" and, now, "Down To
You"). An "aw shucks" demeanor and crooked grin will only carry a
performer so far. If Prinze doesn't start taking some chances soon, he
is in danger of being hopelessly typecast as an innocuous male
ingenue. As he ages and his looks fade, where will that leave him?
Trying to snag a gig on a syndicated TV action series? Prinze deserves
better than that.
You'll notice I've said virtually nothing about the plot. That's
because there is virtually nothing to say. Boy meets girl, boy loses
girl, yadda yadda yadda. The lead characters frequently address the
camera directly; a stylistic gimmick that has been done to death over
the last couple of years. The bulk of the story is told in flashbacks,
further dashing any hint of immediacy. Henry Winkler and Lucie Arnaz
offer a bit of distraction as the quirky, loving parents: he's the
flashy host of a TV cooking show and she's a disc jockey who actually
likes what she plays. Although the movie is only 90 minutes long, it
feels like three hours. Thank goodness for the soundtrack, which
offers a nice selection of melodic ditties.
If you're a young lady who hasn't seen very many films, you may find
"Down To You" dreamy, occasionally naughty and wonderfully
romantic. If you're not, you probably were so bored by the trailers
that you never even considered seeing this movie. Good for
you. Watching talented young actors slowly committing career suicide
is not a pretty sight.

 Down to You was a case of adding insult to injury.
 The injury was having to see this film at all.  I would rather suffer
whiplash in a VW bug than sit through this film again.  The insult was
that all through this film, I had to listen to three annoying teens who
threw popcorn (which often landed on me).
 Down to You is a very cheap romantic comedy about Al (Freddie Prinze
Jr.), a love struck college student, and the object of his affection,
Imogen (Julia Stiles).  Despite two people who have brought at least
bearable teen movies in the past (Prinze with She's All That and Stiles
with 10 Things I Hate About You), these two never end up having either
the chemistry or the humor to keep the majority of audiences engaged for
90 minutes.  In fact, they have all of the chemistry of a couple
eternally plagued with a lack of spark.  For instance, they don't greet
each other with the standard cinema kiss we have come to expect: it's a
hug.  Also, despite the fact that they are both in college and that one
of them does show some talent for promiscuity, they take three months of
dating before they first have sex.  In the words of its target audience:
as if.
 Along the way on our ride down Melodrama Lane (better known as the
film), we have a bizarre cast of supporting characters that might
actually be funny if writer-director Kris Issacson (a man who picked up
humor talents by being the assistant to Barbara Streisand in The Mirror
Has Two Faces) had tried.  We have the porn-star philosopher, Monk (Zak
Orth), the other porn starlet who only wants someone to make her
pancakes (Selma Blair), and the psychedelic drug dealer by the name of
Jim Morrison (Ashton Kutcher).  Each of these could have had great jokes
thrown in, but they never are given the chance.
 The thing that kills the movie the most is actually not its blandness
but its desperate attempts to separate itself from the average teen
movie.  Told in separate voice-overs by Freddie Prinze Jr. and Julia
Stiles, Down to You has the same Nora Ephron feel as you would find in
Sleepless in Seattle.  The entire film feels like it is trying to be
both incredibly 90s and hip and incredibly old-fashioned.  This
combination ends up being the final blow to a very bad movie.
 Outside the theater, I asked some teens about the film.  As expected,
they seemed to think that it was sweet and seemed to get an
extra-special kick out of Jim Morrison.  It looks like I have more
insult added to injury, coming soon to a theatre near you.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Last January, Miramax struck gold with a teen comedy based on the tale
of `Pygmalion.'  She's All That opened to decent reviews and an amazing
$16 million, eventually taking in over $63 million as well as garnering
two MTV Movie Award nominations.  That starred up-and-comers Freddie
Prinze, Jr. and that girl from the anti-heroin commercial that smashes
the egg with the frying pan.
Firm believers that lightning can strike twice, Miramax is back with a
new January teen comedy with Prinze.  The film, Down to You, is
refreshing in the fact that it places its young stars in college rather
than the typical high school setting.  But in doing so, it tries to be
too adult and comes off as a failed attempt at making Annie Hall for the
Gen-Y crowd.  The film also suffers from both a really bad set-up and a
complete lack of a proper ending.
You opens with aspiring chef Al Connelly (Prinze, Wing Commander) in a
New York coffee shop.  As he watches a young couple pawing at each
other, Al explains his story of true love.  He does this by delivering
his lines right into the camera, which makes the whole thing seem like a
hemorrhoid commercial.  So the whole film is a flashback, being told by
Al as he waits in line to get a double mocha latte.
Al launches into the tale of how he first met the girl of his dreams,
which is one of the more bizarre tales I can recall in a mainstream
movie.  He's in a seedy bar with his two pals Eddie and Monk (Shawn
Hatosy, Outside Providence, and Zak Orth, Snow Falling on Cedars), who
are arguing about their sexual stamina.  Monk is a well-endowed rising
star in the porn world and Eddie thinks he has both the girth and vigor
to break into the business as well.  A bet is made involving a bar slag
(Rosario Dawson, Light it Up) and, as a result, Al is left without a bed
for the evening.  When the college sophomore complains about his lack of
sleeping accommodations, Monk points Al toward a wispy freshman that, of
course, turns out to be Ms. Right.
The babe is Imogen (Julia Stiles, 10 Things I Hate About You)  not
Imogene  a first-year student interesting in pursuing an arts career.
She's gorgeous until she opens her mouth, revealing a voice like a
forty-year-old and a maw full of crooked, yellow-tinted fangs.  It
sounds like she's had a three-pack-a-day habit since kindergarten, which
would explain her discolored teeth.  The two hit it off way too easily
and before long Al is introducing Imogen to his television chef dad
(Henry Winkler, The Waterboy) and disc jockey mom (Lucie Arnaz).  I
wonder what the late Freddie Prinze, Sr. would think of  the Fonz
playing his kids screen pop.
As expected, their relationship momentarily turns sour when Imogen
spends a summer in France, but don't worry  things work out.  The
structure of the film is of bigger concern, namely when the two
lovebirds flashback to their first kisses and high school squeezes.  Can
you flashback within a flashback?  Then there is the equally troubling
moment when Imogen starts to co-narrate the film with Al.  How's that
work?  You can't just jump in and hijack the voice-over.  Al is clearly
the main character in the film, so butt out.
You is the feature film debut of Kris Isacsson, an assistant to Barbra
Streisand for The Mirror has Two Faces.  Isacsson also wrote the
screenplay, which features some pretty frank sexual dialogue for a PG-13
film.  Also of note is the fact that the characters are rarely without a
drink in their hands, despite the fact that they're all underage.  Also
look for the hilarious Ashton Kutcher (Kelso from That 70s Show) who
plays a guy named Jim Morrison.
1:40  PG-13 for adult language, sexual content and underage drinking
