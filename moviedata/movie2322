Few movies I have seen are as naturally majestic and wondrous as the
true life story of Grey Owl. Perhaps it's the steady, artful direction
of Richard Attenborough. Or maybe it's the dedicated presence of Pierce
Brosnan in the title role. Whatever the reason, Grey Owl shows
absolutely no sign of false storytelling or Hollywood fakery. The film
glides gracefully from minute one, telling the passionate story of a
strong-minded man who fought the complications of modern society during
the 1930's. And, with both Grey Owl fanatics and those unfamiliar with
the legend, this true story is sure to hit home.
Just one wonderful thing about Grey Owl is how quickly and efficiently
Brosnan makes us forget about James Bond. As we all know, the actor is
just the latest debonair stud-muffin to fill 007's shoes (he'll soon be
appearing in his third Bond entry, The World is Not Enough). You never
even expect Brosnan to crack a witty comeback like we have come to
expect from his James Bond character. He looks dignified in long,
braided hair and a feather headdress - as if he and the surrounding
nature were always destined to interact.
Archie Grey Owl (full name - Archie Belaney) was really an Englishman
living out a childhood fantasy: to be a red Indian and live in the wild.
After traveling to Ontario to become a trapper and hunting guide,
Belaney meets a Mohawk named Pony (Annie Galipeau), who is working as a
waitress at a nearby lodge. With the help of a few adorable beaver kits,
Pony helps Archie find his true bearings, allowing him to get in touch
with his conservational side. Soon, Archie is the most famous red Indian
in the world, delivering public speeches to make people aware of the
nature that so many take for granted.
I'm unfamiliar with the story of Grey Owl, but after seeing the film,
I'm inclined to learn more about this great man. I know, however, that
the character of Belaney is not entirely explored in the film - but this
represents only a minor problem. Brosnan delivers what could be his
finest performance: he is reserved, naturally convincing and completely
effective as he handles the morals that the real Grey Owl stood so
strongly for. At first glance, the acting talents of Galipeau appear to
be very doubtful. But the flow of the story helps accentuate her natural
strengths, and gradually she begins lifting her share of the weight that
had once been so one-sided.
Attenborough also brings the finest details to life in Archie and Pony's
relationship. Grey Owl is no emotional powerhouse; it's success lies
within the fact that the environmental issues are covered so efficiently
without ever being thoughtlessly overblown. The wonderful cinematography
(by Roger Pratt) helps engross the viewer even more, as does the
sweeping photography of tranquil lakes and beautiful green forest. Any
Canadian nature or history buff is going to love what they find here.
Attenborough tries nothing fancy or gimmicky to help bring the legend to
life. Instead, he opts for the most natural presentation you could
possibly imagine. This is why Grey Owl succeeds as it does. This proves
that sometimes, even the most straightforward approach can be the most
effective. And, in the case of Archie Grey Owl, no special Hollywood
tampering is needed. Searching through my Thesaurus under the word
Â‘beautiful', I find these synonyms: alluring, artistic, attractive,
captivating. All of them could be used to describe Richard
Attenborough's Grey Owl.
