Even though I attended film school in the early '80s, I'm loath to admit
that I never saw an Ingmar Bergman until *after* I graduated (odd really;
works by the great angst-focused Swedish director--"Cries and Whispers,"
"Persona," and "Wild Strawberries" to name but a few--would tend to
populate most film studies curricula).  That movie was "Fanny and
Alexander" and I loved it.  Yet to this day, for similarly inexplicable
reasons, it remains the only Bergman movie I've seen (I've seen a few Woody
Allen Ingmar Bergman movies but that's not quite the same thing).
As it happens, "Fanny and Alexander" was the penultimate theatrical film
to be directed by Bergman.  The 82-year-old filmmaker is still alive,
living a semi-reclusive life on a remote island in the Baltic Sea and
winding down his days with the occasional stage and television directing
stint and, I daresay, long walks on the beach.
"Faithless" is the latest film to bear Bergman's name, but he didn't
direct it, and he doesn't even turn in a cameo (although he wrote it and
*is* in it, so to speak).  Erland Josephson plays Bergman as a whiskery,
white-haired old gentleman who, as the film opens, is summoning up a muse
to provide inspiration for a story he wishes to relate.  A difficult
chapter from Bergman's own life, it seems--how the legendary director once
had an affair with an actress, and how that affair, like a lie once told,
spread like a cancer through his private life. 
Bergman asked Liv Ullmann, with whom he had worked many times, to direct
"Faithless" and the actress-turned-director's take on the story is deep and
delicately crafted.  In the film, Lena Endre plays Marianne, a 40-year-old
woman who begins a casual affair with her husband's best friend, David
(played by Krister Henriksson).  Since Marianne's husband Markus (Thomas
Hanzon) is a world-famous classical conductor and therefore often on
different continents, things start out easy and carefree--"perfect"--but
soon enough the deceit and the duplicity start to take their toll.  Adding
another level of complexity to the situation is the fact that Marianne and
Markus have a young daughter, Isabelle (Michelle Gylemo).
"Faithless" is a characteristically fine piece of filmmaking with all of
the actors excelling in their roles (especially Endre, who plays a women
put through the emotional ringer).  Rather than choosing a straightforward
narrative, however, Bergman uses the somewhat contrived plot device of
having Endre's character (as an apparition) help the filmmaker reconstruct
scenes from a marriage, and the result is a dilution of the honesty that is
served up so well in the central story.  It's not enough to spoil one's
"enjoyment" of the film, but the structure is occasionally at odds with the
emotional core of the drama. 
Hats off to the film's screenwriter, however.  Bergman's words, even via
translated subtitles, are powerful and uncompromising and seem to sidestep
many of the clichés found in your standard tale of infidelity.  Clearly
this is a filmmaker who understands the raw range of emotions that
accompany guilt and dishonesty.  Once Markus discovers the cheating lovers
(since, like the perfect crime there is no perfect affair), he sets in
motion a harrowing series of events that test the mettle of Marianne,
David, and we, the audience.
I've still only seen the one Ingmar Bergman movie but, after watching the
shattering "Faithless," I now feel as though I've seen two.

FAITHLESS (TROLÖSA), a 2-1/2 hour angst-filled drama in Swedish about 
the everlasting trauma caused by infidelity, might sound like something 
you would look forward to about as much as getting your teeth drilled.  
But this film, based on a script by Ingmar Bergman and lovingly directed 
by his long-time collaborator Liv Ullmann is absolutely mesmerizing.  
With an astonishing central performance by Lena Endre as Marianne, the 
woman who strays, the film relies on long, talking-head shots of her 
relating her story.  Watching it on television, you might be inclined to 
flip the channel, but, in a movie theater, the experience becomes so 
engrossing that your eyelids may stop blinking.
The screenplay's structure is quite imaginative.  We meet an older 
writer named Bergman (Erland Josephson) who is preparing a script in his 
study.  For material he calls upon an actress, Marianne, with whom he 
has worked extensively.  Like someone relating one of the turning points 
in her life, Marianne begins to create the story from scratch.  Although 
most of the story is told in flashback, Ullman keeps cutting back to the 
study for Marianne to talk directly to the camera.  Since these long 
narrative scenes are just as memorable as the flashbacks, it is hard to 
pick a favorite, as both are so exquisite and hauntingly composed.   
Marianne's story, which Ullman in the press notes says is based on an 
incident in Ingmar Bergman's life, stars Marianne as an attractive, 
40-year-old woman torn between two men.  Like the unusual structure of 
the script, the love affair doesn't follow the conventional cinematic 
formula.  With a palpable honesty, the story follows an affair that 
starts innocently and is more about intimacy than sex.  Indeed, were it 
not for a couple of scenes with explicit sexual discussions, the film 
might have gotten a PG-13 rating.  Don't be confused, however, for this 
is a serious adult film.
The story-within-the-story, which, of course, is the real story, 
concerns an actress, Marianne, who is married to an internationally 
known conductor, Markus (Thomas Hanzon).  The strikingly handsome Markus 
is so attentive to Marianne that she confesses that she sometimes so 
loses her head during sex that she passes out.  In short, he is not the 
type of guy who inspires his wife to go looking for greener pastures.
David (Krister Henriksson), on the other hand, is the solid looking type 
who wouldn't turn any heads but is ruggedly handsome.  He is a stage 
director with whom Marianne has worked closely for years.  She tells us 
that he is like her brother.  One night when Markus is gone, David and 
Marianne enjoy a late night dinner at her house.  Too tired to drive, 
David suggests, innocently enough it seems, that he spend the night 
there in her bed.  He is emotionally troubled so he'd like her to hold 
his hand.  After much giggling and awkwardness, she agrees, insisting to 
us that this will not be incest.  And she is right -- for a time -- 
since nothing happens that night.
Their decision that fateful evening sets them on a trajectory which is 
as certain as a rocket's.  They will eventually come crashing down to 
earth, and it won't be pretty.  Bergman's script is so full of grace and 
subtlety that the picture almost completely avoids incendiary polemics.  
The few times when emotions do run out of control are the picture's low 
points.
As the tragedy heightens, Markus and Marianne's 8-year-old daughter, 
Isabelle (Michelle Gylemo), moves more to the foreground.  She becomes a 
victim of the actions of the adults in her life.  No KRAMER VS. KRAMER 
tale, the movie keeps the focus on the adults even if it is the child 
who most deserves our sympathy.
"Our affinity lay in our memory," Marianne, towards the end, says to 
Bergman about David.  "We grieved for what we had lost."  Deeply 
touching, the movie will stay long in your memory, especially Lena 
Endre's absolutely unforgettable work in it.  It is Oscar worthy acting 
and certainly light-years better than Juliette Binoche's Oscar nominated 
part in CHOCOLAT.
FAITHLESS runs 2:25.  The film is in Swedish with English subtitles.  It 
is rated R for sexual content, some nudity and language and would be 
acceptable for older teenagers.

Legendary filmmaker Ingmar Bergman gets introspective with his
autobiographical story of marriage, infidelity and betrayal, "Faithless,"
directed by his protégé, actress-turned-director Liv Ullmann and starring
Lena Endre as the fickle Marianne.
The story begins with an old man, Bergman (Erland Josephson), struggling
with his script about marriage and fidelity. He has trouble breathing life
into his personal tale and calls upon an actress, Marianne (Endre), to help
him with the task. The beautiful actress may be real or she may be just a
figment of the elderly Bergman's imagination as she helps the writer and
tells him her story.
Marianne is married to Marcus (Thomas Hanzon), a much sought after
orchestra director who spends much of the time away on tour. David (Krister
Henriksson), a family friend and filmmaker (Bergman's alter ego), decides
to fill the void and spends his time with Marianne. An affair soon begins.
David's hair trigger temper and lack of regard for those around him are the
catalyst that will lead to a broken marriage and, especially, grief for
Marianne and Marcus's young daughter Isabelle (Michelle Gylemo)
Ingmar Bergman is known for his moody, reflective work as both director and
writer and "Faithless" is no exception. His story of infidelity and jealous
starts off innocently enough with Marianne reacting to an offhanded
proposition by drunken David with a declaration that they are like brother
and sister, rebuffing the advance. Thinking it all a bit of platonic
flirting, she begins to plan an affair that lands her in Paris with David
while Marcus is, again, on tour. As the passion builds so does her
realization that David is selfish, demanding and doesn't really care about
anyone but himself. Things come to a head when Marcus catches his wife and
best friend in bed. The cuckolded husband vows to get a divorce and take
the one thing away from Marianne that means anything to her - Isabelle.
This long, talky Swedish language film benefits from several levels of
influence. Bergman's biographic tale takes on the proportions of an
accident happening before your eyes - you know, as you watch, that there is
a whole bunch off hurt coming up, but it's too fascinating to turn away
from. You know that Marianne's decision is going to cause pain for her,
Marcus and, especially, Isabelle, but she can't stop it from happening any
more than you can stop her. Your fears, you realize, are going to be met by
the little family and disaster is apparent.
The fascinating drama of jealousy and betrayal is coupled with some
exemplary acting, especially by Lena Endre. The Bergman-favored actress
gives an enigmatic air to Marianne as she moves from innocent playfulness
to a full-blown affair and damn the consequences. Marianne is beautiful
enough to believe that she can control the flirting between her and David.
When they go to Paris, leaving Isabelle with her grandma and Marcus touring
the wilds of America, it is still under the misguided belief that there is
nothing wrong in what they are doing. When David ingenuously asks about her
past affairs, she doesn't see the horns of jealousy sprout. When their
affair ends in anger and confrontation with Marcus, she also doesn't see
that she is going to lose Isabelle, too. Endre gives a powerful, subtle
performance as a woman who makes an irreversible decision and must suffer
the consequences.
The men in her life are more mundane than Marianne. Each is well regarded
in their respective fields - Marcus and music, David and film - but they
are emotionally stilted. They understand that they both love Marianne, but
neither knows the woman or her needs. In the end, everyone loses, with
little Isabelle being the most profoundly affected victim of the adult
decisions. Endre anchors the rest of the small cast.
Liv Ullmann lends an assured hand to her direction, showing the inspiration
acquired from her mentor, Bergman. She is influenced, strongly, by the
elder director, but has developed her own intimate filmmaking stance.
"Faithless," actually feels more French than Swedish, the interlude in
Paris notwithstanding. The close, almost stagy production plays it close to
the chest as the intimacy approaches claustrophobic as Marianne's once
happy life goes down the tubes.
"Faithless" is the kind of film that the buffs love, but is far too
dialogue intensive to attract the more casual filmgoer. I give it a B.

When Marianne (Lena Endre, "Kristin Lavransdotter") takes her and her husband's
best friend David (Krister Henriksson) as a lover, she never anticipates the
tragic events which will follow in writer Ingmar Bergman and director Liv 
Ullmann's "Faithless."
On a remote island, a writer named Bergman (Erland Josephson, "Scenes From
a Marriage") sifts through the contents of a desk drawer, trying to draw
inspiration from memories.  (Bergman purportedly wrote this script based on
an incident from earlier in his life that's continued to haunt him, although
he gave Ullmann complete control over the film.)  Marianne comes to him and 
begins to recount her painful story under his gentle prodding.
Marianne is a successful actress with a happy marriage to a world-reknowned
composer/conducter Markus (Thomas Hanzon, "Private Confessions").  They have
a 9 year old daughter Isabelle (Michelle Gylemo).  Their friend, David, 
a film director with a messy life, frequently joins them for dinner
and acts as an uncle to their daughter.  When Marianne encounters David drunk
and distraught one day, she brings him home.  He suggests they sleep together.  
She laughs it off, proclaiming their relationship like that of brother and 
sister, but the idea takes root.  Marianne, who's won a scholarship to study 
in Paris while Markus is away on a U.S. tour, talks David into a 'happenstance' 
meeting on the continent.
Trouble rears its head almost immediately, when Marianne discovers David's
childish behavior coupled with intense jealousy.  When an initial incident
is smoothed over, their emotional bond becomes stronger - what Marianne had
convinced herself she was doing for 'fun' has become hurtful.  When she leaves
their Parisian hotel room, David pulls a red bedspread over his head and 
Ullman cuts to Isabelle with a white and red bedspread over her head.  This
connects David to the child as well as pointing out Isabelle as the next
victim of Marianne's hurt.  
Marianne can't keep herself from David when they return.  As his actors in
'A Dream Play' rebel, a distraught David asks Marianne to 'come look at your
idiot,' appealing to her vanity.  Markus discovers the lovers and promises
Marianne he will make her hurt, demanding custody of Isabelle.  That's just
the beginning of the hellish descent Marianne continues to agonize over with
Bergman, accusing him of laziness while allowing her, an actress, to shape
his drama out of her real memories.
This bleak and talky Swedish drama is like watching a train wreck.  Lena
Endre's expressive face (beautifully lit by cinematographer Jorgen Persson,
"Smilla's Sense of Snow") keeps our attention whether she's telling her
story or admidst the action of flashback.  Ullmann's deliberate pacing allows
a sickening, gut-wrenching sense of dread to build.  Her staging of Bergman
and Marianne suggest a mentor/student relationship which flows in both 
directions.  Again she uses duality as she shows Marianne and her reflection 
in a mirror, suddenly separated by the ghostly appearance of Isabelle.
Ullmann's direction is strong although Bergman's presence is always evident.
Lena Endre's performance is devastating.
"Faithless" is an open wound of a film, yet its humanity brings a heartfelt  
message.  When Marianne tells Bergman that talking about love is painful, one 
can't help but think that this film will make it far more difficult to ever 
take love for granted.

Liv Ullman may get the directing credit, but every line in Faithless is
stamped Ingmar Bergman (who wrote the script).  Between the immoral
souls of the characters twitching with desires they can't control and
the extended two and a half hours to endure, who else could it be? 
(Bergman's original Fanny and Alexander was close to five hours long,
though the American version is two and a half).
Bergman showed a penchant for family drama with Fanny and Alexander and
Wild Strawberries, among others. He enjoys mixing the imaginary world of
his characters with their reality.  This can lead to a deeper emotional
entanglement with the characters; it's human nature to reflect and react
based on internalized stimuli.  Unfortunately for Faithless, Bergman is
revisiting territory he excelled in some 40 years ago, without shedding
any new light on his subjects.
This isn't the first film in which Bergman has written an old man
getting close to the end and brooding with a fantasy companion about his
wrongdoings.  It's basically Wild Strawberries, only this time the crime
is adultery instead of hubris.  The main character is even sitting at a
desk and writing constantly, again.
Bergman (the character, played by Erland Josephson) is an elderly
gentleman who beckons Marianne (Lena Endre) to discuss her adulterous
relationship with David.  Marianne, an actress, and Markus (Thomas
Hanzon), an orchestra prodigy, have been happily married.  They have a
young daughter, Isabelle (newcomer Michelle Gylemo), and David (Krister
Henrikkson) is their best friend.  David is a director and the
stereotypical brooding, unhappy artist.  One day David offhandedly
suggested sleeping with Marianne, and when she went to Paris on a
special project, he found reason to go as well, and their new
relationship began.
Bergman and Marianne journey through the entire story of the
relationship.  Often the camera cuts from the tense face of him to the
tear-strained eyes of her.  Every once in a while these moments are
punctuated with a flashback sequence.  In fact, the experience feels
more like a play than a film, as screen time is consumed with the two
sitting in a room and chatting away.  The circumstances that brought
Bergman to be the repentant weakling he is today and Marianne as his
mirage take a back seat.  Multiple takes of a man feeling horrible and a
woman crying do not a film make.
Not to say that Faithless is a complete waste of time.  When scenes that
reflect on Isabelle come along, her innocence and quiet intelligence are
well drawn.  Because she gets to underplay the situation she has no
control over, her plight becomes more important than that of her
parents.  This young amateur remarkably carries more presence in her
silence than Marianne does with her tears.
Another fascinating point in the film is how simple and suddenly
adultery can come to pass between two old friends.  No easy excuse is
made for it -- "trouble in the marriage" -- and the subsequent actions
of the characters involved are realistically complicated.  The film
sticks to its story without attempting to pander to a mainstream
audience.
For those who have never seen Bergman's work, this is not the place to
start.  A predecessor by some 40 years, Wild Strawberries is a more
interesting story (even if it was shot in black and white) because the
characters are more active, both in imagination and real time.  They
don't just sit around and brood all day but instead reflect based on
external cues in their environment.  That is what made Strawberries
emotionally engaging.  Perhaps if Faithless was told from beginning to
end instead of through glimpses into a past, driven by tears, it would
have hit half the nerves it was striving to.

I wanted to hate Faithless.  I wanted to hate it so much that I'd leave
after 15 minutes and save the two-plus hours for something that sounded
more enjoyable than a slow-moving Swedish film about marital
infidelity.  You know, like picking out drapes, or giving my cat a bath,
or volunteering to be a mall Santa.
But Faithless turned out to be anything but a bore.  The film, which was
nominated for Best Picture and Best Actress at the European Film Awards,
did more than hold my interest  it shook me to my very core with a
riveting and, at times, horrifying portrayal of the effect infidelity
can have on a close-knit group of people.
The film begins with an old man (Erland Josephson) sitting down at desk
in a room that overlooks the sea.  He opens his notebook to begin
writing a story and, literally, creates a main character out of thin
air.  Her name is Marianne (Lena Endre), and she's a happily married
actress with a beautiful nine-year-old daughter.  The old man asks
Marianne questions about her life and, as she answers, he jots down her
responses as his story begins to take shape.
Despite having a great career, a loving husband and child, and a
beautiful home, Marianne plans an affair with David (Krister
Henriksson), her director and close friend of the family.  Their fling,
set to take place over a three-week period in Paris, is supposed to be
temporary, with neither party having to worry about sneaking around or,
theoretically, jealousy.  Things don't go as planned, of course, and
their affair follows them home to Sweden, where Marianne's husband
Markus (Thomas Hanzon) finds out, kicking off a series of ugly events
and a bitter custody battle over little Isabelle (Michelle Gylemo).
As Marianne slowly reveals the story to the old man, he looks stunned
and appalled by the actions of his own creation.  But, like a shrink, he
continues to ask her questions in an attempt to get Marianne to finish
her tragic tale.  And her emotional account is far from predictable,
too, often causing the old man to seem on the brink of tears.
It should come as no surprise that Faithless was written by nine-time
Academy Award nominee Ingmar Bergman, who is certainly no stranger to
films showcasing the tragic failure of a marriage.  Bergman's long-time
collaborator Liv Ullmann (a double Oscar nominee for acting) directed
the mesmerizing film, which is full of wonderful performances from the
five main characters.  Erland Josephson, one of the original players
from Bergman's acting company, plays the old man  a role obviously
meant to be Bergman.  Ironically, Josephson has played several
Bergman-esque characters over the years.
2:35  adult language, nudity and strong sexual content
