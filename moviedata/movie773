Good documentaries aren't hard to find.  Great documentaries are few and
far between the cracks of cinematic achievements.
The new documentary The Filth and the Fury ranks as one of the great
ones.  It chronicles the rise and tragic fall of the infamous British
Punk band The Sex Pistols, and the cultural impact they have spread upon
the world around us.  Director Julian Temple takes the film far above
the usual VH-1 retrospectives, recounting past glories, drug parties,
and the way a musician found God in a motel in Alabama, thus bringing
together the catalytic elements that resulted in the musical movement
called `Punk.'  The Sex Pistols were the forefathers of that movement.
In the late seventies, Britain's social upheaval was severe.  A stagnant
economy, unemployment, race riots, looting, and strikes intersected with
a strong distaste for royalty and the upper class.  A working class
revolution was in the works.  Punk music was its Gabriel's Trumpet, and
the Pistols were blowing with all of their might.
With this backdrop, the film then beautifully intertwines social
commentary with television commercials of the time, footage of riots,
and various news reports.  The film then juxtaposes current and past
interviews with all five band members as well as home footage of the
bandmates' childhood (including a rare interview with Sid Vicious before
his death in 1978).  The intimacy of these interviews and the evidence
of the social strife validate the actions of the members of the Pistols
and really makes you feel what the band was trying to convey in the
words and rhythms of its music.
Julian Temple was also responsible for the first film concerning the
rise and fall of the Sex Pistols: The Great Rock and Roll Swindle.  That
film painted the Pistols as a brilliant marketing tool in the hands of
their manager, Malcolm MacLaren.  The Filth and the Fury sets the record
straight for the first time.  It gives great insight into the
motivations of the Pistols, but it also gives the uneducated a great
perspective on how the Punk movement began and how it all came hurtling
to a blind halt by commercialism, social pressure, and the fear of
individuality.

Rock 'n Roll is a musical canvas artists have used to express themselves for 
over half a century now. Since its inception it's always been considered a 
threat to the establishment and many musicians have come along and made good 
on that threat while others are just fronts for big-business record 
companies. In this age of glamor boy bands, sultry teenage girl singers and 
bubblegum pop that rivals the 1950s for sheer cheese value there's never been 
a more appropriate time for "The Filth And The Fury." This is a documentary 
about The Sex Pistols, one of the most controversial and shocking bands due 
to the fact they were absolutely 100 percent authentic in their rage against 
the machine. 
Most bands you hear today are just watered-down versions of a better artist 
that isn't in the limelight anymore. I've read about The Sex Pistols and 
heard of their outrageous behavior but I've never truly understood or 
appreciated how influential they've been on rock music for the past quarter 
century. If their story were told as fiction today it would probably be the 
most trite thing you could imagine. 
"The Filth And The Fury" lives up to its name right from the get-go. There's 
a considerable amount of time spent in depicting England in the mid-1970s 
which apparently was on the verge of a revolution, a civil war or just pure 
anarchy. We're shown real footage of news broadcasts of the time - of garbage 
piling up all over London due to a labor strike, of people rioting as if it 
were their full-time job and of the punk scene where the youth did everything 
and anything outrageous and rebellious to lash out against the system. Then 
along came The Sex Pistols, a rock band born and raised in these deplorable 
conditions that utterly symbolized the people's outrage. They weren't trying 
to be evil and shocking for kicks, this is really how they lived their life. 
The band consisted of four members; lead singer Johnny Rotten; bassist Glen 
Matlock; drummer Paul Cook and guitarist Steve Jones. Matlock later quit the 
band and was replaced by Sid Vicious. They dressed in ripped t-shirts, 
ripped leather held together by safetypins with dyed hair and sometimes 
adorned themselves with Swastikas. Their fans had even more outrageous hair 
designs and clothing, often looking like monster out of an Ed Wood movie. The 
music was probably the "hardest" rock of the day although by today's 
standards it's almost run-of-the-mill. What put it overboard was Rotten's 
lyrics and vocals - an all-out assault of outlandish behavior and 
anti-establishment messages that added up to a big middle finger to world (of 
course that gesture was employed a lot too). Their first gigs took place in 
the back of strip clubs and S&M shops, attracting the kind of people we'd 
think of as the most twisted and perverse. But it's not like they were out to 
make radio-friendly unit shifters and sell records. The band was each of the 
members' reason for living, otherwise they could just wallow their lives away 
like so many other people of the time. 
What's most interesting about this film is that it's the story of The Sex 
Pistols in pretty much their own words. There's present-day interviews with 
the band members individually (they still hold grudges against each other and 
their former managment). Each has his own chance to tell his perspective of a 
story or of an event - there's no neutral narrator. There's no interviews 
with musicians of today discussing the influence they had. About 95% of what 
appears on screen is original footage shot before, during and after their 
rise to fame. It's almost unbelievable how much was captured on film, so much 
so that you wonder if a lot of it is re-enactments because there's so much 
footage of such significance. 
Director Julien Temple and company keep the motif of the dark and dreary 70s 
rich and consistent. This is the REALLY ugly side of the 70s you never read 
about in history books or see in mainstream rock documentaries. The mood is 
so wholly "underground" that when stuff like the occasional S&M scene is 
throw in, or when psychedelic animation shows the band in a dream-like state, 
or we see real documentary footage of The Sex Pistols live shows and how 
insance their fans were it never seems out of the ordinary. This whole movie 
is practically one step away from being hardcore pornography or even an snuff 
film, the only difference is those vices come in the form of the Pistols' 
existence  - of being the most dangerous thing to the English empowerment at 
the time. 
I do have a few bones to pick, though. Firstly, the editing style is a bit 
strange, with constant cuts from footage of the Pistols performing live to 
backstage footage to newsreels to bizarre S&M and punk footage that has 
little to do with the band themselves. If Oliver Stone had this made this 
movie then I could understand it. Also, the modern-day interviews with the 
band are shot in shadows - why? Are they ashamed of themselves? It's probably 
meant to keep with the overall darkness of the film, but it seemed out of 
place to me. I didn't even enjoy the music that much, I find their sound 
bland and repetitive and Rotten's singing is grating and unmelodic. That's 
why these guys aren't recoginized so much as musicians as they are performers 
and revolutionaries (they only have one studio album). 
For the most part this is a pretty enjoyable film, certainly an educational 
one at the very least. "The Filth And The Fury" is a must-see to anyone whose 
ever thought ANY form of mainstream entertainment could be a public enemy. 
The Sex Pistols might not have changed the world for the better, or in any 
way at all, but the fact they shocked the establishment as much as they did 
and were persecuted for simply being themselves is scary.

Rated on a 4-star scale
Screening venue: Cornerhouse (Manchester)
Released in the UK by Film Four on May 26, 2000; certificate 15; 107 minutes; 
country of origin UK; aspect ratio 1.85:1
Directed by Julien Temple; produced by Anita Camarata, Amanda Temple.
Edited by Niven Howe.
A documentary with interviews of Paul Cook, Steve Jones, Johnny Lyden, Glen 
Matlock, Malcolm McLaren, Nancy Spungen and Sid Vicious.
No, I'm afraid Johnny Rotten is wrong: the Sex Pistols were not the first 
band to provide anthems for the young discontented. And their gigs were not 
the first opportunity for females to express individuality. But thank God 
they thought so, because their self-importance spurred them on, and as they 
became more extreme, they pissed off all the right people. It wasn't exactly 
a case of their lyrics exposing the depravity or hypocrisy of the British 
establishment; their outrageousness provoked it into exposing itself.
Consider: At one point during the group's short life, in the period of 
1977-78, one London city councillor was riled enough to declare that they 
would be "much improved by sudden death". When their controversial single 
"God Save the Queen" rose to Number One on the British charts, it was denied 
a listing, leaving the top spot blank. And who could forget their infamous 
live television appearance with Bill Grundy, where they exploited his 
drunkenness by slipping swear words into the conversation. Grundy, half 
asleep, thought he was having a calm chat; the audience was outraged. 
Julien Temple's "The Filth and the Fury" is a masterful new documentary about 
the fuss the Sex Pistols caused, which takes us through the above events and 
many more. It's one helluva colourful history. The title comes from one of a 
multitude of angry tabloid headlines, that sit in public record as a reminder 
of what a ridiculous fuss the reaction to the Pistols was. They of course 
found it delightful, because pushing the buttons of stuffed shirts gave them 
a thrill, and everyone who took a stern line on them ended up looking 
foolish. "The Filth and the Fury" shows this well. For anyone who thinks 
violent thoughts at the sight of Daily Mail reporters or conservative MPs, 
it's a movie that inspires applause, and giggles of subversive glee.
The story of the Pistols has been told in two previous feature-length 
documentaries, "The Great Rock and Rock 'n Roll Swindle" (1980) and "D.O.A." 
(1981). "Swindle" was reportedly manipulated into a piece of self-exaltation 
by the band's control-freak manager, Malcolm McLaren, and most critics 
rejected "D.O.A." as obvious junk. Since "The Filth and The Fury" has been 
made twenty years after the events it depicts, Temple, the director, has the 
benefit of hindsight, maturity, and access to a bigger collection of footage 
than ever before.
His film sets up a historical context for its tale, depicting the atmosphere 
of Britian in the 70s, when garbage piled up in central London, protests 
about everything dominated the news, the National Front gained support and 
wild fashions offered people an escape from reality. The Sex Pistols did not 
solve this with revolutionary profundity, but you have do give them credit 
for a dirty and aggressive form of artistic expression that was much more 
in-keeping with the spirit of the time than cheery disco music. Screaming 
about anarchy and wearing torn leathers simply made more sense than longing 
for "Night Fever" over a blow-drier.
Temple takes this idea too far when he cuts between the Pistols sizzling 
onstage and such images as the stand-up comedy of Ken Dodd and the 
over-the-top celebrations of the Queen's Silver Jubilee. He's trying to show 
how awesome the greatness of the band was against the cheesy culture of its 
time, but this is the one argument in the film that doesn't ring true, 
because we're never convinced that the excerpts we see are truly emblematic 
of that culture. Think about it -- you could take clips of a Peter Kaye 
routine and public grief over Princess Diana, and intercut them with a Blur 
performance of "Song 2". It wouldn't prove anything about the 90s.
This is a minor quibble, because the Sex Pistols' songs are strong enough to 
give power to the film without having to serve as a rebuttal for lesser art. 
Reviews shovelling the old cliché that you can enjoy the movie without being 
a fan seem to have been written by critics who either liked the music but 
felt silly afterward, or got a headache from the movie but didn't want to 
look square for denouncing it on that basis. "The Filth and the Fury" revels 
in Pistols iconography, and if you hate that, you'll hate the picture.
But I love the Sex Pistols -- their filth, their fury, their irony, energy, 
edge. And as long as viewers go without an aversion to the band, they should 
find "The Filth and the Fury" to be a work of greatness. The film mixes 
present-day interviews with archive footage shot on primitive videotape, but 
it's not like every other music documentary doing that -- the audio from the 
interviews is mostly overlayed over the old film clips, and so everything 
happens in our head, like a radio play. The few times the new interviews are 
shown onscreen, the faces are in silhouette, and the photographic style 
matches the grainy, pixelated stuff -- so we're never conscious of the film 
transitions, and the hypnotic spell is unbroken.

The punk rock group known as the Sex Pistols cared more about chaos than
their music, according to one of the many interviewees in Julien
Temple's documentary about their lives.  Called THE FILTH AND THE FURY,
the film has a highly limited appeal.  For fans of the group or of the
group's more outlandish members, like Sid Vicious and Johnny Rotten, the
movie will certainly be a must-see picture.  But for others, the movie
might better be thought of as THE OBNOXIOUS AND THE REPETITIVE.  A more
insightful film with a universal appeal, Doug Pray's HYPE! about
Seattle's grunge rock movement covers similarly outlandish groups but
does it with more insight and interest.
THE FILTH AND THE FURY starts off quite promisingly, crediting the
social unrest in Britain in the mid-1970s as the group's genesis.
Citing the misconception that "everyone" was on the dole, the story
suggests that the band was formed by working-class youths as a protest
against unemployment and conformity.  The latter has a wonderful irony
since soon everyone was wearing the same torn clothes to protest against
conformity.  With wonderful bits of archival film footage, this brief
segment is fascinating.
If painters can become famous by randomly throwing bits of paint at a
canvas, why shouldn't a band become a hit solely on the strength of
their foul behavior on the stage and in public?  Who cares what they
sound like?  People watch them, intrigued by what ridiculous thing they
will do next.  It's a formula that radio schlock jock Howard Stern has
used to great success.
The Sex Pistols spit on their fans, who can't get enough of the bad
boys' antics.  "Spit on us again; we love it," they appear to say.
After making these points and variations on them, the documentary gets
stuck like an old record player.  Running out of things to say, it
interviews the band members -- except for Sid, who died in a heroin
overdose -- again and again to get their opinions on the band and it's
popularity.   Their fans loved the band with their anti-establishment
rhetoric in songs such as "I Am An Anti-Christ" and "God Save The Queen:
She's No Human Being."  We get to see, or have to see, depending on your
point of view, lots of concert footage.
One of the band members best summed up their popularity.  The group was
"a bit like a Harold Pinter play," he explains.  "It shouldn't work, but
it did."
THE FILTH AND THE FURY runs 1:48.  It is rated R for pervasive strong
language, drugs and sexual content and would be acceptable only for high
school seniors and older.

In this documentary, music-video pioneer Julien Temple attempts
to set the record straight about the rise and fall of The Sex Pistols,
the world's most notorious punk-pop band. And obviously it's intended
to augment Temple's earlier documentary, "The Great Rock 'n' Roll
Swindle" (1980), which told how the Pistols were marketed by their
egomaniacal manager, huckster Malcolm McLaren. Unlike their more
famous British predecessors, the Beatles and the Stones, The Sex
Pistols didn't spring from any musical tradition. In fact, they
admittedly didn't know much about music at all, preferring to slam
stuff against their guitars and drums. And it was this obvious assault
that first appealed to frustrated fans in the '70s who also had no
obvious means of expression. England at that time was in the midst of
great social upheaval, suffering from a stagnant economy,
unemployment, and race riots. Against this backdrop of social strife,
the rise of punk anarchy and the impact of the Pistols seems
understandable, even though they recorded only one album: "Never Mind
the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols" (1977).  Julien Temple reveals
the men behind the infamy, interweaving BBC news briefs, cartoons,
commercials - even an interview with Sid Vicious before he died in
1978. One of the most memorable clips shows Johnny Rotten snarling,
"There is no future in England's dreaming. Don't be told what you
want. Don't be told what you need!" And there's narration by the four
remaining band members: vocalist John Lydon (a.k.a. Johnny Rotten),
guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook, and bassist Glen Matlock. On
the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The Filth and the Fury" is an
insightful 8. Filled with ferocious, primal power, it's one of the
best rock & roll documentaries.

     In a lifespan of just over 24 months, the Sex Pistols managed to
distill the entire history of rock and roll into one short-lived,
phenomenally influential experiment. There were internal disagreements and
lineup changes. There were distractions from meddling girlfriends and
drugs. There were legal and fiscal wranglings with a shady manager and
anxious record companies. There were cries of outrage from adults who just
didn't understand the rebellious messages of this new musical form,
accompanied by the certain knowledge that civilization as we knew it was
about to come to an end. And finally, there was the inevitable
transformation of rebellion and singularity into its own kind of
conformity. 
     Anyone at all familiar with the Pistols would hope to high heaven
that a film-maker wouldn't choose to tell their story in the measured
tones of hero worship. No such worries under the direction of Julien
Temple, who turns THE FILTH AND THE FURY into a multi-media Sex Pistols 
assault. Temple frames his archival footage of the band with modern day
interviews with the band's four original members -- vocalist John "Johnny
Rotten" Lydon, guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen
Matlock -- and a 1978 post break-up interview with replacement bassist
(and eventual heroin casualty) Sid Vicious. Their voices describe a band
born out of the social conditions of mid-1970s England, a music of furious
discontent that made the Sex Pistols as reviled by their critics as they
were adored by their fans. They also tell of the factions within the band
between those loyal to the Pistols' manager and self-described creator
Malcolm McLaren and those who distrusted his business dealings and staged
outrageousness.
     Many of the stories told in THE FILTH AND THE FURY are by now the
stuff of rock legend: the profane appearance on an English television
show; the performance of "God Save the Queen" on the Thames during the
celebration of Queen Elizabeth's silver anniversary jubilee; the
one-song-and-out final concert at San Francisco's Winterland in January
1978. Julien Temple has already documented the Sex Pistols in 1980's THE
GREAT ROCK 'N' ROLL SWINDLE, so there was the danger that THE FILTH AND
THE FURY would feel not just like a canonization of a pioneering band, but
a recycled canonization. Instead, Temple captures not just the energy of
the Pistols, but their satirical sense of playfulness as well. That
expletive-filled television interview is described as a drunken Steve
Jones having fun at the expense of the equally drunk host; jabs at
"progressive rock" contemporaries like Yes and Emerson, Lake and Palmer
are accompanied by footage of stop-motion dinosaurs. With music, animation
and dozens of archival clips, Temple compiles a film that doesn't merely
lay out a Sex Pistols chronology; it captures the atmosphere and the
attitude of anarchy in the U.K.
     That's not to say that it's instantly reliable as the definitive Sex
Pistols story. SWINDLE may have been an obvious attempt at
self-congratulation by McLaren, but THE FILTH AND THE FURY occasionally
seems just as much like an ego piece for Johnny Rotten. The present-day
interviews are conducted with the band members in shadow, an effective
means of keeping the story in the "present" of 1970s England. They also
allow Rotten in particular to "set the record straight" in a manner that
sounds theatrically performed every time he opens his mouth. Rotten may
very well be a more reliable historian of the Pistols than McLaren, but
when he and Jones relate differing accounts of a hotel room snafu, it's
hard not to here Rotten's version as a bit of overdramatization. Make no
mistake, it's still tremendously interesting listening to Rotten's
perspective on the rise and fall of the band. It's also a little hard to
take when he actually begins crying over the tragic end of his friend Sid
Vicious.
     That's actually a fairly minor quibble with a film as vital and
generally unpretentious as THE FILTH AND THE FURY (you don't get less
pretentious than Steve Jones' crudely honest reason for wanting to be in a
band). While Temple clearly appreciates the Sex Pistols as the defining
force in English punk -- including footage of youngsters Siouxsie Sioux,
Billy Idol and Pogues frontman Shane McGowan at concerts or singing
Pistols songs -- he also confronts the bands members' dissatisfaction with
how their legacy has been defined. Rotten in particular bemoans punk being
"absorbed back into the mainstream," with middle-class kids wearing
leather the real early English punks could never have afforded. He's also
surprisingly philosophical about the band's disintegration during its 1978
U.S. tour. "The Sex Pistols had to end when it did," Rotten opines, "but
it didn't have to end _how_ it did." Of course, he probably would be less
concerned with the philosophizing than pure sensory jolt, and that's
something THE FILTH AND THE FURY provides. It took the Sex Pistols two
years to distill rock and roll into every one of its basic elements. It
takes Julien Temple 108 minutes to do the same thing to the Sex Pistols. 
It's a story with the frantic, two-and-a-half-minute raw energy blast of a
classic punk anthem.

"The Filth and the Fury" is the third film about the Sex Pistols. Not
bad for a band that was barely together for two years and only recorded
one studio album. "The Sex Pistols had to end when it did," says
frontman John "Johnny Rotten" Lydon, "but it didn't have to end how it
did." He's right, of course, which is what makes this documentary so
fascinating.
The Sex Pistols came along at the perfect time. They weren't the first
punk band, or the best, but they were certainly the most explosive.
Relatively few people ever saw the group perform (they were banned in
Britain for a time and toured their homeland as SPOTS  Sex Pistols On
Tour Secretly), but their impact was immense. Even in America, where
they received scant attention from the general public, the band served
as an early warning to the purveyors of leaden '70s corporate rock that
change was on its way.
For years, Sex Pistol manager Malcolm McLaren has claimed that the group
was his creation, a sort-of punk rock version of the Monkees. Julien
Temple's crackling, multimedia documentary gives the surviving Sex
Pistols a chance to tell their side of the story. The truth probably
lies somewhere in-between McLaren's version and theirs, but that takes
nothing away from this rousing feature.
All of the most notorious moments from the Sex Pistols' rise and fall
are here: their headline-making, obscenity filled appearance on an
English talk show, their performance of the blissfully obnoxious "God
Save the Queen" on the river Thames during the celebration of Queen
Elizabeth's silver anniversary jubilee, even their abbreviated final
concert at San Francisco's Winterland in January 1978. The footage is
accompanied by recently recorded commentary from Lydon, guitarist Steve
Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock. Temple shows the men
only in silhouette, which helps to keep the focus of the production
squarely in the glory days. Doomed bassist Sid Vicious also appears, in
an interview shot a few months before his death from a heroin overdose.
Thankfully, Temple doesn't lionize the band. They appear as they were; a
group of immature boys who, while striking out blindly in all
directions, made one of the most vital, dynamic albums in the history of
rock and roll.
In addition to the expected music and mayhem, there are several
surprises, including the normally snotty Lydon showing actual human
feelings while discussing the death of Sid Vicious (of course, he could
be faking  with an attention whore like Lydon, you can never be sure).
The best scene has the Sex Pistols appearing at a benefit for the
children of striking firefighters. Watching the cheerful interactions
between the punks and the little ones is worth the price of admission
alone.

Julien Temple's second swing at documenting the rise and fall of British
punk purveyors The Sex Pistols is a home run deep into the center field
bleachers. Hell, The Filth & The Fury is one of those moon shots that's
still going up when you finally lose sight of it  a legendary rip that
actually knocks the cover off the ball, leaving the rawhide wrapping to
float gently back down into the hands of a lucky kid that, God willing,
will one day be inspired to radically overhaul the crappy state of music
today. We're about due for another sweeping change  there was a
twenty-two year gap between Bill Haley and the Comets `(We're Gonna)
Rock Around the Clock' and the Pistols `God Save the Queen (She Ain't No
Human Being).' And it's been another twenty-two since the Pistols' song
hit number one (or, as shown in Fury, since it didn't hit number one).
Don't tell me that it's `Boy Bands,' either, because I'll legally
acquire an automatic rifle and pepper MTV's Times Square studio with
enough metal to turn Carson Daly into the Tin Man, I swear to God.
See  just talking about The Sex Pistols gets people riled up. In a
music world that was populated by the likes of Kansas, The Eagles and
Roxy Music, the Sex Pistols burst onto London's music scene at a time
when the country was mired in garbage strikes, lethally high
unemployment and race riots. The economically drained blue-collar
workers had little else to do than hate the upper class and the Royal
family, especially when wealth was flaunted right in front of their
faces (like seeing the Queen riding around in a gold carriage during her
Silver Jubilee celebration).
Filth is the third documentary about the Pistols, but the first to
really tell their story. Temple's first attempt was 1980's The Great
Rock n' Roll Swindle (the second was a non-Temple film called D.O.A.).
When he began filming Swindle, Temple could never have predicted the
ending  the break-up of the band and the suicide of its enigmatic bass
player, Sid Vicious. Swindle told the story through maniacal manager
Malcolm McLaren's eyes (he even narrated the film). The film premiered
not long after Vicious' death, and the `swindle' in question, at least
according to McLaren, was the bilking of money by record companies, the
mindless youth of England and the actual members of the Pistols  all
from a craze that he pretty much implies that he started on his own.
In Filth (the film's title is taken from one of the many London tabloid
headlines about the Pistols), the story of the band's twenty-six-month
existence is told from the band's perspective. We learn about the
childhood of the band members - some things aren't surprising (broken
homes) and some are (Lydon was in a coma for a year). But it isn't long
before Johnny (Lydon) Rotten, Paul Cook, Steve Jones and Glen Matlock
form the Pistols, and the band took off like a depraved, spitting
rocket, triggering a London politician to say that the band would be
"much improved by sudden death.' Imagine Asa Hutchinson saying something
like that about Limp Bizkit.
Temple's film, while an amazing visual and aural assault, doesn't hit
you over the head with a bunch of silly messages that point out the
obvious. He lets you discover the irony of a band rallying against
conformity, but unwittingly launching a fashion trend where everyone
dressed in similar torn shirts and black leather jackets. He tosses in
animated clips of the band and British television comedies, as well as
snippets of Laurence Olivier playing Richard III. Temple also bathes the
surviving members of the Pistols in shadows during their interview
sessions. It looks like they're in the witness protection program, but
after a while, you don't even notice it. At least not until Rotten/Lydon
starts to get weepy when he talks about Vicious' death.  McLaren is
interviewed, too, but he's wearing a bondage mask. And the only thing
that they can all seem to agree on is that Sid's girlfriend, Nancy
Spungen, was the most despicable person on the face of the Earth (see if
you can watch her and not think about Courtney Love).
Fury also includes all of the famous Pistol-related incidents that many
of you may have only heard about or seen tiny portions of. There's the
Bill Grundy television interview, the Thames performance in honor of Her
Majesty's Silver Jubilee celebration, and the band's final concert,
which consisted of just one song. The film also includes a very touching
post-Pistol breakup interview with Vicious, as well as appearances by
future stars Billy Idol, Siouxsie Sioux and Shane McGowan.

"The Filth And The Fury" is director Julien Temple's uncompromising
chronicle of the notorious, short-lived, but incredibly influential punk
rock band, the Sex Pistols. Formed out of the social transformation and
unrest that characterised Britain in the 1970s, the Sex Pistols existed
for only about two years and released just one album in that time. They
were torn apart as much by inner strife and a propensity for 
self-destruction as by any external pressures. But they gave a voice, an
outlet to the chaos gripping the youth and the lower classes of the time,
and are still remembered as one of the most culturally important acts in
modern music history.
Much in the style of the Pistols themselves, "The Filth And The Fury" is a
frenzied, at times disorienting  piece of filmmaking. Temple eschews any
sort of clear-cut, linear history of the band in favour of something more
representative and anarchic. He skips from interview to interview, clip to
clip, event to event almost without warning. The faces and milestones do
not present themselves as distinct facts to be absorbed, but instead the
whole movie blurs into a surreal impression of those two heady years --
some good, a lot of bad, and a generous helping of weird.
Temple draws his material from a variety of sources. There are modern-day
interviews with the surviving Pistols: John Lydon, the erstwhile Johnny
Rotten; Paul Cook; Steve Jones; and original bassist Glen Matlock. All
four are filmed with severe backlighting, obscuring their faces, as if 
seeing the Sex Pistols in middle age would somehow diminish their 
mystique. There is also a 1978 interview with the late Sid Vicious, who 
replaced Matlock, recorded shortly after the Pistols broke up. Commentary
from the band's notorious manager, Malcolm McLaren, airs over scenes of a
man in bondage garb -- emblematic of McLaren's own fetishistic 
tendencies. Temple contrasts this with news reports of the time, cartoons
of the Pistols, and even clips from the Laurence Olivier version of
"Richard III".
Fortunately, "The Filth And The Fury" is not a fanboy's version of Pistol
history, but instead takes a seemingly honest and frank view of their time
on the stage. Witness, for example, Lydon's critique of his own lyrics for
"Anarchy In The UK", admitting to the terribly forced nature of the
central "anarchist"/"Antichrist" rhyme. Some events would appear almost
too ridiculous to be believed if they hadn't actually happened: A TV
interview in which the Sex Pistols taunt and swear at the host, who is as
inebriated as they are. The refusal of major music magazines to list "God
Save The Queen (She Ain't No Human Being)" as the UK's number one album,
resulting in a blank space at the top of the charts that week. The
Pistols'signing by a record label, only to be dropped twenty-four hours
later (the film keeps almost mirthful track of how much money the band
racks up thanks to their association with no less than three different
labels, although in reality it was McLaren who pocketed the vast
majority).
There is also little reticence in Temple's portrayal of the Sex Pistols'
final months: Of the conflicts between those who supported McLaren (Cook
and Jones) and those who wanted to oust him (Rotten and Vicious). Of the
ill-fated American tour which finally shattered the band once and for all
(culminating in a notorious one-song performance in which Rotten asked the
audience ironically, "Did you ever get the feeling you were being
cheated?"). And of Sid Vicious' relationship with the seemingly
universally-reviled Nancy Spungeon, which many believe contributed to his
debilitating drug addiction.
It is Vicious' story which is without doubt the most bizarre, even though 
he did not became a Sex Pistol until long after the group's formation.
Hired more for his looks than his dubious musical talent (Lydon notes that
sometimes they wouldn't even plug in Vicious' bass because he played it so
poorly), he became as synonymous with the Sex Pistols as Johnny Rotten. 
Soon, though, the combination of his newfound fame and his romance with
Spungeon led to a heroin habit, souring his relationship with his
bandmates (it is interesting to note that, despite the rebellious nature 
of the Sex Pistols, they are portrayed here as taking a dim view of hard
drugs). Months after the dissolution of the group, Spungeon was found
brutally murdered and Vicious was arrested for the crime. Before his guilt
or innocence could be established, Vicious himself would die of an
overdose. Those unfamiliar with the Sex Pistols may find the persistent 
references to Vicious at the start of the film somewhat confusing; their
patience pays off by the end, however, as Temple paints a dramatic
portrait of the man -- the "poor sod", Lydon mourns.
If "The Filth And The Fury" has a failing, it is that it satisfies itself
with chronicling only the years when the Sex Pistols were together,
neglecting the legacy the band left which would continue to be
influential long afterward. Temple seems to agree with Lydon's assertion
that the Sex Pistols "had to end when it did" ("but not how it did", he
continues) because they were starting to become as institutionalised as
the cultural sacred cows they were railing against -- inspiring fashion
trends, for example, an event which almost seems to mock the true,
destitute origins of the Pistols' ragged dress sense. But he does not
pursue this to its natural conclusion, by investigating how the Sex
Pistols would be perceived over the ensuing two decades.
The fundamental question of why the Sex Pistols are important, and why
they deserve to be documented in a movie like this, is never really
addressed. Whether this is because Temple assumes we already know the
answer, or whether he simply doesn't feel it's germane to his film, is
not clear. Nonetheless, "The Filth And The Fury" ends feeling incomplete
-- like a movie review with too much synopsis and not enough critique,
perhaps.

        In 1976, Britain's economy was struggling, thousands were without
jobs, and garbage was piling high in the streets.  It was time for a change.
        In "The Filth and the Fury," Julien Temple's second film about the
notorious punk rock band that changed the face of music and "waged war on
England without meaning to," the Sex Pistols reminisce about rising from
that landscape of despair and hopelessness.  "We literally dressed in
garbage (bags)" says lead singer John Lydon (aka Johnny Rotten).  "And when
your clothes are falling apart, what do you use to hold them together?
Safety pins."
        When the Sex Pistols snarled their way to the top of the British
music charts with their subversive, anti-establishment hit "God Save the
Queen," they did it even though the record was banned both from radio
airplay or being performed live.  The British have a pretty reliable track
record of banning just about anything that's a little bit off-the-wall, a
little bit off-color, or anything that points out the political hypocrisy
of the ruling classes.  "God Save the Queen" fit very nicely into all three
categories.
        I remember attending one of my first-ever teenage parties at which
a copy of "Never Mind the Bollocks... Here's the Sex Pistols" was passed
around, its garish pink, black, and yellow ransom-note titles jumping at
you right off the sleeve.  I remember listening to "Bodies" from that album
over and over, a signature tune of unwholesome nastiness with outrageous
lyrics ("She was a girl from Birmingham/she just had an abortion/she was
case of insanity/her name was Pauline, she lived in a tree").  I remember
the buzz in school the day after the infamous Bill Grundy interview, in
which the drunk talk show host goaded band members into using the F-word on
primetime television.
        But what I remember most about the Sex Pistols is their
music--driven, powerful, music that stayed with you.  And they always knew
how to end a song: cleanly, angrily, often with an exasperated expression
of disgust from Rotten.  In those days it seemed unique to listen to a
dozen tracks in a row without any fadeouts.  Ironically, "Never Mind the
Bollocks..." plays like a quintessential Greatest Hits compilation today
since it was the only LP the Sex Pistols produced during their
spectacularly short-lived, 26-month career.
        "The Filth and the Fury" (the title comes from a tabloid headline
decrying the Grundy business) tells the story from the Pistols' point of
view.  "It's to set the record straight," says Lydon, since Temple's other
Sex Pistol's film, 1979's "The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle," highlighted
the band's meteoric rise and fall from the viewpoint of their egomaniacal
manager, Malcolm McLaren.  McLaren, whose clothing store in London's King's
Road is where he first met drummer Paul Cook and guitarist Steve Jones,
always claimed the Sex Pistols as a product of his own making, but "The
Filth and the Fury" sees it differently.
        In silhouetted interviews (the film's only contrivance outside its
jocular opening credits), the four original band members recount their side
of the story: what they think of McLaren (not much), Sid Vicious' hooker
girlfriend Nancy Spungen (even less), and Sid himself, who replaced bass
player Glen Matlock in 1977.  Spungen was fatally stabbed in a hotel room
in 1978; Vicious himself died of a heroin overdose not long afterwards.
        Temple and his editor Niven Howie intercut these talking heads with
a kaleidoscopic frenzy of footage of the band in performance, culled from
many hours of heretofore unseen archival material--rehearsals, live gigs,
recording sessions, and promotional bits--as well as TV outtakes,
newsreels, and lots of clips of Laurence Olivier in "Richard III."  There's
a lot of music too, and it sounds as raw, urgent, and influential today as
it did way back then.
        If you see only one Sex Pistols movie this year, make sure it's
"The Filth and the Fury," as second time around Julien Temple gets it right.
