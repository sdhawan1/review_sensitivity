For screen adaptations of theater, there's always a notion that the
movie is simply a filmed play.  I have read a couple of the great
Tennessee Williams' plays and A Streetcar Named Desire is very similar
to the movie version.  The film, starring Vivien Leigh, Marlon Brando,
Kim Hunter, and Karl Malden in performances that have become touchstones
for powerful acting, is one of my favorite films of all-time and I,
naively, say that watching the film probably has its advantages over
watching the play version and vice versa.  With film there is a more
intimate feel what with close-ups and the ability to be a complete
perfectionist.  With theater you are able to see the play (and what a
play it is!) in all its glory with the spontaneity that theater allows.
I have never seen a stage production of Streetcar which, alongside the
work of Arthur Miller, must be the greatest American play written this
century.  Therefore, I cannot really judge if the movie is just a filmed
play.  However, regardless of ideas and opinions brought about by
nit-picking, A Streetcar Named Desire is one of the most powerful and
frightening films I've ever seen and, I am convinced, is a milestone in
the careers of every person involved.
The film version was directed by the incomparable Elia Kazan who also
directed the New York version of the play.  Most of the cast of the New
York stage version went on to star in the film except for Jessica
Tandy.  She was replaced by Vivien Leigh as Blanche DuBois, the famous
character that has been used ever since it was written as a test of an
actress' talent.  The film begins as Blanche searches for her sister,
Stella Kowalski's (Kim Hunter), house after having traveled from her
home in Laurel, Mississippi to New Orleans.  She is tired, worn.  She
discovers Stella in living conditions that appall her.  The home is a
two bedroom apartment and Stella shares it with her husband, Stanley
(Marlon Brando).
Throughout the film we see the tragic deterioration of Blanche.  When
she arrives in New Orleans on the streetcar Desire, she is already an
unstable, neurotic woman.  She frantically explains to her pregnant
sister that the family plantation back in Laurel, Belle Reve, was lost.
Stanley's suspicions (which he tries to justify by explaining New
Orleans' napoleonic code in which what belongs to the wife also belongs
to the husband) about Blanche push her to a mental breakdown.  After
much investigation, Stanley discovers that Blanche was forced out of
Laurel for having an affair with a student at her school and that she
brought her sexual "victims" to an infamous hotel named the Tarantula
Arms.
Blanche describes Stanley as common.  He is a violent, merciless
character who only aids in crumbling the self-esteem and sanity of
Blanche.  In one of the most famous scenes in history, Stella, after
being in a violent fight with Stanley, lustfully returns to him against
the advice of Blanche and friends.  "Hey, Stella!" Stanley screams.  He
is an animal with little remorse for his wrong-doing.
When Blanche has seemingly found love with Stanley's poker buddy Mitch
(Karl Malden), Stanley seems determined to keep the two apart, divulging
horrific information to Mitch incriminating Blanche and her murky past.
The romance is tested to the breaking point and so is Blanche who, by
the endless and brutal manipulation of Stanley, is becoming more and
more disillusioned and sick everyday.
We also learn about a mysterious deceased husband of Blanche whom she
claims she killed with her disapproval of him.  The play alludes to the
fact that Blanche's husband was gay and that she was a nymphomaniac, but
the movie never even skims the surface of such allusions.  This is
because of the constraints built by the Legion of Decency who censored
Streetcar before its release.  Despite the meddling of this awful
organization, Streetcar is chilling and potent.  Elia Kazan
intelligently interprets Tennessee Williams' screenplay and works to
bring out the best in all those involved with the movie even with the
barriers the Legion thrust upon Hollywood films in the Â‘50s.
Vivien Leigh's portrayal of the legendary Blanche DuBois is captivating
and stunning and has become one of the great female motion picture
performances of all time.  Likewise, Marlon Brando's fierce performance
as Stanley Kowalski has become one of the most admired pieces of film
acting ever.  Kim Hunter and Karl Malden's performances have not,
despite much praise, gotten the overwhelming attention Leigh and Brando
have gotten.  I think Hunter's performance as the lust-ridden Stella
Kowalski is one of the best supporting performances I have ever seen and
Karl Malden is, as always, perfection.  With A Streetcar Named Desire,
Hollywood entered a new realm of acting, a world of method acting that
brought more to the portrayed characters, thereby improving the film.
A Streetcar Named Desire has remained undated and painfully emotional,
even with the decades that have gone by and the Legion's mutilation.  It
is about the disintegration of the human spirit and of humanity itself.
Blanche never loses her humanity but her spirit is trampled on again and
again. Stanley is one of the most monstrous creatures I've seen on film;
he has no humanity.  The story tells of lust (Blanche's seeming sexual
lust and her lust for anything but the pain of realism; Stella's pursuit
of a life away from the barbaric Stanley which is marred by her unending
lust for him), violence, inhumanity, and complete darkness and sadness.
"I don't want realism, I want magic," Blanche cries after a violent
encounter with Mitch.  This scream basically sums up what everyone seems
to be looking for: magic.  Reality is not always pretty.  Regardless of
whether the play or movie version is better, A Streetcar Named Desire
has become one of the most compelling stories of cinema.  I watched
Blanche DuBois for the sixth time last night as she rapidly dissolved in
a world of her own pretentious magic, her shield, and I was, again,
shattered.

People, as well as institutions, often become victims of
their own triumphs. World of cinema doesn't lack such
examples. Many artists suffer because the rest of their,
otherwise good, career gets unfairly compared with their
single and often accidental masterpiece. Great movies often
get so praised only to have their reputation declining when
they fail to meet big expectations created by overzealous
critics and film scholars. In may ways, this phenomenon
occurred with A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, powerful
"Oscar"-awarded 1951 drama, directed by Elia Kazan. Half a
century after its premiere the original power of the film
declined, being diluted with numerous parodies and homages
(the latest being Almodovar's TODO SOBRE MI MADRE), and many
talents associated with this film slid into relative
obscurity, not being able to repeat its success.
The film is an adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize winning 1947
stage play by Tennessee Williams. Plot is set in the French
Quarter of New Orleans where Blanche DuBois (played by
Vivien Leigh), small time schoolteacher and daughter of once
wealthy land-owning family from Mississippi, comes to calm
her nerves, stressed after the loss of family property. At
least, this is the story told to her sister Stella (played
by Kim Hunter) who seems to be happily married to Stanley
Kowalski (played by Marlon Brando) brutish, uneducated
working class Polish American. Blanche, posing as refined
aristocrat, simply can't stand ape-like Stanley who, in
return, can't stand ageing southern beauty that brought
discomfort to his harmonious marriage. Friction between the
two rises as times go by, and intensifies with Stella's
pregnancy, Blanche's seduction of Stanley's shy and
mild-mannered best friend Harold "Mitch" Mitchell (played by
Karl Malden). When Stanley discovers some unflattering
details of Blanche's past the conflict would reach its
violent climax.
A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE is often viewed as one of the most
important milestones in the history of American cinema.
Based on the powerful play, but also a very controversial in
its time, this film introduced some topics that used to be
taboo in Old Hollywood - female sexuality, nymphomania,
domestic violence and, finally, rape. Even after being
thoroughly reviewed by censors (who did everything to tame
the raw and shocking original, including removal of all
references to homosexuality), A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE was a
film quite shocking for its time. Director Elia Kazan, known
for the groundbreaking character of his socially conscious
films like GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT, also used this film as an
opportunity to comment on the social conflicts in post-WW2
America, when the romantic visions of American rural and
WASPish past clashed with down-to-earth reality of
industrial, urbanised and multicultural present.
This film wasn't groundbreaking just in the reality it
presented; it was also groundbreaking in the way it
presented such reality. Kazan was fortunate to master the
play on the stage and twice fortunate to bring most of the
original stage cast for the film adaptation. Among them
excelled the actors who had embraced the new Method style of
acting, so popularised by Kazan in his films. The best known
was, of course, Marlon Brando. When we look into his first
major film role, the intensity of emotions displayed and raw
strength of performance seems earth shattering in comparison
with everything Hollywood had to offer before. For the newer
generations, A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE is an excellent
opportunity to see young Brando, quite different from the
roles he played in last few decades. His role of Stanley
Kowalski was for many years considered the best in his
entire career, until, of course, Don Vito Corleone in
Coppola's GODFATHER changed all parameters. In this film
Brando doesn't just show a very complex character; he also
revolutionises the way male sexuality is displayed on
screen. His biceps's, lustful looks and tendency to have
bare chests explain why Brando happened to be one of the
first major female heartthrobs of 1950s America - something
almost inconceivable today, when we picture as nothing more
than overweight eccentric caricature of himself. Brando was
also fortunate to have some of his stage partners back on
screen. Kim Hunter is marvel to watch, as a woman caught
between conflicting loyalties, troubled by her social
obligations and obvious and very primordial lust she feels
for her husband. Unfortunately, she didn't manage to build
equally impressive career on her "Oscar"-awarded triumph.
Karl Malden, another member of the original cast, again
proves his excellent qualities of character actor in the
role in the role of deceived, shy but still most likeable
character; his performance was also awarded with "Oscar".
But the most memorable (and most parodied) performance of
them all belongs to Vivien Leigh. Her role of Blanche
dubious was often portrayed as a parody itself; the
character of aristocratic Southern belle strikes certain
resemblance to Vivien's Leigh best known incarnation in GONE
WITH THE WIND. But this resemblance are only superficial -
Blanche DuBois is much more complex, troubled and fragile,
and her once all-conquering beauty and irresistible charm is
rapidly becoming the thing of a past. Leigh made a terrific
job of detailing her gradual, but inevitable decline into
madness. This "Oscar"-awarded performance becomes even more
devastatingly powerful when we take into account that the
real life of an Vivien Leigh in later years in many ways
resembled the life of the character.
Thanks to the excellent text and superb actors, Kazan
managed to create a very good film, but he still failed to
turn it into genuine and everlasting masterpiece. Kazan
worked very hard to improve the stage production with the
benefits of the new medium, but A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE
still looks less like an original film, and more like a
stage play adapted for screen. Almost entire film takes
place in very limited space, and the scenes that show the
outside seem to come out of the picture. With a film almost
exclusively concentrated on the four major characters,
anyone else is distracting, even the boy whose brief
appearance would trigger some well-hidden impulses in
Blanche. The musical soundtrack by Alex North, although
revolutionary for Hollywood through its use of jazz, isn't
particularly impressive. Finally, modern day viewers simply
couldn't avoid noticing some rather awkward treatment of
some grim subjects due to the different censorship
standards. A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE is nevertheless still
essential film for anyone who wants to be familiarised with
20th Century cinema.

One problem common to most plays that have been adapted for
the movies is that there's too much dialogue, and not
enough action.  Scenes of two people talking (or, more
likely, one person mostly talking and one person mostly
listening) seem to stretch on and on.  Of course, if the
script is good enough, all is forgiven.
Although "A Streetcar Named Desire" received an Oscar
nomination for Best Screenplay, the script, based on the
Tennessee Williams' play, is not strong enough to fully
overcome the stagy nature of the film.  The character of
Blanche (Vivien Leigh) in particular is burdened with
rambling speeches, which she must deliver in her affected
whisper.
"A Streetcar Named Desire" has aging beauty Blanche forced
to leave her hometown, as the family estate has been lost,
and her scandalous behaviour has made her not welcome.
She moves in with sister Stella (Kim Hunter) in New Orleans,
who lives with brutish husband Stanley (Marlon Brando).
There, the emotionally fragile Blanche spins lies to cover
her scandals, and to further a romance with lonely Mitch
(Karl Malden).  As her true past comes out, Blanche becomes
the only person to believe her lies.
The film caused a sensation, as did the play.  Brando,
who received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, has
the most controversial role, a swaggering, bullying
blue-collar character.  Both Malden and Brando make
sexual advances on Blanche, with wild gleams in their
eyes.  Blanche is pitied by other women, but is a
subject of derision for men.
I have not seen any of Williams' plays, but several
of his screen adaptions.  From what I have seen, he
appears to be over-rated as a playwright, drawing
excessive publicity through the use of controversial
and sexual themes.
"A Streetcar Named Desire" is a very good film
despite its problems.  The cast is excellent, and
the characters are sharply defined.  The cast
was mostly taken from the successful Broadway
play, with Leigh substituting for Jessica Tandy
as Blanche.  Leigh is so convincing that she has
been identified with the role, her second most
famous after Scarlett in "Gone With the Wind".
It is ironic that her later years are said to
resemble Blanche's character in some ways.
"A Streetcar Named Desire" won Oscars for Best
Actress (Leigh), Best Supporting Actor (Malden),
Best Supporting Actress (Hunter) and for the
sets.  It was also nominated for Best Picture,
Best Director (Elia Kazan) and Best Cinematography.
But despite its critical success, the film is
somewhat over-rated, while more deserving
Kazan efforts such as "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"
and "America, America" are comparitively obscure.
