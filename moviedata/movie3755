Most people have never heard of Jack Elliott, and the few who have
probably don't know much about him.  An intriguing new documentary
called The Ballad of Ramblin' Jack does a fine job telling Elliott's
story to its viewers, but the person who learns the most about him is
the film's director  who just happens to be Ramblin' Jack's daughter.
Ramblin' Jack portrays Elliott as a disorganized, irresponsible man with
no parental skills.  Daughter/director Aiyana Elliott grew up with her
mom, while her dad was constantly on the road.  You might get the
impression that she's only making this film to finally spend some
quality time with her father, and parts of Ramblin' Jack play remarkably
similar to the scenes in Almost Famous where young William Miller tries
to get Stillwater's enigmatic guitarist Russell Hammond to sit down for
an interview.  Elliott is just as evasive, always finding something to
distract him from Aiyana's questions about the past.
In addition to being a neglectful dad, Elliott also happens to be a
living folk legend.  A protégé of Woody Guthrie, Elliott was an
extremely fast flat-picker who began performing in New York's Washington
Square Park and, ultimately, influenced the likes of Paul McCartney,
Mick Jagger and Bob Dylan.  In fact, Dylan was often criticized for
sounding too much like Elliott, and his early shows were billed as The
Son of Jack Elliott.
Elliott looks, sounds and acts like a tough, dusty cowboy who could herd
cattle in his sleep, so finding out that Elliott is the son of a Jewish
doctor from Brooklyn is kind of like realizing that the imported lager
you're drinking was bottled in New Jersey.  Born Elliott Adnopoz in
1931, Elliott never thought about following in his pop's footsteps,
instead falling in love with The Grand Ole Opry radio program.  When
Gene Autry's rodeo came to Madison Square Garden, Elliott found his true
calling.  He ran away from home at 16 to join a rodeo, where he learned
to play the guitar from a rodeo clown.
Finding limited success musically in the U.S., Elliott took off for
England  a country in the midst of a folk craze populated by marginally
talented `skiffle' bands.  Elliott's authentic brand of down-home folk
tunes from America's heartland took England by storm, and he sold out
shows and recorded several popular albums there.  Six years later,
Elliott came back to the States as somewhat of a mysterious legend. Fans
had heard his albums and knew that he was a close friend of Woody, but
they had never seen the cowboy in action.
Ramblin' Jack is really two films  one a straight documentary about a
crucial link in American folk music history, and the other a painfully
unflinching look at the dysfunctional relationship between a father and
his daughter.  As a result, the film runs a little long, and may quickly
lose the interest of viewers who aren't folk fans.  It's a very
interesting look at the life of a very interesting figure.
The film, which won awards at the Sundance and San Francisco Film
Festivals, is cobbled together from two years of recent footage from
Elliott's seemingly endless cross-country touring and vintage
performances from the 60s and 70s (including a 1969 appearance on the
Johnny Cash Show that took place two weeks before Aiyana was born), as
well as an incredibly impressive amount of home movie footage - not just
from Aiyana's youth, but Jack's, too.  There are also numerous
interviews with family members (including two ex-wives), friends and
folk icons like Pete Seeger, Arlo Guthrie and Kris Kristofferson.

Locally, THE BALLAD OF RAMBLIN' JACK has been attracting some of the 
biggest audiences that I've ever seen for a documentary.  (Yes, I'm 
excluding THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, which isn't a documentary no matter 
what its fans want to believe.)  Why this documentary is so popular, 
while many much better ones haven't been as well attended, is a bit of a 
mystery.  But as one whose favorite film genre is documentaries, I'm 
pleased.  For the record, 35 UP was my favorite film of the past decade, 
and HOOP DREAMS was close behind.
THE BALLAD OF RAMBLIN' JACK takes a traditional approach of using 
talking heads and old film footage to tell the story of Ramblin' Jack, 
a.k.a., Jack Elliott.  A folk singer whose claim to fame was more his 
connections than his music, Jack hung out and played with just about 
every popular folk singer that you can think of.  Personally, I found 
Jack's singing abilities to be -- well -- passable.  Even one of his own 
relatives says that he should have taken singing lessons.
The documentary, which was made by Jack's daughter Aiyana Elliott, seems 
as much a way for her to attempt to establish communications with her 
aloof father as it is a musical autobiography.  She and her mother 
complain about how Jack would show up a week late without even calling, 
claiming that he was too busy to telephone.  "Did Jack have any talents 
as a father?" Aiyana asks her mother.  The question sends her mother 
into a bout of snickers since she has no answer.  Finally, she admits 
that he had none but claims he was, nevertheless, a positive influence.
THE BALLAD OF RAMBLIN' JACK feels less like a motion picture than the 
Elliott's home movies as narrated by the daughter.  I can recall few 
documentaries in which the director talked so much.  If her insights 
were more significant, her domination of her movie would have been 
easier to overlook.  To further compound the problem, Aiyana isn't a 
particularly skillful interviewer, with the result that her talking 
heads from Arlo Guthrie to Pete Seeger don't have many memorable things 
to say about their old friend Jack.  
Good documentaries can transcend their subject material to make the 
seemingly uninteresting fascinating.  Errol Morris's mesmerizing MR. 
DEATH about an electric chair designer was the best recent example of 
this.  Aiyana Elliott is an effective collector of material and a good 
music historian, but her skills as a filmmaker aren't what they should 
be.
This music documentary must then rise or fall solely on its music 
footage.  Some of it is quite good, but the director keeps cutting away.  
Rather than hearing entire songs, she wants us to listen instead to yet 
another talking head reminisce about her father.
Which leads me to a conclusion similar to my advice about BITTERSWEET 
MOTEL, a much inferior music documentary about the rock band Phish.  THE 
BALLAD OF RAMBLIN' JACK is for folk fans only.
THE BALLAD OF RAMBLIN' JACK runs 1:52.  It is not rated but would be a G 
since it contains nothing to offend anyone of any age.

   Sometimes a movie is not what you expect it to be,
embracing ultimately a deeper theme than the obvious one. 
A recent example is "Frequency," billed as a sci-fi feature
dealing with a man's reaching back thirty years into the past
via a ham radio he discovers gathering dust in the closet. 
"Frequency" is, to be sure, a science fiction picture about
time travel but its real aim is to pay homage to the love
between a father and his son.  Now, "The Ballad of Ramblin'
Jack," a documentary that was awarded a Special Jury Prize
at the Sundance Festival this year, is about a major American
folk singer who could not abide the New York City of his birth
but preferred the wide open spaces of the West and South. 
But its real subject is the relationship of a father and his
daughter, the latter appearing behind the camera as the
director who, unseen, is interviewing her dad but has never
been able to know the man.  Do we get to know Jack Elliott
more after seeing this movie?  You bet.  Does his daughter? 
Ironically, no, at least not in the way she has spent her life
trying to understand him.  If you keep this point in mind while
you watch the movie, you'll be rewarded with just a little extra
appreciation for its considerable merits.
   Edited down from 200 hours of film, largely family archival
material taken on Super 8, 16mm and digital video and
transferred digitally to 35mm, "The Ballad of Ramblin' Jack"
takes us into the vivid and colorful world of its title character
who was born Elliott Adnopoz in 1931, the son of a Jewish
doctor on Brooklyn's Linden Boulevard.  Not content with the
insular style of that Flatbush area, he joined a rodeo.  We
watch him busting broncos at several points in the film, his
love for horses and a world that lay beyond the Eastern
seaboard never leaving him for an instant.  
   Given his frequent travels to the South and West, we don't
wonder that his marriages did not last, only that he felt the
itch to tie the knot at all--which he did four times in his sixty-
eight years.  Daughter Aiyana Elliott, who co-wrote the
screenplay in addition to directing this docu feature, shows
his departure by boat for Europe in 1955 with his first wife,
June Shelley, and takes us to the concert stages of the
Continent where Elliott's American music is in demand. 
Elliott, who talks in such a non-stop manner that interviewee
Kris Kristofferson half-jokingly guesses that the nickname
came not from Elliott's travels but from his rambling
conversations, is nothing if not opinionated.  Casting
dispersions on the heavy um-pah music of Germany and the
silly romantic tradition of French song, he praises the
wonderful Flamenco that he heard in Spain while always
venerating American traditional song above all.
   Despite the wealth of material from which Aiyana Elliott
could have drawn, she spends most of her time focussing on
her modern-day sexagenarian father, which is understandable
given her obsession with finally learning more about him than
she had ever been able to.  But now that he is in his late
sixties his voice is raspy, a plus, I suppose, for those who
take folk seriously enough to think that scratchy means
"authentic," but for my folk song dollar I'd have appreciated
more songs from his concerts in and about the year 1961 and
fewer interruptions of those songs.  I'd have cut some of the
talking heads in favor of more footage showing us not what
kind of person Jack really is.  Rather I'd want to know what
there is about his music that made him relatively
unappreciated throughout his life only to gain his principal
recognition in taking a Grammy in 1995 and receiving the
National Medal of the Arts from President Clinton in 1998 for
a lifetime of melodic achievement.
  The picture just might make those who are under forty
years of age and who have been brought up on acid rock,
heavy metal and the like wonder what the folks saw in
traditional American ballads during the stodgy fifties and the
transitional early sixties.  Older people, especially those who
did the Greenwich Village circuit of the Bitter End and
Gerde's Folk City and especially hung out in Washington
Square park on warm Sunday afternoons, know exactly the
appeal of this gentle, down-home form that ultimately became
lost in the commercializations of the Kingston Trio  only to
disappear with the advent of rock music.  It's good to see the
old guys back on screen again, folks like Izzy Young, Pete
Seeger, Arlo Guthrie, Odetta and Woodie Guthrie himself, in
some cases picking away at their banjos and guitars and in
other instances just rapping about the good times before the
music died.
Not Rated.  Running time: 112 minutes.  (C) 2000 by

 BALLAD OF RAMBLIN' JACK, THE (director/writer/cinematographer: Aiyanna
 Elliott; editor: Susan Littenberg; cast: Jack Elliott, Dave Van Ronk,
 Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, Dave Van Ronk, June Shelley,
 Odetta; Runtime: 110; WinStar Home Video; 2000)
This wonderful documentary on the life of Ramblin' Jack Elliott won the
Special Jury Award for Artistic Achievement at the 2000 Sundance Film
Festival. It is filmed by the 30ish Aiyanna Elliott, daughter of
Elliott's by the fourth wife, as she tries to connect with her errant
father. He's a father she never really knew and rarely ever saw. The
film's other aim is a loving tribute to his musical accomplishments and
his troubadour lifestyle of never settling down. His importance to the
music world is as the link between Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan. He was
Guthrie's hand-picked protégé, learned from the master first-hand,
having lived with him in Brooklyn and was at his bedside during his
illness. He sang his songs in the Greenwich Village folk revival in
1961, and his country nasal style of singing was imitated by Dylan who
later on ignored Jack (this upset Jack's friends more than it did him,
until he was snubbed at the tribute for Woody and Dylan was the
headliner).
The film is enriched by extensive use of archival footage from as far
back as the 1930s, the film traces Jack's restless childhood in a
middle-class Jewish family. He was born in NYC in 1931 with the name
Elliot Adnopoz. His father was a medical doctor and expected Jack to
follow suit. His mother Flossie was an elementary school teacher and was
according to her elderly sister an overbearing person and not very
likable, who expected her son to live a conventional life. But this was
not to be, at age 15 Jack ran away from his private house in NYC and
joined the rodeo. There he learned how to be a cowboy and play the
guitar. His life's passion was to be a singing cowboy, and though he
returned to NYC (a place he hated) to finish high school he transformed
himself into a cowboy. Aware that legendary folk singer Woody Guthrie
was living in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn, he gave him a call
one day and got invited to stay with him. He learned Woody's songs,
lived the ramblin' trip instead of just talking about it, and made
himself into a folk singing legend. But he never attained mainstream
popularity, prevented from doing so by his irresponsible and ramblin'
ways. His highmark in popularity came in 1969 when he appeared with
Johnny Cash in Nashville. During the 1970s he went into the tank, hurt
by his use of drugs. But he reemerged in the 1990s and continued
traveling and playing the guitar. In 1995 he hit it big-time with a
traditional folk album that won him national recognition at last, as he
won a Grammy. In 1998, President Clinton honored him by presenting him
with the National Medal of the Arts prize.
In 1955 he left his road travels in the States and spent 6 years playing
in London and touring Europe; he married the first of his wives, June
Shelley; but, because he lived life from moment to moment in a
disorganized fashion she would divorce him to live in a kibbutz in
Israel. He would return from London as a legend in 1961 to play to
packed crowds in Greenwich Village for the new folk music's trendy spot,
Gerde's Folk City. There he dressed cowboy style in a Stetson and boots
and jeans, looking out at the crowd through wire-rimmed glasses, picking
and yodeling his "traditional folk music." He's a jokester loving what
he was doing with a passion as he sang in a high reedy voice. By living
his life the way he wanted to and never being a planner or ambitious, he
caught the idiom of authentic American folk songs like few others have.
As folk singer Dave Van Ronk perceptively says, it's the music world's
gain he lived such a reckless life; that if he settled down and became a
family man he might have been happier but he wouldn't have been Ramblin'
Jack Eliott.
The film captures the spirit of Jack, as it wanders around to different
points of his life in a scattered order and has the cozy look of a
home-movie. The filmmaker, meanwhile, still does not know her father.
When he takes her on a drive in Mendocino to visit "the house where he
says we came closest to being a family" and he still can't find the
house, it is then that Aiyanna realizes how ill prepared her father was
to be a family man. She says out of frustration, she can't keep him
focused to talk about what she wants to know. She complains: "The thing
is, I can't remember having an actual conversation with my dad." Arlo
Guthrie (Woody's son) tells her, not to sweat it, that she never will
know her father. He should know, he was in the same situation.

One of the biggest surprises at the Sundance Film Festival was debut
filmmaker Aiyana Elliott's documentary portrait of her cantankerous folk
singer dad, The Ballad of Ramblin' Jack. It was curious to see how well
the audience responded to this deeply personal, lyrical film of lonesome
highways and tough talking cowboys.
Aiyana Elliott previously made an impression on the festival circuit
with her ferocious short, Tough, which offered a strong visual
sensibility influenced by the washed out look of the golden era of '70s
filmmaking. She knew how to truthfully portray a modern dysfunctional
family, with naturalistic performances and startlingly honest dialogue,
a unit whose means of communication is handled through shouting. It's
not surprising to see that these themes continue in her current feature.
If Ms. Elliott's documentary fares less well, it's perhaps because her
instincts are stronger as a narrative filmmaker with control over the
subject matter and, perhaps, autobiographical implications. The fact is,
her dad doesn't really like to talk about herself. He flagrantly shows
his lack of connection and wary affection. At nearly two hours, the film
is too long, and Jack Elliott rambles and evades to the point where we
genuinely "get it" after an hour or so. From then on, The Ballad of
Ramblin' Jack seems redundant.
Aiyana Elliott makes herself a character in the film, along for the ride
during a Midwest tour and chronicling her daddy's life on the way.
Ramblin' Jack was a big folk singer I'd never heard of. Bob Dylan was
his pupil, and he was apparently a huge influence on the Rolling Stones,
Dylan and other rock/folk performers.  Kris Kristofferson and Arlo
Guthrie are among the celebrities waxing philosophical about Ramblin'
jack, usually saying that they never saw someone speak so well about
absolutely worthless horseshit.
There's a personal history unfolding, breaking through the '50s into the
beatnik era and the swinging '60s, to the trippy '70s style which
influences the entire movie.  Aiyana Elliott tries to get sun flare in
almost every shot which tracks down the desolate patches of road and
field in the heartland of America.
The interviews have a range from the honest to the superficial, which
you'll find in many documentaries. When people try to get into the depth
of Jack's persona or personality, it feels pretty thin and rote. Still,
Aiyana Elliott is able to capture the gravity of silences, when people
aren't sure what to say. There's a brilliant sequence where she asks her
mom how good of a husband and father he was, and she can't answer for a
good minute, trying to control her fits of laughter.
There's a wonderful, definitive moment where Aiyana and her dad are
driving around trying to find the first house she lived in. It's
important for her, a touch of personal nostalgia, and he can't find it.
He finally gives up after having promised her to track it down. He's a
pill, even a bit of a prick. Boy, does he annoy Aiyana onscreen, but the
moment plays out sad and funny.
That's the tone of The Ballad of Ramblin' Jack, which earns the moment
where Jack sings a lonely tune for his daughter at the last concert.
He's too mean to be sentimental, but the heartstrings get tugged
nonetheless.
