     Just watched the new Laserdisc version celebrating the 20th
anniversery of JAWS - the film that started the summer blockbuster
craze. The LD contains a 2+ hour documentary on the making of the film,
plus hundreds of still photos and promotional trailers. The film is in
wide screen and THX enhanced. The quality is superb.
     It's easy for people to dismiss JAWS, now that years have passed
and the inevitable sequels have somewhat tarnished the JAWS name.
Watching this film, however, I am awed at what great filmmaking this
is. Sure, it is not exactly "deep", but that's beside the point; JAWS
is pure escapist/ adventure filmmaking, and it is that genre at it's
absolute best.
      The pacing of the film is perfect; there is no fat needing to be
trimmed. All scenes either advance the story or develop character. And
the characterization in JAWS may very well be what seperates it from
other action films. These are no cardboard characters, but real people
you care about and root for. All three principle performances (by Roy
Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and the late Robert Shaw) perfectly
compliment the action. Shaws' recollection of the Indianapolis tale (in
which a WWII ship sank and nearly all its' crew was devoured by sharks)
is an astounding scene; it is so flawlessy acted and developed that you
forget you are watching an adventure/suspense film.
      Steven Spielberg was a 27 year old unknown when he began filming
JAWS.  The film went over 100 days over schedule and doubled its
original budget. Spielberg came very close to being fired on more than
one occasion. In hindsight, it is amazing that Spielberg was able to
get the film made at all. That he made a terrific film is nearly
unbelieveable.  But he did.
      Sit back and watch JAWS again, and take in all its pleasures. The
final 40 minutes, when the three men head out to sea to confront the
great shark, is the best action/adventure/suspense filmmaking you may
ever encounter. See how seamless the Oscar-winning editing is.  Marval
at the atmosphere Spielberg and John Williams' classic, Oscar-winning
score create. Root for the three heroes in the ultimate confrontation
between man and beast. See Scheider find redemption, Dreyfuss get
humbled and Shaw meet his fate. And remember, just because the film
became part of our popular culture doesn't lessen what a cinematic
achievement it was.

Dickie Goodman had a top five novelty hit, "Mr. Jaws",
which mixed his rapid-fire mock interviews with answers
that were snipped from contemporary hit singles.
It began something like this...
Announcer: "We are here on the beach, where a giant shark
has just eaten a girl swimmer.  Mr. Jaws, how was it?"
Announcer: "And what did she say when you grabbed her?"
I excerpt "Mr. Jaws", not only because it was a great
novelty record, but because it demonstrates the cultural
impact of "Jaws".  It became the biggest grossing film
of all time, eclipsing "The Godfather", and subsequently
eclipsed by "Star Wars".  Also making the top 40 was
the theme from "Jaws", an imposing classical score by
John Williams that succeeds in recreating the suspense
of a shark closing in on its prey.
"Jaws" is one of the best horror films of all time.
Most of the film is consumed by Chief Brody (Roy Scheider),
his humdrum family life, his conflicts with the Mayor
(Murray Hamilton) and his male bonding with shark hunters
Quint (Robert Shaw) and Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss).
But the film still has similarities to slasher films,
with the aquatic version of Freddy Krueger scoring
five victims in gruesome fashion.
What separates "Jaws" from its landlubber successors
(the currently-playing version is "I Still Know What You
Did Last Summer") is that the monster is more credible,
the victims are not limited to comely teenagers, the script
(based on Peter Benchley's bestselling potboiler, the
screenplay co-written by Benchley and Carl Gottlieb) is
much better, and Director Steven Spielberg is much more
skilled at making horror suspense not seem like bad
horror comedy.  Of course, the cast is better as well.
Scheider skillfully underplays, allowing scenes to be
stolen by excitable Dreyfuss and salty Shaw.  Hamilton
also gives a great supporting performance.  His character
is in denial, hoping that the shark will just go away
so that the tourists will return.
"Jaws" was plagued by production problems.  The mechanical
shark didn't work, and shooting on location on the sea
led to technical difficulties.  But the results were
worth it, from both a commercial and critical aspect.

`You're gonna need a bigger boat,' cites Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) upon
viewing his first glance of the killer shark in Steven Spielberg's 1975
masterpiece, `Jaws.' The fact that this is also the audience's first glance of
the shark and that it takes place almost an hour and a half into the film is
what makes `Jaws' such a great film. By not showing the shark in the first two
thirds of the film director Spielberg generates much more fear when he shows
attacks. We, the audience, don't see what is attacking the swimmers and so we
create in our own imaginations a greater fear than any director could ever
project on screen. The fact that Spielberg didn't plan on doing this only makes
it better; you see when it came time to shoot the attack scenes the mechanical
shark, named Bruce after Spielberg's lawyer, wasn't properly working so
Spielberg couldn't show it all. 
The story begins in Amity Island when, in one of the greatest opening scenes of
all-time, a teenager partying on the beach with some friends decides to go
skinny-dipping. All of a sudden something starts attacking her, and although
she is able to momentarily grab onto a buoy, she is eventually pulled under the
water and, we assume, killed. 
The next morning Brody, the local Police Chief who hates the water, is called
in to investigate a possible drowning reported by a friend of the girl who was
attacked. Brody's Deputy has discovered the remains of the girl's body, which
has washed up on shore, and the possibility of a drowning is ruled out. 
Brody's gut reaction is to close down the beaches but the local Mayor (Murray
Hamilton) insists on keeping to beaches open for business reasons. The Mayor
informs Brody that, `Amity is a summer town. We need summer dollars.' And Brody
is forced to keep the beaches open. Soon after, another attack claims the life
of a little boy and the Mayor announces that the beaches will be closed for 24
hours to try to catch the beast that is responsible. 
Enter, ichthyologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) who confirms that the first
attack was one of a shark. Later in a scene where Hooper and Brody go out to
sea at night to try and find the shark Hooper discovers a tooth in an abandoned
fishing boat at the bottom of the sea, a tooth that could only belong to a
Great White Shark. Then, without notice, while examining the tooth the
fisherman who owned the boat's head appears and frightens Hooper into losing
the tooth. According to the Internet Movie Database preview audiences screamed
at the original version of this scene, but director Spielberg re-shot it
because he wanted them to scream louder. 
Eventually, the town has to turn to a loner/shark hunter named Quint (Robert
Shaw) who has promised the shark dead for ten thousand dollars. Quint
reluctantly agrees to allow Brody and Hooper accompany him on the mission and
the three men sail off to sea on what Brody has described to his kids as a
fishing trip. Quint at first resents Hooper's rich upbringing but in a great
scene where the three men (mainly Hooper and Quint) sit and talk about their
physical and emotional scars they develop a sort of bond. Quint's tale is the
most horrifying, one of how during WWII after delivering the atom bomb his ship
was sunk by torpedoes and he and his crew of 1,100 men went into shark infested
waters. Waters that only 316 men would come out of alive. And with this scene,
which was written by Shaw himself, we understand why Quint has dedicated his
life to killing sharks. Shortly after, the shark begins his final attack on the
men, a battle that not all the men will emerge from alive. 
`Jaws' (Spielberg's second film) was filmed for $12 million and would go on to
be the first film to take in more than a $100 million at the box office (it
wound up taking in $260 million in the US alone). The filming was plagued with
problems, ranging from the complications with the mechanical shark to budgetary
problems to author Peter Benchley's objection to the movie's ending. The film
also went on to get 4 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, and
won in the othet three categories for Best Sound, Best Editing (Verna Fields),
and Best Original Score (John Williams). The editing and score are so crucial
to success of the film. Roger Ebert said that the film, `Jaws' was a good story
told brilliantly and he's absolutely right, without these two key elements the
film wouldn't be what it is. Try watching the attack scenes muted, they're not
nearly as scary as with the haunting theme. Or consider the way the attacks are
handled. Not only does the score help create suspense but also the cuts from
under water to above showing the shark fin to views from the beach of the
attack. These scenes handled another, more simplistic way wouldn't have
produced the same effect that they do here. 
`Jaws' placed 48th on the AFI's list of the 100 Greatest American Films and
it's high placement on the list, in my opinion, is deserved. `Jaws' is a highly
influential film that not only spawned three inferior sequels but countless
other rip-offs (the recent `Lake Placid' and `Deep Blue Sea' comes to mind.)
But none of these films managed to capture any of the atmosphere that the
original `Jaws' did. 
I heard recently that, Peter Benchley, the author of the book of which the film
is based said that he could not have written it today because of how it
unfairly treats sharks. Is it true that all sharks are man-eating monsters? Of
course not. Is it true that sharks purposely target humans the way they do in
`Jaws?' Of course not. The truth of the matter is that most shark attacks occur
because of the shark's stupidity (they usually mistake humans for seals). But
knowing all of these facts I still can not step an inch in salt water and not
hear the `Jaws' theme pop in my head. I'm still not sure whether this is a good
thing or not, but there's no doubt in my mind that `Jaws' is a great film, one
that, like other Spielberg masterpieces, stays with you long after your viewing
experience is over.

George Lucas is often blamed for the great decline in the
quality of American movies, because the success of his STAR
WARS in 1977 introduced the concept of blockbusters to
Hollywood producers, and redirected most of the studios'
capital towards utterly expensive, sometimes lucrative but
usually artistically insufficient movie products. Lucas
might be one of the people responsible for that, but the
very first summer blockbuster was shot and distributed two
years before his - JAWS by Steven Spielberg, one of the most
successful and most influential films of all times.
At the time of the production, Spielberg was still young and
relatively unknown director, far from being critics' darling
and successful crowd-pleaser. The producers, David Brown and
Richard B. Zanuck, were actually quite sceptical towards him
when they hired him to direct movie adaptation of Peter
Bentley's best-seller novel about man-eating shark that
terrorises small town on New England coast. Their suspicions
proved almost correct, because the production of JAWS was
plagued by rising budget, huge technical difficulties
associated with the shooting at sea, problems with casting
and, finally, rows between screenwriter and director. In
many ways, production of JAWS resembled the production of
ill-fated WATERWORLD twenty years later. Many people
actually questioned producers' sanity, because the film
needed almost impossibly high earnings in order to cover its
expenses. But, unlike WATERWORLD, miracle happened. JAWS was
not just the first film to break 100 million US$ mark in
box-office totals; it turned out to be one of top grossing
films of all times, where it remained for many years,
together with many other films created by Lucas and
Spielberg. Its popularity among the audience, surprisingly
in tune with the perception of critics, could be witnessed
by endless references and homage, from disco-tunes of John
Williams' musical score in 1970s, till plenty of horror
films still being inspired by it today, like Harlin's DEEP
BLUE SEA.
The plot takes place in the small island town of Amity, off
the coast of New England. Its beaches are very popular among
tourists, including group of young, carefree students that
spends a pleasant evening there. One of them is Karen
Watkins (played by Susan Blacklinie), who flirts with a boy
and goes skinny-dipping, only to never come out of water
again. Investigation is led by Martin Brody (played by Roy
Scheider), former New York cop who took the job of police
chief in small community only to evade violence of large
urban centres. When he finds the dismembered remains of a
girl on the beach, he is almost certain that the large shark
was perpetrator. He wants to close the beaches, but the city
administration, led by Mayor Larry Vaughn (played by Murray
Hamilton) is against it, fearing for the precious tourism
dollars. Brody reluctantly agrees to file the incident as a
boating accident, but later regrets his decision after few
more fatal incidents. City fathers are still stubborn, even
after marine biologist Matt Hooper (played by Richard
Dreyfuss) warns them that they have man-eating and very
territorial Great White shark in their waters. Brody is
willing to take his advice and company, and decides to hire
services of Quint (played by Robert Shaw), eccentric
fisherman and local shark expert, who would lead their
little shark-hunting expedition.
JAWS is often called one of the best horror films of all
times. It is quite understandable, since very few movies
manage to cause so intense feeling of anxiety and fear among
the audience. The fear felt by the viewers is a reflection
of subconscious fear of the Unknown. And the deep, blue and
dark depths of the ocean are perfect embodiment of the
Unknown. People watching this film are more than aware that
some unspeakable horrors lurk in those deeps and that any
man entering the water runs the risk of being nothing more
than a helpless victim. What makes this film even more
effective than other horror films was the fact that it dealt
with nothing supernatural or exotic; the audience knows that
creatures like Great White sharks exist in the oceans and
that some unfortunate people occasionally do indeed suffer
the gruesome fate of the fictional victims in this movie.
And, in this film, unlike many horrors and, same as in the
real life, nobody is immune - children, pets and even the
protagonists can be killed. The element of realism, very
rare in horror genre, made this film very effective indeed,
and it is quite understandable why many people, author of
this review included, feel rather uneasy when they enter
ocean water for a swim (although the streets and roads are
more life-threatening places, according to statistics). It
is somewhat ironic that JAWS as a very un-cliched horror
still uses the very popular horror cliche of "sex equals
death" in its opening.
The realism of the menace is just one part of the
explanation for the success of JAWS. The other part of the
answer lies in a way that Spielberg used to portray that
menace. Faced with huge technical difficulties and accidents
involving underwater equipment, together with a relatively
crude and still undeveloped special effects, Spielberg was
using many simple, but ingenious and very effective ways to
portray the fictional sea monster. He used unusual shooting
angles, but the best and most effective method was in not
portraying the monster at all. We actually don't see the
shark until late in the movie; before that we saw it only
through its own POV or actions that very convincingly give
away its huge size and incredible physical strength (one of
the most memorable and effective scenes is an entire pier
being pulled towards the ocean). When we finally see the
monster, the result is fantastic, since the otherwise
down-to-earth fish (relatively speaking, of course) had
already been connected with the scariest results of our
imagination.
The most important factor that contributed to the realism of
the film are, naturally, the characters. And this film
introduces them gradually, in orderly but very effective
action. First the deadly but magnificent menace of the dark
ocean deeps is contrasted with the quiet, every- day life of
semi-rural would-be utopia. Roy Scheider, one of the best
Hollywood actors of the 1970s (and, unfortunately, almost
forgotten now), plays the role of his life. His Brody is a
dedicated family man, whose need to protect his wife and
children led him to small town where the biggest crime
happened to be children vandalising picket fences. Every
action or choice he makes in this film, even the wrong one,
like leaving the beaches open, was motivated with the need
to protect his job and family bliss provided by it. Then we
are introduced to Richard Dreyfuss as rich and arrogant, but
in the same time very valuable scientific expert. Dreyfuss
played this role very well, in many ways trying to become
Spielberg's alter ego and he is often most remembered for
this particular role. It is ironic that the actor himself
forgot about it, according to the anecdote that later led to
the movie trivia reference in 1987 film STAKEOUT. But the
most memorable performance comes from Robert Shaw. His
Quint, rude working class eccentric whose rugged, easy-going
personality hides tragic secret from the past, is one of the
most vivid characters in the history of cinema. The late
actor's contribution to this film is even more important
when we take into account that the credit for most memorable
words in the film - legendary USS Indianapolis story (itself
being based on real life history, another element of realism
in this film) - must go exclusively to him. All three actors
had wonderful interaction, both in the scenes of male
bonding and exciting but very realistic and believable
action scenes.
Those three giants of course, shadowed other actors.
Lorraine Gary was good as Brody's wife, but the script
didn't give her much material. Murray Hamilton was wonderful
as mayor; at first he is a creep whose actions and
mishandling of the crisis was motivated only by greed; at
the end he reveals himself as normal, caring human being.
Lee Fierro as Mrs. Kintner also delivered few powerful
scenes in short space. The acting talent was accompanied by
the talents of almost anyone else in this film, especially
Verna Fields with its perfect editing and John Williams with
his effective, "Oscar"-awarded and now all-too-familiar
musical score. Talents of those two combined provided some
of the scariest and most memorable scenes in the history of
film.
Unfortunately, even the greatest of all films age through
the time and JAWS, the first film of modern Hollywood era,
didn't escape that fate. Compared with plenty of similar,
more recent films with bigger budgets and modern special
effects technology, it seems somewhat obsolete. It is
especially so in some of the night scenes, with sometimes
annoying use of "day for night" techniques that provide too
dark picture. On the other hand, such minor flaws were not
the authors' fault and insistence on them would look like
unnecessary nit- picking. All technical insufficiencies of
JAWS are still being, same as they always were, compensated
with excellent story, atmosphere and characters that work
now as effectively as they worked quarter of a century ago.
JAWS is one of those rare films that really deserved its
commercial success and its place among the best films of all
times.

JAWS is an unforgettable thriller, pioneer for future filmmaking, and
the main cause for a fear of the ocean.  Steven Spielberg's first big
film, JAWS is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again
and just not get tired of it.  Based on the novel by Peter Benchley, JAWS
is the story of Amity Island, a small resort on the Atlantic Ocean, that
suddenly becomes terrorized by a Great White shark.
The movie begins in a fantastic, thrilling way.  A group of teenagers are
having at night, drinking and having fun.  Two of the party-goers leave the
group for a midnight swim.  Chrissie (Susan Backlinie), who will be
forever known as this role, is the girl who leaves.  Once she begins to
swim, she is attacked.  In a scene that probably made a few movie-goers
leave the theater, a lasting impression is left as to how vicious this
shark can be.
Chief of Police Martin Brody, played very well by Roy Scheider, is
assigned to investigate the mysterious disappearance of the girl.  The
only witness was a drunken man who can't really remember anything.  When
the remains are eventually found, the first assumption (by Brody) is a
shark attack.  But, many town officials don't want it to be classified as
a shark attack, and feel that it is a "boat accident".  The beaches are
closed and many locals decide to take it upon themselves to hunt down the
shark.  Eventually, Hooper, a young scientist portrayed terrifically by
Richard Dreyfuss, is brought in to investigate the possible shark problem.
Once he sees the remains of the first victim, he is one hundred percent
sure that this is no "boating accident" and that the shark they are
dealing with is definitely posses a serious threat to the resort island.
The beaches remain open and the visitors are allowed to swim freely.  
Soon, another victim is attacked by the killer shark, this time a young
boy.  This sets off a manhunt for the shark, led by Chief Brody.  A killer
shark is killed and thought to be the shark responsible for the deaths of
the two victims.  When they find out this shark is not the shark they are
looking for, Chief Brody, Hooper, and Quint (played by the late Robert
Shaw), a veteran shark fisherman, set off to hunt down the shark that is
plaguing the small resort island.  After a while, the shark turns on the
boat and its crew, and the men are left to not only eliminate the shark,
but save their own lives.
JAWS is a seemingly non-stop action/thriller with countless unforgettable
moments and quotes.  Aside from the entire sequence of events when the
crew is attempting to kill this very large fish, Quint's story of the
U.S.S. Indianapolis (a scene written by Shaw) is a very detailed and
memorable scene.  JAWS is, by today's standards, probably not as
suspenseful as most movies, but for 1975, it was a definite
edge-of-your-seat thriller that left the nation petrified of the ocean.

    By now, the stories have become legendary.  In 1974, producers David 
Brown and Richard Zanuck, looking for a fresh young talent to helm the 
film adaptation of Peter Benchley's blockbuster novel JAWS.  They found 
a 28 year old Jewish kid out of California, who had directed a fantastic 
television movie named DUEL, and a respectable film debut in THE 
SUGARLAND EXPRESS, starring Goldie Hawn.  After engaging in numerous 
effects difficulties and time constraints, this young kid delivered a 
stunning, terrifying film to Universal, which proceeded to make it the 
biggest blockbuster in history to date, opening it in a record number of 
screens.  Zanuck reportedly was against this, saying he wanted people to 
"drive 100 miles to the theaters" to see this film.  The 
"kid's" name?  Steven Spielberg.
Spielberg has, of course, has had the most lucrative career in film 
history, and his first blockbuster has grown to mythic proportions.  
JAWS is often mentioned as the film which began the era of modern films: 
it originated the summer film, and created the demand for the "event 
picture".  It has also been mocked and ridiculed more than any other 
film in memory, probably because of the three campy, often atrocious 
sequels that followed it.
That's a real shame, because JAWS happens to be one of the most 
perfectly paced, marvelosuly written, and flawlessly executed 
experiments in audience terror.  From the horrifying beginning to the 
stunningly filmed climax, this is a study in how to scare the living 
daylights out of an audience.  Spielberg carefully hides his massive 
shark until about halfway through the movie, relying on sharp editing, 
music, sound, and images to convey the fear.  He also uses vast amounts 
of underwater shots, and places the film in a familiar locale.  The 
common theme throughout the entire first act of the film is of the 
terror that can creep into an ordinary situation.  There are moments of 
relieved tension, followed by exposition which introduce the basic 
characters, and give more details on this massive shark so carefully 
concealed from the audience.
What is so amazing about JAWS is that, first off, the movie 
dramatically changes course halfway through.  The setting changes from a 
cozy little island to a creaky ship forced to take on a monster of 
mythic proportions.  The film, in essence, becomes the modern-day Moby 
Dick, with the angry captain (Robert Shaw as Quint), the intelligent 
scientist (Richard Dreyfuss), and the scared passenger (Roy Scheider).  
It turns from a terrifying horror film into a chase: two bodies hurtling 
at each other, both willing to die in the process.  It's a stunning feat 
of filmmaking because the transition is so seamless.  Spielberg is able 
to scare the audience even then, because by that time, we have grown 
close to the characters, we can feel their every emotion through our own 
bodies.
Much of that credit goes to the excellent script.  There is that 
special human element to JAWS which all other horror films lack.  There 
are the friendships that are formed, the families that are introduced, 
and the feeling that these people, suffering on this island, are real.  
One of the most legendary shots is with Chief Brody (Scheider) eating 
with his son, next to him.  There is a terrific human interplay within 
this sequence, one Spielberg introduces to make the characters human.  
They are normal, everyday individuals.  Spielberg realized that in order 
for tension to exist, there must be a period of anti-tension, where the 
audience is allowed to relax, and let down their guard, before the next 
wave of terror. 
The performances in JAWS are absolutely astounding.  Scheider makes 
his career with a legendary performance that will be forever remembered. 
 Dreyfuss is gleefully superb, often carrying the middle portion of the 
movie with his scholarly antics and quick wit.  The last third is 
dominated by Robert Shaw, whose Quint fills the screen with the image of 
a man who's "talking about shaarrrkin'".  Lorraine Grey delivers 
a fine performance as Brody's wife, and the rest of the cast fills in 
admirably, carefully recreating a summer resort town.  There are 
hysterical moments of hilarity, placed beautifully in sequence as to 
elicit the desired response.
If anything, JAWS seems dated by comparison to today's movies.  
Bruce the shark is not as great as the hype, and the brand-new computer 
generated sharks are far superior.  But the film is still breathlessly 
exciting due to its lack of reliance on Bruce.  It instead relies upon 
the tension created by the presence of a man-eater, the character play, 
and the absolutely phenomenal score by John Williams, who delivers the 
most imitated, and yet most effective score in film history.  Spielberg 
places every component in flawless manner, and creates what is the 
definitive film of his early career, of the horror genre, and possibly 
of the 1970's itself.  The first true blockbuster, JAWS is simply 
exhilirating, even after all these years.  Wow.

"You yell 'Barracuda!' and everyone says, 'Huh? What?'; You yell
'Shark!' and we've got a panic on our hands on the Fourth of July."
--Larry Vaughn, Mayor of Amity, Jaws 
In 1975, a young director named Steven Spielberg single-handedly
created a new movie genre--the summer blockbuster. The twenty-five
year-old moviemaker's third film, Jaws, shook the industry with such
force that its effects are still being felt today. It forever
shattered Hollywood's belief that people don't watch movies during the
summer; for this reason alone, every action extravaganza that followed
it, from Star Wars to Independence Day to Spielberg's own Jurassic
Park and The Lost World, owes a debt of gratitude to this tale of
terror. Jaws continues to serve as a benchmark of suspense cinema, and
still retains its visceral power nearly a quarter-century after its
initial release. 
Moonlight sparkles on the ocean. A nude swimmer plunges into the cool
water, splitting the waves with a splash. She swims. She floats. She
laughs.  She dies. 
Martin Brody (Roy Schieder), the chief of police in the idyllic
seaside town of Amity, is quick to react to the news of the shark
attack. He sensibly believes the beaches should be closed until the
leviathan can be vanquished. The townsfolk, however, are less certain:
Amity is a summer town which depends on tourist dollars for its
survival. Every day the beaches are closed, the town grows poorer;
although Brody believes that safety is the more important concern, he
is overruled by Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton). Soon the beaches are
open once again... with disastrous results. 
Brody calls for help from the Oceanographic Institute, and a young
shark expert named Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) is sent to assist.
The duo teams up with a crusty local salt named Quint (Robert Shaw),
who offers to kill the shark--for a fee, of course. 
The story at the heart of Steven Spielberg's Jaws revolves not so much
around the creature which has taken up residence in the waters of
Amity, but around the townsfolk who are forced to deal with the
consequences of its presence. It's a subtle distinction, but it makes
all the difference. Jaws is not a monster flick; it's the story of
three men facing a seemingly insurmountable force of nature. In
keeping the emphasis on the characters rather than the shark, as the
film's three wretched sequels did, Spielberg crafted a cinematic work
that still fascinates and mesmerizes. Human moments dominate the
tale--take a look at the oft-parodied "injury comparison" scene aboard
Quint's boat, the Ocra, and tell me whether you saw anything so clever
or affecting in, say, Independence Day.

It's early August 1998.  Steven Spielberg has been in the news a lot
recently.  Thankfully, a man was just sentenced to a hefty jail term for
stalking the director.  His recent release of 'Saving Private Ryan' is
the most harrowing war picture to come along in years and ranks up there
with the director's best work and five of Spielberg's films (more than
any other director) recently made the American Film Institute's list of
the top 100 movies of all time in the first century of film
(1896-1996).  They are, in order from lowest to highest on the list,
'Close Encounters of the Third Kind', #64, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark',
#60, 'Jaws' #48, 'E.T., The Extra Terrestrial', #25 and rightfully so,
as a Spielberg film and a great film in general, 'Schindler's List' in
the top 10 at #9.  I would probably shift that list around a little
because I don't think E.T., is Spielberg's second best film, 'Jaws' is.
Both 'Jaws' and 'Schindler's List' are in my top 10 films of all time
with 'Schindler's List' finishing ahead of the famous shark movie.
Plain and simple, 'Jaws' was the movie that got me interested in film.
Like a roller coaster ride with shrieks and movements of excitement from
the theatre audience, for me it is the definition of what's called 'the
audience picture'.  'Jaws' has one of those talked about and memorable
opening scenes where the young girl, jumps into the ocean at dusk and
goes swimming in the nude and is consumed as a meal.  The poster for
'Jaws' is also one of the most famous as we see the shark swimming up to
the surface to eat his dinner as the young female swimmer passes by and
'Jaws' was the first movie to earn at least 100 million dollars at the
box office and it eventually earned 260 million domestically and 470
million worldwide.  Not to shabby considering the price of a movie
ticket 23 years ago.
'Jaws' also earned three Oscars on four nominations for sound, original
music score by John Williams which is one of the recognizable motion
picture scores in film history with its towering and haunting passages
and an Oscar for what is probably the film's most important contribution
which is the sensational, revolutionary and overall brilliant film
editing by Verna Fields.  The fourth nomination 'Jaws' received was for
best picture and it lost out to 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' and
was also up against 'Dog Day Afternoon', 'Barry Lyndon' and 'Nashville'.
Plagued with production problems and a budget that went from four
million to ten million dollars, Steven Spielberg did not receive an
Oscar nomination as best director but he should have for making a film
work in the final cut that many predicted would fail miserably.
For those of you that have seen 'Jaws' (if you haven't, see the wide
screen version), you'll probably agree that many of the films best
scenes have nothing to do with seeing the shark.  Conversations in and
around and about the menace that's swimming off the shores of Amityville
Long Island, NY are the main topic of many scenes in this brilliant film
that are funny, turbulent, moving, surprising and the film gave rise to
increasing the adventure, horror and action genres.  The film was
actually shot at Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts during the summer of
1974.
The term 'old salt' has never been better visualized on film than in the
character of Quint, played by Robert Shaw who died of a heart attack in
1978, three years after 'Jaws' came out.  Shaw was a brilliant actor.
His interpretation of the movie villain was diversified in many films
and among them are the Russian assassin in the second James Bond film,
'From Russia With Love' in 1963.  The film for which he received his one
and only Oscar nomination which was for Best Supporting Actor in 1966
for 'A Man For All Seasons' for his portrait of King Henry VIII of
England and his turn as the ruthless depression era gangster in 'The
Sting' in 1973 are probably some of the most most under rated bad guys
in movie history.
In 'Jaws', Shaw's portrayal of the fisherman Quint grabs your attention
quickly.  At a meeting of the town's political council, disagreements
break out and with everyone shouting and exchanging words of chaos,
Quint restores order to the room by scratching his nails on a blackboard
and tells the mayor (Murray Hamilton), the police chief Martin Brody
(Roy Scheider) and everyone else that he will catch and kill the shark
in question for a sum of $10,000.  The town takes it under advisement
and Quint is seen mostly in the film's last hour as the shark hunt gets
serious.  The giant great white shark has already killed two people and
in addition from offered help by Quint, Brody gets help from a shark
expert named Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), who, along with Quint but
toned down a lot more, is much of the film's comic relief while he also
brings reason and common sense in the pursuit of nature.
'Jaws', along with '12 Angry Men' and 'The Treasure of the Sierra
Madre', illustrates extremely well, men interacting with one another as
Brody, Quint and Hooper are portrayed as truly human characters,
constantly at odds with each other on the boat but who, in one memorable
scene involving dinner, display their humanity and Quint's long but
fascinating talk about life on the U.S.S. Indianapolis during World War
II is the film's best package of dialogue which reportedly was written
by Shaw himself.
I always thought that the great visionary mind of Steven Spielberg had
intended audiences to see very little of the shark in the film's first
hour but Spielberg says that that wasn't the plan at all because the
remote controlled shark simply didn't work when called upon.
Screenwriters Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb wrote a truly great
academic script based on Benchley's novel, passing over the opportunity
to make 'Jaws' an exploitation picture by creating great characters,
believable situations and an insight into what was at the time, a truly
original subject.

review: **** (out of ****)
"Jaws" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a
single image on screen. The movie opens with blackness, and only
distant, alien-like underwater sounds. Then it comes, the first ominous
bars of composer John Williams' now infamous score. Dah-dum. From there,
director Steven Spielberg wastes no time, taking us into the water on a
midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly. Right away he
lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean, and once
"Jaws" has attacked, it never relinquishes its grip.
Perhaps what is most outstanding about "Jaws" is how Spielberg builds
the movie. He works it like a theatrical production, with a first act
and a second act. Unlike so many modern filmmakers, he has a great deal
of restraint, and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the
second act. Until then, he merely suggests its presence with creepy,
subjective underwater shots and Williams' music. He's building the
tension bit by bit, so when it comes time for the climax, the shark's
arrival is truly terrifying. He doesn't let us get bored with the
imagery.
The first act opens with Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), a New
York cop who has taken an easy, peaceful job running the police station
on Amity Island, a fictitious New England resort town where there hasn't
been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years. The island is shaken up by
several vicious great white shark attacks right before the Fourth of
July, and the mayor, Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), doesn't want to
shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist
money.
Brody is joined by Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), a young, ambitious
shark expert from the Marine Institute. Hooper is as fascinated by the
shark as he is determined to help Brody stop it -- his knowledge about
the exact workings of the shark ("It's a perfect engine, an eating
machine") make it that much more terrifying. When Vaughn finally
relents, Hooper and Brody join a crusty old shark killer named Quint
(Robert Shaw) on his decrepit boat, the Orca, to search for the shark.
The entire second act takes place on the Orca as the three men hunt the
shark, and inevitably, are hunted by it.
"Jaws" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense
of pacing, tension, and horror. It is like ten movies all rolled into
one, and it's no wonder it took America by storm in the summer of 1975,
taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time
(until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by "Star Wars"). Even
today, fascination with this film is on par with Hitchcock's "Psycho,"
and it never seems to age.
Although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences,
including several mechanical sharks, obsolete, none of it could improve
the film because it only would lead to overkill. The technical
limitations faced by Spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a
better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic
elements like pacing, characterization, sharp editing, and creative
photography, instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark
effects.
Scheider, Dreyfuss, and Shaw were known actors at the time "Jaws" was
made, but none of them had the draw of a Robert Redford or Paul Newman.
Nevertheless, this film guaranteed them all successful careers because
each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by
the shark. Scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband
and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what's right and
going against the entire town. "It's your first summer here, you know,"
Mayor Vaughn warns him.
Dreyfuss, who had previously been seen in "American Graffiti" (1973) and
"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz" (1974) gives a surprisingly
mature, complex performance for someone who had literally only played
kids and teenagers. However, most outstanding is the gnarled performance
by Robert Shaw as the movie's Captain Ahab, a performance sorely
overlooked by the Academy Awards. Bordering of parody, Shaw plays Quint
as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism. He's
slightly deranged, and Shaw's performance is almost a caricature.
However, there is one scene late in the film, when he and Brody and
Hooper are below deck on the Orca comparing scars. Quint is drawn into
telling the story of his experiences aboard the U.S.S. Indianapolis, a
Navy ship in World War II that was sunk by the Japanese. His tale of
floating in the water for more than a week with over 1,000 other men
while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more
hair-raising than anything Spielberg put on screen. Shaw delivers the
story in one long take, and it is the best acting in the film.
Of course, we can't leave out the shark itself; with its black eyes,
endless rows of teeth, and insatiable urge to eat, it is basically the
epitome of all mankind's fears about what is unknown and threatening in
nature. A shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived
sinch the dinosaurs, great whites do exist, they can be as large as the
shark in "Jaws," and they are a threat. Every one of Spielberg's
subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how
we look to the shark: a bunch of writihing, dangling, completely
unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into.
The shark in "Jaws" was actually a combination of actual footage and
five different mechanical sharks (all nicknamed "Bruce" by the crew)
built to be shot from different angles. Many have forgotten, but "Jaws"
was a sort of precursor to "Waterworld" (1995), a movie's who soggy
production and cost overruns had Universal Studios worried about a bomb.
But, as we can see now, Spielberg overcame all the obstacles, and
delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of
Hollywood.

We see the dorsal fin slide gracefully through the water. It nears the
shore. And then we see...red...blood! One more life has been stolen and
this cannot happen again. Three brave men must set out into the ocean to
kill this monster. 
It's a frightening premise, isn't it? Jaws is a movie about a series of
killings made by a shark and the men who set out to stop it. Like Steven
Spielberg's more recent ( and far inferior ) The Lost World: Jurassic Park,
it manipulates you so completely that you often feel as if you could faint
( though you just shudder. TLW: JP, though good, was never so scary. )
Every time I see it it works on some level. It's a wonderfully entertaining
mix of crisp dialogue, terrific performances, and first rate direction. ( I
have not mentioned the special effects because they are not very special. )
I recently heard that there will probably be a Jaws: Special Edition.
Apperantly the shark was never as scary as Mr. Spielberg intended it to be.
I don't remember it that way. Technology might be getting better. Movies
aren't. It's not fair to blame the Star Wars trilogy ( or at least not the
first two ) and Jaws for the current down  pour of dumb movies made by dumb
people in the hopes that dumb parents will take there dumb kids to the dumb
theater. Star Wars is based on a story cycle and so is Jaws. Steven
Spielberg knows - as his equally wonderful Raiders Of The Lost Ark shows as
well - that you can't substitute effects for a script and dialogue for a
character. He is a great director - the best of any kind to do this sort of
movie. ( Close runner-up: James Cameron. ) Jaws is - as a friend of mine
pointed out - not so much a summer blockbuster as a Hitchcock thriller.
Examine it again. The entire film is so smashingly scary and wonderfully
engaging that it would take alot of effort not to be totally enthralled.
Take another look at the scene in which a main character goes undewater to
examine something which may or may not be important. The direction is as
elegant and the editing as crisp as in,  for example, the climax of
Strangers On A Train. You are never allowed the relief of looking away from
the screen. When, at the end, you see an image as frightening as the
horse's head in The Godfather - on the other hand this is a shark eating a
man - you might want to close your eyes. But you can't. It's a nightmarish
image and, in some sick way, it holds your attention relentlessly. Mr.
Spielberg has learned the most important of cinematic tricks: if you make
hints, to the audience, of what is going to happen - in other words, make
them apprehensive in advance - and then carefully build layer upon layer of
unbearable suspense, when it does happen it will be all the more
frightening. He also knows that - with rare exceptions - images can not
live up to our fears and beliefs. ( In the original trailer for Psycho
there is a scene in which our host, Alfred Hitchcock, is exploring mother's
room. He opens a closet door and looks in with a half suprised expression.
He looks at the camera and slowly closes the door. "Shall we go on?", he
asks. Nothing more is said on the subject. What is in that closet? ) He
often cuts away when we want to look most. This only makes us want to see
more. I am anxious to see Jaws on a big screen; even with out that extra
element it's a masterpiece. 
In both Jurassic Park films Spielberg showed us the dinos good and quick.
Yeah, they were amazing. But if he had remembered what he learned while
making Jaws - our imagination is more powerful then his camera - then he
could have made two more great films.
