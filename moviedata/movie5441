     So where do you go if you're an ex-doctor with a critically
wounded patient to treat?  Why, an out-of-the-way biker bar, of course.
Once you walk in the door with blood on your coat, they'll know you
have a patient in the car and will invite you to bring the patient into
the back room.  They'll even be happy to assist with the operation.
     As recently deposed doctor Eugene Sands, David Duchovny is the
only reason to see PLAYING GOD, not that he is nearly reason enough.
In his ubiquitous voice-over, he gets the best lines in Mark Haskell
Smith's script.  His one-liners are sometimes funny and other times
wise.  ("Life is all a matter of perspective," and "Hell does not
always look like hell.  On a good day, it can look a lot like L.A.")
The promising trailers for the film contain most of the good lines.
     The story opens on a drugged Eugene -- who lost his license by
operating while stoned -- looking to score some heroin in a bar.  When
the guy next to him is blasted by some disagreeable thugs, he practices
a little illegal medicine on the victim as he squirts blood everywhere.
PLAYING GOD is the goriest film I've seen this year and the most
gratuitously violent.  When the tedious story starts dragging, as it
does frequently, director Andy Wilson has someone stick something in a
vein so blood can splatter the set.
     Wilson's direction is aimless and confusing.  When they are not
throwing fits, his actors speak in whispers, which, admittedly, in this
film is not necessarily a bad thing.
     Timothy Hutton plays a criminal named Raymond Blossom, who takes a
liking to Eugene since it was one of his men that Eugene patched up in
the bar.  Raymond likes him so much that he interrupts Eugene's nice
heroin high by having him fetched.  "Is kidnapping your only way to
make new friends?" Eugene asks.
     Hutton alternates between lethargy and overacting.  One minute he
is spaced out, and the next he has a temper tantrum.  At first, the
script makes him seem the good bad guy as opposed to his Estonian
associates playing the bad bad guys, who attempt a world record for the
most uses of the F-word in a single minute.  The movie delights in
attempts to shock the audience through blood and language.  (I happened
to glance at my wife at one point during the show, and she looked back
holding her nose.)
     "Tonight, I said to myself, 'I will not get high,' " Eugene tells
the audience.  "I might just as well have said to myself, 'Tonight, I
will not breathe.' " And when the obligatory sequence comes where
Eugene goes cold turkey to give up his habit, he makes it look no worse
than a case of the flu.  A few chocolate bars are all it takes.
     Plot holes and improbabilities abound.  If any of the characters
were likable, the frequent required leaps of faith might begin to get
on your nerves, but with this collection of lowlifes, one has trouble
caring.  Even the lead FBI agent in charge of the case acts like a
spoiled and smart-aleck fraternity kid.  Only David Duchovny gives this
film any humanity and provides any respite from its oppressive
storyline.
     PLAYING GOD runs 1:33.  It is rated R for gore, excessive
violence, hard drug usage, profanity, etc.  The film is not appropriate
for teenagers.

    There is no doubt in my mind that David Duchovny can be a movie star.
His often under-appreciated work on "The X-Files" has demonstrated both
dramatic chops and a wry sense of humor, as well as the requisite
physicality for action.  Duchovny has the looks, the smarts and the range
on the big screen to go places most fellow TV alums never go.
     It's also clear that he knows how to pick interesting scripts.  To a
resume which already includes unconventional fare like KALIFORNIA and THE
RAPTURE, Duchovny adds Mark Haskell Smith's PLAYING GOD.  It begins with a
solid premise, introducing us to a former surgeon named Eugene Sands
(Duchovny) one year removed from losing his license for operating on a
patient while high on amphetamines, and beginning a downward spiral into
addiction.  A chance at returning to his trade comes when Sands helps save
the life of a wounded associate of crime boss Raymond Blossom (Timothy
Hutton).  Raymond offers Sands a job as his organization's designated
"gunshot doc," an offer Sands accepts with some reservations.  Eventually
he begins to question his decision, but it may be too late to get out once
he's in, especially with an over-zealous FBI agent (Michael Massee)
breathing down his neck.
     Smith's script does about all you could ask a script to do,
delivering some well-developed characters and smart dialogue (okay, there
are a couple of howlers) in service of that premise.  Duchovny selected a
nice piece of material to work with, but PLAYING GOD shows that an actor
can't choose most of the things which go into the making of a good film.
It has the feel of a film which should have been much better, but turned
out inconsistent and sloppy under the first-time direction of Andy Wilson
(of the popular cable mystery series "Cracker").  There are times when
Wilson tries so hard to create his gritty thriller atmosphere -- all
distorted imagery, slow motion and awkward cross-cutting -- that the
narrative begins to get lost.  He's going for the right mood, but with the
wrong methods.
     Duchovny also had no control over the performances of his
cast-mates, though from all appearances, neither did the director.  While
Duchovny and Angelina Jolie (as Hutton's girlfriend) play low-key to nail
the wounded psyches of their characters, all around them fall victim to
the notion that louder acting is better acting.  Hutton goes irretrievably
bonkers as the bleached beach-bum majordomo whose actions rarely make
sense, various and sundry gangsters exchange profane threats with bug-eyed
malevolence, and Michael Massee plays his off-kilter Fed as a perfect
partner for the cross-dressing G-Man played by Duchovny himself on "Twin
Peaks."  John Hawkes does steal a few scenes as one of Hutton's edgier
hired guns, a ring-nosed psycho with a soft spot for his partners.  His
performance might have been even more effective if a dozen other
supporting players weren't making unhinged seem so unnecessary.
     The general tone of the performances makes Duchovny stand out like
Buster Keaton in a Three Stooges short.  His deadpan demeanor begins to
seem like a reaction to a bunch of nutcase actors let loose on the screen,
rather than the appropriate personality for his redemption-hungry
character.  In fact, Duchovny is too "together" most of the time; rock
bottom doesn't look all that bad if that's where he's supposed to be when
we meet him.  Then again, it's hard to say whether that particular
character choice was Duchovny's to make.  A thousand choices go into the
making of a movie; Duchovny's choice to accept this role was only one of
them.  You can see his star quality in PLAYING GOD, but you can also see
that picking a sharp script is no guarantee that an actor will be in a
sharply-made film.

Touchstone / 1:33 / 1997 / R 
Cast: David Duchovny; Timothy Hutton; Angelina Jolie; Michael Masse; 
Peter Stormare; Gary Dourdan; John Hawkes 
Director: Andy Wilson 
Screenplay: Mark Haskell Smith 
A weak star vehicle for an otherwise strong star, "Playing God" will 
probably spend several weeks competing in the autumn box office before 
being remembered only as David Duchovny's iffy first lead in a motion 
picture. It's a bloody good thing he's got the likely sting-erasing 
"X-Files" film slated for release this upcoming summer, because "Playing 
God" is as frivolous and forgettable as movies come. 
Duchovny plays Eugene Sands, a pill-popping Los Angeles surgeon who 
loses his licence after operating on a patient while high on 
amphetamines. After flaunting his medical valor on a dying bar patron, 
he attracts the attention of violent crime boss Raymond Blossom (Timothy 
Hutton), a bleached blonde bad boy with a decidedly non-bad boy name. 
The two reach an agreement -- Eugene will be sated financially (and 
habitually) in turn for providing his services as a "gunshot doctor" for
Raymond, treating his wounded associates when a hospital stay would be 
too risky. But Eugene takes some risks of his own when he become's 
enamored with his new employer's girlfriend Claire (Angelina Jolie). 
Even though most post-"Pulp Fiction" 1990s crime thrillers are hip to a 
fault, they can still attain memorable levels by at least being superior 
in flash and fashion. The surprising thing about "Playing God" is how it 
never seems to try to achieve much in either of those departments -- 
it's empty in both style and substance. Not only is the story totally 
predictable and cliched, but so are the devices through which it's told. 
"Playing God" utilizes such overworked genre staples as slow-motion and
hard-boiled narration ("On the way home tonight, I will not get high," 
laments Eugene about trying to end his drug problem). 
Because "Playing God" often alternates unsuccessfully between the 
serious and the silly, you're left wishing it would have been explicitly 
one or the other. The dramatic scenes don't work because the movie fails 
to deal with Eugene's habit in a satisfying way -- it's a plot device -- 
and ends up offering little in the way of a resolution. The funny stuff 
sometimes gels better (including a pointless episode where Duchovny 
hangs out with the crowd at a redneck country bar), but ultimately, 
"Playing God" is as campy as an episode of the Adam West "Batman" series 
-- and just about as compelling, too. 
The performers are what save the show from being a total wash-out, 
though. Duchovny demonstrates the charisma and canny sex appeal that 
serve him so well on "The X-Files." Hutton, one of the most underrated 
-- and underused -- actors working today, has a considerable amount of 
fun as the escalatingly psychotic villain. Jolie, the daughter of Jon 
Voight, serves frustratingly little purpose other than to get the two 
men fighting, but sports a seductive, pleasant screen presence anyway. 
"Playing God" isn't distinguished in the least, but that shortcoming is 
to be expected when a movie sets out on the wrong foot from virtually 
the first frame on. Not much else can be said for a serio-comedy that 
has you chuckling when you're not supposed to and groaning when you are. 
"Playing God" isn't awful by most means, but it's not at all special, 
either.

PLAYING GOD would like to be a Serious Movie that explores Important
Questions, most notably whether or not it's ethical for a doctor to treat
seriously wounded criminals privately, rather than take them to a hospital
where they would almost certainly be arrested after recovering. These
questions are present in the screenplay, but most of the time they are
briefly mentioned in voiceover so that the filmmakers can get on to the
next bit of quirky dialogue or the next violent confrontation. It's another
Quentin Tarantino imitation that occasionally takes a stab at being a
character drama, but it doesn't succeed completely at being either of the
two.
As the film begins, we are introduced to Eugene Sands (David Duchovny), a
former doctor who has lost his license after losing a patient while high on
amphetamines. He now lives the lonely, aimless life of an addict, and when
he walks into a bar one night to buy drugs, two hit men suddenly burst in
and shoot another patron. Eugene reacts out of instinct and quickly acts to
save the man. Gangster Raymond Blossom (Timothy Hutton) soon hears about
the incident and wants to hire Eugene to work as his private doctor,
assisting in situations in which one of his men is critically wounded.
Eugene agrees, temporarily, but soon gets tired of being surrounded by
murderers and psychopaths and, having fallen for Raymond's girlfriend
Claire (Angelina Jolie) in the meantime, he starts looking for a way out
for both of them. A possibility is presented in the form of an FBI sting
operation, led by an agent who wants Eugene to be his man on the inside
when they bust Raymond.
I would have liked to have seen more of Eugene's internal moral conflict,
as well as his later struggle to kick his drug habit. Both, however, are
portrayed rather blandly and aren't given much screen time: his qualms
about working for Raymond are mostly confined to voiceover, and his
withdrawal period doesn't look like anything more than a guy having a bad
case of the flu. PLAYING GOD is only interested in its characters up to a
point: they're mostly devices to set the quirky crime caper in motion.
Duchovny does what he can with the material, portraying a basically good
person who's taken a couple of serious wrong turns and delivering cynical
one-liners with a dry tone that always manages to draw a laugh. Timothy
Hutton, who plays Raymond as an unstable, overconfident crime lord wannabe,
also turns in a good performance, alternating between maniacally over the
top and subtly weird and intimidating. Unfortunately, I can't sing the same
praises for the FBI agent who contacts Eugene: for some reason, the
filmmakers decided to play this guy as an obsessive, nervous mess who can't
sit still and who sometimes seems like he's an even bigger head case than
Raymond. Somehow I wasn't too surprised when his sting operation fell apart
at the end.
Still, PLAYING GOD is noteworthy on two counts. One is that Eugene Sands
never turns into a stereotypical action hero, even when the FBI operation
collapses and Eugene pursues Raymond and Claire on his own. I kept waiting
for him and Raymond to have some drawn-out fistfight or gun battle, but
thankfully, they never did. In fact, the final moments of the film are
about as far from two men trying to kill each other as can be. The
relationship between Eugene and Claire is also written pretty well: it's
not the first outlaw romance in Hollywood and it won't be the last, but it
is portrayed believably, finding the right mix of typical attraction and
intimacy and the distinct way of relating to each other that comes from
their experience on the wrong side of the law.
Other than that, however, PLAYING GOD is really just another attempt at an
off-beat crime caper, and a fairly average one at that. It has many of the
right ingredients, but somehow they don't really add up to much of
anything. There's an amusing scene towards the end, for example, in which
one of Raymond's thugs sheepishly admits to the other that he forgot the
ski mask he needed for their upcoming heist, but we barely know the pair,
and the scene doesn't really have anything to do with anything else in the
movie. Criminals sit around tossing expletives at each other, but it never
results in anything more than a momentary laugh. Duchovny's and Hutton's
performances are both good, but unlike the characters of, say, PULP
FICTION or THE USUAL SUSPECTS, they don't play off of each other in any
distinct way: they just sort of happen to be in the same movie.
I saw PLAYING GOD on video, and I think maybe that's the best way to see
it. It's not a very complete experience, nor is the script very thorough,
but as an amalgamation of moderately interesting bits and pieces (along
with a few exceptional moments), it's a decent way to pass an hour and a
half at home.

The only, though incredibly small, reason to see Playing God is to see
David Duchovny portray a character that is not Fox Mulder from FOX's
popular series "The X-Files." I'm a big "X-Files" fan so I ran out and saw
Playing God because it stars David Duchovny. Was I disappointed?
Eugene Sands (David Duchovny) is a heavy drug user. He was a doctor till he
lost his license; he lost his license after he killed one of his patients
while operating under the influence of drugs. Everyday Sands misses the
opportunity and joy of operating on people and saving their lives. He
regrets losing his license but is unable to kick his drug habit. One night,
on a routine trip to a club to buy his drugs, Sands saves a gunshot victim.
The victim turns out to be a member of a gang that is headed up by Raymond
Blossom (Timothy Hutton). Blossom's girlfriend, Claire (Angelina Jolie),
also witnesses this incident.
Blossom ventures to hire Sands as a "private surgeon" of sorts because he
does not want to send his gang members or friends to the hospital in fear
of the hospital reporting gun shot wounds to the police. Sands is initially
hesitant, but the draw of being able to operate and save lives is too much
for him, and he joins up with Blossom.
This takes place in the first forty-five minutes of the film, and is
actually pretty interesting. The later forty-five minutes though gets done
ala the standard Hollywood action style, lots of guns going off and a very
long car chase. And this is one of the downfalls of Playing God.
The script is another downfall of Playing God. The lines are laughable,
even when they are not meant to be so. The script is filled with mediocre
and lack luster dialogue that feels like it was taken straight out of your
standard made-for-TV-movie.
The performances are decent; Duchovny does well, but nothing really new
here. Jolie has big lips and has little screen time. Hutton goes over the
top as Blossom and it does work sometimes, but his character, as a whole
was unbelievable.
Playing God is at best a made-for-TV-movie. There is not a good reason to
recommend this film unless you are a fan of "The X-Files", and even then,
the film sorely disappointed me. The film runs just a little over 90
minutes, but it seems like it ran over two hours. This is a film to miss on
the big screen and maybe even a film to miss on video.

   A favorite question of ethics professors in college
departments of philosophy is this.  Let's say you have one
last final exam to pass in order to graduate, at which time you
will head for your Peace Corps assignment in Guatemala. 
You have agricultural expertise which the Central American
country can very much use.  If you do not pass this exam you
will not graduate and your Peace Corps assignment will
evaporate.  You haven't had time to study for this test (it's in a
field unrelated to your interests) and will probably flunk it.  But
you have an opportunity to copy answers from the whiz kid
sitting to you.  It is ethical, in this particular case, to do so?
   Mark Haskell Smith poses a similar question in his "Playing
God," a 1970s-style gangster drama updated to the California
of the 1990s under Andy Wilson's direction.  A surgeon has
squandered his license to practice medicine after losing a
patient while he was high on illegal drugs.  He is kidnapped
by gangsters and offered the chance to perform life-saving
surgery on some bad guys who cannot be sent to hospitals
for fear of bringing in the police.  He loves being a doctor and
can, if he chooses, decline the offer, and in the process lose
a fee of $10,000 per procedure.  Should he perform surgery
without a license under these conditions?
   The doctor in question is named Eugene Sands, played by
TV personality David Duchovny of Fox's program "The X-
Files."  He is still addicted to drugs, particularly synthetic
heroin, and when he does not have a supply handy he'll settle
for cough syrup and liquor.  He plays God in this film by
saving the life of a hoodlum who is shot in a bar (which the
doctor frequents to meet his drug contact) and by so doing
impresses the lovely Claire (the 21-year-old Angelina Jolie
here playing a 28-year-old beauty) and also a mobster known
as Raymond (Timothy Hutton).  Kidnapped by Hutton, he gets
his chance to remove bullets from baddies, live the high life in
more ways than one, and even to make goo-goo eyes at
Raymond's girlfriend, Claire.  In one case he brings a guy
back from the brink of death only to find out that the victim
was shot after he reveals information about the location of
some merchandise.
   In the press notes, a producer is quoted as saying,
"This film has some unlikely twists and nasty turns.  It's got
lies, love, action, and enough gunplay for a small Central
American war.  What more can you want?"
   Well, now, as long as you ask, for one thing we want some
dialogue.  In an effort to be California cool, Mark Haskell
Smith puts words in his people's mouths that are
embarrassing rather than chic.  Involved in a formulaic car
chase, Raymond says to his girl Claire, who is no longer
excited about being with him: "This is a car chase...I went to
considerable expense to set it up.  I've even considered
couples therapy."  For his part, the doctor intones, "Hell
doesn't always look like Hell.  On a good day it looks a lot like
L.A."
    For another thing, you could have better casting.  Timothy
Hutton will always come across better as a Vassar College
landscape instructor (Jon Robin Baitz's "The Substance of
Fire") than as a desperate, wildly envious hood in films like
this.  When Hutton contorts his face and goes into an off-the-
wall screaming act, you're tempted to say, "Wait a
minute...you're Timothy Hutton!"  And a lisping, nerdy FBI
agent played by Al Ahlf is really strange.  Is he meant to be? 
And if Raymond is chased by the FBI, why does he wind up
in a state correctional facility?
   If nothing else, the picture is politically correct.  Bad
Chinese drug dealer, good Chinese FBI man.  And Russians,
African-Americans and Latinos are cast.  Duchovny comes off
best as a low-key guy who is half good, half bad, matched by
the fickle Ms. Jolie who is good when she is with Duchovny,
bad when working the hoodlums. Rated R.  Running Time: 93
minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey Karten

Starring: David Duchovny, Timothy Hutton, Angelina Jolie
Ingredients: 
washed-up surgeon, software pirate, beautiful moll, 70s-style action
music, bantering 'Pulp Fiction' goons 
Synopsis:
In the opening scene, drug-addicted loser Eugene Sands (David Duchovny)
goes to a bar to score some synthetic heroin, but thugs burst in and
shoot the man next to him. Using a knife, tubing from a beer tap, and a
plastic water bottle, Eugene instinctively drains blood from the
punctured lung of the victim, establishing himself as a gifted former
surgeon. Philosophical insights in the form of voice narration and a
flashback inform us that the talented young Eugene is banned from the
the medical profession due to a stupid mistake: he botched an operation
while under the influence of drugs. During the rest of the movie, Eugene
performs surgery on wounded thugs and meets a series of assorted inept
criminals and bungling FBI agents. Eugene also falls in love with Claire
(Angelina Jolie), the girlfriend of Raymond (Timothy Hutton), a
smalltime software pirate. The end of the movie involves a predictable
car chase between Eugene and Raymond. Will the failed doctor be able to
get his life back on track?
Opinion:
If you are expecting a serious drama, an action extravaganza, or a
suspense flick, 'Playing God' isn't any of these. Try to imagine
Humphrey Bogart as a doctor on the skids making philosophical quips
through voice narration, and you'll get the picture. The Doc's
redemption is the theme, but somehow two-bit software pirates and a
beautiful gangster moll are thrown into the mix, not quite effectively.
The good news is that Angelina Jolie does a fine job as the beautiful
gangster moll. David Duchovny's deadpan wit and boy next door face are
just right for the down and out doctor. Timothy Hutton somehow breathes
needed life into the cardboard character of Raymond the crook. 
The bad news is that the film hasn't much sharpness or dramatic punch.
This is a redemption story about a failed doctor, but though much of the
film time is spent painting a fuzzy background subplot concerning the
plans of Russian, Chinese, and American software pirates, these plans
never get clarified. A scene where Sands is supposed to be undergoing
withdrawal symptoms from trying to kick his drug habit looks like he's
simply snoozing in bed with a lot of nearby chocolates. Small potatoes
villains don't seem very dangerous or threatening, and there are no high
stakes involved if anybody wins or loses. The ending is predictable: a
mediocre car chase. 
Despite this, if you're in the mood to watch a downed but decent doctor
redeem himself, the movie succeeds on the strength of its message.

Playing God (R) * 1/2 (out of ****)
        Buena Vista's press synopsis for Playing God labels the film "an intense
thriller," and never have publicity notes been more helpful: after watching
this aimless oddity, I could not get a handle what exactly the film is,
and, based on the mess onscreen, the filmmakers themselves did not seem to
have a clue, either.
        Playing God starts out like a thriller, with our hero, aimless junkie
Eugene Sands (David Duchovny), performing some nifty impromptu surgery on a
shooting victim in a seedy L.A. nightclub.  That grisly scene is followed
by a more straight dramatic one, when we are offered a glimpse into
Eugene's troubled past: he was once a surgeon, but he was stripped of his
medical license after doing some fatal work on a patient while under the
influence of amphetamines.  Things then shift into a more comedic gear with
the entrance of counterfeiter Raymond Blossom (Timothy Hutton), who,
impressed with Eugene's spontaneous and skillful show of surgical savvy,
takes a reluctant Eugene under his wing as a highly-paid on-call doctor who
illegally "fixes" his criminal associates after they get themselves into
bloody mishaps.  And whenever Eugene's surgical gigs take center stage, the
film takes a more blackly comic route.
        When thriller-like double-crosses by Eugene, Raymond's girlfriend Claire
(Angelina Jolie), and an FBI agent (Michael Massee) come into the picture,
it becomes quite clear that no one involved in Playing God, much less
director Andy Wilson or writer Mark Haskell Smith, has a real grasp on what
exactly the film is all about.  Not only is the film's mood and flow of
events all over the map, but without any focused direction, all of the
players attack the material from wildly different angles.  Duchovny
maintains a Fox Mulder-type balance of deadpan sarcasm and seriousness
throughout; the pouty Jolie is stiffly earnest; and Massee and especially
Hutton seemed to have wandered in from the broad comedy next door.  I
suppose the original intent of Playing God was to be a neo-noir with a
gloss of postmodern hipness, something hinted at by Eugene's coolly
detached and "ironic," if pointless, voiceover narration.  But any
discernable intentions are lost in the swirl of clashing ideas and
sensibilities.
        "A game with no rules" reads the tagline for Playing God, which can best
be described as "a film with no rules": a peculiar star vehicle for X-Files
sensation Duchovny that meanders within the territory of comedy, drama,
thriller, and just about anything under the cinematic sun with very little
rhyme and no apparent reason at all.

     THE X-FILES has been one of the hottest shows on TV for several 
seasons now, but it has taken until October 1997 for David Duchovny to 
parlay his success in a weekly series into a motion picture lead.  To be 
sure, Duchovny is no movie neophyte, but, although his resume lists a 
number of supporting performances (KALIFORNIA, for example), he has 
never before essayed a role of this magnitude.  And Duchovny is very 
good in PLAYING GOD  it's not difficult to understand his appeal in a 
recurring part.  It's just that the film's plot fails to match the 
talent of its primary acting asset.
     For that matter, it's not fair to base any of PLAYING GOD's 
failures on the performers.  Duchovny, as ex-surgeon Eugene Sands, 
creates a likable personae for a man with several fatal flaws.  Timothy 
Hutton, who was once pigeonholed into shy, quiet roles, emerges as a 
credible psycho bad guy who mixes charm with a healthy bloodlust.  It's 
refreshing to see someone other than Dennis Hopper or Ray Liotta is this 
part.  Angelina Jolie (HACKERS) is an exotic femme fatale who manages to 
appear vulnerable and mysterious at the same time.  Peter Stormare 
(Steve Buscemi's partner in FARGO) is on hand as a Russian gangster, and 
Michael Massee plays an incompetent FBI agent.
     PLAYING GOD opens with an interesting premise.  Ten months ago, Dr. 
Eugene Sands was stripped of his license to practice medicine after it 
was determined that he operated on (and lost) a patient while high on 
amphetamines.  Since then, he has been frittering his life away, 
spending money on synthetic heroin in an attempt to forget the one thing 
in his life that meant anything  his right to function as a doctor.  
One night, while in a seedy dive purchasing his latest stash of drugs, 
Eugene comes face-to-face with a gunshot victim.  Using his medical 
skills, he performs a MACGYVER-like surgery on the man (with commonly 
available implements replacing specialized tools), who survives.  Soon 
afterwards, Eugene is kidnapped and brought to the palatial beach house 
of small time criminal Raymond Blossom (Hutton), who offers Eugene a job 
as his unofficial surgeon.  The temptation to work again, as well as the 
allure of Ray's sexy mistress, Claire (Jolie), causes him to seriously 
consider the offer.
     Unfortunately, after a moderately interesting first half-hour, 
PLAYING GOD turns into a fairly routine informant-on-the-inside story 
after Eugene is "recruited" by the FBI.  There's nothing special in the 
character interaction  we get all the requisite scenes between Ray and 
Eugene, Claire and Ray, and Eugene and Claire.  And the ending, which 
involves a car chase and some gunplay, and transforms Dr. Sands into an 
action hero, could have been scripted by a high-school student.  At 
least the dialogue is smart, albeit with a Tarantino-influenced flavor.  
And, surprisingly enough, I didn't find Eugene's voiceover narrative to 
be irritating, primarily because he makes cutting observations rather 
than stating the obvious (one example:  "Hell doesn't always look like 
hell  on a good day it can look a lot like L.A.).  
     The fundamental problem with PLAYING GOD is that it doesn't do 
enough with its basic concept, and ends up becoming like dozens of other 
movies that can be found in multiplexes at any time of the year.  As a 
thriller, it's dull, and as a dramatic character study, it's shallow.  
So, although the talents of Duchovny, Jolie, and Hutton keep PLAYING GOD 
watchable, not even their performances can make this movie invigorating 
or engaging.  Put simply, PLAYING GOD is nothing more than a distraction 
that offers us an extended opportunity to see Duchovny on the big 
screen, away from THE X-FILES.

Some movies ask you to leave your brain at the door , some movies ask
you to believe in the impossible to really have a good time. Playing God
asks just one simple , eensy , teensy thing so it can fully entertain
you , it's accomplished in just four easy to follow steps: crack open
your skull , scoop out your brain , squish it under your foot several
times and reverse steps two and one. Congratulations , you now have all
the necessary requirements to fully enjoy a whole lot of nothing.
Some movies fail at the box office but you manage to see why the
producers thought it could have been a good movie , others are simply
good ideas that are badly executed. Then there's Playing God , which
enters the esteemed category of movies which seem to have grown from the
union of a drunk director , actors satisfied in the knowledge that this
horrible flick will have no lasting impact on their careers and a bunch
of rip-offs ( or homages as they like to call it ) from other , better
movies that end up looking like an unflushed toilet.
This is a movie that is not just satisfied in ripping off other movies
but feels the need to remind us of that fact every ten minutes. For
example , a gunman bursts into a garden with the two guns in his hands
firing away. This does look moderately kool , but the camera lingers on
the actor for so long you can almost hear the director yelling: "Oooh ,
look look! John Woo! Two guns blazing! Slooooow motion!"
And if that wasn't enough , you can also hear the script grunting under
the effort it must take to try and make every single line of dialogue
sound like something deep and meaningful like in a Tarantino movie. Poor
Timothy Hutton gets to deliver most of the corny lines , you have to
admire the effort he puts into it , this guy deserves better. 
Unlike most movies this one does not suffer from "stupid bad guy"
syndrome , just to make things a little different this time we get
stupid heroes. Example: Duchovny manages to distract a bad guy by making
him go into the bathroom to get some bandages. Now the bad guy is , like
, stoned , man , so he leaves his shotgun next to our hero. ( term used
as loosely as possible )
Survival instincts and a good dose of common sense seems to suggest
grabbing the shotgun , which our hero does , but only after
contemplating it for about thirty seconds. Even when he does grab it he
seems unsure how to hold it , going so far as to actually wonder if he
should place a finger near the trigger. Mind you , I've never fired a
shotgun in my life but believe you me that the bad guy would be missing
most of his vital organs , be he stoned or not.
Some will argue that our hero does not have a killer instinct , the hell
with that! Two FBI guys have just been shot in front me , along with one
bad guy and the other looks like he might go ballistic at any second.
Solution? BOOM! I'll take the time to feel sorry about it later thank
you very much. 
Another prime example of the idiot hero syndrome:
Our boy Duchovny needs to reach his girl before something bad happens to
her. He knows the head bad guy has her on the tenth floor of a building
and that he might be running into a room full of people with itchy
trigger fingers. He still has his shotgun , bring it along you say? No
thanks , I'll just ditch it in the back of my car. And the real kicker
is this: when he reaches the room and people start shooting at him he
has the nerve to look surprised!
While we are on the subject of getting shot , why in hades were those
FBI guys sitting with their backs to the door? I've got no formal
training but even I know you never sit with your back to the door. Ask
Mr. Wild Bill , the first and only time he did not sit with his back to
a wall cost him his life. This is the major problem with this movie ,
any mook could have thought of a hundred ways to make it better. Is it
so much to ask that Hollywood actually put a little common sense into
their characters? 
Our heroes hide at Duchovny's summer home , now the bad guys could come
knocking at any moment. Ok , this time our hero does get himself a gun
and has it at his side most of the time. But see , our hero is a drug
addict and guess what? He chooses now to go clean and suffer through DT.
Oh sure , he'll be really impressive when the bad guys come calling.
Going clean is really honorable of him , but I would have waited until I
did not need to be conscious or being able to fire a gun.
Rating: 1 out of 5 for an enjoyable performance by Timothy Hutton , plot
holes the size of Godzilla , getting our intelligence insulted and
several "oh come on!" moments.

One would think that David Duchovny, star of the cult favorite "X-Files"
would be very careful in choosing his leading man cinema roles. At least one
would hope so. One would be seriously incorrect.
Eugene Sands (Duchovny) is a surgeon so dedicated to his craft that he
becomes addicted to amphetamines to stay awake and work more. It turns out to
be a bad plan when he loses a patient and his license while under the influence.
Ten months later, in a seedy bar to score synthetic heroin, the doctor gets a
chance to ply his trade when assassins gun down a customer. Using a plastic
water bottle and bar tubing, Sands operates and saves his life. Smalltime
hoodlum Raymond Blossom (Timothy Hutton) is impressed with the cutlery skills
on his associate. He kidnaps and then offers down-and-out Eugene a position in
his organization.
Blossom needs a doctor to patch up gunshot victims that would be problematic
at a hospital. Sand's temptation is that this will give him a chance to
practice medicine again albeit illegally, big chunks of cash to fuel his habit
and close proximity to the gangster's womanfriend Claire (Angelina Jolie),
this film's babe factor.
The would-be big time operator is desperately in need of help. On the run
from Russian mobsters (the bad guys that seem to be all the rage in this
year's films) and trying to cut a pirate software deal with the Chinese Mafia,
Blossom is surrounded by blood.
After a few medical misadventures, the physician grows disenchanted with his
employment. An encounter with a couple of psycho surfer dudes who threaten to
blow him away unless he "fixes" their dead buddy cements his feeling that he
is in the wrong line of work. When the FBI visits and forces him to become an
informant, there is no question that he needs to be somewhere else.
Oddly enough, these seem like they could be exciting scenes. The film
disproves that assumption.
Then a bunch of other uninteresting things happen. Writing this only two days
after seeing the film, its a struggle to remember the events. You can take
that as a solid lack of recommendation.
For all the coolness that Duchovny exhibits in "X-Files", it's a surprise
that his big screen presence is so lacking in charisma. The doctor is
particularly bland and dull. Even the cold turkey bit which is rife with
dramatic possibilities come across as banal. A little chocolate and minor
sweats get him through heroin withdrawal. Like virtually everything else in
the film, it's a missed opportunity. The Fox Mulder detachment doesn't work here.
Oscar-winner Hutton's manic mobster is much more difficult to get a handle
on. Played partially for comedy and partially as crazed killer, Blossom almost
becomes real, but then sinks into goofiness. Most of the time Hutton looks as
if he's searching for his character and coming up empty.
Jolie also makes a few false moves towards creating a three-dimensional human
being before giving up and turning into scenery. The most interesting aspect
of her performance is watching her pouty lips threaten to take over the screen.
The rest aren't any better. Michael Massee's eccentric FBI agent never revs
up. One of Blossom's henchmen steals a few moments of the show as a quirky
gunman reminiscent of Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday in "Tombstone". His
two-gunned blasting as he does a bizarre dance is the high point of the film.
But that 15 seconds isn't worth sitting through the other 90 minutes.
First time film director Andy Wilson (known for his work on the British
television series "Cracker") appears to be attempting to jump on the
"Pulp Fiction" bandwagon. The best of these movies combine a sense of
style and flash with significant substance. The second-rate ones concentrate
on just one of these aspects. "Playing God" does neither well.
The basic idea of the film is solid. And then it goes nowhere. Even worse, it
plods back and forth, up and down a long and winding road before it ends up
nowhere. Fox fails yet again in his search for intelligent life.
(After over 22 years of writing this column, Michael Redman is still shocked
when good actors and a sound premise combine to create a wretched film. You'd
think he'd learn. Lesson plans can be sent to mredman@bvoice.com )

I've often wondered how silly actors feel when they narrate a movie. You know,
that voice over that explains everything going on right before your eyes -
either cluing you in on the things you can't see, catching up on all the
preliminary events, or just plain making sure you understand the scene in case
the director can't cut it. I just can't imagine standing at a microphone and
trying to *sound* like the character just talking, and not like I'm reading or
acting. At least with animated movies you can get into the character, but with
a simple narration, you're stuck.
Getting back to the actual movie at hand, PLAYING GOD starts off with David
Duchovny's voice catching us up on his character Eugene Sands' life. In an
extremely laid back Duchovny tone, we come to realize that Eugene is an ex-
doctor whose license was taken away when a patient died at his hands during
surgery. Doesn't this happen once in a while? Yes, but it just so happens that
Eugene was under the influence of narcotics at the time. Ahhh, now you see.
Duchovny rambles on as we watch his character entering an underground club in
search of synthetic heroin. It seems that the tragic event hasn't changed
Eugene's life for the better. Eugene still isn't satisfied with such natural
highs as perfecting a hook shot or bench pressing five more pounds than he did
the week before, and his idea of a snack, as an adult, is no longer cookies
and milk, but rather heroin and milk. Skip the Hershey's chocolate syrup - get
Kurt Cobain on the phone!
As Eugene drinks it up at a bar, we watch two thugs working their way thru the
raving, dimly-lit bodies on the dance floor, their hands lingering on the
insides of their sportscoats. Do you think they could have guns in there? Oh
geez! Well, before you have time to answer that, they pull out their semi-
automatics and pump a few rounds into some poor bastard standing right next to
Eugene. Unfortunately, because of all the underground dealings going on around
this club, nobody will dial 911. In a quick balancing act of morals versus
possible judicial consequences, Eugene falls to the ground and plays MacGyver
after ten years in medical school. He saves the guy's life using a plastic
water bottle to somehow prevent a collapsed lung from being fatal. Three
cheers for Dr. MacGyver, and three hallelujahs for Evian!
Time passes, and little happens in the life of Eugene. We listen to his voice
over recounting the renewed sensation of saving someone's life. He sounds like
a private investigator in some cheesy movie, using flippant metaphors and
analogies such as comparing playing doctor again to a prisoner spending one
day in the sun, making the prison seem so much more bleak. Kicking back with a
dose of heroin, Eugene falls into a deep sleep/trance providing an excellent
opportunity for a flashback to the events that *threw* Eugene from grace. We
watch as a drugged up Dr. Sands kills an already dying woman, but we soon
escape his mind trip to watch as two punks (not the thugs from before), kidnap
the unconscious doctor-no.
Eugene is taken to a beach-side property and introduced to Raymond Blossom, a
fraud catering criminal played by Timothy Hutton. Raymond ends up befriending
Eugene in a very unusual way and Eugene becomes an unofficial mob doc, getting
paid ten grand for every body he works on. Yes - every (space) body. But the
question of legalities still haunt Eugene, not to mention the quirkiness of
the criminals he's almost unwillingly getting so involved with. It seems the
one he wants to get involved with most, Raymond's girlfriend Claire (Angelina
Jolie), is the only one that seems to hate him.
PLAYING GOD is really more of a light-psychological thriller/action pic that
delves into the explication that every little thing you do, whether it seem
important or not, could affect your life in major ways. To be perfectly
honest, this mumbo-jumbo wasn't at all what I found to be worthwhile about
this film. Neither was the great acting . . . of course there wasn't much of
that to begin with. What did make this film worthwhile was it's quirky,
lighthearted yet philosophical approach to an otherwise run-of-the-mill
psychological action flick. Can you say that ten times fast?
There was nothing of high merit in this film, but I was able to sit back and
kill brain cells in a dark theater without getting bored, and that's pretty
good. It starts off a little slow and with a slight insinuation of a
potentially campy film, but it just gets better the longer you watch. Duchovny
is kind of fun even if he is drier than Death Valley. Hutton doesn't do too
bad, but is more noticeable for looking incredibly like Kevin Kline than for
his acting. Jolie is ok for being so underdeveloped, but I didn't complain
that I had to look at her.
In the end, PLAYING GOD doesn't deserve a lot, but it's fun. It's main flaw
would actually be how many plot holes and unresolved (or even never fully
developed) events and characters it has. This one ties up with many loose
ends. In other words, I'd rather hold Glad Ziplock Freezer bags above my head
than this movie, but I still think it's worth checking out when it hits home
video.
