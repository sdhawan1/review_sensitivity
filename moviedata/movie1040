The last of vampire-films offers plenty of blood and gore, but beyond that -
nothing.
Jack Crow (James Woods) is a professional vampire slayer that is secretly
working for the Vatican. His and his men's mission is to clean the earth
from vampires. They have lost count of how many vampires they have
slaughtered, but one has always escaped them. Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith ) -
the Dark Messias and ruler of the undead that is older than time itself. For
all eternity the vampires have searched for their salvation - the Black
Cross.  With the cross in their possesion, the vampires will be able to walk
in the sunlight. After that it is either the humans or the vampires who will
dominate the earth...
I have never liked John Carpenter and his style. After seeing this film, my
opinions have not changed. John Carpenter remains John Carpenter. However,
because of the film's self-irony, black humour and fascinating
cinematography, I would say that it is his greatest achievement in a long,
long time.
Neither the synopses or Carpenter's direction are original. But there are
some things that are interesting. The director's negative view on the
Catholic Church, for instance. At the end of the film it becomes clear that
Cardinal Alba (Maximilian Schell ) has simply used Crow and his team to find
Valek, so that he would gain eternal life. Otherwise the Catholic priests
are shown cool - drinking, smoking and breaking the rool of celibacy.
Carpenter has created an interesting atmosphere. Set in New Mexican dessert,
he switches between bright golden sunrises and bloody sundowns, symbolically
illustrating the good and the evil through light and darkness. More than
anything in this film, this simple illustration shows the battle between
good and evil. The cinematography by Gary B. Kibbe   is probably the film's
greatest achievement. Music (composed by John Carpenter himself) is at times
effective, the special effects and makeup are likewise worth a notice.
When it comes to the cast (in an intellectual film like this casting is the
last problem; everyone can scream and swing the axe!), but here James Woods
is suprisingly convincing. He is macho and cool as the dedicated hunter, who
lost his family to the "breed of evil". Woods is constantly overacting,
which really saves the film from falling into the trap of serious self
importance. Daniel Baldwin is also entertaining as Crow's loyal partner. The
other cast members are struggling.
Because the film doesn't take itself too seriously, it stays afloat. Still
it is like most vampire-films - a mediocre experience.

Starring: James Woods, Daniel Baldwin, Sheryl Lee, Thomas Ian Griffith.
Rated R for strong vampire violence and gore, language, sexuality and nudity.
John Carpenter directed this stylish and gory vampire flick to which has it's
good side and it's bad. It's held up by some good performances and dazzling
special effects leading up to an ending that's pretty satisfying. James Woods
gives an outstanding performance that almost covers up the movie. The good
side: some neat scenes of vampires and violence. The bad: No scares. Yes that's
right, even though being directed by one of horror's most cherished directors,
'Vampires' is the least bit scary, if not at all.
James Woods stars as Jack a vampire hunter out to stop the plans of the
'master' vampire Valek played by Thomas Ian Griffith whom wants vampires to
walk in the daylight. Daniel Baldwin plays his sidekick Montoya, a
wise-cracking guy who really isn't that funny. In the opening scene Jack along
with Montoya and the team of vampire hunters, find an abandoned house to which
vampire occupy. Of course we all know sunshine kills vampires, and that is just
how they kill these vampires: hooking them to ropes and dragging them outside
letting them burn to death.
After throwing a party for what happened, the vampires that did not die come
back to trash it. They kill almost all of Jack's team, leaving only a few
alive. Sheryl Lee plays a prostitute Katrina who was bitten by Valek, but not
yet turned into a vampire. She is rescued by Jack and  flees with them on their
search for Valek. They have to fight they're way against vampires, leading up
to a finale that is well-done with great special effects.
'Vampires' definately could have been done better. The make-up, special effects
and story are first rate, but there is no scares or terror that the film could
have had. It to me had more humor than horror, almost being compared to 'Fright
Night' with the mix of violence and comedy. John Carpenter does a great job of
directing this film. He eases through some tough times and saves the flaws,
which are noticeable but forgettable. The script is clever and funny, with many
lines that make us laugh out loud. 
I much enjoyed 'Vampires' with a few exceptions. It's one of those films you
see but don't take to heart. You enjoy the time you spent and go on. The
recently released 'Psycho' is the same way, it's not as good as you'd hope but
it is fun and entertaining. 'Vampires' is a good horror flick with no scares
but plenty of other content to please the viewer.

'Vampires' a.k.a. John Carpenter's 'Vampires' (1998)
Member of the 'Internet Movie Critics Association'
http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Studio/5713/index.html
John Carpenter's vision of the undead is very lively in his latest film
entitled 'Vampires'.  The film is based on the novel 'Vampire$' by John
Steakley and is written for the screen by Don Jakoby.  In the ads for
the film, it is labeled John Carpenter's 'Vampires'.  It is admirable
for a director to want his name on the head of a film because after all,
he IS supposed to be proud of his work but what puzzled about the film
was Carpenter's lack of restraint which is filled with an unusual amount
of gore for a John Carpenter film.  For a vampire flick, the film looks
heavily influenced by 1996's 'From Dusk Till Dawn' which had enough wild
bloody gore to fill a dozen movies.
James Woods, who likes to make up many of his own 'in your face' remarks
in improvised dialogue, stars as a vampire killer, raised and trained by
the Catholic church to destroy vampires moving around all parts of the
globe.  The film tries to cast off stereotypes that have carried
vampires throughout film history.  Woods says that crosses don't work
and other stereotypes are cast off as well.  There is a new breed of
vampire on the loose that can walk around in the daylight.
Traveling through New Mexico as the film opens, Woods and his gang of
vampire killers include an army of "soldiers" and Daniel Baldwin plays
Woods' right hand man and Gregory Sierra plays a priest re-cruited by
the church to aid Woods on his hunt to destroy the unholy beasts.
Thomas Ian Griffith plays Valek, the First Vampire who has lived for 600
years and who has been the influence for all vampires created throughout
history.  No vampire film I've ever seen has taken on such a powerful
presence of the villain's profile as this film does.  Valek and his army
of the undead are after a relic in the form of a black cross that will
give them special power.  The vampires in this film are extremely hard
to kill and Valek is practically invincible.
One night, at a victory party of sorts after Woods and his army destroy
a nest belonging to Valek, Valek rises to literally crash the party and
kill almost all the vampire slayers.  Valek sinks his fangs into a young
prostitute at the party played by Sheryl Lee and her transformation will
not take place right away and Baldwin sort of falls for her and tries to
protect her from the transformation.
Two other characters are key to the film's outcome and wild but
predictable climax.  Maximilian Schell plays a high ranking Cardinal in
the church who oversees Woods' assignment and Tim Guinee plays a priest
who is rather timid in his initial work with Woods.
'Vampires' uses an over-the-top approach to win over the audience and
its timing to open at Halloween is no doubt a good marketing strategy
but the film comes up short.  Its problem is that it's static and
suffers from a one track mind in its approach to the subject matter.
Francis Ford Coppola's vision of 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' in 1992 was
stunning and captured an enormous amount of erotica contained in the
novel.  Even Robert Rodriguez's 'From Dusk Till Dawn' used its first
half as a crime drama and took a bizarre turn in the second half.  A
young person's vampire flick in 1985 called 'Fright Night' had Chris
Sarandon as a ghoulish type of vampire who wore designer clothes and
romped about with an obnoxious personality.
'Vampires' becomes very tiresome after its first 45 minutes and it
eventually runs out of steam and its lack of good character development
is further complicated by repetitive scenes of visual gore and Carpenter
has always been a visual director whose talents, like Brian De Palma and
Peter Hyams, might have been better served on weekly formula television
shows or the world of music videos because these directors and their
lack of sub text are below average at best.

Why are vampires so popular?  Why are so many people obsessed with the
idea of human-like creatures that suck blood in order to survive?  Why
does anyone care about garlic and holy water and crosses and sunlight? 
Why are there people who dress in black and put on white makeup to go
see a movie about vampires?  There are people in this world who believe
that vampires do, in fact, exist.  This is a sickness.  It's an
obsession.  And I, unfortunately, just don't get it.  Perhaps I
shouldn't get it -- maybe I'm not supposed to.  Vampires don't interest
me.  They don't interest me because they don't exist.  I can watch a
movie about vampires and be entertained, but my attraction to the
subject goes no further.  
The title of John Carpenter's Vampires is no joke:  this film has
vampires.  It's all about vampires.  There are vampires in every shot. 
Vampires get slaughtered on a regular basis.  It's rare that Carpenter
lets two minutes pass without showing us macho dudes decapitating
vampires, or macho dudes driving stakes through vampires' hearts, or
macho dudes dragging vampires out into the sun so the vampires can
explode.  But if you look past the vampire motif, what you have is a
predictable and disappointing gore-fest:  Carpenter has done better than
this.  Vampires starts out interesting, incorporating the violence with
offbeat humor.  By the end, though, the violence overtakes the humor,
and we're left with a corny vampire flick drowning in an ocean of
wretched excess.
And at the center of the excess is James Woods, playing super-duper
vampire hunter Jack Crow with the kind of energy we've come to expect
from a James Woods performance.  Like most vampire hunters, Jack has a
deep-seated hatred for vampires, because they had something to do with
the death of his family.  He's one macho dude, too, because he's willing
to kill anyone or anything in order to get what he wants.  After an
introduction in which we see Jack and his group of hunters kill a bunch
of vampires, Jack's group is quickly eradicated by the vampire master,
Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith).  So, with only his trusty sidekick, Tony
Montoya (Daniel Baldwin) and a soon-to-be-vampire prostitute (Sheryl
Lee), Jack heads out to kill Valek.
I think Carpenter knows how silly the entire vampire thing is.  I sure
hope he does, anyway.  I realize I'm probably offending one in ten
people who might read this review, but I just can't help it.  I find
this obsession with vampires deeply confounding.  Carpenter, who has
made some good movies (The Thing and Escape From [wherever] come to
mind), begins Vampires with the right tone:  it's funny and
appropriately tongue-in-cheek.  The violence is so extreme that we can't
possibly believe it (Valek actually splits a guy in half with his
fingernails).  And some of the one-liners are pretty good.
But the story isn't very interesting, and Carpenter can't maintain the
humorous tone to the end.  A major problem lies in the Jack character,
who just isn't very nice or sympathetic.  Later in the film, when a
young priest (Tim Guinee) tags along, Jack becomes a rather hateful guy
(the bathroom interrogation scene is brutally unpleasant).  And the
violence takes hold of the film by the climactic scene, proving that a
vampire movie can not keep from coming across as pornography for the
violence-obsessed.  (There's a scene that features gratuitous slaying of
dozens of monks, and to call this "exploitative" would be excessively
kind.)
And, based on this film alone, I would hypothesize that Carpenter is
somewhat of a misogynist.  The only non-vampire women in the picture are
prostitutes (referred to by the male characters only as "whores");
Sheryl Lee's character is slapped around by the Baldwin character, and
then we're supposed to believe that they love each other.  Most of the
vampires who blow up due to sunlight exposure are women, screaming
wildly and relentlessly.  Vampires isn't social commentary, and I doubt
that Carpenter consciously decided to uphold a "hatred of women"
stance.  It's just one more element that adds to the generally
unpleasant tone of the film.
It's a good thing Woods is the star; he's really the only actor who can
rise above the mediocre dialogue and characterizations.  Baldwin is a
watchable presence, but doesn't do much acting.  Lee is on hand simply
for aesthetics.  Griffith is actually good as a vampire, but, with two
lines a dialogue, he doesn't prove himself as a thespian.  All things
considered, Vampires is just another vampire movie:   thoughtless and
excessive pornography.  If vampires were real, I might be a little more
kind to the film:  it does, after all, offer a few new insights into the
breeding habits of the blood-sucking creatures.  But, seeing as how
vampires don't exist, I'm left wishing that Carpenter had made a movie
that doesn't just appeal to the people who will dress up to see it.

     It's refreshing to see a film about vampires that's actually about
vampires.  Not vampirism as a metaphor for AIDS, not vampirism as a
metaphor for drug addiction, not vampirism as a metaphor for persecuted
minority groups, or as a metaphor for anything else -- just blood-suckin',
sun-hatin', butt-kickin' vampires.  JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES is the kind
of slick horror package that's increasingly hard to find:  raucous,
sanguine and almost utterly devoid of sociological sub-text.
     Based on John Steakley's novel _Vampire$_, it incorporates that
oh-so-90s-vogue vocation of vampire hunting into the context of an old
spaghetti Western.  Jack Crow (James Woods) is one of many vampire hunters
on a Vatican-funded mission to eradicate the plague of the undead.  One
night his team is obliterated by Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith), the oldest
vampire ever to walk the earth.  Crow and his one surviving associate
Montoya (Daniel Baldwin), accompanied by newly-recruited young priest
Father Guiteau (Tim Guinee), have to find Valek and kill him before he can
locate a mysterious relic which might give him the power to walk in the
daylight.  Add plenty of flying body parts, stark Western vistas and
Carpenter's own twangy Tex-Mex score, and you have a simple, economical
horror yarn.
     It all makes for fine gruesome entertainment, but it should have been
better.  John Carpenter has always been able to incorporate wry, weird
humor into his films -- remember the crawling head in THE THING, or
practically all of BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA, for that matter? -- and he
manages again to pull of a few nice bits of black comedy.  Woods, playing
Crow with snarling relish and a serious bad attitude, gets most of the
choice lines, all of which are either unprintable or incredibly offensive
or both.  Carpenter's sense of the horrific usually involves a kind of
self-aware outrageousness, turning his displays of blood-spraying special
effects into absurdist cinematic goofs too purely escapist to get worked
up over.
     Unfortunately, VAMPIRES keeps upsetting its delicate balance of humor
and horror by taking frequent detours into mean-spiritedness.  It's one
thing to play with notions of political incorrectness; it's quite another
to get off on it.  The only human female characters in VAMPIRES are
hookers who hang around just long enough to get naked and get turned into
lunchmeat; when Woods really wants to insult someone, a bit of gay-baiting
always fits the bill.  Even if you grant Carpenter and screenwriter Don
Jakoby the slack they seem to be searching for -- it's okay that a woman
is stripped and smacked around because she's a vampire-in-waiting, and
it's okay that a Catholic priest participates in a human sacrifice because
another priest is a stand-up guy -- the tone simply gets nastier than it
needs to be.  Everyone is too unpleasant too often.
     The thing about VAMPIRES is that when Carpenter rolls up his sleeves
and dives into genre action, it's a lot of fun.  In fact, if he had rolled
with the tone of the first 25 minutes, he might have had a minor classic
on his hands.  The opening assault on a New Mexico vampire "nest" is wild,
silly and superbly paced; Valek's first attack is a creepy and crafty
splatter-fest.  From there, VAMPIRES gets progressively more angry and
ominous, before it finally rights itself for the climactic confrontation
between Crow and Valek.  There's not enough interest in characterization
here to make the casual brutality of Crow and Montoya somehow
psychologically appropriate.  Psychology's got virtually nothing to do
with JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES, a slice of Halloween mayhem that works
wonderfully when it lets the good times roll.  For a vampire movie without
a "message," it offers some mixed messages it could do without.

Director: John Carpenter.
Vampire's is a rude, chauvinistic movie where women are portrayed as
pawns of abuse, present only to pleasure men, feed vampires, readied to
be bashed or beaten - till one's sensibilities is shocked by the low IQ
and mentality of this regressive movie. To make matters worse, the
buffoons that go hunting vampires are all rednecks, and deserve to have
their heads bitten off, if not, their bodies carved in half. The dilemma
of hating the heroes' as much as the villains', makes one wish that
the Hand of God' would suddenly appear and blast both parties into
oblivion. James Wood portrays Jack Crow, a man obsessed with killing
vampires, whose soul reason for living is based on revenge (they killed
his parents), but this is not a good excuse for being more obnoxious
than the vampires. As for Adam Baldwin, he is nothing more than a stooge
who is ordered to beat women when the director shouts action', and the
script should have been reworked to avoid much offence against the
female sex. As for the claims that the Catholic Church created
Dracula', well that is the second most sacrilegious suggestion, outside
the fact that priests and monks bear the brunt of the vampire fury, with
enough blood spilt to make the inquisition look tame. An awful movie on
all counts, my suggestion is to bring back Buffy and bury this group of
incompetent, rude vampire slayers.

 I want to say this at the outset: I think John Carpenter is a genius.
Anyone who could almost single-handedly create the modern horror film
(Halloween), entertain with an action movie while, at the same time,
infusing that action with a decidedly un-'80s liberalism (Escape from New
York) and, of course, presciently incorporate Hong Kong filmic traditions in
an American movie years before anyone else thought to (Big Trouble in Little
China) has to know something the rest of us don't.  Put simply: I always
look forward to John Carpenter's movies.  I want them to be good.
 Unfortunately, Carpenter's doing his best to tear down his rep and burn the
rubble.  His sequel to Escape, the pathetic Escape from LA, was as cheap and
exploitative as sequels get without having the name Charles Band attached to
it.  And now John Carpenter's Vampires, while not being that bad, isn't
great, either.
 Based on the novel by John Steakley (no pun intended - I hope), Vampires is
another attempt by Carpenter to mold the sensibilities of the classic
western to the skeleton of another genre.  Jack Crow, played with typical
flair by James Woods, is the head of a Vatican-sponsored vampire-hunting
squad.  The squad's a tough bunch of hombres, travelling from town to town
doing what needs to be done.  They're a modern Wild Bunch, living more or
less outside the law, boozing and whoring and being real men.  To an extent,
this works.
 Vampires opens with Team Crow busting open a vampire nest in some New
Mexican jerkwater.  Crow and his boys work with brutal efficiency, flushing
and killing.  It's a solid piece of work, juxtaposing the violence inside
the nest with the presence of a priest outside, blessing the charred remains
of the undead.  The entire sequence has a nasty bestiality that displays the
skill Carpenter has when he really has something solid to work with.
 After this, however, the movie begins to decay.  Following the raid, the
master of this vampire pack (and, apparently, all vampires - played by an
almost unrecognizable Thomas Ian Griffith) takes out Team Crow.  Crow is put
on the run with the last member of his team, Montoya (Daniel Baldwin) and a
hooker (Sheryl Lee) "infected" by the master and linked to him
telepathically, a la Mina Harker in Bram Stoker's Dracula.
 Bizarrely, since the movie runs 107 minutes, not much else happens in
Vampires.  Jack Crow makes contact with the Church and learns the origin of
Griffith's super-vampire, gets a fresh new priest in the person of Tim
Guinee and wanders around doing this and that.  Meanwhile, a sort-of romance
blooms between Montoya and Lee's Katrina, even as Katrina comes closer and
closer to full vampirism.  It's... it's boring.
 Only at the very end, in the last ten or so minutes, does Carpenter's film
regain the momentum it started with, though even this is inexpertly handled.
Large parts of the massive "slayers versus the vampires" climax are done in
an abstract, montage fashion.  Very disappointing.
 This is even more of a letdown when taken in the context of Carpenter's
carefully-staged camera work and the sharp performances from the cast.  Even
Daniel Baldwin, the oft-overlooked Baldwin brother, puts together some good
moments.  But where's the script?  Where's the good stuff?  Where's the John
Carpenter genius that turns an ordinary story into something special?
Vampires is simply parts looking for a whole.

Vampire films, today, are about as passe' as Westerns. The genre has been
revisited so many times with so many incarnations that their seems very
little left to derive from the classic creature. The history of the
creature goes far back into mans past. Legends and mythologies abounding in
many different cultures in every part of the globe. All of these various
incarnations of vampiric ancestry all deal with two basic tenants.. first
they all live off the blood of the living. Secondly, they are the polar
opposite of religious faith.
With John Carpenter's latest release "VAMPIRES", we are given a slightly
new variation of the Vampire myth. One which is so intriguing and thought
provoking as to be worthy of a film all it's own.
The film opens in New Mexico where a distaff group of mercenaries approach
a dilapidated home in an abandoned town. We are introduced to Jack Crow
(marvelously played by James Woods), through a series of ever increasing
close ups, while his team prepares for what may well be Armageddon. Without
a line of dialogue, Jack Crow is shown to be a man driven by a revenge so
all encompassing,  that the simplest human courtesies are almost
non-existent.
The raid on the house reveals it to be a nest of vampires. They are
systematically shoot staked and dragged out into the afternoon sunlight,
with only the slightest concern of faith. The lone Priest (Thomas Rosales),
with the group, performs an almost indifferent last rite as each Vampire is
burned. After the siege, Jack Crow is still curious as to why these
vampires were only minions and that there was no master vampire at the
site.
During a celebratory party at a small hotel on the outskirts of a small
town, the Master Vampire shows himself. Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith) firstly
attacks Katrina (Sheryl Lee), a prostitute, while she waits for Jack in
another room. As the vampire hunters celebrate, Valek attacks, viciously
eviscerating the team, leaving only Jack Crow and second in command Tony
Montoya (Daniel Baldwin) alive. Rescuing Katrina, the three men escape as
the sun rises, leaven them safe from Valek's attack.
It is from here that the film starts to take a turn with it's plot. There
is a growing sense of conspiracy throughout the film, as information is
given in only tensely voiced bits of dialogue. Returning to the a Church,
Jack Crow receives orders to assemble a new team of vampire hunters.
Balking at the orders, he leaves put is saddled with a new Priest, Father
Adam Guiteau (Tim Guinee), who may know more about the situation than he
claims.
"Vampires" is more of an action film than a tried and true horror exercise.
If a comparison needed to be made, you could compare the film to 'From Dusk
'Till Dawn', but that would be doing this film a great disservice.
Carpenter's direction and manipulation of the plot is as intricate as
anything he has done. He discloses only enough information as to propel the
story forward, much in the way that John Ford (or a better comparison,
Samuel Fuller) would. This leaves the viewer with much grist to contemplate
after the film has ended. As Carpenter has done before, with such films as
"Assault on Precinct 13", "Prince of Darkness" and "They Live"; all we know
of the villain is a cursory biography of what made them what they are and
what their ultimate goal is. Carpenter's villains are always purely evil,
and completely self absorbed.
James Woods is one of the most underrated character actors in the business.
His portrayal of Jack Crow is a man caught between two worlds. His
affiliation with the Church is at complete odds with his life style. He
curses, drinks, and coerces others into a life of sin. This is a man who is
not fighting for his soul, because he lost it at childhood. He's soul
purpose in life is death.
Daniel Baldwin as Tony Montoya is an interesting characterization. Here is
a man with no emotional connection to anyone until he is forced by
infection to. His relationship with the vampirized Katrina is almost
heartbreaking. While Baldwin does a capable job, the part could have used a
more intuitive performance.
Sheryl Lee as Katrina is the most underwritten character in the film. We
really know nothing about her other than she is a prostitute. What Ms. Lee
is able to do with this role is outright remarkable. Her change from fear
and loathing to acceptance is remarkably subtle and believable. Here is a
woman who would rather die than face the immortality promised by Vampirism.
There is a nice Aids parallel here in that those who face the disease must
cope with the fact that they will always have it and that they will always
be under treatment. Death is no longer as fearful, as the prospect of
needing constant treatment for the disease.
The sole disappointment in the film is Thomas Ian Griffin as the vampire,
Valek. While Mr. Griffin does a more than a capable job of bringing
passionate life to the character; Valek is so underwritten as to be
obviously nothing more than what could be called a McGuffin. A plot device
used solely to propel the plot forward. There are some wonderful thoughts
brought up about the character, but we are told nothing more than what is
needed to move the plot towards it's unequivocal end.
The script by Dan Jacoby does a fine job of redefining the vampire
mythology. WE are told that these creatures do not respond to anything
other than being staked in the heart or being dragged into the sunlight.
Religious beliefs have no effect as the creatures were created as a result
of the Church. This is one of the most fascinating indictments of religion
ever put on screen. While completely fictional, it does bring up questions
about the role of the Church in world economics and politics.
How does this film fit into John Carpenter's overe? The best answer is very
well. The film continues his subversive slant on moral doctrine and
complacency. He shows his characters drinking and carousing with
prostitutes all in the presents of a priest. These men have no boundaries
concerning themselves. While they have a familial respect and camaraderie
to one another, their only concern is on personal freedom. Vampirism from
that point of view becomes pure subservient, completely destroying the
individual to become nothing more than a servant or slave to the Vampire
master. Is "Vampires' political in tone. Yes, very much so. But it's
politics are subliminal, never intruding on the story. But they are always
there in subtext, strong and willful.
"Vampires" is a very enjoyable film. Taken as a purely escapist  romp, the
film serves up it's action and horror set pieces with a verve and passion
that delivers. 'Vampires' also delivers in ways unexpected. You may find
yourself talking about the film long after you've left the theater.
On a scale of 1 to 5, "John Carpenter's VAMPIRES" rates a solid 4. Rated
'R' for extreme violence, nudity and profanity.

REVIEW: John Carpenter's Vampires
By Luke Buckmaster (bucky@alphalink.com.au)
Cast: James Woods, Daniel Baldwin, Sheryl Lee, Thomas Ian Griffith, Tim
Guinee, Maximilian Schell
Director: John Carpenter
Producer: Sandy King
Screenplay: Don Jakoby based on the novel "Vampire$" by John Steakley
Australian theatrical release: December 10, 1998
On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
2 and a half stars
The most astonishing thing about John Carpenter's Vampires isn't that it
gives a new spin on the classic legend, nor that its special effects are
particularly glamorous or its acting well performed.  It is how Village
Roadshow managed to produce a twenty-eight-page press kit that amazes
me.  Full of juicy tidbits of information -- including the production
crew's opinions on the sex life of vampires, and how none of the cast
"were particularly crazy about being burned alive" -- the press kit
provides just as many laughs as the movie.  But are we laughing for the
right reasons?
Probably not, given the nature of director John Carpenter's material -
vampires.  But in the cosmos of this film, garlic and crosses are futile
against the blood-sucking enemy.  The easiest way for slayer Jack Crow
(James Woods) and his team to murder the undead is to drag 'em out into
the sunlight.  So you can imagine how they feel when they learn of the
legendary Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith) - the first vampire in recorded
history - and his plan to give vampires the power to walk in daylight.
This plan involves the use of a mysterious religious artifact named the
Berziers Cross, and an eerie ritual using the blood of a slayer.
If you're expecting a tale as entertaining as, say, From Dusk Till Dawn,
or a story board as darkly comic as Blade, think again.  Vampires is a
"real" slayer flick, with only one intention: to showcase as many
vampire hunts as possible, whilst still remaining within the borders of
a basic narrative.
Trouble is, John Carpenter seems to forget that even horror films need
well constructed action scenes.  Even greater a problem is that killing
vampires just doesn't seem enough of an idea to warrant a film, even
though the screenplay was adapted from the novel Vampire$, by John
Steakley.  Valek's quest to give the vampires ultimate power is not much
more than one of the screenplay's many plot props; a set up which
deliberately helps builds up to a heroic climax.
In some ways, James Woods seems perfect for his role.  His western macho
man portrayal is simplistic and one dimensional, but strangely
compelling.   You get the feeling that this is the type of role that
could have gone to Kurt Russel, or Clint Eastwood a couple of decades
ago.  Another interesting screen persona is played by Sheryl Lee, who is
a hooker that gets bitten by Valek, and is irresistible to watch as her
transformation from human to vampire takes place.
Even if Vampires is nothing more than an average genre flick, at least
John Carpenter has been smart enough not to take himself too seriously.
The gothic western setting never seems entirely believable, nor totally
unimaginable.  It's just a place that suits Crow's belt and jacket, and
serves as a modern surrounding to an old fashioned, often-hilarious
tale.  But are we laughing for the right reasons?

Directed by John Carpenter. Written by Don Jakoby. Based on the novel
Vampire$ by John Steakley. Running time: 107 minutes. Rated R (for
strong vampire violence and gore, language and sexuality).
Vampires have been shown in movies through the years as blood-sucking
demons that prowl the night looking for a snack. The film's have ranged
from very good (Bram Stoker's Dracula) to just awful (Once Bitten).
Recently though, vampires have been very big. "Buffy, the Vampire
Slayer" is a huge TV hit and Blade did a bang-up job at the box office.
Now the most liked horror director has put his touch on the genre.
John Carpenter's Vampires is about Jack Crow (James Woods) who along
with a group of a dozen or so hunt down vampire nests. They use a
variety of automatic weapons (but they have to use a wooden stake also)
to beat up the vampires. They then use a pulley system to drag the vamps
into daylight which causes them to explode in a big fiery mess.
Jack Crow is your typical nonhero character. Carpenter has used this
character before in Escape from New York and Escape from L.A.. Crow is
so much like Kurt Russell's character in those two movies it makes you
wonder if Carpenter is losing originality. The only addition to the
character is that now he sounds like a Howard Stern wannabe. He drinks,
he swears, and he makes inappropriate conversations with priests.
After a tough day of work Crow and his team party at a nearby motel.
They are interrupted by a vampire named Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith), who
can't be hurt by automatic weapons or stakes, who brutally murders the
group. The only surviving members of the massacre are Crow, his right
hand man Montoya (Daniel Baldwin), and a hooker named Katrinia (Sheryl
Lee) who just happened to be at the party.
After Crow consults with his church "sponsors" who pay for the
destruction of the vampires, he finds out that Valek was the first
vampire ever. He plans to find a black cross and when he finds it he
will be able to create a new race of super vampires which can walk the
day. Katrinia, while at the party, was bitten by Valek before he took
out the rest of the group. She has 2 days before the vampire 'virus'
overcomes her. In these 2 days she is able to have a physic link with
Valek and is able to see what he sees. Crow and Montayo use this to stop
the evil vampire from destroying the world.
John Carpenter is one of the most well liked director's in the
horror/sci-fi/action genre. He has made such classics as Halloween and
The Thing (not 1951 version). His 70s and 80s collection of films have
developed a huge following by fans of the genre. Then the 90s came
around and his movies
went into the toilet. No J.C. film in the 90s has been worthwhile.
Vampires is quite a bit better than most of his productions of this
decade but that's not saying much.
What Carpenter was known for is the horror classic Halloween. In that
movie he relied heavily on tense music (which he almost always creates
himself) and wonderfully made scenes to the scare the heck out of
everyone. Although Halloween is a violent movie with a pretty high body
count, the film didn't rely on gore to create scary situations. Vampires
believes that if we see a vampire knock a priest's head off with bloody
results we are going to be scared. This is not true.
Another major complaint I have with the film though is the villain.
Valek just isn't that good of a villain. He's your tired old character
who is indestructible and will stop at nothing to rid the world of good
guys. He vanishes from the screen many times in this movie for 15
minutes sometimes. Then when he reappears he just kills a church member
who is in his way (seen mostly through psychic images in Katrinia's
mind) and then disappears.
Of course Vampires isn't all bad. Woods does a good job as the anti-hero
and will no doubt be well liked by Carpenter fans. The vampire hunting
sequences (which are suprisingly short and far apart) are cool. They are
brutal fights with machine guns firing everywhere and vampires erupting
in fire. Scenes of Crow burying his dead group members are great. I can
just barely recommend this movie to fans of John Carpenter or of violent
action/horror movies.
Vampires, had it been done more originally, could have been a great
horror film and one of Carpenter's best. But it is currently just a
mixed bag of a movie that supplies some quick small thrills and is
easily forgotten.

I'm a child of the 80s. I like my horror movies, and I like them cheesy.
They're not scary to me, they're excuses to get a little closer with my
girlfriend, they're ways to enjoy sick comedy in the theatre while the idiot
girl's getting gutted. They're my reminder that fiction is more fun than
fact. I like them quick, I like them gory, and I like them campy. All of
those adjectives are words you can tack on to John Carpenter's Vampires.
Now anyone who has read my review on Halloween will know that I hold this
man in no reverence. To be honest, I pretty much hate the bastard. But, I do
admit his prowess behind the camera and his ability to scare, although not
his creative ability. But this time, he didn't pen the screenplay, so I'm
happy. I don't hate his style, I hate his original material. After all, has
anyone seen Jim Carrey or Pauly Shore's standup? It sucks. Are they funny
people, yes.
In Vampires the Roman Catholic Church has gone beyond garlic and crosses and
exorcisms as a way of fighting evil, it's headed into the dark and dismal
hiring of a gun-ho team of slayers to kill the bloodsuckers. I suppose it
had to be coming, after all, they are an infestation and the Catholic Church
has to do something about it. Of course the people doing the slaying are
more sinners than saints, but that makes 'em all the more fun to watch. We
have James Woods (Contact) heading up the team with the fourth Baldwin,
namely Daniel (Born on the Fourth of July in a bit role as a vet), who spend
they're days smoking cigarettes, watching Kaptain Kangaroo, and kicking the
shit out of vampires. Of course, vampire Master Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith)
kills all of the slaying team except for Jimmy and Danny, and only bites
Sheryl Lee (Twin Peaks) (but he's biting her on the inner thigh, hell, I'd
do that).
So, while Little Ms. Wrapped In Plastic is growing fangs they use a
telepathic link to track the Master Vampire down, hopefully before he can
get a cross that would let him walk in daylight. But, about him walking in
daylight, I wouldn't be too worried: you'd spot him a mile away.
It's got blood, it's got guts, it's got campfire humor and sinful psychosis.
It's only a matter of time before it's declared a sacrilege. So did I like
it? Do ya really have to ask?

John Carpenter, the master of horror flicks, including the original
HALLOWEEN, is back with an impressive and surprisingly good picture,
which modestly goes by the full title of JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES.
VAMPIRES, a film smart enough to never take itself seriously, is a fun
romp of a motion picture. Redefining and enlivening the vampire genre,
Carpenter blends in lavish doses of humor along with an intriguing
story. If you're used to vampire pictures that work only at the shock
level, you will likely find that VAMPIRES does everything but scare you.
While you're not likely to be frightened, you will find yourself
laughing and being wrapped up in the engrossing story. Don Jakoby's
script, based on the novel "Vampire$" by John Steakley, has a
fascinating mix of mystery and humor.
The marvelous actor James Woods plays Jack Crow, the leader of one of
the Vatican's groups of "slayers." Slayers search the world looking for
"nests" of vampires, in which one vampire "master" leads a group of
vampire "goons." Once they've cleaned out a nest, making sure to kill
the master, the slayers move on.
Regardless of what you heard, we learn that vampires are not impressed
with garlic or crosses. Only a stake through the heart or the light of
day can kill them.
The movie opens with a slender, rough-looking Jack Crow, dressed in
jeans and leather, leading a rag-tag band of slayers as they attack a
nest hidden in an old house. Jack carries a large, shiny chrome power
bow, and his men, who come with him in an old armored car, carry weapons
that would make Dirty Harry proud. Although they can't kill vampires
with big guns, they can at least slow them down until Jack spears them,
thus allowing Tony Montoya (Daniel Baldwin) to drag them into the
sunlight. The arrows, you see, are attached to steel cables, which run
to an old-fashion winch on Tony's jeep. The winch will experience
mechanical difficulties more than once, causing panic and humorous
expletives.
As soon as the vampires are outside in the daylight, they are burned to
a crisp. Jack has colorful and unprintable descriptions for all of their
activities. Woods has a ball in a role that feeds him a stream of great
one-liners and generally lets him ham it up.
Thomas Ian Griffith plays Valek, the superman master of the vampire
world. Originally from the fourteenth century, Valek was the very first
vampire, and, unlike other masters, he's (almost) impossible to kill.
When Jack comes up against Valek, he faces his greatest challenge ever.
Before he can find and kill Valek, he must first solve the mystery of
what Valek and his band of fellow masters are after. The mystery has
elements that include a logarithmic spiral of attacks.
Although bodies are indeed ripped apart in the gory fashion of
traditional horror movies, Carpenter pulls the camera away before we are
too grossed out.
The best subplot has BACKBEAT's Sheryl Lee playing a sexy blonde hooker
named Katrina, who has the misfortune to have been bitten by Valek.
"Bitten" does not exactly cover what happens. It is more that she has a
perverse form of non-consensual sex with Valek. The upshot of that
liaison is that they have a mind meld. Jack then tries to use her to get
to Valek.
As the vampire virus periodically rages through Katrina's bloodstream,
she goes into wild, spastic orgasms. Lee takes a part that could have
been a cliche and makes her character instead sympathetic and smart.
The film has a handsome look and great electronic guitar music.
Thankfully absent is the overabundance of special effects that most
directors fall back on today.
Even if the demographics for vampire movies are normally limited, this
one has the potential to please a wide variety of filmgoers since
Carpenter does such a masterful job of invigorating a moribund genre.
Although not quite as good as the vampire movie HABIT, just released
this week on video, VAMPIRES is a wonderfully entertaining movie that
will pleasantly surprise those who see it.
JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES runs 1:47. It is rated R for horror film gore,
profanity, sex and nudity and would be fine for older teenagers.

Don't let the title fool you -- Vampires is not a horror film. Vampires is
a Western set in modern times where the good guys carry big silver
crossbows and the bad guys wear long incisors. Plotless and mindless,
Vampires is proof that a good director, actor and film personality can make
a testosterone-laden movie entertaining.
Jack Crow (James Woods) is a vampire slayer. Scratch that, Crow is a
vampire slayer with a serious attitude. Having seen his mother and father
fall to vampires, Crow has his mind set on killing all vampires. From
childhood, the Catholic Church has raised Crow to be a vampire slayer. The
Catholic Church, from an exorcism gone awry, created the first vampire,
Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith), centuries ago. As the movie opens, Crow and
his team go into action by taking out a whole house of vampires.
After the house incident, Crow has a nasty run in with Valek. Valek is the
most powerful vampire because he was the first. Valek escapes Crow's first
attempt to take him out, though Valek ends up biting a hooker before his
getaway. Crow uses the hooker (Sheryl Lee) as a vampire-radar of sorts.
After being bitten by a vampire, a person doesn't turn into a vampire
immediately. There is a period before the bitten person "turns." During
this crucial time a telepathic link is set up between the bitten and the
master (the vampire who did the biting). Crow uses the hooker to track down
Valek.
As I mentioned, Vampires is proof of what a good director, good actor and
film personality can do to enhance a film. Last week I saw Soldier, a
terrible film; the director was a rookie, the lead actor didn't have much
to work with, and the film had no personality. Vampires has all three.
Director John Carpenter knows how to put together some exciting scenes 
though, his pacing for the film as a whole is off. Carpenter mixes the
right amount of action, horror, and humor for the action scenes, and he
builds a lot of tension. But, he is unable to pace the film correctly. The
best parts of the film are the opening vampire hunt and the last
thirty-five minutes. The middle section of Vampires is slow and sometimes
painfully so. Had Carpenter taken the movie and distilled it - stripped it
of the useless character development and the love story  it would have
been to die for. The opening vampire hunt is gory with vampires dragged
into the sun and burned instantly to a crisp. There are other extremely
gory scenes, like a man split in half, all shown onscreen. This is
definitely not a movie for the squeamish.
The second thing that Vampires has is James Woods. Woods brings to screen a
brash will-take-no-crap attitude that is used effectively as a tool of
humor. I loved the way that Woods breaks in the new priest and how he later
deals with the master vampires. Woods brings a personality to the character
Jack Crow that would have been lacking if another actor attempted the part.
Woods just drips of coolness onscreen; he's cool, tough, and arrogant.
There would be no other actor better for the part of Jack Crow.
The personality of a film is important. Take for example, Soldier, the film
had no personality - it was bland. Vampires, on the other hand, has
personality. The mixture of Woods, the way the film was shot, the lone
guitar in the film score, and the sure-handedness of Carpenter's direction
all add up to make this movie enjoyable.
Vampires is not Carpenter's best work, but it's also not Carpenter's worst
work either. Ranking at the top is Carpenter's The Thing, Halloween, Escape
from New York, and Escape from LA. Vampires is a middle-of-the-road,
average Carpenter film.
Would I recommend Vampires? Definitely, it's an entertaining film. For
those of you worried that Vampires is a scary horror film, it's not 
though it is quite gory. I enjoyed Vampires because it's a modern Western
where the bad guys are vampires. If you have two hours to spare, catch
Vampires in the theatres.
[Rated R  Violence, Excessive Gore, and Nudity. Running Time: 107 Minutes]

     VAMPIRES starts out almost in the style of a spaghetti Western
with an attack on a small homestead in New Mexico.  The house has a
nest of vampires and Jack Crow (James Woods) is leading a team of
vampire hunters in to clean them out.  While the initial imagery is a
little over-dramatic, it gives way to what is a fairly decent action
sequence.  That is enough action to last us a while and we could,
director John Carpenter would let us, get to a story line.  But it is
not very long and there is not much plot until the next big action
scene.  Then there is only a bit more of plot before the next action
scene after that.  The plot is kept to a minimum and the interesting
ideas in the plot really get the short end.  And that is something of a
pity because the film, based on the book VAMPIRE$ by John Steakley,
gives us a myth for the origins of vampires and explains why vampires
are so intertwined with religious imagery.  This could be an
interesting departure from the standard vampire film, but Carpenter
decides to tell us about it rather than to show it. What Carpenter
saves his serious screen time for a sequence of spectacular fights
between hunters and vampires.  There is a lot of fighting and lots of
gore.  Anything intriguing is kept to a minimum to so it does not get
in the way of pleasing the action film fans.  This has not always been
Carpenter's style.  His 1981 version of THE THING has action but also
challenges the viewer to do a little thinking about the film's central
science fictional question.
     Jack Crow heads a vampire SWAT team, cleaning up nests of vampires
with high-tech spears and crossbows.  In the early part of the film his
team is wiped out by a particularly mean vampire Valek (Thomas Ian
Griffith) who has been tipped off to who Crow is.  Now Crow team is
gone and he is down to himself and his sidekick Tony Montoya (Daniel
Baldwin).  To make matters worse, he does not know the people on his
own side, Tony and his backers, he can trust.  Meanwhile Jack is sure
the vampires are looking for something that must be hidden somewhere
here in New Mexico.
     If this is sounding like a very tired police corruption plot with
a few obvious substitutions, that's exactly what it is.  The same story
looks just as well with two partner cops looking for a gang of hood who
are themselves looking for a packet of heroin.  But Carpenter goes
against a familiar principle of film: show people, don't tell them.
Just about everything in the plot other than the fights we are told
about in the dialog and not shown.  Fundamental questions in the plot
like where does Crow get his funding, why are the vampires in New
Mexico--what do they want and why do they want it, what is the
connection of the vampires and the Catholic Church, how did Crow come
to be a vampire hunter and why devote his life to it? The answers to
any of these questions could have been dramatized, but instead are
revealed through dialog.
     Now if all this was not bad enough, Carpenter misuses the James
Wood persona.  Woods plays a particular sort of cool lowlife very well.
But Carpenter leads off the film by having Woods do some Sergio-Leone-
style mythic posturing.  While his crew prepares for an attack he
stands staring fixedly through shades at the house that will be his
target.  Woods does not work as a larger than life mythic hero.  That
is not his style and it just does not work very well.  There are some
simple things that Carpenter should be looking for as director that he
misses.  In one scene we are looking at a motel room with dead people
on the floor.  One female corpse is on the floor in front of a chair so
that there is about an inch of daylight between her and the chair.  As
the actress breathes the gap widening and narrowing makes it obvious
her arm is moving up and down.  One also wonders how the existence of
vampires is kept secret.  These vampires do not maintain a low profile.
     There are arguably logical flaws in the film.  There is some
question in my mind whether Carpenter has a consistent policy on what
effect bullets have on vampires.  It would take some rationalization to
explain why in some scenes sunlight has a dramatic effect on vampires,
yet in a scene toward the end a vampire can walk under a burned roof
that lets him be swept by beams of sunlight.
     I suspect that the book on which this film was based was better
thought out.  While I might recommend this film to an action audience I
would say that what I look for in a vampire film VAMPIRES rates a 4 on
the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.  Perhaps I will read
the book.

Vampires
(1998, USA, Largo Entertainment, 103 min.)
director/composer: John Carpenter
script: John Carpenter, Don Jacobi, Dan Mazur actors: James Woods,
Daniel Baldwin, Sheryl Lee, Thomas Ian Griffith, Mamilian Schell
rating: >= 12 years (in France)
some people should be warned that the movie contains: extreme violence,
some nudity, foul language, a delightful absence of Hollywood-type
morals or political correctness.
At the moment, John Carpenter's latest movie can only be seen in France,
where it did good business (esp. considering it's a horror movie). USA
release is planned for the autumn. For interested tourists: keep in mind
that the French release is dubbed in French. I don't know if the movie
is also screened with subtitles. Luckily, my French was good enough so I
only didn't fully get some subtleties of Jack's Crow swearing... I also
believe that the movie is at the end of its career in France.
For those who haven't heard about it: here follows a very short and
relatively spoiler-free synopsis of the intro: Jack Crow (James Woods)
and his team are full-time, Vatican-endorsed vampire hunters. Team Crow
employs drastic measures, to say the least. They manage to seriously
anger the "original vampire" Valek (an impressive Griffith) and now the
hunters become the hunted...
John Carpenter is back. Remember those delicious shivers you experienced
during his best movies? Remember the impeccable wide-screen
compositions, the trademarked thumping soundtrack? The much-copied
"spring-loaded-cat" shocks? The non-conformist anti-heroes with the
snarling one-liners? This movie delivers it all in spades. Carpenter
needed a hit movie. It was hoped that his previous effort, Escape from
LA, would bring him back to the commercial top, but it wasn't the
expected hit. Perhaps this was only to be expected, how could a public
that adored the extremely populist "Independence Day" appreciate such a
cynical take on America? Before EFLA, there was "Memoirs of an invisible
man" (which I believe is underrated), "In the mouth of madness" (which
had a good story, but was not really scary) and the remake of "Village
of the damned" (somewhat impersonal, but like most of JC's movies, it
seems to get better with each passing year). I believe that all these
movies made some money world-wide, but we have to go back to "They Live"
(1998) for Carpenter's last real commercial success. Commercial success
is not necessarily a synonym for artistic success (just reconsider
Independence yawn), but a hit now and then typically means easier
funding for new projects. This movie might just be it.
You can expect Carpenter doing things differently. A vampire-movie is a
classic, strongly coded style, but Carpenter injects it with new blood,
by filming it as a contemporary western. Many Carpenter movies have some
Western-type situations or characters, but it was never this obvious.
You can notice it in the group of Team Crow (a wild bunch), the dusty
southern landscapes, the music... I believe it is an appealing,
refreshing mix (as far as I know, only Near Dark has more or less the
same atmosphere) and I think the movie will benefit from strong
word-of-mouth. Don't expect a soft horror movie. Vampires is a raw and
brutal movie. The vampires themselves act more like leopards (very
quick, beastly, deadly) than like classic vampires.
Carpenter's style has evolved. I always admired the relatively calm and
pure but elaborate filming style of his earlier work. Alas, it seems
that this very classic filming style is out of fashion. The style of
Vampires is still visibly Carpenter (this is one of the very few
directors who have a recognisable style) but on the whole it's "faster"
than before. The global effect is more like the style of Desperado. More
camera's are used and editing is generally faster than before (certainly
during action scenes), but we're not talking 3-cuts-per-second Michael
Bay style here. Well, the Reborn Carpenter Style works. It is also
interesting to note that an extreme carnage in a motel is edited with
fades. You would expect fast cuts (fades seem like "nicer" transitions)
but it works. In this case I thought it gives a more mythical aura to
the action.
Considering actors: James Woods truly shines. You really believe he's
vampire hunter Jack Crow. He is not a likeable man, but then Snake
Plissken or the killer from Assault (forgot the name) weren't nice
either. These are truly "Carpenterian" heroes (lone, cynical,
anarchist), and the director has said he sees them as idealised
projections of himself. If that's true, better not mess around with this
guy... It must also be said that Crow's attitude to women is not
politically correct. Jack Crow won't have an Erica Jong novel in his
bookcase... Daniel Baldwin is not special at all. Competent, nothing
more. This could have been a nice role for Kurt Russel. It is a pity we
don't see Sheryl Lee more often on the screen: she's a good actress
(though her dialogue is minimal here) and of course, rather pleasing on
the eye. But the big surprise of the movie is Thomas Ian Griffith. I
didn't know him, but it seems he played in some B-grade action movies.
His Valek is a truly magnificent, powerful and scary vampire. He has the
charisma of Christopher Lee. The fact that he is really tall, makes him
seem even more supernatural and invincible. What a change compared to
Coppola's wimp Dracula!
Some other nice touches: the music has evolved, too: there are some
typical Carpenter rhythms but they are held together with guitar sounds
which reminded me of Ry Cooder (okay, not as good as Cooder). All in
all, it seemed like one of JC's better soundtracks, and I am curious if
it will also work as stand-alone music. And considering the story: the
way the church is tied-in to the vampire myth is refreshing and there's
some nice use of telepathy (also unexpected in a vampire movie). The
inventive way the vampires are killed produces some extreme images.
Perhaps it works so well because it isn't played for laughs (unlike From
Dusk Till Dawn, for example). You'll see...
Perhaps you are thinking: "Okay, but what about cardboard characters? Or
an underdeveloped script?" Well, since you insist, I have to explain
it... This movie deals with professionals. They don't start some
Freudian whining when something bad happens. They act. The characters
are defined by their actions, less by their dialogue. Therefore, the bit
of love-interest isn't drenched in Titanic-like romanticism. Vampires
just wants to be creepy. The rest is superficial. By concentrating fully
on the essential elements of what makes a good horror film, it succeeds.
You can actually apply this reasoning on most of Carpenter's movies.
Is everything in the movie that excellent? Sadly, I have to make one
remark: it really feels like the remaining budget suddenly evaporated
while the ending was being filmed. It should have been a big,
nail-biting finale. What we get to see is reasonably suspenseful in its
build-up but like I said, it seems the moviemakers ran out of money. I
don't want to give away too many spoilers, I think you will notice it
yourself. Some running people, some shots are heard (not seen). It's all
over rather quickly. I believe Carpenter wanted to save it with quick
editing. Now, if Stanley Kubrick is allowed to film for 15 months and is
recently even doing re-shoots for a month, perhaps it would be nice to
flesh out the ending of Vampires somewhat before the definitive USA
release. Otherwise, the movie is very enjoyable and there's a constant
tension. The motel scene will be classic among horror fans. If I compare
the movie to Prince of Darkness, Carpenter's last truly excellent horror
movie, Vampires scores less on the edge-of-the-seat factor, perhaps
because POD was much more claustrophobic. Or perhaps also because of the
change in filming style.
Whatever, Vampires is suspenseful and there's a lot of (gory) action.
Highly recommended for genre lovers who are tired of standard
horror-movies, or amateurs of wayward but skilled film-making in
general.
Score: I think it is in Carpenter's top 5. You can convert this to your
own units of appreciation.

James Woods is such a volatile, energetic performer that he somehow makes every
film he's in his own, and does so by charging up the screen with tightly
controlled rage and tension. The same cannot be said for the turgid, monotonous
shenanigans of "John Carpenter's Vampires," a shallow film where Woods is
reduced to a one-dimensional sideshow attraction. 
"Vampires" is set in New Mexico, where Woods plays vampire hunter Jack Crow,
whose mission is to search and destroy vampire nests in the countryside. He's
assisted by an anonymous motley crew of professionals armed with crossbows,
shotguns, and fishing lines (so they can drag the vampires out into the sun).
Oh, and there's a priest who comes along to bless each burnt vampire corpse.
The master vampire, Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith) eludes them during one of their
raids. As an act of revenge, he visits a party they are at that same night and
slaughters nearly everyone of them except for Crow and his partner (numbingly
played by Daniel Baldwin). Crow is then hired by the Vatican to kill Valek and
any other vampire nests that may have developed. In the meantime, Valek's
mission is to find a cross that will enable vampires to walk the earth during
the day. 
"Vampires" could have been an old-fashioned B-movie with lots of gore and
witticisms courtesy of Crow and his crew. Once the crew is vanquished, though,
the movie loses focus and treads along cliched, charted territory. We get the
hooker (Sheryl Lee) who's bitten by Valek and can telepathically anticipate his
every move; the typical stake-in-the-heart theatrics (there must be more
original methods of killing vampires); the naive priest who turns out to be
heroic; and so on and so forth. As directed by Carpenter, this movie is
sluggishly paced and completely devoid of humor or horror. There's also an
anticlimactic ending that fails to deliver any thrills at all, surprisingly. 
There are some pluses. For instance, when the vampires emerge from the ground
(as opposed to coffins), it is spectacularly shot and very menacing. One can
also savor the former "Twin Peaks" star, Sheryl Lee, who brings an element of
empathy to her stereotypical hooker character - she's abused and slapped around
by Jack and his sidekick in such a manner that you can't help but care for her.
Griffith is perfectly cast as Valek, and he'd be great as Lestat ("Interview
with the Vampire") if anyone cares to make another film version of Anne Rice's
novels. I also enjoyed the musical score by Mr. Carpenter himself. 
This pseudo-horror western is not the first of its kind. I fondly remember the
cult film by director Kathryn Bigelow called "Near Dark," which also had a
western setting and an interesting central relationship between a vampire
couple. At least that movie moved along at a good pace. This one represents a
new low in Carpenter's career - he's lost the element of surprise.

   "Don't believe what you see in movies about vampires,"
advises Jack Crow (James Woods) when clueing someone in
to the conventions of the bloodsuckers.  OK, Jack, we won't
believe a thing we see on the screen, but we'll still have lots
of fun watching the incredible pass before our eyes.  Why is
this movie such a lark?  Two words: James Woods.  Who
else could do his job in putting his own brand of camp on this,
one of the scores of vampire films that have always
fascinated us especially around Halloween.  The narrow-faced
actor has performed in several dimensions as villains,
hoodlums, and once even Roy Cohn and can evoke the
hatred of the audience in movies like "The Onion Field."  He
can also turn be the good guy, but hardly saintly, as he is in
John Carpenter's latest hoot, "Vampires."  In his obsenity-
spouting, highly-strung performance, he counsels us to forget
some of the things we've been told about these undead.  For
example, they're not repelled by garlic, which makes them
very powerful indeed, and they can even laugh at the crucifix,
pick it up and, in this case actually seek it out to perform an
exorcism!
   Like the second (and inferior) half of "From Dusk Till
Dawn," "Vampires" is a horror movie but it exudes much that
belongs to the western.  The action takes place in California,
but we see nothing of Tinseltown; rather a the sort of
wasteland that finds clumps of bushes blowing about, old,
Spanish-style mission houses with abbeys who ring the bell
when danger approaches, and one delightfully dilapidated
shack that houses the most dangerous vampire of them all,
the 600-year-old Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith).  Clothed in
black, played menacingly as a man with great physical
strength and spider veins running up and down his face,
Griffith does a sumptuous job of portraying evil incarnate, a
man who in 1340 was a priest who challenged the rites of the
Catholic Church, was condemned and burned as a heretic,
and underwent a failed exorcism to wash the evil spirit from
his body.  He and his "children" can be killed only by driving a
stake through their hearts and for good measure dragging
them out into the sun, though they can be temporarily stopped
by bullets, and if you're not prepared for his visit or expect to
negotiate with him, you will have your body torn out from
under you by one swift, leopard-like slash of his potent open
hand or your jugular deveined by a swift jab of his feral nails.
   Jack Crow teams up with Tony Montoya (Daniel Baldwin)
and a small group to slay Valek, called "The Master," and
others of his ilk.  Armed with crossbows, machine guns and
simple pistols, they sneak into hideaways with their truck
hoping to catch the demons by surprise and, while driving
stakes through their hearts, they like to drag the bodies out
with a chain tied to their van so that exposure to the sun will
fry them to a crisp.  
   The movie is filled with gratuitous nudity, suggestions of
sexual bondage, blasphemy and rip-roaring violence, all of
which set political correctness on its head.  Female vampires
are likely to be greeted with chivalrous dialogue like "How do
you like your stake, bitch," and a priest is met by Jack Crow
with the such religious sentiments as "let me get you a beer
and then we'll get you laid."  One priest gets blind drunk
shortly before he is virtually decapitated, while a cardinal's
virtues prove to be entirely questionable.  In one scene, Tony
Montoya ties a beautiful young woman, Katrina (Sheryl Lee)
to a bed after having removed her clothes and makes sure
the theater audience gets to see a good deal of her physical
beauty before he covers her with a blanket.  Katrina also gets
tied to the roof of a van in yet another sexually suggestive
position, all for the greater good of killing the undead.
   Special effects are first rate, with the vampires turning
charcoal broiled in second under the heat of the California
sun and in one case the body of one of the slayers literally
falls apart when Valek uses his mighty force against him.  If
"Vampires" falls short of being a must-see it ranks among the
most original takes on the genre, is filled with gore, and has
enough comedic situations courtesy of the talented James
Woods to keep you happy.
   John Carpenter is a director known for gripping the
audience emotionally--as critic David Thomsen reports in his
"Biographical Dictionary of Film"--and never letting go.  Film
buffs living in the Big Apple share a particular fondness for his
"Escape from New York," which portrays Manhattan as a
maximum-security prison from which Snake Pissken (Kurt
Russell) must make a daring escape.  Who can forget his
"Halloween," the original one and not the bland, recent
remake, one of the scariest films ever to hit the screen; and
though it would be a stretch, you could almost say that the
uneasy walk of the character of Beloved from Jonathan
Demme's movie of the name was inspired by Jeff Bridges's
performance in Carpenter's "Star Man."  "Vampires" is a
worthy addition to his repertory.

Ingredients: Vampires, vampire hunters, New Mexico
Synopsis: 
In this version, vampires can still be killed by wooden stakes and
sunlight, but garlic, crosses, and holy water do nothing. In addition,
vampires can also be created by botched exorcisms. Professional vampire
hunters hired by the Catholic Church are called slayers, while vampires
covens roost in "nests", presided over by a vampire "master." 
Main characters Crow and Montoya (James Woods and Daniel Baldwin) are
1990s vampire hunters. Their hit squad of slayers strikes the vampires.
Later the vampire master strikes back. Then the vampires reorganize.
Then the hit squad reorganizes. They all get ready for the final battle.
Meanwhile Crow must figure out who betrayed his name and location to the
vampires. 
Opinion: 
Heroes win, heroes lose, heroes fight the big stakes finale. That was
and still is the formula for all superhero made-for-TV fare. JOHN
CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES is no different. The only new innovations JOHN
CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES adds are the sunny New Mexico (read "Western")
setting, the 1990s method of vampire killing (anchor them to a rope and
use a sport utility vehicle to drag them into the sunlight), and some
new mythology (vampires can be created by botched exorcism).  
JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES is fairly predictable, and main character Jack
Crow is a bit unsavory for a hero (he mouths expletives at his men,
shoves a woman, and slaps around an innocent young priest), but it's all
in good B-grade fun.

Dustin Putman's Film Reviews >
There was a time when John Carpenter was a great horror director. Of 
course, his best film was 1978's masterpiece, "Halloween," but he also 
made 1980's "The Fog," and 1987's underrated, "Prince of Darkness." 
Heck, he even made a good film in 1995, with "In the Mouth of Madness." 
But something terribly wrong happened to him in 1992, with the terrible 
comedy, "Memoirs of an Invisible Man." Somehow, Carpenter has lost his 
touch, with junk like his failed 1995 remake of, "Village of the 
Damned," to his uninspired 1996 sequel, "Escape From L.A." Those movies, 
however, look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film, 
"John Carpenter's Vampires." If I was him, I definately wouldn't want to 
put my own name in the title. It is a sad state of affairs when 
Carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed 
as, "Vampires."
The story is simple. Jack Crow (James Woods) is a vampire hunter who, 
along with one of his partners, Montoya (Daniel Baldwin), and a 
prostitute, Katrina (Sheryl Lee), survives an attack from the Master 
vampire, Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith). Since Katrina was previously 
bitten by him, Crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by 
Valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn 
into vampires a couple days later, and Crow is hoping to find him with 
the help of her. It seems Valek's mission is to steal a black, wooden 
cross from a Roman Catholic church that will enable him to become so 
powerful that sunlight will not destroy him.
My question is: how many time have we seen this same story played out? 
Well, the answer is just about as many times as a better version of the 
story has been made. "John Carpenter's Vampires," sadly enough, is one 
of the most unscary horror films I've ever seen. In fact, there isn't 
even one suspenseful moment in the whole 105-minute running time. The 
non-stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed, without any 
interesting camera work, which is usually a trademark of Carpenter's. 
And then we come to the screenplay, which, as far as I can tell, is 
nearly non-existent. There is no story development, and there isn't even 
an attempt to flesh out the characters.
James Woods can be a good actor, but he has nothing to do here but to 
say a couple of "pseudo"-clever lines of dialogue. Daniel Baldwin has 
some potential, but his character comes off as being very dense. And 
Sheryl Lee (faring much better as Laura Palmer in "Twin Peaks"), like 
all of the female characters, plays an offensive stereotypical whore. 
There is not an ounce of intelligence, or excitement in, "John 
Carpenter's Vamires," which is very disheartening coming from an ex-fan 
of Carpenter's. He has said that he turned down directing, "Halloween: 
H20," because he couldn't work up any excitement for it. And yet, when 
asked about a "Vampires" sequel, he said he would be happy to do it. I 
think that's a definite sign that Carpenter has finally lost any trace 
of his lasting talent, not to mention a significant number of IQ points.

Susan Granger's review of "John Carpenter's VAMPIRES" (Columbia Pictures)
Taking his cue from "William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet" and
"Bram Stoker's Dracula," John Carpenter includes himself in the title,
which is an indication of how self-absorbed his first venture into
vampirism is. The scare story with campy, comedic overtones revolves
around deception and betrayal as a Catholic Cardinal (Maximilian
Schell) hires a cynical, gunslinging vampire slayer (James Woods).
Along with his grungy driver (Daniel Baldwin) and other team-mates, he
destroys a bloodsuckers' nest in an abandoned farmhouse in rural New
Mexico and then gets ambushed by the 600 year-old original vampire
"master" (Thomas Ian Griffith) who is looking for a legendary "black
cross" through which he can obtain for himself and his successors the
power to walk in daylight. What Carpenter does is transform the Gothic
castle-with-cobwebs cliche into a dusty Southwestern setting with
scenes reminiscent of Sam Peckinpah's "The Wild Bunch" and directorial
touches of Howard Hawks. His inventive manner of annihilation is
picturesque, as the slayers shoot a "stake" into the creatures and
then drag them into the sunlight, where they instantly become "crispy
critters." Unlike Robert Rodrigues's "From Dusk Till Dawn," in which
the characters morphed into bats, there are few computer-generated
special effects. Instead, Carpenter depends on lighting and make-up,
which includes lots of prosthetics and rubber appliances. Don Jakoby's
screenplay, based on "Vampire$" by John Steakley, delivers some
vicious indictments of Catholicism and a curious AIDS virus parallel,
but James Woods emerges as the biggest, bad-tempered spook. On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "John Carpenter's Vampires" is a
raunchy, grotesque 4. Lots of big fangs and blood-splattering scenes.

Vampire lore and legend has always been a popular fantasy element,
substantiated by not only the sheer number of movies about the subject,
but also the proliferation of cults and sects of adherents. And, unlike
any of the more outlandish myths, the vampire holds some real-world
probability (one study claims 1,000 bloodsuckers exist worldwide, and
places 50 in Los Angeles). But lest the nasties be mistaken for simple
comic book bad guys, John Carpenter would like to remind us that they
are - and always have been - a truly frightening element of the thriller
genre. And remind us he does in his latest film, VAMPIRES. 
There was some question, as Halloween weekend approached, of how well
VAMPIRES would do in comparison to New Line Cinema's immensely
successful BLADE, released in August. The two films take noticeably
different stands on the vampire issue, and don't even agree on some
basic points of the slaying method. (For instance, Blade's main weapons
are silver and garlic, whereas main character Jack Crow's technique is a
wooden stake to the heart.) BLADE also gives more of a face to the
vampire civilization, while Carpenter would like us to remain in the
dark about how the pasties operate. Both have their advantages, and
here, Carpenter's style lends itself to a darker breed of suspense
rather than the action movie that BLADE director Stephen Norrington
delievered. When it's all said and done, though, the vampires still kill
and die with a bloody flourish; the level for gore is indeed set to
maximum. 
This time, our hero is Vatican-sponsored slayer Jack Crow (James Woods).
He's a cynical, battle-worn veteran, and the best of his bunch. He and
his team are responsible for cleaning out the American Southwest, and
after exterminating a nest one night, they run up against a
super-vampire (termed a "master") named Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith).
Valek kills all of Jack's team except for his partner, Tony Montoya
(Daniel Baldwin), and as the two regroup, they learn that Valek is the
original vampire - now over six hundred years old. Apparently, Valek and
his minions have been sweeping the Southwest for decades in search of a
cross that will enable them to walk in the daytime. So with the aid of a
priest named Adam (Tim Guinee) and a bitten hooker (Sheryl Lee) as bait,
they track Valek down for the final confrontation. 
The script for VAMPIRES, written by Don Jakoby and based on the John
Steakley novel, is perhaps the wittiest piece of screenplay to see
production all year. Crow, in particular, is a fun source of one-liners,
and Woods does every one of them with perfect stoicism. Baldwin, Lee,
and Guinee are all fine supports, adding to the character pool, but the
other true highlight of the movie is Thomas Ian Griffith's bad guy.
Griffith's intense expression is perfect for the role, and the only
downside is that he's got to talk sometime. Luckily, he's got few lines,
and manages to pull off a rather thrilling performance. All said, fans
will surely be impressed by this picture, and those who found APT PUPIL
a bit limp will be excited by this one. Certainly a worthwhile visit to
the theaters.

Vampires (1998, USA, Largo Entertainment, 103 min.)
director/composer: John Carpenter
script: John Carpenter, Don Jacobi, Dan Mazur
actors: James Woods, Daniel Baldwin, Sheryl Lee, Thomas Ian Griffith,
Mamilian Schell
rating: >= 12 years (in France)
some people should be warned that the movie contains: extreme violence,
some nudity, foul language, a delightful absence of Hollywood-type
morals or political correctness.
At the moment, John Carpenter's latest movie can only be seen in France,
where it did good business (esp. considering it's a horror movie). USA
release is planned for the autumn. For interested tourists: keep in mind
that the French release is dubbed in French. I don't know if the movie
is also screened with subtitles. Luckily, my French was good enough so I
only didn't fully get some subtleties of Jack's Crow swearing... I also
believe that the movie is at the end of its career in France.
For those who haven't heard about it: here follows a very short and
relatively spoiler-free synopsis of the intro: Jack Crow (James Woods)
and his team are full-time, Vatican-endorsed vampire hunters. Team Crow
employs drastic measures, to say the least. They manage to seriously
anger the "original vampire" Valek (an impressive Griffith) and now the
hunters become the hunted...
John Carpenter is back. Remember those delicious shivers you experienced
during his best movies? Remember the impeccable wide-screen
compositions, the trademarked thumping soundtrack? The much-copied
"spring-loaded-cat" shocks? The non-conformist anti-heroes with the
snarling one-liners? This movie delivers it all in spades. Carpenter
needed a hit movie. It was hoped that his previous effort, Escape from
LA, would bring him back to the commercial top, but it wasn't the
expected hit. Perhaps this was only to be expected, how could a public
that adored the extremely populist "Independence Day" appreciate such a
cynical take on America? Before EFLA, there was "Memoirs of an invisible
man" (which I believe is underrated), "In the mouth of madness" (which
had a good story, but was not really scary) and the remake of "Village
of the damned" (somewhat impersonal, but like most of JC's movies, it
seems to get better with each passing year). I believe that all these
movies made some money world-wide, but we have to go back to "They Live"
(1998) for Carpenter's last real commercial success. Commercial success
is not necessarily a synonym for artistic success (just reconsider
Independence yawn), but a hit now and then typically means easier
funding for new projects. This movie might just be it.
You can expect Carpenter doing things differently. A vampire-movie is a
classic, strongly coded style, but Carpenter injects it with new blood,
by filming it as a contemporary western. Many Carpenter movies have some
Western-type situations or characters, but it was never this obvious.
You can notice it in the group of Team Crow (a wild bunch), the dusty
southern landscapes, the music... I believe it is an appealing,
refreshing mix (as far as I know, only Near Dark has more or less the
same atmosphere) and I think the movie will benefit from strong
word-of-mouth. Don't expect a soft horror movie. Vampires is a raw and
brutal movie. The vampires themselves act more like leopards (very
quick, beastly, deadly) than like classic vampires.
Carpenter's style has evolved. I always admired the relatively calm and
pure but elaborate filming style of his earlier work. Alas, it seems
that this very classic filming style is out of fashion. The style of
Vampires is still visibly Carpenter (this is one of the very few
directors who have a recognisable style) but on the whole it's "faster"
than before. The global effect is more like the style of Desperado. More
camera's are used and editing is generally faster than before (certainly
during action scenes), but we're not talking 3-cuts-per-second Michael
Bay style here. Well, the Reborn Carpenter Style works. It is also
interesting to note that an extreme carnage in a motel is edited with
fades. You would expect fast cuts (fades seem like "nicer" transitions)
but it works. In this case I thought it gives a more mythical aura to
the action.
Considering actors: James Woods truly shines. You really believe he's
vampire hunter Jack Crow. He is not a likeable man, but then Snake
Plissken or the killer from Assault (forgot the name) weren't nice
either. These are truly "Carpenterian" heroes (lone, cynical,
anarchist), and the director has said he sees them as idealised
projections of himself. If that's true, better not mess around with this
guy... It must also be said that Crow's attitude to women is not
politically correct. Jack Crow won't have an Erica Jong novel in his
bookcase... Daniel Baldwin is not special at all. Competent, nothing
more. This could have been a nice role for Kurt Russel. It is a pity we
don't see Sheryl Lee more often on the screen: she's a good actress
(though her dialogue is minimal here) and of course, rather pleasing on
the eye. But the big surprise of the movie is Thomas Ian Griffith. I
didn't know him, but it seems he played in some B-grade action movies.
His Valek is a truly magnificent, powerful and scary vampire. He has the
charisma of Christopher Lee. The fact that he is really tall, makes him
seem even more supernatural and invincible. What a change compared to
Coppola's wimp Dracula!
Some other nice touches: the music has evolved, too: there are some
typical Carpenter rhythms but they are held together with guitar sounds
which reminded me of Ry Cooder (okay, not as good as Cooder). All in
all, it seemed like one of JC's better soundtracks, and I am curious if
it will also work as stand-alone music. And considering the story: the
way the church is tied-in to the vampire myth is refreshing and there's
some nice use of telepathy (also unexpected in a vampire movie). The
inventive way the vampires are killed produces some extreme images.
Perhaps it works so well because it isn't played for laughs (unlike From
Dusk Till Dawn, for example). You'll see...
Perhaps you are thinking: "Okay, but what about cardboard characters? Or
an underdeveloped script?" Well, since you insist, I have to explain
it... This movie deals with professionals. They don't start some
freudian whining when something bad happens. They act. The characters
are defined by their actions, less by their dialogue. Therefore, the bit
of love-interest isn't drenched in Titanic-like romanticism. Vampires
just wants to be creepy. The rest is superficial. By concentrating fully
on the essential elements of what makes a good horror film, it succeeds.
You can actually apply this reasoning on most of Carpenter's movies.
Is everything in the movie that excellent? Sadly, I have to make one
remark: it really feels like the remaining budget suddenly evaporated
while the ending was being filmed. It should have been a big,
nail-biting finale. What we get to see is reasonably suspenseful in its
build-up but like I said, it seems the moviemakers ran out of money. I
don't want to give away too many spoilers, I think you will notice it
yourself. Some running people, some shots are heard (not seen). It's all
over rather quickly. I believe Carpenter wanted to save it with quick
editing. Now, if Stanley Kubrick is allowed to film for 15 months and is
recently even doing re-shoots for a month, perhaps it would be nice to
flesh out the ending of Vampires somewhat. Otherwise, the movie is very
enjoyable and there's a constant tension. The motel scene will be
classic among horror fans. If I compare the movie to Prince of Darkness,
Carpenter's last truly excellent horror movie, Vampires scores less on
the edge-of-the-seat factor, perhaps because POD was much more
claustrophobic. Or perhaps also because of the change in filming style.
Whatever, Vampires is suspenseful and there's a lot of (gory) action.
Highly recommended for genre lovers who are tired of standard
horror-movies, or amateurs of wayward but skilled film-making in
general.
Score: I think it is in Carpenter's top 5. You can convert this to your
own units of appreciation.

A Film Review of John Carpenter's Vampires
by Mark O'Hara
visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.com
Why not start a review with the parts of the movie I didn't enjoy?
I could have done with a dozen fewer graphic and inventively twisted 
murders on screen.  OK - the severed heads didn't look all that 
realistic, and John Carpenter sometimes goes so over-the-top with the 
violence that I found myself chuckling at the excess.  But the first 
group-slaying carried out by Jack Crow (James Woods) and his Church-paid 
crusaders lets us know that extreme means and extreme caution are the 
method of operation needed here.  Do we have to witness friars flying 
about their mission's courtyard, the fountain running with their blood?
That said, Vampires is a tightly told action film, a hybrid of horror 
and spaghetti Western, an intense and sometimes campy entertainment.  
When Crow and Tony Montoya (Daniel Baldwin) swing open the doors of a 
converted armored truck to let out the rest of their goon-killing squad, 
we know we're in for a ride.
The premise pivots on the motivation of the original vampire - not Vlad 
but the similarly-named Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith).  This vampire 
master was created 600 years ago by the Catholic Church, when an 
exorcism went wrong and Valek's dead body was left inhabited by his 
condemned soul.  This bit is one of the more striking among the many 
original additions to vampire mythology.  Of course Valek possesses 
superhuman strength, and dominates any confrontation with unarmed 
humans, even scores of them.  Valek is searching the American Southwest 
for the black cross, the one used at the time of his death.  What Jack 
Crow and his men are charged with is not only ridding the world of nests 
of the undead, but stopping Valek before he can use the cross in a 
ceremony enabling him to walk during the day.
In this adaptation of John Steakley's novel Vampire$, Carpenter and 
screenwriter Don Jakoby make a few more notable alterations to 
bloodsucker lore.  I found it fascinating that Crow is equated with a 
warrior in the Crusades; his quest is, after all, a sacred one.  In a 
low-key but stunning connecting scene, we watch Crow - exhausted from 
"burying" most of his slaughtered slayers to keep them from "turning" - 
hunched over the wheel of his truck.  Woods seems off guard for a 
change, almost wincing from weariness, when he suddenly focuses on the 
rosary hanging from the rear-view mirror.  Crosses become a clear motif 
in the narrative (even though they do no good when flashed in a 
vampire's bluish face).  Another nice touch is the weaponry used by the 
slayers.  Crossbows with tethered arrows, shiny spontoons and even a 
neckpiece made of mail - these instruments look good when pulled from 
the truck and even better when employed in close combat with the 
vampires.  Especially riveting are scenes in which vampires, impaled on 
the small harpoons, are dragged shrieking and shuddering out into the 
sunlight, where they burst into nifty little holocausts.  Good special 
effects.
We are supplied with little information about Jack Crow.  His parents 
are dead, the circumstances involving vampires.  Crow is a Bruce 
Wayne-like figure, a loner obsessed with hunting vampires, raised by the 
Church, in fact, to do so.  It's more economical that the film follows 
the small but wild scope of his world.  James Woods is all business in 
this role, particularly in verbal riffs addressed to Father Adam (Tim 
Guinee) and Valek.
Daniel Baldwin brings a cool toughness to the second-in-command slayer, 
Montoya.  He is also skilled in showing the camaraderie crucial to 
warriors: he's a big, good buddy to have on your side in a fight.  As he 
slowly falls in love with a hooker, Katrina, Baldwin's Montoya lets slip 
an uncharacteristic tenderness.  As Katrina, Sheryl Lee is talented at 
depicting a beauty that is at once alluring and repulsive - reflecting 
what is probably Carpenter's aim.
In scenes perhaps inspired by stylized Westerns , and most recently seen 
with the Armageddon astronauts fanned out and walking toward the camera, 
we see first the band of slayers and then, the film's conflict mounting, 
Valek and seven other vampire masters, stares menacing and black clothes 
flicking in the wind.  Several other variations on things Western lend 
the film tones that are both serious and campy.  It's a good bet that if 
viewers are not intrigued by dialogue or plot twists, they'll be amused.
John Carpenter's range as an artist is impressive.  The score is his 
original music. Although all I can remember now is a repetitive bass 
guitar phrase, the music does a fine and transparent job of 
complimenting the scenes.
Simply put, I enjoyed Vampires more than I though I would.  There were 
no extended scenes involving dark rituals, even though I was mildly 
creeped-out by Valek's attempt to reenact his exorcism.  The film is out 
mainly to pack in as much action as it can.  I'd say to see Vampires, 
especially if you're a fan of other Carpenter works, like The Thing and 
The Fog.  Don't go if you can't stomach gore, though, and don't take 
along any living person under 16.

Based on the novel VAMPIRE$ by John Steakley.  
Directed by John Carpenter.  
Starring James Woods, Daniel Baldwin, Sheryl Lee, Thomas Ian Griffith,
Maximilian Schell.
Rated R (contains violence, nudity, and profanity)  107 mins.
Synopsis:  Swearing, cigar-smoking professional vampire slayer Jack Crow
leads his buddy Tony, a prostitute, and a Catholic priest into battle
against Valek, the world's first vampire, who is searching for the means to
be able to live in sunlight.
Comments:  As I write this, Halloween 1998 is a three-week old memory, and
Thanksgiving is quickly approaching.  Hollywood released a slew of horror
and horror-related movies right before and closely after Halloween, and
these movies are now slowly making their way through second-run, cheap
theaters.  The season brought us the campy BRIDE OF CHUCKY, the SCREAMish
URBAN LEGEND, and the more serious APT PUPIL, based on a short story by
Stephen King.  A latecomer, the sequel I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST
SUMMER, came out on November, Friday the 13th (aren't they just so clever
marketing a slasher movie on Friday the 13th?).  Having seen all these films
except the last (which has been slammed by most critics), I can safely say
that JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES, released the day before Halloween, was the
best horror film created for the holiday.  This does not necessarily mean it
was a great film--the aforementioned flicks were mediocre at best--but it is
entertaining, especially for horror, action, and "B-movie" fans.  
John Carpenter has done a number of film classics in his long and varied
career (however, he's also produced some turkeys).  His chief
accomplishment, so far at least, is the little 1978 film HALLOWEEN, a film
which became a huge hit and launched the teen slasher genre, including the
FRIDAY THE 13TH and NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET cycles.  He's also done a number
of solid horror and sci-fi movies: THE FOG, THEY LIVE, STARMAN, and a remake
of the 50s classic THE THING.  Carpenter, unfortunately, seemed to be losing
his touch recently.  He directed Kurt Russell through the bad ESCAPE FROM LA
and Christopher Reeves through the even worse VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED (a lousy
remake).  Carpenter somewhat needed a film to resolidify his standing as a
premiere talent.  JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES, at least, is a step in the
right direction.  
Vampires, throughout film history, seem to be very popular with movie
audiences.  From Bela Lugosi's classic turn as DRACULA in the successful
Universal classic to Christopher Lee in England's Hammer cycle to recent big
budget epics like BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA and INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE,
these creatures of the night continue to rake in profits.  Subtle changes in
the vampire myths as they get translated through the decades may allow for
enough variety to keep people interested.  This year, for example, Wesley
Snipes played BLADE, a vampire slayer from Marvel Comics, combining the
vampire with the comic book hero.  JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES, similarly,
combines vampires with another genre, the Western (interestingly, the
Western had just been combined with another genre, science fiction, in
SOLDIER).  The results end up as an interesting mixed bag.
JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES begins promisingly.  Within a beautiful New Mexico
landscape, Jack Crow leads his motley crew of vampire killers into an
infested, dilapidated house far removed from civilization.  Apparently,
Crow's crew kills bloodsuckers in a unique manner: they pierce them with
cables attached to a running truck outside.  The vampires are thus yanked
from the darkness of their abode and into the sunlight, where they quickly
flare up into ashes.  The scene is effectively scary yet sets up the film's
darkly humorous tone as well.  After this beginning, however, the movie
slows to a crawl for about half an hour as the major conflict between Jack
Crow and the original vamp Valek is set up.  
Whether you like JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES or not will largely depend upon
whether or not you like the actors.  James Woods does a wickedly fun turn as
the lead vampire slayer.  He brings a manic energy which fits the character
perfectly.  Thomas Ian Griffith deserves an equal nod as the very effective
Valek.  He informs the vampire with a menacing quality equal to that of
other classic actors like Bela Lugosi.  If you do not like these actors,
especially Woods, however, you probably won't like this movie, as it serves
almost like a vehicle for the two.  As a side note, the highly respected
Maximilian Schell does a supporting role here -- this makes *two* so-so
Hollywood movies he's appeared in this year (the other being the somewhat
cheesy DEEP IMPACT).  
JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES is remarkedly different from the other horror
movies released this past month and a half in that not even a single
teenager graces the screen.  BRIDE OF CHUCKY, URBAN LEGEND, I STILL KNOW
WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER ... all of them center upon teenagers.  JOHN
CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES features an entirely adult cast.  This doesn't
necessarily mean the behavior of these characters, however, is any more
informed by intelligence.  People do stupid things in this movie just like
any other horror movie.  One of the reasons, though, that I only give this
film three stars is the attitude the main characters have.  Jack Crow and
Tony Montoya are uncomfortably misogynistic.  They kidnap a prostitute who
has been bitten by Valek and treat her like absolute crud.  Although she is
turning into a vampire, their treatment of her still seems cruel and
passionless.  The storyline's only major fault is to suggest that Montoya
falls in love with her.  Crow's treatment of members of the Catholic
priesthood will probably offend some too.  In one scene, for instance, Crow
kicks the crap out of a priest to get information, then asks the priest
whether he was turned on by the abuse or not.
Despite these faults, the final hour of JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES picks up
speed and is highly entertaining.  Not much more may be said without giving
away some of the plot's resolution; however, the final showdown between
Crow's "gang" and Valek's "posse" in a deserted town combines the genres of
the Western and horror quite well.  Ultimately, sitting through the first
half-hour is rewarded by the finale.
JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES is deservedly rated R.  It contains many scenes of
graphic violence, some nudity, and several words and phrases which will
never make it to commercial network TV.  This one's worth catching before it
comes out on video.  You could probably still see it at a second-run,
bargain theater for the next several weeks.

  Wow, the vampires in Vampires are some slick cats!  Not only do that dress
like they just got sucked by one of their mates during a fashion show, but they
can leap great lengths and rip apart a man's abdomen with one hand, in graphic,
gory manner.  Well, I guess if a man's chest is ripped open, it would be
bloody, but, showing it so gratuitously is so unlike John Carpenter.
  That is one of the problems with his new film, Vampires, based on the novel
Vampire$ by, um, some guy.  The new bite-and-suck film is so violent, it takes
away from the stylishness that Carpenter puts on the accent of the film.  
  James Woods stars as Jack Crow, a vampire slayer.  His buddy (played by
Daniel Baldwin) is a sleaze who takes the likings to a hooker who is bitten by
the master (Thomas Ian Griffith).  That hooker is played by Sheryl Lee, and she
is pretty unnecessary throughout the rest of the movie.  She's just there for
some nude scenes, another spot that is unlike Carpenter.
  Vampires is easy on cheap thrills and gore, but, tough on plot and
sensibility.  Too bad.  This could have been a great film.  Halloween is
probably the best horror film around.  I can't believe it is directed by the
same guy!
  Carpenter has made some good film in the `90s.  In The Mouth of Madness was a
scary, intelligent film that was as thought provoking as mind boggling.  
  The DVD of Vampires is very good.  The trailer is awesome (music supplied by
Marilyn Manson) and the sound is dynamic!  Add this to your collection, but,
only for the sound and spectacular picture quality.

Review by Victory A. Marasigan
http://www.gl.umbc.edu/~vmaras1/reviewsidx.html
"It was not scary."  These are the first words that came to mind after it
was over.  When a movie is called _Vampires_, "not scary" aren't words
that should be associated with it.  But that wasn't my only gripe.  John
Carpenter is a name associated with cutting-edge cinema, as in the intense
scares of _Halloween_, _The Thing_ and _The Prince of Darkness_, or the
offbeat action of _They Live_ and _Escape From New York_.  Unfortunately,
the only thing that is cutting edge about _Vampires_ is the level of
boredom the movie is able to reach.  With an anemic plot and
not-quite-kosher special effects, _John Carpenter's Vampires_ has barely
enough substance to slake the thirst of even the least discerning genre
fan. 
The film is at first concerned with a group of roaming vampire slayers,
led by James Woods, of all people.  Like some sort of holy A-Team (they
even have their own souped-up van), the bunch invade and wipe out a nest
of vampires in a New Mexico shack.  Their method is amusingly innovative:
the blood-suckers are reeled out with harpoons so they can flare up in the
sun like matchsticks.  
To commemorate their victory, the loutish band decorates a motel room with
hookers and parties the night away.  Their celebration is short-lived,
however, as a master vampire named Valek ambushes and single-handedly
destroys most of the team.  Woods' Jack Crow and buddy Montoya (Daniel
Baldwin) escape with their lives, along with a woman named Katrina (Sheryl
Lee).  Although the woman has been bitten,  Montoya and Crow decide to
keep Katrina for her psychic link to the master vampire.      
The rest of the movie is concerned with the boys' hunt for Valek (Thomas
Ian Griffith), a freaky Marilyn Manson-type who's on a mission that dates
back 600 years.  Along the way they pick up a priest named Guiteau (Tim
Guinee), a character who serves pretty much the same purpose as the
jittery Cpl. Upham in _Saving Private Ryan_.  Some stuff happens in the
middle of the movie, but I can't remember most of it, because I often
found a twitching hair in the corner of the frame more interesting than
what was happening on screen. 
_Vampires_ finally starts to pick up about 90 minutes into the mix, as
Crow, Guiteau, and Montoya assault an abandoned prison-turned vampire
nest.  Only then does the film begin to even resemble a Carpenter flick. 
But it's too little too late.  We get the inevitable final confrontation,
but it seems tacked on and rather anti-climactic (Come on, we're dealing
with _the_ master vampire here!) 
Interestingly, last summer's vampire actioner _Blade_ was derived from a
comic book, and _Vampires_ from a novel, yet the latter seems more steeped
in campy cheesiness than the former, a more deliberate superhero flick.
Woods' Jack Crow spouts glib off-the-cuff one-liners and strolls away from
exploding buildings with that oh-so-cool stride.  And his motive for
killing vampires?  Take a wild guess.  (Hint: A ______ killed his _____
when he was just a _____.)
At least _Blade_ had decent action and slick stylishness.  _Vampires_
lacks even cheap thrills to mask its gossamer-thin plot.  To make up for
this, the movie resorts to other "shocks," such as its generally
condescending attitude towards women (Crow slaps them around for the fun
of it) and an overplayed contempt for religion (Crow teases Guiteau
incessantly about whether his vow of celibacy has made him prone to
"getting woodies.") 
It can be argued that maybe I wanted too much from this movie.  If not
scary and gory, I wanted tense, relentless, and exhausting.  _John
Carpenter's Vampires_ is none of these.  I can only recommended it for the
hardcore Carpenter fan.  For the rest of you looking for a good scare,
beware: _Vampires_ is a film with no teeth.

Directed by: John Carpenter
Written by: John Steakley (novel), Don Jakoby
Jack Crow (James Woods) is a vampire hunter by trade. He and his team are 
funded by the Catholic church to track down vampire nests and wipe the 
beasties out. After their latest assignment, the team is "relaxing" at a 
hotel when a master vampire named Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith) comes calling 
and wipes the team out. The only ones to escape are Jack, his friend, 
Montoya (One of the Baldwins), and a prostitute named Katrina (Sheryl Lee) 
who was bitten by Valek. They find out that Valek is actually the very first 
vampire, accidentally created by the catholic church. He's trying to locate 
an artifact which will give him unlimited power, and his search is almost 
complete. Now Jack, Montoya, and a young priest named Father Adam Guiteau 
(Tim Guinee) have to track him down. They're using Katrina to find him 
because she now has a psychic link with Valek and sees what he sees. Of 
course, time is running out because Katrina will be a vampire in a matter of 
days.
John Carpenter's "Vampires" is the very epitome of the guilty pleasure. As I 
sat watching this marvelously stupid spectacle unfold, I knew I was watching 
a truly bad movie. Yet despite this realization I couldn't help but enjoy 
myself. There's something fun about "Vampires" that one simply cannot 
explain. Now, as a horror movie, the film is rather pitiful. There's nothing 
remotely scary about it, and whenever Thomas Ian Griffith actually tries to 
act scary, it's pretty laughable. Okay fine, so it's no horror movie. How 
does it work as an action movie? Well, uh, Woods and company basically kill 
each vampire in the exact same way, over and over again. It gets a tad 
tedious after awhile. Fine, how about as a thriller? There were a couple of 
good startle effects, somewhere, I think. Okay, so it's not much of a 
horror, there are only one or two thrills, and it doesn't work too well as 
an action movie. So why exactly did I like it? Frankly, I'm still trying to 
figure that out myself. There's plenty of gore, and I'm something of a gore 
lover; there's a great score by Carpenter himself; but I think the best part 
of the film is the highly entertaining performance from James Woods.
Woods ("Contact") isn't exactly the type of guy I think of when I list off 
great actors. I mean sure, he's got a few Oscar nominations under his belt, 
and maybe an Emmy or two, but what does that count for? Despite all this, he 
turns in a truly entertaining performance in "Vampires". He's clearly having 
a great time, and he really gets into it at times (watch for when he's 
riding a vampire out into the sun, stabbing it in the chest crying "Die! 
Die!"). It's too bad his supporting cast doesn't do quite so well. That 
Baldwin I mentioned earlier turns out to be Daniel (they're all 
interchangeable anyway), and he turns in a typical Baldwin performance. 
What's a typical Baldwin performance? Well, it's less than impressive when 
they're acting emotionless (that's most of the time), and laughably bad when 
they're trying to show emotion (which happens more often than I'd like). 
Sheryl Lee's (hey! it's Laura Palmer from "Twin Peaks"!) performance 
involves little more than violently shaking while muttering Valek's 
activities, and Tim Guinee ("Blade") is adequate if uninspiring as the young 
priest. Finally we have Thomas Ian Griffith ("Kull the Conqueror"), 
overacting for all he's worth. Yet while James Woods' overacting is fun and 
entertaining, Griffith's is just plain irritating.
First, I'm going to quickly cover the one thing about "Vampires" that I 
truly didn't like. I don't mean it was cheesy (because that would cover the 
whole movie), I mean I found it offensive. First and foremost is the 
treatment of Sheryl Lee's character by Daniel Baldwin. Now, I realize she's 
turning into a vampire, and I realize that makes her sub-human. Now you must 
realize that I don't care. I find it repulsive to watch a film's "hero" beat 
up a woman for not giving him answers as quickly as he wants. I find it even 
more repulsive that he falls in love with her while smacking her around. 
That's just wrong. Okay, gimme a second while I climb down off my pedestal. 
Alright, as I mentioned but a moment ago, the rest of this film is filled 
with cheese. The dialogue is cheesy ("I killed my own father padre, I got no 
trouble killing you."), the sets are cheesy (the hidden monastery has to be 
seen to be believed), the costumes and props are cheesy (Jack's crossbow 
looks about as threatening as your average super-soaker), but you know what? 
You probably won't care. You'll probably sit there with a big grin on your 
face, shaking your head in disbelief at the fact that you're actually having 
a good time (I know I was). If you go in wanting nothing more than that, you 
should have a blast. If you want a deep, horrifying vampire movie, you're in 
for an experience more disappointing than the second "Scream" film.
Carpenter, being the good horror director he is, does create a few moments 
of real tension in the film. They mainly hit near the end of the film when 
Jack, Montoya, and Father Adam confront Valek and his retinue, and involve 
Father Adam luring vampires into the open. The way in which the scene ends 
is really quite interesting. Carpenter's score is really little more than a 
few notes being played repeatedly. It actually reminded me of a Tom Petty 
song called "Cabin Down Below". Anyway, despite its simplicity, the score 
works well with the dusty locations where the film is shot. The other high 
point to the film is the dialogue. While it's certainly cheesy, it's also 
quite entertaining. In particular I enjoyed a little monologue by Woods 
about what vampires really are. "Vampires" runs a little too long at 107 
minutes, but it seldom lags. I'd recommend the film to fans of cheesy horror 
movies and to fans of James Woods. I wouldn't recommend it to you if you 
love movies like "Interview With the Vampire", because it is the polar 
opposite of "Vampires" I give the film three and a half out of five stars.

The last of vampire-films offers plenty of blood and gore, but beyond that -
nothing.
Jack Crow (James Woods) is a professional vampire slayer that is secretly
working for the Vatican. His and his men's mission is to clean the earth
from vampires. They have lost count of how many vampires they have
slaughtered, but one has always escaped them. Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith ) -
the Dark Messias and ruler of the undead that is older than time itself. For
all eternity the vampires have searched for their salvation - the Black
Cross.  With the cross in their possesion, the vampires will be able to walk
in the sunlight. After that it is either the humans or the vampires who will
dominate the earth...
I have never liked John Carpenter and his style. After seeing this film, my
opinions have not changed. John Carpenter remains John Carpenter. However,
because of the film's self-irony, black humour and fascinating
cinematography, I would say that it is his greatest achievement in a long,
long time.
Neither the synopses or Carpenter's direction are original. But there are
some things that are interesting. The director's negative view on the
Catholic Church, for instance. At the end of the film it becomes clear that
Cardinal Alba (Maximilian Schell ) has simply used Crow and his team to find
Valek, so that he would gain eternal life. Otherwise the Catholic priests
are shown cool - drinking, smoking and breaking the rool of celibacy.
Carpenter has created an interesting atmosphere. Set in New Mexican dessert,
he switches between bright golden sunrises and bloody sundowns, symbolically
illustrating the good and the evil through light and darkness. More than
anything in this film, this simple illustration shows the battle between
good and evil. The cinematography by Gary B. Kibbe   is probably the film's
greatest achievement. Music (composed by John Carpenter himself) is at times
effective, the special effects and makeup are likewise worth a notice.
When it comes to the cast (in an intellectual film like this casting is the
last problem; everyone can scream and swing the axe!), but here James Woods
is suprisingly convincing. He is macho and cool as the dedicated hunter, who
lost his family to the "breed of evil". Woods is constantly overacting,
which really saves the film from falling into the trap of serious self
importance. Daniel Baldwin is also entertaining as Crow's loyal partner. The
other cast members are struggling.
Because the film doesn't take itself too seriously, it stays afloat. Still
it is like most vampire-films - a mediocre experience.

John Carpenter is a mainstream director who has made some of the most
gleefully subversive big-budget movies around.  He made the original
HALLOWEEN, which all by itself is redemption enough, but he also made THE
THING, THEY LIVE, BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA, and ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK --
all films I enjoyed immensely.  He also misfires, as he did with his
senseless remake of VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED and the incoherent IN THE MOUTH OF
MADNESS.  VAMPIRES is another of his misfires, and it's a big one.
The film stars James Woods, playing one of his more repellent characters, a
vampire-hunting mercenary named Jack Crow.  He's being retained by the
Catholic Church to rout out and destroy vampire nests for money (although of
course HIS reasons are personal).  He and his team of hunters go in like the
Gangbusters, using a weirdly elaborate harpoon-gun scheme to drag vampires
out into the open, where they burst into flames like they have magnesium
flares in their shirt pockets.
The movie doesn't convince us that the team(s) are terribly competent: they
act like rookie cops and don't have any clear overall strategy.  One night
they get torn to shreds by some kind of super-vampire, and Crow is
practically the only one left alive.  He staggers off into the night and
tries to fit the pieces together: was he set up?  Are there more vamps like
this one?
For the most part the movie sets itself up as a macho teen-oriented
entertainment, but then there are severe deviations from that pattern that
wreck the movie.  Part of the plot involves a prostitute who is bitten by a
vampire and who is useful to Crow, since she has a telepathic link to the
master vampire.  This woman is forced to do things on camera -- maybe better
to say forced to suffer through things on camera -- that do not belong in a
big-budget entertainment like this.  She's humiliated, beaten, cursed at,
and smacked around like a rag doll.  Worse, the movie lingers on those
details in ways that confounded me completely: they're not that important,
but the movie stays with them regardless.
Woods plays Crow to the hilt, which is both good and bad.  The man is
unrepentantly out for his own revenge, a self-important scumbag.  Fine,
except the movie has not earned the right to show his excessive behavior in
gross detail.  We see him beat a priest senseless with the receiver of a
telephone.  Later, he stuffs a washcloth in the same priest's mouth and
slashes his hand open.  And then he says things like, "Hey, when I was
kicking your ass back there -- did that give you a woody?"  He also uses the
word "fuck" as often as the first person singular, which in this movie is
just that much more spice for the stew.  In a movie that took itself more
seriously, in a more intelligent movie, Crow's acts MIGHT have the context
they needed.  They do not in this one.
On a technical level, the movie's impressive, I guess, but the film leaves
such a wretched taste in the mouth that it's impossible to enjoy.  It also
terminates on the stupidest possible note.  If you knew your buddy was
infected with vampiric blood and was going to turn, would you give him the
van that had all your weapons in it and send him on his way?  But I guess
complaints like that are pointless here.  VAMPIRES really only exists to
show gruesome action a-plenty, and that it has -- but at the cost of
watching a lot of other stuff that's downright repellent and stupid.

Cast: James Woods; Daniel Baldwin; Sheryl Lee
 Vampires is one of the slickest vampire movies to come out of Hollywood is
quite some time.  In fact, I would even go as far to say it is one of the most
entertaining; it ranks right up there behind Interview With the Vampire (1994)
and the original masterpiece, Dracula (1931).
 Not much in the plot department.  Basically the film tells the tale about main
vamp slayer Jack Crow (Woods) and his search for the all-mighty master who is,
also, on a search of his own: To locate a cross that can give him the power to
walk in the sunlight.  In this pic, the vampires aren't scared of crosses,
don't sleep in caskets, don't mind garlic, etc.  I was a little disappointed
about all that stuff.  I like the old fashion sense of when vampires slept in
coffins.
 The amount of gore in this film is surprisingly high.  From the director of
such classics as Halloween (1978) and The Thing (1983), I knew the film would
be violent, yet the level of blood is ominously higher than usual, like
Carpenter was hiding plot holes with carnage, something that he has never done.
 Halloween was actually filmed vise versa, with suspense and atmosphere
frightening instead of gory violence.
 Based on the novel 'Vampire$,' Vampires is a stylishly made, high-octane
thriller, but, undoubtably a little disappointing.  Instead of all that
crimson, maybe Carpenter should have made the master a little like Michael
Myers, all silent, never really seen til the last reel, pounces in sudden
frames.  Overall, Vampires lacks a certain bite, but is nonetheless gruesome
fun.

Call it a horror version of a spaghetti western, with lots and lots of 
sauce. John Carpenter's "Vampires" is an incredibly bloody, gory machismo-
fest, with as much snarling, hateful, no-nonsense manly-man posturing as 
Carpenter can cram into 104 minutes. This is the kind of film that will 
prompt countless Internet postings with subject lines like "'Vampires' 
Kicks Ass!" and "Carpenter Rules!" And trust me, anyone who posts 
otherwise will quickly be deemed a "pussy" or a "queer" by those same 
zealots. 
Based on the novel "Vampire$" by John Steakly, the story focuses on a 
crack team of vampire killers, financed by the Catholic Church, roaming 
the American Southwest looking for head bloodsucker Valek (Thomas Ian 
Griffith), the fallen priest who started the whole undead thing centuries 
ago. Team leader Jack Crow (James Woods) is a coked-up version of the 
standard Carpenter anti-hero: imagine a gaunt Snake Plissken, only way 
more surly, whupping major vampire butt while spitting out vicious one-
liners (at one point he taunts a priest, saying "When I was kicking your 
ass, Father, did you get wood?"). 
Crow's second-in-command, Tony Montoya (Daniel Baldwin), is another man's 
man. He explains the harsh realities of vampires to recently-bitten 
hooker, Katrina (Sheryl Lee), growling "It's not like they're a bunch of 
romantic Eurotrash fags dressed in formal wear." In the hours before a 
victim "turns," they have a telepathic link with the bloodsucker who 
nailed them, so Crow and Montoya coolly inform Katrina that they will use 
her as a vampire radar-detector, but the minute she turns, they'll kill 
her in a flash. In the meantime, they strap her face down on a bed, 
conveniently nude so Carpenter devotees can ogle Lee's shapely rear-end. 
While Montoya baby-sits Katrina, Crow threatens the Catholic powers-that-
be and tortures a priest for information.     
Am I painting a vivid enough picture? If not, here's a little more. The 
vampires are feral creatures, mean as hell and dressed like Marilyn 
Manson roadies. They're extremely violent: Valek slices one victim from 
crotch to head and we get to watch the body split in two, with guts 
spilling all over the place. They're not easy to kill either. Basically, 
you have to stake them, then drag their bodies into the sunlight where 
they burst into flames while screaming and flailing about.
As mentioned earlier, the whole thing plays like a souped-up spaghetti 
western and, for a while, it works. After years of enduring Anne Rice's 
effete Harlequin Romance vampires, it's fun to see the lace-cuffs ripped 
away from the genre. James Woods has a great time playing a bastard and 
it's entertaining watching him enjoy himself. There are some striking 
images: vampires striding confidently across the desert towards the 
camera, Valek lying on the ceiling waiting to strike. There's a great set 
piece at a motel, and the inevitable show-down, while awfully stupid, 
does have a strong sense of perverse style. And, for a while, it's 
amusing listening to dialogue so calculated to offend.
But eventually, the nihilism becomes tiresome, the gore and mayhem grows 
repetitive and you just want the damn thing to end. Carpenter did 
creepier gore in "The Thing." He did more effective fight scenes and B-
movie gags in "They Live" and better stoic macho theatrics in "Escape 
>From New York." "Vampires" is a minor guilty pleasure, but I'm tired of 
watching Carpenter rework his old tricks. It would be so terrific to see 
him try something new, like skipping feature-length pissing contests and 
creating films with actual characters and plots with some meat to them. 
So there you have it. Ed Johnson-Ott's "Review" of John Carpenter's 
"Vampires." Zealots can reach me at pbbp24a@prodigy.com. Feel free to put 
"pussy" or "queer" in the subject line so I'll know it's from you.

Hot on the heels of Blade, we are treated to another vampire-slayer
tale, this time from director John Carpenter.  While not one of his best
directoral efforts, there are enough scares in John Carpenter's Vampires
to please the casual moviegoer.
The hero of John Carpenter's Vampires is Jack Crow (James Woods), a
"slayer", raised by the Catholic church, who leads a team of mercenaries
to find and destroy vampiric infestations throughout the world.  His
current stomping grounds are in New Mexico, which also happens to be the
current home of one Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith), a master vampire who
may be the very first one.
The only link Crow, and his chief sidekick Montoya (Daniel Baldwin),
have to find Valek is a prostitute named Katrina (Sheryl Lee). Katrina
was bitten by Valek, and has a telepathic link to her new master.  The
trouble is, in just a few days, Katrina will become a vampire herself.
So, Crow and Montoya, teaming with a novice Vatican scholar, Father
Giovanni (Gregory Sierra), have little time to track down their most
powerful foe ever.  Meanwhile, Valek has plans of his own, both for Jack
Crow, and his own personal quest for invulnerability.
Unlike in Blade, where vampires were easier to kill than ants with a
magnifying glass...the pests in John Carpenter's Vampires are stubborn
little suckers.  There's probably one too many scenes of a human
repeatedly pounding a stake into a vampire's chest, shouting "Die! Die!
Die!", but at least there's a sense of accomplishment.
Carpenter is able to whip up a few good scares and a couple suspenseful
sequences (most of which involve entering sleeping vampire nests).  But,
most of the time, there's a sense of overkill.  By the time the film's
implausible climax rolls around, you've definitely had your fill of
flashing teeth, wooden stakes, and vampires bursting into flames.
The characters in John Carpenter's Vampires are predictably shallow.
Still, James Woods is cast as the right type as the tough talking, tough
acting hero.  Daniel Baldwin isn't as lucky, stuck as the stupidly
foolish sidekick.  At least Sheryl Lee gets to show a little range,
displaying the gamut of emotions from ecstasy to rage to terror and back
again.
The plot of the film holds little mystery.  (If you can't figure out all
the crucial plot questions by the end of the first reel, you haven't
seen many movies.)  Still, it gets you from site A to site B with a
minimum of fuss.  And, since the strength of this movie is in its
"hunting" scenes, the less between them, the better.
For sheer entertainment, Blade still holds a considerable edge over John
Carpenter's Vampires.  However, if you're just looking for a few good
thrills, this one is certainly better than many recent horror films out
there.

The major release this Halloween is this film based on the John
Steakley-penned novel Vampire$ starring the ever-intense James Woods,
and directed by the man who brought us real fright in THE THING (8/10)
and real fun in BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA (7.5/10): John Carpenter.
PLOT:
Led by Jack Crow (Woods), a team of vampire-killers roam the United
States searching for and obliterating nests of vampires still wandering
the Earth. One day, they meet up with the Master of the vampires,
Valek, who is ready to move his nighttime gig into day. Crow, along
with his trusty companion Montoya (Baldwin), attempt to find and kill
the Master by telepathically connecting to him through some hooker whom
he once lovingly sunk his fangs into. Generous helpings of bloodsucking
and murders ensue. 
CRITIQUE:
Gory, bloody, well-timed, interesting modern tale about vampires
chomping their way into daylight, radiates some original theories, but
slows down in the middle, and winds up weak at the finish line. I loved
the first 20 minutes of this movie, which is pretty much what they've
been showing in the trailers up until now, but didn't care much for the
slower second act, and the over-the-top third. The confrontations with
the actual vampires are the most exciting part about this movie, along
with the great special effects and makeup. But halfway through this
movie, I did find myself counting the number of overdone close-ups of
the very ugly actor James Woods, and his overrated sunglasses.
Having said that, the ending did also contain some very cool fight
scenes, but the authenticity of the conclusion left something to be
desired. On the whole, the acting was good, with Woods playing an
excellent vampire-slayer, who's own father was once bit by a vampire
and tried to kill him. Daniel Baldwin, (the fatter, less talented
brother of Alec) actually came through as the tough side-kick who slaps
girls around (doesn't he always seem to play this role?), while Sheryl
Lee was pretty much wasted as the token whore who also generated
waaaaaay too many close-ups of her face as well. The master vampire,
Thomas Ian Griffith, played his part eloquently and left many a chill
in the audience's spine. The man was just a cool vampire!
Overall, the style of the film was very slick, as well as the John
Carpenter-based score, which had that whole Tex-Mex feel to it. The
special effects and the fighting sequences were also very bloody and
totally awesome, but I suppose the credibility of the last few scenes
could have been quite stronger. I would suggest this film to all
vampire, John Carpenter, and James Woods fans, because it does feature
some entertaining stuff from all three. On the other hand, if you're
sick and tired of vampire movies, or if you expect to find one
redeeming woman character in this entire script, look elsewhere,
because this blood-infested gore-ride is not here to win any political
points. Religious types might also want to stay away, unless they enjoy
the sight of priests and monks being slaughtered by the handful, and
the extreme verbal and physical abuse that the "good priest" in this
film receives. I personally took this film as it was presented to me, a
Halloween-released fun and bloody-carnage based movie, with lots of
killings, a little humour, and no real redeeming point.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
John Carpenter has also been credited on various pictures as Frank
Armitage, Johnny Carpenter, James T. Chance , John T. Chance, Edmond
Dantčs, Rip Haight and Martin Quatermass.
James Woods is alleged to have an IQ of 180. Scored a perfect 800 on
his verbal SATs and a 779 on the math section. He also fired his agent
for not telling him of Quentin Tarantino's offer to star as
Mr.Orange/Freddie in 1992's classic RESERVOIR DOGS (9/10). Looks like
he really IS smart!!!
John Carpenter is known to reuse character names from classic movies,
for example, his John T Chance pseudonym comes from the John Wayne
character name in RIO BRAVO, while Donald Pleasance's character name in
the original HALLOWEEN (6.5/10), Sam Loomis, is the name of Janet
Leigh's boyfriend from original PSYCHO (7/10).
Some fun trivia about John Carpenter includes the fact that he loves
Elvis and old cadillacs, is a major NBA fan and has a satellite dish
installed on his location trailer to keep up with the games, and always
has a portable basketball hoop on location. And of course, my personal
favorite is that his favorite meal of the day is breakfast - any time
of day (what a man!)
Director and writer of THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION (8/10), Frank Darabont,
has a cameo in this film as the "man with the Buick" who gets relieved
of his ownership duties by Baldwin's character.
Sheryl Lee is famous for being "Laura Palmer" from the cult-famed David
Lynch TV show "Twin Peaks", as well as the film version, TWIN PEAKS:
FIRE WALK WITH ME (4/10).
Producer Sandy King was script supervisor on at least three previous
Carpenter films including THEY LIVE (7.5/10), PRINCE OF DARKNESS and
BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA (7.5/10), married John Carpenter in 1990,
and remains married to the director of this film to this day (She's
also known as Sandra Ann Carpenter.)
This film was originally known as VAMPIRE$.
