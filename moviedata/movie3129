Every once in a while, there is one film, that sort of pops out of nowhere,
and one's curiosity is ticked.
Well, when you see a picture on a guy sitting atop a Bentley, steering it
with two cords, in the midst of the outback desert, it's got to be
interesting and hopefully fun.
A bit weird, the recluse Pete, is the oddball in town, a genius actually,
whose best stunts are saved for the 'copers' and the vindictive police
chief, who is trying to land his prize catch in jail.
Pete has a sister, and tired of the stuffiness of his father, takes of with
his sister, in mom's gift, the Bentley.  And his creativity begins coming
around, as he has to find a way to earn a few bucks for gasoline, and a
place to live.  The sister is a good singer, and picks up a few bucks
singing in the local pubs, for a dollar or two.  And by the end of the film,
they have become slightly rich, with the help of Pete's ingenuity.  And they
end up getting the best of the police chief still chasing him, and having to
put up with a maddening Christian lunatic.
The film is fun, the film is weird, and the film is very good.
The music is actually very nice, and well situated, with the songs always
linked to the moment at hand.
Bruce Spence ( the gyroscope pilot in Road Warrior ) is excellent as a
miner, who joins up with the duo and find a slight gold mine in the
process, based on Rikki's details, and knowledge.
Should See It.   The inventions and ingenuity are great.  Check out the
EXTERMINATOR, and when it is used.
