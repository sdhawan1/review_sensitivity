A good eighty-percent of science fiction in the movies owes everything to
horror. Yes, Alien was great, but structurally, what's the real difference
in it and, say, Halloween? Event Horizon and Hellraiser? Yet we tend to
privilege sci-fi over such horror, if only the slightest bit, largely
because the emptiness of space allows one thing horror always has to work so
hard for: isolation. Whereas most of the final girls in horror could just up
and leave town, get themselves out of danger, (if they weren't morally
obliged to stop Jason, etc) Ripley's forever stuck on that ship. To leave is
to die, whereas to stay is to at least have a chance. Meaning her staying
on-board doesn't require any suspension of disbelief, as it often does in
horror, where you're often tempted to talk to the screen, tell these
characters to just leave already. Ripley can't. Supernova is no different
here. It's essentially a horror movie set in space, albeit a horror movie
with James Spader, which ups the ante considerably.
Too, instead of opening with a bang, Supernova starts rather thematically,
with a 22nd (or so) century rerun of a Tom & Jerry episode. Initially, it
looks to be just fluff, something we can share with these future humans, a
comical bridge from us to them, which isn't an uncommon device in sci-fi, as
it allows us both to recognize these people and then identify with them. But
director Thomas Lee uses it a little differently. As things unfold, Tom &
Jerry seems to function almost as a comment on the genre, on how ridiculous
it is that Michael Myers (Tom, here) just keeps getting up, no matter how
cleverly he's killed. He's no normal cat, but of the cartoon-variety. The
same goes for the 'bad' guy in Supernova, the more-than-human, Lost
Boys-looking stalker (Peter Facinelli) hellbent on wiping this crew out.
Granted, he does get to talk, unlike Tom, but they're essentially the same
character.
Which means, yes, we need a Jerry. Enter Nick Vanzant, (Spader) recovering
junkie, able pilot, on his first mission with the aptly-named Nightengale,
an interstellar EMT, complete with the (by now generic) surly doctor,
(Angela Basset, looking like Strange Days) token sex-kitten, (Robin Tunney;
even Galaxy Quest had one) disposable captain, lovable programmer, an
android, a female HAL, ('Sweetie") and Yerzy, (Lou Diamond Phillips) who's
strangely showing some grey at first. Don't fret, though; his greyness is
written in, or, better yet, telegraphed. Yes, you can figure it all out a
third of the way into it. But still, it's fun. For one, there's the ship,
which has the coolest way of 'bending' space since Dune, probably. Too,
there's all the Black Hole stuff going on, how the Nightengale gets trapped
in the gravity well of a blue giant, only has so long, etc. And finally,
there's the artifact, which turns out to work much like the sphere in
Sphere, and is just as important to existence as the fifth element was in
Fifth Element.
However. As important as the artifact is made out to be, still, when it's
all said and done and the people who make it out alive have made it out
alive, the universe doesn't really feel saved, mostly because it never
really felt threatened in the first place. Supernova would likely have been
better off keeping the danger local, only putting the crew in jeopardy.
Granted, it makes for a great trailer, but it results in some disappointment
in the theater. Too, it all happens so fast. Not that 90 minutes isn't an
appropriate time for a cerebral action-thriller heavily dependent upon
effects, but it doesn't feel quite long enough for Supernova. Or, rather,
Supernova feels rushed, makes you suspect a lot was left on the editing room
floor, though that likely wasn't the case. In all likelihood, even, the fact
of the matter is that a lot of it was likely left in the pen, when Supernova
was being written, which is too bad for Spader. He's great as usual, but
when it comes right down to the final scene, it's not Vanzant's Jerry-like
cleverness which saves the day, but brute strength. It was a disappointment
in Resurrection, and it's a disappointment here. On the upbeat, though,
Supernova does, in the closing frames, introduce some fluidless sex that
Cronenberg would have been proud of. Perhaps that's why Spader signed on. It
wasn't for the story, anyway.

        That appears to be a guiding principle in Hollywood: look in any
movie guide and you'll find literally hundreds of films cross-indexed under
the categories "Alien Beings, Unfriendly" and "Space Operettas."  Ridley
Scott's "Alien," arguably the best of these, started a trend in 1979, but
even *it* was based on a B-movie from the '50s called "It! The Terror from
Beyond Space."  Essentially, Hollywood has been telling the same old story
over and over again.
        Next up is "Supernova," the latest science-fiction adventure to
feature a ragtag band of space derelicts who answer a distress call and
bring onboard some malevolent extra-terrestrial lifeforce that starts
picnicking on them.
        I suppose there's a certain cathartic pleasure in witnessing one's
fellow man being stalked and eaten by nasty aliens: rather them than us,
eh?  But why have so many of these recent movies assembled an intriguing
cast and then made them nothing more than creature kibble?  Whereas
"Supernova" isn't much better than "Event Horizon" (a well-cast film from
1997 that got very silly very quickly), it didn't put me to sleep.
Although the details leading up to the inevitable moment when the bad guy
is forced into the airlock escape me, so perhaps it did.
        Aboard medical rescue vessel Nightingale 229, this week's
intriguing cast of James Spader, Angela Bassett, Robert Forster, Robin
Tunney ("End of Days"), Wilson Cruz, and Lou Diamond Phillips (remember
him?) answers the obligatory distress call somewhere in the 22nd century.
The distressee, it turns out, is not some freaky two-headed, one-eyed
drooling monster thing, but an attractive male specimen called Troy Larson
(Peter Facinelli).  This proves to be fortunate because the crew in
"Supernova" has been getting it on like nobody's business.  I guess it's
pretty boring out there in deep space, but this is a PG-13 rated movie
after all, and there's a lot of coupling going on...at least until there's
nobody left to couple with.
        In addition to bringing Troy onboard, the crew also discover an
eerie lifeform on his shuttle that looks like a magenta-colored lava lamp.
They only have an eleven-minute window to get the heck out of there after
the Nightingale's crippled engines recharge since that star down there is
about to go supernova, by the way.
        What raises "Supernova" a little--and I do mean a little--above the
rest is its script by David Campbell Wilson, which is lightly peppered with
clever dialogue, some of it throwaway biblical.  Bassett, as the
Nightingale's chief medical officer, is fascinating as always; her
character is easily the most interesting, with the possible exception of
the ship's breathy-voiced computer--did someone say Mother!?  Spader
("Crash") gives a good accounting of himself, especially whenever he's
around Bassett.
        Unfortunately, the menace in "Supernova" is strictly
one-dimensional, even with that big bang threatening, and the special
effects too run of the mill to make any serious headway.  In addition, the
film seems surprisingly short--when the end credits snuck up on me I was
still anticipating a third act, or a twist, or both.  I suspect this has
something to do with the fact that "Supernova" was set to open Christmas of
last year but some post-production tinkering kept the film out of theaters
until now.  Why would respected director Walter Hill be credited as Thomas
Lee, for example?
        If the filmmakers weren't happy with "Supernova," then why on earth
should we be?

Supernova is one super mess.  This sci-fi film is highly derivative, but
not even of decent space flicks.  It seems to have chosen only the bad
ones to rip off.  The story is simple:  A spaceship picks up a really
bad guy that tries to off everyone aboard.  Typically, he can also heal
his own injuries.  And speaking of being able to heal your own injuries,
here's a person that can't  Walter Hill.  The Last Man Standing
director asked that his name be taken off of the credits after the
studio recut the film.  Reportedly, Francis Ford Coppola reshot several
scenes.
The spaceship in question is the Nightingale, an emergency rescue vessel
that gets a five-day-old distress call from a mining colony located over
3,000 light years away.  Thanks to choppy editing, the complete lack of
character set-up and the weirdly similar hair colors/styles, the six
people aboard the Nightingale are tough to tell apart.  There's Dr.
Kaela Evers (Angela Bassett, Music of the Heart)  the black one  and
Benj Sotomejor (Wilson Cruz, Party of Five)  the one with the beard.
The other four all have short, black haircuts.
Rushing to the origin of the S.O.S. call, the Nightingale `jumps' into a
high gravity field, where debris from a moon damages the craft's
engines, leaving a precious eleven-minute window between the point of
recharge and being sucked into a giant sun.  To make matters worse, the
captain (Robert Forster, Psycho) doesn't survive the jump and creepy
recovering drug addict Nick Vanzant (James Spader, 2 Days in the Valley)
takes control of the mission.
But Nick doesn't seem nearly as disturbing as the person that placed the
distress call.  He's Troy Larson (Peter Facinelli, Can't Hardly Wait),
the son of some renowned space baddie.  He's pure evil and makes
everyone nervous, yet somehow is still able to nail the mouth-breathing
white girl Danika Lund (Robin Tunney, End of Days), despite the fact
that she's considering parenthood with her fellow space cadet boyfriend
Yerzy Penalosa (Lou Diamond Phillips, Bats).  And the Nightingale picks
up not only this space hitchhiker, but also a strange nine-dimensional
substance that, of course, can wipe out humanity.
The laughable plot (or lack thereof) comes from David Campbell Wilson,
whose only other screenwriting credit is Jeff Speakman's martial arts
extravaganza The Perfect Weapon.  There are a couple of cool parts, like
the exterior shots of the Nightingale, and the fact Danika and Yerzy had
to fill out an application to be approved before they could consider
bringing another life into the world.  Hopefully in the future, it will
be as complicated to make a bad film as it is to reproduce.
1:41 - PG-13 for sci-fi action violence, adult situations and enough
near nudity to fend off an R rating

_Supernova_ (PG-13) no stars (out of ****)
        Now, the movie so bad, not even Alan Smithee wanted his name on it.  OK,
perhaps that's really not the case--"Thomas Lee" was the agreed-upon
pseudonym by director Walter Hill and MGM--but this long-delayed,
much-tinkered-with sci-fi film is the year's first unqualified disaster. 
Sometime in the future, the crew of a space paramedic vessel answers a
distress signal, picks up a mysterious stranger (Peter Facinelli), and,
as the poster says, "all hell breaks loose" over an even more mysterious
alien artifact the stranger brings along with him.
        Perhaps the original script lived up to the promise of the intriguing
premise because the film, as released, certainly doesn't.  In the midst
of the many re-edits the film underwent on the long road from shooting to
screen, all sense of coherence was lost.  For most of the running time,
it's hard to understand or care about what's going on, and some of the
ideas thought up in the 11th hour--such as the addition of a second
zero-gravity sex scene, with James Spader and Angela Bassett's heads
digitally attached to the bodies of the principals in the film's other
weightless shag, Facinelli and Robin Tunney--just add to the confusion. 
As lost as the audience gets, no one in the auditorium can come close to
the bewilderment exhibited by the cast.  Spader is somnambulently morose;
Bassett's earnest intensity seems ridiculously out of place for a piece
of cheese such as this; the bland Facinelli exhibits no air of menace
whatsoever; Lou Diamond Phillips, Wilson Cruz, and Robert Forster (who
receives third billing for a five-minute part) simply go through the
motions; and a clueless Tunney makes you wonder if she could possibly be
the same person who gave such a bravura turn in 1998's _Niagara_Niagara_.
 I would call _Supernova_ this  year's _Virus_, but that film was at
least laughable.  _Supernova_ just lies on the screen dead, boring as all
hell.

"Here we are, caught in the gravitational pull of a blue giant, and all
you can think about is sex," Troy Larson (Peter Facinelli) says to
Danika Lund (Robin Tunney).  Amazingly, sex is indeed the theme of
SUPERNOVA, an incorrectly rated PG-13 science fiction film.  Laced with
frequent nudity and scenes of floating naked bodies having sex, the
movie cries out to be rated R.  Given the show's theme and its rating
one can expect lots of kids under 13 to see it, as there were in my
audience.
Originally directed by Walter Hill (48 HRS.), who reportedly asked to
have his name removed after the studio recut his movie, the film now
lists Thomas Lee, Walter Hill's pseudonym, as the director.  With acting
this lethargic, it's quite difficult, however, to see how editing could
do much to change the quality of the picture for the better or the
worse.  (The studio decided to run it without the normal advanced
screening for critics so that no reviews could appear until after it
opened.)
In this rehash of dozens of other science fiction films, the medical
rescue vessel Nightingale is answering a distress signal from a
supposedly abandoned mine.  The mine is on a moon that is so far off
that the ship has to make a dimensional jump, sort of a leap through
hyperspace, to get there.  What is the one thing necessary to accomplish
such a jump?  Nudity, of course.  The men and women of the crew get
naked together before tucking themselves into their snug little
Plexiglas beds.  Think of all of the fun that the Millennium Falcon's
crew has been missing.
On board this fearless space ambulance are A.J. Marley (Robert Forster),
Kaela Evers (Angela Bassett), Nick Vanzant (James Spader), Yerzy
Penalosa (Lou Diamond Phillips), Benj Sotomejor (Wilson Cruz) and
Danika.  Troy is a mysterious stranger that they pick up from the mine.
Troy's despicable father, Karl, once dated Kaela.  Small universe, huh?
Troy has brought with him a glimmering object in the shape of a lava
lamp.  Featuring nothing less than "ninth dimension matter," this mean
little piece of plasma is -- surprise! -- trouble.  Like the rest of the
special effects in the film, which rely heavily on flashing lights and
fog to create the atmospherics, the look of this devilish substance is
cheap.  But given the 10 minutes of credits at the end of the picture to
the film's technical teams, one suspects that lots of the studio's money
was wasted in the creation of these lame effects.
"The only real sin is regret," Troy tells Danika, as a sexual come-on.
One suspects that most of the people associated with this film will be
filled with regret that they ever had anything to do with it.  Only
briefly as a guilty pleasure for adults does the picture have anything
to recommend it.
SUPERNOVA runs 1:25.  It is rated PG-13 for sex, nudity and violence.
It would be acceptable for older teenagers.

2000 - 85 minutes
Rated PG-13 (for violence, sex, and brief nudity).
Reviewed by Dustin Putman, January 15, 2000.
There once was a sci-fi film that MGM budgeted at $60-million plus that went 
through directors as it was filming just about as quickly as a child goes 
through candy. The first smart soul left citing creative differences. Then 
Walter Hill came onboard the project, but after seeing his vision sliced down 
to a nearly unrecognizable 85 minutes, he requested his name be taken off and 
replaced with the pseudonym of Thomas Lee. Rumor has it that even Francis 
Ford Coppola was hired to film the reshoots. Every filmmaker, it seems, had 
the right idea when deciding they didn't want to take credit for the film. By 
the way, the film I speak of is "Supernova," it has allegedly sat on the 
shelf for almost two years, and it is a haphazard excuse for a movie, the 
type that you watch and then immediately wonder if the studio expected one 
person in the whole audience to walk out of the theater liking it. Handling 
your very negative feelings about "Supernova," you can either get angry at 
having part of your night wasted, or you can heartily laugh and make fun of 
it on the drive home from the theater. My filmgoing companions and I chose 
the latter---with a vengeance! 
Even in the opening minutes, "Supernova" screams of severe post-production 
editing, and you'd suspect it was to salvage any sort of remains of a 
worthwhile motion picture. But remember MGM's 1998 thriller, "Disturbing 
Behavior." After whittling down the poor director's vision from 110 to a 
ridiculously short 83 minutes, out went any signs of character development 
and in came one plot hole after the next. The deleted scenes were then 
resurrected on DVD, and after watching the 110-minute version, I grew a deep 
sympathy for all involved, except the culprits at MGM. Even the 83-minute cut 
of "Disturbing Behavior," however, is reminiscent of "Gone With the Wind" 
compared to the bone-headed plotting and amateurish cutting of "Supernova."
The cast is filled with such talent, both from veterans and rising stars, 
that it is an unfortunate state of affairs when every single one of them can 
fall for appearing in a movie that has been so distinctly recycled from 
countless other films. "Supernova" may have been chopped up and stir-fried to 
its current paltry length, but no cutting in the world can hide the fact that 
this story did not need to be told again, and the millions of dollars 
certainly did not need to be so egregiously wasted. Making things more 
depressing is that the visual effects look like they have come right out of a 
direct-to-video movie. Where did all that money go to? Did the cast and crew 
literally throw the hundred dollar bills up in the air and, to entertain 
themselves, shoot at it with guns during the breaks in filming?
Supposedly set in the 23rd-century, since I read this in a magazine article 
(the year is never mentioned in the film itself), on the medical rescue 
vessel Nightingale, which must answer a distress signal, the inhabitants 
include...oh, why bother with names or characters? The screenwriter and 
editor sure didn't. At the mine where the signal is coming from, they meet 
Troy (Peter Facinelli), who is welcomed aboard and turns out to be an alien 
and kills everyone aside from the first two actors billed in the credits. The 
vessel continues off into space, and the title "Supernova" appears on the 
screen, which then fades to black. The end. Sound like something you want to 
pay your money towards? I didn't think so.

        If you've seen the TV commercials for "Supernova," you may have
noticed the ads don't tell who's starring in the film, which may lead
you to suspect it has a cast of unknowns. Surprise -- it actually
features Angela Bassett, James Spader, Lou Diamond Phillips, Wilson Cruz
("My So-Called Life") and Robin Tunney ("End of Days").
 So why hide these stars? Probably because "Supernova" is such a
superbomb the actors wish they could take their names off of it.
 That's exactly what director Walter Hill has done. The movie
now bears the credit "directed by Thomas Lee," even though Hill oversaw
the shooting of this sci-fi adventure during the summer of 1998 (and
fellow director Francis Ford Coppola reportedly had a hand in the film's
extensive cutting and re-cutting throughout last year).
 What Hill and Coppola have ultimately come up with is an
incoherent, often ridiculous yarn which steals heavily from "Alien,"
"The Abyss" and "Sphere" but still yields pitiful results. Were it not
for the marquee value of the talent involved, "Supernova" would likely
have crashed and burned at the neighborhood video store instead of
hitting the local cineplex. Perhaps the only remarkable thing about this
foolishness is the amount of nudity (mostly male) the filmmakers managed
to cram in while still earning only a PG-13 rating.
 For the few who might still be intrigued, "Supernova" is set in
the far future, aboard a kind of spaceship/ambulance called Nightingale
(get it?). After the captain is fried in an accident, recovering drug
addict Nick Van Zant (Spader) takes command of the ship and stakes a
claim on no-nonsense doctor Kaela Evers (Bassett), who needs only a
bottle of pear brandy to turn her disposition from stormy to
sugar-sweet.
 Sex in the zero-gravity chamber has to be put on hold, though,
when the Nightingale receives a distress call from a mining colony on
gypsy moon Titan 37. Despite reservations, the crew agrees to take sole
survivor Troy Larson (Peter Facinelli) aboard, along with the
gooey-looking glowing object he's salvaged. That artifact turns out to
house galaxy-destroying "ninth-dimensional matter" (which looks
suspiciously like the contents of a lava lamp, by the way), and, given
this set-up, you can probably finish the script yourself.
 Anyone hoping Bassett might have a chance here to show off her
panache as an action star as she did so memorably in "Strange Days" will
be disappointed to learn she spends most of the movie either glowering
or jogging through corridors. Spader seems to be looking for an exit,
while most of the supporting cast struggle to hold on to their dignity.
In a frantic attempt to build suspense where none exists, the filmmakers
keep their cameras bobbing and weaving woozily over each scene. Perhaps
the photography team sampled a bit of that pear brandy themselves.
 "It's a bomb!" Dr. Evers gasps when she first realizes the
potential power of the alien force. Any audience member will agree
whole-heartedly. James Sanford

Story by William Malone and Daniel Chuba
Starring James Spader, Angela Bassett, Robert Forster, Lou Diamond
Phillips, Peter Facinelli, Robin Tunney, and Wilson Cruz
 When near objects of immense gravity such as black holes, it is said
that all things bend.  Perhaps it is only fitting that a movie such as
Supernova, which poses as sci-fi / mystery / horror and that takes place
near an object of large gravity, should have the plot twists bent.
Common sense tells us that if you bend something that is already bent it
will either become more bent or straighten out.  Supernova's plot twists
straight out, and the result is something completely by the books.
 Supernova is the story about a rescue vessel sent into deep space to
pick someone up from a rogue moon.  To make a short story shorter, they
find both the person (who is, of course, accompanied with creepy music)
and an alien artifact capable of creating new matter.  Every person who
touches the stuff becomes endowed with superhuman strength.
 Since the creepy guy the crew picked up from the planet has touched the
thing, and since he is obviously the bad guy, the rest of the crew
spends all of their time trying to stop him.
 That's about it.  I have eliminated your need to see it.
 Supernova is so absolutely traditional that it voyages into the realm
of idiocy.  It is as if someone had taken the morons guide to sci-fi and
used it to create a film, step by step, with no originality.
 The cast is remarkably top-notch for the occasion.  Angela Bassett,
James Spader, Robert Forster, Robin Tunney, and Lou Diamond Phillips
help comprise the cast of what amounts to a very bad movie.  If they had
all combined their talent, rewrote the script, and filmed it themselves
they could have done better.
 As proof of how much this film is terrible, even the director didn't
want it on him.  Although the director is credited as Thomas Lee, he is
actually Walter Hill of 48 Hours and Last Man Standing.  Any time a
director tries to conceal the fact that they made the picture, it is bad
news, and Supernova is proof of this thesis.
 The last really, really cheesy sci-fi horror about a rescue vessel,
Event Horizon had some Latin in it: liberte tutu meus ex inferni.  The
translation of this is "Save yourself from Hell."  Save yourself from
Supernova it's a step in the right direction.

"Karl Larson, he's the worst nightmare I ever met," a repulsed Angela
Bassett, chief medical expert aboard the Nightingale 229 medical rescue
vessel, warns of an emergency caller from a distant star sector. Robert
Forster (of "Jackie Brown" fame) decides to react without regard for
Angela's caution, risking the ship and crew in a dangerous "plasma warp" in
order to heed Larson's call. Actually, the warp sequence is pretty cool.
Forster is a strong actor; too bad he isn't used much. Co-pilot Spader (who
you might not recognize from his big-haired "Sex, Lies, and Videotapes"
days) picks up the slack. He performs the sharp, soft-spoken, tough-guy role
flawlessly. He and Angela flirt maturely; while crew members Lou Diamond and
Robin Tunny are considerably less subtle. Even less subtle in this respect,
Peter Facinelli (reminiscent of a Tom Cruise) is powerfully menacing,
alluringly buff, and dramatically "as strong as a horse." He's a very good
bad guy.
Seems our distress caller, Peter, has brought a little something special on
board: something erotically enticing and cosmically tragic, something "as
smart as God and a lot less nice." It's a fine core around which to script a
film. However well conceived, the picture ignores this beautiful object's
potential gravity, neglecting it for bad-guy-on-board action that just
happens to be in 22nd century space. For this reason, the title and the film
become somewhat estranged.
Trivial side note: A cool sounding name, "Supernova" refers to the explosion
of a star; but ironically, roughly translated in Spanish means "a big no
go." (Chevy realized this some years back.)
"Supernova" is simple, but well paced. It's graphically clean on the screen
and offers a bit of mindless movie fun. If you can endure a couple of "Leave
me behind and take the patient" kind of silly heroisms, as well as a lack of
real substance, you won't have a bad time.
Supernova. (C)2000. Rated PG-13.

I wish I was around when kids spent their weekends at the movies watching
serials with each other, playfully shouting at the screen, just there to be
entertained. I imagine an adult version of such fare would be "Supernova", a
new sci-fi thriller in which the plot progresses at a playful tempo and the
characters and the somewhat inane plot actually seem to be more important than
the surrounding awe, unlike a certain big space blockbuster released two years
back.
In future times (a specific date is never given), small crews are apparently
sent into deep space for assorted missions, the subject of which here is the
Nightingale, a rescue vessel touring the universe just in case there's a
distress call from other space missions. The crew consists of six, Benjamin
(Wilson Cruz), Danika Lund (Robin Tunney), Yerzy Penalosa (Lou Diamond
Phillips), lead doctor Kaela Evers (Angela Bassett), newcomer, a former
military pilot, Nick Vanzant (James Spader), and their captain (A.J. Marley).
Quick into the film, they receive a distress call from another dimension and
are forced to "jump" into it. The captain is killed in the jump and Spader's
character takes over as captain.
So, in the middle of all this madness, who sent the distress call? Apparently a
name that Kaela recognizes, Carl Larson, "your worst nightmare". Or is he? He
says he's Troy (Peter Facinelli), Carl's son, who has just discovered an
amazing secret of life, an odd enigma of an object which makes you grow
stronger physically, but, as suggested by the holes in the film's plot, not
mentally, and may be doing more harm than good. What follows is a series of
quick paced, occasionally quick witted, events.
Indeed, Thomas Lee's (a pseudonym for director Walter Hill) "Supernova"
definitely has its flaws to go right along with its, as they say, moments.
Let's start with the obvious. This is one hades of a spaceship. It's huge, and
that's not hyperbole. It could match those space stations in "2001". And while
that's fun to look at sometimes, and may be impressive, what's it doing here?
They're just a rescue crew made up of roughly seven individuals who tour the
galaxy waiting around for distress signals. Why all that hardware for so few
people with even littler opportunity to use it? And they aren't even
particularly good effects, even if they are big.
Then there's those off-the-shelf, standardized subplots. Namely, romantic
encounters between Bassett and Spader, and Phillips and Tunney. Since when did
the government start providing a big old spaceship (lest we return to that
subject) so that groups of people could have private orgies in deep space? From
the futuristic setting, I thought Clinton was long out of office in this movie.
But, what I liked about the movie is that occasionally the characters shone
through those effects as well. I'm not rushing to give credit to screenwriters,
though. The dialogue isn't bright, but the more talented of the ensemble make
it sound interesting. James Spader seems to be the most effective at this,
though Angela Bassett comes close too. They made a movie that could have been a
tepid, uninvolving replay of other equally pathetic films into something mildly
entertaining, even passable.
And then there's the little things, like the ship's original captain earning
his PhD from watching old episodes of "Tom and Jerry", or Bassett routinely
shouting "STAT!" in her medical dialogues, apparently inferring that she got
her degree from watching reruns of "ER". Or the fact that there must be a
little interference from Troy in the relationship between two of our
protagonists, simply so their can be a conflict between the two men.
There are some interesting ideas established throughout "Supernova", but the
problem is that they are ignored in favor of a depressing, fight-it-out, man to
man climax, and so I cannot recommend it. I am reminded that roughly one-half
of the way into "Supernova", when asked about the aforementioned odd, life
renewing object by her crew mate, Bassett remarks that it must have been made
by someone "Smart as God and a lot less nice." And? Who are they? Gee, I dunno.
The studio that turned down this script before it went to MGM?

Susan Granger's review of "SUPERNOVA" (M.G.M release)
        The behind-the-scenes story is far more interesting than this
mundane sci-fi thriller which should disappear as quickly as it popped
into our local theaters without previous critics' screenings. It seems
Walter Hill (48 Hours, Aliens) abandoned the project more than a year
ago, using a pseudonym, Thomas Lee, as titular director. And rumor has
it that Francis Ford Coppola did the final assemblage but he is not
officially mentioned anywhere in the film credits either. The story,
written without a cohesive structure by David Campbell Wilson,
revolves around the search and rescue patrol of a medical ship and its
six-member crew in the 22nd century. When their vessel, the
Nightingale 229, answers an emergency distress signal from an
abandoned mining colony on a rogue moon in a distant galaxy, the crew
soon finds itself in danger from the mysteriously charismatic young
man, Peter Facinelli, whom they rescue, the alien artifact he smuggled
aboard, and the gravitational pull of a giant, imploding star about to
go supernova, creating the most massive explosion in the
universe. Robert Forster is the Captain of the deep-space ambulance
but he's killed off quickly, allowing James Spader, his First Officer,
to take the helm, along with Angela Bassett, as Chief Medical
Officer. Robin Tunney, Lou Diamond Phillips, and Wilson Cruz complete
the crew - along with their trusty computer named Sweetie. On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, Supernova is a sputtering, pointless
3. Something went terribly wrong - and not in outer space.

Canadian Rating-14A
MGM Pictures - 01/00
No one seems to want their name displayed on the new sci-fi thriller
`Supernova'. Action director Walter Hill (`48 Hours') demanded his name
be replaced by the pseudonym Thomas Lee (a new version of the infamous
Alan Smithee). His request was granted. It is also rumored that the
legendary Francis Ford Coppola stepped in after Hill retreated to finish
editing the film for release. Not surprisingly, his name is also nowhere
to be found. A poisonous black cloud of negative buzz surrounded this
notoriously troubled production from the start. But is it really as
terrible as you've been told?
Hell yes. `Supernova' is a lifelessly dull, derivative mess of a film.
The action sequences contain no excitement whatsoever. The scenes
intended to build a suspenseful atmosphere don't even begin to raise the
heart-rate. The movie is like a drugged-up race horse that doesn't even
make it out of the gate - the drugs being the endless post-production
tampering that occurred to make the film most presentable. I imagine
stars like James Spader and Angela Bassett, who have something of a
Hollywood image and are trying to maintain it, are really sweating it
because `Supernova' was actually released. You see, January is the
`aww-heck-let's release-it-now' month. Movies are dumped here with the
mild hope of a warm box office reception because the competition would
be too ferocious elsewhere. In essence, `Supernova' is the definitive
January release. In the heart of winter comes a movie that will really
send a chill up your spine (and not in a positive sense).
`Supernova' follows Emergency Medical Rescue Vessel `Nightingale', and
all of the crew who dwell within. Captain Marley (Robert Forster) enjoys
researching the history of cartoons (and that is the extent of his
character). Dr. Kaela Evers (Bassett) is the chief medical officer, who
says `S.T.A.T.!!' a lot. The remainder of the crew includes engineer
Benj Sotomejor (Wilson Cruz) and two horny technicians (Lou Diamond
Phillips and Robin Tunney), who enjoy fooling around in zero gravity.
Sex seems to be the most amusing way to pass the time on the
`Nightingale', because it occupies a distressing majority of William
Malone's predictable rip-off of a screenplay. Or perhaps calling the
film a `rip-off' would be conceding too much credit. The film mixes
elements of `Alien', `Sphere' and `Event Horizon' - but nary a clever
twist is made.
Anyhoo, the ship intercepts a distress signal sent from a nearby moon
where a mining expedition is in progress. Unfortunately, Captain
Marley's brain implodes during a botched dimension jump, and recovering
drug-addict Nick Vanzant (Spader) takes command. To make a long story
short, they pick up a space scavenger (Peter Facinelli) who is
transporting a glowing orb of Jell-O mold, and everyone is violently
killed off until only Nick and Kaela remain. Any details of the plot are
rendered incomprehensible, and the movie slips into an intergalactic
coma from here on in. The climactic effect is true boredom once you
realize how little `Supernova' has to offer. All there is for
entertainment value is a few periodic flashes of colorful special
effects.... some of which are eye catching, but most are
straight-to-video quality. In short, the whole experience is depressing.
It's hard to say if there was ever the slightest hint of promise behind
the production of `Supernova'. If there ever was, that promise was
obviously suffocated in a plastic wrap of post-production tampering.
Several scenes from the trailer have disappeared without a trace, and
virtually every loose-end is left unattended. Tack on an anticlimactic
finale, and you have a science-fiction film with no thrills, no laughs
and (in return) no foreseeable audience. You might be curious to see how
perpetually bad `Supernova' is. Don't be. I will sum up the 85-minute
experience (which, by the way, felt twice as long) in a nutshell:  crew
on ship talk and have sex. Distress signal is received and answered.
Mysterious survivor comes aboard, and kills everyone. Mysterious
survivor is killed. There. The end... unless, of course, you march out
to the lobby and demand your money back.

Directed by: Walter Hill
Written by: William Malone (story), Daniel Chuba
It's never a good sign when a director won't allow his name to be shown in a
film's credits. Director Walter Hill has used his pseudonym, Thomas Lee, here,
which set warning bells off for me before ever reaching the movie. The fact
that the script has been worked on by numerous different writers and that MGM
didn't allow for an advance screening to critics, further went to show what a
dog they had on their hands here. As a result, I went in expecting a godawful
film. Sure enough, what I got was a piece of garbage. A rather nice looking
one, but still trash through and through.
The deep space medical ship, Nightingale, has just picked up a distress signal
from an abandoned mining colony. The crew is led by Nick Vanzant (James Spader)
after the former captain, A. J. Marley (Robert Forster), is killed in the first
fifteen minutes. The medical staff is comprised of Kaela Evers (Angela
Bassett), Yerzy Peneloza (Lou Diamond Phillips), Danika Lund (Robin Tunney) and
Benj Stotomajor (Wilson Cruz). Upon reaching the colony, the crew finds one
man, Troy Larson (Peter Facinelli), who is in posession of an alien object he
found at the site and whose father had a fling with Kaela. It soon appears that
Troy has been influenced in some way by the artifact, and he is now after the
crew. Meanwhile, an accident has caused the ship to run out of fuel, and they
are slowly being sucked into a nearby star.
If my plot summary sounds rather insipid, that's because the film itself is so
utterly ludicrous. We know everything that is going to happen well before it
happens: who's going to die, who's going to live, and even how they're going to
die in most cases. After a dull, plodding start, which I suppose was present to
develop the characters (it failed miserably), the film leaps into overdrive and
doesn't let up; this includes the camera bouncing all over the place (i.e. "The
Blair Witch Project"). As for the acting, very little is required. Besides
Spader and Bassett, the crew members are required to scream a lot and run
around. Spader is rather humorous at times, particularly when speaking with the
ship's computer in a few surprisingly amusing scenes.
The film is certainly rubbish, but it's refuse that is pleasing to the eye. The
ship itself is an interesting design, looking something like the Nostromo from
"Alien" crossed with a modern space shuttle. The moon on which the mining camp
is located looks wonderful during several scenes; especially those in which
Spader walks along a massive tunnel and we are granted a view of the entire
camp with the blue star in the background. The alien artifact is oddly
designed, with waves of energy constantly pulsating from it and distorting all
objects nearby. As for the film's ending (which I normally wouldn't mention but
I feel obliged to here), it never exactly ends. The film simply stops, leaving
us with several small unanswered questions and one huge one. The nice thing is,
you won't care in the slightest after leaving the theatre.
Robin Tunney (End of Days) is quickly approaching being one of my least
favorite actors. The girl may be attractive, but she obviously cannot act her
way out of a paper bag. Her part here requires a slight acting job, and she
still fails to deliver an adequate performance (not that her dialogue was any
help). "Supernova" may be rated PG-13, but it sure pushes that rating to
extremes. The film is full of nudity, violence and sex. It just screams for an
R rating, but all the scenes are cut just around it so you seldom fully see
anything. The movie runs 125 minutes which could easily have been hacked down
to 95 or so. I'd recommend missing this one and grant it two stars.

Supernova (1999--or 2000, depending on who you ask...) 
Review Copyright Rose Cooper, 2000
Review URL: http://www.3blackchicks.com/bamssupernova.html
[Author's note: Before I begin this rant...
The astute follower of my normal 3BC reviews will note something 
different about this "review" right away: I dispensed with the normal 
credits which have always been part of my particular writing style, and 
the remainder of this text will be an all-out rant about that 
abomination masquerading as a movie, and calling itself "Supernova".  
For those who came here expecting a thoughtful, decent review, my 
apologies; I'll do better in the future, given better material to start 
with.  If you need a quick-n-dirty recommendation, I can sum it up in 
three simple words: "This Flick Sucked.", and direct you to read our 
other reviews for this week.  For those masochists for whom that is 
simply not enough, I give you: The Bammer Rant On The Godawful 
Abomination Masquerading As A Movie, Calling Itself "Supernova".
The UnStory (no spoilers, since there was no story.)
Friends, romans, countrymen, lend me your ear: if you have even the most 
miniscule faith in my ability to judge a movie, you will run--not 
walk--run away from any movie review that suggests you go see this most 
dreadful collection of frames of moving images running swiftly together 
which would normally be called "film" but could not by any stretch of 
the imagination be honoured with such a label.
I have seen Bad Movies in my life.  I have seen "Lost In Space".  I have 
seen "A Night At The Roxbury".  I have seen "Caligula".  But nothing - 
y'all don't hear me; I'll say it once again: N O T H I N G - I have seen 
in my 37 years on this third rock from the sun, could possibly compare 
to the hour and a half of torture I endured watching the collection of 
frames of moving images that I won't dare name again, lest I suffer more 
seizures.
If the above does not convince you, consider this: the collection of 
frames of moving images was so ashamed of itself, it did not have 
opening titles or credits at all; if one was so inclined to ride out the 
length of the collection of frames of moving images (and more than half 
of the people in the theater during this showing, were not so inclined), 
one would have to wait until the end to know what the title was.  That 
might not be enough to convince you--after all, it could've just been 
Clever! And! Hip!  It wasn't, but it could've been trying to be, so 
consider this also: the collection of frames of moving images, stopped 
working during the final scene.  None of us in the audience, cared.  
Even when it started working again, none of us cared.  Many of us left, 
well before the break.  And when the torture was finally over and we all 
filed out of the theater with blood in our eyes and hatred in our hearts 
for the normally-decent James Spader, Angela Bassett, and Lou Diamond 
Phillips for the exercise in mental masturbation they performed on the 
screen, theater ushers greeted us at the door with free passes, 
apologizing profusely for the break.  I like to think that they were led 
by a Higher Power to apologize profusely for the excrement that made its 
way to the screen.
Please. Don't. Go. To. This...Thing.  And if you ignore me and do go, 
please let me know, so I can laugh heartily as you writhe in misery.
[End note to those review purists who'll no doubt wish to chastise me 
for wasting your time with this rant: save it.  I warned you at the 
beginning, and you read on anyway?  Your bad.] 
Bammer's Bottom Line: 
This Flick Sucked.  It sucked the lifeforce right out of me; so much so 
that I was unable to stay in the theater to watch "Girl, Interrupted" 
afterwards, as I had planned on doing.  I had to run quickly out of the 
theater house before I stumbled upon the Projectionists Room; I had 
matches, and I knew how to use them.
May it die the quick boxoffice death it so richly deserves.

 Starring James Spader, Angela Bassett, Peter Facinelli. Directed by
Walter Hill (pseudonyms be damned). Rated PG-13.
Isn't it the ultimate sign of a movie's cinematic ineptitude when you
can't think of much to say about it other than "it sucks"? One of the
first official year 2000 releases, Supernova is such a movie. I can't
seem to get past one-word adjectives with this one,
although "boring," "stupid" and "absurd" doesn't amount to much of a
review. A shame. I would have been able to save myself the chore of
desperately trying to elaborate. But c'est la vie. Here goes nothing.
I'll keep it short.
I suppose the first bad omen for Supernova came when director Walter
Hill (48 Hours) removed his name from the movie, requesting that it be
replaced with the pseudonym Thomas Lee. The film's fate was sealed in
many minds when struggling studio MGM declined to screen it for the
press, an event usually signifying a studio's lack of confidence in a
particular movie. Hill's and MGM's actions were prudent.
When the captain of medical space vessel Nightingale dies in a tragic
hyperjump accident, a reformed drug addict who is also the first
officer, for some reason (James Spader) is forced to take command. The
ship picks up a distress call from a nearby planet and, on arrival,
picks up one survivor from an apparent accident in an abandoned mining
colony. One of the crew members (Angela Bassett) knows this passenger,
who is played by Peter Facinelli, and has some bad feelings about it --
and we all know what that means.
This intergalactic hitchhiker is carrying some mysterious cargo -- a
jellylike substance the purpose of which is unknown, though it seems to
bring some form of pleasure to whoever touches it. Another one of the
crew members experiences this first hand; after spending a few minutes
partially inside this glob of goo, he does some impressive handstand
pushups. Evidently, touching this enigmatic egg-shaped thingie makes
you younger and stronger. How? Why? The movie never bothers to explain.
Soon enough though, Spader and Bassett are running around the ship like
mad, being chased by the all-of-a-sudden-superhuman Facinelli. To be
honest, I don't even remember exactly why. I just remember that I
didn't care. Supernova's plot suggested some more or less interesting
ideas, such as the ball of goo being an intergalactic time bomb, but
they are all dropped before they have a chance to develop into anything
truly intriguing. In fact, everything is dropped just so the actors can
have some fun running around what looks like an elaborate set.
Well, the effects are good, though there's hardly a studio movie with
bad special effects these days so I'm not sure whether that's so
remarkable an accomplishment. The performances are hardly worth talking
about. I'm not even sure I can call what's here "performances," though
Angela Bassett sure is good at giving people the finger. James Spader
is not a bad actor, but he proves to be one of the blandest action
stars I've seen in a while, mostly because he isn't given a character
with a personality. The action scenes are just as bland, since they're
pretty much just rehashes of action elements that weren't particularly
entertaining the first time around. And since the action scenes are
everything to this movie, it's pretty much dead in the water.
And for the life of me, I can't figure out why it's called Supernova.

Written by William Malone and Daniel Chuba (story) and David Campbell Wilson
(screenplay)
Directed by Walter Hill (credited as Thomas Lee)
Rated R
If I were one of those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great
impact on the success or failure of certain films, I might say that I review
movies that don't look particularly good because I'm doing a service to my
readers by warning them against seeing it. If that were true, I could put a
banner at the top of my site that reads: "Shay Casey: Seeing Bad Movies So
You Don't Have To." But I know that's bunk-you're going to see whatever
movies you want to no matter what I say. So I have to tell the truth: every
once in a while I get a nasty, masochistic urge to see a bad movie. You know
the feeling, when you're sick of seeing all these damn Academy Award
contenders and you want to see something you can have a ball trashing
mercilessly. Sometimes I think that's why anyone goes to see Pauly Shore
movies, ever. Admit it: sometimes you like seeing bad movies. So do I.
Truth be told, "Supernova" wasn't quite as bad as I thought it might be.
Maybe I just felt sorry for the actors, or maybe I thought it could have
been decent if the studio hadn't started tinkering with the director's
(Walter Hill) final cut, causing him to want his name removed. Maybe I'm
becoming a softy. In any case, I didn't find "Supernova" as bad as the
advance buzz would have me believe. But it's still bad.
The film takes place aboard the medical space vessel "Nightingale." The crew
includes Captain A.J. Marley (Robert Forster), his new second officer Nick
Vanzant (James Spader), head medical officer Kaela Evers (Angela Bassett),
medical technicians Yerzy Penalosa (Lou Diamond Phillips) and Danika Lund
(Robin Tunney), and computer technician Benj Sotomejor (Wilson Cruz). There
are some attempts at "characterization," but all that means is that Nick has
a shady past involving a drug addiction, which puts Kaela on edge, Yerzy and
Danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissy-faces at each
other every five minutes, and Benj (apparently gay) is in love with the
computer (apparently female). Don't expect any more explanation, because you
won't get it. Anyway, the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in
space to which a failed mining operation had been sent. During the dimension
jump (I think that's what it's called, but don't hold me to it), the Captain
is killed and the man who sent the distress signal (Peter Facinelli) is
brought on board. He calls himself Troy Larson, making him the supposed son
of a man Kaela once had a relationship with. Then a bunch of really
predictable stuff starts happening.
Have you seen "Alien?" Have you seen "Event Horizon" (a lame movie in its
own right)? Good. Then you've seen "Supernova." Post-production cuts or not,
there is nothing original about this screenplay, and nothing unpredictable
either. After all, no one's going to think for a second that Troy won't turn
out to be a villain. But the bigger problem with "Supernova" is that it can'
t just stick to the simple plot it's afforded. Numerous re-writes (the
script may be credited to three people, but it's a gross underestimate) have
crammed this lean 90-minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that
all remain underdeveloped. Was there something about a limping robot shaped
like a fighter pilot? Did the ship's computer learn something about
humanity? What was that glowing lava lamp artifact Troy brought on board
with him? And just what does the film's title signify, if anything? As far
as I can tell, it refers to a very small plot detail that isn't developed,
just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements.
Character relationships in this film also make very little sense. For some
reason, every person in this film keeps having sex. We get an unusually
early sex scene between Phillips and Tunney within the first 10 minutes.
Bassett and Spader's characters start off hating each other. Fifteen minutes
and one bottle of pear brandy later, they're engaging in some hanky-panky.
When Troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship, of course both female
crew members will fall in love with him. Every single shift in character
interaction happens extremely suddenly, which is only one of the many
obvious clues to how much this film has been cut. The most prominent
example, however, may be the fact that when the film starts, there are no
opening credits! Furthermore, the end of the film looks like they took what
were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right
before the real end credits. Maybe that's why the film's title is mentioned
twice during the end credits, right between James Spader and Robert Forster.
Right after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you're
seeing (lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery), you might
notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a
scene, with little-to-no introduction to any of the characters or
situations. The rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle
stuff in the character changes (you know, where they explain things) and
just went from Point A to Point B. Point A: Danika is thoroughly enamored of
Yerzy and is ready to have his baby. Point B: Tunney is now shagging Troy
and Yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing. Doesn't make
sense.
Since I didn't understand anything about these characters' motivations, did
I care when Troy abruptly starts murdering them one-by-one (and he does,
knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes)? Not a whit. It's a shame,
because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to
do. They don't find it. Bassett and Spader say every line in the same
monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces. Sexual
tension? More like constipation. Maybe they're just embarrassed at having to
utter such howlers as "This thing was made by someone more powerful than God
and a whole lot less nice." Not that we ever find out who that is, mind you.
The climax of their relationship (taking place in a transport pod) is
probably the film's biggest forehead-slapper. As Troy, Peter Facinelli
inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected. He'
s awfully one-note, but it's not as if he's given any more notes to work
with. The rest of the cast does even less. Tunney stands around looking
cute, then scared. Phillips broods. Cruz flirts with the computer. Then they
all die and a star blows up or something, but I really wasn't paying much
attention by then.
"Supernova" is pretty awful, but I'm cutting it a little slack merely
because I expected less than what I got. That's it. If you expect it to be
good (for whatever reasons you may have), you'll probably hate it more than
I will. Even the special effects are fairly unimpressive, nothing you haven'
t seen before, and suffice to say the script isn't going to save the film.
Honestly, though, what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers
and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym? It
usually results in a bad movie, and that's what "Supernova" is.

Hmmmm, major directorial issues, no preview rendez-vous for the critics, and
a huge thumbs down from JoBlo contributor PackBacker, pronouncing it as an
early candidate for "worst of 2000"...youch! So is it any good? Well, we
will never know what original director Walter Hill's intention was, since he
asked his name to be altered to Thomas Lee for the final print. Apparently,
the film was taken from his hands, and mangled by many, including legendary
director Francis Ford Coppola and the studio.
PLOT:
An ambulance ship set in space is called in for an emergency request from
way out in the middle of nowhere. They bring aboard a mysterious man who
also happens to be carrying some extra-dimensional cargo with him. Is the
man an alien? Is the cargo dangerous? Does the movie suck? Find out below.
CRITIQUE:
Unoriginal mesh of previously seen and better science-fiction movies such as
ALIEN, THE THING and even crap like VIRUS and EVENT HORIZON, this film did
at least manage to keep me interested throughout its entire run. Yes, that's
right, I was never bored and I suppose that's a good thing, right? Add that
to a couple of trippy sequences, laughable sci-fi dialogue and a quick
cohesive package of less than an hour and a half, and God help me, but I
didn't think this film was as horrible as I originally anticipated. Don't
get me wrong, this is not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination.
The characters are stock and one-dimensional, the flickering lights, beeping
switches, smoke and hand-held camera are patent sci-fi schlock and rarely
take your mind off the fact that the movie doesn't have one shred of
originality to piss on, but I guess I wasn't expecting much from this film
to begin with. Slap a couple of beers in your system, and by golly, you may
even enjoy the darn thing!
So I guess the trick is to go into this thing with nil expectations, in
which case you might actually appreciate the hour and a half of relaxation
that your mind will experience. And it's definitely video-bait, with very
few special effects and even less superior effects to warrant a trip outside
the home. The cast is wasted on jargon dialogue and two-bit romances barely
crispy enough to light a candle, but I suppose that if you're just looking
to have fun with some buddies, or enjoy a film which doesn't pretend to be
anything more than a staple sci-fi flick with no message, than this baby
might be worth saving a seat just for you. So let's recap: never boring,
pretty repetitive, so-so effects, ho-hum characters, zero originality, quick
runtime tacked on to an anti-climactic ending. Sound interesting to you? If
so, go ahead and supernova your ass over to this movie, caught in the annual
spot reserved for early year sci-fi rehashes. If not, skip it, erase the
title from your mind, and pretend you never read any of this. It won't be
hard. I saw the movie a few hours ago, and I barely remember a thing.
