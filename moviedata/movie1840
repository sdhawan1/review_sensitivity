After seeing "Bulworth", I remarked to a friend that a movie like this, in
today's political climate, was probably inevitable.  At some point we were
almost guaranteed a satire about a machine politician who snaps and does a
Putney Swope on his constituents.  Well, we got it -- and it's to Warren
Beatty's credit that he managed to pull it off as well as he did.  It is
easily one of the best movies this country has produced in years.
Beatty stars (in a movie he directed, produced and wrote as well) as the
titular character, a California senator who has reached total burnout.  He
sits in his office playing back his own TV commercials, like the zombified
rock star in "Pink Floyd the Wall".  He can't bring himself to mouth the
same phoney glad-handling junk any more.  Worse, he's lost tons of money in
the stock market, and so has decided to set up a contract on his life and
have himself killed.
The threat of death for some people is liberating, however, and Bulworth
finds that he no longer feels pressured to tailor himself to his public. He
shows up at an inner-city church, and when asked by one of the members of
the congregation why he hasn't done anything for the black community, he
responds in the only sane way left to him: "Well, that's easy: it's because
you haven't contributed any money to my campaign."  The audience roars
derisively; Bulworth giggles.  For the first time in his life he feels like
he's done something right.
That's when the film cuts completely loose.  Bulworth winds up getting
tangled up with a crew of giggly [black] women, gets loaded in a rap club,
and shows up at his next public speech disheveled and unwashed. Rather than
hide or stall, he seizes the stage and delivers an impromptu rap song about
how the government does a better job of providing medical coverage than the
big corporations do, but we're propagandized into believing it's not true:
"Say the magic word: SOCIALISM!" he bellows into the mike.  He's transformed
into DJ Bulworth, bringing a whacked-out mixture of social commentary and
insider know-how into the public eye.
This is very funny, of course, but it's also shocking how confrontatory and
genuinely uncomfortable it is, too.  In a period where movies are doing just
about anything to get our attention and shock us, it's sort of refreshing to
see a movie that does this through social issues instead of bodily
functions.  "Bulworth" covers an amazing amount of ground for a two-hour
movie: there's material on inner-city blight and the way constitutents are
chosen and the politics of campaigning and TV and truth-as-a-commodity and
much more.
Maybe too much more.  The movie's biggest asset is also its biggest
liability: there's just too much material here to cover effectively in a
two-hour movie, and it's held together with a plot that is too obviously a
plot.  And there's an ending which feels unsatisfactory and hurried.  It's
not a perfect film, but on the other hand, what film that works like this,
in so risk-taking a fashion, could be?  "Bulworth" is not about its plot but
about its insights and discoveries, and in that sense is indispensible.
It's daring and invigorative.  And it also made me laugh louder and longer
than almost any other film in recent memory.

"Bulworth" is something of a mess. But it is a Good Mess. It  is the first
summer film that I saw on my return from the Cannes Film Festival --and I
feel pretty good about it. I wish it had been selected for Cannes instead
some other US movies. Had this been the case, I guess that "Bulworth"'s
strong, idiomatic hip-hop dialogue, its African-American nature, its
in-references, would have puzzled the public. Yet its liberalism and
reformism would have found a receptive audience among the French and other
nationals who are much more militant than the Americans.
For Warren Beatty it's a strong comeback after the insipid, flat fiasco of
1994's  "Love Affair," a re-remake of two earlier movies --the first one
excellent, the second good. In version 3, Beatty had co-written, produced
it and sort of starred, along with wife Annette Bening. In "Bulworth" he is
the movie by his presence, plus co-producing, co-scripting, as well as solo
directing -- the latter for the third time, following his "Reds" and "Dick
Tracy."
Beatty directs himself as incumbent California Senator Jay Bulworth, a
Democrat, whom we meet in the last three days of the 1996 primaries. In his
Washington office, surrounded by photographs of 1960s liberal icons JB
keeps clicking his remote control, watching on the monitor an endless
parade of his campaign footage that endlessly uses his inane slogan "We
stand at the doorstep of a new millennium." The man hasn't slept or eaten
in days. In a near-catatonic state of depression, he takes stock of his
sorry condition, his abuses of power and betrayals of a political past that
once was rife with post-New Deal, Kennedyite ideals. Like too many others,
he's sold his soul to the company store.
The opening sequences are brilliant, hard acts to follow. Additional deft
strokes show Jay's entourage, make us aware of his corruption. Promising a
lobbyist for the insurance industry his help in defeating a plan that would
provide coverage for the have-nots, Jay extracts a ten million dollar
freebie, a life insurance to be paid to his (unseen throughout the film)
daughter. With a sleazy middleman, Bulworth arranges for a contract -- on
his own life. A breakdown can't go any further. It may seem unbelievable
but it is fascinating.
Landing in California, acting oddly from alcohol and his breakdown,
Bulworth is whisked off to a black church of South Central Los Angeles,
where things get curiouser and curiouser for an audience who couldn't guess
in a million years that the Senator's decision to end it all has freed him
to --in 60s parlance -- "tell it like it is." And does he tell them!
Throwing away his speech, with  total honesty, he scolds (with some
affection) the African-Americans about their shortcomings then denounces
(with no affection) the white Establishment that keeps no promises and does
nothing for a minority that cannot contribute millions to politicians.
Panicked, his chief-of-staff (Oliver Platt) throws a fire alarm. All rush
out. Somehow Nina, a gorgeous young woman (Halle Berry) and her two perky
female friends get into Jay's stretch limo, along with the Senator's men
and a videographer from CNN. They all find their way to a Beverly Hills
reception by showbiz personalities whom the Senator shocks by continuing
his stream of criticisms and unpleasant verities. The next stop is an
all-black, all-night disco, with gang-like figures and much snorting of
white stuff. Jay carouses, dances non-stop with Nina, boozes, and,
surprise! discovers a new joie-de-vivre.
At dawn, this entourage moves to a fund-raiser at the Beverly Wilshire,
where the unkempt Jay in a wine-stained shirt, goes now on a veritable
rampage of denunciations. He stupefies the audience with a merciless
harangue, magically delivered in rhyming rap-style. It's unbelievable but
also powerful and funny. While, in spite of the abundance of the f and the
m-f words this is no genuine protest rap, it serves its purpose, is
entirely comprehensible to white ears, and adds to the many outrageously
comic elements of the movie. From now on, it will be the Senator's main
mode of communicating. His transformation gets increasingly weird, to the
point of his dressing like a homeboy. Valiantly, Beatty keeps up his
specialty, found in many of his films no matter what the role, that is, a
self-mocking goofiness through thick and thin, here even as, with his new
taste for life, Jay now frantically tries to rescind the contract on
himself.Complications and episodes pile up.
Beatty, always a card-carrying, liberal activist among the Hollywoodians,
but unlike most of them, semper fidelis, gives his all to his role in
"Bulworth." His heart is in the right place, his old pretty-boyishness  (in
spite of the tiniest eyes this side of Norma Shearer and Dianne Wiest) has
given way to his uncamouflaged 61 years. The real Beatty may have a high
I.Q. but most of his screen personae have looked dim to me. In "Bulworth"
this works in his favor, since I share with many the impression that too
many politicos are more canny than brainy.
Jay is in a state of divine madness. Almost infectious is his relish in
exposing the infinite ambitions and corrupting mega-powers of corporate
America and multi-national conglomerates that buy and sell  politicians.
His denunciations of the puppets in government are vibrant. Even though his
targets do not include everyone, viewers probably sense that the
accusations cover untold numbers of office-holders, from petty officials to
ward heelers (who are not healers) on up.
With the focus so persistently on Bulworth, the very able supporting cast
(meaning everyone else), hardly ever goes beyond sketchiness. In context
this would be no filmic sin, except that a surplus of directions taken and
characters shown, some key roles -- like Nina's-- remain hazy. There are
needless red herrings too. The finale is strictly from hunger.
Among the in-jokes popping up is writer Amiri Baraka ( ne LeRoi Jones)  as
a presumably homeless old fellow who, in indistinct ways, plays soothsayer,
chorus or cheerleader to  Bulworth. He could have been skipped. But the
contract-killer device is no gimmick, since it gives Jay his freedom of
thought and of speech. Coincidentally, the mysterious hired assassin and a
major change of mind were the engine of Vyacheslav Krishtofovich's fine
Ukrainian movie "A Friend of the Deceased" (1997), very recently released
in the U.S.
Beatty's decision to use literally and symbolically Black America as his
main leitmotif is a strong, clever focus, but here comes the major rub. In
his too-quick immersion into black culture, Jay shows us a very real
subculture that has life and soul (good), but also an under-culture (bad)
of drug-dealing, gun-toting, profanity-prone adults as well as kids.
Unwittingly and unconsciously -- I'm sure, -- and probably because the
scriptwriters got carried away and were unable to have a tighter structure
that would consider all the trees in the woods, Beatty and Pisker demean
the millions of neglected, minority Americans who, against the odds, try to
live decent lives.
If you haven't  guessed by now, "Bulworth" is a postmodern (whatever that
means), hip-hop variant of Frank Capra's "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" or
"Meet John Doe." Although basically as sentimental and unlikely as those
movies, its savage truths make of it a daring, fresh political work more
than a fantasy.
P.S. Some statistics. Beatty, in 37 years of movies, has been in some two
dozen films, an average of 0.64 per annum. In an earlier generation,
Gregory Peck, in 49 years, was in 59 movies, a rate of 0.83 per annum.
Earlier yet, in the keep-churning-them-out studio age, in 37 years (like
Beatty), Clark Gable made about 75 films, an annual rate of 2.02.

Watching 'Bulworth' feels like having somebody punch you in the face and
as you turn around to recover and regain your balance, there's somebody
waiting that throws a bucket of cold water where you've just been
punched.  In other words, the film is a double whammy of intended satire
but comes off more as a series of condescending failed scenes which do
nothing to advance the nature of the movie's characters and
caricatures.  Caricatures are usually the least interesting thing about
a film that centres on people because they never get developed beyond
the realm of their first scene(s), hence, their given name.  'Bulworth'
has more than its share of unnecessary players and the centre piece of
the movie's main personality is a man with a pretty unattractive
personality named Jay Billington Bulworth (Warren Beatty).
I understood completely where Beatty was trying to go with this film but
rather than churn out a political satire, Beatty has instead made a film
where Bulworth rambles about our unbalanced society without telling us
anything about how he intends to improve it.  That is often the true
nature of politicians and if the movie wants to do that, what exactly is
its point beyond anything we've seen before?  It doesn't take a genius
to do a simple turning of the tables and make a fibbing politician, who
doesn't believe in the things he's saying and turn him into a suicidal
and supposedly conscience stricken self redeemer who becomes suicidal
and says what's really on his mind.
The film opens with a rehearsed speech Billington intends to give where
the opening line is heard over and over and over again and is the usual
*blah*blah*blah* he will use in an upcoming campaign.  We soon begin to
see Bulworth's mental breakdown as he displays his suicidal tendencies
and takes out a large insurance policy on himself before hiring a
contract killer to knock himself off?!  I didn't believe it for a
second.  The idea is too simple to be believable and even if you accept
the premise, the movie's core issue hasn't even surfaced yet.
As Bulworth is speaking to a large audience of African-Americans in
South Central L.A., he makes some rather blunt comments that he believes
are true, putting aside the political line for an unexpected dose of
what many will accept as reality.  Next his comments turn to the Jewish
community and these two outbursts cause a media carnage where Bulworth
is asked to explain exactly what he meant by these two incidents.
Somewhere in the middle of all this, he begins saying what he really
feels is the trouble with American society.  His remarks make the U.S.A.
sound instead like the Corporate States of America, perhaps a good
theory and while reasonably admirable and truthful, his execution of
these ideas are awkward and sound more like the ramblings of a paranoid
fanatic.
During his outburst in South Central L.A., he meets Nina (Halle Berry),
a young woman from the community whom he fancies and he tries to
understand her world and express himself through it by a transformation
of image.  It's a world Bulworth doesn't understand because the words he
hears and the problems he sees, he repeats them when interviewed on
television and the execution this time isn't only awkward, its phony and
self indulgent on Beatty's part.
What's even more astonishing about this film is the way that Beatty
presents not only the other characters in the film, but his own.  The
other characters played by such wonderful actors as Jack Warden, Paul
Sorvino, Oliver Platt, Don Cheadle and Christine Baranski are never
given any real focus or development and when the fate of Beatty's
character is decided, you will NOT care.
Beatty is more concerned with presenting his story too quickly and as
you figure out that his film lacks depth and insight, you'll be amazed
at what little foundation is built around the the rest of the story.
Beatty directs and is the co-author of 'Bulworth' and for a man who has
been a part of classics like 'Bonnie and Clyde', 'Shampoo', ' Heaven Can
Wait' and his most ambitious film for which he won a Best Director
Oscar, 1981's 'Reds', Beatty has made an abysmal failure of a film the
has absolutely no after thought and is as stimulating as frozen silly
putty.

Director: Warren Beatty
Writers: Warren Beatty and Jeremy Pikser (story by Beatty)
Starring: Warren Beatty, Halle Berry, Oliver Platt, Don Cheadle, Paul
Sorvino, Jack Warden, Isaiah Washington, Christine Baranski, Laurie
Metcalf, Sean Astin, Richard Sarafin, Nora Dunn, Larry King, William
Baldwin, George Hamilton
We first meet California Senator Jay Bullington Bulworth on TV starring in
one of those television ads promoting politicians, showing them at home in
their family life, working hard at work, and making a powerful speech in
favor of himself directly to the audience.  He says stuff like "this is a
new milenium" and "I will work hard for you," just like everyone else. 
Then the camera cuts to Bulworth sitting in his office in the middle of the
night, watching these ads, and he's balling his eyes out.
Jay Bulworth has reached a point that we probably suspect all politicians
are at - where they know that what they're saying is total bullshit and
they're sick of it - and then gone over it.  In a suicidal, maniacally
depressed state, he hires a friend of a friend named Vinnie (Richard
Sarafin, the oh-so Italian mafia don from "Bound") to have him killed by
the end of the weekend, then heads out to his daily speeches and public
appearances.  Arriving at an all-Black church in South Central L.A., he
walks up to the podium, tosses away his speech, and figures "Hey, my life
is over, I'll say what I want," and does just that.  Afterwards, everyone's
in a state of appallment, as well as shock, and Bulworth turns to his chief
aide, Dennis (Oliver Platt) and says, "That was pretty good."
This is basically the premise "Bulworth," a fairy tale-like story all the
more surreal and shocking because it's about a politician who actually is
blunt about the way he feels, something that hasn't existed in at least the
past century.  It tells of a politician who wants to tell everything in a
non-watered-down context, who wants to actually research what he's working
for and help people, and who finds a new-found love for the career he chose
a long time ago.  Like I said, it's a big fairy tale.
There is more: Bulworth begins by making obnoxious and insulting
observations out loud to people (at one point, he goes to a party hosted by
Hollywood moguls and basically tells them that their films suck so why
should they be spending so much on them?), then actually digs down deep,
and begins to research what he's doing.  After meeting a couple women at
the South Central Church (including a woman who catches his eye - Nina,
played by the gorgeous Halle Berry), he begins to learn more about South
Central, most especially their culture (he finds he is, at heart, a rap
lover, like I bet we all are), and soon finds he can (sorta) rap and try to
use his bluntness to fix things that are wrong with the system, like
problems with affirmative action, and basically the way that South Central
is such a dead-end place (next stop: North Philly!).
As you probably could tell from the previews, as well as this review,
"Bulworth" is not a serious satire; it's a really scathing black comedy of
sorts, probably making this the funniest movie to come out this year
because it's so bluntly honest about everything, and it's willing to strip
everything down to the buff, which is, these days, a rare thing.  We get
all sorts of really sarcastic, politically incorrect jokes, like when he's
at the South Central church, he tells everyone "If you don't put down that
bucket of chicken wings and don't get behind a linebacker who stabs his
wife in the back, you'll never get rid of someone like me!"  We get to see
his staff frantically try to cover up for him, most espeically Oliver
Platt, who is, as always, a riot.  And we even get to see the sight of
Warren Beatty dressed in South Central rags, trying to rhyme every sentence
so that he sounds like Grandmaster Flash on anphetemines.  That alone is
worth the price of admission.
But most of all, we get another great film in a trio of really pissed-off
films about the way that politics have become such bullshit today (or have
always been such bullshit - I dunno).  After "Wag the Dog" and "Primary
Colors," "Bulworth" is a successful potential end to this sorta trilogy of
political cynicism, and particularly succesful because it doesn't carry the
same message as either of them did.  Instead of merely mocking the lies we
are told or saying that politics merely destroys people, "Bulworth" is just
out to say that all politics is bullshit and that if anyone actually came
out and told the truth, they'd be elected in a flash, regardless of what
their views are.
Warren Beatty, the director, co-writer, and star of "Bulworth" (and one of
my favorite actors, who's disappearance from film for the past couple years
has been dually noted by myself), has been a long-time liberal democrat,
and I almost wonder if this has been a film he's been planning to make all
his life, or a realization he had just now.  I'm saying this because
"Bulworth" comes off as being honest even about the terms "liberal" and
"conservative" (as well as "Republican" and "Democrat"), saying that not
even these exist in today's politics.  I imagine he was watching Clinton
and (Bush/Dole/Perot - you pick) debate, and he realized that Bill, the big
old liberal democrat up there, was saying anything to get elected, crossing
over any kind of borders between the two forms of political thought (I'm
leaving out moderacy here, aren't I?).  To Beatty, there doesn't seem to be
political thought anymore, just people who will say anything to get
elected.
As angry as Beatty's message is, he has a charming way of not letting this
overpower his film, and actually being able to let this hostility work with
the story and message.  It's one thing to be angry, and it's another thing
to be in control of your anger, and it's obvious that "Bulworth" belongs in
the latter.  But as brilliant and amazing as the message of "Bulworth" is,
the story does have a few small kinks.  For one, the romance between
Bulworth and Nina doesn't totally work, but does have a certain sweetness
to it that makes it hard to resist.  And the assasination subplot,
involving Bulworth clumsily trying to avoid his alleged assassin, doesn't
really work well with anything else...until the end (funny how suicidal
tendenices make you a better person in the long run, eh?).  But these are
so minor that they barely affect the film in the overall sense.
Oh, and look for an amazing cast of some great supporting roles - including
a southern Paul Sorvino (a chameleon of regional dialects if I ever heard
one), Jack Warden, Don Cheadle (who's becoming one of the most versatile
actors in Hollywood - shy, gentle, alienated porn star in "Boogie Nights"
to angry-as-hell drug dealer here...both totally convincing performances),
and Christina Baranski as his dysfunctional wife (wait till you see who
she's boning...), as well as a slew of cameos (Sean Astin...Nora
Dunn...Larry King NOT appearing on his talk show...) - all of these people
just add to the overall fun of the film.
It's almost sad to say it's cinematically the weakest of the three
political movies to come out in awhile, because deep down, it has the best
political message.  But that doesn't really mean that "Bulworth" is a
failure of any kind story-wise.  For its entire time, it's a hilarious,
entertaining-as-hell romp that has an intriguing story to tell, and one
helluva message to relay.  On second thought, I think that Beatty has
always felt like this...it just took Clinton to make him realize it.

        I didn't care what this movie was about; as soon as I heard it 
featured 61-year-old Warren Beatty rapping, I knew I had to see it. 
Little did I know BULWORTH would be the best political satire of the 
decade and a key moment in Beatty's career. Yes, it's even better than 
DICK TRACY (yes, that's sarcasm) and it nails on the head some of 
America's biggest problems, besides the fact that it can produce a 
61-year-old white rapper. No one escapes Beatty's so-liberal-it's-
socialist attack, not the Democrats or Republicans, not the insurance 
companies or the media and not the minorities for which Beatty tries 
to speak.
        Beatty plays Jay Bulworth, a U.S. senator facing reelection. 
He takes payoffs and contributions from all the right people and 
ignores all the wrong ones, living the perfect politician's lie with his 
wife (Christine Baranski) and teenage daughter. Watching his latest 
shiny TV ads, he finally gets sick of it all and arranges to have himself 
killed, making sure to bargain with an insurance lobbyist to take out a 
$10 million policy on himself. Then he writes a 130-page mission 
statement and gets fired from the agency, and only Cuba Gooding Jr. 
will stay with him. I may have some of the plot confused at this point, 
but bear with me.
        At the next morning's campaign stop at a black church in Los 
Angeles, Bulworth scraps the scripted speech to field questions from 
the audience. Among other things, he tells them the Democratic party 
isn't loyal to black voters because they have no financial clout and that 
politicians just tell them what they want to hear. Bulworth's top 
advisor (Oliver Platt) pulls the fire alarm before he can stick any more 
feet in his mouth, and they're off to the next stop, where Bulworth 
further insults a group of Jewish filmmakers. It's an interesting 
campaign strategy, although not one that's worked for Buchanan or 
David Duke.
        It's in fleeing from the angry moguls that he acquires his new 
posse, a trio of African-American ladies spearheaded by Nina (Halle 
Berry). Bulworth spends that night hanging at an inner-city nightclub 
where he smokes blunts, dances until dawn, starts rapping casual 
conversations and eventually takes his turn at the twin turntables. It all 
prepares him for the fundraiser breakfast the next morning, where he 
once again scraps his scheduled speech, this time rapping out a new 
one that attacks politics and the power structure.
        The interesting thing is, after Platt and the other campaign 
people freak out, the public laps it all up like a contented kitty cat. 
And Bulworth doesn't want to die anymore, so he has to try to get the 
hit called off. This subplot is more convention than innovation, and 
distracts from the movie's real message. Fortunately, there's not much 
screentime devoted to the assassination plot; instead we see Bulworth 
in Nina's neighborhood, dealing with her large family and the local 
druglord (Don Cheadle, going from BOOGIE NIGHTS porn star to 
drug dealing gangsta).
        BULWORTH has a lot of hilarious moments, but there's a 
message, and it's not one a lot of people want to hear because it puts 
America in a pretty sad state of affairs. I saw this with about six other 
white people in a mid-Missouri outlet mall, and most of them didn't 
like it. As they were exiting and complaining, the theater manager 
actually apologized for the movie for making them think about more 
than the usual action-packed thrills and romance. Yet he shows 
GODZILLA with a clean conscience. More than anything, that sums up 
what is wrong with our country right now.

BULWORTH (M).  
(Twentieth Century Fox)
Director: Warren Beatty
Stars: Warren Beatty, Halle Berry, Oliver Platt, Don Cheadle, Joshua
Malina, Jack Warden, Paul Sorvino, Christine Baranski, Richard
Sarafian, Isaiah Washington, Sean Astin, Laurie Metcalf, Amiri Baraka,
Wendell Pierce, Michele Morgan, Ariyan Johnson, Larry King, George
Hamilton (uncredited cameo)
Running time: 108 minutes.
        Bulworth is a daring film from Warren Beatty, a film maker
whose politics have always been left of centre and whose long career
has been driven by his very personal choice of projects.  In this
cynical and scathing political satire Beatty tackles many of the more
obvious problems of the American democratic process, and the social
and economic divisions caused by race and class.  Beatty, who is
credited as writer, producer and director, takes aim at a number of
targets and hits a few raw nerves along the way.  Beatty could also be
accused of biting the hand that feeds him, as he attacks the major
motion picture studios, the corporations that buy political favours,
and the whole political process itself.
In the week before the Senate elections, Democrat Jay
Bulington Bulworth (Beatty) has become disillusioned by the hypocrisy,
the lies and the machinations of American politics and wants out.  He
takes out a $10 million life insurance policy and then hires a hit man
to assassinate him.  Freed of any sense of obligation, Bulworth then
feels able to speak his mind during the campaign.  Rather than deliver
the same tired old speeches, he begins to tell the truth, informing
the voters of how little they actually mean to the politicians.
Suddenly, Bulworth becomes popular and reinvents himself as that
rarity - an honest, straight talking politician.
In the wave of euphoria following his sensational admissions,
Bulworth has second thoughts about his earlier decision, but finds
himself unable to call off the hit.  Bulworth also finds romance with
the fiery, beautiful and intelligent Nina (Halle Berry, from Executive
Decision, etc), who hails from LA's black ghettos and the opposite end
of the political spectrum.  However, her ideas and opinions open his
eyes to a lot that is wrong with his country and the government.
Another unexpected source of inspiration is found in L D (Don Cheadle,
from Devil In A Blue Dress, etc), a drug lord.
Bulworth follows on from those other sharp political satires
from last year, the timely Wag The Dog and Primary Colors.  However,
Bulworth is nowhere near as clever, biting or as credible as those two
films, and at times is something of an undisciplined mess.  As
co-writers, Beatty and long time collaborator Jeremy Pikser (Reds,
etc) seem to have bitten off more than they can chew in this ambitious
script.  There are a couple of good ideas here, but they seem to get
lost in some unnecessary over plotting.  The film ultimately lacks a
strong central focus.  And those scenes where Bulworth, an angry old
man, proceeds to rail against corruption and apathy through rap songs
don't quite convince.  For once, Beatty is playing closer to his age,
a haggard, weary and tired 60 something, and he seems to be enjoying
the experience.  Oliver Platt gives a wonderfully manic performance as
Murphy, Bulworth's increasingly frustrated aide who attempts damage
control as he tries to keep his charge on the straight and narrow.  A
number of celebrity cameos, from the ubiquitous Larry King through to
George Hamilton, add to the flavour of the film.
Despite its structural flaws though, Bulworth looks great,
thanks to Vittorio Storaro's superb cinematography and Dean
Tavoularis' production design.

     Hollywood hates taking risks.  The studios like remaking old
movies with proven storylines, and if one studio gets a new idea, like
killer volcanoes or attacking comets, then other studios want to ride
on their coattails by making a similar movie but with different stars.
     You can accuse Warren Beatty, star, director, co-writer and
co-producer of BULWORTH of many shortcomings, but willingness to take
risks isn't one of them.  (Scheduling the movie to open the same week
as the world's most hyped big lizard is certainly the biggest financial
risk.)  His political version of LIAR LIAR uses a comedic setting to
say all of those things you're not supposed to say, even in the movies.
Full of racial insults and humor, the movie is astonishingly frank,
funny, outrageous and obnoxious.  And sometimes all in the same line of
dialog.
     It's the 1996 primary season, and the presidential candidates from
the major parties are singularly uninspiring.  In this mundane campaign
season, Democratic Senator Jay Billington Bulworth (Beatty) is in the
heat of another battle to be his party's nominee again for senator from
the great state of California.
     As the story opens, the senator listens to a tape of his new
thirty-second ads and weeps.  (One of the reporters describes his new
campaign strategy as "an old liberal trying to pour himself into a new
conservative bottle.")  The senator hasn't eaten or slept in days.
Beatty, in one of the better performances of his career, looks
completed wasted.  His face is white and puffy and his eyes look
exhausted.  If ever a man looked like his brain had just snapped, it is
he.
     After arranging for free, multi-million dollar insurance policies
for his children from one of the insurance companies that has been
bankrolling him, he contracts to have himself assassinated when his
plane lands in LA.  He no longer believes in his own platform, so he
wants to end it all.
     The film jumps from tragedy to satire when he isn't murdered on
schedule.  Although trailed everywhere by a hit man in dark glasses, he
keeps getting an unasked for extension of his life.  The ultimate lame
duck, he begins to tell the truth to everyone.  Scrapping his prepared
speeches, he rails against the entertainment industry's poor products,
the Jewish financial influence and his own big money backers.
     When he goes to a black church, they ask him why their community
was never rebuilt after the riots.  His simple answer is that all the
politicians did was promise to help, which got the politicians good
media coverage.  After that, they ignored the ghetto since they knew
the rest of the country would forget the promises.  Besides he points
out, they are too poor to contribute to his campaign so he doesn't care
what they want.  Finally, he points out that they have to put up with
whatever the Democrats decide to give them.  "What are you going to do,
join the Republicans?" he asks rhetorically.  "You're stuck with us,"
he concludes, almost gleefully.
     And if that isn't enough, Senator Bulworth really flips out.  The
movie almost turns into a musical as the senator begins to sing most of
his lines with a rap rhythm.  Along the way he picks up some poor,
young black women, including a cute young one named Nina (Halle Berry),
whom he wants to make his new friend and lover.
     During this infamous day, CSPAN is covering him for one of those
"day in the life of" series.  The people in the CSPAN control van are
nonplussed at his performance.  "Would he be eligible for an Emmy or a
Peabody?" one of them muses.
     Oliver Platt, from DANGEROUS BEAUTY, is great as Murphy, the
senator's beleaguered chief of staff.  Ready to meet any challenge with
a spin or an appropriate quick reaction - he hits the fire alarm in the
black church when the senator goes off the deep end - he eventually
snaps like his boss.  Snorting too much coke, he decides to try to turn
the senator's absurd behavior into an asset.  Remember this is politics
and the best spinmeisters can make any disgusting trait seem at least
forgivable and perhaps even laudable.
     As much as you may want to admire a film this daring and
incredibly funny, the ragged script contains whole sections that go
nowhere.  A typical one of these has Nina delivering a political
dialectic that sounds like a paragraph out of a graduate political
science textbook on Marxist economic theory.  These parts grind the
comedy to a halt.
     The senator, looking like he's tripping on LSD, has a simple,
radical solution for the country.  Everyone should immediately starting
having sex with everyone else until we are all the same color.  That he
decides is the solution to the country's racial and political
difficulties.
     BULWORTH runs 1:47.  It is rated R for drug usage, profanity, and
a little violence and would be fine for older teenagers.

Brash and rude, yet refreshingly funny, "Bulworth", is an usual film
about an unusual politician who decides to do something drastic about
his tumultuous career as an incumbent Senator.  With the election just
about a week away, Jay Bulworth (Warren Beatty) grows noticeably weary
of his life and his career.  Big money from special interest groups have
long guided his career towards an undesirable destination, far from the
original ideals that put this man in public office.   Bulworth promotes
family values in his campaign commercials, but his wife is having an
affair while his daughter shows no interest in his political career.
Politics have become a fiasco.  On top of that, he has lost his fortune
in a risky investment.  As his zest for life and politics fades, he
stops sleeping and eating.  He is on the verge of a nervous breakdown,
and takes out a contract on his own life. 
Knowing that he has only a limited time to live, he embarks on the last
leg of his campaign.  With a renewed sense of freedom, he dispatches
with his old, dry speeches and begins to tell it like it is, off the
cuff and in your face.  At a black church, he shocks the audience by
telling them that no one cares about their plight because they don't
contribute to his campaign.  At a private party of movie-making
contributors, he tells them that their products are 'crap'.  His
behavior causes his aide, Dennis Murphy (Oliver Platt), to go ballistic
as he tries to apply spin control to this volatile situation.  Platt
makes a very funny sidekick as all of his attempts to guide the Senator
back to normalcy are ignored.  
Meanwhile, the Senator's raw stance has attracted a group of black
females, including Nina (Halle Berry), a smart girl from the 'hood' who
is very versed in the urban plight.  She brings him into South Central
where he gets a first hand look at those that need the most help from
city officials but are frequently overlooked in favor of other groups
that line the politicians' pockets with money.  In this 'hood', he is
approached by crack-selling 10-year olds and is introduced to their
boss, played by Don Cheadle.  He gives a nice performance explaining how
the ignorance of the outside world has created an illegal yet viable
economy within this community.  
Bulworth is a smart Senator and knows that the only way to ignite
progress is to create a stronger core and to let the positive effects
trickle outwards.  In one of the best scenes, he is interviewed on
television and begins to vent his frustrations through rapping.  Wearing
a ski cap, sunglasses, and hip-hop baggy shorts, he angrily states that
the real obscenity is not his cursing or his recent raw behavior.  The
real obscenity is the shabby political system that's currently in place
which fails to protect and pull along those that rightfully need the
help.  His observations are insightful, and the story is the most funny
when he shows his irreverence towards those that support him as he
becomes the model of political incorrectness.  Edgy and smart, the film
hits the ground running and doesn't stop its manic pace until the very
end.  Beatty has given himself a role that he can bite into.  It is a
sharp satire on the state of American politics, and we can feel its bite
as well.

I can remember my teenage movie-going and the stars that shone the 
brightest.  Clint Eastwood could always be counted on for a good two 
hours.  Jack Nicholson won Best Actor for 1975 as Randal Patrick 
McMurphy in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," a film that aroused my 
young hate of injustice.  Warren Beatty (along with Julie Christie) was 
cool in "Heaven Can Wait."
The fact that all of these professionals are not only still working, in 
late-middle-age, but winning awards and nominations (Eastwood's Oscar 
for "Unforgiven," Nicholson's for "As Good As It Gets," Christie's nod 
for "Afterglow," Beatty's statuette for "Bugsy") says a lot.
Mostly it tells of the importance of social issues in movies.  Beatty 
especially has been taking jabs at human foibles for a long time.  I 
wasn't a teen any longer when "Reds" was released;  I was an English 
major who appreciated the rendering of journalist Jack Reed (and the 
featuring of Eugene O'Neill!), and who admired, with heady idealism, the 
importance of historical drama.
In "Bulworth," Beatty's attempts at satire are broad.  His targets, his 
methods, his humor  all are as broad as the mouth of the caricature of 
Beatty used to advertise the film.
Jay Billington Bulworth, Democratic senator from California, is a cliché 
of a politician.  Estranged wife.  Businessmen buying his interests.  At 
film's start we see him locked in his office, depression bearing down 
hard on him, surrounded by photographs from his career (one with Beatty 
from his "Shampoo" days is superimposed in a shot with Bobby Kennedy).  
What Bulworth does to emerge from the jaded funk is even more cliched  
he commissions a hit on himself.  
The bigger chunks of the film are more original, though.  Of course the 
self-ordered murder motif surfaces throughout, but Beatty's handling of 
the falling and rising of Jay Bulworth makes for superior satire.
Beatty supposedly had full creative control  no studio honchos lurking 
on the set.  This advantage seems to have made all the difference.  Not 
many groups escape Bulworth's desperate, liberated tongue.  Rushing 
through Los Angeles on a bid for re-election, he alienates 
African-Americans, Jews, the entire insurance industry.  But it's 
refreshing, and as one might guess, his candor wins him votes.
Venturing into the world of three young African American women, Bulworth 
risks all respectability.  Here Beatty succeeds:  he has Bulworth go 
back to his political boyhood tricks, reading people's backgrounds and 
delivering on their wishes.  Bulworth's knack for picking up on black 
slang and, Zelig-like, using it for his own survival, serves as one of 
the film's funnier running jokes.  It was also chancy for Beatty to 
explore the underworld of rap, once again assuming the language and even 
the dress of a "homie."  The result is a brilliant rendition of the 
contrasts of Americans who are black and white.
Halle Berry turns in a solid performance as Nina, one of the women the 
couldn't-care-less senator invites into his stretch limo.  Berry almost 
underplays her character, a nice counterpoint to some of the 
conventional histrionics portrayed by other African American actresses.  
I wonder if Beatty will garner more controversy for his interracial 
relationship in the film, or for his winning a much younger woman.  
(Didn't Nicholson raise hackles when he won Helen Hunt in "As Good"?)
As Bulworth's chief of staff, Dennis Murphy (Oliver Platt) provides a 
good foil.  Not in the evil sense, but in the politically advisable one.  
He is appalled when Bulworth self-destructs;  yet he rallies and 
compensates hilariously.  Platt delivers a biting send-up of 
behind-the-scenes hyposcrisy when, railing against his boss's 
tendencies, he snorts cocaine with another toady.
Can an actor direct the subtleties of his own performance as well as he 
can the performances of others?  Mostly, Beatty's instincts take over 
and enable him to create a convincing character.  Occasionally, however, 
Bulworth seems too silent, his eyes hooded in confusion.  Granted, the 
man has neither eaten nor slept in three days, and he throws back a 
large dose of jetliner liquor;  but even at his physical worst, Bulworth 
should be played as exhausted, not empty-headed.
Lately Americans have been treated to "Wag the Dog" and "Primary 
Colors," films as well-made and funny as "Being There," which I saw with 
my dad when I was in high school.  Bulworth reminds us how important it 
is to hate injustice and inequality, as well as to embrace tolerance.  
In short, it reminds us of the important role of satire.

     You know, I've seen NETWORK before, and it's a much better film.
     BULWORTH is, in the kindest of words, an "homage" to that picture, and
at least it has an excellent role model.  Simply take the story about a TV
newsman who goes nuts, stirs up controversy, and fatally angers the
establishment and change it to a US Senator who does the same thing, and
you've got BULWORTH.
     Warren Beatty's title role performance is the only reason BULWORTH has
anything going for it at all.  Much like Tom Cruise in JERRY MAGUIRE, Beatty
takes a difficult character and makes it his own, and while Beatty as a
foul-mouthed politician is not exactly playing against type, it's still his
very aggressive performance that carries the picture.
     Everything else, from the dismal supporting cast (Halle Berry has never
looked so lost) to the throw-away one-liners (you've seen all the best over
and over again on the trailers) is cut-and-pasted from NETWORK or clearly
dredged from some late night rewrite session.
     Still, Beatty's in fine form, and his outrageous wackiness takes the
film halfway to where it could have been.  (And geez, he directed, produced,
wrote, and starred in the film... maybe someone was a little too busy?)  But
overall, the missed opportunities, the overtly silly anti-PC message backed
up by nothing, and the all-too-forseeable ending make BULWORTH little more
than a fable that we already knew: That anyone involved with politics is
totally insane.

More than once the title of this movie is misspelled as Bullworth.  Now,
there has to be a reason that people think it's Bull!  The movie itself
certainly isn't.  It's right on!  I guess it's because it has to do with
politics and that's what most of us have come to associate with
politics....Bull!
Warren Beatty has written, produced and directed another unusual film.  It
begins with  Beatty as  J.Billington Bulworth,  running for re-election 
and showing signs of being a man on the edge.   He's had enough!  He
doesn't want to go on.   So, he makes a deal with an insurance company
executive [Paul Sorvino] to block a bill that is detrimental to Sorvino's
company.  In exchange, he will insure Bulworth's life for $10 million
dollars, payable to his daughter, not his wife.  Why, you wonder?
Next, Bulworth makes arrangements, through his friend, Jack Warden,  for a
"hit" to be made, on himself.   He is not to know the identity of the
assassin.
Once everything is set, he goes to a church in the ghetto to deliver that
dull speech that we heard repeated over and over at the film's beginning. 
Suddenly he seems to realize that  he has nothing to lose so he says
exactly what's on his mind.   This starts the chain of events that make up
the plot.  Unlike Jim Carrey in "Liar, Liar", Bulworth doesn't have to
tell the truth.  He simply says whatever comes to mind, and as time
passes, he says it in rap!
His change of behavior [and wardrobe] affects many lives.  His campaign
manager begins to change before our eyes.  Halle Berry's character is the
one that disappoints us.  She has too many sides to her personality.  I
couldn't believe her actions.  Of course, she had to be there for the love
interest.  Hey, when you're going for way out, why not put a 26 year old
black female opposite a 60 year old male? 
What do we think about Bulworth's interest in Halle?  His wife, portrayed
by Christine Baranski,  is shown as a shallow, class-conscious female who
is having an affair.    Of course that means that we should approve his
desire for Halle.  Christine is perfect for the part, but she's wasted in
the film.  I would have liked to have seen more of her and her reactions
to Bulworth's antics.
This is not a film that is going to go down in film history.  It doesn't
have the oomph of "Wag The Dog", although it wants to be.   I did find
that the mixed ethnic audience viewing the screening all seemed to laugh
at the same places.  Maybe films like this are bringing us closer together.

     I'd like to say that BULWORTH is the best political satire in 
years, but the truth is that is has tough competition from Barry 
Levinson's corrosive WAG THE DOG in that department.  Both films succeed 
admirably, but, although each takes aim at the sorry state of current-
day politics, they have slightly different agendas and approaches.  WAG 
THE DOG dissects the showmanship aspect of Washington, while 
simultaneously firing a few shots at Hollywood.  BULWORTH, on the other 
hand, is a full-frontal assault on the shallowness of the political 
campaign process.  It has the audacity that PRIMARY COLORS should have 
displayed, but was afraid to.  BULWORTH is willing to openly offend to 
get its point across.  That's something that PRIMARY COLORS was nervous 
about doing.
     In one sense, the film, put out by Warren Beatty with little 
concern for whose toes might get stepped on, can be summed up as an 
attack on the growing conservatism of the Democratic party, which is 
becoming increasingly more difficult to distinguish from its Republican 
rival.  BULWORTH is unrepentantly cynical in its view that all 
politicians are in the back pockets of big business and that every 
elected official, whether Democrat or Republican, is a member of an 
exclusive club.  Hypocrisy, self-interest, and greed are the three 
forces that drive every campaign, and Senator Jay Billington Bulworth 
(Beatty) has had enough.
     It's mid-March 1996, and Bulworth, an incumbent Senator from 
California, is running for re-election.  However, like the Michael 
Douglas character in FALLING DOWN, he has reached the breaking point.  
After taking out a $10 million life insurance policy with his 17-year 
old daughter as the sole beneficiary, he puts out a contract on his own 
life, then goes on the warpath against special interest groups.  
Discarding a prepared speech about the country standing "on the doorstep 
of a new millennium," he tells an African-American audience that the 
government doesn't care about them because they don't contribute enough 
money to re-election campaigns.  Later, at a black tie dinner attended 
by Hollywood types, he launches into a tirade about the poor quality of 
movies.  To a mostly-Jewish crowd, he declares, "My guys are not stupid.  
They always put the big Jews on my schedule."  Suddenly, Bulworth's 
"tell it like it is" philosophy is a national sensation, attracting the 
attention of millions, including a young black woman named Nina (Halle 
Berry), who is determined to show the Senator what life is like for 
those who live in South Central L.A.  Right in the middle of everything, 
Bulworth suddenly decides that he wants to live, but learns that calling 
off a hit isn't as easy as setting one up.
     BULWORTH's only real weakness (and it's more in the nature of a 
minor inconvenience than a significant flaw) is the backstory, which, 
with its disguised hit men, car chases, and bungled assassination 
attempts, takes up a little too much time.  The political satire, on the 
other hand, is brilliant.  Not only is it honed to a viciously sharp 
edge, but it's frequently hilarious.  Beatty manages to lampoon 
controversial issues, like kids selling drugs for dealers because 
they're too young to go to prison, while simultaneously making serious 
points.  In addition to the political material, there are other targets, 
including the easy marks of tabloid reporters and TV news programs.  
There's also a funny bit involving George Hamilton.
     Beatty has assembled a solid, diverse cast.  As the title figure, 
the co-writer/director sets himself up as a sitting duck.  Beatty is 
tremendous in this role, even going so far as to poke fun at how his 
increasing age has affected his legendary sex appeal.  He takes Bulworth 
from business suits to sweatpants and sunglasses, and transforms his 
campaign speeches into angry rap songs, all without missing a beat.  
Bulworth may not always be a three-dimensional character, but he's 
consistently fun and completely unpredictable.  The supporting players 
include Oliver Platt as Bulworth's campaign manager, Paul Sorvino as the 
head of an insurance corporation that wants Bulworth to stall a bill in 
committee, Don Cheadle as a drug dealer, and black playwright Amiri 
Baraka as a mysterious homeless man.  
     BULWORTH is an angry movie, but Beatty is savvy enough to recognize 
that people respond better to comedies than serious "issue films," so he 
has camouflaged his message beneath the surface of this original, 
incisive satire.  Like WAG THE DOG and PRIMARY COLORS, BULWORTH may not 
have widespread mainstream appeal, but anyone with an interest in 
American politics should see this movie, not only because it promises to 
tickle the funny bone, but because so many of its shots hit the bulls-
eye.  It's worth noting that BULWORTH occasionally reminded me of 
NETWORK, Sidney Lumet's 1976 shredding of the TV news industry, both in 
terms of plot points and spirit.  Each movie has a take-no-prisoners 
attitude, and in today's climate of suffocating political correctness, 
that's a welcome trait.

    -------------------------------------------------------------
     "Yo." - U.S. Senator Jay Billington Bulworth
   That, in a word, sums up the appeal of Warren Beatty's project
   BULWORTH, essentially a one-gag premise stretched kicking and
   screaming to feature-length.  While the film's scathing concept is
   inspired and often wickedly funny, it's swamped by familiar
   extraneous material which subverts the comedy, and a sociopolitical
   message too jarringly self-conscious to mesh with the film's other
   elements.
   It's the eve of the 1996 California primaries, and we're at the
   "doorstep to a new millennium".  Incumbent Democratic Senator
   Bulworth (Mr. Beatty) is despondent -- his life is in a shambles, he
   hasn't eaten or slept in three days, and he's sick of spewing out the
   same meaningless deliberately-worded rhetoric -- so sick, in fact,
   that he's ready to end it all.  After ordering a hit on himself, he's
   obligingly trotted around Los Angeles by his handlers, led by
   media-savvy campaign manager Dennis Murphy (Oliver Platt), for a
   final round of campaigning.  Liberated by his impending mortality,
   Bulworth's free to throw caution to the wind, and he uncorks a
   barrage of decidedly politically-incorrect platitudes at his various
   stops, stunning and outraging his audiences and launching Murphy into
   a state of panicked spin control.  Ultimately transforming himself
   into a rapping homeboy of a senatorial candidate, complete with
   hip-hop duds, Bulworth also undergoes a political reawakening, and
   his rhyming, disarmingly blunt liberal tirades begin to strike a
   chord with the weary, seen-it-all populace.  Bulworth is reborn --
   but will he survive long enough to enjoy it?
   BULWORTH is at its best when it's at its most irreverent, with the
   newly-metamorphosized title character cheekily blurting observations,
   or strutting through the darkened streets of South Central backed by
   Cypress Hill on the soundtrack.  There's discernable glee when the
   senator is given an impromptu crash course on hip-hop culture during
   an all-night party, and it's often great fun to take in a wildly
   animated Bulworth incongruously bursting out into rap, but the gag
   begins to lose its bite after constant repetition -- how many times
   can we cut to the faces of scandalized spectators before the humour
   dissipates?  It's only through Mr. Beatty's engaging performance that
   this aspect of the film doesn't wear out its welcome.
   We've got the makings of a fine political farce here, but the film's
   raison d'etre is its underlying impassioned rant against the status
   quo political system, and here's where BULWORTH loses its footing.
   Mr. Beatty's a famously avowed liberal, and his convictions are
   clearly heartfelt, but his film skewers each of its meaty targets --
   from the impact of media manipulation to the role of politician as
   industry puppet to the touchy race issue in America -- in a manner
   that's not only lacking in eruditeness, but also rather simplistic
   and obvious.  The film allows its characters so much screentime to
   wax eloquently on the state of inner city life that it becomes
   painfully sermonic.  Corrupt officials, spin doctors, poll-watching,
   harassment of black youth by white cops: it's all been addressed in
   more sophisticated and thought-provoking fashion elsewhere.
   If the film spins its wheels with its sociopolitical commentary, it's
   with the hitman subplot where it swerves and crashes.  Distracting at
   best and aggravating at worst, this thread begins as a series of
   merely intrusive scenes involving the senator, associate Eddie Davers
   (Jack Warden), and faithful hit go-between Vinnie (Richard Sarafian),
   and quickly degenerates into mindless, annoying chase sequences, with
   Bulworth diving into shrubbery or burning rubber alongside mysterious
   new admirer Nina (Halle Berry) to evade a menacingly omnipresent
   suspected assassin.  Best left on the cutting room floor, this aspect
   of the film is a drain, failing to add any comic or dramatic
   interest, and comes off as a weak excuse to include some action in an
   already-kinetic movie.
   When I first saw the teasers for BULWORTH several months ago, my
   first though was that of cynical amazement that a film which
   superficially resembled AS GOOD AS IT GETS -- loud-talking
   protagonist cheerfully spewing racial jibes for comic effect -- could
   make it to market so quickly.  In fact, this is a film whose
   gestation period has been a long one; Mr. Beatty, who wears multiple
   hats on the project (star, director, producer, co-writer), took great
   deliberations in his pitch to Fox (only the barest plot outline was
   given, with all of the political and racial angles excised), and
   leveraged monies owed from DICK TRACY in order to assume total
   control.  This is clearly a personal project for Mr. Beatty, and he
   throws himself into the film with utter abandon -- rarely does an
   actor seem to be as filled with enthusiasm as he does here.
   Consistently amusing throughout, there's an extra bounce in his step,
   a delightful grin on his face that's infectious.  Mr. Beatty's a
   wonderfully awful rapper, and it's disarmingly funny to watch a
   sexagenarian employing street hand gestures and gleefully rhyming his
   way through a televised debate.  Taking a sizable risk, he pulls it
   off with flying colours -- Mr. Beatty's performance is by far the
   strongest aspect of BULWORTH.
   The remainder of the cast is more hit-and-miss.  Ms. Berry, a
   luminous onscreen presence, is nonetheless rather uninspiring as
   Bulworth's new devotee, playing Nina with such fierce remoteness that
   not only is she sufficiently ambiguous, she's also uncompelling; by
   the time the gloves are off in the third act, one can scarcely raise
   an eyebrow.  Meanwhile, Mr. Platt's a wonderful character actor and
   does what he can with his frazzled Murphy character, but he's given
   only a few notes from which to riff as the aggravated aide.
   Mr. Beatty has spent much of his life deeply involved in American
   politics, working alongside the likes of Robert Kennedy, George
   McGovern and Gary Hart, and with BULWORTH comes his opportunity to
   express some of his reflections and concerns on the direction the
   system is heading.  The elements are present for a spectacularly good
   political lampoon, but ultimately the film is most memorable not for
   the message it conveys, but the sight of the iconic actor swaggering
   around, microphone in hand, chanting lines like "Billions to Mexico
   and never have to fear / Coz taxpayers, taxpayers take it in the rear
   / Yeah yeah yeah".

Bulworth exciting but what does it mean?
Senator Bulworth (Warren Beatty) is a man facing his own demons. Coming from
an idealistic liberal beginning, he's now in bed with lobbyists and has sold
out everything he believed in. In the middle of a re-election campaign he's a
man with a plan. "Buying" a huge life insurance policy in exchange for voting
correctly, he then hires an unknown assassin to kill him.
With the new found freedom, Bulworth discovers life. He begins telling the
truth as he sees it - a definite no-no for a politician. In the beginning his
pronouncements are convoluted. He tells an all-black church that unless they
stop eating chicken wings and backing OJ, they'll never be rid of people like
him. At a Hollywood fund-raiser, he condemns movies as shoddy products and
says that the only reason that he's there is because they are all rich Jews.
At a Black after-hours club, he begins to have some fun. Dancing with the
luscious Halle Berry in one of the most erotic scenes ever involving two
vertical people, he falls for her and decides that he wants to live. Now he
has to figure out how to call off the contract.
There are some fascinating aspects of the film. The story follows traditional
mythological aspects of a heroic journey. The lost man travels deep into the
underworld to discover his soul and finds truth. Reborn a new person, he
attempts to right wrongs.
There is also the political angle. In this arena, the movie seems somewhat
anachronistic. It's a film that could have been made years ago and although
the circumstances are still the same, that portion seems dated.
The confusion comes when these two are mixed. Just when Bulworth's search for
his new life is becoming interesting, the election throws that line off track.
The assassination device also is troublesome. While it works to get the story
into gear, after that it gets in the way. Bulworth's dodging his murderer is a
waste of time in what is an otherwise enticing film.
Two weeks after mulling over the movie in the vast recesses of the back of my
mind, there are still a few things that I can't get a grasp on. The most
wondrous character in the film is an elderly homeless man who runs into
Bulworth at opportune times to say...something. He ties into the mythological
journey but how? Who is he and what is his purpose in the film? Either I'm too
dim to understand or he (and a few other scenes) is tossed in the mix just for
weirdness. I would prefer to think it's the latter.
Bulworth is a well-constructed ride and thought-provoking. The answers aren't
readily apparent and maybe that's a good thing.

Director: Warren Beatty || Screenplay: Warren Beatty and Jeremy Pikser || Stars:
Warren Beatty (Jay Billington Bulworth), Halle Berry (Nina), Oliver Platt
(Dennis Murphy), Don Cheadle (L.D.), Paul Sorvino (Graham Crockett), Jack Warden
(Eddie Davers), Christine Baranski (Constance Bulworth), Joshua Malina (Bill
Feldman) || MPAA Rating: R
Warren Beatty's "Bulworth" is a caustic political comedy that doesn't attack any
particular political group, but rather the ingrained insincerity that has
infected the American political system. Some might think this film is vulgar,
and in many ways it is. However, as loud and raucous as it is, "Bulworth" speaks
the truth, which is almost always ugly to hear.
Beatty, who directed the film and co-wrote the script with Jeremy Pikser ("The
Lemon Sisters"), stars as incumbent U.S. Senator Jay Billington Bulworth, who
has one of the best politician names in cinema history. Bulworth is a Democrat,
and in Beatty's view, he is symbolic of everything that has gone wrong with the
current Democratic Party. Once an ideological liberal (like Beatty still is),
Bulworth has long since succumbed to the materialistic pressures of Washington.
Instead of waging the battles for the impoverished and the downtrodden, which
was once the calling card of Democrats, Bulworth has become another sell-out
money hound - if he's not accepting illegal bribes from the insurance lobby or
taking campaign contributions from the Chinese, he's making wind-bag speeches
that start with the amusingly Clintonesqe statement, "America is standing on the
doorstep of a new millennium .... blah, blah, blah."
When the film opens, it is a few days before the 1996 primary elections, and
Bulworth is sitting at his desk weeping because he realizes how corrupt he has
become. In a fit of desperation, he takes out a $10 million life insurance
policy from a dirty insurance rep played by Paul Sorvino (part of a shady lobby
deal to kill a threatening bill in committee), and then hires a hit man to kill
him, although he doesn't know who the assassin will be, or when the hit will
take place.
Knowing that he will soon be dead, Bulworth unleashes his own brand of political
rhetoric on the world, which is made up of politically incorrect truths about
the state of American politics and the society in general. At a Compton church,
he tells the group of African-Americans that they will have no power in the U.S.
unless they "put down that malt liquor and chicken wings, and get behind
somebody other than a running back who stabs his wife." Later, in a particularly
hilarious sequence, Bulworth mixes with the Hollywood elite, then insults the
quality of their movies and informs them that the only reason he's there is
because "my guys always put the big Jews on my schedule."
All throughout this physically and politically suicidal escapade, Bulworth's
Chief of Staff, Dennis Murphy (Oliver Platt), follows behind in a state of
constant shock and bewilderment. Platt has some of the movie's funniest scenes,
as he makes Murphy into a politically savvy but nonetheless clueless assistant
who is forced to watch his own career teeter at the brink of being flushed down
the toilet. His constant half-truth-telling and spin-doctoring to cover
Bulworth's stampede is equaled in its perversion only by a self-righteous
reporter (Nora Dunn) who acts like Murphy's refusal to explain Bulworth's
actions (something he really cannot do) is somehow an act of treason.
When Bulworth decides he wants to live after all, and therefore must constantly
evade a grim-looking assassin to be who's trailing him at every turn, he hides
out in the ghetto, complete with a stereotypical gangsta wardrobe which he wears
to one of his television interviews.
At this point, Beatty abandons much of the political aspect and dives into a
cartoonish exploration of the black inner-city experience. Bulworth becomes
friendly with a young black woman named Nina (Halle Berry), who he meets at the
Harlem church rally. She has a tough-talking brother who is deep in debt to a
local gangster named L.D. (Don Cheadle of "Boogie Nights"), who also becomes
involved in Bulworth's campaign. Some of the scenes in the ghetto ring true, but
much of it feels like a lighter version of scenes depicted in more intense
inner-city films like "Boyz'N'Hood" (1991) and "Menace II Society" (1993).
"Bulworth's" chief liability is Beatty's insistence on having his character
adopt a clumsy style of rap as his new communication device. Instead of speaking
at political rallies, he breaks into a kind of rhythmless rap style that is a
reminder of why almost all hip-hop stars are black. It's hard to tell whether
Beatty is being humorous by being so bad, or whether he's actually that
incompetent. At any rate, the rap sounds more Run D.M.C. than Snoop Doggy Dogg,
which makes the film seem dated instead of contemporary. Beatty would have been
better off simply adopting some of the inner-city lingo and working that into
his speeches, instead of trying to sound like L.L. Cool J.
Other than that, "Bulworth" hits all its targets with wry, hilarious accuracy.
The film is like a letter bomb to the Democratic Party, and even if you don't
agree with Beatty's liberal message about the unrequited duties of the federal
government, it is hard to deny the impact the film has in exploring the monetary
and moral debauchery that infests modern politics. Unlike "Primary Colors" which
opened earlier this year, "Bulworth" doesn't try to tip-toe around the truly
painful issues that hit close to home - instead, it takes them dead-on.

This review contains some minor spoilers for the feature film
"Bulworth," but I promise not to give away any major revelations
concerning the plot.
Nutshell: A smart, funny, and pointed political satire that takes some
risks.
Cast includes: Warren Beatty (Jay Bulworth), Halle Berry (Nina),
Oliver Platt (Dennis Murphy), Don Cheadle (L.D.), Paul Sorvino (Graham
Crockett), Jack Warden (Eddie Davers), Christine Baranski (Constance
Bulworth)
Distributed by 20th Century Fox (USA)
Screenplay by Warren Beatty and Jeremy Pikser
Produced by Warren Beatty and Pieter Jan Brugge
Directed by Warren Beatty
The central figure in "Bulworth" is a man who is fed up with the
pointlessness and nonsense of the system. The problem is, he's part of
the system--a U.S. senator who plays the political game not unlike, we
may suspect, every other person in American politics. He's trapped in
a world where words and image mean everything and in-practice policy
and true intentions mean virtually nothing.
The man is democratic Senator Jay Bulworth, portrayed by Warren Beatty
in a hypercharged, madcap performance that borders on the surreal,
which is perfectly appropriate, since "Bulworth" is a film that exists
in a sort of surreal state. This isn't a film about realistic events
or circumstances; it's all about attitude. The movie is a commentary
that takes situations and twists them into exaggerated parodies of the
American political arena.
As the movie opens, Bulworth, the incumbent up for re-election, sits
in his office in a trancelike state, staring blankly at footage from
his own TV campaign ads. He hasn't eaten or slept in days, but instead
has been pondering the nature of his political existence. He's
disgusted to the point of catatonia. He has reached a point in his
career where everything he does exists simply to serve his own
campaign's interests. Why is he even in office? All of his
advertisements and speeches begin with the same sound bite: "We stand
at the doorstep of a new millennium." But just what does that mean?
It's an irrelevant line of hogwash--frosting that just sounds good.
When you think about it, it doesn't serve any useful purpose.
One of his wealthy campaign contributors (Paul Sorvino) is a powerful
corporate influence in the insurance industry--a right-winger who is
happy that Bulworth's new platform takes a more conservative slant
than in the past. Sorvino's character is the type whose opinion of
blacks boils down to being a fan of Colin Powell and Michael Jordan,
but not at all sympathetic where black poverty and crime are
concerned. So the fact that Bulworth's new policy is to step away from
social programs and aid is a big plus in his book.
But Bulworth doesn't seem very interested with the issue at all. He
wants out--now. So he hires out a hit on himself. Set to travel to
California for his campaign, he expects to be dead before he returns.
("If I'm not dead by Monday, I'm going to stop payment on that
check.") Once he gets to California it seems like campaign business as
usual, until Bulworth realizes that he might as well make the best out
of knowing he's not going to see the end of next week.
>From here, Bulworth ceases all self-censorship and simply says what's
on his mind. When he gives a speech early in the film in front of an
African-American community, he says the only reason he made any
promises to black voters is so that he could garner their votes. Sure,
we've seen this "tell all truth" slant on such material before, but
the difference in "Bulworth" is that all of the film's points
eventually turn inward to stare the political machine straight in the
eye.
A big part of the movie's comedic sell is the way Bulworth's newfound
cavalier attitude leads him into a techno-rap dance club, where he
jams the night away with Nina (Halle Berry), a young black woman from
South Central L.A. who proves with each succeeding scene that there's
more to her than anyone might suspect.
As a satire, "Bulworth" is often scathing and always pointed, and it's
interesting to ponder the intended audiences of a film starring and
directed by a 60-year-old white guy and featuring a soundtrack that's
wall-to-wall with youthful hip-hop. After his night in the club,
Beatty's character incorporates rap into his political campaign, much
to the bewilderment of his campaign manager (Oliver Platt). Scenes
where Bulworth "rhymes" his speeches to a well-to-do audience or on a
TV broadcast could've been hopelessly silly, but Beatty pulls it off,
finding the balance between zany, tongue-in-cheek farce and blunt
social commentary. Beatty's decision to push the envelope pays off; I
was constantly interested in where the movie would go next, and was
glad that it pulled few punches.
As the plot unfolds and Bulworth careens from one campaign site to
another, he finds himself in an enigmatic relationship with Nina, who
has some interesting political views of her own. Bulworth, of course,
also realizes he has been freed from his burden of politics and thus
no longer wants to die, so both he and Nina find themselves on the run
from the apparent hitman whom Bulworth hired. The chase takes on a
life of its own.
In the process, the movie devours cliches just as fast as or faster
than it acknowledges them. The irony of the movie's use of rap music
in juxtaposition with politics is interesting; some politicians
frequently target rap as a social problem, but Bulworth's answer to
the accusation that rap is "obscene" is particularly interesting. In a
world with so many tangible problems, blaming the entertainment
industry seems more than just a little ridiculous.
As a comedy, "Bulworth's" laughs are generated through witty social
mockery as well as the plot's obvious sight and dialogue gags. The
pace is fast and furious; one of the film's biggest appeals is the
high-energy buzz generated by the rapid-fire dialogue. You have to
listen fast in many scenes, because the film is a constant earful.
Many characters serve to unleash snippets of the screenplay's points
of view, and some have entire speeches that add to the film's canvas
(particularly an interesting drug dealer character played by Don
Cheadle, whose exploitative use of his advantages is compared to the
methods of politicians). Such speeches are sudden an lengthy--yet
remain just far enough outside the confines of sullen
seriousness--that we always know "Bulworth" is a comedy, but also that
it is an angry comedy with a lot on its mind.
The topics range anywhere from big-business economics versus
government spending, the plight of forgotten minorities in the
inner-cities, the inefficient use of media to cover politics, and the
fact that drug use isn't limited to back alleys (Bulworth's campaign
manager snorts cocaine whenever his stress levels breach their
limits)--really, anything is fair game. Essentially, the movie is an
argument for socialism. But it's worth noting that a man like Bulworth
could never maintain a plausible existence in our mainstream political
system, which is perhaps why the film's closing scene is all the more
honest and true.
Perhaps everything about "Bulworth" can be summed up in that first
scene, where the "doorstep of the next millennium" is uttered over and
over again until it becomes its own useless cliche in the sea of
political cliches. Maybe, the film argues, that's what politics is all
about: It's all window dressing used to spice up a process that
doesn't serve its people nearly as adequately as it should. "Bulworth"
offers little in terms of realistic solutions to the problems it
points out; it is, essentially an angry farce that is willing to
tackle anything and everything it can muster. But it's so much smarter
and fresher than the average movie. It may not know exactly how the
world can be fixed, but it certainly knows that there's more broken
with America than the people in Washington would likely be willing to
acknowledge.

  *******************************************
Warren Beatty directed, produced and co-wrote the very innovative
BULWORTH.   Long associated with liberal politics, he  here tears into
the political world with its frauds, with no holds barred.   This
results in a hard-hitting, way out film that is a pleasure . . . at
least most of the time . .  to watch.
As the titles appear on the screen, we are barraged with a platitude,
the political commercial, "We stand at the doorstep of a new
millennium."  Over and over and over.
Jay Bulworth is an incumbent United States Senator running for
re-election in the 1996 primaries.  He  has been campaigning hard and
is a nervous wreck. When Graham Crockett (Paul Sorvino) a crooked
lobbyist approaches to make a deal for him to vote "correctly" on some
insurance legislation,  Bulworth asks and receives a ten million
dollar life insurance policy.   He then  arranges to have someone
assassinate him, thus assuring that his daughter will be financially
secure.
No longer having to worry about what to say and act in order to be
re-elected, he goes wild with his new-found freedom of saying whatever
he wishes, however outrageous and politically incorrect it may be.  It
is this new person about whom the movie revolves, frequently in scenes
of great hilarity.    In all of this, Bulworth suddenly finds he wants
to live, especially after  having met the beautiful black Nina (Halle
Berry) and has to contact his assassin, Vinnie (Richard Scott
Sarafian)  to cancel  his murder.     That is more easily said than
done.
Bulworth visits Black churches and tells them, in rap, what they are
doing wrong, how they will never get anything they want unless they
become activists and stop supporting the black athlete who most
believe stabbed his wife.   To Hollywood VIPs he tells  that their
movies are worthless junk.  He alienates Jewish bigwigs.  In short, he
runs a campaign such as no one has nor will ever run again.
Where I got lost was when the wild Bulworth starts doing rap.   It was
just a bit too way out for me who believes "rap music" is an oxymoron.
In this case, though, the lyrics (when I could understand them) were
very good and to the point.
Many fine supporting roles but most noteworthy is that of Oliver Platt
as Murphy, Bulworth's Chief of Staff, who stays with him through thick
(but in the end) not thin.

When Bulworth ended, I allowed myself a sigh of relief:  it is possible
for me to enjoy political satire.  There have been several recent
political films that didn't do a whole lot for me -- Wag the Dog, for
instance, I found to be an intelligent but heartless film, while Primary
Colors is unbearable and unwatchable in its awfulness.  Bulworth is a
far better film than these, both in its execution and lasting
impression.  It's a tremendously funny and intelligent picture, but it
also has an emotional center -- writer/director/star Warren Beatty
allows the audience to identify with his character, and, in turn, we
like him and actually care about the story.   
Beatty plays incumbent Democratic Senator Jay Billington Bulworth; the
film opens and we see Bulworth sobbing as he watches his television
spots over and over again.  He hasn't slept in days, nor has he eaten,
and, almost instantaneously, he goes insane.   He's not stark raving mad
(not outright, anyway), but he's definitely bonkers.   It's the final
weekend of his campaign, and his assistant, Murphy (Oliver Platt) has
written him a speech to feed to a group of Black people in a church in
the ghetto.   Bulworth begins the speech, but suddenly goes off track
and just starts being honest.  "You mean," one lady asks, "the
Democratic party doesn't care about the African American community?" 
"Well," he shouts, laughing, "isn't that obvious?"
The story is propelled by a device in which Bulworth puts out a
contract on his own life (he muses later that it's a bad thing to make
decisions when you're suicidal); he keeps seeing a man in sunglasses
(Graham Beckel) whom he believes to be the hitman.   Bulworth also meets
Nina (Halle Berry) with whom he becomes infatuated.   Suddenly, in the
short span of this weekend, Bulworth's no-nonsense "truth in politics"
methods become a national sensation, and he shoots ahead in the polls
despite the fact that he's appearing on television wearing gang clothes
and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences.
Beatty's work on both sides of the camera is excellent.  His script and
direction are both extremely sharp, as is the surprisingly strong
characterization of Bulworth himself.  Here is a man who's reached his
limit, and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire
political structure.  I like that the film doesn't take a clear shot at
any of the political parties or affiliations, but at politics in general
and how everything is run by the rich (although the anti-rich sentiments
do get a bit tiresome by the end of the film).  Some of the segments are
simply hilarious, such as a lengthy rap that he delivers at a luncheon
dedicated to him.  
Much of the film is completely absurd, but that's the fun part about
it.  It's an angry, serious film at the core, but the package that
Beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in
the genre.  What adds to this feeling is Beatty's portrayal of Bulworth;
this is a performance that deserves recognition on a higher scale.  
Beatty is so much fun to watch here -- he's always funny, but he's also
subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely
noticeable actions.   Beatty is so good that Bulworth, despite his
shortcomings as a human being, is an entirely sympathetic and likable
character almost from the beginning.
The supporting cast is vast and colorful.  Berry is luminous, as
always, and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles.  Don
Cheadle has a good role as a drug dealer who uses gun-toting toddlers to
do his dirty work.  Oliver Platt is an actor who should be careful, for
someday I fear he may induce a heart attack with the intensity of his
acting (though he's very funny to watch).  Paul Sorvino adds the
Southern accent to his list of mastered inflections.
Is Bulworth offensive?  I suppose some may see it that way.  I wasn't
offended by the film, but then again, I hardly care about politics.  I
think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided
by the honesty of the story.  The film isn't perfect, of course -- the
ending didn't quite work for me, and the a few of the scenes between
Bulworth and Nina feel forced (although the eclectic dance sequence is
fantastic).  But these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant
film.  Bulworth is a smart, uproariously funny picture that proves to me
that political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface.

BULWORTH (director/writer:Warren Beatty; screenwriters:Jeremy Pikser;
based on a story by Beatty/ cinematographer: Vittorio Storaro;
cast:Warren Beatty (Sen. Jay Bulworth), Halle Berry (Nina), Oliver Platt
(Bulworth's campaign manager), Don Cheadle (drug dealer, L.D.), Paul
Sorvino (head of an insurance corp.,Graham Crockett), Jack Warden (Eddie
Davers), Christine Baranski (Senator Bulworth's wife), Amiri Baraka
(homeless man), 1998)
A satirical film where Warren Beatty tries to talk the black man's rap
to get across his political message: which is that there's something
wrong in politics that corrupts everyone in it. He plays a
self-destructing liberal Democratic California senator, Bulworth (
pretty close to bullshit), who is running for re-election in 1996 and is
suffering from despondency after several sleepless nights. He is unhappy
with the phony he has become, so his solution is to hire an unknown hit
man to kill him. He also takes out a $10 million dollar life insurance
policy for his teenage daughter's benefit with an insurance
representative who is influencing his vote on some impending insurance
legislation.
But something happens to him along the way to a South Central L.A. black
church, where he decides to tell the truth. Maybe he does this because
he feels relieved that he's going to die soon. Anyway, he starts
chastising the congregation for following the guilty O.J. Simpson and
not fighting for the real needs of the community, such as the failure of
inner-city schools and developing local businesses and filling the need
for black leaders to replace those who got killed in the '60s and '70s;
and, he blames himself and all politicians for taking the easy money the
corporations give to make sure their side is always taken care of.
Tossing aside a prepared speech about the country that starts off
saying, "We stand on the doorstep of a new millennium... ." Instead, he
tells the black congregation that the government doesn't care about them
because they don't contribute enough money to re-election campaigns.
Beatty believes that is the problem with the country, the great divide
between the haves-and-the have-nots must be resolved, and that the
politicians will always support those who contribute to them and ignore
those who have no power unless there is some kind of election reform.
He encounters a sexy black woman in the church, Nina (Halle ), who
re-invigorates him, reminding him how he once thought of himself as a
liberal Democrat who cared about the truth, but who has now lost the way
and seems no different than the Republicans. She takes him to a hip-hop
club and he sheds his whiteness in favor of the black man's rap, which
he will ridiculously imitate for the remainder of the campaign, to the
initial fright of his campaign staff led by Oliver Platt, in the role of
a stereotypical flunky, no new acting ground is broken here, as the main
comedy of the film comes about as the sleazy Pratt adopts to any view
that keeps him in power. The other key staff member is his veteran
campaign advisor, Jack Warden, who plays his minor role low-key, trying
to go with his successful meal ticket as far it could take him.
Invited to speak before a largely Jewish crowd of supporters in the
entertainment field, he tells them they make crappy films and are only
interested in making money. At a business luncheon he insults the big
contributors to his campaign, such as, Paul Sorvino, who is head of an
insurance corporation that gives him campaign money and money under the
table to block an insurance bill that would help the indigent.
Falling for Nina, meeting her family in their house, he leaves the house
and goes strolling in the hood and ends up trying to be a combo of Jerry
Lewis and James Cagney in one body, helping some drug dealing boys in
the street from getting beat on by a racist cop. This is an awkardly
embarrassing scene, that was more embarrassing than funny to watch
Beatty try to ingratiate himself this way to his black brothers. It
reminded me in an analogous way of the liberals in the '60s who invited
the Black Panthers into their wealthy homes and thought they were so
chic.
Bulworth also decides he is beginning to have some fun, or maybe its the
weed and coke that got to him, as he tries to get a hold of the hit man
and call off the job. The most unbelievable scene in the film-a scene
that was just too gooey to take without asking what Beatty was thinking
of-was the conversion of the local drug dealer (Cheadle) to the cause of
the community after hearing one of Beatty's speeches on TV. Even Frank
Capra wasn't that schmaltzy.
Meanwhile CNN is interviewing him and C-Span is following him around in
a truck, not understanding where he is going with this new image change.
The story gets too ridiculous at this point to even be satirical or
credible, it is just bad filmmaking; but it does try in its unclear and
scrambled way to blame the media and the rich people who control it, for
not being risk takers and offering fresh arguments into the political
fray. In his contemptuous style (which hides a self-righteous anger), he
sounds more preachy than a Sidney Lumet does in Network, as he seems to
have retained an old liberal paternalistic style towards blacks from
back in the days of the '60s and '70s, that he can't shake.
Amiri Baraka (poet & playwright), supposedly a voice of consciousness,
plays a homeless wiseman who keeps popping up from scene-to-scene,
uttering this heavy stream of consciousness rap, "We need no more
ghosts, we need a spirit."
The fault of the film, is that Beatty can't gracefully pull off what he
is trying to accomplish without appearing to be smug about it, like he's
the white man who knows best what to do, and that anything he does is
super cool because he really cares about the blacks and the poor (sic).
His naive solution for race problems is to have the races fornicate
together and have a mixed racial country.
Everyone in the film is a cardboard prop for Beatty to lay it into them
with his political cliches.
Just when I thought Wag the Dog was the stupidest political comedy I
ever saw, along comes this sophomoric venture, showing no plausible way
of replacing the old lies of Senator Bulworth with his new so-called
truths, and as a result it is a film that out wags the dog's tail in
silliness and prattle, unable to have the demented Bulworth say what he
would do when elected, except what is implied, that the people will
trust him because he's so hip and daring, and he's just so with it.
There was a smugness about this film that made its childish political
voice seem more annoying than it should be, even taking away any
enjoyment that might have been derived from its comic efforts. This is
just a bad film that tried to say something about social injustice, the
class differences between the rich and the poor, the unfair loss of
welfare programs, the inhibiting cost of health insurance that is
falsely being blamed on the government when it is the fault of insurance
companies why the rates are so high, the hypocrisies of the Gulf War,
and the failure of the media to be more responsive in covering all the
political corruption. Beatty is just not the filmmaker I would want
telling my side of the story. He has a way of glossing over his once
real candidate's foibles, Bobby Kennedy and Gary Hart, while pretending
to have answers that he doesn't have or at least, doesn't present them
that well in the film. All he has done is make a film that is cliched
and overbearing and funny in a not funny way, and he sounds no different
or trustworthy than the politicians he features in the film, Clinton and
Dole. And, I don't mean that as a compliment.

Political satire is tough to do.  Especially in America; our
government's absurdities aren't as outrageous as those of a banana
republic's.  And it's really tough to do it in a movie, where
considerations like narrative and characterization have to contend with
political commentary.  If you want to point out what's wrong with the
government, it seems you have to write either a long, dull, harangue of
a book, or a snappy op-ed piece which, if it's done really well, will
still be talked about two weeks after it's printed.
Even the greatest movies that we call political satires aren't really
about politics.  DUCK SOUP is much more successful as a vehicle for the
Marx Brothers' nihilistic insanity than as a patch on the rise of 
dictatorships in the 1930s.  DR. STRANGELOVE, too, is more of an antiwar
screed that mocks Cold War paranoia rather than going at the nuts and
bolts of America's political system.  Lately, we've seen WAG THE DOG, a
jaunty film whose shallow cynicism didn't accomodate serious political
commentary, and PRIMARY COLORS, more of a character study of politicians
and their aides.
These things are important to remember while pondering the
hard-to-fathom critical raves that have greeted Warren Beatty's
BULWORTH.  If this is what passes for political satire these days, we
should bring back the '60s.  Beatty's film is co-produced by Frank Capra
III, which is only appropriate, since this movie is about as trenchant
as MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, though not nearly as entertaining.
The movie's title character is a Democratic U.S. Senator from California
named Jay Billington Bulworth (His family names evoke old money, but the
avuncular "Jay" is tacked on as his Christian name.  I suppose if he'd
used the initial "J." instead, he'd be a Republican and we'd have a
different movie.).  With a primary election approaching, Bulworth has a
Jerry Maguire-like crisis of conscience brought on by insomnia and bad
pizza, and he puts out a contract on himself.  Freed from caring about
what happens to him, he proceeds to a church in South Central L.A. and
tells the crowd that Democrats don't care about African-Americans any
more.  He then embarks on a crusade of publicity stunts designed to
expose the undue political influence wielded by corporate fatcats.
The first problem with the movie is that it's too placid.  Bulworth is a
dependably self-serving pol who suddenly goes off the deep end, and
Beatty's the wrong actor to play this type.  Al Pacino or Jack 
Nicholson would have been too crazy from the get-go, but Beatty isn't
crazy enough - there's no sense of liberation to Bulworth's unburdening
of his soul.  The part needed Gene Hackman, or maybe an older Mel 
Gibson.
It's more than just a case of the wrong actor playing Bulworth.  The
rest of the world around him seems curiously undisturbed by such a
high-level politician's pulling a Howard Stern act.  When he raps at a 
fundraiser (the movie's best scene), Bulworth's wife Connie (Christine
Baranski) just pinches the bridge of her nose, as if he had committed a
medium-sized faux pas like admitting that he hated TITANIC.  It's 
hard to believe that Bulworth's love affair with the truth is such a big
deal if he isn't creating an uproar.  This is Beatty the director's
fault - a more media-savvy filmmaker like Tim Robbins or even Barry 
Sonnenfeld would have brought BULWORTH's look and feel in line with the
Information Age, and imparted some comic verve to this satire that's too
self-important to be funny.
The subplot about Bulworth running from his own hit man doesn't pay
off.  Nina, a girl whom Bulworth picks up at a black nightclub, is a
particularly rickety construct.  She's a revolutionary descendant of
Black Panthers posing as a nightclubber, which is just this side of
plausible, but having her at the center of the assassination plot is too
much for the thin characterization to bear.  Her two-minute academic
treatise on the problems in America's inner cities is just painful.  It
doesn't help that she's played by Halle Berry, an uninteresting actress
to begin with who's too refined for a part like this.  Only someone who
has been in Hollywood as long as Warren Beatty could mistake her for a
girl from the 'hood.
The movie's an aging white boy's idea of cutting-edge (and it's
disappointing to see some other aging white boys in the press praising
the film).  The satirical targets are dusty, offensive stereotypes -
Jewish Hollywood suits, Chinese businessmen, crooked insurance
executives.  This filters all the way down to Nina's tag-along friends,
who improbably add gospel harmonies to a church hymn.  Meanwhile, Beatty 
plays it safe and scores some cheap points off special interest groups
without faulting the voters who elect their puppets (and pay to see
movies, by the way).  Well, Bulworth does tell the black voters to "put
down your fried chicken wings and malt liquor and get behind someone
else besides a running back who stabs his wife."  The fact that this is
the movie's only challenge to the electorate only deepens the movie's 
racism.  I'm sure that was hardly Beatty's intention, but there it is.
Beatty has been praised for taking the unprecedented step of making fun
of himself in this movie.  Yes, Bulworth's stilted rap and constant need
to ask the meaning of phrases like "nappy dugout" raises hopes that the
movie's derision will extend to white wannabe hipsters.  Sadly, though,
Beatty fancies himself down with the brothers in more important ways. 
He presents Bulworth as a hero for touting old-fashioned white liberal
attitudes, laced with some obscenities and a nastier attitude.  It isn't
that this thinking is bereft of good intentions, but BULWORTH only
proves how hopelessly simplistic it is as a take on race relations. 
African-American intellectual life is enriched by its diverse
viewpoints, and the movie, instead of seizing the opportunity to depict
that, uses its black characters to unquestioningly validate Bulworth's 
point of view.  By the end of the movie, Nina adoringly tells the
senator, "You my nigga."  (My immediate reaction to hearing that line: 
"Eww.") 
There are a few bright spots.  Don Cheadle's burdened with the role of a
drug dealer whom Bulworth converts to activism, but he works hard to
keep it real.  Oliver Platt's here, too, as Bulworth's coked-up chief of
staff, and he's a dangerous man to have in a supporting cast, because he
steals scenes so easily (he's been doing it for years, too - why hasn't
he gotten more work?).  He's the only one who lends any urgency to the
proceedings.
BULWORTH provides more evidence that Warren Beatty has succumbed to his
own ego.  What a shame that such an intelligent and committed artist
will probably go down in history with 1990's DICK TRACY as the pinnacle
of his film-directing career.  Bulworth's Robert Kennedyesque
assassination is the culmination of nothing except Beatty's own
martyrdom complex - he sees himself going over that hill with Abraham,
Martin, and John.  Warren, here's a tip.  You're still handsome at 61,
you're fabulously wealthy, you're happily married (I presume) to a
beautiful movie star, and you have three beautiful children with 
her.  Think twice before you ask us to feel bad for you.

Starring Warren Beatty, Halle Berry and Oliver Platt
Directed By Warren Beatty
Running Time: 1 hour 40 minutes.
Warren Beatty returns to the screens in the   funniest, craziest and hard
hitting movie in his career. Based on a story concocted by himself, and also
written by Beatty, Bulworth gives a good insight of what Beatty thinks of
the American government system. Beatty stars as Senator Jay Bulworth, who's
going through a nervous breakdown. After hiring someone to kill him, he
completely changes his campaign strategy and tells the honest truth about
what's _really_ happening in American politics, much to the annoyance of
assistant Dennis Murphy (Platt.)   Instead of everyone hating him, the
American public love him. However, inside his party, more people want to
kill him than just the hired assassin. And he also strikes a relationship
with black girl Nina (Berry.)
It's remarkable that this film was released at all. Much more open than the
rather subdued Primary Colours, Bulworth barely gives the American politic
system a good name. The outrageous remarks Bulworth makes to his potential
voters are very funny, and also somewhat true. It's great that Beatty isn't
afraid to let loose on a subject. Talking of Beatty, he's excellent in the
role of the demented Senator, clearing having fun. And seeing Warren Beatty
have fun is a rare sight indeed. Even in Dick Tracy, he was the most
straighten face actor. (Then again, he was the only characters face we could
completely see.) The film gives an opportunity for the 61 year old Beatty to
indulge in some rapping, which he does with gusto (and also quite well.) And
seeing Beatty as a 'homeboy' has to be seen to be believed. It's nice to see
that Beatty can laugh at himself. Second best is Oliver Platt as the
flustered, coke snorting assistant, who goes over the top when he finally
snaps. Halle Berry is fine, and sexy, as the intellectual Nina, who comes to
like the senator. Also popping up in the supporting cast is Paul Sorvino wit
h a strange accent, Laurie Metcalf as the exact same characters she's also
played, and Christine Baranski of Cybill fame as Bullworths wife, who all
contribute to the fun. And, this being a political film, the ubiquitous
Larry King makes an appearance, as, *shock*, himself.
The writing and directing, both by Beatty, are above par. The direction is
very nearly sitcom like, but suits the film perfectly, and both the politics
are gangland parts are handled well. The script is funny, and the raps are
actually well produced and humorous, and quite clever. They're not cringe
inducing, at least. The script makes many points about society in America
today, and isn't afraid to make any bold statements about what is a flawed
system. Best of all, the film is thought provoking, but directed and written
in such a way that the film feels as light as a feather, and is very
entertaining. There's also a great rap soundtrack with some well chosen
tunes.
Bulworth is a film with many advantages, and few flaws. Perhaps it could be
somewhat embarrassing to see a 61 year old man rapping, but Beatty does it
so well it's irrelevant. In fact, there's very little against Bulworth,
except for the language which is very heavy, but then again it should be
expected. Bulworth, then, is well worth watching.

It's ironic that I watched this Warren Beatty political comedy just when the
rumors of the actor actually running for the Democratic nomination for
President in the year 2000 are beating about.
PLOT:
A suicidal political candidate decides to hire someone to assassinate him a
few days before his election race ends, and takes his knowledge of this
fact, to tell people exactly what's on his mind, no matter how crude or out
of line it may be. He also seems to take on an African-American spirit, and
surprising to everyone, including himself, people actually begin to respect
his newfound honesty.
CRITIQUE:
An okay movie with plenty of insightful commentary on the state of American
politics today, the plight of the poor and African-Americans in today's
society, and all the unwritten political rules that we should all be aware
of by now. Having said that, I thought that only some of the scenes in this
film were genuinely funny, I did NOT appreciate the "rap character" that
Bulworth's persona would take on from time to time (It just didn't feel
right to me), and thought there was just too much focus on only one aspect
of American political injustice (i.e. Is Compton the biggest issue out
there?). Beatty and surprisingly, Berry, pulled in some neat performances,
and the soundtrack was pretty cool, but I thought that the film just
oscillated between too many genres, comedy, drama, romance, political, to
satisfy any one completely. On a high note, Oliver Platt delivered one of
his best performances ever, with a great rendition of the ultimate sleazy,
hypocritical sidekick who changes his opinion on anything in a second, as
long as it pleases the populace. All in all, a thoroughly original script,
performed with some good actors, but Beatty's unbelievable "rap character"
and the somewhat unfocused direction of the script, left me somewhat
detached.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Plenty of cameos in this film: George Hamilton, who is mentioned in the
script as someone that Bulworth resembles, Jan Carl from Entertainment
Tonight, talk show host Larry King, playing himself as usual, out-of-work
actor, William Baldwin, as Bulworth's opponent in the race, and director
Paul Mazursky.
Look for the movie marquee in one of the black neighborhoods that shows a
double-bill of SUPERFLY and BLACULA.
Actress Halle Berry was the first runner-up in the 1986 Miss USA pageant.
She was also named Miss Ohio in 1986, and Miss Teen All American in 1985.
She was married to baseball player David Justice for about three years.
Oliver Platt's dad, Nicholas Platt, is an ex-ambassador to Pakistan, Zambia,
& the Phillipines. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree with a major
in Drama in 1983 from Tufts University.

*** (out of 4) On seeing the outrageous previews for BULWORTH one wonders
what plot could possibly allow Beatty get away with making those statements
(In case you missed it, Warren Beatty plays a politician on the campaign
trail. He says to a black congregation "...if you can't cut down on malt
liquor and chicken wings and get behind someone other than a running back
who stabs his wife, you're never gonna get rid of me.") 
Well, there is such a plot, and it works very well in this comedy. Beatty
plays Jay Billington Bulworth, a long-time Democratic senator from
California. The movie opens on a painfully repetitious montage of Bulworth's
latest commercials condemning affirmative action. The montage is ironically
intercut with pictures of Martin Luther King and Bulworth in his youth
working with Jack Kennedy. When we finally lay eyes on Bulworth he is
morosely weeping in front of his TV, having gone without food or sleep for
days. 
His campaign is entering the final weekend before the primaries but his
depression has sunk in too far for him to care. First he calls a lobbyist
from the insurance industry to get a bribe - a $10 million life insurance
policy in his daughter's name. Then he calls an associate to arrange for his
own assassination. His assistant Murphy (Oliver Platt) is oblivious to
Bulworth's suicidal state and drags him to his speaking engagements. 
Bulworth halfheartedly reads his speech at an African-American church, then
takes questions from the audience. He is hit hard with questions about his
voting record. He had promised money to help rebuild the community after the
riots, and it hasn't shown up. 
Since he's a dead man anyway, he figures he'll answer truthfully: he and
Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich came to L.A. for the photo opportunity. They
made some promises that improved their public image for a while, and then
counted on the media and the public to eventually forget about the promises
they made. The shock and outrage from the congregation grows, the questions
keep coming, and he keeps shooting back honest, if ugly, answers. 
(Before I go further, I'd like to make a distinction that the Denver Post
failed to make, and that is that characterizing African-Americans as
malt-liquor drinking O.J. fans is not part of Bulworth's "truth." That line
is in the trailers but it should not be praised like the other political
confessions he makes in the movie. When the critics praise Beatty for
speaking the truth about politics, this line is not what they're talking
about.) 
The experience is liberating. With nothing left to lose, Bulworth is no
longer restricted to burping generic platitudes out of both sides of his
mouth. He can say whatever he wants because he's going to be dead anyway.
Why not tell the people the truth about being a sleazy politician - that he
is bought and paid for by lobbyists, and that racism among the populace
protects politicians from being the target of charges of classism? 
Bulworth's candor wins him three volunteers from the church, one of whom,
Nikki (Halle Barry), he gets a crush on. He feels so good afterwards that he
actually eats something. Chicken wings, appropriately enough. 
Bulworth shows up late for his meeting with some movie studio executives.
When one of them asks where he stands on government regulation of movie and
TV ratings, Bulworth drifts to the topic of the quality of filmed
entertainment. With so much money and so many talented people working so
hard, he wonders, why can't Hollywood make a quality product. (You go,
Warren!) When they become indignant and ask why he's talking to them if he
has such a low opinion of their product, he callously admits that it's
because they are rich Jews. 
That night he drops the three African-American volunteers at their
nightclub, and he decides to go in with them. He stays up all night
drinking, smoking pot, dancing, falling in love with Nikki, and learning to
scratch turntables and rap. 
The next day, he shuns his prepared speech and instead raps to the
suit-and-tie fundraisers. From then on, at all of his political appearances,
he raps his political truth. His rap is not bad for a middle-aged white guy.
He's not very good, but it is his first try and at least he's not
embarrassingly bad. His lobbyists are not amused, but the rest of his
constituency seems to like the new Bulworth. 
Eventually, the movie's plot (remember he hired a hit man?) overtakes the
politics, which is too bad. Screen time is spent with Bulworth trying to
cancel the request for his assassination while the hit man seems to be
closing in on him. There are even a few gratuitous chase scenes, Bulworth
fleeing his killer. These scenes may have been necessary to keep the events
of the film moving along, but it distracted and detracted from Bulworth's
political ranting, which was much more interesting than the ever-present,
obvious-looking assassin. 
Still, most of the movie is original and very enjoyable, and Beatty deserves
most of credit for bringing it to the screen. As the story and screen
writer, he came up first with a good structure, then with good dialogue to
back it up (Jeremy Pikser co-wrote the screenplay). As an actor, he was able
to convincingly portray Bulworth's depression, then liberation and rebirth.
As a producer (there were four others) he was able to keep the movie free
from Hollywood's indulgent formulas (except for those inexcusable chase
scenes). Someone else probably could have directed, but since he was there
anyway, what the heck. 
It's too bad that there aren't more movies like this around - movies that
tackle political corruption in a way that challenges viewers to pay more
attention to real politics. After all, much of the inspiration for BULWORTH
is straight out of the news. Just a little perception and insight and you
could write your own Bulworth rants. Just don't expect to be popular with
the insurance companies.

   It's one of those stories where you're out late walking through a bad
neighborhood, back alley, empty parking garage or seedy bar, etc.,you
know you shouldn't have been in in the first place...
    At one point or another almost all of my friends have related their
own personal wrong place/wrong time' adventure(s) to me. Less than half
but more than a couple of these stories have a similar plot thread: The
highest point of anxiety was when the person was approached by a big
black guy.  Now, what you can't pick up from reading this is the
intonation used on the words "big BLACK guy". It's almost a verbal wink
which suggests that the extra fear is so universal that even I, being
black myself, should understand and sympathize.
    *Sigh*
    I don't blame my friends or even bother to get annoyed by this
anymore. These are intelligent, liberal-minded people who are as
susceptible as the rest of us to the negative images bombarding us
everyday. Not so much from anything as blatant as the news but from many
more harmless' forms of entertainment that access our subconscious
regularly.
    Take for example the much beloved sitcom CHEERS. It was certainly MY
favorite show when it was on. During it's eleven year run CHEERS managed
to have only one black character...for all of two episodes. He was
Louis:  a BIG, black, lazy and incompetent mailman (oxymoron?) with a
deep voice and a violent streak. The two episodes (which were both very
funny) centered around Cliff running around scared that Louis was going
to beat him up for getting him fired. Now, I don't think that CHEERS is
evil or that there's anything inherently wrong with Louis', except for
the ratio. In eleven years(!!) on America's most popular tv show there
was not one other black person  to contrast him with,  thus he added to
the already growing stereotype.
    I could site hundreds of more examples but what would be the point,
really? Neither of us wants me to suit up and fight every dragon out
there. I  mostly try to stay out of it...Still, sometimes a man's gotta
do what a man's gotta do...
 ...BULWORTH is the story of conservative Democratic senator, J.
Bulworth (Warren Beatty), who suffers a nervous breakdown and begins
publically telling the bitter ugly truth about what goes on behind the
scenes in American politics, much to the chagrin of his staff and the
establishment...he's also taken out a $10 million policy with the
insurance lobby, put out a contract on himself and yadda, yadda,
yadda..."hilarity ensues".
   The political moments of BULWORTH are inspired and biting in their
candor. What's more shocking than what Warren Beatty says is that he's
allowed to say it. For example, when addressing the congregation of a
black church J.Bulworth is asked why he hasn't fulfilled his promises to
minority voters and his response is "Well, you haven't contributed any
money to my campaign, have you?". He goes on to explain that the
insurance and tobacco lobbies DO finance the very expensive campaign he
needs to stay in office which puts him pretty much in their pocket. In
fact, he implicates Clinton, Bush and all politicians as being caught up
in the standard S.O.B. corruption of the machine. Okay, so if you listen
to NPR or Pacifica News everyday the movie just confirms what you've
already pieced together.
   BULWORTH spares almost no one and some of these moments are genius
(if you consider telling the truth genius'). In one scene Halle Berry's
character gives a valid explanation as to why there are no definitive
black leaders these days...Unfortunately, she spews it as if she were
auditioning for a MicroMachines commercial...AND it's the only
intelligent dialogue to come out of a black characters mouth in the
entire movie.
     The film is most successful when J.Bulworth is kicking the
knowledge', but the other 80% is banal and insulting- and not in the way
you might think.  J.Bulworth is no more offensive than Melvin Udall (AS
GOOD AS IT GETS) or Archie Bunker, both who I loved. BULWORTH is
extremely insulting in it's portrayal of black people. It's as if
everything Warren Beatty (who also wrote and directed this) knows about
black people he learned from repeated viewings of HIGH SCHOOL HIGH and
the WB Network sitcoms. When J.Bulworth has his breakdown he becomes
infatuated with Nina (Halle Berry) and spends alot of time in the hood.
There's ALOT of black people in this movie, yet none of them speak or
act realistically like anyone I've ever met. More to the point, they're
all idiots. They made ME want to cut social programs.
    But not everybody's gonna feel the way I do, you may not care about
anything I've said so far. Maybe watching the WB and UPN networks is as
multicultural as you want to get. Say you just picked up a new frame for
your NRA certificate and a signed, limited edition, hardcover copy of
The Bell Curve and you're feeling pretty stoked that the Nazi party is
starting to reform in Germany...Guess, what: The movie still stinks!
    BULWORTH forgets more of its inane plot lines than it remembers. The
humor is all slapstick and fish out of water' setups (Okay, "the rich
white guy is hangin' with the homeys." We get it!). It's and endless
string of "White men can't rap" jokes played to the hilt. So much so
that they start to ruin some of the good scenes. Even if you can't get
enough of that, it has an ending that I guarantee no one- I repeat, NO
ONE will like.
     I really wanted to like BULWORTH, too. I think it had the potential
to be a very important film, but alas, it is a celluloid train wreck.
The shoddiness would be understandable if it'd been made by a first-time
or music video director, but this is Warren-freaking-Beatty we're
talking about here!  He's been making movies since 1961 and won a Oscar
for REDS, which he also wrote and directed.  For every brilliant scene
in BULWORTH that makes me want everybody to see this movie there are
four or five that make me blanche at the idea that anybody will ever see
it...
...And you don't want to see a black man blanche.
  It's scarier than having him ask you for directions on a dark street.

BULWORTH
Reviewed by Jamie Peck
Beatty plays Jay Billington Bulworth, an incumbent California senator 
who finds himself fed up with the glaring falsehoods of his personal and 
professional life -- his political agenda is full of empty promises, his 
marriage is a sham and his re-election TV spots are so phony that they 
move him to tears. Before hitting the weekend campaign trail through 
South Central L.A., Bulworth secretly makes his teenage daughter the 
sole beneficiary of a $10 million life insurance policy and orders a hit 
on himself to be carried out sometime within the several-day time frame. 
But the knowledge that he doesn't have much longer to live allows him, 
for once, to tell it like it is free of consequence. Bulworth finally 
has a reason to live, yet he could die at any given moment. 
Although the hitman storyline acts as a plot catalyst and even throws a 
little intrigue into "Bulworth"'s ripe comedic agenda, it ends up 
largely distracting, mostly due to a related, uninspired twist that pops 
out of nowhere late in the film. Come to think of it, "Bulworth"'s whole 
last quarter could use a little touch-up, since it is here where quite a 
strong movie begins to encounter its share of problems. In particular, 
the African-American characters are underdeveloped, and Bulworth's 
interaction with them in the film's final passages is rather hazy. The 
ending -- especially the sermonizing last scene where "Bulworth"'s 
message is explicitly spelled out for the audience -- has a good chance 
at leaving a bad taste in many viewer's mouths. 
But because Beatty is on the screen during these troubled chapters, 
"Bulworth" is all the more hard to discredit. He gives an electrifying 
performance, maintaining dignity and strength even when Bulworth crudely 
raps his exchanges with a CNN interviewer or giddily searches for his 
favorite expletives in the record collection of an urban nightclub; 
Beatty never turns Jay Bulworth into the walking punchline that he very 
easily could have been. Gorgeous Halle Berry fares very well in an 
ambiguous supporting role as a homegirl whose growing loyalty to the 
senator might lead to something more, but Oliver Platt steals scenes 
from everyone -- except Beatty, who even steals scenes from himself -- 
as Bulworth's chronically distressed aide. 
So while "Bulworth" may grow uneven as it quickly heads toward its iffy 
destination, the trip there is assuredly rewarding, mixing mirth and 
morals in the flawless way that eventually (and sadly) eludes the 
screenplay. Among the fun to be had is a number of crowd-pleasing scenes 
where the game as ever Beatty raps the truth, a gag that threatens to 
both grow old and grate but surprisingly does neither. I'm sorta partial 
to the movie's first big production number, set at a large political 
rally, but a brief luncheon with Hollywood's elite also hits the 
bullseye. There, Beatty criticizes the gathered filmmakers for churning 
out large doses of "crap." Were "Bulworth" a lesser movie, it would be 
guilty of hypocrisy. But thankfully, it isn't.

Bulworth is a movie with a political message, and Warren Beatty -- who
stars, writes, directs and produces -- knows this. So, instead of dancing
around and prettying up the political message, Beatty smashes it over our
heads like a sledgehammer. The hit is not at all painful though; Beatty
approaches the political aspect of the film in a cynical and humorous way.
In March 1996, Senator Jay Billington Bulworth (Beatty) is in a fierce
battle to be reelected. It is a rainy night and Bulworth is sitting in his
office crying while watching his own campaign ads. He's not crying because
his ads touch his heart; he's crying because he's sick of all the lies he's
propagated and promises broken because he took money from lobbyists and big
companies. Bulworth is so depressed that he takes out a contract on his own
life and it is from here that the movie picks up a lot of power.
Knowing that he only has a few more days to live, Bulworth takes this as a
chance to speak what's truly on his mind. He attends a meeting at a church
in South Central L.A. where he bluntly tells the congregation that they
need to put down the malt liqueur, stop complaining, and start doing
something poor living conditions. He also tells them that it's obvious that
the political parties don't care about them because they don't donate
enough money. In a dinner with big movie producers, Bulworth tells them how
truly bad their work is.
Bulworth is ready to be hit until he meets Nina (Halle Berry) a woman
inspired by his speech at the church. And from her he is taken into the
ghettos of L.A. where he sees the injustices that go on there and learns a
little about rap. Bulworth starts to wrap his political messages in rap
lyrics and music. The lyrics to his rap "songs" are raw and angry but carry
a strong good message.
Beatty starts Bulworth off with a lot of energy but as the film progresses,
he loses some. The two speeches he makes, at the church and dinner, are the
two most memorable scenes. A hilarious image is that of Beatty dressed
gangster-style with knee length shorts, a large oversized sweatshirt, some
funky sunglasses, and a knit cap. The movie rests on Beatty's performance;
he takes his part and runs with it. Beatty's performance is brilliant.
Halle Berry does well as Nina but a better supporting role overshadows her
performance. This is Oliver Platt (Executive Decision, Dangerous Beauty) as
Bulworth's hyperactive drug-addicted campaign manager who has to find all
sorts of ways to stop Bulworth's "shoot from the hips" speeches.
One thing that didn't feel right about the film was the ending. The
"convert" plot line, about a dope dealer, feels all wrong and the ambiguous
ending is irksome.
The politics are clearly presented in Bulworth. Like them or not, you'll
love the film. It's entertaining enough on one level to keep you laughing
and attentive. On a deeper level, Bulworth shoves some rather frightening
political views down your throat. Beatty has written, directed, and acted a
brilliant film. If compared to the last two political films that I've seen,
Wag the Dog and Primary Colors, I would have to say this: Bulworth has the
cynicism of Wag the Dog bumped up a few notches and it is brave enough to
go where Primary Colors skirted away from. Don't Miss Bulworth.

Watching BULWORTH was an educational experience. I learned a new slang 
term: nappy dugout. If you don't know what a nappy dugout is, then 
I'm not going to tell you - I try to keep FILMGEEK a family site, 
more or less, and I sure don't want to be responsible for some 
6th-grader running around telling his friends what a nappy dugout is. 
But I hadn't heard it before, and I thought it was pretty funny. 
BULWORTH is full of such surprising moments - surprising because you 
don't necessarily expect this level of energy in a film written and 
directed by a sixty-something actor like Beatty. Check out the recent 
films of Beatty contemporaries Clint Eastwood and Paul Newman, and 
you'll see what I mean; you could show some of these pictures in the 
Geriatric ward and you wouldn't even roust the old folks from their 
checkers games. But BULWORTH moves. It's far from a perfect film, but 
it's sharp, witty and has something to say - three elements that most 
of the pictures released this year have been sorely lacking.
Here's the story. California Senator Jay Bulworth (Beatty) is at the 
end of his rope. A career politician, he finds himself in the middle of 
his latest re-election campaign without hope or moral compass. He's a 
slave to the big insurance companies who finance his campaigns. His 
liberal idealism has long since succumbed to the choking rhetoric of 
Washington which he is forced to spout ad nauseam to keep his place at 
the Federal feed trough. Even his marriage is a sham. Despondent, 
Bulworth makes one last, desperate attempt to break free: he takes out a 
contract on his own life. Beats going to work in the private sector, one 
supposes.
But then something odd happens. Bulworth finds his self-imposed death 
sentence strangely liberating. Fueled by delirium brought on by a lack 
of sleep, he spends his next few campaign stops saying exactly what's 
on his mind. To a congregation of black churchgoers: "If you don't put 
down the malt liquor and the chicken wings and get behind somebody other 
than a running back who stabs his wife, you'll never get rid of 
somebody like me." To a gathering of big-money Hollywood Jews: "Your 
pictures really aren't very good, are they?" And so it goes, until 
Bulworth has drawn the attention of the national media and sent his 
campaign manager Dennis (Oliver Platt) into a cocaine-induced panic. He 
picks up three young black women at the church, including Nina (Halle 
Berry), who seems to take a special interest in him. He parties with 
them at an underground nightclub, where he discovers rap music. The next 
day, he starts rapping his message instead of giving speeches. Suddenly 
he's a hip-hopping, straight-talking sensation, and life is fun again. 
But that pesky hit man is still out there somewhere.
BULWORTH's first act is nothing short of sensational. As actor, writer 
and director, Beatty is in full command; the dialogue is crisp and 
arresting, the story moves swiftly and the performances by Beatty, Berry 
and Platt are right on the money. Those of you who thought WAG THE DOG 
was a good satire should put it up against the first thirty minutes of 
this picture and admit the error of your ways. For a short time, it 
looks as if Beatty is really going to break through with an important 
film. It takes a lot of guts to use studio money to convey the awful 
truth about American politics: that because the same five or six 
multi-national corporations who funnel all the money into political 
campaigns control not only the means of production in this country, but 
also the media outlets which purport to give us an impartial 
dissemination of the facts, American democracy has become simply another 
mindless diversion designed to give us the illusion of freedom. Makes 
you proud to be alive, doesn't it?
Unfortunately, BULWORTH doesn't sustain the same level of brilliance 
throughout. The story literally gets sidetracked in Watts. On the lam 
from the hit man, Bulworth hides out with Nina in her family's home, 
where he gets a good dose of quality black family life. He befriends 
some grade-school drug dealers and confronts their supplier L.D., played 
by BOOGIE NIGHTS alumnus Don Cheadle. Suddenly it seems as if Beatty has 
wandered into another film entirely. By the time the press finds him and 
the political theme gets going again, it's too late; the picture's 
over, and we're left with some fuzzy notions about the inherent good 
of the inner city versus the unrepentant evil of big business. Yadda 
yadda yadda, we've all seen this before.
But for a while, at least, BULWORTH is daring and brilliant. I wish 
Beatty had honed in on his message, had hammered on it until audiences 
left the theater screaming for blood. Film has that power. It's true 
that if a politician who spoke the truth like Bulworth ever actually 
came along, he'd most likely be ignored. These are boom times, after 
all, and as long as there are SUVs to lease and mutual funds to dabble 
in, we're not likely to pay much attention to what goes on over our 
heads. But the good times won't last forever. HMO's, banks, media 
companies, even manufacturers are gobbling up one another in an orgy of 
unbridled capitalism. Every day we have a little less control over our 
lives than we did the day before. BULWORTH could have been a warning 
sign, a harbinger of doom or a prophetic look at the abyss of the 21st 
century. It settled for being just a decent little film which, while 
enjoyable, will ultimately have no impact. Oh well - at least I can 
amuse my friends at parties with my new vulgar slang terms.

Ingredients: 
Completely honest Senator who says: "If you don't put down that malt
liquor and chicken wings and get behind somebody other than a running
back who stabs his wife, you're never going to get rid of somebody like
me."
Synopsis: 
In this sharp and hilarious comedy which combines madcap farce with
stinging political commentary, old Senator Jay Billington Bulworth
(Warren Beatty) is a pitiful, corrupted former 60s idealist who 'sold
out' to rich special interests, and as a result is engulfed in moral
guilt, shame, sadness and depression. On TV the smiling senator is
ostensibly running a successful re-election campaign, but actually he is
on the verge of a suicidal mental breakdown. After taking his last 10
million dollar insurance bribe, Bulworth arranges to hire an anonymous
contract killer and contracts a hit on himself, to take place sometime
within the next three days. 
To his surprise, Bulworth suddenly finds out that - - now that nothing
matters - - he's at last free to be perfectly honest and candid. He can
say what he actually feels about his job, the American political
process, and real life in America. Elated, Bulworth decides to cancel
his assassination, but to his dismay, he finds out he's unable to get in
contact with the hit man in order to cancel the hit. 
Thus begins the outrageous, loony and slightly paranoid behavior of a
completely honest, politically incorrect senator. For example, Bulworth
tells poor churchgoers that they are little more than photo
opportunities for politicians. When voters accuse him of past misdeeds,
he asks, "Isn't that obvious?"He tells rich movie producers that they
are bilking the American public with greedy, worthless, schlock movies.
Bulworth goes to south central LA and learns to rap, then takes up
wearing a knit cap and baggy shorts and begins to deliver his speeches
in rhymes. 
As Bulworth's unorthodox ravings progress, he tackles life with
increasingly fearless, unrepentant abandon. Refusing to sleep, Bulworth
becomes the incandescent symbol of the discontented average American; as
a result, the American public jumps to his support. He also romances a
mysterious beautiful woman named Nina (Halle Berry).
What will happen to the romance, the campaign, and the hit contract? 
The reason why I say it's a gutsy film is because there will no doubt be
sensitive people who will want to take this movie too seriously. As the
Bulworth character  is completely nuts, outrageously irreverent, and
makes a target of the entire political spectrum, there are bound to be
folks who take offense to the farcical senator's delirious speeches.  
The reason why I say it's hilarious is because BULWORTH is meant to
provide farcical entertainment. Why else would the unshaven senator be
dressed in hip-hop clothing and spouting raps to a grooving soundtrack? 
I highly recommend this film to anybody. You may like it, or you may
hate it, but I guarantee it will not leave you indifferent.

BULWORTH
(20th Century Fox)
Starring:  Warren Beatty, Halle Berry, Oliver Platt, Don Cheadle.
Screenplay:  Warren Beatty and Jeremy Pikser.
Producers:  Warren Beatty and Pieter Brugge.
Director:  Warren Beatty.
MPAA Rating:  R (profanity, drug use, some violence, adult themes)
Running Time:  107 minutes.
Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.
     Here's a comic premise with all the potential in the world:  a man in
a career where lying is part of the job description becomes disgusted with
his own life.  He has a breakdown, and as part of that breakdown he starts
telling the truth, the outrageous and unexpurgated truth, consequences be
damned.  Naturally, the public responds to this unusual display of candor,
and the teller of the truth becomes a sort of folk hero, much to the
consternation of corporate America.
     That's the basic premise of a 1990 comedy called CRAZY PEOPLE, in
which Dudley Moore plays an advertising executive who snaps his cap and
starts turning out product slogans like "Volvo -- They're boxy, but
they're good."  It's also the premise of BULWORTH, in which Warren Beatty
plays a Democratic Senator from California named Jay Billington Bulworth
who snaps his cap during a re-election campaign and starts making colorful
statements about his constituents in the African-American and film-making
communities, among others.  With three days left before the California
primary, a CNBC news crew following his every move and his Chief of Staff
(Oliver Platt) watching in helpless horror, Bulworth decides to go out in
a blaze of honesty after taking out a contract on his own life.
     CRAZY PEOPLE was less than completely successful because it didn't
have a shred of story to offer once you got past the admittedly hilarious
snippets of truth in advertising.  BULWORTH is less than completely
successful because it has _too much_ story, none of it in keeping with the
frivolous, politically incorrect tone of its trailers.  It turns out that
Jay Bulworth is a crushed idealist, a one-time activist turned mainstream
party drone.  Beatty crafts a solid opening as we see Bulworth reduced to
tears while watching a videotaped compendium of his television spots
bashing affirmative action, preaching family falues and mouthing
platitudes about "standing on the doorstep of a new millennium."  Though
he launches his uncensored commentary from a suicidal indifference to the
future, he finds himself re-energized by speaking from his true
principles, eventually trying to end the contract on his life so he can
continue delivering his message.
     It's a dark and provocative tale, one which could easily turn off
viewers who come in expecting something completely different.  Beatty uses
BULWORTH as a soapbox for old-school Democratic ideology, criticizing the
influence of big business and promoting single-payer health care.  Though
he deftly inserts most of his social commentary into rap-style lyrics --
somehow a rapped lecture sounds less like a lecture -- it's still an
aggressive attack on the Powers That Be as Beatty sees them.  Add to this
a tentative romance between Bulworth and a young black woman (Halle
Berry), the intrusion of the hit-man sub-plot and even a bit of
fish-out-of-water comedy as Bulworth hides out in the 'hood, and you end
up with a film that's more jittery than edgy.  BULWORTH keeps lashing out
in search of its tone -- one moment goofy and irreverent, the next moment
grim and pedantic.
     There's nothing inherently wrong with a comedy delivering its goods
unconventionally, provided the goods are delivered.  There are plenty of
comic high points in BULWORTH, including Platt's superb performance as
Bulworth's ever-more-frantic right hand man and the shoot-from-the-hip
speeches already showcased in previews.  But there's also a sense that
Beatty wants to lure people in with comedy so he can hit them over the
head with his politics.  Even if you agree with those politics, you may
find BULWORTH leaving a strange and unpleasant aftertaste; you'll know
you've seen an interesting film, but you may feel cheated by the kind of
film you got.  I suspect viewers will wish they'd seen more of Bulworth's
comic rantings.  Perhaps this ad campaign could have used a dose of CRAZY
PEOPLE's truth in advertising.

Bob the Happy Bastard's Quickie Review
An honest politician?  Could it be?  That's the case with Bulworth, the
latest film from actor/director Warren Beatty, who does a complete
flipside of the ego he created in the flashy comic book caper Dick
Tracy.  This time around, he's a politician who's become so depressed
with his image and life, he chooses to hire a hitman to kill him to get
insurance money to his daughter.  Then, by a stroke of genius, he
chooses to be absolutely honest.  After all, what's the worse thing the
public can do- kill him?
The movie unfolds over a final weekend of desperate campaigning, with
Bulworth making several stops with his campaign advisor (a hilarious
Oliver Platt) and a particular female (Halle Berry) who has caught his
eye.  Soon, his honesty, as abruptious as it is with particular power
players, becomes a hot item, and Bulworth scrambles to cancel the
assassination he so dearly ordered for himself.
It's hard to label Bulworth as a straight comedy.  It's absolutely
hilarious in some parts, but it's also a fascinating political piece of
sorts, with a little bit of drama thrown in.  I guess you could
officially call it a political dramedy, if such a thing exists.
Beatty is great as the beguiled Senator, presenting some surprisingly
good antics that involve "rhyming" (rapping, but on his terms) and
mixmastering sexual references on the DJ table.  He also presents a very
believable role of a man who's been taken to the breaking point with the
fake world he's created around him, and it's like he's picked up a
hammer and begun shattering at its flacid shell.
Platt, again, is very funny as the advisor who just plain loses it as he
can't figure out just what his Senator is doing.  Halle Berry also
supplies ample work as a girl from South Central who's smarter than she
looks.
Beatty directs with a good amount of energy, matching the efforts
presented in an earlier political comedy, Bob Roberts.  It's not a
relaxed pace, but one that you can certainly feel comfortable with.
Some parts of the movie did sag a bit slightly, but, fortunately, the
whole is an important piece that talks about how much honesty has been
lost in politics while, at the same time, giving you something to laugh
and think about at the same time.  Will it change the world?  No.  Is it
one of Beatty's finest works to date?  Yep.  It's just a riot to see him
in a get-up that's reminiscent of one of the Fat Albert kids...

Bulworth (1998) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Warren Beatty and Halle Berry.
Directed by Beatty
 Jay Billington Bulworth, incumbent Democratic senator from California, is
slowly losing his mind. Sitting in his Washington office late one night, he
continually watches a loop of a campaign ad in which he is spouting some
drivel about entering "the new millennium."
 He watches the tape over and over, not saying a word.
 Later, he meets with a powerful lobbyist for the insurance industry who,
in exchange for Bulworth's word to kill some anti-insurance legislation in
committee, gives the senator a life insurance policy worth $10 million,
naming Bulworth's daughter the beneficiary.
 Bulworth next meets with a shady character who arranges "research
projects." The senator's requests that the subject of an upcoming weekend
project in California be himself.
 Thus, the senator and his advisers set off for California for the final
weekend of his 1996 primary campaign.
 This is the beginning of Bulworth, Warren Beatty's newest film.
 The actor-writer-director-producer has long been a political activist, a
Democratic Party favorite. But in Bulworth, the actor takes no prisoners.
No one is spared, not Democrats, Republicans, the media nor even Beatty's
own glamorous image.
 In California, feeling liberated because of the arrangement he made,
Bulworth speaks to a group of inner-city black constituents at a church. He
tells them the truth: they are poor, so they have no power base.
Politicians just tell them what they want to hear, make them empty
promises, then go about their business of shilling for lobbyists who give
them millions for their campaigns.
 His advisers, of course, are aghast. Is this a new political strategy,
they wonder? But instead of confiding in them, Bulworth merely reassures
them that he has everything under control. Meanwhile, he hooks up with a
trio of young black women who take him to an all-night club where he learns
the joys and intricacies of rapping.
 His next stop is a fund-raiser hosted by movie industry moguls. Bulworth
manages not only to insult the big shots by belittling their product, but
his Jewish contributors as well.
 While all this is going on, Bulworth also has a sudden change of heart and
tries to cancel the contract for the "weekend research project."
 Bulworth is Beatty's most audacious and subversive movie. It is an attack
on the hyprocisy and shallowness of our political system. It is more
strident than Wag the Dog and more critical of the political process than
Primary Colors.
 Yet Bulworth also has a condescending and patronizing aroma, an air of
'60s liberalism in which it was chic to invite a Black Panther to your New
York penthouse or Beverly Hills mansion for a cocktail fund-raiser to
demonstrate your support for the cause as well as ease your conscience.
 There is no question about Beatty's sincerity. He has been a political
activist for many years, and is one of the few actors who is willing to use
his films as a soapbox for his beliefs. His outrage at what has become of
our political system literally screams from the screen.
 His approach in Bulworth, though, seems at times naive. After hearing
Bulworth's profane tirade about race during a televised interview, a local
drug kingpin decides to become a community activist. That is too
unbelievable and Capraesque.
 No doubt after viewing the film, some blacks may accuse Beatty of
perpetrating the very racial stereotypes he is trying so hard to disparage.
His depiction of a gangsta' lifestyle looks like sequences cribbed from
various rap videos.
 A saving grace is Beatty's total lack of vanity. He is one actor not
afraid to allow himself to look foolish, whether it be walking around
through most of the first part of the film with a big cocktail sauce stain
on his shirt, or dressed in hip-hop garb, complete with sunglasses, in the
film's second half.
 The growing relationship between the older senator and a 26-year-old black
woman, a smart, swaggering, but vulnerable performance by the lovely Halle
Berry, touches more on Hollywood tradition than real life.
 A deft comic performance is given by Oliver Platt as Murphy, the senator's
top aide who grows more and more frustrated and confused as he watches what
he believes to be his boss's self-destruction. Platt has a wonderful sense
of timing, knowing what scenes to downplay and when to overact.
 Bulworth's ending is a bit of a cop-out, yet it is the only avenue Beatty,
who co-authored the script with Jeremy Pikser, can traverse for its
demented, but enlightened, hero.
 Bulworth may offend or shock some people. Others will find it highly
amusing. Like politics, it is a movie that will be hotly debated.

Running Time: 107 minutes
Bulworth is one of those films with great potential which it never
manages to capitalize on.  It's a brilliant idea that's destroyed by
sloppiness and an awful final 10 minutes.
Beatty plays U.S. Senator Jay Bulworth, seeking re-election in 1996.
As the film opens we see Bulworth in his office over a couple of days,
first watching his own TV commercials over and over again, and then
just flipping around from channel to channel.  We learn that he hasn't
eaten or slept in days.  He's just lost a fortune in investments.
He's just taken out a ten million dollar insurance policy on his life.
And he's just hired a hit man to kill him within the next three days.
He goes to give a speech at a black church.  Instead of giving his
normal speech, he decides to start talking the truth.  For example,
when asked why he hasn't made good on campaign promises, he tells the
crowd that it's because they haven't given any money to his campaign.
This continues for the rest of the film, as Beatty goes around rapping
about the "truths" of politics.  Yes, you read that right, most of his
dialogue from that point on is in rhyme.
Now all this would normally be fine and dandy.  The plot seems to me
to be a can't miss situation for comedy.  And it does have it's share
of laughs (a particularly funny moment has Bulworth stealing a
hoodlum's car and then the car's hydraulics go berserk).  But first of
all, all of the good moments in the film are in the trailers.  All of
the highlights of Bulworth's truth speeches you've probably already
seen.  Then, the majority of the comedy just boils down to an old
white guy dealing with young black people and suddenly acting just
like them.  There's nothing more to it than that.  It had such
promising potential.
We're supposed to think that Bulworth feels bad about his political
career, that maybe once he entered politics to help people but got
swept up into the system and lost his way.  This is obviously what
Beatty wants us to think about Bulworth.  It's not how it comes across
to me however.  The point just isn't expressed very well.  The way I
see it, Bulworth hasn't eaten or slept in days and just snaps, as
anyone probably would.
I was really looking forward to Bulworth this summer.  Sadly, the truth
about Bulworth is that it just doesn't come together. [R]

   It's one of those stories where you're out late walking through a bad
neighborhood, back alley, empty parking garage or seedy bar,
etc.,you know you shouldn't have been in in the first place...
    At one point or another almost all of my friends have related their
own personal wrong place/wrong time' adventure(s) to me. Less
than half but more than a couple of these stories have a similar plot
thread: The highest point of anxiety was when the person was
approached by a big black guy.  Now, what you can't pick up from reading
this is the intonation used on the words "big BLACK
guy". It's almost a verbal wink which suggests that the extra fear is so
universal that even I, being black myself, should understand
and sympathize.
    *Sigh*
    I don't blame my friends or even bother to get annoyed by this
anymore. These are intelligent, liberal-minded people who are as
susceptible as the rest of us to the negative images bombarding us
everyday. Not so much from anything as blatant as the news but
from many more harmless' forms of entertainment that access our
subconscious regularly.
    Take for example the much beloved sitcom CHEERS. It was certainly MY
favorite show when it was on. During it's eleven year
run CHEERS managed to have only one black character...for all of two
episodes. He was Louis:  a BIG, black, lazy and incompetent
mailman (oxymoron?) with a deep voice and a violent streak. The two
episodes (which were both very funny) centered around Cliff
running around scared that Louis was going to beat him up for getting
him fired. Now, I don't think that CHEERS is evil or that there's
anything inherently wrong with Louis', except for the ratio. In eleven
years(!!) on America's most popular tv show there was not one
other black person  to contrast him with,  thus he added to the already
growing stereotype.
    I could site hundreds of more examples but what would be the point,
really? Neither of us wants me to suit up and fight every
dragon out there. I  mostly try to stay out of it...Still, sometimes a
man's gotta do what a man's gotta do...
 ...BULWORTH is the story of conservative Democratic senator, J.
Bulworth (Warren Beatty), who suffers a nervous breakdown and
begins publically telling the bitter ugly truth about what goes on
behind the scenes in American politics, much to the chagrin of his
staff and the establishment...he's also taken out a $10 million policy
with the insurance lobby, put out a contract on himself and yadda,
yadda, yadda..."hilarity ensues".
   The political moments of BULWORTH are inspired and biting in their
candor. What's more shocking than what Warren Beatty says
is that he's allowed to say it. For example, when addressing the
congregation of a black church J.Bulworth is asked why he hasn't
fulfilled his promises to minority voters and his response is "Well, you
haven't contributed any money to my campaign, have you?". He
goes on to explain that the insurance and tobacco lobbies DO finance the
very expensive campaign he needs to stay in office which
puts him pretty much in their pocket. In fact, he implicates Clinton,
Bush and all politicians as being caught up in the standard S.O.B.
corruption of the machine. Okay, so if you listen to NPR or Pacifica
News everyday the movie just confirms what you've already
pieced together.
   BULWORTH spares almost no one and some of these moments are genius
(if you consider telling the truth genius'). In one scene
Halle Berry's character gives a valid explanation as to why there are no
definitive black leaders these days...Unfortunately, she spews it
as if she were auditioning for a MicroMachines commercial...AND it's the
only intelligent dialogue to come out of a black characters
mouth in the entire movie.
     The film is most successful when J.Bulworth is kicking the
knowledge', but the other 80% is banal and insulting- and not in the
way you might think.  J.Bulworth is no more offensive than Melvin Udall
(AS GOOD AS IT GETS) or Archie Bunker, both who I
loved. BULWORTH is extremely insulting in it's portrayal of black
people. It's as if everything Warren Beatty (who also wrote and
directed this) knows about black people he learned from repeated
viewings of HIGH SCHOOL HIGH and the WB Network sitcoms.
When J.Bulworth has his breakdown he becomes infatuated with Nina (Halle
Berry) and spends alot of time in the hood. There's
ALOT of black people in this movie, yet none of them speak or act
realistically like anyone I've ever met. More to the point, they're all
idiots. They made ME want to cut social programs.
    But not everybody's gonna feel the way I do, you may not care about
anything I've said so far. Maybe watching the WB and UPN
networks is as multicultural as you want to get. Say you just picked up
a new frame for your NRA certificate and a signed, limited
edition, hardcover copy of The Bell Curve and you're feeling pretty
stoked that the Nazi party is starting to reform in
Germany...Guess, what: The movie still stinks!
    BULWORTH forgets more of its inane plot lines than it remembers. The
humor is all slapstick and fish out of water' setups (Okay,
"the rich white guy is hangin' with the homeys." We get it!). It's and
endless string of "White men can't rap" jokes played to the hilt.
So much so that they start to ruin some of the good scenes. Even if you
can't get enough of that, it has an ending that I guarantee no
one- I repeat, NO ONE will like.
     I really wanted to like BULWORTH, too. I think it had the potential
to be a very important film, but alas, it is a celluloid train
wreck. The shoddiness would be understandable if it'd been made by a
first-time or music video director, but this is
Warren-freaking-Beatty we're talking about here!  He's been making
movies since 1961 and won a Oscar for REDS, which he also
wrote and directed.  For every brilliant scene in BULWORTH that makes me
want everybody to see this movie there are four or five
that make me blanche at the idea that anybody will ever see it...
...And you don't want to see a black man blanche.
  It's scarier than having him ask you for directions on a dark street.

After a longer than usual absence from the big screen, Warren Beatty has
returned in a chancy political comedy.  And while it's not bad when he's
aiming for laughs, the movie switches gears halfway through, attempting
to be an earnest political drama...a move that just doesn't fly.
California Senator Jay Billingston Bulworth (Warren Beatty) is suffering
a nervous breakdown during the last weekend before the Democratic
primary.  He has lost the idealism of his youth, and is jaded by the
flood of politically correct sound bytes which monopolize his life.  His
depression gets deep enough that he hires a hitman to assassinate him
before the primary.
His final weekend is a liberating one for him.  No future means no
political repercussions, and Senator Bulworth decides to finally speak
his mind.  No topic is safe as he bluntly expresses his filter-free
views on race relations, socialism, the entertainment industry, and
corporate campaign contributions.
At this point, the movie is on a roll...and at this point, it falters.
Rather than sticking with the funny concept of a politician finally
speaking his mind, the film gets high minded, and he begins speaking the
"truth" (or at least Warren Beatty's version of it).  By the time the
film trots out the eternally wise homeless man (Amiri Baraka) and the
soft-hearted drug dealer (Don Cheadle), you know it's gone down the
wrong path.
Until then, the film does have several good barbs, and Beatty gives a
mostly amusing performance.  This time around, he takes a
"warts-and-all" approach to filmmaking (obviously sensitive to the soft
lighting criticisms he received for Love Affair).  However, he still
can't resist placing a romantic angle in this unromantic film.  This
time around, Halle Berry plays his love interest, a campaign volunteer
with an agenda of her own, in a subplot that just doesn't float with the
rest of the movie.
Even though the romance doesn't quite fit, Berry does a decent job with
her role.  As do most of the supporting cast, including talents such as
Paul Sorvino, Jack Warden and Isaiah Washington.  However, the standout
here is Oliver Platt, as Bulworth's frazzled campaign manager, trying to
make some sort of sense of his boss' new enlightenment.
For a political comedy to work, it either needs to forswear any
political message, or at least make it subservient to the humor.
Bulworth doesn't follow this advice (or not for long, anyway), and
crashes and burns just when it should be hitting new heights.

   Politicians have about as much public trust as used car
salesmen.  They lie, cheat, steal and speak in platitudes. 
They commit adultery, but that's not so bad.  What's worse is
that they get into bed with wealthy corporations, yet wind up
screwing the poor and the middle class.  If you don't believe
that, you probably also had faith in the guy who said, "Read
my lips: no new taxes."  What would happen, though, if a
public official actually told the truth about everything?  Would
he last more than a month in office?  According to the movie
"Bulworth," the answer to the last question is, "Yes and no."
This sharp, sometimes intelligent and always stimulating
picture, produced, directed, co-written and starring Warren
Beatty, deals with what happens when a high public
official--like Jim Carrey's character Fletcher Reed--simply
cannot lie.  No way is he like that hair-care manufacturer who
contended some time ago that "If you have only one life, live
it as a blonde."  Among the points hammered home in
"Bulworth" is the notion that black people have more fun. 
"Bulworth" is about a politician who doesn't just talk a good
game: he really gives a rap.
   If campaign rhetoric has ever tempted you to reach for
Prozac, you'll understand what the title character is going
through during his bid for re-election as U.S. senator from
California.  Depressed to the point of suicide after repeating
the bromide, "We stand at the doorstep of a new millennium"
for the thousandth time, Senator Jay Bulworth (Warren
Beatty) cuts a deal with two shady characters.  Agreeing to
bottle in committee a bill which would force insurance
companies to issue policies to ghetto residents, he pressures
lobbyist Crockett (Paul Sorvino) into writing him a ten million
dollar life insurance policy to provide for his family upon his
demise.  He then contracts with hit man Vinnie (Richard Scott
Sarafian) to target himself, in effect committing suicide with
the appearance of murder.  When he meets and becomes
smitten with a young black woman, Nina (Halle Berry), his
depression lifts.  Having stood at the doorstep of his own
extinction, he shucks off his old, corrupt self and determines
to tell it like it is.  After this point, "Bulworth" divides into two
stories: one, the senator's caustic and brutally honest
discourses about the nature of American society; the other, a
madcap series of adventures planting the politician deep into
the world of a black urban ghetto.  The first concept succeeds
so well that you wish Beatty could sustain its tone throughout
the story.  The second, likely to appeal to the younger set in
the audience, veers unfortunately into the well-worn
categories of car chases, farcical assassination plots, and
excess.  If the movie could have sustained the comic,
insightful repartee which made its trailer the most enticing
advertisement of the year, "Bulworth" could have been a
modern masterwork of political debunking.
   With this in mind, you may agree that the scenes that work
best are those which display Bulworth engaging his
voters with politically incorrect thought.  Meeting
constituents in a black church packed with supporters of his
party, Bulworth is confronted by an angry woman who
suggests that the Democratic Party doesn't care about the
African-American community.  Rather than soothe the voter,
he retorts, "Isn't that obvious?"  He suggests that the voters
are stuck with him for the next six years anyway since they're
not about to vote Republican; that they will never get
anywhere if their chief interests are eating chicken wings,
drinking malt liquor, and supporting a former running back
who stabbed his wife.  Pressed to explain what happened to
the development funds that the senator promised to funnel to
the community, Bulworth responds truthfully enough that he
forgot about the promise, "But then you haven't contributed to
my campaign, have you?"  In yet another repudiation of
political correctness, he meets a group of Hollywood
filmmakers and, in a master-stroke of self-denigrating humor
about the movie industry tells them, "Most of your films are
not very good.  You must be doing it for the money.  You turn
everything to crap."  He also reports to the aghast, mostly
Jewish congregation that "my guys aren't stupid: they always
put the big Jews on the committees."
   The movie is not as successful when it abandons verbal wit
and turns to madcap burlesque.  Vittorio Stararo's camera
frequently turns to an assassin in dark shades, a caricature
who simply appears from time to time on the orders of his silly
mob boss, Vinnie.  Beatty provides us as well with a
stereotypical bunch of teens toting guns in their decaying
neighborhood, gang members who are more like the giddy
dead-end kids of Lyle Kessler's "Orphans" than like the scary
youth of the Hughes brothers' "Dead Presidents."  Even here,
however, Beatty provides us with a three-dimensional role by
Don Cheadle as L.D., a drug lord who employs kids because
they can carry out his demands without the legal
accountability of adults (just like politicians, who play fast with
other people's money). When Halle Berry in the role of
Bulworth's inspiring new girl friend, is not simply displayed
with a cryptic expression on her captivating face, she has
a believable sexual chemistry with a man who is of a different
race and old enough to be her grandfather.  As Murphy, the
senator's chief of staff, Oliver Platt makes up for his
miscasting as Maffio in Marshall Hershkovitz's "Dangerous
Beauty,"  in an engaging turn as the senator's foil who finds
his boss's new lifestyle  contagious.   Also surprisingly
effective in a smaller role is black militant playwright Amiri
Baraka in the part of a homeless man who stands for the
conscience of America, calling ultimately for a new spirit to
embrace the land.
   The movie has a pulsating rap score , including a smart
rendition by Beatty of an extended lyric which satirizes the
right-wing strain in American politics. Beatty looks so good
that when Halle Berry estimated the man's age as 60,
members of the audience gasped at the absurdity.  Yet this
gifted performer, born in March 1937, is evidence that a keen
mind focused on a productive career can indeed keep a
seasoned person looking fresh. Rated R.  109 min.
