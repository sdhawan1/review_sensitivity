A solid action thriller directed by Alfred Hitchcock. But it has many
plot flaws and suffers from poor pacing and can best be perceived as a
precursor to his much improved other 'framed innocent man pic,' North by
Northwest. Saboteur is still a solid work, but its excitement comes by
way of some odd scenes: the innocent man on the run getting a truck ride
from a travelling caravan of circus freaks, when Robert Cummings and
Priscilla Lane are trapped in a Park Avenue charity ball and try various
means of escaping, at a shootout in Radio City Music Hall, and in the
battle between the hero and the sleazy Nazi agent atop the Statue of
Liberty.
The wartime film begins with Barry Kane (Cummings) working at a Los
Angeles aircraft plant and becoming the framed victim of a saboteur,
Frank Fry (Norman Lloyd). During a fire, Fry hands him a fire
extinguisher with chemicals that sets the factory ablaze and kills his
best friend. The cops have no record of Fry working at the plant and
blame Kane for the plant's destruction. He decides to go on the run and
get the Nazi spy ring before they do any more damage, figuring it would
take the cops too long to figure out he's innocent.
He remembers seeing an envelope Fry dropped addressed to a Deep Springs
Ranch, and hitches a ride with a friendly trucker (Murray Alper) to get
there. At the ranch he meets the suave Nazi spy ring boss Charles Tobin
(Otto Kruger), who is above-suspicion and respected in his small-town
for his wealth and generosity. Tobin calls the cops on him and has him
arrested, but Kane escapes and flees while still handcuffed, coming to
the remote home of a wise blind man Phillip Martin (Vaughan Glaser).
Phillip can sense that Kane is an innocent man and when his attractive
blonde niece, Pat Martin (Lane), a recognized billboard model, arrives
from NYC, he tells her to take Kane to a blacksmith to get the cuffs
off.
Pat is repelled by what she thinks Barry did and tries to take him to
the police station instead, but he thwarts her efforts and tries to tell
her he must get to Soda City, a place he noticed on a telegram Fry sent
to Tobin. She is now not sure if he's guilty, but only goes with him
when he threatens to abandon her to the snakes on the isolated desert
road. Luckily, while on the deserted road, they come across a circus
caravan and are allowed to stay, as the circus freaks vote narrowly in
favor of not turning him over to the cops.
They find Soda City to be a ghost town, but soon two Nazi agents show
their faces, the old prospector who is now the one storing materials for
the Nazi ring, Neilson (Clem Bevans), and the Nazi agent from New York
Freeman (Baxter). Barry rides back to New York with Freeman while Pat
goes to the local sheriff, but she soon finds out that he works for
Tobin and turns her over to him. When Barry arrives in NYC, he is taken
to the luxurious townhouse of philantropist Henrietta Van Sutton (Alma
Kruger), who is throwing a charity ball. Tobin appears there and tells
him he and Pat are their prisoners, and if he tried to say anything to
the guests they wouldn't believe a word he said. The film looks a lot
like "The 39 Steps" at this point, as Barry tries to tell Sutton's
unsuspecting upper-class guests that this is a house harboring Nazi
spies, but no one doubts the rich socialite.
Barry somehow escapes from the townhouse, gets to the Brooklyn Navy Yard
to prevent the next act of sabotage, meets with the police to clear his
name, as Pat tails Fry to the Statue of Liberty. The film draws to an
action conclusion, with Barry and Fry mixing it up on the Statue. Barry
and Pat have in the meantime fallen in love.
The film can be forgiven for its many patriotic speeches extolling the
virtues of America, since there was a war taking place. But it can't be
forgiven for how shoddy the story line was and how you can just about
challenge every scene in this film as being fake. When the Nazi ring
gets Cummings in NYC, there's no way they would handle him so casually,
making his escape seem so easy, as they didn't even tie him up. When
taken to NYC by Baxter, a call would have been placed to Kruger exposing
Cummings, which for some unexplained reason wasn't done. It also seemed
hard to believe that a blind man and a truck driver would help a
fugitive escape without knowing anything about the situation. The other
major flaw was that Cummings and Lane were much too bland to give this
story personality. Hitch's first choices of Gary Cooper and Barbara
Stanwyck would have made the film that much more charismatic, though
Cummings and Lane were not that bad as much as they were colorless.

"Saboteur" is not one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films,
but it is a good film despite all its problems.
The plot lacks credibility at times, and the acting
is surprisingly hammy.  However, the story is exciting,
and there is some fine cinematography.
The plot has a young man (Robert Cummings) falsely
accused of blowing up a factory.  He eludes the police
while searching for the real saboteur (Norman Lloyd) 
to prove his innocence.  He uncovers a major network
of saboteurs, headed by wealthy and respected members
of society.  Will Cummings escape these agents?  Will
the police believe his story?  Will the saboteurs
succeed in their evil plans?  Will Cummings win the
heart of pouty love interest Priscilla Lane?
Cummings was not Hitchcock's first choice.  They would
work together again in "Dial M for Murder", so
Hitchcock must have been pleased with his acting.
Certainly Cummings is likeable, and probably it is
the fault of the script, but he delivers multiple
fiery patriotic speeches that become jingoistic.
His character also commits many crimes in order
to prove his innocence (kidnapping, stealing a horse,
escape, resisting arrest, etc), an oxymoron that
is shared by similar films such as "The Fugitive".
There may be some spoilers in the following paragraphs.
I had complaints with other characters as well.
Cummings encounters a truck driver and a blind man who
are willing to break the law to help a fugitive from
justice whom they have just met.  Lane, who has the world's
biggest lips, is kidnapped by Cummings when she attempts
to turn him in.  Initially she despises him and thinks
him guilty.  For no apparent reason, she suddenly changes
her mind and does all she can for him.  When the evil
saboteurs finally catch them, they fail to kill them
or even physically restrain them.  These are the same
people who plot to blow up ships and dams?
Cummings plays Superman in the final scenes of the movie.
He manages to escape, guesses the next sabotage act
correctly, manages to prevent it, tells all to the police,
who believe and release him despite his status as
America's Most Wanted.  He then finds the saboteur,
and nearly kills himself while trying to save the
saboteur's life.  All in a day's work, I suppose.
But "Saboteur" is still a good movie.  It is exciting
and loaded with action and (albeit heavy-handed) drama.
The cinematography is occasionally outstanding, with
great shots of the ship launch, the Statue of Liberty,
a ritzy party, city skyscrapers, and of course, the 
famous scene of the saboteur falling.

In SABOTEUR, Alfred Hitchcock was warming up for his later masterworks such 
as NORTH BY NORTHWEST.  Not that SABOTEUR cannot stand by itself as the work 
of an expert.  It's just that the pacing is a little off, and the story asks 
us to suspend our disbelief a few too many times.
Robert Cummings is a very competent hero.  In some scenes in this film, he 
comes close to the nonchalance that James Stewart brought to many Hitchcock 
works.  Of course a problem for modern viewers may be this nonchalance.  
Because the era that bred SABOTEUR featured low-key performances, modern 
audiences may succumb to the ever-present boredom caused by anything without 
a frenetic pace or overwrought acting.  Cummings does not play Barry Kane 
with an emotional bent fashioned by some method-acting ranter; rather, he 
skips from problem to problem with typical mid-century stoicism.  What needs 
to be done will be done, one can imagine Cummings saying in an interview.
The premise of the film surfaces in many Hitchcock films.  An innocent man  
Barry Kane --  is accused of setting a fire to a factory that produces 
aircraft for the American war effort.  What's worse, he's thought to have 
handed his best buddy an extinguisher filled with gasoline.  The buddy 
perishes.  What's the rub?  A mysterious character named Fry (Norman Lloyd) 
is the actual saboteur, but only Kane and his dead friend had contact with 
this nasty, fox-like man.  Soon Kane is on the lam from the law.  As in THE 
FUGITIVE, Kane compounds his legal troubles by escaping: he must be so 
thoroughly convinced that he will take the rap for this heinous crime of 
sabotage, treason and murder, that he determines to set off on his own to 
find Fry and anyone backing him.
On the way, Kane finds refuge in the house of a blind man  who cannot see 
Kane's handcuffs but somehow senses everything.  This man's niece soon 
enters, and though her uncle instructs her to accompany Kane to a 
locksmith's to remove the cuffs, she (Priscilla Lane as Patricia Martin).  
Kane adds kidnapping to his legion of infractions, apparently trusting that 
everything will turn out in the end.  (Of course, part of Hitchcock's genius 
was in getting everything to turn out satisfactorily for his audiences; he 
certainly knew what viewers of his time demanded.)   More complications 
ensue, and we spot countless Hitchcockian trademarks  wealthy and respected 
criminal masterminds, ingenues in jeopardy, American icons used to support 
suspenseful plot twists.
I think part of the contrived feeling of the plot is the artifice used to 
set up some of the climactic situations.  Exactly why would a saboteur tour 
the Statue of Liberty after he has damaged an American warship as it 
launched?  Would anyone but a 40's film heroine endanger herself by trying 
to delay or trap this ruthless criminal, and would anyone but the hero try 
to save this selfsame criminal as he hangs from the hand of Lady Liberty?  
These people are apparently moral to the core.  A minor and interesting 
agenda involves a further boost to the common man: a truck driver who gives 
Kane a ride early in his flight from justice surfaces later to assist him in 
escaping from the very clutches of the cops.  It's almost as if Hitchcock is 
cheering the proletariat, while the monied ne'er-do-wells scheme and plot 
for the downfall of the war effort, and perhaps even control of the country. 
  (There are definite undercurrents here that attack fascism)
Nevertheless, we see some stunning camera work and memorable images.  
Everything Hitchcock touched was in some way artificial, from the California 
mountains to the massive statue at the end  painted backdrops within 
studios, or smaller-than-life models. But the use this director makes of his 
props is amazing.
Perhaps the pace of the film could be tighter in scenes, but every scene 
does seem necessary.  There is even some top-notch comic relief  coming 
mostly when Kane and Martin are saved from a police search by a caravan full 
of circus performers.
Pricilla Lane does a very smooth job as Patricia Martin, the headstrong 
niece of an eminently decent blind man.  A pity she did not get more roles: 
her acting talents might have made her a household name.
For fans of Hitchcock, SABOTEUR is a must-see.  It clearly foreshadows his 
later successes with big names like Cary Grant and James Stewart and Doris 
Day.  And the changes of scenery show that he was a filmmaker on the move, 
unafraid to use location shots mixed with rear projection and studio 
fakeries.
