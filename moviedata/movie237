Someone must have thought this was a good idea: Take half a dozen inner
city kidlets, have one of 'em accidentally shoot a cop and then hold
said wounded Officer hostage while they make demands for better school
conditions and bond as human beings.
I guess if you come from a place where your mindset is that the police
are the enemy, regardless of guilt or innocence or accident or
deliberate intention, then this thing will make sense to you. Cranky
doesn't come from that place.
The High School is in Queens, New York. The area holds a full run of
races and the school itself is far beyond habitable. No heat. Broken
windows in the middle of winter. No new textbooks. A veritable
educational hell on earth. When the one teacher who gives a damn (Judd
Nelson) is pushed to the limit he takes his class off campus, to a warm
diner, 'cuz every other habitable extra-curricular area in the school is
already full. This action, thanks to a plot device we won't tell, gets
the man suspended. The students stage a protest in the principal's
office (Glenn Turman as the stressed out principal, more concerned with
appearance and his forthcoming pension) and when the on campus cop is
called in to break the protest up an incomprehensible set of
circumstances leads one of the kids to shoot the cop (Forest Whitaker).
What makes the circumstances incomprehensible is properly explained down
the line. What makes it impossible for me to be sympathetic, even to
suspend any kind of belief system for 90 minutes, is that in a hall full
of witnesses, an accidental shooting is just that. That five of the six
kidlets can look at a wounded cop and decided that he isn't hurt so bad
is beyond me. The decision to hold the cop hostage so that the kidlets
can make demands for improvements in the school might make sense if you
can buy into the thought processes, but I can't.
The six kidlets: a sports star (Usher Raymond), a hustler (Clifton
Collins Jr.), a gangsta (Fredro Starr), a artist (Robert Ri'Chard), a
smart girl on the Student Council (Rosario Dawson), and a pregnant white
kid with attitude (Sara Gilbert). Vanessa L. Williams plays the
negotiator who is, ultimately, helpless and the film moves towards the
inevitable.
Those that survive get happy endings. Those of us who sat through a
preview of Light It Up stared at the screen wondering how the hell we
were going to write this thing up without sounding racist. From an
analytical point of view, writer/ director Craig Bolotin follows the
path it sets out for itself. Some of the dialog is awful. All of the
characters fill some sort of stereotype.
The idea that our society has reached a point where this kind of story
idea is possible makes me want to scream. You can argue that Light It Up
brings up issues. I'll argue back that it promotes an absolutely
despicable treatment of human beings.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Light It up, he would have paid...

LIGHT IT UP smolders and spits out some smoke, but no fire.  The film
treads lightly on the volatile crossroads where disenchanted inner city
youth meet the desperate state of urban public education.  A la HIGHER
LEARNING, the prevailing simplification of issues concludes with empty
and confusing platitudes in answer to some complex stuff.
Queens, New York  it's about as bad as it can get at Lincoln High.
Almost nobody has textbooks, snow is blowing through broken windows in
dilapidated classrooms, and student favorite Mr. Knowles (Judd Nelson 
THE BREAKFAST CLUB, FROM THE HIP) was just fired for no good reason by
heavy-handed Principal Armstrong.  When Officer Dante Jackson (Forest
Whitaker  THE CRYING GAME, JASON'S LYRIC) struggles to detain gifted
student artist `Ziggy' Malone on bogus charges, Lester Dewitt (Usher
Raymond) takes matters into his own hands by seizing the Officer's gun
and taking Jackson hostage.  Now barricaded against the New York Police
Department, the basketball star Lester, the artist `Ziggy,' along with a
student council member, a punk-rocker, a hustler, and a gang banger have
to figure out what they are standing for.
Lester and the other students ultimately attempt to use their newfound
leverage to demand improvements for a decent education.  They use e-mail
to rally support from the community and dispel allegations by the media
that they are nothing but violent gang vigilantes.  As negotiations
fail, the stakes for Lester, the other students, and Officer Jackson
escalate.  The dramatic climax centers around whether loss of life can
be avoided as the NYPD closes in without meeting Lester's conditions.
Some may contend that LIGHT IT UP does well to leave its audience
frustrated with incomplete answers; after all, there are no easy
solutions to the problems it examines.  On the other hand, it seems
irresponsible to present such radical actions and then gloss over the
consequences in this incomplete fashion.  Call me old school, but I'd
rather `light it up' with a pint of JD than a ticket to this show  at
least a hangover usually has a few decent stories to go with it.

Too often writer/directors such as LIGHT IT UP's Craig Bolotin don't
take the time to create a plausible plot and realistic dialog.  Instead,
they go for exaggeration and hope for audiences who don't care.
LIGHT IT UP opens with an inner city high school that could be a poster
school for more government aid.  A few of its deficiencies would be
credible, but the litany goes on way pass the level of plausibility.
Water drips from the ceiling onto the students' papers, smearing the
ink.  As the kids shiver in heavy coats and knit caps, snow blows into
their classroom from the windows that have been broken for months.  Not
seeming to have the usual dropout problem, this school has classes that
are standing room only because of a lack of chairs.  And when the
teacher moves the class off campus to the local coffee shop in order to
find a warmer environment, an ex-student with a shotgun assaults the
class.
Some of the students go to complain to the principal about the temporary
suspension of the their favorite teacher, Mr. Knowles (Judd Nelson from
THE BREAKFAST CLUB, after which, according to the press notes, the
movie's casting was modeled.)  Officer Jackson (Forest Whitaker) is
called in to take them away.  He's the school's in-house cop, whom the
narrator describes as "a $5 cop with a $50 attitude."
In the hall, there's an accident.  After a whirlwind of events, the
officer ends up being shot in the leg by one of the kids.  It is after
this that the story goes seriously awry.
Six students unbelievably barricade the school and hold the officer
hostage.  They issue a short series of demands over the Internet by
spamming news organizations worldwide.  (They may not have books, but
they have the right computer equipment and savvy.)  These demands
include books, an annual career day and the right to test their teachers
every month.
Rather than having just bad kids risk getting shot at by the army of
cops who quickly surround the building, the story has some model
students being stupid enough to take part in such a guaranteed loser of
a situation.
Basketball star Lester Dewitt (Usher Raymond) becomes the leader of the
group.  Stephanie Williams (Rosario Dawson), the most implausible of
all, is a future doctor, who is on the national dean's list.  Why she
doesn't just walk out at the beginning, as most of the other students
do, is never properly explained.  Other students include a
self-described "slag," who recently got pregnant by a guy because she
wanted him to kiss her.  She seems too bored to walk out.
Although there are lots of threats with a gun, the script will soon
teach us that it's not the kids' fault.  One turns out to be an abused
child, and another has a dead father, whom the police recently killed
without provocation.
After setting up the unbelievable situation, the story basically runs
out of gas and ends.  The ending, of course, is a dramatic confrontation
with the police, followed by a sentimental epilogue.  If the writer had
taken the time to create characters rather than caricatures, perhaps we
could have cared.  As it is, we're just glad that it's over with.  The
windows do get repaired, but the movie leaves us in doubt about whether
the students will get their career day or not.
LIGHT IT UP runs 1:40.  It is rated R for language and violent content
and would be acceptable for older teens.

"First ten minutes, you made up in your mind who we were"
Starring Usher Raymond, Forest Whitaker, Rosario Dawson, Robert
Ri'chard, Fredro Starr, Vanessa L. Williams.  Rated R.
Oh how good it is, after being bombarded with redundant media coverage
of high school shootings and the prevailing violence in teenage
society, to see a mainstream film present a situation where teens that
resort to foul play aren't evil ciphers who go off the deep end for no
apparent reason. By no means does Light it Up glorify violence but it
doesn't jump to obvious conclusions about teens that are driven to it.
The characters here are not insane. They're not pushed off the edge by
violent TV shows. They're simply fed up and their reaction is more than
understandable.
The movie is set at a poor, inner-city high school and earns points
immediately by placing it in Queens, thereby offsetting the Harlem
stereotype. A full-time police officer has just been permanently placed
at Lincoln High to keep the peace. This is Officer Jackson (Forest
Whitaker), `a five dollar cop with a fifty dollar attitude.'  One day
he roughs up a kid for blocking the traffic in the hallway, which leads
to a wrestling match where the cop is shot in the leg with his own gun
and the gun goes flying to the floor. The kid grabs the gun and before
he knows it, he and a group of friends have taken the cop hostage.
There's Lester (R&B singer Usher Raymond), an intelligent, troubled boy
who is also the man with the gun and thus the ringleader; Stephanie,
who is really smart and has plans to become a doctor; Lynn, who has
just found out she is pregnant and Rodney, the obligatory homeboy.
They constantly fight over what to do next but whatever Lester says,
goes: he does, after all, have the gun.
Police surround the building. A kindly hostage negotiator (Vanessa L.
Williams) is called in. The students make a list of demands, consisting
mainly of getting their broken window fixed, their just-fired favorite
teacher rehired, textbooks for everyone, etc, etc. But the main thing
they want is respect. It can't be anything but painful to have no say
in the matter when your school is going to pieces right before your
eyes. It must be difficult to watch your future be compromised because
authority figures are performing their job inadequately. I believe
Light it Up when it says that this can get to the point where students
have no choice but to take matters into their own hands. The film
doesn't glorify this; rather, it presents it in an unbiased light.
This is a movie for teens, but then again it's not. It speaks to teens
intelligently, without condescending or trying to please. In that
sense, it's for them. But on the other hand, it may be a little too
intelligent: not enough action to interest those looking for excitement
and explosions and not enough romance to attract those of the female
persuasion. In that sense it's not. Be that as it may, this is not a
film that adults should be wary to see; just because it is about teens
does not mean it is exclusively for them and that is certainly not the
case here.
Light it Up deftly handles issues ambitious inner city kids may be
facing today, those who are actually troubled about the poor quality of
their schools. In our society, it is a contradiction when a child is
raised in a cruel, violent society and yet wants to learn. This movie
shows us how that contradiction can create an urge in teens to resort
to violence so that they can learn. It's a sad reality, but also one
that makes perfect sense given the circumstances.
Usher Raymond, a singer by trade, has a real screen presence. His
performance is intense and surprisingly powerful; like Ice Cube, Will
Smith, L.L. Cool J, and Vanessa Williams (who, of course, is in this as
well) here is another musician with the potential for a major crossover
into the movie industry. The amiable Williams is the only big star
here, making her a sort of backbone: even if a viewer hates everything
else in the movie, a good performance from a familiar face can go a
long way. She handles it well.
Though it has the tendency to rely too much on character stereotypes,
Light it Up is no formula movie. It's not a high school flick. Nor does
it exploit the recent tragedies that have occurred in the country. It
is a real film.

_Light_It_Up_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
_Light_It_Up_, written and directed by Craig Bolotin, is different from
most urban dramas in that in emphasizes ideas more than violence; in
fact, the quantity of the latter is surprisingly low for its genre.  But
it's too bad that not many other things about the film are quite so
distinctive.
Bolotin's setup, however, is rather interesting in its complication.  A
popular teacher (Judd Nelson) at Lincoln High is put on suspension after
taking his class off-campus without permission.  His students, led by
star b-baller Lester (Usher Raymond) and senior class president Stephanie
(Rosario Dawson), confront the principal (Glynn Turman) in protest,
indirectly leading to a physical struggle between artist Ziggy (Robert
Ri'chard) and the on-campus cop, Dante Jackson (Forest Whitaker).  A
bullet is fired; Jackson is wounded in the leg; and Lester finds himself
with the gun, holding the cop hostage.  Soon, Lester, Stephanie, and
Ziggy, along with drug dealer Rivers (Clifton Collins Jr.), gang member
Rodney (Fredro Starr), and pregnant outcast Lynn (Sara Gilbert)--now
dubbed "the Lincoln 6"--find themselves being listened to for the first
time.
Neglected but largely well-meaning inner city youths come into a
position of power.  It's a promising premise, but before long
_Light_It_Up_ devolves into cliché.  The hostage talks his captor into
giving him a drink of water, only to attempt physical harm.  The popular
girl and the outcast set aside their differences and learn to cooperate. 
Most annoying, however, is Lester's "dark secret," which points to a
deeper personal grudge against the police--as if there needed to be added
justification for his rebellion.
Raymond's popularity as an R&B crooner is undoubtedly the justification
Bolotin had in casting him as the lead, but that proves to not be a good
enough reason.  Raymond does a fairly adequate job (though his emotional
scenes are rather strained), but he doesn't have the forceful,
charismatic presence needed to convince as the ringleader of a group of
such headstrong individuals.  It's not terribly believable that Raymond's
Lester can keep the hotheaded Rodney in check.  Dawson has the strongest,
most composed presence of the six, and she gives Stephanie a steely yet
vulnerable confidence that Raymond's Lester clearly lacks.
Thankfully, Bolotin's wrapup to _Light_It_Up_, while not completely free
of convention, resolves the film's issues in a realistic and satisfying
manner.  There is no idealistic happy ending; hard lessons are learned by
all, and through them comes an inspiring sense of hope.  If only all of
_Light_It_Up_ lived up to that conclusion.

     Thomas Harris did a lot that was original with the novel RED
DRAGON, later made into the film MANHUNTER.  He established or at least
revitalized the entire sub-genre of stories of police and psychotic
serial killers.  This sort of story had been made before but he upped
the ante by making the killers more interesting and dangerous.  Today
the novel would not be as good because so much has been plundered for
use elsewhere.  Had THE BONE COLLECTOR come out at that time, it would
have been a much more intriguing film.  But by now most of what it
offers is familiar.  Phillip Noyce is not new to psychotic killer
films.  His DEAD CALM is one of the best because it is as much a sea
adventure as a murder plot.  Now he demonstrates just how important it
is to do something creative with the genre by giving us a thriller does
just about everything else right and still makes for a very mundane
film.  THE BONE COLLECTOR gives the ready-made audience who want to see
another violent psychotic thriller film a film to see, but does no
interesting playing with the genre.  The attraction of dealing with a
killer who thinks differently than a sane person should be that he is
unpredictable.  But just about everything about THE BONE COLLECTOR is
mechanical and done by the numbers.   The killer always leaves a clue
to his next crime and the heroes always figure out what the clue means
and exactly where the crime will occur down to a street address.
     The team of investigators seems to have been pulled from a
checklist of ethnic types.  We have a beautiful white patrol officer
unsure she wants to do forensics.  Then there is a black forensic
genius confined to a bed and suffering from seizures that he hopes will
soon kill him rather than become a vegetable.  And finally there is a
Latino forensic science researcher.  Of course the team of
investigators have to contend with a police department dominated by the
stupid and incompetent white males.  This gutsy team races the clock
and bucks the power structure finding clues that nobody else in the
police department can see.  This could almost be a TV pilot it is so
formulaic.
     Lincoln Rhyme (played by Denzel Washington) is the forensic expert
who literally wrote the book that defines police detective work.  Now
he is bed-ridden and subject to seizures that any time may leave him a
human vegetable.  Before that happens he wants to arrange his own
death.  Emily Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) is a plucky young patrol
officer.  When she answers a report about a dead body found she has to
stop a train in order to prevent it from rolling over a clue.  This
brings her censure from her superiors, but earns her the respect of
Lincoln Rhyme.  Over her own objections she is drafted to help do the
detective work to track the killer.  The two quickly discover that they
are dealing with a psychotic killer who in the best traditions of
Batman villains always leaves a puzzle clue to what his next crime will
be.  The team is rounded out by Eddie Ortez (Luis Guzman), a genius at
materials analysis.  There is something wrong with the script when with
no additional clues the audience gets way ahead of the experts in
guessing the killer.  About a third of the way through I had a very
short list of suspects.  But then there were no clues whatsoever until
it is revealed who the killer is.  When at the end one does know the
killer and the motivation it too seems more out of Batman than reality.
     Cinematographer Dean Semler does a lot of obvious things to create
the feel of the film.  Scenes are kept dark and oppressive.  When the
plot shifts a setting into the sunlight the lens is heavily filtered to
give an unwholesome look to the street and sky.  Outdoor distance shots
try repeatedly and without subtlety to establish that this is Manhattan
while close-ups, those that do not take place in the basements and
bowels of the city, do not look a lot like New York and in fact are
filmed in Montreal.
     Denzel Washington plays his role with entirely too much vitality
for the man on the brink of death.  I am told in the book Rhyme is
middle-aged, which would have seemed more believable.  Here he happily
pokes fun at his own seizures, which seems entirely a wrong gesture for
a man in his supposedly depressed state.  Angelina Jolie, daughter of
Jon Voigt, does little to make the character of Emily Donaghy her own
and dozens of young actresses could have been snapped into the same
role like interchangeable parts.  Luis Guzman, recently of THE LIMEY,
is certainly watchable.  And Queen Latifah as Rhyme's caregiver matches
Washington's amiability.
     THE BONE COLLECTOR is an extremely forgettable TV-pilot level
serial killer film.  Only real fans of the sub-genre will enjoy it.  I
give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.

Susan Granger's review of "LIGHT IT UP" (20th Century-Fox)
 There's this neglected high school in Queens, New York, where
a favorite teacher is suspended. In protest, six students barricade
themselves inside the school, reluctantly taking a police officer
(Forest Whitaker) hostage after he's accidentally shot. And the
simplistic, cliche-ridden story predictably evolves. But there's a
difference. After Columbine and other school shootings, this is a
surprisingly effective civics lesson about the dangers of
stereotyping. The six students are disparate personalities. There's
the sensitive graffiti artist (Robert Ri'chard) and the school's star
basketball player (R&B singer Usher Raymond), along with a
purple-haired, pregnant wise-cracker (Sara Gilbert), a sardonic
wheeler-dealer (Clifton Collins Jr.), a angry gang member (rap
musician Fredro Starr) with an itchy trigger finger and a brainy
beauty (Rosario Dawson) who tries to rationalize the impending
chaos. Written and directed by Craig Bolotin, it was supposedly
"inspired" by "The Breakfast Club," even casting Judd Nelson as the
caring, sensitive teacher. Vanessa L. Williams is the hostage
negotiator, and Glenn Turman is the school's beleaguered principal.
The "Stop Racism!" signs that pop up among the crowd of spectators,
along with the students' demands - the windows fixed, more textbooks,
and a Career Day - deliver the message of the danger of repressed
rage. However, there's little excuse for dialogue like one student's
observation: "There was a quiet riot in all of us" or another's
self-description: "a chalk-mark waiting to happen." On the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Light It Up" is an irresponsible but
well-intentioned 4. It's a flawed but plausible hostage thriller,
another R-rated movie aimed at teens.

High school was the most hellish part of my childhood; I was truly lucky
to leave it alive and mentally intact.  So when I saw the trailers for
"Light It Up", I could identify with some of the stuff happening.  On the
other hand, as a mother of a 17-year-old high school senior, I could also
Feel the situation from the adult's point of view.  But I'm getting ahead
of myself...
The Story (WARNING: some spoilers contained below):
"Light It Up" takes place in Lincoln High School, a run-down mess of a
school in the inner-city; many of its windows are broken or completely
gone ("It's so cold in here," one of the students says, "you can see the
sentences!"), water drips from the nasty ceilings, and the rooms are so
overcrowded that some of the students have to stand along the wallspace. 
The movie tells the story of six students--Rodney (Starr), a thug at the
exterior that may have more going for him on the inside than he lets on;
Rivers (Collins), a quick-witted hustler with a heart; Lynn (Gilbert), a
loner who gets some bad news early on; Stephanie (Dawson), an honor
student who is seen as uppity because she's trying to get out of "the
hood"; and Ziggy (Ri'chard), a sensitive artist and narrator of the story,
who, along with his friend Lester (Raymond), sets off a confrontation with
the authority figures at Lincoln.  These include Principal Armstrong
(Turman), who's overworked, underpaid, and too busy to hear about the
deplorable classroom conditions the students and teachers--especially Mr.
Knowles (Nelson)--have to work in; and school cop Officer Jackson
(Whitaker), "a $5 cop with a $50 attitude".  Things come to a head after
Jackson is accidently shot and the students (tagged the "Lincoln 6" by the
media) take matters into their own hands.
The Upshot:
For reasons that I'll speak on in detail in "The Black Factor", I wanted
very much to like "Light It Up".  I battled with myself between giving it
a green- or yellow-light rating, even though the writing was second-rate,
the subplots were thin, the execution was sloppy, and the excess
baggage--namely, Williams as Audrey The Negotiator--wasn't trimmed more. 
Edit the movie a bit and you'd have the makings of a good Afterschool
Special, or better yet, an HBO movie.
But this flick had its heart in the right place.  There was enough of a
balance of decent actors across the age spectrum (though truth to tell,
except for Raymond and Ri'chard, the "kids" looked a wee bit long in the
tooth) that it seemed neither a teen flick, nor an overly preachy morality
play (not too preachy, anyway, though it did try to work that nerve). 
Usher (who, as a Urban Contemporary singer, really needs to keep his shirt
on more) and Fredo (a rap artist in his other life) were surprisingly
good, though one-dimensional; the rest of the cast amiably went through
their paces to the mildly-surprising ending.
My biggest problem with this movie is that, like the kids, it didn't have
any real depth of focus; it didn't know what it wanted to Say.  Besides
the main Issue that struck me right where I live, its under-use of any of
the adults (other than Jackson; my jury is still out on Whittaker's
portrayal, though it's nice to see him as something besides the perennial
"good guy" lately), and inexplicable addition of Williams, put the onus on
Usher et al to carry the load.  Unfortunately, with the script they were
given to work with, they weren't up to the task.  More soapy than
authentic, it managed to strum the violin strings without adding the rest
of the band to provide a complete orchestration.  
It's funny; not long after I watched this movie, I came home to find "The
Negotiator" on HBO; starring Samuel Jackson and Kevin Spacey, that movie
ran circles around "Light It Up" in telling its hostage story (though I
have Issues with how both movies resolved the hostage situation; so as to
not spoil it, I'll post a message addressing these Issues on the 3BC
"Viewer Voices" webboard for further discussion).  Would that "Light It
Up" writer/director Bolotin had taken better Cliff's Notes from "The
Negotiator"; it might've gotten the respect that Rodney said the students
wanted.
The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]
    As a Black woman, I see the "Black Factor"--things that affect me as a 
    "consumer of color"--in many aspects of life; movies included. Whether 
    from the standpoint of noting Black (and other "minority") cast and crew
    members (if any), to the (lack of) focus toward "people of color" (dag, I
    hate that term), to the out-and-out antagonistic attitude toward Us 
    (Jar-Jar, anyone?), the "Black Factor" (BF) is something that plays as 
    much a role in my film enjoyment as any other aspect of the movie itself.
This one's more a "Inner-City Factor" than just a "Black Factor":
I'm oft heard to remark that today's younger generation is, in a way,
soft--specifically, the kids who are wannabe thugs by day, but come home
to a warm meal, an allowance, and heck, a house, for that matter.  MOST
children of working- and middle-class parents have been raised in a time
when they always knew what a Nintendo is; when their gym shoes (and I'm
aging myself by calling them gym shoes) often cost more than all the rest
of the clothes on their bodies; when they didn't have to use wire pliers
as a makeshift tuner for their (black and white) TV; when they didn't have
to depend on condiments to fill their stomachs when mama's cabinet was
bare--which was most of the time [all y'all former Sugar or Mayonnaise
Sandwich eaters, can I get an Amen?]
But on that ubiquitous Other Hand...not all kids--and let's be real
here--Black and Latino kids--are thuggish gangbangers, trashing everything
in their path (human and inanimate) just for the hell of it.  Most of
them, from what I've seen, are just like we were: confused, trying to make
their way in life the best they can, wanting a good life, and given
guidance by authority figures that give a damn, willing to work for it. 
And unlike us, they have to deal with the true bangers on a daily basis,
as well as a society that, like Jackson and Armstrong, has already made
its mind up about them before they even had a chance to prove otherwise.
Bammer's Bottom Line:
Though "Light It Up" loses ratings points for being thick with plot holes
and soap-opera cliches, this reviewer Heard what they were saying about
how we all need to take the time to listen to each other--students and
teachers, parents and children alike.  If nothing else, it provided a bit
of good after-movie conversation between my husband, my son, and myself. 
Can't beat that with a stick, eh?
"Light It Up" (rating: yellowlight) 
"The Negotiator" could teach "Light It Up" a thing or three about how to
script a hostage movie; but if you're willing to listen, "Light It Up"
could teach you a thing or three about today's youth.

An attempt at a teen movie, a 'la "The Breakfast Club," mixed with social 
commentary on inner-city schools, the media, and misunderstood youth, "Light 
It Up" goes wrong in so many ways that it quickly grows annoying. Swiftly 
moving from one scene to the next, there is barely any time to get to know 
the characters (and we don't), and before you know it, the film is over and 
you're left wondering why the movie didn't go through a few rewrites before 
filming commenced.
Set almost exclusively over a 24-hour period at Lincoln High School, a 
broken-down, scummy building in Queens, NY, the day begins disastrously and 
only gets worse. While teaching one of his classes, the window in his 
classroom breaks, letting in the unbearably cold winter air, and a well-liked 
professor, Ken Knowles (Judd Nelson), must find a warm place to teach. The 
library is taken, as is the gym, auditorium, and cafeteria, and after the 
frustratingly one-sided Principal Armstrong (Glynn Turman) tells him to take 
the kids anywhere, Mr. Knowles and the students go out to a nearby 
restaurant. Upon returning, Principal Armstrong is outraged Mr. Knowles would 
lead them off campus, and fires him. Outraged at this unfair act since 
Knowles was one of the few faculty members who cared about them, aspiring 
doctor Stephanie (Rosario Dawson), the determined Lester (Usher Raymond), and 
the innocent Ziggy (Robert Ri'chard), protest and are quickly threatened with 
suspension. 
Through a chain of events, Ziggy accidentally shoots NYPD Officer Jackson 
(Forest Whitaker), Lester grabs the gun, pulls the fire alarm, and instructs 
everyone to leave the school. Soon, the police and media have surrounded the 
school, leaving the six students, which also include Lynn (Sara Gilbert), who 
just found out she was pregnant by a guy who wants nothing to do with her; 
the subtly rebellious Rivers (Clifton Collins Jr.); and troublesome Rodney 
(Fredro Starr), alone with Jackson, who is gradually losing a lot of blood. 
Persistent in taking a stand, the kids decide that in order to cooperate, 
they want certain demands met, all pertaining to fixing up the school. It 
soon becomes clear, however, that hostage negotiator Audrey McDonald (Vanessa 
L. Williams) is doing nothing to meet their requests, and with the police 
moving in, Lester, Stephanie, and the gang realize their time is running out.
"Light It Up," directed in strict television-drama mode by Craig Bolotin, 
stumbles within the first five minutes, due to shamefully and blatantly 
ripping off the opening of 1998's "The Faculty," in which the teen characters 
were introduced one at a time and their names were flashed upon the screen. 
The only relation to the two films is the appearance of R&B star Usher 
Raymond, and without the involvement of "The Faculty" director Robert 
Rodriguez or screenwriter Kevin Williamson, this is a storytelling device 
that only acts to uncover the film's utter imitativeness.
Furthermore, films about troubled schools (1995's "Dangerous Minds," 1996's 
"The Substitute") and hostage negotiations (1975's "Dog Day Afternoon," 
1991's "Toy Soldiers") are a dime a dozen, and this one doesn't offer one 
original or insightful moment in its whole running time. We already knew that 
the media often distorts the truth, and that the problematic inner-city 
schools are in great danger; now tell me something I didn't know.
A well-meaning, yet derivative, film of this sort is basically made or broken 
by the writing and portrayals of the characters, and both aspects are 
unsatisfactorily handled. The screenplay, also by Bolotin, devotes very 
little time to the central six characters, or to Jackson, and what is offered 
is little more than the Cliffs Notes version of who each person is. Compared 
to 1985's classic "The Breakfast Club" in its press notes, "Light It Up" 
isn't even in the same ballpark. While "The Breakfast Club" thoughtfully 
examined each character, and how the high school years really are, "Light It 
Up" is in too mad of a rush to do anything of the sort. Maybe Bolotin should 
have been reminded that the viewer will not care about this story if they 
aren't given the credit of knowing the faces that litter the screen. 
Even if the screenplay had been up to speed, the film would had to have been 
recast, as these lot of young actors are certainly not going to win any 
acting awards. In his first starring role, Usher Raymond switches from being 
understated to overacting, and rarely ever hits the right notes. Worse is 
Fredro Starr, whose character of Rodney is so vexatious and irredeemable that 
I cringed every time he was on screen. Narrating the picture, Robert 
Ri'chard, as Ziggy, leaves no impression at all, nor does Clifton Collins 
Jr.'s role of Rivers. Meanwhile, Rosario Dawson (1998's "He Got Game") is 
fetching and passionate as A-student Stephanie, and Sara Gilbert (TV's 
"Roseanne") handles her sparse character-defining moments with reasonable 
aplomb. The adult roles are all empty-headed and forgettable, from the 
usually reliable Forest Whitaker, to Vanessa L. Williams' 
"take-the-paycheck-and-run" cameo, to Judd Nelson's earnest Mr. Knowles.
Following a stringently straight line, "Light It Up" never wanders off its 
thoroughly cliched path, nor does it even attempt to. Its as if 
writer-director Bolotin was so enthusiastic about actually making a movie 
that he forgot to concentrate and make one that was actually rewarding. The 
film would like to be a meaningful slice-of-life, but it says nothing 
advantageous at all about the world we live in, and even climaxes with that 
old, reliable standby, in which a dying character sputters out words of 
wisdom right before drawing his last breath. How can a film be perceived as 
realistic when it is rarely ever convincing? Bolotin attempts this amazing 
trick, and let's just say the rabbit never turns up in his top hat.
