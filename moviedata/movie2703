"The Heiress" is adaptation of the play by Augustus 
and Ruth Goetz, which in turn was an adaption of the
Henry James novel "Washington Square."  
The story is about a plain young woman (Olivia De Havilland,
best known for her role in "Gone With The Wind") who is
courted by an attentive suitor (Montgomery Clift).
Her prim father (Ralph Richardson) correctly judges Clift
to be an ingratiating idler and threatens disinheriting
her should she elope.  Will De Havilland disobey her
father?  Will Clift marry her without her fortune?  Will
father and daughter be reconciled?  If you've seen the
latest adaptation of the novel, "Washington Square", you
already know the answer to these questions.
"The Heiress" was nominated for a flood of academy awards,
but the only major award was Best Actress to De Havilland.
Her character begins the story as an earnest wallflower,
but becomes proud and mature by its end.  De Havilland
could play both sides of the character equally well.
The film was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Director,
Best Supporting Actor (Richardson) and Best B & W Cinematography.
The competition must have been very strong that year,
although I suspect that Oscar votes went to "All the King's Men" 
and "Twelve O'Clock High" because of their appeal to men, 
while the target audience of "The Heiress" was women.
Why is "The Heiress" such an outstanding movie?  The script
is excellent.  Clift and especially Richardson are well
cast.  De Havilland is too lovely to play the plain daughter,
but she does it so well.  The three major characters
are well defined, particularly the father, who belittles
his daughter by comparing her with the idealized memory 
of his late wife.
