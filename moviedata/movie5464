LITTLE MURDERS (director: Alan Arkin; screenwriter: Jules Feiffer;
cinematographer: Gordon Willis; editor: Howard Kuperman; cast: Elliott
Gould (Alfred Chamberlain), Marcia Rodd (Patsy Newquist), Vincent
Gardenia (Mr. Newquist), Jon Korkes (Kenny Newquist), Elizabeth Wilson
(Mrs. Newquist), Donald Sutherland (Minister), Lou Jacobi (Judge Stern),
Alan Arkin (Lieutenant Practice), John Randolph (Mr. Chamberlain), Doris
Roberts (Mrs. Chamberlain); Runtime: 110; 1971)
A provocatively caustic, funny, black humor satire, on how depressive
life has become in the New York City of the late 1960s for the
middle-class, who are caught in the changing times. Their family values,
belief in God and country, and increasing dependence on TV for news and
entertainment, has them reeling, as the society they know is breaking
down. In a city faced with an increase in violent crime, racial hatred,
burglaries, garbage strikes, alienation, nuisance phone calls, power
outages, muggings, and a controversial Mayor Lindsay, life has become so
unbearable that people have come to accept crime as the natural way of
life. This acerbic script comes by way of Jules Feiffer, the cartoonist
for the Village Voice, who first had this work play off-Broadway at
Circle in the Square, where it became a hit with the New York theater
audience, sharing in delight at the author's dissing of such
establishment figures as the police, the clergy, and the judges. Vincent
Gardenia and Elliott Gould who are in the film, were also in the
original play.
Here, the city is a comparative battlefield where residents have
multiple locks on their doors, the cops are corrupt and incompetent nut
cases, and the cries of resignation heard from those who feel beaten
down emotionally and physically are as everyday as traffic jams during
rush hour.
Alfred Chamberlain (Gould) is an apathetic, laid-back photographer
getting beat up by a gang of kids without trying to defend himself, as
he reasons they will soon get tired of punching me, when from her
apartment window, Patsy Newquist (Marcia), a successful interior
decorator, who says she wakes up every morning with a smile on her face,
even when picking up the phone to a heavy breather, rushes down to
rescue the mugging victim.  He just walks away without thanking her, and
when she confronts him, he says he is indifferent to the pain. So starts
their troublesome romance, as this intelligent, vibrant, and beautiful
27-year-old, thinks she has found her Prince Charming at last: someone
she can mold into her ideal mate.
Everything is played out in a revue format as a scathing farce. Patsy
brings him to meet the family, where the sardonic dad (Gardenia) is
despondently ranting about how things have changed for the worse, he is
sure that his daughter's date will be a swish; while, mother (Wilson) is
the picture of obliviousness, trying to make everything seem sweet,
while speaking in clichés, and when the power goes off, she remarks:
"It's better to strike a match than curse the darkness." The younger
brother is a closet homosexual, disconnected with reality, reading inane
books such as "Lesbians in Venus."
Alfred has become so disillusioned with his life, that he has given up
taking photographs of people, further disillusioned that
commercialization has trivialized the art scene, as he discovered that
since he developed a reputation he can photograph anything and have it
accepted by the Establishment. He now shoots pictures of shit only and
Harper's Bazaar is using it for its next issue. That he is successful,
is all that matters to Patsy's parents in accepting him for their
daughter.
In another hilarious scene, Alfred refuses to get married by a judge
(Jacobi), who raves like a lunatic about how God helped him get to the
high position he now has. Instead, he goes to the hippie Ethical Culture
minister (Sutherland). In a funny monologue, Sutherland calls the
wedding ceremony a search for truth, finding rationals for whatever
happens in life, telling the couple that of the 200 marriages he has
performed only 7 are still married. He takes the $250 that Mr. Newquist
gave him to include God in the ceremony, but tells him it is OK that you
gave me the money for that, but it is also OK that I betray you by not
including it in the ceremony.
As soon as Patsy injects life into the hapless photographer and has him
look back with regret at his early years that made him so filled with
angst, she is killed by a sniper in their apartment. In the final scene,
Alfred returns to live with Patsy's family and realizes that the only
way to live in an insane world is to be just as crazy as the world is.
When he brings back a rifle to the apartment, he brings the family close
together again, making them happy, as they fire out the window of their
apartment, randomly killing those in the street. Alfred even gets a
chance to kill the hostile, paranoid cop (Arkin), who tried to
intimidate him. This comes at a time when there is a crime wave, where
there are 345 unsolved murders in the last 6 months. But, clearly,
Feiffer is saying that the little murders occurring daily are the ones
we do emotionally to our souls, where we kill our feeling for life by
becoming indifferent to the ills of the world.
The performers were outstanding, as I was especially pleased with Marcia
Rodd's captivating portrayal of someone with spunk. The film was
torridly on target and eerily funny, but only to a point, as it seemed
to create such a far-out situation, that it was difficult to keep
laughing when there was so much cynicism and so much that went beyond
the pale of farce and became too arcane to decifer where it was leading
to. When Elizabeth Wilson has the film's last word and says, "You don't
know how good it is to hear my family laughing again," this coming after
they acted as snipers, which leaves the black humor with a very tainted
message.

        Cable channels like Bravo earn their keep by offering cinematic
gems which have been buried under pounds of blockbusters and sequels--for
instance, LITTLE MURDERS, the 1971 film adaptation of Jules Feiffer's
off-Broadway play.  Until it popped up on Bravo's schedule, I had never
heard of LITTLE MURDERS, which is strange because the movie definitely
deserves attention.
        Directed by Alan Arkin, LITTLE MURDERS is an utterly unforgettable
and provocative pitch-black satire.  The movie is set within the violent
confines of New York City, and it presents a grim world of neurosis and
paranoia.
        LITTLE MURDERS chronicles an unusual romance between the
unlikeliest couple.  Marcia Rodd is a high strung, head-strong interior
decorator; Elliott Gould is an apathetic, socially-withdrawn photographer
(who specializes in shooting dung).  Gould is a social misfit of the
highest order--painfully passive and shy.  The two meet when Rodd rescues
Gould from some thugs who are beating him to a pulp outside her apartment
window.  Gould is too indifferent to fight off his assailants so Rodd jumps
in and knocks them away with her purse.  It's not quite love at first
sight, but it IS the beginning of a turbulent relationship.
        Rodd sees Gould as someone whom she can mold into her ideal mate.
She starts by forcing him to have fun: they golf, play tennis, go bowling,
and ride horses.  Love is in the air.  Well, sort of...  Rodd falls in love
with Gould, and Gould ... well, Gould doesn't know what love is, but he
finds Rodd "comfortable."  And before you know it, she has brought him home
to meet her parents, despite his protestations that he doesn't like
families.
        The dinner with Rodd's family is hysterical beyond belief--the
movie's piece de resistance.  Rodd's mother, father, and brother make for
one of the strangest families ever captured on film.  Vincent Gardenia is
priceless as Rodd's conservative father.  Her dense mother, played by
Elizabeth Wilson, is a walking cliche who is constantly spewing platitudes,
like "It's always darkest before the dawn" and "How far better it is to
strike a match than curse the darkness."  Jon Korkes is weird enough to
give you the creeps as Rodd's off-the-wall brother.  I couldn't figure out
if he was supposed to be retarded or just incredibly immature: he looks 25,
but he has the mentality of Bart Simpson.
        LITTLE MURDERS is bursting at the seams with the grotesquely
absurd.  Every character is weirder than the one before.  Donald
Sutherland, for example, has a small but juicy role as the radical preacher
who marries Gould and Rodd in a decidedly unorthodox ceremony.  Sutherland,
sporting a hippy-look with long hair and beard, comes across as a demented,
modern-day Jesus-figure--one who gleefully denounces marriage and mocks
love.  The actors perform their roles with obvious relish and gusto,
especially director Alan Arkin, who briefly appears on the scene as a mad
detective.
        It's tempting to praise each performance in LITTLE MURDERS as a
tour de force, but it's really more accurate to say that the entire movie
is a tour de force--of writing, directing, AND acting.  The laughs pile up
on top of one another, but just when you least expect it, LITTLE MURDERS
does an about face and turns serious, deadly serious, with some shocking
plot twists.  As a result, the film is both brutally funny and brutally
disturbing.
