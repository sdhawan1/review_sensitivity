"Titus," a gruesome tale of the sweetest revenge, can be summed
up flawlessly by the opening line of the
musical "Chicago," "Murder, greed, corruption, violence,
exploitation, adultery, treachery - all those things we hold
near and dear to our hearts."
I doubt Shakespeare scripted orgies, arcade video games, or
obnoxiously banal bookends for his deliciously appalling
tragedy, "Titus Andronicus." Yet here we are, 400 years later,
soaking in Julie Taymor's campy and freakish adaptation of the
Bard's most sanguinary work which she says, "speaks directly to
our times, when audiences feed daily on tabloid sex scandals,
teenage gang rape, and the private details of a celebrity murder
trial, when racism, ethnic cleansing, and genocide have almost
ceased to shock by being so commonplace and seemingly
inevitable. Our entertainment industry thrives on the graphic
details of murders, rapes and villainy, yet it is rare to find a
film or play that not only reflects on these dark events but
also turns them inside out, probing and challenging our
fundamental beliefs on morality and justice. For Titus is not a
neat or safe play, where goodness triumphs over evil, but one in
which, through relentless horror, the undeniable poetry of human
tragedy emerges in full force, demanding that we examine the
very root of violence and judge its various acts."
Today on "Where Are They Now?" we have Academy Award winners
Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange, Tony Award winners Alan
Cumming and Julie Taymor, and the self-proclaimed greatest
writer of all time, William Shakespeare. Hopkins, who won an
Oscar for playing Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lecter in the 1991
film "The Silence of the Lambs," is back in another human flesh
munchfest, this time one written by The Bard. Although the
performance as the great Roman general Titus is powerfully
preeminent, it lacks the bite that made Hannibal such a kick to
watch.
The Queen Bee is Titus' archenemy. No, not Li'l Kim! I'm talking
about the venomous Queen of the Goths played libidinously by
Jessica Lange, Tamora who is married to Saturninus, played by
Alan Cumming, Queen of the Cross-Dressing Broadway Singers and
Dancers. See, Tamora is PMSing because Titus slew her first-born
son despite her begging for his life. And now, she's planning a
number of dirty double crossings and revenges to be exerted upon
him, his friends, his family, his reputations, his sanity....
And the woman helming it all is none other than that evil
mastermind also behind the Broadway adaptation of "The Lion
King," Julie Taymor. Like Baz Luhrmann (Romeo + Juliet) before
her, Taymor tries a number of attention-grabbing concepts to
update this Shakespearean work, and like Luhrmann before her,
several of them fail horribly. Some are fiercely disturbing and
memorable; some are obliviously insipid and uninspired. There's
an MTV music video halfway through the film that is absolutely
vapid and just takes up precious screen time.
Julie opens "Titus" with a strikingly lame introduction that is
supposed to link the play to modern times. A young boy with a
paper bag over his head plays with toy soldiers and sprays
ketchup on them. This sequence lasts an astoundingly tedious 5
minutes. Whatâ€™s worse, is that the film ends with this same boy
walking into "the light." Talk about disrespecting The Bard.
There are only two ways to review a Shakespearean play and a
Shakespearean adaptation. If the Shakespeare play has great
dialogue, nothing else matters, it's a Shakespeare play that's
main objective is to have great dialogue, monologues, and duets.
For a Shakespearean adaptation to be successful, all that is
truly necessary is adequate interpretation and superb acting
performances. And you bet your ass "Titus" has excellent
performances.
However, like most Shakespearean adaptations, there's always a
couple of weak links, and this is no exception. For every
strikingly stirring Shakespearean rant and rave spewed by a
veteran actor or actress (Hopkins, Lange, Harry J. Lennix, Colm
Feore), there's a boring and juvenile high school performance by
what seems like amateurs (Cumming, Matthew Rhys, Jonathan Rhys-
Meyers).
No matter how many shots I take at "Titus," nothing can fade a
movie that is this far-out. Any movie that can be
called "Shakespeare on Crack" is untouchable. "Titus" is the
freakshow we have no choice but to stare at with uncontrollable
awe.

   One online critic ended his review of "Titus" with the
comment, "If you like slasher films, check it out."  How silly. 
If this comment were valid, the one theater in New York
showing the film would have been crowded with teens, but
not a one was in sight (which could mean that none were on 
site of that reviewer).  Sure, there are some meetings of knife
with flesh in Julie Taymor's wonderfully vivid and visceral
adaptation of the early play by Shakespeare "Titus
Andronicus"--which has more in common with Jacobean
melodrama than Shakespearean tragedy.  But this
play--underrated and underplayed through the centuries
because some effete intellectuals thought it was too bloody to
be taken quite seriously--is masterful in its evocation of
humanity's thirst for revenge, for bloodletting, for the
vindication of some cause of other.  Look only to the endless
cycle of action and retaliation which during the present
decade has pitted Tutsis against Hottentots, or Croats and
Serbs and Muslims against one another to see that "Titus
Andronicus" is no period piece irrelevant to contemporary
times.
   Using Dante Ferretti's smashing production design, "Titus,"
filmed mostly in Italy especially by Hadrian's Villa and
Mussolini's 1930s government center, Taymor wisely and
imaginatively avoids making this a museum piece.
In the spirit of such recent adaptations as Baz Luhrmann's
1996 "Romeo and Juliet" (albeit without that creation's blatant
immaturity), Taymor has forged a well-developed, innovative
construction with some remarkable acting by seasoned British
performers spouting dialogue that remains true to the Bard's
literary genius.  Taymor has reigned in the special effects
team to avoid any semblance of a video-game mentality,
saving the fantasy impressions for an occasional display of
the title character's supposedly insane mind-state, while
throwing in contemporary touches like the Thunderbird on
which the emperor Saturninus rides into town, an infrequent
appearance by motorcycles, tanks and trucks, and a
scattering of 20th century firearms.  Aside from these, the
film makes us aware that we are indeed in the ancient Rome
of the Fifth Century, with a young man from the 1990s
bearing witness to a world in which human destructive
passions are not much different from those of his own time.
   Taymor--who directed Broadway's hit musical "The Lion
King"--opens the scene on a youth of about 11 years who is
playing destructively with toy soldiers on a kitchen table,
overturning all the food in sight with his marauding armies. 
An explosion erupts and the boy is seized by a Mad Max
character and transported to the Roman Colosseum where he
witnesses a horde of gladiators marching simultaneously to
an unheard beat to celebrate the return of General Titus
(Anthony Hopkins) from his successful campaign up north
against the Goths. Having lost twenty-one sons in battle,
Titus is in no mood to appease his important prisoners,
notably the Queen of the Goths, Tamora (Jessica Lange) and
Tamora's sons.  He therefore promptly orders the execution
of her firstborn--thus setting in motion a plethora of revenge
fantasies.  When Titus's daughter Lavinia (Laura Fraser)
rejects a marriage offer by Emperor Saturninus (Alan
Cumming), the emperor willfully takes the Gothic queen as
his wife, never realizing that Tamora has a secret lover who
plots against all, the unrepentant and evil Moor Aaron (Harry
Lennix).  When Tamora's idiotic sons Chiron (Jonathan Rhys
Meyers) and Demetrius (Matthew Rhys) rape Lavinia, cutting
off her hands and replacing them with twigs while slashing
out her tongue to prevent her from accusing them, Titus vows
to vindicate his daughter in a culinary fashion.
   "Titus Andronicus," which foreshadows more thoroughly
realized and developed works like "King Lear," also features
scenes which would be given berths in "Hamlet" (Titus's
feigned insanity) and "Othello" (Aaron's Iago-like
wickedness).  Anthony Hopkins does a splendid job of
exhibiting his character in all modes of conduct, humorous
when serving a vindicating meat pie to the emperor,
diabolical when affecting derangement, pitiful when
contemplating his mangled daughter Lavinia, resolute in
planning his strategy against the establishment.  Alan
Cummings, who is at his best in lightly humorous roles such
as his performance as a hotel desk clerk in "Eyes Wide
Shut," is not as convincing as the habitually enraged leader
of the world's most powerful empire, but Jessica Lange
sparkles as the seductress who ably covers her sinister
designs behind benevolent smiles.  
   Despite the difficulty that a modern audience might expect
from a work that keeps Shakespeare's 16th Century English
intact, this "Titus" is easily accessible to the sophisticated
audience to whom it is directed.  Taymor's direction is so
physical that the actions speak for themselves, gestures and
deeds pumped up ably by Elliot Goldenthal's puissant score
and Luciano Tovoli's lavish camerawork.
Rated R.  Running Time: 162 minutes.  (C) 1999

TITUS (director/writer: Julie Taymor; screenwriter: from a play by
William Shakespeare "Titus Andronicus"; cinematographer: Luciano Tovoli;
editor: Francois Bonnot; cast: Anthony Hopkins (Titus), Jessica Lange
(Tamora), Alan Cumming (Saturnius), Harry Lennix (Aaron), Jonathan Rhys
Meyers (Chiron), Matthew Rhys (Demetrius), Angus Macfadyen (Lucius),
Colm Feore (Marcus), James Frain (Bassianus), Laura Fraser (Lavinia),
Osheen Jones (Young Lucius); Runtime: 162; 1999-US/Italy)
A further vulgarization of Shakespeare's most vulgar play that succeeds
in going over the top and losing its sensibilities without adding
anything worthwhile to take the place of what was lost, yet it is not
without its positives. This early tragedy written by the young bard is
also his weakest and most turbulent play, casting out dramatical
dimensions, poetry, and pity in favor of gore. It is a difficult one to
come to terms with, except to see it for its dark humor and parody.
Julie Taymor (theater-version of Disney's "The Lion King"), the female
director/writer, who put this elaborate production on as an experimental
off-Broadway play, films it as a revenge story that has a surreal look
of time travel to it (a grandson of Titus' is playing soldiers on the
kitchen table when Titus marches in from ancient Rome and shows him what
happened back then), while also playing up the contemporary political
intrigues in Rome with those of ancient Rome, thereby pointing out how
little we have learned from the past. She also highlights the darkened
hearts of all who seek revenge for their hurts and gleefully shows how
they get this revenge, doing it in a campy way.
Anthony Hopkins plays Titus with the same kitsch he played Hannibal
Lecter, but without the same results. Unfortunately, for him, this was a
different picture and his overacting grew wearisome. The film was also
overlong at 162 minutes, without having a sufficient reason for being
that long.
Titus returns from conquering the Goths, but paying the heavy price of
having 21 of his sons killed in battle, with only 4 remaining. He brings
back the loser's empress, Tamora (Lange), and her three sons as
captives. Titus, despite the mother's pleas for mercy, slays her eldest
son Alarbus and throws him in the fire as revenge for the death of his
sons, but spares her and the two other sons, Chiron (Jonathan Rhys
Meyers) and Demetrius (Matthew Rhys). Mother, tattooed and clad in gold
lame and matching gold breastplates, whispers to her remaining sons of
revenge.
The new emperor crowned is Saturnius (Cumming). He is the unpopular son
of the last emperor but has the reluctant blessing of Titus -- who turns
down the mobs' cries for him to be crowned. Cumming's plays his role as
an insecure, campy effete, prancing about as a puff, coifed in an Adolph
Hitler hairstyle, as he aims to steal every scene by his gyrations and
petulant looks. Lange's idea for a hurt queen, is to seethe like a snake
throughout, while Hopkins is the loyal general to Rome who is betrayed
by politics, loudly spitting his lines out as if he were saying the most
urgent things for the world to hear, as the film goes back and forth
between a child dropped into ancient Rome Alice in Wonderland-style,
showing the lifestyle from the decadent Fascist Italy of Il Duce, and
viewing the tribulations during ancient Roman times. It all seems glossy
and avant-garde, but surprisingly, the film is most faithful to
Shakespeare's text.
When Saturnius surprises Titus by choosing his daughter Lavinia (Fraser)
as his queen, her promised husband Bassianus (Frain) reacts by
kidnapping her from the emperor, with the help of Titus's sons. Titus
feels he has been disgraced in Rome and slays his youngest son, showing
his allegiance to Rome over family. But with the loss of Lavinia,
Saturnius is attracted to the pagan goddess Tamora and marries her
instead, but does not forgive Titus's sons for their kidnapping.
Tamora soon gets her revenge on Titus. Marcus (Feore), Titus's brother,
finds Lavinia looking like a scarecrow in the field, after being
brutally raped and mutilated with Tamora's approval, as her boys cut out
her tongue and cut off her limbs. The evil Moor Aaron (Lennix), Tamora's
lover, plays Saturnius off against Titus, spitefully orchestrating the
vengeful deceptions. After Bassianus is murdered and two of Titus's sons
are trapped in a hole in the woods, the Moor delivers the message to
Titus that the emperor requires the hand of Lucius as revenge, and he
will free the trapped sons. Titus gladly has his hand chopped off by
Aaron as payment, but instead of his sons being returned, the heads of
his sons are chopped off and returned by messenger, as Aaron betrayed
him to the emperor and told him it was Titus's hand not his sons.
Lucius, the remaining son is banished from Rome, and joins the Goths to
attack Rome.
The morbid humor comes about as Titus gets his revenge and reverts from
being simply a warrior to a philosopher, carrying his woes inside him
like he does his broken heart for Rome and for his family. He will serve
meat pies to the unsuspecting Tamora, who eats them and reacts with
horror when told what she just ate were her sons' body parts. Titus will
then slit her throat with the appetite of a psychopath, smacking his
lips with delight as his chef's hat bobs up and down. The emperor's fate
is also sealed in a similar manner.
Not every work by Shakespeare has to be great, even though, if the bard
wrote it, there has to be something there. This one suffers from
worldliness, hollowness, and from having no point to it; I doubt if any
screenplay could rescue it from its banality of violence. Julie Taymor's
version was a good costumed effort to show the violence for all that it
is, but in the process making it into a campy Grand Guignol production.
On a more serious note, she also shows the following: that racial hatred
begets more hatred on the part of the Moor, the links to Saturnius with
modern Fascism are obvious ones, that debauchery by the pagan queen
leads to a society where children grow up without values, like her sons
who act as sociopaths on a speed trip; and, finally, there is the
madness of Titus to consider, the film's protagonist, who kills children
-- his own and others. The only hope for the future is in the children,
a young Lucius who must learn to become less hateful and the bastard son
of Aaron, who must get past his father's blistering racial bitterness.
But I found it all coming together too artificially. It was an art-house
film, way too fluffy to serve the film's dramatic efforts, as it all
seemed like a Fellini rip-off, taking the subtlety out of Shakespeare's
work for all the excesses engendered.

Okay... I'm kinda lost.  Who the hell is Titus Andronicus, you may ask,
fellow reader, and why the hell was I never forced to read this
Shakespearean play in high school or English 1A in college.  Well, Titus
A. was the first play by Bill Shakespeare, but if I am wrong, you crazy
Shakespearean cultists out there, please don't hunt me down and make me
read the unabridged version of Hamlet, about the usual themes of the
mighty Bill: Revenge, hatred, a little bit of incest, honor, mental
loopiness, and damn good human mincemeat pie.  The hard part of trying
to bring Shakespeare to life through either film or stage production is
trying to cut through all of the pompous attitude of the director and
making an understandable, comprehensible piece of narrative.
The pompous attitude of this version of Titus, not to be confused with
the 1998 Germany TV movie `Titus und der Fluch der Diamanten', is what
drags this film along like a squirrel caught in the wheel well of a semi
driving cross country.  When I watch a film, I want to watch a film, not
a play.  When I watch a play, vice versa.  When Titus explodes across
the screen in the first five minutes, I was intrigued by the imagery of
a child making a mess of things with G.I. Joes and every condiment in
the fridge -- and then the whole world exploding outside his window.
Then as I settled in and began to take account of the situation during
the next twenty minutes of the film, my inner child screamed for mercy.
I was mentally beaten by the `imagery' and the ridiculousness of how
dramatic a person can be just by standing up and walking a few steps and
then sitting down again.  Where is Kenneth Branagh when we need him?
For the next 2 1/2 hours of sheer torment, I was witness to a parade of
the absurd.  Jessica Lange in an orgy, Hopkins naked in a bathtub makin'
drawings of his bum with the blood of his severed stump for a hand,
cannibalism, a drag queen for an emperor, a frame-up job that pales next
to the works of Mamet, and (yes) a human mincemeat pie.  I think the
spookiest thing I witnessed was a strange Blair Witch Project reference
with a chick whose tongue was cut out, like Josh the camera guy, and her
hands cut off and replaced by twigs.  Somebody better make a call to
Artisan and report this travesty.
The root of all of these errors falls on the heads of the production
crew that steered this oil tanker of a film onto the rocky cliffs of
Schumacher-land.  The clash of costume design that resulted in a strange
mix of both Mad Max and Flash Gordon outfits.  The flamboyant, over-done
MTV montages of dreaming and non-dreaming states of consciousness.  The
inclusion of Jessica Lange in a Roman orgy: Run away -- run away!  The
dead weight of subplots that needed a good dose of Walter Murch editing.
So why did I award this film with two stars instead of one?  Two
reasons: Human mincemeat pie and one great orgy.

"Titus Andronicus" was one of Shakespeare's first
plays.  It is not regarded as one of his better plays,
but the story of an honorable warrior at odds with a
spiteful Queen is nonetheless an ambitious and epochal
tale of valor, vengeance and vindication. 
Shakespearean work has enjoyed a resurgence these last
few years and we have come to enjoy some of his tales
told through cinema with offerings such as Romeo +
Juliet, Hamlet, and a Midsummer's Night Dream. 
"Titus" however has a much darker subject than any of
these recent films.  It is a tragic and seething drama
about vengeance most foul.  It is a chilling tale that
showcases unbridled malice in a manner that is almost
shocking and certainly unlike any Shakespeare work to
which I have been exposed.
"Titus" of the film is played brilliantly by Anthony
Hopkins, who seemed born to play this role.  His
loyalty to his king and country is so great that he
would even slay his own kin without hesitation if it
was the honorable thing to do.  As part of his duties,
he is to carry out a ritualistic sacrifice of a young
man.  The mother, Tamora (Jessica Lange), begs Titus
to spare her son's life.  But her pleas go unheard,
and the deed is done.  Tamora swears that she shall
exact revenge when the time is appropriate.  In other
early scenes, we meet other characters that revolve
around Titus's life.  These include Saturninus (Alan
Cumming) and Bassianus (James Frain), two Princes who
are vying for the recently vacated throne.  Livinia
(Laura Fraser) is Titus's beautiful daughter who is
betrothed to Bassianus, but is also the object of
desire of Saturninus as well as Tamora's two sons,
Chiron and Demetrius (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Matthew
Rhys).  We also meet the brother of Titus (Colm
Feore); Titus's four sons; and Aaron the Moor (Harry
Lennix), another schemer who is like a tutor to
Tamora's two sons.
These introductions occur in the first 25 minutes of
the film.  With the number of characters being
introduced and my inability to fully comprehend
"Shakespeare-speak," I actually found it difficult to
stay focused.  In addition, the setting of the film is
a fantastically dreamy and imaginative world where the
past and present simultaneously co-exists.  In one
scene, you'll see chariots and spears.  In another
scene, you'll see motorcycles and machine guns.  I say
that it's like a dream because it's both beautiful,
yet contextually challenging.
By the second act, the story becomes more focused. 
Tamora has ascended to Queen by winning the heart of
Saturninus.  With her new powers, she now begins her
quest for revenge.  Her sons also engage in rancorous
behavior.  However, their amorally reckless actions
stem from youth and boredom rather than from a need
for revenge.  Tamora's and her sons' wickedness comes
at great expense to Titus.  The climax of the film is
a hauntingly beautiful scene at a crossroads where
Titus has finally exhausted all patience, and his
loyalties have all but dissipated.  Now the once-proud
and honorable warrior must gather up his remaining
strength to combat the injustice that has been
afflicted upon him.  
The film is appropriately rated "R" for adult themes
involving decapitated body parts, implied cannibalism,
and a wanton need for revenge.  Though Shakespeare is
taught at middle school levels, only the maturest of
audiences should witness the baseness of the
character's actions.  In many ways, it is a beautiful
film that is ambitious, creative, and showcases superb
acting.  Yet, for all it's achievements, I can not
help but point out that the movie will probably only
appeal to fans of Shakespeare's work.  I also found
parts of the story weak.  I questioned the need for
Titus's brother, lamented that the deliciousness of
the Saturninus character (my favorite character) fades
away as the film progresses, and found the ending to
transpire too quickly given the dialogue-heavy
structure of other vital scenes throughout the movie. 
In the theatre where I saw this, many were moved by
the events that unfolded on the big screen.  Others,
however, slept soundly until the lights went up.  I
was sometimes at a loss, primarily due to my inability
to fully comprehend "Shakespeare-speak".  But, I was
impressed with what I saw.  I sat up and took notice. 
And, this film certainly deserves to be recognized.

This film version of William Shakespeare's oft-overlooked first tragedy
is a glorious mess.  Titus, based on the Bard's Titus Andronicus, is an
audacious, frantic jumble of images cobbled together like a music video,
and the result is a bit like The Fifth Element  a highly enjoyable
picture that seems way too over-the-top for its own good.  But Element
had the common sense to wrap things up around the two-hour mark, while
the meatier Titus keeps you in the theatre for another thirty-plus
minutes.
Titus opens with one of the year's more amazing scenes.  The film begins
with a child playing with plastic action figures in his kitchen.  The
boy, who has a paper bag over his head, proceeds to pick a food fight
with his toys as the room explodes and a strange man bursts in to
transport the boy to ancient Rome.  It seemed more suited to a scene
from Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits than a Shakespeare film, but that's
just the point  this isn't your typical Shakespeare film.
Once transported, the boy watches as Roman soldiers return home from
battle with the Goths.  The scene is amazingly choreographed, as the
soldiers march into the center of town caked with mud that makes them
look like statues.  It's probably fifteen minutes before any dialogue is
spoken  and it's taken verbatim from Shakespeare's play.  If you find
it hard to follow, don't let it scare you off.  It will begin to make
sense, and the ending alone is worth a sore ass.
Titus Andronicus (Anthony Hopkins, Instinct) is the general of the Roman
Army, and the country expects the warrior to fill the position of
Emperor upon his return.  Titus declines and throws his support to the
son of the previous ruler, Saturninus (Alan Cumming, the voice of the
Devil in God, The Devil and Bob), over his brother and rival Bassianus
(James Frain, Reindeer Games).  Saturninus' first duty is to choose a
wife, and he picks Bassianus' fiancée Lavinia (Laura Fraser, Cousin
Bette), who refuses to marry the new Emperor.  For a second choice,
Saturninus drafts Tamora (Jessica Lange, Cousin Bette), the former Queen
of the recently defeated Goths, as his concubine.
Tamora, whose eldest son Alarbus was sacrificed to the Romans, is
hell-bent on revenge and eagerly accepts the role of Empress.  She
brings along her black lover Aaron the Moor (Harry J. Lennix, Get on the
Bus) and two wicked sons, Demetrius (Matthew Rhys) and Chiron (Jonathan
Rhys-Meyers, Ride With the Devil).  The sons are both after Lavinia,
while Aaron has schemes of his own cooking.  The boy, who we learn is
the son of Titus' son Lucious (Peter Gabriel lookalike Angus MacFadyen,
Cradle Will Rock), watches things develop as sort of a surrogate
audience.
Writer/director Julie Taymor, who recently directed the award-winning
Broadway hit The Lion King, has her actors deliver their soliloquies
directly into the camera, using extreme close-ups.  But that's far from
the only unique stamp Taymor puts on Titus.  Like the recent adaptation
of Richard III with Sir Ian MacKellen, this film has its way with time.
One moment, it's Caesar's Rome and the next it's World War II Italy.
The film also features some very modern sounding music, and many of the
characters sport tattoos.  And, Lord, is this film gruesome!  But
despite all of the gore, the more gruesome scenes are strongly implied,
instead of being shown on the screen.
As good as the acting is in Titus (Hopkins' role seems like a warm-up
for his next turn as Hannibal Lecter), the real stars are the
art/production/costume designers.  Taymor's crew features a bevy of
Oscar winners and nominees that have worked on films like Kundun, Dune,
The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, Chariots of Fire and Barry Lyndon.
Sadly, only Milena Canonero was recognized by the Oscars for her
incredible costumes.  I would have given her the trophy from the first
scene alone.
Titus is the second major accomplishment from a stage-turned-film
director this year, after Sam Mendes' (The Blue Room) critically
acclaimed American Beauty.  What would make such successful stage stars
run for the hills of Beverly?  I did hear that Kathie Lee was on
Broadway.
2:42 - R for graphic violence, nudity, implied rape and, well, just
about everything except adult language

        If you thought Baz Luhrmann's radical take on
_William_Shakespeare's_Romeo_+_Juliet_ was wild, wait until what you
see what Tony Award-winning stage director Julie Taymor
(_The_Lion_King:_The_Broadway_Musical_) does to the Bard's
_Titus_Andronicus_ for her audacious--and very bloody--film debut.
While Luhrmann transplanted the star-crossed lovers to 1990s Florida,
Taymor keeps this grisly tale of revenge in Rome--but places it in a
surreal temporal limbo.  The Colosseum suggests the proper time of
Imperial Rome, but high rises and heavy duty kitchen ovens suggest the
1990s, while the vintage automobiles and some costumes are more '40s
and '50s, and other garments are more gladiator-like.  As Tamora,
Queen of Goths (Jessica Lange) exacts revenge on Roman general Titus
(Anthony Hopkins) for killing her eldest son, and he does the same to
her for the wrongs she commits, Taymor obviously wanted to express the
timeless relevance of the story's underlying themes.  However, the
time convergence approach only works at times, for often it's just
distracting, as in one scene where Tamora's suviving sons (Matthew
Rhys and Jonathan Rhys Meyers) blow off steam playing video arcade
games.
        Taymor didn't have to resort to such avant garde time tricks,
for the story would have resonated just as strongly had she jettisoned
them.  She is a strong storyteller and a master visual stylist, the
latter compliment encompassing all areas, makeup and costume choices
as well as those in the editing and photography departments.  She also
has a sure way with actors; Hopkins' Titus is at once tragic and
horrifying, and Lange is sultry as the viperous Tamora.  The clear
standout of the cast, however, is Harry Lennix as Aaron, a Moor who is
Tamora's secret lover and a schemer in his own right.  Lennix brings
great depth to a role that could have easily been played as a stock
villain.  A great villain he indeed is, but to leave it at that isn't
giving full justice to his powerful and multi-dimensional work.
_Titus_ isn't a complete success, but it is never less than
fascinating, and it announces the arrival of a fearlessly imaginative
new cinematic voice.

TITUS, based on William Shakespeare's "Titus Andronicus" (arguably
Shakespeare's least popular and most violent play), is brought to the
screen by Broadway director Julie Taymor ("The Lion King").
The movie is an audacious spectacle that blends a wide variety of
timeframes from ancient Rome to the modern day.  Other directors have
shown in the last few years that more modern adaptations of Shakespeare
can work marvelously well.  Richard Loncraine's RICHARD III and Baz
Luhrmann's ROMEO + JULIET were lucid and involving tales based on the
Bard's works.
Taymor's bold picture outdoes the others in production design and
choreography.  What it lacks is a cohesive structure and perspicuous
storytelling.  Her vision is as murky as the others were
straightforwardly appealing.  To be fair, "Titus Andronicus" isn't
exactly a play in which any of the lines are familiar.  One could argue
that the play's obscurity is well deserved.  Some have even argued that
Shakespeare wasn't the author anyway.
The film's casting is superb, even if the acting isn't at the level that
you would expect from such a talented group of actors.  Anthony Hopkins
rants and raves his way through the lead role as Titus Andronicus.
Titus is a pretty vicious guy, a part that is a natural for Anthony
'Hannibal Lecter' Hopkins.  Titus happily and gorily has his hand
chopped off so that he can swap it for the heads of the two young lads
who abused his daughter, Lavinia (Laura Fraser).  Lavinia has had both
of her hands chopped off and tree branches planted in their place.  She
also lost her tongue to the knife.
Jessica Lange plays the evil Queen Tamora.  Having the most fun of all,
Alan Cumming preens on the stage as the Emperor Saturninus.
The wonderfully inventive and massive architecture looks as if it were
designed by Nazi architect Albert Speer.  The costumes are to die for.
Queen Tamora gets gold body armor with a large push 'em up bra.  It
looks so heavy that it's amazing that she can stand up without falling
over.
Among the story's many in-jokes is the radio station that covers the
Emperor's broadcasts -- SPQR News.  If you don't know what SPQR stands
for, you should have paid more attention to history when you were in
school.
One of my favorite episodes is the one that starts the film.  In it is
planted the hint that what might have saved Rome from its infamous fall
was better toy action figures.
Trying to describe my feelings about the film, I kept thinking of how my
son describes such situations: "It was -- well -- innnnnnnnnteresting."
Although I personally found much to admire in TITUS's sets, music and
costumes, I can't bring myself recommend the film itself.  My suspicion
is that the average moviegoer will hate the picture.  Shakespeare buffs,
on the other hand, will certainly want to give the picture a try and
judge for themselves whether Taymor's effort is worthwhile.
TITUS runs a long 2:42.  It is rated R for strong violent and sexual
images and would be acceptable for older teenagers.

     Personally I think I need to see another production of HAMLET
about as much as I need to see another production of A CHRISTMAS CAROL.
Which is to say, not very much at all.  The same few number of
Shakespeare's plays seem to be done over and over.  The value of seeing
Shakespeare's good plays is somewhat compromised by their over-
familiarity.  There may be a lot more of interest in seeing one of his
minor plays that never get seen.  Of Shakespeare's 39 plays (the
current count) it seems only a handful regularly produced.  Most of the
rest are rarely seen.
     TITUS ANDRONICUS is nearly universally considered to be
Shakespeare's worst play.  It is a horror tale of revenge as a Roman
noble and a captured Goth Queen wreck terrible revenge on each other in
Imperial Rome.  Academician Harold Bloom suggest that the play was
never meant to be taken seriously and was Shakespeare's attempt to
lampoon the pre-Grand-Guignol blood and thunder plays popular in his
day.  Humble film reviewer Mark Leeper suggests that Bloom may have it
backwards.  It may well be an effort to demonstrate that even violent
horror plays of the time might be written with poetry, grace, and
magic.  Is it so different from Stanley Kubrick attempting a Stephen
King horror story complete with elevators flooded in torrents of blood?
TITUS is reminiscent of Peter Greenway doing what could be a TALES FROM
THE CRYPT episode in operatic style in THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE,
AND HER LOVER.  In any case TITUS ANDRONICUS is a play rarely performed
and though it will not be for all tastes it is one that for many of us
should be seen because it is a hoot.
     In ancient Rome soldier and noble Titus Andronicus (Anthony
Hopkins) returns from the wars with the Goths bringing with him the
Goth queen Tamora (Jessica Lange) and her three remaining sons.  Titus
has lost twenty-one sons and has only four left.  He orders the ritual
execution of one of Tamora's sons as a final act of vengeance.  Chance
makes Tamora the wife of the new emperor Saturninus and she will have
a gruesome revenge against Titus only to have him exact an even
sterner vengeance against him.
     Julie Taymor, who adapted THE LION KING for the live stage,
adapted the play and directed with a strange visual sense that cuts
across the centuries.  This is a world that combines the legions of
ancient Rome and vehicles and clothing of 1930s Fascist Italy.
Taymor's visual sense lies somewhere between Fellini's SATYRICON and
the Planet Mongo in a sort of filthy corruption of former splendor.  As
Tamora's vengeance seems to involve body part--heads, hands, tongues--
so too there are body parts sculpted in stone as a recurring theme in
many of the visuals.
     Taymor opens the film with the image of a child playing with toy
Roman soldiers.  The boy is dragged from a modern kitchen to a pavilion
in Rome where human-sized toy soldiers march in mechanized lock step.
This maybe suggesting that the play's violent plot is the product of a
child's imagination.  However she does fill the film with a generous
dose of surreal dream sequences and obscure symbolism that would leave
Shakespeare terminally confused.  I suppose she could claim that she is
not making the film for HIM.
     Jessica Lange, who started her career unable to fulfill even the
most demands of the damsel in distress in the 1976 KING KONG is now one
of the most talented American actresses and is now more than equal to
Shakespearean roles.  Her Tamora physically evokes the visage of a
Gorgon.  In spite of a few role choices of late that I believe even she
regrets, she is now back on track taking difficult roles and doing them
well.  Hopkins has the reputation, but he plays Titus entirely too
blandly, falling back on some Hannibal Lector mannerisms in the hope
they evoke chills.  For my money Lange stole the film from under him.
Alan Cumming is hardly memorable as Saturninus.  He may be remembered
as the pen-clicking Russian computer hacker from GOLDENEYE.  Aaron,
played here by Harry Lennix, is not very believable, due more to
Shakespeare's writing than his acting.  Like the Jew of Malta in
Marlowe's play he lives just to be evil.  Few people see themselves as
just living to cause trouble.
     TITUS is probably not going to be remembered as one of the great
Shakespeare films.  It is more a novelty, a Shakespearean horror tale.
How often do we get a TITUS CHAINSAW MASSACRE or a TWELFTH NIGHT OF THE
LIVING DEAD?  I give it an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +3 on the -4 to
+4 scale.

DIRECTOR:  Julie Taymor
WRITTEN BY:  Julie Taymor, William Shakespeare (play "Titus Andronicus")
If Tales From The Crypt had been around in the sixteenth century,
William Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus would have made a perfect
episode.  One of the Bard's earliest and least-known plays (written in
his formative stage before 1599), it's a nasty little tale of betrayal,
murder, and revenge that still packs a shock-value wallop.  In bringing
her stage adaptation to the screen, theater director Taymor (best known
for her Broadway version of Disney's The Lion King) admirably doesn't
shy away from these lurid elements.  In attempting to tinker with the
original play's ancient Roman setting, however, she has created a film
that is at once mesmerizing and preposterous, fascinating but ultimately
frustrating.
The story centers around Titus Andronicus (Hopkins), a victorious
general who returns to Rome with several prisoners in tow.  These
include Tamora (Lange), the vengeful Queen of the Goths, her three sons,
and her lover, a dark-skinned Moor named Aaron (Lennix).  All of these
captives will eventually spell disaster for Titus and his family.  In a
typically Shakespearean turn of events, Tamora ends up marrying the
newly crowned Emperor Saturninus (Cumming), and promptly proceeds to
take revenge on Titus for killing her firstborn son as a sacrifice.  By
the time Tamora and Aaron are through, three of Titus' sons are dead,
another banished from Rome, and his daughter subjected to particularly
gruesome atrocities.  Naturally, Titus is devastated to the point of
insanity, but he keeps it together long enough to cook up a revenge
scheme that would make the Crypt Keeper proud.
In terms of interpretation, Taymor's adaptation is brilliant.  She
stages scenes with a mastery that truly brings the play to life, and she
gets performances that are solid all around.  As the duty-bound Titus,
Hopkins plumbs depths of despair and madness with riveting presence.  As
the irredeemably evil Aaron, Lennix skillfully avoids caricature, and
Cumming makes a memorably snide and capricious Saturninus.  Lange, in
her first Shakespeare role, gives Tamora the benefit of her age.  In bed
with Saturninus and her sons, the Goth Queen radiates an almost
incestuous sexuality.  Despite the occasional accent slip, Lange holds
her own against Hopkins and the rest of the exceptional cast.
Unfortunately, Taymor can't resist the urge to customize the play's
original setting.  While she isn't the first director to try it (see A
Midsummer Night's Dream), she does such a poor job that it nearly
torpedoes the entire film.  She seems to be striving for the sort of
uniquely indeterminate time frame that Terry Gilliam (Brazil, The Fisher
King) does so well, but too much of the production design is merely
clumsy anachronism.  Every time the story threatens to become totally
engrossing, a motorbike or an arcade videogame or a shotgun will
suddenly appear as an irritating distraction.  Worse yet, the character
of Young Lucius (Titus' grandson) acts as a surrogate audience
throughout the film, undermining the effectiveness of nearly every scene
he's in.
While these touches are more artifice than art, they thankfully don't
outweigh the film's merits.  Titus is worth seeing for the performances,
and for Taymor's confident interpretation of the dialogue.  Besides, as
the Crypt Keeper would say, "there's plenty of meat to the story, boils
and ghouls."  Heh heh.

"Do I see it or do I skip it?" I suspect that many readers of reviews 
check this out by cutting to the chase and just checking the critics' 
ratings by stars or letters.  Sometimes this tactic is valid, but it 
does not work for unusual items like "Titus." What's  needed in such 
cases is the equivalent of computer-dating -- matching the movie and 
the personality of the movie-goer.
"Titus" is not the kind of Shakespeare that one would rush to see on 
the stage. Its screen progenitor Julie Taymor has done the next best 
thing: making it a wild sight-and-sound spectacle. Her challenging, 
hugely idiosyncratic production is unlike anything else. It stands on 
its own feet, Roman sandals or Gucci shoes. At three hours minus 
eighteen minutes it is not recommended to the mainstream  public or 
the faint of heart,  but for cognoscenti there is a definite 
enrichment.
Ms. Taymor, admired for her fanciful theater-staging of Disney's "The 
Lion King,". also did a quirky "Titus" off-Broadway around 1994. 
"Titus-the-movie" is a specialty picture. It is for those who follow 
no-holds-barred experimental avant-garde. For Post-modernists who 
specialize in Shakespeare and are curious to see what Ms. Taymor did 
with, and to, the Bard. For some of the many students who never read 
"Titus Andronicus," a work which always been at the bottom of the 
pile of assigned Shakespeare -- assuming it was placed on the list at 
all.
The story revolves around Roman General Titus who returns after a 
great victory over the Goths. He brings prisoners, QueenTamora among 
them. (Her name looks like a version of "Taymor"). Hewing to a jolly 
tradition, he executes her oldest son.
Titus declines to be crowned Emperor. Instead, he nominates foppish 
Saturninus. But the  General modesty and generosity are repaid with a 
maze of political plots, counter-plots, machinations, assassinations, 
rivers of blood and cut-off body parts.
The play, a very early one by William S., is his most gory and 
violent. The film's extra-vivid visuals make it even bloodier. To 
mention merely three gruesome occurences,  Titus's daughter who gets 
raped by two young men before they cut off her hands. Titus's 
self-mutilates.. He cooks up the now-butchered rapists as meat pies 
served to unsuspecting Bad People.
The over-the-top play becomes a topping-the-topper movie. Not a sight 
for sore eyes but a sight to make the eyes sore. Ms.Taymor takes 
Shakespeare's feverish imagination and keeps adding to it. The "less 
is more" principle of the Weimar Republic's Bauhaus ushered in 
modern, simple, functional design. The slogan for this movie should 
be "more is more."
"Titus" was shot in Italy, with some parts in Croatia.. Its 
production credits are a Who's Who of abundantly imaginative, 
audacious collaborators. They are  mostly Italian. The main exception 
is a French woman: veteran, international and eclectic editor 
Francoise Bonnot. She has been cutting films since 1962, including 
six by Costa-Gavras (down to his latest, "Mad City"). Among the 
non-Gavras pictures are  "Black and White in Color," "Un Amour de 
Swann," Polanski's "The Tenant," "The Year of the Dragon." "Titus" is 
a big stretch for Ms. Bonnot, with its surrealism at opposite poles 
to the realism of her past labors.
Julie Taymor's tactics are something like "Anachronism as Art." In 
the demented sights of her film we get automobiles brushing against 
Roman legionnaires, toga-clad people smoking cigarettes, modern 
priests among breastplated warriors, a T-shirted boy,  tuxedo-wearing 
adults among ancient garb, a huge modern bank safe, helmets with 
delirious ornaments, modern jazz, boogie woogie, sundry methods of 
torture, assault rifles, revolvers and poniards....
That's just a sampling. There's also the make-up such as that for 
centurions with  ash-covered faces who march like computer-made 
creatures. Additionally, shots or scenes may remind you of Federico 
Fellini's outlandish faces and bodies; or of his streetwalkers in 
"Nights of Cabiria."
What obviously Ms. Taymor had in mind was to modernize Shakespeare 
while showing his undiminished relevance. She establishes many 
parallels to contemporary (and eternal) politics, maneuvers, tricks 
but no treats. Her references run from the non-glory that was Rome to 
Italian Fascism, dirty deeds, inhumanity, and other such niceties of 
our times
Fantasy has no limits.. And there's the rub. The uncompromising 
excesses are --for what they are -- spectacular, perhaps admirable, 
certainly novel. But they also distract. You don't concentrate as 
much as you wonder whilst the layers of visuals often cover up the 
language.
Above all, Shakespeare is words. His text for "Titus Andronicus" is 
not while not as stupendous as that of  his mature plays, yet is 
still replete with great lines and verse. But I could not always 
catch them. For several reasons.T he one mentioned above. The 
unfamiliarity with the play, even if one has read it before. The 
torrent of words delivered with    rat-tat-tat speed. The accents of 
players who are British, Americans trying to sound British, or Brits 
trying perhaps to sound un-British.
I miss my beloved Oxbridge or BBC accents, especially the amazing 
clarity of Laurence Olivier's euphonious, sonorous, mesmerizing voice 
in his Shakespearian plays and films, in fact in everything else the 
man performed. Also in his narrations, as for "The World at War." For 
that matter, I miss too the voice and delivery of Orson Welles.
In counter-argument to myself I'll admit that while "Titus" needs 
state-of-the art sound equipment, acoustics and audio balance, these 
were not available at the auditorium where I saw this work.
In the audiovisual orgy that is "Titus,":the players range from good 
to excellent in their peculiarly styled roles. Cast leaders Anthony 
Hopkins and Jessica Lange do not sound traditionally 
"Shakesperean,"only semi so. This fits the staging. For Lange  (who 
becomes the new Emperor's consort) and for many of the actors, the 
defining word is "malevolence." Tamora paves the way for Lady 
Macbeth, who by comparison is almost  a sweetie.
The grandest schemer-plotter of them all is Aaron the Moor, played by 
black actor Harry Lennix. He is also Tamora's lover and, in a modern 
way, the main hater of the Establishment and its prejudices. I 
suppose that Shakespeare had a change of heart later when, way ahead 
of his time, he championed minorities such a Jews and blacks. In 
"Othello," the great soul is the Moor of Venice, while the villainous 
Iago is a nasty white man who in some ways inherits Aaron's 
trickeries and treacheries..
Influences or inspirations last to the very end..The last shot is a 
freeze- frame, the kind that Francois Trufaut's "The 400 Blows" made 
so very popular that it became a cliche. Here however, this deja vu 
is mitigated by a clever aural trick. "Vivere," one of the many songs 
by the famous Cesare Andrea Bixio is heard over the end- 
credits..There is no Italian alive who does not know  all Bixio's 
compositions, no Italian tenor who has not sung or recorded them, 
from Tito Schipa and Feruccio Tagliavini to Luciano Pavarotti..The 
singer here is Carlo Buti, in an older, original recording.. All this 
may sound like a detail, but for Italian audiences, "Vivere" which 
means "To Live," makes a melodiously ironical "finis."
NOTE  for lovers of popular Italian music.  Bixio (1896-1975) was 
prolific, had major hits throughout his whole life. Starting with the 
first Italian sound movie "La Canzone dell'Amore" (1930) most, 
perhaps all of his songs were introduced in films. His best period 
was 1930 -1940, with tremendously popular pieces at home and in most 
of Europe:  "Parlami d'amore, Mariu," "Violino Tzigano," "Torna 
piccina mia," "La mia canzone al vento,"  "Mamma,"  "Vivere" and 
others.

Shakespearean acting for a modern filmgoing (read:
non-Olde-English-speaking) audience presents its own set of
difficulties. When you're sitting in high school English class taking
turns reading Hamlet out loud, the kid three rows down from you
doesn't know whether to inject bitter sarcastic irony or sincere quiet
remorse into Polonius' next rhyming couplet. In that kind of setting,
it's pretty easy for the words to lose their meaning entirely, turning
the pages upon pages of iambic pentameter into a tired, monotonous
exercise in outdated grammar.
Since I don't have any other criteria to judge such an unfamiliar
acting style, all I can really do is ask myself if I understood what a
character was saying even if I didn't fully grasp all the words. If
there's one thing I've learned from reading Shakespeare's stuff, it's
that the delivery is as much a part of the meaning as the words
themselves. So using the Uncertified Sean Scale of Shakespearean
Performance: the acting in Titus rates as truly exceptional all across
the board. Veteran Anthony Hopkins leads the pack as the title
character; Jessica Lange plays Tamora, Queen of the Goths, with
vicious cunning, while Alan Cumming struts and frets upon the stage as
the whiny, manipulative newly-crowned Emperor Saturninus as if he's
loving every minute of it. And, to be fair, Taymor's pacing and visual
decisions are equally responsible for Titus' success in the
clarity-for-us-common-folk department.
So what, then, holds Titus back from greatness? With so much in place
that's so wonderfully right, what exactly went wrong? Well, here's
something you don't hear a lot when it comes to a Shakespeare
adaptation: all of Titus' problems come straight from the source.
Before I get into this, let me tell you that I feel woefully
under-qualified to criticize Shakespeare... my experience boils down
to reading a couple plays in high school and watching a couple movie
adaptations in college. After leaving this particular film, I figured
that anything that didn't quite jive in my head was just a result of
my untrained ear missing the Bard's point. But poking around a bit
afterward, I soon discovered that Titus' flaws are almost universally
agreed upon by Shakespeare's critics - some go so far as to say that
the play is so bad, it's probably not even Shakespeare's to begin
with. So armed with that knowledge, I feel confident enough to point
out what I myself found wrong with Titus Andronicus...
The biggest issue lies mainly with the principal villain, Aaron - an
orchestrator of evil for evil's sake. The point of the play seems to
be that a single act of violence can beget a chain reaction, until
everyone involved lives only to exact vengeance before someone in the
other party can do it first...  a point that could have been more
effective without Aaron's unmotivated designs.  Don't get me wrong,
he's exquisitely played (here by Harry Lennix), it's the way he's
written that's the problem.
Even Titus himself is an uneven character - at one turn he is a
duty-bound soldier, loyal to Rome despite all the wrong that the City
does to him. He backs an Emperor that he couldn't possibly like time
and time again, even when it hurts his family and friends, and his
early motivations are difficult to sympathize with. He does something
horrible early on to one of his sons that dulls the edge of what
sorrow and hatred he's supposed to feel later.  Sometimes Titus seems
absolutely crazy (shooting arrows into the sky bearing messages to the
gods), and the next he seems extraordinarily clever (the revenge he
stages in the end), but all his plans and inspirations are pretty much
random in the end... A credit to Hopkins that he seems to understand
Titus as much as he could possibly be understood. Some critics argue
that Titus Andronicus is supposed to be a black comedy (like I was
hoping to find) rather than a tragedy (it isn't quite that either),
but if that's the case, I didn't find a whole lot to laugh at.
Could Taymor have "fixed" some of these problems? Certainly. A better
question is should she have? Perhaps an even better question is did
she even want to?  What adjustments she tries to make are purely
theatrical ones, and while they mostly hit the mark, sometimes they
don't quite seem to work... the film opens with a scene showing a
modern child playing violently with a pile of action figures and war
toys in his kitchen. The kid sticks around for the remainder of the
film, first as a silent witness; but then he gradually (and
seamlessly) becomes an active participant in the horrid affair as one
of Titus' grandsons.  Is Taymor just pointing out that violence has
always been around? Is she saying it's better to take out our
frustrations on toys and by beating the crap out of each other in
Mortal Kombat 5? I'm not sure... maybe it's a little of both.
Julie Taymor has done her beautiful best, and she's taken a great risk
(especially for a first-timer) to attempt to breathe life into a
lifeless play.  And the end result is something alive and original and
refreshing; so much so that it's honestly frustrating that Titus
Andronicus isn't a better tale.  The film never drags or has a moment
that feels like dead weight, even though Titus clocks in at nearly
three hours. Taymor and her devoted crew have left Shakespeare's words
untouched, and built upon them a lavish vision deserving of a better
foundation. Like Titus himself, they're loyal to a cause that simply
doesn't deserve their devotion.

There are some people who absolutely cannot understand Shakespeare. You either
fully grasp what is going on, you kind of get the picture, or you don't know
what the heck is going on. Unfortunately, I am a member of the third group. The
language in these type of films loses me completely, and while I was somewhat
able to identify the situations and main storylines for this film, it would be
lying if I didn't say I had several problems understanding the film and it's
message. (If it had one). It's a pretty bad thing to lose your audience for 162
minutes, even those who do know what's going on. But with the way this film
sets itself up, and the time period (if there actually is one) they are
supposed to be in makes it even more confusing for the common moviegoer.
Titus (Hopkins, who just can't seem to find good roles for himself) has
returned from battle and is faced with Tamora, (Lange) a mother of three sons
one day in his courtroom. He orders Tamora's oldest son killed, much to her
pleads of mercy. At some type of political election days later the charismatic
Saturninis (Cumming) revs up the crowd with a promising speech and pronounces
himself king (or something of the sort) in front of Titus. He plans to marry
Titus's only daughter, Lavinia. But refuses Saturninis's advances, and runs off
with the man she truly loves. So he must seek another bride. Tamora, feeling
the need for revenge for the death of her son, is willing to be wed.
And that's about where it all went downhill for me. Apparently Tamora is
sleeping with a black guard/prophet/something with weird marks on his face.
When they are discovered making out in the forest, by Lavinia and her lover,
Tamora's two remaining sons kill the man that Lavinia loved and Tamora tells
them to do what they'd like with her. They cut off both of her hands and tongue
and replace her former hands with branches. It is then that the games begin,
it's Titus vs. Saturninis and Tamora.
It has been a constant thing in films for as long as I can remember to worry
more about the look of the film, then the script of the film itself. It's never
been more apparent here. Director Taymor (who also directs the hit Broadway
version of The Lion King) packs her film so full of visual style that sometimes
it's too much to take. The film is up for a Best Costume Oscar, which it
rightly deserves. But there isn't much else going for this picture. The film
begins with a boy playing with action figures in his kitchen and suddenly turns
into a battleground for Titus's soldiers. The film seems to go in and out of
different periods of time. It's also very MTV for a Shakespeare play. While I'm
told this is one of his very early works, and probably the most mediocre of his
plays, I still doubt that Chrion and Demetrius (Tamora's sons) would listen to
rock music, hump the air whenever they dance, play pool, or suddenly turn into
rape and death, revenge's partners in a scheme to get Titus killed. (Don't
ask). And another thing, could someone please explain to me why the kid playing
with the action figures in the beginning of the film suddenly gets bigger,
becomes Titus's assistant, and starts speaking Shakespeare?
The marketing for this film happens is extremely misleading. The posters depict
the film as some type of historical saga with battles and a love story. In
fact, the trailer does this too. Do not be fooled. It was exactly the opposite
of what I was lead to believe. My major complaint in the film though, didn't
need any understanding at all. The entire picture was so horrifically violent,
and full of so many sexual images, that I'm surprised that the MPAA let it go
with an R rating.  There's nudity from every single member of the main cast,
sometimes you just see a character's butt, other times it's full frontal
nudity. Even though the film's dark subject, revenge, does deal with death and
pain, I really doubt the film needed to show a midnight orgy between countless
amounts of men and women. Since I didn't have a watch to keep checking, I must
have thought at least one hundred times, "When is this going to end?!" The only
other noteworthy thing here is an extremely strange type of ode to Hannibal
Lecter, Hopkins famous character from The Silence of the Lambs near the end,
but by then you'll probably just be wondering how much more of this you will
have to endure. Where did everyone find such an array of weapons? Why don't
people die when their hands are cut off? When is this supposed to take place?
Why were they using plastic? Don't ask these questions, this film won't answer
them.

Julie Taymor, who received both critical and popular acclaim
for her Broadway version of Disney's The Lion King, makes her film
debut with a curious adaptation of Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus, one
of the Bard's least successful plays. It's a graphic, grisly, gruesome
orgy of vengeance, revolving around Titus, a proud but aging Roman
general, played by Anthony Hopkins, who returns home in triumph
circa. 400 A.D. after conquering the Goths to crown the new Emperor
Saturninus (Alan Cumming). His prized gift to the new ruler is Tamora
(Jessica Lange), Queen of the Goths, whom the depraved Saturninus
impetuously marries - after being scorned by Titus's only daughter
(Laura Fraser). Along with her secret lover, a villainous Moor (Harry
Lennix), and her two punkster sons (Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Matthew
Rhys), the furious Tamara then schemes to wreak a crafty revenge on
Titus and his family for the ritual death of her oldest son at Titus'
hands. Cinematically, Taymor idiosyncratically links this historical
epic of political intrigue with the 20th century by incorporating a
contemporary lad (Osheen Jones) playing with toy soldiers. Working
with production designer Dante Ferretti, costumer Milena Canonero and
cinematographer Luciano Tovoli, the inventive Taymor sets out a
defiant, dizzying visual feast, crowned by a repulsive, cannibalistic
banquet that could have been created by Hannibal Lechter - and it's
impressively scored by Elliot Goldenthal. On the Granger Movie Gauge
of 1 to 10, Titus is a perversely stylistic, surreal 6. It's a bold,
bizarre bloodbath, giving us only fleeting glimpses of the tragic
characters who - in later Shakespearean plays - evolve into King Lear,
Lady Macbeth, and Iago.
