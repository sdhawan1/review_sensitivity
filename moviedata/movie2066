Reviewed May 22, 1999.
An honest, passionate, and ultimately mysterious note is the subject of 
Peter Ho-Sun Chan's romantic comedy-drama, "The Love Letter," based upon 
the novel by Cathleen Schine. There's a lot to like here, and even 
though it is only the start of the big summer movie season, it was nice 
to sit back, relax, and watch a movie about realistic people; it's just 
too bad the story surrounding the characters comes off as a mere 
contrivance, and that the supporting cast, all wonderful actors, are 
criminally wasted.
Helen MacFarquhar (Kate Capshaw) is a 40-ish single mother who lives in 
the quaint New England town with the dreamy title, Loblolly By The Sea. 
The fact that she has a young daughter is completely pointless to the 
film, since she is shipped away to summer camp during the opening 
credits to never be seen again. Helen works at one of those cute little 
bookstores that you only see in the movies; the kind that is constantly 
swarming with employees, but never has one customer. Maybe it's because 
the town is so small, or maybe it's because the residents are 
illiterate, or not big readers. Either way, how could they have the 
money to keep the shop in business? Anyway, one day Helen finds a love 
letter wedged between the cushions of a couch, and immediately believes 
that someone has written it for her. As she walks around the town 
daydreaming of all of the possible authors, she soon narrows down the 
list to George (Tom Selleck), a recently divorced father who has been 
her life-long friend, or Johnny (Tom Everett Scott), a 20-year-old 
college student working at the bookstore for the summer, who finds the 
note himself and believes it is from Helen. Things grow more complicated 
when Helen's best friend, Janet (Ellen DeGeneres), discovers the letter 
and suspects it to be directed for her, while Helen starts to doubt her 
blossoming relationship with the much-younger Johnny and sets her sights 
on the more mature, lonely George.
"The Love Letter" is a very well-intentioned and mildly entertaining 
distraction from life, but at a too-short 88-minutes, the distraction is 
not nearly long enough, and is unnecessarily slight. The screenplay, 
written by Maria Maggenti, is fine with what it has, but desperately 
needs more meat to it, as the movie stubbornly centers directly on 
Helen, while the rest of the intriguing characters are more or less 
pushed to the wayside. Still, there are a lot of nice moments and a 
subtle deeper meaning that shines through with a quote that appears on 
the bookstore's chalkboard late in the film. Although the writer of the 
love letter is eventually discovered, the movie probably didn't even 
need to resolve such a thing, as the major thread running through the 
film is that of Helen's self-discoveries about herself, and her life. It 
was also a pleasant change of pace to include a conclusion that doesn't 
turn out quite as you might predict, but that is stronger because of its 
honesty.
Kate Capshaw, recently seen in numerous indie films ("The Locusts," "The 
Alarmists"), jumped onto the scene in 1984's rousing adventure, "Indiana 
Jones and the Temple of Doom" (where she met a guy named Spielberg and 
married him), but "The Love Letter" is her first major film vehicle in a 
long time. I like her, and yet it's funny how so many movies choose the 
most uninteresting character to be the center. This is exactly what 
happens in "The Love Letter," as all of the characters around her are 
more original, starting with Tom Everett Scott, as the young man of 
Helen's desires. Scott has stumbled lately in such mediocre fare as "An 
American Werewolf in Paris" and "Dead Man on Campus," but he has found a 
better role here. Playing off of him splendidly is Julianne Nicholson, a 
young woman closer to his age who has strong feelings for him, even 
though he's too concerned with Helen to really process it. But the 
absolute bright spot in the cast is Ellen DeGeneres, who is so very good 
in everything she's in that, if I were to make a movie, she'd be the 
first one I'd cast. She is the picture's comic highlight (as usual), but 
is not merely replaying her other characters, and has a serious scene 
with Capshaw that is perhaps the most powerful moment in the film. 
Meanwhile, Blythe Danner and Gloria Stuart (her first role since 
"Titanic") briefly appear as Helen's mother and grandmother, but have 
nothing to do, particularly Stuart, one of the sweetest old ladies I've 
ever set eyes upon. It's a real shame she was put in such a throwaway 
role, but does garner a few laughs in only her three scenes.
Like Loblolly By The Sea, "The Love Letter" is an enjoyable enough way 
to spend an hour and a half, but doesn't end up having much to offer in 
the way of substance. On Oprah this week, Capshaw said that when she 
read the novel from which this adaptation stems from, she fell in love 
with the idea of it becoming a motion picture and immediately joined on 
as star and producer (it probably didn't hurt that she is married to Mr. 
Dreamworks SKG). Either the book must have been infinitely superior, or 
Capshaw should have definately held out for a better project.

THE LOVE LETTER (M).  
(Dreamworks/UIP)
Director: Peter Ho-sun Chan
Stars: Kate Capshaw, Tom Selleck, Tom Everett Scott, Ellen DeGeneres, 
Blythe Danner, Geraldine 
McEwan, Julianne Nicholson, Gloria Stuart, Alice Drummond
Running time: 87 minutes.
This twee romantic comedy has been something of a labour of
love for Kate Capshaw, who is both star and producer.  Inevitably, it
is she who must also shoulder much of the blame for the film's
failings.  This surprisingly bland and ultimately uninvolving film is
set in the old fashioned and laid back, picturesque seaside village of
Loblolly By The Sea, and centres around a number of residents whose
lives are changed by an anonymous love letter.
Helen (Capshaw) runs the town's small bookstore, which
amazingly enough, survives even though it never seems to do any
business.  One day she discovers the titular epistle nestled in the
store's couch, and immediately assumes it was addressed to her.  She
hopes that it was written by George (Tom Selleck), the town's fireman,
who was also her childhood sweetheart before they went their own way
with plenty of unresolved differences still simmering between them.
Now that he is in the throes of a divorce, she hopes for a long
overdue reconciliation.  But she is a little surprised when she
suspects that it was possibly written by Johnny (Tom Everett Scott,
from That Thing You Do!, etc), the handsome college student working in
the bookstore for the summer vacation, who has developed a crush on
her.
A series of misunderstandings and liaisons follows, as several
other townsfolk are similarly entranced by the lyrical letter and its
mysterious author.  The script from Maria Maggenti (The Incredibly
True Adventure Of Two Girls In Love) is nicely done, but doesn't
really provide a lot of insight into this sleepy little town, with its
hidden secrets, or its eccentric inhabitants with their secret
passions.  Nor does it satisfactorily answer a number of questions
that continue to nag long after the final credits.
The ensemble cast try hard to breathe some life into the
underdeveloped script, but to little avail.  We know that Blythe
Danner is Gwyneth Paltrow's mother, but it takes some leap of the
imagination to accept her as Kate Capshaw's mother here.  Ellen
DeGeneres gets the bulk of the one liners as Janet, the co-manager of
the book store, a role that is not that far removed from the one she
played in her television sitcom.
This disappointing but mercifully brief film marks an
inauspicious Hollywood debut for acclaimed Hong Kong director Peter
Ho-sun Chan (Comrades: Almost A Love Story, etc), who handles the
material in an almost leisurely fashion.  Unfortunately, the film
lacks any real sense of passion, inspiration or heartfelt emotions.
This is one letter that should never have been opened!

  If you've seen the previews of coming attractions, you've
seem the best parts of Kate Capshaw's (Mrs. Steven Spielberg)
lackluster foray into producing. Set in a picturesque New England
coastal town, Lobolly By The Sea, this romantic fantasy revolves
around a mysterious love letter that is discovered by a number of
people. Kate Capshaw finds it first. She's the emotionally celibate
proprietor of the local bookstore and thinks it was written to her by
Tom Everett Scott, a hunky college student working there for the
summer. When her assistant, Ellen DeGeneres, discovers the anonymous
note, she thinks it was meant for her, sent from a gentle, goofy
fireman, Tom Selleck. (Which is odd, since Selleck obviously has a
long-time crush on Capshaw.) Then, while the local eccentric
(Geraldine McEwan) named Miss Scattergoods, bicycles around making
caustic comments, Capshaw's estranged mother (Blythe Danner) and
semi-senile grandmother (Gloria Stuart) arrive for a visit. Wretchedly
underwritten by Maria Maggenti and sentimentally directed by Hong
Kong's Peter Ho-sun Chan, this choppy, heavy-handed, slowly paced,
picture-postcard film disappoints. Ellen DeGeneres is the only one
with sense of humor but her self-deprecating wisecracks are derived
from her highly publicized off-screen life, rather than the story. And
there's no way Blythe Danner could be Kate Capshaw's mother, given the
obvious ten-year difference in their ages. Indeed, Kate Capshaw could
be Gwyneth Paltrow's mother. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
"The Love Letter" is a fumbling 4. Kevin Costner's "Message in a
Bottle" was a different spin on a similar story, released earlier this
year.

Cupid is running rampant in the quaint little fishing village of
Loblolly-by-the-Sea, arranging for people to accidentally discover the same
unsigned love letter.  The finders assume that the next person they see must
have sent it.
In THE LOVE LETTER by Hong Kong comedy director Peter Chan, this premise is
developed into a quirky romantic comedy.  The script by Maria Maggenti,
based on Cathleen Schine's novel, is peppered with cutesy dialog and
slapstick situations.  Choosing not to emphasize the romantic angle, the
film feels more like a pilot for a television sitcom than a movie.  Although
it certainly has its moments, the one-joke story quickly wears thin.
Kate Capshaw plays the earthy character named Helen at the center of the
tale.  Helen, who jogs like an Olympic sprinter, owns the small town's
bookstore.  Called a bitch, she's really anything but.  A recent divorcée,
Helen hasn't had sex in a long time, something her bookstore's manager,
Janet (Ellen DeGeneres), keeps reminding her about.  To Helen's
consternation, Janet likes to flaunt her sexual successes with her long
string of male lovers.
As the town's entire fire department, George (Tom Selleck) is a doofus
divorcé, who spends his time moving marauding moose out of kitchens and
smoking out unwanted bees from eaves.  Helen and George both wear old
fashioned, black horn-rimmed glasses.  The two of them dated way back in the
dark ages of high school.  Their precise number of dates is in question,
with the dispute based on what exactly constitutes a date.  He claims they
had as many four, and she argues for as few as zero.
Kate Capshaw, who personally optioned the rights to the book, chose to play
the first character to discover the letter.  Helen suspects that her young
hunk of an employee named Johnny (Tom Everett Scott) wrote the letter to
her.  With probably a thirty-year age difference, their romance would seem
doomed except he thinks she sent him the letter.  Passion easily overcomes
their age gap.
The letter will infect many others, but its effect will vary.  The movie
makes it too obvious who actually sent letter, although the details
surrounding it aren't divulged until the end.
Most of the picture is a near miss.  The romances are almost credible but
not quite.  The jokes ignite sometimes, with DeGeneres getting the best one,
but mainly they just sputter.
The movie tries to hard to be funny and not hard enough to be romantic, as
if its title should have been THE FUNNY LETTER.  Typical of these humorous
reaches is the local eccentric who lights her cigarette with a sparkler.
The shame is that the movie has potential and, with a little different
emphasis, could have been an unqualified success.
"Save me!" Helen tells the camera during one of her trying moments.  And
save us all from directors and screenwriters who can't create genuine
characters, ones worth more than a few giggles.
THE LOVE LETTER runs 1:25.  It is rated R for a little profanity, partial
nudity and sexual situations and would be fine for teenagers.

 There's one in every fiction workshop in college: the divorced mom
who's come back to school after 20 years to take some classes to help
her get started on her novel, which, as fate would have it, turns out to
be about a divorced mom who comes back to school after 20 years, wows
her fellow classmates, catches the eye of a hunky young professor and,
most importantly turns out a truly brilliant novel.
 Give one of these aspiring authors half a chance and she might turn out
something like "The Love Letter," a flaccid romantic comedy that proves
once and for all that (a) Kate Capshaw lacks the charisma to carry a
film on her own; (b) Tom Selleck should seriously consider setting up
"Magnum P.I. '99" instead of continuing to try to pass himself off as a
leading man on the big screen; and (c) it's time for Ellen DeGeneres to
finally move beyond the wink-wink lesbian jokes.
 Intended as an ode to the power of words, "Letter" is rarely worth
listening to, let alone watching, and matters aren't helped by
slice-and-dice editing that sometimes makes you wonder if the camera
started rolling in mid-scene or shut off before director Peter Ho-San
Chan called "cut." After awhile, the movie's utter lack of continuity
becomes much funnier than any of its attempts at humor.
 "Letter" is set in Loblolly By-The-Sea, the kind of provincial New
England town that exists only in lousy movies, a place where everyone is
intimately familiar with the plot of "Tosca," the local cinema runs a
Buster Keaton festival and the divorcee owner of a used book store can
somehow afford a sprawling mansion full of antiques. The divorcee in
question is Helen (Capshaw) who's managed to make it to her 40s while
still retaining the self-conscious tics of a schoolgirl. She's forever
tugging at her turtlenecks, wiping her nose with her hand and scurrying
mouse-like from room to room. For reasons known only to screenwriter
Maria Maggenti, most of the Loblolly men find this kind of behavior
irresistibly sexy, and when Helen comes across an anonymous love letter
brimming with passionate prose, she can't imagine which of her bashful
admirers might have sent it.
 Or perhaps -- since the letter had no addressee -- it was meant for
Helen's co-worker Janet (DeGeneres), a good-time gal who'd love to
kindle some flames with fireman George (Selleck). But George is hot for
Helen, who's somehow certain college student Johnny (Tom Everett Scott)
is her secret Romeo. The May-September affair that develops between
Helen and Johnny is a fairly interesting plot development -- especially
since Scott is by far the least irritating member of the cast -- but
Maggenti doesn't seem to have any idea what to do with it.
 So "Letter" soon drops that story thread in favor of giving us entirely
too much information about Helen mom's (Blythe Danner) and Grandma
(Gloria Stuart), both of whom are introduced with a burst of piccolo
music so you'll know right off the bat they're a nutty pair. No,
eccentricity is not in short supply here; as for laughs, charm and
passion, that's another story. James Sanford

 Starring Kate Capshaw, Tom Everett Scott, Blythe Danner, Tom Selleck,
Ellen DeGeneres. Rated PG-13.
It's actually not so bad that Dreamworks decided to release The Love
Letter at about the same time as Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom
Menace, because this way less people will have to sit through this
dreadful little comedy. And no, I really don't feel guilty about wishing
this movie death at the box-office. Really, I don't. Not at all.
The plot has been done before -- a mysterious, unaddressed love letter
shows up in a small town, causing confusion for everyone who reads it.
The center of the ensuing disaster is bookstore owner Helen (Kate
Capshaw, and by the way, what is it with bookstore owner main
characters? In the past year and a half we've seen them in Life is
Beautiful, You've Got Mail, this movie, and the upcoming Notting Hill),
who finds the letter in between couch cushions in the bookstore. She
immediately starts testing other people to see who it might be from, and
comes to the (incorrect) conclusion that the author of the note is a
young employee played by Tom Everett Scott. He, reading the letter
himself, assumes that she wrote it for him.
After a while, they fall in love (well, duh). Kate feels guilty about
getting in a relationship with someone more than twenty years younger
than her, and she also feels guilty because at the same time she is also
involved with the town fireman (Tom Selleck). To add to her turmoil, her
mother shows up (Blythe Danner, who apparently must have had her
daughter when she was about 9) and her trusted bookstore manager
(deadpan Ellen DeGeneres) quits.
Supporting characters aren't called supporting for nothing. Their
purpose isn't just to move the plot along, they're also supposed to give
the storyline a backbone. To do this, they must exhibit at least
marginal depth and must also be interesting. Rarely can a movie work if
it puts an interesting protagonist in the middle and surrounds her with
hackneyed, dull, cardboard secondary characters, especially when at the
core of the movie is the protagonist's various interactions with them.
This is The Love Letter's damning error. Capshaw's character is as good
as I have seen present in recent romantic comedies, but the people that
surround her are all either underwritten or purely one-dimensional.
Because of that, The Love Letter is awkward and insincere. Even worse --
it's a bore. I liked Capshaw and her Helen, but everyone else is
painfully fake, undermining the little drama or sexual tension that has
the potential to exist. There is nothing particularly hilarious about
all this either -- and besides DeGeneres' wisecracks, there's little
that is even a little amusing.
This is not a completely thoughtless film and director Peter Ho-Sun Chan
does a good job of portraying Helen's yearnings and various subtle
complexities. But it's far from profound. There isn't a common theme
running through the proceedings, thus the movie seems thoughtfully
pointless.
Really, this is a harmless little movie; it's far from an abomination
and it's not torturous to sit through. But bad, it is. Awful, it also
is. The Love Letter is a failure, and an inane failure at that.
Š1999 Eugene Novikov

A good love letter is hard to beat. Of course it's always nice to know who
it's from. In the small New England coastal town of Loblolly-By-The-Sea, no
one even knows who it's to.
Helen (Kate Capshaw) finds the letter between the cushions of her couch as
she's sorting mail. Assuming it's meant for her, she comes up with two likely
suspects: old friend George (Tom Selleck) or her college-aged employee Johnny
(Tom Everett Scott). The missive gets around and jump-starts a few other lovers.
The film is daring in a few quiet ways. Helen is forty-ish. Her romance with
the kid is believable and, like much of the movie, very European. Hollywood is
slowly, but surely, discovering that women past the age of 25 can not only be
beautiful, but legitimate objects of desire. Capshaw is a honey and Helen is
intelligent and witty. It's no wonder Johnny falls into bed with her at a
moment's notice.
But it's obvious there's something of a problem. "I've never felt this way
before," he tells her. "Of course not," she responds, "You're only 20."
Much of the tale seems a bit too familiar. Maybe if we hadn't recently seen
"You've Got Mail" and "Message In A Bottle", the anonymous letter notion might
seem clever. Like Meg Ryan's character, Helen is even a small bookstore owner
with too many employees and few customers.
Selleck doesn't add much to the film. The most interesting person in the town
is Miss Scattergoods (Geraldine McEwan), an older eccentric who uses a 4th Of
July sparkler to light her cigarette. Unfortunately she's only on screen for a
few moments. Ellen DeGeneres as Helen's friend Janet gets in some good lines.
At times "Love Letter" is like a gentle breeze from that New England shore,
but it's not a very fresh breeze.

   There may be some good reasons for living in a
picturesque small town but you'd never know this from seeing
"The Love Letter."  A film about a sleepy burg whose drowsy,
if eccentric, beings are awakened by an anonymous billet
doux, "The Love Letter" is so slight, so insipid, that a viewer
can scarcely find much therein to love or hate. Just a
spoonful of sugar less sweet than "Message in a Bottle," at
least director Peter Ho-Sun Chan's movie based on a novel
by Maria Cathleen Schine and adapted for the screen by
Maria Maggenti, does not take itself seriously.  Even Ellen
DeGeneres--who once again steals every scene she is in--
appears to sleepwalk her way through the tale, or at least
appears to do so when you compare her performance with
her work in "EdTV."
   "The Love Letter" borrows a technique used so
successfully in works from playwrights from Plautus through
Shakespeare and beyond--mistaken identity with the comic
and romantic touches that can emerge from such deception. 
The enigma in question centers on a mysterious writer,
although his or her identity (revealed in the final moments) is
not important.  What is consequential is the buried feelings
that some of the most unlikely characters possess and how
the possibility of having a secret admirer makes residents of
Loblolly, Massachusetts (actually filmed in that state's town of
Rockport) spring to life.
   When the owner of the town's bookstore, Helen (Kate
Capshaw), receives an unsigned, typewritten note professing
love, she assumes the dispatch is directed to her and begins
to fantasy who might be preoccupied with thoughts of her. 
When people speak to her in everyday terms, she imagines
their declaring unbridled passion.  She leaves the note by
a wine bottle where it is picked up by her dinner guest and
summer assistant, the twenty-year-old Johnny (Tom Everett
Scott), who is certain that the letter is Helen's and that it is
directed to him.  Gradually the note finds its way into the
hands of a few others in Loblolly with similar effects.  Among
the consequences is that a budding romance between Helen
and the town's firefighter, George (Tom Selleck) is rekindled,
but not before Helen works her way through a brief,
passionate affair with Johnny, who is twenty years or so her
junior.  In one swift month Helen turns from a stable, if
unfulfilled bookseller, to the bemused object of a triangular
relationship.  In the process she discovers a surprising secret
about her mother, Lillian (Blythe Danner) as well, and
uncovers a post card from an old shoebox which, if carefully
read some years back, would have dramatically altered her
life.
   At best, "The Love Letter" could provide for a career-
making opportunity for Tom Everett Scott, heretofore known
to the public only for cutesy roles in movies like Tom Hanks's
"That Thing You Do" and teen horror circuit adventures like
"Dead Man on Campus."  The story telling is for the most
part linear and conventional with Tami Reiker's camera failing
to exploit much quaintness is the town of Rockport.  Nor does
Ms. Reiker's camerawork paint a flattering portrait of Kate
Capshaw, whose wan acting cannot make a case for an
April-September affair with a college kid.  In her small role
Blythe Danner puts most of the remainder of the cast to
shame by her mere presence, as veteran Tom Selleck
appears so unenthusiastic in his pursuit of Capshaw's
character that his affection for her is even less convincing
than is hers for young Scott.  Finally, Bill Buell's cartoonish
performance as a keystone cop puts could put the lid on
tourism to Rockport.

     To your list of absolute cinematic oxymorons -- you know, like "Pauly
Shore comedy" or "Keanu Reeves performance" -- please add the following:
"bittersweet farce."  That's the disastrous combination served up by THE
LOVE LETTER, a film that fairly screams for a more frivolous treatment.
The basic set-up is pure farce, with bookstore proprietor and recent
divorcee Helen MacFarquahar (Kate Capshaw) of picturesque Loblolly by the
Sea, Massachusetts discovering a beautifully poetic love letter between
the cushions of a couch in her shop.  Both the the writer and the
addressee are anonymous, leading Helen to wonder if it might be for her.
Her suspicions become stronger when her young summer employee Johnny (Tom
Everett Scott) begins flirting with her, little realizing that Johnny has
spotted the letter and believes, in turn, that it is from Helen to him.
     Thus begins a tale which initially appears headed towards a wild
sequence of misunderstandings, as Helen's co-worker Janet (Ellen
DeGeneres) also spies the letter and suspects it to be to her from hunky
fireman George (Tom Selleck).  That might have been a clever, breezy
entertainment, something considerably less labored than the mess delivered
by screenwriter Maria Maggenti (from Cathleen Schine's novel) and director
Peter Ho-sun Chan.  Their tale is intended, I suppose, to be a touching
tale of a middle-aged woman trying to re-discover romance, a sensitively
portrayed May-December relationship mixed with the star-crossed
interactions of Helen and high school classmate George (who, it turns out,
has carried a torch from afar for lo these twenty years).  We should
understand the way the letter affects Helen, the way it closes one door in
her life and opens her up to the opportunities she has missed and the
opportunities still to come.
     If Maggenti and Chan had offered some characters remotely resembling
three-dimensional people, it might even have worked.  THE LOVE LETTER
makes no effort whatsoever to explain Johnny's interest in Helen, spends
about thirty seconds establishing Janet as little more than comic relief
before creating a blink-and-you'll-miss-it sub-plot regarding her jealousy
of Helen, and wraps up with an out-of-left-field relationship between two
characters about whom we know virtually nothing.  Key relationships (like
that between Helen and her absentee mother, played by Blythe Danner)
materialize out of thin air, and supporting characters (like Helen's
grandmother, played by TITANIC's Gloria Stuart) serve no purpose.  Even
Capshaw's Helen, the film's center, is an enigma.  For a film that
apparently wants you to care who ends up with whom, THE LOVE LETTER gives
you none of the tools to do so.  It's a whodunnit with no clues.
     Somehow, in the middle of this clumsy confection, one genuinely
interesting character appears.  As Jennifer, another employee of Helen's
who dotes on unrequitedly on Johnny, Julianne Nicholson is wonderfully
sweet and achingly self-conscious.  Masking her insecurities behind her
college course sociological analysis, she makes for a great character in a
story of how romantic happiness can be thwarted both from without and
within.  The troublie is, she's the only character in the film who belongs
in such a story.  Everyone else plays the kind of functional, cardboard
role you'd expect to find in...well, a farce about a love letter of
unknown authorship changing hands indiscriminately.  There's not a solid
laugh to be found in this pretty to look at but ill-conceived romantic
comedy, except at the idea that someone thought a bittersweet farce could
work.

"Do you know how in love with you I am? Did I trip? Did I stumble? Lose my
balance, graze my knee...graze my heart?"
Un-addressed and un-signed, Helen (Kate Capshaw) picks the love letter from
the countertop mess at her fishing town bookstore. Suspecting it sent by
Johnny (Tom Everett Scott), Helen's previously rusted libido gets a slippery
shot of hot oil.
But the love letter swims its way into the hands of other small town
characters with hearts of sufficient longing to similarly overlook it's
misdirection.
Splendid acting all around, the dialogue is also crisp. However, the overall
path of the film proves somewhat anticlimatic. Rather one dimensional in
it's intensity, the film could have used definition to it's dynamics.
Admittedly, this may be due in part to a three minute segment I believe was
lost at reel changes during my particular viewing. (Disclaimer: My grade
reflects only what I saw, not what I presume missing.)
Regarding the remainder of the film two scenes are extremely memorable: 1)
Before deciding Johnny is the author, Helen initially visualizes each random
passer-by reciting the letter to her in her daily life (from the local
police officer to a pick-up truck full of workman, tastefully filmed, this
serial interlude is wonderful film play.) 2) Janet (Ellen Degeneres) upon
hearing the news of a close-to-home homosexual love affair exclaims,
"Lillian in love with another woman? I can't believe it!" Again, this one
line reveals the good-humored nature of "The Love Letter."
That said, if you like "Murder She Wrote" you'll love "The Love Letter."
It's cute and quaint, funny and occasionally enduring ... makes a great date
flick too.

Signed, sealed and delivered as the estrogen alternative to that boy
behemoth known as "Star Wars," "The Love Letter" makes for smart weekend
counter-programming - but number this keen calendar positioning among
relatively few claims to brains. Still, it might go over, what with
women pining for a romantic refresher from all the "Star"-fueled hype,
some fairly imaginative marketing possibilities ("This weekend, make
Love,' not War'") and a curiosity factor stemming from the following
moral debate: Does Steven Spielberg catch the movie featuring wife Kate
Capshaw, "Letter"'s lead and producer, or the movie helmed by 800-lb.
gorilla pal and frequent collaborator George Lucas?
Actually, he's safe on both counts: Though Lucas' is the better film by
far, Spielberg would still be able to honestly compliment his beloved on
a job well done - especially since her easy-to-take performance breathes
dimension into a direly underwritten character. Capshaw looks and
performs great as Helen McFarquhar, a 40-ish divorcee and bookstore
owner in a picaresque New England hamlet called Loblolly by the Sea.
Life here is best described as leisurely, which is also a fine way to
summarize the movie itself. Perhaps "Letter"'ll play better on video,
where relaxed viewers can more so enjoy its sluggish (if sporadically
amusing) rhythms curled on their couch with iced tea and Melba toast.
During a mail sort on an already steamy summer day, Helen discovers a
four-paragraph profession of passion unsigned and anonymously dedicated.
At first, she assumes the collegiate hunk (Tom Everett Scott) she
recently hired for seasonal employment is pulling secret-admirer duties,
while he, thinking the exact opposite when the note floats into his
possession, flirts along aloofly. This relationship - the central story
thread of many - steers clear of heavy, "How Helen Got Her Groove
Back"-esque territory despite a considerable age difference between the
photogenic participants. If little else, at least "The Love Letter"
wisely doesn't present this fling as anything but lust amidst
dustjackets.
The titular typing then falls into a variety of other hands, each reader
figuring their own self as the intended recipient. This leads to a
gentle comedy of errors that gets less and less funny the further it
chugs along, diminishing returns which might have something to do with a
tart supporting turn by Ellen DeGeneres. As Helen's acerbic co-worker,
DeGeneres spouts off enough clever lines to keep the early scenes alive
and snappy, but suddenly - and all too soon - her screen time is
drastically reduced following a quickie quandary that's very indicative
of "The Love Letter"'s inability to develop matters to the fullest. The
movie only runs a scant 88 minutes.
With its ace joker temporarily out of the way, the film flails pretty
much through the end credits, though there are a few good scenes left
involving Capshaw and Scott. Tom Selleck, demonstrating appropriate
subtlety, shows up for just enough of the movie to ensure prominent
billing, but his role - an ex-beau of Helen's coping with mid-life
strain - remains at a frustrating distance. Class acts Blythe Danner and
"Titanic"'s Gloria Stuart also briefly swing by as Capshaw's mom and
grandmom, respectively, though their impact on the drama is, in one
case, non-existent, and, in the other, highly questionable. This cast
may be a keeper, but return the rest of "The Love Letter" to sender.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
The curtain goes up.  A single woman jogs on the beach.  She finds an
incredibly romantic letter that changes her life and then ships her kid
off so that she can concentrate on the note.  No, it's not the eagerly
awaited re-release of Kevin Costner's Message in a Bottle  it's The
Love Letter, Dreamworks' counter-programming for the Star Wars
phenomenon.
The woman is Helen MacFarquhar (Kate Capshaw, Indiana Jones & the Temple
of Doom), the owner of a small used bookstore in a quaint Massachusetts
burg - you know, the kind of shop that can afford to have several
employees, but not one customer.  She doesn't know who wrote the letter,
but eventually decides that it must be Johnny (Tom Everett Scott, Dead
Man on Campus), a college student working at the shop during the
summer.  Dopey Helen just leaves the life-changing letter out, and it is
discovered by Johnny, who thinks that Helen wrote it for him, and also
by co-worker Janet (Ellen DeGeneres, Goodbye Lover), who thinks that
George (Tom Selleck, In & Out), the hunky town fireman, wrote it for
her.
More disturbing than the asinine story is the fact that Capshaw, for the
second movie in a row, gets to bump uglies with a boy half her age (it
was David Arquette in The Alarmist).  Plus, she also served as a
producer for The Love Letter, so that means that real-life hubby Steven
Spielberg had to shell out his own dough to watch his wife run around
with younger, better-looking guys.  Anybody have Amy Irving's phone
number?  (1:28  R for adult language and an out-of-focus ass-shot of
Capshaw)
