A film retrospective by Karl Rackwitz (Berlin, Germany, 1998):
Directed by Richard Benjamin; With River Phoenix, Sidney Poitier,
Richard Jenkins, Caroline Kava, Richard Bradford, Richard Lynch
Here we have just another example of two fine actors wasted in a badly
written and weakly directed film.
The American teenager Jeff Grant (River Phoenix) applies for the
admission into the Air Force Academy. FBI man Roy Parmenter (Sidney
Poitier) examines Jeff's particulars and stumbles on contradictory
information about Jeff's parents (played by Richard Jenkins and Caroline
Kava). At the same time Parmenter works on another case: The former KGB
agent Scuba (played by Richard Lynch), who murdered Parmenter's
colleague 20 years ago, now commits a series of murders of Russian
agents to blackmail the KGB. Then KGB agent Konstantin Karpov (Richard
Bradford), who wants to catch Scuba, is seen in Fountain Grove, the
Grant family's place of residence. That makes Parmenter conjecture that
Jeff's parents are Russian spies. His investigations confirm this
suspicion. Jeff doesn't know of the espionage job of his parents. When
he is told of it by Roy, with whom he has made friends, he gets
thunderstruck. His parents - Russian spies?! Jeff's parents have been
living the life of ordinary American people for 20 years. They run a
garden nursery in Fountain Grove and use the false family name Grant.
Now KGB man Karpov instructs them, who are also potential victims of
Scuba, to become active again. They shall help in a surrender of money
organized to catch Scuba. The Grants don't want to take part. But Karpov
forces them by kidnapping Jeff ...
What may sound like an interesting idea, gets a disappointing film here.
"Little Nikita" doesn't nearly exhaust the opportunities of the subject.
It convinces neither on the level of Jeff's and his parents' identity
problems, nor in its treatment of the Cold War, nor is it a suspenseful
spy thriller.
The main problem of the film is its really weak screenplay (by Bo
Goldman and John Hill). We are told little about Jeff's girlfriend
although she doesn't seem unimportant in Jeff's life. The characters of
the parents aren't paid enough attention. The Russians are degraded to
cartoon characters. In short: The film can't be considered a serious
work. Yet it could have become an exciting film. It hasn't. The
screenplay is overly constructed and full of improbable incidents
leading to a totally unbelievable finale.
Another fatal problem is Richard Benjamin's clumsy direction, especially
in the action scenes of the film. An example is the weakly filmed scene,
in which Scuba makes a woman be run over by a ship. The directorial
flaws in the last 20 minutes of the film are much more serious than in
this scene. Benjamin's direction makes the implausible finale even more
absurd.
It is due to River Phoenix and Sidney Poitier that "Little Nikita" isn't
completely unwatchable. They give the film some interest and a little
bit suspense. Phoenix' performance is solid, partially fascinating,
although he sometimes tends to overacting here. His interpretation of
Jeff Grant hasn't the accuracy of his excellent performances in "Stand
by Me" (1986), "Running on Empty" (1987), "Dogfight" (1991) and "My Own
Private Idaho" (1991). Sidney Poitier is also quite good in the role of
the FBI man Parmenter.
There are some references to the bilateral policy of détente between the
Eastern and Western blocs. But to treat this theme convincingly it would
have needed a serious dealing instead of clichés.
After all "Little Nikita" is a disappointing film with some
entertainment value thanks to the two leads.
To all those who want to see better films starring River Phoenix, I
especially recommend the following film in his filmography, Sidney
Lumet's masterpiece "Running on Empty" (1987) in which Phoenix gives one
of the best performances of his career.
I give "Little Nikita" still a ** rating on the Maltin scale of four
stars.

     One of the most frustrating experiences one is likely to have in a movie
theater is to watch a good premise be ruined.  Of all the films that get made
in Hollywood (or anywhere else, for that matter), relatively few are based on
an idea that's worth mentioning.  Most are rehashings of films past --
sometimes well done, more often not.  So when someone comes up with an idea
that isn't totally familiar, you get your expectations up.  If they're
disappointed, you feel worse about the film than if it had been another rehash
of the same old junk.
     LITTLE NIKITA is a good case in point.  The theme of the film is rich in
possibilities: a typical American kid finds out that his parents are actually
Soviet agents.  A good writer could take this premise in a lot of interesting
directions.  We could see the film through the eyes of the kid, concentrating
on his world coming down around him.  It could be a mystery in which you aren't
sure till the last minute whether or not the parents really are the agents.
You could present the film from the point of view of the authorities tracking
the enemy agents.  You could even work from the point of view of the parents.
But the most critical point is that you have to have a point of view, and that
is precisely what LITTLE NIKITA lacks.  The film never decides whose story is
being told here, so it rapidly and repeatedly shifts gears.  The result is that
it never settles into any rhythm, and there is no consistent tone.  We never
find out whose story this is.
     If lack of focus were LITTLE NIKITA's only problem, it might have been a
flawed, but interesting, film.  Unfortunately, its problems are legion.
Richard Benjamin, who actually made a couple of good films early in his
directing career, is utterly incompetent here.  There is no suspense, no
tension, no consistency even of style.  He utterly botches the film's climax,
which doesn't make much sense anyway.  Cinematographer Laszlo Kovacs shoots 
what Benjamin asked him to well, but often the choice of what to shoot was 
badly mistaken.
     Also, beyond problems in viewpoint, the script is a mess.  The dialog is
either poor or pointless.  The plot makes little or no sense.  The characters
are dully constructed of cardboard.  Several writers, including Bo Goldman, one
of the most respected screenwriters in Hollywood, worked on this script.  All I
can guess is that they each threw some parts of the script out, and the
producers mistakenly got hold of all the rejected material and pasted it
together into the final form.  As presented on the screen, the script is
unbelievably amateurish and flimsy.
     The acting does little to help.  Sidney Poitier showed why he had been a
major star in SHOOT TO KILL.  Here, he shows why he retired.  Poitier 
flounders in the rotten part of an FBI agent trying to capture a renegade 
Soviet agent.  One moment he's the dedicated cop, the next he's playful and 
lighthearted.  He can't seem to decide whether he's doing IN THE HEAT OF THE
NIGHT or UPTOWN SATURDAY NIGHT.  Poitier plays each scene as if he had never
seen any other scene in the script, including those that were chronologically 
earlier.  Poitier is lucky that SHOOT TO KILL came out before LITTLE NIKITA, as
the earlier success will likely cause people to forget this fiasco.
     River Phoenix has nothing worthwhile to contribute to the part of the boy.
Of course, the script gives him little to work with, and Phoenix has been very
good in better parts, so his flounderings can probably be blamed mostly on
writing and direction.  Richard Bradford plays a Soviet agent as if he were
giving examples of overused spy cliches.  Richard Lynch, as the renegade, adds
yet another indistinguishable sadist part to his credits.  No real motivation
is given for his character, so he can probably be forgiven for repeated what
he's done often before.  None of the other cast members does anything worthy of
mention.
     LITTLE NIKITA could have been so much more than it is.  The realities of
Hollywood probably would have prevented it from being anything other than an
action/suspense movie, but it could have been a good one.  (Just imagine what
Alfred Hitchcock would have done with it.)  Instead, LITTLE NIKITA is a waste
of a couple of talented actors and an excellent idea.  It is utterly 
forgettable.
