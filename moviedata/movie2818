Recent flood of serial killer films from Hollywood might
tell otherwise, but the most fascinating category of movie
criminals is the professional assassins. This becomes
evident when the said assassins are the movie protagonists.
Filmmakers are often struggling to reconcile the morally
objectionable nature of the said profession - taking of
human lives in cold blood - and the almost mystical skills
that allow the assassins to remain professionals in the
first place. So, it's not very surprising that many films
end up mystifying and glamorising this immoral trade,
turning the hitmen as the incarnation of the "cool". For
some, 1980s Hong Kong action films started the trend, but
their inspiration came in the form of a film from another
time and another place - LE SAMOURAI, 1967 ultra-stylish
crime drama by great French director Jean-Pierre Melville.
The protagonist of the film is Jef Costello (played by Alain
Delon), hitman who is hired to kill Parisian nightclub
owner. Jef has never been caught, and this is due to his
methodical approach to the job - the contracts are always
arranged through intermediaries, the weapons and means of
transportation are always disposable, the hits are
well-planned while his girlfriend Jane Lagrange (played by
Nathalie Delon, Alain Delon's wife at the time) and couple
of underworld associates always provide nearly perfect
alibis. The plan unfolds almost flawlessly, except in the
moment when the lady pianist (played by Cathy Rosier)
happens to spot Jef immediately after the murder. Jef is
afterwards picked by the police among dozens of potential
suspects and quickly becomes the focus of attention of the
Police Superintendent (played by Franois Prier). The
pianist, however, for some strange reason fails to recognise
Jef and he gets released, only to become the target of the
assassination attempt himself. Jef, realising that the
people who ordered the hit are restless and want to silence
him, wants to find them and the pianist seem to be the key
to the mystery. In the meantime, he must evade police,
determined to find any excuse to put him back to jail.
At first glance, LE SAMOURAI looks like a film that in many
ways glamorises the profession of contract killer. Young and
charismatic Alain Delon with his fedora and overcoat looks a
predecessor of Chow Yun-Fat and other "cool" hitmen we have
seen in past few decades. But this impression is only
superficial. All those who allow themselves to be drawn in
the world of LE SAMOURAI would find that the film shows the
other side of the coin. The nature of the profession, with
the constant risk of capture by police or betrayal by
criminal associates, leads to distrust and constant
paranoia, and, in the end, the said individuals might look
glamorous, but inside they are lonely, emotionally crippled
and unhappy. All that can fill this emptiness is the job
itself, and the missing emotional links to other humans are
compensated with the perverted professional code, in some
way similar to Bushido (which Melville deliberately
misquotes in the opening scene of the film). This impression
could be read through the face of Alain Delon who never
smiles thought the whole course of the film, and whose stone
face hardly displays any emotion at all. The cold, grey
interior sets of his character's home, as well as rain and
cloudy sky over Paris creates the atmosphere that enhances
this effect.
Melville, stripped the story to the bone, in a same way he
did it with the title character. The other characters, even
those who are important to the story, are one-dimensional,
but this actually suits the purposes of this ascetic film.
There are few exceptions to this. One is the character of
Police Superintendent (superbly played by Franois Prier),
whose determination to bring Jef down leads him to
occasional emotional outbursts, as well as use of blackmail.
The other is character of Jane Lagrange, who allows herself
some genuine feelings for Jef and, consequently, protects
him against her better judgement. Although both of them
hardly display strong emotions under Melville's minimalist
style, those emotions are there, providing strong contrast
with Jef and his cold, sad existence.
The direction of the film, however, isn't as perfect as this
movie's almost legendary status would indicate. There are
some memorable scenes - the hit, police line-up, Jef's cat
and mouse game with police detectives in Parisian Metro, and
the great finale - but LE SAMOURAI, while being a truly
great film, is far from masterpiece. The main reason is in
the pace, which is at times unbearably slow, even for those
viewers accustomed to pre-MTV standards. There are some
scenes that seem overlong (especially the one featuring two
police detectives planting listening devices in Jef's
apartment), and because of them LE SAMOURAI sometimes looks
like a cure for insomnia. However, apart from those scenes,
LE SAMOURAI, with great acting, superb settings, simple and
effective story, remains one of the better examples of genre
cinema and it should be recommended even to viewers who
aren't interested in finding sources of John Woo's and
Quentin Tarantino's inspiration.

     There can be many reasons for re-releasing a motion picture.  In 
some cases, like STAR WARS, the motive is as much for profit as it is 
for artistic reasons.  The same claim cannot be made of LE SAMOURAI, a 
1967 thriller that has been cited by no less an authority than 
internationally-acclaimed director John Woo as a nearly perfect movie.  
LE SAMOURAI will not rake in money at the box office during this, its 
thirtieth anniversary re-release, but it will give a small legion of 
North American movie-goers an opportunity to see this landmark film 
uncut and in its full glory.  
     Woo is right -- LE SAMOURAI is close to perfection.  It combines 
stylish direction, an intelligent script, first-rate performances, and 
overpowering atmosphere into one of the most tense and absorbing 
thrillers ever to reach the screen.  In trying to identify a film with a 
similar impact, I'm left grasping at thin air -- nothing quite like it 
exists in the annals of motion picture history, even when considering 
the work of Alfred Hitchcock.  However, watching LE SAMOURAI makes it 
obvious that directors like Quentin Tarantino and Brian DePalma are 
familiar with this particular entry on Jean-Pierre Melville's resume.  
Its influence upon their work is evident.
     LE SAMOURAI is developed like a chess game between two equally-
intelligent, determined opponents.  One, Jeff Costello (Alain Delon, of 
PURPLE NOON), is an expert hit-man whose deeds are untraceable and whose 
alibis are unbreakable.  The other is a police superintendent (Francois 
Perier) who is sure that Costello is responsible for a recent murder.  
He believes that, with dogged persistence, he can catch someone in a lie 
or uncover some discrepancy in his suspect's story.  As the movie 
progresses and an apparent checkmate draws closer, the level of tension 
in LE SAMOURAI reaches an almost-unbearable level.  One standout 
sequence has Costello attempting to evade an intricate trap that the 
superintendant has set for him in the Paris Metro.
     LE SAMOURAI opens with a quote from "The Book of Bushido" (a 
fictional creation of writer/director Melville):  "There is no solitude 
greater than a samurai's, unless perhaps it is that of a tiger in the 
jungle."  The film then proceeds to illustrate how this truth applies to 
the protagonist.  Alain Delon's performance is subtle and mesmerizing.  
His expression never changes, but his eyes, his bearing, and the 
occasional trickle of sweat speak volumes.  Delon has an undeniable 
screen presence -- when the camera focuses on him, we cannot help but 
look.
     The first thing that strikes the viewer about LE SAMOURAI is likely 
to be the aspect of the film that leaves the most lasting impression:  
its incredible sense of style.  This is a black-and-white noir film 
photographed in color, with gloomy exteriors and dim interiors.  It's 
always raining or cloudy, and the most prominent color is gray.  Even 
when a room is brightly lit, the source of illumination is inevitably 
harsh fluorescents that leech the color from everything.  Visually, LE 
SAMOURAI is arresting, but the movie's stylistic preeminence doesn't 
stop there.  Melville draws us into the cold, cruel world of his 
protagonist by presenting lengthy stretches in which there is no 
dialogue.  The film opens with ten minutes of speech-free scenes, 
followed by a short verbal interchange, then two more minutes without 
dialogue, another brief conversation, three additional minutes without 
talking, and so forth... Melville does not clutter up his film with 
needless chatter, and, as a result, when someone speaks in LE SAMOURAI, 
we listen.
     Delon is supported by a fine cast.  Francois Perier plays the 
superintendent as a canny policeman who will do whatever it takes to get 
his man -- he can be charming or nasty, as circumstances demand.  
Delon's real life wife (at the time), Nathalie, who plays Costello's 
lover and alibi, is every bit as sexy as Catherine Deneuve.  And Cathie 
Rosier portrays Valerie as the perfect mix of the enigmatic and the 
alluring.  She's one of the mysteries that Costello must solve if he's 
going to outfox the cops.
     If you're a fan of film noir in particular or thrillers in general, 
you owe it to yourself to seek out a copy of LE SAMOURAI (it should be 
released on video after its limited theatrical run).  Despite its 
absence on many critics "best of" lists, this motion picture deserves a 
place at the pinnacle of the genre.  As John Woo indicated, it's 
difficult to imagine a much more accomplished film.
