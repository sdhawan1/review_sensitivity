"Mary Poppins" is a Disney musical comedy, intended to entertain
both children and adults.  Although the movie is overlong and
loses its focus towards the end, considerable charm remains.
The story features a well-to-do British family in the early 1900s.
Mother is busy fighting for women's right to vote, no-nonsense Father 
makes his living at the bank, and the two young children need
a Nanny.  To the rescue comes Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews).
She is "practically perfect in every way", and is magic as well.
Dick Van Dyke, a street merchant and chimney sweep, shows up 
now and then to help entertain the kids.
"Mary Poppins" has a nifty sequence that combines animation
and live action.  This fantasy may be the best part of the movie.
There is similarity between this film and "Peter Pan", another
Disney film where the children are entertained by a magic figure
who is only temporarily in their lives.  
If "Mary Poppins" is lacking anything, it is dramatic tension.  
The only resistance to Mary comes from Father, who wants to 
prepare the children for the "real" world of work and drudgery.  
With Father being so tiresome, Van Dyke serves as a surrogate,
more friendly and free-spirited.  Father does have a character
transformation by the end of the film, which could alternately
be considered a nervous breakdown.
The musical numbers have contagious melodies and clever lyrics.
They work well until a chimney sweep sequence that goes on
for too long and features synchronized dancing and singing by 
every chimney sweep in London.
