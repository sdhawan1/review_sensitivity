     Kid's films aren't what they used to be when I was a kid.  Thank
God.  Outside of one or two of the better Disneys, they were generally
populated by idiot adults, moronic plots and the general concept that
Kids Enjoy Stupid Humor.  Nothing was even vaguely frightening in one of
these; Joe Flynn dressed up in a sheet was about their level.  One of
the great pleasures one can glean from ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK is
remembering Kurt Russell in THE COMPUTER WORE TENNIS SHOES whenever
Snake Pliskin appears on the screen.  The only kids film I can remember
that seemed even moderately horrible was WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE
FACTORY, where the producers seem to have gotten in the spirit of Roald
Dahl's story fully.  The British seem to have more of a propensity for
darker children's stories than American film-makers.
     Somewhere along the line, though, the Brits' method became more
popular.  While cutesy-poo still dominates Saturday Mornings, there is a
breed of kids films out today which are darker, more sardonic, and more
importantly, intended to entertain adults as well as children.  Terry
Gilliam's less serious films (TIME BANDITS and THE ADVENTURES OF BARON
MUNCHAUSEN (sp?))  sort of set the standard in this category (arguably,
neither *are* children's films); THE DARK CRYSTAL and LABYRINTH, while
not as enjoyable to an adult audience, had their moments of real tension
and evil as well.  While each is built around a children's
point-of-view, more or less, the saccharine has been sucked right out of
the marrow, and you get a funnier, nastier, somewhat more edgy product
in the end.
     THE WITCHES is a fine addition to this sort of film, and given the
people involved, I'm not at all surprised.  First of all, the screenplay
is based on a book by Roald Dahl, a man who encapsulates the ability to
walk the line between spooky and silly.  Secondly, the late Jim Henson
was the executive producer, and he had shown the inclination in the past
to go beyond the niceties of SESAME STREET and THE MUPPET MOVIE and toss
a bit of darkness into the pot.  Finally, completely out of left field,
Nicolas Roeg directs, thus adding a wildcard factor into the whole thing
-- Roeg is one of the most unpredictable directors around today, both in
choice of subject matter and general quality of output.
     The opening of the film is marvelously spooky -- a young boy named
Luke is being warned by his grandmother about witches.  Various
attributes of witches are recounted (they have funny eyes, their hands
are always hidden in gloves, and children smell like dog droppings to
them.)  She also recounts a story from her childhood about a girl who is
taken by witches.  The boy is impressed (stogie-smoking Norwegian
grandmothers tell stories effectively); luckily for him, because later
in the film, he meets up with a whole mess of them -- including the
Grand High Witch, played to the hilt by Angelica Huston, who is really
getting *sick* of the smell of dogs droppings everywhere...  and has a
plan to make that particular problem...  smaller...
     The film is very enjoyable, though it never quite coalesces
together.  The individual elements work: the actors are fine (Huston,
Mai Zetterling as the grandmother, Jasen Fisher as Luke, Bill Paterson
in his typical overbearing style; only Rowan Atkinson seems a bit
underplayed, but after THE BLACK ADDER, he'd look underplayed as the
lead in DIE HARD); the script, which keeps the whimsey and the
wickedness in equal measure, and has that great rarity, a kid's outlook,
in the forefront throughout; and the special effects by Henson studios,
which has some of the most amazing puppetry I've seen in years.
("You'll Believe A Mouse Can Talk".)  
     The weak spot is the combinations of the elements, i.e., Roeg, and
also some of the camera-work.  The cinematography tends to be very
frenetic -- often reminding you of the "on-the-spot" style in HILL
STREET BLUES -- and the special effects shots are refreshing in their
comparative smoothness when they appear.  Also, the Halloween-ish feel
of the first part of the movie gives way to a busier, more
action-oriented ending where a lot of the atmosphere is traded for
comedy.  (Much of it rather gross humor -- the kind that kids *really*
enjoy.)  Given a choice, I prefer atmosphere, but the film has an
interesting ending and it only really loses steam for about 8 minutes in
the middle.  
     Not a great film, but a fun one, and certainly a notable entry to
the films that Jim Henson leaves behind him.  It might scare really
young kids at points; and if you have qualms about violence against
witches, be warned that they go beyond attacks with buckets of water in
this film.  Eight-year-olds, however, will eat it up, and their parents
will find it equally enjoyable, if for different reasons.

     We saw the last (SNIFF!) Jim Henson movie over the weekend, a
marvelous movie called THE WITCHES.
     THE WITCHES starts off in modern day Norway, with some fabulous
scenes of flight over the glaciers.  A grandmother tells her
impressionable grandson all about witches and how to avoid them.  His
parents are abruptly killed, and his grandmother takes him home to
England, and then to a seaside resort for a little vacation.
     The seaside resort is also the the meeting place for the annual
witches convention.  The grandmother recognizes an old adversary, and
the grandson stumbles over a meeting of the witches' annual meeting.
     In this movie, witches look much like regular women, except that
they wear wigs, elaborate rubber masks, and gloves.  When the meeting
begins, the witches "let down their hair" so to speak, and a room of
fairly normal-looking women becomes a gaggle of bald crones.
     As the Grand High Witch, Angelica Houston is given truly hideous
makeup in this scene.  She's a wonderful presence in the film, but she
speaks with a really awful Germanic accent.  That accent was one of the
few missteps in the film.  (I think the ending was a slight misstep too,
but, if Dahl wrote the ending that way, I'm not going to complain too
much.)
     Aside from the witch makeup, another wonderful bit of makeup
effects occur when people are turned into mice, an occurrence which
happens throughout this movie.  When the grandson and a friend of his
are turned into mice, the camera looks at the world from their
point-of-view---about 1/4 inch off the ground.
     I don't want to give too much away about this marvelous and
inventive film.  Go see it, and take the kids unless they are sensitive
or easily frightened.
     (This was X-posted to sf-lovers because I think THE WITCHES is
currently the strongest contender for the dramatic presentation Hugo
next year.  It completely blows BACK TO THE FUTURE III out of the
water.)

          Capsule review:  Jim Henson's last film is a charming
     modern fairy tale of a boy foiling a plot by the witches of
     England.  It captures some of the fun horror of traditional
     fairy tales.  Unfortunately, it loses some of its inspiration
     about mid-film.  The story would be ideally suited to
     animation and doing it in live action is an impressive if not
     altogether necessary feat.  Rating: low +2.
     The perfect medium for showing imaginative images visually is
animation.  With animation, if you can visualize it, you can put it on a
screen.  1973's FANTASTIC PLANET, while lacking in story values, may well be
the most visually imaginative science fiction film ever made.  Unfortunately
for animated fantasy, STAR WARS came out four years later and showed that
imaginative live action was coming of age and animated fantasy became a
sideshow.  Only the Japanese seem to recognize the possibilities of
animation as a medium for fantasy, and even in Japan fantastic animation is
falling short of the real potential of the medium.  In the United States and
Europe audiences want live action even if it is at the expense of
imagination.  Films such as BATMAN and DICK TRACY are trying to impress the
world with how well they can overcome problems that would not even arise
with animation.  DICK TRACY was able to make some expensive boxoffice stars
really look much like the comic strip characters.  BATMAN was less
successful visually in making Jack Nicholson look like the Joker.  Both of
these films could have had better stories and looked absolutely perfect had
they been animated, but they would have died at the boxoffice.  Audiences
really want live action and are quite willing to sacrifice story values and
imagination for the thrill of seeing things done in live action.
     THE WITCHES is a fine new live-action fantasy film that almost matches
in imagination and charm what Walt Disney was able to do with animation back
in the 1940s.
     Fairy tales are not all sweetness and fun, and they are not just for
children.  Most fairy tales are horror stories told on a level that all ages
can appreciate them.  And that is just what THE WITCHES is.  From the very
beginning this film lays down some blood-curdling folklore about witches.
Some of it is really the stuff paranoia is made of.  Witches can live right
next door, they smell children from great distances, they have no toes.
Take note, those of you who feel children must be protected from the sort of
scary stories that children have been raised on from time immemorial.  The
stories are told to young Luke (played by Jasen Fisher) by his Norwegian
grandmother (played by Swedish actor/director Mai Zettering) and it is a
good thing she told him.  He shortly has to fight a convocation of the
witches of England in their plot to turn all English children into mice.
And shortly is how he has to fight them, since he is one of the first two
children turned into mice.
     Jim Henson used his Muppet technology to portray the mouse Luke when he
does something non-mouselike.  When a trained mouse can be used, it is.  The
problem there is that the Muppet mouse has a cute face that the real mouse
apparently found very difficult to mimic.  The combining of realistic mouse
movements with a humanlike personality for the mouse would be, of course,
much simpler for Disney to do in animation than it was for Henson to do in
live action, and the result would have been much more successful.  The
makeup for the witches is similarly nicely executed.  Anjelica Huston's
Grand High Witch makeup fails to convince totally that this is really the
face of a living being, but it is well-detailed.
     THE WITCHES is, and is likely to remain, Nicholas Roeg's only
children's film.  (He claims he made it for his own newly-born child.)
Allan Scott's script, based on the novel by Roald Dahl, raises some
gooseflesh early on, but loses much of its power to chill once Luke is a
cute mouse and the story concentrates more on his mission than on the horror
of the witches.  Scott also manages to throw in some double entendres
clearly not intended for the younger audience.  In smaller roles there is
Rowan Atkinson (television's Black Adder) as a hotel manager clearly of the
Basil Fawlty style.  Bill Peterson (Dickie Bird in Bill Forsyte's COMFORT
AND JOY) plays the father of a mouse who once was a gluttonous child.
     It would be unfair to down-rate this film because it is not doing
anything to advance animated film.  The film as it stands *is* charming and
works (at least generally) in live action.  It is a nice fantasy and
deserves some credit for not aiming specifically at a youth or teenage
market.  It is just a decent fantasy film that is there for whatever
audience it finds.  I rate it a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.
