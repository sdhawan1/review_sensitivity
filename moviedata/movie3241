America loves convenience.  After all, we're the culture that invented
the cell phone, the 24-hour ATM, and my most beloved, the remote
control.  Yet perhaps this time, with Ghosts of Mars, we have taken our
love of convenience to far.
Ghosts of Mars stars Natasha Henstridge as a tough as nails,
pill-poppin', Martian cop, sent with her squadron to retrieve
"Demolition" Williams (Ice Cube) from a remote mining town for trial
back home.  When she and her comrades, appropriately dubbed "The
Commander," "The Rookies," and the guy with the cool accent discover the
town's residents slaughtered, they are forced to team up with Williams
to escape from the remaining residents' head-chopping, alien-possessed
clutches.
Filled with a lovely overuse of storytelling flashbacks,
flashes-sideways, and viewpoint changes, Ghosts of Mars is a hapless
mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and ill-conceived action
sequences.  The only thing keeping this film from becoming an
incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity of its story. 
Ripped straight from the pages of a 1970s zombie movie, Ghosts leaps
from one convenient moment to the next, stopping only to kill the
characters which are most convenient to lose.
Attempts at character interaction and development are rare and forced. 
Most of these moments come off as Kwik-E-Mart wisdom, dispensed heartily
around the Slushee machine of life by the even-tempered streetwise hand
of Ice Cube.  With a gun in one hand and a dynamite cap in the other,
Cube reminisces about his street life, comparing the zombie-stomping fun
to "Me and my brother when we was kids."  Apparently, crime in the Bronx
has gotten so bad that the residents have actually taken to ritually
decapitating one another for entertainment.
But, even in the film's darkest moments, fate conveniently lends a hand,
supplying heavily armored transportation and easily accessible rifles
and dynamite.  Yes, in the future, man may travel to space and conquer
Mars, but nothing beats a good stick of TNT.  And as we all know, every
police station, past, present, or future, keeps a healthy supply on
hand.
Characters die, heads are lopped off, but they were only supporting
roles anyway, so why should we care?  As long as you have plenty of
narcotics, immunity is guaranteed.  Eventually though, even the most
well-trained zombie alien gets a bit uppity and needs to be taught a
lesson.  What better way than by sacrificing a few minor characters to a
convenient nuclear detonation, killing anything the machine guns can't
handle.  Explosions are fun.  And even if the nukes don't get them, the
conveniently placed dynamite packs on the train stolen from the set of
The Road Warrior certainly will.
In the end this film defines itself when our cop's tribunal pronounces,
"Is that all you have to tell us?"  For, indeed, John Carpenter has run
out of things to say, and has instead decided to use whatever is
convenient to tell a ridiculously bad story.

GHOSTS OF MARS by John Carpenter, one of the B-movie kings, is a horror movie
set on the red planet in the year 2176.  Don't worry, you'll feel right at home
since it is a retro future in which flashlights and many other technologies
haven't advanced at all in almost two centuries.  The movie's unluckily
possessed humans, a group of miners, look like members of the heavy metal band
KISS.  They run around like cave men, yell like wild animals and decorate their
bodies through massive self-mutilation.  
Those going in hopes of the over-the-top fun of Carpenter's last picture,
VAMPIRES, will leave disappointed.  Here the action is merely ridiculous without
the energetic fun of VAMPIRES.  Still, after a lifeless first act, the movie
does pick up the pace in the middle.  The ending, however, doesn't hang
together.  The result is an uneven movie that's much less hit than miss.
The story concerns the train transportation of a notorious criminal named James
"Desolation" Williams.  As Desolation, Ice Cube's lack of acting talent turns
into an asset, making his stilted dialog come across as campy wit.  Natasha
Henstridge, from the SPECIES series, is the movie's leading character, Melanie
Ballard, the second in command of the police force that has come to retrieve
Desolation.   Pam Grier plays the detail's commander.
When they arrive at the mining camp where Desolation is being held, it's almost
a ghost town, thanks to the destruction caused by the aforementioned miners.  It
seems that something deep within the planet has been unleashed and has inhabited
their bodies.  
The movie is as dead as an asteroid until Ballard and Desolation become caustic
comrades in the battle against the heavy metallers.  The barbs they trade put
enough needed life into the movie to make you hope that it will finally take
off, but it never achieves lift-off.  Although some of the drug usage in the
story looks a bit too inviting, one scene could serve as an excellent public
service announcement against drugs.  It is a sickly funny scene that becomes one
of the more memorable incidents in a movie whose memory has a half-life measured
in minutes.
"Maybe I'd sleep with you if you were the last man on earth," Ballard tells one
of her men (Jason Statham), who keeps hitting on her, "but we're not on earth." 
It is a joke in which you know the punch line before it's delivered.  Most of
the movie is like that.
GHOSTS OF MARS at least has the good sense to run only 1:38.  It is rated R for
"strong violence/gore, language and some drug content" and would be acceptable
for older teenagers.
The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, August 24, 2001.  In
the Silicon Valley, it will be showing at the AMC and the Century theaters.

Beware of movies with the director's name in the title. Take "John
Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars" (please). If the Carpenter brand name wasn't
superglued to the title, this embarrassment would surely have bypassed
theaters entirely and gone straight to its proper home on the USA
Network.
And I would have been spared a headache.
The latest from the director of "Starman," "Halloween" and "Escape from
New York" is a lousy western all gussied up to look like a futuristic
horror flick. The production is set on Mars in 2176, where humanity
looks for relief from the overpopulation strangling their home world.
Six hundred and forty thousand people in a matriarchal society live and
work at outposts all over the red planet, terra-forming to make it more
hospitable for future generations.
A matriarchal society. Terra-forming. Sounds pretty intriguing, eh?
Well, don't get your hopes up.

Starring Natasha Henstridge, Ice Cube, Pam Grier, Clea
DuVall, Jason Statham, Liam Waite, Joanna Cassidy,
Wanda DeJesus, and Richard Cetrone as "Big Daddy
Mars." Directed by John Carpenter. Rated R.
I haven't kept up with John Carpenter over the years.
Previous to this, my experience with the notorious
horror director has been limited to Halloween and the
much-maligned (but not by me) 1995 remake of Village
of the Damned. Now, after seeing John Carpenter's
Ghosts of Mars, I think I'll rent Starman this
weekend. His latest is exactly what I've been missing:
mindless, schlocky, well-made science fiction that
entertains without condescending. Modern sci-fi tends
to come in two varieties: thoughtful and lofty, or
downright bad. Though I always welcome the former,
it's good to see someone subvert the trend of the
latter.
There's a difference between a simple plot and a
stupid one. Carpenter's is a no-brainer, but it's
executed with flair, talent, and few lapses in logic.
It deals with a team of policemen in a distant-future
Mars, who are sent by train to a secluded penitentiary
to transport a prisoner - "Desolation Williams (Ice
Cube) - back to civilization for trial. The film is
framed so that we learn of the mission's only
survivor: Melanie Bradford (Natasha Henstridge). What
follows is a story told by Bradford to a group of
justices trying her for narcotics use.
Her team finds the prison all but abandoned; those who
are left have, for the most part, been overrun by
ghosts who possess their victims and control them,
making them mutilate their bodies and stick weird
things in their faces. Soon enough Melanie, her crew,
and the few remaining prisoners (including Williams),
barricade themselves in one of the prison buildings,
to defend against the planet's former inhabitants who
have no plans to let humanity take over.
After the super-accelerated set-up, Carpenter goes
into overdrive with pretty much one action sequence
after another. These are almost indescribably chaotic,
but so masterfully filmed that there is never question
about what's going on. There are scenes where just
about every character is fighting in the same frame
and everything remains clear and lucid. There's a
temptation to bash these kinds of movies; it's hokum,
yes, but what hokum.
I've liked Ice Cube since I saw him in Three Kings> --
where he was the most likeable character - and he
comes through as an action hero in Ghosts of Mars. He
and Henstridge have an undeniable chemistry, and even
though their
enemies-who-must-depend-on-one-another-to-survive
relationship is clichéd, I believed it. Henstridge
herself had all but disappeared after her supposedly
star-making turn in Species, and she returns to
stardom in a role that I liked, even if it's unlikely
to earn her the right to ask for a $20 million
paycheck.
I sat back, relaxed, and watched with an ever-present
smile on my face. I had a good time. A.I. this isn't,
but it's good, solid science fiction in the vein of
the Alien series. But whatever its shortcomings, I
refuse to give a grade lower than a B- to any movie
that ends with the exchange: "Let's go kick some
ass."/"That's what we do best."

JOHN CARPTENTER'S GHOSTS OF MARS is the full title of this movie.  Including 
his name is the strategy the director has chosen to make his work into a 
sort of franchise, a recognizable player in a field cluttered with folk who 
want to make horror flicks.
Not that the guy's a sellout  Carpenter always paints with bold strokes, 
displaying sides charged with creativity, originality and technical 
risk-taking.  But this director is also not afraid to recycle every cliché 
you can name from the genres of Western, martial arts, and sci-fi films.
A favorite idea of Carpenter's  is possession.  In THE THING a creature from 
outer space, defrosted from its prison in the Antarctic ice, infects the 
scientists at a remote station.  His recent  VAMPIRES deals with vampirism 
as infection  one of the main characters slowly taken over by the force of 
the title.  The ghosts on the Red Planet appear as a storm of red dust, 
released unwittingly by a team of miners and their doctor.  Ruthlessly these 
ancient spirits seize hosts; the possessed mutilate themselves horribly, 
regard their human bodies with insane bemusement, even move strangely.  
Their purpose:  to wipe out any foreign invader of Mars, even eons after 
their own deaths.  It's hard to think of a theme more terrifying than being 
taken over against your will.  It's the reason the Borg are such good 
villains in the Star Trek series.
Carpenter's storytelling marks him as a risk-taker.  Using multiple 
flashbacks, some very short and others lengthy, he shows us what happened to 
the mining outpost in Shining Valley.  The opening of this frame tale shows 
a tribunal gathering to hear the report of Lt. Melanie Ballard (Natasha 
Henstridge).  We watch as her tale unfolds: a trip with her fellow police 
officers to bring back the dangerous felon `Desolation' Williams (Ice Cube). 
  Their commander is Helena (Pam Grier) a hard-nosed veteran who is saddled 
with one of the worst lines of dialogue: `You think you're all a bunch of 
tough hombres,' she utters to her squad as they prepare to disembark from 
the train and step into the apparently deserted mining town.  Jason Statham 
plays Jericho, the lecher with a British accent, but a good cop.  The rookie 
Bashira Kincaid (Clea DuVall) accompanies them, along with a few other 
officers.  Of course much is implied at the beginning, when Ballard tells 
about returning alone, handcuffed to the train, which arrives via automatic 
pilot.  Has every single one of her entourage perished?  Is Williams dead?  
Instead of a spoiler, this detail turns into a tantalizing lure.  Carpenter 
handles well the implications of exploring a story told by a flawed 
character.
Although the film takes a few minutes to get rolling, we are soon interested 
in the premise.  Jericho discovers the gorge in which the possessed miners 
rant.  We see tidbits of the ancient Martian culture  talismans made of 
wire, nails, scissors and other weapon-like materials, bundles of teeth and 
tissue oddly reminiscent of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.  The creatures are now 
zombie-like, having displaced the personalities of the humans.  Whenever one 
of the hosts dies, by the way, we see the world in a distorted frenzy, the 
floating Martian-eye view of the hated humans, as the spirit seeks a new 
body to occupy.  The police come across several of these tortured souls in 
the concrete structures that make up the ghost town.
But the action really starts when the main body of vengeful Martians 
discovers the team.  By now a subplot has shown us the conflict with 
Williams  part of which is a contingent bent on springing him from jail.  
Of course Ballard and her officers are consumed with following their orders 
to return with Williams so that he might stand trial.  How the cops deal 
with crooks and ghosts takes up the remainder of the story.
The action scenes are very bloody and mostly well-choreographed.  One 
sequence goes over the top when the black-clad, ghost-addled bodies keep 
charging down the corridors, dropping as fast as the black-clad good guys 
can blow them away.   Hand-to-hand skirmishes are punctuated by neat series 
of kicks and other combinations.  Perhaps there is one beheading too many, 
though, particularly when you can tell the victim is a dummy.
A technique that Carpenter uses sparingly cuts from the actors and springs a 
couple of seconds forward, so we spot them a few steps ahead;  these shots 
are pure stylistic try-outs, it seems, interesting visually but without 
merit in furthering the story.
The acting is solid enough for the vehicle.  Henstridge is faced with other 
actresses who have played strong, silent heroes in modern movies, but she 
does come off well.  Her character falls just short of doing everything by 
the book.  Scenes of her hallucinating  during drug use let us glimpse her 
real self, as well as provide important foreshadowing.
Statham's character, Jericho Butler, becomes likable only after we see he is 
loyal and competent.  This strong actor gives a visceral boost to the tale.  
The rest of the cast support the story well, particularly the stunt 
man-turned-actor Richard Cetrone, who plays the leader of the zombie miners, 
dubbed `Big Daddy Mars.'  It's essentially a non-speaking role, though 
Cetrone frequently howls and chants, whipping up his frantic followers.  
I've read a few comments about Cetrone's make up:  I was reminded of an 
enraged member of the rock group KISS, his chest pierced heavily and his 
mouth drooling blood.  And I wanted to ask, `If these human bodies have been 
so beaten, (self) mutilated and otherwise drained of blood and energy, how 
can they still attack so savagely?  But that's one disbelief I must suspend.
In one over-the-top scene I had to laugh at Big Daddy's persistence, in the 
same way that I tend to laugh when I'm getting thrown around by a roller 
coaster.  Some of Carpenter's shots and lines are plainly silly and worn 
out;  even his original music is just loud and very metallic.  But I had 
fun, and that's why I go to amusement parks, and to movie theaters showing 
the work of John Carpenter.

        John Carpenter makes B-movies.  Always has ("Halloween," "Escape from New
York," "The Thing") and, by the looks of it ("They Live," "Escape from
L.A.," "Vampires"), always will.
        Carpenter's latest horror opus with a science fiction bent (or science
fiction outing with a schlock horror bent) is the aptly-titled "John
Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars" (in case, I suppose, you went looking for
someone else's "Ghosts of Mars").  Like all those films prefixed by the
very possessive "John Carpenter's," "Ghosts of Mars" is an unashamed
B-movie punctuated by a B-movie plot, B-movie actors, and B-movie special
effects.
        In category one, above, we have a storyline that borders on idiotic (and,
at times, chaotic).  Dormant Martians (i.e., swirling red gases) awakened
by meddling humans possess the souls of hapless mining colonists rendering
them testy Marilyn Manson lookalikes.  All this explained (in flashback) to
some grand Pooh-Bah counsel by Martian Police official Melanie Ballard
(Natasha Henstridge, from the sub-"Species" films), the only returnee on a
silly-looking train.  Officer Ballard went in to bring back incarcerated
felon James "Desolation" Williams; what she found was not a pretty picture.
        In the second category we have Ms. Henstridge, her blonde hair pulled back
tightly and awkwardly into a ponytail, Ice Cube (as the appropriately-named
"Desolation"), Pam Grier (briefly, oddly--who wanted to work with whom I
wonder?), and a host of extras all assuming that the story and special
effects were going to carry this film and therefore they didn't need to try
too hard.
        In category number three we have, in addition to those swirling red gases
and the silly-looking train, a couple of bird's-eye-view shots of a
sprawling Martian metropolis (reddish also).  State-of-the-art special
effects have never been a Carpenter trademark and once again the
writer/director (who seems to have no problem finding work, however)
doesn't waste any of the film's budget in that department.
        "Ghosts of Mars" is lock, laughing stock, and barrel all your standard
Carpenter fare: dingy interiors, cluttered exteriors, inane dialogue, lots
of leather, scarred, crazed-looking aliens, and lots and lots of weaponry.
The film often and always explodes into warfare without
warning--spontaneously, stupidly.  Carpenter might like to think he's made
a western here but it's a western without any real heroes, villains, or
border conflicts.  It's just the shootouts minus a hissing Snake Plissken.
I never thought I'd miss the guy but I do.
        It's not *all* the same, however.  Dubbed the "one-note wonder" for his
minimalist music soundtracks, Carpenter seems to have graduated from
simplistic (yet effective) scoring by highlighting his action with loud,
screeching guitar work.  Fortunately this drowns out a lot of the dialogue.
 The final exchange between Henstridge and, er, Cube though is both audible
*and* priceless.
        Mars has proven an infertile breeding ground for Hollywood in the last
year or so, what with the stillborn "Mission to Mars" and "Red Planet"
(with Val Kilmer).  "Ghosts of Mars" sadly adds to those disappointing
returns (in its opening weekend it was overshadowed by a bunch of sequels,
among them "American Pie 2" and "Rush Hour 2").  The irony is that the Mars
in Carpenter's film feels sadly absent.  There are occasional references to
the red planet, of course, but the film might as well have been set in
Perth Amboys than on earth's closest neighbor.
        Two things keep "John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars" from getting a huge slap
upside the head.  1. Henstridge keeps her top on (miraculously), and 2. the
film doesn't pretend to be anything it's not.  What that means, however, is
that fans of superior, intelligent, grade A sci-fi/horror are singularly
out of luck.

PLOT:
The year is 2176 and the planet Mars has been colonized. A bunch of cops are
sent to a village to pick up a killer from prison. Upon their arrival, they find
an empty town filled with decapitated corpses. It isn't long before they realize
that certain "ghosts" from the planet have arisen and are entering human bodies
in order to kill the others. From then on, it's the humans versus the
zombie-like ghost-goths fest!
CRITIQUE:
Do you like playing "Doom" or "Quake" on your computer? Do you like the loud
music...I mean, really loud music? Do you enjoy watching a zillion people get
mowed down by gunfire a la Schwarzenegger movies from the 80s? Do you wanna see
guys and girls get their limbs chopped off by sawblades and shit? Do you enjoy
the kitchiness of the blaxploitation movies from the 70s? Do you like Natasha
Henstridge and wanna see her in underwear and kickin' ass? Are you a fan of Ice
Cube and appreciate his corny one-liners? Have you ever wondered what would come
out if director John Carpenter decided to take elements from all of his previous
films and mix them all up into one (including THE THING, VAMPIRES, ESCAPE FROM
NY, etc...)? Would you like to see Pam Grier's head on a stick? Have you been
waiting for a "fun" Mars movie for some time? Do you believe in the concept of a
mindless movie, a "popcorn" flick created solely for your enjoyment in that
point in time and not expected to be taken any more seriously than that?
Well, if you answered "yes" to most of these questions, then you are likely an
ideal candidate to enjoy this cheesy picture. If you answered "no" to most of
these questions, this film is definitely not for you, please move on and thank
me for it later. I personally went into this movie with super-low expectations
and had a blast. I got into its slow start, appreciated its heavy score and
seriously had fun watching the loads, and I mean loads of killings, maimings and
beheadings in the film (all in the name of ghosts running rampant on Mars, of
course). Now are you supposed to take notes during a movie like this? Of course
not! It's an all-out gang-bang movie for the senses and I was running along side
the whole way. Of course, there are many actual elements of the movie that
aren't really "good". For example, I didn't like the "ghosts" at all. All they
seemed to do was scream and mope around like "Mad Max" rejects. I also didn't
like the over-use of flashbacks in the film, but did get used to them after a
while. I also thought that the whole town of Shining Canyon looked like a giant
movie set, didn't think that the premise was very original and noticed some
crappy CGI here and there, but I honestly didn't really mind it all that much
because I "got into" the cheesiness of it all. A special nod goes out to the
film's final scene which was especially cool.
This is not a "good" movie by the book definition of that word. This is the kind
of movie that you'll really dig when you're drunk with some buddies and just
wanna have a blast! There are no big words in this movie. The plot is very
simple. There are decapitations galore, blood galore and lots of people getting
killed as the good guys fight the bad. If any of that turns your dial, you're
barking up the right tree. If not, don't come crying to me afterwards. This
movie is cheesy, it's fun, it's loud and it's not trying to be 2001: A SPACE
ODYSSEY...it's low-grade entertainment and it works! At least according to me,
and God knows that I've enjoyed a handful of "bad movies" (according to others)
in the past (LAST ACTION HERO, BATTLEFIELD EARTH, HUDSON HAWK). So you've been
warned... ;)

    CAPSULE: In 2176 on the planet Mars police taking into custody
    an accused murderer face the title menace.  There is a lot of
    fighting and not a whole lot of story otherwise.  John
    Carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films,
    especially ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, that the new film comes off
    as his homage to himself.  Rating: 4 (0 to 10), 0 (-4 to +4).
John Carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which
people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes.
For a writer and director of horror films, supposedly an expert on
horror, it is a very bad mistake to make.  GHOSTS OF MARS is
called a horror movie, but it is more just a drawn out fight
between humans and a surprisingly low-powered alien menace.  In
addition if anybody but John Carpenter had made GHOSTS OF MARS,
Carpenter would have grounds to sue.  This film is just chock full
of pieces taken from ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, THE THING, and PRINCE
OF DARKNESS.  It is, in fact, surprising that Carpenter managed to
fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an
admittedly novel way.  But that still does not make for a really
good science fiction experience.
GHOSTS OF MARS takes place in the year 2176.  Mars has been mostly
terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without
breathing gear (which is good for the film's budget).  It is never
mentioned, but the gravity on Mars has been increased somehow to
earth-normal, again making it easier to film.  Society has changed
a bit by that time, but it has advanced surprisingly little.
Apparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in
positions of control.  And from Carpenter's view, women have
really made a mess of things.  Society has stagnated under female
control so that beyond some minor technological advances society
has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in
ten.
The basic plot of GHOSTS OF MARS has much in common with that of
ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 except that Precinct 9 (yes, Precinct 9)
has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown Martian
mining colony.  Instead of having the criminal "Napolean" Wilson,
this film has the criminal "Desolation" Williams.  Instead of
facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face, well,
ghosts of Mars.  Because the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature
they should behave in some alien manner, but they essentially
behave as human savages, in another lapse of imagination.  The
story is told in flashback, flashback within flashback, and
flashback within flashback within flashback.
GHOSTS OF MARS takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost
entirely in tones of red, yellow, and black.  Carpenter manages to
give us a powerful opening scene, showing a mining train rushing
through the Martian night to the sound of music with a heavy beat.
Sadly what follows is not really up to the buildup.  The terror he
creates looks a little too much like fugitive wannabes from the
rock band Kiss.  His idea of building suspense is having a bunch
of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking
something scary is happening and then prove to be just something
boring.  These are standard haunted house film shock effects that
require no great talent to give the audience.  Somewhat newer but
also unimpressive are the CGI digital decapitations in some of the
fights.
Within a short stretch of time we have seen the release of MISSION
TO MARS, RED PLANET, and GHOSTS OF MARS.  After MISSION TO MARS
was panned by too many reviewers it looks better and better and
better as time goes by.  I rate GHOSTS OF MARS a 4 on the 0 to 10
scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.
Following the movie I showed my wife, who liked GHOSTS OF MARS
moderately more than I did, Carpenter's classic ASSAULT ON
PRECINCT 13.  Her comment is that it was seeing the same film
twice.

It's 175 years into the future and Mars is colonized by over ˝ million
Earthlings. To ensure order on the pioneer planet terrestrial laws apply
and are enforced vigorously by the MPF (Mars Police Force). When an
unmanned trained arrives from a far flung mining station, the only one
aboard, handcuffed, is Lt. Melanie Ballard (Natasha Henstridge), and she
has a horrifying story to tell her superiors in John Carpenter's "Ghosts of
Mars."
The lieutenant was second in command on a team sent to bring in James
"Desolation" Williams (Ice Cube), the red planet's most notorious criminal.
Desolation is being held at Shining Canyon mining station, but when the
cops arrive, they find the place deserted except for those held in the
fortified confines of the local jail. Commander Helena Braddock (Pam Grier)
splits up her crew, sending Ballard and two troopers, Kincaid and Descanso
(Clea Duvall and Liam Waite), to locate Williams. Braddock and
smart-mouthed Sergeant Jericho (Jason Statham) reconnoiter the compound and
find some of the colony's inhabitants - headless corpses hung upside down
in a gruesome, ritualistic display.
The cause of the slaughter is soon apparent when Braddock spots the
remaining miners, possessed by some force that has rendered them inhuman.
Self-mutilation is the norm for these creatures, led by a Marilyn Manson
wannabee, Big Daddy Mars (Richard Cetrone), and the creepy critters are out
for blood. The beleaguered cops and the few still-human survivors of the
colony must battle the vicious monster of Mars until the train that took
them into Shining Canyon returns. It's kill or be killed, or worse, be
possessed by the ghosts of the distant planet.
"Ghost of Mars" is meat and potatoes filmmaking. John Carpenter is known,
of late, for some truly hack work, like "Escape from LA" and the
presumptuously titles "John Carpenter's Vampires." With "Ghosts" the helmer
works from a script co-written with Larry Sulkis and tells a fairly
conventional cops against the bad guys. Setting it on Mars gives it
ready-made sci-fi status, but it is, still, a routine survival story.
Natasha Henstridge is not bad as the veteran Mars copper. She is too pretty
and well made up for the character and is too Hollywood looking, but she
acquits herself with the physical moves required.  Ice Cube has done the
same sullen tough guy character too many times and, while likable in a
punch-you-in-the-face way, it's a carbon copy perf we've seen before. Jason
Statham, with his Cockney accent and insouciant ways, makes himself notable
and should get more work after "Ghosts of Mars." Blaxploitation icon Pam
Grier is, sadly, used up very quickly and loses her head early on. Almost
everyone else is alien fodder, including the aliens.
Techs aren't as cheesy as in "Escape from LA," but there is an
artificiality to the whole thing that never lets you forget you are
watching a movie. The story goes through its paces with the requisite
explosions, machine gun fire and alien butt kicked as the steadily
dwindling number of humans try to get away from the possessing Martians.
The last moments of the end of the film give rise to the possibility of a
sequel, if the box office numbers are good. I give it a C.

JOHN CARPENTER'S GHOSTS OF MARS (2001) 1/2 star out of 4. Starring Ice Cube,
Natasha Henstridge, Jason Statham, Pam Grier, Joanna Cassidy and Clea Duvall.
Written by Larry Sulkis and John Carpenter. Music by John Carpenter. Directed by
Carpenter. Rated R. 
The Red Planet runs redder in John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars. Those who enjoy
watching decapitations and body limbs being hacked off will go orgasmic over
this cartoonish piece of unoriginality. 
This pulplike outing is sloppy and derivative, owing much to Carpenter's first
big hit, Assault on Precinct 13. 
So many parts of this movie go haywire that finding a starting point is
difficult. First, Carpenter offers a crash course on Martian colonization,
explaining that the colonists established a matriarchal society. 
This is merely a setup so the audience won't be shocked when they see female
cops bossing men around. Big deal. 
Then, there's the confusing story structure. The film is told in flashback by
Lt. Ballard (Natasha Henstridge), the sole survivor of a team set to a distant
mining town to check on a disturbance and bring back and well-known criminal
named James "Desolation" Williams (Ice Cube), whose characterization is most
reminiscent of Carpenter's Napoleon Wilson from Precinct 13. 
Cube's Williams even cribs some dialogue that is similar to lines spoken by
Wilson in the earlier flick. 
It seems that every major character must be given his or her own flashback,
explaining events we are watching as they do voice overs. it becomes most
repetitious and boring. 
Carpenter takes too long in building up the suspense, and the payoff is a big
let down. 
The Martian ghosts - really dustlike particles that take over humans - create an
army of zombies who run around shouting and killing colonists. The army also is
a rip-off of the anonymous gangbangers who were mowed down during Precinct 13. 
Even what is supposed to pass for witty repartee between Henstridge's Ballard
and Ice Cube's Williams seems forced. The chemistry factor is zero. 
Carpenter does add a couple of interesting touches. Ballard and her mouthy
subordinate, Jericho (Jason Statham) sneak off into a store room where Jericho
suggests they have one last fling before facing the overwhelming odds against
them. Instead of acting insulted or slapping his face, Ballard pauses, agrees
with him and begins sucking face. 
Before anything can happen, though, those rude Martians begin attacking again. 
Ghosts of Mars is one of Carpenter's weakest efforts yet, and he has helmed a
bunch of howlers. 
And Carpenter doesn't help with his obnoxious, pulsating and loud score that
blares every suspenseful piece of business as if it was the most important bit
of action in the movie. 
This is one of those watch movies. No, you're not watching the screen, but
checking your time piece to try to determine when it will all end. Ghosts of
Mars is a snoozer. Only the explosions may interfere with your napping.

Susan Granger's review of "GHOSTS OF MARS" (Sony Pictures Entertainment)
      Horror auteur John Carpenter ("Halloween," "Vampires") strikes out
with this sci-fi eco-fable that's so bad it boggles the mind to imagine how the
project ever got green-lit. The script by Carpenter and Larry Sulkis appears to
have been lifted directly from last year's "Pitch Black," involving a violent
prisoner who must be released from bondage so that he can help a small band of
humans protect themselves from blood-thirsty, marauding aliens. In the year
2176, there are 640,000 Earthlings on Mars, living in a matriarchal society led
by a Commander, played by Pam Grier. Grier, pill-poppin' Natasha Henstridge, and
some rookie Mars Police officers (Clea Duvall, Jason Statham) travel to the
remote mining town of Shining Canyon to fetch "Desolation" Williams - that's Ice
Cube - to bring him back to Chryse City to stand trial for murder. But when
they're besieged by demented, zombie-like, body-snatching miners, they readily
free the scowling Ice Cube since they need him for protection. It seems a red
cloud was released from a Shining Canyon cave and, soon after, most of the
miners went bonkers as long-dormant remnants of an ancient Martian civilization
took over their minds and bodies, lopping off heads as "vengeance for anything
that tries to lay claim to their planet," according to a scientist (Joanna
Cassidy). Carpenter uses so many flashbacks to tell the "Night of the Living
Dead"-like story that the idiotic plot gets incomprehensibly confusing. But you
can easily predict each of the supporting characters who will be killed, along
with the order of their elimination. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
"Ghosts of Mars" thuds to a laborious, bottom-of-the-barrel 1. Perhaps, indeed,
there is a curse on Mars films, if you recall two other duds: "Mission to Mars"
and "Red Planet."
