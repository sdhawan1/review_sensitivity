"His Girl Friday" is a comedy that satirizes the newspaper
business.  It is based on the noted Broadway play
"The Front Page", but with a plot twist in that one
of the two leads is a woman and is the ex-wife of the other.
It stars Rosalind Russell as a headstrong woman
who plans to marry a milquetoast insurance salesman
(Ralph Bellamy).  She attempts to quit her job as a reporter
working for conniving editor and ex-husband Cary Grant.
Although she is fully aware of his schemes, she gets suckered
into covering one last story; the pending execution of
a mild-mannered man who becomes unstable when carrying
a handgun.
One of the running gags of the film is that clueless
Bellamy keeps ending up in jail, an innocent victim of
Grant's machinations.  Bellamy plays the wide-eyed dupe
perfectly.  When Grant makes a ridiculous speech about
his devotion to his ex-wife, Bellamy believes it all
and can only say "Gee!" in amazement.
"His Girl Friday" makes heavy use of overlapping dialogue.
One scene has Grant, Russell and Bellamy all talking at once.
This technique works as it makes the film more dynamic.
Newspapermen are depicted in the film as prone to
cynical moralizing, embellishing the truth for dramatic
impact, and willing to commit crimes in order to win
a "scoop".  This image may be more accurate today, more
than a half century later, than it was when the film was made.
Director Howard Hawks and Cary Grant must have gotten along
well, since they made four other films together.  All but
one of these films was a comedy.  Cary Grant was a great
comic actor, usually playing a character who doesn't quite
realize that he is making a fool of himself.  "His Girl Friday"
is different in that Bellamy plays the stooge.  Of course, Grant
had success in dramatic roles as well.
