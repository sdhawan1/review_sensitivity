Directed by Barry W Blaustein. Screenplay by Blaustein. Starring Terry
Funk, Mick Foley, Jake Roberts. Running time: 101 minutes. Rated AA by the
MFCB. Reviewed on July 4th, 2000.
Pro wrestling, for me, has always been kind of like a traffic accident -- 
you don't really want to watch, but you just can't look away. I was a big
fan of the World Wrestling Federation back in the mid-1980s. These were
the days when Hulk Hogan was king of the ring, Andre the Giant was a
feared presence lurking in the background, and one of the WWF's biggest
heels (that's wrestling parlance for "villain") was -- wait for it -- an
Elvis impersonator.
I eventually grew out of wrestling, and for a decade I didn't really pay
it much attention. But the WWF (and its lesser-known competitors, the WCW
and ECW) have been increasingly hard to ignore in recent years. The action
is riskier, the characters sleazier, and the sexual innuendo almost
palpable. Wrestlers parade across the screen in the company of
enormously-endowed women, make profane gestures at the audience, shove
soiled underwear in their opponents' faces, and generally behave like
raving savages.
I consider myself a fairly discriminating viewer. I detest programmes that
insult my intelligence and flaunt gratuitous violence and sex. So why do I
find myself anticipating word of the latest WWF shenanigans? Why do I sit
in front of the tube and watch people pummel each other with any object at
hand? Witness choreographed posturing so exaggeratedly scripted as to
utterly defy suspension of disbelief? Good questions.
Barry Blaustein, the director of the new wrestling documentary "Beyond The
Mat" -- the first documentary shown in St John's theatres in my memory,
and quite possibly ever -- seems to be wondering these things too, 
although he never confronts the answer directly. Instead, Blaustein's film
is more of a travelogue, taking us from a sort of "minor league"
wrestlers' training school, to the WWF itself, to the careers of wrestlers
past their prime. It gives the documentary a somewhat lightweight feel,
but the subject matter is bleak enough that this might not be such a bad
thing.
Blaustein focuses mainly on three wrestlers. There's Terry Funk, a fifty
year-old grizzled veteran of the ring. We follow Funk as he visits his
doctor, and witness the x-rays that so tellingly demonstrate the effects
of his career on his health. His knees are devastated, and the doctor
sounds almost incredulous when he wonders that Funk isn't already in
extreme pain.
Then there's Jake "The Snake" Roberts, who was one of wrestling's big guns
when I was young. Roberts' career has taken a turn for the worse, as an
addiction to crack cocaine has caught up with him. Now he earns his keep
wrestling no-name jobbers in small towns, trying to support his habit. The
change between Roberts in and out of the ring is striking. In front of the
audience, he's almost the wrestler of old, working the crowd like a
master. Out of the limelight, he's a haunted, broken man. We learn of his
tragic past, including abandoning university for wrestling to earn the
love of his ex-wrestler father.
Most telling of all is Roberts' hesitant, detached reunion with his
estranged daughter. His only defense against her charges that he was never
there when she was young? That he had to wrestle, two dozen times or more
a month. If he had taken three months off to be with his family, WWF
President Vince McMahon would have had him fired. There are many careers
which take people away from their families for extended periods of time.
How many virtually hold them hostage in doing so?
But "Beyond The Mat" doesn't just dwell on wrestling's dark side. The
third featured wrestler, Mick Foley, clearly loves the game as much as
anyone could. We see him battering his body mercilessly, punishing himself
more than most of us could bear -- and survive it not just intact, but
grinning. At the time "Beyond The Mat" was taped, Foley was one of the
biggest draws in the WWF (he has since retired due to mounting injuries).
His charisma and enthusiasm leap off the screen.
But even this is tempered by scenes involving Foley's young son and
daughter. Before a big match, Foley reminds them that it's all just an
act, and the other wrestler -- the Rock (Dwayne Johnson) -- doesn't really
hate him. But when the Rock beats Foley with a steel chair over and over
and over again, his children still cry, and his even his wife looks on in
abject terror. When Blaustein shows Foley this footage, the wrestler is
uncharacteristically subdued. That he regrets what he puts his family
through is undeniable. But, as he himself says, if he didn't wrestle what
would he do?
"Beyond The Mat" is not a perfect film. Blaustein lingers too long on some
subjects. There is an overlong depiction of Funk's farewell bout, for
example, made all the more pointless by the revelation that he returned to
wrestling just months later. Some topics are glossed over or ignored
altogether -- for instance, the topic of women in wrestling merits just a
few soundbites from the wrestler known as Chyna (Joanie Laurer), and is
rather glibly assessed. Blaustein also neglects such popular controversies
as the death of Owen Hart, the betrayal of Hart's brother Bret by McMahon,
and the allegations of sexual impropriety by ex-wrestler Sable (Rena Mero).
But maybe what this points to is that there is more going on outside the
frame of the weekly wrestling programmes than can be contained in one
documentary. Certainly, Blaustein has more than enough material for
"Beyond The Mat II".
I noticed that the promotional poster for "Beyond The Mat" loudly declares
this to be "the movie Vince McMahon doesn't want you to see!" That's
because McMahon has forbidden the airing of the movie's trailer during WWF
broadcasts. But is this a genuine move to counter what I guess McMahon 
sees as negative publicity, or just a ploy for media attention? Where
wrestling is concerned, who can say?

I have a confession to make: I'm a closet Pro Rasslin' fan ["Rasslin'", 
by the way, is a different creature than "wrestling".  The latter is 
what high school, college, and Olympic grapplers, do; the former is what 
crazy men and women dressed in tights of various fit and style and in 
cahoots with one another, do for little to no pay, or for crazy amounts 
of money, depending on many factors, some of which will be addressed 
below.  But yet again, I digress].
Ahem. I repeat: I'm a closet Pro Rasslin' fan--or at least, I used to 
be.  I watched it a lot as a kid back in the days of "The Sheik" and 
"BoBo Brazil", and like most of America, lost interest in it, until the 
heyday of the likes of "Hulk Hogan", Randy "Macho Man" Savage, and my 
personal favorite, "The Ultimate Warrior".  But though I've glanced at a 
few current World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and World Championship 
Wrestling (WCW) shows from time to time with my son, I've lost interest 
in the spectacle that is Pro Rasslin', because in its current 
incarnation, it's way too raunchy, soap opera-ish (and bad soap opera, 
at that), blatantly stereotypical and misogynic (all part of the soap, 
I'm sure they'd say), and when you get down to it, unabashedly aimed at 
the lowest common denominator.
Most people know, and even accept, that these "fights" are pre-ordained 
in their outcome--boxing promoter Don King would be a natural in this 
business--but the big question remains: is it fake?  And if is not, who 
are these fools and why would they subject their bodies to the pain?
The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
The documentary Beyond The Mat takes a look at the Sports Entertainment 
industry of Professional Wrestling from the viewpoint of three of its 
major players: Terry Funk, a 53-year-old wrestler nearing the end of his 
career; Mick Foley, a gentle father and husband, but an all-out lunatic 
within the ring; and Jake "The Snake" Roberts, formerly a "golden boy" 
with the WWF, but now a crack addict whose glory days have come and 
gone.  It also addresses the differences between the minor, independent 
leagues and the "big three" of Pro Rasslin': the WWF, WCW, and Extreme 
Championship Wrestling (ECW), itself a controversial entity because of 
its high violence content.
The Upshot:
There was one overwhelming emotion that hit me as I was watching this 
documentary: sadness.  Above all else, I felt incredibly sad for each of 
the characters--make that, each of the three main people--being 
discussed, and even more, for their families.  Of the three, Mick Foley 
(aka "Mankind", "Dude Love", and "Cactus Jack") seemed the most centered 
and stable outside of the ring, and clearly he loved his family as much 
as they loved him.  But the kinds of horrific punishment he puts himself 
through for love of his (pseudo) sport was sickening to watch for me as 
an outsider; I shudder to think what his young children dream of every 
night, after they saw it up close and personal.  Terry Funk's mindset 
was just beyond my comprehension; why he would continue to, basically, 
slowly kill himself, is something I do not understand.  I do give him 
props, though, for being able to swallow such punishment at his age--and 
compared to Muhammed Ali in his degenerative state, Funk is not so bad 
off.  But then again, say the name "Ali", and you get instant 
recognition.  Say "Funk", and most people think of a righteous bass 
groove... 
But by far, my heart went out most to Jake "The Snake" Roberts.  Foley 
is one of the new(er) kids on the block; Funk is from the *original* Old 
School--but The Snake was from back in my rasslin'-fan day.  Jake's 
trademark move, the DDT, was something to watch.  His sneer would 
quickly turn into a smile that you knew hid teeth that would just as 
quickly bite you.  And though those huge pythons he carried to the ring 
never seemed to a real threat, you went along with the charade when he 
tossed them on his opponent, because, after all, Jake wasn't The Snake 
without them.  But like many of the older WWF (and then later, WCW) 
characters, Jake took a back seat to the new, younger guys--and then one 
day, he was gone.  And by then, I'd gotten older, and my interest in 
Rasslin' faded, so I hadn't thought much about Roberts, until this 
documentary.  That he had gotten older and fatter was no real surprise; 
it happens to the best of us.  But to hear that he was a crack 
addict...man, that threw me for a loop.  I'm glad that filmmaker Barry 
Blaustein got Roberts to open up to him, but unfortunately, the viewer 
never really gets as much of Roberts as we do of Blaustein talking about 
Roberts' problems.  
Along with the three featured athletes (and clearly, these folks are 
athletes; though their moves are choreographed, they are real...and real 
scary to watch when the mask is pulled off and you see it for what it 
is) and their families, Blaustein interviews some veterans in the 
profession as well as some up-and-comers.  Among these are: WWF owner 
Vince McMahon, whose family has been in the business for a very long 
time, and is very, very rich; Darren Drozdov, a former NFL player (as 
are many Pro Rasslers) who has the distinct "talent" of being able to 
vomit on command; female Rassler "Chyna", built like a man but made like 
a woman; Paul Heyman of the ECW, a league that has little respect for 
the WWF or WCW, but with all of their violence, seems to respect the 
individuals within its own organization; Tony Jones and Mike Modest, 
part-time Rasslers trying to get into the WWF with the help of their 
promoter, Roland Alexander; and current WWF heartthrob Duane "The Rock" 
Johnson, shown here competing against Foley as a Bad Guy (though last 
time I watched, The Rock is now a Good Character).
As interesting a documentary as it is, I wonder why Beyond The Mat was 
released in theaters instead of on TV; there have already been quite a 
few "Pro Wrestling Expose" types of documentaries on the small screen, 
so why this one here, now?  And I have to wonder about something else, 
too.  Stay with me here: writer/director Blaustein makes no bones about 
his love for the pseudo-sport, and it's clear that the athletes involved 
are pretty comfortable, even chummy, with Blaustein.  The  official 
"Beyond" website proclaims that this documentary is something that WWF 
President Vince McMahon "Doesn't want you to see!"--but isn't that 
something you would expect someone involved with the likes of McMahon, 
to say?  Hmmm...and didn't this documentary beat the WCW's theatrical 
"comedy" debut, Ready To Rumble, to the theaters?  Hmmm...and weren't 
there an awful lot of WWF "superstars" in this documentary, and no WCW 
stars to speak of?  Say it with me now:  HMMMMM...
There were many issues that weren't addressed in this documentary that I 
wish had been: namely, the blatant misogyny, stereotype characters, the 
history of the pseudo-sport (highlighting the way it's changed over the 
years), the way the fans are manipulated, the oodles of money gleaned 
from said fans (McMahon's WWF was reported to be worth almost a billion 
dollars, true, but a closer examination could've been done), the raising 
of the violence bar (namely, with the ECW) and what its logical 
progression will be, and especially the athletes' reactions to the death 
of WWF star Owen Hart last year.  Perhaps that's another documentary for 
another time--by another filmmaker not so in love with the world of Pro 
Rasslin'.
The "Black Factor"  [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
And speaking of "stereotype characters"...
For as long as Pro Rasslin' has existed, at least in the United States, 
there have been stereotype characters involved, but as time has gone on, 
things have become more and more blatant.  For every one average joe 
"The Rock" characters out there, there are a dozen shameful characters 
like "Razor Ramon" (a greasy latino caricature, formerly from the WWF), 
and "The Godfather" (a "pimp daddy", also from the WWF, who struts down 
the aisle with skanky hoochies in tight dresses; he calls them his 
"Ho-Train"--rarely, if ever, doing any actual Rasslin').  While I can 
ignore, for the most part, everything else about the three-ring circus 
known as Pro Rasslin', these types of characters are intolerable.
There is one upside to the "Godfather" character and his "Ho-Train", 
though: there haven't been any Black women on it.  So far.
Bammer's Bottom Line: 
I've flip-flopped on my final rating on this, but in the end decided on 
a greenlight, primarily for all the millions (ObRock: and millions) of 
Pro Rasslin' fans who think it is something to be emulated.  They 
*really* need to go see this one.  And that's my final answer, Regis; 
now take your rooty-poot candy ass outta here, ya jabronie, 'fore I send 
you to the Smackdown Hotel!   Uh...
"Beyond The Mat" (rating: greenlight): 
I still wonder whatever happened to The Ultimate Warrior.

Susan Granger's review of "BEYOND THE MAT" (Lions Gate Films)
Writer/director Barry Blaustein received a Director's Guild of
America documentary nomination for his enthusiastic, behind-the-scenes
examination of professional wrestling. In publicizing his carefully
collated collection of matches and interviews, he's stated, "I wanted
the sport of wrestling to get some respect in spite of itself. I
wanted to also make a film for people who don't even care about
wrestling that would keep them emotionally involved in these guys'
lives."  Perhaps the most famous ex-pro wrestler is Jesse "The Body"
Ventura, who's now serving as the duly elected Governor of Minnesota,
but these guys include the articulate Mick "Mankind" Foley, who has a
book on the best-seller list, along with 53 year-old Terry Funk, Jake
"The Snake" Roberts, and several other lesser luminaries, including
the athlete who can vomit on cue, earning the nickname "Puke."  Make
no mistake about it: wrestling is hard work. Yeah, it's rigged but
that doesn't mean it's easy. Each round is planned, scripted,
choreographed and rehearsed. Cynical promoters pull the strings. But,
for participants, the physical exertion demands stamina and courage,
not to mention frequent trips to the hospital. And the wrestlers come
across as sympathetic, all-too-human men with their own troubles and
tragedies. Vince McMahon, who appears in the footage, and his World
Wrestling Federation has issued a cease-and-desist letter with regard
to the advertisements - which Lions Gate Films has rejected as
bullying tactics to suppress marketing of this film. On the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, Beyond the Mat is a slammin' 6.  While it's
certainly not the "no-holds-barred expose" that's implied in the ads,
it may be more than you ever wanted to know about the subject of
professional wrestling.

        Former Denver Bronco Darrin Drozdov had an unusual talent: the
ability to vomit on command. That might not have been his ticket to a
job in Hollywood or a gig with one of the networks, but it was enough to
attract the attention of World Wrestling Federation czar Vince McMahon,
who had big plans for "Droz."
 McMahon dubbed him Puke and planned to make him a star in the
WWF. Excited by the job offer, Drozdov called home. "You'll be real
proud of me, Mama," he says. "I'm now known as Puke."
 Drozdov's is one of several funny/sad stories told in Barry W.
Blaustein's powerful documentary "Beyond the Mat," which looks not only
at the WWF, but also smaller establishments such as the All-Pro
Wrestling School (run by a rotund accountant who looks like a giant
Weeble) and Philadelphia's outrageously savage Extreme Championship
Wrestling, which Blaustein calls "the Ellis Island of wrestling, where
old wrestlers go to be reborn and new wrestlers go to be discovered."
 Although the subject matter may not sound tremendously
appealing to non-fans of the showy sport, "Beyond the Mat" turns out to
be less interested in the cartoonish brutality of pro wrestling than it
is with the lives of the people who make their living in the ring. Much
of the violence is either carefully choreographed or faked, but when
they're not in the spotlight or in front of throngs of screaming fans,
the wrestlers themselves turn out to be candid, surprisingly low-key
guys.
 The most pathetic of the bunch is former "Wrestlemania"
superstar Jake "The Snake" Roberts, who once fought in front of 80,000
people at the Pontiac Silverdome and now can be found performing in
cut-rate shows in places like Kearney, Neb. Roberts blames his squalid
family history -- he says he was conceived when his mother, then 13, was
raped by her mom's boyfriend -- and his frosty father for his drug
problems and his inability to reach out to his college-aged daughter, a
psychology major who acknowledges "he makes me nervous and I make him
nervous."
 Other potentially troublesome father-child relationships are
brewing in Mick Foley's household. Just prior to a showdown with an
opponent who calls himself The Rock, Foley, known to WWF followers as
Mankind, is seen reassuring his young son Dewey and daughter Noelle that
Daddy won't get hurt at work. Sitting at ringside, however, the kids get
to see their father hurled into a column of speakers and beaten into
submission with a metal folding chair upside the head. Backstage, while
a plastic surgeon sews Foley's scalp back together, the wrestler tries
again to explain to Noelle that the gashing wound is "just a boo-boo."
 Why would a grown man keep on doing this kind of thing? Perhaps
the answer lies in the life of Terry Funk, a legendary figure in
wrestling circles. Against his doctor's advice and his family's wishes,
the 53-year-old insisted on continuing his career because vanity and
pride demand it. If there's a recurring theme in "Beyond the Mat," it's
that these men will always run to the limelight, even if they have to
trample on the feelings of those around them to get there.
 And, wherever guys are willing to put their bodies on the line,
you can bet there will be producers like McMahon ready to exploit and
promote them. McMahon, who reportedly tried to suppress the movie, comes
across as the consummate opportunist, a man who runs new talent through
the mill, feasts on the results and tosses out the leftovers. Even when
he's smiling and lighthearted, there's a fierceness in his eyes that's
downright spooky.
 Blaustein, who wrote the screenplays for Eddie Murphy's "The
Nutty Professor" and "Coming to America," has a sharp eye and a knack
for getting his cameras in the right place at the right time. For
instance, rather than shooting the big match between The Rock and
Mankind, he instead turns his focus to the horrified reactions of
Foley's wife and children, all of whom are in tears long before the
finale. The resulting footage is absolutely heartbreaking, a reminder
that even phoney battles can provoke some very real emotions. James

What do you get when you blend grand opera, theater of the absurd and
gladiators?  The World Wrestling Federation, of course.
In the only sport with script writers, composers, costume designers and
directors, professional wrestling is unabashedly just pure show
business.  It's a spectacle that P.T. Barnum would have loved to own.
After the WWF's recent IPO, you can even buy a piece of it yourself.
Barry W. Blaustein's documentary, BEYOND THE MAT, takes a loving but
honest look behind the curtain to show us how this bizarre piece of
entertainment is operated.  The "sport" is so popular that the
documentary about it is getting released to commercial theaters rather
than art houses, something relatively unheard of in the world of docs.
Make no mistake, however, about wrestling.  It is a dangerous endeavor.
The blood you see is real, as the combatants do such things as take
metal chairs and pulverize their opponents' heads.  These willing
victims get their bodies beat to a pulp up to 10 times a week.  The pain
is no less intense because it is carefully scripted.  From the times of
the Romans, we know that there has always been a market for watching
people being subjected to such incredible abuse.
Blaustein's documentary is hilarious -- frequently frighteningly funny.
The performers go for maximum camp and their interviews off-stage are
completely off the wall.
Most of the stars or would-be stars of the WWF have some schtick in
order to stand out.  Jake the Snake, as you might guess, has his
monstrous snakes that he brings along.
One newcomer has a skill that impresses the CEO of the WWF, which is
still a family business even though it's publicly traded.  The wrestler,
who is given the new stage name of Puke, is able to regurgitate on cue.
"But, what if you weren't born with the skill of projectile wrestling?"
Blaustein asks rhetorically.  The answer?  You pay someone to train you
in wrestling techniques, although your chances of hitting the big time
are extremely slim.
The film, which is mesmerizing in the first thirty minutes, quickly runs
out of ideas.  As fascinating as the first part is, the rest of the
movie is way too repetitive.
Some segments have no resonance.  Typical of these is the one about Jake
the Snake, a crack addict, trying to relate to his abandoned, now
grownup daughter.  We can be sorry for her, but the inclusion of the
material just feels awkward.
Still, the first part of the film is more than worth the price of
admission.  Actually watching 30 minutes of it and then walking out
wouldn't be a bad strategy.  You would have great fun, and staying will
not add much.
BEYOND THE MAT runs too long at 1:42.  It is rated R for strong violence
and language and would be acceptable for older teenagers.  (Young kids,
including those of the contestants who are beaten up, can and do go to
the matches, something that I find shocking.  Of course, shocking is
what pays the bills at the WWF.)

There is one particularly thought-provoking moment in the new
professional wrestling documentary Beyond the Mat.  The setting is just
before a World Wrestling Federation extravaganza called `The Royal
Rumble,' where two competitors calmly discuss the choreography of their
well-scripted WWF title match scheduled for later that evening.  The
wrestlers are defending champ Mick Foley (a.k.a. Cactus Jack [a.k.a.
Mankind]) and The Rock, but that's not what makes this moment
noteworthy.  It's the fact that these two gentlemen are responsible for
the #1 and #2 slots on the current New York Times list of the country's
best-selling books.  I couldn't help but wonder if Ernest Hemingway and
William Faulkner had a similar conversation before their steel cage
match.
That is one of the few memorable interludes from Barry W. Blaustein's
film.  Blaustein, a screenwriter on several Eddie Murphy films
(including The Nutty Professor and its forthcoming sequel Nutty II: The
Klumps), describes himself as a lifelong fan of professional wrestling.
He knows it's fake, but still loves the theatrical pageantry and
athletics involved.  Once Blaustein declares his adoration of the faux
sport, you know that this isn't going to be a hysterical look at the
inbred legions of wrestling fans throughout the country (like
Trekkies).  That approach would have made for a much more substantial
and less one-sided film.  Mat is more of a fluff-piece.
Experienced documentary fans may assume that since Blaustein avoided the
mocking nature of Trekkies-style films, Mat must be a carefully
composed, beautifully lensed picture with a compelling score, like the
works of Errol Morris (Mr. Death).  Wrong.  Mat isn't even shot on
film.  It's like watching somebody's homemade video of a family
picnicif their family consisted primarily of clinically insane,
middle-aged, overweight wrestling uncles.
Mat begins promisingly enough, with Blaustein and his crew filming
within the posh confines of the WWF world headquarters.  Before the film
shows WWF honcho Vince McMahon interview an ex-footballer that can vomit
on command, a Senior Marketing Vice President of the billion-dollar
company compares the WWF to the Muppets  with a straight face.  He says
they're both family-owned businesses, but fails to provide any other
evidence of similarity.  I must have forgotten about that puking Muppet
on Sesame Street who kept bashing Snuffleupagus with a chair.
The documentary then downshifts into a wrestling school run by an
accountant as wide as he is tall.  Specifically, this portion of the
film focuses on two up-and-comers  WWF hopefuls that get a huge break
when they're allowed to fake-fight on the undercard of a WWF tour stop.
So far, so good.
Mat loses steam by telling the tale of Terry Funk, a `living legend'
(a.k.a. washed-up has-been) from Amarillo, Texas.  Funk still wrestles
despite warnings from his doctor and pleadings from his family.  Using
his two bad knees, Funk helps support a fledgling wrestling group called
Extreme Championship Wrestling land their first pay-per-view event.
It's fun to watch the looks on the faces of Funk's wife and children as
he wrestles.  Is it embarrassment or genuine concern for the welfare of
a close relative?
Mat's next subject sucks the remaining life out of the film.  Another
wrestler in the twilight of his career  one Jake `The Snake' Roberts 
recounts a life story that would make Jerry Springer drool.  His saga
includes incest, murder, rape, kidnapping and crack addiction.  Roberts
really brings the film down, not so much with the content of his story,
but rather the way he (and Blaustein) tells it.  He doesn't move his
mouth much, which made me think that it would have been better to use
photographs of a younger Roberts instead.  But then I realized that you
would still be able to hear his monotonous, sleep-inducing tone.
Things pick up a bit when Mat shows Foley/Cactus/Mankind getting a wound
on his head that resembles a woman's private parts after being
repeatedly beaten by a folding chair brandished by The Rock.  This
beat-down is as real as the horrified looks on the faces of Foley's
teary-eyed wife and sobbing kids that watch from the front row.  But
then Blaustein goes back to the much less interesting Roberts.  The
result is a film that's choppy, uneven and practically screams `Jesus,
show wrestlers and their fans as deranged carny folk and freaks of
nature that evolution passed by!'  That's the film that I wanted to
see.  Instead, Mat is a biased story of a billion-dollar industry that
must have tons of skeletons in its closet.  But it didn't even open the
closet door.
1:42 - R for adult language and violent content
