   Despite the sci-fi concept of a man temporarily given the
ability to read women's minds and consequently to know what
they really desire, "What Women Want" is a conventional,
sappy romantic comedy, a retread of the usual relationships
explored by the film industry.  Fathers often make
misconnections with their teenaged daughters, male
executives with their female assistants, husband with wives. 
The strange thing about this movie helmed by Nancy Meyers
is that despite the extraordinary power given to advertising
executive Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson) literally to know what
every woman around him is thinking, Josh Goldsmith and
Cathy Yuspa's script contains not a single detail that we in
the audience do not already know.  We learn that a dress is
the most important item of concern to a fifteen-year-old girl
invited to the senior prom by her boyfriend.  We find out that
a woman with a reputation for bitchiness who has been hired
as creative director of an ad agency is not a bitch at all, and
that a T&A man can, under the proper circumstances,
become a sensitive listener with a newly found respect for
women after learning what they really think of him.  By
reading the mind of a server of coffee in a Chicago building's
lobby, we find out that she does not like being rejected.  Now,
those of you who do not have the ability to read women's
minds...which of these notions did you not already know?
   Filmed in Chicago, principally in the offices of a midtown ad
agency directed by an apprehensive Dan Wanamaker (Alan
Alda) and in Nick's spacious condo, the story gains impetus
from Wanamaker's attempt to revive a lagging business by
snagging the coveted Nike women's sneakers account. 
Needing a creative director who understands the way a
woman thinks, he bypasses Nick for the promotion, instead
going with the assertive director of a competing agency,
Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt)--who then works closely with
Nick as her subordinate.  Little does Darcy know that
because of a freak accident with a hair dryer, Nick has been
given the novel ability to hear what women think, a power he
uses both to steal Darcy's ideas and to listen in to both the
compliments he is secretly given by women for his sexiness
and the insults by those who think he's a jerk and worse.  To
counteract his reputation as a macho man who never really
listens to the females in his life, he raises his antennas to find
out what these folks really want and then, showing great
sensitivity to their needs, he gives it to them--changing their
opinions of him for the better.
   Though essentially a comedy, "What Women Want" pulls
almost mercilessly on the heartstrings as Nick takes action to
prevent the suicide of an office worker he'd ignored and to
service a coffee worker who in the past needed to fake
orgasms which she heretofore was unable to achieve
because of her partners' lack of tenderness.  Mel Gibson
relies on his usual mannerisms--rolling eyes, revolving head,
nice-guy smile, to convey his emotions to a movie audience
that is unable to read minds, while Helen Hunt, a fine
performer not always fortunate in her choice of films, does
not convince us that she's head over heels with her co-
worker.  During the two kissing scenes, Dean Cundey's
camera tries to make up for their lack of chemistry by
presenting their embrace from various angles while music
supervisor Bonnie Greenberg-Goodman pumps up the great
classics like "Night and Day" whether or not the Cole Porter
song or several others have much relationship to the tale. 
Too bad an uncredited Bette Midler is on camera for precious
few minutes.
   The one scene that gives away director Nancy Meyer's
attempt to appeal to an adolescent mentality involves Nick's
being caught by his daughter and her boy friend while
dressing in a woman's panty-hose, shaving his legs, and
donning nail polish--all in the service of researching a
woman's psyche by becoming as close to a woman himself
as he dares.  If that encourages you to roar with laughter,
this is the movie for you.
Rated PG-13.  Running time: 123 minutes.  (C) 2000 by

So men, what could you do if you could read women's minds?  And women, 
wouldn't it be wonderful if your guy knew what you really wanted rather 
than what he incorrectly thought you wanted?  (And what if your man were 
Mel Gibson?)
In WHAT WOMEN WANT, director Nancy Meyers, working from a stellar script 
by Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa, creates the perfect Christmas gift 
for holiday viewers.  As a comedy, it is side-splittingly funny with 
laughs so big that you'll have to see it again to hear all of the lines.  
As a love story, it is infectiously romantic, with great songs ("I've 
Got You Under My Skin") and some old-fashioned "making out" with 
wonderful kissing.  And as a touching drama, it has tender, poignant 
moments that are completely honest.  Wrapped by cinematographer Dean 
Cundey with lush colors, the gift is so carefully conceived and executed 
that we almost feel compelled to send Paramount Pictures a Thank You 
card.
As the story opens, we meet playboy Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson), a man's 
man who has no problem embarrassing his female office staff with lewd 
jokes.  He is Mr. Suave, and, after years of being "the king of the T&A 
ads," for the advertising agency in which he works, Mr. Ultra Confidence 
is about to be promoted to Creative Director.
Or he was, until the agency's head, Dan Wanamaker (Alan Alda), decided 
that they needed a woman to better understand the female market.  Dan 
hires Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt), whom Nick believes to be "a bitch on 
wheels" and a "man-eater," in other words, his opposite.
Given a homework assignment by Darcy, Nick applies nail polish, performs 
hot wax exfoliation and tries on pantyhose in order to understand what 
women think about the products that they use.  With sweetly humorous 
displays of physical comedy in this cross-dressing scene, Gibson reels 
in any audience members not yet under his spell.  Our audience went wild 
during this sequence, which turned out to be but one of many amazing 
scenes.  
One memorable moment occurs when Nick, alone in his Chicago penthouse, 
begins to lip-synch while doing a Fred Astaire-style dance number, 
complete with black hat.  Gibson is nothing short of incredible in his 
part.
A shock to Nick's system gives him the ability to read women's minds.  
At first, this scares the daylights out of him.  He learns, for example, 
not to go near a cosmetics counter of a department store, lest the 
cacophony of sounds come close to exploding his brain.  It's frightening 
to hear the mental put-downs of his co-workers.  He becomes so gun-shy 
and fearful that he seems to be hyperventilating.  His "gift" for 
eavesdropping becomes a near death experience for him.
Nick's old analyst, Dr. Perkins (Bette Midler), first recognizes the 
possibilities of his new powers.  "If men are from Mars and women are 
from Venus, you speak Venusian," she tells him.  This, she concludes, 
means that "You can rule."
Sure enough, rule is exactly what he does.  But he becomes somewhat of a 
benevolent ruler, who sees what he can do for everyone from his 
estranged 15-year-old daughter to the suicidal nerd, a self-described 
"geek in the glasses," who is a poorly treated messenger in his office.  
Mainly, however, he believes that he can use his newfound abilities to 
steal Darcy's job, which he thinks rightly belongs to him.  With a 
she's-going-down attitude, he runs circles around her by expropriating 
her ideas after she thinks them.  Of course, along the way, they fall in 
love, complicating his plans.  Hunt's performance, while not quite at 
Gibson's level, is extremely likeable.  The great chemistry between them 
is one of the show's many delights.
Nick's mind-reading abilities make him a lover straight out of 
Cosmopolitan.  He knows exactly what women want in bed.  Lola (Marisa 
Tomei), the sex-starved coffee store worker who finally agrees to date 
him, calls him "a sex god" after their "life-altering sex."   
As Mr. Personality, every woman in the office starts coming to Nick for 
advice.  Gibson turns the charm on the audience as well.  With or 
without the ability to read women's minds, I predict that most women 
will leave the theater totally in love with Gibson after this 
performance.  To be fair, many already are.
Comedies aren't normally good at character development.  Romantic 
comedies are better but they usually only flesh out the two leads.  
Since the writers in WHAT WOMEN WANT are able to have every minor 
characters share their innermost thoughts with us, we get to know and 
care about characters who have only minuscule screen time.  One of the 
best of many small subplots concerns the aforementioned messenger.  We 
sympathize with her plight, even if she has only a few lines.  The 
writers milk them for the emotional equivalent of heavy cream.
The film goes down as smoothly as a glass of Christmas eggnog.  The only 
complaint possible is that it is such a heart-warming story that you 
don't want it to stop.  But stop it does with an ending as satisfying as 
the rest of the picture.  This is a movie in which it's easy to fall in 
love.
WHAT WOMEN WANT runs 2:06 but feels a half-hour shorter.  It is rated 
PG-13 for sexual content and language and would be fine for teenagers.

Somehow the whole feminist movement passed Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson) by.  
He's a cigar-chomping, skirt-chasing, male-chauvinist ad executive who was 
raised by Las Vegas showgirls (really).  But his worldview is shaken when, 
instead of promoting Nick, his boss (Alan Alda) hires Darcy McGuire (Helen 
Hunt) to be creative director.  Nick, it seems, is behind the times because 
women now dominate the marketplace.  Trying to cope with this strange new 
world that he has somehow managed to ignore up 'til now, Nick tries leg wax, 
panty-hose, and mascara, but while he's still a transvestite Nick 
accidentally electrocutes himself.  Rather than killing him or burning off 
all his hair, the sudden shock gives him the ability to hear what women are 
thinking.  (Apparently "Unbreakable" isn't the only current film with a 
superhero motif because this women's underwear + electricity = psychic powers 
equation has the same logic as radiation + spider bite = Spider-man.  If only 
Mel had donned a colorful costume and fought crime as Female Thought-Hearing 
Lad.  Ru Paul could have played the villain.  But I digress . . . ).
Nick is surprised to find that most of the women around him think he's a pig. 
 He finds lots of uses for his new ability:  giving a coffee shop waitress 
(Marisa Tomei) the best sex she's ever had, getting closer to his teenage 
daughter (Ashley Johnson), saving a potential suicide victim, and showing up 
Darcy at work by proposing her ideas as soon as she thinks of them.  But he 
never counted on falling in love . . .
"What Women Want" is either "classic" (what my wife calls it) or "outdated" 
(what I call it).  For Pete's sake, the soundtrack is dominated by Frank 
Sinatra songs!  "WWW" should have been made forty years ago with Rock Hudson 
and Doris Day because it has the same "taming of a playboy" plot as "Pillow 
Talk."  Back then, revealing the erotic thoughts of women would have been 
progressive; now it plays like a sitcom.  Screenwriters Josh Goldsmith and 
Cathy Yuspa (who actually work on a sitcom, "The King of Queens") generate 
some laughs, particularly in the scene where Nick waxes his legs (his 
reaction:  "Why would anyone do that more than once?  Why would anyone even 
do the other leg?").  However, "WWW" doesn't offer any new insights into the 
complexities of the female psyche.  Anyone who's ever watched an episode of 
"Oprah" knows as much as Nick finds out.  If it were all boiled down, What 
Women Want is to be treated with respect.  Aretha Franklin already said it 
more eloquently, more clearly, and more succinctly. 
Although this is only her second feature as a director (the remake of "The 
Parent Trap" was her first), as a screenwriter Nancy Meyers made a specialty 
of light, nonthreatening pseudo-feminist films like "Private Benjamin," 
"Protocol," and "Baby Boom."  But I think What Women really Want are movies 
that don't shy away from controversy or complexity.  While I'm glad to see 
Mel Gibson in something nonviolent for a change, I wish it were a more 
substantial film.
Bottom Line:  This is what women wanted forty years ago.
Traffic
Reviewed by Christian Pyle
Directed by Steven Soderbergh
Written by Stephen Gaghan (based on the miniseries by Simon Moore)
Starring Michael Douglas, Don Cheadle, Benicio Del Toro, Erika Christensen, 
Luis Guzman, and Catherine Zeta-Jones
Grade:  C+
"Traffic" has the good fortune of going into wide release after receiving 
Golden Globe nominations and numerous critical top-ten list postings.  
Without much competition, it will probably do well at the Oscars, but despite 
good intentions and some impressive moments, "Traffic" fails to achieve its 
goals.
Rather than centering on a central protagonist, "Traffic" weaves together 
three major storylines:  a) Judge Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) becomes 
the new drug czar while his daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen) becomes a 
drug addict; b) Mexican cop Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) 
pursues the Tijuana drug cartel and becomes allied with General Arturo 
Salazar (Tomas Milian), who seeks the same goal for his own reasons; and c) 
DEA agents Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzman) watch 
Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones) after arresting her drug-dealing husband 
(Steven Bauer).  Director Steven Soderbergh lacks the grace of Robert Altman, 
but he manages to keep all three storylines running simultaneously without 
losing the audience.
The primary reason "Traffic" doesn't fully succeed is that it wants to be 
several different movies:  a thought-provoking indictment of the failed "war 
on drugs," a portrait of addiction, and a gripping crime drama.  Perhaps a 
more talented director than Soderbergh might have been able to pull off this 
triple threat, but "Traffic" only manages to partially fulfill its goals.  
The critique of the methods and ideology of the drug war is spotty and often 
awkward (particularly when minor characters suddenly launch into speeches on 
subjects like the effect of NAFTA on drug traffic).  There's only one drug 
addict in the movie, which seems odd for an issue-driven film on the Drug 
Problem, and that one is unsympathetic.  Caroline Wakefield comes off as a 
spoiled brat, and her descent from prep school honor student to junkie whore 
doesn't elicit the pathos it should.  Erika Christensen does nothing to 
humanize her character.
Its strongest area is the crime drama vein with the parallel stories of 
Mexican and American cops who pursue the same cartel from different ends of 
the supply chain.  Especially compelling is Javier's plight.  An honest cop 
working within a corrupt system, Javier walks a winding and dangerous road 
paved with compromises.  Benicio Del Toro gives a remarkable performance.  A 
film like this tests the ability of an actor to develop his character with 
limited screen time.  Del Toro communicates more with a pensive look than 
most actors can with a soliloquy.
Also passing with high marks:  Don Cheadle and Michael Douglas.  I'm pleased 
that after so many wonderful supporting performances, Cheadle has gotten 
name-above-the-title recognition with this film.  He has great chemistry with 
Guzman (who deserves some recognition of his own).  I expected Robert 
Wakefield to be a heavy, but Douglas makes us feel the concern Robert has for 
his daughter.  
In contrast, the challenge of her first substantial role proves that 
Catherine Zeta-Jones has no acting ability whatsoever.  Her character has to 
go from being a high society wife whose world is overturned to a cop-killing 
drug dealer.  However, Zeta-Jones' performance shows no internal conflict or 
transformation.  She could be one of the worst actors in Hollywood.
In case you haven't guessed, I'm not a Soderbergh fan.  Ever since he came on 
the scene with "sex, lies, and videotape" in 1989, I've dismissed him as 
pretentious hack.  He's the valedictorian of the "Look at me, I'm an auteur" 
school of filmmaking.  (His classmates include Spike Lee and Oliver Stone).  
This style is characterized by an oppressive directorial presence that often 
undercuts the effectiveness of the film.  In "Traffic," Soderbergh joins the 
current trend toward monochromatic tints.  Douglas' scenes often have a blue 
tint while Del Toro's are yellow and grainy.  Luckily the power of those 
actors performances is not impeded by the distraction, but the heavily 
stylized approach seems a poor choice for a film that aspires to realism.
For those who like to play It's Ol' What's His Name, the supporting cast 
includes Dennis Quaid, Miguel Ferrer, Topher Grace (from "That 70's Show"), 
Amy Irving. Peter Riegert, Benjamin Bratt, Albert Finney, Salma Hayek, James 
Brolin, and several real-life senators (including Orrin Hatch, who does not 
read from "The Exorcist").
Bottom Line:  Doesn't deserve most of the Oscars it will win

What if a man could hear what was in a woman's mind? What if you were a woman 
standing on the street, and a man was standing there with you listening to 
every thought you had, that's exactly what happens in Director Nancy Meyers 
delightfully new comedy "What Women Want" starring an all star cast with Mel 
Gibson, Helen Hunt, Lauren Holly, and Marisa Tomei. 
Nick Marshall is your typical businessman: Low-key, abrasive, comical, 
charming, handsome. He has a daughter Alex who is a typical 15-year old, and 
while her Mom and new Step Dad is on their honeymoon, she stays with Nick for 
a few weeks. Many things however are going to change in Nick's life, he has a 
new boss Darcy Maguire (played fantastically by Helen Hunt), his daughter is 
planning on having sex, and after having an accident involving a bathtub, 
dryer, and women's accessories, Nick is about to change forever: He can head 
what women are thinking.
Surprised by this new thing he has, Nick isn't sure what to do with this, and 
while his job status is starting to dwindle down to nothing, his daughter 
hates him, and a woman is in love with him, Nick isn't sure what to do! After 
meeting with his old shrink Dr. Perkins (Bette Midler who in a small role is 
memorable) he realizes that he may just be the luckiest guy in the world. So 
he uses it the best he can, and when his company is offered a new account he 
uses this skill to come up with the best ideas he can. However obviously 
there is some downsides, he can hear what every woman is thinking about, 
about him, about someone else...and even his daughter.
"What Women Want" is a hilarious romantic comedy, guided throughout with a 
great performance from Mel Gibson, he dominates the screen throughout the 
slow parts, and through the cleverly written script. He brings the character 
of Nick Marshall to the screen, and embeds himself in our minds. Helen Hunt 
(her third appearance on the big screen this year, her fourth is released a 
week after this "Cast Away") clocks in yet another great performance right 
behind her "Pay It Forward" performance. She is a talented actress, and I am 
glad to see her in a role that seems to fit her quite well.
The rest of the supporting cast includes a wonderful performance by Marisa 
Tomei (too bad she hasn't had many jobs lately, she is an excellent actress), 
a funny performance from Loretta Devine, and a memorable cameo by the Diva 
herself Bette Midler. These people support the main cast, and to me it was 
the performers themselves who kept this movie afloat it's lengthy 126 minutes.
Nancy Meyers is a talented director, and this is no letdown, she does a great 
job directing the film, with some nice cinematography, but again the biggest 
flaw of the film is that is seems to go on and on and on, and almost an hour 
and forty minutes into it I started wriggling in my seat, knowing there was 
another twenty minutes left. 
Although with this flaw in the end "What Women Want" is a treat for fans of 
Gibson and Hunt, they give great performances, and the movie is completely 
and totally entertaining throughout, go ahead give it a try and find out 
"What Women Want".

Can Mel Gibson ever do any wrong? Even when he stars in a goofy picture such
as this, he still manages to come out smelling like a rose. Unfortunately, a
solid performance by Mel, charming as usual, and the great shots of him
without his shirt, you can bounce quarters of that six-pack of his, still
don't save this film from saying very little about anything. It's a very,
very "surface" kind of movie...with lots of songs packed into its
best-selling soundtrack-to-be. Great performance by Mel, enjoyable overused
tunes and a few funny moments and you've got yourself a perfect example of a
"video date movie".
PLOT:
A macho, rich, jerk suddenly gets the power to read women's minds and
decides to use it to help him make his life better. He wants to better his
job, better the relationship he has with his daughter and better the way
that he treats the women in his life. Will it work? Will it fall apart? Will
we be suffocated by the many cute "Mel" moments before being treated to an
actual story? Find out below.
CRITIQUE:
See Mel Gibson dance around by himself to Sinatra tunes. Hear Mel do his
best Sean Connery impression. See Mel walking around shirtless half the
movie. Hear Mel sweet talk women and become a sensitive guy overnight. See
Mel relate to his daughter over a loud montage featuring Christina
Aguilera's "What A Girl Wants", as she tries on different prom dresses.
Sigh. See women swoon as all of this takes place on the big screen. Hear men
moan as they sit there next to their ladies. This one ain't for us, fellas.
In fact, I wouldn't even recommend this to any women either, unless they
were just looking for a fluffy ol' time. This movie has a great premise, and
I mean a GREAT one! Here's a man who by some crazy fluke of an accident, can
actually hear what women think. Wow. Isn't that a great way to start a
movie? Yup, sure is. Unfortunately, the makers of this movie decided to
concentrate more on the number of musical interludes that they would have in
the film, rather than any actual story! Let's add another Sinatra number
here, and another cool song from the soundtrack there, and wouldn't it be
cool if we added a montage with another song playing as Mel moves from place
to place here? Uuuuuhmm, I guess someone forget to tell the filmmakers that
they were actually producing a movie...not a soundtrack!
Ugh, one of the most blatantly commercial movies to come down the pike in a
long time. And by commercial, I mean a film so OBVIOUSLY created for a
certain target audience. We've got the sad sack emotionally vulnerable
character drifting in and out of the movie, for the sake of depth.
Disposable secondary characters based on their obvious proclivity to the
target audience (females 30-45). Remember who women chose as the most
sensitive guy back in the old days? Alan Alda, that's right, he's in this
movie! And what's any "chick flick" without Bette Midler. Oy vey, is right!
I don't know, maybe I've seen too many of these types of movies in my day
and the whole schtick is getting to be a little too see-through for me, but
even without the obvious manipulative stuff going on behind the scenes, the
story here is really quite underdeveloped. Mel gets this great power and
does barely anything with it. He makes a few cute remarks to the ladies
around his office, he uses it for obvious relationship reasons, he uses it
to suck up to his daughter's friends...very flighty stuff.
And despite several cute and funny moments, especially the whole scene in
bed with Marisa Tomei (tough shoot, hey Marisa?), the film just never really
does much with its initial great concept. In fact, the wrap-up of Mel's
newfound "power" is handled in an extremely clumsy way. Things just never
seem to go under any type of surface in this movie, but if that's the kind
of film that you're looking, then you might just enjoy this fluff piece. And
no offense to Helen Hunt, whom I consider to be a solid actress, but am I
the only one that's a bit Helen-ed out? That's four movies with her in the
past six weeks! Phew. At least she had a "tan" in this one, despite the lack
of color in her character's persona. This film is a study into the art of
Nora Ephron romance movies gone awry!

When I go to the movies as frequently as I do, I eavesdrop on people's responses. I can tell you that after I sat through a screening of "What Women Want," what women want is Mel Gibson, pure and simple. Gibson is often a delight to watch in this movie but he is not allowed to break loose and neither is most of the cast. What remains is an insipid, boring, snail-paced romantic comedy that trashes the outrageous concept it has in store. That can't be what women want. 
Gibson plays Nick Marshall, a self-important womanizer and ad executive (aren't they all in these kinds of movies?), who one day has a freak accident while trying out new women's products. Nick suddenly develops the ability to hear women's innermost thoughts (not to mention a female poodle!), their desires, wants, and essentially what they are really thinking when on a date or having sex or walking by him. Nick is annoyed at first at this magical new sense, but he learns to use it to his liking. He has his eye on the cafe waitress (played with alarming zing and smooth sex appeal by Marisa Tomei), who apparently wants Nick sexually. This works in Nick's favor, and the irony is that Nick has not changed much, he just knows what women want from him and he learns to listen to them as much as anything else. 
"What Women Want" has a terrific premise that is squandered by far too many subplots. There is the silly romance betweeen Nick and the new boss of the agency, Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt), a position Nick had coveted. Hunt and Gibson have zero chemistry and so their romance barely lit my fire. 
Then there is the whole song-and-dance about Nick's teenage daughter whom he is trying to understand and come to terms with - there is even a cliched montage where she dresses up in various prom dances to the tune of a pop song. How many more of those do we need? 
And to add more insult to injury, there is the suicidal worker in the agency whose thoughts naturally register to Nick. Nick sees trouble and tries to save her but what the heck does any of this have to do with the movie's main focus on Nick's superb ability, often leading to bedding women? It just feels tacked on as a simple-minded moral statement about using one's uncommon gift to good advantage. Oh, please!
The problem is that "What Women Want" does not truly exploit its central idea - a man listening to and hearing women's thoughts is ripe for lots of imaginative scenes. And what if Nick had another freak accident and could hear men too? The possibilities are endless. Think of "Being John Malkovich" which took its idea of people entering the mind of Malkovich and milked it for all it was worth. The difference is that "What Women Want" doesn't have the courage of the former - it wants to be a chick flick where women can swoon over the close-ups of Gibson's face and restrained charm while he tries to romance Helen Hunt. Hunt is so vapid in this movie and Gibson becomes so monotonous in his comic delivery (save for the final scene between him and Tomei) that audiences, particularly women, are more likely to groan.

Whew. I must admit I had expected to spend at least some of this 2-hour 
production wincing at a suspiciously non-grey-haired Mel Gibson playing 
his cute card to death. But, like "Charlie's Angels," my fears of 
gritting teeth were pleasantly all for naught. "What Women Want" boldly 
goes where other romantic-comedies have only flirted -- straight into 
the heads of women. 
Mel, raised in Las Vegas by a true blue showgal, could grow up but one 
way: a man's man, with a definitive idea of a woman's role in society 
(namely the bedroom). The story's beginning finds Mel, a successful 
advertising creator, in a firm soon to change its artistic direction. 
Helen Hunt steps in to remind this chauvinistic team that the market has 
shifted from male-minded consumers to decision making women, hence an 
about-face in advertisement strategy is in line. Of course, Mel has an 
unflattering "b" word for his new boss. 
Ah, but due to a freak accident (whose timing couldn't have been 
better), Mel acquires the supernatural power to actually hear women's 
thoughts. How this comes to pass is completely hysterical and I have no 
intention of ruining that for you. 
In fact, this movie provides plenty of hysterical moments. Our 
particular crowd busted its collective gut intermittently throughout the 
picture. In fact, they applauded graciously at fade to credits. 
Mel and Helen are expectedly on the mark, but Marisa Tomei in a smaller 
role rips up the screen with her natural talent. 
Barely a few sticky scenes could have been reworked, the sex roles are 
rather stereotyped, and having Mel react adversely to his new "power" 
seemed at first trite and contrived; but the overwhelming current of the 
film's fresh dialogue and crisp humor quickly eclipse these 
shortcomings.

Hot shot advertising exec Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson) thinks he's God's gift
to women, but after one big jolt gives him the power to hear womens' 
thoughts he's about to get another jolt as he discovers "What Women Want."
Nick Marshall has been fawned over by women since he was the only child
of a single Las Vegas showgirl mom.  His housekeeper babies him, his
doorwoman (Loretta Devine) ogles him, and the girl at his coffee shop
(Marisa Tomei) flirts with him.  He's a guy's guy ad exec, adept at
luring men to cars, booze and smokes with gorgeous babes.  But it's no
longer the 80's and women are a huge part of the consumer demographic,
so Nick's boss Dan Wanamaker (Alan Alda) pulls the rug out from under
him by bypassing him and hiring Cleo winner Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt)
as Sloane Carter's creative director.
Darcy immediate challenges her new team to come in the next day and
pitch one or more of the female products she's distributed to them all
in pink boxes.  Nick goes home, gets drunk, dances to Sinatra, and then
attacks his assignment by polishing his nails, waxing his legs and
donning pantyhose.  Then he has an accident involving a bathtub and a
hair dryer.  The electrocution doesn't kill him, but he awakens the next
day to discover he can hear women's thoughts.  Now he can get Lola (Tomei)
into bed and use Darcy's own thoughts to steal her job.
Screenwriters Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa (TV's "The King of Queens")
take a potentially amusing concept and bury it.  Nick is a jerk who's
given jaw dropping advice by a female psychiatrist (Bette Midler) to
use his newfound gift to empower himself over women.  Very few of the 
thoughts emanating from women in the streets' heads ring true, although
more effort has been made with Darcy and Lola.  No effort is made for Nick
to put any spin on what he hears - often he just repeats what he's heard
back to the woman who's just thought it.  After pursuing Lola for
what appears to have been an extended period of time, Nick wins her over
by playing to her fears.  After he beds and forgets her, having become
entangled with Darcy, Lola appears and demands an explanation.  The one that's
give - he's gay.  This is some seriously bad writing.
Mel Gibson has some fun with the role and proves that he can move into
the romantic comedy genre.  His Fred Astaire turn to Sinatra's "I Won't
Dance" is admirable, although the work that went into it shows.  He's
undercut by the writing which muddles his motivation with Darcy, but gains
sympathy in a 'learning to be a dad' subplot with his teenage daughter
Alex (Ashley Johnson, "Anywhere But Here") and another subplot involving
an unnoticed, mousy file clerk.
Hunt is believable as a vulnerable woman finding herself in a position of
power.  Tomei is appealing, if badly treated by the script.  The highly 
billed Mark Feuerstein ("Woman on Top") makes little impression as Nick's 
buddy Morgan.  The film also features Lauren Holly as Nick's ex and Delta 
Burke and Valerie Perrine as Nick's adoring office assistants.
What women may want is better romantic material for Mel Gibson.

Want to be satisfied that you got your money's worth out of a movie?  The 
striking thing about Nancy Meyers' WHAT WOMEN WANT is that as a romantic 
comedy, it gets the job done.
No, it's not important or profound, and it does not even have a solid 
ending.  But for the 126-minute run of WHAT WOMEN WANT, I was entertained.
Mel Gibson is to be admired for trying his hand at so many different genres. 
  So well known for his epic revenge films BRAVEHEART and this past summer's 
THE PATRIOT, as well as for the LETHAL WEAPON series, Gibson here takes the 
chance at failing at the risky chemistry of romance.  But he does not fail.  
In its initial minutes the film does a nice job of explaining Nick Marshall 
 Gibson's character:  he's a misogynistic pig, a politically incorrect 
relic whom women find irresistible.  We discover that he was raised by a 
mother who was a showgirl in Las Vegas, and he grew up surrounded by 
situations demeaning to women.  This does not excuse his behavior as an 
adult, of course, but seems to predict a noticeable change in his sexist 
persona by picture's end.
A star at Sloan Curtis Advertising in Chicago, Nick is divorced (the small 
part of his ex played by Lauren Holly), and has a 15 year-old daughter 
(Ashley Johnson).  He's not been much of a dad, though the artifice of his 
daughter staying with him for a while sets him up finally to spend time with 
her.
What jolts him out of complacency is Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt), who is 
hired by Mr. Wanamaker as the new creative director of the ad agency.  (Alan 
Alda does one of the many cameos, as Wanamaker  a wonderfully fluent 
performance.)  So the stud Marshall has to play second banana to this 
younger woman.
One of the factors responsible for the fluff factor is the premise of 
reading women's minds.  For some reason involving fate and electricity, Nick 
is electrocuted  though not fatally  and acquires this at first 
overwhelming talent.  Of course his life changes drastically, as he adjusts 
to the weirdness;  Meyers makes ingenious use of the idea, especially when 
Nick is bombarded by the inner worlds of every female he comes across, even 
the mental minutia of a French poodle!  Once he can cope, will Nick use the 
power for good or evil  or both?  It certainly does not make for a 
believable movie, but it is an interesting one, a story which would 
fascinate James Thurber or other writers preoccupied with the `war' between 
men and women.
One gripe I have is the film's over-exposure.  I have seen theatrical 
trailers at least five times in the past two months, and countless 
television ads.  A problem here is that contemporary previews give away so 
many of the best parts of the film.  What's worst is that a key word from 
the script (by Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa) is actually changed  cleaned 
up, I suppose  before the clip was run on TV.  It would have been nice to 
see some more surprises among the memorable moments.
Mel Gibson is becoming very proficient at his craft.  He carries so many 
scenes here with his dogged attitude and good humor.  In scenes in which he 
clowns to a Sinatra song, flipping a fedora from his foot onto his noggin, 
Gibson is charming.  Ditto when he dances with a coat rack.  But he is still 
no Cary Grant.  Gibson's timing is good enough, though he seems uneasy in a 
few scenes.  No star is worth more than 20 million dollars a picture, so 
there is no question here, but this star does turn in a solid performance.
And so does Helen Hunt.  Although director Meyers permits the camera to 
linger a bit long on Hunt's aquiline face during her reaction shots, and the 
script gives her the word `OK' to utter too many times (as she did in AS 
GOOD AS IT GETS, in which she also dated an older man!), Hunt registers 
another reliable performance here.
A subplot with Lola (Marisa Tomei) goes just about nowhere.  It's funny that 
I did not blame Nick Marshall for leading on Lola  at the same time he was 
falling in love with Darcy.  It occurs to me now too that Nick could have 
been portrayed as more conniving as he undermined Darcy's authority in her 
new job, even stealing her ideas.  Instead, Nick comes off as a rather 
benign rascal; even his daughter's girlfriends like him after he tailors his 
behavior upon hearing their mental condemnations.
Good Christmas season fare: that's WHAT WOMEN WANT.  It's a lark and a 
laugh, nothing heavyweight  though neither is it mindless pap.  Like the 
commercialized products you see around this time of year, the film has had 
any substance removed to please the most general audience

     Over twenty years into a ridiculously successful film career, Mel
Gibson chose 2000 to do a pure comedy for the first time  and it seems
terribly unfair that he appears so good at it. Gibson has always had
tremendous charm on screen, and his light touch provided most of the best
moments in the LETHAL WEAPON series, but he has shied away from roles that
showcased those elements of his personality. In WHAT WOMEN WANT, he never
once picks up a gun of any kind. He picks up a hairdryer, and he still
kills. Mel Gibson delivers a wonderfully entertaining comic performance in
WHAT WOMEN WANT, the kind of performance that should make for classic
comedy.
     We'll forgive Gibson on grounds of inexperience for not choosing the
sort of script that could show off his newfound comic chops. WHAT WOMEN
WANT, a film that could have been GROUNDHOG DAY brilliant, comes out
merely adequate thanks to a script that's about two re-writes away from
being ready. Gibson stars as Nick Marshall, a divorced Chicago advertising
executive, man's man and career chauvinist. Nick expects to be promoted to
creative director, but his boss (Alan Alda) instead opts to bring in Darcy
Maguire (Helen Hunt) to provide the sensitivity to women's concerns Nick
clearly lacks. Then a twist of fate -- and an electric shock -- endows
Nick with the ability to hear women's thoughts. It's a gift Nick fears at
first, until he realizes he can use it to his advantage in any number of
ways, including undermining Darcy.
     WHAT WOMEN WANT is a gimmick movie, which can easily turn into an
empty marketing-friendly concept without some competent execution. In Mel
Gibson, they have a more than competent star to execute that gimmick. Mel
knocks out every twist of character and goofy situation he's handed, from
the swagger of the opening scenes to his broader physical gags to his
quiet moments with Hunt. He sells the humor in a macho guy both playing
sensitive and actually becoming sensitive. It's not jaw-dropping film
acting by any means, but it's so deft with the fluffy material that you'd
think he'd been doing it all his life.
     I wish the same could be said of the writers. At over two hours, WHAT
WOMEN WANT is a textbook example of a film with no sense of its story's
essential elements. There's a lengthy, unnecessary prologue
psychoanalyzing Nick's relationship with his Vegas showgirl mother;
there's a lengthy scene of Nick dancing in his apartment to Frank Sinatra;
there's an encounter between Nick and a therapist that exists only for the
sake of a distracting cameo. Supporting characters pack the fringes of
every frame, giving Nick sub-plots with a suicidal co-worker, his teenage
daughter (Ashley Johnson), and a high-strung coffee shop cashier (Marisa
Tomei). There's hardly a scene in WHAT WOMEN WANT that doesn't feel like
it should either be a minute shorter or absent altogether. Instead of
making all the necessary plot and character points efficiently the first
time, screenwriters Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa opt to make the same
point multiple times, just so we don't miss it.
     There are definitely some worthwhile individual moments to make up
for the sloppy structure. Some of them are pure script moments, like the
internal monologue Nick hears while trying to show off his sexual prowess.
Others are combinations of script and performance, like Gibson's drunken
experimentation with a number of women's products. And many of them are
purely showcases for the actors -- including Hunt, who tames her patrician
chilliness and delivers her most engaging big screen comic performance.
This is really a star vehicle, though, and if it provides any enjoyment,
it's from the pleasure of watching a macho man have so much fun doing
something he's never done before. Give credit to director Nancy Meyers for
finding this performance in Mel Gibson. Give credit to Mel Gibson for
finding this performance in himself. And next time, let's hope we can give
him credit for picking better material.

If you looked like Mel Gibson, being able to read women's minds wouldn't
be too imperative.  Just give 'em those baby blues and flash those
pearly whites, and you're in, baby.  Or so you'd think.  In What Women
Want, directed by relationship comedy veteran Nancy Meyers, Gibson's
character gets the real scoop on what the fairer sex thinks about him,
and boy, is he in trouble.  But his problems are the viewer's fortune.
As all-star Chicago ad man Nick Marshall, Gibson is awash in the
stereotypical world of a man's man.  Ogling chicks, living high on the
hog, and being a major player is his life.  He has unending
self-confidence just because he can bed babes, but ho, what he doesn't
know....
See, Nick's not too receptive to women when they, well, speak, and he's
not beneath ordering them around either.  Enter Darcy Maguire (Helen
Hunt), a young hottie hired as Nick's boss, who gets the job that he's
been eyeing.  Fifteen years ago, that alone would've been good movie
fodder (as in Nine to Five and Working Girl), but here the idea's been
amped up.
While drunk and stupid, Nick tries on various women's products in order
to get into ladies' minds and maybe impress the boss with a new idea. 
One freaky electrical accident later, and Nick discovers he can actually
steal the boss' ideas -- straight from her own thoughts.  If women think
it, Nick hears it.
It's about as high concept as today's comedies get, and guided by
Meyers' fine-tuned hand, it really works (she wrote Protocol and Baby
Boom, and wrote/directed the satisfying update of The Parent Trap). 
Meyers, working from an impressive debut script by King of Queens
writers Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa, showcases the obvious advantages
and pitfalls of such an insane power, and lets Gibson show off the
superstar gloss that nearly defines him.  But the major plus is the
film's big-time, old-school Hollywood feel, from the directing to the
costumes to the set design. 
In throwback style, Nick's not just a sexist -- he's a stinkin' male
chauvinist pig.  And he's not wealthy -- he's filthy rich.  He moves
like a movie star, thinks on his feet, and calls women "babe."  With his
swagger and good looks, and Alan Silvestri's big-band-baby music behind
him, Gibson's Nick recalls a big businessman that may have been played
by Clark Gable.  And his goofy way with women once he obtains his powers
feels like an old Preston Sturges or Frank Capra movie.  (I'm guessing
Meyers was going for that; You Can't Take It With You is the play at
Nick's daughter's school.)
There are some scenes that Meyers really should've chopped -- such as an
inexcusable MTVesque montage of Nick helping his kid (Ashley Johnson)
pick out a prom dress -- but in all, the scenes stay funny and even pack
a few surprises.
Gibson hams it up a little too much for my taste, but the fun he has as
Nick is infectious.  Helen Hunt is, well, The Helen Hunt Character, but
she remains a competent actor that can make good things happen on
screen.  Alan Alda is a solid co-star as Nick and Darcy's boss, and
Marisa Tomei is excellent as a neurotic coffee slinger pining for
companionship.  With her range and abilities, I wish she had been given
the role of Darcy.
But when Darcy and Nick do connect (c'mon, of course they do!), Meyers
successfully holds on to that old-style feel.  One simple rendezvous
carries a sweet, romantic wistfulness within the perfect backdrop of a
small booth at an elegant jazz club.  Bogey would've loved it.  Meyers
has done more than just pay homage to the old Hollywood romantic comedy
-- it would appear that she has actually made one.

Reviewed by Dustin Putman, December 16, 2000.
In, amazingly, the first romantic comedy of his career, Mel Gibson (2000's 
"The Patriot") fits perfectly within the framework of director Nancy Meyers' 
"What Women Want," a film with a truly fascinating and clever premise that 
nevertheless collapses under the weight of everything that surrounds the 
central storyline. Intermittently entertaining with excessive dry spots 
amidst the fun, the movie not only overstays its welcome by at least 30 
minutes, but never takes off the way it should.
Successful ad slogan man Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson) has a beautiful skyrise 
apartment, makes loads of money, and is expected to become the new Creative 
Director of the Sloan Curtis Agency in Chicago. He's also a male chauvinist 
pig who constantly is taking advantage of the women in his life, whether it 
be for a one-night-stand or to use for his own professional wants. When word 
comes that Nick's boss (Alan Alda) has bypassed him for a fresh female 
viewpoint in the form of Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt), Nick is none too 
pleased, hell-bent on upstaging her by thinking of the better slogan for a 
women's Nike commercial.
With his ex-wife Gigi (Lauren Holly) on her honeymoon, Nick is left to look 
after his estranged 15-year-old daughter, Alex (Ashley Johnson), but has 
never been a real father to her and isn't sure how to go about it now. While 
drunk one night trying on the latest female sales items that his agency is 
getting ready to promote, a freak accident leaves him nearly electrocuted to 
death. Awaking the next morning, Nick is, at first, shocked and then 
intrigued by being able to hear every woman's thoughts within distance of 
him. Using this as an advantage over the mystery of the opposite sex, as 
suggested by his psychiatrist (Bette Midler), Nick finds himself gradually 
getting in touch with his more emotional, feminine side, and begins to 
understand and sympathize with the women around him, including an unexpected 
budding attraction to Darcy.
Had this been the whole premise of "What Women Want," director Meyers and his 
actors would have been home-free, making an appropriately breezy 90-minute, 
bubblegum concoction. Instead, the subplots with extraneous supporting 
characters stack up so thickly that it's almost a chore wading through them 
all, and then watching each of their never-ending outcomes. There's Lola 
(Marisa Tomei), a struggling actress working at a coffee shop who has a mad 
crush on Nick. There's a meek office assistant (Judy Greer) ignored by 
everyone, and whom Nick learns is potentially suicidal. There's the male 
coworker (Mark Feuerstein) who fears everyone thinks he's gay when Nick 
overhears a woman's passing thoughts about him. There's the debate over the 
Nike slogan ad, and the sly plan of Nick's to steal all of Darcy's bright 
ideas from her head before she gets to verbalize them, only to pass them as 
his own. There's the upcoming prom night that Alex, Nick learns, is planning 
to lose her virginity to her grungy 18-year-old boyfriend (Eric Balfour) at. 
And there's more where that came from.
Nearly each and every one of the aforementioned subplots are well-written, 
and would work splendidly in a different movie. But not this one. "What Women 
Want" tries valiantly to cover so many different bases in its 2-hour-plus 
length that it ends up losing sight of its main purpose, coming off as merely 
overstuffed. Screenwriters Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa have a definite way 
with words, but aim far too high for such an obviously featherweight movie. 
Instead of enriching the film for the good, they only make themselves appear 
to be overly self-important by a half.
Where the film does excel is in its sparkling cast; it's just too bad not 
more of them are put to good use. From the beginning to the end, "What Women 
Want" is Gibson's movie all the way, and he manages to charm and seduce even 
when he's being his naturally smarmy self. Gibson has rarely been so loose 
and free-spirited on film before. Sharing the most screen time with Gibson is 
the hardworking Helen Hunt (2000's "Pay It Forward") in her third of four 
movies this year. Hunt is truly making a name for herself in the feature film 
world, and it only helps that she is an astoundingly talented, clearly 
dedicated performer who takes each of her roles seriously, but also knows how 
to have fun with them. Hunt's Darcy Maguire is a smart, strong-willed woman 
who isn't afraid to speak her mind, and it's generally easy to see why Nick 
becomes so smitten with her.
In the supporting cast arena, Ashley Johnson (1999's "Anywhere But Here") has 
the most significant role, and is highly effective as Nick's bitter daughter 
Alex. Johnson paints Alex as a realistic, likable, if occasionally stubborn 
teenager, and has what are questionably the best scenes in the movie, 
including a delightful montage of Nick helping her to pick a prom dress, and 
a late, heartfelt scene where, for the first time in her life, Alex finds 
herself being able to open up to her father.
Also a standout is Marisa Tomei (2000's "The Watcher"), as the neurotically 
sweet Lola. Tomei finds herself able to generate the same level of 
firecracker comedic presence that she demonstrated in her Oscar-winning role 
in 1992's "My Cousin Vinny." A sex scene between Nick and Lola is a comic 
highlight, and Tomei is so cute that it's a shame she is basically thrown 
away without any satisfying closure. Having the opposite problem is Judy 
Greer (1999's "Jawbreaker"), poignant as the depressed office secretary, who 
has a truthfully performed climactic scene, but hasn't had her subplot 
developed enough in the early stages to make the sort of powerful impact it 
aims for. Everyone else is window-dressing, developed only in the most 
scattershot, broad strokes imaginable, though Bette Midler (2000's "Drowning 
Mona") does delight in an unbilled cameo. Had she been in the movie more, it 
could have easily been her best film role in the last four or five years.
"What Women Want" is funny a lot of the time, and occasionally even a little 
touching. Director Nancy Meyers gratefully does not load on the corn factor, 
as she aims for more human portrayals. Everything is in place for a charmer 
of a romantic comedy, the type that mainstream audiences eat up (and they 
still might), but it isn't successful in the long run. The film is a long, 
overblown extravaganza complete with a nonstop music soundtrack, and even two 
dance sequences. The solo number with Nick dancing to Frank Sinatra, complete 
with a top hat and a coat rack, is impressive on a technical level, but comes 
out of nowhere, only helping to stack on an extra three or four minutes of 
superfluity. The concluding scene between Gibson and Hunt is also severely 
misguided and does not go out on a graceful note. Ultimately, "What Women 
Want" has the ability to be a winning diversion, but much like the character 
of Nick, it simply doesn't know when to stop.

Directed by Nancy Meyers. Screenplay by Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa,

Helen Hunter, Marisa Tomei. Running time: 128 minutes. Rated PG by the
MFCB. Reviewed on January 7th, 2001.
"What Women Want" is a classic example of writers conceiving an 
interesting idea, and then sitting back and putting no effort into 
developing an equally worthy script to go along with it. The result is a 
promising core let down by hopelessly routine execution, a movie which 
could have been a superior comedy but instead will likely fade quickly 
from the collective memory. The few moments which are borne of genuine 
inspiration simply serve as reminders of what could have been, with just a 
little extra work.
Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson) is a chauvinistic ad executive, a man who sees 
the opposite sex purely in terms of sexual conquests and menial servitude. 
To his horror, Nick is passed over for a promotion in favour of a woman: 
Darcy McGuire (Helen Hunt), who has been brought in to help the company 
capture accounts for female-oriented products, a highly profitable sector. 
Then, one night, a drunk Nick accidentally electrocutes himself in his 
bathtub. Instead of dying, however, he awakens the next morning to 
discover that he can hear women's thoughts.
Nick is first horrified by his newfound ability, but gradually comes to 
appreciate the possibilities it offers. Nick begins using his power to 
poach ad ideas from Darcy's mind so he can pass them off as his own, in an 
effort to reinforce his position as the agency's number one designer. At 
the same time, though, Nick finds himself falling in love with Darcy, 
forcing him to make a pivotal choice between his emotions and his career.
All of this starts out well enough, Nick's initial glimpses into women's 
minds often proving hilarious. Particularly good is Nick's gradual 
discovery of just how overinflated is his understanding of how the women 
in his life perceive him. In one terrific scene, Nick walks through his 
office, being mentally whipped by his coworkers left and right -- and when 
he finally encounters his two most trusted office lackeys (Delta Burke and 
Valerie Perrine), he discovers that they don't think anything at all.
But things begin to slide downhill from there. Apart from the main Darcy 
McGuire storyline, the movie also introduces a number of other subplots, 
most of which simply seem to exist to kill time. One, in which delinquent 
dad Nick tries to make up for lost time with his daughter (Ashley 
Johnson), is amusing if rather predictable. Another, about a suicidal 
office clerk (Judy Greer) is shameless in its execution -- it's clearly 
present just to show us how much Nick's behaviour toward women improves as 
he makes use of his mindreading ability. It's the type of story element 
which reappears as needed, and is otherwise ignored completely.
But most frustrating are the sequences featuring Marisa Tomei as Lola, a 
coffee shop worker infatuated with Nick. After it claims considerable 
screentime in the movie's first half, it appears that screenwriters Josh 
Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa (working from a story they developed with Diane 
Drake) simply ran out of ideas for the Nick/Lola romance. Moreover, its 
development seems to run counter to the burgeoning Nick/Darcy romance. As 
a result, Lola is summarily dumped from the film, exiting in an abrupt 
scene which strains at the bounds of disbelief.
And this is all the more disappointing because Gibson and Tomei 
demonstrate far more on-screen chemistry than Gibson and Hunt. One of the 
movie's most serious flaws is that it never successfully make the case 
that Nick and Darcy are meant to be together; their relationship is never 
more than an artifice of the script. Indeed, the movie offers far more 
persuasive arguments for them to be adversaries instead of friends (let 
alone lovers). The interaction between Nick and Lola, on the other hand, 
is far more charming. I found myself longing for Tomei's return during the 
interminable Gibson/Hunt scenes which take up much of the film's second 
half.
That said, both principals do good work here, even if their pairing is 
less than successful. In particular, Gibson, who has always shown a knack 
for comedy even in his more action-oriented pictures, is clearly having a 
lot of fun. His misogyny at the start of the film is deliciously 
politically incorrect, and his reactions to the thoughts of the women 
around him are nicely portrayed. For instance, a scene in which Nick 
learns that his lovemaking technique has nowhere near the effect he 
believed is hilarious -- topped only by the way he then compensates for 
his deficiencies.
Much like the script, the direction from Nancy Meyers is a mostly routine 
contribution dotted with more impressive moments. In one nice shot of Nick 
and Darcy kissing, Meyers uses a close-up so extreme that Gibson and Hunt 
-- their profiles in shadow against the dimly-lit set -- seem to consume 
the screen. We are enveloped in their embrace. But Meyers also drops the 
ball more than once, particularly with an inexplicable scene toward the 
end of the movie which wraps up the matter of Nick's mind-reading ability. 
Meyers also does a poor job of maintaining the pace of the film, and the
result is a picture which feels very long at two hours and eight minutes.
As for the promise of insight into the feminine psyche offered by the 
title, it is sadly not to be. "What Women Want" really doesn't say 
anything more about the desires of the fairer sex than any one of a 
hundred other romantic comedies. Of course, based on the box office take 
of this film (well over US$100 million as of this writing) and reported 
statistics of the female percentage of the audience (about 60%), part of 
the answer to the question of what they want may be "movies like this 
one". If that's the case, then this is further evidence that I don't 
really understand women. But, like most guys, I already knew that.

 What Women Want is a retro romantic-comedy in which Mel Gibson acquires
the ability to hear womenís thoughts, thus knowing what women want.
 This is a film that, if made during the 1940s or ë50s would have
starred Cary Grant or in the 1960s would have been a vehicle for Rock
Hudson.
 Gibson stars as Nick Marshall, a hot-shot advertising director, who
during the filmís opening is described as a ěmanís man.î He refers to
women as broads and chicks, and calls them ěbabe.î
 Born and raised in Las Vegas by his showgirl mother, Nick is charming
and irrepressible as well as a chauvinist. He loves listening to Frank
Sinatra, ogling women and flirting outrageously.
 But all that begins to change after two life-changing events:
 First, Nick loses out on a promotion to creative director at his ad
agency to Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt). Secondly, he receives a major
electrical shock that gives him the ability to hear womenís inner-most
thoughts.
 What Women Want is an enchanting outing, that displays Gibson at his
rakish best. As Nick, he is attractive, seductive and irresistible.
 One memorable sequence features Gibsonís Nick dancing around his
apartment while Sinatraís "Wonít Dance (You Canít Make Me) plays on his
stereo.
 Nick decides to use his new-found ability to undermine Darcy so he can
get the job he believes he deserves. (His boss ó played by Alan Alda ó
told him he did not get the job because he knew nothing about what women
want.)
 The movie has an old-fashioned feel to it. The Gibson-Hunt relationship
is reminiscent of the Spencer Tracy-Katherine Hepburn movies of the ë40s
and ë50s.
 Of course, it doesnít take a genius to figure out the path What Women
Want follows.
 Nick, eavesdropping on the thoughts of thousands of women, not only
learns what women want, but discovers how many actually feel about him.
He discovers he is not the smooth operator he believes he is.
 In a sense Gibsonís Nick trods the same path as Dustin Hoffmanís
Michael in Tootsie. Both learn to be better men by tapping into the
feminine world: Nick by listening to their thoughts, Michael by
masquerading as a woman to land a soap opera role.
 Gibson is suave as well as funny as Nick. His big baby blues light up
when he realizes the power his newfound ability gives him.
 Hunt is beautiful and effervescent as Darcy, who covers up her own
misgivings and doubts about her ability to handle her new job with
bravado. She is a no-nonsense type of woman, yet she also is warm and
vulnerable. Plus Hunt looks dazzling.
 The scenes between Gibson and Hunt seem natural and unforced. They do
create a screen chemistry.
 Unfortunately, What Women Want is about 20 minutes too long. The movie
sort of dies toward the finale. It appears as if screenwriters Josh
Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa, working from a story by Diane Drake, could
not devise a satisfactory ending. The movie slowly winds down like an
old watch. The film doesnít really end, it seems to just stop.
 And a subplot involving a young office worker at the agency who may be
suicidal seems unnecessary.
 What Women Want will be a great date movie. Women, especially, will
relish it, and many men may walk out of the theater with bruised ribs
from being poked by their better halves.

   In this appealing romantic comedy, Mel Gibson stars as the
ultimate man's man, an arrogant chauvinist ad executive who hasn't a
clue what women are about. Just ask his ex-wife (Lauren Holly) and 15
year-old daughter (Ashley Johnson). So when his boss (Alan Alda)
chooses a woman (Helen Hunt) as the agency's new Creative Director, a
job he thought he had in his hip pocket, he's chagrined, particularly
when she gives everyone a pink box full of feminine products,
assigning them to come up with ideas. That night, after a hilarious
scene in which he's waxing his legs, wriggling into pantyhose, and
trying on a Wonderbra, he's almost electrocuted - but the shock opens
up a new world. Suddenly, inexplicably, he can hear what women are
thinking - and often what they're musing is what a jerk he
is. Thoroughly rattled, he consults a therapist (Bette Midler), who
says when Freud died, he still wondered "What do women want?" "If you
know the answer, you can rule!" she tells him. Soon he does, coming up
with clever ideas, stolen from Helen Hunt's mind, astounding everyone
about how sensitive and perceptive he's become. And so it goes. Mel
Gibson is sensational: captivating when he's dancing to Sinatra's
music and charming when he's poking fun at his own manly
image. Director/producer Nancy Meyers with writers Josh Goldsmith,
Cathy Yuspa and Diane Drake have revived the battle-of-the-sexes
genre, perfected by Spencer Tracy & Katharine Hepburn - only Gibson's
more like Cary Grant. The ensemble acting is terrific and the
father/daughter relationship scores. Only the ending drags a bit. On
the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "What Women Want" is a smart,
sassy, sexy 9. Don't miss this funny, funny mind game - it scores!

Mel Gibson stars in his first romcom in 10 years as Nick Marshall, a rich 
sexist ad exec who suddenly gains the ability to hear women's thoughts after 
being electrocuted. With the sudden comic book-like superpower he realizes 
what women really think of him, what appeals to women and how to woo his new 
co-worker Darcy (Helen Hunt). There's also a sub-plot of Nick trying to 
relate to his teenage daughter as well as another romantic encounter he has 
with the woman at the coffee shop he sees every day. 
Gibson gives a very good performance showing he's a talented actor, not just 
a pretty face. The screenplay includes a lot of very funny jokes exploiting 
the character's magical ability to hear what women are thinking - combining 
trendy pop culture references with the standard one-liners and zany 
pratfalls. The plotline involving Gibson's wooing of Hunt is pretty 
convincing and the two have good chemistry making this one of the few romcoms 
that actually work. 
Although the main storyline is concise and the jokes work the screenplay is 
far too elaborate for an otherwise elementary Hollywood movie. The subplots 
about Nick trying to get along with his daughter and the girl at his work 
who's secretly suicidal aren't handled nearly as tactful as they should have 
been. The ending has not one, not two, but THREE climaxes all involving Nick 
"saving" a woman in one way or another. 
The comedy is certainly winning but the film takes its plot a little too 
seriously. This film could have been the biggest accomplishment for feminism 
in years if it had ended any other way. Not only is it a totally lame cop-out 
as far as filmmaking goes but it sells short the theme that men should listen 
to them, be sensitive, be self-sufficient and not be so... you know... manly. 
. Apparently women aren't as liberated as we think, they still need men to 
come to their rescue.
