UP AT THE VILLA (director: Philip Haas; screenwriter: Belinda Haas/based
on the novella by W. Somerset Maugham; cinematographer: Maurizio
Calvesi; editor: Belinda Haas; cast: Kristin Scott Thomas (Mary Panton),
Sean Penn (Rowley Flint), Anne Bancroft (Princess San Ferdinando), James
Fox (Sir Edgar Swift), Jeremy Davies (Karl Richter), Derek Jacobi
(Lucky  Leadbetter), Massimo Ghini (Beppino Leopardi), 2000-UK)
Based on a minor novella by W. Somerset Maugham, this bourgeois story is
about some British and American expatriates living in Florence, Italy,
in 1938, right before World War II started. The main focus is on a young
British widow in her thirties, who lives in a fantastic villa. It is
stiffly directed by Philip Haas (Angels and Insects/The Music of
Chance), whose wife Belinda wrote the screenplay and was the film's
editor.
The film is mainly about how the prim English widow comes to grips with
what love means to her. But, she is painted into such a silly corner in
the romance, that the film never had a chance to do anything but pant
heavily for close to two hours.
These expatriates, seekers of the good life, find themselves peeved at
Fascism, that it has become a mild inconvenience to their lifestyles,
which hardly makes one sympathetic to their plight when Fascism is right
on their gold-plated doorsteps and the party leader, Beppino Leopardi
(Ghini), is invited to their elite parties.
Mary Panton (Kristin Scott Thomas) has been struck a severe blow in life
because of a failed first-marriage, where she married for love and then
watched as her husband became a drunk, a wife-beater and squandered her
inheritance. She is now forced to accept favors from her society
friends, the idle rich sycophants who are lolling around at cocktail
parties and at tennis courts. She has the social connections, but is
short on the bread, which makes her feel very uncomfortable.
In the next few days, Mary will have to make a big decision, as the much
older Sir Edgar Swift (James Fox) asks her to marry him and will return
from Rome in two days to hear her answer. He is a longtime acquaintance,
knowing her ever since she was a child, but he is someone she is not in
love with. He is a wealthy, proper gentleman, who could offer her a
secure and comfortable life, something that she is very tempted by. Her
mentor and benefactor, the snobbish Princess San Ferdinando (Anne
Bancroft), offers her advice: Forget love and marry for money.
At Anne Bancroft's gathering for her society friends, the nattily
dressed Rowley Flint (Sean Penn), an American with a terrible reputation
as a shopgirl womanizer and someone of amoral character, is seated next
to Mary and asked by Anne Bancroft to drive her home, as Florence is
starting to become a dangerous place at night because of the vagrants.
On the drive home, Flint makes a pass at Mary, tries talking her out of
marrying Sir Edgar, and gets slapped as he puts a move on her. She takes
the car and hightails it out of there. But on the darkened road, she
nearly runs over the depressed Austrian violin player (Jeremy Davies),
who played at the restaurant party she was at that evening, where
despite his terrible violin playing, she gave him a big tip. Feeling
sorry for the nervous and disheveled bloke, she takes him back to her
estate to show him the paintings on the wall, feed him, and give him the
best screw he ever got in his life. This is a token of her patrician
generosity, as she figures, this guy's a refugee running away from the
Nazis, I might as well give him something wonderful to remember for the
rest of his life, so if he goes back to the concentration camp he, at
least, will have some pleasant memories. The problem with this
melodramatic scene, was that the acting was shrill and the outcome was
hardly convincing.
The next night the violin player who was supposed to leave Florence,
instead, decides to stay and have another romp with Mary. But she tells
him no dice. Unfortunately,
the violin player has a death wish and grabs the gun Sir Edgar gave her
for protection and shoots himself in her bedroom. This is a very
inconvenient place for him to die, so she enlists the help of Flint to
dispose of his body and cover their trail. She mentions to Flint that
she slept with the violin player because "My heart was full of
tenderness and pity."
To inject some comedy into this dull film, Derek Jacobi has a small part
as a drag queen, offering Mary his support. While Anne Bancroft
shamelessly culls laughs for her performance as a gossip-mongering
high-class slut, who has a contemptable attitude toward people. Both
performers chew the scenery.
I found this stiff upper lip film to be ridiculous; the acting and
directing robotic. The film lacked tension, it was not erotic, and the
story went out of its way not to make sense. That Mary has to choose
between marrying the next governor of Bengal, in India, someone who will
never desert her, Sir Edgar, or Flint, a playboy who will most likely
grow tired of her and discard her for another, hardly seemed to matter.
They all seemed to deserve each other. The only thing about this movie
that pleased me, was how it couldn't ruin the splendor of the beautiful
Florence countryside and its splendidly graceful edifices, as Florence
is lushly photographed in all its magnificence.

   If you were a good-looking, sophisticated, but not highly
schooled woman of about thirty-five, recently widowed and
more or less broke, what would you do if you had these
options?  Alternative one: accept a proposal of marriage to a
rich, successful, stable man of about 60 who has been
appointed to a highly prestigious post in an exotic foreign
land and who you feel will never desert you.  Choice two:
Live dangerously and hang out with a handsome, dashing,
witty playboy of about your own age, who is married only in
name to a woman he will probably never see again.  He
promises nothing permanent: just fun, romance, and thrills
during whatever time you are together with him.
   You say choice two?  Is there a possibility that your
selection is informed by the fact that now, especially in a
booming economy, you can always support yourself and need
not depend on a man?  Absolutely.  You've made the right
choice.  Let's add something to the inquiry.  The year is
1938.  You're as good looking as you are now.  You are an
English woman recently widowed to a man whom you loved
but who turned out a drunkard, lost all his money, and was
killed in an auto accident.  But here's the kicker.  Women did
not by any stretch have the job opportunities that could be
found in America and indeed the West nowadays.  If you had
limited education, even nursing and teaching might be closed
to you.  You still say choice two?  Perhaps you'd have to be
in the situation to appreciate the desperation a woman in that
situation could feel.
   Mary Panton (Kristin Scott Thomas) was just such a person
in W. Somerset Maugham's novella "Up at the Villa," which
has been given a sumptuous treatment on the screen by Phil
Haas.  Haas is a flawless choice for a period piece of this
nature, having helmed the exquisite "Angels and Insects"
(also featuring Kristin Scott Thomas--in a story set in
Victorian England about a man who studies the insect world)
and "The Music of Chance," which featured James Spader as
a man involved in a high-stakes poker game with two
eccentric millionaires.  For his part, the late Somerset
Maugham has been no stranger to screen adaptations of his
own works, including "Of Human Bondage" (on every high
school reading list to the dismay of teens) and "The Moon
and Sixpence," the filmed version of an episode in the life of
Paul Gauguin which starred George Sanders.
   What gives "Up at the Villa" a quality above that of the
recent screen version of Graham Greene's "The End of the
Affair" is the credibility of the central character, Mary Panton.
Panton operates in no way by the mystical mandates of
Sarah Miles but is tormented by a confluence of pressures at
a crucial point in her life.  Living like Tennessee
Williams's Blanche Dubois on the kindness of strangers, Mary
shares an Italian villa in Florence at the invitation of her
long-term, wealthy friend Princess San Ferdinando, where
she indulges in the dolce vita of an expatriate community
composed of most aging British and American citizens.  She
has just received a proposal from Sir Edgar Swift (James
Fox), recently appointed governor of the Indian state of
Bengal, and a man with whom she can share a stable,
although loveless life.  At a lavish dinner presided over by the
princess, she meets an American playboy, Rowley Flint
(Sean Penn), who unsuccessfully attempts to seduce her and
is told in no uncertain terms by Mary that she does not
consider love and romance an important consideration at her
stage in life.  =
   Torn by advice on the one hand by her friend, the princess,
to be practical and go with the money, and provoked on the
other hand by the dashing Rowley Flint, the conflicted Mary's
life is turned around by a chance meeting with a poor refugee
from Nazi-occupied Austria, Karl Richter (Jeremy Davies).
Richter (performed graciously by Davies) has misinterpreted
her gesture of kindness and pity toward him, thereby meeting
with a tragic fate that would alter Mary's outlook forever.
   This straightforward, well-made tale, filled with
cinematographer Maurizio Calvesi's close-ups--which provide
a veritable atlas of emotions from the classy, photogenic face
of Kristin Scott Thomas--is played against a backdrop of
emerging clouds of war.  Mussolini's fascists are in control of
Italy and already in 1938 ominous commands issue from the
office of the local high official, the smooth and educated
Beppino Leopardi (Massimo Ghini), which are to impact the
entire Anglo-American expatriate community in Florence. =
Anne Bancroft shines in the broadly comic role of the
mistress of the villa, who at one point describes her dead
husband as bearing "a face so ugly that he scared even the
horses" and Derek Jacobi as the foppish Lucky Leadbetter
who considers himself lucky indeed if he can wangle an
invitation once a year to one of the princess's lavish
champagne parties.
   What a pleasure to take in an adult movie inhabited by
first-rate performers who convincingly play out a time that =
of their lives would be altered by extremist governments and
a disastrous war!  If you enjoyed Franco Zeffirelli's 1999
saucy "Tea with Mussolini," about a group of eccentric British
women, the Scorpioni, in 1930s Florence and the impact of
their livelier and more vulgar American counterparts in the
expatriate community, you can't go wrong with "Up at the
Villa," which is more focussed and appropriately charged with
just the right degree of unpredictable melodrama.

  If you weren't besotted by the beauty of Italy in "The
Talented Mr. Ripley," this screen adaptation of a novella by
W. Somerset Maugham should send you directly to your travel agent for
tickets to Tuscany. The story, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its
glorious setting. Set in the 1940s, lovely Kristin Scott Thomas is an
impoverished British widow who has a weekend to decide whether to
accept the marriage proposal of a wealthy but stuffy suitor, played by
James Fox, the recently appointed Governor of Bengal in colonial
India, or the amorous advances of a rakish, married American
adventurer - that's Sean Penn. So, instead of making any commitment,
she indulges in a duplicitous night of passion with an Austrian
refugee, Jeremy Davies, who worships her. She thinks it's a flighty
one-night stand but Davies has other ideas, which result in a
confrontation at gunpoint. So much for the pulp melodrama plot. The
most pleasurable moments come from Anne Bancroft and Derek Jacobi,
Anglo-American expatriates who amuse and entertain Florentine society.
Philip Haas ("Angels & Insects," "The Music of Chance") directs from a
screenplay by his wife, Belinda Haas, who is partial to having actors
exclaim, "by Jove!"  Very little is mentioned about the rise of
fascism and the horrors of Mussolini's regime except to acknowledge
its inconvenient intrusion into the leisurely pleasures of Florentine
life.  Pino Donaggio's swelling, soggy score is best described as
"elevator music," but Maurizio Calvesi's cinematography is
sumptuous. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Up at the Villa" is
a glossy but dull 4 - basically, it's Masterpiece Theater at the
movies.  Better choice: rent the video of "Tea With Mussolini."

countries of origin USA/UK; aspect ratio 1.85:1

It was Akira Kurosawa, I think, or perhaps Luis Buńuel, who said that movies 
which tell us everything often have nothing to say. It was one of the great 
directors, anyway, and those guys know what they're talking about. "Up at the 
Villa" feels like it was made to prove the point. If you removed every bit of 
its dialogue that strains to make sure we understand obvious details, the 
film would be half as long. That would be great for the authors, because 
they'd have plenty of free space in which to insert a comprehensible story.
Kristin Scott Thomas stars as Mary Panton, a young English widow staying in 
Florence at the advent of Word War Two. She receives a marriage proposal from 
Sir Edgar Smith (James Fox), a man she does not love, but who could provide 
her with security. This point is emphasised by an American society lady, 
Princess San Fernando (Anne Bancroft), who informs her guests "He has his 
qualities..." while rubbing her fingers together to make clear she's alluding 
to his money.
Of course, EVERY minor point is emphasised in "Up at the Villa". "Surely he 
didn't come all the way here just to dance with you," Princess asks Mary, 
while needlessly adding "He must be wanting to marry you!" We understand what 
the characters are talking about, but the screenplay keeps providing them 
with unnecessary clarifications. My reviews have featured a lot of quotations 
as of late, because sometimes that's the best way to illustrate what a film 
is like. It's absolutely essential here; the dialogue is the key point, 
drawing attention to itself by insulting our intelligence and cluttering 
things up.
There is a love interest for Mary in the movie, a playboy named Roley Flint 
(Sean Penn). He too gets some awkward lines, the most memorable of which are 
spoken at a dinner party. The topic of conversation is electricity shortages. 
"It's because of the munitions factories," says Roley. "They're using up all 
the power." So far, so good. But then: "They're preparing for war. The 
situation in Europe is getting really tense right now. Opposing countries are 
getting ready for armed conflict, and preparing arsenals of weapons."
As the film goes on, Mary finds she needs to turn to Roley for help: After 
she breaks the heart of a young Austrian refugee (Jeremy Davies), the boy 
shoots himself in her bedroom, and Roley is needed to help get rid of the 
corpse. This part of the plot becomes the middle section of the film; it's 
intended, I suppose, to show Mary and Roley getting to know each other. But 
it sidetracks the drama by bogging it down in thriller elements -- the 
characters are closely observed, all right, but as conspirators rather than 
potential lovers. The emotions of the film get confused and lost, and by the 
finale I wasn't sure what had happened. Mary ends up with neither Edgar nor 
Roley, but is this intended as a sad or happy ending, and what made her come 
to her decision?
"Up at the Villa" was written, directed and edited by the husband and wife 
team of Philip and Belinda Haas, who adapted the novella by W. Somerset 
Maugham. It's tempting to say that two people with an intimate psychological 
connection shouldn't work on a film together without some other significant 
creative influence, because they run the risk of making it so personal that 
other people won't understand it. But that's just not true -- think of the 
wonderful movies made by such auteurs as the Coen, Hughes and Marx brothers. 
This is a bland and aimless film. I don't know why and I don't much care.

You know how every now and then, a film comes out that just blows the roof
of the entire movie industry? I'm talking a film that not only challenges
your mind, but one that completely sweeps you into a world that you'd never
even thought about before? Sparks of originality, chemistry all around! Sure
you do, and so do I, which is why I could say in full confidence that this
film is anything but that kind of a movie.
PLOT:
A rich, snooty woman living the "good life" in Florence, Italy, during the
late 1930s, suddenly finds herself caught up in a messy love triangle
involving a wealthy, older gentleman, a younger, more abrasive American, and
an Austrian refugee. When a murder takes place, the politics of the day take
over, and the film switches its romance gears into those featuring intrigue.
CRITIQUE:
This film is full of pretty pictures, nice decorations and beautiful
scenery, but lacks any palpable romance, tension or chemistry. It's just
sort of "there". It's a film which never really bored me at any point, it
was like being a voyeur at a rich guy's party, but never really managed to
get me excited about anything either. Sean Penn, who has always been one of
favorite actors, despite continually bashing the craft that consistently
feeds him, is actually pretty so-so in this film, underplaying the part and
appearing strangely out of place. Of course, Kirsten Scott Thomas invented
these movies, so she certainly fit her role like a glove, but unfortunately
her character, who is the lead in the film, doesn't really provide the
audience with any tangible reasons to like her. I mean, she's obviously very
pretty but am I supposed to feel for a lady that dicks around with every
Tom, Dick and Arnold, while making decisions on her life based primarily
around finances? Sure, the film offers some insight as to the deep-rooted
misappropriations of values which these people apparently subscribed to at
the time, but I could only invest so much of myself into folks with  whom I
obviously have zero in common (besides the fact that every guy seemed to
want to dick Kirsten Scott Thomas). The romance level is also pretty thin in
this film, with only a tiny shred of it showing up between Penn and Thomas,
a little more in Thomas' relationship with Davies, but generally
non-existent.
Of course, the film turns into more of a "political" game during its second
half, but none of that really interested me much either. No real tension,
just a little politics here and there, nothing we haven't seen before. And
when is Jeremy Davies finally going to play a character different from every
single one that he portrays in all of his other movies? Dude, it's pretty
obvious that you could play the "shy, nervous, twitchy guy", but how about
taking a shot at a role with a little more range? The ending of the movie is
also pretty weak and foreseeable, with much of what goes on, predictable and
tidy. Having said all that, I did enjoy looking at this film, the scenery,
the actors and the wonderful city of Florence, which were all quite
spectacular. I also loved Anne Bancroft's performance, which let her chew up
and spit out most of the scenery around her. Great job, Mrs. Brooks! As well
as Derek Jacobi's comical turn as Lucky Leadbetter. And yes, Scott Thomas
does deliver a decent showing, but somehow it all seems to be a little "old
hat" with her. This film might ultimately entertain those content enough to
sit and watch some really pretty and pretentious people prance around in
lush surroundings with little more than a simple story to tell. But on the
whole, the film didn't manage to entertain me enough to recommend it to any
of my friends. And yes, dear reader...I consider you my friend (fluttering
eyelashes) :)
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Anne Bancroft's birth name is Anna Maria Louisa Italiano (do you think she's
Italian?). She was born in The Bronx, New York in 1931, and has been married
to writer/actor/director Mel Brooks since 1964.
Kirsten Scott Thomas' younger sister Serena Scott Thomas, had a role in the
latest James Bond flick, THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH (7/10), in which she played
Dr. Molly Warmflash. Director Philip Haas also directed Kirsten in the 1995
movie ANGELS AND INSECTS.
Jeremy Davies' birth name was Jeremy Boring.
Actor Derek Jacobi was the mentor and acting instructor of fellow British
actor Kenneth Branagh. He also won a Tony in 1985 for "Much Ado About
Nothing", a play which friend Branagh turned into a movie in 1993. Also, Mr.
Jacobi was apparently one of the few runners-up for the part of Hannibal
Lecter in the original SILENCE OF THE LAMBS movie. Of course, that part
eventually went to fellow Brit Anthony Hopkins.
Director Philip Haas and screenwriter Belinda Haas are indeed husband and
wife.

     Hey, who hasn't been clamoring for a Kristin Scott Thomas-Sean Penn
romantic drama?  At long last, Up at the Villa is the answer to all
those unspoken dreams.
     Up at the Villa reunites the director of Angels and Insects, Philip
Haas, with Thomas, his former star.  And true to most re-pairings, the
film feels oddly familiar -- as if we've seen Thomas doing this before:
In pre-WWII Italy, a high-society (though penniless, natch) widow named
Mary (Thomas) is being wooed by an older man of some wealth (James
Fox).  He proposes, then promptly jaunts off for a few days so she can
consider.
     Naturally, the world opens up to Mary as she deliberates, and she
soon finds romance in the arms of an Austrian refugee (Jeremy Davies),
which culminates in a lone night of wild monkey love (in an era where
lone nights of wild monkey love are frowned upon).  Mary finds herself
in a jam when the refugee gets a little clingy, and Sean Penn's roguish
Rowley has to come in to help her out.
     All the while, Mary faces the budding turmoil of pre-war Europe and
the shenanigans of her friend Princess (Anne Bancroft, truly living up
to her character's name)... and you are somehow supposed to care about
all of this.
     Up at the Villa's prime flaw is that Mary is hardly a sympathetic
creature.  Her beauty is espoused by all when she actually looks quite
plain.  Her kindness is talked about when she's actually quite
duplicitous.  She throws her affections around on a whim.  Hardly a role
model.
     That said, Penn is lots of fun as Rowley, but he actually has far
less screen time than one would think.  And Bancroft is entertaining in
that Great Expectations sort of way.
     Acting is one thing, but ultimately, Up at the Villa falls flat
because the "intrigue" of this little drama is sorely lacking.  The
Nazis are coming and the best villain we get is a corrupt policeman?  Il
Duce would have been sorely disappointed.  The cover-up that comprises
the latter half of the movie feels treadworn, at best, pedestrian, at
worst.  Pokemon has more thrills.
     Lastly, the romance is neither very believable nor very torrid.
Penn and Thomas have absolutely no chemistry.  For that matter, neither
do any of Thomas's other romantic entanglements in the film.  In other
words: This is not The English Patient.  It's more of a cadaver.

UP AT THE VILLA (2000) ** Directed by Philip Haas. Edited by and 
written by Belinda Haas, based on the novella by W. Somerset Maugham. 
Photography, Maurizio Calvesi. Production design, Paul Brown. Music,

(Sir Edgar Swift), Jeremy Davies (Karl Richter), Derek Jacobi (Lucky 
Leadbetter), Massimo Ghini (Beppino Leopardi). Produced by Geoff

115 minutes. PG-13 (sex)
Playwright, novelist, short story writer W. Somerset Maugham 
(1874-1965) was in his lifetime as known and as read an 
English-language author as anyone, especially for his short stories. 
Crisp, unfussy writing, a cosmopolitan life,  and sharp observation 
led to a host of movie adaptations --over 50 -- from "Rain" (made 
four times) to "The Razor's Edge" (made twice) to autobiographical 
spy thrillers, to international manners and/or intrigue, to the 
British at home or abroad.
"Abroad", for affluent Americans and for Brits who could afford it, 
more often than not meant "Italy." In 1940 Maugham published the 
novella which this film adapts. That was  during the first year of 
World War II which began in September 1939. The story tells mostly of 
British expatriates in Italy, with a light seasoning of Americans. 
Its background included the Fascist Mussolini regimes. but this 
aspect was attenuated. It is underlined and expanded in the movie 
version which starts after September 1938, that is, after the 
infamous Munich agreements were signed by Hitler, Mussolini, British 
Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and French PM Edouard Daladier.
There's no more blind a person that the one who does not want to see, 
goes a saying. The depicted English in Italy were among those who, 
whether because of delusion, inertia or stupidity did no return home 
to the British Isles, but instead took Chamberlain's foolish "Peace 
in our time" at face value.
The movie's little colony in and around Florence (where the film was 
shot, as well as partly in Siena), go through their small, effete, 
even stultifying social life.
The picture's center is Mary Panton, about 40. A widow with no 
palpable funds, she is staying at a villa loaned her by friends. Her 
confidente (in some ways) is the colorful, cynical, flamboyant 
doyenne (in rank and fortune) of the colony, also a widow, the 
English Principessa San Ferdinando, played with the gusto that Anne 
Bancroft can command so effortlessly. I am not sure whether the 
Princess is a Brit or an American. Her accent sounds like stage 
English, reinforced by her repeated addressing Mary as "duckey."
The other Brits are by and large pallid, dull types, with the 
exception is Lucky Leadbetter, a gay and indigent artist (Derek 
Jacobi) who is also queenishly flamboyant, but merely on the fringes 
of the local high society. His presence is really not needed in the 
story. It is something of a conundrum. I read Maugham's novella ages 
ago, could not find a copy in a hurry, so that I don't know whether 
this character was in the source text or was added in the script
At one of the regular, society dinners, American newcomer Rowley 
Flint meets Mary. He is a playboy whose wife is not around. It looks 
as if that all spouses,whether dead or alive, were or are negative 
entities. Flint immediately starts his seduction number on Mrs. 
Panton. But, though attracted to him, she is hesitant. Having been 
left fortune-less, she is considering a match with Sir Edward Swift, 
a civil servant who is 25 years older than she, properly proper --in 
fact almost comically so,-- in love with Mary, an old friend forever, 
and a candidate for Governor of Bengal. (It was unclear to me whether 
he is a widower or an old bachelor).
He proposes. She needs a few days to think it over. He leaves for a 
short time -- during which Mary a) rebuffs Flint's advances and b) 
meets again by chance Karl Richter, a young (and overly grungy, 
unkempt and gauche) refugee from Austria. Frustratingly, we never 
learn why he is a refugee? Is he anti-Nazi? Is he a Jew? Why has he 
not a Teutonic accent, even a mild one?
Mary, for reasons unclear and somewhat improbable --libido? pity? a 
passing fancy? -- has sex with the awkward youth in "her" bedroom at 
the beautiful villa. The next day madly amorous Karl shows up, is 
politely informed by Mary that "basta is basta," and it was only a 
one-night stand. His reaction is as unforeseen as it is radical.
Major things happen which now throw Mary into the company of Rowley 
Flint who helps her and.....
This film is heavy on accents and dialogues. The clearest English 
accent belong to Italian performer Massimo Ghini who plays the local 
political top dog, as Secretary of Florence's Fascist Party. He too 
desires Mary, which complicates matters.
The movie loves local Italian color, meaning interiors, architecture 
and nature. It also loves to talk. There is much stress on lovingly 
elaborated Tuscan details--which please the eye but slow down the 
action.
No true three-dimensional characters rise up. The improbable casting 
of Bad Boy Penn as a man of the world, a classy womanizer, is hard to 
swallow,both in part and in whole. If you reflect on the fact that 
Penn's was once married to Madonna, his sophistication becomes even 
less likely.  The electricity between him and Scott Thomas is about 
like that of two AAA batteries.
Ms. Scott Thomas is not particularly appealing in any sense of the 
word. What a pity! After the full or part failure of her last two 
films ("Random Hearts" and "The Horse Whisperer") she deserved a 
better role. She is a very special case. Her filmography is far 
larger than most viewers suspect, but it is also obscure, in that the 
majority of her films (mostly European) have not been released in the 
USA. I first saw her in the Rumanian "An Unforgettable Summer" (1994, 
by Lucian Pintillie), a gem where she gives a four-star performance. 
Get it if you can. Or else the interesting "Angels and Insects"

A 1940s-style melodrama but WITH COLOR.
UP AT THE VILLA, based on a Somerset Maugham novella, is set in a
remarkably benign Fascist Italy on the brink of World War II.  The movie
unfolds like a dream with model-quality characters slowly drifting
through the sumptuous sets.  As directed by Philip Haas and scripted and
edited by his wife Belinda, who worked together on ANGELS AND INSECTS,
the movie induces an almost trance-like state in the audience.
Containing a small drama wrapped in a light-weight romance, the story
moves on gossamer wings, never boring and yet never quite compelling.  A
lovely, moving tableaux, it's almost sad the way the picture never quite
obtains lift-off.
A regal and radiant Kristin Scott Thomas (RANDOM HEARTS) and a dashing
and handsome Sean Penn (SWEET AND LOWDOWN) play lovers with some
similarities to the parts that they played in their last pictures.  As
Mary Panton, Scott Thomas is a poor widow who lives an expensive
lifestyle due to the generosity of her friends.  After being foolish
enough to love her last husband, who drank himself to death while
squandering their money, she has resolved not to make that mistake
again.
Soon after the story opens, an older but wealthy man, Sir Edgar Swift
(James Fox), proposes marriage to Mary.  She doesn't love him, which she
views as an attribute since that guarantees that he can't break her
heart.
Mary's friend, known as the Princess (Anne Bancroft), advises her to
marry but take lovers as she has.  The Princess says that her husband is
"ugly enough to frighten the horses," but that's not a problem since he
has given her wealth and freedom.
Of course, as was mandatory in the old 1940s melodramas, some cad has to
show up to complicate the situation.  Sean Penn plays reputed scoundrel
Rowley Flint, a married man with an unsavory reputation.  The biggest
problem with the screenplay is that it makes Rowley into a lovable
pussycat.  Possibly the sweetest character in the film, save Mary,
Rowley acts with the sincerity of a saint even if he is described as
"wild and reckless."
Scott Thomas and Penn do everything asked of them, but it just isn't
quite enough to make this quaint little story into much of a movie.
Still, if you're in need of some tranquility and rest, you could do
worse than park your weary bones in a theater that's playing UP AT THE
VILLA.  And, if you do nod off every now and then, not to worry -- you
won't miss anything important.  You'll leave the theater feeling rested
and peaceful, not something that can be said about the effect of most
movies.
UP AT THE VILLA runs a bit long at 1:55.  It is rated PG-13 for some
sexuality and violence and would be acceptable for those 11 and up.
There is, however, little to hold the interest of most kids.

"Up at the Villa" is a strange movie experience, possibly because such a polite film of manners and delicacy switches gears and becomes something other than what you might expect. It has the grandly theatrical look and feel of 1999's "An Ideal Husband" but it develops into something akin to an Agatha Christie mystery.
Kristin Scott Thomas stars as the widowed, highly composed Mary Panton who locks herself inside a beautiful villa, often contemplating her lack of passion while sitting out in her garden (my, my, how great it must be to rich). Mary is unsure of whether she should accept a marriage proposal from a courtly diplomat (James Fox) but she has to have an answer soon since he is going on a trip (and gives her a gun to protect herself from the roaming refugees on the streets). She leans more towards a married, debonair American (Sean Penn), though she resists him at first due to his honesty. Then there is the pity she feels towards a young, poor Austrian violinist (Jeremy Davies) who is also a refugee. One thing leads to another and when she tries to resist the young, passionate fellow, things get rather awry. 
This is where the big switch in tone and style comes in, and "Up at the Villa" becomes more of a moral tale where immorality takes the day. Yes, immoral, considering the choices Mary makes when confronted with danger. A film like this would not have existed during the Production Code days where protagonists had to be punished for their crimes. Mary and the American get involved in a crime that evolves into a highly political situation - even the Italian police are corrupt. 
The performances deliver for the most part, all very classy acts to be sure. Kristin Scott Thomas has a difficult role, exuding sensuousness, duplicity and beauty all in one package, often at the most inappropriate moments. Still, she has class and elegance and maturity - though not at the same breath as in "Angels and Insects" (directed by Philip Haas who helmed this one as well). Anne Bancroft is the gossip-mongering neighbor married to Italian royalty who is as freewheeling and flirtatious as they come. Sean Penn is the added sparkle to this fine cast, his nuance and diction are as far removed from "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" as you might expect, and he is far more restrained than he usually is. He also has the right flair and chemistry in any scene he shares with Scott Thomas. Kudos must also go to Derek Jacobi's brief role as a flamboyant tour guide of sorts.
"Up at the Villa" is an uneven film, never quite finding the consistent tone that it needs, but it is slick and involving enough. Sometimes, pictaresque settings and Kristin Scott Thomas wearing any colorful wardrobe she chooses is often enough for me. "Up at the Villa" has plenty of both.

Hold on to your hats  Philip and Belinda Haas have made another dull
and slow-moving film.  Their latest is based on a W. Somerset Maugham
novella, which was directed by Philip and adapted for the screen by
Belinda, the duo responsible for the snore-fests Angels & Insects and
The Blood Oranges.
The setting may sound familiar - pre-World War II Florence at that time
when things are just beginning to get a bit uncomfortable for English
citizens living in Italy.  But this is no Tea With Mussolini.  Possibly
Crumpets With Clara (as in Peracci  Mussolini's mistress), but even
that would be pushing it.  I don't know where it's written that all
period pictures have to include at least one ballroom dancing scene that
features fancy chandeliers, ladies in long, white gloves and men in
tails and top hats.  Just once, I'd like to see a film that leaves this
scene out.  Or at least postpones it for the first thirty or forty
minutes.  Here, it's Villa's first scene.
Villa stars Kristin Scott Thomas (Random Hearts) as Mary Panton, a
widowed Brit freeloading in Florence (that would have been a better
title as well).  She hobnobs with society's upper crust, thanks to a
friendship with gossipy Princess San Ferdinando (Anne Bancroft, Keeping
the Faith), and even has a potential beau in Sir Edgar Swift (James
Fox, Mickey Blue Eyes).  He's the kind of uptight Englishman that seems
like he's got a pole jammed where the sun don't shine, and he requests
Mary's hand in marriage as if he just asked her to pass the Grey
Poupon.  Sir Edgar is also the Governor of Bengal, so Mary would be set
financially and socially for life.
Right off the bat, allow me to suggest two ways that Villa could have
been better.  First, they could have cast Jaime Foxx instead of James
Fox.  Now that's already more interesting.  Second, they could have made
his role as the Governor of Bengal involve wearing a rainbow-colored wig
at all of Cincinnati's home football games.
Anyway, Mary doesn't love Sir Edgar but will probably marry him
regardless.  Then she meets a randy American named Rowley Flint (Sean
Penn, Sweet and Lowdown) and confides her situation to him one evening
after a party.  Mary is obviously attracted to Rowley, but gives him a
fresh one when he tells her not to marry Sir Edgar and then tries to put
the moves on her.
Instead, Mary has a one-night fling with an Austrian refugee violin
player (Jeremy Davies, Ravenous) that ends up offing himself in a
particularly lackluster scene that I'm sure was supposed to be
suspenseful.  Mary and Rowley ditch the body and almost get caught,
which made me think that Villa had one more chance to redeem itself by
turning into Weekend at Bernie's Villa.  But, of course, it doesn't.
It's just too happy being miserably boring instead.  And who would have
thought that this role would have been more embarrassing for Bancroft
than Keeping the Faith?
1:55  PG-13 for light sexual content and mild violence
