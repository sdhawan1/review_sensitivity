MY LIFE SO FAR (director: Hugh Hudson; Screenwriter: Simon Donald, based
on the book "Son of Adam" by Denis Forman; cinematographer: Bernard
Lutic; cast: Colin Firth (Edward), Rosemary Harris (Gamma), Irene Jacob
(Heloise), Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (Moira), Malcolm McDowell (Uncle
Morris Macintosh), Robert Norman (Fraser), Tcheky Karyo (Gabriel
Chenoux), Kelly MacDonald (Elspeth), 1999)
An appealing view of life on a Scottish estate in 1927, as seen through
the eyes of a playful and innocent 10- year- old, Fraser (Robert
Norman). It is actually the nostalgic autobiography of British TV
executive Sir Denis Forman.
My Life So Far is cute, it has an angelic glow to it; it captures the
gorgeous scenery of the Argyll countryside and the mannerisms of the
eccentric well-to-do Pettigrew family. All the performances are
first-rate, its storytelling and sense of drama are done in a classy
manner, but it is a film that I quickly forgot about when leaving the
theater, though I did have a smile on my face. And I say the following
in a kindly manner, this is Masterpiece Theater stuff, appropriately
filmed for the mature audience that should appreciate such a blithe
period piece.
Into the serene family life in the country, comes a little anguish,
where the handsome and invigorating father, Edward Pettigrew (Firth) is
seen rescuing the five year old Fraser who has crawled out on the ledge
of the roof, by communicating with him dog style, and after rescuing him
he hoists his lively son proudly on his shoulders. A pretty picture is
painted of all the loyal servants and the many neighbors watching this
rescue, along with his adoring wife Moira (Mastrantonio) and Moira's
aging and kindly widowed mother, who goes by the name of Gamma (Harris).
She is the matriarch of the family and owns the Kiloran House, where
this adventure takes place.
Returning from his travels and other business interests, as he does once
or twice a year, is Gamma's eldest child and the probable heir to the
family estate, the worldly Morris Macintosh (Malcolm McDowell).
Apparently there is a strained but so far polite relationship between
him and his brother-in-law, Edward. They have different ideas on how to
manage the estate and Edward is the pious type, relating everything to
God that he likes, but to what he doesn't like, he attributes to the
work of the devil. Beethoven relates to God, his music is the sound of
God talking in his sleep, while Jazz relates to the devil's music. He is
also ridiculed by the elegant millionaire, Morris, for being childlike
and wasting his time with foolish inventions that fail to work or make
money. He has a factory on the estate which provides him with a marginal
income, where he is making toiletry items out of sphagnum moss, and
proudly states this is the only factory of its kind in Europe. But his
main obsession is with aviation. And when a dapper French pilot (Tcheky
Karyo) is forced to land his plane on Kiloran estate, a friendship grows
between them. Later on the pilot will return to court Fraser's older
sister, Elspeth (MacDonald), who was swept off her feet by the gallant
flyer.
The much older Morris (he must be in his fifties) also announces to the
surprise of the family that his finacée, a 24-year-old French amateur
cellist, the very attractive Heloise (Irene Jacob), will soon arrive on
the estate grounds and they will get married. Upon her arrival, Edward
is immediately taken with her beauty and her playing of Beethoven, as
everyone else on the estate is. Edward foolishly tries to make a pass at
her and talk her out of the marriage, but fails miserably in his
efforts. Instead, Heloise develops a special fondness in her heart for
Fraser, which makes his father even more jealous.
The comedy comes easily in this lush story, as there are the old-film
standby gags for comedy: featuring friendly dogs and an adorable kid.
The comedy also picks up when Fraser discovers in the attic his late
grandfather's books with pictures of naked women and reads about sexual
matters, such as prostitution and lesbianism, from a "Book of Ethics"
that he has no comprehension what it is about but amusingly tosses these
items out verbatim from what he read during the course of a dinner
conversation, to the chagrin and then laughter of the house guests.
The major tragedy of the film occurs when Gamma falls into the icy water
during a skating celebration and dies of pneumonia, leaving everyone
uncertain about their fate, as she was the glue that held the family
together, and it is of great concern to Edward who she will leave the
house to, because if she leaves it to Morris, he might be asked to leave
or have to put up with Morris' wishes on how to run the large estate.
The darkest character in the film is the Bible toting Edward. He is a
most perplexing character, wavering between moods of being absolutely
charming, to those of being repugnant. He loves Fraser and gives his son
all the love he can, but sometimes he drifts off with his own selfish
aims and refuses to think about anyone else in the family but himself.
It is when he acts as a prude, referring to a literal translation of the
Bible as his answer to how to live his life, that he becomes unbearable
to everyone but Fraser and Moira.
Fraser, unaware of what the conflicts between the brothers-in-laws
really means, takes all these happenings in stride without batting an
eye, endowed with the childlike innocence that makes everyone feel
comfortable in his presence. His coming-of-age education will also
include his viewing of a spat between his mother and father, as the rest
of the household also witnesses' that scene, when she rails against her
husband for chasing after Heloise, and gives him the ultimatum to shape
up and decide if he wants his large family to remain intact (by this
time there are six children).
This year in the life of Fraser, as he grows up with the fondest
memories of things that were not earth shattering but left their
indelible mark on his memory, such as the plane landing on the estate
grounds and playing Heloise' jazz records she gave him, and his sexual
curiosity being somewhat satisfied by all the questions he asks his
father, at least, he learned that he feels more sexually aroused when
bathed by the maid than when looking at naked pictures of women, provide
enough of an uplifting old-fashioned story to satisfy the gentler side
of me. It should suit even more than it does me, those who like their
art to be "nice and mild."

Cranky CriticŽ movie Reviews: My Life So Far
Starring Colin Firth, Rosemary Harris, Irene Jacob, Tcheky Karyo, Mary
Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Robbie Norman and Malcolm McDowell
Screenplay by Simon Donald
Based on "Son of Adam" by Sir Denis Forman
Directed by Hugh Hudson

My Life So Far is the kind of slice of life old school stories that
print critics wax poetic over. I could see calling it a well-acted,
intimate portrait of a puritan Scots family confronted by the deadly
sins of lust and greed, while dealing with a young boy's awakening
sexual curiosity. That's fair, but it doesn't relay the fact that this
flick is a dud.
Cranky has thought long and hard about why this beautifully photographed
film falls short of expectations -- director Hugh Hudson and producer
David Puttnam last worked together on Chariots of Fire; Puttnam is
responsible for the most excellent and highly recommended Local Hero. My
conclusions after the synopsis.
Set in Argyll, Scotland in 1927 My Life So Far is narrated by 10 year
old Fraser Pettigrew (Robbie Norman), a red haired, blue eyed cutey. His
father Edward (Colin Firth) is a bit of an eccentric inventor, whose
obsession with creating products out of moss brings him into conflict
with brother-in-law Morris (Malcolm McDowell). Morris, a self-made
millionaire, wants control of the family's estate, called Kilronan,
currently lorded over by his mom "Gamma MacIntosh" (Rosemary Harris).
Not only is Morris rich, this sixty-ish gent is sporting a brand-new
24-year old French wife named Heloise (Irene Jacob) whose affection for
young Fraser makes daddy Edward jealous. Wife Moira (Mary Elizabeth
Mastrantonio) keeps a stiff upper lip when she uncovers evidence of
Edward's infidelity.
Fraser narrates the story and, from time to time, inflicts bits of
wisdom gleaned from his deceased Grandfather's "Encyclopedia of Ethics"
into the family conversations. Problem is, the "encyclopedia" documents
various sexual peccadilloes and practices that the ten year old is way
to young to understand -- he suggests, for example, that his mother and
new aunt engage in the practice of prostitution to raise money to aid
the poor.
Yes, it's funny. Kidlets talking dirty always is, especially with the
upper class language that is the territory of this tale. But having a
ten year old, who has no conception of the sexual conflicts raging among
the adults around him, narrate the tale does nothing but hinder the
greater story. While Edward explains to Fraser that Beethoven is the
music that God dreams while Jazz is music that the Devil creates, the
boy is too young to understand the sexual subtext that jazz brought to
the 1920s. And this flick is packed with sexual symbolism. Hudson does a
visual dance around the question of whether Edward raped Heloise, or if
their one and only dalliance was consensual. (It's hard applying 1990s
standards to a 1920s setting. What may have been considered sexual
pressure as little as twenty years ago is considered "rape" today.) It
matters not to Moira, whose emotions are bottled up until the very end
of the flick.
Sorry, Cranky's writing like a film student. It happens from time to
time. But there's only a paragraph or so to go, so hang in there.
The print critics may rave about fine acting performances, and there are
two to be mentioned here: Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, who has little to
say, and must bear her emotional consternation silently; Malcolm
McDowell, as the loud (sic) I-know-better-than-you uncle whose character
is a flame burning in an emotionally dense fog. As good as this pair
are, it's not enough to recommend My Life So Far.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to My Life So Far, he would have
paid...
A Dud's a dud, regardless of the big name's attached.

MY LIFE SO FAR (PG).  
(Miramax/Village Roadshow)
Director: Hugh Hudson
Stars: Colin Firth, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Rosemary Harris,
Malcolm McDowell, Irene Jacob, Tcheky Karyo, Robbie Norman, Kelly
MacDonald, Freddie Jones, Brendan Gleeson
Running time: 96 minutes.
Set in Scotland in the period between world wars, this rather
forgettable and unspectacular tale from Hugh Hudson (Chariots Of Fire,
etc) seems inspired by the Merchant Ivory school of film making.  This
visually beautiful but dramatically dull family saga explores a life
of privilege and wealth that was soon to be changed forever by
sweeping events.  The film's sedate pace and gentle rhythm suggests
the calm before the storm.  Based on the memoirs of Sir Denis Forman,
one of the founding fathers of the British television industry, My
Life So Far really offers little of great insight or interest to
casual audiences.
The film is set in Kiloran, the sprawling ancestral estate in
the Scottish highlands that is home to the fictional Pettigrew family.
Much of the film unfolds from the perspective of its ten year old
narrator Fraser Pettigrew (a rather grating and unappealing
performance from newcomer Robbie Norman), who comes of age during this
period of great change.
His father is Edward Pettigrew (Colin Firth, from Shakespeare
In Love, etc), an eccentric inventor who also farms moss on the
property, and seems to lack any real sense of ambition.  His wife
Moira (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, wasted in a fairly thankless role)
raises the numerous children, and suffers her husband's foibles
quietly.  But the arrival of Edward's millionaire brother Morris
(Malcolm McDowell, in probably his most sympathetic and substantial
role for quite some time) and his much younger and beautiful French
fiancee Heloise (Irene Jacob) for a brief visit brings a new dynamic
and air of sexual tension to the house that eventually disrupts the
family harmony.  Fraser and Heloise develop a strong bond that upsets
Edward, who is secretly attracted to his future sister in law.
Another visitor to the property is Gabriel Chenoux (Tcheky Karyo), the
enigmatic French aviator, who also leaves his mark on the family.
Fraser's slow awakening to the broader world beyond the confines of
Kiloran provides the film with some of its humour and charm.
Beautifully shot around Argyle and the Scottish highlands, the
film certainly looks superb, and the period detail is spot on.
However, Hudson's direction is uninspired and unhurried, and lacks
flair.  The film moves at a sedate pace that may test the patience of
many.  This is little more than a routine television movie on a lavish
budget.
On the evidence of this glossy but rather uninspiring film,
it's been a rather unspectacular life so far.  It certainly doesn't
whet the appetite for further instalments in the rather ordinary life
and times of Fraser Pettigrew!

The radiantly inviting MY LIFE SO FAR by director Hugh Hudson (CHARIOTS
OF FIRE) is a good-spirited film about a family.
Not really.  It doesn't quite fit the mold of what we've come to expect
for something labeled a "family film," not that it wouldn't be
appropriate for kids at least 10, the age of the story's protagonist.
The story doesn't have much in the way of slapstick and the comedy is
written with a sharp wit that never talks down to the audience.  Nicely
framed with dramatic flourishes, the story is filled with touching humor
that reminds us of our own childhood, especially when we first heard
about sex.  Told without a single crude or vulgar moment, the sweet tale
has a refreshing honesty and, most of all, an innocence that is
light-years away from raunchy films like AMERICAN PIE.
The intelligent script by Simon Donald is based on part of Denis
Forman's autobiography.  With the richness of one of the best
Masterpiece Theater television series (which is meant as a high
compliment), the movie evokes a warmly nostalgic feeling for a time that
few of us have ever experienced.  Set in the mid-1920s in Argyll,
Scotland, the story takes place in one of those lavish country estates
with as many people living downstairs as up.
At the center of the story is a spunky and inquisitive 10-year-old,
Fraser Pettigrew (Robert Norman), who lives in the enormous house with
his equally large family.  He figures his mother's frequent pregnancies
must be because she's trying to fill up all those bedrooms.
His boyish father, Edward (Colin Firth), loves nothing better than
playing with his children, even if they aren't wild about some of his
games, like jumping into a freezing cold lake.  Edward is an inventor
who has built the only sphagnum moss factory in Europe.  As much a hobby
as a business, the factory churns out moss products ranging from bandage
substitutes to soap to cigars, not all of them successes.
"My dad has two obsessions," Fraser explains, "Beethoven and the Bible."
A devout man, Edward enjoys giving sermons at the local church.
Reasonably tolerant, Edward only gets really worked up about the playing
of jazz, which he loathes.  Beethoven, on the other hand, he says is
"the voice of God when he's asleep."
Fraser's mother, Moira (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), has a generous
spirit and indulges most, if not all, of her husband's whims.  Both
spouses start off as one-note characters, but slowly and subtly evolve
into much richer and complex ones.  Mastrantonio, especially, gives a
graceful performance that shows how much an actress can reveal about her
character while keeping her emotions in check, as they would have been
in that era.
The talented supporting cast further enriches the production.  Rosemary
Harris plays the family's matriarchal grandmother.  Malcolm McDowell
plays Morris Macintosh, Moira's jealous brother who resents her living
in the family estate rather than him.  Morris's lovely fiancée, who is
half his age, is played bewitchingly by French actress Irčne Jacob, the
star of Krzysztof Kieslowski's RED.  Both Fraser and his father are
smitten by her, but the son is too young to do more than dream about
her, and the father finds himself already, if somewhat inconveniently,
committed.
The movie concerns the year that Fraser was 10.  Although many incidents
occur, the most interesting of the lot surround the effect of Fraser's
reading habits.  In the attic, he comes across a treasure trove of
"secret" books belonging to his deceased grandfather.  Before the
Internet, there were books for parents to fret over.
Typical of these is an encyclopedia, where he finds the article on
prostitution so fascinating that he reads it 3 times.  In the film's
funniest scene, he innocently uses his newfound knowledge among a large
group of adults.  Other words will get him into similar trouble.
After finding some nude etchings inside one of the books, he studies
them with the intensity of a scholar.  "Now, I possibly know more about
naked ladies than my father does," he decides.
At one point, Fraser puts a question bluntly, but sincerely, to his
father, who has been talking to him rather obtusely about an awkward
sexual subject.  "What are the temptations of the flesh?" he asks
boldly.  "What are they?" his shocked and stammering father replies.
"What are they?  They are to be avoided at all costs.  That's what they
are."
The genial comedy, which doesn't have or need much of a plot, finds a
perfect little scene to wrap it up.  When the ending credits start to
roll, you feel thankful that the Pettigrews have allowed you to spend
time with them.  The experience has felt more like a visit than a movie.
MY LIFE SO FAR runs just 1:33.  It is in Scottish English which
sometimes requires careful listening.  The movie is rated PG-13 for
sexual content, including some nude pictures.  It would be fine for kids
around 10 and up, but in order to appreciate the subject matter more, 12
and up would be better.
My son Jeffrey, age 10, gave the movie ** and thought the story flipped
around too much.  His friend John, age 11, thought the story was good
and gave the movie ** 1/2.  John's twin Steven, who gave the picture ***
1/2, really liked the story and thought it was funny.  Watching them,
you could see that, like the 10-year-old in the picture, they sometimes
felt uneasy about the (non-explicit) sexual content of the movie.  At
other times they were fascinated and found it humorous.

     I guess you're either one of those people who loves 1930's Scottish
coming-of-age stories, or you're not.
     Narrated by the precocious Fraser (Norman), we tour the life of a
wee Scottish lad who seems brilliant beyond his years.  Fraser's life is
dominated by his large family, which runs a sphagnum moss plantation 
the only one in Europe, we're told (many times).  There's dad (Firth), a
Beethoven freak and spare-time inventor; mom (Mastrantonio in a bad
Scottish accent), the wallflower; Gamma (Harris), the gamma; crusty
Uncle Morris (McDowell  wasted in this role); and his child
fiancée/bride Eloise (Jacob).
     What a fine, dysfunctional family they make, what with dad's
inventions going awry, and both father and son making goo-goo eyes for
Eloise.  And when Fraser finds grandpa's old stash of Victorian-era
pornography stashed away in the attic, boy, look out!
     All of this tries to be very quaint and sweet, but turns out to be
perverse and disturbing, to say the least.  Dad is nothing short of a
lech, and in fact, all the adults in this picture are sorry role
models.  (No small wonder that the epilogue states that Fraser grew up
to be `a successful television executive.'  Fitting indeed.)
     MY LIFE SO FAR wants to be a hybrid of UNSTRUNG HEROES and COLD
COMFORT FARM, but lacks the charm of either of them.  Instead, it's just
a twisted little art movie that will probably get steamrollered on
release.
     The opening credits warn you that this `Based on a True Story.'
Why they picked *this* story to turn into a movie is beyond me.
Director: Hugh Hudson
Producer: Steve Norris, David Puttnam

   Coming-of-age movies in America of late lean toward the
grotesque and cynical.   Alexander Payne's "Election," for
example, has no role models you'd want to emulate,
centering on a young woman whose driving ambition serves
as pretext to gain affection--which she never does win. 
Horror stories like "Scream" and its sequel are tongue-in-
cheek, good for laughs, but have no confidence in audience
sentimentality.  The Europeans treat the genre no differently. 
Agnieszka Holland's "Europa Europa," a dazzler when
introduced in 1991, portrays a German-Jewish teen who must
conceal his identity only to find himself drafted into Hitler's
army.
   Things weren't always this way.  For all his melancholy,
Eugene O'Neill turned out a resplendent comedy about the
kind of childhood he wished he had.  His "Ah! Wilderness!",
which hit the stage right in the middle of the Great
Depression, portrays a 17-year-old boy who passes from
adolescence to manhood during a two-day crisis when his girl
friend's folks break off his relationship with their daughter,
leading Richard into a hilarious night of drinking with a tart in
a local bar.
   Perhaps "My Life So Far," based on the autobiography of
renowned British TV producer Sir Denis Forman, will break
the current mold.  With childhood portrayed so frequently as
a time of sturm und drang, how refreshing to watch a movie
which avoids treacle while simultaneously portraying a kid
whose family life is deliriously happy!  At the center of the
tale--which is engagingly told and photographed handsomely
amid the wonderful greenery of the Scottish countryside--is
the adorable, outgoing Fraser (Robert Norman), whose
emotional health remains firm despite the idiosyncrasies he
observes daily around him.  
   Fraser has been born into a wealthy family living on a lush
estate owned by the aging Gamma (Rosemary Harris).  The
manor has a full staff of enthusiastic maids, a veritable
menagerie of dogs ranging from a wee West Highland White
to an enormous Scottish Deerhound, and best of all is
headed by daddy Edward (Colin Firth) whose inventions are
themselves like the punch lines of shaggy dog stories. 
Married to the relatively colorless Moira (Mary Elizabeth
Mastrantonio), Edward springs to amorous life when his
millionaire brother Morris (Malcolm McDowell) introduces the
family to his new, 24-year-old French fiance, Heloise (Irene
Jacob).  If young Fraser Pettigrew displays innocence of the
birds and bees, puzzling in his home library over mythological
accounts of lesbians, prostitutes and orgies, he is about to
lose his naivete under the influence of this pert, perky, cellist-
-with whom the entire manor seems to have fallen in love.
   Filmed on location in lovely Argyll, Scotland, "My Life So
Far" may not portray the sort of opulent backdrop that
constituted the environment of most movie viewers , but
anyone with a modicum of sensibility will be caught up in this
appealing kid's experiences with the adult world, seen
through his perceptive vision and intelligent mind.  Though
his father has has his flaws, albeit the sort of blemishes that
any red-blooded Scot might be expected to possess, his is
the sort of dad we all wish we'd had.  He takes the boy
fishing, introduces him to an adventurous pilot known as the
emperor of the sky, imbues him with lectures about moral
fiber ("Beethoven is God talking in his sleep; jazz is the
devil"), never punishes the lad, and seems never to have
need to do so.  All in the movie audience whose creative side
dominates their brains (presumably the kind for whom movies
should appeal the most) will cheer Edward's inventive genius,
however impractical, as he invests his time and wealth into
the development of a plant herb as a cure for disease while
his more pragmatic brother, Morris, belittles the man's
quixoticism.  
  Director Hugh Hudson devotes considerable time to close-
ups of this wonderful man's expressions, each of which tells a
story about his feelings at the time, particularly envy of his
boorish brother's good luck in catching the gifted Heloise.  At
once the most poignant and comical scenes are of the 10-
year-old boy's struggle to understand the passages he reads
in the books about the Greeks, with a classic episode of a
stuttering father faced with the inevitable queries about the
pleasures of the flesh.  There are wonderful episodes
displaying the close relationship that young Fraser enjoys
with the bevy of servants, including his daily ritual of pouring
tea for each of them in the kitchen.  The frighteningly
competent assortment of acting talent from the formidable
stage actress Rosemary Harris to Robert Norman in his first
professional role adds to the evocation of rural Scotland
during the last twenties and early thirties.
