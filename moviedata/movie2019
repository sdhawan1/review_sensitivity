Do not get Zeram. It is a live action movie, which they turned into a
anmation just recently called IRIA: Zeiram The Animation.
The basic plot of the movies are the same. IRIA is a bounty hunter, with
her computerised partner BOB, who is after the universes most dangerous
live being, the Zeram . But in the live action, the place is on
modern day Japan, where you have these 2 electricians (Japanese equivalent
to the Mario Bros.) who bump into Iria, and get sent to the Zone 
But in IRIA: Zeiram The Animation, it starts of on a the planet Mynse, with
BOB (he is human), Glen (Iria's borther) and Fujicrow (another Bounty
Hunter) doing a rescue mission on this space station where the Zeiram is
making mince meat of every one and any one. Glen disappears the explosion
of the space station. Afterward, Bod dies and get is conscience tranfered
to a computer. And Iria is now hunting the Zeiram, or is the Zeiram hunting
her? And what has happened to Glen? 
Zeram is really stoopid. Gun Hed was far better. Zeram could be discribed
at Mario Brothers Meets ALIEN. As where IRIA: Zeiram The Animation is alot
better.
