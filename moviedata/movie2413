Roger Corman is today best known as the producer who nursed
many future giants of American cinema into maturity. But his
own achievements as writer and director are somewhat
obscure, hardly known outside small circles of cult cinema
aficionados. This could be partially explained with the fact
that many of Corman's films happened to be shot with
laughably low budgets and in just few days, and such
circumstances naturally affected quality of Corman's work.
On the other hand, some of those films later earned cult
status among lovers of B-cinema. The best known among them
is 1960 black comedy LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS, which had the
honour of being turned into Broadway musical and mainstream
Hollywood remake. One year before Corman made another,
somewhat lesser known but even better black comedy A BUCKET
OF BLOOD.
Film begins in bohemian cafe frequented by beatniks,
pretentious artist wannabes, drug dealers and undercover
police officers. Walter Paisley (played by Dick Miller) is
young nerdish busboy who has two dreams in life - one is to
become great artist and fulfil ideals expounded in beat
poetry by one of cafe's regular guests, Maxwell Brock
(played by Julian Burton); another is to impress Carla
(played by Barboura Harris), beautiful girl who frequents
the caf with her artistic crowd. Unfortunately, Walter
lacks the talent and pursuit of his dreams only gets him to
trouble with his boss Leonard Di Cenzo (played by Anthony
Carbone). One faithful night, however, Walter's luck changes
when he accidentally stabs landlady's cat. In order to cover
his deed, he wraps cat's remains in the plaster, but the
result is mistaken for genuine sculpture by the artistic
crowd in Di Cenzo's cafe. Sculpture known as "Dead Cat"
becomes praised for realistic details and Walter is suddenly
heralded as talented young artist. Everyone, including his
boss, pressure him to continue making similar works of art.
Unfortunately, Walter still lacks the proper talent so he
again must use unconventional methods to produce sculpture
and, as a result, people start disappearing.
A BUCKET OF BLOOD could easily be described as "best film
ever made in less than five days". In some other cases this
phrase would indicate not so enviable quality of the film,
but in case of Roger Corman this is the ultimate compliment
to his talent. Despite time constraints and low budget, this
legendary filmmaker managed to produce one of the most
entertaining B-films of all times, but his ingenuity didn't
manifest only in quantity of macabre humour but also managed
to transcend the limits of cheap exploitation cinema by
taking satirical approach to some amusing realities of
present day world. His view on Beat phenomenon is something
more than satirical comment on subcultures of 1950s America;
his approach towards individuals who want to rise above
their sad, meaningless existence by following popular
cultural trends could be applied to many similar subcultures
that emerged before and after. Furthermore, in the character
of Paisley we might find Corman's very unflattering
self-portrayal - a hack filmmaker with high, unreachable
artistic ambitions.
Corman's long-time collaborator and talented screenwriter
Charles B. Griffith supplies the film with easily drawn but
memorable character, as well as sharp and memorable lines.
One of the most hilarious examples could be found in the
poems by Maxwell Brock. Poetic monologue, recited by Julian
Barton while Paul Horn plays saxophone in the background is
not just one of the most effective movie openings, but also
a great text (some of my friends learned it by heart, just
like the fans of PULP FICTION know Jules' sermon by heart).
The acting is also excellent and surpasses LITTLE SHOP OF
HORRORS. Dick Miller, one of the most recognisable character
actors in American cinema, is great in his only lead role.
His partners also shine - late Barboura Harris transcends
Love Interest stereotypes by making believable impression of
true art lover; Anthony Carbone creates a lot of laughs in
scenes of macabre humour and, finally; Julian Burton is
excellent as true representative of beatnik royalty.
Unfortunately, A BUCKET OF BLOOD has some problems with less
then inspired ending, but this should probably explained
with shooting schedules than with Griffith's or Corman's
lack of talent. Jazz music by Fred Katz is great, including
guitar numbers that give surreal atmosphere to this film.
All in all, A BUCKET OF BLOOD is probably one of the best,
albeit underrated black comedies ever made.

  A BUCKET OF BLOOD (director: Roger Corman; screenwriter: Charles B. Griffith;
cinematographer: Jacques Marquette; editor: Anthony Carras; cast: Dick Miller
(Walter Paisley), Barboura Morris (Carla), Anthony Carbone (Leonard), Julian
Burton (Maxwell Brock), Ed Nelson (Art, Undercover Cop), Bert Convy (Lou,
Undercover Cop), John Brinkley (Will, the hustler's partner), Jhean Burton
(Maolia), John Herman Shaner (Beatnik), Judy Bamber (Alice), Bruno VeSota (Art
Collector), Lynn Storey (Sylvia), Myrtle Vail (Landlady,Mrs. Surchart), Paul
Horn (Sax Player); Runtime: 66; American International; 1959) 
This one is my favorite Roger Corman (Little House of Horrors) film--it's
replete with beatniks, artists, druggies, narcs, tourists, and folk singers
hanging around a Greenwich Village coffeehouse called the Yellow Door. It plays
out as a horror comedy low-budget B-film that is a parody of the hip art world
and those who seek fame. Its satire cuts deeper into this bohemian world than
most other films. Walter Paisley is a nerdy busboy living a lonely life
idolizing the beat artists he encounters on the job, but is not talented enough
to be an artist. He dreams of becoming a famous artist and marrying his dream
girl Carla (Morris), who also works at the coffeehouse hangout. Listening to
anti-establishment poet Maxwell Brock (Julian Burton) recite his bitter poem
against materialism, Walter literally memorized every line and craves to follow
in the poet's footsteps. 
When his landlady's cat gets stuck in the wall of his apartment and the meows
irritate him, he tries to get the cat out of the wall by digging it out with his
kitchen knife. He accidently stabs it to death, but remembering Maxwell's rant
about creation not being a Graham cracker he pours clay over the cat and comes
up with a gruesome statue. He entitles the realistic work "Dead Cat." He gets
the materialistic coffeehouse owner, Leonard (Carbone), to display it for his
clientele. When Maxwell lauds the work, Walter receives instant popularity among
the beatniks. Maolia (Jhean Burton), who hangs out at the coffeehouse, is so
attracted to him for what he's accomplished, that she lays some heroin on him.
Unfortunately for Walter, an undercover cop, Lou (Bert Convy), spots the
exchange and goes to Walter's pad to arrest him. Walter fearing the cop will
shoot him, kills him when he bops him over the head with a frying pan. He
becomes his next great work of art called simply "Murdered Man." 
Walter is discovered by Leonard as a murderer, but since collectors are willing
to pay big bucks for such detailed realistic work--he doesn't tell the cops.
Instead, Walter continues getting new subjects until his few moments of fame
come to a macabre end. 
Charles B. Griffith provides the film with a witty script. Character actor Dick
Miller gives an impressionable performance, as does his romantic interest
Barboura Morris. Julian Burton as an Allen Ginsberg guru-type, influencing the
bohemian scene and setting the standards for their art, is forceful in his role.
It's a bloody black comedy that is gruesomely funny and because of its
unsophisticated way of probing into the underground art world--it exudes a
radiant charm, a true cult film delight from the 1950s made for all eras. 
It might be of interest to note that the film was completed ahead of schedule,
so Corman had the sets for another three days and used that time to make another
classic low-budget cult film with the same theme called Little Shop of Horrors
(also written by Charles B. Griffith).
