     THE DELICATE ART OF THE RIFLE has been billed an "action adventure"
by our local newspaper, "The News and Observer."  I'd place the locally
produced (and, so far, locally distributed) feature closer to comedy.
Perhaps black comedy.  Perhaps *absurdist* comedy, as there isn't much
realism to this tale of a college theater tech (David Grant) who happens
upon his roommate (Stephen Grant) shooting people from atop a campus
building.  The script is frequently funny, but the movie is long and, at
times, tedious.  (A brutal sound mix doesn't help matters much, either.
Oof.)  Filmed on or around my alma mater, North Carolina State Univer-
sity.  And, for when they become famous, the names to remember are Dante 
Harper (director), Stephen Grant (also writer), Todd Flinchum (producer), 
and Alicia Kratzer (production designer).
