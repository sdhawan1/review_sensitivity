     Temps of the world unite!  It's an ugly world out there for those
on the lowest rung of the business social ladder - the temporary
workers.
     The four brave temps in first-time director Jill Sprecher's
irreverent CLOCKWATERS are ready to rebel against their oppression.
Treated with worse than disdain, they are alternately ignored and
ordered about like slave labor.  Figuring that their latest employer,
Global Credit, cannot function without them, they take a vow to skip
work en masse one day.  Follow-through, however, is not their strong
suit.
     Marvelously cast, the film stars Toni Collette (MURIEL'S WEDDING)
as the timid and ambitionless worker, Iris, Parker Posey (THE HOUSE OF
YES) as the rebellious leader, Margaret, Lisa Kudrow (ROMY AND
MICHELE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION) as the no-talent, wannabe actress,
Paula, and Alanna Ubach (DENISE CALLS UP) as the would-be married,
Jane.  Together they spend their hours looking busy while waiting for
the clock to strike 5.  "I can sit there and do nothing as good as
anyone," Margaret explains in her rationale for why she should be
considered just as competent as the workers she fills in for.
     Pamela Marcotte's sets create a scarily sterile office environment
that is creepily realistic.  As devoid of personality as the landscape
of the moon, the office has small partitions to separate the clerical
workers and glass walls to ensconce the professional staff as the
business equivalent of the aristocracy.
     The wry script, by the director and her sister, Karen Sprecher, is
full of subtle humor and poignancy.  Even when the Dilbert-like
situations are exaggerated, they always possess gems of frightening
truth.  One manager obsesses over office supply usage and another
issues stern memos warning about the personal use of corporate
resources, the phone system in this case.  Whereas workers may not have
encountered these exact forms of corporate repression, most will be
able to identify with slight variations in the harassment.
     Although the story is more a comedy of manners coupled with social
satire, it takes the time to develop the four women into real
characters with interesting backgrounds.  The last half of the story
concerns a mystery about an office kleptomaniac, but the movie doesn't
leave much doubt about the identity of the miscreant.
     The film creates four individuals whose plights are easy to
empathize with and who are naturally funny without trying to be so.
With its Kafkaesque plot, the characters are more pitiable than
hilarious, although they are both and usually at the same time.
     CLOCKWATHCERS runs 1:36.  It is rated PG-13 for a little profanity
and would be fine for kids around 10 and up although its office-based
humor may even be over the heads of most teenagers.
     The film is playing now in New York.  It will hopefully come to
the San Jose area later this summer, but it currently has no local
booking.

Jill Sprecher's "Clockwatchers," is my favorite type of film. It is a 
film that effortlessly observes characters and situations in an everyday 
setting, and feels as if you could be watching a documentary because it 
is so real.
At the start of, "Clockwatchers," Iris (Toni Collette), a shy, 
frumpy-looking young woman, starts a job at a credit office as a temp 
secretary, and is able to break out of her weak shell thanks to meeting 
and becoming friends with three other temps at the office---the 
rebellious Margaret (Parker Posey), who shows Iris the ropes; Paula 
(Lisa Kudrow), a beautiful woman who always claims she is in the middle 
of acting jobs, but we sense is just trying to cover up her unhappiness; 
and Jane (Alanna Ubach), who is about to marry an insensitive guy who 
tries to buy her things everytime he does something wrong. As the film 
follows these four completely original and intriguing characters, an 
underlying story develops, involving a mystery worker at the office who 
is stealing the belongings of everyone else. Could one of Iris' friends 
be behind the crime, or is it Cleo (Helen Fitzgerald), an unusual, 
silent character who has just been brought into the company as vice 
executive?
"Clockwatchers" is a jewel of a film, and it was so refreshing to watch 
the characters and their various interactions with each other that I 
totally got caught up in it. 
Thanks to the smart, perceptive screenplay, also written by Sprecher, 
and the performances by all four leads, the characters easily were able 
to come alive. Collette is outstanding as the repressed person in the 
group who slowly grows stronger as she becomes friends with the other 
three. Posey is winning and humorous, as a woman who hides behind a 
shield of one-liners and sarcasm, blocking herself from everyone else. 
And Kudrow is startlingly touching as the blonde bombshell who knows she 
isn't getting what she expected out of her life.
The mystery that surrounds the picture does not feel at all like a 
gimmick, even though it very well could have, and is highly 
unpredictable and surprising, and the final revelation is quiet and 
moving.
Credit also must go to the way that the film portrays the life of an 
office worker. For temp secretaries, their days are filled with long, 
empty hours of sitting, being bored, and doing petty chores such as 
copying applications and stapling papers. We rarely ever get to see this 
sort of close observation in a work setting on film, and it was 
fascinating from the first frame to the last.
If there is any sort of problem with "Clockwatchers," it is that more 
could have been done with the supporting characters, but this does not 
at all put a dent in the effectiveness of, "Clockwatchers," which is an 
affirming, confidant first film from Jill Sprecher, a talent I hope we 
get to see a lot more of in the future.

   As Michael Moore points out so incisively in his
documentary "The Big One," greedy corporations will do
anything to amass profits.  Even companies on a roll thanks
to the faithful toil of their workers will throw their hirelings to
the wolves if doing so will garner more specie for the
stockholders.   "Clockwatchers," neither as flat-out hilarious as
"The Big One" nor as lacerating, treats the dilemma of
downsizing in a more heartfelt way.  In Jill Sprecher's sincere
motion picture, educated women are unable to find permanent
jobs, implicitly because American companies prefer to hire
temporary workers in order to avoid paying benefits.  These
temps are kept on simply because the enterprises who hire
them can get away with doing so.  What had been during the
1950s simply a small sector of the economy has now become
almost a norm.  Lower-level workers are anonymous and
dispensable, shunned as pariahs and as people of little
consequence by their colleagues who are "permanent" as well
as by the executives who exploit them.
   Obviously, their low status on the corporate totem pole is
going to have effects on the temps' character.  Jill and Karen
Sprecher have captured the consequence of company policy
so well that they've either done their homework or have been
temps themselves.  The Sprechers are not so doctrinaire that
they blame the economy for every blemish in the employees'
make-up: they are more interested in providing us with three-
dimensional portraits of four particular women working for a
large credit firm, women who even without the abuse they
abide are quirky gals and therefore thoroughly entertaining.
   Take Iris (Toni Collette), for example.  Here's a young
woman whose flaws were likely present long before she took
on a job as a temporary worker.  Not so much announcing
her presence at her new assignment as skulking into the post,
she acts like a scared deer gazing in terror at the headlights
of an oncoming Mack truck.  Asked to have a seat while the
manager is fetched, she remains hunched over in a chair for
two hours before the appropriate person greets her with
astonishment: "Why didn't you tell me you were here?" 
Luckily, she is befriended by the office extrovert, Margaret
(Parker Posey), who steals the movie from that point. 
Margaret shows her the ropes.  If a client phones, she may
simply hang up ("If its' important he'll call back") or gives him
advice on buying and selling as though she were really
instructed by an executive to do so: ("He says go ahead an
sell").   Jane (Alanna Ubach), yet another temp, whines that
nobody mixes with her kind or tells her anything of
importance, illustrating her gripe by an experience she had
while working at a bank: "There was this button on the desk
and I kept looking at it every day for a month and finally I just
pushed it.  It was the alarm."  Paula (Lisa Kudrow) lives a
fantasy, allegedly going to auditions and telling her co-workers
that she's a temp only until she gets the starring role she
deserves in a movie.
   Aside from this clearly differentiated quartet, director
Sprecher hones in on familiar office types such as the anal-
retentive supplies person who seems to develop stomach
pains when he has to issue a pencil; the suave and
handsome junior exec who looks right through the women
who help him out and seems never to learn their names; the
efficient office manager who chirps instructions on how to
arrange the papers on the desk for maximum neatness; the
CEO who baldly insists that everyone in the office is like
family.
   The movie gets its name from the principal activity of the
officer workers, which is to stare at the big wall timepiece with
the passion of fourth-graders eager to get out of school and
watch the Jerry Springer show.  While we in the audience are
unlikely to gaze at our own watches, we do become aware of
the passage of time during the second half of the movie,
when a contrived element is introduced into the plot.  A series
of thefts puts the office on security alert, making the daily
grind at once more exciting and more strained.  Naturally
everyone concludes that the temps--who have no roots in the
job--are the culprits.  What should have been a passing plot
point changes the focus of the movie, which begins to lose its
comic good will.
   Sprecher never really goes for the throat the way Michael
Moore does in "Roger and Me" and in "The Big One," but her
laid-back and frequently mirthful film serves as a gentle
warning on the way our society is headed.  The dissolution of
the bonds connecting labor and management may lead to
higher profits, at least in the short run.  But what sort of
country will we have as wealth continues to become
concentrated in fewer and fewer hands and the majority of the
population are as alienated as Karl Marx's proverbial
proletariat?  Rated PG-13.  Running time: 96 minutes.  (C)

     Although working the hours of nine-to-five, five days a week can be 
a tremendous grind for a permanent employee, it's even more difficult 
for a temp.  CLOCKWATCHERS, directed by first-time film maker Jill 
Sprecher, and written by Sprecher and her sister, Karen, has such a ring 
of authenticity that it's easy to believe that one or both of the 
Sprechers have had some experience with temporary work.  The details are 
precise; if there's one area where the movie falls short, it's that the 
plot becomes a little farfetched during the second half.
     CLOCKWATCHERS opens with a brilliant scene that is repeated daily, 
all across the country, in hundreds of work places.  A secretarial temp, 
Iris (Toni Collette), arrives to start a new assignment with Global 
Credit.  She gets there a few minutes early and is ignored by the 
receptionist, who doesn't go on duty until the clock strikes nine.  
Then, she is shown into the office complex, where she is told to wait 
until someone comes to tell her what to do.  Two hours later, she's 
still waiting.  During all that time, no one has shown the slightest 
interest in her; she's a temp, and, therefore, beneath notice.  In terms 
of the office food chain, she's plankton.
     Four temps work for Global Credit, filing papers, making copies, 
and stuffing envelopes.  In addition to the meek, mousy Iris, there's 
Margaret (Parker Posey), a rebel who doesn't mind raising eyebrows by 
speaking her mind; Paula (Lisa Kudrow), an airheaded blond with acting 
aspirations; and Jane (Alanna Ubach), a woman with low self-esteem who 
is willing to marry an insensitive fiancé just to get out of the 
corporate rat race.  For its first fifty minutes, CLOCKWATCHERS explores 
the developing friendship among these four as their common employment 
status forms a natural bond.  Then, during the film's second half, 
Sprecher investigates how the existence of an office kleptomaniac 
fosters distrust and paranoia, elevating the level of tension and 
fragmenting friendships.
     The thing I liked best about CLOCKWATCHERS is its understanding and 
subtly satirical presentation of life in a rigidly conservative office, 
where anything other than strict conformance is regarded with a frown.  
Many employees have so little work that, in Margaret's words, "The real 
challenge is trying to look busy when there's nothing to do."  One man 
guards his stash of pencils, pens, and rubber bands like they are 
precious jewels.  A woman lectures the temps on grooming, absenteeism, 
and observing company rules.  Meanwhile, everyone counts down the 
minutes remaining until quitting time.
     Being a permanent employee offers a sense of belonging, no matter 
how unfriendly the company.  Being a temp can be an exercise in 
alienation.  Iris, Margaret, Paula, and Jane all have bigger plans.  
Whether they will ever realize their dreams is another matter 
altogether.  Margaret observes that she feels like she could vanish and 
no one would notice for weeks.  Iris' father encourages her to apply for 
a permanent job  a task that she approaches with reluctance.  Paula 
goes to auditions, then lies about getting bit parts in plays.  And Jane 
plans her wedding like it's a lifeline to a better existence.
     All four lead actresses do fine jobs.  Toni Collette (MURIEL'S 
WEDDING), whose natural Australian accent is completely submerged here, 
is believable as the shy woman who comes out of her shell as a result of 
her interaction with her fellow temps.  Parker Posey, the reigning queen 
of independent films, is suitably loud as the brassy Margaret, the 
proverbial square peg in a round hole.  Lisa Kudrow plays Paula 
according to type  a ditzy blond lacking a real direction in her life.  
(For an opportunity to see Kudrow do something completely different, 
check her out in THE OPPOSITE OF SEX.)  Alanna Ubach (DENISE CALLS UP) 
emphasizes Jane's quiet desperation.
     CLOCKWATCHERS is being billed as a comedy, and, in many ways, it is 
one.  But there's also a lot of drama here, and, as the film moves 
along, there are fewer and fewer laughs.  Essentially, this is an 
autopsy of a lifestyle, and, while a lot about it seems funny at first, 
the more we get to know the characters and understand the futility of 
their lives, the more disheartening it becomes.  The last 30 to 40 
minutes, which emphasize the kleptomaniac subplot, mark the least 
successful portion of the film.  However, although the plot device of 
having an office thief can seem like a contrivance, the way the 
characters react to the increase in tension is both interesting and 
illuminating.
     With CLOCKWATCHERS, Sprecher has created a setting that may be 
bizarre to those unfamiliar with the world of office temping, but will 
seem on-target for anyone who has endured a foray into this lifestyle.  
Like last year's IN THE COMPANY OF MEN, CLOCKWATCHERS offers a 
perspective of the American corporate office that is both viciously 
satirical and depressingly accurate.

CLOCKWATCHERS (director: Jill Sprecher; cast: (Iris)Toni Collette,
(Margaret) Parker Posey, (Jane) Alanna Ubach, (Paula) Lisa Kudrow, 1998)
Just killing time, four female ' temps ' become workplace friends as
they try and cope with work and life in this disarmingly subtle movie,
that seems to grow more and more metaphysical by the minute. These '
temps ' are looking for something permanent in their lives. Each is
insecure and unhappy. They are looking for a way out of this rat trap.
Toni is introspective and passive. Parker is perky and rebellious. She
is very mischievous and depressed because she is not able to fulfill her
career ambitions. Lisa dreams about stardom, she is living in a fantasy
world. Alanna is in a mental stupor, obliviously going into a marriage
that has inherent danger signs to it. The dullness and pettiness of
office life matches their real life situations.
The plot develops around how tenuous such office friendships can be, and
how death-like is the atmosphere they work in, and how frighteningly
transient everything seems to be. It was eerie to watch everything break
down for these girls--- their hopes, friendships, and self-esteem. And
when it was the ' temps ' who were suspected of some office thievery,
they see for themselves how far down the ladder others in the workplace
really perceive them.
In the end, Toni comes off the best, gaining the most from her
experiences. She realizes that she should have spoken up when Parker was
in trouble, that it is important for the girls to stick together.
Their alienation is a national problem for both men and women. That
society can be repressive and authoritarian, is still true today, as
this film encourages you to see and think about what has really changed
after all the Women's Lib Movement agendas and all the other changes in
the workplace that have been accomplished, especially for women, and if
these changes have really made life better for them.
I was most interested in the Parker character because of her spunkiness
and her awkward attempts to form real friendships, as they all seemed to
be met with some disappointment, and the veneer she chooses to hide
behind is so easy to pull off her as a false mask, as she is the one who
gets hit the hardest, getting canned from a job that she only has
contempt for; and, she is the one who seems the most alone in the end;
she does not seem to have support from any of the following: parents,
lovers, friends, or even a roommate, who is always away. She seems to be
the one who, in actuality, is the least able to take care of herself,
which is in sharp contrast to how she conducted herself in the beginning
of the film; and Toni, of all people, realizes this, and becomes the
only one who comes to her aid, even if it is done indirectly, it is she
who writes a job recommendation for her when Parker's world has
completely crashed, and she does this by using the guile she evidently
picked up from Parker.
A gem of a small movie...  adeptly uncovering the need for positive
relationships and the need for solidarity in a hostile workplace, which
might as well be a metaphor for how to handle yourself in the world. The
inability of the girls to function in this modern society, is punctuated
by their need to question what they are doing and their need to belong
to something that makes sense to them. And even though, no smug answers
were given as how to accomplish this, one does have choices; at least,
you can start by facing up to yourself and your situation, and not just
marking time and staying put on a job that bores you. This movie
definitively brought up a topic a lot of people are concerned about, and
even if it said it in a low voice, its message can be heard above the
idle chatter in the office, if you are tuned in to the right cubicle.

Recently, about 2PM, I had this choice: I could continue watching the
Yankee game -- it was about the 4th inning, the Yankees had scored a
couple of runs, Cone was pitching well, but I wasn't paying that much
attention -- or I could also see a movie.
I was thinking of seeing "Deep Impact", mainly to see the big tidal
wave (I had noted the wave didn't seem to go much past, say, Fulton
Street, so I thought the Upper West Side would remain dry, but, really,
I had to confirm this), but with mixed reviews, I wasn't sure if I was
up to seeing a couple hours of people being reconciled with their
family members and working out various personal issues before the comet
hits.
[I actually am not sure how the movie ends, if the big comet hits or
not.  I think it'd be funny if it didn't hit, but no one told the folks
living in the big cave.  The could emerge two years later to find a
Walmart next to the entrance.  Laughter would ensue.]
So, skipping over "Deep Impact", I sat down down and watched
"Clockwatchers", one of those low-budget indies (it has to be since
Parker Posey is in it; before I'd use Steve Buscemi as the litmus test
appears, but now that he's appeared in the other big comet/meteor
movie, "Armageddon", this assay method is now in doubt).  This is a
neat film, very fun, especially in the first hour or so.  Basically,
it's the story of four 20-something temps working in a depressing
office.
The central character is Iris starts off the movie as a shy observer,
watching her fellow temps go about trying to kill time, meet men, etc.
In many cases, they're just going through life's motions: one of them
is getting married to someone who apparently just gives her expensive
gifts, a second claims to be an actress, though nothing apparently
comes from her auditions, and the third is there trying to get a
permanent job.  This third one, played by Parker Posey, verbalizes the
existential doubts they all seem to have: as a temp, they can vanish
and no one would notice or care.  Her quest for a permanent job, or at
very least a recommendation, is her desire to leave a mark in the
world.
Things take a darker turn when the job she'd been gunning for,
executive assistant, is given to a mousy new hire.  At the same time,
someone starts stealing things from the office -- paperweights, books,
the personal effects people have to decorate their cubicles, a very
special ball of rubberbands -- and suspicion falls automatically on the
temps.  As pressure mounts on them, as they're put under more careful
scrutiny, the work friendships they had formed shows cracks.
I don't find the film to be, say, a critique of the modern American
workplace, though it shows a lot of the absurd little things that
happen in offices.  It's not Dilbert.  Rather, the idea of people
existing in a void, unconnected in any meaningful way and going through
the motions of life, is its main theme, and the vagaries and darknesses
of the modern American workplace is simply the most opportune setting
for this existential limbo.  The office is where people look for deep
connections in this significant social space and fail to find it; for
this film the particulars of unconnectedness are distilled into these
temps.
Anyway, "Clockwatchers" is a good movie, very funny in parts.
Currently, it's on one of the cable movie channels this month.
Later, I turned on CNN, and notice that the Yankees had won.  I suppose
it was a good game.
