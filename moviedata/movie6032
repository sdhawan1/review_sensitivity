Cast: Glenn Ford, Shirley MacLaine, Leslie Nielsen
This movie is a combination of comedy and drama. Jason Sweet comes to
a small town in the wild west, Powder Valley.  Within half an hour,
he has gotten to know young Dell Payton (Shirley MacLaine), he has
bought an excellent horse for only $40 and beaten up the toughest
cowboy in the town, Jumbo (Mickey Shaugnessy). After that, he tells
the people in the town why he has come: he is a sheep farmer going
to setttle down in the town. The grazing rights are open to everybody
but sofar nobody has dared to bring sheep to a town ruled by cattle
ranchers who are afraid that sheep and cattle won't mix.
One of the ruling cattle rancers is his old partner Johnny Bledsoe.
They haven't seen each other since they became enemies. Bledsoe now
calls himself Colonel Bedford and has kept his old life a secret in
order to be able to romance Dell Payton.
So far as I can remember, I have never seen a Glenn Ford movie (where
he has gotten principal credits) who has disappointed me. He has done
all kinds of movies: film noir as in The Big Heat (1953), comedy as
in The Gazebo (1959) and drama, The Blackboard Jungle (1955) but in
general he is playing the same kind of character in his movies, the
calm and collected everyday-hero, showing courage under pressure.
Playing a cowboy who beats up people might be an exception, a
middle-class civil servant is his kind of characters. It was during
these years, the end of the 1950s his career peaked. None of the
main characters, Ford, MacLaine or Leslie Nielsen are doing
something special, but I notice the supporting characters: Mickey
Shaughnessy as Jumbo is doing a great job.
