     Let's say you want to make money, I mean make a movie.  First, you
acquire the rights to a kids' TV show which was popular in the 60s,
"Flipper."  Next you line up a sure fire and likable star, Paul Hogan
from CROCODILE DUNDEE fame.  You get a known child actor, Elijah Wood
(AVALON, RADIO FLYER, THE ADVENTURES OF HUCK FINN, THE WAR and NORTH).
Finally, your piece de resistance is the show will feature an animal so
naturally charming that surely riches must yours for the taking.
     Well, it's not that easy.  If you get a lame script from an fairly
inexperienced screenwriter (Alan Shapiro), and a similarly
inexperienced director (also Alan Shapiro) who is unable to breathe any
life into the film, all of your other good ideas will be nullified.
This show has such little energy it may put you to sleep.  Count
yourself extremely fortunate if this happens.
     The setup for the plot is that Uncle Porter (Paul Hogan) is being
paid by his sister to keep his 14 year old nephew Sandy Ricks (Elijah
Wood) for the summer.  Uncle Porter lives in a fishing village that is
going broke because a bad guy, Dirk Moran (Jonathan Banks), is dumping
toxic waste into the waters nearby.  Sandy finds an adorable dolphin
which he names Flipper.  Flipper becomes attached to him and follows
him around.  The film is pure formula from beginning to end.
     The script attempts both physical and verbal humor and both fall
flat.  An example of the visual jokes is the way Uncle Porter makes
toast which is by pushing white bread onto a nail in a metal wall and
then using a blow torch to create instant toast.  It sounds funnier
that it is on the screen.  A gross piece of humor is that Sandy throws
up all over himself, but never gets around to putting on a clean shirt.
I am talking caked on vomit a half inch thick which completely covers
the front of the shirt.
     Since the uncle smokes big cigars, Sandy tries them as well.  His
uncle lets him do this until he gets sick.  I think it makes underage
smoking look cool if you are macho enough not to get sick, which is the
wrong message to give to the film's intended audience.  The language is
silly, but at least it is clean.  A typical insult is when Uncle Porter
calls someone a "butt faced wombat."
     The script has a few nice lines.  Uncle Porter warns Sandy,
"You're going to have to use your brain which is going to hurt because
it's the weakest muscle in your body."  Another is when Dirk threatens
Porter with "I ought to teach you a lesson."  Porter retorts, "I'd like
that.  I have a thirst for knowledge; teach me."
     To make sure the audience understand how evil Dirk is, they have
him shoot dolphins with a high powered rifle from his boat, which is
called Bounty Hunter.  Similarly, to remind the audience how in awe
they should be of the dolphins, the cinematographer (Bill Butler) uses
lots of orange filters to give the jumping dolphins a mystical look.
     The acting is pretty awful.  Paul Hogan does not play Uncle
Porter.  Instead he delivers a weak rendition of the old Paul Hogan.
Think of it as Paul Hogan with most of his life blood sucked out as if
there was a vampire picture being filmed on the next lot.  Elijah
Wood's performance is so detached it is like an out-of-body experience.
Only Flipper seems up to his assignment, but he is not given much
interesting to do.  Tossing a soda can from off screen, does not a
moving performance make.  Jessica Wesson (MILK MONEY and CASPER) plays
Sandy's friend Kim.  If they had done something with this romantic
angle it might have been a refreshing change of pace, but it is never
developed much.
     FLIPPER runs 1:35.  It is rated PG and nothing offensive happens.
There is no sex, nudity, bad language, and little violence.  My easy to
please son Jeffrey (age 7) gives film a thumbs up, but only for kids 5
and up.  He feels like the attack by Scar, the hammer head shark, may
scare little kids.  I'm glad Jeffrey liked the show, but I hated it.  I
am still amazed that they could take such a likable star as Flipper and
make such an inanimate movie.  A big thumbs down from me and a rating
of a single *.

     We lasted thirty minutes in this one.  FLIPPER is what I call a
"cinematic black hole," a film so utterly flat-- so completely non-
compelling-- that almost nothing escapes from the screen for the
audience to connect with.  As a teenager spending the summer with his
Florida fisherman uncle, Elijah Wood (THE WAR) is a comatose kid
walking.  He speaks without a hint of inflection in his voice and barely
animates the muscles in his face.  What, was he afraid to outperform the
fish?  Or did he learn a little too much from his WAR co-star Kevin
Costner?  Paul Hogan isn't much better.  The Aussie actor displays
about, oh, one-tenth of the screen charisma that he brought to the role
of "Crocodile" Dundee.  The minimalist plot has something to do with a
dolphin, a hurricane, and a Red Hot Chili Peppers concert.  Oh yeah, and
we heard the word "dioxin" mentioned.  For those kids who have never
seen underwater footage nor visited an aquarium nor vacationed at Sea
World, FLIPPER might be worth a watch.  As for the rest of the western
world... well, I can't think of a single reason to sit through this
movie.

"I've lost all of my baby fat, but I'm still cute, so love me anyway.'
It must be hard for any child star (Wood) to enter that difficult period
of our lives known as adolescence. The teenage years are hard enough as
it is without the unnecessary attentions of fame and fortune, too easily
endowed on anyone who can help Â‘Hollywood' earn a quick buck.
Turn on 'Water Music' meditate on dolphins, and watch your blood
pressure drop to safe limits. Out with the anti-hypertensive medication,
and in with 'Flipper'. This dolphin befriends a lonely, angry young boy,
detects bins of chemical wastes underwater, and cons children out of
free fish and pocket money. Now where can I find myself a pet fish like
this? (Ooops, I mean mammal).
Where we live the sun always shines, the surf is always blue, the
natives are always friendly, and Uncle Porter's (Hogan) speciality is
'toast ala welding torch'. Ahhh, sounds like a good place to retire.
Fresh air, the sound of the sea, endless summer, and don't forget the
sun tan lotion.
So come join 'Flipper' in yet another adventure where he battles the bad
guys of the sea. The environmentally unfriendly fisherman who shoots
dolphins and poisons the ocean floors; the giant hammerhead shark who
has an acquired taste for seagulls and little boys. At the end of the
day I didn't really enjoy the movie, but it did remind me of a much
needed holiday.
Comment: Not 'Waterworld', but certainly more intelligent.

     Saving dolphins is good.  Dumping toxic waste in the ocean is bad.  
Those are the two fundamental messages hammered home by the latest 
lamebrained incarnation of FLIPPER, a movie that has a lot of good 
intentions, but very little else.  This most recent in the series of 
neverending variations on the LASSIE storyline might serve as adequate 
entertainment for undiscriminating children, but, for adults, it's a 
gargantuan waste of time and money.  
     Once, when CROCODILE DUNDEE topped the box office charts, Paul 
Hogan was as hot as could be.  Now, ten years and several failed 
pictures later, his star has fallen so far that the best he can do is 
play second fiddle to a dolphin.  Unhappily for the Australian star, his 
performance here isn't likely to appreciably increase his stock.  
FLIPPER is bad, and Hogan certainly doesn't redeem the film.
     Based on the 1963 movie which spawned a television series, FLIPPER 
has all the formula ingredients that saturate '90s family films.  It's a 
cloying mixture that threatens a cuteness overdose.  There isn't a 
moment of originality in this movie, which follows a routine path from 
start to finish.  Like the whale in the far better FREE WILLY, the 
animal steals the show.  
     Unfortunately, Flipper doesn't have a whole lot to do except swim 
around and execute leaps.  The two-legged landlubbers get most of the 
screen time, and they're pretty uninteresting.  There's Sandy Ricks 
(NORTH's Elijah Wood), the son of a broken marriage who's sent to spend 
a summer in the Florida Keys living with his uncle, Porter (Hogan).  
Initially, the two don't get along well -- Sandy is surly and doesn't 
take kindly to his uncle's lessons of responsibility.  Then Flipper 
shows up, giving Sandy something to care about other than himself.  The 
dolphin also gets him a girlfriend and helps uncover the dastardly deep 
sea waste dumping of a nasty fisherman (Jonathan Banks).
     About the only worthwhile thing FLIPPER offers is some decent 
underwater photography, but those in search of these kinds of marine 
views would do better checking out a National Geographic special on PBS.  
The film is intended to appeal to the under-12 crowd, but I have a hard 
time recommending it even for them.  FLIPPER is calculated, market-
driven entertainment -- recycled formulas staking out the early summer 
family film niche in hopes of making money.  With better children's fare 
on the way, including the inevitable new animated feature from Disney, 
it's a good idea to throw this one back.
