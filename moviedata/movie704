Barry Levinson can safely be called "the master of Baltimore cinema". He has
done exceptional work in the past focusing on this city, from "Tin Men" to
"Avalon" to "Diner". And he has also been able to bring this sixth sense to the
small screen with the mesmerizing "Homicide: Life on the Streets". It's no
wonder Levinson has written and directed yet another film to his recognized
collection. 
"Liberty Heights" follows two generations of an average Jewish family living in
Liberty Heights, Baltimore in the 1950's. The family faces racism and rejection
at the local swimming pool, in the court house, and by the police. The
nostalgia presented is a terrifying look at how are society was function less
than half a century ago. The film contains some hilarious and some heart
wrenching scenes but over length seriously hurts the mood and nothing big
happens to keep the audience truly entertained and attentive. It plays like an
episode of a dramedy television show-however it is like the episode before the
finale, where everything is built up very specifically but nothing huge comes
out of it because it will be shown in the finale next week. However, this is a
movie. There are no episodes and therefore the plot must not only be developed
but something must come out of this development. In "Liberty Heights" there is
no distinct climax.  
The film is broken up into three sections, following three members of the
family. The father, Nate, (Joe Mantegna) runs a strip joint which is not
drawing profits from its desired range of customers. In order to change the
gloomy future of his failing business, Nate decides to add gambling for his
customers to enjoy. This plan, however, backfires when an unemployed man wins
five hundred thousand dollars and Nate is unable to pay. This section of the
movie was the least developed and seemed out of place from the other teen
romance subplots. If Levinson was trying to make the film about the Jewish
family as a whole, then why did he leave out a section focusing on the mother
(Bebe Neuwirth) and her interaction with society? Instead Neuwirth is an
automaton who's only purpose in the film is to comfort or scold the male family
members when they are misbehaving or troubled. 
The oldest son, played by Adrien Brody, is seriously in love with a girl he is
not supposed to go near. After he and his friends sneak into a non-Jewish
party, Brody is swept away by a mysterious girl who he soon after cannot stop
thinking of. This story, at first starts out very vibrant and vivacious, but as
it drags on there are no surprises to maintain interest. Brody is excellent in
another wonderful performance, but the supporting cast is very cliched and
dull. 
Ben Foster plays the youngest son fittingly named Ben. This is the most
interesting of the three stories because it is funny, tragic, and romantic
without one of these elements dominating the others. Ben is a curious boy who
wonders what the world is like outside of the Jewish community. This curiosity
leads to a forbidden friendship with an African American girl played superbly
by Rebekah Johnson. Together they learn more about each other and about
themselves. Racism plays an important role in this subplot as the characters
must fight against it in order to remain bonded. A powerful message is given by
Levinson stating that the youngest generation is the most open- minded and the
most mature. One obvious problem is that Levinson, out of nowhere, adds a
completely unnecessary scene containing, you guessed it, bodily fluids. Is this
a requirement now for films in the 90's? You know there is a serious problem
when a film trying to explain the seriousness of discrimination adds a scene
which can be directly compared to a scene in "There's Something About Mary."
Levinson's most recent film contains many superb performances and an important
story line which educates the audience. There were just too many scenes with no
importance and too many characters with no importance. If Levinson had cut some
of these scenes and characters out and had focused more on creating a better
ending, then "Liberty Heights" would have been an interesting, entertaining,
educating movie.

(Pete), Justin Chambers (Trey), Carolyn Murphy (Dubbie), Frania 
Rubinek (the Kurtzman's grandmother) James Pickens Jr ( Sylvias's 
father), et al. Produced by Levinson and Paula Weinstein. Released by 
Warners .134 minutes. R (language and suggestions of sex, neither too 
strong).
Never been to Baltimore. What I know about it comes from a sampling 
of TV's "Homicide: Life on the Street" (Barry Levinson was one of the 
executive producers as well as the director of some episodes), and 
mainly from Levinson's movies "Diner," "Tin Men," "Avalon" and now 
"Liberty Heights." But the shot of Baltimore that has stayed with me 
was in Hitchcock's "Marnie." When the kleptomaniac woman visits her 
mother, we get a sight of ships at the end of the street, a barefaced 
phony image (rear projection or whatever) of the kind the Master 
sometimes used to thumb his nose at us.
There are no such reality-defying tricks in "Liberty Heights," where 
Levinson blends both memories and imagination. Nor is the film a 
piece of nostalgia. If anything, it is a effort, and a most 
successful one at that, to evoke a certain time (1945-46), its 
Baltimore Jews, Gentiles and Blacks, anti-Semitism, racism , ethnic 
and class distinctions , and slowly changing attitudes. It's a big 
order, yet the movie may seem deceptively simple.
The film goes in several directions, all integrated  somewhat in the 
manner of a  "bildungsroman," a novel about growth. What does the 
trick is not only Levinson's talent but his strong familiarity with 
the subjects, his big-hearted approach and, within his seriousness, a 
sense of humor. He forsakes both broad comedy and mushiness.
The story centers on a middle-class family in a mostly Jewish suburb. 
Mom is sweet and traditional. Dad owns a burlesque house that by then 
was a vanishing institution. He supplements his income with the 
numbers racket. Younger son Ben is in high school, older son Van in 
college. There are major changes in the nation. TV is making its 
mark. Rock'n roll is in. More importantly, schools have just been 
desegregated.
In Ben's class there is now Sylvia, a charming black girl who must be 
the first Negro (in the parlance of the times) that Ben has ever 
noticed in an era when this big minority was of invisible men and 
women. Ben may have seen Claude Rains in a rerun of "The Invisible 
Man" movie, but he certainly had not read Ralph Ellison's "Invisible 
Man" of 1952. He immediately feels drawn to Sylvia. And he tells his 
mother that he finds her attractive. Mom's reaction "Kill me now!" is 
funny, pathetic and full of meaning.
The two youngsters make friends. The daughter of a wealthy surgeon, 
Sylvia  lives in a beautiful home. She borrows her mother's car to 
drive Ben around, but he must crouch down. Interesting how he has to 
become temporarily an invisible man.
The relationship betwen the two is chaste. In her room Sylvia 
initiates Ben to recordings of black performers. It's a revelation. 
But this comes to an end when her father the doctor catches them. 
Forcefully but calmly he makes plain that his child is not allowed to 
frequent white boys. The sequence is a small gem of acting, 
reactions,  revealing black attitudes, and turning the tables on 
whites.
(Later, there is another revelation for Ben, when, with one of his 
best buddies, he goes to most skillfully reconstructed rock 'n roll 
concert by James Brown. The boys are the only whites in the crowd, 
and they become just as delirious as the public).
In the meantime, when senior brother Van and pals go to an 
all-Gentile Halloween party, they run into anti-Semitism that 
culminates in pugilism. Van also runs into  blonde, high society 
goddess Dubbie. He is smitten as never before.
Levinson has directed his young men with acute realism and a reining 
in of theatrics. The brothers have very strong feelings but keep them 
well-controlled. It is even more notable in the case of Van. Actor 
Adrien Brody bears a strong resemblance to the late French actor 
Charles Denner ("Z," "The Two of Us, "'Landru," "The Man Who Loved 
Women"). Both performers are good at pent-up emotions, but Brody 
never explodes.
The film is one of taboos that were just beginning to go away -- and 
have not yet entirely vanished. It reminds one of the days of Civil 
Rights struggles and may make you feel sad that the then-alliance of 
blacks and Jews later came to an end. But that's a subtext of the 
movie. Its open text, while true to life, is steadily respectful of 
minorities. The Jews, for example, never refer to the blacks as 
"schwartze."  They don't badmouth them, even when the plot adds its 
third element, beyond the Ben-Sylvia and Van -Dubbie twosomes.
That element is the boys' father, Nate, a man who apparently buys a 
new Cadillac every Jewish New Year. Circumstances I will not describe 
lead him to a heavy, ruinous debt toward Little Melvin, a black 
hustler, subsequently to an odd partnership and later yet to some 
thrills. As Nate, Italian-American Joe Mantegna would, on paper, make 
an unlikely Jew, but it is not the case. Casting him may well be a 
sly political way towards integrating ethnicities.
"Liberty Heights" depicts it locales, times and segments of society 
with first-class cinematography, sets, costumes, atmosphere, period 
music and the rest.  If there are any anachronisms, they are minor. 
Its touch is light but not superficial. Its people, young and older, 
speak and act in genuine 50s  fashion. The tempo is a good balance 
between fast and leisurely sections. And the film's length is 
justified by an abundance of  very good touches.

Ben Kurtzman (Ben Foster) and Sylvia (Rebekah Johnson), two innocent
1950s teenagers, listen to records in her room.  As they sit properly on
her shag-carpeted floor, they enjoy some "Negro music," something Ben
has heard little of.  Ben, you see, is Jewish and Sylvia is black, which
disturbs both sets of parents when they find out that their kids like
each other.
But LIBERTY HEIGHTS isn't some heavy romantic tragedy a la "Romeo and
Juliet."  Instead, it's another light-hearted comedy from writer and
director Barry Levinson.  Sure, it's about discrimination in everything
from swimming pools ("No Jews, Dogs Or Coloreds Allowed") to the numbers
racket, but any movie in which a Jew dresses up as Adolf Hitler for
Halloween doesn't expect to be taken too seriously.
After his disastrous SPHERE, Levinson returns to his Jewish roots in
mid-1950s Baltimore, which was also the setting for his best picture
(DINER).  Handsomely filmed and decorated with the best set of Caddies
this side of a museum, LIBERTY HEIGHTS still isn't in the same league as
DINER.  The characters are likable, but their development keeps coming
up short.  When Levinson finally introduces some creative tension in the
story's last act, it feels contrived and awkward.  Nevertheless, the
movie on the whole proves more attractive than the sum of its parts.
Levinson divides the world along sharp racial lines in his story with
the Jews referring to the Gentiles as "the other kind."  A typically
funny scene has Ben over to a blindingly "white" kitchen for lunch.  One
of his friend's very white mother, dressed in white, serves him a
sandwich composed of white luncheon meat, white mayo and white bread.
Overcome with all of this whiteness, he can't eat.
Ben's father (Joe Mantegna) has his own set of problems.  His strip
joint, called a burlesque house back then, isn't making enough money to
camouflage his real business, a lucrative numbers racket.  He's also
worried that his newest stripper might actually take all her clothes off
and get him arrested.
Most of the film's jokes don't amount to much with ones about the size
of male private parts being prominent.  Sporadically the dialog does hit
pay dirt with wise and witty observations about sex ("Dream gals were
invented by God to tease the apparatus.") and racism ("It's okay to have
a Jewish guy hanging over the bed, just not coming in the front door.").
"Life is made of a few big moments and a lot of little ones," Ben
explains in voice-over.  Levinson's movies like DINER, TIN MEN and
AVALON celebrate the little ones.  And LIBERTY HEIGHTS is an attractive,
albeit modest, addition to the Levinson collection.
LIBERTY HEIGHTS runs 2:07.  It is rated R for some sexual situations,
profanity and drinking.  An innocent picture that is on the mild side of
most PG-13 movies, it would be fine for kids around 12 and up.

_Liberty_Heights_ (R) *** (out of ****)
_Liberty_Heights_, writer-director Barry Levinson's fourth cinematic ode
to his hometown of Baltimore, plays like a memory, and with that
description comes everything it entails.  While a work of great affection
for the time and place it so painstakingly recreates, the film also
suffers from a problem not unlike one described by the narrator at the
film's end: the images in his memory are not always as sharp as he'd like
them to be.  Similarly, the meandering focus of Levinson's script isn't
quite as sharp as it should be, but there is nothing muddled about the
warm feelings the film strongly evokes.
_Liberty_Heights_ takes its name from a Jewish neighborhood in 1954
Baltimore, the setting for the coming-of-age stories of brothers Ben (Ben
Foster) and Van (Adrien Brody).  University student Van's storyline
follows his attraction to a blonde gentile beauty (Carolyn Murphy) who,
unbeknownst to him, is the girlfriend of his rich preppie buddy Trey
(Justin Chambers).  The more interesting thread belongs to high schooler
Ben, who falls for Sylvia (Rebekah Johnson), a fetching young lady who
shares his homeroom.  The complication, however, is that she's
African-American.
Speaking in terms of plot, there is not much at all to either of these
storylines.  But on these thin threads, Levinson hangs a number of
smaller details that lend the film its beguiling and universal flavor. 
While the stories are told from a Jewish perspective circa the mid-1950s,
anyone can relate to the awkwardness and bliss of first love; the pursuit
of that love in the face of adversity, societal or otherwise; the
challenging of stereotypes; and living through a time of sweeping social
change.  The likable cast, in particular Foster and Johnson, make it even
easier to get involved in the proceedings.
Unfortunately, however, _Liberty_Heights_ is not entirely a
coming-of-age of youth, but that of an entire family.  In addition to the
stories of Ben and Van, the other prominent plot thread involves their
father (Joe Mantegna), a burlesque house owner and numbers racketeer who
finds both of his businesses being irreversibly affected by the changing
times.  This thread, which also comes to involve an errant drug dealer
(Orlando Jones), never feels quite of a piece with the gentler youth
stories, and the (inevitable) convergence with Ben's storyline feels
forced.
Levinson obviously enjoys remembering the times of his youth, and like
people often do while reminiscing, he loses track of time.  At 120
minutes, _Liberty_Heights_ is overlong by at least 20 minutes, its energy
dissipating and ultimately completely draining by the time the final
credits start rolling.  But what  remains strong as ever by that point is
the wistful emotion the film evokes, the bittersweet affection that comes
with looking back at an era that was, for better and worse, much simpler.

     As Barry Levinson looks at the Baltimore of his youth, in each
successive film things get more serious.  In DINER there was a small
group of guys who were friends.  In TIN MEN we see that there were also
the more serious types who had to earn a living.  AVALON told us that
these people we are talking about are immigrant Jews who have to
struggle to make the American thing work for them.  In LIBERTY HEIGHTS
we see that the Jews have to interface with other classes, other races,
and other religions.  There are definite tensions in this film as the
diverse groups come in contact with each other, but Levinson is not as
militant as a Spike Lee would be.  His approach is more that of a
peacemaker who sees no villains in the tensions.  His world is
populated with diverse groups who feel uneasy about each other only
pending getting to know each other better.
     The story follows the Kurtzman brothers, Van (played by Adrien
Brody) and Ben (Ben Foster).  They are growing up in the area of
Forrest Park and Liberty Heights in Baltimore.  Their neighborhood is
so overwhelmingly Jewish that growing up Ben had just assumed a Chinese
pupil in his grade school was also Jewish.  Levinson, who wrote as well
as directed, makes some humorous comments about how Jewish and non-
Jewish households are different.  Ben is amazed at how the Christians
seem hung up on the color white, even to the point of eating their
bread raw.  In 1954 Van is in college and Ben in high school, but they
remain somewhat provincial.  At home they learn there are Jews and "the
other kind."  They are getting to the point when they will have to deal
with the other kind.  Their father, Nate Kurtzman (Joe Mantegna), runs
a failing burlesque house as a front for his illegal numbers racket.
Yet in spite of being a criminal, he deals only in a victimless crime
and is a man of honor.
     Van, Ben, and friends are planning to crash a Halloween party put
on by some upper class other kinds.  Bens parents are shocked by his
dressing up as Adolph Hitler.  Ben is told that he will have to stay
home. At the party Van sees a woman, Dubby (Carolyn Murphy), who looks
to him like a vision in white and he is immediately smitten.  But the
presence of uninvited Jews at the party leads to a fight that the other
kind boys are spoiling for.
     Meanwhile, Ben is also getting interested in a girl of the other
kind.  But in this case it is another kind of other kind.  He is
intrigued by Sylvia (Rebekah Johnson) the one black girl in his class.
He strikes up a secret friendship with her.  He finds the black
community has their own comedians as well as their own music, but he
quickly develops a taste for both.  A third though less well-developed
line of plot follows their fathers financial problems when the numbers
racket proves to be less than profitable for him and when he finds
himself owing a great deal of money to a small-time drug dealer, Little
Melvin (Orlando Jones).  Nice little personal touches characterize
Nate.  He dresses like a very successful man and always drives the
latest model of Cadillac, even after one stroke of bad luck threatens
to leave him nearly destitute.  He practices his ballroom dancing in
their semi-finished basement with his wife Ada (Bebe Neuwirth).
     As usual, Levinson gets convincing acting from his cast.  But
somehow neither Mantegna nor Neuwirth seem very Jewish.  And neither
has the angular face that the Brody or Foster has, making the family a
little less believable.  It has been claimed that stage comics make
very good actors and so it should not be surprising that Orlando Jones,
formerly of MAD TV, has a great deal of stage presence.  Perhaps
Levinson should have increased the size of his role.
     Levinson ties his series together with touches running though most
of his series.  Once again the main characters hang out in the Fells
Point Diner.  At the diner or elsewhere some of the best conversation
(and much of the comic dialog) is around the table and over a meal.
Levinson repeats the image of handsome women on horseback which he
previously used in DINER.
     Through the film Levinson sustains the 1950s feel though he
overuses the device of wall-to-wall 1950s music.  Chris Doyle's
camerawork could have done the job by itself without so artificial a
device.  Also there are a few anachronisms notable.  There is a
reference to watching Perry Mason which would not debut until 1957.  It
also looks like Hitchcock's 1951 STRANGERS ON A TRAIN is being
broadcast to television on in 1954, which seems highly unlikely.
     LIBERTY HEIGHTS was for me not quite the film that AVALON was.
Some people are a little too unrealistically nice in this film.  There
is nothing in this film that matches the scope of that one or the
tender relationship between the Aiden Quinn character and his son in
AVALON.  I would give it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to
+4 scale.

Aside from making occasionally intelligent crowd-pleasers such as
Sphere, Wag the Dog and Rain Man, Barry Levinson also directed four
lesser-known films known as his "Baltimore movies," all of them
focusing on the life of Jewish people in 50s Baltimore. Those films --
Diner, Tin Men, Avalon and now Liberty Heights -- have all been met
with critical plaudits but little in terms of box-office; what allowed
Levinson to keep making them was his respected Hollywood stature. I'm
sure he called on some favors to get some of these movies financed. But
while the 3rd film, Avalon, was clearly not a populist movie, the
influence of the profit-minded studios has taken its toll on Liberty
Heights; it tries too hard to attract an audience by pitching itself to
the lowest common denominator.
Despite a colorful assortment of supporting characters, the film's main
focus is Ben and Van Kurtzman (Ben Foster and Adrian Brody,
respectively), two Jewish teens struggling with the prejudices that
plague Baltimore in the 1950s. They struggle desperately to fit in,
going to non-Jewish parties where they are not welcome, doing
everything they can not to reveal their nationality. The prejudices
against them have made their parents prejudiced; when Ben says that he
finds a "colored" girl attractive, his mom (Bebe Neuwirth)
exclaims "Just kill me now!"
Ben does indeed develop a relationship with a colored girl and Van
falls hard for a gorgeous, Cinderella-white Christian girl, who also
happens to be going out with a (thankfully) benevolent Christian guy
(Justin Chambers) who decides to help Van out. Meanwhile Ben and Van's
father, who run an illegal gambling operation, get into money trouble
with small-time drug dealer Little Melvin, who might just go on the
offensive against the Kurtzman family should he not get his money on
time.
There is a riotous scene in the beginning of the movie where Ben
decides to dress like Hitler for Halloween. His mom flips and calls his
father, who adamantly tells her that Ben shall not go out like that,
and asks to "speak to the Fuhrer." Ben's mom gives him the phone and he
begins with a distinctive "Jaaaaaaaa?" Well, you had to be there. The
scene is hilarious, and I was only hoping the film would continue with
that sort of witty, intelligent humor, but no such luck: it soon
deteriorates into potty jokes American Pie style, obviously inserted to
attract the young crowd that may not otherwise be interested in a movie
about race relations 45 years ago.
Beyond the often immature facade is hidden a touching, good-hearted
movie about growing up, being different and having a cosmopolitan
attitude towards people. It ain't deep stuff, but it's heartfelt,
sincere and, despite the touchy subject matter, often sweet. It's about
the people more than it's about the situations they're in; we're
supposed to watch the characters' reactions rather than analyze their
surroundings.
The performances are solid across the board; no Oscar contenders here,
but some enjoyable turns from some good actors. Joe Mantegna is
typically good as Ben and Van's troubled father. He isn't as lively,
perhaps, as he is in some of his other performances, but then again
he's hardly supposed to be. Adrian Brody probably isn't the best actor
for his role -- I'd kill to see, say, David Krumholtz (who plays
Brody's clutzy friend) take the part instead. The highlight of the
performances is relative newcomer Ben Foster, who bites into his role
with humorous, irreverent gusto (I love that word!).
I enjoyed the movie, dirty jokes and all, though I couldn't help
thinking that, in this case, less is more. Levinson has the basic idea,
now he has to parrot down: cut the potty humor, add more genuine wit
and tell the studio executives insisting on material that would entice
teens to go screw themselves.

A warm fuzzy film with a touch of blues for realism. Great script,
beautifully shot, and nicely acted. I especially enjoyed the quirky
friendship between the confident older Jewish brother and the rich daredevil
James-Dean-type gentile.
But there's other interesting story lines of equal importance including the
younger Jewish brother and the well-to-do "colored" girl from school. "Hi,
I'm Ben, I'm in your homeroom."
Set in 1954, the film holds true to the period.

   One of the miracles of the movies is that they can take us
to unfamiliar places, locations and states of mind that we
would not be able to reach under our own power.  Yet you
can't deny that there's a comfort to watching films about
neighborhoods with which we're familiar and people who look,
think and act mostly like us.  "Liberty Heights" is particularly
appealing to me for this latter reason, displaying
performances by people who came of age at the time I did
and belong to the religious faith with which I identify.  In my
Brooklyn community of Borough Park, everyone was Jewish,
or, everyone except Jo Jo Carlino who lived across the street
and who acknowledged that he hung out only with Jewish
kids.  Though we might never circumnavigate the globe,
every guy suffered the embarrassment of the bris early on
and every kid suffered bar mitzvah lessons at the appropriate
age.  No wonder I could look at "Liberty Heights" and remark,
"Hey, that's me up there on the screen!" 
   Barry Levinson, best known for his series of movies about
growing up in Baltimore, now presents the fourth in that
progression.  Few other directors can match Levinson's feel
for the grit and humor and pathos of medium-sized
metropolises that have none of the plastic ambiance of L.A. 
Nor can most others compete with his affection for the flawed
residents of these areas.  His "Diner" was about young
people hanging around with one another, but "Liberty
Heights" has an added dimension, a greater resonance. 
Most people who did not live through the period think of the
fifties era of this movie as the dull decade, embracing an
America that needed the sort of liberation granted to it by the
characters David and Jennifer in Gary Ross's"Pleasantville." 
Looked as a safe and secure but altogether hokey Father
Knows Best/Ozzie-and-Harriet period, the fifties were actually
a prelude to the more dramatic and often violent civil rights
movement of the sixties, all brought to a vehement head by
the Vietnam War (memorialized in Levinson's "Good Morning,
Vietnam").  The Supreme Court decision in 1954 calling for
the integration of all public schools may not have succeeded
to this day in combining the races in the field of education,
but it was the foot in the door that got many people of diverse
races, religions and ethnic groups out of their enclaves to
make the first gingerly steps toward mixing and getting to
know one another.
   In 1954 Levinson was twenty-two, just a few years older
than the folks he focuses upon in "Liberty Heights."  As the
film's editor, Stu Linder, keenly binds together several
divergent scenes, moving back and forth and yet always
clearly showing the relationships of the people photographed
by Chris Doyle, we look in on the lives of some Jewish kids
who hang out, speculating as persons their age have always
done about young women, and making the first steps toward
learning about those of other cultures.  Traveling to Europe
and cross-country was not yet in fashion, so to the
Kurtzmans who lived in the Liberty Heights section of
Baltimore, the whole world was Jewish.  
   Levinson sets the comic tone for the piece with a
succession of shticks before settling into a deeper, though
generally light tone.  We are introduced to the provincial
Bubby of the family, Rose (Frania Rubinek), parents Ada and
Nate Kurtzman (Bebe Neuwirth and Joe Mantegna) and to
their children Van (Adrien Brody) and Ben (Ben Foster).  Ada
indoctrinates her kids that gentiles are "the other kind,"
allowing us to make obvious inferences that "the other kind"
must refer to Jews as "the other kind" as well. In fact the
youngsters soon take note of the outside world when they
see a sign on a country club fence just outside their
neighborhood, "No Jews, Dogs or Colored Allowed."  When
the fellas attend a Halloween party in the other section of
town, Van is fascinated by his view of "shiksa goddess,"
Dubbie (Carolyn Murphy) dressed in a Cinderella costume. 
Through an unusual, somewhat contrived turn of events,
Dubbie's WASP boy friend, Trey (Justin Chambers), sets the
stage for the two to meet and date.  But the more fascinating
tale involves the tentative courtship of Ben with the first black
student he had seen in his classes, Sylvia (Rebekah
Johnson), a young woman who defies all of Ben's
stereotypical attitudes toward "Negroes."  
   In a separate development of this interwoven yet
wonderfully linked story, Van and Ben's dad, Nate, is affected
by the changes of the fifties in a more lamentable way. 
Burlesque is dying out.  The strip-tease house he owns is
going under and what's more, the numbers racket that he
controls suffers a cataclysmic loss that threatens the entire
future of his family, as Little Melvin (Orlando Jones) is about
to take over the remainder of Nate's livelihood.
   "Liberty Heights" stands out not only because of its
uncanny ability to capture a turning point in America's social
history but because Levinson, aided by ace cameraman
Doyle, captures some sensational scenery: a full house
attending a Rosh Hashanah service in the neighborhood
synagogue featuring the mellifluous tones of a Baltimore
cantor; a rollicking concert in the local theater featuring soul
idol James Brown (Carlton J. Smith), which introduces Ben
and his friend Sheldon (Evan Newman) to stirring music with
which they had no familiarity; even a terrific strip-tease on the
stage of Nate's burlesque house highlighting an exotic dancer
who goes further than her boss would have liked her to go.
   The fifties are shown as a time that a mere conversation
between a white boy and a black girl could be a topic of
gossip, and any fraternizing between the races would be the
subject of chastisement by unliberated parents of both
groups.  For all his education, even Sylvia's dad, a
prosperous physician, is horrified by the thought that his
daughter invites a young white man to his home simply to
listen to records.  
   Andrea Morricone's score of 40 the great popular songs of
the era punctuates on-target performances by rising star
Adrien Brody (who took on an altogether more sinister role in
Richard Shepard's not-to-be-missed "Oxygen") and a
terrifically believable chemistry between Rebekah Johnson
and Ben Foster as the daring duo of inter-racial friendship. 
David Krumholtz as Yussel, another of the Kurtzmans'
friends, pumps up the humor, particularly when he attends a
WASP party with bleached-blond hair and cons a gentile girl
into thinking that his father and mother, from Norway and
Denmark, met and married in Sweden.  "Liberty Heights" is
an all-around rollicking piece of entertainment.

Liberty Heights, Barry Levinson's fourth Baltimore-based film (following 
Diner, Tin Men and Avalon), is not only one of the director's stronger 
works but one of the best films of 1999.
It is 1954 and that means McCarthy is on television, the Second World 
War has been over for nine years, schools are being integrated and a 
noise-pollution called "Rock and Roll" is replacing Frank Sinatra in the 
eyes of American youth. In Liberty Heights we see how these changes 
affect the rich panoply of characters that Barry Levinson has created.
Ben (Ben Foster) is a young Jewish teenager who recalls eating at a 
friend's house when he was little and wondering what a "lunch meat" is 
and why everything is "all white." But then Ben makes a startling 
discovery about the non-Jewish population, "the other kind is about 99% 
of the world." During the year that this movie covers, Ben will find 
himself living in the new when he dresses as Adolf Hitler for Halloween; 
becomes friendly with Sylvia (Rebekah Johnson), an African American girl 
in his class and becomes an instant fan of an up-and-coming rock and 
roll artist named James Brown. But not even Ben is a full-fledged 
convert as he refuses to leave a car during a Frank Sinatra song out of 
respect for The Chairmen of the Board. Ben's older brother, Van (Adrien 
Brody), also ventures into the 1950's full force when he develops a 
fierce crush on a blond-over-blue gentile girl at a Halloween party.
Ben and Van's family is soon turned upside down as a conservative 
mother, father and grandmother protest the brothers' ultra-liberal 
actions. Ada (Bebe Neuwirth who gives the most delicious yet small 
performance in a film filled with mouth-watering acting), the boys' 
mother, responds to Ben's attraction to Sylvia by exclaiming "Just kill 
me now!" Nate (Joe Montegna), the boys' honest and moral father (which 
says a lot about a man who runs the local numbers bracket) who drives 
the year's Cadillac, is firm in his position of keeping Ben home so that 
he won't trick-or-treat dressed as the Great Dictator. And the whole 
family goes at it in discussions of how the Bible should be interpreted 
and whether or not McCarthy is on a witch hunt.
Today, people continually grown about the presence of liquor, racism and 
fighting among youth. Liberty Heights offers a refreshing reminder that 
this is nothing new. Van's dream girl carries a booze-filled paper bag, 
Ben's friend Yussel fights for his religion and racially based slander 
is sprinkled all about the 1950's film.
Liberty Heights avoids the heavy drama that most studies of society 
carry and instead offers a light wit that is oftentimes funny. One of 
the more uproarious and memorable scenes centers around Van's curiosity 
of the legal system and his decision to answer "no" when asked to swear 
to the truth. The scene isn't out of place nor does it seem as 
controversial as a similar moment in The People Vs. Larry Flynt; it is a 
moment that is humorous for the purposes of developing Van's character 
and fits in the film with ease.
The movie's exploration of various music forms in the 1950's allows for 
an extraordinary soundtrack. Highlights include James Brown, Tony 
Bennett, Ray Charles, Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Louis Armstrong, 
Perry Como and Frank Sinatra.
Being released in the prime of Best Picture season, Liberty Heights will 
likely find itself under a particularly strong microscope. The first 
question asked by Hollywood tends to be one questioning a film's flaws. 
Well, this critic only discovered one where a reference to the movie 
Marty is made on Halloween, 1954, before the 1955 Best Picture's 
release. Other than that singular nitpicking, Liberty Heights can expect 
smooth sailing down the river from its theatrical release to Oscar night 
to its video release.

LIBERTY HEIGHTS is a coming of age story, a comedic drama about two
brothers growing up Jewish in Baltimore in the mid-1950's.  Against the
tumultuous backdrop of McCarthyism and racial integration, Van (Adrien
Brody) and Ben (Ben Foster) Kurzman, together with their parents, Nate
(Joe Mantegna) and Ada (Bebe Neuwirth) face the daily trials of social,
religious and racial discrimination.
Those familiar with Barry Levinson's other works, such as DINER and TIN
MEN, may find LIBERTY HEIGHTS disappointing.  This picture strives to
project a social consciousness but falls tragically short of the mark
set in 1990 by Levinson's Academy Award-nominated AVALON.  The powerful
subject matter LIBERTY HEIGHTS attempts to address is never fully
pursued, quickly falling away behind a glut of gimmicky coming-of-age
scenes lacking both in sincerity and originality.  At times the
characters are so stereotypical, they border on offensive.
The real weakness of this picture is the dialogue, which is so lacking
in subtlety as to leave nothing for the audience to wonder at.  Even
when the characters do find a finer point to talk about, they just can't
resist beating it over the head with a mallet.  Most of the time,
though, they aren't given this chance.  The younger brother's friend
Sheldon (Evan Neumann), for instance, has few lines that aren't related
to genitalia and fewer still that suggest there may be a human being
behind those words.
Fortunately for audiences, the cast of LIBERTY HEIGHTS delivers a
powerful performance that brings life and compassion to these otherwise
stock characters.  Joe Mantegna is surprisingly believable as
well-meaning racketeer Nate Kurzman, imbuing the role with sensitivity
and charm.  Adrien Brody and Ben Foster are charismatic and compelling
as the two brothers, and Bebe Neuwirth's performance lends a refreshing
vulnerability to the family.  But the real gem here is Rebekah Johnson,
making her feature film debut as Sylvia.  Together with James Pickens,
Jr., who plays Sylvia's father, she creates what may be the film's most
memorable scene as Ben hides out in the bedroom closet.
There are a lot of funny scenes in LIBERTY HEIGHTS and at times the
drama is successful, but overall this movie just doesn't live up to its
aims.  If you're looking for a cute coming of age story, you may enjoy
LIBERTY HEIGHTS.  But if what you want is a compelling social drama, you
may do well to look elsewhere.  I'm giving this one three stars.

Liberty Heights (1999)
Directed by Bartry Levinson
Written by Barry Levinson
Starring Adrien Brody, Joe Mantegna, Ben Foster, Bebe Neuwirth
Barry Levinson can safely be called "the master of Baltimore cinema". He has
done exceptional work in the past focusing on this city, from "Tin Men" to
"Avalon" to "Diner". And he has also been able to bring this sixth sense to the
small screen with the mesmerizing "Homicide: Life on the Streets". It's no
wonder Levinson has written and directed yet another film to his recognized
collection. 
"Liberty Heights" follows two generations of an average Jewish family living in
Liberty Heights, Baltimore in the 1950's. The family faces racism and rejection
at the local swimming pool, in the court house, and by the police. The
nostalgia presented is a terrifying look at how are society was function less
than half a century ago. The film contains some hilarious and some heart
wrenching scenes but over length seriously hurts the mood and nothing big
happens to keep the audience truly entertained and attentive. It plays like an
episode of a dramedy television show-however it is like the episode before the
finale, where everything is built up very specifically but nothing huge comes
out of it because it will be shown in the finale next week. However, this is a
movie. There are no episodes and therefore the plot must not only be developed
but something must come out of this development. In "Liberty Heights" there is
no distinct climax.  
The film is broken up into three sections, following three members of the
family. The father, Nate, (Joe Mantegna) runs a strip joint which is not
drawing profits from its desired range of customers. In order to change the
gloomy future of his failing business, Nate decides to add gambling for his
customers to enjoy. This plan, however, backfires when an unemployed man wins
five hundred thousand dollars and Nate is unable to pay. This section of the
movie was the least developed and seemed out of place from the other teen
romance subplots. If Levinson was trying to make the film about the Jewish
family as a whole, then why did he leave out a section focusing on the mother
(Bebe Neuwirth) and her interaction with society? Instead Neuwirth is an
automaton who's only purpose in the film is to comfort or scold the male family
members when they are misbehaving or troubled. 
The oldest son, played by Adrien Brody, is seriously in love with a girl he is
not supposed to go near. After he and his friends sneak into a non-Jewish
party, Brody is swept away by a mysterious girl who he soon after cannot stop
thinking of. This story, at first starts out very vibrant and vivacious, but as
it drags on there are no surprises to maintain interest. Brody is excellent in
another wonderful performance, but the supporting cast is very cliched and
dull. 
Ben Foster plays the youngest son fittingly named Ben. This is the most
interesting of the three stories because it is funny, tragic, and romantic
without one of these elements dominating the others. Ben is a curious boy who
wonders what the world is like outside of the Jewish community. This curiosity
leads to a forbidden friendship with an African American girl played superbly
by Rebekah Johnson. Together they learn more about each other and about
themselves. Racism plays an important role in this subplot as the characters
must fight against it in order to remain bonded. A powerful message is given by
Levinson stating that the youngest generation is the most open- minded and the
most mature. One obvious problem is that Levinson, out of nowhere, adds a
completely unnecessary scene containing, you guessed it, bodily fluids. Is this
a requirement now for films in the 90's? You know there is a serious problem
when a film trying to explain the seriousness of discrimination adds a scene
which can be directly compared to a scene in "There's Something About Mary."
Levinson's most recent film contains many superb performances and an important
story line which educates the audience. There were just too many scenes with no
importance and too many characters with no importance. If Levinson had cut some
of these scenes and characters out and had focused more on creating a better
ending, then  "Liberty Heights" would have been an interesting, entertaining,
educating movie.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Much like Oliver Stone can't quite seem to get his head out of the 60s,
director Barry Levinson (Wag the Dog) keeps returning to 1950s
Baltimore.  This city and period of time has already served as the
setting for three of his films - Diner, Tin Men and Avalon  not to
mention Levinson's television drama Homicide, although that was set in
present-day Baltimore.  What would make a person focus that much
attention on one specific era?  Who cares?  Between the two directors,
almost a dozen films in as many years that focus on either 50s
Baltimore or the turbulent 60s have been made.  And for the most part,
these movies have been spectacular, combining to win seven Oscars out of
the thirty-two nominations they have received.
While Stone hit a stumbling block with 1993's Heaven & Earth, he
rebounded the following year with Natural Born Killers, perhaps
realizing that it was time for a change.  But not Levinson.  With last
year's debacle Sphere under his belt, he returns to 50s Baltimore for
yet another touching, semi-autobiographical tale of a middle-class
Jewish family.  Oy vey!  Granted, Liberty Heights isn't anywhere near as
malodorous as Sphere, but the film sure ain't no Avalon.
Set in 1954, Heights' central focus is on the Kurtzman family.  They
live in the northwest section of the city, known as Liberty Heights, in
a time marred by both McCarthyism and racism.  The main character is Ben
(Ben Foster), a high school senior who also narrates the film.  He
explains at the film's beginning that his entire neighborhood consisted
of Jews and, as a result, he always assumed as a young boy that the
whole world was Jewish.  His first experience of `the other kind' (as
his mother referred to gentiles) was at a friend's house during an
awkward lunch that consisted of white bread and luncheon meats, both
mysterious foods to the lad.
Heights basically consists of three stories.  The first follows Ben's
blossoming friendship with a black girl named Sylvia (Rebekah Johnson)
in his homeroom class at his recently segregated school.  Both kids know
that a potential romantic relationship would be damned by both of their
families, not to mention society, but they continue to secretly see each
other.
The second story involves Ben's father Nate (Joe Mantegna, The Rat
Pack), who runs numbers as well as a failing burlesque theater
downtown.  Nate is forced to deal with the threat of a state lottery,
which would kill his racketeering business.  He also is forced to do
some creative financing after an up-and-coming dope pusher named Little
Melvin (Orlando Jones, Mad TV) hits his number on a $50 bet.
Heights' third and most unnecessary story concerns Ben's older brother
Van (Adrien Brody, Summer of Sam) as he tries to fit in with the gentile
crowd to win the affections of an icy WASP princess (model Carolyn
Murphy) during a Halloween party.  The girl, Dubbie, already has a
smarmy beau with a penchant for drinking and driving, but Van doesn't
know this until later on in the film.  Levinson makes every gentile seem
just as evil as the English were portrayed in Luc Besson's The
Messenger.
The trials and tribulations of Ben and Nate eventually intertwine toward
the end of the film, which makes Van's seem really pointless.  It also
makes you wonder why the mom didn't have her own storyline.  Since the
film is supposed to be about a Jewish family, it seems weird to exclude
the matriarch.  Instead, she is reduced to yelling at her kids while
bent over at the waist.  The ending, while intended to be an emotional
heart-tugger, is instead a bit empty.
If you take away the linear script (which Levinson also wrote), the rest
of the film is actually quite lovely.  The acting is solid all around.
The music is phenomenal, using equal parts Frank Sinatra, James Brown
and Tom Waits.  The cinematography (Christopher Doyle, Happy Together)
helps to lend a dark, colorful feel to the film, while long-time
Levinson editor Stu Linder expertly chops up Levinson's gorgeous shots
in all of the right places.

        "No Jews, dogs, or coloreds" reads the sign that hangs from the
chain link fence by the entrance to a public lake in the eastern section of
Baltimore in the mid-1950s.  Since dogs can't read, and none of them can
recall ever having seen a colored person sunbathing, this sign must be
strictly for the Jews, yes?  So surmises one of a group of three friends,
three Jewish friends, whose teenage experiences with race, religion, and
prejudice form the center of Barry Levinson's "Liberty Heights."
        It's the fourth nostalgic return to the director's hometown in a
series that has previously included "Diner," "Tin Men," and "Avalon."
While not as consistently well-written as "Diner," nor as bitingly funny as
"Tin Men," "Liberty Heights" is a solid comedy-drama that contains lots of
satisfying little moments rather than any significant big ones.
        If "Diner" could launch the careers of Steve Guttenberg, Paul
Reiser, Kevin Bacon, Daniel Stern, Timothy Daly, and Mickey Rourke, then
who's to say that Adrien Brody and Ben Foster--who play brothers Van and
Ben Kurtzman respectively--don't have a shot at future stardom?
        Brody and Foster are pretty terrific in "Liberty Heights," as are
most of the performers in the film, including Joe Mantegna and Bebe
Neuwirth as their parents.  Mantegna's Nate Kurtzman runs a burlesque house
and a numbers racket on the side and Neuwirth is his loving, supportive
wife.  As for their sons, Ben gets involved with a colored girl, and Van
falls in love with Cinderella with a magic wand, a well-to-do beauty he
meets at a Halloween party.
        There's a lot of wacky and not-so wacky situations spurred along by
Levinson's characteristically-incisive writing and ear for quotable
dialogue.  Notably strong is the relationship between Ben and Sylvia,
especially the staunch loyalty they show each other.  Propelling the story
forward is a varied score by Andrea Morricone, son of the great and
prolific Italian composer Ennio Morricone ("The Good, the Bad, and the
Ugly," "The Mission," "The Legend of 1900") which, every now and again,
reveals touches of his father's brilliance.  Levinson has shown immaculate
taste in bringing him onboard.
        Like Nate's mist green '55 Cadillac, "Liberty Heights" is a
pleasure to behold.  For Levinson and his followers, it only goes to show
you can go home again, and again.

Susan Granger's review of "LIBERTY HEIGHTS" (Warner Bros.)
 Filmmaker Barry Levinson says: "If I knew things would no
longer be, I would have tried to remember better." And this expertly
crafted coming-of-age tale is Levinson's fourth semi-autobiographical
film set in Baltimore - like "Diner," "Tin Men," and "Avalon."
Focusing on the changing times of the mid-1950s, it tackles the
provocative issues of race, religion and class distinction. A wry and
enormously touching remembrance, it spans exactly one year in the life
of an insular, middle-class Jewish family. With segregation coming to
an end, they struggle with the poignant dilemmas evoked by ethnic
diversity. One son finds himself attracted to a young black woman
whose family is as appalled by their friendship as is his own, while
the other son is dazzled by a luminous blue-eyed, blonde gentile who
wields a magic wand, offering him a tantalizing glimpse into a
lifestyle that's a marked contrast to everything he's ever known. Each
boy pursues his passion with a manic edge that's filled with pathos
and amusement. Plus, there's the traumatic upheaval caused by their
father's involvement in staging an illegal lottery that draws the
attention of the F.B.I..  Headed by Joe Mantegna, the superb ensemble
cast features Adrien Brody and Bebe Neuwirth, along with Justin
Chambers, Vincent Guastaferro, Orlando Jones, David Krumholz, and
Kiersten Warren. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Liberty
Heights" is an evocative, nostalgic 8. It's funny, feisty, and full of
life, as laughter and tears mix and mingle, characterizing the human
condition that Barry Levinson captures so deftly. Don't miss it - and
take your parents.

Levinson had cut some of these scenes and characters out and had focused more
on creating a better ending, then "Liberty Heights" would have been an
interesting, entertaining, educating movie.
