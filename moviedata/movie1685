A day after The West Wing ruled the Emmy Awards, Rod Lurie's White House
drama The Contender screened at the Boston Film Festival.  With that
kind of timing, comparisons are unavoidable.  So with The Contender
boasting an intriguing storyline (woman nominated for the Vice
Presidency) and a top-line cast, how is it that I was pining for Martin
Sheen by movie's end?  I blame Lurie, for what I believe to be a true
dud of the fall season.
Lurie is an L.A. film critic-turned-filmmaker who made his debut with
last year's virtually unseen Deterrence, with Kevin Pollak as the
President.  Lurie's back to politics again, and this time it's Jeff
Bridges as Commander-In-Chief, and he'd like to appoint Senator Laine
Hanson (Joan Allen, in a role written especially for her) to the VP
vacancy.  Not so easy.  The Senator has enemies, like Gary Oldman's
Congressman Sheldon Runyon.  His team digs up dirty pictures from
Hanson's youth, and all hell breaks loose for the Senator.
It's not so much fun for us either.  The primary problem is that Lurie
just can't direct.  He rushes and bumps through his somewhat appealing
script in the first half, just so we can get to that naughty photo.  And
with predictable plot points, such as a clumsy, oh-so-secret rendezvous
to pass over the pictures, it seems that Lurie read some book about
moments needed to make a government conspiracy movie.  No wonder the
guy's favorite film is All the President's Men.
And I'm not sure he knows where to place the camera.  Not once do we get
a satisfying wide shot within the Oval Office, or anywhere in the White
House for that matter (don't have that trouble with The West Wing, do
you?).  At one point, he follows Oldman running down a set of stairs
with a jarring, useless Steadicam shot, borrowing from others' styles
with no narrative purpose.
Speaking of narrative, there are problems there too.  Lurie's subject
matter is admirable, but it takes way too long to get from setup to
dénouement.  Much of the screenplay smacks of a trying-too-hard
intensity, and scattered visuals (the Senator jogs through Arlington
National Cemetery -- I get it!) are as heavy-handed as Lurie's obvious
politics.  And although The President's been in office 6˝ years, he's
continually amazed by the variety of food at the White House, ordering a
snack at every opportunity.  Cute once, passable twice, stupid the fifth
time.
What's inexcusable, though, is the hypocrisy in this film.  While Lurie
chides the act of digging up the photo, he revels in its discovery,
showing us a gang-bang snapshot 5 or 6 times.  Later, after his
screenplay smartly supports a politician's right to privacy, and we're
sure Hanson's past is immaterial to her success, the President asks for
lurid details and she tells him!  In my eyes, that cheats the character,
and it's a huge, cowardly cop-out.
On the bright side, Joan Allen continues to be one of this country's
best actors, and she'll probably pull an Oscar nomination for this one. 
She brings such a stoic pride to Hanson that I'd vote for her in a
second.  Oldman, who has spent much of his career overacting, is subdued
and natural as Runyon, and the likable Bridges is just plain goofy.  How
did Lurie get such talent in this picture anyway!?  I figure either most
actors are thrilled to sink their teeth into political issues, or this
guy smooched a lot of butt while reviewing movies in L.A.
Either way, fall will arrive, you'll make your decision on the upcoming
election, and hopefully, you will vote.  And, if hungry for fictional
politics, you should stay home and see what ol' President Bartlett is up
to.

The Vice President of the United States is dead and President Jackson Evans
(Jeff Bridges) is being pressed from all sides to replace the deceased politico.
Governor Jack Hathaway (William Petersen) seems like a shoe-in for the nations
number two spot, especially after he performs a heroic rescue attempt while on a
fishing holiday. But, the president has different plans and unceremoniously
rejects Hathaway in favor of Senator Laine Billings Hanson (Joan Allen), who
could be the first female vice president, ever, in "The Contender."
Writer/director Rod Lurie takes on a subject that is reminiscent of the
political films of the 60's, especially Otto Preminger's "Advise and Consent."
The older film also dealt with a political appointment to a powerful government
post - Henry Fonda vying for the Secretary of State, then, versus Joan Allen
shooting for the VP slot now. The 1962 film was made at the height of the Red
Scare, so the plot revolved around the political morality of right against left,
with a strong, almost preachy, moral message. "The Contender" brings us into the
new millennium with a very different kind of political tale, but with a hint of
the ethics of a bygone era.
Lurie's screenplay cuts right to the chase from the start. Governor Hathaway's
vain but brave attempt to save a young woman from drowning makes him appear to
be the perfect nominee for VP. He's surprised, even shocked, when White House
Chief of Staff Kermit Newman declares that the rescue effort would be compared,
by the public, to Ted Kennedy and Chappaquidic. The president thanks him,
declares the governor "the future of the party," and nearly boots him out of the
Oval Office. Evans says, "I need a VP" and demands that Laine Hanson get the
nomination.
A woman vice president is a hard pill to swallow for those - men - in power.
Newman questions his boss's stubbornly held decision to back Hanson. Even more
formidable, senior Congressman Sheldon Runyon (Gary Oldman), who heads the
committee tasked to investigate the nominee, has his own agenda. Shelly knows,
in his heart, that Hanson is not the right person for the job that is a
heartbeat away from the presidency. He is joined by a freshman congressman,
Reginald Webster (Christian Slater), who is looking to make the right
connections and sees the senior politician as his means to an end. The search
for the dirt that will bury Laine's chances for VP begins in earnest.
Runyon's investigation of Hanson's past uncovers some sordid evidence from her
college days. The photos that come to the surface show a young woman who looks
like Laine performing sex with two men. Even as the photos are entered into the
official records of the committee hearing, they are leaked onto the Internet in
an effort to gain public opposition to Hanson's appointment. Sen. Hanson refuses
to even bother denying the accusations as they are beneath her dignity. As the
committee continues its inquisition of Hanson, Runyon tries to build upon his
accusation of sexual deviance by introducing questions about Laine's positions
on birth control, adultery, abortion and switching political parties. Hanson
maintains her unshakable dignity throughout as the political intrigues build
around her.
It's not just hearings and smutty pictures, though, as Lurie builds his
characters into complex people. Good and bad are not simple concepts and there
is complexity in the minds and hearts of the characters. Actually, the talented
cast puts flesh on the bones of his characters, giving each a nuance that make
them unique individual. This is not a film that draws its images and people in
black and white.
Joan Allen, for the first time in all of her respectable career, is the center
of attention in "The Contender" and she proves her capability as a first rate
actor quite able to control the center stage. Even though there is "proof" of
her sexual indiscretions, Laine maintains her stand on her record, not on
denying some foggy accusations. Allen gives her role the dignity that befits the
honest senator. You know she knows that she has what it takes to do the job, she
just has to get past the sordid side of politics to get that job. Allen is
forceful and dynamic in her performance as a woman who grew up in politics (her
father, played by Philip Baker Hall, is a highly respected ex-governor) and
gained her own respect in the Senate. If anyone is going to break in to the male
dominated Executive Branch, Laine Hanson is the one to do it. There aren't many
"best actress" perfs so far this year. Allen's is one of them.
Allen's fine performance is supplemented by some terrifically effective
supporting characters. Jeff Bridges is a wonderful enigma as the president.
Jackson Evans is in the waning years of his successful, two-term presidency and
is comfortable as can be in his position as world leader. Bridges gives a
relaxed, confident performance and comes across as very presidential, indeed.
Evans is in charge of a smooth running government machine and has the best
running it. The president can even partake in a bit of frivolity as he has a
ongoing challenge to try and stump the White House chef by asking for shark
steak sandwiches or walnut pudding with nary a moment's notice. Bridges also
gives a touch of elegance to the role, especially when decked out in his
splendid custom wardrobe, which I'll get to later.
Gary Oldman, whom I think is one of the great character actors alive today, is
simply superb as the outwardly slimy Sheldon Runyon. The powerful congressman
comes across as unscrupulous in his diligent attacks on Sen. Hanson. But, Oldman
gives Shelly a level of complexity that makes you understand his motivations. He
is not a bad man and his opposition of the nomination is based on firmly held
political convictions. He believes, as he puts it, "this nomination is the
cancer of affirmative action" and this is his motivation in opposing the
president's wishes. Oldman, with some really bad hair and an equally bad
wardrobe, also gives a dead-on Midwestern accent and makes you forget that
you're watching an actor.
Sam Elliot is executive office material as the president's chief of staff. He is
the Greek chorus in the White House and openly opposes his boss on his selection
for VP. But, he is loyal above all and, when the die is cast, he stands firmly
behind President Evans. Christian Slater has a small, pivotal role as the frosh
rep Webster. When we meet the ambitious young man, he aligns himself with
Runyon, looking only for political advancement. As the truth, and Laine's
integrity, comes to the surface, Webster changes and grows to support the
President. It's a nice touch showing a newly elected politician learning the
importance of personal honor.
The first rate production shows artistic imagination. Costuming by Matthew
Jacobsen provides the right tailoring for the president and gives Allen an
elegant look in business suits and evening gowns. Production designer Alexander
Hammond does a beautiful job in recreating the Oval Office and the floor of
Congress. Denis Maloney's crisp lensing adds another plus to the proceedings.
One problem, kind of a big one, with the script is an important development
concerning Governor Hathaway. I won't give it away, but suspension of disbelief
is required of us to accept an out-of-nowhere plot twist. It detracts from the
overall quality of the story. Nonetheless, "The Contender" is a solid political
thriller with old-fashioned concepts packaged in a slick, well-made container. I
give it a B+.

Starring: Joan Allen (Senator Laine Hanson); Gary Oldman (Congressman Shelly 
Runyon); Jeff Bridges (President Jackson Evans); Sam Elliot (Kermit Newman); 
produced by Willi Bar, Marc Frydman, James Spies, Douglas Urbanski; written 
and directed by Rod Lurie. 

Joan Allen stars as Laine Hanson, a democratic senator from Ohio who has been 
selected by President Jackson Evans to fill the vacancy left by the death of 
the vice president. Hanson's a patchwork assemblage of so many politicians in 
Washington today: she's a Harvard graduate; the daughter of a former 
governor; her husband is her top advisor who also has a history of political 
experience; she's every bit as hip and trendy as Hillary Clinton and when she 
speaks she's charismatic and believable. 
We're not immediately provided with the details of Hanson's political ideals, 
just three basic things: she's an atheist, she's pro-choice and she used to 
be a Republican but switched parties a few years ago. Maybe that's enough for 
you to get a sense of her character but I would have liked a little more. 
When the major players begin to discuss why she's been selected as the top VP 
contender and ramble off jargon about how she's not too liberal but not 
conservative enough (and the other fictional politicians she's compared to), 
it seems like a bit of a shortcut. But this is a movie whose characters are 
highly motivated by their image and it's clear what the filmmakers want her 
image to be. Hanson's not made out to be a saint or a revolutionary, she's 
just trying to make a living as a big-shot politician. 
The yin to Hanson's yang is Congressman Shelly Runyon, a fairly conservative 
Republican from Illinois who appears to have a lot of tenure and seniority in 
the political world. He's a codger who doesn't like Hanson because she's 
pretty much the opposite of him in every way. Runyon heads a congressional 
committee who must interview and approve any vice presidential candidate 
before they can be sworn into office. His first choice was the governor of 
Virginia, a Bill Clinton look-a-like who failed to save a woman whose car 
crashed into a river where he happened to be fishing at the time (that scene 
opens the movie). President Evans also likes the governor but is afraid he'll 
be crucified by the committee as another Ted Kennedy. Runyon disagrees and 
will stop at nothing to prevent Hanson from becoming the vice president. 
The first act of the film does an excellent job in setting up all these major 
characters and their motivations. None of them come across as pawns in the 
political circus but as real people with intuition. They're politicians who 
actually seem to care about the issues and how their constituents would want 
them to vote. For example, Christian Slater has a supporting role as a 
freshman congressman who tells President Evans right to his face and in all 
honesty he can't and won't play a political game because it's not in his 
heart. It's a cheesy scene because you know this a movie but at the same time 
it's refreshing to hear this from this type of character in this type of 
movie. Maybe it's one of those scenes thrown in just to impress Academy 
members, but nevertheless it works. 
Around this point is where the film's major conflict comes in. It's a 
shocking revelation at first and thankfully it doesn't become the entire 
focal point of the plot once it's introduced. Runyon somehow manages to dig 
up the dirtiest of dirt of Hanson. It appears our upright citizen is not as 
squeaky-clean as you'd think (a politician with a corrupt past - what are the 
odds of that!?). To be blunt, she was Marilyn Chambers for a bunch of drunken 
frat boys doing the kinds of things to her you'd only see in a hardcore XXX 
porno movie. There's even some ambiguous photographs and witnesses to back it 
up. Things start to snowball for Hanson going from bad to worse mostly 
because she refuses to even respond to these accusations. 
Do we want people serving in the highest level of government who were and 
could possibly still be sexual deviant? 
Those are the kinds of questions Runyon asks aloud during his committee's 
grilling of Hanson. They're fair questions and I'm sure everyone who sees 
this film will have their own answers based on their personal politics. But 
that's not the questions writer and director Rod Lurie wants you to ask. 
Instead, substitute references to "people" with "women" and you've got one of 
the themes of this film. Lurie's depiction of the double standard is 
hard-hitting and provocative. It's an issue that's been on the feminist 
agenda for years (centuries even) and no matter how conservative you are 
you'll at least understand the rationale for trying to eliminate this form of 
hypocrisy. 
However, an even more important theme is at work in "The Contender." It's the 
question the characters never ask - "Does what someone did in the past 
reflect their character today?" It's a similar idea to political views on the 
death penalty but since it's related to sex we comprehend it differently. 
Sometimes we can understand why a person might commit homicide but for most 
normal people it's difficult to understand why someone would want to be 
promiscuous. 
In telling his story Lurie seems to come off as a liberal on the issues, and 
this is likely going to effect your enjoyment of the film. As a storyteller 
he's much more moderate. Runyon isn't made out to be an evil zealot and 
Hanson is far from being an innocent victim. His screenplay does a fine job 
in keeping everything as realistic as possible because anywhere else this 
film would be all about the games politicians play instead of philosophies 
behind the politics. For a rookie he's banged out an impression script and I 
have a feeling the Academy is going to take note of this. 
If there's anything I could fault "The Contender" for it would be the direct 
references to the Monicagate scandal. At one point Hanson admits she voted 
for Clinton's impeachment but uses what will likely become the next "Show me 
the money"-like catchphrase: "Responsible but not guilty." If Lurie wants 
this film to be a show of support for Clinton and a message that the attempt 
to impeachment was unnecessary he should have been more subtle. 
I also take issue with some scenes in which there's a "great speech" made by 
either Hanson or Evans about "The church of democracy" and "traitors among 
us" complete with the sappy orchestra music and intense mood. As much as I 
like the characters and thought the themes were powerful the use of this 
technique seems more like kissing-up to the Academy than honest filmmaking. 
The ending is surprising because a lot of answers are provided. Whether they 
work and whether they were needed at all is certainly open to interpretation. 
Maybe it's a bit too Hollywood in some aspects but the fact it could still be 
surprising after all that has happened is a form of quiet brilliance. 
In glancing over some reviews of this film by professional critics I noticed 
it's either praised mightily or harshly scorned. I am even more surprised to 
see a lot of bashing of this film on the Internet. That just means "The 
Contender" is going to be remembered as a pretty controversial film in the 
ranks of "The Blair Witch Project" and "The Cook, The Thief, His Wife And Her 
Lover" and I think that's exactly what it set out to do.

The Contender (2000)  1 star out of 4. Starring Joan Allen, Gary Oldman,
Jeff Bridges, Christian Slater, Sam Elliott and William Petersen.
Written and directed by Rod Lurie. Rated R.
 It's bad enough that this year's political campaigns are more about
style and sound bytes than substance.
 Now we have "The Contender," a pretentious political pot-boiler that
will do to political movies what "Roller Boogie" did to disco.
 How lame is "The Contender?" Probably the Gore-Bush debates will ignite
more sparks and offer more excitement than this tedious, overblown,
filibuster of a feature.
 Not only that, the movie lacks the courage of its convictions, proving
a lame,  cop-out ending.
 And that is too bad because "The Contender" had potential to be an
interesting examination about morals, the double standard and the
nuts-and-bolts of political machinations.
 Unfortunately, all this was flushed down the toilet to include a stupid
subplot about a governor who goes to extreme lengths to try to reach a
higher office.
 In "The Contender," the vice president has died in office, and now
President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges) must fill his position.
 His nominee is a centrist woman senator, Laine Hanson (Joan Allen). The
opposition is led by a conservative House elder, Rep. Sheldon Runyan
from Illinois (Gary Oldman).
 "The Contender" isn't a movie; it's a boring two-hour-plus civics
lecture. The characters don't speak dialogue, they spout politically
correct slogans guaranteed to warm the cockles of any liberal. It is a
movie overbaked with platitudes and clichés about democracy, the rights
of privacy and the majesty of government.
 Writer-director Rod Lurie has created a ham-fisted, clunky diatribe
that is about as entertaining as reading the "Congressional Record." One
of his biggest problems is the sanctimonious, self-righteousness that
peppers his script. Lurie is as subtle as Roseanne singing `The Star
Spangled Banner.'
 He despises hypocrisy, male chauvinism and zealots - especially
political ones - witch hunts, persecution and McCarthyism. Well, gee,
with the exception perhaps of Jesse Helms, who among us doesn't?
 In fairness, it should be noted that the actors give their all. Allen
is lovely combination of steel and sex as the senator who will not yield
on her principles even if it costs her the vice presidency as well as
her reputation.
 Oldman is not as spontaneous and overripe as he has been in features
such as "Air Force One." Of course, he just can't say his lines. He
fiddles with his hair, and fusses around as if he's primping for a Mr.
Congressman beauty contest.
 Bridges gives a sly performance as a president who acts like a good
ole boy, but in reality is a shrewd player.
 Also featured is Christian Slater as a young congressman with a
conscience - an endangered species.
 No, in this political season the best thing to do is veto "The
Contender." It definitely does not get my vote.

THE CONTENDER
(DreamWorks)
Starring:  Gary Oldman, Joan Allen, Jeff Bridges, Christian Slater,
William Petersen, Sam Elliott.
Screenplay:  Rod Lurie.
Producers:  Marc Frydman, Douglas Urbanski, Willi Baer and James Spies.
Director:  Rod Lurie.
MPAA Rating:  R (profanity, sexual situations, adult themes)
Running Time:  125 minutes.
Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.
     After a decade as a film critic, Rod Lurie has apparently decided
that not only does he really want to direct, he also really wants to be
President. Lurie made his debut behind the camera earlier this year with
DETERRENCE, a political thriller about the President trying to manage an
international crisis while snowbound in Colorado. The Commander-in-Chief
is once again front and center in THE CONTENDER, suggesting that Lurie may
have been missing his calling as a journalist. Instead of aspiring to be
the next John Ford, he may really be aspiring to be the next John
McLaughlin.
     It's clear that Lurie has a lot of interesting things say about
contemporary American politics on a national level. It's equally clear
that he still has a few things to learn about turning those things into
smoothly satisfying film stories. THE CONTENDER is set sometime in the
near future, during the second term of the Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges) 
administration. The sitting Vice President has recently died in office,
leaving Evans with a tough political choice. He wants to name a woman to
the post to secure his legacy, and he wants Ohio Senator Laine Hanson
(Joan Allen) to be that woman. Unfortunately, he faces opposition in the
person of Sheldon Runyon (Gary Oldman), the Congressman who will chair the
confirmation hearings. Runyon is opposed to Hanson's nomination to begin
with, but he finds ammunition for his opposition when evidence appears
suggesting sexual indiscretions from Hanson's youth. And while Runyon
plants the seeds of public suspicion, Hanson refuses to comment on the
issue in any way.
     Questions regarding the pertinence of private life to public service
have certainly been part of the political landscape in recent years,
making THE CONTENDER's subject matter timely food for thought. Lurie
hammers the willingness of politicians to expose every skeleton in an
opponent's closet, and turns Hanson's refusal to comment on the
accusations against her into an expression of contempt for the fact that
the subject has even been raised. Oldman makes for a superb antagonist as
the cutthroat Runyon, whose motivations are always swaying between genuine
conviction that Hanson isn't ready for the job and retribution for earlier
political losses to the President. There are fine moments exploring the
slippery slopes on which politicians walk in order to gain power, none
more effective than a scene in which Hanson -- armed with information that
could allow her to make an effective personal attack on Runyon -- is
forced to decide whether or not to use it. The excruciatingly long silence
in that scene says more about the tension between principle and expedience
than any line of dialogue.
     That's also one of the few moments in THE CONTENDER when Lurie nails
the timing of a scene. Throughout the film, there's a sense that virtually
every scene is about a minute too short, that virtually every character or
sub-plot has been short-changed in some fashion. Crucial relationships --
between Hanson and her father (Philip Baker Hall), a former governor; 
between another potential candidate for the Vice Presidency (William
Petersen) and his ambitious wife -- never develop a rich enough context
for their inclusion to be effective. Hanson herself remains enigmatic
through much of the film, robbing the film of a real protagonist for the
audience to embrace. And Lurie sticks too closely to the insider wheelings
and dealings, never venturing into the realm of public opinion to explore
how scandals affect the public. THE CONTENDER has the scope of an epic
political drama without enough of the detail.
     Fortunately for Lurie, he scores several points for detail with Jeff
Bridges' performance as President Evans. Plenty of actors have essayed
portrayals of American Presidents with an emphasis either on sheer
authoritative presence or flawed humanity. Bridges nails both, switching
from genial charm to icy political determination in the blink of an
eye. He also gets the film's best running joke, as Evans attempts to stump
his kitchen staff with off-beat menu requests. It's a near-perfect piece
of film acting, capturing every one of a modern Chief Executive's many
faces; he even gives a kick to the obligatory climactic preachy-speechy. 
That's the only bit of greatness THE CONTENDER can muster, however; it's
otherwise a merely solid piece of drama. Perhaps next time around, Rod
Lurie will pick up a few lessons from Bridges on putting all the pieces
together around a persuasive ideological core. Such is the stuff of a
great leader, whether behind the camera, or behind the desk in the Oval
Office.

Shannon Patrick Sullivan
Directed by Rod Lurie, from his screenplay. Starring Joan Allen, Gary
Oldman, Jeff Bridges. Running time: 125 minutes. Rated AA for coarse
language by the MFCB. Reviewed on October 28th, 2000.
One of the most pertinent issues to arise out of the Monica Lewinsky
scandal was the question of what information the public has the right to
know about its elected officials. Some argue that personal dealings
reflect strongly on one's ability to serve their office, while others
maintain that public figures should be evaluated solely on the basis of
public performance.
Given the hot-button nature of the subject, it was inevitable that it
would make the transition to Hollywood and the big screen. The first such
film out of the gate is "The Contender", written and directed by Ron
Lurie. Although it is by no means an exact parallel of the Lewinsky
affair, raising some different concerns and ignoring others (would Clinton
have come under such scrutiny if Lewinsky had not been an intern in his
employ, for example?), "The Contender" follows it in broad strokes by
putting a public official on both public and political trial because of
alleged sexual improprieties in her past.
When his vice-president dies midway through his term of office, United
States President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges) finds himself in the
position of having to choose a successor. Jack Hathaway (William L
Petersen) seems the obvious choice, having recently been labelled a hero
by the media for his (failed) effort to save a drowning woman.
Furthermore, Hathaway is a good friend of Evans' Republican nemesis,
Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman), who will chair the House committee charged
with approving Evans' choice. But Evans, determined to put a woman into
the second-most powerful position in the government, opts instead for
Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen), a former Republican now sitting for the
Democrats.
But Hanson's candidacy is threatened when Runyon's investigators uncover
photographs and witnesses suggesting that Hanson was at the center of a
sex orgy while still in college. When Runyon confronts Hanson about the
story during her televised hearings, Hanson refuses to confirm or deny its
veracity, averring that it is none of the committee's -- or the public's
-- business. It soon appears that Evans may have no choice but to bow to
Runyon's wishes by dismissing Hanson and appointing a new
vice-presidential candidate.
The first three-quarters of "The Contender" comprises a terrific political
drama. Lurie puts into play several absorbing issues, from the obvious
questions of whether Hanson's past indiscretions should have any bearing
on her becoming vice-president, to the very role of women in politics. 
Although Lurie's Democratic leanings are hard to overlook, he maintains a
reasonably even hand throughout.
Nonetheless, there has been some controversy in the press that Lurie
edited "The Contender" to demonise Oldman's character. This simply is not
borne out by the movie itself. Shelly Runyon is not a nice man, to be sure
-- he is aggressive, manipulative and, it transpires, something of a
hypocrite. But he is also a man with strong principles, and it appears
that, by and large, he does in fact have the interests of the country at
heart, or at least the interests of the way he believes the United States
should be. In these days when there seems to be a perpetual fire sale on
political belief, as elected officials waver back and forth over the
issues for reasons that have nothing to do with their own opinions (if
they even possess them), it is gratifying to encounter a man who is
willing to stick to his views, even if those views are not necessarily
ones we agree with. Oldman's vision of Runyon as the movie's "one true
patriot" is not merely rhetoric.
Oldman paints such a vivid character in Runyon, though, that he largely
overshadows his fellow castmembers. Despite the complexity of the issues
surrounding them, neither Laine Hanson nor Jackson Evans are particularly
well-conceived individuals, and neither Allen nor Bridges succeed in
overcoming this flaw. Indeed, both characters suffer from the fact that
they are defined by the issues, and the issues alone. They do not seem to
exist in any sort of greater context.
We are never really convinced, for example, that Hanson really is suitable
vice-presidential material. We are told she is, but where is the
proof? Laine is on the defensive almost the entire movie, her
characterisation revealed only in the way she reacts to others. Her
moments of strength are reduced to sound bites. The result is that Allen's
performance feels vague and half-formed. It is good on the surface, but
lacks real depth. Bridges, meanwhile, never finds his stride as President
Evans. He is sometimes buffoonish, sometimes deviously intelligent, and
Bridges never manages to merge these aspects into a consistent
portrayal. Instead of appearing multi-faceted, Evans seems to suffer from
split personalities.
This weakness of character is indicative of the real problem with "The
Contender", which becomes plain in its closing moments. This is a movie
which is happy to raise issues, but shies away from making any real
statements about them beyond the very obvious. After an engrossing ninety
minutes of political intrigue, "The Contender" veers suddenly into prosaic
speechifying and, worse, an inappropriate deux ex machina ending which
sorely undercuts the integrity of the film. True, this plot device allows
Lurie to lend a nice sense of closure to the movie. But it is entirely
artificial; it eschews the powerful themes set up earlier in the film in
favour of a tidy ending.
That said, it is difficult to ignore the potency of "The Contender" as a
whole. I have been harsh on the movie, I admit, because I felt the ending
was such a disappointing kowtow to cinematic convention. But even despite
the mediocre characterisation of some of the leads, "The Contender", for
the vast majority of its running time, makes for engrossing viewing. If a
movie like this gives its audience pause to reconsider their own attitudes
toward their political leaders, that can only be a good thing.

In Washington, duplicity runs deep.  But, in THE CONTENDER, the 
extremely impressive second feature film by writer and director Rod 
Lurie (DETERRENCE), there is at least one politician for whom principles 
are more important than politics, even if her integrity costs her the 
honor of being the nation's first female vice president.  Speaking of 
honors, expect to see this political thriller and morality tale garner 
many well deserved Oscar nominations including, but not limited to, Best 
Actress (Joan Allen) and Best Supporting Actor (Gary Oldman).
Ohio Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen) is a Republican turned Democrat 
and an avowed atheist.  She may not believe in God, but she certainly 
has an unfailing commitment to her principles.  "Principles only mean 
something if you stick to them when it's inconvenient," she explains 
with utter sincerity.  She may or may not be the next vice president, 
and it is her adherence to her principles that seems likely to come 
between her and the job she so desires.   Allen, in a consistently 
strong performance, never lets Senator Hanson dissolve into 
self-righteousness.  She gives a sympathetic performance that doesn't 
require sympathy to admire.
The elected vice president died six weeks ago, so President Jackson 
Evans (Jeff Bridges) has to choose a successor.  Knowing that 300 FBI 
agents investigated Nelson Rockefeller, the only other vice presidential 
replacement, President Evans wants to make his choice carefully.  But 
it's more than that.  Six years into office, the president views the 
choice as his "swan song."  
The sharply written script mixes heavy drama with sweet comedy.  The 
president, for example, not having to run again, is kicking back and 
really enjoying the trappings of his office.  He brags that he can order 
absolutely anything he wants 24 hours a day, and he can never stump his 
chef.  He even has a bowling ball with the presidential seal engraved on 
it, which he uses in his own private bowling alley.  It's a great life, 
and he's making the most of it.  Bridges's charismatic performance is 
full of nuances and subtlety that leaves us never quite sure of his 
motivations.
As the story opens, popular Senator Jack Hathaway (William L. Petersen) 
seems to be the likely nominee, especially after his daring attempted 
rescue of a girl whose car goes into the lake near where he is fishing.  
Surprisingly, the President brushes his candidacy aside, claiming that 
someone might decide that his heroism was actually another Chappaquidick 
episode.  This sets up Senator Hathaway to be the shadow candidate for 
those opposed to the president's eventual nominee, Senator Hanson.
The president's long-time nemesis, Congressman Shelly Runyon (Gary 
Oldman), ends up chairing the nomination hearings.  Looking like a 
nerdish version of Roberto Benigni (LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL), Runyon's body 
shakes nervously and his upper lip perspires profusely when he presides 
over his committee.  The congressman is at once utterly polite and 
completely devious.  When he uncovers a college sex scandal involving 
Senator Hanson, he salivates at the possibilities and doesn't shy away.  
He and his fellow conspirators brag to themselves that they are going 
"to obliterate a life."  Runyon's wife worries, with good reason, that 
"he will go down as a second-rate Joe McCarthy."  No matter how 
unlikable Runyon becomes, Oldman never lets him dissolve into 
caricature.
In a great, one-dimensional part, Sam Elliott plays Kermit Newman, the 
president's hard-nosed Chief of Staff.  When the scandal breaks, Newman 
screams his demands.  He wants dirt on Runyon, immediately: "Little 
boys, midgets, cows," whatever they can find.  His approach, however, 
isn't the one that Senator Hanson feels comfortable with.  She wants to 
talk nothing but policy at her hearings -- the usual liberal litany of 
ban all handguns, abolish the death penalty and guarantee a woman's 
right to choose.  She specifically refuses to dignify with any response 
the accusation that she "put on a sex show" in college.  After all, she 
reasons, if she were a man, no one would care about how many women she 
had slept with in college.
All of the casting in this ensemble effort is terrific.  Christian 
Slater is good as a naive and ambitious young congressman who, in a 
career enhancing attempt, negotiates his way onto the nominating 
committee.  Like a minnow swimming with sharks, he seems in constant 
danger.
Lurie's staging is masterful, even if sometimes a bit over the top.  As 
Congressman Runyon denounces Senator Hanson to the world -- "Laine 
Hanson is a cancer!" -- we watch her jog through a military cemetery and 
pass the Iwo Jima monument to the brave boys who fought for our freedom.
The beauty of the story is that we keep waiting for more shoes to drop.  
Some of them do, but others we expect to, don't.  And still others drop, 
but turn out not to be what we expect.  My only complaint is that one 
key twist is needlessly telegraphed.  
"You are an enigma...," the president says to Hanson, his would-be vice 
president, late in the story.  Interrupting him, she completes the 
famous quote, "wrapped in a riddle."  The movie itself is no enigma.  
Its principles are crystal clear and dramatically demonstrated.  THE 
CONTENDER is ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN for our time.
THE CONTENDER runs 2:05.  It is rated R for strong sexual content and 
language and would be fine for most teenagers.

It's hard not to think of The West Wing when talking about The
Contender.  The former begins its eagerly anticipated second season just
days before the latter hits multiplex screens (the comparison hits
closer to home for me, having screened The Contender the morning after
Wing won the Emmy Award for Best Drama).  DreamWorks did well to release
their film right before the upcoming presidential election, as public
interest in the political process should be at a curiously high level.
The Contender is one heck of a slick film, featuring everything from
top-notch performances, glossy sheen (not Martin) and a
better-than-average script.  It's also billed as Joan Allen's first
leading role, which is surprising, considering she's a well-respected,
two-time Oscar nominee.  While The Contender isn't really her picture to
carry alone, she still does a damn fine job.
The film centers on the President's quest to fill the seat of his
recently deceased Vice President.  Jeff Bridges (The Muse) plays the
Democratic Commander-in-Chief Jackson Evans, a popular leader nearing
the end of his second term.  Desperate to leave a unique stamp on
history, Evans picks Montana Senator Laine Hanson (Allen,
Pleasantville), hoping the appointment of a female Veep will be his
Presidential legacy.
Although Hanson isn't the obvious choice, she's certainly capable and
seems to be a lock for the position.  But Evans and Hanson hit an
iceberg in Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman, Lost in Space), the southern
Republican Senator that heads the confirmation hearings committee.  The
Contender shows the interesting back-room power struggle between the
White House and the conniving Runyon, who clearly has no problem
destroying the integrity of a competent candidate, even if it means
digging up some pretty awful dirt on the Vice Presidential hopeful.
Runyon would rather see Governor Jack Hathaway (William L. Petersen,
television's C.S.I.) as the country's second-in-command.  Even though
Hathaway is a Democrat, Runyon is hell-bent on embarrassing Evans in
retaliation for a snub that occurred several years ago.
Allen in fantastic, and an Oscar nomination would not be out of the
question.  Ditto for Oldman, who is refreshing by virtue of not giving
his typical over-the-top performance (although his character looks a lot
like another hammy actor  Roberto Benigni).  But Bridges is The
Contender's big scene-stealer.  His President Evans is extremely
likeable but complexly shrewd (like the big guy on Wing), and he gets
all of the good lines, as well as a funny running gag where he tries to
catch his kitchen staff off-guard with bizarre requests for food.  Sam
Elliott (The Hi-Lo Country) does a good job as the President's Chief of
Staff, while Christian Slater (Very Bad Things) is quite believable as a
turncoat freshman Senator.
The Contender was written and directed by Rod Lurie (Deterrence), a
former film critic for a popular Los Angeles radio station.  You would
think an ex-critic would know better than to slap a preachy morality
lesson onto the end of an otherwise fantastic picture.  The conclusion
of the film might make you leave the theatre with a bad taste in your
mouth, but it shouldn't detract from the otherwise stellar aspects of
The Contender.
2:06  R for brief nudity, sexual content, explicit sex talk and adult
language

Rod Lurie's "The Contender" has been criticized for taking a strong liberal, 
Democratic side as far as the political race is concerned. I hasten to 
disagree though one can argue but why carp? "The Contender" is about the race 
for political office, and how in this post-Clinton climate, a presidential 
nomination is based on one's personal life, not the political. 
The fabulous Joan Allen ("Pleasantville," "Nixon") stars as the fierce, 
determined, stubborn, sexy Laine Hanson, a senator who has just been 
appointed as a vice-presidential nominee by the President of the United 
States (Jeff Bridges). Laine is everything a promising new candidate should 
be: she has a loving husband, a young son, and loves politics. Problem is she 
is also a woman, and has a sketchy past (not to mention she is an atheist). 
It is discovered that she may have been involved in explicit sexual acts with 
several guys while in college. GOP Rep. Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman) is deter
mined to blast the news all over the media - his agenda also stems from 
disapproval of a woman in office, regardless of her past actions. 
Hanson's solution is clear: either admit to these past indiscretions or admit 
that they never transpired. But Hanson is fierce and stubborn - she also has 
some sense of decency. She refuses to admit to anything and would rather keep 
mum than fall for Runyon's own stubborness and sense of moral code. What 
Runyon does not realize is that his own obsession of Hanson's sexual past is 
likely to put him in conflict with the President and cause a genuine lack of 
credibility. 
"The Contender" can be considered liberal and Democratic but I take issue 
with that. I think the film mainly wants us to see how devalued the political 
process has become. We should not judge a political candidate based on their 
sexual or personal history. Our focus should be on the candidate's stand on 
political issues. I am sure everyone can agree that it should be the case 
with Republican or Democratic parties. Should a woman take office if she 
could get pregnant while in the midst of a nuclear crisis? Or if she got her 
period? As Hanson threateningly says at one point to Runyon while having 
lunch: "If someone has to push that button, be sure it is a woman who is 
getting laid." 
There is a subplot involving an FBI agent inquiring about Hanson and another 
vice-presidential candidate caught in some hot water over an incident 
resembling Ted Kennedy's own Chappaquidick incident. The candidate is Gov. 
Jack Hathaway (William Petersen), who failed to rescue a woman trapped inside 
a car in the river. Hathaway's noble yet failed attempt at a rescue risks his 
chances of becoming vice president. Again we are asked, why should a man's 
nobility in a decidedly apolitical incident ruin his political future? 
"The Contender" has great performances and several robust sequences of 
cunning direction and acute sensibility. Not one shot or line of dialogue is 
wasted. Everything flows with terrific precision. Oldman's snickering and 
Bridges's authoritative understanding add to the potency of the material. But 
it is Joan Allen's robust performance that takes us deep inside the political 
process and asks us not to question her actions or past indiscretions as much 
as whether they really matter in the end.

CONTENDER, THE (director/writer: Rod Lurie; cinematographer: Denis

Allen (Laine Hanson), Jeff Bridges (President Jackson Evans), Christian
Slater (Reginald Webster), Sam Elliott (Kermit Newman), William Petersen
(Jack Hathaway), Saul Rubinek (Jerry Toliver), Philip Baker Hall (Oscar
Billings), Kristen Shaw (Fiona Hathaway), Robin Thomas (William Hanson),

A thrilling but shamelessly manipulative political thriller, the second
feature dealing with presidential politics from the director who was
once a film critic, Rod Lurie (Deterrence). He has vastly honed his
skills as a filmmaker in comparison with his debut film, which was a
failure artistically and commercially.
"The Contender" is a film that is grounded in having a clear
understanding of how politically underhanded and sly the system is and
how those in it operate on a level that would make Machiavelli proud of
them.
I was taken aback by how great the entire ensemble cast is, with the
leads being superb in getting the maximum out of their juicy roles, even
if they have to chew the scenery to do it. The cast is so good that it
overcomes the shrill oratory, the manipulative, obvious and unbelievable
political situations, and an ending that tries to play it so safe, that
it takes away the juice in the story that gave this film its power in
the first place. I thoroughly enjoyed it, even though I knew it was a
manipulative film, trying to get me to bite at its revelations about the
double-standards between men and women politicians, without giving me a
fair chance to swallow everything without choking on what I was asked to
swallow.
The film opens as President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges), a Bill Clinton
type, is shown to be a politically savvy politician, more interested in
working his political skills than he is in standing up for his issues.
The film's running gag being that he's a glutton for food, which he
spends more time at than on anything else, trying to test the White
House kitchen staff by ordering exotic foods to see if he can catch them
empty- handed. This only occurs when he orders something ordinary -- a
Muenster cheese sandwich.
Due to the sudden death of the current VP, President Evans has to pick
someone to fill the vacancy. The leading contender for the post is the
ambitious governor of Virginia, Jack Hathaway (William Petersen), a
loyal Democrat and a noted patriot, who is egged on to be more assertive
by his shrewish wife (Kristen Shaw). He becomes a hero in one of the
opening scenes, even though the woman he tried to save dies anyway. The
accident occurred while he is on a fishing trip with a reporter and a
car plunges off a bridge and an attractive woman drowns, but not before
Hathaway bravely jumps into the water amid the reporter's shouts of you
don't have to do it and risks his life trying to save her. There was
something about that action that didn't seem right. It will later on
play an important part in the film's plot.
The President's choice for vice president is Laine Hanson (Joan Allen),
an Ohio senator and a daughter of a former Republican governor. She is
pro-choice, an atheist who recently switched parties from Republican to
Democrat, and is an articulate, poised, and attractive candidate. She is
divorced and currently married to her former campaign manager (Robin
Thomas), and is the mother of a 6-year-old boy. The President taps her
for the job because he wants to leave a legacy that he was the one who
chose the first woman to hold that office.
In an interesting scene, she consults with her father (Philip Baker
Hall) for his approval and advice, realizing that she will have a fight
on her hands from the disappointed Hathaway. It also becomes apparent
that she's a woman who enjoys sex. She receives the President's phone
call, offering her the position, when she is in the middle of having sex
with her husband. The film pulls no punches about her being active
sexually. It makes the viewer face the fact that a woman in high office
is still a woman and has to be accepted just like a man in that position
would be.
The heart of the film is the fight over her confirmation and all the
backroom manuevering to get her the job. She faces opposition from
Sheldon Runyon (Gary Oldman), the powerful McCarthyite-like congressman
who will chair the confirmation hearings. Runyon is opposed to Hanson's
nomination because he wants to get even with the President for some
other political battles they had and because he doesn't like her or her
views. He finds ammunition for his opposition when he runs a private
investigation on her, ala Starr, and finds evidence that when she was in
college pledging for a sorority, she was allegedly having sex with two
boys at a fraternity house as part of the initiation. He comes armed
with photos of her in action and eyewitnesses. He even leaks the story
to the Internet, which posts the pictures so that television and the
tabloids can pick it up. Hanson refuses to comment on the issue, taking
the high moral ground, saying it is no one's business but her own.
A sidebar to the story is about a 28-year-old freshman congressman from
the small state of Delaware, Reginald Webster (Slater), who worms his
way onto Runyon's powerful committteee by promising to support him 100
percent. He is supposed to be a young Bill Clinton-type, first starting
his climb to the top. When he sees the sleazy direction
the confirmation hearings are going in and when called into the
President's office to be bullied by him, he is overawed by the power of
the office, and he begins to have some pangs of conscience. The
President is shown as being figuratively and literally a shark-eater, as
he is eating a shark sandwich when conferring with Webster.
Senator Hanson is seen as both a liberal and a vegetarian. This is
underscored when she has a courtesy luncheon date about her confirmation
with the steak eating right-wing chairman Runyon and orders a spicy
pasta dish, despite his insistence that she better eat voraciously like
he does if she wants to get power in Washington.
The story in itself is more soap opera than drama, but what gives it
verve is the super performances from the three stars, Jeff Bridges, Gary
Oldman, and Joan Allen. They give depth to their roles and they are all
seen in many different lights and shades. Jeff Bridges steals every
scene he is in, offering a fascinating look at a president who could be
likable though sinister, sneakily clever, and also very politically
human in a generous and gracious way. He was thoroughly believable as an
updated Bill Clinton-type, post-Lewinsky.
In a supporting role, as an advisor to the President, Kermit Newman (Sam
Elliott), makes his presence felt in a very forceful performance as the
political realist who has the President's ear but knows when to stop
giving advice and follow his leader.
This film is a pro-Clinton one, taking aim at those who dig up dirt and
cast aspersions in a hypocritical way, when it is evident that both
sides are capable of using the same bag of dirty tricks to further their
own cause. The film was fascinating when it didn't have a message to
deliver with some bogus pat speech and, instead, set up a logical
argument showing that Senator Hanson should be confirmed for office
despite allegations of her youthful sex scandal.

When the scandal over Bill Clinton's sexual desk-capades exploded, we
watched the President of the United States squirm before his inquisitors
like a 12-year-old boy whose mother caught him with a copy of Hustler.
As Clinton dodged questions, played word games and lied outright, many
of us wondered, "Why in the world is he subjecting himself to this? Why
doesn't he simply tell them his sex life is none of their business and
refuse to answer any questions about his private goings-on?"
According to "The Contender," the approach wouldn't work because once
the political wolf pack realized that their quarry was adamant about not
commenting on personal questions, they could freely lob even more lurid
accusations, secure in the knowledge that no assertion, however
outrageous, would be refuted.
Depressing, isn't it? Politics is a nasty business and "The Contender"
wallows in the muck. Masquerading as a high-minded ethical drama, the
movie is just another trashy melodrama, with a slew of respected actors
chewing scenery.
Written and directed by Rod Lurie ("Deterrence"), the story begins a few
weeks after the unexpected death of the vice-president. A replacement
must be appointed and Virginia Governor Jack Hathaway (William Petersen)
looks like a shoo-in for the position. Already a popular figure, his
stature rises quickly when, while being interviewed by a reporter during
a fishing excursion, a car plummets off a bridge and the governor
immediately dives into the icy water to attempt a rescue.
But President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges) has other ideas. Determined
to stake out his place in the history books, Evans announces that a
woman, Ohio Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen), is his choice for the
job. The decision enrages a number of imposing figures, including House
Judiciary Committee Chairman Sheldon Runyon (Gary Oldman) of Illinois.
Heading the confirmation hearings, Runyon pulls out all the stops in his
quest to discredit Hanson. In short order, the soft-spoken nominee is
confronted with allegations that, while in college, she participated in
a gang-bang with a group of frat boys. Instead of doing the Clinton
squirm, Hanson declares that her sexuality is nobody's business,
refusing to "dignify this line of questioning with any comments." Even
when presented with photographic evidence, she remains mute, firm in her
conviction that a line must be drawn between public life and personal
matters.
So the political maneuvering escalates, with Runyon and his minions
leveling even uglier charges while the president and his staff
frantically work on damage control. How will this drama play out?
With lots of speechifying and a juicy contrived ending, of course.
"The Contender" does a number of things right. The film identifies the
party affiliations of its characters (a rarity in this type of fiction)
and makes direct references to real politicians and events. The verbose
storyline maintains a sense of tension all the way to the grand, goofy,
finale. Jeff Bridges creates a believable president, coming off like a
hunky Lyndon Johnson (although a running joke about his delight in being
able to order any food item at any hour wears thin about the fifth time
around). And Gary Oldman is enjoyable as Runyon, a nasty, paranoid,
hypocritical power broker reminiscent of Representative Dan Burton, the
infamous Indiana pit bull who chased cars all the way to Washington, DC.
Oldman has a field day with the role, spitting out melodramatic lines
like "We're both sticking to our guns, only mine are loaded" with
relish.
While the production suffers from one-note supporting characters,
chintzy sets and claustrophobic camera work, the film's biggest
liability is Laine Hanson. The Republican-turned-Democrat Senator, who
voted to impeach President Clinton, is a pro-gun control, pro-choice,
anti-death penalty vegetarian atheist who publicly described the Bible
as a "fairy tale." She apparently was elected on some parallel Earth,
because she certainly would not have won in the Ohio of this planet.
Joan Allen basically reprises her role in "The Crucible" here, playing
the potential vice-president as a "Goodie" Hanson of prim
self-containment. This character should face reporters and declare,
"Unless this country wants to scare off any competent persons, we must
stop putting politicians' private lives under a microscope. It may cost
me the vice-presidency, but I'm standing up for what I believe!"
Instead, she merely reiterates her refusal to discuss personal matters,
offering herself as a maddeningly passive martyr.
Luckily for her, the president and his bad boys are more than willing to
get down and dirty on her behalf. The moral of the story appears to be
that idealism and nobility can succeed in the world of politics, as long
as lies, threats and dirty tricks support those qualities. In terms of
disposable entertainment, "The Contender" is marginally acceptable junk
food. As an intellectual exercise, however, it left me with an upset
stomach.

My jaded snarkasm is, I think, my biggest movie-watching handicap.  Let
one teeny bit of nonsense be shown on screen - like, say, the portrayal
of an Honest Politician - and WHOOSH; the air just squirts right outta
my Disbelief's Suspension, sending it tumbling...
The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
The Clinton era is over, yet there's another Democratic White House -
with Yet Another Sex Scandal on its hands: this time, involving an
ex-Republican of the female persuasion.
The Vice-President Of The United States has died, and President Jackson
Evans (Jeff Bridges) searches for a replacement amongst his Democratic
party.  A candidate, Governor Jack Hathaway (William L. Petersen), is
proposed after he heroically tries to rescue a woman whose car crashes
into the river in which he's fishing.  But the shadow of Ted Kennedy is
cast much too wide for Hathaway to escape, and Evans and his Chief Of
Staff, Kermit Newman (Sam Elliott), reject Hathaway on the basis of
possible misperception and potential innuendo.
Wanting someone who Looks Good above all, Evans - much to the dismay of
Newman and fellow staffer Jerry Tolliver (Saul Rubinek) - decides on
naming Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen) as his new VP.   Insisting that
the reason for not wanting Hanson in the number two spot has nothing to
do with her gender, but that she certainly wouldn't be appointed "just
because" she's a woman, young Democratic Senator Reginald Webster
(Christian Slater)  seeks out Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman), the
Republican chairman running the VP confirmation committee, asking if he
could be part of Runyon's committee.  Before the conformation hearings
begin (using tactics that "even the FBI wouldn't touch"), Runyon and
Webster discover that Hanson may have had a Sordid Past: as a college
freshman, she was rumored to have been part of a fraternity/sorority
gang-bang.  Armed with that knowledge, Webster, and especially Runyon,
set out to destroy any chance of Hanson ever seeing the White House from
the Seat Of Power.
The Upshot:
Like NURSE BETTY before it, THE CONTENDER was chock full of good
performances leading to a dead-end.  Joan Allen, one of the best parts
of the movie PLEASANTVILLE, was excellent as the downtrodden,
too-good-to-be-true Senator Hanson [which reminds me: if she was already
a Senator, why did the scandal not break when she was running for that
office?  Silly me, asking logical questions again].  Gary Oldman, as the
sleazy slimy Shelly Runyon, sent chills down my spine.  Once again, he
submersed himself fully into a role in which he acts and looks
completely different from his previous roles; why his name isn't brought
up when his contemporaries like Streep and DeNiro are mentioned, is
beyond me.  In two strong supporting roles, Christian Slater's naive
junior Senator, and especially Sam Elliott as Kermit [Kermit?  WTF???]
Newman, often Own the scenes they're in.  And even though Jeff Bridges'
food-obsessed version of the President was too comical for me to get
behind, he was Clinton-esque enough to be believable throughout the
first 100 or so minutes of this flick.
So why'd THE CONTENDER fail to get the 3BC equivalent of two thumbs up?
This movie was like the best passage in dancehall tune: the passage
itself may be great, but in the end, the song just repeats one phrase
over and over.
The "one-phrase" in "Contender" split itself in two: on the low octave,
it's "Republicans Are Bad, Mean/And Ugly Too"; and in the high register,
it's "Look At The Honest Politician Done Wrong/And Taking It Up The
Wazoo".  And both notes, hit repeatedly and fair loudly, were enough to
deaden my eardrum. Especially with that "Honest Politician" bit.  The
light went out on that search a long time ago.
THE CONTENDER was a slow-starter, picked up with a twist near the
three-quarters mark, and comes complete with a Big! Speech! reminiscent
of Michael Douglas' turn in THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT.  In this, it's very
much like the political campaign of the GoreBush morph Borg: it looks
like it's saying something Real, but it's really just mouthing the words
without any real feeling.
The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
Setting aside the fact that, unless I misremember, the only speaking
part a Black actor got in THE CONTENDER was that of a White House waiter
[and how's that for a rosy outlook of Our role in the Democratic
future?], let's focus on The Female Factor and how it comes back to The
Black Factor, shall we?
What peaked my curiosity most is that, in some ways, the words "Female"
and "Black" could be used interchangeably in this movie; couldn't you
just hear those Senators saying "I don't mind that he's Black, but I
won't vote for him simply because of that!", or even better, "This is
what comes of Affirmative Action!", and meaning the same thing aimed at
a White woman or a Black man? And yes, I know that there are actually
Black women in relatively high-ranking political positions; but get
real: besides that nutcase that the equally nutcased Pat Buchanon has as
a running-mate, do you really think that an American presidential
candidate is anywhere near ready for a Black woman as the Vice
button-pusher?
Terms being somewhat interchangeable or not, though, I doubt that a
political movie that did interchange them would ever be made.  Unless it
was a Black movie.  Make that, a Black comedy. Starring the Wayans
Brothers as Stepin and Fetchit.
Bammer's Bottom Line:
My lack of respect for the whole of American Politicians having informed
my Suspension Of Disbelief that it was time to give up the ghost, I just
couldn't take this movie at face value.  THE CONTENDER was a pretender
to the throne.  An idealistic pretender, sure; but I defy anyone to find
a Senator Laine Hanson hiding out inside any of the corrupted charlatans
who are our elected representatives.  grumble.
THE CONTENDER (rating: flashing yellowlight):
Hey, I think I'm on to something: "The Pretender" is a much better title
for a portrayal of an Honest Politician, eh?

This little preamble doesn't have much to do with the film at hand, but I
just thought it was strange how three of the main actors from this film,
were also three of the main actors from 1988's TUCKER: THE MAN AND HIS
DREAM. A fine film in its own right and probably the best film that Francis
Ford Coppola has directed in the past 15 years. Jeff Bridges played the
president here and Tucker in the latter film. Joan Allen is vying for the
vice-presidency here, and played Bridges' wife in the other film. And the
young Christian Slater played Bridges' son in TUCKER, and a congressman in
this one. While both films are indeed inspirational, I would recommend
TUCKER to anyone who wants to see a real-life tale of a man pursuing his
dreams through an enormous amount of adversity.
PLOT:
The president of the United States must choose a new vice-president to
replace the previous one who died. The president chooses to elect a woman
for the post, a woman who must first proceed through confirmation hearings
run by a powerful political adversary. That adversary attempts to discredit
the nominee by digging up all of her past improprieties and bringing them to
the political forefront. Political clashes ensue.
CRITIQUE:
A solid political film which to my surprise, moved along at a speedy pace,
offered many strong performances, especially the incomparable Gary Oldman,
and provided great entertainment. This movie seemed to have it all packaged
and ready to deliver. An interesting and timely story line, debating the
personal nature of a politician's private life versus the American public's
"right to know". Twists and turns which I personally did not see coming, but
Mrs. JoBlo somehow did. Notable direction by Rod Lurie who admirably took an
extremely politically charged screenplay and turned it into a fascinating
drama, all without bogging it down in overripe political movie jargon. He
even spiced the whole affair up with perfect touches of humor throughout.
Who knew the president could be so loosey-goosey behind the scenes, but gosh
darn it, I bought it all with this film! But the true tip of the cap goes
out to the entire cast of this movie and the characters whom they chose to
inhabit. I loved them all.
Gary Oldman has always been one of my most favorite actors, a man who can
literally change his entire physical being to "become" someone else. In this
film, he completely personifies this character, creating a man who can only
be described as memorable beyond belief (he even managed to make him
irritating while chewing on a piece of meat...grrrr, stop making all that
noise, you bastard!). But he's not the only pearl in the bunch. More kudos
go out to Sam Elliott, a man not known for taking parts in "big" movies, but
certainly perfect as the president's right-hand man in this one. In either
case, I would be somewhat surprised not to see them nominated at the year
end recognition of talent awards. Joan Allen also drives home the intensity,
sensitivity and unshakable convictions of her character, while Jeff Bridges
surprises all as the amiable, yet shrewd president of the United States.
Although I could have done without the bombastic score during his final
sermon...I mean, speech. And yes, even Christian Slater worked as the
up-and-coming congressman looking to make something of himself. All in all,
I thoroughly enjoyed this film and especially its noteworthy performances.
If only this year's real-life candidates were even half as interesting any
of the main characters in this film... :)

    Is the United States really ready for a woman to be a
heartbeat away from the Presidency? That's the challenging premise of
this timely political thriller in which a Vice-President dies and
Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen) is chosen by the President (Jeff
Bridges) as his successor. Her surprise selection meets with
opposition, particularly from a powerful adversary (Gary Oldman) who
heads the Congressional confirmation hearings and prefers another
Senator (William Petersen), the hero in a recent tragic
accident. Controversy erupts when an Internet site reveals a shocking
incident from Hanson's college days, along with sexually explicit
photographs. Now a happily married mother, she doesn't deny the
allegations but refuses to discuss the sex scandal, contending that
her personal past has no relevance on her public persona. It's
principles vs. politics. Joan Allen's daring and affecting performance
is not just one of the best of the year, it's one of the screen's best
examples of a woman's vulnerable, stoic courage. This remarkable
actress never hits a false note. Jeff Bridges is quite believable, as
are Gary Oldman, William Petersen, Christian Slater, Sam Elliott, Saul
Rubinek, Mariel Hemingway and Philip Baker Hall.  The multi-layered
screenplay by Rod Lurie ("Deterrence") reveals one layer of surprise
after another and his swiftly economical direction proceeds with a
feverish sense of pace and tempo that keeps the attention
riveted. Problem is: the buxom co-ed in the lurid photo bears little
resemblance to the Senator and the heavy-handed running gag about the
White House cuisine soon gets stale. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1
to 10, "The Contender" is an intriguing, enigmatic, compelling 8,
despite Ben Franklin's referral to the post of Vice-President as "your
superfluous excellency."

   Some twenty years ago I was having a discussion at lunch
with some colleagues.  One guy piped up about how the
Europeans don't care what their government leaders' sex
lives are like and in fact may even prefer their prime ministers
and presidents to play around.  Then he added, "I think I'd
rather have a president who enjoys fooling around than one
who's straight and narrow.  I want the guy with his finger on
the button to enjoy his life so that he thinks quite a lot before
he pushes it!"  Well said. Now Rod Lurie, who wrote and
directed "The Contender"--which deals with a woman fighting
to be confirmed in Congress as vice president--frames that
outlook in a wittier way.  Says candidate Laine Hanson (Joan
Allen) to the man who nominated her, "You don't want a
woman with a finger on the button who isn't getting laid."  
   Lurie's political thriller, which appears to be inspired by our
current leader's peccadilloes, is about sex and power, about
how in at least one situation the two most consequential
aspects of life become intertwined when, in Lurie's view, they
should not be.  Lurie--who has more or less stated in
an interview that the game of politics is to him what the super
bowl is to a bunch of all-American TV spectators--showed his
preoccupation with the sport in making the claustrophobic,
low-budget film "Deterrence" just months before.  While the
subject matter of that work is broadly similar to that of "The
Contender," the two are distinct.  "Deterrence" would be
valued by those who can believe that the president of the
United States would decide to nuke Iraq from the comfort of a
rural coffee shop during a blinding snowstorm in Aztec,
Colorado amid a cacophony of varied opinions from the short-
order cook, the waitress and customers.  Enjoying a much
larger budget in his current offering, Lurie has turned out a
mostly plausible drama which, despite going out on a
schmaltzy limb toward the conclusion, is eminently enjoyable
and features Oscar-worthy acting by Joan Allen as the
eponymous contender.  Filmed mostly in Richmond, Virginia,
"The Contender" affords the viewer some insight into the
trappings of power--particularly when the president, as
addicted to food as Bill Clinton, pushes the button labeled
"chef," gets an immediate response, and orders everything
from a shark sandwich on rye to an exotic oriental platter. 
He runs into trouble only when seeking a Muenster cheese
sandwich, which the four-star chef is unable to prepare.
   The story opens on a scene that may remind viewers of
Ted Kennedy's unfortunate debacle at Chappaquiddick, an
event that prevented the man from ever seeking the
presidency.  This time, however, the incident appears to push
Governor Jack Hathaway (William L. Petersen) into the vice
presidential nomination, as he heroically attempts to rescue a
woman who had driven her car over a bridge into the water. 
When President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges) nonetheless
ignores the advice of his chief adviser Kermit Newman (Sam
Elliott) by passing over the governor in favor of Senator Laine
Hanson (Joan Allen), Congressman Shelly Runyon (Gary
Oldman) is determined to squash Hanson's nomination and to
convince the president to go with Hathaway.
   Until the patriotic soundtrack during the final half hour
becomes conspicuous--one which seems designed to get the
audience to stand up in the aisles and salute the flag--"The
Contender" is a credible, sincere and serious-minded work
that gets us thinking about the importance of having high
principles and sticking to them when the chips are down. 
Would you believe a politician would refuse to fight back
against smarmy accusations that she had taken part in a
drunken fraternity-house sex orgy during college days--simply
because she believes that her private life is just that?  
   By making the characters' motivations ambiguous, Lurie
avoids the temptation to push his film into melodramatic soap
opera.  While Congressman Runyon looks evil--Oldman has
been given an unappealing haircut, an ugly pair of glasses,
and looks piggish in scenes that take place across a dining
room table--he is simply doing what a partisan politician does
to defeat a candidate not of his liking in favor of a man he
thinks would be better for the country.  Lurie allows the 28-
year-old Congressman Reginald Webster (Christian Slater)
the will to turn from a young man who plays up to the big
shots against his own principles into a guy who may sacrifice
his chance for an cushy appointment when his conscience
gets the better of him.  Jeff Bridges is alternately funny
(whenever he reminds us of our own president's predilection
for McDonald's) and inspiring, but Joan Allen runs away with
the honors as an individual who seems always to be thinking
of sex (she's enjoying a round with her husband in her very
first scene), but who in a less-than-saintly fashion may have
been involved in a college gang-bang and in a home-breaking
affair with her married campaign manager.  
   Pungent dialogue, solid ensemble performances, sharp
editing that takes us quickly from one scene to the next, and
Rod Lurie's ability to evoke the very best from his actors
make "The Contender" a rousing--if sometimes too slick--
political film.
Rated R.  Running time: 130 minutes.  (C) 2000 by

Former film critic Rod Lurie breaks the 'those who can't, teach' maxim by
writing and directing "The Contender," a pungent political drama with roots
in Otto Preminger's 1962 film "Advise and Consent."
The President (Jeff Bridges, wonderfully funny AND presidential) needs to
elect a new VP and chooses Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen, "Pleasantville") 
because he wants to get a woman in high office as part of his Democratic legacy.
In doing so, he's overlooking the popular Governor Jack Hathaway (William 
Petersen, "To Live and Die in LA"), who's just become a media darling for 
trying to save a woman from drowning.  Unfortunately, the chairman of the 
house committee that must pass the veep's nomination is Congressman Shelly 
Runyon (an almost unrecognizable Gary Oldman) who's both a political foe of
President Jackson Evans and one of Hathaway's best friends.  He uncovers
a sex scandal (a drunken gang bang) from Laine's college days and leaks it.  
Laine refuses to acknowledge the story by either confirmation or denial,
stating that it's no one's business.  The frustrated President continues
to back her, although it's clear Runyon is winning the battle and Hathaway
hovers in the wings.
This complex drama showcases the political process with all it's gameplay
centered with the issue of the right to privacy vs. the right to know.
There are thriller elements mostly represented by the character of FBI Agent
Wilhemina (Kathryn Morris) whose personal agenda is unclear while she
investigates Senator Hanson.  
Lurie's screenplay keeps us off base, never sure of characters' true 
motivations.  He makes clever associations with character development as 
well.  We're introduced to Laine as she's enjoying a passionate interlude 
atop her office desk with her husband, campaign manager William (Robin Thomas), 
so sex is implanted in our minds with the main character at the onset.  The 
President and his opponent are both food obsessed, with the President 
humorously trying to stump the White House chef (requests for shark steak 
sandwiches and hazelnut pudding are an amusing sideline, if done once too 
often) while Runyon is shown devouring rare steaks.  Senator Hathaway's
attemptto save a woman whose car plummets from a bridge into a river is
the anti-Chappaquiddick.  Laine's remark that President Clinton was 
'responsible but not guilty,' is later echoed in reverse by her mentor.
Lurie's screenplay is solid all the way, except for a major plot twist that's 
too perfunctorily coincidental to hold water.
The cast is fabulous.  Joan Allen has a firm grip on her first lead role
(Lurie wrote the screenplay for her).  She's clear eyed and strong through
overwhelming adversity, always sticking to her principles whatever the
country believes of her morals.  I'm sure she'll be remembered when Oscar
nominations are awarded.  Gary Oldman paints a complex, old world politician,
who'll pull any trick in the book to force his agenda.  He clearly believes
he's doing right, however.  The film's 'bad guy' is just not that black and 
white in the hand of this actor.  The vastly underrated Jeff Bridges gives the 
film's most purely entertaining performance as a down to earth President who 
doesn't showboat his intellect.
Christian Slater plays a young and idealistic congressman who compaigns to 
join Runyon's committee, only to have his eyes opened by what he learns from
the inside.  He hasn't been this good since his early teenage films.
William Petersen plays Hathaway as the modern equivalent of a good ol' 
governer with a knack for heroism and ambitions stoked by a nagging wife.  
Sam Elliott is brusquely outspoken and loyal as the Chief of Staff, who may 
disagree with Evans' support of Hanson (or any woman), but stays the course.  
Saul Rubinek fades into the woodwork as the communications officer.  Philip 
Baker Hall appears in one scene as Laine's Republican father and former state 
Governor.  Kathryn Morris makes an impression as the chirpy FBI investigator.
Technically the film is top notch, with Denis Maloney's urgent photography
keeping the audience in the midst of the action.  Costume design by Matthew
Jacobsen (who utilizes designers such as Armani, John Galliano, Pamela Dennis
and Brooks Brothers) is notable as well.
"The Contender" is slated to be a real contender itself when year 2000's
film lists are tallied.

Rod Lurie's THE CONTENDER is a solid enough political drama, but in this 
fall's offerings of high-powered action and big-name-directed comedy, it's 
likely to be forgotten fast.
If Joan Allen doesn't get a nomination for her Senator Laine Hanson, and if 
Gary Oldman doesn't actually carry home the Best Supporting Actor statuette 
for his cagey Congressman Sheldon Runyon  well, something's rotten in 
Hollywood.
Much of THE CONTENDER is run-of-the-mill.  Vice-president dies.  Leading 
candidate for replacement is jilted in favor of female senator from Ohio.  
Ms. Hanson is a former Republican, and Democratic President Jackson Evans 
(Jeff Bridges) realizes this as a plus: voters would reject someone too far 
to the left.  The main complications come when decades-old photographs 
surface.  They allegedly show Hanson as a college student, engaged in an 
orgy, as part of sorority initiation.  Heck, the movie is not that original 
in the way in which Hanson reacts to these accusations.  She refuses to deny 
them, in fact refuses even to dignify their existence by entering into any 
type of dialogue concerning them.
Ruthless Representative Shelly Runyon is clearly out to get Hanson.  He has 
made clear that the President's first choice, Governor Jack Hathaway 
(William L. Peterson), would glide through the congressional hearings that 
are giving Hanson so much grief.
What makes the film strong is not so much Allen's excellent performance as 
the performances of those around her.  Bridges is an old smoothie by now, 
his eyebrows taking on the bushiness of his father's, and his manner taking 
on believable authority as he ages.  Christian Slater stands out in the 
supporting role of a Democratic rookie who seeks the truth at whatever cost. 
  Rough-looking Sam Elliot has dropped his dragoon's mustache to play 
presidential advisor Kermit Newman.  Certainly the cast goes a long way 
toward making the picture much better than average.
A few twists and turns take the rest of the responsibility.  Although I was 
never `on the edge of my seat,' I watched raptly as several plot details 
made it hard to predict what would happen.
Most of all, Gary Oldman  also the executive producer of this outing  
transforms himself into a political Svengali of ambition.  I was unaware of 
Oldman's involvement in the movie; it was not until I spotted his name  
preceding Allen's in the closing credits  that I realized it was he.  This 
balding and unattractive Washington insider looks very different from the 
Russian terrorist in AIR FORCE ONE or from Beethoven in IMMORTAL BELOVED.  
Oldman's acting here makes me believe it's his character who causes the 
story to hang together, in spite of the blatant agendas the film preaches  
namely surrounding women's rights to serve in high political office, and 
women's right to choose abortions.  (It's a small but unfortunate thing, 
too, that Runyon is given character traits that stereotype him as Jewish.)
Though Lurie causes the movie to go on a bit too long, at two hours and 20 
minutes, he does keep our attention to the end.  The target audience may be 
limited for this subject matter, but intelligence and fine acting make this 
a must-see for serious movie-goers unafraid to sit there in the dark and 
think.

The vice president of the US has died, and President Evans (Jeff Bridges) 
must select a new one. The primary candidate in everyone's minds is the 
popular Governor Hathaway (William L. Petersen), who was proclaimed a 
national hero when he tried to save a woman whose car flew off a bridge. 
Instead, Evans chooses Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen), a popular former 
Republican. The people seem willing to go with this choice, but the evil 
Senator Runyon (Gary Oldman) is a friend of Hathaway's, and doesn't want 
Hanson to win. He digs up dirt about her with the help of the young and 
ambitious Senator Webster (Christian Slater). The dirt is that she engaged 
in an orgy back in her college days, and is therefore not morally fit to be 
a vice-president. The president and his chief of staff, Kermit Newman (an 
excellent Sam Elliott), panic and want Hanson to attack back. Hanson 
refuses, saying she won't stoop to such a level and that it isn't right that 
people are digging into her past in such a way. The only problem facing her 
now is that Runyon is head of the committee who will decide if she is fit to 
be vice-president.
Before you read anything in this review, I should let you know that I did 
something no movie critic should do, and something I haven't done in years. 
I walked out of this movie. I know, that's a crime, and if you don't want to 
read the rest of this review because of it I completely understand. I really 
tried to stay for the whole running time, I thought to myself: "self, you've 
suffered through movies like "Battlefield Earth" and lived to tell the tale, 
how bad can this be?" While "The Contender" is obviously no "Battlefield 
Earth", it had one massive element working against it. What was that? Well, 
the fact of the matter is, I was so insulted by this movie I simply couldn't 
watch it anymore. Alright, let me get one thing out in the open right now 
for those of you who haven't guessed it from previous reviews. I'm quite 
conservative. Now, let me explain something before you throw your hands up 
in the air and say, "Well that explains why he didn't like it, he's biased, 
his opinion doesn't count." While I'm conservative, I love movies, and am 
therefore used to a left-wing slant in nearly all Hollywood films. I can 
tolerate a lot because of this, but I couldn't tolerate "The Contender". In 
fact, the only thing that kept me in my seat for almost two hours was the 
acting.
Joan Allen ("Face/Off") leads the film's impressive cast with an impressive 
performance. Much as I disliked this movie, I'm sure it's going to garner a 
few nominations come Oscar time for acting if nothing else. Allen plays 
Hanson calm, cool, and collected at all times, and this is exactly how the 
character should be played. If she'd gone into hysterics at any point it 
would have destroyed all the character's credibility. Gary Oldman ("The 
Fifth Element") overacts with a vengeance as the conniving Runyon, but 
Oldman is the most fun to watch when he's overacting. The character of 
President Evans is woefully underwritten, but Jeff Bridges (whom I will 
always think of as the dude from "The Big Lebowski") does the best he can, 
throwing in a few much needed humorous moments. Christian Slater ("Very Bad 
Things") is good as the naive young congressman, but in my opinion the most 
impressive performance came from Sam Elliott ("The Big Lebowski"). Elliott, 
looking almost unrecognizable without a great big moustache, manages to turn 
a character who was written as nothing more than a cliche into the most real 
person in the film. He is able to play such a wide range of emotions on his 
face it's almost a shame he's always hidden it with that moustache. Watch 
how he plays the scene where he first finds out about Hanson's past. You can 
feel his rage pulsing out of the screen. Philip Baker Hall ("Magnolia") 
makes a brief but good appearance as Hanson's father.
Let's face it, you're not going to find a conservative movie that deals with 
politics in Hollywood these days. You're not even going to find a middle of 
the road one. All political thrillers coming out of Hollywood have a leftist 
slant, though they try to cover it up by throwing little tidbits to the 
right. Look at "Wag the Dog" (which I loved), about a conservative president 
who has a sexual relationship with a minor, and has it covered up by a 
fix-it man. That had a decidedly leftist slant, but it didn't shove it in 
our faces, cram it down our throats, and finally beat us about the head with 
it. You want an example from the movie? Try this one on for size: Hanson is 
out jogging, wearing pristine white jogging clothes, running through a 
graveyard, past an American flag while dramatic music soars. This scene cuts 
back and forth with Runyon sitting in his office, smoking a cigar, plotting 
her downfall with all the other evil Republicans. The room is darkly lit, 
and all the Republicans have hateful looks on their faces It's a nauseating 
scene and I saw three people walk out of the theater during it, never to 
return. Yet I stayed, disgusted though I was. I didn't actually walk out for 
another 45 minutes or so. The scene that finally snapped my will like a twig 
was when Hanson is addressing the senate committee. She raises her head 
proudly, stares the evil senators down, and proclaims every liberal 
philosophy she upholds while astonishingly cheesy dramatic music swells in 
the background. I made a Jeff Bridges style scream of rage and stormed out 
of the theater.
Okay, politics aside, how does "The Contender" hold up compared to other 
political thrillers? Writer/director Rod Lurie (last seen trying to direct 
"Deterrence") directs the film with all the talent of a first year film 
student. The pacing is a joke, the camera work is simply bizarre (he 
switches from a jittery hand-held camera to a professional panning style and 
back for no apparent reason), and the film's message (women are held to a 
double standard in sexual conduct) is delivered with all the subtlety of a 
knife in the naval. Plus, to top that all off, the script is dull. I saw 
people falling asleep all around me, and I frankly envied them. Why is it 
boring? Because every twist thrown at us is seen coming a mile away. The 
score, by composer Larry Groupe ("I Woke up Early the Day I Died"), is full 
of the sort of cheesy, overblown, dramatic stuff that would make Trevor 
Rabin proud. "The Contender" runs a long 126 minutes. I'd recommend the 
movie to left-wingers and people who don't care about politics, and like 
their political thrillers without thrills. I give the movie two out of five 
stars. By the way, does anyone find it a coincidence that such a leftist 
movie is coming out this close to the election?

A few twists and turns take the rest of the responsibility.  Although I was 
never `on the edge of my seat,' I watched raptly as several plot details 
made it hard to predict what would happen.
Most of all, Gary Oldman  also the executive producer of this outing  
transforms himself into a political Svengali of ambition.  I was unaware of 
Oldman's involvement in the movie; it was not until I spotted his name  
preceding Allen's in the closing credits  that I realized it was he.  This 
balding and unattractive Washington insider looks very different from the 
Russian terrorist in AIR FORCE ONE or from Beethoven in IMMORTAL BELOVED.  
Oldman's acting here makes me believe it's his character who causes the 
story to hang together, in spite of the blatant agendas the film preaches  
namely surrounding women's rights to serve in high political office, and 
women's right to choose abortions.  (It's a small but unfortunate thing, 
too, that Runyon is given character traits that stereotype him as Jewish.)
Though Lurie causes the movie to go on a bit too long, at two hours and 20 
minutes, he does keep our attention to the end.  The target audience may be 
limited for this subject matter, but intelligence and fine acting make this 
a must-see for serious movie-goers unafraid to sit there in the dark and 
think.
