In present day Hanoi, three sisters reflect on their parents' relationship 
while trying to define their own in writer/director Tran Anh Hung's
("The Scent of Green Papaya") "The Vertical Ray of the Sun."
Youngest sister Lien (Tran Nu Yen-Khe) greets the day with Hai (Ngo Quanq 
Hai), the only brother whom she rooms and relentlessly flirts with.  Their 
morning ritual of Tai Chi and Lou Reed precedes crossing the 
street to eldest sister Suong's (Nguyen Nhu Quynh) cafe, where Lien works, 
for breakfast.  The three sisters lovingly prepare their mother's memorial
banquet of traditional delicacies, prepared as much for look as taste,
while giggling over the differences between the sexes.
After the family breaks from the banquet, we learn that Suong's young son 
'little monkey' is doted upon, but there's a distance developing with her 
husband Quoc (Chu Ngoc Hung), who's leaving for one of his habitual botanical 
photography trips.  Middle sister Khanh (Tran Manh Cuong) tells her writer
husband she's pregnant before he leaves on a trip to Saigon to research Tuan,
a mysterious man in his mother-in-law's past.  Lien keeps crawling into Hai's
bed at night, causing him to fall out of it.  The initial serenity we witnessed
starts turning into a soap opera before coming to full circle one month
later, as the three women prepare their father's memorial banquet.
"The Vertical Ray of the Sun" is a contemplative piece where strong passions
exist underneath calm exteriors.  Sly humor, self deceit and harsh truths
all exist in the cyclic screenplay.  Tran Anh Hung and his cinematographer Mark
Lee Ping-Bin ("Flowers of Shanghai") linger over and repeat the small gestures
of everyday life - a wife washes her husbands hands, a woman makes water
dance in a bowl, a man pulls his lover to face him before they part.  Small
spaces such as rooms, alleys and courtyards create intimacy.  The color green,
symbolizing life and tranquility, is used heavily in the film's visual styling,
lapsing into yellowish hues and blues.
Writer/director Tran Anh Hung's film recalls Ang Lee's "Eat Drink Man Woman,"
another tale of three sisters of varying modernity coming together
traditionally for a parent.  But while Lee's more traditionally story-driven
film resulted in radical changes for all concerned, "The Vertical Ray of the 
Sun's" characters strive for peaceful harmony.  Watching it is like trailing
your fingertips in a stream on a cool spring day.

When your friend arrives late to VERTICAL RAY OF THE SUN (Ŕ LA VERTICALE DE
L'ÉTÉ) and asks what has happened, you can honestly reply, "basically nothing." 
It doesn't make any difference how late, your friend won't miss anything since
the movie plays like an uneventful three hundredth episode of a soap opera that
you've never seen before.
Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of things to admire in the film, written and
directed by Anh Hung Tran (CYCLO), but all of these are associated with the
film's look.  Shot lushly and romantically by Pin Bing Lee, the movie makes
Vietnam look a beautiful country where the living is easy.  The gorgeous women,
who like to drape themselves over each other as they gab, wear dresses of deep
blues.  The men, who appear to have been chosen for maximum facial variety,
prefer white shirts and like to make their small talk over tea while seated at
tables.  
The most unusual relationship in the picture is between two characters most
often referred to as big brother (Ngo Quanq Hai) and little sister (Tran Nu
Yen-Khe) who live together.  Little sister, who is never seen doing anything
more intimate than close dancing with her brother, likes the way that people on
the street assume that they are "a couple."  They are unusual in more ways than
one.  She manages to wake every morning with complete and unsmeared make-up, and
he bounces out of bed and begins vigorous exercise without needing to even go to
the bathroom.
This slightly moving tableaux is a treat for your eyes, but your mind will leave
quite unsatisfied.  And the length!  Almost two hours.  This brings us to my
first rule for filmmakers.  If you don't have anything to say, at least say it
quickly.
VERTICAL RAY OF THE SUN runs a long 1:53.  The film is in Vietnamese with
English subtitles.  It is rated PG-13 for thematic elements and some sex-related
material.  It would be acceptable for kids around 11 and up, but kids of any age
are unlikely to find much to hold their attention.
The film is playing in nationwide release now in the United States.  In the
Silicon Valley, it is showing now at the Camera Cinemas and will be opening at
the Landmark theaters on Friday, July 27, 2001.

Some movies enter through the eyes and the senses, and bypass the brain.  Tran
Anh Hung's new movie is bathed in languorous heat, drenched in humidity and
rainfall, misted in cigarette smoke, steeped in the scent of green papaya. 
There are story specifics, but they're not insistent.  There is romance, and
there are romantic crises, but they are not resolved and nobody seems to care. 
The center of the world of this movie is three sisters living in contemporary
Hanoi.  The youngest, Lien (played by the director's beautiful wife Tran Nu
Yen-Khe, who has appeared in his features "Cyclo" and "The Scent of Green
Paqpaya") shares an apartment with her brother Hai (Ngo Quanq Hai), and seems to
entertain incestuous feelings for him, if she even knows what that means  we
later discover she is hopelessly sexually naďve.  The middle sister, Kanh (Le
Kanh), is married to aspiring writer Kien (Tran Manh Cuong), who is blocked
about 20 pages shy of the end of his first novel.  The oldest, Suong (Nguyen Nhu
Quynh), runs a café and is married to a melancholy photographer named Quoc (Chu
Hung), and both are involved in unusual romantic entanglements outside the bonds
of matrimony.  
But then these murky romantic tangles are par for the family course.  Their
mother, now deceased, had some sort of involvement at some time in her life with
a man other than her husband.  It could have been a schoolgirl crush  nobody
knows for sure, and the more they think about it, the more they think it might
be better to let sleeping lovers lie.  
The sisters have gathered together to prepare a meal for a family memorial
gathering on the anniversary of their mother's death.  The preparation of food
is visually irresistible in Tran's movies, and here it's enlivened with
speculation about the culinary methods and taste of a central part of the male
anatomy.  "In the old days, women were not allowed to touch a man's face," one
of them observes.  "It was considered too noble a part."  They giggle about the
implied lack of nobility of the part under discussion.  The scene seems to
suggest the separate continents with their separate languages that are the two
sexes, and the unbridgeable gulf between them.  "Vertical Ray" unfolds in the
time between the anniversaries of the deaths of the sisters' mother and their
father, a month later.
There's a lot of confusion of identities in this movie, and though some of it
can be ascribed to the cultural difficulty in telling people from other races
apart, some of it must be intentional.  Lien calls Hai "Big Brother" and he
calls her "Little Sister,' but there is another young man of the same age, a
prospective suitor, whom she calls "Big Brother" and who calls her "Big Sister".
 The mother's man of mystery was named Toan; Suong's lover is named Tuan.  
But none of this matters very much.  The seduction of Vertical Ray is in its
ravishing visuals (it's shot by Mark Lee Ping-bin, who shot Wong Kar-wai's In
the Mood for Love), its moods, and its moments.  Music figures strongly  the
sisters sing songs that could be translated and find a home in Appalachia, and
Lien and Hai wake up in the mornings to the sounds of Lou Reed and Velvet
Underground.  Some of the dialogue sounds stilted, but then we have to rely on
the subtitles, and at least part of the problem may lie there.  Tran is not
after plot, he's after a feeling.  "My thoughts turned back to my childhood in
DaNang," he reflects in the production notes, "remembering the time when I'd be
waiting to fall asleep at night, my mind racing from one thing to another,
nothing precise. The smell of fruit coming in through the window, a woman's
voice singing on the radio. Everything was so vague. It was like a feeling of
suspension. If I've ever experienced harmony in my life it was then. It was just
a matter of translating that rhythm and that musicality into the new film."
