     Starting in January 1961, the British were treated to a sort of
tongue-in-cheek crime and spy series on television.  THE AVENGERS was
about secret agent John Steed and his various partners who changed over
the years.  The original concept for Steed was to have the personality
of a George Sanders--sort of worldly and a little sarcastic.  I cannot
help believing part of the inspiration was also Ralph Richardson's
brawley-toting and bowler-hatted secret agent Major Charles Hammond
from the 1939 film Q PLANES (retitled in the U.S. CLOUDS OVER EUROPE).
Initially the partner was Dr. David Keel (played by Ian Hendry).  Later
for four years it was Catherine Gale (Honor Blackman).  When she left
the producers looked for a replacement that would have the same "man-
appeal" as Ms. Blackman did.  "Man appeal" was abbreviated "M-appeal"
and when actress Diana Rigg was hired "M-appeal" or rather Emma Peel
became her character's name.  She was not with the series even as long
as Blackman but hers were the years that the series got its widest
viewership.  She is the best remembered of Steed's partners, though
there were others before and after her.  The episodes of the Emma Peel
years were noted for a sort of 60s mod surrealism that became the
hallmark of the series.  That was a trademark and so was making the
characters veddy, veddy sophisticated and stylish.  So when in the late
90s, the film industry is making a feature film based on the popular
series, these are the years they choose to copy.
     And remake the series they really did.  The recent film MISSION
IMPOSSIBLE took place in the same world as the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE TV
series and had some of the same characters, but the writers clearly did
not know or did not care what a MISSION IMPOSSIBLE story was all about.
They told their own kind of story with characters from the series.  THE
AVENGERS on the other hand have authentically told an AVENGERS sort of
story and they have told it in the style of THE AVENGERS.  For the most
part, the faults of the film are actually cases where the original
formula did not age well.  As Mike Myers shows us in AUSTIN POWERS:
INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY, much of the 60s mod style looks pretty
silly today.  The story of THE AVENGERS is trivial and comic-bookish,
but that was the series.  The 60s mod surrealism comes through loud and
clear.  Suffice it to say that there are scenes in this film that are
sufficiently visually weird and unexpected to bring a smile to any
viewer's face.  Toward the end of each episode there usually was a
fight under outlandish circumstances and the circumstances in this film
are about as outlandish as any.  The only place where the formula was
not quite followed was that in the series any romantic feelings between
Steed and Peel were strictly between the lines of the script.  There
was a sexual tension, but the characters never acknowledged it.  In
this version is not much romance, but it is much more clearly spelled
out for the viewer.  The Michael Kamen and Joel McNeely musical score I
think should have made more use of the original music. The opening
title music is something of a letdown only because I had hoped to hear
a good version of the original theme.  This is one aspect where MISSION
IMPOSSIBLE was better.  In fact, the music could have done a lot more
to create the feel of the film.  In the final analysis it does little
to enhance the atmosphere.  Even if it was not trying to re-create the
60s feel, it should have been able to add to the excitement better than
it did.  There is one minor plot variation on the canon I would like to
add.  In the film, Steed and Peel meet for the first time, yet the
story also features Mother.  In the series, the very last episode with
Peel introduced Mother for the first time.  And to the best of my
knowledge the character of Father was invented for the film.
     Bon vivant and crack secret agent John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) is
called in after an attack on the British government's secret weather
project Prospero.  Oddly enough the attacker seems to be there very
founder of the project, the beautiful and leggy scientist Dr. Emma Peel
(Uma Thurman).  In spite of actual film of Peel committing the crime,
Peel claims to be innocent.  Steed's suspicion falls on the aptly named
August de Wynter (Sean Connery), a flamboyant Scotsman who is doing
funny things to weather in a project that seems related to Peel's
Prospero.
     How are Fiennes and Thurman at re-creating the characters of John
Steed and Emma Peel?  Not too shabby.  The real danger is that a well-
cast Mrs. Peel will upstage the more quietly conservative John Steed.
However Steed holds his own and never becomes second banana to Mrs.
Peel.  Both seem physically up to the challenges of the role.  Both
seem to ooze charm and class.  Their interpretations are really fairly
close to the originals.  They have one minor change in style, they seem
to smile a lot less and are more serious about their work.  But they do
seem to be the same people the originals played.  And they are helped
along by Don MacPherson's script, which has a very AVENGERS feel.  I
kept picturing Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg delivering the same lines
and in almost the same way.  Patrick Macnee does not appear in THE
AVENGERS, by the way, while Diana Rigg is not in the film at all.  Sean
Connery is Sean Connery is Sean Connery.
     A little fine-tuning could have made this a perfect 90s
representation of the 60s TV series.  That might not have raised the
rating, but it would not have hurt either.  I give this one a 6 on the
0 to 10 scale and a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.

Making the jump from television series to major American motion picture
is a timeless and storied art mastered by few directors and filmmakers.
At first glance, the transition might not seem nearly as difficult as it
is, but upon closer examination it becomes apparent that the differences
between the two media are large enough to cause significant problems.
The episodic fallback of TV - that is, if it doesn't happen this week,
it can always happen next week - is not present; and directors who have
become used to directing forty-two-minute segments must suddenly deal
with at least ninety and sometimes upwards of 120 minutes of footage.
THE AVENGERS, a spinoff of the popular 1960's British show of the same
name, is neither the first nor the last to fail at making the jump; if
anything, its failure to come together was imminent enough. 
Everyone involved here has seen better days, including Director Jeremiah
Chechik. His last big-screen feature, DIABOLIQUE, was a suspenseful and
engaging mystery thriller. Here, his work approaches comic book
territory in an ignorant fashion similar to that of the last two BATMAN
features. The characters are larger than life - in a bad sense - and are
never quite on the audience's level. All three principals are played by
A-list names, but each of the three have seen better days. Connery's
work here is uncharacteristically drab, and not since 1996's THE ROCK
has he been much fun. Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman, too, are fine for
the roles apart but fail to start much in the way of romantic chemistry
together. 
If anything, the movie is fun to watch for several reasons, although you
may have trouble convincing a friend to see the movie with you. Even
though Connery is rather drab, it's been over two years since the
infamous Brit has been on the scene; any dialogue he speaks is
invariably fun to listen to. Also, the movie's one bit of vulgar
language comes both from an unlikely character and at a horribly
unlikely moment; it's over and done so fast that you might not believe
your ears. Finally, in typical comic book fashion, the bad guys are
surly, hulking fellows with third-grade vocabularies or women in tight
catsuits. Both elicit attention from the audience, for varying reasons
and lengths of time. 
But any ground made there is lost in the terribly convoluted and
laborious plot that THE AVENGERS sports. John Steed (Fiennes) and Emma
Peel (Thurman) are suave and debonaire secret agents, charged with
finding the cause in a recent sabotage of a British defense mechanism
called Prospero. Prospero, it seems, has the ability to create a weather
"shield" around the British Isles should the Union Jack come under
siege. In the wrong hands (August de Wynter, played by Connery), though,
the controllable weather turns into an extortion plan. De Wynter will
bombard the isles with typhoons and lightning unless paid an appropriate
sum. Several questions are left completely or partially unanswered
throughout the movie, including an Emma Peel clone. Overall, THE
AVENGERS is too goofy to be much fun; and with luck its box office
returns will be nil, sparing us of a sequel.
FINAL AWARD FOR "THE AVENGERS": 1.5 stars - a below average movie.

People who know me will be surprised to discover that I've never watched a
second of this show, and not at all surprised to discover that I'm dying to
finally get a glimpse of it.  One would think that in theory I could get a
neat glimpse into what the show was like by watching a movie based on it,
but such is the magic of the Hollywood machine.  Unless the show is really
a huge mess with a scattered, confusing plot, lots of bad puns, and only a
couple cool moments...oh, and some neato fashion.
Okay, it's not that bad.  But it's close.  "The Avengers" is only made
better if you're not a fan of the cult hit TV show from the 60s, where
you'd probably be appalled if you saw what has been done with it, unless
the show was really this mediocre.  Since I have nothing but lots of good
word of mouth about how cool the show was, I have no way of knowing how
faithful it is.  I just know that it made me want to see how cool the
original TV show was since Hollywood doesn't exactly have a good track
record with bringing TV shows to the big screen.
All I know of the show is what I know from reading and listening to fans,
and what I know is this: the Avengers of the title are a pair of secret
agents working for the British government with the job of stopping criminal
masterminds that plague the country.  While the heroines changed (the most
popular being Emma Peel, played by Diana Rigg), the hero, John Steed
(played by Patrick Macnee), was always the same.  Steed was a master of
suaveness, and with his proper dress, fashionable hat, and umbrella always
in hand, he was a master of the dapper...or so I'm told.  Peel was just as
intriguing, what with her skin-tight black leather costumes and smart
babeishness, and the two had a cool sexual tension between them that never
crossed the line since Peel was married anyway.
The film brings back those two, with amazing actor Ralph Fiennes playing
Steed, and also amazing actress Uma Thurman playing Peel, and the film
gives us an introduction to them.  As like every TV show film adaptation,
this film is designed to launch a franchise and a whole slew of sequels a
la Batman, and like all of the spin-offs, this feels like more of a trite
introduction than an actual good film, which the original "Batman" film
was.  We get a half-assed case to introduce the characters, and generally
give us a good feel about them, but this film exacts the point that many of
these films just don't care about their plots.
Here's this one: a billionaire named August de Wynter (Sean Connery,
finally playing a spy-like villain) has decided to make England pay for
their weather by designing a device that controls it.  It's up to Steed and
Peel to stop them.  It's not the best plot (actually, it sounds
disturbingly a lot like the Simpsons episode where Mr. Burns blocks out the
sun with a machine and tries to get the town of Springfield to pay for it),
but it could have at least been easy to follow.
The chief complaint I have with this film is it's not done yet.  I swear to
god this film has scenes missing, as if some NYU student got a hold of it
and cut it up a bit so that it would be less presentable.  Not only do
simple things, like the explanation for a second Emma Peel and the motive
for August's actions, never become clear at all, but this film has gaping
plot holes that cause this film to make little to no sense.  Why does
August's henchman (Eddie Izzard, most likely the next Dr. Who) decide to
attack Steed and Peel by using giant cyberbugs with cannons on them?  Beats
me, but it sure annoyed me.
Actually, it's not too horrible.  The film choses an interesting path to
chose: instead of worrying about plot, it decides to set a certain mood. 
And for the first half of this film, we get to kind of just hang with Steed
and Peel as they get to know eachother and flirt unsubtely.  Fiennes is a
terrific actor, and he pumps up the charm as high as he can get it, making
Steed a wonderfully likable spy.  Even an Avengers-fan/friend of mine
pointed out that he was after all a great choice for playing Steed. 
Meanwhile Thurman isn't bad, although not as interesting as Fiennes.  She
just never finds the exact note for her performance.  Still, the first half
is fun to watch, and I was rather entertained albeit very clueless to what
was going on.
By the end, though, it had begun to resemble one of the worst of the
annoying TV show film adaptations, "Batman and Robin," where they had
crossed from light camp into total lampooning.  Both the end of "The
Avengers" and the entirety of "Batman and Robin" rely on bad jokes, witless
humor, and annoying and badly-executed action sequences to "carry" them. 
So what do we get for watching the first hour or so of this film?  A boring
and blessedly trite attack by Steed and Peel on the fortress of August,
with a sword fight (sorta) and a whole lotta water.  And following that, a
rip off of the ending of a James Bond movie.  Ugh.
I have to admit, though, I actually did like some of this movie.  I loved
Ralph Fiennes performance, and was pretty into Thurman's as well (though I
suspect I'll fall in love with Diana Rigg like everyone else who saw the
show did).  I laughed at several of the jokes (especially August's note to
the British Government: "I'll make the weather so cold that you all will
have to go to hell to warm up), and appreciated that they at least let
actors like the great Jim Broadbent and a hilarious, Tommy Gun yielding
Eileen Atkins do some good British humor schtick.  But I wouldn't reccomend
it.

_The_Avengers_ (PG-13) no stars (out of ****)
Before I take a closer look at anything within a film--the acting, the
script, whatever--it must first pass the "WTF" test.  That is, I must be
able to safely watch the entire film without once seeing something so
incredibly, stupefyingly insulting, at which point I am left to (audibly)
utter, "WHAT THE FUCK?"  The mega-budgeted big-screen update of the cult
'60s spy TV series _The_Avengers_ failed the WTF test around the 25-minute
mark, when the villainous Sir August DeWynter (Sean Connery) has a
conference with his partners in crime.  While that doesn't sound out of the
ordinary in and of itself, DeWynter and his conspirators, seated at a long
table, are all wearing fuzzy teddy bear suits.  Each one in a different
color of the rainbow.  Everyone together now: "WHAT THE FUCK?"
Exactly what is this completely incomprehensible bore perpetrated by
"director" Jeremiah Chechik and "writer" Don Macpherson about?  No, it's
not about superslick British spies John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Dr. Emma
Peel (Uma Thurman) and their world-saving adventures.  Nor is it about
DeWynter's mystifying plan to somehow destroy the world by way of a weather
machine.  Far from it.  _The_Avengers_ is about the superstylish fashions
sported by Academy Award-nominated models Fiennes and Thurman.  Here's
Ralph in a classy gray flannel and silk suit with matching bowler hat and
umbrella.  Now it's Uma, looking fetching in a skin-tight, neck-to-toe
vinyl catsuit with four-inch heels.  And so on.  Yes, there is something of
a story stringing the fashion show together, but since Chechik and
Macpherson obviously didn't give it a second thought, neither will I here.
Granted, the photogenic Fiennes and Thurman make an attractive pair.  But,
as with even the best models, things go straight to hell once they open
their mouths.  The two are talented actors, but there's nothing they or
anyone can do with Macpherson's witless idea of comic repartee.  The
tension that consequently builds between Steed and Peel is not sexual but
of a different sort--the type you get when oil and water meet (so I guess
you can say there is some kind of chemistry going on).  The Oscar winner in
the bunch, Connery, is even more lost, so over-the-top as if to be "acting"
in a completely different film from another planet. 
For the entire film, the audience with whom I saw _The_Avengers_ was stone
silent... until the end credits started to roll, at which point a lone
voice from the rear of the auditorium snapped, "That shit was stupid."
While no one offered an "amen," I'm certain that's exactly what everyone
was thinking.

Though at times I wasn't sure what to make of The Avengers, I must admit
that I came out pleased. I don't really know why, but I just enjoyed the
film. It's due in great part to the costume and production design. The
Avengers is a stylish, vibrantly colorful and opulent picture.
I don't think I'd do very well in capsulating the story. The writer
didn't do a very good job with it either. Basically, Sean Connery is a
villain bent on world domination. He threatens every country in the
world with his weather controlling device. If they don't pay him 10
percent of their GNP, he freezes their country. Special agent John Steed
(Fiennes) works on stopping him, with the aid of Dr. Emma Peel (Thurman)
who has only a short time to clear her name of heinous wrong-doings.For
some reason (that I either didn't get or that wasn't explained clearly)
there is a duplicate Emma Peel running about. She looks like Uma, only
colder. And she is, of course, the one responsible for being bad. I
don't think I've done a very poor job of explaining this, the story just
isn't that good.
But there is something likable about the cheesey dialogue. And how could
you not like a film that has people in huge colorful teddy bear costumes
at a board meeting? There is also a spiffy "locust" attack, orchestrated
by British rising star comedian Eddie Izzard, who's only line comes at
the end of the film. One of many lines that made me chuckle, I might
add.
Some films make it difficult to tell if they take themselves seriously.
With Congo, they certainly did not, but that didn't work for so many
reasons. With Godzilla, I'm not sure whether or not they took themselves
seriously, but really, no matter how they took themselves, they couldn't
have made it palpable. But The Avengers puts a modern, spunky twist on a
campy 60's TV series. True fans probably won't much care for the new
version, they seldom do. But as a viewer who has seen episodes, but was
never die hard fan (and honestly can't remember much about them) I was
able to enjoy The Avengers for what it was worth. Admitedly, it could
have been made MUCH better than this. Fiennes and Connery are
forgettable, and so is Thurman (who has never looked better). But for
some reason, I didn't care about that as much with this one as I do with
so many others. I think there is enough splash and style, enough pretty
photography, enough cool effects and funky characters (shallow though
they may be) that I can recommend this film for some light-hearted,
thuroughly predictable fun.

        If you think about it, movies are a lot like animals.  "Saving
Private Ryan" is definitely a cat: it stretches out comfortably on the
couch and looks at you with cool indifference.  It yawns occasionally.
It doesn't like to be touched, because warm, caring relationships are
too stifling for its lifestyle.  It's not the least bit interested in
who you are, as long as you feed it.
        "The Avengers," on the other hand, is a frisky little puppy.  It
nips playfully at your heels, races all around the house, and piddles
excitedly on the rug.  It desperately wants to please you, because it
loves you unconditionally.  It begs you to play with it, and will happily
lick your face for an hour before dashing off to chew your shoes.
        Never before has a movie so horrid been so wonderful.  During a
summer dominated by extremely long and pretentious films, it's a great
joy to watch a fairly brief movie that not only knows it's bad, but takes
great delight in the fact.
        Ralph Fiennes stars as John Steed, a British secret agent who
works for an organization known only as The Ministry.  He's a mild-
mannered but undeniably dapper chap, never without his umbrella, bowler
hat, or smirk.  He does a fine job of protecting London, as long as it
doesn't interfere with his tea-time.
        Uma Thurman is Dr. Emma Peel, a beautiful, brilliant scientist
who has been framed for a crime she claims she didn't commit.  She's
sexy, tough, and somehow manages to consume as much tea as Steed does.
The Ministry orders Steed to help her clear her name, and the two are
off.
        Sean Connery is Sir August De Wynter, a supervillain who's evil
only because the script says so.  He's just as brilliant as our heroes
but dresses better (check out his lovely color-coordinated kilts, for
instance).  He will not rest until he's taken over the world... except
to drink lots of tea, of course.  Thus do we have our movie.
        What else can be said?  The film, like the television show of the
same name, is pure camp.  (One of the action sequences involve Steed and
Peel chasing a flock of life-size, rainbow-colored teddy bears through
the streets of London.)  The dialogue alternates between horrible
puns and failed attempts to make the characters seem witty.  An actual
scene from the movie (paraphrased):
        Your reaction to the above paragraph will tell you whether or not
you should see "The Avengers."  If you groaned and buried your head in
your hands, stay away.  If you thought it was witty, brilliant dialogue,
seek professional help immediately.  But if you groaned and rolled your
eyes but nonetheless got a goofy grin on your face for a moment or two,
this film may be your cup of (ahem) tea.
        Why?  After all the negative things I've said about the movie,
how can I possibly recommend it?  Simple: it's a lot of fun.  Fiennes,
Thurman and Connery are clearly having a good time, and their goofy
enthusiasm is contagious.  Connery imparticular is wonderful, throwing
his considerable acting talent into a brainless role.  He's the most
memorable "screen meanie" we've seen all summer, and the fact that he
actually manages to deliver his cornball dialogue with a straight face
makes me respect him even more.
        There are some nice directorial touches as well; at one point,
Peel finds herself trapped in an Escher-esque labyrinth... the sort of
place where stairways lead nowhere, and walking through a doorway takes
you back into the room you just left.  I found this to be quite an
impressive sequence (I remember thinking, "She's trapped in the maze from
ZORK I!").  Some other shots are also memorable: look for the lovely
camera pan across the "snowglobe table" in Connery's house.
        Sure, there are some fairly substantial problems with the film:
a subplot involving clones is never really resolved, the final confron-
tation between heroes and villain is extremely unsatisfying, Uma's
British accent comes and goes, and one of the film's action sequences
is a none-too-subtle (but less-effective) reworking of the speeder bike
chase from "Return of the Jedi."  In addition, the movie contains what
is possibly the highest numbers of continuity errors ever captured in a
film (something I frequently don't notice).  But none of that matters;
indeed, I wonder if some of the above was intentional, to add to the
camp feel.
        Director Jeremiah Checkhik remains faithful to the feel of the
television series in many other subtle ways as well.  The hairstyles,
clothes, and cars are all straight out of the sixties, for example.
These items were so subtly integrated into the movie that I didn't even
notice them until the film was halfway over.
        The interplay between the characters is also well-done.  The
sexual tension between Steed and Peel is not only present, but often
very humorous.  (Steed at one point suggests to Dr. Peel that they call
each other by less formal names.  She reluctantly makes a concession:
"Very well.  You may call me *Mrs.* Peel.")
        I've no doubt sealed my fate as a film critic: not only did I
pan "Saving Private Ryan" while raving about "Halloween: H20," but I've
just recommended a movie which is, by my own admission, pretty bad.  But
when a film is this much fun, friends, "bad" is no reason not to attend.
The lynch mob starts over there.  Tea, anyone?

Insufferably mannered twerp (Fiennes) and fashion victim (Thurman) are 
supposedly secret agents set out to stop weather-controlling madman 
(Connery).  Despite the obvious charisma imbalance, the dearest wishes of 
the audience and severe editing, they succeed.  Bugger.
"One should never fear getting wet," slathers nerdish supervillian Connery 
to lust-thang and world's least plausible scientist Thurman.  But he's 
forgotten that absolutely everyone is wet in this soggy, lumpish remake of 
the cult TV series.  For those who came in late: "The Avengers" were a duo 
of elegantly stylish superspies who nonchalantly dispatched grave threats 
to British (and global) security every week.  Never mind that the plot 
quickly degenerated into a parody of themselves, a disjointed haiku of 
illogical setpieces, non-sequiturs, and contrived sequences:
But it was fun, and you might think it was ripe for a remake, or a 
reinvention (a la "Lost In Space").  Of course, you might also think that 
my grandmother was a tap-dancing Martian.  For "The Avengers" (or as we 
might call it "The English Patient 2", except in this case the patient is 
the film, DOA) is a dreary, incoherent mess.
It's not easy to say just what's wrong with this film, because everything 
is wrong.  We meet Ralph Fiennes as the ultradangerous agent John Steed.  
Dangerous, because you fear that at any moment he will don an anorak and 
start to talk earnestly about trainspotting.  He's on the job because the 
hightech satellite system that (stifle your laughter) controls Britain's 
weather has been sabotaged.  Could it be the work of Dr Peel, the insectile 
method nymphet Uma Thurman?  No, her mission is to use up the stockpile of 
blue eye-shadow left over from the 1960s.  So after some single entendres, 
our dull duo are off.  And then they're off to solve the case.
They go to talk to the eccentric Sir August, who turns out to be a toupee 
with Sean Connery hiding underneath.  After he and Uma engage in some 
sub-"Carry On" sexual banter, Fiennes is attacked by August's strangely 
silent minions.  You might think that these henchmen say nothing because 
they are actually the set carpenters, hauled on to fill in the gaping 
crevasses in the screenplay.  No, they are silent because they have been 
struck dumb by the quality of dialogue around.  In fact, one minion 
suddenly develops stigmata during one of Fiennes and Thurman's romantic 
clinches.  *thinks* No, just a moment, that was me.
There's a twin of Emma Peel running around at this point.  No, they never 
explain this.
The baddies drop a map so our tepid twosome can find the secret lair.  
Connery meets with his cohorts, who are all dressed in (I kid you not) 
brightly coloured teddy bear suits.  Connery explains this is so no-one can 
be recognised, and I find that explanation strangely plausible.  Fiennes 
and Thurman try to spark their areactive screen chemistry, but (alas) there 
is no catalyst that powerful.  However Uma strains so hard that you can 
actually see her _trying to remember her lines_!  Dispirited by their 
failure, the comatose couple are forced to reveal that the real mastermind 
is the co-head of their organisation, the blind (and strangely like a 
Thunderbird) Father.
There's that twin again.  What is that all about?
Connery, determined to never work again, dons a kilt and threatens the 
leaders of the free world.  Just what the leaders of the free world are 
doing in London, is never explained.  I guess after Connery buries London 
in snow, they bugger off home.  ("Sod this English weather.")  Uma decides 
that the only way to get to the bottom of things is to don a red catsuit 
with leather hotpants (which looks much worse than you can possibly 
imagine) and get captured.  While captured she begins to hallucinate, 
making the audience very jealous.  But Ralph and her get together again and 
the movie flickers to life briefly as they go mano-a-mano with Connery and 
his henchman.  (That's hench-man.  One.  Count 'em, one.  Ohh, it's just so 
horrible.)
"Still suspicious?"  apostrophises Uma.  "Just wondering if you bought me 
here under false pretenses," winces Ralph.  And the audience can then cry 
out, "Yes, yes, oh yes!!"  Avoid this dull, unworthy mess.  [0/bomb] and a 
bad acid flashback on the Sid & Nancy scale.

Conventional wisdom among collectibles retailers is that children's items
begin to dramatically escalate in price about twenty-five or thirty years
after the item was made. That's when the kids of that time have jobs,
disposable income and a desire to re-visit the awe and wonderment of childhood
that has disappeared from their lives. Check out the prices of toys from the
late sixties and you'll find that Yogi Bear lunch boxes are demanding
big bucks.
There's a heavy nostalgia nowadays for the late sixties and early seventies
and nowhere is it more apparent than on the big screen. Boomers are now mostly
in their forties and fifties and have lived in the work-a-day world for a long
time. They'd like to re-capture some of that fun they remember from days of
yore. Hollywood seems more than eager to churn out product to help them.
Directors are zealous to put their stamp on icons from that time.
And for the most part they're messing it up.
"Mission Impossible", "Lost In Space", "Godzilla", "Zorro". None of these
successfully capture the originals. None of these are even good films. You can
now add "The Avengers" to the list.
The British television series began in 1961. Super secret agent John Steed
(then-Patrick Macnee) and his third partner, Emma Peel (then-Diana Rigg) are
the pair that the American audience fell for. Surrealistic and witty, the
series fit the mood of the times. The leather-clad Rigg probably didn't hurt
the ratings either. After all it's not a coincidence that you can't pronounce
her character's name without "appeal".
Now we're in the nineties. Steed (now-Ralph Fiennes) and Peel (now-Uma
Thurman) are battling evil genius Sir August De Wynter (Sean Connery) who is
screwing with England's weather.
That's about as much of a plot as we have. There's some footage about a lot
of other things that either don't make sense or make even less sense. We get
betrayal for some unknown reason. Evil clones appear and vanish and have no
connection to the film. Remarkably ineffective giant flying robot wasps with
machine guns in their belly come from nowhere for no good reason. There's a
high tech hot air balloon, but I have no idea why anyone's in it.
The spy agency is run by a man called "Mother" who is in a wheelchair and a
woman named "Father" who is blind...at least in some scenes. There's probably
a reason for all of this, but we'll never know it.
Macnee makes an appearance of sorts. He is the voice for an invisible man
whose character goes nowhere in a scene that does nothing.
A group of villains sits around a table, all clad in huge pastel-colored
teddy bear outfits. At first it's humorous to watch the teddies waddle around,
but then it becomes goofy.
The movie is a medley of clutter, confusion and wrong decisions around every corner.
It feels like major portions of the film are missing. The storyline jumps
rather than flows. Reportedly the film was re-cut several times. This is one
of those times where the whole is less than the sum of the parts especially
since some of the parts appear to be missing.
There's one good point where Peel is running from one room to another in a
house designed by Escher. Other than that, the effects are second-rate. The
weather threat is old hat as are the scenes of huge tornadoes.
Thurman almost makes an adequate Emma Peel but it doesn't work. She looks
good, dresses in all the right fetish outfits but there's no spark. Fiennes
fares even less well. Macnee's Steed was a witty man of the world with a sense
of humor. Fiennes' agent comes across as a dour kid in grown-up clothes who
has never been out of his home town. Even Connery, one of the greatest living
actors, doesn't have much of a presence outside of a few fiery scenes.
The action scenes are difficult to follow. Director Jeremiah Chechik
(responsible for the atrocious remake of "Diabolique") somehow manages to put
the camera exactly where it shouldn't be. Things happen, people move around,
but even if, with the utmost effort, you were able to care about any of it,
the scenes are bewildering.
The primary allure of the original was the interaction between the two leads.
Witty banter and an underplayed sexual tension were a winning combination.
Admittedly there are a few humorous sexual puns in the film, but there's no
chemistry and the repartee is anything but clever. One of Emma Peel's first
lines of dialog is "Rules are made to be broken." It doesn't get any better.
Advance word alone should have been enough to scare off anyone. The release
date was changed several times. Connery refuses to promote the film. There was
no screening for critics which may have been a good choice for Warner
Brothers. At least this way, they get something of an audience for the first
weekend before the news gets out.
Admittedly I haven't seen an episode of the television series for a couple of
decades. My guess is that it would be severely dated now. No matter how
antiquated it might be, there's no doubt that it holds up better than this
film is at first viewing.
There's no reason to waste any part of the last few days of summer inside
watching this movie. No reason at all.

THE AVENGERS (Warner Brothers)
The ill-advised decision by Warner Brothers not to screen "The
Avengers" for critics prior to its release has led to rampant speculation on
exactly how bad the $80 million film must be. At the same time, the numerous
clips from the movie in the HBO "First Look: The Avengers" special that's
been airing for the past couple of weeks make the picture appear pretty
intriguing, and the allure of Ralph Fiennes in a Saville Row wardrobe and
Uma Thurman poured into a leather catsuit is pretty potent in and of itself.
So what's the verdict? Well, suffice to say there have certainly
been much worse films screened this week: "The Avengers" is certainly easier
to sit through than "Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver." Early reports hinting that
WB cut out crucial scenes in a last-ditch effort to make this wildly offbeat
spectacle palatable to the masses appear to be true -- the film plays like
some sort of feverish hallucination with no real logic or continuity. A mess
"The Avengers" may be, but it's infinitely more interesting and imaginative
than such numbing crowdpleasers as "Armageddon" and "Lethal Weapon 4."
Don Macpherson's screenplay emphasizes style over story to such a
point that you'll be hard-pressed at the end of the movie to recall exactly
how it all began. Still there are some mighty amusing moments along the way,
including a wonderful sequence set in a maze of marble halls and stairways,
a chase scene involving a fleet of robotic killer bees, the gorgeously dark
image of Fiennes and Thurman moving serenely across a river inside giant
plastic bubbles, and your only chance this week to see Thurman attacked by a
giant teddy bear. The chemistry between Fiennes (as the relentlessly dapper
secret agent John Steed) and Thurman (as both Dr. Emma Peel and her
malevolent, silent clone) never quite reaches the boiling point, although
the pair seem to enjoy bouncing Macpherson's quirky dialogue off of each
other and both stars look simply smashing throughout.
As Sir August DeWynter, the villain of the piece, Sean Connery
fares somewhat less well. Not only does he have very little to do -- his
role appears to have been truncated somewhere along the line -- but he seems
uncertain of exactly how to play the few scenes he's in. It looks like
Connery was on his way to camp it up like a "Batman" baddie and director
Jeremiah Chechik toned him down. Better to have allowed the actor to follow
his instincts; if anyone should be given leeway to go over the top, it's
someone portraying a madman plotting to blackmail the nations of the world
with a weather-controlling device.
Aside from its defiantly oddball sets, characters and situations,
"The Avengers" sets itself apart from the summer-blockbuster herd by
striving for an intentionally artificial look that calls to mind the
cheapish TV show. For example, the special effects make no attempt to
convince you that that's really a twister in the middle of the Thames River
or that the sudden blizzard enveloping London actually came from the sky.
Instead these visuals simply say, "Of course this is fakery, just like
everything else you're looking at," and it's hard not to be charmed on a
certain level. "The Avengers" is flawed on any number of levels and will
almost certainly prove to be a box-office disaster, but if approached with
an open mind and suspended disbelief it has its share of small delights.

Even after reading the pathetic excuses from the Warner Brothers spin 
doctors for withholding one of the summers most anticipated films from 
critics, I went into "The Avengers" hoping for the best. Maybe they 
really had withheld the film so that audiences could "discover" it on 
their own. Sadly, the negative buzz turned out to be true. "The Avengers" 
is a strong candidate for worst movie of the year. In addition, it's 
absolutely the most dreadful big screen adaptation of a TV series I have 
ever witnessed, taking the ultra-stylish, clever 60's spy show and 
turning into a disjointed, garish train wreck of a movie.
So what went wrong? Virtually everything. Let's start with the central 
characters. As played by Patrick Macnee, John Steed was a conservative, 
dapper fellow and formidable foe. His droll wit and assured smile 
reflected the confidence of a consummate renaissance man. In the hands of 
the usually excellent Ralph Fiennes, Steed merely seems constipated. 
Wearing a smirk for most of the film, his performance is far too wispy 
and tentative for a character of such substance.
As for Mrs. Peel, the results are even more painful. Diana Riggs turned 
the character into the epitome of chic, combining razor sharp 
intelligence, a keen sense of humor, killer fighting skills and a 
devastating smoky sexuality. Uma Thurman simply hasn't a clue. While her 
Mrs. Peel possesses the appropriate looks and wardrobe, everything else 
is missing. More often than not, she comes off like a coy model or simply 
a victim.
In the series, the relationship between John Steed and Mrs. Peel simmered 
beautifully. Here they kiss, effectively killing the romantic and sexual 
tension the original maintained for years. Imagine if Mulder and Scully 
had smooched in the first episode of "The X Files" and you'll have an 
idea of the dampening effect this kiss has on the duo.
As for the legendary banter between the characters, most of the lines 
here are as stilted and leaden as the scripted exchanges between Academy 
Award presenters before they open the envelopes. What passes for wit is 
often beyond embarrassing. The film contains a scene where Mrs. Peel 
falls through a hole in the earth and plummets into the villain's lair. 
When he greets her, she actually says "I thought I'd drop in." This is 
humor? For God's sake, cartoons don't even use that line anymore!
Speaking of villains, the bad guy here is Sir August De Wynter (Sean 
Connery, in a blustery performance), a megalomaniac bent on taking over 
the world with a purloined weather-controlling machine. The plot, for 
lack of a better word, involves clones, criminals dressed as bulky teddy 
bears, giant mechanical bees, and enough outrageously fake looking snow, 
cut-rate CGI and cheesy special effects for a dozen low budget syndicated 
sci-fi TV shows (hell, even the blue screen scenes look phony). 
Add a lot of big, showy sets and costumes to the aforementioned mess and 
what have you got? A disaster strongly resembling last years horrible 
"Batman and Robin," except that, hard is it may be to believe, this one 
is even worse. Reportedly, the studio chopped a great deal of footage 
from the film following disastrous test screenings, resulting in a final 
90 minute version that feels like three hours. 
The edit renders the comic book plot incomprehensible at times, as 
characters appear and disappear from various locales for no discernible 
reason. A perfect example is a scene where Mrs. Peel enters a phone booth 
on the estate of her enemy and states the code words to trigger a secret 
entry mechanism. How does she know the villain's code? Why is there a 
phone booth in the middle of a sprawling estate? And most importantly, 
how did they take a wicked good TV series and turn it into such a 
godawful movie?
Stay away from "The Avengers." Episodes of the original series are due on 
video shortly and it's likely that some cable network will rerun the 
series to capitalize on the publicity from this travesty. Seek out the 
show and you can enjoy one of the highlights of 60's pop culture 
entertainment while avoiding one of the low points of the 90's.

I heard an awful lot about The Avengers before I saw it. I read all of
the incredibly unfavourable reviews and the baggings and the outright
witchburnings.
   So I went into the cinema suspecting that I was about to endure one
of the worst films of my life. I *had* to see it, however. It was The
Avengers, based on one of the absolute best TV shows ever. (Alongside
Doctor Who, Star Cops and Blake's 7, incidentally. Let's see them
adapt those last two in Hollywood...)
I was surprised.
   I was very surprised, and to a very large degree I was delighted.
   First up, however: much of The Avengers is not very good. Sean
Connery is downright awful, the editing is jumpy and distracting and
the direction and timing flat and off-key.
   On the other hand, it boasts a wonderful script that delightfully
echoes the original (particularly in an early scene between Steed and
Mrs Peel driving to DeWynter's estate). Ralph Fiennes, while perhaps a
little uncomfortable in such a simple role, generally convinces as
secret agent John Steed and Uma Thurman is wonderful as the cat-suited
Emma Peel.
   Some brilliantly surreal scenes and ideas go towards presenting a
highly enjoyable movie indeed. True, it's buried under a thin layer of
crap, but the quality is in there nonetheless.
Mixed, but highly enjoyable. Particularly the teddy bears.

Cast:  Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, Sean Connery, Jim Broadbent.
Screenplay:  Don Macpherson.
Producer:  Jerry Weintraub.
Director:  Jeremiah Chechik.
This is the worst movie I've viewed so far in 98. THE AVENGERS = silly =
man dressed in a bowler hat + woman wearing tight leathers > evil
scientists dressed in teddy bear suits + greater evil, Sir August De
Wynter wearing kilt. The question is what could have gone wrong with a
potentially great idea with big name cast? The same question was
probably asked of last year's stinker BATMAN and ROBIN. I feel the
production got a little too smug, the script a little to smart and
direction was somehow lost in the chaos of random events that collided
together to form a movie.
My greatest criticism rests on the fact that there was no chemistry
between Emma Peel and John Steed (Thurman and Fiennes)  something that
was a vital element of the 60's TV serial of the same name. The dialogue
goes on and on about tea and other finer British perks, but does not
allow much room for character development and interaction, except to
perhaps grate on the viewer's nerves. One wonders why the dynamic pair
bother kissing in the end except for pure English formality. Connery as
Sir August, does not fair better than Thurman or Fiennes. His dialogue
is as erratic as stormy weather, mostly embarrassing and poor quality.
If there is a movie you would prefer never to see, I believe THE
AVENGERS would be a good choice. For one thing, you will not have to
witness a product that is far inferior to the three high profile names
that is associated with the title. I cannot understand how something so
poorly produced could have been released, but I put it down to one of
those freak happenings in nature, like lightning you can't see it coming
until it hits you.

      Be forewarned. 
    -------------------------------------------------------------
   At the end of the day, those reflecting upon the debacle that is THE
   AVENGERS would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on
   the horizon for the project well before Warner Bros. made the
   contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped
   plans for a gala premiere.  This highly-anticipated film rendition
   of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early June
   opening, where it would have gone head-to-head against the rival
   studios' heavy hitters; its eventual demotion to a less potent
   mid-August opening was an obvious early indication of the studio's
   lack of confidence with the picture.
   And with good reason.  This is a joyless exercise of a film, held
   together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of
   excitement, thrills or wit.  Remarkable in its banality and brutally
   uninvolving, THE AVENGERS is a catastrophic mess which immediately
   invites comparisons to last year's case study in style over
   substance, Joel Schumacher's much-loathed BATMAN & ROBIN.  (Indeed,
   both films even feature appalling, ridiculous sequences which find
   central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes.)
   Uma Thurman, who takes on the salacious role of the catsuit-clad,
   karate-chopping Emma Peel immortalized by Diana Rigg, was the only
   bright spot in the aforementioned Schumacher disaster, imbuing her
   Poison Ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences
   something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage.  Unfortunately,
   the same can't be said here, where she and cohort Ralph Fiennes (our
   new John Steed, taking over for Patrick Macnee) demonstrate no
   appreciable chemistry whatsoever, fatally crippling the picture as
   they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade
   double-entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully
   aware that they're on board a sinking ship.  At this rate,
   usually-splendid actor Mr. Fiennes may never make the transition from
   Arthouse Apollo to mainstream leading man -- his tepid turn here will
   make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the
   regrettably-neglected Kathyrn Bigelow film STRANGE DAYS.
   The duo *look* the part -- and admittedly THE AVENGERS is, more than
   most, heavily dependent upon style -- but they're no fun to watch,
   and I found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the
   lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they
   navigated through the picture's caper-esque plot.  When not checking
   my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat, I began to alleviate
   the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the
   filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile EMMA as our Mrs.
   Peel -- no, not Kate Beckinsale (although the notion now intrigues
   me), but Gwyneth Paltrow, who was originally in the running for the
   part and can veritably handle a spot-on English accent.  If nothing
   else, it'd at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight
   of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt.
   The story, such as it is, involves the ever-bemused tandem of Steed
   and Peel combating the malevolent Sir August de Wynter (Sean
   Connery), an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the
   nation with his climate-controlling contraption.  (They also sip a
   lot of tea.)  Overlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky
   hijinx involving our protagonists' superiors, it sounds far better
   than it plays, and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant
   post-production tinkering; it's clearly evident that the picture has
   been cut to shreds.  THE AVENGERS was never about gripping drama, and
   our heroes accordingly never take villainous Sir August very
   seriously, but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of
   menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac, it's all decidedly
   uncompelling.  Mr. Connery, who's onscreen barely long enough to
   register an impression, approaches the role like a man fulfilling a
   contractual obligation, simultaneously chewing the scenery while
   unable to hide his disinterest.
   At least it all looks good.  This is a genuinely handsome production,
   with fine costume design by Anthony Powell and crisply shot by Roger
   Pratt.  In particular, the gleaming production design by Stuart Craig
   commands attention, adeptly drawing elements both old and new in
   order to depict this Great Britain.  There are a handful of striking
   visual moments in the film, including an attack by a swarm of giant
   robotic bees and a nice shot of Steed and Peel finding a way to walk
   on water, but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these
   instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates.  By the time
   the film's climax had arrived, my interest was not with the sight of
   Steed and Sir August slugging it out amidst crashing waves and
   thundering rain, but with the quickest escape route from the theatre.
   Not coincidentally, the enticing bits of visual bravura were the
   shots assembled into the movie's remarkable trailer, a savvy piece of
   work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature
   film itself; the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is
   probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year.  It's
   everything that THE AVENGERS is not -- saucy, clever, engaging, and
   entertaining.  A crushing disappointment, the film is one of the
   worst outings of the year -- too drearily awful to be savoured as
   gleefully bad, too polished to overlook its deficiencies.  There may
   be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than THE AVENGERS,
   but I sure hope not.

Plot: John Steed, an agent for The Ministry, is assigned to keep an eye 
on Emma Peel, a lithe and beautiful  meteorologist, suspected of 
breaking into The Prospero Program - something she denies. Together the 
two form a partnership to take on the crazed Sir August de Wynter, a 
Scotsman who has harnessed the Prospero Program and is creating weather 
havoc to force the nations of the world to each give him ten percent of 
their GNP.
The Avengers' tv series (1962-9) was the height of 1960s chic. It 
jumped on the vogue for spy films started by the James Bond series but 
gave it its own surreally droll British manneredness - its two agents 
engaged in deliberately unreal adventures where they seemed more 
concerned about the champagne getting above room temperature than they 
were about imminent danger. The series began less flamboyantly in 1961 
as a routine black-and-white policier called Police Surgeon' where 
Patrick MacNee's Steed was only the sidekick to Ian Hendry's title 
doctor. But in 1962 MacNee was promoted to the star of the show, the 
series renamed The Avengers' and the rest is history. The first few 
seasons which paired MacNee with Honor Blackman (and for about six 
episodes at the very beginning nightclub singer Venus Smith played by 
Julie Stevens) were still standard police stories. It wasn't until the 
arrival of Diana Rigg in 1965 that the series became what it is known 
for today with the police stories supplanted by a surreal, cartoon 
universe of mad scientists and British imperturbability and Rigg 
outfitted in leather bodysuits and mini- skirts, a combination that 
turned the show into a cult phenomenon. The series was killed off in 
1969 with Rigg's departure and her disastrous replacement by Linda 
Thorson who substituted Rigg's sly flirtatiousness for a vacant 
airheadedness. The series was briefly revived as the underrated The New 
Avengers' in 1976-7 with a leggy Joanna Lumley making for a lithe and 
sexy agent that rivalled Diana Rigg for on-screen class.
The Avengers' is now the latest to be revamped in the current fad for 
big screen revivals of 1960s tv series,  following the likes of 
Mission: Impossible', The Saint', Lost in Space', The Beverly 
Hillbillies', the Addams Family' movies and the upcoming revivals of 
The Mod Squad', Bewitched', My Favourite Martian' and Gilligan's 
Island'. One could sense long in advance that the project was going to 
be a disaster in the happening. First their was the initial planned 
castings of Mel Gibson as Steed and Nicole Kidman as Mrs Peel. (Is there 
really an actor whose persona is less suited to the part of the 
perfectly mannered gentleman Steed than Gibson ? I was kind of holding 
out for Charles Dance and Emma Thompson in the parts). And then their 
was the assignment of Jeremiah Chechik to the director's chair. Chechik 
made his debut with National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation' in 1989 and 
has yet to make a good film. Chechik's Tall Tale' (1994) was a film 
about Western legends like Pecos Bill and John Bunyan but fell flat 
because it seemed scared of and ended up trying to be everything else 
except a tall tale, while his next, 1996's Diabolique' disastrously 
tried to remake the classic 1955 French thriller Les Diaboliques' with 
an upbeat ending. Even The Avengers' distributors could see the film 
was going to be a disaster before it opened and conducted the almost 
unprecedented desperation measure of refusing critics any preview 
screenings on the grounds that "they didn't want the film unfairly 
compared to the original series". (I do hate to puncture the reality 
these guys seem to live in but you are selling a remake - you can't 
revive a tv series and then not expect critics let alone an audience to 
compare it to the original). And needless to say the film has been 
pilloried by critics and audiences alike and is already  being 
considered the biggest disaster of the year.
Certainly it is technically a well made film. The photography is lush 
and sumptuous and there is some fine model effects work and dazzling 
sets. And the film has certainly done its homework when it comes to 
studying the series and copying everything from Mrs Peel's costumes to 
outfitting Steed with his vintage Bentley and steel-capped bowler hat 
and Mrs Peel with her MGB. It even gets full marks for quoting the 
series' explanation of what happened to Mr Peel.
But for all that it is really a rather sad film. All the droll British 
understatement comes far too posed. The jokes about Steed's impeccable 
coiffure, tea drinking, macaroons and brollies, the unflappable cool in 
the midst of danger - are all set up as obvious gags. But the effect is 
less one of droll wit than it is of affected retro-chic - it is like a 
funny incident that loses its spontaneity in the retelling.
The casting has tried hard but ends up a disaster. Ralph Fiennes tries 
to do a droll Steed but comes out more like a bland, colourless Oxbridge 
fop, while Uma Thurman's Mrs Peel is wooden and vapid, lacking in any of 
Diana Rigg's teasing flirtatiousness. Sean Connery delivers one of the 
worst performances he has ever given, reduced to slavering and lusting 
over Uma.
And the plot verges on the completely disjointed. It seems to have been 
constructed out of sequences that somebody thought was cool - Mrs Peel 
trapped in an M.C. Escher-modelled house (clearly an echo of the episode 
The House That Jack Built'), an attack by robot insects, a really daft 
scene where a group of conspirators meet dressed as teddybears - but 
these are like incidents that just seem to happen without any connecting 
sensibility. A clone of Mrs Peel runs about for half the film without 
even any explanation as to what she's doing there. Even the initial 
assignment Steed is given has a thorough vagueness to it - he is merely 
assigned to keep an eye on Mrs Peel and this somehow instantly becomes 
an investigation into Connery's super-villain. It is sad that the film, 
for all the technical care that has been clearly lavished on it, can 
miss the mark so widely when it comes to the fundamentals and above all 
capturing the panache that made the series so memorable in the first 
place.

By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (nate@pyramid.net)
My opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors I
love.  I love Ralph Fiennes.  I love Uma Thurman.  I love Sean Connery. 
Hell, I'm even a big fan of Jim Broadbent and Fiona Shaw.  I saw the
fantastic preview for The Avengers nearly eight months ago, and I've
been eagerly awaiting the film ever since.  A few months into the
summer, however,  I noticed that its release date had been changed a few
times, and that it had ended up in the mid-August dumping ground.  Then,
in this final week before its official release, I learned that it was
not to be screened for critics.  And that the actors had not been
plugging the film on late night programs.  And that it was directed by
the same man who brought us the remake of Diabolique.
My expectations fell to pieces when I learned all of these things.  The
film I saw today didn't even meet those expectations.  This is a lousy,
incoherent mess.  I would slam it harder, if it weren't for the nifty
sets and the mere presence of all these fine, lovable actors.  But sets
are ultimately empty, and the performances are completely uninspired. 
That's the main problem with The Avengers:  for all it's hip-hop flash
and tidal waves, none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired. 
It's like a chore, a bland exercise in superhero film making.  It also
feels like its been cut to pieces, clocking in at 90 minutes and
forgetting to close some of its own subplots.  This is just plain
depressing.
The Avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show. 
Frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that I've never
watched an episode.  I wasn't alive then.  I don't even watch television
now.  I'm very sorry that I don't have this perspective, but, judging
from the reviews I've already read, knowing the TV show just makes
matters worse.  I didn't know and love John Steed and Emma Peel, and
therefore I was not as upset to see how these Actors I Love have managed
to thrash their roles.  
I also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to
understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this
film.  Based on what the film told me, I gather that Steed (Fiennes) is
some kind of British super guy (somewhat like James Bond), and that Dr.
Peel (Thurman) is just a really smart doctor, who also happens to know a
lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight
leather suits.  They are to work together, under Mother's orders (Mother
is played by jolly Jim Broadbent, while his co-conspirator, Father, is
played by the equally-talented Fiona Shaw).  
It seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather.  His
name is De Wynter (Connery).  He is a crazy Scottish guy.  Our heroes
had better stop him, or else . . . the weather will keep getting colder
until they "have to go to hell to warm up" (one of the film's few funny
lines).  Along the way there is subplot after subplot, hinged sloppily
together by scenes that go nowhere, feel perfunctory, and ultimately
make no sense.  
For example, our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant
mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos.  Now,
killer bugs don't really go with the weather-controlling theme of the
film.  The purpose of the bugs, other than to annihilate our heroes, is
never established.  They're never even directly connected to De Wynter
(they're controlled by his crazy henchman, played by Eddie Izzard).  The
special effects aren't bad, but they're loud, obnoxious, and intrusive. 
Like so many scenes in the film, it seems present only to keep your
attention from waning.
And I guarantee you, it will wane.  I stopped thinking about the story
when I realized it didn't do any good to think.  The Avengers has
clearly been chopped up and re-assembled so many times that even the
people involved couldn't tell us what happens.  There are several scenes
in the preview that didn't make the final cut.  In addition, many of the
sequences have irritating, grainy film quality, which makes it feel
low-budget (the last scene is particularly bad).  The scenes that don't
feature action should be electric, thanks to our wonderful cast.  They
aren't.  The action scenes should be electric, because this is an action
film.  They aren't, either.  
And what about this wasted cast?  Oh, it makes me weep with
disappointment.  We're talking Ralph Fiennes here, one of the best
actors working today, one of the best actors *ever*.  I love the guy. 
I've loved all his films, until this one.  He seems like he wants to
understand the film, but he's as lost as we are.  And Thurman, in all of
her spectacular beauty and talent, can't manage to look at home here. 
(I don't blame her completely, for there is a strange subplot involving
her evil twin that is never explained in any way, and it can't be easy
to deal with such terrible screenwriting.)  Connery, however, seems the
most out of it, totally lacking any kind of focus, or interest, for that
matter.  
Who is to blame?  Is it the screenwriter, Don MacPherson?  Perhaps,
although I can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good
superhero movie had it been handled right.  Is it the actors?  For God's
sake, no -- these people clearly lost interest when they saw the
inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling.  I
blame director Jeremiah Chechik, who shouldn't have been given the task
to begin with.  His best film, Benny & Joon, is quirky in the same way
that this one was supposed to be, but here it mostly seems like a lot of
failed attempts at wit and humor.  Add to that a lack of experience in
big-budget action, and you have the worst choice for director this side
of James Ivory.
If The Avengers has a saving grace, it's the set design.  The sets (by
Stuart Craig) are big, colorful, and often pleasing to look at.  I like
the final set-piece, on De Wynter's island, even if none of it makes a
bit of sense.  I admired the overhead view of the stairs, showing Dr.
Peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere.  I also
enjoyed Michael Kamen's music score, particularly in the opening
credits.  But this stuff is routine -- good sets and music are nice, but
there's a lot more that needs to be here.  Inspiration, for instance,
would have been really nice.  Maybe a little bit of cohesion in the
story.  Or a sense of purpose.  Most of all, though, I would have liked
to see these actors relish in their roles.  Damn this movie for not
giving them the chance.

There are good pictures. There are bad pictures. And, every so
often, there's a truly wretched picture - like "Howard the Duck,"
"Ishtar," "Cutthroat Island," and "Heaven's Gate." Now, there's "The
Avengers." What went wrong with this $60+ million, big-screen
adaptation of the popular '60s British TV show? Let's start with Don
Macpherson's incoherent script, which not only lacks a plot but
strings together silly, elliptical quips that have no relation to each
other, the story, or the characters. Then, director Jeremiah Chechik
stages a fashion magazine shoot rather than a moving picture, posing
and displaying the actors like plastic department-store mannequins in
no particular context. Onto the casting...while Uma Thurman and Ralph
Fiennes are talented character actors, they lack charisma so,
inevitably, when paired, they lack chemistry. Dapper secret agent John
Steed and his sexy scientist sidekick, Emma Peel, were once terrific.
Now, they're zombie-like caricatures as they pursue a megalomaniacal
meteorologist who has invented a weather-controlling device. Sean
Connery, who can usually salvage any role, is reduced to bellowing
"Rain or shine, it's all mine!"  Some of Connery's scenes are quite
ludicrous, like when he holds a Board meeting with members disguised
as brightly colored teddy bears. As his henchman, Eddie Izzard
resembles a gum-chewing dropout from "Clockwork Orange." And Patrick
Macnee (the original John Steed) voices a bizarre cameo as an
invisible bureaucrat in the Ministry basement.  Basically, what was
supposed to be a light farce fails, the comedy collapses, the mystery
is muddled, and the dramatic impetus is non-existent since there is no
logic to the sequence of scenes. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to
10, "The Avengers" doesn't even warrant a 1. It's appallingly awful!

We saw this movie on a pre-release screening at the Open Air Cinema
Cinelac in Geneva in the original version with french and german
subtitles.
For any who might not know, the movie builds on a rather succesful 
British TV series of the 60's. While I have a few fond memories of 
watching the series years later on German TV, I do not remember it
well enough to state how close the movie is to the tone and style of
the original series.
All in all we enjoyed the movie quite a bit, laughing often at some
of the purposely over-the-top scenes and dialogue. Thinking too much
about the movie later is prone to lead to some disappointment though
as you realize the many possibilities to improve it.
I've read several bad reviews in the press and tend to think that they
are caused by overly high expectations. With its stellar cast, The Avengers
*could* have become a very good movie, but it isn't. On the other hand
in my book it is still a fair movie, quite up to par in enjoyment value
with many of the action flics one sees as mind candy from time to time.
Overall rating: +1 (Mark Leeper scale) for enjoyment, 0+ all in all.

Directed by Jerimah S. Chechick (Diabolique)
Starring: Ralph Finnes (The English Patient), Uma Thurman (Pulp Fiction),
Sean Connery (The Rock)
There's a little kid in all of us. My little kid is kept under triple locks
with a contingent of Marine guards with Bowie's, .45's, and M-16's outside.
Dressed in a straight jacket, banging itself against the padded walls of the
back of my mind, it has a desperate little voice screaming to be released.
To have fun, to wreak havoc with swordplay and find a friend to play cowboys
and Indians with. My inner child recent found a cohort to free it, and a
friend to play with, in the new release The Avengers.
Based upon a sixties TV, book, and film series (like last year's boring The
Saint), The Avengers is a spy film with a twist-- It goes for the gut of the
other spy films. I went into the theatre, and I wasn't looking for something
intelligent. I wasn't looking for something smartly scripted or original. I
wasn't even looking for something that has less cheese than a Green Bay fan
in January. No. I was looking for fun. And fun was what I received.
The Avengers is a spy movie that has a psychotic lemon twist and a cherry on
top, leaving you a bit shaken AND stirred by the rough 90 minutes of
havoc-wreaking fun. To surmise a plot in the regular equation style: Bad Guy
(Sean Connery), steals the machine of Sexy Scientist (Uma Thurman), which,
by the way, can control the weather, and Secret Agent (Ralph Finnes) has to
get it back. Oh, yeah, did I mention we've got a backdrop cast of characters
who leave you laughing by their names alone (i.e. Mother, the handicapped
man in charge of the super-secret agency "The Ministry", and his blind
female counterpart "Father").
Stick in a few action scenes and you've got your core audience hooked. But
the thing is, it takes you on a wild ride not with its action, which it
delivers in semi-modest quantities, but in its psychotic, surreal humor.
Ranging from evil villains dressed in teddy bear suits to helicopter bugs
half the size of a Volvo with machine guns and missile launchers, the events
rival the oddball characters in their bittersweet fun. It's cheese, but,
thank God, it's different cheese.

A few months ago I was ask by former director, now turned film critic, Alan
Smithee to be his backup advisor for the film The Avengers. The director,
Jeremiah S. Chechik, wanted to have a film critic on the set to advise him
what to do and what not to do. I found that Smithee was quite an ill man,
and therefore I found myself on the set of The Avengers more than expected.
This would have been great for a budding film critic like me, if it had not
been for a few problems.
Following is a script showing the few times that I was on the set of The
Avengers. All personalities are computer generated.

   People talk about the weather when they have nothing of
more import to say to one another.  In "The Avengers,"
inspired by the popular TV series of the 1960s, weather is the
only issue of consequence.  But when John Steed (Ralph
Fiennes) and Dr. Emma Peel (Uma Thurman) chat about the
weather, they do so not sluggishly, but looking each other
right in the eye. and fill their conversation with double
entenderes and with enigmatically symbolic body language. 
The two heroes, who in the TV series are needed from time
to time to save Britain from its malefactors, are preoccupied in
this case with destroying a rich man intent on bringing the
world to its feet.  They are absorbed as well with enjoying
continual cups of tea--he, with a twist of lemon.
   Jeremiah Chechik directs Don Macpherson's script in an a
surreal London; one whose streets are as clean as 
Disneyworld's: no ads, traffic, or supernumerary characters. 
The film has the look of a Magritte painting as reshaped by a
craftsman of a comic-book, its two leads clothed in styles as
different as their outlooks on life.  Brought together by a
honcho nicknamed Mother (Jim Broadbent) to challenge the
agenda of the villain, Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery),
Steed represents the ultra-traditional London of the 1960s
while metereologist Dr. Peel (Uma Thurman) depicts the city's
style in 1999.  Steed is dressed in a bowler with a smartly
tailored Sayville Row pinstripe suit; Peel prefers a catsuit that
clings to her well-shaped form and resmebles nothing less
than Batman threads.  
   The forty-four million dollar movie, which was not open for
advance critics' screenings, stresses neither the special
effects (which are exemplary) nor scenes of action and
violence (which are stylized and deliberately bloodless). 
Rather it relies on a hoped-for chemistry between Uma
Thurman and John Steed, who spend the one hundred
minutes largely trading silly snippets of intelligence and lame
sexual innuendos.  We are meant to wonder whether the two
take the time to consummate their verbal imputations but their
chemistry is so wanting that we leave the theater confident
that they are all talk and no action.  The sentences traded
between the dauntless duo are so short and fleeting, as
though to simulate a stand-up comedy act between straight-
man and punster, that their conversation soon becomes
annoying.  "I thought I was seeing double," Steed complains
after a nasty blow to the head.  "That makes two of us,"
responds the cool, cerebral Peel.  The two are so icy--they're
meant to be, actually--that you can picture them thriving in the
subzero climate planned and executed by arch villain de
Wynter.  De Wynter's repartee with his nemesis is of the level,
"Now, prepare to die," to which Steed responds, "Not yet."
   Occasionally the audience is challenged to recall a
fractured Shakespearean quote.  De Wynter, addressing an
audience of fellow-conspirators dressed in Teddy-bear
costumes to conceal their identities, announces, "Now is the
winter of their discontent."  When Peel and Steed peel the
costume from the head of a dead bear, Steed mourns, "Alas
poor Teddy," to which Peel parlays, "I knew him, Steed."
   Director Jeremiah Chechik tries to be all things to all
audiences: a Cubby Broccoli to the Bond fans, a Merchant
and Ivory to the sage.  In the first instance, he comes close in
one scene, that of a insect-helicopters which attack Steed and
Peel's fast-moving car in the glorious English countryside.  In
the latter, he comes up wanting.  Overall, those who never
saw any of the 1960s TV episodes will be as nonplussed a
congregation watching the movie "The X-Files" without an
analogous background.  Special agent Alice (Eileen Atkins),
made up to look like a dowdy old lady with the preferred
mind-like-a-steel-trap says, "The weather will get colder till
we'll all have to go to hell to get warmer." That's about as
sparkling a statement you're likely to get in a film that would
be OK as a 6 p.m. TV episode but simply does not come up
to the needs of a $44 million blockbuster.

The world is in chaos. Civilization is on the brink of destruction. It is
time for tea!
Warner Brothers delayed the release of this film until late summer, and for
good reason. In a year that has seen some of the most imbecilic and tired
plots ever projected on a theater screen, "The Avengers" hold true to the
adage of "those that do not remember the past, are doomed to repeat it".
The film opens with the introduction of John Steed, agent for the British
Ministry who handily manages through an obstacle course of assorted
assassins. Steed is then requested to see his superior, "Mother" (played
indifferently by Nicholas Woodeson) who has a special assignment for him.
It seems that a Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery) has gained control of a
weather control device (I won't go into details here, the film has enough
of them). With the aid of Mrs. Emma Peal (Uma Thurman), the creator of the
prototype for the device. Sir de Wynter's goal is to hold the world ransom
by threatening all the nations with destructive weather until they agree to
pay him his demand of 10 per cent of their gross national product each.
Needless to say, it is up to Mrs. Peal and Mr. Steed to save the day.
The above plot synopsis pretty much should give you all that you need to
know about the film. The entire enterprise is so bereft of suspense as to
be sleep inducing. This is not to say there are not some nice moments in
the film. An attack by mechanical insects is enjoyable in a silly sort of
way. But the sequence has no suspense or buildup. We never know where these
machines come from or how they came to be and why they were built in the
first place.
As the villain, Sir August de Wynter; Sean Connery gives what could best be
described as a lackluster performance. His mincing and grimacing is more in
line with Burt Reynolds in 'Stroker Ace' than anything else. It seems that
Mr. Connery has a unique method of informing his audience that he is not
taking his role seriously, and that method is the preponderance of him
lisp. Not since Boris Karloff uttered the famed line: "He has an irrational
fear of caths", in the film "The Black Cat" (1933), has a lisp been so
prominent.
Ralph Fiennes performance as John Steed is stiff and unappealing. The
performance couldn't have been blander if it had been dubbed. And Uma
Thurman proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that she is completely
uncomfortable with her sex symbol image. Her delivery of the numerous
sexual innuendoes which pepper Steed's and Peal's conversations, have all
the come hither appeal of a patient in a hospital asking a nurse for a bed
pan. There is absolutely no chemistry between these characters.
This brings us to the biggest question mark in the film. As De Wynter's
henchman, Eddie Izzard is, to be compassionate, the most non-threatening
screen villain seen since Tim Curry.  This presence (it in no way can be
called a performance) is so lacking in any quality whatsoever as to be
almost somnambulant. The climatic battle between Izzard's Bailey character
and Thurman's Mrs. Peal is almost as exciting and intense as a car wash.
The plot of the film is very abrupt, seeming to have been severely edited.
But, don't be confused into thinking that a restored director's cut might
improve this film. At 85 minutes, 'The Avengers' is one of the longest
films to sit through. Situations are dropped in without the slightest
advance, the equivalent of telling us the punch line but not the joke.
Admittedly, the art direction and visual effects are wonderful. But they
are photographed so unimaginatively that they don't really linger. Also,
one marvelously hilarious scene in which Mr. Steed is caught in an
artificial blizzard is the most absurd practical effect in the film. The
scene is shot in such a way as to completely reveal the artificiality of
the plastic flake snow. Also, with the budget allotted this film, you'd
except to see the actors breath in the freezing cold. Not here, Mr. Steed
actually has perspiration on his forehead.
The little tag line of mine at the start of this column sums up my entire
opinion of Jeremiah Chechik's updated version of that perennial British
television chestnut 'The Avengers'. There is a lot going on here in this
film. But ten minutes with a good warm drink is ultimately more satisfying.
On a scale on 5, "The Avengers' rates 1. Not as bad as this years worst
film (That remains Tristars 'Godzilla'), but a complete waste of all the
talent involved.

Cast: Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, Sean Connery
Previews: Virus, Pleasantville, Practical Magic, and that travesty of
cinematic justice known as Psycho:The Remake
Ever since I was old enough to appreciate them, the movie preview or
"trailer" as it is known, has always held a fascination with me.  They tease,
they taunt, they tempt, and they try to appeal to something in each
moviegoer, to make them come back to the theater to see it.  Sometimes (like
here) the trailers, are the best part of the movies.  I often get angry when
I miss them, or there aren't enough, or any, trailers attached to a movie.  I
have often stated here, some of the faults that I believe are made in the
trailers, and even the entire marketing campaign of a movie (maybe at some
point, I'll get around to writing my opinion on that in a seperate paper, so
I don't have to keep ranting incessantly in my reviews about them).  Since I
first saw the trailer for The Avengers (last winter, or early Spring, I was
hyped.        Between this, and The Mask of Zorro, my anticipation for summer
action movies was thoroughly piqued, quite early.  The preview is appealing,
action packed, spoofingly humorous, and generally well made.  It is just too
bad that that is all there is to this movie.  All the best parts are in that
preview, and what's left, is a mess
It seems that the makers of this movie, took the trailer, admired it, and
then realized they needed a movie to go along with it, so they pasted some
other scenes in (very sloppily, and inconsistently) and sent it out into the
world. This movie deserved so much better.  My expectations (which lowered
substantially by the refusal to prescreen, and rumoured lack of support from
Connery and Thurman) were still not met.  Now, I do have to say that this is
still not the worst movie of the summer, that title is deeply entrenched in
Big Apple devastation style, by both Godzilla, and Armageddon (with the
lizard winning by one big green nose).        It was nice to look at, had some good
effects. I did like the use and manipulation of the weather as the baddie, (a
stab at El Nino maybe?) but saving those things, I cannot recommend this
movie to others.
The performances, were cardboard, as was most of the movie.  I know it was a
spoof, or take off, of the old British series, for which I was not a fan, so
I cannot fairly compare.  But still, I cannot imagine the series being this
staid and dry.        Fiennes, and Thurman (both Oscar nominees) sleepwalk through
most of this movie, delivering lines with articulate perfection, but still
seeming like they're reading off cue cards, or conspicuously placed scripts. 
Connery (an Oscar winner, and cinematic icon) overacts, and seems not to
believe some of the lines he's reading.  I couldnt wait to see Connery play
the bad guy with his rogueish attitude that he's given his other action
roles.        I am still waiting.  The only truly watchable performance, is the
evil Marcel Marceauian act pulled off by British cross-dressing comedian
Eddie Izzard, who utters only one line, but exudes badness with that look. 
Maybe he should've been the bad guy here instead of Connery.
The Avengers had so much leeway, and room to play, but it could just never
get started.  There were inconsistent scene transitions, pointless plot
details introduced, then dismissed.  There were just too many unforgivable
inconsistencies here to forgive, and yet, like the proverbial traffic
accident, you couldnt really take your eyes off it.  So much potential, so
poor of an execution.  Wait for this one on cable.  The summer movies are
limping home now..is it fall yet, I want Pleasantville, Apt Pupil, and What
Dreams May Come.  Please  ($$)

This is the film that cost $60 million to produce, and earned only $25
million at the domestic box-office. Check. This is the film that had a lot
of Hollywood actresses coveting the principal role of Emma Peel before its
release, and the same many thanking their lucky stars after the film came
out. Check. This is the film that was tagged "an absolute mess" by movie
critic James Berardinelli, and not liked as much by many others. Check,
check, check! So is it really that bad? Naaaaaaaah! Then again, I liked
HUDSON HAWK (7/10), so beware of what you may find in the paragraphs below.
PLOT:
Secret agent John Steed hooks up with one fine looking doctor in Emma Peel,
in an attempt to figure out what is happening to the world's weather system.
Believing that one Mr. August de Wynter is behind the whole conspiracy, the
duo set out to stop him and save the world from his meteorological
concoctions.
NOTE: I've never seen one episode of the old TV show, so I cannot base my
review on any of that. Besides, I like to rate a movie on its own merits.
CRITIQUE:
This movie's got a truckload of style, a bunch of funky fashions and mod
retro-fun, a decent amount of action, but less than I would have expected,
some cool special effects and slick gadgeteries, a quick runtime, but a
hole-filled plot line that's just too complex for its own good. There are
many things that just didn't work in this movie's narrative, but on the
whole, the film was fun for me because it offered just enough style, action
and humour, to allow myself to dismiss the entanglement of its plot. The
film was also very tongue-and-cheekish from the get-go, and laughed at its
absurdity as much as we were supposed to. Sure it had a lame bad guy in Sean
Connery. Sure the preposterous idea of one man controlling the world's
weather is ridiculous beyond mere words. But seeing that 90% of all action
movies that hit our movie screens nowadays have the suspension of disbelief
factor grilled up to the highest fantastical levels anyway, I didn't feel
like this movie asked for much more than just that.
This movie is bubble-gum for the style lovers, and a spit wad for those not.
It had a pretty cool spy-laced score, a bevy of wonderful set designs, and
many other original ditties to occupy my mind as it floated through this
90-minute festival of cotton candy. And if you really think that the plot is
overly complicated, just look at it this way: Peel and Emma= the good guys,
Mr. August de Wynter= the bad guy. Everything else is just pudding after
that. Now you may all think that I am reviewing this film positively because
I'm high on pot or something, or that my ground-level low expectations
elevated this sub-mediocre discovery to decent time. Well...maybe. The truth
is that I'm not high, but I certainly did go into this picture with the
lowest of expectations. But despite all that, I came out with a smile on my
face, and a pretty sweet flick in my noggin. Ocular junkfood for your eyes,
cloudy fodder for your mind.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Uma Thurman's full name is Uma Karuna Thurman. She recently married fellow
actor Ethan Hawke, and had his child on the 8th of July, 1998. They named
their child Maya Ray Thurman-Hawke (natch!). She was previously married to
actor Gary Oldman for a brief period between 1990 and 1992. Uma's dad,
Robert, is a professor of Asian religion, and named her Uma, after a Hindu
Goddess. He was also the first westerner to be ordained a Tibetan Budhist

Sean Connery once said that he thought that the James Bond movies were
stagnating and that Quentin Tarantino should direct the coming ones. He has
two small tattoos on his right arm. One says "Scotland forever", the other
"Mum and Dad". He got them when he enlisted in the British Navy at the age
of 16.
Sean Connery wore a toupee in all of his James Bond movies. He started
loosing his hair already at the age of 21. Privately and in most other
movies, he wears none.

Synopsis: 
The plot revolves around a failed weather project called Prospero, which
Mrs. Peel (Uma Thurman) once worked on. British agent John Steed (Ralph
Fiennes) joins Peel in investigating, and soon they stumble upon an evil
plot to rule the world. 
Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery) is their main adversary. Sir August
has a weather machine which can control the weather of any part of the
world, and he wants countries to pay him tribute so that he won't attack
local weather. Sir August also has a serious Mrs. Peel obsession; he
keeps her painted picture up in his room. An island fortress serves as
de Wynter's base of operations.
Will Steed and Peel storm the island fortress and defeat de Wynter?
Background: 
The original 1960s serial THE AVENGERS featured Patrick MacNee and Diana
Rigg as a crime-solving duo. MacNee was John Steed, a dapper veddy
British chap, and Rigg was Emma Peel, a young, pretty, insatiably
curious, mystery-loving platonic widow friend of Steed's. Together they
drove an open-buggy car around the English countryside with a kind of
devil-may-care confidence - - cheerfully drinking tea and solving cozy
mysteries. 
The 1998 version of THE AVENGERS attempts to update these two characters
for the 90s, giving us Ralph Fiennes as Steed and Uma Thurman as Emma
Peel.
Opinion:
If you're anticipating a sophomoric film, here's a hint: the bad guys
are dressed as stuffed animals, and wear big teddy bear costumes. The
dialogue seems very forced, and you can find better British accents in
THE PARENT TRAP.
Actually the problem with THE AVENGERS is predictability. Right in the
beginning, Steed and Peel visit de Wynter's palacial estate to solicit
his expertise on weather. They find that de Wynter's mansion grounds are
filled with dangerous weather anomalies, and Steed gets attacked.
So we know de Wynter is the bad guy. Instead of busting the guy, Steed
and Peel go chasing around, belaboring obvious clues which, of course,
point straight back to de Wynter by the movie's end. "Why didn't you
tell me about de Wynter?" says Steed to his informant (Patrick MacNee).
To which Jones replies, "You didn't ask."

Let me first get this out of the way.  I am deeply surprised at how a
film that has such a pleasingly inspired look and a cast of superb
actors can amount to such a summer dud.  There are plenty of things that
are wrong with this movie.  For example, before entering the theatre, I
noticed a synopsis of the movie sent from the movie studio which was
posted by the ticket counter.  It says that John Steed (Ralph Fiennes)
and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman), who are British super agents, were
investigating the murder of three other agents.  The odd thing was that
there were no such murders, the synopsis was completely wrong.
If you've seen any James Bond film, then you're already familiar with
the plot here.  British agents meet up with a deranged fanatic that is
bent on ruling the world. The villain, in a nice twist from his days as
the original James Bond, is Sean Connery playing evil aristocrat, Sir
August deWynter.  He formerly worked for the government and was one of
the instrumental scientists in developing the Prospero project, which
allowed a person to control weather.  If the worlds' leaders do not bow
down to him, he'll unleash Mother Nature.  And why is the filthy rich
deWynter doing this?  To perpetuate some philosophical dream?  As an act
of vengeance?  No.  Believe it or not, the answer is because he wants
MORE money.  He truly must be deranged.  Obviously, no thought went into
his motivations.
Much of this film seems bereft of thought and coherence.  Additionally,
we really feel nothing for the intrepid agents.  Valuing tea time almost
as greatly as saving the world, their demeanors come across as being so
nonchalant that it dampens any attempt to inject some energy into the
movie.  Indeed, there is this plastic-lawn-ornament sort of feeling that
wafts through the movie. 
I have a feeling that this movie was written by a very creative person
and a second-rate writer who, during the course of developing this
movie, never met.  Each was responsible for developing a certain aspect
of the film, and they decided to brush aside any continuity problems.
"The Avengers" is actually a slick-looking piece and offered some unique
sequences such as a climatic battle between Peel and an evil henchman
atop a series of high wires and an amusing chase sequence where the
agents are being pursued by mechanized giant wasps with machine guns in
their stingers.  And there was some great comic touches such as when we
see a high-level meeting among the bad guys who all must wear giant,
brightly colored teddy bear suits to hide their identities.  But even
this kind of costuming and the elaborate sets can't disguise the fact
that this is a poorly developed project.

With Hollywood's fascination with television series remakes, it is
surprising that no one has tackled The Avengers before.  The comically
cool spy adventure series seems like just the type of "franchise"
material usually sought by the studios.  However, franchise hopes are
likely to fade with the premiere of this awkward adaptation.
The Avengers for this big screen adaptation are the prim and proper John
Steed (Ralph Fiennes), who's as impeccable in his manners as he is
deadly in his combat. And then there's the brilliant, seductive and
dangerous Mrs. Emma Peel (Uma Thurman).
The film chronicles the meeting of the two Avengers.  Mr. Steed is
already part of the Ministry, a top secret British spy organization.
When England's weather-defense systems are sabotaged, Mrs. Peel is the
chief expert, and also the chief suspect in the crime.  She is paired up
with Steed to prove her guilt or innocence.
The villain in the film is played with relish by Sean Connery.  He
finally gets to play a Bond-ish villain in Sir August DeWynter, a
megalomaniacal Scottish lord with designs on controlling the weather.
Anyone familiar with The Avengers should know that the show had a
particular brand of humor, but the proceedings in the film are extremely
tongue-in-cheek, and at times get downright silly.  For instance, the
traditional villain-to-henchmen speech for anonymity's sake is here
played with all participants in giant teddy bear costumes.  It doesn't
make much sense, and the goofy antics are certain to displease anyone
expecting a straightforward adventure story.
The film seriously suffers from some horrendous editing.  Clocking in at
under ninety minutes, it seems that most of the expository material has
been cut, as well as many transitions.  The result is certainly fast
moving, but confusing and off-putting as well.
In the plus column, however, are the main actors.  All are guilty of
slightly (but appropriate) hammy acting, but they all seem to fit nicely
into their roles as well.  The supporting cast don't quite fare as well.
As leaders of The Ministry, Jim Broadbent and Fiona Shaw never quite
settle into their roles.  Eddie Izzard is never fully developed as Sir
August's Clockwork Orangish henchman.
There are plenty of moments in The Avengers which have a delightfully
surreal quality.  However, there are just as many scenes which go a bit
too far in their outlandishness.  At the same time, some very crucial
plot points breeze by, imperceptible in the clutter.
The Avengers is likely a little too bizarre for those expecting the
standard spy adventure.  It's not a horrible adaptation, but definitely
a flawed one.

THE AVENGERS  (USA-UK) no *  Directed by Jeremiah Chechik. Written by Don
Macpherson. Photography, Roger Pratt. Editing, Mick Audsley. Production
design, Stuart Craig. Music by Joel McNeely. Produced by Jerry Weintraub.
Cast: Ralph Fiennes (John Steed), Uma Thurman (Dr. Emma Peel), Sean Connery
(Sir August de Wynter), Jim Broadbent (Mother), Patrick Macnee (voice only
as Invisible Jones), Fiona Shaw (Father), Eddie Izzard (Bailey),Eileen
Atkins (Alice).
A Warner release.  90 minutes. PG.
In major film markets, i.e. big cities, the distributors of new movies
organize regular pre-screening for the press. The fact that there was none
for "The Avengers" loudly suggested that the film was a bomb. It is.
The new feature is taken from the eponymous, popular TV series that spanned
most of the 1960s and starred as investigators the duo of John Steed and
Emma Peel, respectively played by Patrick Macnee and (after the series had
started) Diana Rigg. Now Ralph is John and Uma is Emma. Or rather, try to
be and in so doing fail miserably. It is not merely a matter of miscasting
but one of mis-scripting, mis-directing, mis-conceiving and a hit-or-miss
attitude.
(Jeremiah Chechik  made his directorial debut with Christmas Vacation
(1989), one of the very best in the National Lampoon series. He followed
this up with the warm, intimate and offbeat Benny & Joon. I have not seen
(nor have many others) seen his Tall Tale: The Unbelievable Adventures of
Pecos Bill (1994). His next film, Diabolique (1996), was a big fiasco, a
remake of a French classic).
My familiarity with the TV series being modest, I asked a most reliable
informant and true enthusiast of the old programs for her reaction. Her
e-mail to me:
"TOTAL waste of time. Technique is out, technology is in. Wit is out,
weapons are in. Subtlety is out, special effects are in. Charming is out,
coy is in. Or, as one of my less talkative film instructors used to say
when judging student films: Travesty. Cut. Flunk. Next."
In the originals, in ways that oddly parallel those of Italy's neorealist
films of the 1940s, restrictions imposed by low budgets were a
blessing--they obliged the makers to use imagination and to concentrate on
characters and dialogue. On the contrary, the 60-plus million dollar
feature production is a bloated mess. The film retains the old look of an
eerily empty England but stuffs it with expensive, technical gimmickry that
goes nowhere.
Steed, still impeccably dressed like a City banker, is  an operative for
the Government agency known as "The Ministry."  He is assigned Mrs. Peel as
a partner. Their task is to undo the evil project of  Sir August de Wynter
(Sean Connery), a billionaire super-scientist who lives in an eye-popping
estate (Blenheim Palace was used), can change the weather at will, and
bring on tornadoes, rain,snow and ice. Why he does this is as clear as
slush, until, much later, when he appears, all dolled up in  Scots regalia,
before an august audience to blackmail the nation. "I want 10% of your GNP,
otherwise I'll freeze out the United Kingdom."
Why the fabulously wealthy Sir August wants all those riches is
unexplained, except for the movie being peppered (but un-salted and
un-spiced) by James Bondian characteristics. But at least in the Bond
flicks the villains had specific purposes, whereas here there is not even
the facile alibi of a  Mad Scientist.
I will spare you (and myself) details, all of which are dumb, all of which
contribute to the total incoherence of the non-plot. There is a great deal
of action that signifies nothing and keeps adding to the confusion and
disorientation. Again, far too much of it comes from comic-book treatments
of James Bond episodes, but so lacking in continuity or sense that they
make Agent 007's adventures look positively Cartesian in their logic.
The story's holes are mega-crater-sized. Sean Connery's attempts at being
suave fall flat. Unlike the TV series, the flirtatious, bantering, repartee
and zingers between Steed and Peel have now degenerated into pedestrian
sentences, leaden phrases, and un-sexy glances. The excessive banter - like
all else - is so keen on being cute that boredom sets in from almost the
start of the movie.
In the old series, less was more. In this jumble, more is more. The makers
seem inebriated with visuals that are either deja vu, totally unconvincing,
mostly gratuitous or all of the above. Only a tiny amount of good special
effects ( like a swarm of insect-like helicopters pursuing the heroes' car)
hold your attention.
On the infinitesimally meager side of little plusses, Uma Thurman's British
accent is fine for American ears, though no doubt some Brits will cavil.
She does what she can given the catastrophic context, even though she lacks
she brainy sexiness of Diana Rigg. Ralph Fiennes' real talent, here buried
under the debris, results in an indifferent presence.

While The Avengers television series was cheeky, stylish and sexy, its
big-screen descendant is listless, plodding and as steamy as a
brother-sister prom date.
 After seeing this turkey, it's understandable why the studio decided to
keep it under wraps until the last possible moment.
 It's a total misfire. The script is weak, the continuity choppy (probably
from slicing the film from its original two-hour length to about 95
minutes), and the actors seem to lack any concept of how to approach their
characters.
 Ralph Fiennes hasn't a clue to the character of secret agent John Steed.
While he can act the veddy, veddy English gentleman, he lacks that slight
twinkle in the eye, that subtle wink that Patrick Macnee brought to the
role, letting us know that he, too, was in on the joke.
 Uma Thurman works too hard at trying to be sexy, a feat that came almost
nonchalantly to Diana Rigg, the TV show's Mrs. Emma Peel. Unfortunately,
Thurman emits as much heat as a winter solstice.
 The movie's biggest crime, however, is the utter waste of Sean Connery as
deranged villain Sir August De Wynter. It takes an awful script and shoddy
dialogue to make Connery look bad on screen. Can you even remember the last
time Connery was so cinematically embarrassed?
 Basically, The Avengers stinks because director Jeremiah Checnik and
screenwriter Don Macpherson missed the point of the TV series. And because
of that, we all have to suffer.

     There's bad buzz, and then there's the the bad buzz which surrounded
THE AVENGERS, the kind that sounds like a swarm of Africanized bees after
a particularly vigorous hive-shaking.  Disastrous test screenings, it was
said, had led to a furious round of damage control, including multiple
re-shoots of the ending, a release date bumped to the dog days of August,
and forty minutes axed from the original running time.  A gratuitous
"f-word" had even been added to bump the rating from a PG to PG-13.  Then,
all the worst fears seemed to be confirmed when Warner Bros. announced
that no advance screenings would be held for the media.  How fulsome a
stink bomb could they be hiding?
     You may think you're ready for the possibility that a film could be
bad, but little can prepare you for something as pointless, smug and
misguided as THE AVENGERS.  Like the 1960s British television series of
the same name, it concerns a dapper secret agent named John Steed (Ralph
Fiennes) partnered by his employers at the Ministry with slinky but
dangerous Mrs. Emma Peel (Uma Thurman) to protect the world from evil.
Evil in this case takes the form of Sir August DeWynter (Sean Connery), a
disgruntled former government worker who now can control the world's
weather.  Thus is is up to Steed and Peel to save the world from
meteorological extortion, whenever they have time between rounds of
calculated badinage.
     It is the latter which proves most instantly and consistently grating
in THE AVENGERS.  Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman spend most of their scenes
together engaging in a smirk throwing contest, each one trying to look the
most amused with him or herself, eyebrows so prominently arched you're
afraid someone might sprain something.  This despite the fact that Don
Macpherson's dialogue is a study in witlessness, tossing out embarrassing
puns as though they were saucy enough to turn Oscar Wilde green with envy.
Though they generally appear content to let their wardrobe do most of the
acting for them, Fiennes and Thurman should be commended for one
impressive demonstration of dramatic skill:  they're able to treat the
most mundane comments as though they were nuggets of pure comic gold
bestowed upon the world.
     That kind of quip-heavy self-awareness was certainly true of the
namesake television series as well, so what's so wrong with this variation
on the theme?  In short, both the personnel and the context.  Patrick
Macnee and Diana Rigg, the most celebrated of the series' pairings, shared
a genuine chemistry which made the romantic tension fun to watch.  Fiennes
and Thurman appear far too enamored of their own charm and cleverness to
bother connecting with one another.  They're also dropped into a summer
blockbuster milieu entirely inappropriate for light-hearted capering.
Imagine an episode of the old "Batman" series with a $70 million budget,
and you'll understand what's so wrong with THE AVENGERS.  It's hard to
endear yourself to an audience with low-tech campiness at the same time
you're blowing something up every 10 minutes, or sending huge mechanical
insects after our heroes like something out of the speeder bike chase from
RETURN OF THE JEDI.
     We're long past the point of pretending that plot or character has
anything to do with 1990s-model Hollywood summer fare, so I won't even
bother slapping THE AVENGERS around for exhibiting symptoms of that
particular contagious disease.  But such a film has to give you something
to latch on to:  engaging performers, effective pacing, a decent villain
to hiss.  Not even Sean Connery, blustering about without the faintest
idea why his character does anything, can pump up the charisma quotient of
this tedious car wreck of a film.  The closest recent analog to THE
AVENGERS is BATMAN AND ROBIN, but at least BATMAN AND ROBIN had its sheer
momenteum and comic-book gaudiness to salvage it.  THE AVENGERS is just
action sequences in search of a movie, actors in search of a reason to
keep smirking.  Crimes against film audiences must be avenged; the buzz of
surly patrons coming out of the theater may be even more frightening than
the buzz on the film.

What an enigma.  It's 89 minutes of my life that I can't get back.  I
just can't figure out how such a skillful pair of performers like Ralph
Fiennes and Uma Thurman can let themselves be a part of such a mess like
'The Avengers'.  Even a veteran like Sean Connery looks awkward in this
film and let's face it, has Connery had a really GOOD film since 1990's
'The Hunt for Red October'?  Connery has made some bad decisions as an
actor like appearing in that horrible 'Highlander' sequel in 1991, and
now that I think of it, I wasn't that impressed with the first
'Highlander' movie in 1986 but such films like 1992's 'Medicine Man',
1993's 'Rising Sun' and 1995's 'Just Cause' all had potential but looked
more like they were cranked out in the usual Hollywood fashion in the
fast food section of motion pictures.
Warner Brothers refused to show the movie to critics a short time ago
before its major release and for good reason!  Of course, the usual
corporate line to put a spin on things, as voiced by one Warner
executive was that the reason why there was no previews beforehand was
because Warner Bros. was afraid that critics would compare it to other
films and to the original t.v. series.  Ha, ha, ha!  What an insult to
people's intelligence.  Ok, so I'll never work THERE.
Beginning with opening scenes that are relatively entertaining (the
first ten minutes had me watching hopefully), 'The Avengers' quickly
dissolves into another formula comic book style movie with lavish sets,
impressive costume designs and other forms of eye candy that can't hide
the fact that the film doesn't know which direction it's going in
because it doesn't know where it's been.  It's an abstract form of
so-called entertainment that wallows in the excessive boredom seen last
year in 'Batman and Robin' where an abysmal script and wooden direction
ticked off even the casual movie fan.
This big screen version of 'The Avengers' is based on the television
series from the 1960's which starred Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg.  The
series ran from 1961 to 1968 and Rigg came in in 1966.  Prior to that it
was Honor Blackman who starred along with Macnee.  In this version, John
Steed (Fiennes) and Dr. (Mrs.) Emma Peel (Thurman) are two highly
skilled British secret agents who are introduced to each other and are
given an assignment to work on a case involving the manipulation of the
world's weather.  Snow storms, twisters, warm weather, rain, lightening
and thunder are all present right behind each other in bizarre fashion
controlled by a mad scientist named Sir August de Wynter (Sean
Connery).  de Wynter's plot is to manipulate the governments of the
world into buying his weather, presumably the safe and normal kind and
if not, he says hundreds of millions will drown, burn, freeze etc.
Director Jeremiah S. Chechik ('Benny and Joon', 'National Lampoon's
Christmas Vacation') doesn't know what he's doing here.  He has no idea
where to take a movie and how to distinguish his characters from each
other and throw in his version of sub text like any creative director
would.  Screenwriter Don MacPherson's dialogue is pompous in an annoying
sort of way and his story development is about as slow as opening a can
of food with a manual can opener rather than by using an electrical one.
What's really disappointing about this version is the performance of Uma
Thurman as Peel.  In many ways, she sounds a lot like her Poison Ivy
character from 'Batman and Robin'.  In fact, if you were to blindfold
even the most high brow critic, it is my belief that he or she would
have a hard time distinguishing between the two characters.
Fiennes is wooden and his showdown with Connery in the film's climax is
laughably short, predictable and badly edited.  Every character in this
movie looks like they're reading their lines from cue cards.  The film's
continuity is also scattershot.  In a freezing blizzard, Steed and Peel
are speaking to each other and they aren't shivering and their warm
breath in contrast to the cold air isn't even visible!  One shot has
Steed taking off his hat which is covered with fake snow, and it looks
fake, and suddenly as the snow keeps falling, only a couple of flake's
manage to find their way onto his neatly combed head of hair.  DUH!
I recently read that original star Patrick Macnee actually approves of
this movie because Steed doesn't carry a gun like he never did on the
t.v. show.  Wow!  There's a ringing endorsement.  I'll take Dirty Harry
and his magnum or John McClane and his machine gun any day and in
keeping with the dignity of the English culture, I'm sure even the most
loyal British movie fan would be dying to rent a James Bond movie,
complete with guns and weaponry used stylishly by Connery and Roger
Moore after seeing this movie where Steed's trusty umbrella seems to be
lethal on his foes.
For fun with an umbrella, I recommend turning on any re-run of the
1960's television series 'Batman' and seeing Burgess Meredith "Wah, wah
wah!" his way through an episode as the Penguin, using his umbrella.
It's more enjoyable and entertaining than this turkey of a movie where
the real asset is...well, there really aren't any!
