When a 50 ft. woman demands sexual attention how can one say no, less
they be trampled on. Daryl Hannah, the timid housewife who becomes ten
storeys high, attempts to mend her marriage with her unfaithful husband
(Daniel Baldwin) with the sexual proposal of the decade. She asks him to
think of the immeasurable possibilities of making love to a 50 ft.
woman. To imagine the new horizons unexplored by mankind; that he would
be the envy of every man.
And I have decided that sex with a 50 ft. woman is a territory that is
best left uncharted. I have no sympathy for the unfaithful, sleazy
husband, but he is totally correct in freaking out. He yells, "What do
you expect me to do. Wear a rubber suit?". He doesn't mean a condom
either.
This movie empowers the psychologically abused, sexually deprived
housewife by making her grow to a size where argument with her is
futile. It would have been more rewarding to see this frightened, mousy
creature overcome her fears and problems as herself, and not as a
towering giant. We must realise that growing bigger doesn't necessarily
make our problems any smaller.
So we watch the fragile Daryl Hannah grow into a giant after being
zapped by an alien craft. Within minutes her clothes rip as the muscles
bulge, but somehow the bra seems to stay on. Now how did that happen?
After a domestic quarrel over sex, she is chased into the desert by the
US airforce. The helicopters are in much need of target practice, after
shooting a hundred missiles before one finally finds its mark. The giant
on the other hand has great difficulty swatting the flying machines,
which are small enough to rest in the palm of her hand.
The ending is pure feminist propaganda. The male chauvinistic pig is
made to spend an eternity caged, under the watchful eye of his giant
wife. She dictates the marriage now, and sex is no longer out of the
question.
