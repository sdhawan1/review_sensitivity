Deadlines should almost always be important in thrillers, and never in 
comedies. Yet screenwriters insist on letting all kinds of plots depend on 
them; not to provide suspense, because we know Hollywood heroes always get 
wherever they need to be in the nick of time. Nor to show how the characters 
react to the pressure, because it's usually just an excuse for gags. Only, I 
guess, because it's what they were told to do in screenwriting class.
"The Bachelor" is an excellent example, a film with a lot of good ideas that 
never sits still long enough for any of them to work. It should be a romantic 
comedy about a young man learning the value of true love, but wastes a lot of 
time showing him running around trying to beat the clock. He is Jimmie 
Shannon, the manager of a successful pool-table factory, who is in love with 
the perks of being affluent, youthful and unmarried.
But Jimmie (Chris O'Donnell) is getting anxious that he may have to give up 
this lifestyle. Now that almost all of his friends are married, and he's been 
dating the lovely Anne (Renne Zellweger) for three whole years, it occurs to 
him that she expects him to follow suit. He tries to pop the question, but 
obviously his heart's not in it, and Anne becomes so offended that she gets 
on the first train out of town for time alone with her understanding sister.
Then Jimmie discovers that his recently deceased grandfather (Peter Ustinov) 
has bequeathed $100million to him on the condition that he gets married by 
six o'clock on his thirtieth birthday. Wouldn't you know it, this news 
arrives on the day before, so it's a race against time for Jimmie's friends 
and lawyers to find Anne. In case they don't, Jimmie must seek out all his 
other ex-girlfriends to see if any of them are prepared to be his bride.
As he takes this wild journey through his past, which doesn't produce any 
favourable results, Jimmie of course comes to appreciate how much Anne really 
means to him. I wish it could mean something to the audience, but in a huge 
storytelling blunder, the couple's three-year history is spent entirely 
off-screen. Thus, we've only ever seen them when they've been fighting or 
awkward with one another, and we have no idea if we like them enough to want 
them to be united. O'Donnell and Zellweger are both attractive performers -- 
why aren't we allowed to find out whether or not they have any chemistry 
together?
Probably because the filmmakers have no confidence in any of their material, 
and perpetrate disastrous attempts to spice it up. The awkward climax 
features hundreds of people in expensive set-pieces, but isn't at all 
exciting or funny. Special guest stars such as Brooke Shields, Mariah Carey 
and Jennifer Esposito have been brought in to play the ex-girlfriends, but 
their presence is distracting. Even the beginning of the movie, which 
features a narration of potentially witty observations about bachelorhood, is 
ruined by a stupid special-effects accompaniment. Matters are not helped by 
O'Donnell speaking in a deliberately goofy manner to underline the fact this 
is a comedy.
It is Ustinov, though, who gives a really embarrassing performance, as a man 
with unexplained oddities of body language and speech. Hal Holbrook is pretty 
dreadful too, drifting in and out of an Irish accent, and chain-smoking 
cigars with the amateurish trepidation of a kid taking his first drag.
Aside from that, "The Bachelor" is an easy-to-watch film that held my 
attention. The soundtrack is wonderful, the structure is clear, the people 
and places look good. But all the way through I kept thinking that it could 
have been better, and wishing it would stop getting side-tracked by gimmicks. 
I must track down "Seven Chances", the Buster Keaton film it was inspired by. 
It was made in the 1920s, when they knew how to tell a story 
straightforwardly.

     I came to an epiphany while watching THE BACHELOR, an
innocuous-enough-on-the-surface romantic comedy. It's not the sort of film
in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity, but there it
was nonetheless. I sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold
when suddenly I realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire
romantic comedy genre circa 1999. In a word, it's the same thing that's
wrong with so many movies circa 1999: writing. More to the point, it's the
refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when you're telling a
story about a relationship. THE BACHELOR is merely the latest in a long
line of films where we're expected to get dewy-eyed over any pairing of
attractive, pleasant people just because they're attractive and pleasant.
     In this particular case, Attractive and Pleasant Exhibit A is Jimmy
Shannon (Chris O'Donnell), a single guy who has been watching his friends
slowly but surely sucked into marriage. It's a scary notion for Jimmy,
even though he dearly loves Attractive and Pleasant Exhibit B Anne (Renee
Zellweger), his girlfriend of three years. Convinced despite his
reservations that it's time to "sh*t or get off the pot," Jimmy proposes
to Anne -- very badly. Anne refuses, which leaves Jimmy in a very odd
position when his eccentric grandfather (Peter Ustinov) dies and leaves a
very specific video will. Jimmy stands to inhereit $100 million if he is
married by 6:05 p.m. on his 30th birthday, stays married for 10 years and
produces a child. There are only a couple of minor problems: 1) Jimmy's
30th birthday is the next day; 2) Anne is nowhere to be found, meaning
Jimmy has to find another willing bride from among his many
ex-girlfriends.
     It's a wacky, BREWSTER'S MILLIONS-esque premise (acknowledged as such
in one of the film's better, more self-aware lines of dialogue), the kind
where a shallow and materialistic guy learns What Really Matters. At least
that would be the case if Jimmy weren't already a world-class altruist.
Screenwriter Steve Cohen slides into the story an even more draconian
condition in the will: If Jimmy doesn't get married, not only will he lose
all the money, but the family billiard table buisness will be sold out
from under him, costing hudreds of jobs. From the outset, Jimmy's
motivation isn't cash; it's the livelihoods of his devoted employees. It's
almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role in THE
BACHELOR's plot development. By any human standard, the guy is impossibly
selfless.
     And that's the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like THE
BACHELOR -- the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their
way to happiness. There's never any tension between the two star-crossed
lovers, because there's no sense that anything remotely significant is at
stake. The blandly nice O'Donnell couldn't pull off a randy cad if he
tried, so the filmmakers don't even let him; Zellweger's Anne may have
issues with her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible standard
to live up to, but no one dares make her anything but the woman (lightly)
wronged. And forget about seeing enough of Jimmy and Anne together to feel
invested in their potential reconciliation. The parade of sit-com set
pieces had better be damned funny, since they're all that stands between
us and a blissfully sweet foregone conclusion.
     I'll admit a couple of those set pieces are amusing, including
Ustinov's rantings about procreation and a restaurant full-to-bursting
with men popping questions and champagne corks. Far more of them are
either tedious or downright ghastly, like the shudder-inducing sight of
Brooke Shields as an icy fortune-hunter or the hideous collection of
stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather in a church. You're
never going to get too many raucous belly laughs from a film like THE
BACHELOR, but that's not the real problem. Nor is it the real problem that
you know exactly the kind of warm-n-fuzzy conclusion it's leading up to.
The problem are a beginning and middle that are equally warm-n-fuzzy --
there's no spark, no energy, no humanity. It's an emotional pudding
guaranteed not to offend any consumer's digestions. We've reached a point
where our proxies for cinematic romantic wish fulfillment don't even have
a pulse. THE BACHELOR is love among the mannequins.

If "The Bachelor" didn't have a cast full of recognizable stars, I'd almost 
believe it if someone told me it was filmed on a different planet, using 
human-looking aliens to portray the characters. A childish romantic comedy 
that is aimed at teenagers and adults, it is difficult to believe anyone 
would like the film, for it is so shoddily executed and implausibly written 
that it inevitably leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. And here's some 
advice for Chris O'Donnell: when you disappear from the movies for over two 
years (not since the Golden Raspberry Award Winner "Batman and Robin," and 
not counting your brief role in last spring's "Cookie's Fortune"), you should 
probably choose a film that is actually good, so you can easily regain your 
stature. The fact that you also produced this rubbish leads me to seriously 
question your reliability.
Just the premise itself is thoroughly distasteful: Jimmie Shannon (Chris 
O'Donnell), a 29-year-old yahoo who is terrified of commitment, finds himself 
searching desperately for someone to marry him before his 30th birthday after 
his grandfather dies and leaves him $100-million in his will if he will carry 
out this wish, and stay married for 10 years. Complications ensue because his 
birthday is one day away, and his longtime girlfriend of three years, Anne 
(Renee Zellweger), has just broken up with him after a disastrous proposal. 
Gathering up all of his girlfriends from the past, Jimmie actually hunts them 
down and proposes to each and every one of them, forgetting about Anne and 
concerned only with getting money. Of course, he's going to realize that Anne 
is the only one for him, and that he's been a jerk, but just from watching 
the film, I believe Jimmie will always be a jackass and deserves to be alone 
for the rest of his good-for-nothing life. That's just my opinion, though.
"The Bachelor" resembles a direct-to-video movie at almost every ill-advised 
turn because of its overall air of moronic silliness. Comparing the journey 
from bachelorhood to marriage, to a group of wild racing horses may be an 
inventive analogy, but in the context of this film, it falls to the ground 
with a big, loud "SPLAT!" Its romantic capabilities are also all there, 
because Chris O'Donnell and Renee Zellweger are charming performers, but 
O'Donnell's character is too despicable to root for, and his relationship 
with Zellweger too slapshot to be believable.
The screenplay by Steve Cohen is almost haphazardly bad, with its vacuous 
characters and repellent plot, but does manage a few fleeting glimpses of 
inspired humor. The scene in which Jimmie proposes to Anne at the Starlight 
Room is very funny, with Jimmie's reasoning for marriage being, "sh** or get 
off the pot." A handful of cameos (Mariah Carey, Jennifer Esposito, Stacey 
Edwards) as potential brides are littered throughout, but they come off as 
more of a missed opportunity than anything. That is, except for the vignette 
involving Brooke Shields, who gives the most finely tuned comedic performance 
in the whole film, as the money-grubbing, chain-smoking Buckley. In her quick 
5-minute part, Shields sparks the film out of its comatose state, and for 
that, I am thankful.
Littering the rest of the curious cast are a group of veteran actors (Edward 
Asner, Hal Holbrook, James Cromwell, Peter Ustinov) who are there for little 
more than window dressing, and never develop their similar roles into diverse 
characters; Artie Lange (1998's "Dirty Work"), as Jimmie's best friend; and 
Marley Shelton (1998's "Pleasantville"), as Anne's younger sister, who gives 
the only likable supporting performance. Most of Zellweger's scenes are 
actually with Shelton, and they have a sort of chemistry that is lacking 
between Zellweger and O'Donnell. 
The film reaches its climactic pinnacle when Jimmie finds himself being 
chased through San Francisco by a mob of potential brides after a story on 
him runs on the front page of the newspaper with the heading, "Would You 
Marry This Man For $100-Million?" Lifted directly from its inspiration, the 
1925 Buster Keaton screwball comedy, "Seven Chances," this scene is a visual 
treat, but when you start to put reasoning behind it, it becomes more 
apparent how very stupid it really is. 
At the last minute, Jimmie and Anne rekindle their flame, but one must ask 
why Anne would even remotely want to marry him. Renee Zellweger, so 
delightful in 1995's "Empire Records," 1996's "Jerry Maguire," and 1998's 
"One True Thing," tries out a noticeably more lighthearted film here, rather 
than all of the heavy movies she has made of late, but her Anne never is able 
to break out of just being "The Girl." Besides, Anne's IQ drops in the final 
fifteen minutes, as she races to find Jimmie and marry him. Why would she 
want to do such a thing? Jimmie proves throughout that he is a commitment-shy 
lunkhead, and the fact that he would even try to forget about Anne and marry 
someone else for the money just reveals how truly shallow a person he is. The 
fact of the matter is, Jimmie is a character with next to no redeeming 
qualities, and he and Anne finally getting married at the end signifies to me 
a depressing conclusion, rather than a happy one. Using some common sense, it 
is clear Jimmie is neither mature nor reliable enough for marriage, and Anne 
is headed for a miserable ten years, followed by a swift divorce.

Actor Chris O'Donnell took a two-year hiatus from showbiz after his last
disastrous cinematic entity, better known to many as BATMAN & ROBIN, and
dedicated most of that time to getting rid of his own designation as
bachelor, by marrying his long-time love, Caroline Fentress. They recently
had a baby daughter, named Lily Ann, so Chris is just about ready to become
a bachelor again...well, at least on film.
PLOT:
A lifetime bachelor cannot seem to get the proper motivation to ask his
three-year girlfriend to marry him. Unfortunately for him, his grandfather's
will provides him with only 24 hours to get married in order to receive his
$100 million dollars fortune. If he does not get married within that time
frame, he will get nothing.
CRITIQUE:
Add this film to my list of "not good enough to recommend" romantic comedies
from the past year which includes YOU'VE GOT MAIL, NOTTING HILL and RUNAWAY
BRIDE. Every one of these films seemed to include a tailor-made script idea
which might've read nicely on paper, but ultimately lacked the proper
"oomph", once produced and presented onto the big screen. Big stars and a
catchy concept do not a romantic comedy make. A film would require romance
and humor for that designation. This film essentially suffers from a
lackluster script which actually starts off on a fun note, but quickly
dissolves into many unfunny scenarios featuring the "bachelor" in question
chasing after his ex-girlfriends in the hopes of marriage. Very little humor
shows up in any of these scenes. Isn't it also interesting how every single
one of his ex-girlfriends apparently had completely different qualities
about them? Usually folks tend to go out with people with reasonably similar
characteristics, but not our boy! Toss that in with a distracting 10-second
cameo from singer Mariah Carey, whose part is all but shown in the
commercials of this film, and Brooke Shields attempting to be funny, and you
see where I'm going with this.
It's too bad because O'Donnell is actually pretty good in this film as your
standard Joe Schmoe "afraid of commitment" guy, and some funny scenes do
make an appearance near the end of this film (I'm sorry but the sight of all
those brides in the church was pretty funny...). But all in all, the film
lacked the overall comedic elements needed for a hearty recommendation for a
visit to the theatres. O'Donnell's sidekick Lange is just as annoying in
this film as he was as the sidekick in LOST & FOUND (5/10) and DIRTY WORK
(5/10), and the romance element is also quite weak. This is nothing more
than your typical "video movie", the type you'd rent on a slow night, after
a hard day's work when you and your love-hubby just want to sit around, shut
off your brains for an hour and a half and snicker at a couple of clever
moments. It's also the type of movie which leaves very little to discuss
once done, and might actually be appreciated more by men who themselves are
afraid to commit (the whole Mustang horse analogy was kinda funny).  Light,
safe, funny in some moments, tired and unfunny in others, recommended on
video only.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Chris O'Donnell's friends call him "OD", and his middle name is Eugene. He
also co-executive produced this film (his first) and garnered his first role
on the big screen in 1990's MEN DON'T LEAVE. He got his start in a
McDonald's commercial.
Renee Zellweger's friends call her "Zelly". I suppose this fact is widely
known by now but Renee does bear an uncanny resemblance to singer Jewel.
Renee's mom is Norwegian and her dad, Swiss.
Near the end of the film, a woman who wants to marry the bachelor claims to
have a "degree from Princeton, just like Brooke Shields!". A cute reference
to the actress who plays Berkley in this film. Speaking of Princeton, word
on the street is that Brooke once dated TV's "Superman" Dean Caine, while
both were attending the prestigious University. Her full name is Christa
Brooke Camille Shields.
It is through the help of the Internet, that costume designer Terry Dresbach
stumbled across one Phyllis Kelley's "Brides to Be," a retail bridal
consignment store in Glastonbury, Connecticut. Phyllis had over 800
different wedding dresses stored in her home that she was ready to sell off
for one lump sum.
This film is a remake of the 1925 Buster Keaton silent film called SEVEN
CHANCES.
This is screenwriter Steve Cohen's first produced screenplay.

[filmcritic.com presents a review from guest writer Bradley Null.  You

http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/26de22cbfc3e38508825681f000d08c0?OpenDocument
There are two types of comedies coming out of Hollywood today:
adult-oriented star-vehicles and teen-oriented ensemble pictures. You
can say what you will about the preponderance of whining, post-modern
`Dawson's Creek' reprises stocking our airwaves and movie theaters, but
you can't say much at all about the vacuous one-trick pony known as the
modern Hollywood romantic comedy.  So I will keep my comments on THE
BACHELOR brief.
In full, the plot of THE BACHELOR is that Chris O'Donnell has 27 hours
to tie the knot, which would assure him of a $100 million inheritance
and cozy jobs for life for himself and all of his friends.
Unfortunately, he already monumentally botched his proposal to his
girlfriend, Renee Zellweger (I won't bother with character names here; I
didn't remember them, you won't either).  Wacky high-jinks ensue, and we
all hope desperately it will work out for the best between Chris and
Renee.
If you've seen the trailer for this movie, you've already sapped all of
the sentiment that you're going to get out of this vehicle.  In its
feature length form, THE BACHELOR throws in some awkward voice-over, a
trite recurring dream sequence wherein O'Donnell imagines himself a
mustang, and an apparently mute James Cromwell.
In a word, THE BACHELOR is insignificant.  No characters, no depth, no
theme, no message.  Even its intended witticisms fall flat.  (And by the
way, James Cromwell's *got* to say something.  He's the best actor in
the film.)
It's sad that the only comedies starring actors old enough to rent a car
these days can't seem to make it beyond a sales pitch.  Sadly, the
studios seem to think that a catchy plot point is more important than an
interesting plot.  Is this what the dumbing down of America has come
to?  I sure as hell hope not.  Wake up, America!  You deserve better
than this.

Wild Mustangs rage free across an open field providing visual symbolism of
the bachelor's yearning for independence and variety of grasslands upon
which to graze. Crude as it may be, the analogy charges on. By the end of
the film, the steeds become brides chasing down one lone bachelor as he
darts like a terrified doe from a pride of hungry lions.
The pictorially spectacular intro and conclusion form an elegantly
impressive ring box which unfortunately contains a less than precious
romantic comedy, that at times is not comedic and even less often romantic.
Chris O'Donnell is TV perfect, but big screen short. Renée Zellweger does a
better job of fitting the bill. While Brook Shields blows them both out of
the water with her short cameo.
A stampeding horse, the film leaps strongly from the gate, yet the downtimes
between the admittedly strong laughs steadily increase as the reels
progress. Two weak supporting actors also contribute to mid-movie drag. This
could have been due to talent direction as few potent acting moments make it
to the screen.
Cutting to the chase, long time bachelor (O'Donnell) falls in love with
equally independent Zellweger; however as the relationship nears "poop or
get off the pot," the bachelor just isn't ready to ... well ... poop. Still
funny at this point, O'Donnell's flawed proposals are truly humorous. Then a
flagrantly contrived 100 million dollar inheritance (which will be lost if
he doesn't marry in 27 hours) leads to a less than compelling series of
finance inspired proposals to his dwindling list of past lovers.
Ultimately light and cute, the middle had me checking my watch.

Well there goes another one. Sadly this like other movies this year wasn't
good. This one being almost as bad as 'The Omega Code' but not quite. From the
opening credits I had a good feeling this would be bad, and well I guess I was
right. With bad excuses for acting, a horrible screenplay and straight-out bad
direction 'The Bachelor' is a terribly unfunny movie that doesn't work on any
levels accept that fact that Rene Zellwegar who does give a good performance.
The two cameos by Brooke Shields and Mariah Carey are also good with Brooke
being the best. The movie is troubled from the start because Chris O'Donnell is
hugely miscast and gives one of the worst performances to date.
Here is the stupid plot: Chris O'Donnell plays Jimmie Shelton a man who has
just broken up with his girlfriend, he meets Anne (Rene Zellwegar) they
instantly hit it off and are together for three years. Jimmie decides that he
wants to bring their relationship a little bit up. He really doesn't realize
that Anne thinks he wants to marry her (what he wants I never did catch). So he
proposes in a really bad way, and she shoots him down and is very mad. He of
course tries to apologize but nothing seems to help any. Then his grandfather
dies and he learns that he has left Jimmie 100 million dollars....as long as he
marries before the next day at 6:05 pm. Now Jimmie must find Anne and try to
marry her to get the money and because he loves her, or get married to someone
else to get the money itself, leading to an un-funny and predictable ending
that leaves a bad taste in our mouths.
Ok so maybe this could be one of the dumbest, cliched, silliest romantic comedy
to date that has no real big laughs. Even the supporting roles of Artie Lange,
Hal Holbrook and Ed Anser aren't even good. The plot was a good idea, but the
script would have to have been written in less than five minutes and by a five
year old. The choppy dialogue and bad directing don't help things any. Even
though Chris O'Donnell gave an OK performance in the two Batman movies, he does
not give even a remotely good or funny performance here and I wanted to boo and
throw my pop at the screen to get rid of him.
Rene Zelweggar is a different story and gave a charming, sweet and likable
performance (as usual) and really was the only thing that saved this confused
movie from being a total huge washout. Her sister played by Marley Shelton is
also good and the two have good chemistry onscreen. Brooke Shields showed up in
a funny little performance as a big-headed mogul who after a while became
routine and old. One really can't help but think that we have seen this stuff
before. It's not like this is an original idea and in the end, everyone knows
what is going to happen due do its cliches and typicalness.
'The Bachelor' works on no good levels and in fact doesn't work at all. Ed
Anser and Hal Holbrook were wasted in terrible roles and Mariah Carey can not
act to save her soul, and this could be the only film of her movie career
dispite her terrific music career. Chris O'Donnell is not as bad an actor as
Casper Van Dien but that is not saying a great deal. He seems held back and
really doesn't get into his character much and after even the first 30 minutes
gets annoying and old. Artie Lange just to me seems like he is trying to
another Chris Farley and was completely unfunny and un-nerving.
Why the filmmakers would want to waste such a cast in such a bad movie, with
such bad acting and dialogue is a question only they will know. Maybe they
thought it would become a hit or a critical success, and sometimes I don't
agree with other critics on movies, even from the trailers for this film they
made it look bad and showed all the mildly funny parts. Its based on the 1925
silent film 'Seven Chances' which I am sure is very better than this mess. Even
though some may think of this as a good date movie, most who see this will want
to pull out thier hair and scream for thier money back. 
Besides being a terrible movie, 'The Bachelor' is well a terrible movie. It has
nothing worth recommending therefore I really can't recommend this movie. I did
not have a good time and I laughed only three times. The running time of the
movie is 106 minutes which is wayyyy over time and needs to be shortened at
least thirty minutes. Parts of it seems to go on forever and parts of seem to
not last enough time. Being one of the worst movies of the year, we can be sure
that I hope they will not make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedies, and if
they do they I give up on filmmakers.

The previews for The Bachelor had me anticipating this romantic comedy. 
The problem is, it wasn't very funny.  Oh, it has some moments of romance,
but mostly the film is filled with a lot of screaming.    Marco, the best
friend to Jimmie Shannon (O'Donnell) is played by Artie Lange who is the
champion screamer in the film.  How Jimmie ever picked Marco as his best
friend is beyond me.
The movie is a remake of a Buster Keaton film from 1925 where Jimmie's
uncle dies and his will endows him with $100 million IF he is married
before his 30th birthday.   Of course, his birthday happens to be the next
day.  When he botches his proposal to the girl he loves, she leaves the
country, or so he thinks.  So, he goes on a mad chase to marry `someone'
before the deadline.  It kind of proves that he does love the money more
than he loves her, doesn't it?   Even with the money, I think that this
marriage is doomed to failure.
One of the most interesting bits is when Jimmie proposes to former
girlfriend, Buckley, a frenetic person who smokes constantly.  Her only
consideration for the marriage is the money. Her family has fallen on bad
times and with Jimmie's millions, she can redeem their status.  I kept
thinking how much the girl reminded me of Brooke Shields.  That's because
it IS Brooke Shields in one of her best acting jobs to date.  She really
got into the character.
Character actors Hal Holbrook and Ed Asner could have phoned in their
parts.  They obviously only did it for the money.like Buckley.
The only funny scenes are the ones from the preview, with the brides
chasing Jimmie through the streets of San Francisco where the producers
had advertised for extras who had their own wedding dresses.  Most of the
brides are nice normal girls in wedding dresses, but look in the crowd for
some very interesting ones.
If this movie shows up on late night, free TV, I'll probably watch those
final chase scenes to see what I may have missed.   But it can't have been
much.  I give it a C-.

  There have been a number wedding-theme'd comedies like
"Runaway Bride" and "The Best Man" but this is the weakest of the
group. Chris O'Donnell plays a billiards heir who realizes that it's
time to give up his beloved bachelor status and make a commitment to
the photographer, Renee Zellweger ("Jerry Maguire"), whom he's been
dating for three years. But when the moment to propose occurs,
O'Donnell lamely grins at her, offering an engagement ring, saying,
"You win." Offended by his ambivalence and obvious insincerity, she
leaves him flat. Shortly thereafter, he discovers he will lose his
grandfather's (Peter Ustinov) $100 million fortune if he's not married
by the age of 30 - which is less than 24 hours away. So, following the
advice of the family attorney (Ed Asner) and stock broker (Hal
Holbrook), he desperately arranges for a priest (James Cromwell) to
wait in the limousine, ready to perform a quickie ceremony, while he
rides around San Francisco looking for a bride. Mariah Carey, Brooke
Shields, and Jennifer Esposito pop up in cameos as his former
girlfriends.  His buddy (Artie Lange) spills the dilemma to the
newspaper which results in a climactic stampede of 1,000 wannabe
brides clad in white gowns. "It's like Larry King's living room!"
Lange quips. The screenplay by Steve Cohen was adapted from Buster
Keaton's "Second Chances" (1925) with a nod to "Brewster's Millions"
(1945) in which an ordinary guy had to spend $1 million in a month in
order to receive a major inheritance. And director Gary Sinyor ("Stiff
Upper Lips") must be an ardent fan of over-acting.  On the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The Bachelor" is a totally predictable,
pre-feminist 4 until, finally, the bland "hero" realizes the
non-materialistic merits of matrimony.

"My mustang days were about to become a distant memory," the soon
to-be-ex-bachelor Jimmie Shannon (Chris O'Donnell) laments.  "Goodbye
sweet grasses."  A bachelor suffering from mustang metaphor obsession,
Jimmie sees his life dating one girl after another as being like a wild
mustang who is free to sample all of the grasses on the open range.
In Gary Sinyor's THE BACHELOR, Jimmie reluctantly decides it's time to
leave "Bachelorsville" for the town of "Marriedsville," so he arranges,
along with dozens of other men in a similar situation, to pop the
question to his intended at one of the fanciest restaurants in town.
After rambling incoherently, Jimmie finishes his proposal of sorts with,
"The upshot is: You win!"  Not exactly overwhelmed, his disbelieving
girlfriend, Anne (Renée Zellweger), glares at him with an incredulous
look.  "That's it?" she asks.  "'You win!' is a proposal?"
The delightfully cute Zellweger represents everything that is right
about THE BACHELOR.  She acts adorable, and with her long, curly blonde
hair and rosy cheeks, she looks like the catch of the century.  The
filmmakers ask her to carry the entire burden of the romantic portion of
this romantic comedy, which is hard.  One person does not a romance
make.
In contrast, the incredibly bland O'Donnell shows what's wrong with the
movie.  Never credible as a romantic figure in the story, he is required
to setup the comedy parts.  "What you think?" one woman ridicules Jimmie
late in the picture.  "You think you some kind of comedian?"  And
therein lies the problem, he isn't.  The movie, which features too much
O'Donnell and not enough Zellweger, places its bet heavily on the
comedic side of the romantic comedy equation.  The result is a story
that definitely has its moments but overall just fizzles.
Most of the movie concerns Jimmie's frantic search for another bride.
Soon after he botches his proposal to Anne (he really sticks his foot in
his mouth in an unprintable line after the "you win" disaster), his
grandfather dies.  In his will he leaves $100,000,000 to Jimmie but only
under certain conditions -- the prime one being that he gets married the
next day.  In order to prove that it isn't just some sham marriage, he
must stay hitched for 10 years, never leave his wife for more than one
day a month and produce "genetically verifiable offspring" within 5
years.
Needless to say, Jimmie will mess up the proposals to his ex-girlfriends
almost as badly as he did with his one to Anne, whom he still loves.
Think you can guess the ending?
Steve Cohen's screenplay is based on Buster Keaton's silent classic
SEVEN CHANCES from 1925.  Besides a few quite humorous scenes, the
script for THE BACHELOR has one nice serious one.  James Cromwell, as a
grim reaper of a priest, who turns out to have a heart of gold, explains
to Jimmie his philosophy about marriage.  "It's a great thing when you
grow old to have someone look in your face and see what you think you
look like," the priest says in the movie's only truly insightful scene.
THE BACHELOR is hard to characterize.  If it's a comedy, then there just
aren't enough laughs.  If it's supposed to be a romance, then they
should have cast someone who could have created some genuine chemistry
with Zellweger.  A sporadically enjoyable movie, it leaves you wishing
Zellweger had been given a lot more screen time.  And that they had cast
a different male lead.
THE BACHELOR runs 1:40.  It is rated PG-13 for language and would be
fine for kids about 9 and up.
The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, November 5.
In the San Jose area it will be playing at the AMC and Century theaters.

Cranky CriticŽ movie reviews: The Bachelor
Rated  [PG-13], minutes
Starring Chris O'Donnell and Renee Zellweger;
Hal Holbrook, James Cromwell, Artie Lange, Ed Asner, Marley Shelton  and
Peter Ustinov
Screenplay by Steve Cohen
Based on Buster Keaton's silent film Seven Chances
Directed by Gary Sinyor
website: www.bachelormovie.com
IN SHORT: Sometimes hilarious, all in all a not-painful average
dateflick.
Cranky remembers thinking to himself, after viewing director Gary
Sinyor's last flick Stiff Upper Lips, `if you want to produce a farce,
you'd better go really, really big.' That's what we get in The Bachelor,
which is a fairly average popcorn slash dateflick, with occasional bits
of brilliance.
In a film which pushes metaphorical limits as it compares dating and
marriage to the behavior patterns of wild animals, Jimmy Shannon (Chris
O'Donnell) is a wild mustang doing his best to avoid the noose of
marriage that has broken all of his friends and co-workers at the family
owned billiard table manufacturing factory. Three years into an almost
perfect relationship -- she's not pushing for commitment -- with the
lovely, blonde Anne (Renee Zellweger) Jimmy's close enough to the noose
that he's carried an engagement ring in his pocket for over three weeks.
He's also wild enough to keep a box filled with pictures of all the
women he's dated hidden in the closet.
Jimmy makes a dinner reservation at the one place in San Francisco where
all the single men take their significant others to pop the question.
All the gents wait for their dates with the glum look of the condemned
waiting for the executioner -- brilliant moment number one. Moment
number two follows soon after as Jimmy so totally botches the proposal,
in words not fit for this page, that Anne never wants to see his face
again. Anne's got her sister Natalie (an incredibly babelicious Marley
Shelton) to console her, as she tries to figure out what went wrong.
Of course they're perfect for each other. What would otherwise be a
generic break up to make up story raises the stakes by a) making the
botched proposal the talk of the town (moment #3) and b) knocking off
Jimmy's grandfather (Peter Ustinov) whose will leaves the boy $100
million as long as he's married by his thirtieth birthday. Which gives
Jimmy 27 hours to find the one ex-girlfriend willing to marry for money
instead of love.
With best friend Marco (Artie Lang) driving a borrowed limo and a local
priest (James Cromwell) waiting in the back seat to perform the
ceremony, Jimmy works his way down the list. Way down the list. While
each rejection should get more and more outrageous, they don't. All of
'em, including the screen debut by singer Mariah Carey are amusing
enough but they don't build up to the big climax, a totally desperate
marriage ceremony to the ex from Hell, played by Brooke Shields. I won't
spill how that one comes apart save to say it sets up what you've seen
in the teevee commercials; what I label brilliant moments numbers 4 and
5. #4 is how hundreds of women show up at the last minute and #5 is how
they react when Jimmy realizes that he can't say `I do' to anyone but
his true soul mate, Anne.
Cranky said he wanted to see `big' in farces and The Bachelor saves, and
delivers same, for the end of the tale. When all is said and done, this
is a perfectly OK flick. Lots of good moments, including cool supporting
perfs by Ed Asner and Hal Holbrook just never manage to add up to one
great film.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to The Bachelor, he would have paid...
The Bachelor is an OK dateflick. It's probably a better rental if you're
already paired up.

With the 1999 movie year drawing to a close, you can
expect the studios to start releasing a spate of films
that will be vying for the Academy's attention.  It's
Oscar time, so expect films to be more innovative in
presentation and weightier in storytelling.  But if
you're not in search of an Oscar contender, and
instead would be content with a lightweight, romantic
comedy for a Saturday night, then I would like to
marginally recommend `The Bachelor,' a saccharine film
where the cutest of couples inevitably find their way
into each other's arms.
The couple in question is Jimmie (Chris O'Donnell) and
Anne (Renee Zellweger).  And according to Jimmie, guys
have a strange way of looking at relationships.  Men
are like wild mustangs running wild through the
plains.  They stop for the occasional patch of lush
grass, symbolic to how men date different women.  Once
the mustangs are done, they move on.  So, it's
puzzling to him that he's been going steady with Anne
for almost three years.  What scares him even more is
that all of his friends are also getting married.  He
is the only bachelor left among his circle of friends.
 He is the only wild mustang that still roams free. 
Now, it's just a matter of time.  Soon, he'll have to
pop the question.  However, it is clear that Jimmie
isn't ready for marriage.  His gives Anne the most
awkward and wretched proposal that anyone has ever
given.  Indeed, his words aren't a proposal but rather
a declaration of surrender.  This doesn't make Anne
very happy.  She declines, though Jimmie somehow feels
relieved.
Soon after, Jimmie learns that his persnickety uncle
(Peter Ustinov) has passed away and has bequeathed to
him a $100 million fortune.   The only catch is that
he must marry before he turns 30, which literally
gives him 24 hours to tie the knot.  His desire to wed
quickly does not stem from the lost inheritance;
rather, the provisions of the will would force him to
sell the family business and put hundreds of people
out of work.  With Anne out of the question, Jimmie
searches out his old girlfriends with the $100 million
proposal.  One of his odder second-tier choices was
the deranged-looking Buckley (played by Brooke
Shields).  As she grudgingly begins to take her vows,
she keeps repeating `100 million dollars' to herself
to convince herself to go forward.  But she becomes
more rattled when she soon discovers that she'll have
to stay wed for 10 long years and even more shaken
when she learns that she must give birth to one child.
 She quickly bolts and the search continues.  This
includes a front-page article in a newspaper, which
leads to a very funny but sweet finale.  Despite his
need to wed quickly, he still wishes that he could
marry Anne.  But until he can internalize commitment,
that will never happen.
I am marginally recommending this film for two
reasons.  I enjoyed the final 10 minutes of the film
when 1,000 hopeful brides (and a few drag queens)
chase Jimmie through the streets of San Francisco. 
But primarily, it was because I liked Jimmie and Anne.
 Renee Zellweger is adorable and her smile can
brighten the darkest day.  Chris O'Donnell is also
affable.   They both exude energy, and it is their
combined charm that allows this movie to stay afloat.
`The Bachelor' is somewhat engaging but never
disappointing.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Buster Keaton's 1925 film Seven Chances is given a lifeless update in
this vapid vehicle that is as grating as its two acting leads.  Here,
Chris O'Donnell stars as a young bachelor that is forced to quickly find
a bride in order to cash in on a huge inheritance.  It plays like a bad
series finale of a bad television sitcom, but unfortunately it is not.
A sitcom would at least have the good taste to limit itself to
twenty-five minutes.
O'Donnell (Cookie's Fortune) plays Jimmie Shannon, the
twenty-six-year-old owner of a billiard table manufacturer in San
Francisco.  Shannon narrates the beginning of the film, equating single
men with wild and untamed stallions that like a wide variety of grass
patches.  We watch as he dumps his current filly at lunch; while, in the
next booth, a curly-haired girl tells her sister that she has ended her
relationship, too.  The girl is a professional photographer named Ann
(Renée Zellweger, One True Thing), and she immediately hits it off with
Jimmie.
Their relationship progresses so easily that Jimmie and Ann even miss
their one-year anniversary.  That's just the kind of relationship it
is.  But Jimmie grows uneasy as he watches all of his single friends
succumb to marriage.  There's even a funny bit that intertwines clips of
nervous men during a wedding bouquet toss and footage of stallions being
lassoed.  Eventually, Ann is the only single girl left over the age of
twelve and catches a prophetic bouquet.
After three years of dating, Jimmie pops the question to Ann after a
romantic dinner at The Starlight Room, but awkwardly fumbles through the
proposal to his horrified girlfriend, who ditches him and runs home and
reveals to her sister/roommate, `All I wanted was for him to do it right
and he didn't, and that says everything.'  This one line represents
everything that is wrong with females today.  They wait their whole
lives for this moment, and if it doesn't go down like they've dreamed,
they turn into wicked, vindictive shrews.  Of course, Jimmie's
grass-eating-stallion analogy wasn't exactly classy, either.  How are we
supposed to feel anything for these characters?
Jimmie's failed proposal attempt becomes an instant urban legend and
results in the death of his grandfather, who we learn has amassed a $100
million fortune that will be left to Jimmie, but only if he meets the
following requirements:
1. He must marry by 6:05 PM on his 30th birthday
2. He must stay married for at least ten years
3. He must live under the same roof as his wife and spend no more than
one night per month apart
4. He must produce a child within five years
The catch is that he turns thirty the following day and, to make matters
worse, Ann takes off for a three-week assignment in Athens.  So Jimmie
desperately begins proposing to every girl he has ever dated, including
a cop, a student, a commodities trader and an opera singer (Mariah
Carey) to no avail.  And when his best friend Marco (Artie Lange, Mad
TV) places a personal ad in the newspaper for brides, things begin to
speed out of control.
Although the film opens promisingly with David Byrne covering Cole
Porter's `Don't Fence Me In,' The Bachelor quickly becomes tedious and
mundane.  James Cromwell is completely wasted as a priest that follows
Jimmie around waiting to perform the wedding ceremony.  Hal Holbrook
also has a role in the film and  get this  has a fifteen-year-old
daughter.  O'Donnell's character is so underdeveloped that we never
learn how he came into the family's billiard business.  We learn his dad
was crushed when a building collapsed on him, but where is his mom?
And how does Zellweger luck into these roles where studly men are forced
into professing their love for her?  I half-expected a `you complete me'
line to come flying out of O'Donnell's maw.  But I might believe it if
the girl slapped on some lipstick.  The only way I can justify this is
to believe that her characters are sexually deviant, but this is even a
stretch.  She looks like the type that complains when you're on her
hair.  I wanted to choke her repeatedly, but feared that could actually
make her voice even raspier if I failed to finish her off.  She made me
wish that The Bachelor was a silent film, like Seven Chances.
I've got a much better idea for a script.  Have Jimmie move in with
Marco, who would divorce his wife and let Jimmie marry her in exchange
for a chunk of the inheritance.  Jimmie could live in a spare bedroom or
the basement and impregnate Marco's gal via in-vitro fertilization,
while she still technically remains Marco's gal.  Then, after the baby
is born and the film ends, the film can spin-off into a television
sitcom where the three try to survive their cramped quarters and bitter
feelings until the inheritance check is delivered.
Although The Bachelor is rated PG-13, there is one moment where someone
shouts `scum-sucker,' but it was obviously dubbed over a dirtier kind of
`sucker.'  I think there were also a couple of `f-word' cover-ups.
Parents of lip-reading children  beware.  Actually, everyone should be
wary of this movie.

`The Bachelor' is one of the best terrible movies you will ever see.
Wading through this gooey, detestable sludge is quite the chore for even
a dedicated romantic. Those hoping to find some genuine charm and
feeling behind this Chris O'Donnell vehicle should wander elsewhere;
`The Bachelor' is a painfully clumsy mess strung together with a few
brief moments of surprising poignancy. Awaiting these moments by
enduring the rest of the film is certainly not worth your time or money.
Although he has not quite evolved out of the stereotypical pretty-boy
cocoon, Chris O'Donnell has an effortless charm as an actor. Most will
recognize him as the high-flying Robin from the two latest `Batman'
films, but other abilities are evident behind his boyish smile. Can
O'Donnell carry the weight of a film on his shoulders? Perhaps, if he
found the proper vehicle... but `The Bachelor' falls far short of the
requirements. The actor just can't register with such a pathetic
screenplay as the guiding light to success. A few instances of adorable
humor aside, it becomes apparent that no one could save the festering
mess that is `The Bachelor'.
O'Donnell plays Jimmie, a hopeless romantic in his late twenties who's
progressing in a serious relationship with Anne (Renee Zellweger).
Jimmie takes Anne out for dinner to the restaurant specifically used for
proposals, and attempts to ask for her hand in marriage. The problem is
that his proposal sucks. Big time. You can tell things aren't going
pleasantly, because Jimmie gets the infamous deer-in-the-headlights'
look when Anne questions his approach.
And then, the plot (along with the stupidity of the movie) thickens.
Jimmie's grandfather (Peter Ustinov) dies suddenly, leaving a video will
behind for his grandson (who also happens to be his only living
relative). Everybody is speechless when grandpa declares that he is
passing down an inheritance in the amount of 100 million dollars to
Jimmie. Of course, there's a catch: he must get married before his 30th
birthday, stay joined with his bride for an entire decade, and produce
healthy children within the first five years. The bad news is that
Jimmie's birthday is the following day. With Anne out of town, he must
find a willing bride to share his riches with... and within a very
limited time frame.
There are certainly a few worthwhile aspects of `The Bachelor'. For one,
the movie's approach is interesting and not dripping with cliché.
Another is the colorful cast. O'Donnell and Zellweger are cute together,
and the supporting cast tries relentlessly to rescue the film from
drowning in it's own mediocrity. Ustinov is enjoyable as the cranky
grandfather figure, and James Cromwell is sincere and effective as a
wise priest dragged through Jimmie's marital adventures. And now the
cons: the approach may be interesting, but in trying an old-fashioned
method, director Gary Sinyor gives the film a synthetic feel. The
characters are drawn with obvious, broad strokes, and the plot is bogged
down with everything humanly imaginable.
Yes, `The Bachelor' is far more frustrating than cute. The screenplay is
lamely written, and the subject matter poorly conceived. The
considerable charm of the two leads is thoughtlessly wasted, along with
whatever promise the film initially contained. Potential goes out the
window early to suit Sinyor's `colorful' approach, but not a minute of
this hapless drivel seems accustomed to the director's wishes. `The
Bachelor' becomes lost without a homing beacon to save it.
You've seen the TV spots, haven't you? O'Donnell is madly rushing down a
deserted street and the caption reads `What is this man running from?'
In actuality, he's fleeing from thousands of angry brides who want to
marry him and inherit his fortune (it's one of the few enjoyable
sequences in the film). After seeing the movie, I believe that the
approaching horde could be something else. O'Donnell could be running
from his angry fans, who have just endured `The Bachelor', and are
hunting him down for revenge.

   Can't you just see it now... a reprise of the old joke about
the Robert Redford appearance in "Indecent Proposal"?  As
the predominantly female audience stream out of a screening
of "The Bachelor," one sweet one thing turns to her friend
and wonders, "Would you marry Chris O'Donnell for one
hundred million dollars?"  "Sure," her friend replies quickly,
"But you'll have to give me a few weeks to raise the money."
   Obviously, as with "Indecent Proposal," the situation is
reversed.  The O'Donnell character must find a woman to
marry him in less than 24 hours.  Whoever accepts the
proposal and says "I do" within that time gets to share an
estate worth a hundred mil.  Would one of the handsomest
young men in Hollywood, attached to such a fortune as well,
have the slightest problem getting the job done?  You
wouldn't think so, and indeed, hundreds upon hundreds of
eligible females turn up within minutes of hearing of the offer,
competing vigorously for his hand in marriage.  Oddly
enough, though, the handful of people he could live with
reject both him and his lucrative offer.
    If you think this sounds like the basis for a rollicking
comedy, you'd be on the money.  In fact, the thought is
hardly original.  One guy had a ball with the theme in a movie
he directed and starred in about a man who must be married
by 7:00 the very evening if he is to inherit a fortune, but a
miscommunication with his girlfriend leads to his pursuit by
thousands of would-be brides.  If you remember seeing this
film when it first came out, well dearie, as the Ethel Merman
song goes, you're much older than I.  We're talking Buster
Keaton in "Seven Chances" (1925), which had a great role for
young Jean Arthur, the girl of his dreams who turns him
down.
   Now, however, in blazing color with a hefty budget of
perhaps a third of that whole estate, New Line Cinema has
come out with an old-fashioned comedy that shouldn't work
but does, thanks to adorable performances by Chris
O'Donnell as swinging bachelor Jimmie Shannon and Renee
Zellweger as his dreamgirl, Anne.  When Jimmie's eccentric
grandfather (Peter Ustinov) dies and leaves his entire estate
to Jimmie--provided that Jimmy marry no later than 6:05 p.m.
on his thirtieth birthday (which occurs in 24 hours)--you'd
think that the two lovebirds could quickly and happily tie the
knot.  But Jimmie, a freedom-loving guy in no hurry to be tied
down, had previously messed up.  When he had first
proposed to Anne, he made clear by his body language and
unromantic vernacular as well that he was not really ready for
the big step.  Since "The Bachelor" is a romantic comedy,
Anne turns him down, leaving Jimmie to spend the rest of the
story hoping to get together again--which is what people in
romantic comedies try to do.
   The plot is contrived as all get-out and the story is as old-
fashioned as anything that Capra has ever done, but if you
suspend disbelief--as all veteran moviegoers can do without
being asked--you're in for a fun time in San Francisco.  You'll
watch as Jimmie's best friend Marco (Artie Lange) plays
Cyrano, doing what he can to round up the right person for
Jimmie to marry.  Director Gary Sinyor, working with a lighter-
than-air script from Steve Cohen, makes clear to us that
Jimmie may be stubbornly independent but he's not selfish. 
If he does not get his hands on the dough, the plant he had
inherited would be sold out from under him leaving a couple
of hundred workers out of jobs, including Marco.
   Aside from the penultimate scene featuring a chase up and
down the San Francisco hills that resembles a rough July day
in Pamplona, the most fun comes from the proposals that
Jimmie makes to a few individuals he had dated in the past,
each wholly different in temperament from the others. 
Foremost of these is a bid for the hand of Buckley, played by
an unrecognizable Brooke Shields.  Buckley, as opportunistic
as they come, is a poised debutante perfectly willing to marry
in an instant--until she discovers that she will have to live
under the same roof as her husband for ten years and have
at least one kid with him.  A clever parody of radical feminism
issues from a skit with perpetual student Carolyn (Sarah
Silverman), who tosses out the usual cliches against
marriage (a property transfer from father to husband; roses
are a metaphoric sexual organ designed to seduce),
prompting the frustrated Jimmie to cry out "I'm not interested
in your vagina...I just want you to marry me!"
   Renee Zellweger plays the usual ditzy self that has been
her hallmark since her great success in "Jerry Maguire"
(though her best role was as a Hasidic woman in "A Price
Above Rubies") and Chris O'Donnell will draw in the women
for this delightful bit of fluff.  A visual metaphor that seems
heavy-handed but is at least original involves a frequent cut
to a racing band of wild stallions, representing the allegedly
joyous freedom of bachelorhood.

Running Time: 101 minutes 
One of the contributors to the destruction of the Batman film franchise
Chris O'Donnell stars in this remake of Buster Keaton's 1925 silent film
Seven Chances.  Now I've never seen Seven Chances, as I'm more of a
Chaplin fan than a Keaton fan, but I seriously doubt that the classic
version could be as insipid as this. 
O'Donnell plays Jimmie Shannon, the manager of a pool table
manufacturing company.  He also fears commitment, and despite dating
Anne (Renee Zellweger) for over three years, he's unwilling to marry
her.  His reasons?  Well he's a guy you see, and well, guys are like
stallions, and they apparently don't like to be roped or something (hey,
that's the movie's explanation... I'd marry Renee Zellweger in a
second). 
Eventually it comes time for Jimmie to propose, and when he does, it's
the most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man EVER.  He essentially
says to her, "You win" and hands her a ring.  The audience should now
hate this character.  I did. 
Then the meat of the plot presents itself.  Jimmie's grandfather (Peter
Ustinov, completely wasted) dies and leaves Jimmie his entire estate of
100 million dollars as well as ownership of the pool table business. 
However, in order to get the money and save the jobs of the factory
workers, Jimmie must be married before his next birthday (which is just
over 24 hours away).  Having blown his chances with Anne, Jimmie
proceeds to track down all his prior girlfriends and suggest a "business
proposition". 
The movie wasn't half bad by this time, surprisingly.  It wasn't boring
me, and even managed to read my thoughts at one point.  Ustinov's
character left a video will, and while he's reading the ridiculous
clause in it, I thought to myself "What is this, Brewster's Millions?". 
As soon as I thought it, Hal Holbrook's character actually says "What is
this, Brewster's Millions?"  It was quite surreal. 
Something happens though during the film's final act that caused me to
sharply drop the rating it was going to receive.  Up to that point, all
of Jimmie's prior girlfriends had turned down his "business proposition"
which I felt was good.  At least the film wasn't painting women to be
cold hearted gold diggers.  When Jimmie has no other options, his goofy
friend (played by Artie Lange, making a career out of playing the goofy
friend) places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes a front page
story.  At this point, 100,000 women don wedding gowns and head off to
persuade Jimmie to pick them to be his bride. 
These women arrive at Jimmie's location and IMMEDIATELY start bullying
him about what he's looking for in a woman.  When he's had enough of
their unjustified attacks, he tells the angry mob that there's been a
mistake and he won't be marrying any of them.  As a result, the women
proceed to chase him around the city, in hopes of catching him and
tearing his limbs off.  This goes on FOR THE REST OF THE FILM.  It's
just Chris O'Donnell running from 100,000 obnoxious, greedy, angry and
stupid women.  My groans of disgust could be heard for miles.  The film
finally ended (thankfully), but to this day I'm still groaning. 
The Bachelor is available on DVD from New Line Home Video.  It contains
the film in both full frame and in its original theatrical aspect ratio
of 1.85:1, cast and crew info, and special DVD-ROM features.  The
original theatrical trailer is also on the disc, which contains scenes
not in the film.  Apparently there was even more footage of the gang of
brides chasing O'Donnell around the city, and at one point O'Donnell is
leaping from the tops of buses.  So that was bad enough to be cut, but
the other 30 minutes of bride shenanigans was good?  Ugh.

In 1925, Buster Keaton directed and starred in the silent classic 
"Seven Chances," which was itself based on an eponymous play. It was, 
and still is, a riot.
"The Bachelor" is a remake-update of Keaton's comedy/farce. The 
director, is the Brit Gary Sinyor, whose feature debut was the 
amusing, Jewish-themed comedy "Leon the Pig Farmer" (1992), a work 
modestly distributed, hence seen in specialized venues such as 
festivals. Sinyor made two more films which, to my knowledge, have 
been seen by even smaller audiences. "The Bachelor," if there's any 
justice, ought to meet with the same non-reception. But one cannot 
count on that.
When I watched the film with a small audience, a viewer near me kept 
laughing aloud, and commenting. I was doubly irritated, by my 
fellow-viewer and by the film. Since I did not want my annoyance to 
influence my judgment, I moved discreetly to a quiet part of the 
theater. The move did not improve the movie.
"The Bachelor" opens with much footage of wild mustangs to hammer the 
point that this is just what bachelor men are. Ugh. Then, Jimmy (a 
pallid, personality-less O'Donnell) is singled out as another younger 
man playing the field. He is, however, lucky enough to enter into a 
three-year relationship with Anne (Zellweger), who is a perfect 
companion and (supposedly), is not pushing for marriage. However, for 
reasons unclear, Jimmy feels compelled to pop the question. He does 
this at a fancy restaurant where, apparently, fellow-bachelors 
traditionally take their girl-friends to offer them wedding bliss. 
(Are there such places?)
Jimmy ruins everything with his hesitations and bumbling, especially 
by telling Anne "You win" and explaining that the time had come for 
him "to s... or get off the pot."  Some courtship! Incensed, the 
girl walks out on him. His later efforts at making up for his idiocy 
are spurned.
Then grandpa (Ustinov), the very wealthy owner of a pool-table 
factory, dies, leaving a will on video. Jimmy will inherit one 
hundred million dollars if he marries on his 30th birthday --which 
just happens to be a bit over 24 hours away.  So Jimmy re-proposes to 
Anne, who says no. This sends him on a frantic searc for another 
instant bride. Riding a limousine with his best friend - the fat 
Marco- and a thin clergyman  (James Cromwell), he locates, meets and 
proposes to (all this with impossible speed) several of his ex 
girl-friends. They are all   shown as caricatures. They all refuse.
As a last resort, Marco places a big newspaper ad which results in an 
army of willing brides, all in wedding gowns, mobbing and besieging 
Jimmy.
You can see the happy ending coming ,from a thousand miles away. To 
wit,  Anne's change of heart at the last minute, and the twosome's 
beating of the clock at the last second.
"The Bachelor" is a one-and-a half joke flick,  dull, mechanically 
repetitious within its  agitated search and its regular cuts to Anne 
and her sister -- the latter used as the female equivalent of "the 
straight man" in vaudeville routines. Although peppered by a few good 
bits and  a nice soundtrack of mostly oldies, the film remains a 
loser throughout.
The time element is entirely incredible, far more so than "Around the 
World in Eighty Days." It is inconceivable that so much happens in so 
short a time. The characters are dull, except for Brooke Shields as a 
cold, calculating socialite and gold-digger. Edward Asner and Hal 
Holbrook are embarrassingly wasted. In his small part, the great, 
versatile Peter Ustinov is a bad imitation of an eccentric, 
authoritarian old geezer with a bad imitation of an American accent. 
James Cromwell, whose corrupt, sinister chief of police was so 
chill-making in "L.A. Confidential," is the clergyman,  He goes, 
unbelievably,  from a silent, dumb-looking character to a suddenly 
active one.
Worse than anything else is the "piece de resistance" : the anonymous 
throng of hundreds (thousands?) of eager brides-to-be, all of them 
grasping harridans, all wearing ugly wedding-dresses, all vulgar and 
repulsive. Buster Keaton knew something when he kept his camera 
mostly at a distance which did not personalize those women. And the 
fact that his film was silent is a blessing.
