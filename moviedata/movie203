The most common (and in many cases the only) complaint
against Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 masterpiece THE
GODFATHER is glamorising of Mafia, which is presented as an
institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like
honour, loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some
gentler, kinder ages. Martin Scorsese, another Italoamerican
moviemaker, confronted that perspective with his own, more
down-to-earth vision of Mafia in 1973 MEAN STREETS, movie
that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime.
Unfortunately for Scorsese, his film was unspectacular and
too artsy to compete with Coppola's influence on Mafia
portrayals in the movies. Seventeen years later Scorsese
returned to mean streets of New York with another film that
dealt with darker side of American organised crime. This
film was GOODFELLAS, epic black comedy which is today
considered as one of the best and most influential films of
1990s.
GOODFELLAS owes some of its initial success and popularity
to the fact that it was based on the true story, told in
best-seller book WISEGUY by Nicholas Pileggi (who would
co-write the screenplay for the film). The book, as well as
the film, chronicled thirty years in the life of Henry Hill
(played by Ray Liotta), Irish-Italian criminal from New
York. At the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal
organisation of Paulie Cicero (played by Paul Sorvino),
local mob boss, and gradually climbs up the ladder starting
with small errands. After couple of years, together with his
best childhood friend Tommy De Vito (played by Joe Pesci),
he joins the crew of expert thieves led by Jimmy Conway
(played by Robert de Niro). Three of them spend years as
best friends and associates, gathering enormous wealth from
their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of
the most spectacular robberies in American history. Wealth,
influence and privileges of men connected with Mafia are
enough for Henry Hill to seduce his future wife Karen
(played by Lorraine Bracco), who would afterwards remain
loyal to her husband despite infidelities, domestic abuse,
arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug
dealing business. But the perfect world of "wiseguys"
gradually begins to fall apart - Tommy's unpredictable
outbursts of homicidal violence, Jimmy's reluctance to share
his part of the loot with partners and, finally, Henry's own
drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question
his loyalty to the friends.
GOODFELLAS is an excellent example of a film that represents
work of a film genius in his full glory. Scorsese managed to
create a vision which is effective and complete despite
being full of contradictions that would ripped the film
apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker. World
depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating.
Scorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence,
hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime, yet it
manages to make it both seductive and funny. After being
exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades
of criminal history (based on some notorious real life
events), the audience understands why the characters chose
such dangerous life paths, trading the superficial and
short-lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the
dullness and poverty of honest citizens. Scorsese also
manages to break viewer's moralistic inhibitions by showing
truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal
tragedies, broken homes, human depravity, violence,
bloodshed and murder - in all their uncompromising reality,
but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the
audience. With the use of ironic soundtrack, manipulative
shots, character's dialogue or narrator's commentary,
GOODFELLAS represents the new standards of black humour that
would became very popular few years later during Tarantino
era.
Even if we don't pay attention to skills with which
potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and
entertaining, we should admit that Scorsese displays his
talents of truly original and creative filmmaker. First, we
might notice unusual structure of the plot - relatively
minor subplot is used as movie's ironic prologue. Then,
instead of single narrator, Scorsese switches to the second
character as narrator in the middle of the film only to
switch back to the original shortly afterwards. This
multiple points of views, both in terms of narration and
various subjective shots, only lengthens the ironic distance
towards characters and their situation. Same ironic distance
comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack.
Nostalgia for good old times is illustrated with
easy-listening 1950s pop songs, while depression, paranoia
and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock
songs of late 1960s and 1970s. But the soundtrack is most
effective when it is used as ironic comment - almost
pastoral, easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic
contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed. However,
thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos
shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and
interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people. Such
scenes, although they require very great skill and patience
during their shootings, became very popular among other
directors in 1990s. Fragmentary character of the screenplay,
which doesn't have straight plot and instead bases film on
series of loosely connected vignettes, gives another
interesting opportunity for Scorsese. He uses this structure
of film to experiment, and most successful of such
experiments is hilarious "A Day in Life" segment near the
end of the film.
Another essential element of GOODFELLAS is large but superb
collection of great acting talents. The most respectable
among them is Robert de Niro, but his character, who happen
to be most quiet and business-like member of criminal trio,
gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues. Joe
Pesci deserved his "Oscar" for supporting role of homicidal
psychopath Tommy, and his lines, including ad-libs, probably
represent the most memorable element of the film. Ray
Liotta, although equally talented, perhaps doesn't look as
the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film.
Liotta's Henry Hill looks somewhat too Hollywoodised and
glamorous among this bunch of low-level street thugs.
Liotta, on the other hand, improves general impression by
very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction.
Lorraine Bracco is, on the other hand, very effective and
believable as Karen Hill, wife who gradually descends into
same moral cesspool as her husband. Paul Sorvino is also
very effective as patriarch mafioso, and among the
supporting cast most memorable is Chuck Low as pestering
small-time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave.
As a combination of clever sociological study, black humour
and innovative filmmaking GOODFELLAS became something only
the truly great films could do - work of art and excellent
popular entertainment in the same time. Because of this
achievement, and also because of the great influence on
future filmmakers, this cinematic gem deserves its rightful
place among the best films of 1990s.

I have made a promise to myself not to review Martin Scorsese's "GoodFellas" for
one very good reason - it is the best film of the 1990's and I still stand by my
opinion. I have dedicated a webpage to Mr. Scorsese in the last couple of years
and have thoroughly and intensely studied many of his films. I still consider
"Taxi Driver" the most phenomenally great American film ever made, and I stand
by it. But back to "GoodFellas." How can a gruesomely violent, offputting
portrait of the American mob be far superior to respected films of the 90's like
"Schindler's List," "Dances With Wolves," "Unforgiven," "The Silence of the
Lambs," "American Beauty," and, well, what is the point of belaboring the
obvious? The film has its share of detractors as well as admirers, but in
retrospect, there is simply nothing as influential or as alive and kicking as
"GoodFellas." 
The story is well known. It is all told from the point-of-view of an Irish kid,
Henry Hill (the perfectly cast Ray Liotta) who joined the mob in his youth,
skipping school to work in their places of business. Henry became fascinated by
the way of life, not so much the violence and gangland hits that are often not
the subject of crime films. By the time he is 21, he is married to the feisty
Karen Hill (Lorraine Bracco), is able to waltz into the Copacabana club without
waiting in line, makes money in restaurant deals, steals money from airports,
trucks, etc. Henry is at one point told by his mother that he looks like a
gangster. He has the looks, the snazzy suits, the connections, the power and,
just as easily, the ability to abuse it and lose it all. Yes, as indicated by
the Tony Bennett song in the opening credits, it is a rags to riches story in
the most ironic sense of the word. Scorsese has called this tale (based on a
true crime book by the excellent writer/reporter Nicholas Pillegi "Wiseguy"), as
well 
as the subsequent "Casino," a story of the American Dream. Perhaps, but since
when is it a dream of any kid to become a gangster? "It was better than becoming
President of the United States," says Henry Hill during his narrative voice-over
which succumbs the entire film. Maybe but the razzle-dazzle lifestyle of money,
Cadillacs, drugs and scores of women also has its limits. In "Casino," there
were no limits to what powerful men could have and consume. In "GoodFellas,"
there are limits, mostly because we are dealing with lower-level gangsters, at
least a little higher on the scale than the ones in "Mean Streets." To
categorize in more facile terms, "Mean Streets" was about racketeering in the
streets, "GoodFellas" is about the abuse of having access to anything in the Mob
and finally, "Casino" is about how the Mob's involvement in casino operations
can become a sickness. 
In 2 hours and a half, Scorsese does an incredible job of detailing the inside
life of organized crime, how it works and operates, how they behave, and manages
to tell the story of one man whose desires outweigh his priorities and has to
contend with having a family and working 24 hours a day. We see what it is like
to be a gangster and how sudden bursts of violence can come out of nowhere and
be totally unprovoked. A classic example is Joe Pesci's famous speech as Tommy,
the itchy trigger-happy gangster, when he asks, "Do you think I am funny?" In
the tension-filled scene, Tommy asks Henry why he thinks he is funny. Henry
can't provide a straight answer, and Tommy's scary glare takes over. We are sure
violence is about to erupt and it is amazing how Scorsese makes the audience
nervous as well (the theatre I saw it in back in 1990 was filled with audience
members who were silent, unsure what was going to happen next). Scorsese plays
the audience like a piano, and the whole movie has that same tension running
 at its core. 
Part of the tightly controlled tension comes from the notion that gangsters only
care about money and if you screw with them, they can kill you. As written by
Scorsese and Pileggi, the film never moralizes - it simply observes and shows us
what these guys are made of. For the first time in cinema history, "GoodFellas"
asserts that gangsters are nothing but scum - they are rotten criminals with
little in the way of sympathy for anyone else except their boss. In this case,
the boss is Paul Cicero (Paul Sorvino), a man of some integrity who wishes to
get involved in any business except drugs - the reason is because drugs can make
rats out of gangsters and he certainly doesn't want to end up in prison for
being ratted out. But these men are generally not men of principle or morals -
they have codes of conduct and their own morals within their circle. They have
codes that must be heeded, namely "never rat on your friends and always keep
your mouth shut." Wise advice given to Henry Hill as a young kid by celebrate
d thief and killer James Conway (Robert De Niro), but will Henry keep his word
or will he violate the code?
"GoodFellas" segues from one sequence to another flawlessly and so seamlessly
that we feel we are watching life unfold before our very eyes. It helps that the
film is narrated by Henry Hill since he is knowledgable of the inner workings
and anthropology of the mob. At times, "GoodFellas" is like a remarkable fusion
of a documentary-like narrative mixed with the personal story of one man who
sought to make more money than God. But things start to tumble. James Conway
gets greedy when he initiates the famous Lufthansa heist. Tommy loses his cool
and kills anyone who gets his temper rising (he even kills a made-man, normally
an untouchable in the mob circuit). Henry becomes involved with drugs like
cocaine and gets addicted himself, not to mention his wife, Karen. Everything
falls apart and consequences begin to escalate. It is a world so dangerous and
yet so alluring that we can't help but feel botj sorry and angered by Henry's
own lust for the life.  
In terms of editing and sheer cinematographic skill and peerless performances,
"GoodFellas" is sheer perfection. Its influence is clearly felt in all of the
crime pictures of today, particularly Quentin Tarantino. It is a serious crime
picture with offputting, realistic violence, unadored by the irony that has
taken the edge off of crime pictures ever since "Pulp Fiction." In "GoodFellas,"
it is all about edge and a certain immorality in Henry Hill that becomes clearer
in subsequent viewings. Scorsese's direction and Thelma Schoonmaker's faultless
editing create a world so rich and explosive that it rivals any crime picture
before or after it. There are endless tracking shots, freeze frames, zooms, but
never anything to detract from the story Scorsese is telling - it all perfectly
coincides with each scene. Consider the 2 and a half minute unbroken take inside
the Copacabana. We see Henry and Karen on their first real date entering the
club from a back entrance and watch as they scour from one room to the ne
xt, through hallways and corridors and finally entering the kitchen before
getting to the restaurant where an extra table is brought just for them. It is
essential to see it as one long take because it is primal in showing the allure
and thrill of the life. 
I've seen "GoodFellas" again and again and marvel at that fantastic sequence
inside the Copacabana, the moment where Henry Hill feels he has gone too far but
can't seem to get enough when snorting coke, Karen's crying fit when she feels
her life is in danger, Henry beaten by his father with a belt, Jimmy Conway's
quiet, understated scene where it is implied that he wants Henry killed, the
situation with Henry's girl helper who has a thing for her hat, watching Henry
make pasta sauce while watching the helicopters that may be watching him, and I
could go on. It is as perfect as any movie I've seen, and it is clearly Scorsese
at the top of his game pulling one trick out of his hat after another. Sure, it
is tough to watch, could be considered morally repugnant, and some of it is not
meant for all tastes (like the grisly stabbing at the beginning of the picture).
But it is about mob life, how easily that life can be taken away in the blink of
an eye, and notably how alluring the life of a mobster can be. The al
lure is all that Henry Hill wanted, and it is a shame he did not see it any
other way.
