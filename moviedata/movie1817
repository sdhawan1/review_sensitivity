Leitch, Alexis Arquette, Louise Fletcher, Loretta Devine, Melvin Van
Peebles, Susan Ruttan, Lucy Liu 
Written and Directed by: Mario Van Peebles 
Running Time: 95 minutes 
A couple of criminals (Mario Van Peebles and Loretta Devine) move into a
rich family's house in hopes of conning them out of their jewels. 
However, someone else steals the jewels before they are able to get to
them.  Writer Mario Van Peebles delivers a clever script with several
unexpected plot twists, but director Mario Van Peebles undermines his
own high points with haphazard camera work, editing and pacing.  It felt
as though the film should have been wrapping up at the hour mark, but
alas there was still 35 more minutes to go.  Daniel Baldwin (I can't
believe I'm about to type this) gives the best performance in the film,
outshining the other talented members of the cast.  [R]
