When an earthquake opens up a fissure under Los Angeles and a volcano
erupts in the La Brea Tar Pits, red-hot strawberry jam oozes through the
streets of tinsel town creating havoc =97 and big bucks for the film
studio.
Tommy Lee Jones is Mike Roark, head of the Office Of Emergency
Management and is charged with fixing this inconvenience. It's an
emergency that he hasn't had to manage before, but he has help from a
seismologist Amy Barnes (Anne Heche). The two of them against furious
flaming nature forms the central story line in the latest disaster film
to level major US cities.
As much fun as it is to watch LA melt down, there's...
There's really no use in discussing the plot of this film. It's exactly
the same as every other disaster film of the last 20 years. An
overwhelming force destroys a bunch of stuff. Our hero and his new love
interest try to convince the officials that there is a greater danger
but they won't listen so the team goes off on their own. There are kids
and dogs in danger who are saved at the last minute. In this one,
there's even __two__ dogs.
Some of the effects are spectacular, especially the lava bombs, but
what's new? Every disaster film has wonderful visuals. There's such a
plot formula that the only enjoyment anyone can get from these movies
anymore is by watching while turning off your brain.
Jones and Heche are more than adequate in their roles, but, again, so
what? They and the millions of dollars that went into this virtual
re-make of dozens of movies could have been better utilized.
Although the burning and devastation are entertaining, this is one of
those movies where the story couldn't happen unless there are some
remarkably stupid characters and the laws of nature are ignored. Most of
the film is taken up by firemen spraying water on the
thousands-of-degrees lava. In the real world, this would be like
attacking a charging lion with a fly swatter.
Not a horrible film to waste an afternoon away with, but you're not
going to experience much new. If you do plan on seeing it, make sure you
do at a theater. On video, there will be nothing at all.

     You know, I used to think that firefighting, a former occupation of
mine, was the perfect job for a problem solver.  That was before meeting
Mike Roark, director of Los Angeles' Office of Emergency Management.  As
played by Tommy Lee Jones, this guy has one *heck* of a problem on the
city's hands:  orange stuff is spewing from the La Brea Tar Pits and
oozing it's way down Wilshire.  Palm trees are aflame, fire trucks are
melting, and these nasty little things called lava bombs (what, you
didn't see DANTE'S PEAK?) are ruining everybody else's day.  Oh, what to
do, what to do?
     Now, since Mr. R. is a Hollywood construct, he's also a single dad,
who's supposedly on vacation with his surly daughter, and both of whom
just happen to be riding by The Pits when they erupt.  (You can decide
if the story has more fuzzy logic or convenient coincidences.) His part-
ner in grime is a plucky geologist ("get me a scientist!" he hilariously
barks and is handed Anne Heche), who tried to warn him, yesterday, that
something in the rock might be ready to roll.  (Had he heeded her warn-
ing, we wouldn't have a movie.  Or, for that matter, the once-in-a-
lifetime chance to see Ms. Heche wearing a silver, heat-reflecting
suit.)
     In a perfect world of guy movies, VOLCANO would be all about how to
divert the lava, extinguish the fires, triage the casualties, and save
the city.  Director Mick Jackson (L.A. STORY), obviously bored by such
linear thinking, has more on his mind.  He's included a hokey moral
message (black and white is gray, when covered with ash), some classic
camp (how else to explain yet another dog barking at lava?), and plenty
of homage to the city that, admit it, you're happy to see burn.  (My
favorite bit:  a Metro employee reading a book on writing screenplays 
that sell.)  All of this-- in-jokes, action sequences, cornball drama, 
and spectacular special effects-- is compressed into an exhilaratingly
exhausting 105 minutes.  If you don't shut down from sensory overload,
you should be entertained.

There's a scene somewhere in this film where one of the characters reads 
the book "Screenwriting Made Easy."  This is funny the first time just 
'cause it is, but funnier as the film goes on since it's totally ironic 
since the screenwriters of this inane film probably read it, outlined it 
and then wrote this film.  It's like they took the sub-genre of the 
disaster pic, which can be fun and hokey at the same time, and then 
forgot one of the greatest parts of them: the stupid, eccentric 
characters.  Yes, "The Poseidon Adventure" is crap, but it's fun 'cause 
of all the stupid, eccentric characters.  And "Earthquake," MY GOD!  
"Earthquake" has got to be one of the worst movies of all time, but at 
least they had the joke of having Charlton Heston sleeping with 
Genevieve Bujold.
"Volcano" takes a semi-intriguing yet stupendously inane plot (a volcano 
NO ONE knew about suddenly errupts one fine morning and then erupts 
again later then stops...only it's in, dare I say it? L.A!!!) and then 
puts no stupid, stereotypical, eccentric characters in it.  They're just 
stupid.  And the actors are all good ones.  Tommy Lee Jones is great, an 
Oscar winner, and a member of the Men In Black (my vote for what should 
be the coolest movie of the summer).  Anne Heche is a good indy actress. 
 Don Cheadle STOLE the disappointing "Devil in a Blue Dress" from 
Denzel's feet.  And Gaby's one of the few good teenage actors.  But they 
get nothing to do but act dumb and scream at what's going on.  They do 
their best, God bless them, but they're all lost in the fake magma (only 
Don Cheadle gets an interesting part and he's the greatest part of the 
film).
There's no real suspense here 'cause you don't care about anyone.  I 
actually was rooting for Gaby's character to get killed so Tommy Lee 
Jones wouldn't have to keep saving her (he did it like thirty times!).  
And there are no interesting sites in L.A. that we see get destroyed.  
Part of the fun of disaster films is watching sites get toppled or 
destroyed or whatever.  In "Independence Day," the best part (other than 
Judd Hirsch) was watching the White House and Empire State Building get 
blown up by the aliens.  That was cool.  Watching really fake-looking 
magma plow down the street is not.
Okay, so the film's not devoid of merit.  As I already stated, Don 
Cheadle was great and the cast does their best.  And there's this really 
moronic scene which looks cool.  John Carrol Lynch (Norm from "Fargo") 
goes on a subway car to save people but the lava comes and surrounds it. 
 He has one guy who's wounded and COULD make it.  He could throw the guy 
and jump and still survive.  But NO!!!  He has to go and inanely jump 
and land right in the middle of the lava.  Here's the cool sight: he 
melts.  Here's the dumb part of it: he somehow manages to throw the man 
to safety as his legs are melting.  Cool sight.  No logic.  But cool 
sight.
The volcano erupts twice and for some reason, the film ends there.  They 
aren't worried about it eruting again, they just go home to their 
toppled homes.  But to tell the truth, I was glad they didn't go on.  I 
was hoping the film was over after the first eruption ended.  My god, it 
was actually painful to sit through this little 102 minute long film.  I 
haven't seen "Dante's Peak" but I've heard it's a masterpiece compared 
to this.
If you want to see a cool disaster flick that's inane but interesting, 
rent "The Towering Inferno" with Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, and the 
schweppervescent O.J. Simpson (he saves a cat).  If you want to waste 
your time watching a boring, stupid disaster flick (literally, it almost 
grossed half of its budget), see this.  But I warned you.

>From the opening moment, when the titles appear on the screen, the
eerie sounds of a building about to collapse, of columns and steel
supports beginning to crack, envelope the theater.  This sound special
effect sets the films tone and stays with us all through the film.
Good thing, too, because the story is the usual nothing as in almost
all films about disasters.
Los Angeles, with its wonderful weather and laid back life style, is
often the envy of the rest of the country.  Those who envy us and who
are turned on when they read of forest fires in our mountains, followed
by rain and floods, and who may get a vicarious thrill reading about
our latest earthquake, should delight in this new disaster Hollywood
has imagined, a volcano whose lava (as hot as 2000 degrees  Centigrade)
instantly melts even steel buildings that it envelops.  Welcome to
L.A.
Los Angeles has a world-famous site, located next to our County Museum
of Art. It is the La Brea Tar Pits.  (A misnomer, since ""brea" means
"tar." in Spanish.) At the tar pits, one can see a small lake (or large
pool) of oil and tar that still bubble to the surface.  Many
prehistoric parts of mastodons have been unearthed In the film this is
where the volcano erupts, sending hot lava geysers into the air, and
shooting "lava bombs" weighing as much as two tons into the air to
descend on a building or neighborhood instantly destroying it.
Los Angeles has an Emergency Dept headed by Mike Roark (Tommy Lee
Jones). When all hell breaks loose with the volcano threatening to
destroy much of Los Angeles, it is Mike's job to minimize the
destruction and to save as many lives as possible.  They could not
have picked a better person than Mike.  He is cool under stress,
knowledgeable, daring and dependable.  He is ably assisted in this
new unprecedented disaster which no one had anticipated by Lt. Ed Fox,
(Keith David), the Fire Chief.
Mike has a teenaged daughter, Kelly (Gaby Hoffmann) .  He also has
as a good friend and more, Dr. Amy Barnes (Anne Heche), a seismologist,
who also helps in planning what to do about the disaster.  Emmit Reese
(Don Cheadle) is Roark's assistant.who mans the control center while
Roark is out in the field battling the lava flow.  Some 50 local
media people play themselves.
The Special Effects are outstanding: the fires, the lava bombs, the
boiling lava flowing down the city streets.  The story (such as it is)
includes Roark's daughter, Kelly, being in a building that is about to
be blown up to block the path of the lava so that it will detour toward
the ocean.  Having seen enough movies to know that Kelly will escape
unharmed, I was nevertheless wishing she would hurry up and get out of
the building before it descended on her.
Happily, the film shows that when people are faced with something
horrendous, a common enemy, they bond together, forgetting nonsense
such as race, religion, and ethnicity.  This is brought out nicely
when a little boy has lost his mother. When asked to look at a crowd
and see if he can point her out, he says "I can't. Everyone looks
alike."  And indeed they do, tired, covered with soot and ash.
Disaster films seem to be the vogue at the moment.  As Screenwriter
Jerome D Armstrong tells it, ten, twenty years ago, disaster films
were about mechanical failures such as in The Poseidon Adventure, The
Towering Inferno, and Westworld. Here we are dealing with a natural
disaster for which we are unprepared and must learn to deal with it
quickly.
My personal problem was that I was sitting in a theater about 5 - 10
minutes from where the film's disasters were being portrayed and so I
could not get really caught up.  Out-of-Towners should not have that
same experience.  It will get their blood flowing.
Screenplay by Jerome Armstrong and Billy Ray from a story by Armstrong.

VOLCANO  1/4 *   Directed by Mick Jackson. Written by Jerome Armstrong
& Billy Ray, based on a story by Armstrong. Photography, Theo van de Sande.
Editing, MichaelTronick & Don Brochu.  Production design, Jackson Degovia.
Music,Alan Silvestri. Cast: Tommy Lee Jones (Mike Roark), Anne Heche (Dr.
Amy Barnes), Gaby Hoffman (Kelly Roark),Don Cheadle (Emmit Reese).  20th
Century Fox release. 120 min. PG-13.
"Sumer is icumen in, Lhude sing cucu" (Start of The Summer Canon, 13th
Century)
"Summer is early this year" (in movie critical parlance : "The awful
gadzillion dollars spectaculars of sound and fury signifying nothing are
already upon us")
"Cucu" : old spelling for "cuckoo," what "Volcano" drives some of us.
1. Los Angeles gets a new earthquake. No big deal as they say in the City
of Big Deals. Then comes a gas explosion that steams several workers to
death. Next, an underground volcano erupts, sending lava all over.
2. The epic duel starts between the  OEM  (Office of Emergency Management)
and ODTAA One Damn Thing After Another).
3. If you have seen more than 12 movies in your lifetime you know that OEM
will initially have some arguments with the LAPD, the LAFD, the LAWC (Water
Company), the LASP (Stubborn People) and the like. Just momentary frictions
however.
4. OEM's top banana Mike Roark looks just like Tommy Lee Jones except that
he doesn't even attempt more than two facial expressions. His heart is
clearly not in it.
5.Just before AHBL (All Hell Breaking Loose), newly divorced or separated
Mike was going on vacation. His young daughter Kelly had flown in the night
before. She is petulant and wants to have her nose pierced.
1. There are many, all heroic and cast with politically correct gender and
race in mind. Like a  sterling Oriental-American lady MD, married to a
Caucasian architect. Or like Mike's second in command, an African-American.
2. One of Mike's top people is a woman who knows all about complicated
equipment.
3. The second lead is Amy Barnes, Ph.D., new to Mike, young, nice looking,
a scientific whiz who know all there is to know and makes lightning fast
diagnoses and predictions. She is,of course, unattached.
1. It takes up 99.9 % of the movie as explosions explode and mega-tons of
burning lava creep all overground as well as in the Underground (British
for subway). Classy stuff.
2. Dad Mike rescues many people,makes split-second decisions, is all over
the place. You bet that he can walk and chew gum at the same time.
3. When Kelly, alone in a car, is supposed to look scared, I think I caught
her with a half-smile for one-fifth of a second. Or did I imagine this?
3a. Still, watch closely a video of some film where crowds are running from
danger (like terrorists at the Super Bowl in "Black Sunday").You'll see
that  a lot of the panicky extras are actually beaming or laughing.
4. Early on, when two female scientists imperil their lives, it is (you can
guess it if  you have seen more than 12 pictures in your lifetime) that the
non-doll will buy the farm.
5. The technical hows and whys of The Battle of Los Angeles will probably
escape you as the principals talk fast in terms that sound like a foreign
language. Take it on faith.
1. It is a given that  OEM and Co. will triumph. However, as the
lava-fighters whoop it up,  your watch tells you that there's much
movie-time left and that there's more trouble to come.
2. Kelly, with a second degree burn, is taken by the wonderful lady MD to
the now apocalyptic Cedars Sinai Hospital.
1. Original dialogue flows along with the lava.  The wonderful MD to the
teenager:" Kelly, I know you're scared. I'm scared too. But you've got to
help."
2. Original concept. At Cedars, Kelly minds a little boy who disappears. In
a nearby building about to be blown up she refuses to  stop searching for
the child: "You don't understand. He's my responsibility!" Kelly has
matured.
3.Dad saves Kelly and the little boy. As in all great movies, rescue does
not wait until the 11th hour, or even 11:59, but for 11:59 and 59 seconds.
Exhilarating..
4. Original finale. Dr.Amy Barnes happens to be around.Mike, Kelly and
blonde will bond.
1.When it's all over, how is it possible that only 100 people have died?
2. The disaster must have cut water and electricity, but L.A.is so great
that it still  has water for the hoses, current for the drills, images on
TV screens.
1. If a volcano obliterated ancient Pompeii because it (Pompeii) was so
sinful, why does the far guiltier Los Angeles survive?
2. A nice point (I mean this). At the end, when Kelly looks for the kid's
mom she asks the boy "What  does she look like?" The puzzled kid says "They
all look alike" as he points to the sooty rescuers who have not yet had a
chance to clean up with Lava Soap.
1. Had L.A. been destroyed, would we start getting better movies?

     This is the spring of two different volcano movies, DANTE'S PEAK
and VOLCANO and it surprising how differently the two films treat the
same sort of disaster.  DANTE'S PEAK was a dark and downbeat film
taking place in Mt. St. Helens territory and its disaster is filmed in
dark colors.  Its message is that volcanoes are immensely powerful
forces of nature and even with the help of technology about the best we
can hope for from a confrontation is to get away alive.  But they are
impressive.  VOLCANO is set in Los Angeles among famous landmarks.  It
tells us that with a bit of ingenuity and a little time any problems
including volcanoes can be solved.  Much of VOLCANO is tongue-in-cheek
with in-jokes about well- known Los Angeles personalities and digs at
the controversial Metro system.  In short VOLCANO is just one more
colorful action film.  It seem to have had little interest in seriously
exploring the possibility of a volcano in Los Angeles.  It does not
seem to have been based at all on any existing accounts of real
eruptions.
     For Mike Roark (played by Tommy Lee Jones), the director of the
Office of Emergency Management, the first day of the disaster starts
off badly... with an earthquake.  In spite of officially being on
vacation, he wants to jump immediately into action.  But his first
problem is that he has to find a sitter to manage his rambunctious
thirteen-year-old daughter Kelly (Gaby Hoffman).  When he gets to his
job, Mike's way of managing is to be in the field investigating while
his assistant (Don Cheadle) manages things in the office.  It is not
long before the earthquake problem gives way to a mystery of several
workers who were mysteriously burned in an underground tunnel by
something strange that left no sign of its presence.  Whatever it is
leaves scorching only on its victims, not on the walls of the tunnel.
It is time to call in spunky seismologist Dr. Amy Hoffmann (Anne Heche)
between them they discover that the real problem is volcanic flames
that creep up through the cracks in the floor of the tunnel, then sneak
away before they can be seen or leave a scorch-mark.  Amy discovers
this secret, but before she tell anyone the flames attack with a
genuine volcanic eruption geysering out of the La Brea Tar Pits.  This
micro-mini-eruption sends flaming rocks into the air which come down
like cannonballs for blocks around and ash starts falling like snow.
But then the real threat appears, streams of hot liquid lava come out
of the volcano.  They flood Wilshire Boulevard setting fires and
burning cars (but for some reason never exploding the gas tanks).  With
angry lava in the streets the question becomes, can it be stopped
before it reaches actual homes?  Also, can a coalition of Los Angeles
residents put aside their ethnic differences and work together to save
the city from the uncontrolled lava stream?
     Director Mike Jackson has done some intelligent films including
THREADS, THE RACE FOR THE DOUBLE HELIX, A VERY BRITISH COUP, L.A.
STORY, and INDICTMENT.  Each of those is a modest film that reaches for
the mind rather than getting a gut reaction.  Unfortunately, that was
not how he made VOLCANO.  This was a script that he should have turned
down from the start, but perhaps he wanted to see what he could do with
a bigger budget.  The story and screenplay are by first-timer Jerome
Armstrong, though Billy Ray shares the authorship of the script.  Tommy
Lee Jones is okay, but needs to get a little more variety into the
roles he plays.  He has one interesting character, but he has played
that character too often.  More interesting is the seismologist played
by Anne Heche.  She currently is also playing Johnny Depp's long-
suffering wife in DONNIE BRASCO.
     Armstrong throws frequent jokes into the script, though most of us
will have to have many of the jokes explained.  Apparently Dennis
Woodruff's car, seen prominently in a pool of lava, is a familiar Los
Angeles sight.  Also familiar is a billboard with a particular actress.
Just whether a certain restaurant chain we see multiple times is an
in-joke or a product placement, I am not sure.  There are some scenes
probably were not very well thought-out.  Mike seems to be abusing his
power asking for special attention from the fire department for his
daughter.  This probably did not sit well with the audience.  In one
scene Amy apparently measures a temperature of the ground and gets a
reading of 600 degrees just below her feet.  That would have burned
away her feet.  While the special effects are generally fairly good,
the digitized lava flows are not always convincing.  Neither are some
of the matte paintings.
     If you want to see an action adventure see VOLCANO, if you want to
have a feel for what it really would be like to be caught too close to
an erupting volcano, see DANTE'S PEAK.  VOLCANO rates a 0 on the -4 to
+4 scale.

 Even before the opening credits are done, we have seen ominous rumbling
underground and an earthquake that rocks Los Angeles.
 Plus, the film isn't very believable, as disaster films should be.
 Tommy Lee Jones stars as an ex-EMS who is called back into action (a la Sly
Stallon's character in Daylight [1996] ) when motlen rock starts pouring out of
the Lar Brea Tar Pits.
 Anne Heche is also on board as a scientist, and, lo, she is pretty darn
wonderful. And very believable.  So is Jones, who is always great.  He'd make
paint drying look exciting.
 It's too dramatic and nonstop.  Not that volcanoes aren't dramatic.  Volcano
just trys too hard to extend its action from one scene to the next.
 It is said Volcano cost a lot more than Dante's Peak, another volcano film
that came out about two months before.  Peak, which I thought was a thrilling,
intelligent, stunningly scary film, looks very realistic and was more apt in
the brains department.
 Volcano looks cheap and not very sure of itself.
 Enjoyable turf, it looks like a poor man's Irwin Allen.

20th Century Fox / 1:45 / 1997 / PG-13 (violence, language, disaster
intensity)
Cast: Tommy Lee Jones; Anne Heche; Don Cheadle; John Corbett; Keith
David; Gaby Hoffmann; Jacqui Kim; John Carroll Lynch
Director: Mick Jackson
Screenplay: Jerome Armstrong; Billy Ray
The official summer movie season has begun -- in April, no less -- with
the release of "Volcano," the first big-budget disaster movie since, oh,
February's "Dante's Peak" ... also a film where eruption plays a major
role. Because "Peak" explored very similar territory sooner (and
better), "Volcano," while somewhat good on its own terms, pretty much
falls into a slight category: Same taste, less filling.
The movie's premise has potential -- a vent in the earth's plates has
allowed magma to begin rising towards the crust, scenic Los Angeles to
be exact. Tommy Lee Jones plays Mike Roark, the head of an emergency
crew that's already on edge because of recent, intense quakes. It
certainly doesn't help matters that some strange activity in L.A.'s
underground has nuked a team of workers. We, of course, know why it's
hotter than hell down there.
Pretty seismologist Amy Barnes (Anne Heche) is called on by Roark to
help figure things out; she comments that a downtown spring has upped in
temperature, and it takes a geological event to make this happen. Before
too long, the implicit danger becomes blatantly obvious to the city, as
the La Brea Tap Pits spit out chunks of molten rock, setting fire to all
surroundings, and MacArthur Park begins, well, melting in the dark.
Roark's daughter (Gaby Hoffman) is badly burned in the mass confusion,
and sent to a local hospital with a dependable doctor (Jacqueline Kim)
who happens to be on the scene treating injured firemen. Roark and
Barnes meet up in all the ensuing commotion, and, with the help of
Roark's second-in-command (Don Cheadle) at the Emergency Management
command post, try to devise a plan to stop the stream of lava that's
flowing down Wilshire Boulevard.
The rest of the story clunks around as Los Angeles puts its diversity
aside and bands together to combat their natural enemy, and this is
where "Volcano" begins to fall apart. I really could have done without
the whole subplot which finds a white cop arresting a black citizen
because he's creating a nuisance in telling the police to help his
neighborhood out (references to Mark Fuhrman and the L.A. riots of a few
years back are used comedically here) -- it's extremely obvious that the
screenwriters are using mock racial tension solely for the purpose of a
ridiculous scene in which both men put their differences aside and work
together.
I think this is why I enjoyed "Dante's Peak" so much more. "Peak" knew
it was an E-ticket and provided adrenaline-pumping action scenes with
little plot or social relevance. Towards its end, "Volcano" tries to do
both -- explicitly so when a little boy, who's looking for his mother,
sees all of the ash-covered residents of Los Angeles and comments, "They
all look the same!" "Volcano" even features a dog leaping to safety,
which seems to be a staple for all recent disaster films.
Acting-wise, all is fine. Jones can play this kind of take-charge role
in his sleep, and he does it extremely well. Heche, a real find in
independent films, has likely found the part that will serve as her
breakthrough into the leading mainstream. And Cheadle, most recently
seen in "Rosewood," manages to steal most scenes he's in, even though
he's confined to a desk for the film's entire run.
Put all plotting flaws aside, though, and you have some great special
effects, and I suppose that this is the true reason to rush out and see
"Volcano;" after all, it wouldn't have been made without them, right?
(In one gruesome segment, a key character lands feet-first in lava and
slowly melts like the Wicked Witch of the West -- it looks so strange
and disturbing that I didn't know whether to laugh or be disgusted.) And
for the record, I'd rather watch lava turn the City of Angels into an
iferno than aliens blow up the White House any day.

It's not a 'volcano' as we know it. More the beginnings of one leaking
lava into L.A.
The movie jumps straight into lava erupting into the city. This is a big
mistake because it leaves no room for the rest of the movie to move to a
higher level of tension. What you see at the beginning is the same thing
you see at the end. Too much lava and burned bodies.
The human rescue scenes are also clumsily contrived. With the victims
positioning themselves near lava pools and collapsing buildings,
waiting, no asking for disaster to hit them. Then pathetically needing
to be rescued. The hero's daughter annoyed me the most as she just
stands and screams when she sees lava moving towards her. Disappointing,
when all the other little heroines of 1997 are kicking velociraptors and
helping to save ships.
There is nothing to rejoice about. The day may be saved, but the battle
has only just begun. A volcano has been woken, so pack your bags and
leave L.A.
Comment: A special effect junky's food fest, which is about the same
level as burning shoe soles - ouch!

     O, there's nothing like a natural disaster to bring people
together!  That's the poorly masked theme ("They all look the same!")
behind VOLCANO, the first really big disaster movie we've seen since,
gosh, mid-February.  It least this VOLCANO doesn't blow -- figuratively
speaking -- like DANTE'S PEAK did, and that's mainly because it's so
much more fun to watch Los Angeles be decimated by unceasing lava flow
instead of a puny Pacific Northwest village.  Co-stars Anne Heche and
Tommy Lee Jones prove more than able at evading not only the encroaching
magma, but also the horde of bad actors that follow them throughout the
movie.  And while the film is full of creeping cheese, complete with
death-defying leaps to safety, slow motion shots, and kitschy
one-liners, I shock myself even by saying that, for the most part, it
feels *real.*  They even thought to include Dennis Woodruff's infamous

**1/2 (out of 4  = OK)
1997, PG-13, 105 minutes [1 hour, 45 minutes]
[thriller]
starring: Tommy Lee Jones (Mike Roark), Anne Heche (Dr. Amy Barnes), Gaby
Hoffmann (Kelly Roark), Don Cheadle (Emmit Reese), written by Jerome
Armstrong, Billy Ray, produced by Andrew Davis, Neal H. Moritz, directed by
Mick Jackson.
As a critic, I must remain as unbiased as possible before viewing a film.
But I had mixed feelings going into "Volcano" because I knew what was going
to happen. However, as routine as the film can be, I found myself genuinely
interested throughout.
The film works in the spirit of all big budget Hollywood disaster movies:
something strange is going on... no one knows what exactly... a strong leader
calls in an expert... the expert realizes something terrible is about to
happen... no one believes the expert... disaster ensues. Plus there are many
other elements that are plugged in: canceled vacations, bratty daughters,
offices with lots of computers and video screens, subplots of petty fighting
and bigotry, and of course impressive special effects.
Tommy Lee Jones stars as Mike Roark, the director of L.A.'s Office of
Emergency Management. He's about to go on vacation when some men die from
some sort of geologically related accident, but there's something unusual
about it. He calls in Dr. Amy Barnes (Heche), an "expert" who tells him
what's going on isn't just typical earthquake stuff, but volcanic activity.
It only takes a few scenes for Barnes' theory to be proven true as we see
manhole covers fly into the air and fireballs engulf the sewer system and
subway tunnels... then the real action starts.
And so we get scenes of total devastation with explosion after explosion and
fire after fire while a river of lava slowly flows down Wilshire Boulevard,
consuming everything in its path. 
Films like this try to make themselves as plausible as possible by throwing
in scientific jargon that makes perfect sense to us, even though we're not
sure what it means. I found most of the rhetoric here to be easy to swallow,
but I couldn't help feeling it was a little too convincing.
There isn't really a story here, just many scenes of teams of emergency
workers, police, and firefighters doing all they can to stop the lava flow,
evacuate citizens, and help the injured. Some of the individual scenes are
visually impressive but quite cheesy, such as Jones and Heche dangling by a
thread over the lava, or a rescuer using all his will to save someone, but
not himself. There are also two stupid subplots involving racism and
snobbishness that could only happen in L.A.
The characters are a bit bland and recycled though. Jones' Roark is the same
character as Sam Gerard in "The Fugitive." Gaby Hoffmann is sweet at first as
Roark's daughter Kelly, but becomes quite annoying by the end (not that it's
entirely her fault). Heche and Cheadle are obviously going through the
motions, but at least they don't over act, especially considering the
situation.
I can't say much more about the film without nitpicking all its unrealistic
and unbelievable aspects or describing the plot in detail. But for all the
trite aspects and through all the cliches (don't think I didn't notice them),
I couldn't help but be interested in seeing what happens next. The special
effects did make the lava and the sense of disaster realistic, which I'm sure
added to my interest. 
"Volcano" certainly impressed me more than "Twister," which is strange
considering how both are such movie machines. It has a few good points and
makes for a fair amount of suspense, but the bad points are obvious and bring
the film down. The title alone is a misnomer, there's no towering volcano
here, just a little stump of one. Maybe it should have been called "The
Secret Of The Ooze" (oh wait, that's already taken).

After the pretty awful Dantes Peak, we get the second of 'unknown volcano
erupts in unaware city' disaster film. However, the place in question isn't
a small town, like in Dantes, but Los Angeles. Dosen't really matter
though. This film is just as awful as Dantes Peak (but is saved a bit by
Jones) 
The 'plot' is about odd things going on in L.A, some scientists trying to
tell people that there is something odd, everyone ignoring them, and then
big s*** happening. No, you haven't clicked on a review for Dantes Peak,
it's because both films are exactly the same Tragic. 
Jones gives a good performance in a character that is impossible to 'act'
It's the most flat, boring action hero ever. However, Jones is always to
ready to save a film, and here he does it quite well. But he can't quite
save it from the pits of rubbish. Like Willem Dafoe in Speed 2, he's the
best thing in the film, but he can't save it due to a poor script. Some of
the speacial effects are quite good, especially the final shots, but some
models are so horrendously fake I had no choice but to laugh manically.
Also, some of the things the characters say are unbeliviable. For example,
at the end of the film, a fireman asks a five year old boy where his mother
is. He lifts the boy onto his shoulder. The boy then looks at everyone
(whos faces are covered in ash) and utters (and I swear he says this) 'Look
at their faces. They all look the same.' The Coca-Cola very nearly shot out
my nose I was laughing so hard. 
  
This film is nonsense really. I suppose if you like these big budget
bonanza's, you'll probably like this. Maybe if it was raining, there was
nothing on TV, and all your friends were on holiday, and you had NOTHING TO
DO, you might want to see this, (after all, Tommy Lee Jones is in it) It's
better than Dante's Peak. But that's not much of an recommendation. 
Overall Rating=** out of ***** (Hollywood nonsense, saved by Jones.
Almost.)

I had been expecting more of this movie than the less than thrilling
TWISTER.  TWISTER was good but had no real plot and no one to simpithize
with.  But TWISTER had amazing effects and I was hoping so would VOLCANO
Volcano starts with Tommy Lee Jones at EMO.  He worrys about a small
earthquake enough to leave his daughter at home with a baby sitter.
There is one small quake then another quake.  Then a geologist points
out to Tommy that its takes a geologic event to heat millions of gallons
of water in 12 hours.  A few hours later large amount of ash start to
fall.  Then....it starts.  The volcanic eruption....
I liked this movie...but it was not as great as I hoped.  I was still
good none the less.  It had excellent special effects.  The best
view...the helecopters flying over the streets of volcanos. 
Also...there were interesting side stories that made the plot more
interesting.  So...It was good!!

     VOLCANO is one of those films (like last year's TWISTER and 
INDEPENDENCE DAY) for which it doesn't matter what I (or any other 
critic) have to say.  Disaster movie junkies will go to get their fix; 
those who can't tell the difference between THE TOWERING INFERNO and DIE 
HARD will stay away.  Still, the burning question is probably the most 
obvious one:  Which is better, VOLCANO or DANTE'S PEAK?  Issues of 
credibility aside (both movies stray deeply into the preposterous, the 
former more often than the latter), there's no question whatsoever that 
VOLCANO makes for the better night out.  In fact, this is one of the 
best pure disaster movies ever made (not that it has much competition).  
Congratulations to director Mick Jackson for a job well done.
     From the opening credits, when the camera takes us through a crack 
in the earth to uncover the raging torrent of molten rock below, there's 
a sense that VOLCANO might actually live up to its pre-release hype.  
Once the credits are finished, the film adheres to the rigid, 
uncompromising structure embraced by nearly all disaster movies.  The 
first few scenes introduce us to the major players.  Next comes the 
buildup to the eruption -- thirty minutes of taut, well-paced 
anticipation.  Then, exhibiting the flair and style of a master, Jackson 
uses tremendous visual effects, ear-popping digital sound, and a high-
energy tension to usher in the coup de grace. 
     Character development fits into the "obligatory" category, but 
that's a significant improvement over what TWISTER offered.  Here, we 
have Mike Roark (Tommy Lee Jones), the head of Los Angeles' Office of 
Emergency Management (OEM), who smells a disaster around every corner.  
When a mild earthquake (4.9 on the Richter Scale) shakes the city, he 
abandons a vacation with his thirteen-year old daughter (Gaby Hoffman) 
to come into work, uncertain how his second-in-command, Emmett Reese 
(Don Cheadle), will handle the situation on his own.  Soon, however, 
strange things start happening.  Several men working underground are 
scalded to death.  The water temperature of a lake goes up by six 
degrees in twelve hours.  And the La Brea tar pits begin to pop and 
bubble in earnest.  Concerned that some geological cataclysm may be 
approaching, Roark requests the help of an expert.  He gets Dr. Amy 
Barnes (Anne Heche), who believes that L.A. could be sitting atop a 
volcano that's about to become active.
     In real life, I don't know anyone who believes that the residents 
of Los Angeles have anything to fear from volcanoes, but this film makes 
it very easy to suspend that particular disbelief.  Not only is VOLCANO 
a hell of a ride, but the script has enough intelligence (relatively 
speaking, that is) that it's possible to become engrossed in the movie 
without constantly being jerked back to reality by stupid and obvious 
plot contrivances.  Oh, there are missteps, such as an ill-conceived 
subplot about racial strife between a black youth and a white cop, but 
VOLCANO surprisingly manages to avoid many of the most common disaster 
movie pitfalls (probably because it keeps the number of major characters 
to a minimum).
     Tommy Lee Jones' Roark is a wonderfully heroic figure -- a man of 
action who never has time to rest.  The fate of the city rests on his 
shoulders, and he knows it.  Jones' fierce, unflagging portrayal helps 
us accept Roark not only as the man to save L.A., but as a loving father 
who is more concerned about his daughter's safety than that of every 
other citizen.  Anne Heche (DONNIE BRASCO), a young actress who has 
experienced quite a bit of recent exposure, offers a spunky 
interpretation of her sidekick-turned-love interest role.  Don Cheadle 
(ROSEWOOD) is in top form -- most of the film's comic moments revolve 
around him.  The rest of the cast isn't nearly as impressive, but, since 
no one else has much screen time, any number of acting deficiencies can 
be forgiven.
     All that most people want from a disaster movie is a jolt of 
adrenaline and a chance to "ooh" and "ahh", and VOLCANO fills both 
cravings.  After all, there's a lot at stake -- this isn't some sleepy 
Northwestern town, it's the second most populous city in the United 
States (L.A. has suddenly become a favorite target of motion picture 
mayhem -- see INDEPENDENCE DAY, ESCAPE FROM L.A., and next year's 
GODZILLA for other examples).  The special effects are top-notch.  When 
a lava river starts flowing down Wilshire Boulevard, we believe that 
it's actually happening.
     Normally, I detest any voiceover narration, but VOLCANO manages to 
do something in that department to enhance the picture.  Many scenes 
feature broadcast commentary by television stations reporting on the 
crisis.  There's more than a hint of parody as correspondents react in 
horror to events around them while staying out of harm's way.  
Screenwriters Jerome Armstrong and Billy Ray should be commended for 
this aspect of their script -- it's right on target.
     VOLCANO has opened the "summer" movie season at an astoundingly 
early late-April date.  But there's no mistaking this as anything but a 
blockbuster trying to get a running jump on competition like THE FIFTH 
ELEMENT and THE LOST WORLD.  This isn't the kind of film where it's 
worth waiting for the video tape -- it's too big and brash, and demands 
the speakers and atmosphere of a state-of-the-art theater.  Like 
TWISTER, it pushes the cinematic experience closer to the level of an 
amusement park ride.  However, unlike TWISTER, VOLCANO doesn't demand a 
complete short-circuit of all mental functions.  Although you see this 
film for the spectacle, the other stuff (characters, plot, etc.) doesn't 
get in the way, and that's the formula for success in this genre.  
VOLCANO triumphs with a resounding bang.

Screenplay:  Jerome Armstrong and Billy Ray.

Director:  Mick Jackson.

Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.
     It's hard to believe it has been over two and a half months since the
last volcano movie hit North American screens; it seems like only, gosh,
seven or eight weeks.  20th Century Fox is banking on the fact that lava's
lovelier the second time around, rolling out VOLCANO as an April preview
to the summer movie season, but whether or not it works depends on what
you're looking for in your disaster movies.  DANTE'S PEAK was frequently
dumb and predictable, but it also delivered suspense down the stretch in
well-packaged bursts.  VOLCANO is less chained to convention, a bit more
clever, and boasts a more talented cast.  It is also more about spectacle
than suspense, a very impressive production which is easier to enjoy from
a detached distance than it is to get caught up in.
     Tommy Lee Jones stars as Mike Roark, a supervisor for Los Angeles'
Office of Emergency Management who is supposed to be on vacation with his
daughter Kelly (Gaby Hoffman).  That is before a moderate earthquake hits,
and before an incident involving the death of several utilities workers
suggests an unusual underground heat source.  Seismologist Dr. Amy Barnes
(Anne Heche) has a theory, but no one believes it -- that is, until the La
Brea Tar Pits turn into a fountain of magma spewing destruction all over
Wilshire Boulevard.  As the sea of lava begins its inexorable march, Roark
tries to figure out some way to stop it or re-direct its course.
Meanwhile, Dr. Barnes suggests that there may be another more powerful
eruption yet to come, and tries to figure out where and when it might hit.
     There are certain elements you have come to expect in a film of this
kind, and VOLCANO delivers all of them:  intransigent bureaucrats who end
up making a bad situation worse, a hero whose personal life is given equal
footing with large-scale destruction, pets which make improbable escapes.
Fortunately, the script by Jerome Armstrong and Billy Ray offers a few
variations on those themes along the way.  The intransigent bureaucrat,
instead of becoming the guy whose inevitable death is a cause for cheers,
gets a shot at redemption; those amazing animals are given a satirical
poke in a feel-good TV news piece about "the other victims."  The dialogue
sometimes does get stilted and heavy-handed, and a few of the sub-plots
-- including one involving a self-absorbed real estate developer (John
Corbett) -- are abandoned mid-stream without any fanfare.  Apparently
someone realized that a fast pace and minimal exposition make for a better
disaster.
     That doesn't prevent the writers from attempting some clumsy stabs at
social commentary, which are notable largely because they are among the
few attempts at making the film specific to L.A.  As dopey as the tag line
"The Coast is Toast" may be, it showed that the marketing people
understood one of the more appealing elements of VOLCANO's premise:
people want to get a perverse charge out of watching Tinseltown become
Tindertown.  VOLCANO could have used more of a sense of place, more
recognizable landmarks like the Angelyne billboard turned into briquets.
Sure, it's wonderful that racially-fragmented Los Angelenos become one big
ashen can't-we-all-just-get-along family when forced to work together for
the common weal, but be honest.  Wouldn't you rather see lava creeping up
on a trademark L.A. traffic jam or chasing an army of suddenly less mellow
in-line skaters through Santa Monica, instead of crawling like fluorescent
tapioca down Wilshire?
     Which is not to say that the fluorescent tapioca in question isn't
extremely impressive.  In fact, there are a lot of impressive visuals in
VOLCANO, including tactically launched lava bombs and a dizzying array of
explosions.  The pyrotechnicians earn every cent of their pay in VOLCANO,
but the imagery could have been accompanied by more tense set pieces.  One
superb sequence finds Jones and Heche dangling over lava from a fire truck
ladder, while a man lying on the ladder contends with a fire burning its
way up a hose.  However, that's one of the rare moments when anyone seems
to be in any genuine peril.  The lava gets rolling, it destroys a bunch of
buildings, folks try to figure out how to stop it, and then they try to
figure out _another_ way to stop it.  VOLCANO loses a lot of steam after
Mount Wilshire blows her top, but there's just enough magnificent magma to
carry it through until Randy Newman sings "I Love L.A." over the closing
credits.  I love L.A., too, though I might have preferred it even more
well-done.

Well, I'll admit when I first heard about this film (which was before 
Dante's Peak) I could just smell what 'Twister' had started. So now it 
seems that we're in a full fledged return to the '70's disaster film 
era. With 'Twister', 'Dante's Peak', 'Volcano' and soon 'Flood' and 
James Cameron's extremly expensive 'Titanic'
I'll say first off I enjoyed 'Volcano' much more than I did 'Dantes 
Peak'. Part of that is just being biased as I usually enjoy anything 
that Tommy Lee Jones appears in. 
I've been reading a lot about the movie being 'cheezy' or 'hokey' and 
really didn't see or think that once during the entire film. I get 
bored easily and this film didn't bore me for a minute. Another thing, 
and boy am I bitching today!, that bothers me is when critics and such 
go on about "Well thats not really possible." You know what? I 
couldn't give a bloody damn if it's possible or not, really I 
couldn't. It's a freaking movie and I don't WANT reality thrown in my 
face. I want to be able to see the impossible, the all might "WHAT IF" 
to many reviewers have seen one to many movies!
The special effects are the second star to this feature. They are so 
amazing that I found it hard sometimes to believe they were indeed FX 
and LA was was not burning to the ground. They did an incredible job 
and come Oscar time (if they remember) some notice better be thrown 
there way.

Anyone who stays informed with the world around us knows that the city of Los
Angeles is capable of anything.  Fires, floods, earthquakes, mud slides, two
O.J. trials, incompetent D.A. officials and the list goes on and on and on.
One thing you wouldn't expect to find on that list is an active volcano
forming under the city's main core and that's exactly what happens in this
thrilling and strangely plausible film featuring a cast starring the movie's
special effects largely put together by visual effects supervisor Mat Beck
who has worked most impressively on television's 'The X-Files' and has a
bigger budget this time around to work with.
As for the human cast, Tommy Lee Jones stars as the head of the O.E.M.
(Office of Emergency Management) in L.A. and he is joined in the volcanic
discovery by a geologist (Anne Heche) and together they try and figure out a
way to minimize the human casualties and maximize the flow of deadly volcanic
lava away from the masses.  
Comparisons to 'Dante's Peak' from earlier in 1997 are inevitable but what
makes 'Volcano so much better is the sensation of finding this fury of nature
in a place where it's possible but unlikely.  Los Angeles is portrayed with
all its stereotypical trappings and they mix in an interesting way with the
disaster at hand.  
Another plus for this quality piece of filmmaking is the editing by Michael
Tronick and Don Brochu.  Under the specifications of director Mick Jackson,
they have constructed a movie with a lightning quick pace and you will be
hard pressed to look at your watch even once during the film.  The movie
takes an in-depth look at the beginnings of volcanic activity as we see many
hints of one developing and even many details of one in action courtesy of
the screen writing by Jerome Armstrong and Billy Ray based on Jerome
Armstrong's story.  
The acting in 'Volcano' is almost non-effective but that's perfect for a
disaster film and the only film in that genre I've ever seen with a cast of
well developed characters was 'The Poseidon Adventure' (1972) in which we
cared about the people involved and got a look at their lives in a memorable
fashion.  'Volcano' is an early contender for the Oscar for Best Visual
Effects and even though it's early in the year I predict this one will rank
as one of the year's best action/adventure films.

     Hollywood's paucity of ideas has given way to a surfeit of twins.
This is the year of two movies for every concept.  Steve Profantaine's
story is being duplicated with PREFONTAINE and PRE.  There are two
comedies about tenth high school reunions, GROSSE POINTE BLANK and ROMY
AND MICHELE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION.  And in the blockbuster category, we
have two disaster movies about volcanoes.  One which played close, but
not close enough, to parody was called DANTE'S PEAK.  The other is the
serious, special effects extravaganza known as VOLCANO.  It is also the
only one of the two volcano movies with decent acting.  Be warned,
however, the year is early so Hollywood could well turn any or all of
these twins into triplets.  But let's hope not.
     VOLCANO is not about some known volcano in a remote forest.  Oh
no, this volcano is an unknown one under one of the largest cities in
the world -- Los Angeles.  The film has easily the best tag line this
year: "The Coast is Toast."  Only the film industry would equate the
destruction of tinseltown as the elimination of the entire West Coast.
     Before getting into the heart of the review, let me comment first
on the real star -- the spectacular special effects.  The river of lava
has a realism and a power that needs to be seen to be appreciated.
Particularly well done are the "lava bombs" that shoot straight up like
a Roman candle and then plunge back down to the earth to destroy a
building or a fire truck in a noisy explosion.  More interesting,
however, is the way in which the movie hints at the volcano's force
through steam that blows off the manhole covers.
     The story has two acts.  The first leads up to the discovery of
the exact nature of the disaster under their feet.  The film is both
involving and intriguing during this whole exploration phase.
     Then the script by Jerome Armstrong and Billy Ray makes the
classic horror movie mistake, rushing the monster, a. k. a. the lava,
onto the screen too quickly because they lack confidence in their
ability to hold the audience's attention with mere suspense.  Lots of
action and big explosions -- now, that will make the audience feel they
got their seven bucks worth and make them tell their friends to see
that awesome movie.  This second act, which takes more than three
quarters of the film, outwears its welcome.  Periodically fun, but too
often tedious.
     Tommy Lee Jones (THE FUGITIVE) gives a good, albeit far from his
best, performance as Mike Roark, the head of LA's Office of Emergency
Management.  Better is Anne Heche (DONNIE BRASCO) as scientist Dr. Amy
Barnes, who becomes his sidekick.  She supplies the scientific insight
to what may be happening, and together they devise various schemes to
kill the monster, oops, I mean lava.  The plausible chemistry between
them never becomes overblown, and the usual big fight between the leads
never occurs.
     The second problem with the script concerns the small human
melodramas.  Whereas the overall logic of the picture is presented
plausibly enough for a movie, the unbelievable heroics of the minor
actors begin to take a toll on your brain.  Several people agree to
certain death only to be a hero.  Would you stay with someone in an
exploding building just because they were trapped?  Would you jump into
a river of lava carrying a dying man instead of jumping safely across
by yourself?  The dramatics include those of the mandatory child
endangerment scene and the one of the dog about to perish.
     Even though director Mick Jackson cannot save the sagging script,
the actors and the special effects keep your attention.
     Other than the leads, we have Don Cheadle, who was excellent in
ROSEWOOD, playing Mike's second-in-command Emmitt Reese.  He manages to
take the film's mundane dialog and breath life into it.  His character
becomes at once both funny and strong.  The script could have paced the
long second act better by feeding him some decent humorous fare.
     Jacqui Kim (DISCLOSURE) takes the poorly written role of the noble
Dr. Jaye Calder and transform it into a mildly interesting character.
Gaby Hoffmann (EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU) plays Mike's scared but
ultimately brave daughter.
     VOLCANO, despite its faults, does entertain a crowd.  Memorable?
Hardly, but the main actors are worth seeing, and that first act has so
much promise it almost makes you want to forgive them for blowing the
second.
     VOLCANO runs 1:45.  It is rated PG-13 for the intensity of the
disaster and the associated injuries.  Depending on how well your child
can handle disaster movies, the film could be seen by kids as young as
8, but it would be too much for our 8-year-old.  The trailers for it
scared him badly so we certainly would not take him.  I recommend the
film for its entertainment value and give it ** 1/2.  If you can only
see one volcano movie this year, then this is the one to see.
Opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's.

Tommy Lee Jones may have noted on his script: VOLCANO - The Paycheck.
While he performs admirably, this is a paint-by-numbers thriller
conceived by innumerates. The volcano starts as lava incursions into the
sewer system, with a talent for entirely withdrawing below after it
strikes. Easy for Bruce the Shark, but a neat trick for molten rock. A
scientist appears so that she go unheeded; in this case, its Ellen's
recently-outted friend, Ann Heche. Self-appointed gay-spotters will have
no trouble seeing her true nature, but the more balanced among us will
see a fair portrayal of a concerned human, with no time to get near
anybody's bed. Actually, Tommy, as the head of disaster control does
believe her, but he can't get any municipal services to heed his pleas.
This sort of drama was explored fully in Quincy, years ago.
So..when the caldera does poke its head up at the La Brea Tar Pits,
it politely sends its lava down Wilshire Blvd. They overturn one bus ON
Wilshire to steer the flow, but I never saw what kept the lava from
hanging a left at any intersection. You no doubt saw the trailer, where
they build a barricade to stop the flow, but where does all the
still-coming lava go to? To harden the lava at the end, fire trucks and
helicopters pour all their water on the leading edge. A totally
preposterous sight - dozens of helicopters flying twenty feet apart -
all dropping water from tanks installed with one hour's notice.
It get stupider. Now the volcano conveniently issues just one more
tendril of lava - thru the subway system. With 30-min notice, engineers
blow up a long, fifty-foot deep channel at the end of the subway, and
divert the flow to this trench by demolishing a new, unopened, $100
million-plus building. This building was shown in the opening scenes,
presented as ominously as those red-uniformed young security officers
beaming down to the planet with Kirk. Well, this sends the remaining
lava into the rain channels, toward the sea. It's Miller time. This
volcano just can't take a punch.
There are a couple incredibly amateurish "Can't we all get along?"
scenes. The lava stream was always linear, and nobody near the lava
seemed to feel the infrared heat that would have overwhelmed them before
the lava got to them. Also one-dimensional were the standard set of
imperiled youngsters, pets that always survive, and noble rescuers. One
stupid example of this involves one of those hard-headed municipal
bosses; this one has to atone for not shutting down the subway. He goes
back in the subway train to rescue the driver, but when he returns to
the back of the train, the lava has creeped several feet beyong the
train. He jumps INTO the lava, tossing the driver (who may already be
finished) clear of the lava. Personally, knowing we both couldn't make
it, I woulda chucked the now-doomed driver into the lava, and leaped
over it, using him as a steppingstone. Call me harsh for this clearer
thinking, but don't say I'm harsh on this film.
P.S. If you never think about anything, or question anything, You'll

Volcano (1997) *** out of ***** - Cast: Tommy Lee Jones, Anne Heche, Don
Cheadle, Gaby Hoffmann, David Keith. Written by Jerome Armstrong and Billy
Ray. Directed by: Mick Jackson. Running Time: 105 minutes.
When I reviewed "Dante's Peak", I made the comment that "Volcano" would
easily be the best of this year's two volcano flicks. The problem with
"Dante's Peak" is that it basically boiled down to this:
 Volcano Expert: "See that huge volcano looming behind your town? Well, It's
 going to erupt. I should know, I'm an expert."
 Townsfolk: "Expert-schmexpert. We don't buy it and we ain't leaving."
 Townsfolk: "Aaaaaaaaaah! The volcano's erupting! He was right! We're idiots!
 Ow, I'm on fire!"
While in "Volcano", just the premise alone is more intelligent than anything
in "Dante's Peak". An earthquake in Los Angeles causes a volcano to form
from the La Brae Tar Pits, which sends ash, fireballs, and rivers of lava
out to threaten the fine citizens of L.A. And anything about the destruction
of Los Angeles is okay in my book.
Tommy Lee Jones stars as Mike Roark, the chief of operations at Los Angeles'
Office of Emergency Management (OEM). While investigating some minor
earthquake activity, he becomes suspicious of some strange happenings in the
tunnels beneath the city. Seems as though intense heat has killed some
workers there.
Enter geologist Amy Barnes (Heche), a pretty blonde whom you know is going
to end up with Tommy Lee Jones in the end. She warns of the possibilites of
volcanic activity beneath the city caused by the friction of the earth's
plates. People hearing this, as in "Dante's Peak" dismiss it, but unlike
"Dante's Peak", the film wastes no time in proving her right. Soon the city
is in flames and a river of lava is flowing down Wilshire Blvd.
Now, I fully admit that "Volcano" is pure fluff, and cliches are thrown into
our faces every few seconds. For example, you've got the racist cop who puts
aside his feelings to help the same people he has contempt for. You've got
the "dog in peril" scene. Countless people have the line "Get out of here!
Save yourself!" And there's plenty of scenes where the characters get to run
in slow motion, racing to save a person in danger. Even at the end of the
film, a black police officer (Keith) holds a small boy and asks if he can
see his mother. Since everyone is covered in gray volcanic ash, the boy
innocently relpies "Everyone looks the same." Awww....
Despite it's ridiculousness though, I cannot deny that "Volcano" is
entertaining. The initial eruption scene especially. And while I do admit
that just about everything is a cliche, what else can you really do? I mean,
sure a river of lava threatening the very hospital where all the injured are
staying is a cliche, but what else are you going to do? If this were
actually to happen and you were fighting to save the hospital, who you hold
back because what's happening is a cliche? In the days after, would you
criticize the volcano for behaving in a cliched manner? That's how you make
the story compelling enough for us, the audience, to care about the people
trying to prevent the disaster. If the river of lava was flowing towards
gangland or a prison, would we care? Nope. Go lava!
Tommy Lee Jones adds class to the film, even though his character is just a
slight variation of his character from "The Fugitive". The surprise of the
film is the special effects, which to me were entirely convincing, and
surprisingly were more believable than anything any of the characters said
or did.
I found it pretty funny that after the lava has finally been diverted, that
an ironic act of nature occurs as heavy rain starts to fall. "Mother Nature,
could you help us out with some rain to stop the lava?" "No, but I'll make
it rain as soon as you're successful, which will wash all that gray ash off
you so your races will be clear again and so you can return to raping,
mugging, and murdering one another in your homes, streets, and freeways."
And even though, in the end, the threat of an active volcano is just another
in a long list of potential disasters threatening the people in California,
I guarantee you that NO ONE would get the message and move away!
When "Volcano" was all over, I was amazed that the whole movie went by and
no one thought to use Randy Newman's "I Love L.A." as a joke, however an
obvious and pathetic one. But then the end credits rolled... [PG-13]

Why do disaster movies come in pairs?  Youâd think one
volcano movie or one asteroid movie per summer would be
enough.  (Maybe even that would be one too many.)
But Iâm not going to gripe about how many small budget gems
could be made for the price of this dinosaur.  Itâs a big, dumb,
fun movie.  It almost made me want to go out and rent its
sibling, âDanteâs Peak.â?  Well, almost.
Like the packaging promises, the coast is indeed toast as a
volcano erupts in the middle of Los Angeles, threatening to
destroy the city everyone loves to hate.  Tommy Lee Jones, as
the intrepid head of the Office of Emergency Management,
saves everyoneâs bacon practically single-handedly.  The
movie is filled with the usual stock characters: venal city
officials who ignore the threat till too late, pushy reporters, the
pretty scientist, and the faint of heart who discover their inner
hero.  Thereâs even a cute pooch, rescued at the last moment,
guaranteed to bring a lump to your throat ... if youâre especially
susceptible to that kind of schmaltz.
Tommy Lee Jones is at his craggy-faced best in this movie, as
he deadpans though tons of silly dialogue.  The writers have
envisioned the head of OEM as a godlike being, and Tommy
Lee spends most of the movie in the streets yelling at cops,
firemen, and hospital administrators, telling them what to do. 
He pulls it off, too, which is kind of surprising given the way
heâs dressed.  Heâs wearing a short sleeve dress shirt and a
baseball cap, a wardrobe combo that usually shouts out âpencil
pusher,â? ânerd,â? maybe even âretard,â? but hardly
âaction-adventure hero.â?  Anne Heche overcomes a bad haircut
to play the role of the pretty geologist.  Sheâs the brains of the
operation, although given the competition she faces here, that
may be faint praise.  She does a creditable job of playing
small-but-plucky, and thereâs even a feminist subtext as
Tommy Leeâs character tries to keep her from taking on jobs
that are âtoo dangerous for a woman.â?
Thereâs a strenuously earnest racial-harmony subtext too, this
in the wake of the LA riots, with a bullet-headed white cop and
a burly black guy whose mutual hatred collapses in the face of
shared danger.  It all ends with the innocence of babes as a
small child babbles âeveryone looks the same!â?  Black and
white, everyoneâs covered with volcanic ash, you see.  Problem
is, everyoneâs the same depressing shade of gray.  The credits
roll to tune of Randy Newmanâs highly ironic âI Love LA.â?
