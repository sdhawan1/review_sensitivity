_Soldier_ is hands down one of the worst movies a person could
ever have to sit through that doesn't have Jean Claude Van Damme in it. I
could liken it to the sci-fi cheese that was the Hollywood
product-of-choice back in the early 80s, but that would be too much of a
compliment. If there is a movie theater in hell, this film is playing
there 24 hours a day.
The story, such that there is, revolves around Todd (Kurt Russell), an
automaton of a man who has been raised from birth to be a merciless
soldier in a not-too-distant ultra-conservative future (is there any other
kind?) After years of desensitization at a military academy full of other
boys just like him, Todd becomes a ground fighter in a series of wars all
over the galaxy. Who the enemies in these wars are is never revealed, but
the few glimpses of Todd in battle show that it doesn't matter, because
innocent hostages are wiped out as indifferently as the bad guys.
After ten minutes of this nihilistic trash -- yes folks, there's more --
we see Todd as a buff, scarred adult, now so accustomed to the carnage
that no confrontation at all causes him to break a sweat.  There's a new
wrinkle, though. Todd and his brethren are declared obsolete, and a new
batch of soldiers takes their place.  After losing a sanctioned battle
with _Dragon_'s Jason Scott Lee, the seemingly dead Todd is dumped by a
flying ice-cube tray (well, that's what is looked like) on a remote
garbage planet. 
If you predict that Todd meets a bunch of outcast settlers on this planet,
and that they band together to fight a bunch of bad guys coming to destroy
them, you're way ahead of the game. The renegade society on this trash
heap is so clich you half-expect Tina Turner and Master Blaster to come
strolling into frame any minute. 
It's surprising that _Soldier_ is the brain-child of _Blade Runner_
co-writer
David Webb Peoples. Unlike that mind-twisting classic, this film contains
just barely enough dialogue to fill about three double-spaced pages. Add
into the mix the _Mortal Kombat_'s Paul Anderson inept direction, and it's
easy to see how _Soldier_ turned out so bad. And the special effects! 
Remember the flying steam irons in Hardware Wars?
Gary Busey is in this movie. 'Nuff said. 
_Soldier_ is proof that Hollywood still has plenty of bad ideas sitting in
its script vaults. That this sad film made it to the silver screen should
encourage plenty of aspiring screenwriters out there that there is hope
after all. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go weep for the future.

Literally blink, and you'll miss _Soldier_'s lone flash of wit: a fleeting
glimpse of a computer screen listing futuristic supersoldier Todd's (Kurt
Russell) numerous war commendations, among them the "Plissken
Patch"--referring, of course, to Russell's character in John Carpenter's
_Escape_from..._ movies.  The rest of this sci-fi actioner is brainless
junk though writer David Webb Peoples and director Paul Anderson serve up
an interesting basic premise.  In the future, a select few males are chosen
at birth to be trained their whole life as soldiers, nothing more; veteran
soldier Todd is among the best, if not _the_ best.  But when a new
genetically engineered brand of soldier is developed, Todd and his ilk are
rendered obsolete.
>From here, the story takes a most uninspired turn.  Presumed dead, Todd is
dumped onto a trash dump planet, where he meets up with a peaceful
community of people who look and act like extras from _The_Postman_.  For
reasons that are never clear, the new soldiers attack this trash planet,
and the film becomes an outer space _Rambo_, boldly declaring, "I'm gonna
kill 'em all, sir!"  Thus ensues much machine gun action and laughable
"emotional" content where Todd finds the humanity within his tough
exterior.  It plays even worse than it sounds.

In the spirit of David Webb Peoples's economy of words with Kurt Russell's
part in Soldier, I'm going to write this review with less sentences than
lines Russell had in Soldier. I'm attempting to write this review in less
than 24 sentences.
Russell is Todd, a soldier raised from birth to kill and only kill. When
Todd is deemed obsolete, he is dump onto a forsaken garbage planet and left
to rot. Todd discovers a group of outcasts on the planet and begins to
regain his humanity. Todd's replacement soldiers come to the planet and try
to kill everyone, but Todd saves the people.
Let's just get the formalities out of the way: Soldier is one of the worst
movies of 1998, ranking right up there with The Avengers and Knock Off.
Russell, who is supposed to be a trained killer, takes his part a little to
seriously. His mute and bland performance  if it can even be called that 
is one of the sore thumbs of this movie. The lines given to Russell by
screenwriter Peoples consist mostly of "Sir!" or some other one-word
phrase. When he's not talking, he's standing around looking like a dolt or
shooting a gun killing people. Not an intensive part for the money that he
was paid.
Soldier's other sore thumb is director Paul (Mortal Kombat, Event Horizon)
Anderson. Anderson should go back to directing music videos; he hasn't made
the transition to features films as well as some other music video to
feature film directors. Anderson is not in the same league as David (Alien
3, Se7en, The Game) Fincher, Michael (Bad Boys, The Rock, Armageddon) Bay,
or Alex (The Crow, Dark City) Proyas.
Soldier is a big ball of testosterone that has no story, no performances,
and no real entertainment value. Of course, I could be wrong because the
two guys sitting in front of me during the showing often threw up there
hands during a killing and yelled things like "Yeeeah!" or "Alriiight!" or
just grunted loudly.
The script by David Webb Peoples's is thin, which is a shame since
Peoples's is the co-writer of sci-fi classic Blade Runner.
Women will fear this movie, especially if they're going to be dragged to it
on a date. Testosterone-laced and numb in the brain, Soldier is a bad
movie. Skip Soldier and save yourself 90 minutes plus admission.

 a helluva attitude, and a guy who loves the cinema.

   "Soldier" is yet another video game for the big screen which
has momentum and a terrific set going for it.  Otherwise it is
as formulaic as the genre comes, though the ultimate battle is
not between good and evil but between two men who are
merely following orders as per their lifelong training.  One of
the fighters has the moral advantage which insures the
support and cheers of the audience, however.  He has
evolved beyond the role of robosoldier into the beginnings of
a human being after his contact with a pacifist community on
a distant planet.
   The principal action of Paul Anderson's film takes place in
the middle of the next century, with a military operation that
will determine the future of a nice little community that has
built a utopia amid the detritus of a common garbage dump. 
But the story begins from the birth of one particular soldier,
Todd (Kurt Russell), who attends a military school that makes
West Point look like an institution run by the Green party. 
Instruction at this academy includes having the elementary
school boys watch three Doberman Pinchers tear apart a wild
boar, and pits the lads against one another, giving each gold
stars, apparently, for the number of successful, bare-fisted
punches he lands on his opponent.  Needless to say only a
small group survive, but even that elite company are put to a
severe test when a Robosoldier par excellence, Caine 607
(Jason Scott Lee), and a merry band of fighters virtually
annihilate the combatants, making them as obsolete as a B-1
bomber.  Todd is left for dead and dumped on a distant
planet which, for some reason is invaded by the new breed of
fighters with orders to kill every pacifist on the planet.
   For all its intergalactic, sci-fi histrionics, "Soldier" is really a
small-scale venture: in fact, the final battle is really between
just one man, Todd, and a small band of invaders.  Russell, a
fine actor who electrified the movie public with a three-
dimensional role in the under-appreciated "Breakdown," gets
to say very little, but expresses whatever minimal feelings he
has with his eyes.  
   A new study shows that kids really cannot blame their
parents for the way they turn out: at least 50% of their
character is formed by their contact with peers--most of the
rest being by genetic makeup.  Jerry Weintraub, who
produced the film, is eager to show that with the proper
nurturing, even a thirty-something soldier whose only
connection with peers has been brutally aggressive can be
made into a feeling human being once more.  The role of
sustainer and nurturer falls to the lovely Sandra (Connie
Nielsen), who has a son unable to talk since he was bitten by
a snake.  Russell is successful in showing how he and the
community change one another.  As he becomes more
human, more loving, the community realizes the need for
fighting men.  After all you can't defend your land with
flowers.  There's plenty of firepower here, some brutally
violent combat between Russell and Jason Scott Lee, and an
overly sentimental scene to conclude the work that gets some
in the audience laughing at its stickiness.
   If Russell does not get much chance to act, he does
succeed in showing off some powerful biceps and his courage
and ability to do some of his own stunts.  This is a movie
about a shellshocked military man, though it's hardly in a
class with "Regeneration," a recent, sensitive, British offering
about a group of World War I soldiers who are
institutionalized after having broken down psychologically in
the heat of battle.  Nor can "Soldier" be regarded as much of
anti-war treatise; in fact, in pointing out the naivete of the
utopian gardeners and dancers, it is a call for more balance
between Mars and Muse. Todd is, after all, ostracized by and
exiled from the community because they fear his militarism
but is called back when they realize that the pen is not quite
mightier than the sword.  Ultimately, to paraphrase Gertrude
Stein, a video game is a video game is a video game.

SOLDIER (1998)

Screenplay by David Webb Peoples.  
Directed by Paul Anderson.  
Starring Kurt Russell, Jason Scott Lee, Gary Busey.  
Rated R (contains violence and profanity)  approx. 95 mins.
Synopsis:  In the near future, Sergeant Todd, trained from birth to be a
remorseless killing machine, and his squad of merciless soldiers are
replaced by genetically engineered warriors.  Believed dead, Todd is dumped
onto a garbage planet where a small group of colonists struggle to survive.
 Todd defends these colonists from the warriors who replaced him when their
superior officer decides the colonists would make good target practice.
Comments:  On paper, SOLDIER has the ingredients to make a superior film.
It is written by David Webb Peoples, who penned the screenplay to the
classic BLADE RUNNER and the critically-acclaimed 12 MONKEYS.  It is
directed by Paul Anderson, who was responsible for EVENT HORIZON, an
unfairly criticized cross-genre film, and MORTAL KOMBAT, a popular movie
based on the video game of the same name.  It even stars Kurt Russell, who
has acted in good science fiction films such as STARGATE and John
Carpenter's remake of THE THING.  Though SOLDIER is an entertaining and
visually interesting film, it proves to be somewhat disappointing
considering the talent involved in the film's production.  
SOLDIER begins in the year 1996, when Sergeant Todd is born.  Apparently,
on the date of his birth, Todd, along with a group of other babies, is
chosen to be involved in a government(?) program to raise and train a group
of fearless ground soldiers.  Through a series of rapid flashbacks, the
audience sees Todd grow to adulthood and some of the campaigns on other
worlds that he is involved in.  Already, the audience is keenly aware of
the major flaw in the movie: nothing is ever really explained.  SOLDIER
never details (a) who Todd fights for, (b) why a technologically savvy
society needs human ground troops when they could probably find less
expensive means of achieving military goals, or (c) how our planet becomes
an intergalactic colonizing force within the next 20 years.  Apparently,
the only things the filmmakers wish us to know is that Todd is a killing
machine and the person in charge is a really bad guy.  What follows is the
standard sci-fi cliche of the underdog against a supposedly superior
opponent; in this case, Sergeant Todd and a ragtag group of colonists try
to defend themselves from a horde of genetically-enhanced, heavily armed,
well-trained soldiers.  Guess who wins.  
Having criticized the screenplay, I can now say that I still enjoyed
SOLDIER.  This is a movie which attempts to cross genres to create
something different.  EVENT HORIZON, Paul Anderson's last film, combined
horror and science fiction, giving the audience a haunted spaceship.
Similarly, SOLDIER combines science fiction with the western and the action
movie, giving us SHANE on another planet.  The mix of genres works for the
most part.  Though the story, including the ultimate resolution, is quite
obvious, the film's landscape, an apocalyptic garbage dump of a planet
presented paradoxically beautiful in its harshness, and some brilliant
pyrotechnic fight scenes make SOLDIER a fun Saturday afternoon matinee
movie.  Like EVENT HORIZON, however, SOLDIER doesn't pull any punches [no
pun intended] when it comes to violence -- one of the reasons I suspect
EVENT HORIZON was so squarely criticized.  SOLDIER is violent; it has many
bloody scenes, a number of grisly deaths, and some rather sadistic moments
(these warriors, for instance, have no reservations shooting unarmed young
children in combat situations).
Kurt Russell plays Sergeant Todd quite effectively.  Todd does not have
much dialogue in the movie; he remains largely silent.  This silence,
however, adds to the tension of the film, as the colonists fear that his
training will make him snap at any moment.  SOLDIER, thus, like EVENT
HORIZON, is an extremely tense film.  Russell, though, exaggerates the
tough guy image a little too much at times, granting the film some much
needed melodramatic camp humor.  Gary Busey plays his signature stock
character, a slick though ultimately well-meaning individual, adequately
here.  Rising star Jason Scott Lee, like Russell, isn't given much
dialogue, but he portrays the main antagonist suitably enough.
SOLDIER strikes me as a made-for-the-SciFi-channel movie with a budget.
Despite the talent behind the film, it is not great.  SOLDIER, however,
doesn't seem to carry the pretense of greatness.  It's a little sci-fi
action film which delivers enough special effects and action sequences to
carry it through.  It's not worth six bucks, but it's certainly worth a
matinee price.  
Rated R, SOLDIER contains many graphic scenes of violence which may be
inappropriate for children.  Although, to give the movie credit, SOLDIER,
more so than other recent action films like the "video game"ish BLADE and
the humorous RUSH HOUR, shows the results of violence, both physically and
mentally, on its victims.

     David Webb Peoples has contributed to some of the most compelling
screenplays of recent years.  He fashioned haunting visions of the future
in the seminal science fiction film BLADE RUNNER and the psychologically
gripping 12 MONKEYS; he has deconstructed the mythology of heroic violence
in UNFORGIVEN.  Peoples has shown a facility for turning genre films into
films of ideas.  The specific ideas with which he has concerned himself
held out the hope that SOLDIER might be something more than this week's
disposable bit of whoop-it-up mayhem.
     Instead, SOLDIER shows what happens when the writer of BLADE RUNNER
and UNFORGIVEN meets the director of MORTAL KOMBAT and EVENT HORIZON:  the
director wins, and we lose.  Peoples's script sends us to a near-future
where government soldiers are trained from birth for no other purpose but
battle.  One of these soldiers is Todd 3465 (Kurt Russell), a scarred
veteran of multiple wars who has served as the perfect warrior -- no
family, no emotional connections of any kind, no reluctance to obey any
order, no mercy.  Unfortunately, he is rendered obsolete when an even more
perfect, genetically-enhanced breed of soldier becomes the new standard.
Left for dead after a display of prowess by new soldier Caine 607 (Jason
Scott Lee), Todd is tossed on the scrap-heap of waste disposal planet
Arcadia 234, where he tries to fit into a society of marooned humans
understandably wary of this new arrival.
     I suspect that Peoples's original script focused on how the
functionally anti-social Todd begins to explore human interaction for
the first time.  He recuperates in the home of a kindly man named Mace
(Sean Pertwee), begins feeling desire for Mace's wife Sandra (Connie
Nielsen), and bonds with their son Nathan the only way he knows how.
The prologue depicting Todd's relentless training is an effective
set-up for a story about the psychology of warfare, the challenges of
re-adjusting to civilian life, and whether or not it's actually better
to create a cold killing machine to survive the horrors of war.
     That's not the story director Paul Anderson insists on telling.
Though in his production notes Anderson describes the story as "SHANE in
outer space," he actually makes it much more like RAMBO in outer space.
When the new-breed soldiers arrive on Arcadia for a training exercise led
by the heartless Col. Mekum (Jason Isaacs, wearing a thin moustache so we
_know_ he's dastardly), Todd straps on the artillery, slaps on the
camouflage paint and sets out to tear the new soldiers some new orifices.
The final half-hour generally finds Todd picking off his faceless
adversaries like red-shirts in a "Star Trek" episode, occasionally
interrupted by immense explosions and flying bodies.  All this naturally
leads to a climactic mano-a-mano between Todd and Caine in which the
hulking one-eyed terminator becomes evil personified.  Never mind that
Caine is a programmed soldier just like Todd himself, and that it would be
much more interesting to sympathize with him than to cheer his inevitable
defeat mindlessly.
     There's nothing inherently wrong with black hat/white hat action
adventures where we watch a bit of carnage and root for good to triumph
over evil.  The problem is that Anderson pretends SOLDIER is more than
that, offering scenes of Todd perplexed by a tear rolling down his face,
or recoiling at displays of kindness.  Moments that might have been
genuinely affecting instead inspire derisive laughter, because Anderson is
far more interested in visceral response than in emotional response.
Ironically, he spends most of the film reveling in dehumanizing violence
instead of showing how dehumanizing violence created his protagonist.  I
can't believe that's the story David Webb Peoples wanted to tell, which is
what makes SOLDIER more disappointing than it might otherwise be.  He
turned over a smart idea to a director determined to make a dumb movie.

Old soldiers never die, they just turn into cliches
The Warrior and the Lover are two personality aspects that find it difficult
to exist in the same body. Jungian archetypes, these two opposites need each
other to create a whole, but it's difficult to integrate both. 
Often we'll encounter Lovers who think everything is just wonderful and, with
the help of Jung's Magician, sit around imagining grand schemes. Without the
drive to manifest their plans, much less the wisdom to recognize the darkness,
all they have are dreams.
Warriors on the other hand, are ready to go to war at the drop of a hat, and
will do combat with every last bit of their energy.  They don't care enough
about anything to know what's worth fighting for: gladiators who live only for
the battle.
This dichotomy not only describes individuals that we all know, but can also
illustrate societies. America during the late sixties was a conflict between
old style Cold Warriors and the new hippie Lovers.
Todd 3465 (Kurt Russell) is a living, breathing archetype. Chosen from birth
as a soldier, he is raised by the government to be a killing machine. His
childhood is cruelty and competition. He is indoctrinated with the big rules.
Never question authority. Winning is everything. Strength beats knowledge.
A veteran of numerous intergalactic wars, Todd is 40 and he's obsolete. A new
generation of genetically engineered soldiers are faster and stronger. Left
for dead after a test battle with the best of the new killers, Caine 607
(Jason Scott Lee), he's unceremoniously dumped as trash on Arcadia 234, a
garbage world.
Obviously our hero is still alive. He finds a group of shipwrecked settlers
abandoned on the planet who nurse him back to health. When the peace-loving
colonists get a good look at who Todd is, they are afraid of him and he is
exiled to live by himself amid the junk on an environmentally hostile world.
They are the other good guys.
These Lovers find that they need a Warrior when the military coincidentally
chooses this world to conduct exercises for their improved human weapons. Todd
finds himself in the role of protector.
What could have been a fascinating look at the roles played in our culture and
the fears of an ultra-right wing future is ruined by turning the film into a
cartoon. The effects are mostly second-rate explosions or jerky slow motion.
The plot is old hat. We don't get even a glimpse at the society that created
the soldiers. Hardly anything makes sense.
The film's science fares badly. With all the remarkable advances we've made in
just 37 years (the film takes place in 2036), we're still stupid. After
conquering the stars, for some reason we use vast amounts of energy to load up
huge space ships with rubbish tote it to a landfill light years away. Even
stranger, the garbage barges appear to double as time machines. Virtually all
the trash is vintage 1960.
There is nothing in the story that is not predictable. The first thing that
Todd sees after coming back to life is Sandra (Connie Nielsen), the woman just
a little too beautiful to be living in such harsh conditions who is taking
care of him. It doesn't take a genius to foresee that her husband isn't going
to be around much longer. Is it a shock to find out that the film's climax is
an unarmed battle between Todd and Caine? Who would you guess wins?
Some of the scenes would work if this were a comedy. Todd's first awakening of
human emotion comes when he glimpses Connie's nipple poking through her thin
blouse. Later as he sits by his lonely campfire, a tear rolls down his
dramatically lighted cheek in slow motion. Supposedly this cliché isn't meant
to be humorous. Dastardly Col. Mekum (Jason Isaacs) with a pencil-thin
mustache is as real as Snidley Whiplash.
Responsible for last year's quirky and visually enticing but problematic "The
Fifth Element", director Paul Anderson sees the film as "Shane" in outer
space. Maybe, if Shane were played by Sylvester Stallone in Rambo mode. The
movie doesn't even work as an action film. There is never a question as to the
outcome. Somehow the new superior soldiers don't prove much of a match for Todd.
The acting isn't anything to write home about. Nielsen almost comes across as
a real person but is soon relegated to a background victim. Russell is
buffed-up and does a credible job but it's not much of a challenge. Uttering
around 100 words during the film, mostly what Todd does is hit things and
stare grimly into space. Gary Busey as Todd's commanding officer is completely
wasted in his low-key role.
Everything blows up and occasionally it looks cool. Sometimes the sets are
impressive. Unfortunately "occasionally" and "sometimes" don't make a film.
Most disappointing is that the screenplay is by David Webb Peoples who wrote
"Blade Runner", possibly the best science fiction movie ever made. Sharp-eyed
viewers will notice a few obscure references to that film. Peoples says that
this is not a "Blade Runner" sequel, but a "sidequel" that takes place in the
same universe.
Although that may have been the intent in his original script, the result is
more like a bad television series that the "Blade Runner" replicants watch to
pass time. Perhaps those artificial humans would find this entertaining.
(Michael Redman has written this column for over 23 years and wants to wish
everyone an appropriate Halloween...whatever you'd like it to be.)

Ingredients: Robotic supersoldier, another planet
Starring: Kurt Russell, Jason Scott Lee, Connie Nielsen
Synopsis: 
>From birth, Sergeant Todd (Kurt Russell) and other babies are raised and
brainwashed to be the perfect soldiers - - robotic in mentality;
proficient in combat; unable to speak unless spoken to; emotionally
handicapped, and; unable to feel anything but fear and discipline. 40
years later, this line of soldiers is outdated and replaced by a new
line of genetically engineered and brainwashed soldiers. Todd himself is
junked, left for dead, and dumped on a garbage planet inhabited by
shipwrecked humans. One day when the army reappears and attempts to
exterminate the shipwrecked humans, Todd defend the humans against his
former organization.
Opinion:
Usually in flicks where the main character is not human enough to carry
the film, the side characters take up the slack and supply a lot of
drama and dialogue so that audiences don't get bored. Either that or the
action content is brought way up to compensate for no personality.
(Think of ET or THE TERMINATOR). SOLDIER probably won't satisfyingly
hold the attention span of most action-oriented audiences because there
are long periods of time where the emotionally handicapped Todd (Kurt
Russell) sits silently without saying anything at all, and the audience
is left to twiddle its thumbs. SOLDIER's focus is perhaps too much on
the silent Todd, but he doesn't say enough to make it interesting. The
second flaw is that there isn't really any believable reason for the
army to go to Todd's planet and attempt to exterminate the human
shipwreck survivors, other than to force a predictable movie ending. 
A last minute showdown isn't enough. SOLDIER's futuristic and
other-worldly setting might be good enough for a science fiction novel,
but SOLDIER needs to increase its action content, creepy crawly creature
content, or side character involvement throughout the entire film in
order to attract mainstream theater goers.

What's that smell?  Why, it's Soldier, an insipid science fiction action
yarn that makes you long for the realism of Pigs in Space.
Right now, under our very noses, if you believe the timeline the film
gives us, an elite unit of men trained exclusively to be killing
machines are being raised by a top secret military unit.  Apparently
stolen from their cradles, these children are raised, in a Clockwork
Orangian fashion, to only understand discipline and violence.
Apparently, wars of the future are fought on a very small scale.  There
are only 20 of these soldiers (who survive their training, anyway), and
they're involved in what seems to be each and every war or conflict in
space.  (Oh, yes, by the way, in the next thirty years, humankind has
colonized the known galaxy).  The best of these 20 men is known only as
Todd (Kurt Russell), as you can read from the tattoo on his cheek.
In any case, this elite group of soldiers has never lost a single man
(at least until the main plot of the movie gets underway, that is).  You
see, the soldiers are being replaced.  There's a new breed of tougher,
faster, stronger soldiers (without hair, even) which are being
introduced.  And, since there can only be 20 soldiers in the entire
galaxy, Todd's unit is being retired...forcably.
For some reason, even though this replacement project must have been in
the works for most of the time he's been in command, the head of Todd's
soldier unit, Captain Church (Gary Busey), knows nothing about the
replacements, and doesn't believe in their superiority.  What better way
to test your men than to have them fight to the death?  Well, you can
guess the outcome... Todd's unit has been replaced, and Todd (mistakenly
thought to be dead) is simply thrown down the nearest trash chute.  Hey,
do you have a better way to dispose of a corpse?
Well, conveniently, Todd's coma lasts for the entire duration of an
interstellar flight to the local trash planet, where he's luckily dumped
on the top of a giant trash heap (rather than underneath it).
Strangely, this planet has incredibly strong windstorms that apparently
ignore these huge trash piles, which remain standing despite the 300+
mph winds.
Anyway, as luck would have it, there's a lost colony of humans thriving
amid the trash and the winds.  This colony adopts Todd as a pet.  But
can a man who's been bred for forty years to kill and to obey ever learn
to cope in normal society?  Or is there a conflict just around the
corner which will utilize all of Todd's lethal training?  You be the
judge.
Granted, Kurt Russell is supposed to be playing a virtually emotionless
soldier, bred only to kill and obey, but his performance is so flat,
glassy-eyed and featureless, that he's actually out-performed by a
garden snake! Just because you're an emotionless killing machine,
doesn't mean you have to  be uninteresting (just take a look at the
Terminator series).  But one look into the blank stare of Russell's
soldier makes you yearn for the thespian talents of Arnold
Schwarzenegger, or, heck, even Steven Seagal.
As the film blunders from one cliched subplot to another, it's actually
stunning to note the absolute lack of creativity on the screen.  The
closest thing the film ever gets to originality is in creating elaborate
death sequences.  And even those are foreshadowed so heavily, you could
probably name them before the deaths ever happen.
The only way in which Soldier is conceivably enjoyable is in a Mystery
Science Theater 3000 sort of way, in which, reveling in the absolute
horridness of the mess on the screen, you create your own entertainment
in the way of joking insults.  But, even then, you'd have to be pretty
desperate to pin your entertainment hopes on Soldier.

Author's Note: By my count, Kurt Russell says only 104 words during the 
futuristic fight movie, "Soldier." I'll attempt to do the same in the 
following review.
Russell plays super-soldier trained from birth. Name, blood type and rank 
tattooed on face. Russell looks great, extremely buff. His humanity 
buried by training. New genetically-engineered soldiers, including Jason 
Scott Lee, makes him obsolete. Russell discarded on waste planet. What, 
no recycling? Meets hippie colonists. Stays stoic. Stares at pretty woman,
 saves young boy, gets banished because he scares the hippies. Sits alone,
 tears flow silently in slo-mo. Touching. New soldiers arrive. Russell 
fights them. Many battle scenes, some pretty cool. Movie like long World 
Wrestling Federation match with explosions and cheesy special effects. 
Genetically-engineered soldiers die way too easy. For testosterone freaks 
only.
Postscript: 104 words. Mission accomplished, sir.

"Soldier", by director Paul Anderson, is a film in which any presence of 
originality is fleeting.  The best moments of the film are in the opning 
scenes where Kurt Russel's character Todd is shown growing up under 
strict military supervision.  Brutality through the eyes of the innocent and 
stripped of it every single day growing up is something that has a lot of 
emotional potential power behind it, and the opening scenes tap into it a 
little.  
Then it goes nowhere with that idea.  There is perhaps one rather fleeting 
scene afterwards that deals with the potential trauma of this 
dehumanization, and the rest of the film is just some of the biggest action 
movie cliches I've ever seen.  The whole idea of the inhuman, soldier-type 
character gaining some degree of humanity by defending a potential female 
love interest and family from his evil counterpart out to kill her is done, 
and it's been done much better.  I was able to predict the plot of the 
_whole_ story, which wouldn't be so bad if other aspect of the film 
somewhat interesting.
Between the action sequences, it tries to deal with the aforementioned 
issues of humanity through the performance of Mr. Russel in the film and 
the tiny little window to his soul that is his eyes, since his dialog is 
extremely limited.  His performance in that way isn't all that bad, but 
certainly is not enough to carry this film.  Other performances in this film 
are really not worth much mention at all, and they generally are about as 
weak as their characters.
But enough of this stuff about plot and character, right?  Isn't the most 
important part of an action film, well, the action?  
Even in this aspect the film is a disappointment.  In Mortal Kombat (1995), 
Director Paul Anderson proved that truly engaging use and choreography 
of action in a film can override problems with plot and produce something 
entertaining.  However, he fails to repeat that in this film.  The combat 
scenes, particularly the big one at the end, is incredibly unimaginatve.  
Fighting and combat scenes are supposed to bring about thrills in this type 
of movie, a point which even an otherwise unimpressive film like Starship 
Troopers seemed to realize.   But instead of reaching for something truly 
interesting to end the film with, it goes for the old, shoot-em up, one guy 
vs. an army type of cinema that I thought died with the military action 
films of the 80s.  If the film went with some of the ideas it opened up with 
the introduction more seriously, it could have been a rather engaging 
science fiction film.  However, it utterly failed to go in any new directions 
after that, making the film a big disappointment.

Just how many times has Paul Anderson seen Dune? I mean, when you find
yourself on a planet with massive wastelands, lots of sandstorms, and one
person who leads the social group that he's not originally from to safety or
some such crap, doesn't that remind you of a certain David Lynch film circa
1984?
Maybe if he was in Lynch's territory it would have turned out better.
Anderson, director of Mortal Kombat, and Event Horizon, set his sights on
making his "sci-fi masterpiece" with a human element this time by setting
himself down to work on a good premise movie, and ended up screwing that up,
which you'd figure would be easy. If he'd made it out of studio, tried the
independent road, the film might just have turned out quasi-semi-decent,
instead of ye load of crap which we see before us now. But he decided to
stay with the high paycheck security of a movie that relies on being blind
and not noticing the plot holes that are large enough to walk through.
The movie has a specific cadre of people drafted at birth and becoming the
perfect soldier, not speaking unless spoken to, and following all orders.
Not speaking is good news, we don't have to listen to Kurt Russell attempt
to utter a line in fact, we don't hear his voice until about a half hour
into the movie. All of these people watch atrocities, kill civilians, and go
through life without emotion. Good premise.
He's replaced, of course, when they come out with genetic models that were
designed in Japan and made in China, in otherwords, cheaper, better. And of
course he's still alive when they dump him on a waste planet. And, of
course, he finds other inhabitants and isn't quite accepted amongst them,
due to massive war flashbacks and a nice little human element that almost
works until they put the action in.
In fact, if you took out the action sequences at the end, it'd be a good
movie.
But, no, instead, you have Kurt Russell kicking butt like he always does
badly. And you end up hating the movie that started out so good, started out
so intriguing. If I could just make a single splice, I'd save it
But, hey, you know what they say, always the critic, never the criticized.

RAMBO meets MAD MAX in this follow-up to director Paul Anderson's
derivative science-fiction exercise, EVENT HORIZON (6.5/10), with Kurt
Russell collecting one of his biggest paychecks yet, and the studios
passing it off as the first official "sci-fi Western". Anderson claims
that compared to Kurt's character in this film, "Clint Eastwood is
f-king Hamlet!"
PLOT:
A boy is born and bred to become a cold-hearted, man-killing machine
with only fear and discipline as his emotions. When a new breed of
man-killers are created, his kind are obsolete. He is eventually dumped
into a wasteland of garbage, and left for dead. Discovered by a host of
"homeless people in space", this soldier attempts to grasp newer
concepts such as love and affection. Eventually, the newer mankillers
arrive on said wasteland, and the battle between this once obsolete
soldier and his replacements begins.
CRITIQUE:
Short, easy to digest, science-fiction Western, that does very little
to innovate anything in either genre, and ends up fogging your mind
with memories of gunfire and explosions, and not much of anything else.
If you like to see a lot of people get shot up, then you should check
out this movie. If you like to see a lot of fire and explosions go off,
then go see this movie. If you want to see TV's "The Commish", Michael
Chiklis play eighth banana in a mediocre science-fiction pic, then go
see this movie! Otherwise, skip it, and rent it on video one night when
you have absolutely nothing better to do, and you want to shut your
brain off for a while.
On the positive tip, Kurt Russell does play his cold, feeling-less
character to a tee. He apparently only had a handful of words to
enunciate during the entire film, but he sure made up for it in
unemotional stares. Wow, what a man! All that and he was built like a
lighthouse on steroids. Pretty good for a forty-something, if I don't
say so myself. Scott Lee also had very little dialogue (probably even
less words than Russell), but did provide for some sense of rivalry, I
suppose. All in all, the film never bored me at any point, but it also
never blew me away at any time. It basically just punched in its time
card when it was supposed to, and called it a night.
Russell's character kept reminding me of that classic line from John
Carpenter's THEY LIVE (7.5/10), where Roddy Piper says, "I came here to
chew bubble gum, and kick some ass--- and I'm all outta bubblegum!".
That's basically what Russell was like for the entire movie! He was
just there to kick ass and not much else. I had more fun that I
anticipated because I was with my friend, and we had some fun with the
crappy lines and campy hommages (I noticed at least one to RAMBO and
one to APOCALYPSE NOW). See it if you like brainless guns and
explosions, and a good performance by Russell. Skip it, if you don't
like guns, explosions or Kurt Russell.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
The writer of this film, David Webb Peoples also co-wrote BLADE RUNNER
(7.5/10), and wrote 12 MONKEYS (8/10) and the Oscar-winning UNFORGIVEN.
Isn't that so very, very odd?!
Kurt Russell has 69 words of dialogue in this entire picture. He was
reportedly paid $20million to do this movie, which rounds that off to
about $290,000/ per word. Kurt...you're a great, great man!! With a
middle name like Vogel, how could you go wrong?
Kurt played professional baseball (2nd base, AA club- California
Angels) until a torn shoulder muscle forced him into retirement in
1973. He was hitting .563 at the time of his withdrawal. His friend,
Ron Shelton wrote the Crash Davis role in BULL DURHAM (7.5/10) for him,
but the studio insisted on Kevin Costner instead.
During one particularly realistic fight scene with Jason Scott Lee,
Kurt Russell broke his ankle.
Kurt apparently only landed his role in TANGO & CASH after Patrick
Swayze dropped out. Also, he apparently only landed his role in
BACKDRAFT (8/10), after Dennis Quaid nixed it.
Kurt Russell's real-life son with partner and fellow actress Goldie
Hawn, Wyatt (Note: Kurt played the character of Wyatt Earp in 1993's
TOMBSTONE), plays Russell's character as a 12-year old at the beginning
of this film.
Jason Scott Lee most famous part before this film was his portrayal of
Bruce Lee, in DRAGON: THE BRUCE LEE STORY (8/10)-(no relation).
Note: Kurt Russell has apparently announced this film to be his last
action movie. Stay tuned!

Every star has their good and bad moments, but few can match the
rollercoaster ride that Kurt Russell's career has been on during the past 10
years. When he's hot ("Overboard," "Executive Decision"), look out; when
he's not ("Captain Ron," "Escape From L.A."), duck and cover.
 Russell must have been laughing all the way to the bank after netting
multiple millions for "Soldier," a science-fiction tale as generic as its
title, which requires him to deliver a total of perhaps 12 words -- and
considerably fewer facial expressions -- in between running around and
gunning down countless extras. But viewers may be excused if they find it's
more fun to play shoot-'em-up yourself than to watch others do it,
particularly in a movie as alarmingly shoddy and poorly written as
"Soldier."
 In several eerie ways "Soldier" echoes "The Postman," the collossal Kevin
Costner turkey the kind people at Warner Bros. dumped in cinemas last
Christmas, and anyone who feels any nostalgia for that excruciating opus
should be in a mental-health clinic rather than a movie theater. Once again,
we're treated to that hoary old tale about the lone renegade -- in this case
a genetically engineered fighting machine known as Sgt. Todd (Russell) --
who sticks up for the poor, peace-lovin' folk when their frontier settlement
is attacked by the forces of evil.
 Imaginatively, screenwriter David Webb Peoples dresses the villianous
militants in pseudo-Nazi attire, which definitely sets them apart from the
heroes, most of whom are clad in jumble-sale rags. But while the mellow
residents of the Arcadia 234 Waste Disposal Area can't seem to find a decent
clothing store, they obviously have some sort of state-of-the-art hair salon
nearby since a large percentage of the population seems to sport frosted
tips, two-tone dye jobs and carefully crinkled tresses. All Sgt. Todd sports
is a crew cut, multiple scars and an unwavering scowl, although back in the
days of the War of the Six Cities he used to coat his face in patriotic red,
white and blue greasepaint.
 If all this talk about the movie's fashion sense seems beside the point,
you should understand it's by far the most fascinating aspect of "Soldier,"
which throws buckets of blood around in an attempt to perk up a deadwood
plot. Director Paul Anderson never met a cliche he couldn't appropriate, so
the film also includes numerous scenes of bodies hurtling through the air in
slow-motion, several instances of people scurrying away from fireballs and a
handful of moments in which shadowy characters are illuminated by flashes of
lightning.
 At least "Soldier" might have had the courtesy to whip up some snazzy
visuals, but the none-too-special-effects on view here look like they were
taken from some Saturday morning kids' show; they're laughably cheap. As in
"The Postman," there's a busty babe and some lovable moppets on hand to put
our unemotional hero back in touch with his heart, so we can sit through a
sequence in which Sgt. Todd weeps -- in slow-motion, naturally. Anyone who
pays good money to sit through "Soldier" will feel like joining in the pity
party.

Plot: In the year 2036 Todd is a solider who has been programmed from 
birth as an emotionless killing machine. But then the ruthless Colonel 
Mekum introduces a new and superior breed of genetically-engineered 
soldier designed to replace the other soldiers. Todd is defeated up 
against Mekum's top soldier, Caine 607, and, left for dead, is dumped on 
the garbage world of Arcadia 234. But Todd there survives and is granted 
refuge by a group of survivors from a crashed spaceship who have built 
their own peaceful community. However his emotionless and violent 
reactions have him barred from the community. But as Mekum's forces move 
in and start exterminating the community, perceiving it as a military 
threat, Todd becomes their unexpected saviour.
'Soldier' came with enormous promise - there were many that hailed it as 
a film that had the potential to become a genre landmark. It had a 
script from David Webb Peoples who had written such genre classics as 
'Blade Runner' (1982) and 'Twelve Monkeys' (1995), as well as having won 
a Best Original Screenplay Oscar for the stunning anti-Western 
'Unforgiven' (1992). The advance word on the film was good - Kurt 
Russell was so enamoured with the script that he changed his schedule on 
other films so that he could star. And one can see much has been placed 
into the production - the film is clearly made on an A-budget.
Which all adds up to make 'Soldier' seem even more of a disappointment. 
What held the potential to be a landmark genre film turns out a 
surprisingly ordinary variant on the cliched humanization of the inhuman 
soldier/android theme tried and familiar from the likes of Harlan 
Ellison's script for 'The Outer Limits' (1963) also entitled 'Soldier' 
and films like 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' (1991), 'Universal Solider' 
(1992) and 'Solo' (1996). Indeed the story arc that 'Soldier' carves is 
so identical to 'Solo' - programmed soldier/android gets free from 
military control, discovers a human side amid a group of simple but 
honest villagers and stands up in armed conflict against his military 
programmers and, at the climax, in hand-to-hand combat with his intended 
successor - that one is tempted to cry plagiarism. There are also times 
where it is just shabbily written - Jason Isaacs' colonel is 
single-dimensional and cliched, we never get to learn what drives his 
ruthlessness, and his decision to cleanse the garbage world is very 
poorly motivated.
The film proves a competent-enough run through of all the cliches and 
had it been made on a much smaller, more intimate scale one suspects it 
might have been a considerably more likeable film. It's just on the 
A-budget it is made on, its cliches collapse into over-inflated 
pretension. The scenes among the people on the garbage world are so 
pumped up with patently artificial emotive cues - the honest and earnest 
simplicity of the communal lifestyle, ragged but plaintive orphans, the 
woman shot in warm and sensual silhouettes, even for God's sake the 
pseudo-Celtic wailings of Loreena McKennit on the soundtrack - that it 
collapses into a forcedness that verges on the absurd. It all mounts to 
an efficiently large scale but unmemorable action climax. Director Paul 
Anderson (no relation to 'Boogie Nights' director Paul Thomas Anderson) 
is clearly shaping up as a regular genre contributor - he debuted with 
the unpretentiously enjoyable 'Mortal Kombat' in 1995 and made 1997's 
'Event Horizon', where his directorial style triumphed despite one of 
the most brainless scripts of any sf film in recent years. But, as 
'Event Horizon' and this show, Anderson has a good deal of talent but 
clearly little discernment when it comes to scripts.
The film is almost saved by Kurt Russell's performance. Or more 
ironically and accurately, his lack of a performance. The very blankness 
of Russell's battle-scarred face, the subtly-made up sunkenness of his 
eyes, the blank minimalism of the dialogue he gets, creates a character 
that fascinates in its hollowness. All the emotion comes to be in the 
smallest movements of the eyes.

Sometime in the not-so-distant future, a new generation of soldiers
will be created.  Babies are conscripted right after birth and begin a
harsh training regimen that spans the entirety of their young lives. 
They are groomed to become ruthless, strong, and tireless fighting
machines.  Todd (Kurt Russell) is just one of many of these new breed
of soldiers.  During a training exercise, soldiers take shooting
practice where cardboard cut-outs of both innocent bystanders and
enemy troops move left and right.  In one particular instance, an
enemy soldier shields himself behind an innocent person.  While the
other soldiers-in-training freeze for a moment to contemplate their
shot, Todd, giving only a moment's hesitation, coldly pulls his
trigger.  The cut-out of both the enemy soldier and the innocent
person are obliterated.  As everyone else looks at him, he shows no
signs of remorse or regret.  This soldier will graduate at the top of
his class. 
There have been many movies that focus on the comeuppance of a soldier
and the bitter sacrifices that he makes in fighting for his country,
or in this case, his planet.  Here, it's not all that different,
although it takes place in the future where the weapons do
significantly more damage and the landscape seems eternally ravaged by
war.  Todd evolves into a lethal fighting machine whose emotion and
humanity have been stripped away.  When he is replaced by an even more
potent type of soldier and is subsequently discarded on a planet far
away, the story shifts gears and parallels the plight of the war
veteran with no place to go.  The fight continues inside of him, and
here is a person who can not be easily reintroduced into society. 
Falling upon a settlement on this planet, he is first taken in.  They
try to teach basic skills such as gardening.  Their attempt to
assimilate Todd back into normal society injects a little bit of
humanity, but Todd's aggressive behavior and alarming tenacity begin
to frighten the settlements' denizens.  It seems that the only way for
Todd to be appreciated is for some battle to take place.  And, (no
surprise here) an opportunity to show his fighting skills soon
presents itself, ironically with a landing party that consists of the
upgraded soldiers that replaced him back on Earth.  
"Soldier" doesn't break any new ground and could have been easily
named Rambo IX if it starred Sylvester Stallone.  Yet, for the most
part, the film was tolerable.  I liked the offbeat choice of casting
Kurt Russell as the aging war veteran.  And the film wisely decides to
keep dialogue at a minimum, allowing it to be a mindless thrill ride. 
The film's best part showcases a final 25-minute battle pitting the
veteran Todd against a platoon of next-generation soldiers.  Given its
limitations, "Soldier" is all that it can be.

For those interested in the true spirit of moviemaking - or what's left
of it in mainstream Hollywood - movie which are star vehicles are
terrible things. As a rule, the ignore general principles of cinema
because they are not made to advance the media but rather to advance the
career of a particular actor. An actor might be chosen on the up-and-up,
to give him exposure; or he might be chosen on the way down to hand him
a paycheck. Generally, though, the actor doesn't matter, and SOLDIER,
the latest from the beleaguered Warner Brothers, exemplifies this: the
picture lacks pizazz. 
The star for the vehicle in this case is Kurt Russell, otherwise known
as the man of thirty words or less. Russell plays Todd, a human trained
from birth in the ways of waging war and becoming emotionally distanced
from the carnage he has wrought. The movie lets us see this degenerate
process, but by the time the real plot starts, we're into Todd's later
years. He's about to be replaced by a new breed of soldiers, ones who,
instead of being trained *from* birth, are genetically selected *before*
birth. The pride of this class - Caine 607 (Jason Scott Lee) - will be
our villain, and you know he's the villain because he has a staring
contest with our hero near the movie's start. 
Between the two leads, less than a full typed page of dialogue is
spoken, and it's possible to imagine a script which is ninety percent
stage direction. Director Paul Anderson, who helmed last year's icy
thriller, EVENT HORIZON, doesn't show any inventiveness here and instead
is content to let the actions play out on screen ad nauseam. Todd, upon
being replaced, is left to die on a garbage planet; but in order to
stretch the running time out, the villains return to the garbage planet
on a "routine patrol" and set the stage for the final firefight. Events
are predictable from the time that the setups are made, and neither
Anderson nor scriptwriter David Peoples attempts to show any
creativeness here. 
The most annoying plot facet is the reason that the whole of the movie
comes to be: Todd fails to show physical superiority against Caine - in
fact, not even Todd and two of his companions can best the baddie - but
near the end of the movie he shows remarkable prowess with automatic
weaponry. It's not as though Todd undergoes any significant character
changes throughout the plot of the story, and so the plot has a very
canned feeling about it. The best route through this disaster is to take
it lighthearted in spirit, and treat it as a parody of typical action
fare, like UNIVERSAL SOLDIER. A strict interpretation, however, reveals
an unmistakeable and unforgiveable lack of style, class, or substance;
and by next year, a large percentage of the people who have seen this
will have taped it off of network television.

>From the director of Event Horizon comes Soldier, a bland and
uninspired action film, flowing with richly-textured cliches and a
soothingly sensual story with almost no originality whatsoever.  Paul
Anderson, whose last film is far superior to this one, unfortunately
forgot that action films need innovation to survive.  But Soldier,
penned by Blade Runner writer David Webb Peoples, merely begins with an
interesting idea and regresses quickly into a competently-made bore.  
Not even a mute Kurt Russell can inspire a glimpse life in the film.
The best moments are early on, when we meet our hero, Todd, as a young
boy.  He and other young males are forced to go through military
training that begins at birth and ends in the late teen years.  The
training is harsh and grueling, and enforces simple rules like "mercy is
for the weak."  The military breeds the boys to be emotionless killing
machines; this is one of the interesting ideas in the film, for most
movies about amoral monsters take the morally easy route by making the
monsters not quite human in some way (The Terminator comes to mind).  
That's about as far as the originality goes, for Todd (played by Russell
as an adult) and his fellow soldiers are soon replaced by bigger and
faster superhuman soldiers, genetically engineered by Colonel Mekum
(Jason Isaacs).  
Thought to be dead, Todd is dumped on the garbage planet of Arcadia
(you know it's bad when the planets have Star Wars-like themes); while
there, he meets a peaceful band of garbage people, the most prominent
members being Mace (Sean Pertwee), his beautiful wife Sandra (Connie
Neilsen), and their mute son.  Lucky for the film, the military decides
to test their new soldiers on Arcadia, assuming that no one lives there
(and certainly having no idea that Todd is still alive).  Todd,
naturally, becomes the only force capable of standing up against the
superhuman maniacs.  And he bonds with the mute kid.
And, unfortunately, there's not much else to say about it.  Soldier
isn't downright awful; Anderson, though clearly not at his best, is
incapable of making an ugly picture.  The special effects are good, and
the sets are nice (much of the garbage planet is convincingly done). 
The digital effects are also swell, and the action sequences are pretty
square.  The problem is that you, I, and everyone else has seen all of
this before.  Stuff explodes.  People die.  The hero wins.  I mean, come
on -- familiarity is okay, but Soldier is so familiar that it really
just strikes us as boring.
If there's anything interesting aside from the setup, it's the acting. 
Russell is always a watchable performer, and he plays Todd the way Todd
needs to be played -- silently, and with no emotion.  It's hard to say
whether or not Russell took the role seriously, because there isn't
enough characterization to show a significant change in whatever small
personality he has.  Backup performances from Neilsen and Pertwee both
exceed the quality of the material, while Jason Isaacs is mildly amusing
in his dreadfully cliched role (as the head military guy who refuses to
listen to reason).  
If I sound lost for words, that's because I am:  Soldier is a standard
action picture.  It's too loud to be considered serious science fiction
(everything in the film explodes at some point), and since Anderson
relies on hollow shots of Todd crying or Todd staring to convey depth, I
wouldn't be surprised to find that Peoples' script was a little more
thought-provoking than the film.  It's not a loathsome movie -- there's
nothing morally objectionable in its content (except, maybe, that the
film is action pornography that pretends to have depth, but that's an
entirely different subject).  It's likely that most will describe
Soldier as "just another action film," and, with that in mind, you can
decide for yourself whether or not it's worth your time.

For those of you who've always thought that Arnold Schwarzenegger was
too emotional in THE TERMINATOR series, Kurt Russell, as Sargent Todd in
SOLDIER, is so unemotive that he gives a whole new meaning to the word
acting.  With all the charisma and liveliness of a tree, he gives a
wooden performance as a wooden character.  Where's the art in that?
Director Paul Anderson, whose last movie, EVENT HORIZON, deservedly made
many of 1997's worst of the year lists, is back with another space
movie.  Borrowing many of the scenes from STAR WARS and the look from
BLADE RUNNER, he paints the now popular bleak vision of the future.
(Has anyone ever thought that the future might be better?)  With so few
science fiction movies being made every year, Paul Anderson's bad ones
are in danger of polluting the market for other would be science fiction
filmmakers.
The story opens in the present as babies, including Todd, are chosen to
be raised in the army in ways that would make the Hitler youth camps
look like knitting societies by comparison.  In a cold, steel gray
environment, they are trained to watch violence without flinching.  The
young boys are made to watch as wild boars fight dogs to the death.  The
movie contains realistic scenes of 8-year-old boys beating each other to
a pulp as the blood spurts from their battered bodies.  (The adults
treat each other worse in one of the goriest films of the year.
Eyeballs are almost ripped out of their sockets, limbs snapped, bodies
mutilated and so forth, ad nauseam.)
The body of the film happens in the year 2036, when new models are
replacing Todd and his generation of soldiers.  Todd still has rippling
muscles, but his haggard face, full of visible battle scars, shows he's
past his prime.
The new model of fighter, typified by Jason Scott Lee as Caine, can run
faster and fight harder than the veterans.  The only characteristic they
share is that all soldiers have their first (and only) name, rank,
serial number and blood type tattooed prominently on their cheeks.
Director Anderson has no concept of subtlety.
Todd loses out in a fight to the (almost) death with Caine so he is
banished as waste material to a desolate planet.  Think there might be a
rematch?  You are way ahead of the story.  Actually you could easily
complete the predictable screenplay.
Once on the planet, Todd finds that there is what looks like an old
hippie commune there.  They've been hoping for years to be rescued.
Todd, acting like a robot, has two modes -- staring and fighting.  In
the first, his brain seems to be in an idle loop.  In the second, he's a
mean killing machine who is smarter, if not faster and stronger, than
the new edition soldiers.
Todd spends a lot of time getting beaten-up and generally abused, but he
manages to keep on going.  In our audience, one of the few big laughs
came from some young kids, who were inappropriately at an R rated movie
with their father.  After one of Todd's big falls, one kid yelled out,
"He got a big owie!"  Ah, too bad writer David Webb Peoples couldn't
have come up with some funny lines like that to insert into the leaden
script.  Only Gary Busey, as the head of the old soldiers, gets any
decent lines.  His folksy wisdom from his "old daddy" provides a few
lines of much-needed humor.
"You must feel something?" the woman whom Todd comes to stay with asks
of him.  Although Todd, in one of the few times he speaks during the
movie, comes up with a reply, the real answer is that he doesn't feel,
not in any normal sense.  He's a human being whose life has been
programmed since birth.   He doesn't feel; he just moves along on
autopilot.
If SOLDIER had been rewritten as a parody, it might have had some hope.
Or, if the lead had been given some complexity and a touch of humanity,
that might have helped.  What we are offered instead is a movie in which
we have to watch soldiers who kill men, women, and children with no more
compassion than we'd reserve for an ordinary housefly.  If the story had
something to say, we might forgive its needless gore, but it doesn't.
SOLDIER has the depth of a television-wrestling match, but without the
comedy.
SOLDIER runs 1:40.  It is rated R for strong violence and profanity and
would be acceptable for older teenagers.

Starring:  Kurt Russell, Jason Scott Lee, Connie Nielsen, Jason Isaacs,
Gary Busey, Sean Pertwee.
Screenplay:  David Webb Peoples.
Director:  Paul Anderson.
Numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past sci-fi,
suspense thrillers. Soldier is a multicrossbreed between the likes of
Terminator, Aliens and offspring. The problem with such mixed genes is
that the final product is a real mongrel  not well made and should have
been put down before production got off the ground. Besides this, the
action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this
day and age. The fight scenes between Jason Scott Lee and Kurt Russell
seem laboured, slow and sluggish, and could have done with better
choreography. Russell who is usually a good actor in B-Grade action
flicks is unusually hampered by his character  Sergeant Todd, who seems
more like a Sergeant Toad. Besides having almost no dialogue, his
character appears stunted, zombie-like which is in line with his screen
persona, but scores little points of empathy with the audience. This
movie has not made me change my opinion about director Paul Anderson,
whose last epic Event Horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my
mouth. Although this movie does not come anywhere close to the
strangeness of former, it is still a long way from anything considered
desirable.

In this sci-fi thriller, Kurt Russell plays a New Millennium
mercenary, chosen shortly after his birth by nefarious, militaristic
government forces. He was psychologically programmed and brutally
trained to be a highly disciplined, emotionally dead fighting
machine. Raised with the credo - "kill or be killed" - he became a
lean, mean monster who subsequently proved himself in many galactic
battles. Then, at age 40, he suddenly becomes aware that he and his
colleagues have outlived their usefulness and are being replaced by a
new breed of test tube warriors who have been genetically engineered
to stronger and meaner. After losing a gladiatorial bout to one of
these psychopaths (Jason Scott Lee), Russell is unceremoniously dumped
like garbage on a distant planet and left for dead, but he's nursed
back to health by a pacifist space pioneers who were stranded there
years before. Predictably, when the new mercenaries, under a wretched,
villainous leader (Jason Isaacs), return and attack the settlers,
Russell defends them. The underlying theme of David Webb People's
script is not new. It's a sci-fi adaptation of the western, "Shane,"
just as the theme of "Star Wars" bore a striking similarity to "The
Searchers" and "Outland" was adapted from "High Noon." Unfortunately,
director Paul Anderson ("Event Horizon," "Mortal Kombat") is focused
on ballistic, video-game visuality rather than character
development. Kurt Russell has announced that this is his last action
movie, and his subtle characterization proves he's ready to move on to
other things. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Soldier" is a
brutal, blood 'n' guts 3. The trick is that it could have been a
treat.

I'll make a prediction right now.  Kurt Russell, whom I admire as an
actor in a lot of movies, will win the Razzie award for worst actor of
1998 in 'Soldier'.  I read somewhere that Russell utters a total of only
68 words in the entire film and to me he spends the rest of the movie
looking like a mindless version of Frankenstein's monster, one of the
living dead and a cyborg all rolled into one.  Russell gave an excellent
performance in 1979's 'Elvis', a television classic that brought him an
Emmy nomination as Best Actor.  Some of his best work can be found in
movies such as 'Breakdown', 'Unlawful Entry', 'Backdraft' and 'Tequila
Sunrise'.  But as an action hero?  Russell is too talented for that.
His portrayal of the ordinary guy in a lot of films makes his presence
work but 'Soldier' is junk.  An unsavory mix of several science fiction
films scaled down into one mess.
Beginning in 1996, Russell is taken from the maternity ward of the
hospital he's born at by a secret military attaché that trains him from
the cradle to be an unbeatable, unstoppable and pure fighting machine.
We see his progression as a soldier at various ages until his training
ends at the beginning of manhood when he turns 17.  Several more years
pass and Russell is now around 40 and a new breed of soldier is created
and their Colonel (Jason Issacs) is arrogantly pleased that his men, he
feels, are superior to the men lead by a rather sedate Captain (Gary
Busey) who is Russell's commanding officer.  Issacs challenges Busey to
select his best men to take down his most effective new breed of soldier
(Jason Scott Lee).  Russell is one of the men selected and during the
hand to hand combat exercise, Russell is presumed dead along with a
couple of other men but not before he can take out one of the new
soldier's eye and scar part of his face.
The bodies of the now "obsolete" soldiers are disposed of on a desolate
planet but Russell turns out not to be dead and upon landing with a
large batch of space junk, meets the inhabitants of the desolate waste
planet and tries to lead them in the oncoming invasion to be carried out
by the deranged Colonel responsible for his current fate.  The people
are taken a back to Russell's deadly form of fighting power since their
way of life is relatively peaceful and the climax is pay back and
revenge in a most ordinary way.
Director Paul Anderson ('Event Horizon') has made an real turkey of a
movie that cries out as the definition of 'empty' if you were to look it
up in the dictionary.  The film's obligatory violence is meaningless and
to a larger extent, no focus is given to create any interesting
characters as a contrast to Russell's character.  What made 1984's 'The
Terminator' work was the fact that the characters portrayed by Linda
Hamilton and Michael Biehn were truly human and were a good character
contrast to Arnold's mechanical elements.
Trashy and exploiting, 'Soldier' will have you asking "What's the
point?" when you leave the theatre.  Not bad for the testosterone crowd
but for the rest of us, this film is an example of too much money spent
on a film that's been done a million times before.
