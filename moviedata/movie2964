     Idealistic young lawyer William Best leaves the security of his
prestigious family practice to go to work public prosecutors office in
Manhattan.  Out on the town with one night with a colleague he meets
and is bedded by the seductive Meadow Adare, little knowing that she is
an escort girl and that the treat was paid for by his friend.  Their
relationship blossoms as she introduces him to a world of parties and
hard drugs.  But the heroin takes its toll and he is unable to live up
to his high flying job.
     Despite fine acting by the two leads this movie plumbs the depths
of cinematic clichi.  The idealistic ivy leaguer falling prey to the
corrupting influence of the underworld; the hooker who starts dating
one of her clients and; the power of drugs to wreck peoples lives.
>From the moment she introduces him to heroin he hits a downward slope
and never once looks like pulling himself off of it.  The message, that
smack kills, has been told before (although perhaps it needs telling
time and time again) but in this instance the storyline is predictably
told and halfway into the film there is little doubt what the outcome
will be.
