Colm O'Neill's (screenwriter Barry McEvoy) house sits at the crosshairs 
of the Catholic and Protestant neighborhoods of Belfast, hooded by a 
homemade firebomb protection.  When Colm begins a new job as a barber at 
Ballylackey Mental Hospital, he finds a fast friend in Protestant poetry
lover George (Brian F. O'Byrne, HBO's "Oz").  They're tipped off to a 
wide open market opportunity, when the owner (Billy Connelly, "Mrs. Brown")
of the only men's hair piece company in Northern Ireland lands in their 
institution for scalping clients in director Barry Levinson's ("Diner") 
"An Everlasting Piece."
While "An Everlasting Piece" doesn't strain at the yoke to offer up
twee Irish charm like this year's  "Saving Grace," it's tale of rugs set
against 'the troubles' that wears a bit thin overall.
Colm and George manage to convince 'the scalper' to hand over his list of
clients to begin their new side endeavor.  They immediately run into problems
with their first client, Mr. Black (Des McAleer), who confuses their doorway
sales pitch for a hair piece as a speachifying on herpes (the Irish poking
fun at their own accents?).  They sell him their sample after the initial
confusion, but in their eagerness to make the sale, they take a check, which
inevitably bounces.  McEvoy strains his screenplay with a character that
refuses to pay in order to get Colm to take the piece back by force, only
to be chased by a group of Black's lads, then run down by a pack of dogs
(did Black pack a steak under that piece or what?).  Colm's been abandoned
by George, who took off in their car after being accosted by an apparently
released Scalper (a never more wasted Billy Connelly).
This is a film about the Irish conflict, so of course, the two get stopped
on a lonely road by the IRA, one of whom buys that same dog-chewed hair
piece.  When the duo ends up being questioned by the police, Colm refuses
to turn the IRA in.  Conflict ensues between the two budding businessmen,
who are also being challenged by the Toupee or Not Toupee company in a sales
showdown.
"An Everlasting Piece" is a pleasant enough little comedy, but there were
so many wrong moves which could have been avoided.  Did McEvoy really believe
that his audience would be amused to see Colm's mother appear with different
styles of underwear on her head, ostensibly her 'eccentric' way of protecting
her hairdo from her own cigarette smoke?  Is he such a fan of The Talking
Heads that he had to cut to inexplicable, gratuitous scenes of Colm and 
girlfriend Bronaugh (Anna Friel, "A Midsummer Night's Dream") in a movie 
theatre playing "Stop Making Sense?"  Why is Colm's 'gesture' to save the
business late in the film any less distasteful than what George has 
objected to in Colm's behavior?
Director Barry Levinson has a diverse roster of films behind him, but I
must admit confusion as to what drew him to this small offbeat tale.  While
setting the Irish conflict against the rug trade is an inspired idea (based
on the screenwriter's father's experiences), the telling dawdles and never
quites finds its course.

_An_Everlasting_Piece_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
If for nothing else, young actor Barry McEvoy certainly earns points for
finding a new and unusual way of addressing the oft-explored issue of the
Northern Ireland Catholic/Protestant conflict in his script for
_An_Everlasting_Piece_.  Fortunately, there is more to savor in Barry
Levinson's film of McEvoy's script--though those charms aren't quite
enough to take this modest comedy over the top.
Interestingly enough, the term "over the top" is one that really cannot
be applied to the film, a fairly surprising fact given its wacky premise.
 Sometime in Belfast during the 1980s, Colm (McEvoy) and George (Br√≠an F.
O'Byrne)--a Catholic and a Protestant, respectively--meet on the job as
barbers in a mental hospital and become fast friends.  When they learn
that a recently admitted patient aptly nicknamed "the Scalper" (Billy
Connolly) was the only toupee salesman serving all of Northern Ireland,
Colm and George see an opportunity to make it big as his piece-pushing
replacements.  That's easier said than done, for the newly-christened
"Piece People" (as Colm and George come to call themselves) aren't the
only team with the same idea--emerging from nowhere are the equally
enterprising but superior salesmen operating under the eyecatching name
Toupee or Not Toupee.
Colm and George's biggest obstacle, however, ultimately proves to be
their differing religions.  That fact may not be an issue to them or
their families, but it's the only one to the Irish Republican Army,
namely one member (Colum Convey) with whom the pair come into close
contact.  It's a credit to McEvoy and Levinson that the film smoothly
slides from light laughs to heavier material without a hint of
awkwardness.  Also contributing greatly is the cast of mostly fresh
faces, who are adept at handling both the comic and the dramatic.  More
than holding her own with the instantly likable pair of McEvoy and
O'Byrne is the delightful Anna Friel, who makes Colm's girlfriend Bronagh
as smart as she is spunky and sexy.
Despite the cast's considerable charm, _An_Everlasting_Piece_ still
falls short of the mark.  McEvoy, while displaying promise as a writer,
is at this point more skilled with his acting instrument than he is with
a pen.  His lively sense of humor makes for a number of amusing
sequences, but sometimes these scenes are inconsequential diversions;
case in point, a broad scene where Colm's mother mistakes a stranger
sleeping outside the house for his younger brother.  Also, the character
of the Scalper is rather clunkily kept in the action far longer than
necessity requires, sticking around for no real payoff.
Now and again, though, McEvoy serves up some pointedly, sometimes
absurdly, funny moments, such as Colm and George's initial encounter with
the IRA man; and his passionate concern over the Northern Ireland issue
shines through.  Similarly apparent in _An_Everlasting_Piece_ are the
high spirits with which all involved approached the project, making this
easygoing entertainment that more impossible to hate.  It's unfortunate,
then, that some shortcomings also make this undeniably likable and
sometimes lively film difficult to completely embrace.

   All attempts at comedy seem to have been swept under the
rug in a movie that at best could be called intermittently
whimsical, and deserving at least some attention for the way
it ridicules the pretensions of the British forces in Belfast and
the I.R.A. alike.   With a script by Barry McEvoy which is
oosely based on the character of his father, "An Everlasting
Piece" is directed by Barry Levinson ("Rain Man," "Diner")
whose lenser, Seamus Deasy, as set up his camera in the
Ardmore studio in Dublin and on location in Dublin and
Belfast.
   Inspired by the tired concept that political battles aside,
friendship and humanity are all that matters, "An Everlasting
Piece" is a small film that conveys the spirit of Kevin Allen's
"The Big Tease" with virtually none of that film's pizazz, wit or
charm.  Levinson opens the picture in a hospital for the
emotionally disturbed in which patients report for haircuts to
barber Colm (Barry McEvoy)--who got his job through his
nurse girl friend Bronagh (Anna Friel)--and his fellow cutter,
George (Brian F. O'Byrne).  Though George is Protestant and
unassuming while Colm is Catholic and cocky, they recite
lines of poetry to each other and get along just fine.  When
Colm learns of a list of balding men maintained by the
hospital's most aggressive patient, known as The Scalper
(Billy Connolly)--because he literally lifted scalps from four
who'd have preferred not to get their hair cut--he and his pal
George manage to obtain the register and go into the
hairpiece business.  Believing that they would have absolutely
no competition throughout Northern Ireland, they are
dismayed to discover that another firm, Toupee or Not
Toupee, is doing business in their town.  A large potential
customer will award a contract to the firm that sells the most
rugs by midnight of Christmas Eve, leading Colm and George
aggressively to seek out the glabrous of their politically
unstable town.
   The whimsy comes from attempts at Saturday Night Live-
type sketches as George and Colm gain acceptance by their
first customer (who refuses to pay because "possession is
nine point of the law"), a large number of British troops who
have become bald because of the stress of their hair-raising
job, and most notable of all by a balding member of the I.R.A.
(Colum Convey) who cannot make up his mind whether to
shoot the two as spies or give them some business.
   The concept of an I.R.A. man looking as vicious as a
Klanman with head covered by a ski mask but as meek as a
shorn lamb during the day may have struck some in the film
business as bizzare and amusing, but comes across as tired
as it is humorless.  Even the usually rollicking Billy Connolly,
so convincing as the queen's regular date in "Mrs. Brown"
and so hilarious during his appearances on Letterman, settles
in for a role as a looney tunes with which he is unable to do a
thing.  If Toupee or Not Toupee is more than a rhetorical
question, my advice if you must choose your movies carefully
is not toupee.
Rated R.  Running time: 105 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
