Indian (not Pakistani) Om Puri is one of the sub-continent's greatest 
actors as well as a major player in international cinema and TV.. He 
must have one the best-known pockmarked faces in the world, along 
with actor Robert Davi (the drug lord in the James Bond film "License 
to Kill"), and Manuel Ortega (Panama's former lord). In 1998 Puri 
attracted more world attention in "My Son, the Fanatic" in which he 
plays a Pakistani cab-driver, in England for 25 years and most 
assimilated --too much by Pakistani standards --while his only child 
reverts to Moslem fundamentalism.
Those roles are reversed in "East is East." Puri plays George Khan, 
who, in 1937 emigrated from Pakistan to Manchester, married 
Englishwoman (Caucasian) Ella, had seven children with her. We meet 
the tribe in the early 1970s living in Salford, a working class 
suburb  of Manchester. Ma, Pa  and some of the kids run their fish 
and chips place. Husband and wife are a loving --and sexually active 
--couple, in spite of George being bullheaded and mercurially 
autocratic, as well as often charming, especially to Ella. The 
children (six sons and one dancing daughter) have grown up in a 
spirit of  total assimilation. They may be "brown kids" to racists, 
but they feel like most other English youths of their social class.
When it comes to religion, all but one pious son go through the 
motions of pleasing and obeying Dad.  Ella acts just like a Muslim 
mother (but she is no convert), mediates between kids and Dad, uses 
wiles and strategies to keep the peace and is lovable totally but not 
soupily.
The children are so westernized that when Dad's away they consume 
gluttonously ham and sausages. When Dad's head is turned, one son 
flirts (or more?) with a neighbor's blonde daughter and most of the 
siblings do "unacceptable" things.
Matters, however, really come to a head when the senior son is about 
to wed a Pakistani belle in an arranged marriage. At the start of the 
ceremony, the young groom, in a switch from Hollywood movies about 
brides fleeing the altar, runs away, and off.
We are left wondering a bit about the earlier years of the Khan 
family when George gets to center stage as a newborn  Muslim. 
Pakistanis and Brits seem to co-exist quite well. although racism 
does lurk in the background. And reverse racism too.  But there's no 
Paki-bashing by hooligans, no egregious discrimination. Perhaps 
because those are Enoch Powell years when the racist. politician 
wages war on immigration, perhaps too because of a mid-life crisis, 
George reacts with increased traditionalism of which the most acute 
symptom is his strong desire is arranged marriage for sons 2 and 3.
Thereby hang the most comical events of the film, in fact 
transitions from benevolent irony to farce and to near-screwball 
comedy. I will give no details, not even clues as to the developments.
"East is East" is a grand little movie, funny yet also pathetic, 
amusing but also touching on very serious matters regarding 
immigration, the many faces and degrees of assimilation or 
non-assimilation, mixed-marriages, the old and the new, and much else 
of crucial importance to the brown or white or black or whatever 
inhabitants of the British Isles.
The source play was a major hit in England, and so was the movie. The 
British Film Academy gave it several nominations, the "Evening 
Standard" and the London Film Critics voted it as Best British Film 
of the Year. It was Dublin-born Director Damien O'Donnell's first 
feature and the play (1996) as well as the film-script, both firsts 
by actor-turned-writer Ayub Khan were highly honored in the UK and 
the Continent.
The acting is impeccable, all the more so since many of the players 
are also newcomers. The Khan children, by the way, are all but one of 
mixed parentage and all felt in familiar territory. Not so director 
O'Donnell, an Irishman who steeped himself in the cultures of 
Pakistanis in the UK as well as of England in the 1970s -- with 
wonderful success.
The movie is knowledgeably and intelligently built, with credibility 
and authenticity, a number of un-telegraphed surprises (from a 
strange circumcision to a barber's chair) and a heartfelt feeling for 
all involved, including the dictatorial George, whose likable sides 
survive his imperiousness.
My single caveat comes from the sometimes hard to catch in full some 
bits of dialogue spoken in (there must be a term for it but I don't 
know it) working-class English. But I had no problem with some of the 
Arabic formulas and courtesies.

   When Bob Dylan sang "The Times They are a-Changing'"
some thirty years ago, not even he may have envisioned just
how much the world would transform itself by the turn of the
century.  The Iron Curtain is long gone, Vietnam and China
are edging toward prosperity, and even North Korea has
opened up serious negotiations with Japan, Australia and the
United States.  We're living in what NY Times journalist
Thomas P. Friedman calls the Global Society, a momentous
event that has impacted cultures in virtually every corner of
the planet.  As though to preface this great transfiguration,
small rebellions have been taking place in the families of
traditional cultures--the sons and daughters reacting against
the hidebound customs and cultures of their parents when
these practices have limited their freedom.  In Irish director
Damien O'Donnell's first feature, "East is East," adapted from
a staged play by Ayub Khan-Din, an Anglo-Pakistani family
living during the 1970s in the Manchester suburb of Salford is
a hotbed of insurrection.  The seven lively children of
Pakistani expatriate George Khan (Om Puri) and his English
wife Ella (Linda Bassett) are for the most part rejecting every
aspect of the culture to which their father clings while
embracing everything English from fish-and-chips to hot dogs
and ham to the local bimbos (who reject their own parents'
narrow-mindedness and embrace the young Khans).
   "East is East," which garnered awards in Britain
such as "Best British Film of the Yea"r from the London Film
Critics and from the Evening Standard and was nominated for
six BAFTA Awards including Best Picture, is alternately
riotous and dramatic in the best tradition of the genre and
features one of India's great performers, Om Puri, in the role
of the stressed-out father.  The subject of rebellion against
the culture of parents is hardly a new one in the movies. 
Who can forget poor Tevye in Norman Jewison's 1971
adaptation of Joseph Stein's musical "Fiddler on the Roof" as
a man trying preserve his family's Jewish heritage against
growing odds?  Just recently,  Soori Taraporevala adapted
Rohinton Mistry's book "Such a Long Journey" about a quiet,
decent man, Gustad Noble, who is angered that his son is
disobeying orders to go to engineering school.  What stands
out in all three stories is the depth of characterization: the
keeper of the legacy is not portrayed as an entirely
unsympathetic character, though the audience is coaxed to
root for the new.  Each in his own way has good reason to
opt for the antique ways in view of the seemingly anarchic
changes that the modern world is creating.  The urge to
preserve ancient cultures that have withstood the test of time
is understandable.
   George Khan, for example, is under a strain.  In his
Manchester suburb of 1971, war is being pursued by his
native Pakistan against India over possession of Kashmir. 
The crypto-fascist politician, Enoch Powell, is gaining some
support among the British people for his ideas of racial purity
and his suggested policy of repatriating all immigrants.  And
all but one or two of his seven children have assimilated into
English society, making friends with English neighbors--most
of whom display no anti-immigrant feeling.  While Maneer
(Emil Marwa) is the only obviously religious member of the
Khan children and Abdul (Raji James), is the typical good-boy
who always wears a suit, Saleem (Chris Bisson) attends art
school while feigning residence at an engineering academy; 
Meenah (Archie Panjabi), who is the only girl in the family,
eagerly plays soccer with the fellows on the street; Tariq is
the classic rebel disgusted with his father's backward-looking
presumptions; and Sajid (Jordan Routledge) is the source of
much of the picture's comedy as a 12-year-old boy who
forever wears a parka despite the October heat and who is
belatedly dragged to a doctor to be circumcised.
   When George's eldest son (Ian Aspinall) bolts from an
arranged wedding minutes before he is to take vows with the
woman he has just seen for the first time, George cracks
down on the others, determined to impose Pakistani culture
on his Anglo-Pakistani children.  George's English wife for the
past twenty-five years, Ella (Linda Bassett), is of two minds:
she wants her children to go their own way while determined
to have them respect George properly despite their
differences.  The various small incidents involving the playing
off of the father against each of his children and ultimately
committing an act of violence against this wife is climaxed in
a wonderful payoff scene involving a meeting between the
Khans and the family with whom George has arranged a
marriage for two of his children.  As uncomfortable and
insincere smiles give way to outright animosity, George Khan
is slowly led to an understanding that his children's world is
not the same as his own.
   Director O'Donnell crams in a great deal of comedy by
displaying the outdoor scenes involving the seductive
machinations of two local English girls toward the Khan
children and by ironically showing a small, bespectacled red-
haired kid distributing literature for Enoch Powell while
happily shouting "Salaam Aleikem" to George Khan and
playing happily with the Khans' youngest kid.
   The only aspect difficult to understand is that George would
ever marry a local woman, his children making the obvious
point that their embrace of the English culture is in no way
more daring that of their own dad.  The ensemble acting is
splendidly natural with Om Puri's charisma capturing the
attention of the audience, while Brian Tufano's camera
effectively illustrates the dismal banality of working-class
Manchester streets.
Rated R.  Running Time: 96 minutes.  (C) 2000

Set in 1971 in Salford, East is East concerns the mixed race Khan family
in which George, the Muslim father of the family, struggles to maintain
the traditions of his native Pakistan while running a fish and chip shop
with Ella, his English wife. George's children refer to him as Ghengis
and are intimidated into conforming with the expectations of Pakistani
culture, a culture which they feel as foreign. Apart from one son who
takes his Islamic instruction seriously, this next generation of Khans
sees little value in dietary restrictions, circumcisions and arranged
marriages, but is instead attracted to bacon, visits to the local disco
and snogs in the back alleys. Although we are aware of the racial
tension conflict between the Khans and some of their neighbours, this
never threatens to overwhelm the story - we are more concerned with the
struggles within the Khan household, and this saves the film from being
overly worthy.
Adapted by Ayub Khan-Din from his own play, the film centres on the
patriarchal George (Om Puri) and the no-nonsense Northern housewife Ella
(Linda Bassett). Both lead performances are excellent. George is at once
a monster, capable of beating his wife and children, and a victim of his
fear of betraying his cultural heritage. The situation is not one that
obviously lends itself to comedy, and we are always aware of the
grimness of the family's situation, but much humour is found in the
daily routine and conflicts in the Khan household, and in George's
efforts to arrange a suitable marriage for his sons.
Partly a harrowing social drama and partly a comedy of family life, the
film never quite stands out as either. It is nevertheless encouraging
that the British film industry can make films that are very much home-
grown product in the tradition of socially-aware British film-making,
and provide the distribution and marketing to make them commercially
successful, at least in the UK domestic market. It will be interesting
to see how the film performs elsewhere.

In Damien O'Donnell's "East is East", a screen version of Ayub Khan-Din's
stage play, Linda Bassett plays the white English wife of a Pakistani
immigrant (Om Puri) to 1970's Salford. Written by an Asian, it is
essentially a situation comedy dealing with the cultural "no-man's-land" in
which the children of immigrants find themselves, and the strains inside the
family produced when the younger generation begins to feel the pull of the
host culture.
The plot is perfunctory, and I won't take up your time with it here. I was
enticed to see it by a number of inexplicably positive reviews in the London
press. I thought it was cheap, offensive, unimaginative and peopled entirely
by racial and class stereotypes of the most crass kind. It portrays a Muslim
father who is totally indifferent to the happiness or wellbeing of his
children, fanatically devoted to the ritual and trivial aspects of his
religion, spouting obscenities at all around him, taking out his frustration
in violence on both his wife and his children when he is unable to get his
own way, physically ugly and unpleasant in his personal habits.... the list
seems endless. The realism and brutality of the father's violence sits
particularly uneasily in something that does not even aspire to
tragi-comedy. There is hardly a racial stereotype that this cardboard
cut-out central figure does not embody. His family too seem like ciphers
introduced to embody clichés of  "the younger generation" stuck between two
cultures: we have the gay brother, the religious brother, the terrified
younger brother (whom Puri has no hesitation in subjecting to a late
circumcision in order to keep up appearances when he finds that it was
overlooked at the correct time), the rebellious daughter. Only the white
English second wife seems  noble and long-suffering, and even capable of
some degree of common affection. The other Asian family that we meet is
similarly monstrous, the father bullying and overbearing, the wife cold and
critical and obsessively ambitious for her offspring, the two daughters ugly
and seemingly mindless.
The comic elements are hackneyed and heavy-handed, descending to slapstick
more than once, as when a "sculpture" looking like a section cut out of an
inflatable rubber "adult doll" is thrown on to the lap of the surly visiting
mother, or when the children try to hide the bacon and sausages they have
been eating when they hear their father's approach. This stuff is sub-Alf
Garnett ( a British TV sitcom working-class Fascist and racist bigot par
excellence, for those of you who don't watch British TV). In fact a real Alf
(and I know he is not a rarity) would be delighted with the whole ethos of
this film. It could be hired for British Movement coffee evenings. There is
not a shred of understanding of or respect for the Islamic way of life in
this film. What it seems to say is "Everything you've ever heard about the
Pakkies (or whatever derisory word you want to insert) is true". Presumably
it is supposed to be excused by the fact that it was written by an Asian.
This argument doesn't cut very much ice with me. I am not saying that a
writer or a director has any kind of duty to present "PC" depictions of a
particular race or group, but merely to pick up on a dominant racist
carricature and reinforce it uncritically like this seems to me inexcusable,
and frankly lazy. I think it betrays the same degree of internalised racism
as the outcry of one of the brothers in the film: "I don't want to marry a
Pakkie!".
Compare (if this isn't too much of a stretch of the imagination) Puri's
brutal patriarch in "East is East" with Topol's character in "Fiddler on the
Roof". Like Puri, he was a man brought up in traditional religious and
social values to which his children would not adhere, but his reaction was
sadness and apprehension for their future happiness, as he wrestled to
understand the new and unfamiliar world that they were growing up into. But
far more importantly, in Topol's case, we could see the value of the
traditions that he clung to, how they had served the Jewish people and how
they could produce happy and loving families and a context in which a good
life could be lived. Traditional Judaism was treated with respect. That
film/play was three dimensional, its ideas could be looked-at from different
angles. Yet it was only a comedy as well - a musical comedy at that. What a
pity "East is East" couldn't have had a touch more of the big-heartedness of
"Fiddler". What a lost opportunity!

     In 1946, before there was a partition between Pakistan and
India, Muslim George Khan (play by Om Puri) moved to London, started
a business running a fish and chips shop, and took a second wife, a
non-Muslim English woman.  He then reared six sons and a daughter by
the English wife.  He raised his children to be good Muslims--better
Muslims than he could have afforded to be.  They took little looks
at the English world around them, but they did what George wanted.
When they needed discipline, George did his fatherly duty and
corrected them.  But overall life went fairly smoothly.  That is
what happened for twenty-five years as George saw it.  The seven
children, living in the same house but a different universe, saw
things quite differently.  They wanted to assimilate into the
society they saw around them.  To them Dad's presence was always a
hazard.  He could catch them eating pork or marching in a Christian
procession.  Generally they just pretended in his presence to be
practicing Muslims, the path of least resistance.  Outside the house
they were living the new world of freedom that England and
particularly 1971 brought.
     For twenty-five years their world views diverged more and more.
But there was no reason for a confrontation.  The first sign that
things were not right was when the eldest son, in the middle of an
arranged marriage ceremony walked out and went to live in London.
George is bewildered by this strange behavior, but never questions
if perhaps he might be part of the reason.  After all he did nothing
but fulfill his role as father as Islam seems it.  The family
certainly could not fault him for that.  It would be going against
Allah.  But two of his other sons are now becoming a little too
English.  It is time to bring them back to their religion by
arranging good Islamic marriages for the two of them.
     The script follows the sons around showing the character of
each as they try and perhaps fail to be like the people around them.
The youngest son is picked on by each of his siblings and even his
father calls him by the nickname "Bastard."  He frequently hides
from the world in a shed behind his house or retreats into his parka
which he wears day and night, on the street and even to bed.  It is
his own portable cave to retreat into.  When it is discovered that
somehow he is not circumcised his father gives not a jot of thought
to a little boy's fears, the religion says he must be circumcised
and, of course, he will be.
     EAST IS EAST was produced for Channel 4 television in England,
following in the traditions of MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDERETTE, and SAMMY
AND ROSIE GET LAID.  Those dealt with Indians fitting into London
lower-middle class Manchester neighborhoods, this film deals with
Pakistanis.  EAST IS EAST is the most pointed of the three dramas
and by far the best story.  Tensions between George and his family
mirror those between the Pakistanis and their neighbors, many of
whom espouse Enoch Powell's anti-immigration policies and use it as
an excuse for intolerance.  (Enoch Powell's 1968 "Rivers of Blood"
speech argued against allowing non-white British subjects to
immigrate into Britain.  His speech contained some rather dire and
fanciful predictions of a Britain in which the whites were a
persecuted minority.  The speech did not end his career, but it
ruined it.  A brilliant classical scholar but less than savvy
politically, his views were quickly exaggerated and adopted by a
racist minority who used his arguments as an excuse for racial
intolerance.)  George faces the intolerance of a neighboring Powell
supporter and tries to break up the Romeo-and-Juliet relationship a
son of his has with the daughter of the neighbor.
     The story finds an almost perfect ending in a very understated
but poignant exchange between George and a neighbor boy.  This film
packs a great deal into a small space.  I rate it an 8 on the 0 to
10 scale and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.

There have been countless films about cross-cultural clashes in small villages
or cities. We have seen everything from "La Cage Aux Folles" to just about
every variation on the big city life of Italians mixing with Latinos from "West
Side Story" and onwards. There are, of course, the big city films dealing with
racism and mixed marriages from Spike Lee. "East is East" is one of the rare
few that deals with Pakistanis living in a working class suburb in England.
Although often fascinating and revelatory, the film is so uneven that you are
never sure whether it is meant to be a comedy, a drama or both.
The film stars Om Puri (who has appeared in scores of Indian films, not to
mention Hollywood films such as "Wolf" and "Gandhi") as George Khan, the
Pakistani patriarch in a household that includes seven kids and his
semi-tolerant British wife, Ella (Linda Bassett), in Salford, Manchester. The
house is small yet seems accomodating for such a big family. Some of the more
colorful kids includes Meena (Archie Panjabi), the daughter who has a
predilection for soccer, Saleem (Chris Bisson), an art major masquerading as an
engineering student, Tariq (Jimi Mistry), a disco-loving dancer who has a white
girlfriend (Emma Rydal), the young Sajid (Jordan Rootledge) who is always
wearing a parka and fears circumcisions, and Maneer (Emil Marwa), who is often
serious and silent. 
But there is friction in the house, mostly involving George and his ideals. A
few years earlier, his eldest son, Nazir (Ian Aspinalli), refused to go through
with an arranged marriage and was thus ousted from the family, declared by his
father as "dead." Now the older sons, Tariq and Abdul (Raji James), are about
to undergo a similar fate thanks to George's stubborn upholding of traditions
past. What the father seems to forget is that he has married a white woman for
the past twenty-five years, despite initially being married to a Pakistani
woman. There is also the culture change and how the kids speak in the British
tongue, not their own, and have developed and adapted according to their
environment. But George will not listen to what his kids or his wife want, it
is only what he wants for the family and it finally creates more harm than
good. 
"East is East" starts badly with the kind of heavy, indiscernible British
accents you usually find in Mike Leigh's films, lots of cheaply comical
innuendoes, and some desperate gags. Incredibly, when the film shifts its focus
from the overall ludicrous shenanigans of the family to George, it starts to
have more meaning and depth. It is no secret that Om Puri brings the film its
soul, wavering uneasily between friendliness and seething anger. The transition
is abrupt (as it was in "Not Without My Daughter" with Alfred Molina playing a
comparable patriarch with similar shifting moods) and unshakable - after all,
he is also a hypocrite for thinking that his kids will not see that their
mother is not Pakistani. The fact is that even when Tariq acknowledges this to
him, George still thinks he is right and that creates frustration with his
family, not to mention physical abuse. 
My big complaint with "East is East" is that the film never quite makes up its
mind as to what kind of film it is. When it becomes dramatic and saddening, it
really becomes serious. The comic relief is too reminiscent of low-grade
Hollywood comedies so it certainly detracts from its high-minded darkness
(there is a scene involving the purported Pakistani girl, whom Tariq is chosen
to marry, and her family that involves some crude business with a piece of
sculpture that would have seemed right at home in "American Pie"). This
constant shifting of moods and tone may coincide with George's character but it
does not prove to be as compelling or cohesive a film as it should have been.
Somehow, the comedy and the drama only meet halfway.

Culture clash, you aren't human if you haven't experienced it. For members of 
the Khan family it's the regular routine. Dad George, (Puri) believes that 
even though his children are of mixed Pakistani and English descent, that 
they will follow every rule and traditional custom as if they were living in 
Pakistan. This is very hard to enforce, because it's the early 1970s, his 
family lives in a Manchester suburb, and six of his seven children want 
little to do with him or Pakistan. Maneer Khan is the son George wishes the 
other five boys were. A traditional Muslim, he sees his fathers ways as a 
sanctuary from pop culture. While not as religious as Maneer, Abdul Khan is 
another good son. He's very prim, always showing up in a suit, and says very 
little. Saleem Khan is an aspiring sculptor who tricks his dad into thinking 
he's going to college to become an engineer. Tariq Kahn is the rebellious 
badboy who is dating the dimwitted girl next door and frequently attends the 
forbidden discos. Sajid Khan is the youngest Khan who just got circumcised, 
and always wears a parka no matter what the weather is like. Meenah Khan, the 
only girl in the family, and she loves to play soccer on the streets. 
Finally, their mother Ella Khan (Bassett) loves her husband, but also wants 
the children to have lives of their own. There is actually one more Khan 
named Nazir. George arranged a traditional Pakistani marriage for the boy 
(where both the bride and the groom have not met until the ceremony takes 
place) who runs from the altar and disgraces the family. George forces the 
family to refer to Nazir as "dead."
This unique bunch could produce a bounty of humor, and at times it does. A 
lot of this movie is very, very funny. However, it is also very, very sad. 
George is so set in Pakistani ways that he frequently beats his wife and 
children when they disobey him or Pakistan. He spouts off insults, calling 
them illegitimate children, female dogs, etc. In today's times he would get 
sent to jail instantly. Georges actions detract from the film because editing 
is not this movie's greatest marvel. A scene of George continuously beating 
his wife is put in between two funny scenes involving the sexual preference 
of Nazir. One thing I absolutely will not forget about this movie though, are 
the two brides George tries to set Abdul and Tariq up with late in the film. 
There is no real way to describe them, they have no actual lines, but they 
alone are worth the price of admission. Performances are very good in this 
movie. Om Puri and Linda Bassett are effective in both the dramatic and 
comedic sequences. All the Khan children are excellent as well. Bit players 
also make up a large part of the movie. A young woman in love with Saleem, an 
anxious dalmation, and a little boy who is Sajids friend are all memorable. 
If you listen very closely to the last few lines of the movie, I bet you'll 
be rolling in the aisles. While the film tries to leave you with a humorous 
intention, that still doesn't overshadow the domestic abuse subplot. The 
movie got too disjointed between the two for my tastes, and I left the 
theater thinking the movie was just OK. My opinion later changed to a 
slightly more positive one, but it's still only enough to mildly recommend 
this movie. So is this, "A comedy with attitude from a house with no 
latitude?" The film's tagline promises us that, but it's far from the truth. 
Despite great performances from a relatively unknown cast, and some very 
funny material, East Is East is much better off as the comedy the posters 
promote, not the drama that lies beneath.

named Nazir. George arranged a traditional Pakistani marriage for the boy 
(where both the bride and the groom have not met until the ceremony takes 
place) who runs from the altar and disgraces the family. George forces the 
family to refer to Nazir as "dead."
This unique bunch could produce a bounty of humor, and at times it does. A 
lot of this movie is very, very funny. However, it is also very, very sad. 
George is so set in Pakistani ways that he frequently beats his wife and 
children when they disobey him or Pakistan. He spouts off insults, calling 
them illegitimate children, female dogs, etc. In today's times he would get 
sent to jail instantly. Georges actions detract from the film because editing 
is not this movie's greatest marvel. A scene of George continuously beating 
his wife is put in between two funny scenes involving the sexual preference 
of Nazir. One thing I absolutely will not forget about this movie though, are 
the two brides George tries to set Abdul and Tariq up with late in the film. 
There is no real way to describe them, they have no actual lines, but they 
alone are worth the price of admission. Performances are very good in this 
movie. Om Puri and Linda Bassett are effective in both the dramatic and 
comedic sequences. All the Khan children are excellent as well. Bit players 
also make up a large part of the movie. A young woman in love with Saleem, an 
anxious dalmation, and a little boy who is Sajids friend are all memorable. 
If you listen very closely to the last few lines of the movie, I bet you'll 
be rolling in the aisles. While the film tries to leave you with a humorous 
intention, that still doesn't overshadow the domestic abuse subplot. The 
movie got too disjointed between the two for my tastes, and I left the 
theater thinking the movie was just OK. My opinion later changed to a 
slightly more positive one, but it's still only enough to mildly recommend 
this movie. So is this, "A comedy with attitude from a house with no 
latitude?" The film's tagline promises us that, but it's far from the truth. 
Despite great performances from a relatively unknown cast, and some very 
funny material, East Is East is much better off as the comedy the posters 
promote, not the drama that lies beneath.

_East_Is_East_ (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
Children rebelling against strict parents is common comedic fodder on
television and the big screen, so it's a tribute to the makers of this
British comedy that an idea as familiar as that is made fresh.  Part of
that has to do with the point of view, which is from an Anglo-Pakistani
family, the Khans, in '70s Britain.  The seven children born to Pakistani
George (Om Puri) and the British Ella (Linda Bassett) want to be ordinary
products of their turbulent times, but George insists on nothing less
than a traditionalist upbringing for his kids, including arranged
marriages for all of his sons.  The lengths to which George--who is a big
hypocrite, considering he's married to an Anglo woman, who is his second
wife, no less--comes to assert his power over his family are monstrous,
but Puri's performance adds an invaluable layer of vulnerability.  Puri
makes one believe that he really does love his family and wants the best
for them; it's just that he refuses to see any beliefs other than his own
as being so.
While there is serious grit to its story, _East_Is_East_, adapted from
Ayub Khan-Din's play by director Damien O'Donnell and Khan-Din himself,
is foremost a comedy, and there are plenty of laughs to be had from
various domestic situations, culminating in one raucous climax.  It's a
credit to O'Donnell that the comedy not only doesn't cheapen the serious
issues addressed in Khan-Din's story but that it feels like an integral
part of the bigger picture.  As a result, _East_Is_East_ is one of the
rare films that gets to have the best of both worlds: hit serious and
true emotional buttons while delivering a genuinely fun time.

When the father of two would-be brides compliments George Khan (Om Puri
from MY SON THE FANATIC) on his having six beautiful sons, George
immediately sets the record straight.  He has only five sons, now since
one is dead.  Actually, the supposedly dead son is very much alive; it
is just that his father has written him off and removed all traces of
him from their home after the boy walked out during his arranged
wedding.  The young man was offered a beautiful bride but one that he
neither loved nor knew before the wedding day.
In a comedic drama of clashing cultures, EAST IS EAST tells the story of
a Pakistani man, his English wife and their 7 kids, who live in a
working-class neighborhood in England.  The family owns a small
fish-and-chips shop called George's English Chippy, in which everyone in
the family pitches in to keep it going.
Trying to run his family with Muslim strictness, George is a
good-natured blowhard.  His wife, Ella (Linda Bassett), whom he loves
dearly, generally ignores his attempts to rule their family with an iron
glove.  Only when it comes to his marrying off their sons does she
reluctantly yield.  Their marriage is basically a good one, full of
playfulness and love.  But, when pressed, he reverts to his own
upbringing and lays down the law in his household, in which he thinks
that the father should be lord and master.
Most of the movie is a sugary confection of little episodes typified by
the one about the circumcision of the youngest son, Meenah (Jordan
Routledge), a boy about 12 years old.  In a completely unbelievable
incident, the mother realizes that Meenah, whom she had undoubtedly
diapered a thousand times, was never circumcised as she had assumed.
Meenah is seen urinating -- an activity that occurs with bizarre
frequency in the film -- by a Muslim cleric, and the cleric is shocked
that the boy is not circumcised.  The father quickly arranges for an
operation ("It's only a little operation.  It won't hurt."), which puts
an understandable amount of fear in the lad.  His older sister torments
him after the operation by drawing a picture of a penis, which she tears
in two, taunting him by saying "Ouch!"  This produces the show's only
substantial laugh.
When the father tries to marry off two more of his sons, the would-be
brides turn out to be some of the ugliest women around.  This sets up
the story's overly long and bittersweet concluding segment, in which the
good-spirited picture turns mean and the father loses our respect but
not his wife's.
Director Damien O'Donnell, working from a script by Ayub Khan-Din,
continually pulls his punches, never quite making either a truly funny
film or a biting social satire.  The result is a movie that's kind of
cute and kind of poignant, which all adds up to being only kind of nice.
EAST IS EAST runs 1:36.  It is rated R for violence, sexuality and
language and would be acceptable for most teenagers.

 East Is East (1999) 3 stars out of 4. Starring Om Puri, Linda Bassett,
Ian Aspinall, Jimi Mistry, Raji James, Emil Marwa, Chris Basson, Archie
Panjabi and Jordan Routledge. Directed by Damien O'Donnell. Written by
Ayub Khan Din. Music by Deborah Mollison. Rated R.
 With a title borrowed from a line in a Rudyard Kipling poem, you are
aware beforehand that "East Is East" is going to be a story about a
clash of cultures.
 And so it is. This 1999 British release is a mixture of comedy and
drama, set in the 1970s. The story revolves around the mixed-race Khan
family.
 As the story opens, George Khan's eldest son, Nazir, has disgraced by
father by fleeing from his arranged marriage.
 Undeterred, George continues to plow ahead and try to control the lives
of his six remaining children.
 George, who came to England from Pakistan and married an English woman,
tries to run his family as if he were back in the old country.
But that type of patriarchal domination doesn't work in swingin'
England, and his children continually rebel as their lifestyle of discos
and bellbottoms clash with their father's idea of studying the Koran and
wearing traditional Pakistani garb.
"East is East" is an interesting movie. As portrayed by Om Puri, George
Khan is a character with whom you can empathize and scorn
simultaneously.
 He is a bully, always yelling and cursing at his kids, demanding they
follow his precepts simply because he is the father and his word is law.
But he also is a lovable figure, only wanting the best for his
offspring.
 He cannot understand them wanting to make life decisions on their own.
His attempts to turn his home and family into a little piece of Pakistan
are continually thwarted by his free-spirited offspring.
 "East Is East," despite its cultural baggage, actually is very
universal in theme. Parents, especially those with teen-agers, will be
able to identify with George, while young viewers will certainly see
parts of themselves in the Khan clan, while recognizing traits of their
parents in George.
 For those filmgoers who say they want more diversity in their movie
selections, "East Is East" fits the bill. At about 96 minutes, it is
charming in its own rugged way, a film you can appreciate as well as
enjoy.

The immigrant experience can be difficult for families where the
parents adhere to the customs of one culture, while raising their
children amidst another. This film is an exploration of this conflict,
with the additional complication that the children are interracial.
The film is set in the early 1970's and begins by introducing George
Khan (Om Puri), a Pakistani immigrant who 25 years earlier married a
white Englishwoman, Ella (Linda Bassett). The couple, along with their
7 children, run a small fish and chips shop in Northern England. The
large family is cramped in a small house in a working class
neighborhood and manage a decent existence on their limited income.
Their cramped quarters is often a source of conflict, but the main
source of tension by far is the clash between George's desire for the
children to strictly observe Islamic and Pakistani customs, and their
desire not to.
The children are able to cope by meeting George's overbearing demands
when he is around, and by doing what they want (drink, eat pork, date)
when he is not, although some individuals rebel more than the others.
The dichotomy between their actual existence and the one they present
to their father, plus the difficult manipulations required to hold the
two separate, provides much of the humor in the film. The children
manage this dual existence, but only to the point when their father
decides to arrange their marriages. This is one event where they
cannot both placate their father and satisfy themselves.
The story of a domineering and sometimes abusive father, and the
ensuing conflict is not particularly original. The interesting aspects
of the relationships in this story are George's motivations and his
apparent hypocrisy. George is clearly holding his children to a
stricter standard when it comes to marriage choice than he held
himself. Part of the reason is that he is proud of his own ethnicity,
but he sees that without his overt control, his children's culture
will diverge from his. George does not see his children as fully
Pakistani, so he attempts to force them to be.
Another reason for George's behavior has to do with why the story was
set in the 1970's. At that time, British residents of South Asian
origin were subject to more overt racism, like a political movement
for repatriation. Although there are some who will always be
prejudiced against a differing skin color, others will only reject a
person of a different culture. The Khan children have little trouble
in their associations with their contemporaries because they are
British kids just like their friends.
The story, written by Ayub Khan-Din and based on his original play, is
built on a solid foundation, but could have gone further in its
explorations. The conflict between George and his children exists only
at a surface level, whereas George's internal motivations are more
engaging. The film focuses more on the former, although Puri is able
to express the character as more than just a brute, as the
underwritten role might project. The relationship between George and
Ella is also seemingly rich yet underserved. Basset is convincing as a
woman who yields to her husbands demands not through fear or weakness,
but through empathy and love. It is unfortunate that the plot focus so
little on this dimension. The direction by Damien O'Donnell is capable
but not particularly noteworthy. The film does manage to balance drama
and humor, although its sense of humor can be quite crude and not all
that funny.
Recommended. The story does not simply use the stereotype of the
authoritarian immigrant father, and thus it presents an intelligent
examination of the cross-cultural family. The clash of mindsets is
used as both of source of conflict and of humor. The film would have
been more engaging if it had delved further into the relationship
between the parents, instead of spending too much time focusing on the
children. It will be entertaining for a general audience, but it will
have the most resonance with viewers familiar with the immigrant
experience.

Oh, great - it's another movie about a mother from the U.K. trying to
cope with a bunch of kids.  Hot on the heels of Agnes Browne and
Angela's Ashes comes East is East, an award-winning play-turned-film
about a family that pisses in pots and bathes in a tiny tin basin.  But
unlike these other films, East actually features a strong paternal
figure  a Pakistani man intent on raising his kids under the strict
tenets of the Muslim religion.
George Khan (Om Puri, My Son the Fanatic) left Pakistan and his first
wife in the 40s and has been happily married to Brit wife Ella (Linda
Bassett, Oscar & Lucinda) for twenty-five years.  The Khans own a
fish-and-chips shop, and their seven children - six boys and a girl, who
range in age from twelve to adult - are at a point in their lives where
rebellion is to be expected.  But these youths have more to revolt
against than your average teens experimenting in the thriving Manchester
counterculture scene of 1971.  The kids try to shun Pop's religion (they
call him `Genghis') and have to be physically herded into a van that
drives them to private religious studies.
As the film opens, the oldest Khan son Nazir (Ian Aspinal) makes like
Julia Roberts in Runaway Bride and bolts out of the ceremony for his
arranged marriage.  Inspired by the growing tension between his native
country and India, as well as a subplot involving a fascist politician
preaching racial purity as a major platform of his campaign, George
forges ahead and tries to set up surprise weddings for his next two
sons, Tariq (Jimi Mistry) and Abdul (Raji James).  Things in the Khan
household start to boil over as Ella is no longer able to tow the fine
line between devotion to her husband and the natural instinct to protect
her kids.
While this description may not sound like a load of laughs, East is
downright hysterical.  The clash between different cultures is very
effectively portrayed in the screenplay, which Ayub Khan-Din adapted
from his own smash-hit play (for you indie film buffs, he played Sammy
in Sammy and Rosie Get Laid).  People may take offense to the domestic
violence that occurs in the film, especially when those incidents are
sandwiched between comedic scenes.  And some people may think that the
film is filled with horrible racial stereotypes about Pakistanis.  A
neighbor mutters that the Khans look like `a pick-a-ninny picnic,' and
at one point, Tariq shouts, `I don't want to marry a Paki!'  Well, he
doesn't, and I wouldn't if I were him, either.
East was nominated for a handful of British Academy Awards, as well as
running away with top honors from the London Critics Circle.  The acting
within the dysfunctional family is as good as I've seen, and most of the
young actors have little or no acting experience (some may be familiar
to fans of British soap operas).  And Puri is fantastic as the
overbearing father that calls his wife `missus' and all of his kids
`bastard.
1:36  for adult language, domestic violence and brief nudity

IN SHORT: And now, an awards laden flick from across the Pond
"Tradition" may have been a rousing song from Fiddler on the Roof, but
the concept of maintaining old country ways after immigrating to the New
World is universal. It's also at the root of East Is East, a very funny
tale of cultures clashing and a father's doomed effort to force his
kidlets to adhere to the old ways. It's a bigger problem than it reads,
because Papa hasn't toed the line perfectly.
As if in rigid opposition to My Son The Fanatic the last Om Puri starrer
in which he played a tried and true assimilationist, in East is East,
Puri's character is determined to maintain "traditional" Pakistani
culture and traditions in his Manchester, England based family. But for
George Khan (Puri), tradition stopped when he changed his name and
abandoned his still in Pakistan wife. George marries the English native
Ella (Linda Bassett) and bows to her wish to remain in her Catholic
neighborhood. Twenty five years down the line, while his seven kidlets
have been raised in the Muslim faith, they take delight in participating
in the pageantry of Catholic holiday street parades. East is East gets
off to a delightful start as the mom and kidlets, carrying a statue of
the Virgin Mary in such a parade, are tipped that dad has come home
early from Mosque and is spectating a couple of blocks up the road.
Think Keystone Kops as they dash through back alleyways to avoid
George's fearsome wrath.
And George's wrath is fearsome as is his overwhelming need for control
over every aspect of his family's life. Central to the story is the Paki
tradition of arranged marriages, which is where we start this flick.
Eldest son Nazir (Ian Aspinall) is the first to the altar, dressed in
traditional and very colorful gear. But, for reasons that will lead to a
good chuckle in the third act, Nazir bolts for the door and leaves his
attractive bride to be at the altar. George declares that his son is
"dead" and that no one in the family will have contact with the boy.
Completely ignorant to the fact that this particular tradition is
abhorrently retro to the raised as English kidlets, George begins work
fixing up sons 2 and 3, Tariq (Jimi Mistry) and Abdul (Raji James).
Outside of dad's earshot, these boys call themselves Tony and Arthur,
and are having quite a nice time entertaining the local girls and
hitting the discos, once mom and dad are asleep. Abdul is a fairly
observant Muslim, Tariq is the exotic boy toy beloved by the girls in
the clubs. When they meet their matches, oh, the horror.
Culture clash movies, if they're well written, are usually fun to watch
because you can step way back as an outside observer. While most of the
situations in this film are terrifically funny, George is a brute, with
all that implies. At his core is a worn down terrified man who, for all
his attempts to adhere to tradition, is as hypocritical as he sees his
kidlets. His balance is Ella, and the reasons she puts up with George
are what you'll be discussing afterwards. Love, I guess, is a strange
and wondrous thing.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to East is East, he would have paid...
Good performances by both Puri and Basset got them nominations for the
Brit equivalent of Oscar and the film has taken noms as Best Picture and
Best British Film. Those who frequent the arthouses will flock to this
flick. Those beyond teenflicks who want something a little more
substantial should head there as well.

When English mother Ella Khan (Linda Bassett) calls her offspring, it's 
Meena, Saleem, Maneer, Nazir, Tariq, Sajid, and Abdul. When she calls 
her husband, it's George. This is not the least of the ironies in which 
this sometimes probing, sometimes pratfalling social comedy of the 
English melting pot is steeped.
George Khan (Om Puri of My Son the Fanatic) is a Pakistani who by the 
early '70s when the movie begins has been living in Manchester for many 
years, but who hangs onto his roots like an ironwood on a muddy 
riverbank. He's taken himself out of the old country, but he'll be 
damned if he'll let the old country out of his English-born kids, who 
don't know from Pakistan and could care less. His wife is an English 
lass, but his sons will marry Pakistanis, and he'll do the arranging, 
just like back home. As the story opens, George is preparing to marry 
off his oldest son Nazir (Ian Aspinall) to a Pakistani bride he has 
never met. When Nazir bolts from the altar, George writes him out of the 
family, and clamps down on the rest of his brood.
George is something of a monster, but only when he's crossed, which 
isn't a bad definition of a monster. He's lovable when things are going 
smoothly, and there's a genuine sweetness to the affection between him 
and Ella. But when anyone in his family resists his orders, he becomes 
mean, and worse, violent. He's a terrible hypocrite, his English wife 
and his fish-and-chips shop at odds with his super-Paki prejudice, but 
we're not sure why. If you asked him - as his kids do - he'd clout you.
Yet most of this movie of cultural preservation vs. assimilation in 
prejudice-ridden working-class England is very funny. It's got a knowing 
script, adapted by Ayub Khan-Din from his successful play and mounted by 
first-timer Damien O'Donnell. The ensemble cast defines each of the 
characters distinctly but keeps it a completely credible family, from 
the older kids down to little Sajid (Jordan Routledge), who's so 
confused about his identity that he's always hidden inside the hood of 
his parka like the kid in South Park. And both Puri and Bassett are 
simply wonderful, expert at showing the humanity that is at the root of 
their many contradictions.
O'Donnell does a good job, and gives us a splendid movie, but you can't 
help thinking that with a bit more experience he might have found a way 
to integrate the different moods more seamlessly, and blend the comic 
styles, which range from genuine moments to Richard Lesterian flights of 
madcappery. They make us laugh, but we're not always in the same 
universe.

Based by Ayub Khan-Din on his semi-autobiographical play, "East
is East" revolves around a large Anglo-Pakistani family living in the
working-class town of Salford, near Manchester, in a small suburban
house which also contains their fish 'n' chips shop. Set in the 1971,
it draws on several societal themes: the inherent cross-cultural
conflict, the sexual revolution of the '60s and, above all, the
patriarch's determination to cling to traditional Pakistani
values. The celebrated Indian actor Om Puri plays George Khan, the
tyrannical, expatriate father who has forced his six sons and one
daughter to learn Urdu and attend the mosque - earning himself the
nickname "Genghis" - with Linda Bassett as his long-suffering
wife. But the kids are rebellious, preferring soccer, discos, pop
culture, and sexual experimentation. The boys certainly don't want to
marry good Muslim girls - in fact, one of them is gay. And, one by
one, the prospective brides are rejected. The only confusing aspect is
why George Khan, given his prejudices, would have married a Catholic
Englishwoman in the first place - and then why he would so try to
hamper their children's assimilation. A first-feature by Irish
director Damien O'Donnell, it's a hilarious, moving comedy,
sidestepping all the usual cliches about mixed-race, mixed-religious
families, culminating in a surprisingly satisfying conclusion. And, if
you enjoy Om Puri, rent the video of "My Son the Fanatic," in which he
plays a married cab-driver with another set of family problems. On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "East is East" is a subtle,
multi-layered 8. It was a huge hit in Europe, winning many awards
including Best British Film of the Year from the London Film Critics.
