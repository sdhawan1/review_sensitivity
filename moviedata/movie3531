This dull, tedious and relentlessly bland
semi-autobiographical coming of age comedy is characterised by wooden
performances, wooden direction and a leaden script.
Set in the middle class Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood
(affectionately known as "the Wood" by its residents) in the
mid-1980's, the film follows the friendship between three black
youths.  The film opens in the present, with the imminent wedding of
Roland (Taye Diggs).  But with only a couple of hours before the
ceremony, Roland has disappeared, and it falls to his two best friends
Mike (Omar Epps, from Higher Learning, etc) and Slim (Richard T Jones,
from Kiss The Girls, etc) to find him and get him to the church on
time.
This is the cue for some flashback sequences recalling their
first meeting at school and some key events in their enduring
friendship.  We follow the young Mike (played by Fresh's Sean Nelson),
Slim (Duane Finley, making his feature film debut) and Roland (Trent
Cameron, also making his debut) through school, the senior prom, a
comic hold-up, and the embarrassment of their first sexual experience.
In a sequence that seems like a tasteless cross between Porky's and
the recent American Pie, the three make a pact to try and lose their
virginity within a month, with money riding on the outcome.  We also
follow the slowly developing romance between Mike and Alicia (Malinda
Williams) from its awkward beginnings, and learn why the couple
eventually went their separate ways.
 
However, there are few insightful moments or cathartic
experiences to make this semi- autobiographical tale worth telling.
Even though it is a film about the experience of contemporary black
youth, The Wood fails the basic test of all good coming of age films.
Nostalgic films are supposed to evoke memories and a sense of shared
experiences that resonate with audiences of all backgrounds and
persuasions, but The Wood fails to arouse any such emotional response.
The film lacks any warmth, humour, or insight, and we feel little
empathy for these boys in the wood.
First time writer/director Rick Famuyiwa sets up a number of
potentially interesting ideas, but fails to satisfactorily develop
them or follow through.  The Wood has nothing of interest to say, and
takes nearly two hours in which to say it.  In fact, it makes the
recent tedious How Stella Got Her Groove Back seem like a masterpiece
by comparison.  The Wood should come with its own subtitles so that
audiences can understand the peculiar jive talk of the characters!
Famuyiwa even resorts to the horribly clich√©d technique of having
one character directly address the camera during the opening scenes,
but somehow this clumsy device is mysteriously dropped by the
climactic wedding sequence.  For me, the best part of this awful film
came when it unexpectedly broke down during the preview screening.  At
first, the dialogue was out of synch, making the film look like one of
those old badly dubbed Bruce Lee films of the mid-'70's.  Then the
screen mercifully faded to black (so to speak) for a few minutes.
Unfortunately, the problem was rectified and The Wood plodded on for
another interminable 80 minutes.
Even without these technical glitches, The Wood would have to
rank as one of the worst films of the year!

"The Wood" refers to Inglewood, California, where three
friends reminisce about their 13-year friendship on the day when one
is about to get married. The story opens as Omar Epps explains,
directly into the camera, that his pal, the groom, has turned up
missing.  Epps and Richard T. Jones are sent to find Taye Diggs, who
is drunk at the home of an old girl-friend, overcome with pre-nuptial
jitters. As the boyz drive around, trying to sober up Diggs so he can
take his wedding vows, they pass various locales around the 'Wood and
recall memories from their shared adolescence. That's the simple,
somewhat contrived plot and the three actors deliver solid
performances.  First-time writer-director 25 year-old Rick Famuyiwa
evokes a remarkably fresh pop '80s nostalgia, complete with a spinning
vinyl record and finger-snapping music. Until now, most
African-American films have fallen into one of four categories:
"booty" pictures, violent "hood" chronicles, female-oriented
comedy/dramas, or serious ghetto stories, aimed at an older audience.
This movie is different in that it delves into the honest camaraderie,
as well as the various comic aspects of puberty, and its appeal should
extend beyond the boundaries of the African-American community.  On
the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The Wood" is an amusing,
appealing 5.  In a summer of coming-of-age films, comparisons are
inevitable but - while much of the narrative involves a trio of young
guys trying to get laid - "The Wood" has little of the gross, vulgar
humor of "American Pie."  Instead, it opts for good-natured charm,
poignancy and sentimentality.

Less than brilliantly recorded in audio and visuals, this film's spirit and
charm overwhelmingly eclipse technical pops and sputters. Often lower
quality production is coupled with lower quality performance. This is
absolutely not the case with "The Wood."
It's a buddy film. The story begins in the midst of wedding day hysteria.
The best men, eyes to camera, begin the history of their high school days
with the groom (who's cold feet have prevented him from making it to the
church on time). That history is portrayed in intermittent flashbacks, while
Roland (the groom) tries to make a final decision about following through
with his bride-to-be.
A second set of three actors are used to play the buddies as teens. Both
sets are excellent and fluid. The two portraying Slim deserve especially
high praise for their powerfully funny and spontaneous reactions to the rich
characters (and situations) that surround them.
Like "American Pie," this film is not afraid to broach the topic of teenage
sex. Controversial as that may be, condoms were again advocated and it is
rated R after all. Though both pictures can be enjoyed by teens and adults
alike, "American Pie" favors the teens while "The Wood" favors adults.
Aside from a muddy audio track, some sticky edits and a few lighting
problems; the only other negatives were a few commercial plugs that
interrupted the realism of the tale.
With an excellent script, fantastic performances by everyone (hence great
direction) and juicy chemistry between the buddies, "The Wood" proves
entertaining and funny. During my viewing, the theater erupted with
laughter.
Starring Elayn Taylor, Omar Epps, Richard T. Jones, Taye Diggs. Direction
and Screenplay by Rick Famuyima. Produced by Albert Berger, Ron Yerxa, David
Gale at MTV/Paramount/Bona Fide. Rated R.

Reviewed July 17, 1999.
Although it probably wouldn't have made much of a difference, it is still 
unfortunate that "The Wood" had to be released only a week after the 
infinitely funnier and sweeter "American Pie." Both movies concern a group of 
high school buddies who make a bet/pact to lose their virginity. Not only 
that, but each follows the same sort of pattern and some scenes that are 
almost identical (one set in a bedroom, the other involving a parent catching 
their child doing something, er, embarrassing). Not only that, but both 
conclude similarly with one of the guys deciding not to tell everyone that he 
had sex, based on the actual love and respect he has grown for her. Now for 
the differences between the two. While "American Pie" was raunchy and often 
downright hilarious, "The Wood" only has a few select amusing moments, 
doesn't quite capture the realism of being a teenager as well, and feels 
manufactured. To top it all off, the marginally succeessful scenes depicting 
them as teens in 1986-1989, are constantly being intercut with the three 
friends in the present day, which is cause for it to feel severely uneven and 
disoriented, only an excuse to add the marquee value of Omar Epps and Taye 
Diggs to the release. Cut out the meaningless wish-wash of the framing story 
and director Rick Famuyiwa may have had a winner on his hands, but as is, 
every time I began to get into the characters as teenagers, the film would 
jerk me back to 1999. For this reason, call it an african-american, male 
version of 1995's much better, "Now and Then," which at least had the good 
sense to present the flashback in one long 80-minute stretch, with the 
present day stuff only coming into play in the first and last ten minutes. My 
mind floating around from one past movie to the other, I have just discovered 
that "The Wood" doesn't have one original, distinctive element..
"The Wood," our narrator and central character, Mike (Omar Epps), tells us in 
the first scene, "isn't what you think. No, it's short for Inglewood, 
California, where his single mother moved them when he was 14-years-old (Sean 
Nelson). Quickly becoming friends with Slim (Duane Finley) and Roland (Trent 
Cameron), they would spend their days off from school hanging out with each 
other, going to school dances, etc. From the first day he came to town, Mike 
was completely smitten with the beautiful Alicia (Malinda Williams) who, 
after a rocky first meeting when he grabbed her booty due to a bet, becomes 
his good friend through the rest of middle and high school. Back to the 
present day, Mike and Slim (Richard T. Jones) set off to find Roland (Taye 
Diggs), who is about to get married in a couple hours. They find him 
inebriated at the home of his old girlfriend, Tanya (Tamala Jones), and has 
suddenly gotten cold feet about marrying his fiancee, Lisa (Lisaraye). As the 
three further reminisce about the "olden days" together, they find that it is 
important for them to be lifelong friends, and for Roland to take that final 
step towards becoming the husband to the woman he dearly loves. 
Aside from the refreshing idea of showing how your high school romances 
rarely translate into adulthood, and from refraining to turn into a gritty, 
violent urban drama as so many "african-american"-oriented pictures do, "The 
Wood" isn't worth your time, effort, or money, alternately feeling far longer 
than its 106-minutes, but also coming off as empty. Since the present-day 
story, as it is, has been stripped down to the bare-bone essentials, and you 
know from the get-go that it will end with one of the friends finally getting 
married, there is no particular interest that I could dedicate to those 
scenes. The flashbacks, although more effective and with a truthful scene 
here and there (as when Mike loses his virginity to, yep, you guessed it), 
are also painfully thin and, again, nothing much happens.
As the young Mike, Sean Nelson (1994's "Fresh") acts as the respectable 
leader of the cast, and he is given a few nice scenes with Alicia (played 
sweetly by Malinda Williams), as well as one with his mother. Those are 
actually just about the only performances worth noting. Duane Finley and 
Trent Cameron, as the young Slim and Roland, are not on view long enough to 
create much of a personality, and end up feeling like more of an afterthought 
than real characters. The same goes for the adult actors, Omar Epps, Richard 
T. Jones, and Taye Diggs, who are only cashing a paycheck here. Blame for the 
lackluster story and poorly-written characters must go to writer-director 
Rick Famuyiwa who, judging from this film, unfortunately doesn't appear to 
have much of a talent in the filmmaking business. Consequently, the film is 
flatly shot by Steven Bernstein, and no other technical credits make any 
impact whatsoever.
"The Wood" is the type of film that isn't awful or even bad, but you also 
just can't seem to get excited about anything in it. It simply sits there, 
motionless, without any notable attributes to recommend, or that are even 
worth mentioning. It's unfortunate, but it's the truth.

     Another week, another coming of age story.  Turns out timing can be
everything, and THE WOOD's unfortunate release one week after the
somewhat similar (but much better) AMERICAN PIE will leave viewers
drawing unfavorable comparisons between the two.
     The story behind THE WOOD, as in Inglewood, California, follows
three best friends on the day when one is set to be married.  Of course,
he's having the jitters, so they reminisce about their childhood growing
up together and chasing girls, which, basically, is what they all still
want to be doing.
     Told in half-present, half-flashback, THE WOOD alternates between
time periods, launching into those `Hey, remember that time when...'
vignettes, overlaid with music by Luther Vandross and other 1980's soul
legends.
     Unfortunately, the MTV-production side of THE WOOD comes out far
too often, with long, drawn-out comedy scenes that run out of gas after
a couple of minutes and left me yawning or checking my watch.  These
jokes are just too tired, overused, or recycled... and THE WOOD quickly
becomes a game of Spot the Clich√©.  In fact, the whole premise has been
done to death ¬ñ possibly best in DINER (1982).  Maybe it's just too soon
for 1989 nostalgia, but I found myself much more interested in the
present-day than the booty-chasing youths of these guys, and
unfortunately, that's when the bulk of THE WOOD takes place.
     THE WOOD isn't horrible, but it isn't particularly memorable,
either.  Just another summer movie that will likely be lost in the
shuffle.

 "The Wood" is a pleasant, warm comedy about friendship and loyalty.
 It is one of those feel-good movies, a nostalgic trip down memory lane
featuring likable characters, nice music and humorous situations.
 It also is homogenized and non-threatening. Now that is not a criticism as
much as an observation.
 There is no real dramatic tension in "The Wood" because it is a story
involving regular people in ordinary situations.
 It is a movie you just sit back, observe and enjoy.
 The crux of the story centers on Roland (Taye Diggs) on the day he is to
be married. Three hours before the ceremony, the groom turns up missing.
 Sent to find him and bring him to his senses are his oldest friends, Mike
(Omar Epps) and Slim (Richard T. Jones). The pair find Roland drunk at the
home of an old girlfriend.
 As his friends drive him around in order to sober him up, various locales
around the 'Wood - the nickname for their home, Inglewood, Calif. -
rekindle memories and episodes from their adolescence.
 The trio first met during junior high school. Mike, recently arrived from
North Carolina, hooks up with Roland and Slim, who immediately get the new
kid in trouble. They dare him to pinch the behind of Alicia, the prettiest
girl in the school.
 While Mike gets slapped around for his pains. it also is the beginning of
a friendship that as the years progress develops into something deeper and
more personal.
 "The Wood" is a positive movie. No gang-bangers and no drugs - except for
one sequence in which a young man smokes a joint. It presents a slice of
black life that few mainstream Hollywood studios would invest money into
examining.
 The three main actors give strong performances. Diggs, who made his debut
as Angela Bassett's lover in "How Stella Got Her Groove Back" and was
featured earlier this year in the comedy, "Go," is confused and nervous as
the uncertain groom.
 Epps' Mike is the level-headed member of the trio who, despite failures in
his own love life, helps his friend determine his future.
 Jones, who co-starred in last year's failed Steven Bochco TV series,
"Brooklyn South", is the mouthy, hot-headed fellow, who easily becomes
frustrated. At times all he wants to do is slap some sense into his friend.
 The three younger actors who play Roland, Mike and Slim as teen-agers -
Trent Cameron, Sean Nelson and Duane Finley - also exude that cameraderie.
 "The Wood" is an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours.
Finger-snapping music, a warm and humorous series of vignettes and a group
of people you wouldn't mind associating with make "The Wood" a friendly
place to visit.

To begin with, I certainly felt out of place sitting in the audience at The
Wood, a movie that not only is good, but will pleasantly surprise you. Not only
is there not one Caucasian cast member, (not even in a cameo) I was also part
of the minority of the five white people sitting in my auditorium. 
Slim, (Richard T. Jones) Roland, (Taye Diggs) and Mike (Omar Epps) are all
gathered at a wedding that Roland is supposed to be at. He's at an old
girlfriend's house, drunk as ever, having second thoughts about giving up his
old wild lifestyle to settle down with one woman. 
This begins a whole set of flashbacks that are intervened nicely from the 80s
to present day. While it's not quite plausible how the flashbacks begin, it's a
cute way to make a movie, and they pull it to it's fullest extent. Young Mike
(Nelson, who steals the show) has just moved from North Carolina and has his
eyes set on Alicia (Malinda Williams) while his buddies try to rack up
telephone numbers. Despite the fact that Alicia's brother (De'aundre Bonds) is
an abusive gang member. Amazingly, it manages to do this without too many
racial stereotypes.
Another nice thing about The Wood is that you feel like your a part of the
movie. In beginning sequences Mike talks right into the camera and acknowledges
that we are there, watching everything that's happening to the characters.
While this isn't anything original or inventive, it does add a nice touch. It
also has several gags that seem taken right out of a toned down American Pie,
so for that, and the fact that I was taken aback by how good it was. The Wood
earns my *** stars.

based on a story by Rick Famuyima and Todd Boyd
written and directed by Rick Famuyima
Inglewood, California, known to many of its inhabitants as "the wood",
is a small, middle-class urban community populated mostly by
African-Americans. Minutes away from the airport and (former) home of
the Los Angeles Lakers, the Wood represents L.A. like few places
can. Inglewood is also the setting for Rick Famuyima's wonderful debut
film, "The Wood". "The Wood" is the tale of three young men, Mike,
Roland and Slim, who reminisce about growing up in Inglewood, on the
day of Roland's wedding. The narrator is Mike(Omar Epps as an adult,
Sean Nelson as a teenager), a self-described peacemaker who moved to
the Wood when he was in the eighth grade. On his first day of school,
he meets Roland(Taye Diggs as an adult, Trent Cameron as a teenager)
and Slim(NFL wide-receiver Richard T. Jones as an adult, Duane Finley
as a teenager), and they instantly become friends when the naive Mike
accepts a bet in which he has to grab the "booty" of fellow classmate
Alicia(Malinda Williams), whom Mike has a crush on.
Alicia turns out to be quite a strong girl, and as well as punching
him, she gets her older brother, Stacey(De'aundre Bonds), a gang
member, to beat Mike up after school.  However, for the remainder of
the year, she takes a liking to him, and Mike reconciles with her
brother in an unconventional way. The relationship between Mike and
Alicia builds up through high school, as things become more serious.
Meanwhile, back in the present day, Roland is unable to be found and
it is up to Mike and Slim to locate him so that the wedding can
happen. They end up finding him at the house of an old flame(Tamala
Jones), drunk and wasted on the couch. The three once again think back
to when times were different, and they feel hidden sadness for the
friend that they are about to "lose".  However, the real coming-of-age
occurs as the Mike and Slim watch their friend take the first steps
towards a more stable life; steps that even he is having second
thoughts about.
Writer/director Rick Famuyima is telling the true story of his own
adolescence in the Wood, and it is another story of African-Americans
growing up in "the hood", but it doesn't involve racism or gang
warfare. USC-grad Famuyima, unlike other urban black talents such as
Spike Lee and John Singleton, chooses to give his characters a human
portrayal without resorting to violence. Rick Famuyima is a filmmaker
with a positive message.
The flashback scenes are usually more effective than the real-time
scenes, despite the latter's fine cast of actors. Sean Nelson gives an
excellent performance as young Mike, going through an "American
Pie"-like coming-of-age. Taye Diggs and Richard T. Jones also take a
backseat while Omar Epps shows a lighter side, unlike his character in
"The Mod Squad".
"The Wood" is the first MTV Film that I can actually recommend
(although "Election" was downright ambitious), helped in a large part
by its funky soundtrack. The film hasn't amounted to much at the box
office in this crowded summer, but hopefully it will find its niche
beyond its target audience. Rick Famuyima is someone to watch.

"I'll give you a dollar if you grab her booty!"
Starring Omar Epps, Sean Nelson, Taye Diggs, Trent Cameron, Richard T
Jones, Duane Finley. Rated R.
Films featuring adults reminiscing about times and friends they had when
they were kids have the potential to be tremendously effective. When
done right, they can be sad (Stand By Me had me in tears), funny,
nostalgic and just plain terrific. But as is the case with every genre,
there is no foolproof formula for making a good movie. With its constant
ineptitude, The Wood demonstrates that for every winner there's a dud.
We are introduced to the people with whom we are about to spend two
hours when they actually start talking to us. Omar Epps (The Mod Squad)
kicks off the movie by speaking directly into the camera, introducing
himself as "Big Mike". You see, Roland, one of Mike's best friends, is
about to be married -- only he's nowhere to be found. His other friend,
Slim, is terribly nervous (in fact, when he sees Mike speaking he blurts
out "Who the hell you talking to?"). It's not long before the story goes
into flashback, as the three buddies fondly recall their adolescent
years in "The Wood" ("not what you think," says Mike, although what you
may be thinking soon becomes a recurring motif; what is being referred
to is the town of Inglewood, California, a suburb of LA).
The Wood tracks the girl-chasing adventures of the three teenagers. From
a booty-grabbing contest that gets Mike into trouble with a nasty big
brother to an American Pie-ish who-shall-get-nookie-first contest, this
movie seems concerned solely with the boys' relationships with the
fairer gender.
I wish this film had explored more than one aspect of the potentially
interesting lives of these characters. A movie solely about "gettin'
some" can be immensely entertaining when it is said film's sole focus,
like in American Pie. Here, however, we get a movie that is supposedly
the story of the friendships of these three people when they were young.
Thus, it is disheartening to see it refuse to do anything interesting
with that scenario. The extent of The Wood's versatility is the
characters' choice of breath mints.
The first hour of this veritable sap-o-rama entertains, with some funny
gags and affecting moments. But then The Wood falls apart. At nearly two
hours its at least half an hour too long and it begins to repeat itself.
The same jokes turn up more times than we find it fitting to laugh at
them. Before we know it, what we've wound up with is yet another retread
of the Horny Teenager Movie even though its first hour lead us to
believe otherwise.
The characters are exclusively one-dimensional as are, for the most part
the performances from the six leads. The standout, is Omar Epps as adult
Mike, whose performance is sincere. Sean Nelson who plays young Mike has
an annoying fish-out-of-water quality: the story calls for him to make
us believe that his character has just moved from North Carolina to
California and doesn't know anyone or anything there. He goes one
better: he makes us think his character just moved from Venus.
The Wood is a movie with a one-track mind, which is unfortunate because
had it tried to develop other aspects of its characters it may have been
a fascinating character study. As it is, it's a mildly diverting, seldom
entertaining piece of alleged nostalgia that doesn't seem very nostalgic
at all.

Harvey S. Karten
   Based on writer-director Rick Famuyiwa's life in the upper-
middle class California suburb of Inglewood (hence the title),
"The Wood" is a sporadically funny buddy movie about three
men who meet in junior high school, and carry on their
friendship through high school and beyond--ultimately getting
together yet again at the wedding ceremony of one of the
pleasant young men.  Famuyiwa's comedy features an all-
black cast (just two white faces appear briefly in the entire
movie).  Unlike "Waiting to Exhale" and "The Color Purple"
man-hating is conpicuously absent except on a comic level;
unlike "Dead Presidents" and a host of 1970s blaxploitation
films there is no violence to speak of.  And except for a
single use of the term "whiteboy" used without hostility, the
story elicits no racial animosity of even a single mention of
racial conflict. If Rick Famiyiwa's tale is truly autobiographical,
he is interested primarily in evoking the sweet memories of
life with his two good pals over the period of more than a
decade.  Since the African-Americans in the story are for the
most part upper middle-class, the subtext running throughout
is that if you have money, you don't face the devastating
problems associated with growing up in poor neighborhoods.  
   As in Neil Simon's play "Plaza Suite," the movie hones in
on a person who gets high anxiety on a wedding day.  Unlike
Mr. Simon's bride--who hides in the bathroom until she is
coaxed out by her friends and neighbors--the groom, Roland
(Taye Diggs, whom you'll remember for his role as Angela
Bassett's muscular playboy in "How Stella Got Her Groove
Back")--drinks himself into a stupor at the home of a former
girlfriend to reconsider his resolution.  The wedding which is
to take place between Roland and Lisa (Lisaraye) is used as
a framing device.  Most of the movie deals with the hopes
and fears of the trio of male buddies when they were teens,
though Famuyiwa frequently flashes to the present to
punctuate the close bond felt by the three men.
   As the trio reminisce, they are brought back at first to the
meeting between the 14-year-old South Carolina exile Mike
(Sean Nelson) and the two who take the greenhorn in to
show him the ropes: young Slim (Duane Finley) and young
Roland (Trent Cameron).  At first bewildered by the hipness
of California after his childhood in Winston-Salem, Mike is to
grow from an awkward lad who had never danced (much less
kissed a girl) to the winner of two macho bets he makes with
his new pals--which become the source of much of the
comedy.  Hoping to fit in with his new acquaintances, Mike
bets that he will have the guts to pinch the booty (butt) of a
classmate, the gorgeous Alicia (Malinda Williams).  He later
ups the ante when he joins the others in betting who will be
the first boy to lose his virginity (though apparently the fellows
are willing to trust one another on this one).  The story's
funniest scenes occur as Steve Bernstein's camera focuses
on each of the three would-be studs as he races the others in
the separate bedrooms.
   For better or worse, "The Wood" never takes on the
vulgarity of "American Pie," which is based on a similar
wager, or the caustic tone of "Cruel Intentions," which centers
on a bet that one Casanova will successfully deflower a
confirmed virgin.  Instead, "The Wood" is most engaged in
illustrating the value and resilience of friendship, appending
the insight that the bond between males is more secure than
the attachment between the sexes.  While Mike, Slim and
Roland remain the best of buddies throughout, none of the
three is still hanging out with his school-time girl friend,
though Mike may just get a second chance when he runs into
his high-school confidant and lover at the wedding.
   While the ensemble perform their roles flawlessly, the
characters are far more interesting as teens than they are as
more-or-less proper and reasonably responsible adults. 
Omar Epps as the older Mike appears to be the writer's alter
ego, at times even facing the camera as though he were
acting on the stage narrating a few details for the sole benefit
of the audience.  Richard T. Jones as the adult Slim and
Taye Diggs as the adult Roland complement Epps'
performance reliably in this pleasant but ultimately mild take
on the altogether small problems faced by people with
money.

So-called "urban" films almost always tend to be consigned to a box
office ghetto of their own, rarely connecting beyond its target
African-American audiences, even if the film has cross-demographic
appeal.  Even with the promotional muscle of MTV Productions behind it,
_The_Wood_ is not likely to be an exception to the rule, but this warm
and funny, if somewhat uneven, film deserves to be.
The film's title refers to Inglewood, California, and if anyone outside
of the Southern California area knows about the city, it's for either one
of two reasons: (1) it's the home of the Great Western Forum, longtime
arena to the Los Angeles Lakers (at least until this coming fall); or (2)
it's known for its gang activity.  The latter would be the obvious angle
to pursue, but aside from the gang connections of one secondary
character, writer-director Rick Famuyiwa admirably skirts the issue. 
Famuyiwa grew up in Inglewood, and his take on the city is an
affectionate portrait that could be of any given community; it has many
different qualities (including, as it is, gangs) that contribute to its
unique flavor.
Similarly universal, if more than a little formulaic, is its story,
which tracks a group of three friends over a span of 13 years.  The main
character is Mike (played as a teen by Sean Nelson, as an adult by Omar
Epps), who moves to The Wood from North Carolina in 1986.  In junior high
he immediately clicks with Wood natives Roland (played as a teen by Trent
Cameron, as an adult by Taye Diggs) and Slim (played as a teen by Duane
Finley, as an adult by Richard T. Jones), and together they come of age
through high school.  As is with the case of all young men of the teen
age, sex dominates the brain, and in a sense _The_Wood_ can be seen as a
(slightly) less crass cousin to _American_Pie_; there are no outrageous
gross-out gags, but the trio's attempts to initiate themselves are
humorous in how they are so firmly grounded in honest reality.
As can be gleaned from the actor credits, there is also a parallel story
that follows the trio as adults, and, unfortunately, it is not as
interesting as the teenage story.  In 1999, it's Roland's wedding day,
and hours before the ceremony, he's nowhere to be found; Mike and Slim
eventually do locate him, but he's plagued with doubt.  The flashbacks
are meant to punctuate the contemporary action, but the '99 scenes feel
like needless interruptions in the story that runs through '86 and '89. 
This is no fault of the likable and charismatic actors, even if Epps is
called on to address the camera directly for the film's first 15 minutes.
While I found that device to be distracting, it is in line with the
theme of the film, which is this idea of community and belonging, which,
of course, can be broken down to friendship.  Over the course of
_The_Wood_, one really grows to know and like these people as well as get
a keen feeling of their place and time; by the film's final toast, one
feels as if they are indeed part of The Wood.
