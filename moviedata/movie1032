     Let me start by identifying my attitudes on Jane Austen so the
reader knows if to continue or not.  I consider these stories an
excellent view into the minds of a certain class of woman in the early
19th century.  Austen novels are at the high-end of what we have come
to call the romance novel.  Jane Austen heroines, if one may call them
heroines, seem to aspire mostly only to achieve comfort.  This they
accomplish via the institution of marriage.  The choice of whom they
will marry is usually obvious to every reader, if not to the heroine
herself, from the early pages of the novel.  Her heroines are people
with no ambition to be known fifty years after their death or indeed
fifty miles from home during their lives.  Usually the reader has more
interest and certainly better knowledge of the events of their times
than they appear to have themselves.  They are living during the
Napoleaonic Wars, a fascinating period, but to all appearances are
ignorant of the fact.  This does not say that great literature cannot
be written about minor and narrowly absorbed people, but the greatness
of some other authors is more readily apparent.
     Fanny Price in the new MANSFIELD PARK is a little more aware of
the world than most Austen heroines, though not by the intention of
Jane Austen herself.  Patricia Rozema who adapted the navel for the
screen and then directed it has revised and corrected Austen for
current audiences.  To spice up Fanny's personality she now is a
budding writer.  The amusing melodramatic stories that Fanny writes are
stories that really did exist.  They are stories that Jane Austen
herself wrote as a young teen.  Fanny's knowledge of the world, her
social conscience, and most of the anti-slavery subplot is all Rozema's
revision.  There is some but very little mention of slavery in the
Austen novel, though by a coincidence that perhaps Austen herself was
not aware of, Mansfield Park was named after Lord Mansfield who in 1772
ruled that any slave brought to England was legally free.  The film's
implications of open sex and even lesbianism are pulled from Rozema's
fertile imagination.  Still it is hard to be too harsh on a film with
this much historic charm.  It may not be what Austen intended, but it
is still enjoyable.
     Fanny Price (Frances O'Connor) was taken from her poor parents in
Portsmouth at age ten and brought to Mansfield Park to be raised by the
Bertram family who live in a huge mansion called Mansfield Park.  The
masters of Mansfield Park are her aunt and uncle and she is to have a
status somewhere between a family member and a servant.  She will get
to know the Bertram children but everyone will be constantly aware that
she is not their equal.  She is treated at best insensitively by the
family except for young Edmund Bertram who from the very start shows
her compassion.
     As the years pass Fanny is accepted at arm's length by the four
Bertram children Tom, Edmund, Maria, and Julia.  Into their lives come
brother and sister Henry and Mary Crawford (Alessandro Nivola, Embeth
Davidtz), neighbors.  Henry and Mary are close and share a tendency to
flirt, an attraction to the opposite sex, a sense of style, an interest
in the Bertrams, and both are attracted to women.  Fanny who secretly
loves Edmund sees him attracted to Mary Crawford and Maria and Julia
attracted to Henry.  But Henry is more interested in Fanny.  This is
Jane Austen so we know from the start that things will sort themselves
out and that the heroine will get the right man and in doing so get to
live on the big estate. "It could have ended differently, I suppose,
but it didn't," Fanny muses at the end of the film.  But then she does
not know Jane Austen as well as we do.
     Frances O'Connor's Fanny Price is perky and free-spirited, but
just a little too attractive for the Jane Eyre-like heroine.  Sir
Thomas Bertram is played by none other than Harold Pinter.  Alessandro
Nivola does bring enough charm to the role of Henry that the audience
is almost rooting for him.  Michael Coulter's camera captures a usually
bright and sunny view of early 19th century England created by
production designer Christopher Hobbs and art director Andrew Munro.
The historical detail is questionable with details like lipstick and
eye makeup on a ten-year-old child, but it is nice to look at.
     This is perhaps not Jane Austen's MANSFIELD PARK, but Jane Austen
would have probably recognized most of it and would have been amused by
the rest.  I rate it a 6 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +1 on the -4 to +4
scale.

MANSFIELD PARK (M).

Director: Patricia Rozema
Stars: Frances O'Connor, Jonny Lee Miller, Alessandro Nivola, Embeth 
Davidtz, Harold Pinter, Lindsay Duncan, Sheila Gish, James Purefoy, 
Victoria Hamilton, Justine Waddell, Hugh Bonneville, Hannah Taylor Gordon
Running time: 116 minutes.
The third, and most autobiographical, of Jane Austen's novels,
Mansfield Park tells the story of a young girl from an impoverished
family who is raised on the estate of wealthy relatives in the English
countryside.  This is a witty, articulate and beautifully observed
tale that retains the lyrical quality of Austen's prose as well as the
irony with which she observed the social mores and conventions of
British society during the late 18th and early 19th century.
This delightful comedy remains faithful to those themes common
to Austen's novels (Emma, Sense And Sensibility, etc), but gives the
material a decidedly feminist outlook.  It explores the class system
of England and savages the hypocrisy and double standards of the upper
class, who preach morality and virtue at home but practice debauchery
when abroad visiting their holdings in the colonies.  It also suggests
that marriage for wealth and status does not always lead to happiness.
And, while marriage for love is a more noble option, it also brings
with it some emotional baggage.
Sex has always been a part of Austen's novels, but until now
it has merely been hinted at, never seen.  In Mansfield Park, Canadian
director Patricia Rozema (When Night Is Falling, etc) brings it out
into the open, making for a bolder, more lusty interpretation that may
shock the purists.  Rozema has also drawn on Austen's own letters and
journals to flesh out the narrative.  Rozema may have taken numerous
liberties with Austen's novel, but her witty and intelligent script
and its modern sensibilities make Mansfield Park relevant for today's
audiences.
Australian actress Frances O'Connor (Love And Other
Catastrophes, etc) does a superb job as Austen's semi-autobiographical
heroine Fanny Price, who undergoes a rags-to-riches like
transformation.  At a young age Fanny is taken away from the squalor
of her impoverished family in Portsmouth and sent to the country
estate of her rich relatives, the Bertrams.  There she is put to good
use in the household, as well as gaining an education along the way.
Fanny blossoms into a beautiful, articulate, literate young
woman with strong opinions and an independent spirit, although some of
her ideas are met with disapproval by her guardians.  Despite her
forthright nature though, Fanny is also the typically virginal Austen
heroine, who finds herself caught between two suitors.  On one hand
there is the handsome but narcissistic and shallow cad Henry Crawford
(Alessandro Nivola, recently seen in Best Laid Plans, etc), who
showers her with protestations of love and happiness.  On the other
hand there is Edmund Bertram (Jonny Lee Miller, from Trainspotting,
etc), whom she has known since childhood, but who is retiring and
reluctant to admit his feelings for her.  Meanwhile, Henry's sister
Mary (Embeth Davidtz) has designs for Edmund and the Bertram fortune.
Rozema handles the romantic entanglements and machinations
with a dexterity that brings this potentially staid period melodrama
to life.  The characters are beautifully brought to life by the
wonderful cast.  O'Connor is superb and suffuses her character with
plenty of fierce determination and spunk.  Playwright Harold Pinter
brings plenty of bluster to his performance as the patriarchal Sir
Thomas Bertram.
While Mansfield Park may not be for the purists, it is a
vastly enjoyable, lavishly cinematic spectacle.  The production design
is superb, and Michael Coulter's cinematography simply luscious.

REFERENCES:       Matthew 19:5, 1 Peter 3:1-8, Ephesians 5:21-33
If this keeps up, Jane Austen (SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, PRIDE AND
PREJUDICE) may have to apply for posthumous membership to the Screen
Writers Guild.  Yet another novel of hers has made the transition to the
silver screen.  MANSFIELD PARK is a turn of the century (18th century
going on 19th) story about love among the classes as well as an
examination into proper society and family ties.
Ten year old Fanny Price (Hannah Taylor-Gordon, JAKOB THE LIAR), taken
from her mother and father and the poverty in which they dwell, is sent to
live with her aunt and the privileged class at Mansfield Park, under the
stern patriarchal hand of her uncle, Sir Thomas Bertram (Harold Pinter,
MOJO)
Spending her days reminded of her lower status, she also invents and
writes fanciful stories during her private times.   Fanny eventually grows
to become a beautiful, intelligent, and engaging heroine (quite unlike the
original character which Ms. Austen originally penned in her novel.)
Writer/director Patricia Rozema (WHEN NIGHT IS FALLING) is responsible
for the textual changes.  From a purely dramatic perspective, the revision
makes perfect sense and improves the film's audience appeal.  What Ms.
Rozema has done is to infuse the main character with much of Ms. Austen's
own personality by including excerpts from the author's journals, giving
that dialogue to Fanny.
The result is a central character that is immediately appealing.  As the
grown Fanny, Australian actress Frances O'Connor (ALL ABOUT ADAM) does
wonderfully textured work.  At times, Ms. Rozema has Fanny address the
camera directly to communicate many of the novel's more introspective
observations.  This is a difficult device to work seamlessly into a period
film and it is to Ms. O'Connor's credit that it works as well as it does.
The central theme which gives the story its legs in an old one... Whether
it is better to marry for love or for social standing?  Fanny has fallen
in love with her cousin Edmund (Jonny Lee Miller, PLUNKETT & MACLEANE) who
appears fond of her as well.  His attentions are soon divided as the
stylish and socially acceptable Mary Crawford (Embeth Davidtz,
BICENTENNIAL MAN) enters the picture along with her equally acceptable
brother Henry (Alessandro Nivola, INVENTING THE ABBOTTS) who eventually
sets his romantic sights upon Fanny.
While Mary and Henry are evidently less than sincere in their affections,
their presence does provide the movie and the main characters with the
necessary conflict that keeps our interest until the film's appropriately
Austen-like ending.
Other thematic devices include a awkwardly inserted reference to the
source of the wealth of Mansfield Park... the slave trade.  There is also
a hint of both lesbianism and incest but neither is carried very far and
is soon forgotten.
The motivation for marriage remains the primary thematic thrust.  Fanny's
cousin, Maria Bertram (Victoria Hamilton, PERSUASION) is an example of one
making a poor match, marrying a well-to-do fool who is able to make her
comfortable, but never happy.  Fanny's own mother, trapped in her chosen
life of squalor warns Fanny by admitting that her situation is due to the
fact that she "married for love."
  Fanny, given those two terrible examples, and faced with the same
choice is understandably indecisive as to which way to lean.
The spiritual answer, of course, lies in the middle of those two
extremes.  Marriage is not a cold, calculating decision based upon
self-preservation.  Neither is it a senseless decision made in the warm
afterglow of a passionate embrace.
In the purest sense, marriage forms an insoluble union whereby two people
agree to function as one.
"And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall
cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?" Matthew 19:5 [KJV]
Love and logic can be combined.  God's Word contains both.  So does a
marriage based upon His truth.

Susan Granger's review of "MANSFIELD PARK" (Miramax Films)
In this provocative, revisionist adaptation of Jane Austen's
third novel, Canadian writer-director Patricia Rozema gives her 19th
century heroine, Fanny Price, much of Austen's own confidant, creative
personality.  Incorporating material from Austen's early journals and
letters, Rozema recreates Fanny (Frances O'Connor) as a poor relation
who is sent from Portsmouth to the magnificent mansion called
Mansfield Park to live in emotional exile with her pompous uncle,
starchy aunts, and privileged cousins. Her favorite cousin is the
brooding Edmund (Jonny Lee Miller) who is destined to be a humble
clergyman, much to the chagrin of the outspoken, ambitious young woman
(Embeth Davidtz) who wants to marry him. Always made to feel inferior
within the genteel, rigidly conventional British class system, she is
considered more than a servant but less than an equal
companion. Nevertheless, meek Fanny becomes an adept and witty writer
who is courted by a charming, handsome rake (Allesandro Nivola) whom
she does not trust. Australian actress Frances O'Connor does a
splendid job as the plucky heroine and her complex performance is
matched by playwright Harold Pinter, as her autocratic uncle, and
Lindsay Duncan in dual roles - as both Fanny's desperate, impoverished
mother and wealthy, opium-addicted aunt. Admittedly, Patricia Rozema's
script tackles too many social issues, including the dark brutality of
slavery on the Caribbean island of Antigua, an exploitive endeavor
which supports this segment of England's landed gentry. And Rozema's
willfully manipulative, pro-feminist characters seem far ahead of
their time. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, Mansfield Park is a
sensual, cinematic 7.  It's a period drama that should appeal,
primarily, to the art-house crowd.

One of these days I must train myself to read the novels of Jane Austen. So 
many people love them, but as of yet, I've been unable to comprehend them. 
Her sentences are too long for me, and written in complex structures of 
defunct words -- unless I pause to absorb each one individually, they run 
past me like a foreign language. Thank goodness for film adaptations.
The latest is "Mansfield Park", written and directed by Patricia Rozema, and 
based on the book Austen was most proud of, as well as the author's letters 
and early journals. The nature of the additional source material means the 
movie's heroine is more like the real Austen than the character in the book. 
This can't be too harmful, since most writers impose their own desires and 
values on the protagonists of their stories.
The girl's name is Fanny Price (Frances O'Connor), whose mother sent her away 
as a child, to live with her rich aunt Lady Bertram (Lindsay Duncan) in the 
lavish country estate of Mansfield Park. Fanny has grown up knowing her place 
-- when to say "Yes, ma'am" or shuffle off in a corner -- but releases her 
emotions through story writing, and confiding in her cousin Edmund (Jonny Lee 
Miller).
"Mansfield Park" is a generally light and funny film which invites us to 
watch Fanny handle the coldness and pressure of her priggish relatives, and 
not only survive, but somehow prevail. I have no idea how much of this comes 
from the novel, and it's hard for me to analyse the film from that angle. 
This is not a position I enjoy. I feel out of my depth when watching a film 
based on a famous book that I haven't read. It's as if I'm missing some 
necessary piece of general knowledge.
I suppose I must, however, try to respond to some of the charges that have 
been levelled at Rozema's picture, which has become notorious among Austen 
purists (some of whom may even have seen it). One thing people are up in arms 
about is the making of Fanny into a writer. From my ignorant point of view, 
this makes perfect sense: Since Fanny's environment prevents her from 
shouting out her thoughts, and a movie cannot contain a narration telling us 
what's going on in her head, we understand her feelings through what she 
writes.
Another controversy surrounds the way Rozema explicitly reveals that 
Mansfield Park profits from the slave trade, something that was only hinted 
at in the book. Again I would argue that this is unavoidable: In film, if 
something isn't on screen, it isn't anywhere, and besides, Austen wouldn't 
have insinuated something if she'd wanted us to ignore it.
Then there are the claims regarding Rozema's sex scenes -- which are 
ridiculous, because no such moments exist! There is one brief glimpse of a 
breast, very late on in the film, as an incidental character is caught en 
flagrante. But plenty of hack journalists are making out that this is some 
sort of wild bonkfest, with Fanny Price leading the way.
Ah, sigh. There will always be cretins who invent falsities to get their 
names in print. All I can say is that "Mansfield Park" is an enjoyable piece 
of cinema, with charming performances and rich, colourful photography. It 
hasn't dissuaded me from attempting the Austen novels a few more times.

filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member David Bezanson.

http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/e48cad7e2da19297882568580005a7e9?OpenDocument
What is it about Jane Austen?  This box-office stalwart has inspired
five major film adaptations in the '90s (six counting the excellent
BBC/A&E production of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE in 1995).
I think I know what Austen's secret is: Her books are recent, but not
modern. Her central characters have good manners and triumph over bad
marriages or economic straits, instead of succumbing to their own vices
or whining too much about their problems.
MANSFIELD PARK is the last of Austen's major novels to be filmed
recently, and I think it is usually considered Austen's weakest novel,
though not too weak for cynical filmmakers to try to squeeze a bit more
cash out of the writer's legacy.
Writer-director Patricia Rozema's cynicism comes out in other ways in
this film, too. She transforms Austen's diffident, quiet heroine Fanny
Price (Frances O'Connor) into a sassy, '90s, politically-aware attitude
girl who shows up the fatuousness of most of the other characters. Only
Edmund Bertram (Jonny Lee Miller), Fanny's true friend and ultimate love
interest, meets her approval.
Worse, Rozema has embellished the tale with a subplot about the moral
evisceration of Fanny's adopted family, the Bertrams, caused by the
family's ties to slavery (based on a few brief references in the novel
to family business in the West Indies).
The movie features one of the best casts in the Austen movie series:
O'Connor is very good, Miller just as good, and Harold Pinter (he can
act, too) does well in the revised, over-politicized role of Sir Thomas
Bertram. Rozema's direction gives the polite, overwritten novel some
needed sensuality.
Unfortunately, Rozema has also refracted the novel through a modern,
unsubtle, feminist bias. The result is still better than the average
'90s politically-correct sermonette, but definitely not a portal into a
19th-century brain (BEING JANE AUSTEN it isn't).
Austen's book is a study on virtues like "constancy," an un-modern
concept which does not mean the same thing as monogamy, nor does it mean
being "true to oneself," THELMA AND LOUISE style. It means believing in
certain moral values and being true to them even though others' conduct
is not always good or bad. Some of this subtlety comes through in the
film, but most of the characters are either too good (i.e. Fanny) or too
bad (everyone else, especially Sir Thomas) to be realistic studies. The
subplot about slavery is especially jarring, because it introduces
something morally unambiguous into a story which is about tolerating
shades of moral ambiguity.
The best dialogue in the film is in Austen's spirit, such as Fanny's
observation that "Life is but a succession of busy nothings" or Edmund's
wish for a "life of compassion and contemplation" (as a clergyman). But
too much of the dialogue is the kind of blunt raving that would have
made 19th-century families as dysfunctional as today's, except that they
customarily kept it to themselves.
Many of Rozema's revisionist additions ring false, like making Fanny an
aspiring writer (even if there were autobiographical elements in the
original novel, I doubt that Jane Austen was the smartass that Fanny is
portrayed as here) or having a character say things like "this is 1806,
for Heaven's sake."
It was supposed to be 1806, but MANSFIELD PARK the movie has a little
too much 1999 in it --- naďve social criticism, bathos, and vulgarity.
And judging from the popularity of Jane Austen adaptations, a lot of
moviegoers are tired of movies that remind them of the present.
Still, they'll probably take any period drama they can get...

 Writer:   Patricia Rozema, book by Jane Austen
 Cast: Frances O'Connor, Jonny Lee Miller, Alessandro
Nivola, Embeth Davidtz, Harold Pinter
   Jane Austen once wrote, "Happiness in marriage is a
matter of chance."  The English novelist, whose works have
been the subject of many film revivals lately, once accepted a
man's proposal but got cold feet and backed down the
following morning.  Much of her thought and feeling infuse
her works, which at times appear so in-your-face
autobiographical that you wonder whether directors of movie
adaptations are creating biopics.  In the new Miramax film
"Mansfield Park"--culled and compressed to some extent from
her novel of the same name but also utilizing assorted notes
that Austen made over the years--the principal focus is on a
writer.  We need not ponder this character's real identity. Like
Austen herself, Fanny Price (Frances O'Connor) wrote
exuberant fantasies as a teen, some satiric histories, and
ultimately was able to set her more mature ideas on paper. 
While the novel showed Fanny to be restrained and passive,
Patricia Rozema--who directs this delightful, nay even
adorable picture--puts a contemporary spin on the tale of
romance, isolation, adultery, betray and snobbery.  And it
works.  Fanny becomes a virtual feminist icon, an
independent-minded, rebellious woman who knows her own
mind and will not settle for a man she does not love despite
the poverty that threatens to accompany her tenacious spirit.
   "Mansfield Park" displays some of the grandeur of previous
Austen adaptations but when compared to Douglas
McGrath's "Emma," Ang Lee's "Sense and Sensibility" and
even the relatively understated "Persuasion" of Roger Mitchell
comes across as almost a tightly-budgeted period piece.  The
capacious manor of the title and the views of the striking
English countryside across which glide stately carriages are
there, but with so much of the action taking place within the
walls of the estate, "Mansfield Park" could have enjoyed a
place on the commercial stage as well.  Even the obligatory
excesses usually present in dance scenes are curbed in favor
of an emphasis on close-ups of the performers' facial
expressions and body language.  These restrains may take
away from the opulence we've come to expect of, say,
Merchant-Ivory works but they serve to enhance the story's
wit, intelligence, occasionally pungent satire.
   In one scene of the story, Mary Crawford (Embeth
Davidtz), a manipulating, self-seeking member of the wealthy
family headed by Sir Thomas Betram (Harold Pinter),
declares, "After all, this is 1806"--making a point that people
should discuss business up front, without inhibition, even if
the intent is grasping.  The England of 1806 still tolerated
slavery, though the institution was soon to die and to threaten
the fortunes of many a rich estate including Sir Thomas
Bertram's.  While Bertram accumulated his wealth from the
work of his slaves in Antigua, Fanny Price, a member of the
family, continued to live in Portsmouth with her poverty-
stricken mother, who had married for love and was therefore
relegated to a harried life in a bug-infested shack.  As a favor
to her, Sir Thomas Bertram invites the young Fanny Price
(Hannah Taylor Gordon) to move into Mansfield Park, where
she is promptly put in her place by the snobbish Mrs. Norris
(Sheila Gish), who is the sister of both Mrs. Price and Lady
Bertram (Lindsay Duncan).  Though Norris instructs all that
the small girl is not the social equal of the rest of the family,
Fanny is befriended by her cousin Edmund (Jonny Lee
Miller), with whom she reads her secret letters and farcical
little history of England.  Years later, Fanny is pursued by the
charming Henry Crawford (Alessandro Nivola), a man who is
"loved by not loving"), getting a chance to fit into Mansfield
Park as an equal if she'd consent to his proposal of marriage. 
   "Mansfield Park" is filled with perhaps more humor than
pathos, making it an eminently enjoyable viewing experience. 
Some of the amusement comes from the bad match
consciously made by Maria Bertram (Victoria Hamilton) with
the manor's foppish Mr. Rushworth (Hugh Bonneville),
propelling her to enter into an adulterous relationship with the
rakish Crawford.  The enervated Lady Bertram serves as a
regular sight gag, sleeping through much of the story under
the influence of opium and alcohol, her beloved pug resting
perpetually on her lap.  Political points are made as Bertram's
sickly son returns from Antigua, his notebook filled with
wrenching drawings of the slave trade there, while the
principal tension comes from the suppressed romantic
longings between Fanny and Edmund--the latter being the
one decent fellow in this dysfunctional family, who self-
destructively admires the conniving Mary while fearing his
passion for Fanny.
   Frances O'Connor, an Australian actress, gives her
character all the required depth.  Fanny, who is Jane
Austen's raisonneur, is intelligent, sharp-tongued, tenacious,
one who is willing to wait for Edmund to come around with a
marriage proposal.  The most touching moment in the story
comes when Edmund tells her toward the conclusion that he
has loved Fanny all his life.  Harold Pinter, yes the Harold
Pinter, makes one of his rare appearances on the screen as 
an authoritarian paterfamilias whose feelings about slavery
are about to invert, while Embert Davidtz turns out a
performance as a personality who is as intelligent as Fanny
but who uses her faculties in Machiavellian ways that lead to
her implosion.
   "Mansfield Park" gets its title from a chief judge of England
who had handed down a ruling limiting the practice of slavery
in his country.  In the film, director Rozema appropriately
gleans some characters from the novel while discarding
others for economy and dramatic impact, making this a
delightful (if unusually low-keyed for the genre) motion picture
experience.

        "Emma."  "Persuasion."  "Pride and Prejudice."  "Sense and
Sensibility."
        Moviedom's love affair with the work of Jane Austen has never been
more apparent than in the last several years.  And I'm not just talking
major motion pictures here; the Arts & Entertainment cable network has been
broadcasting an equal amount of made-for-British-television Austen fare for
months.
        Now we have "Mansfield Park" to continue the illustrious tradition,
a film inspired by Austen's journals, letters, and a tome of intimidating
length that bears the same name.  While not a strict adaptation of the
novel--the talent behind this new production has chosen to give "Mansfield
Park"'s heroine, Fanny Price, a contemporary air and heightened the
Antiguan slave trade subtext--the film nonetheless showcases Austen's
proficiency in developing characters so rich and vital you'll want to spend
many more hours in their collective company.
        As Fanny Price, Frances O'Connor is remarkable (and she doesn't
even get top billing!).  A young woman with a quick wit and a fine command
of the written and spoken word (some would say she possesses "a man's
intellect"), Fanny is shipped at an early age from her poverty-stricken
dockside home to the dreary elegance of Mansfield Park, an imposing
Georgian estate presided over by her wealthy uncle, the implacable Sir
Thomas Bertram.  Sir Thomas is played by the distinguished English
playwright Harold Pinter, whose screenwriting credits include "The
Go-Between," "Betrayal," and "The French Lieutenant's Woman."
        At Mansfield Park, Fanny is forced to endure a life little better
than a scullery maid, condescendingly treated by one Mrs. Norris (Sheila
Gish).  During her tenure there, Fanny witnesses various cousins, friends,
and neighbors falling in and out of love with each other--and herself--at
the drop of a handkerchief.
        Not only has Canadian writer/director Patricia Rozema ("I've Heard
the Mermaids Singing") retained all of Austen's feel and flair for the
world of 1806, but she has beautifully recreated the language that gives
the author's writings such energy.  The entire cast, especially Embeth
Davidtz (who does get top billing) as the shallow, worldly Mary Crawford,
Alessandro Nivola as her rakish brother Henry, and Jonny Lee Miller as
Fanny's cousin and confidante Edmund Bertram, is marvelous and the range of
emotions they traverse in two short hours is astonishing.
        Like all of Austen's works, "Mansfield Park" is drawn from the
author's own life experiences, a life spent almost entirely within her own
family circle of struggling country parsons, rich fools, eligible fops, and
young ladies itching to come out into society.  By continuing, unbendingly,
to write within that narrow world view she has given us great literature--a
precise and complex view of human nature wrapped in incisive humor, social
and moral consequence, and enduring style.
        With its gorgeous cinematography (often shot through leaded panes
of glass that haven't seen Windex in weeks), lovely muted score, and
sure-footed performances, especially by Frances O'Connor, Patricia Rozema's
"Mansfield Park" sets a new standard for adaptations of Jane Austen's work.

_Mansfield_Park_ (PG-13) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
Writer-director Patricia Rozema has received some heat for taking more
than a few liberties in adapting Jane Austen's third novel, which is
about a poor young woman named Fanny Price (Frances O'Connor as an adult)
who is shipped off to live with her wealthy aunt (Lindsay Duncan) and
uncle (Harold Pinter) in Mansfield Park.  There, she falls for her cousin
Edmund Bertram (Jonny Lee Miller), and the feeling is mutual.  In true
Austen style, however, happiness is not easily in the cards, especially
not after the arrival of Henry and Mary Crawford (Alessandro Nivola and
Embeth Davidtz), a wealthy brother-sister pair of Londoners who set their
sights on Fanny and Edmund, respectively.
The one revision with which Austen purists have taken issue is the
reimagining of the character of Fanny.  In the original novel, she is a
passive character; here, Rozema has used the actual journals of Austen
herself to give Fanny a sharp-tongued voice.  This incarnation of Fanny
may not have been what Austen had in mind, but she surely would have
approved, for the injection of attitude and smarts makes _Mansfield_Park_
a much more wicked and irresistible social satire, with Fanny frequently
needling the pomposity of her rich relations.  The cast is splendid--in
particular O'Connor, Davidtz, and Nivola--as is the entire, entertaining
film.

Mansfield Park isn't a great movie.  Heck, it may not even be a good
movie.  It's the kind of period romance picture where you can tell who
each character will end up with romantically after about ten minutes.
The premise  a young girl uprooted from her impoverished family to live
with wealthy relatives - sounds like a bad Cinderella knock-off.  Yet
somehow, despite this, Park is damn entertaining.
How could something so predictable be so enjoyable?  For starters, the
film is based on a novel written by Jane Austen, the most consistent and
prolific writer of romantic comedies in the late 1990s.  Which is pretty
sad since she's been dead for almost 200 years.  Think about it  she
published four books when she was alive and their big screen adaptations
this decade have resulted in an Oscar and Writers Guild Award (Sense and
Sensibility), a Writers Guild nomination (Emma), a National Society of
Film Critics Award (Clueless, which was based on Emma) and an Emmy
nomination (Pride and Prejudice).  And not only is the film based on
Austen's 1814 novel, but also on her personal letters and journals,
which renders the film a bit more autobiographical than the book.
In the film, a ten-year-old girl named Fanny Price (Hannah
Taylor-Gordon, Jakob the Liar) is sent to Mansfield Park, her Aunt
Bertram's wealthy estate in Northamptonshire.  Fanny thinks the move
from her family's hovel in Portsmouth is temporary, but she quickly
learns otherwise.  Although she is treated like an unwanted stepchild
(especially by her snooty cousins Julia and Maria), Fanny is a gracious
guest during her stay at Mansfield.  She passes the time writing her
younger sister with creatively outlandish stories of her new
surroundings and new family.  She reads the letters presumably Austen's
letters - directly into the camera.  Fanny also finds comfort in her
cousin Edmund (Jonny Lee Miller, Plunkett & Macleane), who is sharp
enough to overlook the differences in their social status.
Years later, an older Fanny (Frances O'Connor, Kiss or Kill) has
accepted her place in the Bertram caste system.  She's content to be in
the presence of her kin and guests, but is relegated to the background
of most societal functions.  But Mansfield Park is thrown into upheaval
when a brother/sister team hit the local scene.  Londoner Mary Crawford
(Embeth Davidtz, The Gingerbread Man) is a gossipy meddler that
recognizes Fanny as a bright young woman, declaring that she has a
`tongue sharper than a guillotine.'  Brother Henry Crawford (Alessandro
Nivola, Face/Off) is instantly smitten with Fanny, who must choose
between a superficial marriage that will secure both her social status
and the family's name, and an unlikely romance with the uninterested
Edmund, who wants to be a clergyman.
Directed and adapted by Patricia Rozema (When Night is Falling), Park
looks great and is lensed by Michael Coulter (Sense and Sensibility).
The art and production teams are led by Velvet Goldmine vets Andrew
Munro and Christopher Hobbs.  Of other note is the performance of
Lindsay Duncan (An Ideal Husband), who plays both Fanny's mother and
Lady Bertram.  Rozema's careful direction almost explains away the
predictability of the film by having Fanny deliver a nifty monologue
(directly into the camera again), saying `It could have turned out
differently  but it didn't.'  I guess we'll have to wait for the
Mansfield South Park spoof.  Or the big screen version of Austen's
posthumously published Northanger Abbey, which is set to star Rachel
Leigh Cook.
1:50  Not rated but includes nudity, sexual content and adult
situations

"Of course I love her, but there are as many forms of love as there are
moments in time," Fanny Price's constant childhood companion, Edmund
Bertram (Jonny Lee Miller), says of his love for her now that they're
grown.  In a tale of love expressed and love repressed, the
protagonists' emotions are exquisitely nuanced.  In 1806 England, where
the story is set, the citizens were strictly bound by a rigid set of
moral rubrics.  They dared not live outside these rules of society, lest
something unthinkable happen to them, like being shunned by others.
The screen adaptation of Jane Austen's MANSFIELD PARK surpasses even the
highly successful EMMA and SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, thanks to the talented
writing and direction of Patricia Rozema (I'VE HEARD THE MERMAIDS
SINGING).  (For the record, my favorite movie based on an Austen novel
is still 1995's PERSUASION.)
The beauty of this lavish and gorgeous production isn't in the costumes
or the buildings, it is in the acting and the script.  Unspoken words
express powerful although repressed emotions, and spoken words, thanks
to the original Austen novel and to Rozema's screenplay, are stronger
still.  ("There is no shame in wealth my dear," Fanny's impoverished
mother reminds her.  "Remember I married for love.")
Like most Austen novels, the basic plot is that of a soap opera.  This
is not meant as a put-down, but as a fact.  Austen took what should be
mundane and raised it up several orders of magnitude with the depth of
her writing.  Still, the basic structure is one of the convoluted love
affair in which everyone seems to love someone else.  Love, however, was
anything but simple back in the early 1800s, as social status, money and
appearances complicated enormously the affairs of the heart.  ("His sole
interest is in being loved, not in loving," Fanny says perceptively of
one of her would-be suitors.)
The free-spirited Fanny Price is played with an endearing charm by
Australian actress Frances O'Connor.  (Hannah Taylor-Gordon briefly does
a wonderfully sweet turn as the young Fanny.)  Fanny, who grew up living
a life of squalor, goes, when about 13, to live with her Aunt and Uncle,
Lady Bertram (Lindsay Duncan) and Sir Thomas Bertram (Harold Pinter), in
their lavish estate called Mansfield Park.  It is there that she falls
forever in love with her cousin and constant companion, Edmund Bertram.
Fanny is a voracious reader and a wild writer, who sets out to compose
nothing less than a history of England.  Like everything, she finishes
what she starts out to do.  Fanny is a proud woman who seizes all of the
control that her dire circumstances will allow.  Although she lives in a
mansion, she is usually relegated to second class status.  She isn't
even permitted to have a fire in her cold and damp attic bedroom.
Rozema, who did extensive research on Austen, takes liberties with the
novel, but Rozema claims, only in the spirit of Austen as she expressed
herself in her letters.  Rozema turns Fanny into a stand-in for Austen
herself.  Some may think that the brief sex scene and the brief
female-to-female flirtation some may think will cause Austen to turn
over in her grave, but the scenes are mild and short and fit perfectly
within the context of the storyline.
Rozema's staging possesses real magic.  Fanny's narration is
accomplished by having her write letters to her sister Susan (Sophia
Myles), which Fanny speaks to the camera.  In another inspired approach,
the movie has the nineteenth century equivalent of a musical telegram,
complete with fireworks and flying doves.
The rich supporting cast also includes Alessandro Nivola and Embeth
Davidtz, as brother and sister Henry and Mary Crawford, who figure
prominently in the story's love polygon.
"It could have ended differently, I suppose, but it didn't," Fanny
reflects at the conclusion.  And the most remarkable thing about this
engrossing character study is that, if had ended differently, it
probably would have worked just as well.  The journey itself is truly
the reward.
MANSFIELD PARK runs 1:50.  It is not rated but might be R for one brief
scene of sex and nudity and would be fine for kids around 12 and up.
The film opens nationwide in the United States on Wednesday, November
24.  In the San Jose area it will be playing at one of the Camera
Cinemas.

Starring Frances O'Conner, Jonny Lee Miller, Embeth Davidtz, Alessandro
Nivola, Harold Pinter, Lindsay Duncan. Rated PG-13.
Jane Austen has her own subgenre, with 16 movies adapted from her
novels since 1940. Aside from Clueless, however, there hasn't been much
creative variety in the films; they've been more or less similar in
setting and style. Like John Grisham films, Jane Austen, genius as her
work is, gets old after a while. We've been needing a director to do
something new with one of her novels, to go where no one has gone
before. That wish will not be granted by Patricia Rozema's Mansfield
Park, a reasonably entertaining, altogether unoriginal film version of
one of Austen's least populist works.
The much analyzed protagonist of the story is Fanny Price who was given
away by her well-intentioned but poverty-stricken mother to live in
Mansfield Park, her pretentious aunt's wealthy household. She is
shunned and treated like a servant by everyone except Edmund, one of
her cousins. Over the years, Edmund and Fanny develop a close, but
platonic relationship; he is her first defender, she is his first
confidant and vice versa.
Matters are complicated by the arrival of Henry, a good-looking
aristocrat who takes an immediate interest in Fanny. He courts her and
proposes marriage, but Fanny doesn't trust him and, though interested,
is very hesitant to commit to him, even pulling a 19th century version
of The Runaway Bride on the poor chap. Sir Thomas, the head of Fanny's
household, insists that she mary the desirable Henry, threatening to
kick her out of Mansfield Park should she refuse.
Frances O'Conner, in a lovely performance and a difficult role, plays
Fanny, a complex and demanding character which O'Conner pulls off
deftly. Jonny Lee Miller, last seen in the pathetic Plunkett and
Macleane is tender and effective as Edmund while the little seen Harry
Pinter is terrifically menacing as the head of the manor. Lindsay
Duncan has a fairly thankless part as the conniving, despicable Lady
Bertram but she succeeds with repulsive perfection. The only weak link
in the cast (and of course, a chain is only as strong as its weakest
link) is Alessandro Nivola whose Henry is dull and standard,
undermining the dilemma at the heart of the movie: from Nivola's
portrayal it isn't difficult to see why Fanny never went ga-ga over the
guy.
Rozema's film is funny, melodramatic, and enjoyable. The pace is
reasonably fast, the direction is able and the mood is nothing short of
crowd-pleasing. At the end, the good guys prosper and the bad guys get
their comeuppance. Everything is dandy. Everything is also tiresomely
ordinary. There is not a speck of originality in this film; the setting
and the script have been done and redone countless times, even if the
story itself has been left untouched (sans a 1983 tv mini-series).
Things that we see for the first time in the movie already feel
repetitive because we've seen them so many times in movies past. This
is your basic British melodrama ŕ la Jane Eyre and Sense and
Sensibility, with virtually no variations on the formula.
Jane Austen deserves a revival. She is a wonderful novelist who needs a
filmmaker to breathe fresh life into her work. Mansfield Park is a
perfectly good adaptation, but it's trite. She is suffering from John
Grisham syndrome.
