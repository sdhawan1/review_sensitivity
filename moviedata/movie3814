Williamson
I'm going to start right out by saying that Species II is not as good as the
first movie. The story is good, the acting is good, and the special effects
are better than the first Species, but Species II seems to lack something.
Oh I know, it must be the fact that Natasha Henstridge isn't naked in every
second scene she is in. While that may seem like a really sexist comment,
(which it probably is) nobody will deny that that little fact was part of
the ingredients that made the first film so successful. So when the lovely
Natasha declined to do as much nudity in the second movie as she did in the
first, (don't worry guys, she still takes her clothes off in one scene) the
producers must have thought that the lack of skin would hurt the movie. So
we now have no fewer than three additional women with nude scenes in Species
II. Now don't get me wrong boys and girls, I love to see beautiful naked
women running around on the screen, but this was just too obvious. They
might have well just put a disclaimer at the first of the film -- Since
Natasha only gets naked once, we have included a whole bunch of other naked
women to make up for Natasha's excessive clothing.
Species II has a simple enough premise. A manned mission to Mars comes into
contact with some alien DNA that decides to hitch a ride with the astronauts
back to Earth. It infects the mission commander, Patrick Ross, (Justin
Lazard) who, much like the alien Sil from Species, finds himself compelled
to mate with as many women as he can to start a race of aliens. When dead
bodies start turning up, the army goes to Press Lenox, (Michael Madsen) one
of the only surviving members of the team that destroyed the alien in the
first Species.
Meanwhile, back at a government lab. Dr. Laura Baker, (Marg Helgenberger)
the other survivor of Species, has gone to work for the government and
cloned a copy of Sil, the alien from the first movie. This new clone is
named Eve and is again played by Natasha Henstridge. Eve has been raised a
little differently from Sil. Having learned from past mistakes, the
scientists have made some genetic changes which make Eve more docile than
her predecessor and try to restrain her naturally overactive libido
Anyway, in the hunt for this new alien, Eve is asked to help. It doesn't
take a real stretch to figure out that an over sexed female alien and an
over sexed male alien have only one thing on their minds. So when the two
finally get together, watch out. Seem like a simple plot line? Well kids, it
is. The producers of Species II didn't put a whole heck of a lot of thought
into this one. Hey it's a nice touch that Natasha Henstridge gets to play a
good alien in this film, just the opposite of her character in the first
film. It's just too bad that little plot device was already used in
terminator 2, and with much better results. My guess is that when this film
was being written, the writers thought that Natasha Henstridge would again
be topless for most of the movie, and no one would care about little
technicalities like a plot since they would be to busy drooling over her
chest.
Considering the writing, Species II isn't all bad. The acting is pretty
good. I mean we aren't talking Oscar nominations here, but its average for a
sci-fi action thriller. Natasha Henstridge continues to improve with each
movie that she is in. Michael Madsen and Marg Helgenberger do their normally
good jobs. Nice additions to the cast include Mykelti Williamson as one of
the astronauts from the infected Mars mission, as an added bit of comic
relief. James Cromwell as a senator and father of the infected astronaut,
and George Dzundza (whom some may recognize best from his work on the first
season of Law & Order) as the army colonel in charge of cleaning up this
latest batch of aliens.
Not a bad film, just not nearly as good as it could have been. Definitely
not for the squeamish, or those who don't approve of nude scenes thrown in
for any reason other than that the producers like looking at naked women.
Hey, it's a fun movie as long as you don't go expecting too much.

Release Date: April 10, 1998
Starring: Justin Lazard, Natasha Henstridge, Marg Helgenberger, Michael
Madsen, Mykelti Williamson, James Cromwell
Directed by: Peter Medak
Distributed by: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
MPAA Rating: R (strong sexuality, sci-fi violence/gore, language)

Hollywood is increasingly feeling the need to produce big-budget films
that contain gratuitous sex and violence. The second such film in less
than a month (after WILD THINGS), SPECIES II has given movie goers
another reason to fear studio-produced films. In movies such as this,
there is no such thing as depth, no one has an alterior motive,
duplicity is unlikely, and dynamism is impossible. Every single element
is laid out for the viewer to see, and anything approaching complexity
is hammered home; everyone in the audience is forced to watch the movie
on the level of the lowest common denominator. 
This might be expected from Director Peter Medak, who is a veteran
director from the hit television series HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREETS.
Confined to a span of forty-two minutes, it's no wonder a film that runs
ninety-five minutes in length is hard for him to design. There's not
much to expect from the screenwriting department, either, because the
only other major feature that Chris Brancato has penned was 1997's
Laurence Fishburne starrer, HOODLUM. So the only thing left to turn to
is, in this order: sex, special effects, and violence. 
Justin Lazard plays Patrick Ross, an astronaut who is the first man to
walk on Mars. After some melodramatic screentime, he becomes infected
with alien DNA that renders him in a precarious condition: any woman he
has sex with will grotesquely perish moments after intercourse. This
becomes a problem for the increasingly sexually active Ross, who
receives no help from his father (James Cromwell). Only Dr. Laura Baker
(Marg Helgenberger) and a team of scientists, who've recreated a
friendly version Sil (the female alien from the original SPECIES) - now
named Eve - know how to stop him. So they call in Press Lenox (Michael
Madsen, who reprises the role) to hunt down Ross. Unfortunately, there's
a telekinetic bond between Eve and Ross, and their peaking levels of
estrogen and testosterone, respectively, give them a strong desire to
mate. 
The movie might actually have a chance of thrilling the audience if
there wasn't so much gratuitous sex. The theme of the movie distracts
the audience's attention from what's going on: rather thangetting scared
by any of the several tense scenes, the focus is on how long it will be
until somebody takes their clothes off. Thus there is no reason to
comment on the acting, for nobody save Mykelti Williamson has any degree
of emotion. Cromwell's decreased screen time means he can't lend the
gravity here that he did in L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, and as the movie
progresses towards the end, everything loses any degree of seriousness.
This is another movie that's saved only by special effects and the
merest murmurings of a plot; definitely missable by anyone's standards.
FINAL AWARD FOR "SPECIES II": 1.5 stars - a below average movie.

I find it a marvel that Species II was even made.  Species was,
perhaps, the most disappointing film of 1995:  it was (and still is)
nothing more than a long, violent, and unoriginal excuse to show off
Natasha Henstridge's anatomy in various flattering positions.  And, as
far as I could tell, most people agreed with my position on that film. 
It did make about $60 million in domestic markets, so I suppose it
wasn't a total flop.  However, it doesn't seem like the kind of picture
that warrants a sequel.  Most sequels are shoddy remakes of critically
acclaimed box-office successes.  Species II, however, is a sequel to a
critically lambasted film of marginal box office success.  
And, almost miraculously, it is a better film than the original.  It's
goofy in a lot of the same ways, but the story is more interesting (and
stays interesting through the end, unlike the original film), the acting
is better, and the film is more exciting.  It's not a great film--it
does suffer from numerous cliches of the genre, and lacks in other
areas; but it's an exciting and watchable film.  In other words, it's a
big surprise.  Actually, my expectations of Species II were so low that,
in retrospect, I suppose a pleasant surprise like this was inevitable.  
The film begins with all-American astronaut Patrick Ross (Justin
Lazard) landing on Mars to pick up soil samples.  It turns out that the
vile alien DNA that created the alien in the first film, Sil, is in this
soil.  Naturally, Patrick gets infected with the DNA.  The hook of the
Species series is that the aliens are really big on procreation:  they
constantly crave violent and athletic sex.  And the sex always ends in
the bloody birth of a new alien child.  In Species II, these birth
scenes are even more gory:  the women Patrick takes to bed inflate like
balloons, and subsequently their stomachs explode so the small
human-looking aliens can emerge.  Of course, it's almost a direct
rip-off from the Alien birth sequences, but it didn't bother me too
much.
The government, it turns out, is growing another alien to study.  This
one is named Eve, and is played by Henstridge.  When Patrick returns
from Mars, he and Eve develop a bond so strong that all they think about
is sex.  And, for everyone going to see this film for a shot of
Henstridge in the buff, you won't be disappointed.  (It makes me wonder
if this entire film was created just as an excuse to show us her
breasts.)
I liked the special effects.  It's interesting to see good old models
instead of digital stuff, but I imagine this will be one of the last
films to use them.  And the obligatory big-alien battle in the
conclusion is surprisingly well-done.  Lately, we've had a few really
irritating conclusions that feature big, poorly-animated aliens; Lost in
Space and Mortal Kombat:  Annihilation come to mind.  Species also has a
scene like this, but this sequel beats out all the contestants.  The
alien looks great, and the battle is well-choreographed.   
The acting here is also fun to watch.  Michael Madsen and Marg
Helgenberger reprise their roles from the first film, and they both do a
good job.  Henstridge is entertaining (though I don't really think she
can act).  I especially liked Lazard as the bad alien, but I wondered
what James Cromwell was doing in the small, useless role of Patrick's
father.  The characters, overall, suffer from the same element that most
sci-fi and action characters suffer:  they aren't very interesting.  
The film, overall, is pretty formulaic.  It doesn't do anything out of
the ordinary, and many of the death scenes are needlessly graphic (and
sometimes unintentionally funny).  And it ends with that awful "It still
isn't over!" cliche.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed the film.  Species II is
exciting, and it has a flash of intelligence and interest that most
entries into this genre lack entirely.  And the very fact that it
exceeds its predecessor is a feat in itself.

A movie could not suffer more, than if it loses all self-restraint in
its direction. As in the case of the overly indulgent, blood and guts'
SPECIES 2, all traces of sanity is lost somewhere in the morbid plot. It
seems that whoever wrote the script, became fixated with the idea that
aliens bursting from the bellies of pregnant women, was a hot topic that
would capture the public's interest. Almost every fifteen minutes, there
is a scene filled with lurid sex and copulation, soon followed by
gestation and ruptured wombs. If ever there were a movie that degrades
the value of motherhood, it would be this movie. Having said that, I
also felt violated after being pounded with sickening images.
The stars of this movie have been hired for no other purpose than body
material, to be manipulated for alien purposes. Michael Madsen is hired
because of his pretty face and no doubt for his body, which is entirely
wasted on sex scenes. Just as Natasha Henstridge was wasted in the first
movie for luring men to their deaths. As for the heroes', they're
basically goofy and unintelligent, and overweight ie George Dzundza.
As for killing the alien being, it comes as silly as stabbing somebody's
leg with sickle cell anaemia and throwing it at the alien and say die. I
actually enjoyed SPECIES, but with SPECIES 2, the makers have
unfortunately lost control of boundaries and ventured into a place where
nobody wants to go. Excessive sex, excessive violence and excessive in
every way and in need of a good mental and psychological re-workup if
ever there were to be a SPECIES 3.

        Sex equals death. That's the cardinal rule of slasher movies,
and it's in full effect in ``Species II,'' a worthless follow-up to
the 1995 hit, which was notable primarily for the presence of the
decidedly uninhibited Natasha Henstridge as an alien preying on the
men of Earth.
Like the similarly ill-advised ``Grease 2,'' ``Species II''
uses the old sex-role reversal ploy to get its plot going. This time,
the monster is male, an airheaded astronaut named Patrick Ross (Justin
Lazard) who ends up infected with extraterrestrial DNA after strolling
around on Mars. When Patrick whines about not feeling well, his
politico father (James Cromwell, slumming) grouches, ``You think a
trip to Mars was rough - try a Senate campaign!''
So what's Patrick to do but pick up scores of easy ladies and
attempt to impregnate them with his otherworldly essence? Though
considered a real looker by most of the females in his circle, Pat
turns out to be considerably less attractive when he sprouts long,
slimy gray tentacles during love-making.
Meanwhile back at the lab, crusading Dr. Laura Baker (Marg
Helgenberger) has managed to create a docile knockout she calls Eve
(Henstridge) from the genes of Sil, the troublemaker from the first
film. Why Baker bothered to do this is never made clear, but
eventually Eve picks up on Patrick's scent, goes into heat and escapes
to find him. Wedding bells do not follow.  Henstridge fans will be
disappointed to learn her part in ``Species II'' is minimal and
requires her to remain fully dressed almost all of the time.
Since most of the film's running time is taken up with scenes
of exploding stomachs and splattering heads, we never find out how
Patrick manages to dress and feed his scores of humanoid offspring,
why a smart actor like Mykelti Williamson took the demeaning role of
Patrick's sex-crazed buddy, or why, despite his enormous celebrity,
only one woman in the entire vicinity of the Washington, D.C., area
seems to recognize Patrick.
It's disappointing to see a skilled director like Peter Medak
- who made ``The Krays'' and ``Let Him Have It,'' two of the best
British films of the decade - wasting his time on this kind of tripe,
although it should be noted he does give it some semblance of
professionalism. The digital soundtrack is also highly effective, with
each squish and crunch coming through loud and clear.
But what can be said about a movie that focuses largely on the
struggle of government agents to keep ex-astronauts from having sex?
Leave it to Dr.  Baker: ``It's awful,'' she moans, prior to the
slime-drenched finale.  ``Just awful!''

U.S. Distributor: MGM
     The first SPECIES was a moderately-successful science fiction yarn 
that diverted audiences with some nifty special effects, a few well-
paced action sequences, and frequent views of model-turned-actress 
Natasha Henstridge sans clothing.  However, it was definitely not a 
movie that cried out for a sequel.  And, considering the quality of 
SPECIES 2, it's obvious that MGM should have stopped while they were 
ahead.  The only thing that distinguishes SPECIES 2 is how awful it is.
     If you throw away the plot, which is characterized by a blatant 
disregard for intelligence, logic, coherence, and consistency, SPECIES 2 
actually has a few things to recommend it to a select audience.  Of 
course, that audience is primarily comprised of teenage boys (who, at 
least in theory, shouldn't be able to get into an "R"-rated film) and 
connoisseurs of bad movies.  There's enough blood, gore, simulated sex, 
and bare flesh in SPECIES 2 to prevent it from ever becoming boring.  
This is a grade Z exploitation flick that's ripe for the MYSTERY SCIENCE 
THEATER 3000 treatment.
     Somewhere, someplace, I recall hearing SPECIES 2 described as 
"erotic."  I would love to know who used with that adjective for this 
movie, because he (or she) has a peculiar notion of eroticism.  Sure, 
there's a lot of sex and nudity, but it's almost always accompanied by 
the ripping open of a woman's abdomen as an alien baby claws its way 
free, splattering blood and gore in all directions.  Anyone turned on by 
that is not someone I would care to be sitting next to in a theater.
     I suppose the main attraction in SPECIES 2 is Natasha Henstridge 
(and, to get the obvious question out of the way -- yes, she does remove 
her top, but only once, and only briefly).  Although the character she 
played in the original SPECIES is dead, government scientists still have 
the DNA, and, out of what can only be described as a suicidal impulse, 
they decide to create another clone.  This creature, dubbed "Eve" by its 
creator, Dr. Laura Baker (played by Marg Helgenberger, reprising her 
role), is genetically engineered to be kinder and more docile.  
     Meanwhile, man has finally set foot on Mars.  A team of three, led 
by Patrick Ross (Justin Lazard), has traveled to the Red Planet, but 
when they return to Earth, they bring something with them.  Ross has 
become a half-human/half-alien hybrid, and he's soon mating like crazy, 
collecting the blood-soaked children that are the result of each sex 
session.  His intention is obviously world domination.  Standing in his 
way is that indomitable soldier of fortune from the first film, Preston 
Lennox (Michael Madsen), and one of Patrick's fellow astronauts, Dennis 
Gamble (Mykelti Williamson).  But when Patrick learns about Eve, a 
female of his kind, there's no damping his ardor.
     I'm not sure what the budget for SPECIES 2 was, but a significant 
portion of it must have gone into paying handsome salaries to several 
recognizable actors (as opposed to being diverted into the special 
effects).  Michael Madsen and Marg Helgenberger, both back for a second 
round, are clearly on hand to do as little as they can, grab the money, 
and run.  Ditto for James Cromwell, who plays Patrick's father -- 
"underused" is too kind a word to describe his involvement ("invisible" 
would be more like it).  George Dzundza gets to do a little scenery-
chewing as an angry-but-inept general.  Meanwhile, Justin Lazard's 
performance as Patrick is so flat that he makes Natasha Henstridge's 
limited abilities look good by comparison.  The only one in the whole 
production with any energy is Mykelti Williamson, who is cast in the 
part of the wisecracking black sidekick.
     Complete with cheesy special effects, bare breasts around every 
narrative corner, and dialogue capable of producing howls of laughter, 
SPECIES 2 has been dumped into the marketplace without advance 
screenings for critics.  Director Peter Medak, a journeyman film maker 
with a significant list of mediocre movies on his resume, has added 
another forgettable title, but at least he appears to have had fun doing 
it, which is more than can be said of anyone trying to take this film 
with even a scintilla of seriousness.  Do I recommend the movie?  
Absolutely not, but I will admit that SPECIES 2 is dopey enough that it 
didn't try my patience to the degree that some pseudo-intellectual bad 
movies do.  Here's hoping there's no SPECIES 3.  
Now with more than 1400 reviews...

Ingredients: Blood, gore, breasts, astronaut infected with alien DNA 
Starring: Natasha Henstridge, Justin Lazard, Michael Madsen, Marg
Helgenberger, Mykelti Williamson, James Cromwell
Synopsis:
Since SPECIES II is a sequel, let's recap SPECIES before discussing
SPECIES II. In the original SPECIES film scientists receive a radio
signal from space with instructions for how alien DNA can be combined
with human DNA. They do the experiment, and presto! Out pops Sil (the
beautiful Natasha Henstridge), a sexy half alien half human woman who
goes on a mating rampage which morphs her into an invincible slimy,
terrifying alien. A government assassin named Press Lennox (Michael
Madsen) and a biologist named Dr. Laura Baker (Marg Helgenberger) work
to track down and destroy the out-of-control human/alien Sil. But mostly
we get to see Sil strut and have sex with guys who don't know what
they've got coming to them.
In SPECIES II, astronaut Patrick Ross, and two pals go on a manned
mission to Mars to take some back Martian soil samples, but unknowingly
they get infected with Species DNA from a soil sample. The only
astronaut unaffected is Dennis Gamble (Mykelti Williamson), who is a
sickle cell anemia carrier. When the team returns to earth, astronaut
hero Patrick goes on a mating rampage which morphs him into an
invincible slimy, terrifying alien.
Patrick picks up a lot of hookers and kidnaps a woman from the grocery
store, and mates with them (killing them in the process) to produce
offspring who spin cocoons and hang on the ceiling.
Meanwhile, Natasha Henstridge, who played the original Sil in SPECIES,
now plays Eve, a friendlier, more docile human/alien whom scientists
have cloned from the DNA of the original Sil.  Dr. Laura Baker (Marg
Helgenberger from SPECIES) is heading the high security science lab that
studies Eve. 
When Patrick the alien goes on the mating rampage, Dr. Baker and
freelance security man Press Lennox (Michael Madsen) - - both from the
first SPECIES film - - are reunited to track down the slimy creature.
They hope to use Eve to help them find the alien, but the mating urge is
so strong that Eve escapes from the lab. 
Opinion:
There's not much you can really do with a movie whose main premise is:
"Oh no! We must stop him from mating."  Except make sure it's not too
serious, and have at it. 
Natasha Henstridge as Eve is gorgeous, and the cameraman takes advantage
of that, but her lines are limited; Henstridge has to do her best
putting character into a role that serves no function but to put sex on
screen. Similarly, Mykelti Williamson as astronaut Dennis Gamble has to
adlib and squeeze comedy out of his cardboard character. Kudos to those
two.
The other cast members don't bother to try very hard, and in fact
deliver forgettable lines with wooden performances. For example, after
all this blood, death, and destruction, Dr. Baker (Marg Helgenberger)
exclaims the understatement of the year: "My. This is awful." Or how
about Press Lennox explaining the alien mating urge to an unbelieving
military general? He says something like, "Do you want them to f--ck us
into oblivion?"
Or the scene where the camera focuses carefully on a corpse as a mini
buzz saw blade cuts through the dead woman's grotesque and bloody head
during an autopsy. The doctor nonchalantly says, "Let me move this ear
aside, now..." 
Given sharp and witty dialogue, they probably could have turned this
movie into the alien version of SCREAM. But SPECIES II sticks straight
to the gore genre. Basically SPECIES II is a tongue-in-cheek B-grade
gore flick, and is satisfying as such. It's all blood, bodies, breasts,
corny lines, and alien tentacles, but don't expect more.

SPECIES II
Reviewed by Jamie Peck
The story, such as it is, casts Henstridge as a good guy, a docile clone 
of her "Species" character that helps out fellow original cast members 
Marg Helgenberger, as a brainy biologist, and Michael Madsen, a stoic 
hitman. They're pitted against a heroic astronaut (Justin Lazard) that 
returns from America's first Mars mission with a little something extra 
in the bloodstream. When the mood strikes him -- and the mood strikes 
him often, considering his alien urge to procreate -- he turns into a 
sex-crazed, slimy monster whose demon semen produce instant toddlers 
that cause his bedmates' bellies to graphically swell and pop right open 
post-coitus. So much for the afterglow, I guess. 
There's little imagination or creativity at work here, but those things 
aren't what "Species II"'s core audience will be looking for anyway; 
presumably, nobody's going to see this movie expecting anything more 
than gore, sex and special effects, so the character and story holes and 
lack of coherent plotting aren't really going to be enjoyment 
roadblocks. "Species II" is at least competently assembled, with slick 
production design, a few interesting moments and a couple of 
particularly puzzling celeb cameos (Richard Belzer as the president?). 
Take away the antagonist gender-reversal and this is essentially the 
very same movie as "Species." It even ends, not unlike its prequel, with 
the promise of another installment. Any takers? 
Recurring attempts to lend the film some emotional weight, as the 
antagonist is fully aware and occasionally horrified of the bloodshed 
he's causing, distract from the rest of the mostly campy proceedings, 
and even render certain scenes somewhat distasteful. Patches of "Species 
II" are genuinely, pleasantly goofy (particularly a scene where Lazard's 
brood demonstrates an inventive use for snot), but the film as a whole 
is highly inconsistent, and bouts of hilarity -- be they intentional or 
not -- don't justify a slight, needless sequel. The makers of "Species 
II" should have left the alien resurrections (and alien franchise 
resurrections) to Sigourney Weaver.

Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the movie theater,
there, lurking in the corners, leaps out a stupefyingly horrid sequel to
1995's sci-fi misfire, Species.
Those rascally scientists, not having learned their lesson from the
first movie, have recreated Sil...now called Eve (Natasha Henstridge).
Under the supervision of Dr. Laura Baker (Marg Helgenberger), this new
Eve is calmer and more sedate, but is used as a lab rat to research
weapons against future Species-alien attacks.
That disaster scenario is coming true sooner than some have anticipated.
The first manned mission to Mars is underway, with a crew including
Justin Lazard and Mykelti Williamson.  The Martian soil samples they
retrieve contain more than dirt...they contain Species DNA samples. When
the crew returns, all three may have been infected and are potentially
hazardous to their mates.  Luckily, NASA has established a 10-day sexual
quarantine for interplanetary flights (no, really!).
>From there, it all goes downhill (which, since it is one of the opening
scenes, is no small trick).  Soon, multiple alien sexual predators are
on the loose again, each trying to mate to produce the "perfect"
offspring.  Now that's one thing that I just don't quite understand
about this movie.  Why would this creature, which now has the ability to
assimilate people with merely a few strands of its DNA, need to bother
with creating a "perfect" offspring. (Disregarding the fact that the
offspring of two hybrids wouldn't necessarily be "pure").  One would
think that the creature should just wander around the countryside
bleeding.  Its pools of blood are apparently sentient, and if they can't
kill humanity...they should be able to merge with it in no time.
But that would assume the movie was trying to make sense.  No, this is
the movie that has people thinking things like, "Hmm...a crawling pool
of blood...I think I'll walk over and touch it..."  The film touts its
own stupidity and scientific ignorance as if it were a badge of honor
(even though I don't think the film's even smart enough to know what a
badge is.)
No...the heart of Species and its sequel is: alien sex.  Rather than
present us with the ultimate femme fatale, as in the original, the
sequel instead delivers a series of literally explosive pregnancies.  (A
strange thing though:  all the resulting offspring mysteriously acquire
identical grey shirts as their only form of clothing.  Maybe it's
another mutation...but then, I'm thinking again.  Bad reviewer!  Bad
reviewer!).  The film is chock full of  nudity (both human and alien),
sex and gore.  Heck, if that turns you on...more power to ya.
But don't go in expecting any great sci-fi action scenes.  (Or even
tepid ones like the original).  No, the brainless attitude of the film
destroys any sense of suspense even quicker than your credulity
evaporates.
One thing we can, unfortunately, expect is yet another sequel.  Like
most horror films, this one leaves the door wide open.  In fact, it
fails to resolve a central point to do so.  Gone are the days of the
faint rasp of facehuggers crawling after the credits in Aliens...these
days the filmmakers don't care about subtlety, or even resolving the
plot... At least they didn't stoop as low as the mutant rat in the first
film (a thread which, thankfully, is never followed upon).
As Marg Helgenberger utters after witnessing a spectacularly gory
corpse:  "This is awful...just awful."  I couldn't have said it better.

MGM; rated R (gore, graphic violence, language, nudity, rape, sexual
situations); 92 minutes
Cast: Michael Madsen, Mykelti Williamson, Justin Lazard, Marg Helgenberger,
Natasha Henstridge, George Dzunda, James Cromwell, Myriam Cyr, Peter Boyle.
Species II is quite simply one of the worst motion pictures I have ever had
the displeasure of seeing in a theater.  It is numbingly bad.  It is so bad I
had to look away from the screen for several points during the film simply to
prevent myself from going insane.
The original Species (1995) was a surprise summer sleeper and was part of
MGM's return to a major studio.  Species II could very well kill the studio
all over again (if they weren't still thriving from the latest Bond picture,
Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), it probably would for sure).
I don't think anyone would accuse the first film of being a classic but it was
a fun, sexy, sci-fi thriller with a solid cast and some creepy ideas.  It also
introduced the wildly sexy Natasha Henstridge and, unfortunately for her, she
returns here.  Since her character Sil was killed in the first film she
returns as a clone of her former self in this one.  She's now known as Eve and
is kept behind glass, and off screen, for much of the film.
The main focus of the film is on national hero Patrick Ross (Justin Lazard).
He's the first man to walk on Mars and the son of a prominent Senator (James
Cromwell).  He also begins to slowly wipe out the population because, due to a
nasty alien virus he contracted on the trip, whenever he has sex with women
they immediately become pregnant, carry the baby to term so that it can
explode from their stomach leaving the mother dead and grow at rapid speed
into evil alien spawn.  His ultimate goal?  To mate with Eve so that they can
create the ultimate, unstoppable, alien race.
Well since this guy is wiping out the population it's lucky for the government
that Eve is psychically linked to him and they have her under surveillance so
she can help them out.  Watching over her is Dr. Laura Baker (Marg
Helgenberger) who returns from the original film.  Also returning is Press
Lenox (Michael Madsen), and the two have a bizarrely less stimulating
relationship this time around.
Anyway they team up with another astronaut, Dennis Gamble (Mykelti
Williamson), who was exposed to the virus but didn't get infected.  A third,
female, astronaut (Myriam Cyr) also acquired the virus but since she's a woman
she dies immediately upon having sex.
Eventually they track down Patrick and kill him but not before Eve has broken
out and the two nearly mate (allowing for token exposure of Natasha's bare
breasts and butt).
To state all the reasons this movie is pure evil would take entirely too long.
There is really nothing redeeming.  The film is not even cheesy enough to be
fun.  It's just boring, overdone, ugly, offensive, disgusting, and awful.
None of the actors do anything to enliven the procedures.  Justin Lazard
basically ensures his stint as a movie star is over before it begins and
Madsen, Helgenberger, and Williamson look like they're just collecting
paychecks.  I don't even want to know what possessed the brilliant James
Cromwell to become involved in this, I'd rather just forget about it and watch
Babe, L.A. Confidential, or Star Trek: First Contact again.
Then there's poor Natasha Henstridge.  She's a beautiful woman and the scenes
of Eve in heat come closest to redeeming the film.  They flirt with being
honestly sexy which provides the film with it's only almost real moments.
Maybe she's a really great actress but even if she isn't she deserves better
than this.
If you must see the film just wait for video (or even cable, which is where
this movie should have premiered).  But don't say you haven't been warned...

Written by Chris Brancato.  
Directed by Peter Medak.  
Starring Michael Madsen, Natasha Henstridge, Marg Helgenberger.  
Rated R (contains nudity, violence, and profanity)  92 mins.  
Synopsis:  A popular astronaut journeys to Mars on a corporate-sponsored
space flight, picks up alien DNA, returns to Earth to have his picture
printed on "Space Flakes" cereal boxes, and mutates into a horny alien
predator.  Meanwhile, Eve, a genetic clone of Sil from the first SPECIES,
gains a psychic connection to the astronaut and fights her "urge to merge"
with him.  Press Lennox and Laura Baker (survivors of SPECIES), along with
a machete-wielding astronaut and a one-eyed colonel, try to stop the
growing alien menace.  
Comments:  Sometimes I really enjoy "Wednesday Dollar Nights" at the local
theater down the street from where I live.  This theater shows second-run
movies, and the cheap admission price is their way of increasing ticket
sales during the sluggish middle of the week.  Every now and then, a
thoroughly awful turkey will play there, and the audience gladly ridicules
it as if they were part of a massive "Mystery Science Theater 3000"
episode.  In recent years, Kent audiences, including myself, have paid a
buck each to bash WES CRAVEN'S NEW NIGHTMARE and ANACONDA.  These
experiences, however, did not prepare me for the laugh riot SPECIES II
engendered last Wednesday as one of the evening's dollar features.  
As a side note, allow me to be one of the few brave enough to admit that
he's seen SPECIES II more than once.  I saw it for the first time on the
Friday it came out (April 10, 1998).  The original SPECIES still stands as
one of the best sci-fi misfires of the decade, and the sequel promised to
be just as awful.  Critics came down fairly hard on SPECIES II, with good
reason.  The movie is terrible; it's a poorly-acted, exploitative film with
a heavy-handed, ludicrous plot full of continuity holes.  SPECIES II,
however, makes no claim to be good.  The movie poster prominently displays
star Natasha Henstridge in a silly uniform in front of a sillier backdrop
of stars with the slogan "Mating Season Begins" underneath.  People who
spent more than a dollar for this film should have known what they were in
for and expected the worse.  This Friday showing I saw with my brother had
a small audience who seemed to genuinely appreciate, and laugh at, the
cheese projected on the screen.  
I did not write this review, by the way, as a critic who expects an
Academy-Award-winning tour de force from a film like this.  Instead, the
four stars I award this turkey are deserved on the merits of having a fun
time with a bad sci-fi / horror film.  (I did deduct a star for an
inexcusable scene I'll discuss later.)  SPECIES II, like its predecessor,
reminds me of the 1940s-1950s Universal and AIP monster movies that were a
staple of my Saturday afternoons growing up.  Very few films these days
capture the magic of that by-gone era of Bug-Eyed Monsters, army generals,
and scientists' daughters like the two SPECIES films do.  
Returning now to the Kent Cinema last Wednesday, which would have been
April 29, 1998 (obviously, it didn't take long for SPECIES II to leave
first-run theaters), I convinced a couple friends to go see it with me.
Knowing them fairly well, I expected they would find the film a humorous
romp too.  The packed audience, however, surprised me with their continuous
berating of the movie.  I haven't been part of a movie crowd who had this
much fun at a bad movie in quite some time (although I did hear one guy
behind me ask his neighbor "is this supposed to be funny?" early on in the
film).  It was like a spontaneous, impromptu showing of THE ROCKY HORROR
PICTURE SHOW without fans dressed up in costume.  They laughed with good
reason too.  The opening scene involves a slow-moving space shuttle with
corporate logos painted on the end of it like tacky bumper stickers,
bringing allusions to Mel Brooks's SPACEBALLS' opening sequence from the
crowd.  People got a real hoot out of the "Space Flakes" cereal boxes
predominant in a supermarket scene, and an over-the-top colonel with one
eye drew pirate-like "Arrrrr"s in every scene he appeared in.  
The convoluted storyline, briefly outlined in my synopsis above, is
laughable from start to finish.  Filled with technobabble and
inconsistencies, SPECIES II almost seems to challenge its viewers to
identify all of its errors.  Eve (who, in the first place, thought it'd be
a great idea to clone Sil from the first SPECIES, after all the death and
destruction she caused?) remains in a chamber isolated from men (in order
to keep her docile) -- even though she's allowed to watch baseball and "The
Dukes of Hazzard," and men constantly walk around outside the chamber.  Eve
has a device implanted in her head that's supposed to kill her if she
leaves her cell -- when she does escape, she has no problem, apparently,
with this device.  The list could go on and on.  
If the plot is considered bad, then the dialogue's worse.  A discussion of
SPECIES II's dialogue, though, could not be complete without combining it
with a discussion of its actors.  Natasha Henstridge, as in the first
SPECIES, does not have many lines here.  An attractive supermodel, she's
basically around to strut around in various states of undress.  Also
returning for a second go-round are Michael Madsen and Marg Helgenberger.
Madsen, as government agent Press Lennox, really makes these SPECIES movies
work.  He constantly looks dissipated and elicits laughter from the
audience in nearly every scene he's in (he's really that bad in this role).
 Madsen is quickly becoming the John Agar of the 1990s.  His best line, the
one which people laughed at the hardest during both showings I attended,
was a poorly-delivered warning about the alien menace: "they'll f--k
humanity out of existence!"  Poor Marg Helgenberger, returning as scientist
Laura Baker (Lennox's unlikely love interest) does not fare much better.
When Eve becomes a disgusting, nine-foot, alien creature (designed by
ALIEN's H.R. Giger) in a ridiculously over-the-top, slimy, gooey, bloody
scene, Helgenberger states "don't forget she's still half-human."  
The original SPECIES had first-rate, top-notch actors (most notably Ben
Kingsley and Forest Whitaker) embarrass themselves completely with their
appearances in the film, providing some of its amusement.  SPECIES II
continues this trend.  FORREST GUMP's Mykelti Williamson plays an astronaut
helping super-dud-agent Lennox and super-stupid-scientist Baker track down
the two aliens before they f--k us out of existence.  At one point, he
brandishes a sword instead of a much more sensible weapon, like a machine
gun, and claims "I'm goin' back to Africa on his ass!"  BABE and STAR TREK:
FIRST CONTACT's James Cromwell must also be regretting his choice of roles,
as he portrays a dumb-hick of a senator who is father to the astronaut
infected with the libidinous alien DNA.  
Justin Lazard has the role of the ill-fated astronaut who causes all the
chaos this time around.  He does a suitable job playing his character;
however, the character itself is the biggest flaw of the film.  In the
first SPECIES, Natasha Henstridge's Sil seduced men before she killed them.
 "Seduced" is the operating word here.  Much like the vampire myth, people
(men in this case) became victims because they gave in to their passion
under the spell of a seducer, whether that seducer was a vampire or, in
SPECIES, an alien / human hybrid.  (Sil, granted, also killed when she felt
threatened -- the train attendant being a prime example.)  In SPECIES II,
the same is true for the most part.  Lazard's character, Patrick Ross,
seduces the women around him, or he hires out prostitutes.  In either case,
these victims pay for their sins (or so it could be read as such).  In one
scene, a rather prolonged scene, however, Ross abducts a woman from a
supermarket and shoves her into a van to force himself upon her.  This
violation, even though the deed is interrupted before completion, is
inexcusable for a film that is quite obviously trying for a comic effect,
and it disrupts the otherwise cheesy, darkly humorous tone of the movie.  
Some critics took offense at what they deemed excessive gore in SPECIES II.
 In an obvious parody of the ALIEN series, for example, 8-year-old children
burst out of the stomachs of women Ross had sex with mere moments before.
In another scene, Ross tries to commit suicide by shooting himself in the
head.  Having blown it away with a shotgun, his head slowly rebuilds itself
as the camera pans around his body.  I'm not a big fan of gore in films;
the sight of blood makes me uneasy.  These scenes, however, graphic as they
may sound, are so unrealistic, fake, and over-the-top that they seem
absurdly funny rather than morbidly terrifying.  Scenes like these brought
laughter from both audiences I was a part of.  
SPECIES II is most certainly not for everyone.  It deserves its R-rating
and is completely inappropriate for children.  For those adults, however,
who still get a big kick out of watching and ridiculing bad monster flicks,
this turkey's definately up your alley.  (And, hey, what other film would
cast comic Richard Belzer as President of the U.S. while throwing Peter
Boyle in an insane asylum?)

CAPSULE: MONEY TRAIN has been displaced; SPECIES II is the worst movie ever
made by a major studio.
You'll notice that there's a "minus" sign in front of my one-star rating of
SPECIES II. This is deliberate: normally, the lowest I go for any movie is
"no stars", meaning that I was not only unentertained, but offended as well.
Minus-one stars, then, goes even lower than that. SPECIES II is the most
offensive movie -- morally and aesthetically -- ever made by a big-name
studio. Period. It's a sequel, I guess, to the dumb ALIEN ripoff of a few
years back that had one twist: we got a sexy *female* alien, who transformed
into a very unsexy puddle of chow mein when she got horny. This movie doesn't
even have a new element to bring to the mix. It's a geek show.
There is one scene in SPECIES II that is the core of my disgust with the
film. It consists of two creatures that we have seen represented as humans,
transformed into aliens. One of them -- the "male" -- attacks the "female" in
a very specifically sexual way, raping her orally. It's impossible to
interpret what happens as anything else. I am astonished that a PG-13 rated
film could contain a revoltingly explicit depiction, however metaphorical, of
oral rape -- and with no point to it except to give us trashy shock. But
there it is.
When the film isn't being disgusting, it's boring. Its plot, what little I
could find of it, centers around astronauts returning from Mars infected with
the same alien DNA that spawned the first movie's "Sil". One of them mutates,
mates like mad, learns that there's a female alien on Earth somewhere, runs
amuck. I am not leaving out much, nor am I trying to.
The director of his garbage, incredibly, is Peter Medak. Medak is a good
filmmaker, and you will never know that from watching this movie. Medak has
directed LET HIM HAVE IT, ROMEO IS BLEEDING, and THE KRAYS, all of which were
above-average movies about crime and violence. SPECIES II seems to have been
done entirely on autopilot, which is a shame, because if he'd bothered to
take the material into hand, he could have reworked it into something less
purposelessly nauseating and vile.
A friend brought up a comparison that's worth mentioning here. The Japanese
animated sex-and-apocalypse epic LEGEND OF THE OVERFIEND is wall-to-wall with
scenes like the one I described above, and worse. But it is nowhere nearly as
hateful as SPECIES II is. As disgusting and repellent as LEGEND OF THE
OVERFIEND was, it at least had a degree of internal consistency and ferocious
energy. SPECIES II doesn't even classify as a beer movie (not unless you feel
like cleaning beer-vomit off the couch). It isn't interesting, original,
watchable, thought-provoking *or* entertaining. It's an all-new cinematic low.
Congratulations, guys. You're my new basement tenants.

        You don't need to have seen the original "Species" to appreciate
how utterly lousy "Species II" is.
        With few exceptions, sequels tend to be worse than the films that
spawned them, but the fact that "Species II" is a follow-up isn't the only
reason it's so miserable.  It's the predictable storyline, the cardboard
characters, the banal dialogue, the failed attempts at humor, the revolting
special effects, the gratuitous nudity (all female, of course), the bad
acting, and the bland direction.
        The plot, simply geared at getting the alien species back on planet
earth so that it can reak some more havoc, involves three astronauts
landing on Mars and inadvertently bringing some alien slime in a soil
sample back aboard their shuttle.  The slime, well, sort of jumps out at
them and the screen turns black.  That should have been the end of the
movie right there.
        Back on terra firma, at least one of the crew is now a carrier of
alien DNA and, as you'll remember if you saw the first movie, driven by a
strong urge to procreate.  On a parallel track, government scientists have
cloned a version of Sil from the first film (now called Eve, again "played"
by Natasha Henstridge) and are keeping her around for some testing.  This,
apparently, includes observing Eve's reaction to "The Dukes of Hazzard" tv
show, which she appears to enjoy.
        Eve's bio-rhythms go off the scale each time one of her kinfolk
"mates," which we are forced to witness in gross-out detail, but otherwise
there doesn't appear to be a whole lot of reason why Henstridge is in this
film, unless it was written into her contract (let's hope it cited one
sequel and one sequel only).
        Eve finally breaks free of her confines--and her bra--for the
finale, but the effects are so messy you can't really see what's going on.
        Peter Boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who
screams "I told 'em not to go!" at the top of his lungs, referring to the
Mars mission but more likely aimed at the makers of this piffle.  Michael
Madsen reprises his role of Press Lennox (so that he can enter high
security areas, flash a badge and claim to be Press, maybe?), as does Marg
Helgenberger as Dr. Laura Baker, the one subjecting Eve to the tv reruns.
They're both unbelievably wooden.
        What's a talented filmmaker like Peter Medak ("The Ruling Class,"
"The Krays," "Let Him Have It") doing directing this tripe, I wonder.  It's
an unfortunate trend, this: once-talented directors throwing in the towel
and lending their names to unchallenging horror flicks like "Species II."
Last year Peter Hyams gave us "The Relic"; no thanks necessary there.  And
the first "Species" was helmed by Roger Donaldson who, although certainly
no genius behind the camera, had demonstrated much better judgment with his
previous choice of projects.
        "Species II" is worthless.  Worse than that, it's also
exploitative, offensive, and insulting to the intelligence at every turn.
It's not that there isn't anything positive to say about the film.  There
is.  After 92 minutes, it ends.

      Be forewarned. 
    -------------------------------------------------------------
   I was incredulous when I first heard that MGM was planning a sequel
   to their 1995 science-fiction flick SPECIES.  Squandering an
   intriguing premise, the original film turned out to be a dreadful
   mess, widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike -- and
   nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success,
   raking in over $60 million domestic during the competitive summer
   season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast (Ben
   Kingsley's a splendid actor, but a marquee name he ain't).
   Miraculously dodging the bullet with the first film, I doubted that
   they'd dare tempt fate and go for another round.
   So here comes SPECIES II, with a new creative team (director Peter
   Medak and screenwriter Chris Brancato step in for Roger Donaldson and
   Dennis Feldman, respectively) that fails to improve the series one
   iota -- like its predecessor, SPECIES II fails to capitalize on a
   potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from
   ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid.
   The film follows the exploits of a young man, Patrick Ross (Justin
   Lazard), whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order
   to pick up women, loitering in strip clubs, and generally trying to
   bed as many different ladies as he possibly can.  In other words,
   Patrick is like a lot of guys; these activities could describe the
   everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age, but there's a
   catch -- he's an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly
   successful mission to Mars, and who's now infected with alien DNA.
   Patrick's overriding compulsion: to mate and sire countless numbers
   of gooey little alien offspring.  And when he becomes aware of Eve
   (Natasha Henstridge), a half-human, half-alien clone of the monster
   from the first film being studied in a government lab, Patrick's
   primary focus turns to her -- "if these two were to mate, the
   resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable" warns Dr.
   Laura Baker (Marg Helgenberger, gamely reprising her role) with
   admirable conviction.
   SPECIES II opens with the Mars mission, and the space scenes are
   remarkably unconvincing and hokey-looking, even splicing back to
   dated, grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities -- they really
   skimped on production values this time around.  However, this all
   looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of
   the evil alien goo which ultimately infests Patrick; watching as it
   slinks around the command module of the spaceship, any question as to
   whether or not this is a cheesy B-movie is quickly answered.
   Mr. Brancato's original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines
   which often leaves the audience in stitches.  Like the first film
   (and perhaps in homage to it), there's a real penchant for dialogue
   which underlines the obvious.  Last time around featured the
   hootworthy line uttered by Forest Whitaker's psychic empath character
   upon entering a bloodsoaked room -- "Something bad happened here."
   This time, Laura gets to stand over a fresh, shredded corpse with its
   entails ripped out and mutter "This is awful."  And she's not even
   empathic!
   And when a psychotically horny Patrick accosts a supermarket shopper
   and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a
   woefully-paced suspense sequence, Eve, who's telepathically linked to
   her alien/human-hybrid counterpart (whatever), helpfully tells our
   alien-hunting protagonists, "He's going to rape her."
   While SPECIES II is often unintentionally hilarious, at least it
   occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own.  There's an
   amusing, tongue-in-cheek bit of product placement (which doesn't
   really make much sense, but I appreciated the sentiment), as well as
   some supermarket-related hijinx ("He's in Aisle 1!" informs Eve).  If
   the film maintained this sort of light-hearted tone, it would have
   been much more charming and enjoyable to watch, but, to its
   detriment, it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and
   barrels along to a bloody, effects-ladened anticlimactic conclusion.
   Much of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense, and there are
   such gaping plot holes that it's terribly difficult to contain any
   suspension of disbelief.  The implausibilities are endless: what
   about the toxic bomb in Eve's brain?  Why are the guards armed with
   guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual?  My favourite
   was the slow-motion sequence in the film where Eve, sporting
   superhuman strength, is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting
   to contain her with what look like body blocks.  This is the sort of
   movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief,
   incredulous that it's being foisted upon the public.
   Returning headlines Michael Madsen (who reprises tough guy Press
   Lennox) and Ms. Helgenberger do what they can with this goofy
   screenplay, but there's realistically only so much one can do with
   this script as a basis.  Mykelti Williamson (portraying astronaut
   Dennis Gamble) churns out an all-too-familiar spin on a generic
   brash-mouthed character, and fine character actors George Dzundza
   (playing Colonel Burgess and looking ridiculous in the process) and
   James Cromwell (Patrick's neglectful father, Senator Ross) are
   utterly wasted in the film.  Mr. Lazard gives his character an
   appropriately shifty-eyed look, while returning vixen Ms. Henstridge
   is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene (and acquits
   herself nicely), but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar
   role of parading about in skimpy clothing (or none at all).
   Ms. Henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have
   expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the
   SPECIES series, claiming that "she's so empowered."  A lethal
   half-alien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque
   fashion -- now *that's* what I call empowerment.

Despite its exceedingly well-done visual effects, 1995's original Species
was one big hunk of sci-fi cheese, from the writing to the feeble
performances.  So, coming from such B-grade roots, its sequel's stunning
ineptitude is not terribly surprising, yet at the same time it is.  It
would not have been difficult at all for the people behind Species II to
top the hokey original, yet they have somehow managed to fabricate
something just as bad, if not even worse.
Something is clearly amiss when the back door left open for a sequel in
Species--a sewer rat becomes not quite of this Earth after eating a body
part from the exploded alien/human hybrid Sil--is never entered into
(perhaps that was left
for Species III--though I'm not giving away anything when I say that this
installment has an open back door of its own). The alien fun and games
begin this time when a three-person astronaut crew returning from Mars
inadvertently carries within their soil samples deadly alien DNA that
eventually infects the mission captain, Patrick Ross (Justin Lazard, late
of CBS's short-lived soap of a few years back, Central Park West/CPW).
This alien DNA is not identical to that which created the original film's
Sil, but it's close enough, and upon arrival on Earth Patrick is mating
like crazy, engaging in bloody sex with just about every woman he can find.
 Meanwhile, scientist Dr. Laura Baker (the returning Marg Helgenberger) has
created a clone of Sil named Eve (Natasha Henstridge again) for research
purposes.  It doesn't take long for Eve to sense another alien presence,
which send her libido into hyperdrive.  It's up to Laura and her former
partner, bounty hunter Press Lennox (Michael Madsen, another returnee); and
Patrick's uninfected shipmate Dennis Gamble (Mykelti Williamson) to find
Patrick before the in-heat Eve does.
"This isn't The X-Files, goddammit!" exclaims one character in the early
going.  In terms of quality, he's absolutely right, but he's also wrong.
The new alien first appears as an otherworldly oozing sludge that causes
Patrick's pupils to dilate once he's infected.  Looks and sounds an awful
lot like The X-Files's "black cancer" to me. But that's not the only source
director Peter Medak and writer Chris Brancato steal from.  Species was
already a ripoff of Alien, but Medak makes the cribbing much more blatant
than the original's director, Roger Donaldson, did.  Human Patrick is given
a tongue that also has a tongue within itself, and his alien form more
closely resembles the Alien than Eve's alien body (which ironically was
designed by Alien designer H.R. Giger).  A large alien hive that our heros
douse with a substance fired from large guns?  Aliens sans flamethrowers.
The visual effects were by far the best thing about Species, and the
sequel's effects crew at Steve Johnson's XFX Inc. keeps that high-quality
tradition alive; no cheap-looking Lost in Space CGI here.  After the
effects, the original's best asset was the fresh presence of Henstridge.
However, Medak and Brancato have no idea what exactly to do with her for
this installment.  At one point she's called on to play alien "empath" ŕ la
Forest Whitaker in the original, but for most of the duration she's holed
up in a glass cell.  By the time the big breakout so prominently featured
in the trailer actually takes place, the film is well into its home stretch.
So the rest of the time we are treated to Patrick, played with little zest
by Lazard.  One problem with the first film was that the deadly, horny, but
innocent-at-heart Sil was too sympathetic; no such problem with Patrick, who
comes off as a cocky pretty boy before the alien takes control.  The rest
of the cast also fails to add much, but the writing can be faulted for
that.  Helgenberger and Madsen go through the motions, but they are already
hampered by the clichéd development that somewhere between the two films,
the once-linked Laura and Press stopped getting along.  Williamson suffers
the worst indignity.  He tries his best to enliven the token
African-American role, but how can anyone recite insulting, derivative
lines such as "I'm gonna get African on someone's ass" and not appear
ridiculous?
But Species II's worst crime is being a thoroughly uninteresting piece of
work. At least the original featured plenty to laugh at--unaccountably
awful performances by the otherwise fine actors Ben Kingsley and Whitaker,
and the sight of Helgenberger's character performing fellatio on Madsen's,
for a start.  But the filmmakers do not display any discernable effort at
all, let alone the misguided effort that is required for something to reach
the camp level.  For all the blood and gore, nudity, and sex thrown in,
Species II is, quite simply, a vapid bore.

My son and I share a perverse predilection for bad movies. We are amused and
entertained by the cheap thrills, the corny dialog, the ludicrous premises
and the bad acting. Since other family members aspire to higher forms of
entertainment, we usually wind up indulging our proclivity together. I can't
remember when we disagreed on the relative merits of a clunker until SPECIES
2 came along. He was not amused. I on the other hand was able to easily
suspend the applicable requirements in the usual manner and declare myself
suitably entertained. Perhaps the evident skills that were brought to the
process of producing a bad product was what prevented him from extracting
fun out of mediocrity. I on the other hand appreciated the fact that the
producers and director knew exactly what they were doing: insulting my
intelligence, and brought adequate movie-making skills to the project  A
movie does not have to be good to be well made, at least in terms of the
craft.
The movie could have been better if it were not so brusque. This movie slaps
you with conception, pregnancy, delivery and young childhood in consecutive
frames, without pausing for infancy. The producers of NESCAFE have nothing
on this alien race in which a woman's womb balloons immediately after the
male orgasm, and a few seconds later a young child tears its way out of her
abdomen in a sloppy and gory version of an inside-out Cesarean.
An autopsy scene in which a buzz saw cuts through the cranium was not the
kind of indulgence that I condone, to say nothing of the fact that it was
scientifically incorrect. In a real autopsy the saw does not cut through the
scalp; it is used only after the skull has been exposed.
The opening sequences of exploration of Mars were very good. The writers
showed excellent skills for ceremonial speech writing but the spontaneous
dialogue would qualify for a subtitle: `As Bad As It Gets'. As the movie
progressed I vowed to remember the lines that made me cringe but only one
stuck. Eve (Natasha Henstridge) was cloned from Sil, the original alien
sexual predator, but her mating instinct was artificially attenuated, which
was all that was needed to turn her into a noble and cooperative prisoner.
In a wistful display of resignation and understanding she tells her friend
and jailer (Marg Helgenberger): `I think of all the places that I will never
see and all the people that I will never meet.' It's enough to melt the most
callous heart. At another point she protests: `I'm human too, you know.' She
is only half right.
Peter Medak, the director, knows his business. Justin Lazard as the doomed
astronaut does nothing to enhance his Hollywood credentials. James Cromwell,
his father, is perfect in a short role. Marg Heldenberger, the DNA scientist
is pleasant and beautiful. Natasha is an exquisite ornament. George Dzunza
knew and delivered what was expected of him as the dumb general that messes
things up. Michael Madsen was there. Black buddies do not usually survive in
this type of movie but Mykelti Williamson  manages to stay around for the
final credits, which is more that we can say for Lazard..

More of a soft-core porno than a sci-fi thriller, Species II fails to
live up to its predecessor in terms of story, direction or amount of
nudity.  And let's face it, the bar wasn't really set that high to begin
with.  Errrexcept for the latter.
The whole idea of the story is so implausible that it makes David Lynch
easy to understand.  It seems that the government has recreated the
alien from the first film  the one that they destroyed  in an attempt
to evaluate potential vulnerabilities on the off chance that they ever
choose to attack Earth.  This time, she's called Eve (Natasha
Henstridge, Maximum Risk) and is isolated in a high security lab far
away from the men that she needs to procreate.  This babe gets all moist
when she sees Michael Madsen, so you know she's just aching for it.
Like Banky says in Chasing Amy, `Chicks need dick.  I mean, they just
plain NEED it' and Eve is certainly no exception.
The dick is Patrick Ross (Justin Lazard), the astronaut son of a
successful Senator (James Cromwell, Babe).  We are introduced to Patrick
as he becomes the first man to walk on Mars, in a mission to collect
dirt from the red planet.  Why a three-man crew needed to do this, I
will never know.
In this dirt is some very unfriendly space goo that thaws and runs about
the floor of the spacecraft.  As it reaches the unsuspecting trio, they
suddenly lose about eight minutes of time.  This is fine with me because
it's eight less minutes that I have to suffer through on the screen.
Did I mention that the ship is plastered with advertisements for various
companies that really exist?  I was relieved to find out that Microsoft
doesn't take over the world in the future, but my contentment was short
lived because I think that Species II actually takes place in the
present.  My evidence is twofold  the presence of a Bill Clinton photo
behind Senator Ross' desk and the Clinton-esque Richard Belzer
portraying the leader of the free world.
Anyway, the space goo gets all into Patrick's head and somehow turns him
into an alien.  This means that every time he bangs some girl, she
becomes instantly pregnant and gives violent bloody birth in a just a
few minutes.  Since Patrick is a national hero, he's getting all kinds
of hot action - including two sisters - and soon has a whole pack of
creepy Village of the Damned type kids following him around.  In other
news, Patrick's blood can also morph into an alien.  I don't even know
what this means.
The government, led by fathead Marilyn Manson twin Colonel Carter
Burgess (George Dzundza, Basic Instinct), hires the fathead who helped
save the planet in the first picture, Press Lennox (Madsen, Reservoir
Dogs).  Together, they track down Patrick and find an unlikely ally in
sickle-cell anemia.  Now that's a strange twist.
On a positive note, Species II is mercifully short and boasts a
collection of at least five pairs of naked breasts.  It is the latter,
not the former, that results in the PLANET SICK-BOY rating.

Running Time: 92 minutes
Well well well, the sequel I never wanted has arrived. Before I review
Species II however, let me recap how the first film ended. As you'll
no doubt recall, Sil (Natasha Henstridge) turned into a computer
graphic, gave birth to a son who also turned into a computer graphic,
but were both destroyed by government hitman Michael Madsen. BUT, a
piece of one of the alien creatures was eaten by a rat, and now the
alien was alive and well inside the little rat critter. Obviously rats
breed quickly, and so mankind was surely doomed.
Well forget all that! In true horror movie style, the ending of the
previous film just didn't happen. Instead, our story starts with a
manned mission to Mars. Astronaut Justin Lazard lands on Mars,
collects soil samples, and reboards the ship. Unfortunately for the
crew of the ship, those soil samples just happen to contain the same
alien DNA that Sil was created from (don't ask why it's on Mars, when
in the first film we're told it came from an advanced alien species
via outer space radio communications). Soon, two-thirds of the ship's
crew is infected with the alien DNA. Upon their return to earth, the
alien DNA inside them wants them to breed, which Lazard then tries to
do with every woman he meets.
Let's talk about bad writing. For example, the astronauts are greeted
in space with a video message from the president of the United States
(Richard Belzer, doing his awful Ronald Reagan impression). Later, in
the office of a US Senator (James Cromwell) a picture of president
Bill Clinton is blatantly visible on the wall, as it would be in any
government office. Then, upon returning home the astronauts are put
into "quarantine" which for some reason only means sexual
quarantine... they can go out and socialize with the world... just no
sex. Really? Is that the only NASA protocol after being on Mars? Also,
Madsen and Helgenberger were starting to be romantically involved by
the end of the first film. Now, they hardly even speak to each other,
with no explanation as to what's happened between them. There's plenty
more too... but I just don't feel like wasting any more of my life
writing about it.
As with almost all bad sci-fi/horror films, the filmmakers try to hide
the fact that the script is awful by piling on the blood and
gore. Species II is no exception. Lots of stomachs bursting open
(Alien anyone?) and mutililation for you fans of that sort of thing,
along with blood, blood, and more blood.
Natasha Henstridge has an extended cameo as another hybrid alien named
Eve that we've created for whatever reason the writer was able to
concoct to get Natasha Henstridge in the film. Oh and yes for you fans
of naked Natasha, she gets naked again. Also, James Cromwell and
George Dzundza have absolutely no business in this film
whatsoever. Both of them overact for no reason at all, and their
characters contribute nothing to the story being told. What a waste.
There were only three brief moments in the film that made it
worthwhile.  The first is a quick moment at the beginning when we see
that the space program is now funded by big corporations like Pepsi,
which have advertisements on the spacecraft heading to Mars. The other
two involve Michael Madsen (who, like in the first film, gives an
entertaining performance but yet never seems to take any of the events
going on around him seriously). One moment has to do with a
confrontation between Madsen and a pimp in a wheelchair. The second
involves Madsen in a grocery store, where after colliding with a
clerk, he pulls his gun on him and violently asks where the cereal
aisle is. I seriously doubt either of those two moments could have
been scripted.
At the end of Species II after about the most uninvolving "battle with
aliens" scene you'll ever see, we're given not just one, not two, but
THREE different possibilites for a third film. Each of them is equally
absurd, but how much would you care to bet that if a third film is
made (god forbid) that all three will be completely brushed aside? [R]

Cast: Michael Madsen, Natasha Henstridge, Marg Helgenberger, Justin
Lazard, Mykelti Williamson, George Dzundza, James Cromwell
Director: Peter Medak
Screenplay: Chris Brancato
Australian theatrical release date: July 9
The premise of Species 2 is not much different from the first: a hybrid
alien/human is on the rampage in the US, screwing any and everyone it
encounters in order to reproduce.  Wisely put by Michael Madsen, "It
could fuck the human race out of existence."  And if this isn't an
example of cinematic dopiness in its prime, I don't know what is.
Returning from Species is Natasha Henstridge, playing a half-human,
half-alien government creation named Eve.  Also returning is Dr. Laura
Baker (Marg Helgenberger), who conducts cruel experiments on Eve, and
Press Lennox (Madsen), an ex-military assassin.  Lennox joins with
astronaut Dennis Gamble (Mykelti Williamson), and chases another
astronaut, Patrick Ross (Justin Lazard), who has been infected with
alien DNA on a recent trip to Mars. Patrick has cross-country sex,
impregnating hookers and, for that matter, almost anyone he encounters.
Thus aliens burst out of the women's stomachs, and in no time Patrick's
hideaway is chock a block with cocoons, ready to spit out fully grown,
deadly reproductive killers.
Generally speaking, Species was a largely entertaining piece.
Henstridge's seductive alien character Sil was tantalizing to watch; she
was dazzling when she took her shirt off, and spine chilling at the same
time.  Though it sometimes pushed itself to the edge of acceptance, most
of Species was guiltily enjoyable as a popcorn flick.  Dopey, yes.  But
obliging and exciting - and that's what really mattered.
Species 2 quickly finds itself full of the cliches and witless formulas
that its predecessor only narrowly avoided.  The characters appear as
lifeless textbook creations, the action scenes look amateur and the
special effects are dull and somber.  It's a pity that the screenplay by
Chris Brancato (Hoodlum) has not been able to defy all odds, and make a
film with a silly initial idea become a film with a worthwhile Sci Fi
flavour, letting us suspend disbelief for the parts that don't make much
sense.  But Brancato's writing is so consistently sluggish, so
consistently stale that it ends up not only being a terrible Sci Fi, but
also a terrible drama and a terrible action adventure.
But whatever it is, Species 2 is definitely not a terrible comedy.  It's
just a shame that the most funny parts - and boy, there are quite a few
of them - are it's most important, "serious" parts.  At the media
screening, howls of laughter flew over the audience; with seemingly
everyone eager to mock the film's pitiful dialogue.  It may not have
been widely enjoyed, but people sure did enjoy not enjoying it.  Simply,
because it is that bad.
I cannot understand why James Crowell decided to play the degrading part
of Patrick's father, Senator Ross.  It's hard to believe that this is
the same man who was Oscar nominated for his memorable performance in
Babe, and who delivered a dynamic role in L.A. Confidential.  And for
that matter, why Ben Kingsley played one of the main parts in Species.
As for the other cast members, Michael Madsen looks good on the screen
in his relaxed role, but there's not much else he can do with a script
as bogged down as this.  Justin Lazard is as stiff as a board and twice
as boring, whilst Natasha Henstridge performs adequately but ultimately
serves simply as something nice to look at.
I can't say that I couldn't have seen this coming.  When I informed my
local video clerk that the film was a disaster, he replied "You mean you
needed to see it to know that?"  But even if, like me, you did enjoy
Species, some valuable advice would be to stay far away from its sequel.
Species 2 is without a doubt the worst written, and most horrifically
sluggish film so far this year.

Species II (1998)
Rated R for strong sexuality, sci-fi violence/gore and language.
----------  Out of 4 stars: ***1/2 (3 1/2 Stars)
Starring: Michael Madsen, Marg Helgenberger, Natasha Henstridge, Justin
Lazard, James Cromwell, George Dzundza, Mykelti Williamson.
Here is a film that is so unexpected, so scary, and so original that it
caught me off guard and threw me for a loop.  Okay, it isn't quite
original, considering it is a sequel to the box office hit SPECIES, but
it certainly is smart.  Most films of this genre are reminiscent of
those cheesy B-horror films from the 50s and 60s, and some even become
them.  However, as we learned with the 1995 small-budget horror/sci-fi
film, sometimes expectations can be shattered.
A lot of criticism has gone against this film (from what I have read so
far, anyway--yep, all two reviews), and it makes me wonder why these
types of films are automatically dismissed as gory, laughable pieces of
trash.  But, the thing is, it isn't.  It's well made, well acted, and
quite intelligent.  I can see most of the critics now complaining about
the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film.  But the
SPECIES series isn't about the lack of these elements.  It's about how
much it can get into one film.  And yet, behind it all, it has this
basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so.
SPECIES II begins in the present day, though it seems to be an alternate
universe.  Many films (especially sci-fi ones) create similar timelines
as our realistic one, but change it to fit the film's needs.  SPECIES II
begins with the arrival of an American spacecraft, the Excursion,
landing on the surface of Mars.  Aboard is Patrick Ross (Justin Lazard),
a very bright and very handsome astronaut.  Patrick is the son of
Senator Ross (James Cromwell), who just wants Patrick to succeed.  Well,
it would seem that he has succeeded.  Landing on the surface of Mars, he
is the first human being to ever do so.  Of course, he isn't the first
ever.
About a billion years ago, an alien species supposedly landed on Mars
and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain
life.  Now, of course, the red planet is cold and rocky.  No life lives
on it.  That is, no visible life.  Patrick, upon leaving the spacecraft
and landing on the red soil, collects samples from the ground.   He
takes them aboard, and puts them in storage.  Unfortunately, one of the
samples contains a form of life, and it gets loose when it is heated
aboard the ship.  Just prior to heading back to Earth, this life form
creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings.  They pass out for
approximately seven minutes, and then shrug it off as nothing, because
they can't even remember.  They blame it on a technical malfunction.
Back on Earth, Patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many
women as possible.  As we know from the original, this is because the
alien wants to breed and take over the planet.  However, the children
that are bred are half-human, as their father is.  Patrick is really
looking for another alien to breed with, and he finds it in Eve (Natasha
Henstridge).  Eve was cloned from DNA taken from Sil, the original
alien.  However, this time around, most of her "alien" urges have been
either decreased dramatically, or lie dormant.  The project is led by
Dr. Laura Baker (Marg Helgenberger, reprising her role from SPECIES),
and her motives seem respectable.  Since she was involved with the
original alien attack, she wants to learn how to stop the alien should
it come again.  And it has.
Story-wise, SPECIES II is much stronger than its predecessor, but it is
also much stronger than, say, ALIENS (hey, I love the film, but you
can't tell me it was strong on story).  What surprised me the most with
this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the
screenplay.  In my Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence course in
college, we learned about a piece of rock from Mars which landed in one
of the poles.  This piece of rock contained fossils which may have been
proof of life on Mars (later, it was proven that it was not a living
creature that created it).  The script uses this effectively, but also
manages to provide a well-balanced plot.  Beginning with the first man
on Mars (something I have always dreamed of seeing), I was hoping that
the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the
movie.  And it does it quite well.  The characters are all smart, and
they know what to do and what not to do.  The only character that seems
a little cliched is the General (George Dzundza), and yet, he remains
logical in everything he does.
There are the obvious flaws of course, mostly lying in the technical
aspects.  The special effects are only mediocre, and some are just plain
bad.  But for the most part, they remain believable (I even noticed a
homage to the ALIEN series when the mothers gave birth to alien
children).  Also, the most realistic ones are usually the goriest,
ranging from people being torn open, or someone's head being blown off.
However, some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience,
including a menage a troi that is all but necessary.  Many people
dislike the SPECIES series because all it is is an excuse for sex,
nudity, and gory violence.  However, I tend to disagree.  What were the
ALIEN films about?  And, if an alien species ever did come to Earth, and
their sole purpose was to destroy us, wouldn't you mate as quickly as
possible with as many people as possible?  My only gripe with this is
during the scene where Patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery
store.  I didn't realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women
to mate with (I just assume it is his part-human side looking for the
most beautiful one).
The acting is quite good for this kind of film.  It is a vast
improvement over the first film, at least.  The acting is the key
element to this film: if it was bad, it would have lowered itself into
camp; if it was good, it would have asked for comparison with films like
ALIENS.  Okay, so it isn't THAT good.  George Dzundza is probably the
most obvious mistake on casting, as his over-the-top impersonation of a
general makes him annoying and distracting.  Natasha Henstridge is
limited this time around, as she is usually enclosed in a cage.
However, she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect
hindering any of her talent.  Oh yeah, and she's quite fun to just plain
watch.  Marg Helgenberger is immensely better this time around, and her
performance is probably the best in this film.  Michael Madsen is so-so,
but he isn't annoying, and he soon becomes rather appealing (with his
nice cynic personality).  James Cromwell has a small part, but he makes
it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable
actor.  As I say, any film with James Cromwell dramatically increases in
likeability.  Mykelti Williamson gives an enjoyable performance, and he
gives the film a more down-to-earth feel.  And, of course, Justin
Lazard.  Lazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance, but I
think he is effective.  Sure, he is wooden, but isn't that what his
character is like?  The moment when he touches the glass separating
Henstridge from him was extremely well done, due to the couple's acting.
SPECIES II is rated R for strong sexuality, sci-fi violence/gore and
language.  This is definitely an R rated film that young kids should not
see.  More than likely, they would probably have nightmares and never
have sex for the rest of their lives.  Hell, I don't even know if I
will.  What is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be
the surprise film of the year.  I probably won't see another film where
I was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while.  Director
Peter Medak has crafted a very suspenseful, and sometimes very scary
movie out of a mediocre series.  Medak has also mastered the wonderful
"Jump!" moments, and has probably the second scariest moment I have ever
seen on film (SCREAM still has the first).  Strong acting, smart
dialogue, intelligent plotting, and a sure-handed director, SPECIES II
is exactly what these films should be: entertaining.

CAPSULE: MONEY TRAIN has been displaced; SPECIES II is the worst movie ever
made by a major studio.
You'll notice that there's a "minus" sign in front of my one-star rating of
SPECIES II. This is deliberate: normally, the lowest I go for any movie is
"no stars", meaning that I was not only unentertained, but offended as well.
Minus-one stars, then, goes even lower than that. SPECIES II is the most
offensive movie -- morally and aesthetically -- ever made by a big-name
studio. Period. It's a sequel, I guess, to the dumb ALIEN ripoff of a few
years back that had one twist: we got a sexy *female* alien, who transformed
into a very unsexy puddle of chow mein when she got horny. This movie doesn't
even have a new element to bring to the mix. It's a geek show.
There is one scene in SPECIES II that is the core of my disgust with the
film. It consists of two creatures that we have seen represented as humans,
transformed into aliens. One of them -- the "male" -- attacks the "female" in
a very specifically sexual way, raping her orally. It's impossible to
interpret what happens as anything else. I am astonished that even an R-rated
film could contain a revoltingly explicit depiction, however metaphorical, of
oral rape -- and with no point to it except to give us trashy shock. But
there it is.
When the film isn't being disgusting, it's boring. Its plot, what little I
could find of it, centers around astronauts returning from Mars infected with
the same alien DNA that spawned the first movie's "Sil". One of them mutates,
mates like mad, learns that there's a female alien on Earth somewhere, runs
amuck. I am not leaving out much, nor am I trying to.
The director of his garbage, incredibly, is Peter Medak. Medak is a good
filmmaker, and you will never know that from watching this movie. Medak has
directed LET HIM HAVE IT, ROMEO IS BLEEDING, and THE KRAYS, all of which were
above-average movies about crime and violence. SPECIES II seems to have been
done entirely on autopilot, which is a shame, because if he'd bothered to
take the material into hand, he could have reworked it into something less
purposelessly nauseating and vile.
A friend brought up a comparison that's worth mentioning here. The Japanese
animated sex-and-apocalypse epic LEGEND OF THE OVERFIEND is wall-to-wall with
scenes like the one I described above, and worse. But it is nowhere nearly as
hateful as SPECIES II is. As disgusting and repellent as LEGEND OF THE
OVERFIEND was, it at least had a degree of internal consistency and ferocious
energy. SPECIES II doesn't even classify as a beer movie (not unless you feel
like cleaning beer-vomit off the couch). It isn't interesting, original,
watchable, fearsome, thought-provoking *or* entertaining. It's an all-new
cinematic low.
Congratulations, guys. You're my new basement tenants.

     Just when we Science Fiction authors and fans thought that
we were finally making headway in Hollywood with such films as
the grossly underrated _The Postman_, the Hugo Award winning
_Contact_ and the excellent _Dark City_, there comes a film that
shows us where we stand.  _Species II_ is one of those films.
     Even watching it on pan-and-scan video (a rare occurrence
for me, but a friend picked it out), I came out feeling insulted
and dirty.  You see, not only am I a Speculative Fiction writer
(albeit unpublished, but that will change soon), but I also
consider myself an intelligent part of the human race.
     _Species II_ was simply awful.  However, in a Hollywood
which just doesn't understand SF (and to realize the full extent
of this misunderstanding, read Harlan Ellison's 1974 article
_Somehow, I Don't Think We're in Kansas, Toto_), awful is
somewhat forgivable.  However, _Species II_ is more than just
awful.  It is awful and blatantly misogynistic.
     Perhaps the best example to represent the entire film is the
first scene with Natasha Hendridge.  She plays Eve, a more docile
version of Sil from the first movie.  And, the first time the
audience sees her, she is strapped naked into a chair, being
lowered into a vat of corrosive gasses.  This is later described
by a general as "accommodations fit for a queen".
     And it only gets worse.  The plot, like in the first film,
is virtually nonexistent.  The first manned mission to Mars
returns, and two of the three astronauts (one male, one female)
are contaminated by a soil sample which takes over their DNA. 
This soil sample, by the way, contains alien DNA which comes to
life after accidentally thawing, having been dead for millions of
years (huh?!).
     They return to Earth, and are then put into a sexual
quarantine for 10 days (that's right; diseases don't bother the
powers that be, but they can't let their astronauts have sex). 
Even before this is over, the male astronaut goes on a rampage of
sex and violence befitting a bad slasher porn movie.  Every time
he couples, his mate immediately begins to swell and have a fully
developed eight-year-old burst out of her belly.  And just to
make sure we haven't missed the point, the corpses are often
shown in all their gory detail.  Also, the female half-alien
astronaut, predictably, dies in the same fashion (after all,
she's a woman and she has sex; can't let her live in this movie).
     Soon this trail of corpses is noticed, and Michael Madson's
character joins the biologist from the first film (who, by the
way, apparently has had a 180 degree change in her
characteristics) in trying to hunt down this sexual predator. 
The audience is then subjugated to a bunch of inconsistent
characterizations, stupid ideas (such as re-activating Eve's
alien attributes), and generally poor plot.  Not to mention
idiotic science and generally unexplainable events (two examples:
a researcher gets killed by a blood puddle for no apparent
reason, and a soil sample thaws spontaneously itself without
anybody noticing).
     And, to make matters worse, the film ends in such a way that
there will definitely be a sequel.  So, what begins with
scientific stupidity and poor plotting, ends without actually
wrapping anything up.
     All in all, _Species II_ was an offensive and unintelligent
film.  But I can say one good thing about it: it was better than
_Plan 9 From Outer Space_.  But not by much.
     So, the final score: 0/5; absolutely nothing redeemable
about this one.
