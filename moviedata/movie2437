     SEMPRE XONXA is the first feature film to come from Galicia (the
north westerly Atlantic province of Spain).  Set in the beautiful
scenery of that area it tells the story of a relationship between one
woman, Xonxa (Uxia Blanco) and two men, Pancho and Biratus (Miguel
Insua and Xavier R Lourido).  It is a story of love, honour and
betrayal: a very familiar latin theme.
     Yet it is not only a love story.  It also explores ideas of
cultural change and the conflict between the traditional and the
modern.  The village may be isolated from the rest of the world, but
not immune from its influence.  When Biratus returns from the Americas
a self made millionaire he is easily able to accept the established
order of things.  But will his influence last?
     Stealing the show is village ironsmith, **** (******) whose
madcap inventions and visions animate village life as well as the
movie, bringing a touch of magical realism to the film which will be
familiar to fans of Gabriel Marquez.   Although long (at almost two
hours), it is an altogether enjoyable move, which presents a very
different facet of Spanish film to the more familiar, and wholly
urban, works of Pedro Almovadar.  One of the highlights of the
festival.
