There's a fledgling subgenre out there in movie-land; for arguments'
sake, let's call it the "mainstream postmodern ironic suburban hitman
comedy."  On its good days it brings you your Get Shorty's and your
Grosse Pointe Blank's; and on it's off days, well, you end up with
Mickey Blue Eyes.  The Whole Nine Yards lies somewhere in the middle
ground - it's a movie that has all the right elements waiting on the
sidelines, but suffers from having a central character that simply
can't bring everything together.
Matthew Perry plays Nick Oseransky (if he had friends they'd call him
"Oz"), the charming loser dentist.  He lives in Montreal with his wife
Sophie (Rosanna Arquette, sporting an obnoxious accent, and tapping
into the old comedic standby that Americans just don't like those
snotty French people) and her mother; it's clear that these women
despise him and wish death upon him, and that poor Oz is driven to the
brink of insanity by them, but, dammit, they're all he's got.  And
that sentence about as detailed as what we're told in the movie - the
one- minute, one-dimensional setup of these folks' relationship is
really all we get.
When the notorious Chicago hitman Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski moves in
next door, Nick's world is, of course, set on its ear.  Nick
recognizes Jimmy instantly, and, since Nick also happens to hail from
the Windy City himself, he knows Jimmy The Tulip's entire kill record
and courtroom history.  He also knows that the Gogolack crime family
back in Chicago has Jimmy on their hit list.  His wife Sophie,
money-hungry leech that she is, decides that Nick should take a plane
to Chicago and let the Gogolacks know about Jimmy's whereabouts,
hoping there's some sort of finder's fee.  Nick, spineless wimp that
he is, agrees to go along with her plan, and, of course, he gets
caught in the middle up in a mini-mobster war of sorts.  It's a silly
and contrived sitcom setup, granted, but the plot in this kind of film
is secondary; it really only needs to serve as a showcase for its
quirky and off-center characters.
But alas, The Whole Nine Yards doesn't have a whole lot to offer in
the character department - except for a few of the more minor roles,
there's just not a whole lot of quirky goin' around.  Let's take a
look at the lineup of the usual suspects, in order from least to most
appealing...
# 1 - "The Hitman's Wife" aka Cynthia aka Natasha Henstridge - She
plays Jimmy The Tulip's unhappy and uninteresting wife, and seems
genuinely surprised that a man who's killed 17 people turned out to be
a bad husband.  What doesn't seem genuine, however, is the romance
that quickly flares up between herself and Nick the Dentist.  She's
also the lucky contestant that gets to utter the inevitable line that
includes and poorly explains the movie's title.
# 2 - "The Dentist" aka Nick "Oz" Oseransky aka Matthew Perry - The
movie's fatal structural weakness.  A central character needs to be
able to hold a film together, and Nick just doesn't have what it
takes.  It's not Perry's fault that Oz is an uninteresting and only
occasionally funny guy...  He trips over couches, runs into lamps, and
stutters with the best of them, but the script makes the mistake of
filtering too much through his boring and unoriginal eyes.
# 3 -" The Hitman With a Heart of Gold" aka Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski
aka Bruce Willis - Here Willis plays the fundamentally good-hearted
contract killer with the skewed view of the world that makes Nick the
Dentist roll his eyes and do spit takes.  The Whole Nine Yards
features Bruce Willis in "Acting Mode 2."  These are the movies he
does to make up for the pay cuts he takes to be in good films like 12
Monkeys and Pulp Fiction, and if that's what he has to do, then that's
all right by me.  He delivers a perfectly acceptable performance that
he could have easily just phoned in, but at least it looks like he was
having fun.
# 4 - "The Ving Rhames" aka Frankie Figs aka Michael Clarke Duncan -
If Duncan, who was the heart and soul of The Green Mile, is trying to
differentiate himself from Ving Rhames, then this is the wrong way to
go about it.  Here he plays another hitman with hidden and shifting
motives.  He shows the same kind charisma he did as The Green Mile's
John Coffey and gets some genuine smiles, but his ultimate fate seems
remarkably unfitting.
# 5 - "The Boss" aka Yanni Gogolack aka Kevin Pollak - The boss of the
Hungarian Gogolack crime family who wants to see Jimmy dead.  Most of
his laughs come from his indescribably goofy accent - a humorous and
well-practiced blend of Michael Corleone and Bela Lugosi - and the
bizarre non-words that come out of his mouth as a result.
# 6 - "The Apprentice" aka Jill aka Amanda Peet - This overly
enthusiastic protege of Jimmy the Tulip is the movie's clear standout.
She projects the same brand of believable nonchalance toward her
chosen profession as John Cusack's character in Grosse Pointe Blank.
I couldn't help but smile whenever she was on the screen.  And
unfortunately for The Whole Nine Yards, I couldn't help but wish I was
watching Grosse Pointe Blank instead.

  When you hear that a movie with the title "The Whole Nine
Yards" is about a dentist in suburban Montreal, you may
figure that it's about floss, not football, and you would be
partially correct.  Jonathan Lynn's concept is mostly about the
friendship between two unlikely fellows, a wimpy DDS with a
practice in suburban Montreal and a hit man seeking to hide
out from a gangster intent on eliminating him.  Mitchell
Kapner's screenplay has quite a few belly laughs as any
decent sitcom would, but not only covers no new ground in its
satire of uptight professionals and uncannily relaxed mobsters
but is occasionally meanspirited, obvious to a fault, and
performed by a troupe that seem to be putting on a show for
their parents in a junior high auditorium.  Filled with pratfalls,
dopey facial expressions, and a mindless plot featuring comic
betrayals and outrageously cartoonish characters, "The
Whole Yards" displays a cast of actors who are either the
only ones in town having a good time or just plain
embarrassed to be going through these antics.
   Bruce Willis takes a step back in a career that has seen
him move toward deeper, more serious capacities: from a
popular but stereotyped role in the "Die Hard" series to the
more serious "12 Monkeys," "The Sixth Sense" and an
unusually distinctive role as Dwayne Hoover in Alan
Rudolph's absorbing, if commercial untenable, "Breakfast of
Champions."  This time around, Willis is Jimmy "The Tulip"
Tudeski, a hit man who has had his sentence reduced by
turning a dime on a brutal Chicago-based gang led by Janni
Gogolak--who is just one of the many people wanting to see
others dead.  As his perfect foil, Matthew Perry spends a
minimal amount of time in his office practicing dentistry as
"Oz" Oseransky--a buttoned-down, regular guy who is so
naive that he has been lured into marrying the sexy but
awfully mean Sophie (Rosanna Arquette).  Sophie is not
simply a gold digger but a woman bored to tears by her
insipid husband and is, herself, in the market for someone to
do a contract killing for her.  
   In a story that's as worn as the enamel on a bruxist's teeth
and witty as a root canal job, the hapless Oz, saddled with a
vicious mother-in-law, a castrating wife and a minimum of
patients, is shocked to discover that his new next door
neighbor is actually a contract killer.  Jimmy, who is ultra-
relaxed and sophisticated, takes an immediate liking to the
nervous and decidedly unhip neighbor, which goes a long
way toward explaining why Oz seems the only one whose life
is not in danger. Oz finds himself in the middle of a plot by
Janni Gogolak (Kevin Pollak) to find the stool pigeon with his
own help: he cannot be blamed for wondering who is really
allied with whom, for things are not what they seem.  Frankie
Figs (Michael Clarke Duncan), an enormous gangster,
appears to be allied with Gogolak but in reality is not.  Oz's
assistant in the office, Jill (Amanda Peet), treats her boss like
an equal, urging him to go to Chicago, have a good time and
"get laid."  But she is not what she seems either, and in the
picture's comic high point is shown to be a great admirer of
the career of Jimmy Tudeski, eager to apprentice herself to
him as a hit person.  And Jimmy's wife Cynthia (Natasha
Henstridge) comes across as a cool, cosmopolitan number
but is actually petrified of her husband who, she believes, is
intent on killing her.
   For all we know, there could be youngsters of high-school
age who will take this PG-13 feature seriously, particularly the
casual attitude that the criminals have about serial killing. 
The whole murder incorporated enterprise comes across as
nothing more serious than a chess game in which the goal is
to checkmate your opponent painlessly before he can do you. 
This outlook is never clearer than what we see in the
character of aspiring hit woman Jill, a gorgeous receptionist
you'd least likely expect to have larceny in her heart, who
appears turned on as never before in her life when in the
presence of her hero--who has already killed seventeen
people is on the way to duplicating that achievement.
   While the picture is destined to take in solid box office
because of the guaranteed draw of Bruce Willis and to some
extent the following that Matthew Perry has gained from his
role in the TV series "Friends," this film is nothing more than
standard lowbrow fare featuring a little bathroom humor, lots
of pratfalls, and an awfully silly army of hackneyed bumblers,
plotters, wimps and Jezebels.
Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 101 minutes.  (C) 2000

Reviewed by Dustin Putman, February 19, 2000.
The characters in Jonathan Lynn's "The Whole Nine Yards," yet another in an 
endless recent string of mob comedies (1999's "Analyze This" and "Mickey Blue 
Eyes," 2000's "Gun Shy"), are rarely ever written as real people, but merely 
as one-dimensional caricatures. When an added layer to one of their 
personalities is revealed, it is not to service the character development, or 
to naturally offer up instinctive characterizations, but to accommodate the 
convoluted plot. 
In a lightweight comedy, you might say, it is not required to have perfectly 
realized figures, just as long as they get the job done. Unfortunately, for a 
comedy to work, it has to at least succeed at being funny, and if there was a 
laugh-o-meter available, I'd guess that it briefly ascended around 2.5% of 
the time for me. Suffice to say, the comedy in "The Whole Nine Yards" works 
about as well as the broken-down lawnmower in my backyard, and when a giggle 
surprisingly arises every twenty to thirty minutes, it is by sheer luck.
Nicholas "Oz" Oseransky (Matthew Perry) is an amateur dentist living in the 
quiet suburbs of Quebec. Trapped in a hateful marriage with the conniving 
Sophie (Rosanna Arquette, delightfully hamming it up with a clearly 
artificial French-Canadian accent), one day Oz sees that someone is moving 
into the house next-door. Walking over to greet him, he is horrified to 
discover it is Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski (Bruce Willis), a former contract 
killer for the Mafia who has just been released from prison. Once getting to 
know him and becoming his friend, Oz is more comfortable with his identity, 
but for Sophie, it means a possible hitman to do away with Oz. 
In her scheme, Sophie sends Oz to Chicago to cash in by informing his old mob 
boss (Kevin Pollak) about Jimmy's whereabouts, but in the process, he falls 
in love with Jimmy's wife, Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge), who is being held 
hostage. Upon return to Quebec, and with one contrivance after the next, Oz's 
dental assistant, Jill (Amanda Peet), is overjoyed to discover that he lives 
beside "The Tulip," and forces him to set up a meeting, since Jill's dream in 
life turns out being a contract killer herself.
Have you got all that? Because there is more. Much, much more. And this is a 
movie that, without credits, is little over 90 minutes and feels only like an 
hour. "The Whole Nine Yards" is an ultimately unsatisfying and empty-headed 
excursion into well-worn terrain already set by far superior pictures. How 
the cast, most of which are respectable actors, got caught up in such a 
cliched, deficient film remains a mystery, unless they thought it might 
aspire to match the congenial screwball zaniness of director Lynn's 1985 
comedy classic, "Clue: The Movie." Going into the theater, preliminary 
comparisons between the two movies were unavoidable, but by the twenty-minute 
mark, when I had chuckled once and laughed nary a single time, it was clear 
this production was in serious trouble.
Since the entire running time depends on the mechanisms of the plot, and the 
screenplay, inauspiciously written by Mitchell Kapner, collapses with every 
failing "comedy" bit, the film is an inevitable dead zone in the way of 
substance and, frequently, entertainment value. "The Whole Nine Yards" is 
neither facetious nor, aside from the subplot about Jill's shocking eagerness 
to become a professional hitwoman, inventive, and more often than not, just 
lies there, the film spinning drearily around and around in the projector, 
but never igniting any sort of spark.
A few select actors do what they can with the material, while others make no 
impact at all. On the mediocre side are actually those playing the two 
central characters: Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis. Perry, innocuously 
enjoyable on TV's "Friends," plays the same exact sitcom-style character in 
all of his movies (from 1997's "Fools Rush In" to 1999's "Three to Tango"), 
and it has become a crushing bore. Meanwhile, Willis makes next to no 
impression, and because of the limited guise of his Jimmy "The Tulip" 
Tudeski, oftentimes disappears into the background.
Their three female counterparts fare noticeably better. Best of all is 
Natasha Henstridge, far more radiant than in the exploitative "Species" 
movies, who adds unanticipated depth and emotion to Cynthia. Henstridge has 
the talent, for sure, to break out of these countless throwaway roles, but 
first she must fire her agent. Amanda Peet has a lot of fun as the quirkily 
straightforward and giddy Jill, and seems to know more about the art of 
comedic payoff than even Perry who, thus far, has strived on a career based 
solely on comedy. It is too bad, then, that Peet is unnecessarily asked to 
disrobe in a climactic scene, with the obvious sole purpose being to show off 
her breasts. Finally, Rosanna Arquette is awful as Sophie, but something 
tells me that was her purpose, and her clear overacting only aids in 
brightening up her limited screen time. Also popping up is Michael Clarke 
Duncan, fresh off an Oscar nomination for his role in "The Green Mile," as 
Jimmy's largely built friend and fellow killer, Frankie Figs.
When "The Whole Nine Yards" eventually sputters to its underwhelming 
conclusion, one is left pondering how such a film ever got greenlit. A great 
deal of movies of this type have been made in the past, and this one is 
nothing but a duplication of better films, so what was the point? Without a 
passable screenplay or any notable technical accomplishments, "The Whole Nine 
Yards" rests solely on the presumed charm of the cast, and half of the actors 
are not charming at all. Now, what does that tell you?

It's easy to make a bad movie look good in a trailer: Arrange a couple of 
moments into a fast-paced rhythm, stick a nice song on the soundtrack, and 
overlay some snappy lines. Recently, though, some wonderful movies have been 
getting sloppy treatment in the ads -- think of "Three Kings" and "The Green 
Mile", and now "The Whole Nine Yards". The studios must have pissed off their 
publicists something awful.
The commercials for "The Whole Nine Yards" make it look like a completely 
inane buddy comedy, full of people goofily shouting and bumping into doors. 
It's actually a much more skilful and witty picture; even Matthew Perry, an 
actor I previously hated, impressed me with his performance. In the 
television show "Friends" he scrunches his face, raises his voice, and always 
seems to be asking a question. Here, his voice is slower and calmer, and he 
plays a more likeable man, with reasonable worries and desires.
His name is Oz, a Chicago dentist living in Toronto because his bloodsucking 
French-Canadian wife Sophie (Rosanna Arquette) refuses to move. In next door 
moves Jimmy (Bruce Willis), who Oz recognises as an infamous Mafia hitman 
from back home. Sophie discovers that some of Jimmy's old gangster pals have 
a contract out on his life, and tries to get Oz to turn him in and collect a 
reward.
Oz travels to Chicago just to humour her and get a break, and even though he 
has no intention of actually getting involved with any criminals, they 
somehow know he has information, and are on his back as soon as he steps off 
the plane. Our hero's life gets complicated from here on in, and so does the 
movie's plot --Oz just wants to keep his head above water, but both the 
groups of enemies are using him as a pawn, he's fallen in love with Jimmy's 
wife, and his secretary Jill (Amanda Peet) wants to jump in and become a 
contract killer herself.
The story is violent, and features a lot of complex plotting and 
double-crossing, but it's sweet, enjoyable and easy to follow because the 
director, Jonathan Lynn, sets such an easy-going tone, and there's a cute 
central friendship between Oz, Jimmy and Jill. Perry, as I've already 
mentioned, performs in an uncharacteristically grounded manner; and Bruce 
Willis is an actor who always seems calm and self-assured, even when 
buildings are falling down around him. By simply adding a grin to this, he 
gives Jimmy an amusingly devious authority. And Amanda Peet, as the secretary 
who gets excited and giggly from the most perverse and macabre of things, 
gives off wonderful vibes of silly energy.
It was also a wise decision to set the movie in Toronto. American light 
comedy movies are normally set in stunningly clean and stylish versions of 
big US cities, and the unusual location makes Lynn pay attention to the 
surroundings, and use them to add texture to his picture. He was in the same 
position when he made the Alabaman "My Cousin Vinny" (1992), which is one of 
my favourite films. "The Whole Nine Yards" is not its equal, but it's a lot 
better than you'd expect from those damned trailers.

     Somewhere along the line, mobsters became fair game for
comedies.  "Analyze This," about a mafioso in psychotherapy, and "Gun
Shy," a romantic comedy focusing on a police officer pursuing the
mob, both had funny previews.  I haven't seen either movie (in fact,
"Gun Shy" hasn't been released yet), but, like them, "The Whole Nine
Yards" had amusing previews--unfortunately, "The Whole Nine Yards"
isn't as good as its advertising.
     Nicholas "Oz" Oseransky (Matthew Perry) is an unsuccessful
dentist and a henpecked husband.  His wife, Sophie (Rosanna Arquette)
dragged him back to her native Montreal and berates him for not
making enough money.  Then, when he comes home from work one day, he
meets his new neighbor.  He soon realizes his new neighbor is Jimmy
"The Tulip" Tudeski (Bruce Willis), an ex-hitman hiding from mobster
Yanni Gogolack (Kevin Pollack).  Just when Oz starts to build a tense
friendship with Jimmy, his wife puts him on a plane to Chicago so he
can tip off the mob and collect the bounty on Tudeski's head.  Oz
plans to meet with a friend in Chicago, maybe have an affair, and,
above all, avoid any contact with the mob; but when he finds hitman
Frankie Figs (Michael Clarke Duncan) in his hotel room, his plans
soon change.
     "The Whole Nine Yards" doesn't quite know whether it wants to be
a comedy or a crime movie--and fails twice as a result.  It's amusing
when Oz first realizes who his new neighbor is--and instantly goes
from a slight feeling of deja vu to sheer terror.  What's funny for
two minutes begins to get annoying after an hour.  The problem is
that the movie takes all the mob activities perfectly seriously, and
relies on Oz's awkwardness around the criminals as the sole source of
jokes.  We have mob enforcers planning to kill each other, and only
one poor schmuck tripping over himself and drinking himself blind in
the background as a distraction.  This gives the audience a few funny
moments, such as when Oz runs into a glass door, or when Jimmy throws
Oz a beer--and the stunned Oz doesn't even try to catch it.  Most
straight crime-dramas are funnier and much less tedious, than "The
Whole Nine Yards."
     The movie also strains credibility in several places.  For
instance, why does Oz stay with his shrew of a wife?  When she and
her mother are ruining his personal, professional, and financial
lives, how could the disastrous divorce settlement he fears possibly
be worse?  It's not love--putting aside their mutual acrimony, while
he's in Chicago, Oz falls in love with another woman; of course, the
awkward protagonist falling in love with the worst possible woman at
the worst possible time, with no explanation other than the fact that
the woman in question was there and vaguely disliked him (old
romantic comedy technique--if you hate someone, it's true love),
doesn't exactly help the film's credibility either.  Neither does the
fact that his lover--who nearly everyone else in the film has a
reason to kill--is still alive despite her frequent contact with
mobsters.  It might be one thing if the non sequiturs were funny, but
they're not jokes; they're just careless writing.
     The movie isn't a total loss.  There are a few funny moments.
Bruce Willis delivers a strong performance; his character isn't as
complex as Dr. Crowe from "The Sixth Sense" (or even Harry Stamper
from "Armageddon"), but, there's something to an actor who can make a
mob hitman likeable.  Similarly, Michael Clarke Duncan is also
charming (though at this point, I'm not sure what it says when a
movie's only likeable characters are mass murderers).
     While "The Whole Nine Yards" may try to appear kinder and
gentler than your average crime movie, don't let that fool you.
There are several on-screen murders, plenty of strong language, a
fairly strong sex scene, and full frontal nudity.
     Apparently, the expression "the whole nine yards" comes from
World War II machine gunners' ammunition belts being nine yards
long--"the whole nine yards" meant that you shot off all you could
without reloading.  In contrast, while the title phrase may tell of a
lot of ammunition, the movie "The Whole Nine Yards" itself fires
blanks.

WHOLE NINE YARDS, THE (director: Jonathan Lynn; screenwriter: Mitchell
Kapner; cinematographer: David Franco; editor: Tom Lewis; cast: Bruce
Willis (Jimmy
Tudeski), Matthew Perry (Oz Oseransky), Rosanna Arquette (Sophie),
Michael Clarke Duncan (Frankie Figs), Natasha Henstridge (Cynthia),
Amanda Peet (Jill), Kevin Pollak (Janni Gogolak), 2000)
What can I say about a film that was laugh-out-loud funny in spots, was
driven by a fantastic performance by Bruce Willis as a contract killer,
but was disturbingly vulgar (the murder of an undercover cop is used as
part of the comedy routine), except to say that it was driven by
characters who seem to enjoy their work and working with each other. It
was also a more palatable of a film than I thought it would be. These
demented zany characters, not one of them who was without a blemished
soul (reminiscent of Pulp Fiction and Analyze This), is a popular
reworking of the gangster film into comedy, a phenomena of recent times
worth taking note of in the gangster genre. The result is a film that
gets over, more or less, as a parody. A film that is farcical and loopy,
but leaves a lot to be desired. It still looks likes like a sitcom to
me.
The plot starts off simple and then becomes more complicated as more
characters are introduced. Oz Oseransky (Matthew Perry) is a hapless
dentist living in Montreal with his harridan French-Canadian wife,
Sophie (Rosanna Arquette), whose main asset seems to be her large boobs.
She also amusingly struggles with an improbable French-Canadian accent.
They have been living together for seven unhappy years, after her
father, a dentist whose partner was Oz, embezzled funds and committed
suicide, sticking Oz with the debt. She is disappointed that the likable
Oz can't make a good living out of his practice. So she hires a hit man,
or in this case a hit woman (Oz's new assistant Jill (Amanda), whose
role model is Jimmy the Tulip), to whack him to collect on his
life-insurance policy. But as coincidence would have it, Jimmy "The
Tulip" Tudeski (Willis), a contract killer who killed 17 for a Hungarian
crime family in Chicago, the Gogolak Gang, becomes Oz's next-door
neighbor, in this middle-class suburban Montreal area. Jimmy got away
with just five years in prison after ratting out the gang's leader. He
has refused to go into the witness protection program. We first see him
confidently grinning, as his stammering neighbor introduces himself. The
trembling Oz recognizes who his neighbor is and the two start a
friendship which will be tested many times for how strong its loyalty
is.
Sophie talks Oz into giving Jimmy's location away to Jimmy's old mob
boss, Janni (Kevin Pollak). In return she will grant him a divorce. So
off to Chi town goes Oz, but who should meet him in his hotel room, but
a mammoth black man, about the size of the Sears Tower, Frankie Figs
(Duncan). He tells him he works for Janni and after punching the dentist
around offering some more excuses for sight gags and pratfalls, he
brings him to see Janni. The conversation from the heavily accented
Janni goes something like this, "I yust hate Yimmy. I vill kill the
wermin." Oz is then introduced to Jimmy's luscious wife Cynthia (Natasha
Henstridge) and is immediately attracted to her. What transpires is a
series of double and triple-crosses involving $10 million in cash, with
everyone except the dentist wanting someone whacked.
The British born director Jonathan Lynn (My Cousin Vinny), after a
so-far mediocre career, has become more skilled at pacing a film, as the
non-stop action scenes make the film fly by quickly, which might
actually be its best asset. This is lighweight entertainment and should
work well if one chooses to overlook a flawed script, questionable
values, and that there are no nice people in the film. Don't tell me the
dentist is a good guy, there should be no doubt about his character,
after he conspires with the contract killer to hide a series of murders!
But...the film is funny.

The journey from TV to movie stardom has not been smooth for Matthew
Perry. As the wisecracking Chandler Bing on "Friends," Perry comes off
as the smartest and most edgy of the ensemble cast. But in his previous
big screen starring efforts ("Fools Rush In," "Three To Tango" and the
dreadful "Almost Heroes"), Perry's charisma dissipated on celluloid.
Although playing variations of his television persona, he seemed oddly
bleached out  effete and bland, almost wispy.
In "The Whole Nine Yards," Perry finally appears to have found his
cinematic footing. As dentist, bedraggled husband and put upon good guy
Nicholas "Oz" Oseransky, he displays a sense of backbone  tenuous at
first, but stronger as the film goes on  that gives his one-liners and
pratfalls more oomph.
Of course, it helps that Oz is one of only two decent human beings in
this dark comedy. Surrounded by amiable hitmen who whack their own
friends as casually as one would swat a fly, he provides a welcome moral
center that makes the overwhelming nihilism of the story tolerable. As
in the classic "Arsenic and Old Lace," lovable killers can be a lot of
fun, provided you have at least one character that fully recognizes that
what they are doing is wrong.
Indeed, Oz spends most of the movie surrounded by people doing wrong.
While enduring the constant disdain of his dour bride, Sophie (Patricia
Arquette), he recognizes his new neighbor as Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski
(Bruce Willis), a contract killer recently sprung from prison after
ratting out his former gangland employers. Refusing the witness
protection program despite the fact that there is a price on his head,
Tudeski maintains an assured, cheerful attitude while sharing his
peculiar outlook on life to Oz. "It's not important how many people I've
killed," he explains pleasantly, "What's important is how I get along
with the people that are still alive."
I won't recount the elaborate plotting of Mitchell Kapner's screenplay.
Suffice to say that Oz, badgered by his wife into making a very bad
decision, quickly finds himself up to his ears in trouble, with any
number of people out to kill him. Questionable allegiances, along with
double and triple crossings, make up the bulk of "The Whole Nine Yards,"
providing a surprising amount of snappy entertainment. While humor
periodically takes a backseat to the mechanics of the elaborate farce,
the production never loses steam.
Savvy casting is key to the success of the film. Bruce Willis hits the
right notes as Tudeski, blending a congenial nature with a strong sense
of menace. Willis works beautifully with Perry, building an affectionate
relationship with his new neighbor, while making it clear that he'll
kill him in a heartbeat if need be. Michael Clarke Duncan, fresh from
his breakout role as the gentle giant in "The Green Mile," is wonderful
as a suave Chicago hitman, and Amanda Peet steals the show as Jill, a
perky dental assistant with unusual career aspirations.
Other performers fare less well, mostly because of accents. Kevin
Pollack, playing a gangland boss, affects a weird speech impediment that
wears thin fast and Patricia Arquette, as the unrelenting harridan, uses
a French accent that wouldn't pass muster in a high school play.
Director Jonathan Lynn does hit and miss work here. While he handles his
lead actors with skill, he has problems behind the camera. To his
credit, he moved the story setting from Miami to Montreal, choosing not
to do the usual "Hey, we're filming in Canada to save money, but lets
pretend it's a U.S. city" nonsense. But man, does he make Montreal look
industrial and dreary. Lynn also overuses close-ups and awkward camera
angles. Luckily, Randy Edelman's jazzy score makes the technical
glitches easier to take.
In a winter that has offered a numbing string of lousy movies, "The
Whole Nine Yards" is a zippy, nasty little change of pace. And for
Matthew Perry, it offers evidence that there may be life beyond
"Friends" after all.

Three out of four ex-girlfriends would have sent murderous stares my way
after watching The Whole Nine Yards, to which I would have calmly
replied, "Hey, I sit through Ralph Fiennes flix for you . . ." (you can
figure out who the RF equivalent was fifteen years back. My brain
doesn't work that good).
At least, at the screening I attended, all the laughter came from the
guys. All the bewildered looks, on the way out, came from the ladies.
For this flick is a another sort of comedic spin off a mob movie genre,
with Bruce Willis parading that sort of smirk that passes for a smile
when he tries to be funny. Don't mistake me, he is funny . . . in a sort
of straight man way opposite co-star Matthew Perry (of teevee's
Friends), who pratfalls and double-takes his way through all the best
gags.
Make no mistake, this is a funny movie in which almost every character
wants another character dead. Sometimes more than one. Everyone, that
is, except for Perry, who spends most of his time trying to figure out
how to keep the killing from happening. Without giving too much of a
convoluted story away, these are the players:
Jimmy Jones aka Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski (Willis), a contract killer
who has just settled into a suburban Montreal home. Tudeski is on the
run from Chicago mob boss Janni Gogolak (Kevin Pollak), Gogolak's
enforcer Frankie Figs (Michael Clarke Duncan). His neighbor is a Chicago
born dentist, Nicholas "Oz" Oseransky (Perry) and his Canadien born wife
Sophie (Rosanna Arquette). Sophie is, to be kind, a bitch who won't give
her husband a divorce until she bleeds him dry.
Oz recognizes the hitman. The wife packs him off to Chicago to find the
mobster and arrange a "finder's fee" for turning The Tulip over. Oz has
no intention of tracking down Gogolak but, through circumstances
unknown, Gogolak finds him.
Which brings us to The Tulip's unhappy not-ex Cynthia (Natasha
Henstridge), a permanent "guest" on the Gogolak estate. Cynthia is
considered disposable by both her host and her hubby because, and you
know it always comes down to the money, at stake is a bank account with
$10 millions in it. Finally, there's Oz' cute and perky receptionist
Jill (Amanda Peet) whose character offers the biggest, and funniest,
surprise of the bunch.
The Whole Nine Yards is like a kitchen sink of what's been funny before.
There are the occasional fart and other bodily function gags; a frenetic
pace and judicious nudity; some horrible accents (especially Arquette,
though her exaggeration may be part of the joke); some big surprises
from the characters -- who they really are and why they do what they do.
It is an in one ear and out the other, simple comedy. Matthew Perry's
pratfalls hold it all together and, as I wrote up top, make it work for
us guys.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to The Whole Nine Yards, he would have
paid...
Dateflick. The Whole Nine Yards is Fairly Painless in the theater and a
sure winner for beer bashes, when it hits vid.

Starring-Matthew Perry, Bruce Willis, Rosanna Arquette, Michael
Clarke Duncan, Natasha Henstridge, Amanda Peet and Kevin Pollak
Director-Johnathan Lynn
Canadian Rating-14A
In `The Whole Nine Yards', everyone is eager to whack someone else,
whether the incentive is marital difficulties or business. For Jimmy
`The Tulip' Tudeski (Bruce Willis), a hitman formerly associated with
the notorious Gogalack crime family in Chicago, it's strictly business.
After supplying the FBI with evidence against the Gogalack family and
serving his 5-year prison term, The Tulip has relocated to Montreal,
Quebec to hide out. His new neighbor, the `poor dentist' Nick Oseransky
(Matthew Perry), recognizes his mug immediately because he once
maintained a dental practice in the Windy City. And so begins `The Whole
Nine Yards', a surprisingly enjoyable farce that jettisons some of its
comedic appeal in favor of crafting a rather convoluted storyline.
For Matthew Perry, the transition from `Friends' to the big screen has
been occupied with unpleasant turbulence. Contrary to most, I somewhat
enjoyed his two critically battered romantic vehicles `Fools Rush In'
and `Three to Tango'.... but despite his perceptible charm and gifted
comic timing, the actor has carried with him a wretched box office curse
in whatever film he inhabits. Hopefully, `The Whole Nine Yards' will put
an end to that mean streak. After all, the movie stars Mr. Box Office
himself, Bruce Willis - whose career seems to have been jump-started
once again by the little supernatural thriller that could (`The Sixth
Sense'). Tack on a talented supporting cast willing to experiment with
an accent or two, and the result is a fairly perky and energetic comic
stew containing just enough clever zeal and enthusiasm to fill a 2-hour
gap quite entertainingly.
The plot will sound complicated to most, but once you get a taste of
`The Whole Nine Yards' first-hand, everything will level out in a
straightforward fashion. Once Tudeski moves in, Oseransky (or `Oz') gets
overwrought with panic. His miserly Canadian wife Sophie (Rosanna
Arquette), who has made the union of marriage hell for Oz, persuades him
to travel to Chicago and inform the Gogalack family of Tudeski's
whereabouts (the method of persuasion being that she will grant him a
divorce). But this is only the start of the intricate shenanigans, as
Jimmy's lovely wife Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge), Nick's bubbly
receptionist Jill (Amanda Peet) and behemoth underling Frankie Figs
(Michael Clarke Duncan) all get involved in the fiasco. The plot is so
convoluted that it causes you to speculate about what director Jonathan
Lynn's primary concerns were. If the layout of `The Whole Nine Yards'
was a race track, the shady mobster/hitman portion of the plot would
have lapped the humor five times over.
Fortunately, the film still has its laughs. Lynn, who has done good (`My
Cousin Vinny') and not-so-good (`Sgt. Bilko'), keeps the pace churning
at a consistent momentum, and his slick approach leaves little margin
for error. Although `The Whole Nine Yards' deals with somber dealings
like murder and double-crosses, most of the film has a light, puckery
taste to it. This agreeable flavor is largely due to the beaming
supporting cast - particularly Amanda Peet, whose terrific comic
performance lends a sense of illumination to every scene she's in.
Meanwhile, Henstridge (the babalicious alien from `Species') shows us
her surprising competence with giving a strong serious performance, and
Duncan (the Oscar-nominated actor from `The Green Mile') occupies the
character of Frankie Figs like few others could. The only general
exception is Rosanna Arquette, who is mainly just shill and grating with
the character of Sophie, and her highly inconsistent `Canadian' accent
reveals that she maybe forgot to do any research whatsoever.
The most interesting accent of the show belongs to the funny Kevin
Pollak, playing imposing (and rather unintelligent) mob boss Yanni
Gogalack, who introduces Cynthia as `Yimmy's vife'. In a way similar to
Yanni's verbal clumsiness, `The Whole Nine Yards' has its priorities in
a tangle. The script straddles two separate genres and sometimes reveals
a gaping hole of incompetence. The film itself is a bit off-centered,
but Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis know every nook and cranny of their
characters, and their one-two punch of forceful tough guy and suburban
doofus helps add to the entertainment value of the film. `The Whole Nine
Yards' is not as fulfilling as the title may suggest, but as a comedy,
it is still more leisurely than most.

STARRING:  Bruce Willis, Matthew Perry, Rosanna Arquette, Michael Clarke
Duncan, Natasha Henstridge, Amanda Peet, Kevin Pollak
DIRECTOR:  Jonathan Lynn
WRITTEN BY:  Mitchell Kapner
As creator of the British TV series "Yes, Minister" and the
writer/director of movie comedies like Clue, Nuns on the Run, and My
Cousin Vinny, Jonathan Lynn isn't lacking in the offbeat humor
department.  With The Whole Nine Yards, he shows a considerably darker
side to his sense of what's funny; this time there are contract killers,
murder plots and double-crosses to go with the pratfalls and silly
accents that characterized earlier Lynn films.  Picture an Elmore
Leonard novel filtered through a Brit-com sensibility, and you get the
idea.  While the film begins unpromisingly, it kicks into an entirely
more satisfying gear in its second half, giving Matthew Perry the
distinction of having the best Friends cast member movie thus far.
Perry stars as Nick "Oz" Oseransky, a dentist who's distinctly unhappy
with his mooching French-Canadian wife (played with a silly accent by
Arquette) and unfulfilled life.  After recognizing his new next-door
neighbor Jimmy Jones (Willis) as notorious hit man Jimmy "The Tulip"
Tudeski, Oz is forced by his wife to go to Chicago in hopes of
collecting a reward for revealing Tudeski's whereabouts to Yanni
Gogolack (Pollak), the crime boss Tudeski sold out for a reduced
sentence.  Naturally, assorted hijinks ensue, including but not limited
to Oz's getting worked over by Gogolack's enforcer Frankie Figs (The
Green Mile's Duncan), sleeping with Tudeski's wife (Henstridge), and
finding out about a particularly large sum of money that everyone wants
to "off" everyone else for.  Oz learns that Tudeski doesn't believe in
divorce (it's a sin), but would happily kill his wife to get at the
money.  As he becomes a pawn in the schemes of everyone around him, Oz
has to figure out a way to keep the people he cares about from getting
whacked-- especially himself.
At first, laughs don't come easily.  Perry seems unsure whether to go
with his sarcastic wiseacre character on Friends or the bumbling,
in-over-his-head naďf Lynn seems to want.  Worse, he looks embarrassed
at having to perform the too-numerous pratfalls that mar the entire
movie.  Pollak, doing an even more silly accent than Arquette's, tries
to make his pronunciation of "vermin" this year's version of Joe Pesci's
"yoots" in Vinny but fails horribly.  By the second half, though, after
a few more characters have been established (particularly Jill, Oz's
dental secretary and contract killer wannabe, played with fervid
enthusiasm by Peet), the humor starts to click.  Willis' friendship with
Duncan is so patently obvious that it shines right through their line
readings, and Perry seems to relax into a much better mix of peevish
tightass and nice-guy hero.  Even the sight gags are funnier.  In the
end, everything works out in a twisted yet moralistic way that Jimmy the
Tulip would appreciate.

'The Whole Nine Yards' plays out with a series of in-jokes, no doubt many of
them planned and executed by the cast but has a few too many pratfalls for
its own good and also has, at the root of its story, a lining of old
fashioned material greed as its theme.  It tries to be many things.....a
comedy, an intriguing thriller, a mob story, a take on marriage, a depiction
of the theory about honour among criminals and last but not least, it tries
to be entertaining and earns an 'A' for effort.  Unfortunately, the film has
to throw in stereotypes and some unbelievable finishing touches in its
climax where things work out just a bit too perfectly for its own good.
Matthew Perry plays a struggling dentist from Chicago named Nicholas
Oseransky (later given the nickname Oz) living in Montreal, Canada with his
French-Canadian wife Sophie (Rosanna Arquette) and her witch of a mother and
the two of them make fun of Oz whenever they can.  They accuse him of not
being able to make money (with a large debt to pay off), despite being a
dentist, and they poke fun of him at every turn.  Needless to say, Oz's
marriage is on the rocks.  His wife and mother-in-law are painted as
materialistic and/or evil.  Oz comes across as a wimp and lives up to this
tag admirably.
Oz welcomes his new neighbour, a seemingly nice guy named Jimmy Jones (Bruce
Willis)....as he introduces himself that way to Oz.  He is in fact Jimmy
"The Tulip" Tudeski, a ruthless Chicago hit man who has killed almost 20
people in his illustrious career and Oz recognizes him from the tattoo on
his arm.  There is a funny sequence where, upon recognizing Jimmy for who he
is, Oz has a noisy flashback in his mind of newspaper articles and other
mental passages that clue him into the fact that his new neighbour is a mob
connected mass murderer.  What a predicament!  Oz later breaks the news to
his wife about who their new neighbour is and he mentions that rival crime
organizations have put a price on Jimmy's head and Sophie forces Oz,
reluctantly, by threatening to make his marriage more of a hell than it
already is, to go to Chicago and give information to Jimmy's enemies as to
his whereabouts and perhaps collect a hefty finder's fee in the process.
Upon his arrival in Chicago, Oz is greeted off guard in his hotel room by
Frankie Figs (Michael Clarke Duncan), a man who supposedly works for a mob
boss named Yanni Gogolack (Kevin Pollak), who wants Jimmy dead.  Oz can't
figure out how the mob got a hold of the information detailing his arrival
and he had no intention of ratting Jimmy out as he later tells a friend he
just came to Chicago to get away from 'the bitch'.  Oz is caught up in a
whirlwind of playing all sides against each other and falls in love along
the way with Jimmy's estranged wife Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge).  Oz's
dental assistant is named Jill (Amanda Peet) and she has a secret fantasy
about career choice that we find out about a little too late in the film
which gives the film a bitter red herring and many will find it too
preposterous to accept.
As an overlapping story of double crosses, cleverly woven plot intimacies
and character development, 'The Whole Nine Yards' works just fine but as a
superlative comedy, it stops just short and reminded me at many times of
what the Three Stooges would come off like without belting each once
throughout the course of one of their movies.  You know, the dialogue
without the slapstick finish and the ability to make an alternative form of
comedy fall flat without your trade mark finish.  No one in this movie has a
truly great trade mark for comedy and many of them are not good at comedy at
all but some of the in-jokes help.  There is a clever reference to
mayonnaise put on hamburgers used by Willis as John Travolta and Samuel L.
Jackson did in their exchange about what's put on french fries in France
instead of ketchup in 'Pulp Fiction', which of course, co-starred Willis
(and Rosanna Arquette).  Arquette seduces a policeman in this movie (Harland
Williams) in a rather shameless manner which again, just isn't funny or
totally necessary to the plot.  She wants to use him for something she can
do herself without anyone else being involved or finding out about what she
has in mind.
Director Jonathan Lynn who has done 'The Distinguished Gentleman', 'My
Cousin Vinny' and 'Greedy', lets the comedy spiral out of control at many
points and allows his cast to take a few too many liberties with the
original material written by Mitchell Kapner and turn it into amateur comedy
often seen too much in variety shows and hapless sitcoms (Perry IS from
'Friends').  Still, 'The Whole Nine Yards' runs a very acceptable 98 minutes
and all comedies should run well under two hours as most of them in this day
and age simply aren't funny and look more recycled than they do original.
Not quite the case here but then again, it is still a little too low brow
for a recommendation.
A film must receive a three star rating or higher to be eligible for a
recommendation.

I can give or take Bruce Willis; he's ok as an actor, but he generally 
doesn't come close to rockin' my movie-watchin' world.  I only know that 
Matthew Perry is on TV's "Friends" because I always flip quickly past 
that show as soon as its theme song comes on.  But the man of the "Nine 
Yards" Hour for me was Michael Clarke Duncan, who played "Frankie Figs" 
Figueroa here.  After seeing him shine so brightly in my favorite flick 
of 1999 - The Green Mile- I made it a point to catch anything he's in 
from now on, to see if "Green" was just a fluke, or if he'd always be 
typecast as the Big Black Guy (with, of course, a Heart Of Gold).  But 
I'm getting ahead of myself.
The Story (WARNING: some spoilers contained below):
-From the official web page:
   Nicholas "Oz" Oseransky (Matthew Perry) is a nice dentist
   dentist living in suburban Montreal. His new next door neighbor,
   Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski (Bruce Willis), is  a hit man hiding
   out from a dangerous Chicago crime family. Despite their 
   differences, Oz and Jimmy have one thing in common: someone's 
   trying to kill them both. For Jimmy, avoiding a couple of hired 
   killers is child's play. But for Oz, it's a whole new ball game.
   To stay alive, they're going to have to stick together - Jimmy 
   with his cunning and cold-blooded accuracy and Oz with his 
   dental tools.
The Upshot
When I found out that "Nine" had a sneak preview locally, I checked out 
its official movie site;  after I read the above description, I rolled 
my eyes, held my nose, and got my tickets.   And was pleasantly 
surprised to find out, once again, that, PR Machines often misinform and 
mislead the public about their product; that is, there's way more to The 
Whole Nine Yards than that lame description would lead you to believe.
The story started out slow (and no, I don't mean "slowly"), and ended 
with a whimper instead of a bang.  But that middle...by the time I 
finally left the theater, I had already resolved to watch it again next 
week when it's released nationwide.  The storyline was nothing to write 
home about--we've seen variations of it before--but the way it was told 
is what made this comedy work.  It had a very natural flow to it: 
something that doesn't often happen in comedies, especially not the 
sitcom variety. I found myself wondering where the time went, and almost 
surprised that it was ending so soon when it was over (and not in the 
"that's it?" way I was with Eye Of The Beholder). And if by some stretch 
of the imagination, "Nine" could technically be labelled a "sitcom", it 
wasn't like any I've seen before.  I never had a problem with suspending 
my disbelief [well, rarely, as in the case of Ms. Arquette and Mr. 
Pollak; but I'll get to that later]. I'm looking forward to going again, 
if only to catch the bits I missed the first time around.
A nice touch was the use of jazz throughout; in these days of 
"soundtracks" being really just a vehicle to promote whichever singers 
or rappers the producer happens to be in bed wi...er, like, it's 
refreshing to hear music that's actually part of the movie, rather than 
tacked on to sell CDs.  Of course, with Cynthia Biddle having gotten a 
lot of screen time in "Nine", the question is begged whether she 
was...liked...by the "Nine's" producer herself.  But no matter; I'd 
rather hear jazz that counts, than rock or rap that doesn't.
The actors and their characters, though, were the real story behind 
"Nine".  During his heyday in the "Moonlighting" TV series and Die Hard 
movies, Willis hogged the spotlight away from his co-stars; whether on 
purpose or accidently, he treated the world as if it were his very own 
personal stage.  Not so in "Nine"; here, his "Tulip" was much more 
subdued, but at the same time, (for lack of a better word) commanding.  
There's a noticeable shift partway through the movie, when Jimmy takes 
on a mean streak and the old hammy Willis starts to come to the fore, 
but that doesn't last for long, and Willis again blends in with the 
not-quite-ensemble cast.  With the caveat that I haven't yet seen The 
Sixth Sense in its entirety, I opine that "Nine" is Bruce Willis' best 
work since Die Hard (the original, of course).
Matthew Perry really surprised me; I fully expected his Oz to be a 
one-dimensional doofus, pratfalling his way across the screen only to 
speed past Go, collect his $200 Bucks, and go back to his TV show.  
Well, he did sorta-kinda, but in a charming way.  Though Oz too easily 
became "wise" about halfway through the flick, and his relationship with 
Jimmy's estranged wife Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge) worked my nerve, I 
looked past that.  Oz getting creamed by Figs, running into glass 
doors--hey, that was just plain funny.  Sue me for liking physical 
comedy; I Loved Lucy, too.
Dragging the movie down somewhat were Rosanna Arquette as Oz's screechy 
wife Sophie, Harland Williams as Buffalo Steve, a "hitter" that Sophie 
hires, and surprisingly, Kevin Pollak's Janni Gogolack, leader of the 
Chicago Hungarian mob that Jimmy ratted on (which is the reason why he 
moved to Canada in the first place).  Janni was basically a one-trick 
pony in this movie; his schtick was the way he slowly mumbled and 
"mispronounced" words in a supposedly Hungarian accent [(ObInsideJoke) 
Gee's Faffamems, it weren't]. Worth only a quick chuckle or two, it 
seemed a waste of Pollak's talents. Buffalo Steve was nothing more than 
(literally?) a stiff; though (I guess) the character was needed to 
advance the story, there was far too little explanation of what he was 
there for, to make him work.  And not to be outdone by her sister 
Patricia "Gots Ta Fix Mah Teefes" Arquette, Rosanna just made me wanna 
smack Sophie upside the head whenever she opened her mouth and out 
spilled the most phony French-Canadian accent I've ever heard.  Yeah, I 
know Sophie was supposed to be unlikable, but was Rosanna?  Still, these 
were minor quibbles, to be sure; they were distractions, but not 
detrimentally so.
There's one part of the movie that really ground my liver, though; I 
won't get into it, because it'd spoil the whole thing too much, but it 
shouldn't be hard to figure it out once you've seen it through to the 
end.  Maybe I'll open up a discussion of it on the "Viewer Voices" 
webboard after the movie opens nationwide next week.
The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
Today, Bammer's having a two-for-one special: I dish on the "Black 
Factor" and the "Female Factor".  Ain't it kewl?
So, how did Michael Clarke Duncan acquit himself?  Quite well, I 
thought.  There were no vestiges of John Coffey to be found in Duncan's 
portrayal of Frankie Figs, one of Yanni's crew, sent out to get Jimmy.  
His natural "bigness" notwithstanding, my fears of his being typecast as 
the Big Black Guy, were unfounded; unlike Coffey, Duncan didn't play 
Figs as Larger Than Life.  Yes, he's Big, and yes, he's Black--but 
neither were really The Point here (except in as much as a hitman's 
hitman needs to be foreboding to put the fear in their target).  The 
truth will out in future films, of course, but for now, Frankie Figs was 
as far as Duncan could get from John Coffey; and the good thing is, both 
John and Figs were served well by the same actor. 
As for the "Female Factor", leaving all thoughts of the Arquette sisters 
aside [gives me the hives just to think of that family.  Who says the 
Baldwin Brothers are the only sibling scourge of Hollywood?  I know I 
don't say that...but I do digress.], the FF is represented well in 
"Nine" by two actresses.  The first is Natasha Henstridge as Cynthia: a 
pretty version of Julia Roberts, Henstridge seemed to know her "place" 
in this movie was to be pretty and frustrated, and she came through 
admirably; in this, she should be able to challenge Roberts' crown as 
"Highly Paid Actress With No Real Talent".  But stealing the show was 
the fall-out funny Cynthia Peet as Jill, the Dental Assistant With A 
Twist.  Already funny when the audience thought she was "just" a 
secretary, Jill had me rollin' in almost every scene she was in, 
especially after Oz told her about "The Tulip".  Peet's enthusiam was 
contagious, and seemed to make the other actors performances go up a 
notch or two: the scenes with Jill, Oz, and Jimmy interacting, were 
great to watch--as was Cynthia and Jill's scene together.
I think I'll be following Amanda Peet around the Big Screen, too.
Bammer's Bottom Line: 
If I had to describe The Whole Nine Yards in one word, that word would 
be "fun"; the story was fun for the audience (after the slow start), and 
the cast and crew seemed to be having fun telling the story.  That's a 
rare combination in movie comedies these days, what with "comedy" being 
co-opted more and more with "drama" to make "dramadies".  Bammer sez, 
ain't nuttin' wrong with being straight (but intelligently) funny.  More 
comedies oughta try it, dig?
"The Whole Nine Yards" (rating: greenlight): 
Mark the calendar, y'all: on February 12, 2000, Bammer actually liked a 
"broad comedy".  Will wonders never cease...

Hollywood conservatives beware! The two best films of the new millennium 
aren't great dramatic narratives, heart-tugging romances or even 
intellectual studies. First The Big Tease, a lowbrow mockumentary 
cracking jokes at Scottish and homosexuals. Now The Whole Nine Yards, an 
uproarious date flick full of over-exaggerations.
"Oz" Oseransky (Matthew Perry) is a dentist, which, according to several 
sources throughout the film, makes him a likely suicide candidate. This 
isn't helped by the fact that his ex-partner, who also was his 
father-in-law, embezzled massive amounts of money before dying. Now Oz 
lives in misery with his wife Sophie (Rosanna Arquette), his 
mother-in-law (Carmen Ferlan) and a mammoth debt.
Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudesky (Bruce Willis) is a 17-times-veteran contract 
killer fresh out of the slammer thanks to a loose tongued plea-bargain. 
But Jimmy refused witness protection so he has turned to a new life in 
Canada for safety and good gardening soil (tomatoes grow quickly)- next 
door to Oz.
Janni Gogolak (Kevin Pollak) is the son of the crime-boss that Tudesky 
ratted out. He lives in Chicago with several hit-men, Tudesky's 
estranged wife (Natasha Henstridge) and a contract on Tudesky's head.
Everyone from oz's secretary to Gogolak seems to want or need someone 
dead for either revenge, money or necessity. Who are the double agents? 
Who will live? Who will die? And which one turns out to be the cop?
The Whole Nine Yards proves to be a hysterical blend of Airplane and 
Goodfellas. Of all the dark comedies over the past several years, none 
have managed to make murder as funny as it is here. Responsible for this 
phenomenon is undoubtedly the cast. Perry's innocent facial 
expressions, Willis' ability to deliver absurd lines with the utmost 
seriousness and Pollak's beautifully overacted gangster are certainly 
contributing factors. But the real treats are Michael Clarke Duncan 
(recently in The Green Mile) and Amanda Peet (recently in Isn't She 
Great) as a hit-man and secretary, respectively. Duncan, for those of 
you not familiar with him, is a huge African-American man who 
demonstrates his comedic ability with this intentionally cliched 
tough-guy character. Peet is an exceptionally attractive female with a 
knack for delivering nutty punch lines in a fashion even more impressive 
than Willis.
Another key factor in the film's success is its ability to handle 
murder in such a hysterically nonchalant manner. For every bit as 
ultra-disturbing and spine tingling as The Talented Mr. Ripley was, The 
Whole Nine Yards is boisterously entertaining. This goes to show that a 
grade-A comedy ensemble can make extraordinary light of what was equally 
serious when presented in another manner. There are actually more deaths 
in this film than Ripley and The Whole Nine Yards plays at a fraction of 
Ripley's time.
Critics will likely quip that the movie loses points at the end due to 
over-sappiness and a forced romance. I beg to differ. The Whole Nine 
Yards truly achieves its full pomp when it manages to integrate these 
"awe!" scenes with its uproarious comedy. The end result is something 
that Hollywood hasn't seen a quality version of in a long time: a 
Friday night date flick.

THE WHOLE NINE YARDS (M).  
(Warner Bros/Village Roadshow)
Director: Jonathan Lynn
Stars: Bruce Willis, Matthew Perry, Natasha Henstridge, Rosanna Arquette, 
Amanda Peet, Kevin Pollak, Michael Clarke Duncan, Harland Williams
Running time: 98 minutes.
Murder, marital discord, hit men and mercenary killers combine
to produce some unexpected belly laughs in this curiously appealing
black comedy, filmed largely in Montreal.
Nicholas "Oz" Oseransky (Friends star Matthew Perry) is an
uptight dentist increasingly stressed out by the demands of his money
hungry wife Sophie (Rosanna Arquette, with a funny accent) and his
equally mercenary mother-in-law.  The answer to their various dilemmas
arrives in the form of Jimmy Tudeski (Bruce Willis), a former mob
hitman turned informer, who moves in next door.  Learning that Jimmy
is wanted by Chicago gang boss Janni Gogolak (Kevin Pollak), Sophie
persuades Oz to go to Chicago and collect the reward money for turning
him in to the mob.  Then she informs Jimmy of her husband's actions in
the hope that he will kill him.
Events get wildly out of control when Oz meets Jimmy's
estranged wife (Natasha Henstridge, from Species, etc), and quickly
falls for her.  Meanwhile, Oz's pretty young receptionist (Amanda
Peet) turns out to be an aspiring assassin herself with a fan-like
adoration for Jimmy's past work.  With $10,000,000 at stake for the
survivors of the final confrontation, loyalty amongst killers is thin
on the ground.  While audiences may occasionally become confused with
the details of who is double crossing whom along the way, everything
is resolved neatly by the end.
The cast seem to have had a good time while making this film,
and their enjoyment is reflected in their enthusiastic performances.
Perry seems more comfortable with his role here, and turns in his best
screen performance to date.  He seems to have an affinity for the
slapstick nature of his role, and suffers the brunt of the movie's
pratfalls, walking into doors and falling off chairs, whilst
maintaining some dignity.  Willis seems to enjoy sending up his
taciturn, laconic tough screen image with this broadly comic turn as a
sensitive hit man with a complex set of moral values.  Pollak provides
some fine humour as the crude gangster whose biggest crime is his
relentless mangling of the English language.  Michael Clarke Duncan
(recently seen in the superb The Green Mile) lends his formidable
presence to the role of Frankie Figs, the hitman whose loyalties are
uncertain.
Written by first time screen writer Mitchell Kapner, The Whole
Nine Yards is the latest screen outing for British director Jonathan
Lynn (best known for his work on the classic tv sitcom Yes Minister,
and films such as My Cousin Vinny, etc).  Lynn has a good eye for
clever visual gags and he maintains a reasonably cracking pace
throughout the convoluted turns and twists.  Unfortunately, Kapner's
sense of invention does not quite last the distance, and he seems to
run out of fresh ideas before the final showdown.
Nonetheless, The Whole Nine Yards is an entertaining mix of
black comedy and broad slapstick humour that works a treat, and is one
of the funniest films to hit our screens so far this year.

"It's not important how many people I've killed. What's important is how I
get along with the people that are still alive," Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski
(Bruce Willis) solemnly informs a very nervous Nick "Oz" Oseransky (Matthew
Perry) once Oz discovers Jimmy's profession. This line, and the way in which
it is delivered, are great examples of how funny "The Whole Nine Yards" can
be. The problem is, that while it can be hilarious, the film also has a
tendancy to drag at times. The ending goes on for far too long, and the
humor occasionally falls flat. However, when the film pulls its humor off,
it's hysterical.
Oz is a dentist who is so tired of life with his commanding wife, Sophie
(Rosanna Arquette), that he spends his mornings smashing his head against
his steering wheel while driving to work. His secretary, Jill (A hilarious
Amanda Peet), is constantly trying to convince him to divorce his wife but
Oz knows that Sophie will get everything in the divorce settlement. To add
to his miseries, Oz discovers that his new neighbor is hitman, Jimmy "The
Tulip" Tudeski. It turns out that there is a price on Jimmy's head, courtesy
of his associate back in Chicago, Yanni Gogolack (Kevin Pollak). Sophie
wants Oz to go back to Chicago, deliver the whereabouts of Jimmy, and
collect a finder's fee. Oz is of course averse to doing this, since it will
most likely involve Jimmy's killing Oz upon his return. Once he arrives in
Chicago, Oz meets up with another hitman named Frankie Figgs (Michael Clark
Duncan), who is apparently working for Yanni. The situation grows steadily
worse for poor Oz from there.
"The Whole Nine Yards" is one of those fun movies like "Mars Attacks" and
"Galaxy Quest", where you can tell that the entire cast is having a great
time making the film. When a cast acts in this manner it usually carries
over to the audience, as is the case here. Bruce Willis's comic talents lie
mainly in his deadpan delivery of lines, and he is given ample oppurtunity
to display this talent throughout the film. I believe that Matthew Perry's
primary talent is his wide range of facial expressions, and again, he is
given the chance to utilize this ability throughout the movie. Despite the
considerable comic abilities of both these actors, they are overshadowed by
Amanda Peet's ("Isn't She Great", "Simply Irresistable") hysterical
performance as the secretary who wants desperately to become a contract
killer.
"The Whole Nine Yards" has an amazingly complex plot, considering what a
goofy little movie it appears to be at first glance. The film is filled with
double crosses, backstabbing, and false identities. Every character involved
wants some other character dead, and there are various little subplots
relating to these. Unlike "Gun Shy" from earlier this year, the romantic
elements to "The Whole Nine Yards" don't feel tacked on and useless. Though
difficult to take seriously, they blend with the rest of the film quite
well. The cast members work very well together, particularly Bruce Willis
and Amanda Peet. The two of them have a grand old time playing teacher and
student in a very unlikely profession. Peet is so overcome with hero worship
for the elder hitman, she is willing to do anything (and I mean anything) to
win his approval.
The only cast member I found to be rather out of place here was Rosanna
Arquette as the hideous wife of Oz. The problem is, I can't imagine anyone
playing a grotesque character like this. The other major flaw with the film
is the amount of time spent on the ending. The movie could have ended
fifteen minutes earlier than it does with no problem. One more thing I must
note is that "The Whole Nine Yards" is definitely a guy movie. Nearly every
guy in the theatre I attended was laughing uproariously at the movie, while
most of the women present seemed rather baffled by the humor. "The Whole
Nine Yards" runs a little too long at 100 minutes, but it doesn't start to
drag too badly till the end. I'd recommend it to fans of Matthew Perry and
Bruce Willis. If you dislike these actors, I'd suggest you stay far away
from this one. I give the movie three and a half out of five stars.

The Whole Nine Yards (2000) 3 stars out of 4. Starring Matthew Perry,
Bruce Willis, Michael Clarke Duncan, Rosanne Arquette, Natasha
Henstridge, Kevin Pollak and Amanda Peet.
 Despite containing graphic violence, strong language and nudity, "The
Whole Nine Yards" is a charming screwball comedy that - minus the
above-mentioned contemporary touches - could have been produced in the
1930s.
 The story, which is not as frenetic as it could be, contains several
double crosses, oddball characters and plot twists familiar to this
genre.
 The plot centers on Dr. Nicholas `Oz' Oseransky (Matthew Perry) who
learns that his new next door neighbor `Jimmy Jones' (Bruce Willis) is,
in reality, Jimmy `The Tulip' Tudeski, a notorious hitman recently
released from prison after serving a five-year stretch for ratting out
his former boss.
 Oz's shrewish wife, Sophie (Rosanna Arquette) wants him killed so she
can collect his insurance money to pay back money her father, Oz's
former partner, embezzled.
 Instead, she convinces Oz to collect a `finder's fee' by contacting the
Gogolack family who have sworn revenge against Jimmy for turning state's
evidence. 
 Of course, nothing works out as planned, as each character has a secret
agenda and connives against the other.
 Caught in the middle of all the scheming is poor Oz. Perry goes through
the entire film looking like a deer caught in the headlights. Perry
gives a physical, near-slapstick performance as he stumbles, falls,
spits and stutters through situations that are way over his head.
 This is the sort of role Bob Hope would have played in the 1930s or
40s, except that Perry lacks the false macho bravado that Hope's
cowardly character would bring to such a part.
 In contrast, Willis gives a rather underplayed performance as the cool
hitman unfazed by all conspiracies going on around him. Willis, with
tongue in cheek, realizes "The Whole Nine Yards" is a comedic romp and
rolls along with a twinkle in his eye, enjoying himself immensely.
 The film is stolen by Amanda Peet as Jill, Oz's office assistant whose
ambition in life is to be a hitman (hitwoman? hitperson?). She is as
excited to meet Jimmy as a teen-ager would be to meet Ricky Martin. She
keeps a scrapbook and knows all his hits, she brags.
 Also in the cast are Michael Clarke Duncan as a fellow hitman and pal
of Jimmy, Kevin Pollak as the revenge-seeking Gogolak and Natasha
Henstridge as Jimmy's wife and Oz's love interest.
 "The Whole Nine Yards" has a few slow spots. At about two hours, it's a
bit too long. Some tighter editing could have given it a more frantic
pace, which would have helped.
 Comedy, especially one in this vein, needs to gallop. The audience
should not be allowed to catch its breath, as the story races from setup
to setup.
 The other deficiency is Arquette's performance. Her French accent is
terrible and her character is too cartoonish, too over-the-top, even for
a comedy of this ilk.
 Despite these minor flaws, "The Whole Nine Yards" is most satisfying.
And no one will have to put a gun to your head to make you laugh.

Natasha Henstridge, Rosanna Arquette, Kevin Pollack, and Harland
Williams
 Let the record state that I expected the worst from The Whole Nine
Yards.  February release date, the girl from Species (all right, so that
was the good part), Bruce Willis (again) attempting comedy.  As a Magic
Eight Ball would tell us, `outlook not so good.'
 Let the record also state that, while watching a bad movie, I either
carry a scribble pad or make mental notes of possible pot shots that I
can shoot off at the movie in my review.  Since I am afforded no
`possible insult' rating system, I translate the pot shots into stars.
For about every ten easy insults a film gives me, I subtract a star from
its rating (baring Airplane, which is designed to cooperate with the pot
shot system and thus is immune to its barbs).  The Whole Nine Yards gave
me thirteen pot shots.  Rounding, we get our current star rating.
 The Whole Nine Yards, like 1997's Grosse Pointe Blank, is the tale of
hit men (and, in Whole Nine Yards, women) in love.  To give you the
quick version of as Byzantine of a plot as I have witnessed in a popcorn
film in a long time, Nick `Oz' Ozeransky (Perry) is worth more dead than
alive.  This fact, combined with the fact that his wife (Arquette) is
pretty much el puta anyways, prompts her to attempt to hire a contact
killer.  Her first attempt declines the offer.  Her second attempt is
the new next-door neighbor, Jimmy the Tulip Tudeski (Willis).  There's
only one slight problem Willis has become a fast friend of Oz's.
 Sadly, due to money problems, Nick's wife has sent him off to Chicago
to rat Jimmy to Yanni Gogolack (Kevin Pollack), a gangster of Hungarian
heritage that never is able to get his j's or v's yust right.  While in
Chicago, Nick meets and becomes smitten with Jimmy's wife, Cynthia
(Henstridge).  Sadly, Yanni has decided to enlist the help of Frankie
(Michael Duncan) to get rid of Jimmy.  Oh, yeah, any Nick's secretary
(Amanda Peet) wants to be a hit woman, too.
 The Whole Nine Yards ends up being both effortlessly funny,
effortlessly hip, and, surprisingly, effortlessly romantic it is
perhaps the oddest Valentine's Day movie to go watch.  Jonathan Lynn,
who handled he aloof but funny dark comedy Clue, manages to provide an
incredibly tight direction for a crime comedy.  Insofar as any comedy
can be truly suspenseful, The Whole Nine Yards is.  Not grading on the
same curve, The Whole Nine Yards still manages to be mysterious.
 The film ends up being an incredibly guilty pleasure not only because
of that fact that it is a dark comedy (and we all know that we shouldn't
laugh at someone getting shot, but such is often the case), but also
because of the fact that the film ends up being incredibly sexy.  Amanda
Peet, in particular, plays the sexy hit-woman intern and, in one scene
where she sticks her naked torso out of the window, we see that her
character's persona isn't the only thing to get perky.
 Aside from the aforementioned easy insult scale, I have to subtract
points from this film for two reasons: Harland Williams and Rosanna
Arquette.  Harland Williams has about five to ten minutes of screen
time, and annoys you for every second that he's on.  Rosanna Arquette
would be wonderful as the annoying wife if she didn't play the part a
little too well.  Also, the film borrows a little too much from its
predecessors (i.e. Grosse Pointe Blank), and seems to be desperate to be
hip although it already obviously is.
 Still, this is the true movie for Valentine's Day.  Forget the fact
that said day will be 11 days in the past when The Whole Nine Yards hits
theatres it's still worth making a date of.

THE WHOLE NINE  YARDS *** (2000) Directed by Jonathan Lynn. Written 
by Mitchell Kapner. Photography, David Franco. Editing. Tom Lewis. 
Production design, David L. Snyder. Music,  Randy Edelman. Produced 
by David Willis and Allan Kaufman. Cast:  Bruce Willis (Jimmy 
Tudeski), Matthew Perry (Oz Oseransky), Rosanna Arquette (Sophie), 
Michael Clarke Duncan (Frankie Figs), Natasha Henstridge (Cynthia), 
Amanda Peet (Jill),   Kevin Pollak (Janni Gogolak), et al. A Warner's 
release. 100 minutes. R (violence)
"Joie de vivre" (the pleasure of being alive) finds its complement 
here as the Joy of Killing, the pleasure of whacking others. Both 
joys coexist.
"The Whole Nine Yards" is a comedy (better yet, a farce) of murders. 
Funny films with corpses are a sub-genre of which the British "Kind 
Hearts and Coronets" with Alec Guinness may well be the most 
illustrious ancestor. Gangster comedies are not uncommon either. Even 
so, this new picture has so much to offer in characters that it is 
enough original and demented to create its own sub-sub-genre. That it 
has touches of Coen Brothers movies (and perhaps "Pulp Fiction") -- 
whether planned or a coincidence, conscious or not -- does not remove 
a thing from its novelty.
I don't think I've laughed so much at mayhem since John Waters's 
"Serial Mom" of 1994. Or chuckled along with the audience instead of 
feeling annoyed at giggles I find totally unjustified.
In a neat, higher (but not highest) income suburb of  Montreal (the 
real city, not a studio fake or a stand-in) dentist Oseransky, aka 
"Oz," lives miserably with his French-Canadian wife Sophie and the 
latter's first abandoned, then widowed mother.The ladies are nasty 
critters who bitch at hangdog-faced Oz for being this unheard of 
creature, a dentist with financial troubles.
Beautiful Jill,  Oz's dental assistant, was recently hired as it 
turns out (this is worked cleverly into the plot). She's lively and 
speaks to Oz with strange familiarity (there's a reason for this, 
too).
When a man moves in next door to the Oz home, the dentist recognizes 
him (don't ask) as  Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski, a contract killer with 
17 corpses to his credit. He had been a witness against his own 
Chicago Hungarian (sic) acolytes in the  deliciously named the 
Gogolak Gang.
Jimmy got away with just five years in prison. When released he 
haughtily refused the Witness Protection program.
Things get enormously complicated. Jimmy takes a shine to the 
trembling Oz. Greedy, imperious Sophie, convinced that the vengeful 
Gogolaks must have a put a price on Jimmy, dispatches the spineless 
Oz to Chicago so that he'll get a finder's fee.
What develops in the Windy City is enormously complicated as well 
funny. There is a kind of Commedia dell'Arte spirit of improvised 
situations, though I suspect they were carefully scripted.
The maze of characters who are not what they seem to be, and then 
some, includes a  huge black man (Michael Clarke Duncan of "The Green 
Mile") with delivers punches while beaming. He  towers over little 
Oz. The gang's leader Janni Gogolak speaks in a comically weird 
accent. Statuesque beauty  Cynthia adds more complications, has not 
had sex for five years (!) and is ... (no,  I won't reveal that).
When Oz returns to Montreal things get even more tangled up, what 
with Sophie having offered a contract on her husband (insurance money 
makes him  worth more dead than alive) to Jimmy, then to someone 
else. What with starry-eyed Jill meeting Jimmy and confessing that 
her dream was to become a hit-woman. What with escalating 
complications.
  It's a perfect cast: Amanda Peet, terrific, adaptable, likable. 
Matthew Perry, splendid as a victim-to-be mouse that does not roar. 
Bruce Willis, with his extraordinary cool. Rosanna Arquette with her 
phony accent. Natasha Hendridge who goes beyond the decorative. 
Michael  Duncan and his black humor. Kevin Pollak with his Pythian 
menaces.
The chain of people who want others whacked makes this is a  comedy 
of  killing grounds -- but its loony unreality, its super-spoof mood, 
defuse the violence. The complexities of this demented tale might 
confuse you, assuming you wish to apply logic -- but the brio is such 
that you don't give a hoot about who, what, where, when, why,  or how.
Some will call this a film noir, but it isn't really. Nor do its 
mostly sunny photography and sets use the traditional 
light-and-shadows and fog-and-rain "noir" look.  Even the excellent, 
discreet but effective score is light.
British  (born in Bath) actor-director Jonathan Lynn, schooled at 
Cambridge, and a nephew of Israel's Abba Eban, was, in the 1980s, the 
creator of the great, ironical Brit TV series "Yes, Minister" and 
"Yes, Prime Minister."  His feature debut was with "Clue" (1985).. 
There followed "Nuns on the Run,"" The Distinguished Gentleman,"" My 
Cousin Vinny,"" Greedy,"" Sgt. Bilko," and "Trial and Error." That's 
definitely a very mixed bag, from bad to mediocre. One factor in 
common which seriously weakened those movies was uneven tempo. The 
infectious "The Whole Nine Yards" has a first-rate, non-stop rhythm 
as well as many other virtues, including a first produced script by 
the otherwise unknown Mitchell Kapner. It's  a huge upward leap for 
Jonathan Lynn.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Just what we need:  Another film about the mob.  Doesn't anybody realize
that the genre has already been perfected within the last twelve
months?  If you want a mob drama, watch The Sopranos.  If you want a mob
comedy, watch Analyze This.  You can even tell the idea has been
overused when a mob spoof has been made (Mafia!).
The Whole Nine Yards is about a dentist named Nick "Oz" Oseransky
(Matthew Perry, Three To Tango).  He has his own practice and a nice
house in a secluded Montreal neighborhood.  Unfortunately, Oz also has a
bitchy wife named Sophie (Rosanna Arquette, Buffalo '66) with a horrible
accent, a wicked mother and an annoying little dog.  The couple can't
stand each other  Sophie because her husband is worth more dead than
alive, and Oz because his practice is in financial shambles because of
his late father-in-law's creative financing.
One day, a mobster from Chicago moves in across the street from the
Oseranskys.  Despite his claim to be `Jimmy Jones,' Oz recognizes his
new neighbor as Jimmy `the Tulip' Tudeski (Bruce Willis, The Story of
Us), a hit-man-turned-informant that testified against his former
colleagues and moved to Montreal after thumbing his nose at the Federal
Witness Protection program.  When Oz tells Sophie, she demands that he
immediately fly to Chicago to collect a `finder's fee' from a Turkish
crime boss Yanni Gogolack (Kevin Pollak, End of Days).
Unsure that he wants to finger his new neighbor, Oz reluctantly flies to
Chicago, but gets wrapped up in a scheme involving Jimmy, Yanni, $10
million and Jimmy's voluptuous wife Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge, Dog
Park).  Plans are hatched, double-crosses are set and surprises are
planned, but the whole film reeks of `been there, done that.'  Most of
the attempted jokes that aren't revealed in the trailer mainly revolve
around either the high dentist suicide rate or the fact that the French
put mayonnaise on hamburgers.  We're talking comedic gold here, folks.
If it wasn't for Perry's great timing and delivery, I would have left in
the middle of the film, which is something I haven't done since Willis'
last film, Breakfast of Champions.  The film is a mess and is poorly
edited, as well.  Here's an example of how choppy the film is:  At one
point, Oz is shown leaving the Renaissance in Chicago, except his
character was supposed to have just flown from Chicago to Montreal, and
he was supposed to be exiting a hotel in that Canadian city.  And, of
course, when Oz lands in Chicago, he calls a friend that works at the
Tribune  when was the last time a cinematic character in Chicago didn't
have a friend at the Tribune?  It's unheard of.
The only other redeeming quality of Yards is the performance of Amanda
Peet (Isn't She Great), who plays Oz's assistant Jill.  Don't be
confused  Peet is also on the WB show Jack & Jill, where she plays Jack
(since nobody watches the show, it probably won't be an issue).  But I
can't tell if Peet is a charismatic actress with legitimate comedic
potential, or if I was happy because she showed her boobs for an
extended period of time.
Yards was directed by Jonathan Lynn (Sgt. Bilko) and written by debut
screenwriter Mitchell Kapner, who also penned the upcoming action flick
Romeo Must Die.  The film also stars Michael Duncan Clarke (The Green
Mile) and Harland Williams (Superstar), but I would crawl the whole nine
yards over broken glass to get away from ever having to see this picture
again.

Who says Hollywood has run out of ideas?  How about a comedy about the
mob?  That's pretty fresh, right?
Jonathan Lynn's THE WHOLE NINE YARDS features a convoluted plot about
ever-changing mob factions that are trying to whack each other.  Add to
that lots of slapstick with guys running into doors and letting off gas,
and you can see the creative juices flowing like molasses going
upstream.  Mitchell Kapner's script, of course, has been done many times
before and usually much better (ANALYZE THIS and GOODFELLAS being just
two examples).  While THE WHOLE NINE YARDS is frequently cute, it's
rarely more than that.  The infrequent laughs are forced, and the movie
feels as stale as a month-old focaccia.
Bad accents are prominently featured, and none is worse than that of
Rosanna Arquette, who plays the obnoxious wife of a Montreal dentist,
whom she's trying to get murdered.  Matthew Perry, an actor with a
highly limited comedic range, is appallingly bad as her husband, Nick
"Oz" Oseransky.  Perry's numerous physical comedy routines are more
embarrassing than funny.
One day, Jimmy Jones a.k.a. Jimmy the Tulip Tudeski (Bruce Willis) moves
in next door to Oz.  In a complicated plot, the Chicago mob, led by
Yanni Gogolack (Kevin Pollak with a repulsively bad accent), wants Jimmy
dead.  Jimmy in turn wants Yanni wasted.  And Jimmy's wife, Cynthia
(Natasha Henstridge), also has murderous intentions, although she's
somewhat more negotiable on exactly who dies.  Who will kill whom, and
who's on whose side changes constantly.
The humor is so droll that it usually isn't funny at all.  "It's not
important how many people I've killed," Jimmy tells Oz.  "It's how I get
along with those still alive."  Jimmy is so tough that he grabs flies,
sucks them into his mouth and spits them out as little corpses.
The film's only real enjoyment comes from two members of the supporting
cast.  Michael Clarke Duncan (THE GREEN MILE) plays Frankie Figs,
Jimmy's lovable bear of a sidekick.  When Duncan comes on the screen, he
has so much charisma that you want to stop the movie and hug him right
then and there.
The best character, Oz's receptionist, Jill, is played by Amanda Peet
from last year's atrocious BODY SHOTS.  Jill is a toothy brunette with
enthusiasm to burn.  A hit man groupie, she worships Jimmy like a rock
star.  When he invites her to help him, it's like Mick Jagger asking her
to come on stage and join him singing at a gig.  She's ready, literally,
to give Jimmy the shirt off of her back to help him with his plans.
Movie goers -- both of them -- who've never seen a Mafioso comedy will
probably find this picture funny.  Everyone else will leave wishing that
they had stayed at home and rented something like GOODFELLAS instead.
THE WHOLE NINE YARDS runs 1:39.  It is rated R for some violence,
nudity, sexual situations and language and would be acceptable for most
teenagers.

 Watching "The Whole Nine Yards" and waiting to laugh is almost as
futile as licking a popsicle stick in the hope it may eventually start
to taste sweet.
 This lumbering, colorless attempt at comedy brings together several
stars who look not only unattractive, but downright unhealthy. Instead
of laughing at the puffy Matthew Perry and the skeletal Rosanna
Arquette, you want to drive them to the nearest clinic for a check-up.
Perhaps on the way out the door you can take a second to remind Bruce
Willis his face is capable of more than just one grim expression.
 On the other hand, Willis isn't likely to be the only person who goes
through "Yards" without cracking a smile. Mitchell Kupner's screenplay
initially strives for both the corkscrew twists of "Ruthless People" and
the dark humor of "Analyze This," only to quickly settle for the mundane
rhythms of a bad TV sitcom. The movie's idea of a running gag is to make
repeated references to the curious Canadian habit of spreading
mayonnaise on hamburgers. Absolutely hilarious.
 Set in Montreal, "Yards" sets up Perry as Oz Oseransky, a dentist
married to a harpy named Sophie (Arquette, employing the corniest French
accent since Pepe Le Pew) who'd love nothing more than a ringside seat
at her husband's funeral. When their new neighbor Jimmy Jones (Willis)
is revealed to be none other than fugitive Chicago mobster Jimmy "Tulip"
Tudeski, Oz flies into a panic, while Sophie schemes to use Jimmy to
bump off her spouse. Oz zooms to the Windy City to report Jimmy to the
authorities, meets Jimmy's curvy missus Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge) and
learns the hard way why one should not covet thy neighbor's wife.
 "I haven't made love in five years," Cynthia confesses. "Neither have I
-- I've been married," Oz replies. That's Kupner's idea of really snappy
dialogue.
 As Willis practices his studied grimace and Perry wearyingly reprises
all his anxious tics, the only zip in the picture is provided by Michael
Clarke Duncan as a hard to figure associate of Jimmy's and Amanda Peet
(TV's "Jack and Jill"), who puts considerable life into the throwaway
role of Oz's goofy receptionist. With her enormous teeth and slightly
crazed eyes, Peet has exactly the sort of manic edge so desperately
desired by and conspicuously absent from the rest of the film. James

 Bruce Willis teams up with Friends Matthew Perry in this formulaic mobster comedy. Willis plays a cool professional hitman who moves incognito into an upscale Montreal suburb, while Perry is his nerdy neighbor, a dentist, who immediately recognizes him as Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski, who squealed on his former employers, the Gogolak crime family of Chicago. "It's not important that I've killed 17 people," Willis tells the incredulous Perry. "What's important is how I get along with the people that are still alive."  Soon, the disparate men find they share a common bond: someone's trying to kill them both. Perry's shrewish wife, vamped with an outrageous French accent by Rosanna Arquette, complains that her husband is "the only dentist who can't make money!" She not only wants to kill him so she can collect on his life insurance but she also wants to nab the reward for nailing The Tulip.  Enormous Michael Clarke Duncan (The Green Mile) ostensibly works as an enforcer for!
 Janni Gogolak (Kevin Pollak), while Amanda Peet is sweetly sympathetic and remarkably helpful as Perry's dental assistant who has a secret yearning to be a contract killer.  Plus there's Natasha Henstridge, as Willis' cold, calculating ex-wife, who inexplicably finds the bumbling Perry sexually irresistible. Writer Mitchell Kapner repeatedly capitalizes on a running joke about the Canadian habit of putting mayo on a hamburger, and director Jonathan Lynn does his best to keep the zany, bizarre action moving quickly. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, The Whole Nine Yards is a ludicrous, lame, farcical 4. Problem is: these are amiable but crude, essentially superficial caricatures, not three-dimensional characters, like Billy Crystal and Robert DeNiro in the mob comedy Analyze This.

Heh, haven't laughed this hard while watching a movie in a long time. I 
must say, The Whole Nine Yards is one of the funniest films I've seen in a 
long while.
What would you do if you found out a gunman-for-hire just moved in next 
door? Easy, go befriend him. Nicholas (Matthew Perry) just meet his new 
neighbour, Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski (Bruce Willis). In the quiet 
neighbourhood where Nicholas lives everything is about to change. See, 
Nicholas is a nice guy, but definitely a loser. He's a dentist that's in a 
bad marriage and he's worth more dead than alive. It's hard to say anything 
about the plot without giving away the movie, so I'll stop there. But, lets 
just say that there are a lot of characters in this movie, and all of them 
are well written. And all of them have something to do with another of 
them. The web in which these characters are woven into is intricate and 
this all works out rather well for a comedy.
Mitchell Kapner has put together a wonderfully detailed and funny script 
with The Whole Nine Yards. The movie is captivating. On top of the 
wonderful script are wonderful performances. Perry does great on the big 
screen (finally). Willis is having a good change of image. His comedic side 
is really strong and he shows just that here in The Whole Nine Yards. Other 
performances worth mentioning are: Michael Clarke Duncan as Frankie Figs, 
another hired gun; Rosanna Arquette as Nicholas' scheming wife; and Amanda 
Peet as Jill St. Claire, Nicholas' receptionist who knows more than 
Nicholas thinks.
If you're looking for a good laugh, rent The Whole Nine Yards. It's a 
hilarious film that will have you in stitches by the time the credits roll. 
Don't Miss The Whole Nine Yards.

Review by Scott Hunt         Movie Hunt:
http://netdirect.net/~hunt/index.html
Rhythm. I kept thinking about that word as I left the theater. At it's
best moments, the Whole Nine Yards has a certain rhythm. It comes from
some of the one on one conversations between characters. There is a
certain comic timing that reminded me of 1940's screwball comedies, like
a good Tracey/Hepburn film. Those moments weren't plentiful, but they
were joyful to watch.
The Whole Nine Yards centers on dentist Nicholas "Oz" Oseransky (Perry),
who is sleepwalking through life married to a shrewish wife (Arquette),
living a bland existance in Montreal. That all changes when Oz meets his
next door neighbor, Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski (Willis), a former Chicago
mob hitman recently released from prison for ratting out his former mob
associates. Because of Tulip's kiss and tell, a mob boss, played by
Pollock, wants him dead. The story careens along at a brisk clip as
there are double , then triple crosses and at certain points, you don't
know who is going to kill whom. Perry and Willis both play characters
we've seen before, but they imbue them with so much of their persona
that they gain an edge to them. 
Perry is the same character he's played on TV and in previous movies: a
sweet, somewhat clever guy whose unsure of what he wants in life. Willis
is the same pucker-mouthed, wisecracking, king of cool that we've been
seeing since his Moonlighting days. The difference this time is that
Lynn has gotten the pair down to a distillation of themselves. The
acting may not be a stretch for either actor, but there is a leaness to
their performances that works in their favor. Perry runs the gamut of
slapstick physical comedy to repeated double takes to a modest spit
take, a comedic classic. He bounces through the film with whiffle ball
lightness, while showing a certain restraint. He is amusing to behold. 
Willis manages to turn his trademark smirk into a mysterious Mona Lisa
smile, and that's the key to his performance. You think you know what
Tulip is thinking, but that smirk lingers a bit long as his eyes lock
uncomfortably onto another character and you sense the menace floating
behind that smile.
There are other nice acting turns. Amanda Peet, as Jill, Oz's dental
assistant, projects a sexy goofiness that is truly engaging. Natasha
Henstridge as Tulip's wife, holds the screen with subtle emotional
depth, that belies the swirl of zaniness surrounding her. Duncan, as
another hitman, lights the screen up with his self satisfied smile and
hulking presence. That isn't to say that everyone comes across so
effectively. 
It's obvious that Pollock and Arquette, as Oz's wife, were told to play
their parts over the top. The problem is that they go so far over the
top that they fall off the other side. Arquette adopts what is suppossed
to be a french accent, but it sounded more like a blend of French,
Chinese and an other-wordly language. Pollock garbles his way through an
unfunny hungarian speech affectation that had me yearning for earplugs. 
The Whole Nine Yards has it's moments, but it never climbs to the level
of belly laughs. I found myself chuckling at certain parts and smiling
in bemusement at others and there isn't a thing wrong with that. Just
because it falls short of going the full 10 yards, doesn't mean it's not
pleasant, very amusing film fare.

"You've killed 17 people and you think that my wife is a bad person!?" 
-Oz, 'Whole Nine Yards' Š Warner Bros. 
It's not very clever, but sweet and charmingly simple. An innocent and harmless film that will certainly cheer you up on a rainy day. Nicholas "Oz" Oseransky (MATTHEW PERRY) is a sweet dentist (if there is such a thing) living in suburban Montreal. Unsuccessful at work and unhappily married to a selfish, greedy vamp (ROSANNA ARQUETTE), he maintains his dull existence with the help of his best friend and assistant Jill (AMANDA PEET). It seems that because of his insurance Oz is worth more dead than alive. And his charming wife has already taken the liberty of hiring several professional hit men to inherit the money. On one fine morning a new neigbour is moving in next door to Oz. The problem is that he is Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski (BRUCE WILLIS ) - a hit man hiding out from a dangerous Chicago crime family. Despite their differences, Oz and Jimmy have one thing in common: someone's trying to kill them both. For Jimmy, avoiding a couple of hired killers is child's play. But for !
Oz, it's a whole new ball game. And it is here that the story gets a lot more complicated. The plot consists merely of endless complications, twists and turns. Every character wants another character dead. And it is all about the 10 million dollars. 
There are times where this film is simply delightful. One of this film's achievements is the wisely assembled cast. Matthew Perry puts on a wonderful comic performance as the innocent and good-hearted dentist, which proves him as an actor capable of more than 'Friends'. Bruce Willis is truly at home; playing a character that fits not only his abilities, but also his acting history. As his loyal friend we have Michael Clarke Duncan (Oscar nominated for 'The Green Mile'), who portrays his character so expressively that it is a sheer joy to behold. And even Natasha Henstridge ('Species') performed with all her clothes on. But it's Amanda Peet ('One Fine Day'), who has accidentally become the real star of this film. She looks and acts like a clone of Julia Roberts , with the same big smile and radiance, but a talent that is uniquely her own. She delivers her lines so naturally and with such comic ease that she simply commands attention. 
Director Jonathan Lynn ('My Cousin Vinnie') follows in the steps of several great mob comedies (such as the more successful 'Analyze This'), obviously too afraid to step away from the ancient formula. And though his film is fairly entertaining, it doesn't have one single original idea. Too much time is spent on the murder and defense plans, to let the cleverness develop. Simple slapstick humor and amusing lines (none of which are particularly intelligent) are the film's strength, not the characters. And that's why it sometimes feels like a collection of jokes, rather than a coherent story. At times acting provides more laughs than the script. Most of the laughs are genuine, coming one after another in a fast and rhythmic tempo. Some feel forced, but as an overall achievement Lynn's picture is funny. And much more is not required from a summer comedy. In other words Lynn does fine, but if Billy Crystal's character in 'Analyze This' would analyze him, he would probably say: "You!
 settle too easily for things. I think that it is a fear of rejection or disapproval. But you don't have to worry about that. Be your own man. Stand your grounds!" Because there are times when, amidst Perry's and Peet's periodic comic outbursts, you long for that almost forgotten, refreshing breeze of originality.

        "Be gentle," urges Natasha Henstridge to Matthew Perry in "The
Whole Nine Yards."  "I haven't made love in five years."  "Neither have I,"
rebuts Perry.  "I'm married!"
        If Jonathan Lynn's latest comedy relied simply on jokes of that
caliber--and it certainly tries--then it'd be an innocuous if rather
obvious little film.  Instead, its failings go much deeper.  First off, who
hasn't had enough of the tough wiseguy intimidates the timid wise guy
genre?  If you want to make a pretty penny or two in Hollywood nowadays
simply write a "comedy" which pairs a Robert De Niro/James Caan/Bruce
Willis type with a Billy Crystal/Hugh Grant/Matthew Perry type and wait for
the royalties to roll in.  Who's next?  Jack Nicholson and Martin Short?
It certainly doesn't have to be funny.
        "The Whole Nine Yards" is not a particularly funny film, but it is
borderline offensive.  Offensive in the way it continues a trend of poking
fun at career criminals who wouldn't think twice about pushing your
mother-in-law off the Brooklyn Bridge with her feet encased in concrete.
That might sound like a funny sight gag, but the problem is these films
have long since lost sight of the fact that taking a human life isn't all
that funny to begin with.  When the corpse is placed in a car, doused with
gasoline, set ablaze and referred to as "barbecue," it makes you wonder
when all this playing killing for laughs is going to end.
        "The Whole Nine Yards" is also offensive in so much as its three
central female characters are portrayed as nothing more than sex objects.
Rosanna Arquette plays a slutty, chain-smoking French Canadian who's
married to Matthew Perry's none-too-successful dentist.  It's an
unflattering role made all the more so by the unflattering outfits--and
unflattering situations--into which Arquette is thrust.
        Then there's Natasha Henstridge ("Species" I and II) who plays the
well-to-do wife of contract killer Bruce Willis.  She gets involved with
Perry's character when he comes to Chicago hoping to negotiate a finder's
fee with mob boss Yanni Gogolack (Kevin Pollack, transposing his Vs with
his Ws) after Willis' Jimmy the Tulip Tudeski moves in next door.
Henstridge and Perry's characters hitting it off is about as likely as
Bruce and Demi getting back together.  Perry might have the charm but he
doesn't have the physical attributes of a traditional leading man,
especially in close-up.
        Most objectified of the bunch is Amanda Peet, who turns in a
sexually-ripe performance as Perry's dental assistant with, it transpires,
questionable career goals.  Peet's gratuitous nude scene proves how low
this movie will stoop to keep its audience from dropping off.
        When "My Cousin Vinny" is the highpoint of a directorial career
including such forgettable films as "Clue," "Greedy," and "Sgt. Bilko," you
have to wonder if Lynn chose the wrong career path.  Perry's pratfalling
goofiness coupled with Willis' likable hardness could have had some
potential but with no script to work with, and a director who seems to be
watching from the wings, their characters run out of gas quickly.

Directed by Jonathan Lynn. Screenplay by Mitchell Kapner. Starring Bruce
Willis, Matthew Perry, Natasha Henstridge. Running time: 100 minutes. Rated
AA. Reviewed on March 16th, 2000.
Sometimes, comedy is easy. Romance, sports, teen angst -- these topics 
and others have often been mined for the purpose of making us laugh. 
(Every now and then, it's even done successfully.) Other subjects have 
proved more difficult to capture successfully in a comedy format, 
however. Of these, few have been more elusive than the gangster genre.
"The Whole Nine Yards" is the latest attempt to marry mirth and the mob, 
telling the screwball tale of Nicholas "Oz" Oseransky (Matthew Perry). 
Oseransky's life is less than idyllic: he is trapped in a loveless 
marriage, he's forced to pay off his late father-in-law's enormous debts, 
and he's a dentist. Just when things seem as though they can't get any 
worse, Oz recognizes his new next-door neighbor as Jimmy "The Tulip" 
Tudeski (Bruce Willis), a feared hitman who turned state's evidence 
against Chicago's Gogolack gang and has recently been released from prison.
Oz does his best to ignore the situation, eventually becoming friends 
with Tudeski. But Oz's scheming wife Sophie (Rosanna Arquette) has other 
ideas. She forces him to fly to Chicago to inform mob boss Yanni Gogolack 
(Kevin Pollak, with a hilariously ridiculous accent) as to The Tulip's 
whereabouts and collect a finder's fee, while at the same time telling 
Jimmy what Oz is doing, in the hope that Tudeski will bump off her husband. 
To make matters worse, in Chicago Oz meets Jimmy's wife Cynthia (Natasha 
Henstridge) and instantly falls in love with her. It turns out that she, 
Jimmy and Gogolack have entered into an agreement whereby if two of them 
die, the third gets ten million dollars. It is this deal which drives the 
final two-thirds of the movie, as the different players try to bump each 
other off, and Oz tries to save Cynthia while not losing his own head.
Like most mob comedies, "The Whole Nine Yards" faces the difficult task 
of juxtaposing laughs with the sheer brutality of the gangster 
profession. Some movies deal with this by indulging in the truly bizarre, 
like Tarantino's "Reservoir Dogs". Others simply tone down the violence, 
so that the jokes seem less incongruous. "The Whole Nine Yards" does 
neither, and the result is a somewhat uncomfortable viewing experience. I 
found it difficult at times to laugh at the sitcom-level humor of the 
film, immediately after seeing four men blown away in a hail of gunfire.
Neither of the principals really seems to embrace the material, perhaps 
themselves uncertain how to reconcile the movie's plot with its comedic 
intentions. Willis looks like he's cruising in neutral as Tudeski. While 
The Tulip is given a number of interesting personality traits, they never 
really come together to form a convincing, complete individual. Perry's 
Oz is basically just his Chandler Bing character from the TV series 
"Friends" transplanted to a different milieu; even some of the vocal 
mannerisms are identical. He's likeable enough as a sympathetic Ordinary 
Joe caught up in events beyond his control, but just doesn't have the 
on-screen presence to really absorb the viewer into his plight.
Better are the supporting characters, particularly Amanda Peet as Jill St 
Claire, Oz's receptionist who harbors secrets of her own. Peet clearly 
relishes her role, and her electrifying performance helps her steal 
scenes from the more tepid Willis and Perry. Star of the TV sitcom "Jack 
and Jill", Peet appears to be a comedy star on the rise. Michael Clarke 
Duncan also has fun as Frankie Figs, one of Tudeski's hitman confreres.
"The Whole Nine Yards" is set for the most part in Montréal, and is 
attractively photographed. Surprisingly, though, it takes little 
advantage of the Francophone milieu. The movie is liberally sprinkled 
with the French language (and Arquette sports a grotesquely exaggerated 
Québecois accent), but virtually none of the humor arises from the unique 
culture, beyond a running gag about hamburgers and mayonnaise. This is 
unfortunate; were the comedy to arise more naturally from the film's 
situations and surroundings, instead of resorting to routine one-liners 
and pratfalls, I think I would have found the violent aspects of the plot 
less jarring and easier to swallow.
Like last year's "Analyze This", "The Whole Nine Yards" is an only 
partially-successful mob comedy. It has its moments, especially when Peet 
is involved, but the time between laughs is often lengthy, and many of 
the jokes just don't pack much of a punch, especially when paired with 
the violence of the gangster lifestyle. This is a film which desperately 
needs to eschew the conventions of the sitcom format and more wholly 
embrace its subject material. In essence, instead of falling back on a 
tired comedy format, "The Whole Nine Yards" needs to go the whole nine yards.

Before plunking down your hard-earned money to see
this film, ask yourself this one question.  Can you
visualize a movie that stars tough-guy Bruce Willis
alongside Friends funny-guy Matthew Perry?  Willis has
played countless tough guys before.  So, this isn't
new territory for him.  Perry, however, usually is the
equivalent of the touch of death when he is part of
any movie project.  His deer-in-the-headlights comedic
style, works well on his TV show but doesn't seem to
translate well onto the big screen.
In `The Whole Nine Yards,' the running theme is about
people that want to kill other people.  Matthew Perry
plays Oz, a nicer-than-nice Dentist who is openly
despised by his wife, Sophie (Rosanna Arquette).  She
wishes that Oz would die, and is secretly in the
process of trying to hire a hitman for the job.   Oz
tells of his marital woes to his dental assistant,
Jill (Amanda Peet).  She is appalled by his current
situation and tells him that he'd `be doing the world
a favor if he had her whacked.'  To make Oz's life
even more complicated, the new neighbor next door
turns out to be famed hitman-in-hiding, Jimmy `The
Tulip' Tudeski (Willis).  Though Oz is terrified with
this fact, it's hard to turn down an invitation from
him to go for a drive.  `Relax, it won't kill you,'
says Tudeski with his tongue firmly in cheek.   `The
Tulip' imparts his philosophies about life, making Oz
completely uneasy.   `We'll all die sometime' and
`what's important is how I get along with the people
who are still alive.' 
Oddly, Jimmy is only the first hitman that he'll meet
over the course of the week.  Oz eventually runs into
Frank Figs (Michael Duncan Clarke), a really large
enforcer for Hungarian crime boss Janni Gogolak (Kevin
Pollak).  Gogolak has put a price on Tudeski's head.
Poor Oz.  He has to find a way to keep all of the ones
that he cares for alive while saving himself.  And
this can become quite difficult because one of the
women that he meets along the way and falls in love
with happens to be Jimmy's wife (Natasha Henstridge). 
When Oz confesses to Jimmy that he's fallen in love
with her, he laments `Oh my God, I've upset a mass
murderer.'
Happily, there's a hint of general glee among the cast
members, who seem to be enjoying what they are doing. 
This would explain the purposefully over-the-top
acting in some sequences and the incomprehensible
accents in others.  Actors get at least one scene to
ham it up, and when the spotlight is on them, they
take full advantage of their opportunity.  Kevin
Pollak gets his moment as the Hungarian crime boss who
doesn't quite have a good enough command of the
English language.  Rosanna Arquette gets her moment
when she seduces hitmen as part of her contract
negotiation strategy.  But the real bright spot for
me, however, was Amanda Peet who played Jill the
dental assistant.  She turns out to be a Tudeski
groupie who aspires to become a bona fide contract
killer.  She brings a natural vibrancy to her role
that makes her infectiously funny and a delight to
watch.  Enjoying this film really depends on two
things: having the patience to allow some of the
movie's momentum to generate and accepting its
tongue-in-cheek spirit.  Some of it worked for me. 
Some didn't.

A light-hearted contract killer and nervously pathetic dentist toggle
between teaming up and double crossing each other in this fun and funnier
near-farce comedy. Matthew Perry, playing a part that could have been
written for Jim Carrey, apprehensively stumbles all over himself - but it
works. Perry admits, "I'd do anything for a laugh in this movie." Director
Jonathan Lynn calls him an "Immensely talented clown."
Not a serious bone in its body, the film creates a cast of caricatures that
tangle and tango atop a slightly twisted dance floor. Perry is the wormy
good-hearted dentist that flops over strategically placed ottomans with all
the grace of a young Dick Van Dyke. The innocent-faced Perry even looks like
a dentist - doesn't he? The physical comedy is admittedly cheap - but Perry
pulls it off, he had me laughing every time. Perry's wife, Rosanna Arquette
playing Perry's wife, attempts to portray a French Canadian "ornerian" from
a comedic angle, but fails. Then there's Bruce as the slick contract killer
living next door. Willis is 100% smooth as he walks the fine line between
real person and comic book abstraction. Kevin Pollack's, mob boss's son
character that pronounces "W's" as "V's" falls short, but shoots no holes in
the film. In the end, it's the impeccable timing, pace and one liners that
give "Nine Yards" its zing:
"Have a nice day." Perry wishes his wife.
"I would if you do me a favor and die." She smilingly retorts.
"You like living in Canada?" Willis innocently asks Perry.
"I live here with my wife." Perry responds curtly, as if it were absolutely
obvious that the word "like" could not be used in any context involving his
wife.
After Willis easily intimidates the jittery Perry into momentarily
abandoning a few select body functions, the whimsical Willis grabs his keys,
"Come on, change your pants. We're going out!"
With perhaps the film's finest line betwixt his golden teeth, a
sparkling-eyed Willis savors this gem through a crooked smile, "It doesn't
matter how many people I've killed. What matters is how I treat those who
are still alive."
A price on his head, Chicago gangland contract-killer Willis moves next door
to Perry who's wife forces him to go back to the States to acquire a
"finder's fee" for ratting on the new neighbor. There, Perry meets up with
the huge Michael Clarke Duncan's loving fists and writer Mitchell Kapner's
plotting twists.
A few winceable story progressions in the front and end are easily
outweighed by a fine "body" of fun film in-between. I laughed out loud very
often.

Starring Matthew Perry, Bruce Willis, Rosanna Arquette, Michael Clarke
Duncan, Natasha Henstrige, Toni Colette. Directed by Jonathan Lynn.
Rated R.
The Whole Nine Yards is a sublime semi-romantic caper comedy,
cartoonishly convoluted but (more or less) consistently hilarious.
Aside from a rare comedic performance by Bruce Willis, this is mostly
stuff we've seen before. But director Jonathan Lynn, who literally cut-
and-pasted the premise from his own 1992 hit My Cousin Vinny into the
1997 comedy Trial and Error and made it work, has a flair for bringing
old ideas into a fresh light. The secret to this movie's success isn't
the plot, which is contrived and rather absurd, but likable
performances and a funny, energetic script.
Friends's Matthew Perry plays Nick Ozaransky, a very unhappily married
dentist living in Quebec. One day Nick realizes that the person who
just moved in next door to him is actually Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski
(Willis), a notorious contract killer. Jimmy has a price on his head
himself: Chicago gangster Yanni Gogolack (Kevin Pollack) wants Jimmy
dead for killing his father. Nick's antichrist of a wife ships him off
to Chicago to rat Jimmy out to Yanni and collect the finder's fee.
In Chicago, Nick meets up with Frankie Figs (The Green Mile's Michael
Clarke Duncan), an associate of Yanni. He is instructed to go back to
Canada with Frankie and help kill Tudeski. But The Tulip has plans of
his own. You see, Nick's wife wants Nick dead so she looks around for a
good hit man; in the process, she tells Jimmy what Nick is doing in
Chicago. When Gogolack and his gang arrive, Jimmy will be waiting.
But of course a movie like this would not be complete without a love
subplot so Nick falls for Jimmy's wife. The kicker is that Jimmy, his
wife, and Yanni have a collective 10 million dollars lying in a bank.
To claim the money, they need the signatures of the three people, two
signatures and a death certificate or one signature and two death
certificates. Thus, Jimmy wants to kill both Yanni and his wife,
claiming all the money for himself. Lovesick Nick can't let that
happen, of course, but can he really do anything about it?
There's a whole lot going on here, even more than I cared to explain,
and not all of it makes sense. But The Whole Nine Yards tackles its
plot with such unapologetically cheerful gusto that you can't help but
like it. It's hard to tell whether the film is aware of its own
absurdity and is winking slyly as it takes its goofy script and runs
with it or whether it has no idea and just doesn't care but I'm leaning
towards the latter. It never seems to flinch, back away or make
excuses; it just romps its way through the story.
Matthew Perry has made a career of always playing the straight man, the
one person remaining rational when everyone around him goes loony. He's
done it in his tv show, the underrated 1999 movie Three To Tango and is
continuing that trend here. I never seem to get sick of his sarcastic,
cynical style; the actor can do more with subtle gestures and facial
expressions than some comedians can with a rubber face or a script full
of monologues. His masterful comic delivery can make even slightly lame
one-liners riotous.
Playing alongside Perry is Bruce Willis, an actor not known to do comic
roles which is a shame. His performance here is superior to almost any
given pre-Sixth Sense role he's taken. Willis's Jimmy Tudeski is the
polar opposite of Perry's Nick, a wry, smug, almost omnipotent criminal
ready to kill at the blink of an eye and Willis plays him perfectly,
often underplaying scenes thereby making his character creepily
volatile as well as funny.
There's a scene in The Whole Nine Yards in which Willis and Perry are
standing on a moving boat. Perry is astonished about something that I
will not reveal and the unperturbed Willis throws him a beer. Perry is
far too ruffled to catch it and the beer flies on by and off the boat.
A lesser movie might have lingered on this admittedly funny gag and
killed the joke. But without so much as a pause, The Whole Nine Yards
just continues on its merry way.
