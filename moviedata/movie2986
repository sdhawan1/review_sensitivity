If "Good Will Hunting" and "Scent of a Woman" were to meet some moonlit 
night, consummate and make a child, "Finding Forester" would be their 
adolescent son. 
Though less developed, matured, and fervent than its parents, 
"Forrester" draws from the same heart to make the same points. 
It's a warm mellow film. Warm in its development of the unlikely 
friendship between Sean Connery, (a cynical Pulitzer Prize winning 
recluse) and Brown, a 16-year-old basketballer from the Bronx. Mellow in 
its progression. Unfortunately, Director Gus Van Sant kicks back a 
little too long -- never really breaking into the intense back and forth 
of "Good Will Hunting" which he also directed. 
Additionally, the piece feels harshly edited at times. For example, a 
trip to a basketball game ends in a baseball diamond -- not even a quick 
reference shot of a basketball game is given. 
Anyway, it's a nice enough film, quaint even. And one of the few films 
where the lead actor can actually aptly play the sport he's called to 
play. 
I particularly enjoyed the following quote from the production notes. F. 
M. Abraham who plays Crawford the skeptical prep school teacher says of 
his character, "Crawford's ... a victim of his own pride and blindness. 
His tragedy is that he's failed the one great student he ever taught, 
squandered his chance at helping someone achieve true fame."

 Finding Forrester (2000) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Sean Connery,
Rob Brown, F. Murray Abraham, Anna Paquin and Busta Rhymes. Written by
Mike Rich. Directed by Gus Van Sant.
 Director Gus Van Sant threads a very thin line in his newest movie,
Finding Forrester.
 Firstly, some people may draw comparisons between this and his previous
outing, the Oscar-winning Good Will Hunting.
 Secondly, some may accuse the director of patronization or even racism
in this well-done story of a black ghetto teen-ager, Jamal Wallace (Rob
Brown), who's undisciplined talent is given focus and purpose by a
reclusive, white writer, William Forrester (Sean Connery).
 But these are arguments you think of days or maybe even weeks after
seeing Finding Forrester. While you watch it, though, you are caught up
in the dynamics of the relationship between this older man whoís afraid
to leave his apartment and this ambitious, but realistic youth who knows
the odds he must overcome to achieve the recognition to which his
God-given talent entitles him.
 Finding Forrester is a belated holiday gift ó a film you can cheer and
applaud as the end credits roll.
 The movie is like an oasis in a cinematic desert. Cinematically, 2000
was as exciting as a Floridianís dissertation about chads. Finding
Forrester is like discovering a Lena Horne is a chorus of Brittany
Spearses.
 The movie does contain a few clichés: The preppy private school that
accepts Jamal as much for his basketball playing skills as for his
intellectual skills; the schoolís trustees who patronize Jamal and only
offer him token acceptance: the one white, rebellious female student
(Anna Paquin) who takes a romantic interest in Jamal.
 What also is brought to mind are some movies from the late ë80s and
early ë90s, such as Cry Freedom and Mississippi Burning, which dealt
with the issues of apartheid and the civil rights movement, but from the
perspective of those films white characters.
 Again, though, these shortcomings do not interfere with the overall
emotional impact you get from watching Finding Forrester.
 The glue that binds this drama is the performance of Connery ó at once
arrogant, grumpy, suspicious and afraid ó and his characterís
interaction with Jamal. Connery endows Forrester with some quirky
habits: He wears his socks inside out, for example.
 Underneath Forresterís bluster is a vulnerable, lonely man who abhors,
yet simultaneously misses, social intercourse.
 Finding Forrester marks Brownís film debut, and itís a beaut. This
young man is intelligent, cynical and talented, aware of the
circumstances in which he lives and knowing the odds he faces to raise
his status. But Brownís Jamal shows more determination than bitterness.
He fights the odds society has stacked against him not with a sword, but
with a pen.
 As I said, Finding Forrester has its fill of clichés and caricatures.
The most obvious is F. Murray Abraham as a snobbish literary teacher at
Jamalís private school who does not believe that this ghetto teen is a
prodigy. The mistake was making Abrahamís character a failed, frustrated
author.
 At more than two hours, Finding Forrester does not lag. Director Van
Sant keeps the action flowing between Jamal, Forrester, their
relationship as well as glimpses of Jamalís home life and his struggles
at school.
 Finding Forrester is a positive experience, a movie you can sit back
and enjoy. It will make you laugh, anger you at times, and may even
bring a tear to your eye. Itís a movie that may envelop you like a warm
hug.

     They're already calling it "Good Will Hunting in the hood," and
it's for good reason.  Gus Van Sant's latest takes us back to the inner
city (or The Bronx, at least) for a second verse of that feel-good
feeling, with none other than Sean Connery as a crotchety old shut-in
who teaches (and learns from, natch) a local teen (Rob Brown) who sneaks
into his apartment.
     If you've seen the trailer, you know the story.  The local Bronx
kids live in fear of "the window," a ghostlike man who stares down at
them creepily while they shoot hoops.  On a dare, young Jamal (Brown)
sneaks into the place, finding it cluttered with books.  He's given a
scare and Jamal runs off, leaving his backpack behind.
     The next day, his backpack returns from the sky, and lo and behold
we learn of Jamal's true passion -- not for basketball, no.  For the
written word.  And inside the pack, he finds his six journals, which
apparently go everywhere with him, have been edited and critiqued by the
man in the window.
     It's tortuous plotting, but eventually Jamal befriends the peeper
(Connery), who turns out to be none other than William Forrester, the
famed author of a single novel published some 50 years ago -- a novel
which won a Pulitzer and inexplicably drove its author into hiding.
     An obvious stand-in for J.D. Salinger, Connery's character is a
neurotic shut-in, crippled with anxiety and unable to leave his home. 
He drinks and pontificates and wears his socks inside out.  And he
starts teaching Jamal how to write.  (And as a side note from this
professional writer to any aspiring writer types reading this review --
please do not try to take Forrester's advice.)
     Events transpire and Jamal winds up in a Manhattan prep school
where he is soon accused of plagiarism due to his astounding,
accelerated growth as a writer.  That he is one of few blacks in a
ritzy, almost-all-white environment (you know, he plays basketball) adds
fuel to the fire.  It'll take a miracle to get Jamal out of this jam --
and you'll just have to imagine the shocking conclusion of the film. 
Unless you already saw it in the trailer, I mean.
     Unfortunately, the fact that the entire story of Finding Forrester
can be told verbatim in 60 seconds during a TV commercial doesn't really
matter.  This is the kind of film where our young hero has time in every
day for playing basketball, writing at Forrester's place, writing at
home (as he's not allowed to remove his work from Forrester's
apartment), plus, ostensibly, doing his schoolwork and sleeping.  (What,
no part-time job?)  This is a Hollywood movie, and it's unabashedly so. 
Forrester is larger than life in the way that only Connery can be. 
Jamal is larger than life as well, the actor that plays him custom-made
to repeat that Matt Damon/Ben Affleck Good Will Hunting Oscar magic. 
You'll hear this a lot: Rob Brown was born in Harlem and has no training
as an actor.  And he isn't acting here, he's reading his lines, being
himself, and wondering how the hell he got on the set of a big-time
movie.  The press is going to eat this guy up like buttah.
     Again, this is Hollywood, and all the old school
wannabe-blockbuster elements are there.  There's a commentary on class
and race, there's Busta Rhymes provided for some well-done comic relief,
and lest we begin to take the movie seriously, there's Joey Buttafuoco
making a cameo as a security guard (no, really).  The picture has the
body of Girlfight and the ending of Scent of a Woman.  It is unoriginal
and long, it is predictable and mildly pleasant, it is cranked out for
the least common denominator, and it won't offend anyone -- not even the
prep school bozos it vilifies.  That's fine.  Movies like this don't
hurt, and if they convince a few disenfranchised youths to pick up a pen
and start some writing, all the better.
     While Finding Forrester is an average film that earns my average
rating, the real disappointment is its ultimately disheartening theme
that makes you wonder how it ever got made.  (I wondered the same thing
about Good Will Hunting, but that's another story.)  The problem is
this: Much as in Hunting, which told us that anybody can pull himself
out of the hood... if they're a super-genius, Finding Forrester says
that anybody with a little talent can become a great writer... if
they're tutored by a Pulitzer Prize winner.
     I guess those kids will have to keep dreaming after all.  Merry
Christmas.

In FINDING FORRESTER, director Gus Van Sant, who last gave us a 
shot-by-shot reconstruction of Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO, returns to the 
same familiar subject matter of the young and gifted that he pursued in 
GOOD WILL HUNTING.  This time the story concerns a black, 16-year-old 
writer, Jamal Wallace (Rob Brown), who leaves his run-down Bronx school 
to attend Mailor, a prestigious private school in Manhattan.  Although 
he is awarded an academic scholarship, he is expected to help Mailor win 
the basketball championship.
Ironically, first-time screenwriter Mike Rich has fashioned a remarkably 
thin story about a first-time writer.  Fully three quarters of the movie 
elapses before it finally gets to the big "plagiarism" incident, which 
like every twist is telegraphed way in advance.  Although Rich pads the 
story with many inconsequential incidents, he permits us just one 
glimpse at Jamal's writings.  The lone example shows only that Jamal 
picks heart-felt, close-to-home subjects.  We get no sense of his 
literary abilities.  We are allowed, mainly in practice sessions, to 
view some of his basketball prowess, but that isn't important since the 
point of the film, after all, is his writing.
Jamal's mentor is a Pulitzer Prize winner, William Forrester (Sean 
Connery), who lives a hermit's existence in an old apartment above the 
court where Jamal and his buddies play basketball.  William, who will 
remind many of J.D. Salinger, wrote one book a half century ago and 
quit.  No longer venturing from his place, he has food and fresh sox 
brought to him, and he views the world like a voyeur from his apartment 
window.  On a dare, Jamal sneaks into William's apartment.  Accidentally 
leaving behind his writings, Jamal gets them thrown back with comments 
both snide ("constipated thinking") and encouraging ("This passage is 
fantastic.") scrawled on them by William.
Brown and Connery deliver nice, albeit not exceptional, performances.  
The easy going chemistry between them has remarkably few rough edges and 
is a pleasure to watch.
William's teaching style is to let Jamal, using an old typewriter, take 
William's words as a starting point and to mold them into his own.  As 
Jamal bangs away on the keyboard, William throws out homilies such as, 
"The first key to writing is to write, not to think."  And they agree 
that starting a sentence with a conjunction is a good writing choice 
even if it does violate some old-fashioned rules.  But one shouldn't do 
it too often.
F. Murray Abraham plays the clichéd Professor Spence, a man who couldn't 
write so he teaches writing.  In fact -- you've got to love these 
coincidences -- it was none other than William himself who put the 
quietus on the good professor's last book attempt by calling his 
publishers and advising them not to publish it.   Let me give you a 
flavor of the level of predictability in the script.  Do you think that 
there will be a key confrontation scene late in the story between these 
two old protagonists?  Who would you guess will prevail?
Anna Paquin (THE PIANO) is completely wasted in an underwritten part as 
Jamal's friend, Claire.  Other than smile and talk about her rich father 
-- he fixed it so the school would go coed just so she could join -- 
Paquin doesn't have anything to do.  A big scene for her is one in which 
she puts her hand on Jamal's in order to reassure him that he will get 
past his one big crisis.
The film works best as a light comedy, and there are many satisfying, 
albeit small, laughs.  Generally, the movie aspires to be something 
more, but its retreaded dialog keeps getting in the way.  "God, he's a 
basketball player from the Bronx!" the professor says of Jamal, as a way 
to prove that Jamal must not have the intellectual capacity to be 
writing the papers that he has been turning in for credit.
Sometimes it is the small things that trouble you about a production.  
Mailor is supposed to be the best private school on the East Coast, and 
much is made of the importance of its basketball team.  When we finally 
see their games, Van Sant has set them in a gym so small that there 
isn't more than five feet on each side of the court, leaving room for no 
more than a few dozen fans.  And then they switch to a packed Madison 
Square Garden for the championship.  Sure.
Don't leave before the epilogue.  There is an Academy Award winner who 
acts in a little uncredited part.  If you like the movie, this epilogue 
could be the best part.  The film, however, left me relatively unmoved.  
Still, it is always good to see Connery, and newcomer Brown shows a lot 
of promise.
FINDING FORRESTER runs a little over two hours.  It is rated PG-13 for 
brief strong language and some sexual references and would be acceptable 
for kids around 12 and up.

William Forrester (Sean Connery), four decades ago, received the Pulitzer
Prize for his first and only novel, Avalon Landing, then seemed to drop
from the face of the earth. That is, until he crosses paths with 16-year
old Jamal Wallace (Rob Brown), an intelligent and talented neighborhood kid
who has the same passion for writing as the old recluse in Gus Van Sant's
"Finding Forrester."
Forrester is known in his Bronx neighborhood only as "The Window." The kids
playing basketball across the street see his shadowy figure looking out the
window of his run down brownstone, but no one knows anything about the man.
On a dare, Jamal agrees to sneak into the hermit's apartment and take
something as proof of his visit. The deep voiced, white haired man startles
the boy and, instead of procuring a trophy, he leaves his backpack
containing all his writing in the man's cluttered apartment. Jamal figures
that that's the last of it until the mystery man returns the pack - with
all of Jamal's notebooks annotated and graded. This begins a
teacher/student relationship that ends up going both ways, with each
learning life-changing lessons from the other.
I was struck, while watching "Finding Forrester," that I had been there
before, but I couldn't quite put my finger where and when, exactly. It
really isn't a mentor/apprentice flick like "The Karate Kid" where the
"kid" learns all manner of things from his guru that change his young life.
"Forrester" is a two-way road as the student/teacher relationship blurs
between Forrester and his protégé. As the story progresses, Jamal is not
the only one who gets to grow and mature both emotionally and
intellectually. By the end of the film, no surprise, the older man, too,
becomes a different, better person. Then, it dawned on me - "Man Without a
Face" and "Renaissance Man" both draw on the same premise. Unfortunately,
the two-way street story didn't work too well in either of those movies and
works only a little better in "Finding Forrester."
The reason that "Forrester" works better than other films of the same ilk
rests squarely on the shoulders of young Rob Brown. The newcomer, a
non-actor until now, literally dominates the screen with a fresh,
self-assured presence that allows Brown to play opposite the veteran
Connery like a true equal. Brown exhibits no tentativeness in his character
and delivers his soliloquies and intellectual bon mots with a certain hand.
When Jamal is derided by a snobbish yuppie as being ignorant about his
precious car, a BMW, the young man lets the guy have it with a complete
history of the marque that leaves the snob speechless. Brown pulls this and
other speeches off with a natural cadence that rings true. Plus, his
deftness at playing basketball (an important point of the story) only adds
to his character. It is an impressive debut performance that raises the
whole film up a notch.
Sean Connery is a seasoned thespian who has achieved worldwide icon status,
so there are certain expectations whenever he stars in a movie. He has
transitioned from the cool, suave James Bond persona into a senior
statesman of the acting profession. Now, he is usually positioned as the
wise sage who dispenses his knowledge to his various neophytes (see "Name
of the Rose," "The Untouchables," "Rising Sun" and "Entrapment," among
others). He does that in "Forrester," but with a more vulnerable spin on
the character. The vet thesp does not try to upstage his costar, either,
allowing the younger actor to effectively play off of Connery's character.
Supporting cast is left to fill out the background without intruding on the
action too much. F. Murray Abraham plays high school teacher Robert
Crawford, a less talented contemporary of William Forrester who questions
Jamal's education abilities when the boy gets a scholarship to Crawford's
prestigious private school. He's too obviously a device to allow the
arrogant teacher to get his comeuppance from Jamal and William by the end
of the flick. Anna Paquin is a fellow student of Jamal's at his new school.
The pretty young actress comes on strong, but her character becomes
ambiguous as a hint of romance with Jamal is introduced but goes nowhere,
as if the makers didn't have the guts to play out an inter-racial
relationship. Busta Rhymes, in the small part as Jamal's parking lot
supervisor brother Terrell, is a funny character, providing much of the
comic relief for the film. Other supporting parts are generic, including
Michael Nouri as Paquin's father.
The main attraction of novice screenwriter Mike Rich's script is the dialog
afforded to Connery and Brown, especially Brown. A film about the art and
craft of writing should have some discussion of the nuts and bolts of that
craft. Rich provides a good deal of such discussion, effectively, between
the two characters, often times to intellectually funny ends. Otherwise,
the story follows routine lines as Jamal faces the scandal and accusation
of plagiarism and Forrester overcomes his own fears to come out of his
reclusion and help his young friend.
Helmer Gus Van Sant, known for his edgy, independent filmmaking, like
"Drugstore Cowboy" and "My Own Private Idaho," has gone mainstream in
recent years. His "Good Will Hunting" brought him to "Hollywood." His
remake of Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho" smacked of acceptance of Van Sant (if
not his lovingly crafted remake) by the big guys on the West Coast.
"Finding Forrester" lacks any of the helmer's earlier distinctive directing
style. It is straightforward, routine storytelling that lacks Van Sant's
mark, but helps make him a directing attraction for conventional movies.
Tech credits are solid, although the editor (Valdis Oskarsdottir) could
have used some judicious direction in cutting the film down from its near
140 minute run time to something that would have kept the movie tighter and
more viewable. As it is, you expect what is going to happen early on and I
got impatient waiting for the final resolution of the tale to get under
way.
"Finding Forrester" should get a decent draw, initially, because of its
megastar Connery, but the real reason to see it is for the remarkable debut
of Rob Brown. Now, here is a kid who is worth the price of admission. I
give it a B-.

Almost three years to the day after the release of Good Will Hunting,
Finding Forrester hits theatres with a similar but equally effective
story.  The connection extends beyond just a comparable script, since
both films were directed by Gus Van Sant.  Even more remarkable is the
source of the two scripts  the first was an out-of-left-field Oscar
winner penned by two struggling actors (Matt Damon and Ben Affleck),
while the second comes via a Portland radio personality.  And I won't
even get started on the surprise cameo in Forrester's epilogue.
Replacing Damon's Will Hunting is 16-year-old Jamal Wallace (Robert
Brown, in his acting debut), a promising basketball player and C-student
at Bronx's Coolidge High School.  Like Will, Jamal is whip-smart, but
hides his talent because he doesn't want to stand out.  He reads all the
heavy-hitters that usually scare off kids his age and even writes
religiously in a journal, which has recently grown into its fifth
volume.
One night, Jamal is dared by his friends to break into the apartment of
a ghost-like local legend known as The Window (a name garnered from
wielding a pair of binoculars from his third-story window).  Jamal gets
in to the mystery man's home, but he's spooked and accidentally leaves
his backpack (with journals) behind.
The next day, The Window (Sean Connery, Entrapment) unceremoniously
drops Jamal's backpack to the street, where the surprised student
discovers his journals have been covered in red pen corrections,
culminating with one question on the last page  `Where are you taking
me?'  Curious, Jamal goes to The Window's apartment, where the two
slowly develop a rapport revolving around writing.
What Jamal doesn't know is that hard-drinking man is really William
Forrester, the reclusive author of `Avalon Landing,' a Pulitzer
Prize-winning work heralded as The Great American Novel of the 20th
Century. Forrester disappeared after achieving incredible fame through
his first novel and has spent the last few decades holed up in his Bronx
apartment avoiding everyone and everything (a la J.D. Salinger and his
`The Catcher in the Rye').
When Jamal transfers to Manhattan prep school Mailor/Callow, he is
greeted with open arms because of his basketball abilities.  Nobody in
the school thinks he could possibly be interested in an education and,
as a result, Jamal grows a major chip on his shoulder because everybody
assumes he's some dumb black kid.  Meanwhile, Forrester is similarly
pissed at the world for assuming they know what his novel was really
about.  The two stories are nicely paralleled, without being too
obvious.
The antagonist in Forrester is a stuffy prick English professor (played
by F. Murray Abraham) who doesn't believe Jamal is capable of the
writing assignments he's been turning in.  The film comes together over
a writing contest at Mailor/Callow, which, although entirely
predictable, had me a bit choked up.
Van Sant, who followed up his Oscar-nominated Hunting with an
ill-advised, Razzie-winning, shot-for-shot remake of Hitchcock's Psycho,
does a fantastic job here with deejay Mike Rich's script.  Forrester
opens with a series of lovely shots of the Bronx and remains remarkably
well-paced throughout.  Even the basketball action is done nicely, and
better than we've recently seen in Love and Basketball and He Got Game,
which is pretty surprising, considering Van Sant is, essentially, an
indie film director.
Actingwise, Connery can do no wrong, no matter how lowly the project
(see Entrapment for further proof), but newcomer Brown steals the show
as the jaded teen whose life is altered by a chance encounter.  Anna
Paquin (Almost Famous) does a good job in her supporting role as Jamal's
classmate, and, thankfully, the film isn't slowed down by an unneeded
relationship between the two.  Technically, Forrester is a slick little
package, wonderfully photographed by The Yards' Harris Savides and
edited by Valdis Oskarsdóttir, the veteran of three Dogme films.

Jamal Wallace (newcomer Rob Brown) loves to read and write in his journals,
but hides this fact from his family and buddies in the Bronx.  In public, he
spends his time playing basketball at a local court watched over by a 
mysterious stranger from a window in an old building.  On a dare, Jamal
enters the stranger's apartment, but is frightened by the old man who lives
there and runs, leaving his backpack.  This fortuitous event will be the 
beginning of an unusual mentorship and great friendship in "Finding Forrester."
"Finding Forrester" skates in upon a slate of comparisons to director Gus
van Sant's own "Good Will Hunting."  While there are similarities, the new
film has quite a different feel than the Boston blue collar drama.
Jamal sees his backpack hanging in that mysterious window - is it a taunt?
an invitation?  He resists, and wins, when the pack suddenly lands at his
feet in the street one day.  Reunited with his beloved journals, Jamal is
first shocked, then intrigued to find that his writings have been marked up
like school assignments by an obviously intelligent and interested reader.
A few false starts later, and Jamal meets the stranger, a gruff, Scotch
swilling Scotsman (Sean Connery) who gradually opens up, pleased to share
a love of the written word.  Then Jamal's secret is blown with his mother
and brother Terrell (Busta Rhymes, "Shaft") when test scores reveal his 
intelligence and result in a scholarship to Mailer Callow, a Manhattan prep 
school that needs a winning basketball team.
At Mailer Callow, Jamal, a black teen from the Bronx,  must navigate the world 
of the white and wealthy.  Claire (Anna Paquin, "X-Men") steps in to lead
the way, beginning another odd relationship for Jamal.  When his story's
conflict arrives it's twofold.  Jamal discovers that his Scottish friend is
William Forrester, a J. D. Salinger-like reclusive legend, who obviously
wishes Jamal to keep his identity secret.  Professor Crawford (F. Murray
Abraham), a failed author and Forrester devotee, doesn't believe a boy from
the Bronx is capable of writing Jamal's words and sets out to discredit him.
While Mike Rich's screenplay doesn't offer any real surprises, sometimes
dipping into cliche, rebounding with good dialogue, the amazing chemistry 
between veteran actor Connery and the untrained Brown is palpable.  Brown, 
who answered a casting call in hopes of getting wages as an extra to
pay off a cell phone bill, is one of the year 2000's great acting discoveries.
Brown gives Jamal grace, confidence and smarts, holding his own against the 
Scottish Oscar winner.  Rob Brown is the main reason to see this film.
Connery also gives a fine performance, but isn't given as much to work with.
Support is OK, but only Busta Rhymes as Jamal's brother and the (uncreditted?)
actress who plays his mom really distinguish themselves.  Abraham is a bit too
patently villainish.
Van Sant's tech crew does a fine job, with fluid camerwork by Harris Savides
("The Yards") and nuanced art direction by Jane Musky ("At First Sight").
Unfortunately, he allows his film to play for over two hours and the
material doesn't warrant it.  A cutesy cameo at film's end may have seemed
a good idea at the time, but calls too much attention to itself, working
against the cinematic experience.  Still, "Finding Forrester" is a solid
entry into the 'teacher/student' genre and the first film of a potential new
star.

Directed by Gus Van Sant, the story focuses on a young man with intellectual
gifts beyond those of his fellow peers. A boy with a soft heart, little
faith in himself and no real desire to stand out. A kid who only begins to
believe in his own self-worth when taken under the wings of an older, wiser
man, who himself, has also got issues to overcome. That was the plot line
for GOOD WILL HUNTING, a film which garnered an Oscar in screenwriting for
the buddy-acting duo out of Boston, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. Three years
later, director Gus Van Sant has decided to take another shot at a very,
very similar film. In my humble opinion, the former was a much better movie.
This one is only passable. And the cameo is cute, but more distracting than
anything.
PLOT:
A young black man living in the Bronx is dared by his friends to break into
the house of an older man considered by all to be nothing more than a
hermit. After their initial encounter, the two strike up a friendship as the
older gentleman helps the younger one improve his writing skills. It turns
out that he is none other than William Forrester, a long-lost writer who
penned one incredible novel over 50 years ago and then disappeared.
CRITIQUE:
The great performance given here by first-time actor Rob Brown and the
semi-inspirational story of the film doesn't save it from feeling déjŕ vu,
telegraphing most of its scenes from the start and wasting plenty of its
side characters. Other than the main duo in this film, who did provide for
some great moments and solid chemistry, the rest of the cast here felt quite
underwritten. Anna Paquin is barely given any soul, Busta Rhymes is funny
but presented with little background and none of Brown's friends in the
movie have anything more than a few lines to distinguish themselves. The
worst case goes out to F. Murray Abraham, who is nothing more than a
one-dimensional "road-block" inserted into the story for obvious conflict
reasons. With that in mind, his character's shenanigans didn't really
provide for any real tension, since his obvious "destructive" nature, left
little doubt as to the film's outcome. Anybody who has seen even one other
"inspirational" movie should be able to see what is ultimately going to
happen once the relationship between Connery and Brown blossoms. But even
more importantly, their story simply did not pull me in emotionally. Brown
was really good as the young boy with the genius brewing under his tough
exterior, but Connery was simply okay as the crabby Scottish drunken guy.
I don't know, maybe I just predicted too much of this film from the get-go,
but I can't imagine anyone else not doing the same. And with very little
development around the two main protagonists of the story, I just didn't get
into their characters as much as I was hoping to. I would have liked more
background on both of them as well. The little we did learn wasn't enough to
satisfy all of my queries. And despite the film moving at a decent pace
(it's long but I didn't feel it go by), Van Sant made some very odd choices
in directing, which stood out for me as a viewer. The slo-mo shots seemed
out of place in this straight-forward drama and the final speech given by
one of the characters was drowned out by a grand score, meant to tug at us
emotionally. Only I was left wondering what the words were that he was
saying. I mean, the film is about writers after all and yet we are barely
treated to any words written by either of the two main players. That was too
bad. With that in mind, I would suggest anyone interested in this topic to
check out WONDER BOYS starring Michael Douglas. That film also covers just
about the same points made in this one, only it focuses more on the older
character instead of the younger one, and does provide for a much stronger
story and better developed secondary characters. All in all, this movie was
an interesting watch, mainly because of the great chemistry between the two
leads, but left me with very little to take home and even less to recommend
to others.

 It's tempting to call this another version of Gus Van Sant's
"Good Will Hunting," because it's about a brilliant, struggling
student, or "Scent of a Woman," since it deals with a young man and
his mentor, but I think it stands on its own. Newcomer Rob Brown plays
Jamal, a South Bronx teen who's fascinated by "the window," a
mysterious man who stares down at the guys shooting hoops in the
'hood. On a dare, Jamal sneaks into his book-cluttered apartment,
where he's discovered by its occupant. Terrified, he flees, leaving
his backpack behind. The next day, the backpack is thrown down from
"the window" and his six journals, filled with thoughts and essays,
have been critiqued in red ink. Thus, an unlikely friendship
develops. "The window" turns out to be William Forrester, a reclusive
author - think J.D. Salinger - who, 50 years ago, published one
Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. And Jamal winds up in a posh Manhattan
prep school where he's welcomed for his ability on the basketball
court but challenged about his incredible flair for creative writing
by a bitter, autocratic teacher, F. Murray Abraham, who accuses him of
plagiarism. Problem is: Mike Rich's screenplay is familiar,
predictable and not particularly believable. As the gruff, neurotic
novelist, Sean Connery is charismatic, exuding eccentricities,
defending his isolation, gulping J&B and wearing socks inside out. Rob
Brown is convincing, like rapper Busta Rhymes, as his brother, and
Anna Paquin, as his friend/love interest. Joey Buttafuco plays a
security guard and there's a "surprise" cameo near the conclusion. On
the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Finding Forrester" is an
inspirational 7, proclaiming, "Family isn't always what you're born
with - sometimes it's the people you find, sometimes it's the people
who find you."

     Two films back Gus Van Sant had a large success with GOOD WILL
HUNTING.  The public seemed to go in a big way for this story of a
blue collar mathematics genius. (Mine was one of the few dissenting
opinions and mostly for the unlikelihood of the premise.)  Van
Sant's follow-up made a definite thud with an almost scene-for-scene
remake of the classic PSYCHO.  PSYCHO is one of those films that one
ought not to remake.  Van Sant needs another success to show that
GOOD WILL HUNTING was not just a fluke.  He really has to have
another GOOD WILL HUNTING.  Sadly that is rather transparently what
he was trying a little too hard to make.  He took the premise of his
former success and doctored it to be an even surer success.  First
he plays the race card.  This time his hero is not just a blue
collar worker, he is a really deserving sixteen-year-old black
writer who is trying to succeed in an academic world dominated by
white males, some of them nasty.  Coming to a new and posh school a
rich white girl takes an interest in our young writer, and you know
immediately they are going to hit it off.  Why?  Van Sant is taking
no chances.  If they fight the script will have to make one of them
right.  It can not make a white right in a conflict with a black or
a man right in a conflict with a woman.  Neither would be safe
filmmaking, so the clearly can be no conflict between the two of
them.  Then to make the film even safer there is a big part for Sean
Connery as a great writer who takes our deserving lad under his
wing.  Connery makes few films that do not succeed and here he even
was one of the producers.  Retread concept, political correctness,
and Sean Connery: this is Van Sant playing it super-safe.  Oh, yes,
and did I mention there is also a "big game"?
     Outwardly, Jamal Wallace (played by Robert Brown) seems like
just about any other ghetto kid.  Well, he is great at basketball.
But privately Jamal likes to read the great works of Western
literature.  And then he has his notebooks where he writes his
thoughts that he does not want to share with the world.  In this
Bronx neighborhood there is a strange old man who never leaves his
apartment.  He just stares out the window at the passing parade and
does who knows what else.  He just looms as a presence over the
neighborhood.
     On a dare Jamal breaks into the strange apartment and is about
to steal something small to prove he was there but is frightened off
leaving behind his backpack with his writings.  The old man
eventually gives the backpack back, but the notebooks have been
marked up with the critical comments that could only come from a
great writer.  It is the kind of tutelage that Jamal desperately
wants.  The recluse turns out to be the great William Forrester
(Sean Connery), the J. D. Salinger-like writer who wrote one great
novel and then never published again.
     Meanwhile Jamal has attracted the attention of a prestigious
school who wants the students for his basketball skills and only
secondarily for the potential that his test scores show he has.  But
there is pressure in the new school to push Jamal into the
basketball track while his writing teacher Professor Crawford (F.
Murray Abraham) finding his writing getting better and better
bigotedly suspects Jamal of cheating.
     There is not doubt that the best part of the film is the
writing lessons which are written with insight.  Suggestions like
writing first from the heart and then rewriting from the mind sound
useful, though they may be a little obvious.  And they are a special
treat delivered by the charismatic Connery who, though not known for
his writing ability, has the hypnotic style that would make even
toilet repair sound enthralling.
     This is the second film I have seen this year photographed by
Harris Savides, the other being THE YARDS.  I definitely see a
pattern forming.  Both are films in film noir style with overuse of
dimly lit scenes.  Many of the scenes really seem to be carved from
the darkness.  In Forrester's apartment the lighting is so muted
that shadows on Connery join with the background darkness.
Crawford's classroom is also filmed in dim and downbeat style.
Scenes are frequently washed out.  It feels to me like this is
manipulation, though in a better film it might more sympathetically
be called style.  In any case there seems to be an excess of it
here.
     By trying too hard to be successful, this film rarely rises
above mediocrity.  I rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the
-4 to +4 scale.  I did like the writing lesson, but with that
exception everything I ever needed to know about FINDING FORRESTER I
got from watching the trailer.

Directed by Gus Van Sant. Screenplay by Mike Rich. Starring Sean Connery,
Robert Brown, F Murray Abraham. Running time: 135 minutes. Rated PG for
mild language by the MFCB. Reviewed on January 20th, 2001.
Of all the possible choices of career or hobby, writing is hardly the most 
glorious. It is, in general, a solitary pursuit, the sort of thing on 
which a person can labour for days, months, even years, and have little to 
show for it (or, at least, little of true quality). Writers are usually 
invisible behind their work, and even when an author does have the 
opportunity to discuss his metier in public, the content of the questions 
rarely rises above the cliche of, "Where do you get your ideas?"
It is refreshing, then, to have experienced "Finding Forrester", a movie 
which is not only about an author (in fact, two of them), but which 
depicts both the joy which comes from writing and the tenacity it demands. 
It is about much more than that, of course -- it is a coming of age story, 
and a teacher/student story, and a story about fighting injustice. But 
whereas director Gus Van Sant's "Good Will Hunting" -- to which "Finding 
Forrester" bears both notable similarities and enormous differences -- was 
about a mathematics prodigy but could have chosen any number of other 
subjects for the title character's expertise, writing is a fundamental 
component of "Finding Forrester".
Jamal Wallace (Robert Brown) is a black teenager growing up in the Bronx. 
He's a smart kid, but in order to gain acceptance with his peers, he only 
does enough classwork to pull off a C average, and instead concentrates 
his skills on the basketball court. The only outlet he permits his mind is 
his writing, which he keeps secret. Then two events occur, almost 
simultaneously, which force Jamal to rethink the direction of his life. 
First, his top marks on standardised tests invite the interest of a 
prestigious private school, which offers him a full scholarship and a 
chance at a very different life. Second, a friendly dare prompts Jamal to 
sneak into the apartment of a reclusive old man known only as "the 
Window".
When the Window scares Jamal away, the boy accidentally leaves behind his 
journals, filled with the stories he wrote. When he retrieves the 
notebooks, Jamal discovers that the Window has included critical comments 
on every page. Eventually, Jamal convinces the old man to speak with him 
face to face, and it turns out that the Window is Robert Forrester (Sean 
Connery), a Pulitzer Prize winner who wrote "the great American novel" 
half a century ago and hasn't been seen or heard from since. Forrester 
reluctantly agrees to become Jamal's mentor, while Jamal tries to 
penetrate the mystery of what caused Forrester to abandon the outside 
world.
Much of "Finding Forrester"'s success is derived from the two central 
actors. Connery is back in fine form after a drought of good starring 
roles. He captures all the key elements of Forrester's personality: his 
eccentricity, his paranoia, his tragedy, his innate benevolence, and most 
importantly, his love of writing. Although this is a role that could 
easily have been taken to extremes by a lesser actor, Connery never 
indulges himself. Consider the scene where Forrester finally emerges from 
his apartment only to panic when he finds himself alone in the midst of a 
bustling crowd. Instead of playing up character's response, Connery keeps 
his reactions subdued; he makes us feel Forrester's anxiety, rather than 
forcing it down our throats.
Newcomer Brown proves to be a real find, his performance here at least as 
much of a breakout as Matt Damon's was in "Good Will Hunting". Brown 
brings an extremely natural feel to the film; I have no idea what his 
background actually is, but he certainly made me believe he had grown up 
in an environment not unlike Jamal's. Despite the fact that Connery has 
decades more acting experience, Brown is a good match for the veteran 
performer, holding his own in scenes of considerable emotion and power.
The screenplay by Mike Rich is a tremendous piece of work, an excellent 
example of how economy in writing leads to a better product. In between 
the lines of the central storyline about Jamal's relationship with 
Forrester, Rich slips in a number of secondary tales -- Jamal's efforts to 
fit in at the private school (epitomised by a not-so-friendly rivalry on 
the basketball court), his budding romance with rich white student Claire 
(Anna Paquin), his difficulty maintaining ties with his friends from his 
old high school, and his need to decide between writing and basketball as
his true passion. During the movie, I started to fear that some of these 
threads would go underdeveloped, only to discover as the credits rolled 
that this was by no means the case. Rich tells each aspect of the film in 
perfect measure, for the most part neither leaving his subplots stillborn 
nor dwelling on them any more than necessary.
It's not all perfect -- one major storyline, in which Jamal is accused of 
plagiarism by a jealous teacher (F Murray Abraham) who doesn't believe a 
basketball player from the Bronx could possess such talent, is a little 
too familiar. The way it plays out recalls the denouement of "Scent Of A 
Woman" and many other films; it's a surprising concession from an 
otherwise highly creative movie. Paquin's character also goes slightly 
astray in the picture's closing minutes, as the subplot about her and 
Jamal never really reaches fruition. It's as though one last scene between 
them was accidentally omitted from the final cut. This is a particular 
shame because Paquin, as usual, gives a bright and energetic performance.
But whatever the faults of the screenplay, they are minor, and more than 
compensated for by Van Sant's excellent direction. There is an unusual 
liveliness to "Finding Forrester", and this is particularly impressive 
given the static nature of the subject material. Van Sant gives 
Forrester's lessons a palpable verve. It's enough to make you wonder why 
all English teachers can't be this passionate, and why they aren't all 
this successful at communicating that passion to their pupils.
