        Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) is the world's most beloved
actress.  While in London to promote her latest film, she
wanders
into a dilapidated bookstore run by Will Thacker (Hugh Grant),
the
even more dilapidated owner.  Anna is charmed by Will's amiable
personality, and the fact that he treats her like a person as
opposed to a celebrity.  A second accidental meeting later on
sets the amour wheels in motion... as well as the inevitable
complications stemming from their vastly different backgrounds.
        There's nothing new about the structure of "Notting
Hill";
the "rich girl falls for poor boy" scenario is
well-established,
having been employed in movies ranging from "Titanic" to
Disney's
"Lady and the Tramp," and the delights of the film certainly
owe
nothing to the formulaic way in which the story devlops.
Still,
the movie does offer some pleasant surprises along its journey
to
Happily Ever After-ville.  The biggest one: the performances.
Although the lead actors are fine (and Hugh Grant is
significantly
more than that), the show is stolen by the strong supporting
cast,
which include a wheelchair-bound woman that Will has always
loved...
despite the fact that she's married to his best friend.  Will's
little sister is pleasantly freaky, stuck working in London's
worst record store to make ends meet.  Comic relief is provided
by Will's sleezy roommate Spike (Rhys Ifans), the Jar Jar Binks
of the story.  I was quite frankly more interested in learning
more about these folks than I was in seeing the outcome of the
tale itself, primarily because they were all so interesting and
unusual.
        Visual grace is not Roger Michell's strong point.  Most
of the time he chooses to simply point the camera at his cast
and turn it on, allowing the sweet chemistry between his two
lead
actors and the clever screenplay from Richard Curtis to carry
the
momentum.   Much has been made of the fact that the movie was
actually shot in the Notting Hill region of London, but we
never
get to see very much of it, and that's a little disappointing.
Too much of the film plays like a montage of talking heads:
there's a lot of dialogue, and not much else.  There are,
however,
two amazing shots that I must make mention of.  The first is
the
impressive pullback of Anna and Will sitting alone on a park
bench,
enjoying a rare moment of privacy together.  Through the
pullback,
the camera not only allows them a much-deserved moment of
solitude,
but also foreshadows a later discussion on perspective, a scene
upon which the whole movie hinges.  There's also a great
weather
montage: Michell shows the passage of several months by having
Will walk down the street, through bright sunlight, into rain,
then snow, and back into the sunlight again, all in one
continuous shot, while Bill Withers' "Ain't No Sunshine" plays
softly in the background.
        "Notting Hill" isn't really a film about relationships
so much as the concept of 'celebrity.'  We're given a glimpse
into
the claustrophobic life of a big-name movie star, watching as
her
personal life is basically irradicated before our very eyes.
It's
undeniably interesting... but surprisingly, it's not really
involving on an emotional level.  Although Grant and Roberts
look
great together, I had trouble believing their relationship.
The
script flings them together much too quickly-- the first kiss
occurs after they've been together only a handful of minutes.
Nor
did I understand why Grant's character, so charming and
intelligent,
was utterly smitten with a woman who treats him so horribly.
It's
probably not a good sign when, while watching a romantic
comedy,
you're hoping the guy will dump the girl and find someone who
actually deserves his affections.  I can understand the lure
and
appeal of Hollywood glitz and fairy dust, but they should not
be
a key factor in deciding whether or not to pursue a
relationship
with a person.
        There are some problems with the film--and significant
ones--
but in the end I was won over by the movie's utter sweetness
and
great comedy.  I don't often laugh out loud at the theater, but
"Notting Hill" got me on at least five occasions, and had the
rest of the audience rolling in the aisles as well.  It's that
beloved rarity: a romantic comedy in which the humor is
actually
given the same amount of attention as the love story.  The
touching
but hilarious scene in which Will poses as a reporter for
"Horse and
Hound" magazine simply so he can be near his beloved shows both
the absurdity of love, and the lengths to which people will go
to
keep it.  The entire movie is full of gems like this.
        "Notting Hill" is a paint-by-numbers story, completely
predictable from start to finish... but since the ride was an
entertaining one, I have absolutely no problem with that.

A couple of years ago, I watched as a visibly uncomfortable Freddie 
Prinze Jr. was paraded in front of reporters like a prize steer 
during a promotional appearance in Hollywood. As the cameras flashed 
and the emcee pummeled him with a series of stunningly inane 
questions, the young actor looked desperate to get out of the room. 
The next day, I spoke with Prinze about the incident and he 
acknowledged that the experience was awful, adding, "To be honest, 
I'm still kind of learning how to do the celebrity stuff. It's not 
what I got into the business for. I understand that it's part of the 
job, but I'm not very good at it."
The British love story "Notting Hill" examines the pitfalls of fame 
and does a surprisingly good job at it. Regular readers know that I 
have little tolerance for most contemporary romantic comedies. 
Watching a glamorous couple meet cute, fall in love, scamper about 
while pop songs play in the background, fight over some contrived 
situation and, flung back together by ridiculous coincidence, make up 
just in time for one more song usually makes my skin crawl. but I 
surrendered to the charms of "Notting Hill." 
The script, by "Four Weddings and a Funeral" writer Richard Curtis, 
follows the Romantic Comedy 101 formula religiously, but hits enough 
high notes to triumph over the clichés. What really makes this film 
special, though, is the exceptional work of Julia Roberts and Hugh 
Grant. 
Before "Notting Hill," Hugh Grant consistently left me cold. His 
acting technique, a combination of excessive blinking, twitching and 
stammering, was disquieting, to say the least. It's hard to enjoy a 
man who appears to be in desperate need of nervous-tic medication. 
Thankfully, he tones down the mannerisms this time around. As William,
 the quiet owner of a small London bookstore, Grant creates an 
engaging character. Kind, but self-contained, he projects a sweet 
sadness as a man who, having lost at love, finds comfort by wrapping 
himself in a blanket of benign depression. William's safe little 
cocoon soon unravels when American movie star Anna Scott walks into 
his shop. 
As Anna, Julia Roberts is a revelation. Radiant as always, Roberts 
also shows remarkable depth here, perhaps because of her familiarity 
with the circumstances. Like Roberts, Anna is a superstar whose mere 
presence creates a sensation. Accustomed to non-stop scrutiny, she 
has developed an elaborate veneer and an equally sensitive defensive 
system. When she detects betrayal, she is quick to strike out at the 
offender, as happens in one of the film's most arresting scenes. 
Because of Robert's wonderfully nuanced performance, I completely 
believed in Anna and empathized with her plight. How hard it must be 
to strive for success in the arts, only to find yourself caged in a 
zoo of celebrity that never closes.   
Roberts and Grant interact beautifully, gliding over the numerous 
bumps in the production. Curtis' script contains many sweet moments, 
surrounded by virtually every cliché in the book. I noted each 
formula situation, but instead of becoming irritated, I was content 
to let them roll by, knowing another treat was soon to come. Yes, 
William's gross-out roommate (Rhys Ifans) plays like a gimmick with 
legs, but Anna's nonplused reaction to him is so perfect. Yes, the 
camera needlessly emphasizes the gawkish appearance of William's 
working class extended family, but what an appealing family they are. 
One contrivance I couldn't excuse was an extended scene at a press 
junket, where William must pretend to be a reporter to keep an 
appointment with Anna. After their conversation, he is swept into a 
series of one-on-one interviews with the other actors from her film. 
In the real world, junket security is air-tight, one-on-one 
interviews are rare and actors never, ever ask your opinion of their 
movie. In a story where dramatic credibility hinges on realistic 
portrayals of media-celebrity exchanges, the scene is just sloppy 
writing. To make matters worse, it goes on too long with too few 
laughs.
But enough carping. Better to think of the picturesque Notting Hill 
marketplace, or the delightful birthday dinner, or the striking 
passage-of-time shot showing William walking down the street as the 
seasons change around him, or the wonderful crane shot in the park, 
when the camera glides up into the night sky, adding a lyrical 
perspective to the couple below. And what a couple. Thanks to Hugh 
Grant and the luminous Julia Roberts, "Notting Hill" works, both as a 
love story and as a reminder that those figures ducking the paparazzi 
are just other people, as lost, foolish and essential as you and I.

In Roger Michell's romantic comedy NOTTING HILL, William Thacker (Hugh
Grant) leads a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel
bookshop in the quaint section of London which lends it's name to the
film's title.  One day, American movie superstar Anna Scott (Julia
Roberts) walks in to purchase a book on Turkey.  Quickly enamored of
each other, the two embark upon an on-again, off-again love affair
replete with romance, humor, and the occasional lump in the throat.
The film opens with a non-verbal cue to Anna's stardom as the title
credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the
actress's appearances in films and at premieres - coming out of
limousines, walking the red carpets and such.  Without words, this
sequence gives us a background to her character.  Following, however,
is a set-up narration by William indicating what he does and where he
lives.  I don't know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration
which tells us nothing we couldn't have figured out by watching the
first ten minutes of film, and which never resurfaces after the
movie's beginning, but there it is.  If there were ever a clear case
for "less is more," this would be it.
The film is told nearly first person from William's point of view, as
he is in every scene.  By nature of this arrangement, we get a very
definite sense of what he is all about, and his nice guy personality
wins us over easily.  In fact, much of NOTTING HILL's strength lies in
the great dialog written for this character by Richard Curtis.  A
scene where William is still in shock over the fact that he's even
talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles
through his attempt to offer her some honey-soaked apricots from his
refrigerator.  Or take an instance where Anna kisses William and asks
him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image.
William assures her he wouldn't say a word, then adds, "Well, I'll
probably tell myself now and then, but I'd never believe it."  Great
stuff.
The downside to spending so much time with William is that we don't
get to see enough of Anna to make their relationship whole and
plausible.  We're constantly exposed to William's thoughts, feelings,
actions and desires, but don't actually get the sense of how much Anna
really feels for him.  There are a couple of instances where she
declares her obvious interest, but they nearly come out of nowhere due
to the fact that we're not sure what she's been thinking all the times
in between.  This, combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time
between the two, makes this Hugh Grant's film hands down.  He gets the
great scenes (look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer
from Horse and Hound magazine in order to speak with Anna), the great
lines, and gives an overall wonderful performance.  Julia Roberts fans
will probably be disappointed by the actress's top billing and
subsequent lack of involvement in the film (ala Sandra Bullock in A
TIME TO KILL) along with her detached performance which is only
worsened by her character's unpredictable behavior.  Anna doesn't get
a lot of our compassion.
This romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the
romance, much of it supplied by Grant himself, but with considerable
help from the supporting cast.  Most notable is Rhys Ifans as Spike,
William's eccentric roommate, who is in the film for no other purpose
than to make us laugh.  Hugh Bonneville, Emma Chambers, James Dreyfus,
and Gina McKee bring up the guard as William's friends and family,
particularly shining in a scene where William brings Anna to his
sister's birthday dinner, and we get to see how these common folks
react to the presence of a movie star in their midst.  It's a scene
most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms
were we faced with a similar situation.
Roger Michell's use of visuals doesn't sweep us off our feet, but does
give us more than your typical movie of this type.  For example, there
are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time
pass.  Whereas some films are content to simply put in a caption
saying "eight months later," Michell presents us with more interesting
cues, such as William's walk though his neighborhood while the seasons
change around him.  Another memorable shot occurs in a park where the
camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the
air.  We're generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted
from the earth to treetop level or so, but in this case, the camera
just keeps going up and up until we have a bird's eye view of the
ground below.
Music is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the film's
scenes, and some of this might have been better toned down, but in
other areas it works to full effect.  It's kind of a mixed bag, but
still fares better than many of today's lighthearted movies which are
so influenced by the MTV fare that the film becomes one long music
video.  At least this film has some pretty good music that for the
most part remains relevant and appropriate.
NOTTING HILL's Grant and Roberts will not go down in history as one of
the all-time greatest film pairings, but the chemistry is decent and
the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it.  For a
couple of hours, you should expect to laugh more than cry, and that's
not so bad, now is it?

NOTTING HILL *** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers ( nottinghill@filmfreakcentral.net )
starring Julia Roberts, Hugh Grant, Rhys Ifans, Gina McKee
screenplay by Richard Curtis
directed by Roger Michell
Notting Hill's trailer is awful: a laughless, schmaltzy montage. The
movie was desperately marketed to the anti-Phantom Menace crowd, the
same lovelorn females who ignored The Love Letter. And it apparently
worked. Perhaps the presence of Julia Roberts-whose allure beyond
those perfect teeth still escapes me-had a lot to do with Notting
Hill's opening weekend success, but the film's staying power is based
on word of mouth. Allow me to spread some more good buzz for Notting
Hill.
Grant stars as William Thacker, a travel-bookstore owner who works and
resides in a tiny English district called Notting Hill. Into his shop
one day wanders famous actress Anna Scott (Roberts). A common thief,
some spilled orange juice, and some stilted conversation leads to
their first, highly impetuous (or is that improbable?), kiss. Days
later, William sneaks into her hotel suite under the guise of a
magazine journalist, and so begins a passionate, albeit surreptitious,
affair. (Aside: Notting Hill's portrayal of press junkets is deadly
accurate.) Only Anna's celebrity-or William's lack thereof-threatens
to drive a wedge between them.
Richard Curtis has tapped into fantasy we all have considered, and for
at least its first half-hour the picture's "Beauty and the Beast"-like
scenario is (romantic) escapism of the highest order. As with
Groundhog Day or Pleasantville, while watching the high-concept comedy
Notting Hill one constantly imagines him/herself in the lead; it's
William's ordinaryness that entices the spoiled and bored Anna. Curtis
(who previously penned Four Weddings and a Funeral) is also smart
enough to know that the unlikely couple's situation is not enough to
fuel two hours' worth of entertainment, so some of Notting Hill's
finest moments revolve around William's eccentric friends and family.
By now, dear reader, you've probably heard a lot about Rhys Ifans'
performance as William's imbecilic Welsh flatmate. Yes, he's a crowd
pleaser, a walking sight gag, but his character is not nearly as
involving as the wheelchair-bound (and appropriately named) Bella
(McKee, the anguished waitress of Naked) or Max (Tom McInnerny), her 
lousy chef of a husband. In the movie's best sequence, William, Anna,
and company sit around bloated from Max's latest concoction and hold a
contest: the last brownie on the table goes to the diner with the
saddest life. The scene ends only as a British writer would end it.
If anything, fantastic bits like these dull the main plot's dramatic
impact. Roberts and Grant, especially, are appealing, but their
relationship is convolutedly interrupted too many times (Four
Weddings' suffered similar flaws), and William and Anna ultimately
only have one thing in common: they're lonely. (Worth noting in
Roberts' and Grant's favour: the ubiquitous "I'm just a girl, standing
across from a boy, asking him to love her" episode is not nearly so
syrupy as it appears in clips, and it features some of the best
emoting either actor has ever done.) Notting Hill is nonetheless
enjoyable; on the visual side of things, I especially appreciated
Michell's playful changing-of-the-seasons number. If only (and this is
a surprisinly minor gripe) he had lopped off the egregious epilogue;
for a story that thrives on what we bring to it, the filmmakers work
too hard to tidy things up, leaving our imaginations in the lurch.

In an inspired bit of casting, Julia Roberts plays Julia Roberts in a
princess and commoner story titled NOTTING HILL. Actually she uses the
name of Anna Scott, but we all know it's Roberts playing Roberts.
As Anna Scott, Roberts plays an extremely attractive star who spends her
life dodging photographers and making $15,000,000 a picture. Now, that's
a real stretch for her. What's amazing is how likable and vulnerable she
makes this poor little rich girl.
As exquisitely directed by Roger Michell and smartly scripted by Richard
Curtis, the movie easily transcends its highly contrived setup. This is
a comedic romance that makes you fall in love with love. And it's a
romantic comedy that produces huge laughs through dialog that relies on
wry wit rather than crude humor -- the polar opposite of THERE'S
SOMETHING ABOUT MARY.
Starring opposite Roberts is Hugh Grant as William Thacker, the
unassuming owner of a travel bookstore in a working class area of London
known as Notting Hill. Grant is called upon to play an awkward guy who's
shocked at his good fortune in having a movie star take an interest in
him.
For Grant, acting's master of awkwardness, playing Thacker would seem as
natural as it is for Roberts to play Scott. Indeed it is, but both
actors rise above roles in which autopilot performances might have
sufficed.  Their chemistry is a joy to behold, and their acting has
wonderful subtlety and grace.
As the movie opens, Thacker commutes his 1,000 yards to the office. A
divorced man, whose wife left him for a bloke who looked like Harrison
Ford, he get his pleasure from his happy, but fairly unsuccessful,
relatives and neighbors.
This day fortune strikes and the famous Anna Scott comes into his store.
Dumbstruck at first, finally he begins to babble and comes up with some
naturally funny little lines. [I once had a similar experience in a
small doctor's office in London in the 1970s, when Diana Rigg, the then
enormously popular star of "The Avengers," sat four feet away from me. I
know how Thacker must have felt.]
Luckily for him, he later rounds a street corner and clumsily spills
orange juice all over her blouse. This causes her to go to his flat to
change. When she leaves for what he assumes will be forever, he doesn't
know quite what to say. "It was nice to meet you," he tells her in a
daze. "Surreal, but nice."
This may already sound like every man's fantasy, and, if you're going to
dream, dream big. When she comes over and plants a big kiss on him, I
thought it might be a daydream sequence, but it wasn't.
"Probably best not to tell anyone about this," she admonishes him when
leaving. "Right, no one," he responds with sad seriousness. "I mean,
I'll tell myself sometime, but I won't believe it."
His irritating flatmate Spike is played in an over-the-top performance
by Rhys Ifans. Spike, with his prominent gold tooth, uncombed hair,
scruffy beard and perpetually dirty feet, supplies much of the movie's
more outlandish humor. A little of Spike can go a long way, which the
editor seems, thankfully, to have realized.
As you can guess, the acting princess does call the bookshop pauper
back. This introduces the problem of where to take her for their first
date. Perhaps something simple like tea at the Ritz?
In a case of mistaken identity, he is assumed to be at her hotel to see
her as part of her movie's press junket. Soon he takes on the identity
of a reporter from "Horse and Hound" magazine. After he speaks to her,
he's forced to ask questions of all of the other stars. [Here in New
York on a press junket myself for TARZAN, this scene hit home as well. I
wonder if I could have used some of his questions?]  At any rate, their
meeting is less than perfect as Scott, dressed in a business suit and
tie, apologizes for "that kissing thing."
>From this point their romance goes on and off. The players take the
movie to a level that should not be possible given the triteness of the
basic setup. Every scene, including the dinner with his family, comes
across with incredible honesty and warmth. One suspects that if your
brother brought Julia Roberts home to dinner it could well end up just
as it does in the movie.
Still, it is hard having a relationship with someone who has ten-foot
high pictures of her face painted on every bus in town, as they promote
her latest film. Falling in love with someone this famous, Thacker says
is like opening Pandora's Box. Think about it. If you've had a
relationship with Julia Roberts, don't you think you'd have a bit of
trouble trying to find someone else afterwards?
After scenes that are alternately sweet, funny, humorous, romantic and
poignant, the story finally comes to a close. As you realize it's time
for the characters to leave, you begin to miss them. The only question
is how will the writer end the story. Coming up with the movie's most
energetic moments, he ends it with an exhilarating sequence that dazzles
your mind and heart.
One of the key scenes of the movie has Thacker opening the door of his
apartment and being greeted by reporters who stick mikes in front of his
face, shine lights in his eyes, and shove a camera lens in front of him.
This happened to me the second I opened the door to exit the theater. A
reporter wanted my opinion of the film.
Pointing out how similar this real life experience was to the scene in
the movie, I asked where Julia Roberts was. He said she was in the lobby
waiting for me. Life in this case, I am sad to report, did not imitate
art.
NOTTING HILL runs 2:03 but feels much shorter. It is rated PG-13 for
some sexual situations and a little profanity and would be fine for kids
around 11 and up.
My son Jeffrey, aged 10, who saw the film back in California, said he
really enjoyed it and gave it ***.  He said he laughed a lot.  His only
complaints were that he didn't understand some of the humor, and he
didn't like some of the bad language.

Coincidentally, this key phrase in the movie also sums up the entire
film.  The whole thing seems like a surreal dream.  A nice, surreal
dream (has the horse been beaten enough yet?).  Let's face it, the
plot is ludicrous.  Almost as ludicrous, as, say, a prostitute falling
in love with her client.  Not that there is anything wrong with that.
In a season dominated by FX-laden blockbusters like Episode I, `The
Mummy,' and `The Matrix,' `Notting Hill' will provide a
welcome escape into fairy tale romance that the inner girl (okay,
inner boy too) in us all craves.  It's a movie for everyone
who's ever been starstruck.
Despite its overall success, the film is uneven at places.  From the
very beginning, awkward editing and abuse of rock music (a sadly
common event in the MTV era) threaten to eclipse the atmosphere, but
eventually the film picks up its own lighthearted yet slightly
bittersweet pace.  The selected soundtrack hits and misses, and the
score is often too cutesy and recycled (not only so, but cued at
similar scenes), but at dramatic intervals the swelling music is quite
effective.  The movie moves along at a fairly brisk place, but it does
not escape lagging in a few places (discussed later).  The romance
between Anna and William seems forced at first because of the very
rapidity with which it develops, but this becomes more acceptable as
we grow accustomed to the film's wonderland atmosphere.
While it *is* a romantic comedy (let's make that Comedy with a
capital C), it does not reduce secondary characters into
two-dimensional cardboard; rather, it puts them into good use.  Each
secondary character, from leading man William Thacker's (what, is
this supposed to allude to Will M. Thackeray?) (played by Hugh Grant)
eccentric circle of family and friends to Alec Baldwin's suprising
cameo as Roberts' insensitive boyfriend, has an interesting
characteristic of his own.  A standout is Thacker's grossly (and I
mean that literally) inapproriate roommate spike, whose idiosyncracies
bring comic relief in a bold way (read my lips: butt cheeks) that not
many romantic comedies of this sort dare do.  Another form of humor I
rather appreciated were the industry in-jokes (Harrison Ford, Mel
Gibson, Demi Moore).  Sadly, they could've used this form of humor
in many other places and given the film a real punch.
`Notting Hill' brings back the Julia Roberts of `Pretty
Woman': the pretty girl with the big grin and infectious laugh.
Roberts has never been an exceptional actress, but she's more than
perfect (and just a bit self deprecating) in her role as mega movie
star Anna Scott.  Glamorous and graceful when she's in the movie
star mode, Roberts also effectively morphs into the girl-next-door
mode that was her claim to fame in `Pretty Woman' and subsequent
films.  What's interesting about the casting of Roberts is the
apparent parallels between Roberts and the character she plays and
Roberts' willingness to poke fun at this structure.  Roberts and
Scott both became famous at a young age, both are under intense public
scrutiny whenever they do something as mundane as hold hands with a
boyfriend.  The irony comes when we see the (un)intentional parallels.
Scott describes herself as a bad actress with a pretty face that
everyone will forget ten years from now, just as critics everywhere
love to proclaim Roberts as just another long-legged beauty who
can't act.  Well I'll give her this: she does a great job of
acting like a bad actress in the pseudo-film clips.
Speaking of self-deprecation, we come to the master himself, Hugh
Grant, most known for `Four Weddings and a Funeral,' Elizabeth
Hurley, and the Divine Brown scandal.  Here again we have evidence of
masterful casting.  While Grant may look perpetually lost in other
films, his shy boy stuttering comedy and unaffected charm is perfect
for his role as the everyday man William Thacker.  There's even a
sly reference to his scandal thrown in:
Part of what makes the film different is its poignancy amidst the
lovey-dovey stuff and comedy.  There's just a subtle hint of the
common man versus the unreachable: in this case, the common citizen
versus Hollywood superstar.  Thacker's group often gets together
and laments about their lives, envious of Anna and treating her like a
walking Madonna, try desperately to impress her; while Anna in reality
lead a glamorous but lonely life in the spotlight.  Because of the
similarities between Roberts and Anna, we feel as if we've been
given a secret peek into Roberts' private life.  It shows the
sometimes inhumane treatment most celebrities have to endure.  Its
ingenuity is it simultaneously makes fun of the celebrities'
complaints by placing their troubles alongside a woman bound to a
wheelchair for life, a failed entrepreneur, a fired stockbroker, a
romantic failure, and starving refugees.
The film would have been immensely better if it had been, say, half an
hour shorter; toward the end you keep thinking it's going to end,
but it just keeps dragging on (the Death Flaw for romantic movies, in
my opinion).  It is times like these when the quiet, snippy, decidedly
British banter between the characters seem lifeless and forced.  Other
times they are witty and engaging.  I suppose this is worth it in a
way since it all builds up to a wonderfully fluffy happy ending that
is bound to send sensitive viewers everywhere looking for their
hankies and Kleenexes.  `Notting' made me laugh *and* cry; it
entertained me but it didn't try too hard to be sweet and
cute. There's no better way to spend a Friday evening.

_Notting_Hill_ (PG-13) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
While their careers are far from flagging, neither Julia Roberts nor Hugh
Grant have quite recaptured the heights of the projects that propelled them
to stardom.  This has been especially the case with Grant, whose last
project, the 1996 medical thriller _Extreme_Measures_, found the actor
acquitting himself surprisingly well in a serious role, but it offered
little reminder of self-effacing British charms that broke him through in
1994's _Four_Weddings_and_a_Funeral_.  Roberts, on the other hand, has had
(to put it lightly) her fair share of successes since 1990's
_Pretty_Woman_, but few of the hits she has had possessed the simple magic
of that modern-day romance classic that made her career--even her role in
1997's entertaining smash _My_Best_Friend's_Wedding_ had her stretch
somewhat, playing, to use the words of her character, "the bad guy" (albeit
a charming one).  Roberts has always been best at being, as in
_Pretty_Woman_, a glowing presence--something she has never been content to
do since.
_Notting_Hill_, from two of Grant's _Four_Weddings_ collaborators, writer
Richard Curtis and producer Duncan Kenworthy (director Roger Michell is new
to the mix), casts the two likable stars in their well-trodden element.  As
such, the film does not uncover any new talents that they might have buried
within, but it gives audiences exactly what they want from them--and in a
smartly written and wholly irresistible package.
Many stars have been accused of essentially playing themselves in film,
but never has that been more blatantly the case with Roberts's role in
_Notting_Hill_: that of Anna Scott, a world-famous movie star whose private
life is often fodder for the tabloids.  (Further blurring the Julia/Anna
divide is the opening montage of red carpet arrival footage, most of it
culled from actual news coverage of Roberts at gala events.)  This may reek
of shameless self-indulgence, but the movie star conceit allows Roberts to
poke fun at her image and, more effectively, enables Curtis to deftly let
off some pointed barbs at the Hollywood machine.  One hilarious sequence
perfectly captures the often ridiculous nature of a press junket
(naturally, this section received the best response from the all-media
audience); and in one single, simple line, Curtis takes a stinging jab at
the writing-by-committee tactic so often used for so-called "blockbusters."
The main intent of _Notting_Hill_, however, is not satire but romance, and
Curtis and Michell have crafted a truly enchanting one.  The premise is
pure fantasy: one day Anna walks into the travel book store of Notting Hill
(a neighborhood in London) resident William Thacker (Grant, comfortably
back in _Four_Weddings_ stammer mode), and in quick time this average joe
finds himself striking a friendship with the glam starlet that eventually
develops into something deeper--which, of course, leads to some problems
with anonymity.  As far-fetched as the story is, it is done with such style
and grace--the latter especially the case with Roberts and Grant's
effortless rapport--that there is no difficulty in suspending disbelief.
While Roberts and Grant make an immensely appealing center, the characters
at the periphery provide memorable support.  Emma Chambers, Hugh
Bonneville, Tim McInnerny, and Gina McKee are all given their individual
moments to shine as William's sister and close friends, respectively.
Likely to generate the most talk, though (aside from a funny surprise cameo
by a name star), is Rhys Ifans, a scene stealer William's disgusting slob
of a flatmate, Spike.
If there is a misstep made in _Notting_Hill_, it is the ending.
Admittedly a crowdpleaser, it's also so overdone as to be the only moment
in the movie that is far less than convincing.  But by that point, Roberts,
Grant, and everyone and everything else will have so effortlessly endeared
the audience that such a complaint is moot.  That one moment may ring
false, but what remains true throughout is the enrapturing spell this
sparkling entertainment casts upon the audience.

Starring Hugh Grant, Julia Roberts, and Rhys Ifans
     If there is one genre in Hollywood that is alive and kicking, it would
have to be the Romantic Comedy.  Let's face it, ever since its inception,
Hollywood has always strived to make love funny instead of painful.  Besides
my standard quote of "so much for realism," this is fine by me.  The
romantic comedy formula, trite and tired as it may be, is a sure-fire way to
make up your budget.  It's not going to be a hit, but its going to be in the
black.
     Notting Hill is the latest of these low grade Hollywood romances that
only teenagers find romantic, this one setting us in a bizarre universe of
sorts (Notting Hill, London, England) where somewhere along the line Julia
Roberts plays an actress (Anna Scott) who wins an Oscar.  Is that a
violation of the by-laws of the universe?  Also in the film you have William
Thacker (Hugh Grant), a humble bookkeeper.  Of course, when Anna decides
that she's going to get a book on Turkey, a bizarre relationship ensues.
     For comic relief we have William's furball of a flatmate Spike (Rhys
Ifans), who steals the show (and the comic performance) with one of the
funniest character acting jobs you will ever see.  You come away feeling
sure that Spike is a complete and utter idiot and has still just played you
for a fool.
     Notting Hill is blessed with the British comic wit of Richard Curtis
(Four Weddings and a Funeral), who churns out a screenplay that is decently
funny, somewhat romantic, and has enough twist on the norm to keep me awake.
It has a plot that is formulaic to no end, but keeps an ironic twist on it
as it seems to be on some level a take off of Henry James' "Wings of the
Dove", of which a film version has just wrapped at the end of the movie.
     Hugh Grant does a good jump of leaping back into romantic comedies
despite the fact that he still has a reputation for wanting very unromantic
liaisons in West Hollywood.  Julia Roberts sticks to my rule that when an
actress plays an actress, you're only looking for trouble.  I think she was
better in the "Law & Order" episode.
     The film, decently funny and somewhat romantic, falters when Richard
Curtis tries to add in way too much plot.  Let me be clear: the screenplay
has no 3rd act.  In place of a third act it spends its time trying to
impress me with how deep it can go into a relationship.  It tries to stay
true to who the characters are, and ends up having a bloody, drawn out
battle of a relationship with the duration of Vietnam.
     It spends all of its time towards the end going back and forth in a
drawn out romance that could have ended half an hour before it actually did,
a true pain in the but for a film critic like me.  In its effort to stay
true to character, it scares away half the audience and cracks no good jokes
in the meantime.  But, hey, what does anyone care?  By the end, the theatre
is smiling, the girls are clutching boyfriends that really didn't like the
movie, and people like me are groaning.
     Yes, the romantic comedy is alive and well and kicking.  It is trite,
its fairly funny, and doesn't believe in the concept of plot twist but its
alive.

   You read in People magazine that Gwyneth Paltrow is
about to tie the knot with Brad Pitt.  She denies all.  The
Daily News reports that the nuptials will take place shortly.
No comment from the two parties.  Finally even the NY
Times covers the story: the wedding is off.  Months pass. 
Brad Pitt is about to marry his new squeeze, Jennifer
Aniston.  Denials.  We lose interest and turn to see what's
happening with Liz Taylor's love life.
   All of this activity, however interesting to some, is so
remote from the lives of us ordinary folks that these
Hollywood personalities seem to be part of a fairy story:
material that today's most popular author, Shakespeare,
could use for a sequel to "A Midsummer Night's Dream."  But
how about this for a romantic fable?  A top actress is no
longer a remote personality guarded by pit-bull-style bouncers
but a woman who bounces right into your life to start an affair
with...YOU!  This actually happens.  Well, anyway, it
happens on the big screen as world-renowed entertainer,
Anna Scott (Julia Roberts), comes into the life of failed
bookstore owner, William Thacker (Hugh Grant).  Is this
situation of people from different worlds getting together for a
romantic interlude believable?  It is.  Sometimes celebrities
want nothing more than a private life away from the
press, a normal routine to come home to after a trying day of
filming.  Though "Notting Hill" has credibility, the movie
unfortunately uses stock, comedic situations (particularly the
surprise that comes over people's faces when they see
megastar Anna Scott in the intimate company of just plain
Will), and for all of its varied episodes, is not only repetitive
but plain unfunny.  Anna Scott is shown photographed from
every angle with a silly smile pasted on her face, but Richard
Curtis's script rarely gives her anything of interest to say. 
Instead the clever repartee comes exclusively from Will's
pals, making one almost think (mistkenly, I believe) that
director Roger Michell is trying to make yet another satire on
the emptiness of celebrity.
    The audience can see the stretches of banality coming
from the very beginning as William Thacker, owner of a
failing book store, checks his security video and confronts a
nerdy customer he spots filing a large travel book into his
trousers. Shortly thereafter he has a quick dialogue with
another visitor to his shop who, told that the store sells
exclusively travel tomes, wonders whether Will carries the
latest Grisham thriller or Winnie the Pooh.  When world-
famous screen star Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) enters the
shop, impetuously kissing the befuddled proprietor before
leaving, the story brings them soon together again by a
technique that Roger Ebert would call a "meet cute"--he spills
a container of orange juice all over the actress's blouse,
leading her to go to his apartment to change clothes.
   We're taken through several incidents involving men and
women whose faces drop when they see Will together with
this star, including one involving scene as Will and Anna
enjoy their first date at the bookseller's sister's home--atwhich
time each member of the family takes a turn giving his or her
hard luck story.  But the picture's truly absorbing interlude,
the one to which critics in the audience will relate
to particularly, pokes fun at the entire process of interviewing
actors. Will, invited by Anna to her hotel and expecting an
evening of private conversation, instead finds himself plunged
into a press conference in which he must suddenly pretend to
be a writer for a magazine.  Impulsively citing "Horse and
Hound" to satisfy Anna's agent, he then must satisfy the
vigilant representative by conjuring such absurd questions as
"Do you expect to use horses in your next movie?  Hounds? 
After all my readers are as fond of hounds as of horses."
   As Will's wheelchair-bound sister Sally says at one point,
"There's no rhyme or reason in life."  Some of us get lucky,
others have disastrous accidents.  So love is.  Who can
explain what fairy-dust makes people fall in love at first sight? 
Julia Roberts does her best with what she has, but given the
paucity of her lines, she comes across playing a performer
who does little more than smile for the cameras and look
fairly good in a space suit for her specialty sci-fi movies. 
Hugh Grant acquits himself well, restraining his signature
blinking until the final moments of bafflement. But "Notting
Hill" cannot make the grade either as satirical material or as
sentimental comedy despite the efforts of such quirky,
off-the-wall characters as Will's Welch roommate Spike (Rhys
Ifans)--who becomes tiresome as a one-joke supporting actor
wallowing in vulgarity.  The publicity notes say that "Notting is
the complete opposite of "Four Weddings and a Funeral" in
that it reflect the day-to-day details of a love affair.  Too often
the scripter Curtis and director Michell try to force humor into
what--despite Anna's alleged fame--looks like a commonplace
relationship between two vulnerable people.

Susan Granger's review of "NOTTING HILL" (Polygram/Universal Pictures release)
She's the most dazzling, famous movie star in the world and
he's the sheepish, fumbling proprietor of a tiny travel book store on
funky Notting Hill in London. Can they falls in love? Why not?  In
this joyous, contemporary fairy tale, anything's possible. Especially
with a script by Richard Curtis ("Four Weddings and a Funeral) that's
reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn's "Roman Holiday."  The set-up has Julia
Roberts, a glamorous American actress, meet Hugh Grant, a book-seller,
in his shop - after which he inadvertently spills orange juice all
over her T-shirt. She agrees to let him awkwardly clean her up in his
nearby flat and - well, nature takes its course. But their path to
romance has plenty of bumps which I won't ruin for you. Suffice it to
say, she's the impetuous aggressor, while he's wary. She's
sophisticated; he's shy. She's agile; he's clumsy. She's direct,
saying whatever she thinks; he's understated and evasive, musing,
"I've opened Pandora's box, and there's trouble inside." Director
Roger Michell has astutely assembled a superb British supporting cast,
particularly Rhys Ifans as Grant's wild, Welsh flat-mate and Emma
Chambers as his ditsy sister, with Alec Baldwin in an uncredited cameo
as Roberts' boy-friend who drops in unexpectedly. There are several
mischievous sequences involving the absolute idiocy people display in
the presence of a celebrity and a comic sparring-match with the
British tabloid press, plus a timely scandal involving obscene photos
and sly, amusing repartee involving Mel Gibson's bottom. On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Notting Hill" is an amusing,
captivating, relentlessly entertaining 10 - a perfect date movie and
one of the most delightful films in years!

NOTTING HILL (U.K., 1999) **  Directed by Roger Michell. Written by Richard
Curtis. Produced by Duncan Kenworthy. Photography, Michael Coulter. Music,
Trevor Jones. Cast: Julia Roberts, Hugh Grant, Hugh Bonneville, Emma
Chambers, Rhys Ifans, James Dreyfus, Tim McInnerney, Gina McKee, Alec
Baldwin (cameo), et al. A Universal release. 124 minutes, PG-13.
For many an experienced critic or viewer, Notting Hill is nothing to shout
about. Just a passable movie. For the average non-infantile public it could
be pleasant entertainment.  I am not putting down the moviegoing masses,
but drawing a simple distinction between casual and non-casual publics.
In London's popular but now rather chic, fairly bohemian and pricey Notting
Hill neighborhood (colorfulized for American consumption),  William Thacker
(Hugh Grant) owns and runs a bookstore specializing in travel publications,
a small and modest shop that apparently is quite unprofitable. How it
escapes bankruptcy is an unelucidated mystery. William also owns a small,
highly messy house nearby. To make ends meet he has taken a tenant, Spike
(Rhys Ifans), a Welshman of no known profession, and a total slob whose
looks, appearance and ways are occasionally amusing but in fact way
overdone in the film. The quiet, almost mousy William and the flamboyant
Spike are pals, an odd couple whose relationship is underdone.
Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) is introduced by a blatant opening montage as
the world's most famous movie star. In London to promote her latest film (a
space opera), Anna, we vaguely sense, is taking a break from bodyguards,
entourage and febrile masses of press-hounds. She more or less goes
slumming on her own. When she enters William's store to browse, the owner
is boyishly stunned, stupefied and tongue-tied. So is his sole employee, a
gay fellow who, ignorant of film-buffness, lauds Anna for films in which
she did not appear. An amusing touch, as is that of a book-thief caught by
William.
So far, so fair. But predictability sets in, running 20 to 2 vs.
verisimilitude. Anna leaves the booksellers'. Shaky William, trying to
collect his spirits, goes out for orange juice --when a good stiff whiskey
is called for. The moment he takes his paper cup in hand, I bet to myself
"now he'll encounter Anna in the street and spill the o.j. on her." That's
exactly what happens. She then accepts the apologetic William's offer to
come to his house and clean up. Upon leaving, she--unpredictably--gives
William a passionate French kiss, thereby stunning him as well as us, the
viewers, and initiating a hesitant and improbable love affair.
Next comes a phone call from Anna (the message is garbled by Spike)
inviting William to the Ritz Hotel. In another entertaining bit, William
unwittingly crashes a press junket at the Ritz, is taken for a reporter
from Horse and Hound, "interviews" Anna. The sequences are funny. Yet there
comes a point where meeting cute, local color, British eccentricities, mild
caricatures of showbiz Americans, and such become formulaic and overdone.
Even more blatant is the feeling that Hugh Grant, his writer and his
producer --all from Four Weddings and a Funeral-- are cannily but without
much inspiration recycling that earlier film.
Anna is the third real love in William's life. The first, his wife,
eventually took off with someone who looked like Harrison Ford. Number two
was filched by his best friend, who married her. A year and a half before
the film's action her legs were paralyzed in a car accident. It is to the
house of that couple that William takes Anna to celebrate the birthday of
his kooky sister Honey. And it is the husband and the wife in a wheelchair
whose love gives the movie its only touching moments.
Meeting the hoi polloi, Anna tries to adjust to them and show her "human"
side.  The commingling of the celebrity and ordinary yet unusual people was
infinitely better done by Frank Capra in You Can't Take it With You.
Anna and William go on a "romantic" walk,  scale the walls of a private
garden as photography piles on sentimentality. Then, boom! The camera
starts moving upwards as it looks down on the lovers in the greenery. A
jolt and a technical error after so many sensible, eye-level shots. You
become aware that this is a movie, that there is a whole unseen crew
manning a huge crane.
What follows is another date, spoiled by the sudden arrival of Anna's
current (and fickle) boyfriend Alec Baldwin, who in a mildly funny fashion
mistakes William for a waiter.
Eventually Anna joins William in his house, for a night of love that
promises much but winds up as a morning-after catastrophe : thanks to
Spike's babbling in the pub, a regiment of reporters and paparazzi shows
up. A furious Anna leaves. This would be the end of the affair in real
life, but since a happy ending is a must, it occurs when the star reappears
in London a year later to hype her newest movie during a press conference
at the Hotel Savoy. ( Equal Opportunity publicity to balance out the Ritz
Hotel).  There's a mad, Hollywoodish car ride followed by a peppy but
fabricated reunion which, in the usual tacked-on style, culminates in a
never-never coda.
While there are a few good moments in the film, its essential structure
gets in the way, is needlessly stretched out, and rapidly becomes a dull
Nodding Hill. Worse yet there is no passion between the principals at any
time, indeed no electricity. Things move hesitantly. So do the script and
the protagonists. Julia Roberts plays as if on cruise control, as a
presence with little to do except being there. She reminds me of Dorothy
Parker's judgment of an actress: "Miss X... ran the gamut of emotions from
A to B."
Ms. Roberts's outrageously over-hype and salaries, the flood of publicity
and fabricated praise, have gotten tiresome. I am also reminded of ancient
Athens when the leader-statesman Aristides "The Just" was again running for
high office. The equivalent of one of today's pollsters asked an Athenian
commoner why the latter had voted against Aristides. "Do you have something
against him?" "No" came the reply "but I'm sick and tired of hearing him
referred to as The Just."
Droopy-eyed Hugh Grant, now 39, overkills his role by underplaying it with
the spinal cord and the personality of a marshmallow, as an ever diffident,
bumbler-fumbler who is also prone to agree with everything. Witness the
record number of times he replies, responds or concludes with "Right" -- a
word that does not even have an exclamation mark after it. Like everyone
else in the cast, with the small exception of the married couple, all roles
are sketchy, un-rounded and dimensionless.
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in our times which are at
odds with the romantic comedy genre. It has gone the way of black-and-white
westerns. True romance is on the skids in these decades of serial
relationships, marriages and divorces, including (and especially) those of
Hollywood stars. Ms. Roberts is also a star within this trend. Not that the
old Hollywood actors were monogamous saints, but in those days the studios
which "owned them" kept down the lid of secrecy, exercised damage control
over iffy activities. The latter did not become notorious, while today
there's nothing hidden and nothing sacred in the media's Niagara.
The film is neither romantic nor comedic. The comic genre is also at the
bottom of the totem pole. It has been eclipsed by TV, especially British
series aired on PBS. Think of the successors to Monty Python, with their
dominance of wit, farce, fine scripts and great acting:  Fawlty Towers,
Yes, Minister, Yes, Prime Minister,  Mr. Bean, Blackadder, Thin Blue Line
(the last three with Rowan Atkinson),  As Time Goes By, Keeping Up
Appearances, Waiting for God.
Or The Vicar of Dibley in which Emma Chambers is superb as the deliciously
dim Alice. In Notting Hill she appears as William's sister Honey, is a
grating presence, and proves again that performers are only as good as
their texts and direction. Along the same lines,, in the 1997 feature Bean,
is far inferior to his TV episodes.  The same goes for John Clues, in the
1999 remake of The Out-Of-Towners.
Television is not always the idiot box. Film is increasingly the idiot screen.

     Hugh Grant gets chastised from time to time in the press for the
encroaching familiarity of his mannerisms, but as he's been making
fewer movies lately (or we've been getting fewer of them), he seems to
be wearing better again.  The diffident dip of the bushy head of hair
(here homage is paid with the nickname "Floppy"), the hesitations in
speech -- they all add up to real charm here, as Grant teams up with
Julia Roberts in a "Pretty Woman"- ish romantic fairy tale in which he
gets the woman's role.
Roberts is the rich and powerful figure, here an American movie
star promoting a blockbuster film in London, where Grant has a little
travel bookshop in Notting Hill.  She wanders into his store, a little
later he spills orange juice on her and has her back to his nearby
house to clean up, and she thanks him with a kiss that goes a chapter
or two beyond the perfunctory peck on the cheek you might expect.  A
few days later she calls, they meet, he asks her out, and they go to
his best friends' house for a dinner among common people.
There are several things that take this material and raise it to
the level of delightful, satisfying entertainment.  The script by
Richard Curtis ("4 Weddings and a Funeral") has enough solid wit to
carry it through heavy stretches of predictability, and Roger Michell,
who directed the best of the Jane Austen movies ("Persuasion"), guides
it all with a nimble hand.  They've loaded it with in-jokes (like
Roberts being mistaken by an adoring fan for Demi Moore) that are not
so obscure that we can't be amused.  They've given us the supporting
cast of supportive friends that worked so well in "4 Weddings",
including Grant's slovenly Welsh roommate Rys Ifans, and the lovely
Gina McKee, his former girlfriend who is married to his best friend
Tim McInnerny.
And they've given us Grant and Roberts, who provide good
chemistry in their reversal roles.  It is Roberts who is the moving
force in the relationship, Roberts who moves in and plants the kiss,
who makes the call, who dictates the pace of play.  Grant is the
adoring planet circling this radiant sun, and he pulls it off with a
self- deprecating humor that makes him the focus of our interest and
really carries the picture.  We might, however, wish for a little more
character delineation.  We don't expect an awful lot of men in
romantic situations, but we're used to women requiring something more
profound than a pretty face with which to fall in love.
But why quibble?  Summer's here, and this is a romantic comedy to
lift us into it.

Like most movie fans, every once in a while I enjoy something light to take
the sting out of all the bad movies that crop up every so often, and so far,
1999 has had its share of real clunkers.  So now that the summer season has
arrived, can things get better or worse?  That depends on who you ask.  Last
summer brought 'Saving Private Ryan' but it also brought 'Godzilla' which
was disliked by most.  Romantic comedies have the dubious distinction of all
looking alike so what's so interesting about 'Notting Hill'?  Aside from the
fact that it's a quiet, well written and cleverly conceived comedy, it also
has many scenes of brisk drama about how bad people think their lives are
and finding out that the rich and famous sometimes don't have it much
easier.
In 'Notting Hill' Julia Roberts plays Anna Scott, the most famous female
movie star in the world (that must have been a stretch for her to play).
While visiting London to promote her new film, she browses the little
neighbourhood shops in the Notting Hill district and enters a little travel
book store owned and operated by William Thacker (Hugh Grant).  After making
a purchase she leaves the store and has an accident later with Grant and
gets covered in orange juice.  He offers to let her come to his flat and get
cleaned up and the two of them later strike up a romantic relationship.
Thacker has a problem with women that makes him say some things in a rather
tongue tied fashion, a perfect contrast to Roberts' character who says
little, listens while looking directly her subject and knows exactly how to
respond.  William takes Anna to meet his best friends and his sister.  There
is Max and Bella (Tim McInnerny and Gina McKee).  She is in a wheel chair
from a tragic domestic accident and Max takes care of her.  William's sister
Honey (Emma Chambers), works in a record store and is rather goofy around
her own kind, let alone meeting a rich and famous movie star.  The most
hilarious but yet somewhat out of place character is Spike (Rhys Ifans).
He's the scruffy, slow witted room mate to William and provides some of the
film's funniest site gags.
The film reminds us in wake of the Princess Diana tragedy of 1997 that the
media is ruthlessly obsessed with celebrity fed only by the will of the
public.  There is one startling scene where the media find out that Anna is
staying at William's flat and they take pictures of all parties concern in
rapid fashion that will haunt Anna's career once the gossip starts.
I suppose what struck me as most whimsical about 'Notting Hill' is the fact
that those involved make the film work with straight, no-nonsense dialogue.
The film has very little music score and relies on romance to make it all
sing.  There is one intimate little night time date that William and Anna
embark on where they trespass on to private property and enjoy the pleasures
of a garden ladled setting to further their romance.
Another plus the film offers are the scenes where we see ordinary people
going about their lives and the audience can relate to this and the audience
isn't consumed by the trappings of a rich movie star's life but rather she
is brought down to the ordinary lifestyle and this is a fresh and proper
perspective the film takes in making it more appealing than any other
direction it could have taken.
Director Roger Michell makes it all unfold attractively like a play and
screenwriter Richard Curtis ('Bean', 'Four Weddings and a Funeral') writes
some inventive lines and injects just enough humour and drama to find a
perfect balance and 'Notting Hill' has an ending that is not really expected
but fate plays a hand in the plot all along and some will envy the outcome
of this film while other's will like their present lives just fine the way
they are.

Starring Hugh Grant, Julia Roberts, Rhys Ifans. Rated PG-13.
Notting Hill is a movie that plays off a dream. It's a dream many people
have. Imagine, if you will, this scenario: you get a knock on your door
one afternoon. You go to open it, and on your doorstep you see one of
the most famous movie stars in the world, someone you have seen time and
again, someone you admire, perhaps even adore (don't even ask why they
are there, stick with me here). What would you do? What would you say?
How would you conduct yourself? It's quite an interesting thought,
really. One often imagines something like that happening to him, but if
push comes to shove and it actually happens, he is dumbfounded. And what
if that movie star, presumably of the opposite sex, comes up and plants
a big wet kiss on you? That's what Notting Hill is about.
Hugh Grant, whose talents have taken second billing to the 1995 scandal
when he reportedly hired a prostitute to perform undignified sexual acts
on him in the privacy of his car, is actually a damn good actor. He's
got a boyish, often befuddled charm that can only be described as crowd-
pleasing, but it's also effective. Here, he stars as William Thacker, a
struggling travel bookshop owner in a section of London called Notting
Hill. When Anna Scott (Julia Roberts), a female movie star the
equivalent of, well, Julia Roberts, walks into his bookshop one day, he
is understandably amazed but he maintains his composure (even if he does
give her a free book). He remains human even when later that same day he
bumps into Anna on the street and spills some coffee on her. He
excitedly invites her to go clean up at his place, across the street (18
yards away), to clean up. That is where the big wet kiss is planted.
Before long, it's full-fledged love affair, with Anna coming to
William's sister's birthday (complete with exclamations of "Holy F*ck!"
by astounded family members), them climbing over garden walls, and so
on. It's an extraordinarily engaging affair, mainly because Thacker's I-
can't-believe-this-is-happening astonishment is so palpable. For once,
here is the old "ordinary guy in extraordinary circumstances" plot, when
the extraordinary circumstances are actually positive, as is this
relentlessly upbeat, optimistic modern fairly tale.
Notting Hill asks whether fame is a goal or an obstacle; whether one who
is a household name can achieve the happiness that so many "ordinary
people" can arrive at. It is an exhilirating, funny, profound film, full
of smart, realistic dialogue, masterful cinematography and magical
acting. Julia Roberts, whose last romantic comedy was the equally
wonderful My Best Friend's Wedding, is terrific; although
understandably, the role isn't much of a stretch for her, she has the
ailing superstar feel down cold. Hugh Grant is something else again --
the bumbling Brit is an absolute delight, and the scene where he
impersonates a reporter from "Horse and Hound" magazine is a triumph of
understated comedy.
Director Roger Michell, whose only other major motion picture was the
Jane Austen adaptation Persuasion, stages this movie free of any
suspense or particularly pressing conflict; it's a whimsical, airy
production that is part crowd-pleaing and part profound and thoughtful.
Even though William's degenerate roommate (Rhys Ifans) is a bit too
much, the comedy rarely gets in the way of the plot, nor does it spoil
the movie's mood.
This is a perfect example of how good "mainstream" movies can be. It's
hard to remember the last time a romantic comedy worked this well, this
consistently. Grant and Roberts are awesome, in a movie that pulls no
punches and plays no tricks. It would be cliched and disrespectful to
call Notting Hill the "feel-good movie of the year," but that's what it
is; an upbeat, optimistic story of how an ordinary bloke and a superstar
fell in love. Happens every day.

In Notting Hill, Julia Roberts plays an internationally renowned movie
star named Anna Scott, who is in such demand that her last project
carried a paycheck of 15 million dollars. If there ever was a
wonderful role for Roberts, this is it - as she, a famous actress,
portrays one just as famous on screen. This character showcases all
the positive shades of her acting abilities, but even as her
performance sparkles in every scene, there is still much more to
relish in this delightfully charming movie.
I am no big fan of the romance genre, save for the occasional teaming
of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. I sometimes have difficulty sitting through
a film where nothing gets blown up. Notting Hill, however, is
something special. It relies on chemistry to carry itself until the
credits start to roll, and noting that the chemistry in the movie is
genuinely believable, it has no trouble achieving success.
The title location is a small, friendly community in the city of
London, where a shy and reserved book store owner named William
Thacker (Hugh Grant) sells Travel guides. One day, Anna Scott herself
trounces in the door, much to his amazement and surprise. She buys a
book about Turkey, smiles innocently, and leaves the store.
But surely they will meet again. In this case, William collides with
Anna walking down the street, staining her shirt with orange
juice. Despite the amazing awkwardness of the situation, they begin to
fall in love. From here, Notting Hill becomes a clash of two separate
worlds: William's quaint, boring day-by-day life versus Anna's
busy, media hounded schedule. Scenes where "normal" people, such
as William's friends and family interact with the enormous movie
star are both hilariously truthful and fun to watch.
The script, by Richard Curtis (Four Weddings and a Funeral), is like a
breath of fresh air. The dialogue is sharp and witty, the characters
are interesting, and not a minute of the romance feels
artificial. William' s apartment flatmate, Spike (Rhys Ifans),
provides a few roars of laughter, but doesn't steal too much of the
star's important screen time.
This is Roberts' best film vehicle in some time, but don't
overlook Grant's modest, charming performance. He fits the role and
all of it's demands perfectly. Scenes involving his tendency to say
"whoopsidaisy" and going over Anna's lines from her upcoming
film, generate just the precise amount of sparks.
Notting Hill is unique, adorable and insightful. All of which, suffice
to say, adds up to one of the most enjoyable romances since Sleepless
in Seattle.

 The most telling line in "Notting Hill" has mega star Anna Scott (Julia
Roberts) telling her bookstore-owner boyfriend, William Thacker (Hugh
Grant), about Rita Hayworth.
 Men, Hayworth used to say, would go to bed with "Gilda" (her most famous
movie character) and wake up with me.
 Translation: Men would confuse the love goddess on screen with the real
person who, offscreen, had the same frailties and doubts as we mortals.
 "Notting Hill" is a romantic fable that plays upon the fantasies in all us
ordinary men and women. You know the one: That Julia Roberts or Brad Pitt
would bump into you, and actually find you interesting. The two of you
would fall in love, marry and spend the rest of your lives happily ever
after.
 Like I said, a fantasy. Let's be honest. You probably have a better chance
of winning Powerball.
 The world in which a super celebrity orbits is so high above us common
folk these days that we would need an oxygen mask to reach such altitudes.
 Yet, "Notting Hill," written by Richard Curtis (who penned the delightful
"Four Weddings and a Funeral"), so charmingly manipulates that very fantasy
that we swallow the premise entirely.
 Anna and William meet at his travel bookstore. He is shy, she is weary.
They later collide - literally - on the street. It's one of those cute-meet
situations recognized by veteran moviegoers.
 From there, a cautious, awkward and humorous mating dance begins as Anna
and William gingerly step into each others worlds.
 To his credit, Curtis - as well as director Roger Michell - do not always
show Anna in a favorable light. After all, she is a superstar, and Roberts
is at her best when she acts the pampered, spoiled and self-centered role
of diva actress.
 After the paparazzi discover Anna at William's apartment, for example, her
reaction centers only on how the situation and ensuing publicity will
affect her. She gives no thought to William and how the circumstances will
impact on his now-former life of anonymity..
 Such are the nuances that hoist Notting Hill a notch above the usual,
predictable, romantic-comedy drivel that lately has infested movie screens.
 Grant, of course, plays his usual charming, boyish character, with his
self-depreciating comments, his stammer and fluttering eyebrows. It becomes
a bit tiresome, but Grant has such a winning personality that you tend to
overlook this by-now overdone trademark.
 A strong supporting cast of eccentrics, led by Welsh actor Rhys Ifans as
Spike, William's uncouth and unconventional roommate, aids in making
Notting Hill an enjoyable two hours,
 Ifans is a comic natural who does not overplay his character nor allow him
to be wallowed in stereotype.
 A quick cameo by Alec Baldwin as Anna's movie star boyfriend shows the
unconscious condescending nature that grips those who have gained fame and
are too ill-equipped to handle the social graces attached to such public
positions.
 "Notting Hill" is a winner, a truly starry-eyed endeavor, complete with
sappy music, lovers' spats, reconciliations and good vibrations.
 It's a quiet alternative to George Lucas' world of fantasy. Yet, in a
sense, it is just as much a once-upon-a-time story as the new "Star Wars"
saga.
Roberts is beautiful, Grant is charming, London is picturesque. What more
can you ask for?
 Maybe a candlelight pasta dinner with Sophia Loren? Well, I can dream,
too, can't I?

Directed by Roger Michell.
Cast: Hugh Grant, Julia Roberts, Rhys Ifans, Emma Chambers, Tim 
McInnerny, Gina McKee, Hugh Bonneville.
1999 - 124 minutes
Rated PG-13 (for profanity and sexual situations).
Reviewed May 30, 1999.
The final installment of what I'd like to call the "unrelated bookstore 
romance trilogy," director Roger Michell's "Notting Hill" is, for my 
money, easily the best (the other two being "You've Got Mail" and "The 
Love Letter"). It is a sparkling romantic comedy, full of so much 
energy, laughs, and intelligence that it also must go down as one of the 
better films of its genre this decade. Taking the overly familiar 
formula of "boy-gets-girl/boy-loses-girl/boy-gets-girl-back," Michell 
and screenwriters Richard Curtis and Duncan Kenworthy have put an extra 
spin on the potentially mundane by having a great deal to say about 
fame, and the price celebrities must pay, when most would probably 
rather lead a "normal" life. 
Set exclusively in the homely England town of Notting Hill, William 
Thacker (Hugh Grant) is a lonely 35-year-old divorcee who runs a travel 
bookshop and shares a townhouse with the goofy, unsightly Spike (Rhys 
Ifans), a scruffy-looking man who is oddly lovable even when he is 
revolting. One day while at work, William finds his life suddenly change 
before his eyes when Anna Scott (Julia Roberts), the world's most famous 
movie star, walks in to do some book-shopping. After a brief encounter, 
William then experiences a "Meet-Cute" with Anna when he accidentally 
spills orange juice on her while walking along the street. After 
stopping by at his home to clean up, it becomes clear that Anna really 
likes William, and might even want to further the relationship, but 
there are, predicatably, many obstacles in the way. For one, the life of 
a movie star is not easy, as they rarely are able to snatch a moment's 
time for themselves. And two, Anna knows that their budding romance 
might very well lead to life-changing consequences for William and 
herself, particularly when the media inevitably catches on to the story.
Watching "Notting Hill," it is clear to see how easily the film could 
have been of lesser quality. After all, we've seen this story outline 
numerous, practically endless, times before and to mostly ho-hum 
results. It is only after the fame aspect is added in that the film 
proves it is trying something a little different, as the dialogue always 
comes off as nothing less than witty and entertaining. This slyness also 
leads to the heavy dose of humor the film has going for it, and I can't 
even remember when I've laughed so hard at a romantic comedy before. 
Aside from the scripting, the supporting characters are all comic 
originals, from Ifans, as William's roomate, Spike, who brightens up 
each scene he is in (even if the scenes are already bright), to Emma 
Chambers, as William's talkative, lovable sister, Honey, who is 
fortunate enough to be given the film's most laugh-inducing line of 
dialogue, when she first meets Anna, the movie star. Also effective in 
minor roles are Tim McInnerny, as William's brother, and Gina McKee, as 
his crippled wife, who share a few nice scenes together, and whose 
relationship is believable and touching as a married couple who love 
each other with all their hearts, no matter what.
And of course at the center of the film are the star attractions, Hugh 
Grant and Julia Roberts. Grant is the character whom we follow 
throughout the film, and he gives a memorable performance that more than 
adequately displays the full round of emotions William feels when it 
looks like his relationship with Anna isn't going to work out after all, 
and then when he finds himself given another chance. The question of 
should he take the chance or not is cause for some debate, and your 
opinion will greatly hinge on if you, like William, have fallen for 
Anna. Since she is played by Julia Roberts, of all people, my prediction 
is that most people will grow to care and understand her character's 
plight, as she has all of the money and success that she could ask for, 
but still is burdened with her extreme popularity, the media, and no 
privacy. It would be the easy way out to say that Roberts is, in 
general, playing herself, but I don't think so. Anna is strictly a 
character, but the reason Roberts is so wonderful and right at home here 
is because she, no doubt, has taken her own experiences with fame and 
put them into the context of this film. Together, Grant and Roberts are 
dynamite, and perhaps they could go on to become the next Tom Hanks/Meg 
Ryan romantic duo.
One of the pleasures to be had in "Notting Hills" is in its dealing with 
Hollywood. One of the best, and most hilarious, on-target, sequences 
comes when William drops by the Ritz hotel to see Anna, and finds 
himself in the midst of press interviews. Saying that he is from "Horses 
& Hounds" magazine, William is forced into a seemingly endless stream of 
interviews with Anna Scott's co-stars in her latest film, the sci-fi 
epic, "Helix." The sheer accuracy of the interview procedure is one of 
the reasons the scene is so successful, and is only aided by William's 
utterly benign questions, such as when he asks Anna, "do you wish that 
you had added more horses into your film?" "Not really," replies Anna, 
"seeing that this particular picture takes place in space." Because of 
her fame, Anna knows that she can never have what most people have, 
which is a regular life, but still feels frustrated by the fact that she 
can't do anything without the media turning it into a major headline 
blitz. The treatment of this character element only enhances the film, 
and Anna, so that when she grows upset at one point late in the picture, 
it is an understandable reaction.
Although not vital to the film's story, one added bonus that should be 
pin-pointed is a magical, liberating sequence in which William walks 
down a Notting Hill street and right in front of your eyes, we see the 
seasons change from summer to rain to snow, and finally, to spring. 
Bravo to director Michell for attempting something so fresh and stylish, 
and performing it to perfection.
How everything ends up at the conclusion of "Notting Hill" can be more 
or less telegraphed before the movie even starts, but getting to that 
predictable moment was an unexpected delight, and for the film to have 
ended any other way would have seemed like a cheat. "Notting Hill" is 
the rare, quintessential Hollywood romance--smart, affectionate, 
realistic, and thoroughly likable.

The topic of celebrity is one of much debate in this
entertainment-obsessed decade. Should celebrities recieve different
treatment than "regular" people? Well, regardless of whether they
should or shouldn't, they do, and Roger Mitchell's "Notting Hill"
examines the relationship between the world's most famous actress and
a "normal" bookshop owner in a section of London called Notting Hill.
Living in Los Angeles, I have had many celebrity encounters, and my
experiences have usually been somehwat similar. When you first see the
celebrity, you feel a rush that leaves you breathless for a couple
seconds. As you talk to the person, the newness will wear off; the
speed depending on how down-to-earth the celebrity is. However, when
the person leaves, you end up regretting either asking too much or
asking too little. Therefore, a romance between a celebrity and an
everyman can be a whirlwind.
In "Notting Hill", William Thacker(Hugh Grant) first meets Anna
Scott(Julia Roberts) when she visits his travel bookshop, arguably the
least successful store in Notting Hill. A series of coincidences leads
her to his flat, where they share a passionate kiss.  William isn't
sure what to make of the kiss, since Anna had, at first, come off as
arrogant and selfish.
>From that moment on, their relationship has its ups and downs, as
William learns that dating a celebrity is tough work. She loves him
only for the fact that he is something ordinary in a hectic
lifestyle. He loves her because, well...she's the world's biggest
movie star.
"Notting Hill" is well-written for the most part(despite its
predictability), but it is the acting that keeps everything real. Hugh
Grant once again perfects his charming loser act, and Julia Roberts
was born to play this role; a role that isn't much different than her
real life. The supporting cast is wondrous, led by Rhys Ifans("Dancing
At Lughnasa") as William's roommate and newcomer Emma Chambers as
William's sister. The acting more than makes up for the very
conventional wedding.
"Notting Hill" is the first film after Woody Allen's "Celebrity" to
accurately examine the celebrity lifestyle, and it's a topic that
deserves to be looked at in cinema, even if the film is being done by
the people it is examining. I'd like to see a film that(a la "The
Player") looks at celebrity life with sardonic wit and a cynical point
of view. "Notting Hill" isn't that kind of film, but it's a charming,
funny romantic-comedy.

The Happy Bastard's 30-Second Review
   A cute romantic comedy from the writer of the hit comedy Four
Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill stars Julia Roberts as Anna Scott,
a very popular actress with a $15 million asking price for movies.  One
day she wanders into a travel book store owned by a simple London
resident (played by Hugh Grant), and sparks somehow begin to fly.
   Sure, there are points of turmoil, such as putting up with Grant's
slightly disgusting (but very hilarious) roommate Spike, Anna's pesky
ex-boyfriend (Alec Baldwin in a humorous cameo), and, on top of all
that, those damn press.  It's a fresh sort of complexity to see in a
romantic comedy, very different from, say, a stubborn father or "not the
right time" like as seen in usual flicks.
   Roberts is terrific as the astonishingly beautiful actress, and Grant
is surprisingly good as the straightforward guy still trying to get a
hold of what has actually happened with this girl.
   In short, a sweet romantic comedy that has a lot of good laughs,
particularly provided by Spike.  One tee-shirt really says it all about
him.  In an attempt to turn on a woman, he shows the front of the shirt,
which says: "You are the most beautiful woman in the world."  On the
back?  "Fancy a f**k?"

Notting Hill may well be the best romantic comedy of the year!  
The very successful and hugely enjoyable Four Weddings And A
Funeral was always going to be a hard act to follow.  However, writer
Richard Curtis does a superb job of recapturing its charm and winning
humour with this classy, funny and delightfully entertaining follow
up.  Curtis brings genuine charm and wit to what has become an
increasingly familiar and disappointingly unadventurous formula-
driven genre.
This romantic comedy is set in Notting Hill, the colourful and
idiosyncratic London suburb that also provided the backdrop for the
recent If Only.  In the type of role that perfectly suits his relaxed
screen persona, Hugh Grant plays William Thacker, who owns a small
travel book shop in Notting Hill's main shopping strip.  He is
nonplussed when his shop is visited by Anna Scott (Julia Roberts), the
most famous film star in the world, in town to promote her latest
movie.  She is struck by the way he seems unfazed by her fame.
Another chance encounter with Anna, in which William spills
coffee over her, leads to the pair developing a friendship.  She
attends a private birthday dinner with him, enjoying the rare
opportunity to escape the publicity treadmill and the media spotlight
and experience a quiet moment.  William's friends look on in
bemusement as he romances a high profile personality.  However,
numerous problems quickly develop, not the least of which is the
sudden arrival of her actor boyfriend (an uncredited Alec Baldwin).
When that relationship falls apart amid some torrid headlines, Anna
turns to William for comfort.
But can the relationship between the world's most celebrated
movie star and an unassuming book seller survive amid the pressures of
intense media scrutiny and the demands of her glamorous career?
Notting Hill explores these questions, and provides some surprisingly
satisfying answers.  One of Curtis' strengths as a writer is his
ability to create memorable characters - after all, he gave us Mr
Bean, Blackadder and The Vicar Of Dibley.  He injects life into the
eccentric peripheral characters, and the ensemble cast give them
personalities of their own.  One of the more interesting creations is
William's unwashed, dishevelled and offbeat flat mate Spike, (played
in wonderful fashion by Rhys Ifans, from Twin Town), who proves
unexpectedly sympathetic and romantic at heart.
Notting Hill benefits enormously from the inspired teaming of
Roberts and Grant, who develop a wonderful rapport together.  Grant's
easy going presence is a major part of the film's charm, while Roberts
essentially plays herself in a tailor made role.
Director Roger Michell (Persuasion, etc) handles the material
with a perfectly judged light touch, and the unhurried pace suits the
film's tone.  While Notting Hill may not quite reach the same heights
as Four Weddings And A Funeral, it will certainly please audiences.
For the creators here though, in this instance close enough is
definitely good enough.

Despite my lack of appreciation for Hugh Grant, "Notting Hill" rocks.
Hugh bumbles modestly, dropping clever leafy quips like a young Maple tree
in a light breeze. In the film, Julia Roberts plays a beautiful, mega-famous
actress of average talent. Ironically, reality holds the opposite to be
true: she's an average looking woman with fantastic talent as an actress.
Whether or not she's a "pretty woman" to you is a rather mute point since
she aptly plays the role.
Meandering into Hugh's travel bookstore, Julia and Hugh strike up a
passionate, but impossible romance. Hey, what is it with the bookstore
fascination in romantic comedies these days? ("Got Email," "The Love Letter"
to name just a two.)
This typical "complicated" romance vehicle is not what makes the picture
rock. Rather, it's the sharp, sometimes raw, British-fused humor -- most
apparent in the first 60 minutes. This half of the film taken alone deserves
5 stars, 2 thumbs. However, it being only 50% of the "big picture" ... would
that be 2.5 stars and 1 thumb? Hold the quotient, there's still the
remainder to factor in...
Like an off road 4x4 that eventually stumbles across the beaten path,
"Notting Hill" offers much less untraveled territory in the second half.
None the less, the crisp humor keeps familiar scenery from becoming stale.
Beyond the slight decline in intensity after its middle, the film has only
one other area barely in need of improvement. Anna Scott (Roberts) is most
often unpretentious and calm, but occasionally weilds a particularly selfish
temper. Falling victim, William (Grant) is shocked, but far less upset than
he has the right to be and not as much as we'd like to see him be.
Surprisingly light and fun overall, "Notting Hill" is good solid
entertainment.
Starring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant.
Directed by Roger Michell. Written by Richard Curtis.
Produced by Duncan Kenworthy at Universal/Polygram/Working Title/Notting

     The plot of NOTTING HILL is simple enough.  William Thacker
(played by Hugh Grant) is the handsome owner of a small and failing
travel bookstore.  He had a marriage that failed.  And now he lives
with a self-absorbed troglodyte of a housemate named Spike (Rhys
Ifans).  Spike is rude, stupid, and completely impossible to live with.
Into William's shop one day comes Anne Scott (Julia Roberts).  Scott is
sort of a combination of Meryl Streep, Gwyneth Paltrow, Emma Thompson,
and, yes, even Julia Roberts.  Her face is plastered on double-decker
busses all over London.  After the requisite shaky start, Anne and
William begin to date and go through some predictable comedic
situations.  What happens when a luckless bachelor comes to dinner at a
friend's house with his date of the evening, one of the world's most
glamorous movie stars?  (There is a somewhat similar and considerably
funnier sequence in MY FAVORITE YEAR.)  What happens when a man
thinking that he is going on a date finds that it really is a press
publicity junket for a film and for some reason he pretends he is there
to interview the star?  The latter sequence goes on much longer than
need be and eventually outstays its welcome.
     I have liked my share of romantic comedies, but NOTTING HILL just
never really catches on for me.  Perhaps the two leads seem just too
charming and empty. Hugh Grant's boyish stuttering as he finds almost
the right words is growing tiresome.  And Julia Roberts has such a wide
infectious smile from back molar to shining back molar.  I wonder if
she needed surgery to stretch that grin.  Their dialog ranges from
serious to cute to attempted cute.  The film could have had a
perceptive look contrasting how the super-famous and the unknown see
the world differently, but NOTTING HILL rarely rises to that occasion.
Much of the humorous dialog seems borrowed from "Seinfeld" with Spike
standing in for Kramer.  ("I once saw Ringo Starr.  Or it might have
been Topol."  "But they don't look even remotely alike."  "Well, he was
standing too far away.")  There are certainly places the film just does
not ring true.  The giant film that actress Anne Scott is currently
starring in appears to be on the level of GALAXINA, a film that would
be unlikely to have a big $15,000,000 star.  The script is by Richard
Curtis who has mostly written scripts for Rowan Atkinson playing either
Blackadder or Bean.  Curtis did write FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL and
now has returned to Hugh Grant territory.  But FOUR WEDDINGS had much
more human drama mixed in with the comedy.
     Director Roger Michell is probably best known for PURSUASION.
Here he seems to be depending a bit much on the star power of his two
major actors.  Too frequently he allows the camera to lovingly just
take in Julia Roberts while she just stands with a wide smile.  He is
apparently hoping that her magic and allure will just effortlessly win
over the audience.  Even Roberts does not look that good.  Just a
little cuter is Hugh Grant as he boyishly stammers and says the
unexpected while he tries too hard to express himself.  But really as
is often the case, many of the background characters are of greater
interest than those in the foreground.  William's circle of friends are
more interesting characters with a more real set of problems than the
principals.  (How frequently are major characters in American films
bound to wheelchairs?)  The film has one sequence in which William
visits Anne on a production set and just to see the circus that is
required to make a film makes this the most interesting sequence in the
film.
     NOTTING HILL tries to return to the territory of FOUR WEDDINGS AND
A FUNERAL, but never manages to capture the same romantic spark.  I
would give it a 5 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high 0 on the -4 to +4
scale.

NOTTING HILL (director: Roger Michell; screenwriter: Richard Curtis;
cinematographer: Michael Coulter; editor: Nick Moore; cast: Julia
Roberts (Anna Scott), Hugh Grant (William Thacker), Rhys Ifans (Spike),
Gina McKee (Bella), Tim McInnerny (Max), Hugh Bonneville (Bernie), James
Dreyfus (Martin), Emma Chambers (Honey, Thacker's Sister); Runtime: 123;
Universal; 1999-UK)
The same old romantic comedy formula story that has become a Hollywood
trademark is revived here, only this time its formula involves 'Beverly
Hills conveniently meeting Notting Hill.' This film asks the question,
"Can the most famous film star in the world fall for the man on the
street?" Give me a break, who in their right mind is seriously asking
that question. The answer lies in the shekels found in the box office
over the years, as this trite story line, the romance between opposites
and the cute obstacles layed before them, seems to draw its fateful
audience ever since Hollywood was a hill that filmmakers put up a
lettered sign on.
Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) is a world-famous actress, who unexpectedly
meets the proprietor of a small, unprofitable travel bookshop, William
Thacker (Grant), and both are bitten by the love bug. She is the
sure-fire American, he is the bumbling English man. What the film is
'banking' on, is the star personalities will continue to do their trick
and milk their charms for mucho profit. Roberts will fill the screen
with her innocent and bountiful smile and Grant will exploit that
hangdog stereotype look he has cornered the market on, of one who is
naturally shy but is persistent. They ape playing themselves as
parodies, though who knows what they are really like, which is
irrelevant, anyway. What is added to this often tried and tested screen
formula, is PG-13 safe humor and a mild story where love blossoms in the
way Hollywood wills it to. Think of any Cary Grant screwball comedy
vehicle and you will know that this plot has been perfected in a much
better way in other films. Unfortunateley this film is not on the same
level of Cary's films. Screenwriter Richard Curtis' dull workmanlike
script seems to have the knack in getting to Hugh Grant's screen
presence, the one that brings the paying audience in, as he previously
did for him in "Four Weddings And A Funeral," but can't go further than
that. Roger Michell's direction is predictable and lackluster, and the
film itself is simply old stuff served again, dried out except for those
who still find these superficial stars charming enough to think that
this plot is viable again. There is no accounting for taste and who has
taste, and no one's taste is better than your own, so if you like the
stars then you will probably like the film no matter what.
When superstar Anna comes into humble William's bookstore and gets a
book on Turkey, you can guess the direction the rest of the film will
travel to. They will meet for real when he accidently spills orange
juice on her on Portobello Road and offers to let her clean up in his
nearby flat. There are no surprises here, unless you consider her soul
kiss of William as she hurriedly leaves to be a surprise. It's a puff
piece hiding behind the reality of the Notting Hill location and the
quirky humor expected of the British eccentrics who are cast in the
film, as either William's friends or as his sister Honey. They pop up
all through the story to give the film its kooky British flavor and
homey feeling. Seemingly, their main purpose in life is to make sure
that William is a happy camper. Reality is blended so finely into the
story that it never gets in the way of the fantasy romantic comedy
happenings. It does what Hollywood always does, give hope to those in
the audience that fantasies can come true. You can bet your fairy tale
book collection, that after Hugh Grant will go through all the
obligatory obstacle courses required in the formula story, he will
prevail and get Julia Roberts.
The highlight of the film, before it overloads itself with its vacuous
plot and tacked on sub-plots, has Grant bringing Roberts on a date to
meet the ordinary folks he hangs out with, at his sister's birthday
party. The comedy unfolds as we watch how gracious the self-absorbed
Roberts is to the plebians, even confessing to them about her perpetual
diet and that she's a bad actress making $15 million a picture, and we
also see how nice and whacky the ordinary Brits are, fawning over the
American screenstar. It is her craving for this simpleness, to be away
from the spotlight for a brief time, and that Grant didn't make a rush
at her, that attracts her toward him. While he's star-struck at first,
but finds that even though they are complete opposites and there's
little chance of him being with her, his heart is racing when he's with
her.
Since Julia is not a blushing innocent in this film, she takes on the
role of the one calling the shots, the film will go through all the
formula tested tribulations in their relationship, with her looking less
attractive to me than looking like she's a hardened woman with an empty
soul. But Grant is stuck on her and to get her, he will have to jump
through the hoops as they keep running into obstacles. It starts when in
order to meet her he has to pretend that he's a magazine writer for
Horse and Hound in a crowded room with other magazine writers. When he
goes to her hotel room to spill his heart out to her, who should be
there but Alex Baldwin, in a cameo role, as her boorish boyfriend from
America who popped in on her unexpectedly, as Grant gets humiliated by
him when he has to pose as the bellboy. The big mix-up comes when she
splits from Grant, after she spends the night at his flat, hiding out
from the press after nude pictures from her past surfaced and in the
morning his place is surrounded by the media with the paparazzi's
flashing cameras pointed at her and him.
The only one in the film that had any fun in him that was sometimes
funny, was Grant's slob Welsh flatmate, Spike (Rhys), who spreads his
goofiness around like it was manna from heaven, until even his
dressed-down comic efforts feel forced. But, without his presence, even
if his role was also a stereotype one, this asinine film would have been
even more unbearable than it was.
This film was pure and unadulterated balderdash...opium for the masses
to get hooked on when they can't face reality. "Notting Hill" takes you
to a low point on the movie making hill, where you can step on horseshit
and curse out loud or pretend that it is not horseshit or be a man about
it and say you fell into it, just like the filmmaker expected you to,
and honestly say you like horseshit and don't care what anyone else
thinks. This is the kind of film Hollywood makes best...it's so easy to
make and the romance is so painless. It ends fittingly in a cliché, as
Roberts recites her love ode to Grant, "I'm just a girl, standing in
front of a guy, asking him to love her." Give me a bloody break...!

*** This Review Contains Spoilers ***
Whenever a new romantic comedy or drama is released, there is always
one question that has to be asked.  I mean sure, you know how the
movie is going to end even before you get to the theater, so the
question is not "will they or won't they?".  No, the question is "Will
the journey to this film's obvious conclusion be entertaining?".  In
the case of Notting Hill, the answer is definitely not.
One day, superstar actress Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) wanders into a
British travel book store, causing an almost interested reaction from
the shop's owner William Thacker (Hugh Grant, giving that same
stammering idiot performance that I just hate).  Later, Thacker spills
orange juice all over Anna when they accidentally collide on the
sidewalk.  Thacker then invites Anna up to his flat to change clothes,
and upon arriving there, Anna kisses him.  From that point on William
falls madly in love, while Anna repeatedly makes it her mission to
tear out his heart, stomp on it, throw it under a speeding bus, light
it on fire, extinguish it in a toilet, and then hand it back to him.
Forgive me for sounding so harsh here, but I can't figure out for the
life of me the appeal of this film.  It might be one of those "gender
specific" movies where women see it one way and men see it another.  I
mean from a guy's perspective though, Julia Roberts' character is a
total bitch to this guy (who obviously loves her) not once, not twice,
but THREE MAJOR TIMES over the course of the film, and HE'S the one
who ends up apologizing to her in the end?  WHAT?!
The first time comes when, after seemingly having a great date, Anna
brings William back to her hotel room.  Well surprise!  Guess who's
there?  It's her hunky actor boyfriend that she neglected to mention
(played by Alec Baldwin, who causes a distraction for a while because
you're not sure if he's playing himself or a fictional hunky actor).
Anna allows her boyfriend to completely humiliate William (if he
hadn't already been humiliated enough), and he leaves.
Jump to sometime later.  Nude pictures and a video of Anna surface so
she comes to William's to hide out.  He forgives her for her earlier
bitchness and they proceed to have a grand time.  Well thanks to
William's idiot flatmate (a character which may be the most disgusting
man ever put to film, British or not), the paparazzi swarm to
William's place to get the scoop.  (On a side note: I love how this
entire swarm of paparazzi all show up together, make their plan to all
be really, really quiet, elect one person to causally ring the
doorbell, remain quiet as mice, and then commence to go completely
nuts as a unit when William opens the door.)  Anna blames William for
answering his own door, saying that these pictures of them together
will haunt her for her entire life (photos of a couple in love are
worse than the nudie ones?  Come on!).  Again she basically tells
William to screw off, and she leaves.
Jump to sometime later.  Anna is filming a movie and William stupidly
forgives her bitchness AGAIN and goes to see her.  He is welcomed onto
the set and, in a moment that I don't think has ever happened on a
major movie shoot, is invited to hang out and listen to all of the
dialogue via headphones.  Through this ridiculous plot contrivance,
William overhears Anna talking to her co-star before a take.  Her
co-star asks about William, and she proceeds to tell him that he's "no
one".  Again distraught, William leaves.
A short time later, Anna shows up at William's shop to find out why he
left the set and to give her "I'm just a girl... standing in front of
a boy... asking him to love me" speech.  Instead of letting her have
it (as he should), William remains a gentleman and politely tells her
to go away because she's hurt him for the last time.  She does...  but
William's idiotic friends then convince him that he's made a terrible
mistake.  So there's a wacky car chase (involving one car) to get
William to see Anna before she leaves.  He makes it, apologizes for
all his wrong doings (which don't exist in any realm of reality), she
forgives him, and they live happily ever after on a bench in the park
where he reads and she smiles.
Notting Hill really did nothing for it's two hour plus running time
except infuritate me.  And I don't go to the movies to be infuriated.
Someone might respond to all this with that saying "You have to go
through the thorns to get to the rose".  Ok fine, if you want to rake
your hand up the stem through the thorns just to have the rose then go
right ahead.  But if you ask me, why not just start at the top?  No
head games, no pain, no blood spilled... just touch the stinkin' rose!
Sigh.  People in this world (obviously including the filmmakers) just
don't realize that life is too short for all this nonsense.  [PG-13]

The old saying is that you "shouldn't judge a book by its cover." 
Perhaps that is true in the field of fictional literature, and perhaps 
it is not. But it certainly doesn't hold true in Hollywood. Notting 
Hill, the first major motion picture from director Roger Michell, may 
not be overtly obvious from its title, but you needn't look much farther 
to discover what the production really is. The movie is a combination of 
the oldest, most proven plot in cinema, a love story; premium character 
humor; and top quality acting from two household names. This combination 
brings forth a brilliantly fun and beguiling film, that ranks among the 
best date films of the 90's. However, to quote the work itself, Notting 
Hill is "no Jane Austin." 
Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) is an American actress at the top of her 
field. She is considered to be one of the movie business' top leading 
ladies, and is even on the cover of Newsweek. With all of her fame has 
come financial success as well. For her latest film she was compensated 
$15 million. But Anna is forlorn. Much as Woody Allen demonstrated in 
Celebrity, fame has certain aspects that are not so glorious. And as a 
sexual icon, Anna experiences them all. The tabloids prey on her like an 
eagle on its dinner, and privacy is the rarest of things. She even 
resorts to checking into hotels under cartoon characters' names. 
William Thacker (Hugh Grant) is a prosaic British man. He lives in 
Notting Hill, England, where his largest claim to fame is probably his 
blue house. He has the absolutely mundane job of running a travel book 
store so small that for a celebrity to enter would be an extraordinary, 
unprecedented event.
Keeping with the tradition of nearly every romance in the history of 
cinema, the two protagonists meet via an unusual set of circumstances 
and fall madly in love. In this case, the events include spilled orange 
juice, a poorly written travel book, and a shoplifter who uses his 
trousers for assistance. However, unlike most films of this genre, the 
great obstacle standing between William and Anna for the two hours that 
the film occupies, is not someone else, or something else, but 
themselves. Notting Hill is the story of opposites attracting, then 
being forced to deal with the opposites and still create a nirvanic 
state. In this sense the production goes one step further than, and 
actually deals with the realities that follow. 
Aside from being a wonderful romance, Notting Hill is a hilarious film. 
The humor is largely based on character traits, not punch line jokes, 
although some do find their way into the script. A good example is 
William's house maid, Spike (Rhys Ifans). His scraggly appearance mixed 
with the character's lack of responsibility make for a light, enjoyable 
moment every time he is on screen.
In order for a film of this nature to be successful, the acting must be 
stellar. Roberts and Grant make for an absolutely enchanting on screen 
duo. The two are different actors, one sporting an English accent and 
the other a perfect typecast for the pretty-girl-in-bad-industry role, 
as she displayed in Pretty Woman. The contrast makes their job of being 
opposites very simple. Everything from the looks they exchange before 
kissing to their use of the English language works perfectly for their 
roles. Although they have both done better work before, the two actors 
certainly don't slouch here.
A love story is a love story. Whether it be Bogart and Bergman, Grant 
and Roberts or the leads in a 3rd grade play, the plot is always the 
same. But with the finite amount of variance allowed, Notting Hill does 
stand out. Between the characters, the acting and the man-meet-woman 
plot, this film is a solid work. I promise Jane Austin is nowhere to be 
found here, and this is one that you can judge by its cover.

NOTTING HILL (1999) w/ Julia Roberts, Hugh Grant
Director: Roger Mitchell
The Thumbs for Sale! review by Roger Gerbig
In passing, I've heard "Notting Hill"--the new Julia Roberts-Hugh
Grant luxury SUV-type vehicle currently parked at your local
multiplex--shows a lot of "Romantic Comedy 101" influence. After
leaving the theatre with these Thumbs! twitching more rapidly than Mr.
Grant's mug at the precipice of a nervous breakdown, I have to
disagree. I felt more like I'd just sat through a workshop for
"Romantic Comedy 404 - Advanced Studies in the Common Boy/Girl
Dilemma."
Which my ever-twitchy Thumbs! remind me is a good thing each time I
grope for the space bar.
Roberts is Anna Scott, world-wide superstar actress and platinum club
member of the jet set. Grant plays William Thacker, a slightly
impoverished bookstore owner and member of the "my best friend owns a
fast Peugeot wagon" set. While winning the lottery might be the most
appropriate life-changing event for Thacker, instead he is fated with
the experience of literally running into Scott and dousing them
both--enter the miracle of movie magic here--with what appears to be
about a gallon or so of orange juice. As their juice stains dry into
what appears to be mustard (British special effects technicians might
possibly have something to learn from "The Phantom Menace"), she
graciously accepts his offer to duck into his apartment to change
clothes.
And as they say in certain sports circles, "They're off and running!"
But fortunately, never too quickly. While the same writing/producing
team that gave us "Four Weddings and a Funeral" is clearly happy with
mining familiar territory ("Wedding's" director Mike Newell apparently
isn't, as he recently went down with that ship called "Pushing Tin".),
they've managed to make a film that unfolds with a leisurely pace and
treats its characters with remarkable decency.
Early on, there's a birthday party involving Thacker's friends,
family, and that certain movie star. As each character airs his or her
particular quirks (no shortage here), I was amazed at the deft hand
shown by the production team at large. Which is to say, you shouldn't,
as it's that well done. All too often today sparkling, witty dialogue
and blatant over-reaction are mistaken as hallmarks of truly inspired
writing. Here, they aren't, even though Thacker's little sister (Emma
Chambers) goes ballistic in proclaiming her absolute love for actress
Scott's work and persona, and the last brownie at dessert is auctioned
off to the person who tells the most pathetic story about him or
herself. In lesser hands, this scene could have been a disaster.
Since we've now clearly gotten the message that our little lovebirds
are probably going to be heading back to the nest at some point, it
must be time for a musical interlude, which for better or worse
happens. True, these misty-eyed excursions into Bob Seger-land often
send me on a search-and-destroy mission to the kitchen in order to
locate appropriate utensils for my ritual gagging ceremony. But here,
things are kept low-key enough (no Bob on the soundtrack either!) to
perhaps subliminally remind us that during real-life moments like
this, we're probably humming some little soundtrack to ourselves to
help preserve the moment.
I survived, and the eggbeater remained safely stowed in my backpack.
Not that there aren't a few quality moments of cliche (especially
toward the end), but they're more than mitigated by an abundance of
inventive and sometimes touching moments. This is, after all, a film
that successfully manages to pull off two Beavis & Butthead jokes
without the slightest twinge from the audience.
As for performances, I'm proud to say that for the first time I feel
compelled to break out the old "winning performance" moniker to
describe Julia Roberts in this film. Seemingly at all the right
moments, she shows an astounding vulnerability without resorting to
the old quivering lip trick. While she may never win the awards
bestowed on her character, I will say that all too often she's been
asked to carry films that are entirely too insubstantial for any actor
to salvage. That she's managed to take such heapings of negative
criticism and still avoid becoming an alumna of the Betty Ford clinic
certainly counts for something.
Hugh Grant, of course, really is the ultimate poster boy for your
average silver-screen nice guy. He's in perfect form here, having
apparently either sought hypnotherapy for his notorious tics, or
undergone a spiritual reevaluation of his art. Together he and Roberts
generate more than enough of that mythical chemistry to make this
flick work.
To sum it all up, I think it's fair to say since I only spent two out
of roughly 120 minutes biting my critic's lip on account
"questionable" moments, I think "Notting Hill's" a pretty solid value.
Now, if I could just sell my thumbs! for an eighteenth of what Julia
Roberts makes per picture...

     Julia Roberts *is* Julia Roberts  almost  in NOTTING HILL, a
well-crafted romantic comedy from the geniuses behind FOUR WEDDINGS AND
A FUNERAL.
     The deceptively simple plot begins when uber-famous film star Anna
Scott (Roberts) winds up in William's (Grant) book shop on Notting Hill,
something of a British cross between a pre-Disney Times Square and a
Moroccan street market.  After William accidentally dumps orange juice
down Anna's front, an on-again, off-again, on-again, off-again, on-again
love affair blossoms.
     Using Anna's (and Julia's) celebrity as a catalyst, the plot is
propelled along by run-ins with the press and paparazzi, the duplicity
`required' of a big film star, secret love affairs on the side, world
travel, and buttinsky PR flacks.  It's amazing that Anna comes off as
likeable at all, but with EveryBrit Grant as her foil, it's hard not to
fall for her in the end.  Of course.
     So far, sounds like an everyday comedy  but NOTTING HILL wins its
real points in the details.  Director Michell's London is every bit is
real as a Beatles album.  And, big surprise, it's the cast of completely
unknown supporting characters that really carry the film.  Special kudos
to Rhys Ifans as Spike, William's pig of a roommate, who carries large
chunks of the film on charm (or lack thereof) alone.  I give him an
early Best Supporting Actor nod.
     If you like lighthearted romances, NOTTING HILL is for you.  The
women in our audience (who comprised about 90% of it) would seem to
agree.  I can't complain, either.  I mean, it's Julia Roberts.  How can
you not fall for her?

The chances of an ordinary guy like myself bumping into Julia Roberts is
less likely than me winning the lottery. And the chances of me bumping into
her and then getting a kiss? I don't even want to consider it. It is this
kind of what-if scenario that makes Notting Hill so enjoyable.
William (Hugh Grant) Thacker is an ordinary guy who lives in Notting Hill.
He owns a travel bookstore that is deep in debt, his wife divorced him for
a guy who looks like Harrison Ford and he now lives in the house that they
bought together. He has a flatmate that's a disgusting, though hilarious,
guy. One day his whole life changes when the world famous actress Anna
(Julia Roberts) Scott walks into his bookstore. The fun and odd romance
starts from this point. Odd in the sense that in Notting Hill the typical
movie gender roles are reversed. Thacker is put into the position of the
person at home waiting and wondering. And Anna is the one off in the world
working.
The best thing about Notting Hill is that the two main actors are doing
parts that they have been doing for a long time. The parts that Grant and
Roberts are attempting in Notting Hill are familiar, both to the viewers
and to the two actors. Which makes a original but familiar feeling movie.
The first hour of Notting Hill is absolutely hilarious. The second hour
keeps some of the humour from the first hour but becomes a bit more
heartbreaking as it continues. The second hour does lose some of the first
hour's steam, but this isn't a big deal. My favourite moment of the film is
when Anna and William jump a gate to take advantage of a private park. From
the moment they arrive at the gate, this sequence had me laughing. The
scene ends on a sweet note with Anna discovering a park bench with an
inscription on it.
Julia Roberts is back at the top of her game now that she is doing the
roles that fit her best. Roberts has always been a romantic-comedy type
actress. Her roles in romantic-comedy films have always been hits (Pretty
Woman, My Best Friend's Wedding), while her roles in dramatic and otherwise
have been lukewarm at best (Mary Reilly). My Best Friend's Wedding is still
my favourite film of Roberts, but, Notting Hill comes up a close second. No
matter what you think of Hugh Grant, he's a good actor. His bumbling-guy
act is ingenious and works well in Notting Hill. This bumbling-guy
("Oopsie-daisies") act is what makes us like him in the film and bond with
his character. If it weren't for this, I don't think that his character
would have worked out. The two leads share tangible screen chemistry and
this also helps.
Someone worth mentioning is actor Rhys Ifans as William Thacker's flat-mate
Spike. Ifans is hilarious as Spike. Every time that Ifans is on screen it's
a laugh-out-loud moment. Look for his performance in the film, he steals
the movie. Another thing worth mentioning is the film score by Trevor
Jones. The score consists mostly of an acoustic guitar and fits the film
like a glove. It's a shame that the score hasn't been released on its own
CD, but you can find bits of the score on the Notting Hill soundtrack.
Notting Hill may not be the most original film, but it has all the right
elements to make it a Don't Miss film. If you're not planning on seeing
Star Wars: Episode I  The Phantom Menace, or are waiting for the lines to
die down, Notting Hill is the perfect film to catch. Don't Miss Notting Hill.

NOTTING HILL
Cast: Julia Roberts, Hugh Grant, Hugh Bonneville, Emma Chambers, James
Dreyfus, Rhys Ifans, Tim McInnerny, Gina McKee
Director: Roger Michell
Screenplay: Richard Curtis
Reviewed by Luke Buckmaster
On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
2 and a half stars
Recently cinema looked at what happened when an ordinary man rose to
instant stardom in EdTV, and in Notting Hill the premise is almost
reversed: what happens when a man whose mother barely remembers his name
becomes romantically involved with the world's most famous actress?
Surprising, not much.  Richard Curtis, who has established himself as a
fine comedy writer after Four Weddings and a Funeral and his work in
Blackadder and Mr. Bean, penned this gentle romantic comedy that takes
few risks and lacks a steady pace.  The highlights (and there are many)
of the picture do not come from Roger Michell's glossy direction, but
rather Curtis' sense of what type of humor works and when.
Hugh Grant plays William Thacker, owner of a travel bookstore in Notting
Hill, described as a "small village in the middle of a city."  He lives
with the "roommate from hell," Spike (Rhys Ifans), a lovable but
repulsive man who'd just as soon eat mayonnaise as he would yogurt.
Thacker lives a quiet, reasonably lonely life until our woman in
question, Anna Scott (Julia Roberts), walks into his shop and buys a
book.  Through a lucky coincidence (actually, there's quite a few in
this film), the two bump into each other again (literally), and love is,
um, in the air.  Of course, Thacker experiences a few problems with
dating the world's hottest star, ranging from a Hollywood boyfriend to
the paparazzi.
Hugh Grant reprises the style of acting that made his rise to fame
formidable.  His gentleman-like manners coupled with humorous dialogue
is an agreeable combination, and Grant, whose reputation has suffered
somewhat over the last few years (remember that incident with a
prostitute, anyone?) would be well advised to choose more roles of this
nature.  Julia Roberts really plays Julia Roberts, and does so with such
a loud sense of fame that she becomes a little irritating.  A cleverer
move would have been to cast Roberts' character to a relative unknown.
This would enable Anna Scott's fame to feel more original and fresh,
rather than forced.   I'm convinced that Roger Michell took the easy way
out.
But there's still plenty of things to like in Notting Hill, none of
which are quite as refreshing as the film's supporting characters.
William Thacker's group of friends are a delightful bunch.  One of them
fails to recognize Scott and, upon hearing that she is an actor,
explains that it is a low-paying profession ("So how much did you make
from your last film?" "Fifteen million.").  There's even a scene near
the end that positions most of them in a car, racing against time, all
screaming and screeching.  The driver stops the car and exclaims, "James
Bond never had to put up with this shit!"  Once again, Richard Curtis'
comedic sense is right on.
Although Notting Hill boasts fun characters and funny jokes (nowadays
its quite rare to find a romantic comedy that's actually funny), at its
heart is a relationship that's almost passionless.  I suspect that this
is largely due to Michell's direction, which seems to imply the romance
rather than develop it.  I got the sense that perhaps the best romantic
parts of Notting Hill were left on the editing room floor, or perhaps
they just weren't there to begin with.  Either way, Grant's
performance - though very enjoyable to watch - doesn't help.  He must
have something against revealing any emotion in his dialogue.  But
besides this rather major fault, let me stress again that Notting Hill
is a pleasing and often involving film.  And, if you can, I suggest that
you duck out of the cinema five minutes early to avoid a dreadful final
reel.

     Not to be glib, but there are two very simple reasons why so many
romantic comedies are so bad:  1) no romance; 2) no comedy.  The structure
is so simple it could be banged out by monkeys -- find two characters, put
them together, introduce an obstacle, tear them apart, resolve the
obstacle, bring them back together again.  That's where every romantic
comedy script begins, and sadly, that's also where most of them end.  See,
there's the not-so-small matter of creating two likeable characters whose
pairing is as plausible as their separation, as well as entertaining the
audience along the way to the foregone conclusion.  When your audience is
ready and willing to be charmed, a film's inability to generate wit or
warmth is inexcusable.
     NOTTING HILL, penned by FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL scribe Richard
Curtis, does everything a romantic comedy needs to do right.  Hugh Grant
plays William Thacker, a London bookseller living a simple if vaguely
lonely life.  That life is promptly turned upside down when Anna Scott
(Julia Roberts), the world's biggest female movie star, walks into his
shop.  Anna, the hounded subject of perpetual press coverage, is
understandably guarded; William, though a bit dazzled, is understated in
his treatment of the star.  Though Anna finds William's absence of fawning
unexpectedly appealing, plenty of barriers stand in the way of a potential
relationship:  famous boyfriends, paparazzi, geography and the uneasy way
celebrities interact with laypeople.
     The romantic side of NOTTING HILL works most effectively because
Curtis and director Roger Michell (PERSUASION) allow it to develop in
stages.  Initially, Anna and William's attraction to one other is 
abstract.  Anna is intrigued that William treats her with a degree of
normalcy, and longs for the simpler life she sees in William's interaction
with his group of friends; William, previously unlucky in love, is
overwhelmed by the prospect of being desired by one of the world's most
desirable women.  The abstractions give way to a more personal
understanding during a day spent together, which in turn give way to more
concrete realization of the different worlds in which they live.
Crackling with chemistry together, both stars give assured, engaging
performances while still leaving a few rough edges -- Anna's prickly
preoccupation with the perils of her fame, William's addiction to the
"love heroin" of his romance with a star.
     It's convenient that the writer who can put these romantic
developments together is also one of the finest comedy writers working.
Curtis -- a co-creator of both the wonderfully wordy "Blackadder" and the
purely physical "Mr. Bean -- has always had an impressive comic range.
Here he slides from the broad (Rhys Ifans as William's slovenly flatmate
Spike) to the silly (William's fumbling efforts to climb into a fenced
private garden) to the cleverly satirical (a film press junket William
muddles through posing as a reporter from "Horse and Hound Magazine") with
equal dexterity.  The solid supporting cast, including Tim McInnerny, Hugh
Bonneville and Emma Chambers, comes through with appealing work, but it's
Curtis' wicked way with a line or a visual gag that keeps the comic energy
high.
     NOTTING HILL does make the mistake of clocking in at a heavy 125
minutes, dragging out its denouement to an unnecessarily tortuous degree.
In fact, there are several occasions where the editing seems disjointed,
with odd cutaways and dialogue beginning too early.  The technical
glitches are perhaps more notable in a film which spins its romance
unabashedly into a confection that's pure Hollywood, and not just because
one of the characters is a Hollywood star.  This is romantic comedy in an
old-fashioned sense, where the pleasures come more from a zestful staging
than from foolish details like whether the relationship is "realistic."
NOTTING HILL takes you to a slightly heightened reality, a place where
movie magic moves you because it has found both the romance and the comedy
in romantic comedy.

Starring: Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant
Synopsis: 
Rich and famous actress Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) is walking down the
street when she bumps into William Thacker (Hugh Grant), the chatty,
handsome and humble owner of a tiny London bookstore barely making ends
meet. Of course he accidentally spills a drink on her, and it's love at
first sight. Thacker's underachieving, eccentric friends are thrilled for
him, but can a relationship between glitzy Hollywood royalty and a British
commoner really work out? 
Opinion:
We all know the romance formula. Cute meeting. Girl meets boy. Girl loses
boy. Fate draws them together for the big resolution. NOTTING HILL is no
different. The twist is that SHE is a celebrity and HE is a commoner, so
the situation makes for a fantasy relationship that any theatergoer or fan
can identify with. Meanwhile comic relief is provided by an underachieving
roommate. 
Julia Roberts does an excellent job playing Anna Scott, an overpaid and
indulged celebrity who admits she has very limited acting ability and that
her "acting" is merely good looks and body doubles. Anna is rotten at
relationships and carries a lot of petty emotional baggage. Roberts is
absolutely believable as the inept Anna. 
NOTTING HILL, however, must be considered a chick flick rather than a guy
flick. Women may thrill to a cute guy such as Hugh Grant's William Thacker,
but men are sure to abhor Thacker as someone from the legendary Neville
Chamberlain school of appeasement. Thacker humbly "understands" when Anna
sleeps around with other men. He kowtows and submits and indulges when Anna
throws cheap verbal abuse and directs mean-spirited tirades at him. His
answer to Anna's persistent bullying is, "Can I get you more tea, dear?"
Thacker needs a backbone, and fast. 
Male or female, if you continually are disrespected in a real relationship
and don't stick up for yourself the union won't last long. But we can
fantasize in NOTTING HILL, can't we?

Hmmm...let's see now. Julia Roberts was adorable in MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING
(7.5/10) and Hugh Grant was adorable in FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL (8/10),
so let's slap 'em together in another romantic comedy written by the same
dude who wrote the latter film, and voila...another great hit! Well...maybe
next time.
PLOT:
Ordinary boy meets extraordinary girl (famous movie star). Boy introduces
girl to friends and family. Boy falls for girl, girl falls for boy. Boy
loses girl to another boy (another famous movie star). Boy sulks. Girl
(still the famous movie star) comes back to boy. Happy once again. Boy loses
girl again. Darn! Girl comes back to boy...etc, etc, etc...well, you get the
picture!
CRITIQUE:
Very interesting premise starring two charming leads, offers a few chuckles
here and there, an unconvincing romance, languid pacing and a lot of empty
scenes played out specifically for laughs, to the detriment of plot. Add
that to the ending of this film which goes overboard in my opinion, despite
offering us the only true moment of action in the entire bit, and a complete
lack of any real drama, and you've got yourself a ho-hum romantic comedy,
built around a fantasy dream to which we could probably all relate. In fact,
before seeing this film I thought that the premise of this film was a
diamond in the rough, but only if they managed to build something more
around it than just the simple "boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy...".
After seeing this film, I'm afraid to report that there isn't much more in
there, folks.
Frankly, that would be fine if the actors in the film were convincing enough
in their roles, but I must say that I was far from convinced of anything
more than a simple novelty crush on a fidgety Englishman from the part of
Julia Roberts' character. And Hugh, well, every scene he was in basically
had him looking like a common Brit who was absolutely overwhelmed and in awe
of an American movie actress. Not in love with a woman. In awe of an
actress. I never FELT like either of these characters ever really cared for
one another as people, especially in the case of Hugh, who could not help
but look like a wounded puppy dog in every scene (blinking eyes and all),
whilst delivering some of the wittiest repartee this side of a
screenwriter's sharpest word processor. The supporting cast was pretty good,
but used strategically for laughs, and not much else. Admittedly, some of
the things that they were saying went right over my head (English accents
and all). Overall, a video rental at best, with a few grins here and around,
a fun and dreamy premise, but ultimately too repetitive, unconvincing and
just plain boring, to recommend with any enthusiasm.
Go rent WHEN HARRY MET SALLY (10/10) again, and thank me in the morning :)
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Hugh Grant received $1,000,000 for his role in this movie. Julia Roberts

Screenplay:  Richard Curtis.
When I was asked to see this movie with a friend, my initial reaction
was not Hugh Grant!' I was perhaps wrong to be so harsh, but after his
insidious flirtation with a street hooker, I just could not picture him
in any romantic lead.
What makes this movie a wonderful experience is not the fact it stars
Hugh, but because it stars Julia and carries with it a brilliantly
written script. This writer Richard Curtis, whose exceptional first work
Four Weddings and Funeral' shows us that he is a master in the domain
of the romantic comedy, with splashes of drama thrown in between.
Hugh and his hair, is almost identical to the character that made him
famous in Four Weddings'. He plays an ordinary guy who is down and out
on his luck. Unfortunately, he is type cast in this role, but
fortunately it works well for him in this movie. If only he would dither
a little less. Julia knows this role well. The glamorous movie star who
is searching for true love. There are moments in this movie, that you
almost weep for her pain felt loneliness. How sad it must be to be so
wealthy and beautiful, but to have no one to share it with.
The writer deals with difficult issues of love and social class on
various levels. How differences in social standing can make it almost
impossible for love to grow in such a harsh environment. How the media
can be as cruel as it can be attentive, and how fulfilment in life and
love can be found in forgiveness and sacrifice.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Julia Roberts?  Playing the role of the most popular actress on the
planet?  It sounds like the biggest head-trip in the world, but it's
actually Notting Hill, the best romantic comedy produced by Hollywood in
recent memory.
Roberts (My Best Friend's Wedding) plays Anna Scott, the kind of movie
star that often finds herself the fodder for tabloids all over the
world.  One day, on a rare occasion where she is not being ushered by a
publicist, Anna stumbles into a store that specializes in travel books.
The shop, located in the diverse Notting Hill section of London, is
owned by a chap named William Thacker (Hugh Grant, Nine Months).
Within a few minutes, William lives out the fantasy of every male over
the age of twelve  meeting a rich, beautiful celebrity and having her
instantly fall for your `regular guy' charm.  Of course, my fantasy
doesn't usually involve dumping orange juice down the front of her and
then having her clean up at your flat, which happens to be right across
the street.  In my fantasy, it's usually barbecue sauce.
Thanks to his Pig-Pen-esque Welsh roommate Spike (Rhys Ifans, Twin
Town), it's days before William finds out that Anna has called and asked
to meet at her hotel.  A gleeful William hurries to the hotel, only to
find himself smack in the middle of the press junket for Anna's latest
flick, the sci-fi thriller Helix.  This hysterical scene involves
William being mistaken as a member of the press (namely Horses and
Hounds magazine) and being forced to interview the stars of Helix, a
movie that he has never seen.  Believe me, critics will be raving about
this scene, as it plays out as a bit of an inside joke just for them.
The film really takes off when Anna accompanies William to his younger
sister's birthday party.  The partygoers try not to overreact to the
presence of such a huge star, while Anna, amazed by the activities of
common folk, just tries to fit in.  At the end of their next date Anna
asks William back to her hotel room, only to find her boorish boyfriend
(the well-cast boor Alec Baldwin), which brings both the wonderful
evening and their blossoming relationship to a screeching halt.
Notting Hill will likely draw comparisons to Best Picture nominee Four
Weddings and a Funeral (Richard Curtis wrote both Hugh Grant vehicles),
and with good reason.  In Four Weddings, the story was slowed down by
the romance between Grant and Andie MacDowell, just like it is here.
The best moments are not when director Roger Michell's (Persuasion)
camera focuses on just Hugh and Julia  they're when William's
close-knit friends, or the perpetually filthy Spike, are on the screen.
Although it's more than just a chick flick, will Notting Hill's female
viewers be able to sympathize with the Julia Roberts character?  Despite
the fact that she is both famous and gorgeous, Anna has more to complain
about than a leper at an arm wrestling competition.  My guess is that
they will.  Like Howard Stern eloquently said, `It's like Pretty Woman,
only in reverse!'  (2:03 - PG-13 for sexual content and mild adult
language)

I love a good fairy tale...always have since I was only knee-high. 
Why?  Because these are stories that you'd always like to see happen in
real life but probably never will.  These are dreams that you wish
would somehow come true.  These are the kinds of stories 'that can only
happen in the movies.'  "Notting Hill" can be called a fairy tale for
at its heart is a romantic comedy about two different types of people
that, in today's frenzied world, could never get together.  But in the
world of fairy tales, there's always a wonderful chance that the
impossible might happen.
The majority of us live rather uneventful and ordinary lives.  We are
the common folk who go to work every day to make an honest living, not
at all well-informed about happenings beyond our personal borders.  The
citizens of Notting Hill are equally 'plain.'  Many of us are probably
like unlucky-in-love William (Hugh Grant).  His personal life has been
marred by a series of broken hearts while his career lies behind the
counter of a travel bookstore that he owns and operates.  For him, the
seasons come and go just like the few customers that actually find
their way into his little store.  
One day, he and his store are visited by famous actress Anna Scott
(Julia Roberts).  Although somewhat starstruck, he sees her as
surprisingly down-to-earth, much like the proverbial girl next door. 
In turn, she finds him charming with a playful smile and a sense of
self-depricating humor.  But she really appreciates his life of
normalcy.  He's out of the limelight, but special in his own way.  This
and their other subsequent chance encounter brings out their attraction
for one another.  But being a celebrity has its drawbacks.  "Notting
Hill" is a smart film that acknowledges the tremendous obstacles that
these two must overcome.   With Anna's popularity, she desparately
protects her privacy while the merciless paparazzi follow her every
step.  For William, his fragile heart can barely take her frequent
flights into hiding.   It also shows how down-to-earth celebrities can
be.  The fame and glory can be daunting.  But she's just a normal girl
who wants to accompany William to his little sister's birthday party,
who gets her feelings noticeably hurt at a restaurant when an adjacent
table makes derisive comments about her, and who wants to steal kisses
in the middle of a darkened park.  But most of all, she says, "I'm just
a girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her."
Julia Roberts balances well her vulnerable girl against her own need to
protect herself.  She has always done well in fairy tales.  But it's
Hugh Grant, who I think, deserves a nod for his great comedy timing and
his charming mannerisms.  I especially liked this one scene where the
only way that he could see Anna was to masquerade as a magazine rep on
an interview.  He's not too media-savvy, and says that he's from Horse
& Hound.  "Are there any horses in your latest movie," he gingerly
asks?  Her reply is, "no, the movie was set in outer space."  He's at a
complete loss, and this is a very funny moment.  With its sunny
disposition, weepy ballad-filled soundtrack, and nice touches of
comedy, everyone can live happily ever after.

Julia Roberts is what I would call today's biggest female box office draw.  She
is best known for her romantic comedies, such as Pretty Woman and My Best
Friend's Wedding, and she just added another film to the ongoing list of great
films she has done.  In Notting Hill, Roberts plays Anna Scott, an extremely
popular and talked about actress.  In a way, Roberts is actually playing
herself her in Notting Hill.
William Thatcher, a resident of Notting Hill, London, is a bookstore worker who
is a huge fan of Anna Scott's.  He is faced with the reality he will never get
to meet her, but he continues his life anyway.  William's entire life and his
thoughts are changed one afternoon when Anna Scott herself enters his travel
book shop and browses around.  Little do the both of them know that Anna's
visiting that bookstore will turn into an ongoing relationship with William. 
The two continue to see each other, and they are both completely surprised and
happy with the relationship that has come to be.
>From here, we go into the regular, old romantic comedy theme.  The two are
split up, they get back together, there's a fight, etc.  The exact same formula
is used in virtually every romantic comedy, but in Notting Hill, the acting
from Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant made it so it didn't seem like the same old
thing.  Julia Roberts is terrific, as she is in all of her films.  Her
character is also quite a likable one.  She was a very interesting insight into
what it is actually like to be an actress that attracts so much attention.  We
got to learn that acting isn't all it is put up to be. Anna is played by Julia
with a lot of feeling and emotion, which really brought her character to life.
Hugh Grant has been around for awhile in show business, but he hasn't really
been in anything that will give him a wonderful name in moviegoer's minds. 
Notting Hill just did the trick for him.  Look for Hugh Grant to be seen in
many more movies after his terrific, realistic performance in Notting Hill.
There are two main problems present in Notting Hill which took away a lot from
the film as a whole.  One of those problems is the character of Spike, played
by Rhys Ifans, who is William's roommate.  The character is very annoying,
disgusting, un-funny, and his presence in the film almost made me want to walk
out.  Others in the theater laughed at his grossness, but I was petrified.  The
second main problem present in Notting Hill is the way it will use a character
for a laugh, and then throw them away like they were yesterday's newspaper.  We
get to see a character for about five seconds, and then they disappear after
they have tried made us laugh.  I don't like it when films use characters like
this for cheap laughs, and I rather see these characters more often in the
film, and to see them become more developed.  
Roberts and Grant weren't the only ones that gave outstanding performances. 
The supporting performances from actors added a lot to the film as well.  Gina
McKee, who played Bella, gave an extremely emotional performance.  Others who
gave great performances were Hugh Bonneville as Bernie, Emma Chambers as Honey,
and James Dreyfus as Max.  All of these characters are a part of William's
family, and all of their lives were changed by the meeting with Anna Scott.  
Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant go perfectly together as a romantic comedy couple.
 Their characters are both humorous, smart, likable, and on they are a lot of
fun to watch.  In many romantic comedies, the two main characters do not go
together very well on screen, but in Notting Hill, Roberts and Grant are
perfectly cast.  Although their relationship is often unbelievable, and much
like those of others in other romantic comedies, they are both very likable and
enjoyable.
Notting Hill has a great story.  It shows that your life can be changed in one
second, by something you never imagined would happen.  William's life was
completely changed by Anna Scott, and it wasn't because she was a huge actress,
but because of the person she was.  His family was also changed by the great
personality of Anna, and not because she was a huge, hyped actress.  I think
that the moral story here is very true and it should be learned by many of us
in today's world.
The Bottom Line- A realistic romantic comedy with a brain.  A huge brain.
