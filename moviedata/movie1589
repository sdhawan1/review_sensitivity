   Tonight I had a choice of seeing either Morgan Freeman
and the adorable Monica Potter in "Along Came a Spider" or
taking in a small movie by an untested director, "The Low
Down," and I chose the latter.  "Why in the world would you
do that?" a colleague about to head to "Spider" asked in
some disbelief.  "Well," I replied, "I never came face to face
with a serial killer and (hard to believe in these parlous times)
never even saw a guy with his gun drawn," (at least not since
my childhood days of playing with a cap pistol).  Now I'm not
against escapist movies and see quite a few each year but
tonight I was in the mood for a bit of naturalism, a
Chekhovian experience if you will.  By that I mean I wanted
to take a gander at ordinary people living in ordinary
relationships who were in some ways like me, and serial
killers do not fit the bill--at least not yet.
   "The Low Down" is dominated by people in their late
twenties: I can relate to that because in my former life I was
28 too.  The conversations of the people in debut director
Jamie Thraves's movie (whose script he penned as well) are
so real, so recognizable, that I felt at times ashamed to be
snooping on them, sharing their intimate secrets and
expressions of vulnerability.  Their dialogue seemed
improvised and, sure enough, according to the press notes,
Thraves did encourage his performers to be creative, but
there's nothing amateurish about the way they carry
themselves throughout the 96 minute story.  This is not
surprising considering that the lead, Aidan Gillen, may be
acting against type in the role of young Frank but he is also a
major player with a more aggressive role in the UK Channel
4's "Queer as Folk."
   "The Low Down" is a slice of Frank's life: his relationship
with two guys with whom he works as a creator of props for
magic shows and TV game shows, Mike (Dean Lennox Kelly)
and John (Tobias Menzies).  Principally, though, the tale
turns on the way that his relationship with the cute Ruby
(Kate Ashfield--a London stage actor who has interpreted
roles at the Royal Court) gives him impetus to change his life. 
Why should he change his life?  For one thing, at his age he
should be working toward his real goal: to be an artist, rather
than a talented artisan adept at creating trivial stage props.
For another, though he finally moves out of digs that he
ostensibly shares with another into a decent-size flat in a not-
too-fashionable area of North London, he is in and out of
relationships while his friends are beginning to settle down
and contemplate commitments.  
  What stands out especially in Aiden Gillen's performance is
the way he conveys his inner knowledge of his situation.  He
doesn't try to kid himself.  He knows there's something wrong
with the way he communicates with his friends and especially
with Ruby.  When he's with his new girl friend whom he met
when she, as a real estate agent, escorted him around some
flats, he's fine in the outdoors.  Indoors, though, he's uneasy
with her, at one point kicking a soccer ball around with her
and at another tossing cigarettes and catching them in his
mouth, at least once in each ten tries while his girl, trying to
be in synch with him, does likewise.
   Did I say that Frank's friends have grown up?  Let me
correct that.  To me, as someone who could possibly be their
granddad (though a very young one), they appear at times
obnoxious considering that they are post university and
pushing thirty.  John is repeatedly belittling the job he is
doing making those stage props, needling his partners to
such an extent that they are considering turning him loose,
while Mike is wont to do hackneyed impressions of the rich
and famous and getting drunk at parties.  The only really
non-Chekhovian scene--one which is welcome at this point
into the movie because so little outer action takes place that
when something hits the fan you're ready to cheer--involves a
violent scene between John and Frank who are quaffing brew
in a Norfolk pub and an inebriated macho man who curses
them out and challenges them to a skirmish.
   The film is not for everyone.  "Nothing happens," could be
a quote in the newspaper ad if the marketers feel like kidding
around, and I wouldn't want a steady diet of authenticity. 
After all when naturalism was introduced onto the stage in
1870, it died a, well, natural death.  Who wants to see
nothing but what you might eavesdrop on in the street on any
day?  But as long as movies like "Along Came a Spider" are
around, we should welcome a rest break now and then, just
as we look forward to a number of times out for ordinary talk
in any movie designed to appeal principally to the raw
emotions of the audience.

I like the slacker mentality, really I do.  Nights of parties, days of
sleeping them off, not a care in the world.  The sad thing is that, with
rare exception (namely Slacker), movies about the slacker mentality come
off as if they too were made without a care in the world.
The Low Down is Exhibit A when it comes to this offense.  Lazy,
meandering, mopey, and flat, this is a cheap-looking film obsessed with
showing off a hip image it doesn't actually have.
The brainchild of UK music video director Jamie Thraves, The Low Down
ostensibly tells the story of a guy named Frank (Aiden Gillen), a
twentysomething slacker who has a crisis of sorts as he realizes he has
no life.  Enter Ruby (Kate Ashfield), a fresh-faced lass, to try and
break him out of his funk.  Will he elevate himself into a new kind of
existence?  Jesus, I can't even make this sound interesting.
Sure enough, The Low Down is boring and trite, something that might have
been passable as a film school project if only Thraves had made it a
decade ago.  But this existential wannabe can't even drop in a wry joke,
as scene after scene starts flat and ends even flatter.  By the finale,
90 minutes later, we have a dumb, ambiguous ending dropped on us --
something that theoretically would challenge us to think about Frank's
condition, but doesn't work simply because we're too bored to care what
happens to Frank at all.  Thraves comes off as simply too afraid to make
a point.
As for its production, everything about The Low Down comes off as
cheap.  Shot on Super 16 and mostly with a handheld camera, it's
supposed to look avant garde and edgy.  Instead it looks rushed and
lazy.  The sound is just as bad, muffled and often drowned out by street
noise.  Which leaves me to wonder: Where is the music?  What kind of
music video director doesn't have a kickin' soundtrack to punctuate his
"art," anyway?  Not a very good one, I guess.
