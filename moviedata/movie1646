Peter Sellers made a number of bad movies, particularly
towards the end of his career.  But he also made many
good ones, movies that showed his tremendous range and
talent as a comedy actor.
In "I Love You, Alice B. Toklas!" Sellers portrays
a frustrated white collar worker, approaching middle age
and henpecked by both his mother (Jo Van Fleet) and
his clinging, shallow fiancee (Joyce Van Patten).
Disillusioned with his life, Sellers reject both it and
his fiancee.  He becomes a hippie, living with winsome
flower child Leigh Taylor-Young.  But he comes to realize
that his new life is just as empty as before, as is his
new relationship.
"I Love You, Alice B. Toklas!" is a satire.  It
effectively contrasts and ridicules the values and
lifestyles of hippies and squares in 1968 America.
The squares are always struggling: to succeed, to
conform, to win approval, even to survive.  The hippies
live in a delusional world of empty assertions of
love, aimless lifestyles, and banal philosophies.
What the hippies and squares have in common is that they 
have both no clue just how foolishly they are behaving.
The movie asks the question, "What is the best way to
live?" and gives the reply, "We will laugh at you no
matter which way you choose."
Fortunately, this well-directed film is funny consistently
enough that the audience will laugh too.
