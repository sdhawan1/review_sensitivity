     Natasha Richardson witnessed the death of her homosexual cousin the
summer before.  She has been saying some nasty things about him.  Maggie
Smith, her aunt, gets doctor Rob Lowe to come to Smith's house to
lobotomize Richardson, saying that she is crazy.  Lowe talks to
Richardson and finds out that she may not be so crazy.
     SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER was made for the BBC.  SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER is
based on the play by Tennessee Williams, which was also made into a film
in 1959 starring Elizabeth Taylor and Katherine Hepburn.  SUDDENLY LAST
SUMMER is a great film.  I definitely suggest that you try to see it.  I
give SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER a five on a scale of zero to five.  I didn't
see anything *too* objectionable in SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER.
     The costumes for this film are excellent.  They set the film
perfectly.  The script is excellent.  The sets used for the film are
also excellent.  I especially like how the garden looked.   This was my
introduction to Tennessee Williams work, and I am pleased to say that I
enjoyed it immensely.  I wish that American television would make films
this good.
     The cast for this film is perfectly picked.  Maggie Smith (HOOK) is
excellent.  She makes her character come alive.  Rob Lowe (ABOUT LAST
NIGHT..., ST. ELMO'S FIRE) is good, however, out of the cast, I liked
his performance the least.  Natasha Richardson (THE HANDMAID'S TALE) is
great.
