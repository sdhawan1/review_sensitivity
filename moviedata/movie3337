     Set in the offices of two psychoanalysts, and in a very bad French
restaurant, BEYOND THERAPY is a love story about two very confused people.
     Bruce (Jeff Goldblum) and Prudence (Julie Haggarty) meet through one of
many personal ads Bruce has placed.  They have a disastrous lunch, and leave
expecting never to see one an other again.  Of course, they do meet again.
     During the course of their relationship we are introduced to Bruce's
homosexual roommate/lover Bob, Bob's "theatrical" mother, Bruce's
psychoanalyst, and Prudence's psychoanalyst.  A series of bizarre coincidences
puts these six people on a collision course with the hilarious climax.
     BEYOND THERAPY builds momentum slowly.  The first 45 minutes, during which
the relationships between the main characters are reveled and expanded, are
slow sometimes to the point of being tedious.  About half of the people in the
audience walked out during this part of the film.
     But once all the players are lined up in their domino-like positions, the
film delivers a 20-minute punch line worth the wait.  When the final push
comes, the characters start to fall, and knock each other down with a very
satisfying crash.
