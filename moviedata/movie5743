Loren Dean is Mumford, the leading psychiatrist in the small town that
shares his name.  To paraphrase the press notes, while Mumford the town
has its share of secrets, Mumford the shrink has the biggest of all. 
This secret, treated in the film as a surprise but divulged by the film's
advertising campaign, is simple: Mumford is no licensed psychotherapist.
So who is Mumford, exactly?  While writer-director Lawrence Kasdan comes
up with a strangely convoluted backstory, it boils down to one simple
thing: he's a nice guy.  And what is _Mumford_, exactly?  Simply a nice
film.  But that's not as much of a compliment as it sounds.
This light ensemble comedy is pleasant to watch, and a lot of that ease
can be traced to the film's appealing ensemble cast, namely its standout
players.  Hope Davis shines as Sofie Crisp, the chronically-fatigued
patient for whom Mumford develops an unprofessional attraction.  Jason
Lee is, to borrow his character's catchphrase, "far out" as another of
Mumford's patients, Skip Skipperton, a young billionaire with a knack for
skateboarding (a characteristic that gives Lee the opportunity to flaunt
the skills that won him a number of international titles in his
pre-acting career).  Alfre Woodard radiates an inviting warmth as diner
owner Lily, who is also Mumford's landlord.
I make no mention of Dean, and that is not an accidental oversight. 
There is nothing particularly wrong with this performance, and his gentle
demeanor goes a long way in making the audience believe that people would
want to open up to him.  It's just that as a screen presence, Dean is
completely faceless, which makes him a perfect match for his character,
which similarly has neither quirks nor a distinct identity.  And that's
the film's central flaw; the only thing that is certain about Mumford is,
as mentioned before, that he's a nice guy.  While that indeed makes for a
likable protagonist, that doesn't make for a terribly interesting one.
The same can be said of the film's trite point.  There are a couple of
other (and bonafide) shrinks in town, Dr. Ernest Delbanco (David Paymer)
and Dr. Phyllis Sheeler (Jane Adams), but more people turn to Mumford. 
Not only is he easier to talk to, here's the kicker--unlike those two, he
actually _helps_ people.  Yes, the message of this film is the painfully
obvious: Mumford may not have a license, but his therapy works, and
that's what matters.
The banality of _Mumford_ wouldn't have mattered all that much if the
film had enough laughs, but those are in short supply.  Most come from a
running gag involving the television show _Unsolved_Mysteries_, and the
film's most comically promising character, a slimy lawyer played by
Martin Short, is barely a presence in the film.  So what's left are one
half of an interesting romance (the beguiling Sofie deserves someone with
a bit more zest than Mumford) and a handful of smiles.  Nice, yes.  But
nothing all that especially memorable.

Writer/director Lawrence Kasdan had a hand in penning some of the biggest
film successes of the 1980s. Yes, that's right, he co-wrote RAIDERS OF THE
LOST ARK (9/10), THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (8.5/10) and RETURN OF THE JEDI
(8/10). Now with this film, it looks as though he has decided to test his
skills at mediocre screenwriting and bland directing. And guess what? He
succeeds once again!
PLOT:
A man with a shady and regrettable past decides to run away and into a small
American town, where he pretends to be a licensed psychologist to an
open-armed swarm of people with problems. It isn't long before he befriends
the small-town billionaire, folks become suspicious and he falls for one of
his own patients.
CRITIQUE:
This film is not a comedy! It is a drama. I say this right up front because
from the looks of the trailer, you would think that this film secures its
base in humor, but unfortunately for us, it does not. It is a serious film
(seriously flawed if you ask me, but I digress) which offers a couple of
witty quips to keep you awake, but overall, just sits there. Now on to my
review. This movie sucks because it was slow and boring, starred an
uninteresting protagonist with an unbelievable past, included extremely dull
patients whose problems left me indifferent at best and pissed at worst, and
certified it all with many a predictable ending. I have no idea what
Lawrence Kasdan was trying to accomplish with this picture, but whatever it
was...he missed! Anyone without his name could never have made this film
because it is an extremely generic puff-piece, which on a good day, might be
described as predictably digestible. It's no wonder that the studio is
trying to sell it as a comedy! It sucks as a drama, and bored my movie
cohort right to sleep.
I've given it four points on four extremely shallow yet distinguishable
marks. First of all, I couldn't help but think about how much the lead
actor, Loren Dean, looked like a young Charles Grodin. He even acted like
him, save for the dry, sardonic wit. This kept me interested in watching him
at least. Number two, and this one is really shallow (seemed to be geared
that way as well), there were quite a few "titshots", as they would say back
in high school. And God help me if I can't get enough of those in an aimless
drama. And three, and this one surprised me the most, actor Ted Danson's
cameo (yes, he will always be Sam Malone to us real fans!) was the best part
about this movie and actually made me see him as a different person. A
different asshole, but a different person nonetheless. If ever you rent this
movie one day (promise you won't throw away your hard-earned money at the
theaters?!), wait for his scene because it's actually pretty good. Other
than that, drab, drab, drab and drab. Even Jason Lee, a personal favorite of
mine, was left out to dry with lame dialogue and one of the phoniest
romances to hit the big screen in a while. Well, at least he finally "came
out" and did some real skateboarding in this movie! Oh yeah, and I guess
that's the fourth point in my rating.
Anyway, if you enjoy watching boring patients babble on about their boring
problems to an uninteresting psychologist...this film's your bag! Otherwise,
skip it and see ANALYZE THIS (8/10) again...now there's a great shrink
movie!
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
"Three's Company" fans alert!!! Terri from the TV show, also known as
actress Priscilla Barnes, plays a small but pivotal part as the landlady in
this film. The scene is actually a fantasy sequence and does feature
cleavage, so stay tuned, kids! Also, it is to note that the actress was once
named "Penthouse Pet of the Month" in March of 1976. She was known as one
Joann Witty back then. She's originally from Jersey.
Who the hell is Loren Dean, the dude who plays Mumford in this film? You got
me, but all I know is that he was born in Las Vegas in 1969 and played the
character of Billy Bathgate in the 1991 film of the same name.
Jason Lee was born in the state of California in the year of 1971. He was a
professional skateboarder before his acting career took off after MALLRATS
(6/10), and even owns his own skateboarding company called Stereo
Manufacturing Corp. He's been in every Kevin Smith film except for CLERKS
(8.5/10).
Listen closely and you will hear the pharmacist in this film (the ballooning
actor formerly known as Pruit Taylor Vince) make a reference to the "lost
ark", which is obviously an in-joke, considering that it is the
writer/director of this film, Lawrence Kasdan, who co-wrote RAIDERS OF THE
LOST ARK (9/10). Kasdan also played the part of Dr. Green in 1997's AS GOOD
AS IT GETS (8/10).
Ted Danson also played the role of lawyer Peter Lowenstein in Kasdan's 1981
directorial debut BODY HEAT starring a sexy Kathleen Turner and William
Hurt.

     Lawrence Kasdan has grown to adore narrative sprawl.  A writer who
once contributed to tight genre entertainments like THE EMPIRE STRIKES
BACK, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and BODY HEAT, Kasdan became a film-maker
with a problem: He over-indulged his own characters, and let his stories
wander wherever those characters wanted to go.  He attracted wonderful
actors because he wrote wonderful parts, but he seemed little interested
in making those parts part of a whole.  Sometimes (THE BIG CHILL,
SILVERADO, GRAND CANYON) those untamed scripts still turned into
satisfying episodic films; sometimes (THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST, WYATT EARP)
they turned into meandering acting showcases.
     MUMFORD, Kasdan's latest exercise in free-form ensemble, has the germ
of a great story at the core of his narrative...and he promptly drowns
that germ in the pencillin of his herky-jerky directing.  The story begins
in the small town town of Mumford, where a recently-arrived psychologist
also named Mumford (Loren Dean) is developing a booming practice with his
unconventional methods.  Doc Mumford endears himself to virtually
everyone, including the town's equally unconventional billionaire modem
magnate Skip Skipperton (Jason Lee), but it turns out Doc Mumford has a
secret.  Though his therapy brings results, his credentials aren't exactly
conventional either.  In fact, he's not a psychologist at all.
     It takes a while before Kasdan spills all the beans about Doc 
Mumford's back story, but by then you can already see everything that's
right and everything that's wrong about MUMFORD.  On the plus side --
predictably for a Kasdan film -- is the cast, filled with appealing
character performers.  Loren Dean's low-key, natural delivery is perfect
for the no-nonsense Doc Mumford, Jason Lee shows a sweetness far more
convincing than it was in KISSING A FOOL, and the radiant Hope Davis lends
her unique gifts to Sofie, the chronically fatigued patient for whom Doc
Mumford falls.  Kasdan drops these characters into the kind of bucolic,
milkman-served town that would appeal to anyone looking for a fresh start.
It's the ideal set-up for a comic romance with complications.
     But MUMFORD isn't a comic romance with complications, at least not
often enough.  Much of its running time is devoted to Doc Mumford's
sessions with a variety of patients:  a housewife who shops compulsively
(Mary McDonnell); a pharmacist with pulp fiction fantasies (Pruitt Taylor
Vince); a sulky teen with self-image problems (Zooey Deschanel).  Though
the actors are all fine, their characters are a huge distraction.  Kasdan
certainly needs to show Doc Mumford's gift for helping people, but he
includes far too many such scenes.  Once again, Kasdan finds himself
unable or unwilling to rein in his supporting characters.  In the process,
he loses track of MUMFORD'S backbone, creating a film that bumps along
with virtually no flow.
     That lack of momentum is most evident when it becomes clear that
MUMFORD's payoff will be a relationship between Mumford and Sofie.  There
are a couple of perfectly charming scenes between Dean and Davis, but
there's no way to anticipate that the film is leading up to a choice based
on those scenes.  MUMFORD more often plays as a subtle jab at therapy,
suggesting that a really good listener who knows something about
overcoming troubles is all an unhappy soul really needs.  That's an
interesting enough concept, but it doesn't exactly make for a satisfying
story; watching Doc Mumford's patient list hijack the film only emphasizes
that MUMFORD should have been about the doctor.  The saying goes that
there are no small parts, only small actors.  Lawrence Kasdan seems to
agree...to a fault.

On a sunny, green-grassy day in small town Mumford, a 1940's milk truck
pulls up just as Dr. Mumford steps off with a patient for a little walk-talk
therapy: textbook "trite." And it's just the first layer of the cake. Still,
"Mumford" has plenty of good movie baked right in -- all that creamy white
schmaltz just can't bog it down. In fact, the fluff kind of rises to the
surface after the fact. Kind of like pleasuring yourself with the way
birthday cake tastes divine while you're eating it; but then on the ride
home from the party, your stomach may have a few points of its own to make.
The ads reveal a secret that ought to be held for the halfway point of the
film (skip this paragraph if you don't want to know). Though he's having
overwhelming success with the Mumfordonians; Dr. Mumford isn't a real
psychologist. And of course, there's a love story (or two or three) thrown
in for good measure.
It's a cozy film with fun characters, fine dialogue and an inspiringly warm
and fuzzy theme. You won't have a bad time, though you'll want for your next
flick to be one completely lacking sugar. I liked it!

"Mumford" would appear to have a great deal going for it, and it does. An 
extraordinary ensemble cast, resembling that of writer-director Lawrence 
Kasdan's marvelous previous efforts (1983's "The Big Chill," 1991's "Grand 
Canyon"); a director who has proven his filmmaking skills many times before; 
and the fact that it would be primarily character-driven, all gave reason to 
expect that this would be a bright, winning, and intelligent comedy. Little 
by little, as the film played itself out, it became abundantly clear that 
"Mumford" is a prime example of a movie that is played out entirely on the 
surface, with not a thought or idea beneath the characters' exteriors. What 
Kasdan has done here is taken a step way down; where his two aforementioned 
pictures earned points for their knowing human observations and realism, 
"Mumford" is strictly a television sitcom masquerading as a feature film, and 
is instantly forgettable once the end credits begin to roll.
The peculiarly-named psychologist, Dr. Mumford (Loren Dean), showed up in the 
quaint, Mayberry-style town of Mumford only three month ago, and the 
residents are already starting to flock to him, whether they really need 
therapy or not. Sharing a home with self-named cafe owner Lily (Alfre 
Woodard), Mumford has the gift to be able to really listen to what people 
have to say, and more often than not can completely understand and sympathize 
with their problems. Some of his patients include Althea (Mary McDonnell), a 
compulsive shopper who is married to a jerk (Ted Danson) and has two worried 
teenage kids; a pharmacist (Pruitt Taylor Vince) with such low self-esteem 
that he is constantly making up fantasy stories about a large guy with big 
abs; Nessa (Zooey Deschanel), a rebellious, pretty young girl; and a lawyer 
(Martin Short) who talks and talks but doesn't seem to have anything worth 
saying. Seeked out by Skip Skipperton (Jason Lee), an appealing, young 
technology genius who also happens to be a billionaire and the creator of the 
Panda Modem, Mumford quickly becomes good friends with him. Later, a possible 
romance flares up when he is won over by the innocent, kind-hearted Sophie 
(Hope Davis), who has come to him for help on curing her of her Chronic 
Fatigue Syndrome. At first a little stand-offish, Mumford and Sophie begin to 
spend some time together, and as they become closer and closer, Sophie's 
exhaustion gradually vanishes. 
If "Mumford" sounds rather aimless and with very little of an actual plot, 
that's because it is. For 111 minutes, the film is non-stop dialogue, usually 
between two characters at any given time, and while this has the chance to 
work wonderfully (see 1995's charming "Before Sunrise," in which two 
twentysomething strangers get off a train in Vienna and spend the day and 
night together before going their separate ways), "Mumford" is bogged down by 
a paper-thin, artificial screenplay, by Kasdan, that never stops feeling 
"written," and thoroughly mishandles its wide array of characters. The film 
wanders around without any clear destination, and with very few story or 
character developments, and therefore, grows monotonous by the half-way mark. 
It's difficult to dedicate any sort of rooting interest in a group of people 
who, for the most part, are either uninteresting creations or disappointingly 
wasted.
With such a strong cast, one wonders what the principle actors were so 
attracted to with this particular film. On the positive side, there isn't a 
mediocre performance to be had. On the negative side, the characters are 
never given a chance to spring to life, because its potential simply is 
nowhere to be found on the written page. Loren Dean, who appears in almost 
every scene as Mumford, is low-key and remarkably appealing, one of the most 
promising, fresh performances this year. His character of Mumford, however, 
always seems to be standing at arm's length from the audience, and we never 
really get to know him, aside from the obligatory background info that is 
told in an overlong, patience-testing flashback. 
Hope Davis, the stunningly versatile actress from such pictures as 1997's 
"The Daytrippers," 1998's "Next Stop Wonderland," and 1999's "Arlington 
Road," is likable as always as the weary, recently-divorced Sophie. Dean and 
Davis work well together and have a lot of chemistry, but each of their 
scenes seem like nothing more than character filler, rather than the natural 
dialogue that one usually speaks. Their eventual romance, unfortunately, 
feels too orchestrated on the screenplay level to set off any fireworks.
Jason Lee (1997's "Chasing Amy"), as Skip, forms a nice rapport with Dean, 
and the friendship that is developed between the two is the film's most 
effective element. Lonely and constantly used by people who only like him for 
his money, Skip chooses Mumford to be his buddy because he knows that he 
wouldn't judge him on a materialistic level, and is overly enthusiastic about 
the technological inventions he is always cooking up. 
Also of note is the effervescent Alfre Woodard, an always-engaging and 
criminally underappreciated actress who, coincidentally, had a meatier, more 
satisfying role in Kasdan's powerful "Grand Canyon;" and Zooey Deschanel 
(daughter of famed director of photography, Caleb Deschanel), in her film 
debut, who has a natural charisma and authenticity that is absent from every 
other character in the film. Making no impression in even slighter, 
criminally empty roles are Jane Adams, so astounding in 1998's "Happiness," 
as the town's other psychologist; David Paymer as a resident psychiatrist; 
and Ted Danson, who has all of one scene as McDonnell's husband.
Everything leads up to a courtroom scene that, thankfully, isn't as 
manipulative as it is just-plain contrived. By the conclusion, the majority 
of the central characters have either fallen in love with someone, or have 
become emotionally at ease due to their connection with another, but it is 
distastefully unjustified. Kasdan has chosen to paint his characters with the 
broadest, most general strokes possible, and has forgotten to do one thing: 
develop them. "Mumford" is an intellectually vacant and pointless excursion 
to a town that is almost frightening in its artificiality. In fact, I 
wouldn't have been particularly surprised had "The Brade Bunch" made cameos 
as Mumford's next-door neighbors.

Susan Granger's review of "MUMFORD" (Touchstone Pictures)
 What does it take to be a good psychologist?  How can you get
people to confide their fantasies, dreams, and frustrations in order
to alleviate the pain of the human condition? Writer/director Lawrence
Kasdan believes that listening, really listening is the most important
skill - and that's the premise for his intelligent, amusing new
comedy. Loren Dean ("Billy Bathgate") stars as Dr. Mumford, a young
psychologist who opens a practice in a small, picturesque town,
coincidentally named Mumford, and discovers his unorthodox form of
therapy has amazing, unexpected results with an odd assortment of
quirky locals. There's a young divorcee suffering from Chronic Fatigue
Syndrome (Hope Davis), a pulp-fiction obsessed pharmacist (Pruitt
Taylor Vince), a frustrated housewife (Mary McDonnell) who's become
addicted to mail-order shopping, her workaholic husband (Ted Danson),
a fashion-preoccupied teen (Zooey Deschanel), Mumford's outspoken
landlady (Alfre Woodard) who runs the local cafe, and a lonely
billionaire (Jason Lee), the monarch of modems, who zips around on a
skateboard. While they respond to his empathy and frankness, no one
realizes that mysterious, unconventional Dr. Mumford has the biggest
secret of all - except maybe a suspicious attorney (Martin Short) and
the two other therapists in town (David Paymer, Jane Adams).  Like
"The Big Chill," "The Accidental Tourist," and "Grand Canyon," this is
an excellent ensemble effort, which is a credit to Kasden's talent for
casting. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Mumford" is a
fantastical, intriguing 8, proving that love comes in many disguises.

"I never saw A Purple Cow/ I never hope to see one/But I can tell 
you, anyhow/I'd rather see than be one." (Gelett Burgess, 1866-? 
though often attributed to Ogden Nash)
I never saw a shrink. I hope I never will.  The mind-analyzers or 
healers I know are movie characters. By those standards, Mumford is 
most unorthodox.
He's  played by Loren Dean, 30, who has acted in at least a dozen 
movies I've seen -- but I cannot remember him. Here his Mumford 
looks 30 too.  Unlike so many movie shrinks -- especially in 
comedies -- he's not older,  bearded. has no German accent and 
doesn't act shrinkingly. Who's that man?
He has set up business in a relatively shabby office in a smallish 
town called Mumford, too. Ah, there must be a catch to this, but 
what?  Mumford is an old mill-town (no joke about Miltown the 
medicine) which had fallen into bad times but recovered thanks to 
the Panda Modem factory which employs most of the Mumfordians.
Being ignorant of the ratio of shrinks, I would think that the two 
already in Mumford were plenty.  When Mumford appears, three's a 
crowd. He becomes the most popular of his genus, with methods that 
are un-kosher. How he listens or does not, how he interrupts his 
patients, how he cuts them off and even dismisses them, how he does 
everything else are, to put it mildly, different if not odd  But 
he's not "colorful" either.
His clients range from pathetic to compulsive to sweet to 
obnoxious.They are weirdos, but when all is said and done, you like 
them. Something of a modified, sophisticated Frank Capra seems to 
lie beneath the film's exterior.
Most people like Mr Mumford, starting with Alfre Woodard his 
landlady, neighbor and  cafe-owner. Appealing, wise but not 
sententious, probably complex, she's the one major character who 
would never need to consult a shrink. But young  geek Skip 
Skipperton does.
He's the Panda Modem creator, is worth three billion dollars 
already, is likable, has his own problems, spends most of his time 
skateboarding like a champion, does some strange things. To avoid 
the publicity,  he proposes to Mumford that they meet not as doctor 
and patient but as friends. Which they become in reality. It works. 
Mumford, in fact, most unprofessionally, discusses his other 
patients with him. Original, to say the least.
Without making this film primarily a setting for characters, or a 
love story, or a mystery, these and other elements are all there, 
nicely blended, humorously treated, cleverly sketched out. We feel 
that Mr Mumford, an addict of Unsolved Mysteries on TV,  has his 
owns secrets. There are little clues from the start, but they do not 
point to specifics.  We may or may not begin to guess what's up as 
the film unfurls. Yet nothing hits you over the head, you are kept 
watching, enjoying , smiling, and very often, laughing.
All performances hit the spot.  So does Lawrence Kasdan's track 
record, as writer, director  and producer. The first movie he made 
was Body Heat (1981). Then came The Big Chill, Silverado, The 
Accidental Tourist, I Love you to Death, Grand Canyon, Wyatt Earp, 
French Kiss. A select, unhurried body of work, often original and 
pioneering, stressing psychology (unpedantically), interractions 
among people, often several of them. There's clarity and sensitivity 
there, as well as humor as in movies he wrote and others directed: 
Two of the Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark, for instance.
The consistency of a very good "auteur" runs throughout the variety 
of his work. Mumford is the most recent link in a remarkable chain.

Author
David N. Butterworth
        The town of Mumford is filled with so many cranks, oddballs, and
eccentrics that it requires the services of not one but three licensed
psychologists to keep all that angst in check.  Actually, "licensed" is a
bit of a stretch since the intriguing premise of Lawrence Kasdan's ("The
Big Chill," "Silverado," "Grand Canyon") latest film is that one of these
professionals is not exactly certified.  So much for the drama; that
"revelation" is out on the table simply from reading a twenty-five word
synopsis.
        "Mumford" strives for that same multi-character ensemble chic so
glowingly realized by the likes of Robert Altman and Alan Rudolph.  The
feel of Kasdan's film, however, is more like an extended episode of
"Northern Exposure," where the good doctor gets to do his thing and say his
piece and everyone around him grows a little in the process.
        The characters who frequent the couch of Dr. Mumford (peculiarly
the psychologist bears the same name of the town, but nothing really comes
of that) are a wacky bunch it's true.  There's a sexually-frustrated
pharmacist (Pruitt Taylor Vince) who fantasizes in the style of those '50s
dime-store paperbacks with names like "Sucker Bait"--"all I needed was a
stiff drink, a cold shower, and a hot dame."  There's a skateboarding head
of a multi-national modem conglomerate, played by "Chasing Amy"'s Jason
Lee.  And there's a shy, delicate woman who's probably suffering from
chronic fatigue syndrome (Hope Davis).
        These are among the better-developed characters.  Ted Danson, Mary
McDonnell, and Alfre Woodard try to get inside their less-well developed
roles and have a tougher time of it.
        For a movie with so many recognizable stars, Loren Dean is an odd
casting choice as Mumford.  Dean's filmography is interesting--"Billy
Bathgate," "Gattaca," and "Enemy of the State" to name a few--but he
certainly isn't a household name.  In "Mumford," Dean doesn't so much act
as re-act; his dialogue is peppered with a great many hmms and uh-huhs as
he takes stock of his clients' odd little quirks and preoccupations.
Perhaps being a good listener is key to being a good psychologist, but it's
a risky personality trait with which to saddle your leading man.
        After some impressive opening achievements (director of "Body
Heat," screenwriter of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and a couple of early
"Star Wars" sequels), Kasdan's work has slumped into mediocrity and below.
His recent turns at bat have been potentially interesting yet ultimately
futile affairs--"French Kiss," "Wyatt Earp," and "I Love You to Death"
spring to mind.
        "Mumford," alas, is no exception, a film bogged down by
fair-to-middling writing, uninspired direction, and a central conceit that
never really takes off.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
The premise is simple:  Man moves to small Midwestern town that shares
his name, pretends to be a psychiatrist, and is actually able to offer
better advice than the burg's other two shrinks.  His patients are
quirky and their characters are well-developed and well-played by
capable actors.  Yet, somehow, the film really struggles to be even
mediocre.
Written and directed by Hollywood vet Lawrence Kasdan (French Kiss), who
has a long resume of overly praised middling pictures, Mumford stars
Loren Dean (Enemy of the State) as the fraudulent Dr. Mumford.  He chose
this particular town to set up shop simply because it happened to have
the name of the identity he had recently created to avoid a shady past.
In town for just a few months, Dr. Mumford has quickly become the mental
health M.D. of choice among the Mayberry-esque community, and begins to
take clients from the town's other two shrinks.
His patients are almost too quirky to believe.  The pharmacist (Pruitt
Taylor Vince, Murder One) has steamy sex fantasies straight out of a
Russ Meyer flick; a young bulimic goth chick (Zooey Deschanel) says
things just for shock value; the wife of a successful financier (Mary
McDonnell, 12 Angry Men) is a mail-order shopaholic; and a young lady -
and the doctor's obvious eventual love interest  suffers from a case of
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
The good doctor is also sought by Mumford's richest individual  a young
skateboarding techno wiz named Skip Skipperton (Jason Lee, Chasing Amy)
who created PandaModem, the town's largest employer and international
business that has nabbed 23% of the modem market's share.  He's worth 3
billion big ones, but would have traded all of it to make the varsity
baseball team.  Skip feels he needs psychiatric help, but doesn't want
to alarm either his stockholders or the townsfolk, who see PandaModem as
a necessity since the timber industry has recently dried up.  So he asks
Dr. Mumford to pretend to be his friend and dispense therapeutic advice
while tossing a football around.  Why would such a happy-go-lucky guy
need mental help?  He's building a synthetic sexual surrogate/companion
(read: sex doll) and is afraid that his latest venture could be wrong
and dirty.
Things proceed as planned for Dr. Mumford until he tosses new patient
and slimy local defense attorney Lionel Dillard (Martin Short) out of a
session for being too irritating.  Dillard turns to Mumford's other two
legit shrinks - Dr. Ernest Delbanco (David Paymer, Payback) and Dr.
Phyllis Sheeler (Jane Adams, Happiness)  and suggests that Dr. Mumford
may be an uneducated impostor, which leads to an investigation and
eventual outing.
Mumford offers precious little that you wouldn't already expect prior to
walking into the theater.  There is only one real stand-out scene  a
great grainy flashback to his previous life and past jobs.  Dean is
merely adequate - his baked-bean teeth are disturbing and distracting.
Lee is totally wasted in a role where he can't curse, able to only
either mutter `far out' or repeat someone else's line in question form.
The supporting players make the film.  Barely.  (1:51 - R for
sex-related images, language and drug content)

Although he has only been in town for a little over four months, Dr. 
Mumford already has more patients than the other two therapists in 
the small, homey village. Mumford has a way about him. He avoids 
technical jargon, has a surprisingly frank approach and, more than 
anything, he is great at listening. So great that most clients find 
it easy to share their deepest secrets with him, even though he is 
awfully casual in the area of patient confidentiality. What they 
don't know about Mumford is that the good doctor has a secret of his 
own. As he eventually tells a skateboarding billionaire who becomes 
his patient and friend, "I am not now, nor have I ever been, a 
psychologist."
This gentle comedy shares a few similarities to "The Big Chill," 
another film from writer/director Lawrence Kasdan. Both are 
structurally loose, with next to no major conflict. Instead, the 
focus is on the small personal dramas of a number of nicely-drawn 
characters. Both productions tend to wander, hopping from one subplot 
to another. While I generally find meandering of this sort annoying, 
it proves refreshing in this context, largely due to the 
overwhelmingly benign nature of the story. With its sweet, easygoing 
tone, "Mumford" is the cinematic equivalent of a nice lazy stroll on 
a fall evening with a glass of iced tea in hand. 
Loren Dean gives a wonderfully low-key performance as the mysterious 
young therapist. Although Mumford's name and credentials are phony, 
his intentions are genuine. He cares so much for his patients that he 
dares to speak his mind. When shopaholic mother Althea Brockett (Mary 
McDonnell) complains that "my kids say if I don't get therapy they'll 
have nothing to do with me," he nods and states "Good kids." When 
lethargic patient Sofie Crisp (Hope Davis) asks if he believes 
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a genuine illness or just a justification 
for doing nothing, he replies, "I don't know what's real and what 
isn't. That's never been my strong suit." 
After Sofie leaves, Mumford goes online to read about CFS and comes 
up with an interesting form of treatment, holding future sessions 
while the two walk though town. Sofie soon finds herself helping the 
doc cover a neighbor kid's paper route, as her energy, spirit and 
affection for the therapist grows ever stronger.
As the film progresses, we learn more about the motivations behind 
Mumford's big deception, and the revelations add poignancy and 
clarity to the character. Loren Dean, whose handsome features have a 
curiously unfinished quality, is an enormously likable actor, aided 
immeasurably by two exceptional supporting players. As Lily, 
Mumford's landlady and friend, Alfre Woodard is earthy and beguiling. 
Although her screen time is limited, she has a presence that lingers 
even when Lily is away running her neighborhood café.
Jason Lee, so deliciously acidic as Banky in "Chasing Amy," gives the 
sunniest performance of his career as Skip Skipperton, a billionaire 
computer mogul who craves friendship so badly that he hires Mumford 
primarily to be his buddy. Despite his wealth, Skip is still just a 
lonesome kid (his corporate headquarters has an elaborate skateboard 
ramp) and Lee is quite effective at blending the character's 
endearing combination of intelligence and naiveté. The role also 
gives the former international skateboard champion a chance to show 
off his considerable skills at the sport. 
I wish the film had spent more time with Mumford, Sofie, Lily and 
Skip, and less on the campaign by a smarmy lawyer (Martin Short) to 
discredit Mumford. Even though there are some amusing moments with 
Short and a pair of therapists (David Paymer and Jane Adams), the 
film could have reached the same conclusion without the subplot. 
Lawrence Kasdan directs his story in a down-to-earth fashion, saving 
visual frills for flashbacks and noirish sequences illustrating the 
pulp fantasies of nebbish pharmacist Henry Follet (Pruitt Taylor 
Vince). Kasdan juggles his vignettes fairly well, although they 
become a bit scattered late in the film. To his credit, an obligatory 
courtroom scene is short, crisp and avoids the usual clichés. James 
Newton Howard provides the music, which consistently accents the tone 
of the story without ever becoming manipulative or overbearing. 
Some critics have savaged "Mumford," calling it nothing but an 
aimless, lackadaisical trifle. While the script might have benefited 
from more polishing, I like what Kasdan has done here. At one point, 
Dr. Mumford wonders aloud if any therapy can really cure problems 
that started in early childhood. Instead, he uses charm, common sense 
and empathy to help those around him grow and feel just a little 
better. After watching "Mumford," I not only felt a little better, I 
was downright happy. This particular trifle turned out to be the 
right treatment for me.

"Kind of impatient for a big-time head shrinker, aren't you. How about
you let me explain it my way, ok? Thanks, that'd be great."
Starring Loren Dean, Hope Davis, Jason Lee, Alfre Woodard, Martin Short,
David Paymer, Ted Danson. Rated R.
The great thing about Robert Altman's Cookie's Fortune is that aside
from being entertainingly quirky, it was warmhearted, sunny and subtly
emotional. What mires down the similarly eccentric Lawrence Kasdan
comedy Mumford is that it isn't any of those things. It remains
emotionally distant and oddly impersonal; its protagonist's true
feelings a mystery to the audience. We laugh, we're entertained, but we
can't get involved. We're simply denied access.
Mumford is about Dr. Mumford from the town of Mumford. Dr. Mumford
(Loren Dean) is a psychologist who has only been in town a couple weeks
and he already has more patients then the other two area head doctors
combined. So talented is he that he is approached by the town's most
affluent citizen, Skip Skipperton. You see, Skip is a computer whiz and
owner of "Panda Modem", a company which employs most everyone who lives
in Mumford. Skip is lonely and wants the doctor's help, but wants it
discreetly. He is afraid that his company's stock may tumble if people
find out he is visiting a psychologist. He wants Dr. Mumford to treat
him without anyone finding out.
If you have not been exposed to this movie's advertising campaign and do
not want to know its "secret" which is revealed in all the trailers,
read no further.
Dr. Mumford gets to like Skip Skipperton, who reveals all of his secrets
to him. So he tells Skip a secret of his own. He is not, "nor has [he]
ever been" a psychologist. How he has managed to keep his lack of
credentials a secret baffles Skip, who insists that while Doc Mumford
may not be a psychologist, he's good at it. His other patients may or
may not agree. Seeing as he treats nearly everyone in the town, the rest
of his clientele, whom we get to know fairly intimately is an eccentric
group indeed. The head cases include: Nessa, a angst-ridden teenager
pissed off about everything that it is possible to get pissed off about
and then some; Henry, a troubled pharmacist obsessed with his film-noir
style sexual fantasies which he doesn't deem himself worthy of starring
in; and finally Sophie, a woman allegedly afflicted with Chronic Fatigue
Disorder, and a woman Dr. Mumford winds up falling in love with.
None of these people have any idea that their trusted psychologist is a
fake (why he is pretending to be a P.h.D. I will not reveal), and they
go on confiding in him. He is good at what he does: he's a terrific
listener and a perceptive person. But nevertheless he is not a doctor,
and it isn't long before he is hounded by the certification board.
We are allowed to get to know Dr. Mumford's patients almost
uncomfortably well. They are surprisingly interesting people: complex
and often touchingly troubled. That's all well and good, but what about
our main character? Don't we need to get to know him? Writer-director
Lawrence Kasdan (The Big Chill) keeps Dr. Mumford strangely isolated
from the audience. We never have the privilege of being involved in his
feelings, his thoughts, his motives. When the love story subplot rolls
around, we have a hard time accepting it because we don't know what's
driving Mumford. We scarcely get any clues about the man's nature. The
situation is hardly helped by Loren Dean's performance; he underplays
his role to the point where he looks like he is reciting his lines off a
teleprompter.
There's something else plaguing Mumford; a flaw that bugged me only in
retrospect: it is a naggingly unprogressive movie. Common sense dictates
that a storyline should, in some way, progress from point A to point B.
Wierder films may have it backwards or may be jumping all over the
place, but its protagonists change, as do the people around them.
Mumford starts at point A and never really goes anywhere. As I walked
out of the theater, I thought about what I saw and realized that the
only elements that changed were the Doc's patients. But was the film
about them? Our primary focus, Dr. Mumford remains stoic and closed off;
worse, we are led to believe that the events of the movie have had no
effect on the man.
I was never bored watching Mumford; it was just quirky enough and just
amusing enough to hold my attention for 96 minutes. But I was never
engaged in the film's story nor did I care about its main character.
I've seen far worse dramedies than this one, but for the accomplished
Kasdan, it isn't particularly impressive. Oh, and by the way, if you met
a man who spends all his free time making robot sextoys, what would you
do?

   Sometimes you get the idea that the slogan of the
American Medical Association is, "If it ain't broke, we fix it
until it is."  Doctors, with all their education and degrees--nay,
because of their education and degrees--sometimes mess us
up really good.  Since so many of our ailments originate in
our heads, or at least partially so, maybe we'd be better off
being "treated" by a good friend or by any nice guy willing to
listen carefully and comment graciously on their take.  Ivan
Reitman acquitted himself just fine six years ago with a
similar concept, his "Dave," about an incapacitated president
who is replaced by a lookalike phony, an ordinary, likeable
fellow, who even hires a local accountant to take care of the
federal budget. The country prospers.
   "Mumford," like "Dave," is a godsend to those of us who
believe that we could well strip away a good deal of jargon-
filled fields and substitute good common sense for fancy
diagnoses and treatments.  Specifically relating to the
profession of psychoanalysis, the movie directed by Lawrence
Kasdan ("Body Heat") from his own script could have you
leaving the theater feeling so good that the eight bucks you
paid for admission could be a better value than the $200 you
might pay to a shrink for two sessions on the couch.  The
story's amiability can be credited largely to the down-home
performance of Loren Dean, in the role of a true Mr. Nice
Guy All-American (despite his commission of a criminal act),
who shrinks the heads of a number of people of his village.
resolving age-old problems and bringing happiness and good
cheer.  Of course none of this is believable.  Dean's
character, Dr. Mumford himself, concedes at one point that
psychologists can't do a heck of a lot for people whose
problems originated in their early childhoods.  Then again,
maybe a good friend and not a professional head-doctor
could do the job: and that's exactly what Mumford is--a
phony, a quack, and a stroke of luck to the village in which
he works.
   Crosscutting in a conventional manner, sometimes jaggedly
from one patient to another, "Mumford" establishes the tone
of an outwardly friendly town whose residents are anything
but dangerous but whose lodgers have difficulties they take
to the doctor's couch.  Sofie Crisp (Hope Davis) has been
diagnosed with Epstein-Barr syndrome and is so regularly
exhausted that she at first cannot even make the walk to the
psychologist's office.  Skip Skiperton (Jason Lee), as
congenial a fellow as you want to meet, has made three
billion dollars by cornering the market on the production of
modems but cannot have a relationship with a woman
because he is sure they are all after his money (and he's
right).  Althea Brockett (Mary McDonnell) is trapped in a
loveless marriage with a wealthy industrialist (Ten Danson)
who is a jerk and consoles herself with compulsive mail-order
whopping while Henry Follett, the fat and balding local
pharmacist, has perpetual fantasies that he is a sexy
character in a noir movie being vamped by cleavage-rich
femmes.  One by one, Mumford finds a solution within
months for each of these delightfully troubled people, but a
discovery made by two envious psychologists (Jane Adams
and David Paymer) with the help of the town's snotty lawyer
(Martin Short) creates a predicament for Mumford and a loss
for the entire town.
   Mumford" is an oddity.  Starting off with a blast of music
and a black-and-white scene from a detective story that sets
a tone of danger and tension, Kasdan settles into a
phlegmatic style.  The entire picture seems to lack energy--
whether a deliberate choice from the director who is taking
his audience from the usual Hollywood slam-bang comedy
ambience or has himself gotten a touch of the Epstein-Barr
bug.  I like to think the former is the case.  After a summer
barrage of obscene, edgy, heart-pounding, and would-be
hilarious fare, maybe this is just the ticket to provide a
transition to the fall--which promises to include more of the
usual melodrama and highly-paced, strenuously directed
moviegoing experiences.  Loren Dean's a real find, a
lookalike and soundalike for Charles Grodin, and Jason Lee
turns in an appealing aw-shucks performance of what Bill
Gates could very have been like a decade or so ago. 
"Mumford" was filmed in Sonoma and Napa County California
with all the spirit that has made California the archetypically
laid-back locale of the States.  Despite that area's wide-open
spaces, Kasdan has kept the scenes close and intimate, with
generally only two people in the frame at one time.  That's all
to the good--a restful, realistic remedy for the past summer's
wild ride.

     Films like PLEASANTVILLE have questioned time-honored American
small town values.  But traditionally American films have given us
idealized representations of American small town life.  Generally in
American films small towns are where good people live and work.  Films
like SHADOW OF A DOUBT have intentionally shown small town life as
really being the American ideal. Hitchcock intentionally played up the
theme in SHADOW OF A DOUBT to show wartime audiences that small town
life was what Americans were fighting for.  Films like DOC HOLLYWOOD
press the idea that if you get to know the American small town you are
bound to like it and the people in it.  MUMFORD is a similar film
extolling the virtues of the small town life.  DOC HOLLYWOOD was about
the outsider trying to leave the small town but falling in love with
the town instead.  MUMFORD is a variation in which the outsider already
loves the town and really wants to stay in the small town in spite of
forces to make him leave.
     MUMFORD opens with a sequence that looks like it was from some
luscious, steamy 1940s James M. Cain film adaptation.  Are we in the
right movie?  Yes.  We are in the fantasy life of the Mumford town
pharmacist.  The strong, handsome young man of the fantasy turns out to
be plump, balding and nearly blind in real life. He is on the couch
talking to bland, handsome psychologist Dr. Mumford (played by Lorn
Dean).  Doc Mumford is disarmingly pleasant and affable.
     Through most of the first third of the film we get to know the
unorthodox doctor and about six of his cases.  We watch how he goes
about treating them.  Among them are Althea Brockett (Mary McDonnell)
who lives in luxury but is becoming a compulsive buyer.  Young Skip
Skipperton (Jason Lee) skateboards through traffic and runs the most
successful modem company in the world.  Emotionally he is still a child
just looking for a buddy with whom to talk and play catch.  Then there
is Sofie Crisp (Hope Davis) an attractive divorcee who is living with
her parents and developing Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  Mumford's
treatment in each case seems to be in equal parts pleasant conversation
and intuitive pop psychology.  Sooner or later he seems to get each of
his patients up to a nice place in the hills he knows of that has an
impressive overlook of the town. Kasdan's approach to getting to the
story is as unhurried and even as pleasant as life in the American
small town of the title.
     Ernest Delbanco (David Paymer) and Phyllis Sheeler (Jane Adams), a
psychiatrist and a psychologist, do not mind that the newcomer is more
successful than they are, but have some reservations about his style.
But we too start to notice something a little off in the psychologist's
style.  In shooting the breeze with his patients Mumford may
indiscreetly talk about his other cases.  Often his comments to his
patients are a little more direct and frank than we might expect.  He
bones up on the Internet for some surprisingly basic psychological
information.  He also takes an immediate dislike to town lawyer Lionel
Dillard (Martin Short).  It may well be that Doc Mumford may have some
problems of his own, psychological and otherwise.
     In telling his story, Kasdan uses some unorthodox approaches.  The
primary story line is delayed well into the film and then only half-
heartedly visited now and again.  What drives the film is not the pace
of the plot.  Instead, one wants to see each of the cases Dr. Mumford
is treating and how a simple intuitive approach works to solve
problems.  Nor is the cast a particularly high-powered one.  Loren
Dean, who played the title role in BILLY BATHGATE and was an
investigator in GATTACA, is likeable and inoffensive, but he borders on
being insipid and never generates much dramatic tension.  Alfre Woodard
is under-used as a friend and neighbor of Doc Mumford.  Woodard
previously shared with Mary McDonnell the films BLUE CHIPS, PASSION
FISH, and GRAND CANYON.  Martin Short is slightly abrasive as the town
lawyer.  Jason Lee as town entrepreneur may be familiar as the clueless
Banky from CHASING AMY.
     This will not be one of Kasdan's more memorable scripts, but it is
certainly a pleasant way to spend an hour or two.  I rate it a 6 on the
0 to 10 scale and a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.

Paymer, Martin Short, Ted Danson, Pruitt Taylor Vince and Alfre Woodard
Written and Directed by Lawrence Kasdan

IN SHORT: A gentle, genial comedy for post teens.
Consider the story of Dr. Michael Mumford, Ph.D (Loren Dean). He's the
new shrink in a town also named Mumford whose two other shrinks (one a
real doctor, one a fake) have seen their formerly robust practices
shrivel. The town also has a self-absorbed, ego-maniacal attorney named
Lionel Dillard (Martin Short), one of the few people willing and able to
pay the new doc cold hard cash for an hour of mental deconstruction,
whose patronage is refused ('cuz Doc Mumford can't stand jerks -- a more
colorful epithet is used, several times by different characters in
Mumford but I've got standards to uphold and parents that would complain
if I used the "a" word. So I won't). Lessee, one spurned lawyer. Two
headcases with shrinking practices. Add 'em all up and . . . can we
spell "revenge"?
Oh, let's not and say we did. The characters, and the problems, that
writer director Lawrence Kasdan has created are entirely ordinary and
normal. Given that this story revolves around a psychologist, that means
a lot of talk. A lot of ordinary and normal talk would be hailed as
"realistic" on the arthouse circuit, but would strike most folk as
tedious -- unless the writer knew exactly what he was doing, which
Kasdan does (as he has demonstrated both solo and with partners in The
Big Chill and The Accidental Tourist and a couple of action flicks
called Raiders of the Lost Ark and Star Wars episodes Five and Six).
It's a great talent to find interesting things among average people and
while there is a twist or two towards the unusual, the problems of the
people found here are normal.
Formerly a logging town, Mumford is now dependent on Panda Modems, run
by the richest man in town, Skip Skipperton (Jason Lee). Being the sole
provider for a town of several thousand yields an problem for Skip. He
can't be seen with a shrink, 'cuz that appearance problem would cause
trouble for the company and the town. So he hires Mumford to be his
"friend," to discuss intimacy problems -- Skip needs a companion more
interesting than the body parts he's working on down in the lab. You'll
discover the secret of that in the flick.
As for the other customers, there's a fat pharmacist (Pruitt Taylor
Vince) who lost his wife and family due to fantasies straight out of a
Raymond Chandler novel; a wife (Mary McDonnell) who catalog shops
incessantly as a way of compensating for the lack of husbandly attention
(Ted Danson is the louse); the divorcee with chronic fatigue syndrome
(Hope Davis) who makes the doctor's heart go all thumpa thumpa and whose
nasty old witch of a mom (Dana Ivey) hates the doc from the word go.
All of the dirt about the good doctor's patients can be had straight
from the horse's mouth, if you ask him the right question at the right
time. Which is what local cafe owner Lily (Alfre Woodard, in a role that
marks her as the sanest person in town) manages to do right at the top
of the flick. What's that you say? A doctor is supposed to keep those
clinical confessions to himself? Absolutely correct a mundo.
But, as we know from the television commercial, Dr. Mumford ain't no
doc. Not even a little. Only Robert Stack can help sort out the unsolved
mystery of who Michael Mumford really is, and getting there is a very
pleasant ride where the law is savagely broken and a town is fully
healed.
Sorry about that. Kasdan writes well. I get inspired. Shame on me.
Mumford is a cut above your average grown up dateflick. It may be a tad
too nice for those Crankier than I -- Martin Short's character is as
close to an "edge" as the script gets, and that's not much. Mumford
offers a fine time in the dark and is recommended
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Mumford, he would have paid...
This one's definitely for us grownups (cuz Cranky at 15 would've been
bored silly by all the talk. We didn't appreciate things like character
back in them halcyon days of pimplehood)

There are many different types of Hollywood productions. Some are loud and
noisy, filling the screen with images of violence and heroes saving big
breasted women. Others show comedies that have to do mainly with all of the
character's (possibly) budding sexuality and how it's related with the real
world. These are simply the type of movies that studios like to make. So when a
modest film like Mumford comes around, it should be a great oppurtunity to
spread the word about a quiet, no flashly effects, funny, Hollywood film.
A psychiatrist named Mumford (Dean) moves to a town called Mumford where he is
instantly greeted with plenty of patients with lots of interesting problems. He
enjoys listening to people and hearing what they have to say. Now it just so
happens (like in most movies) that the people in this small town are very
eccentric and very strange. Mumford is called on various outings to try and
help people all of the little city. But the two resident doctors of the town
begin not to take a liking of him and think it's interesting that everyone who
could confirm his graduation from school have tragically died.
Then he meets Sofie (Davis, playing somewhat of an extension of her character
in Next Stop, Wonderland) in one second, he instantly falls in love. Now
falling in love with a patient is a bad thing, especially if her mother is a
bitchy Jane Adams, but there is another twist. It turns out Mumford isn't even
a psychiatrist at all. He just thought it would be a good way to get away from
his former life. I won't give you the full story, but basically he used to be
on drugs and was sent to a rehab center run by monks. When they think that he
has magically disappeared they run a segment looking for him on Unsolved
Mysteries. So what should he do? Face what he has done? Or go into hiding once
again?
And so Hollywood once again regains my trust that they can produce a quality
feature film. Mumford is very modest, very quiet, and nothing really seems to
happen but I still found myself enjoying it immensely. The ensemble cast (Ted
Danson, Jane Adams, Jason Lee, Alfre Woodard, and others) are great. Especially
Ted Danson whose six minute scene has him as a cigar smoking jerk whose
concerned about his wife. Dean has an interesting smile, which could possibly
become a trademark if he becomes a big star. Of course I have to congratulate
Hope Davis, has she ever been bad in a movie? While not outstandingly great,
Mumford is fun, and it gets *** stars.

language make up the film's bad content. Good Age 13 & Up

Mumford, Starring Loren Dean, Hope Davis, Jason Lee, Martin Short, Alfre
Woodard, Mary McDonnell, David Paymer, Jane Adams, Pruitt Taylor Vince.
Directed by Lawrence Kasdan     
 The advertisements and promos for Mumford tell you that it is the story
of a psychologist, who isn't really a psychologist.  Going into the film
with this knowledge gives you an entirely different prospectus about the
goings-on because Mumford's deception isn't revealed until well into the
storyline.  Mumford is both the names of the psychologist, and of the town
where he practices his craft.
The real story, or rather stories surround the supporting players.  Each
has a story to tell, and most of them tell it to Mumford, much to the
chagrin of the other `head doctors' in town, as well as to the daffy
attorney played by Martin Short.  Mumford has that wonderful ability of
being able to listen to what others are saying when the other people in
their lives are ignoring their needs.  As a viewer, you quickly realize
what causes many of their insecurities, just as he does.  Ted Danson does
a walk-on cameo as the husband of a woman who is a compulsive shopper. 
Her children (his stepchildren) also have their problems.  The son, for
example, carries a 22-gauge shotgun with him wherever he goes.
Alfre Woodard, who is Mumford's landlady, Lily, and runs a local café,
seems to be about the only sane person in town although she really doesn't
want a man in her life.  She prefers long showers!
The opening scenes are wonderful.  They are in black and white and
reminiscent of the films of the 40's.  At first I thought that they were
showing the wrong movie, but it surprisingly turned into the perfect intro
for the tale.
There is a little nudity and bad language used but they are done
extremely well, and greatly add to the plot.  Especially funny is a scene
in the Panda Modem Lab, owned by the town's Billionaire (Jason Lee) who
has created a new `toy'.
It is a delightful light comedy, one that I wouldn't mind seeing again,
probably when it comes to TV.  I give it a solid B.

You've got to hand it to Lawrence Kasdan .  When he finds a niche he
likes, he stays with it.  Once again, the writer/director of THE BIG CHILL
has taken a large talented cast and multiple story lines, woven them
together and formed a mostly comedic, but sometimes touching movie.
MUMFORD takes its name from the small town that serves as its setting.
Also from the last name of the central character, "Doc" Mumford.  Though
he has only arrived in Mumford four months, two and one-half weeks ago, he
already has more patients than the town's other two headshrinkers.
Doc Mumford is a young psychologist with an unusual methodology... He
makes it up as he goes along.   He has to, seeing as he has never taken a
course in psychology.  But that doesn't stop him from "treating" the
residents of Mumford, who respond by revealing their "secret lives" to him
without knowing that he has one of his own.
Never having taken the Hippocratic oath, Mumford's amateur status is
manifested in other ways:  He has a tendency to talk about his patients
and their problems to other townspeople, he refuses treatment when it
suits his purposes, and he falls in love with one of his patients.
If having three psychologists (actually, one's a psychiatrist) in a small
town seems excessive, it is only because you haven't met the good people
of Mumford.  They are an eclectic group in need.
Doc Mumford's patients include:  Althea Brockett (Mary McDonnell,
INDEPENDENCE DAY), a compulsive shopper who takes that condition to a new
high; Henry Follett (Pruitt Taylor Vince, COLD AROUND THE HEART), whose
1940's style sexual fantasies somehow don't include a role for him; Skip
Skiperton (Jason Lee, DOGMA), a goof-ball, skateboarding,
multi-billionaire who has learned that it is lonely at the top; Nessa
Watkins (Zooey Deschanel in her film debut) a teenager unhappy with her
looks and life but way too cool to admit it; and Sofie Crisp (Hope Davis,
ARLINGTON ROAD), suffering from the symptoms of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
and in whom Doc Mumford takes a special interest.
While the movie's structure prevents them from becoming a truly ensemble
cast, each of the actors do fine, credible work in their respective
scenes.  Loren Dean (ENEMY OF THE STATE) appropriately underplays the role
of Doc Mumford, allowing our focus to remain on the various supporting
characters and the effect the "doctor" has upon them.  Alfre Woodard (DOWN
IN THE DELTA) has some good moments as Lily, Doc's friend and sounding
board and perhaps the only resident of Mumford not in need of his help.
While MUMFORD is, at its core, a sweet, charitable film, for some
miscalculated reason Mr. Kasdan included enough sexual images and nudity
to bump the MPAA rating to a well deserved R.  This inclusion distracts
from and weakens the film instead of adding to it.  MUMFORD is a "PG"
movie dressed in "R" clothing that satisfies neither audience.
  The miraculous treatment that the "doctor" has stumbled upon is nothing
new.  It is called "listening and caring."  The people who came to Doc
Mumford needed someone with whom to share their innermost thoughts and
Doc, via his non-clinical, nonprofessional responses, communicated to them
that he genuinely cared for them.  Thus they began their first steps on
the road to healing.
God has called us to do the same for each other:
"Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as
also ye do."  1 Thessalonians 5:11 [KJV]
There is no godly reason for anyone to ever feel alone in this world.  If
nothing else, we can pour our hearts out to God Who always hears us.  And
as we include God in our lives, we are welcomed into and become part of a
larger community comprised of a family of believers and a household of
faith.

Another pretentious film from the director Lawrence Kasdan (The Big
Chill/ Silverado/ Grand Canyon/Wyatt Earp). I never saw a film of his
that wasn't arty-farty. This time he created a comedy/fantasy film about
a quack psychologist in a small town who subversively discusses his
patient's problems with others.
The film suffers from an interminable case of blandness and exhibits an
unwillingness to go beyond its cute little tale to see the dangers of
someone who invades another's personal privacy by pretending to be
someone he isn't, especially in a critical field such as the mental
health one. Instead the film focuses on what a wonderful person Dr.
Mumford (Loren Dean) is and how by using common sense there is no need
to go to school and train for his profession, as long as he can listen.
In other words, the film makes the assumption that anyone with
sensitivity could be a psychologist. This film was so weak and
misleading in purpose, its story so dry and unconvincing, that it was a
chore to just watch it and not give up on its arrogant attitude. It
seemed to get stuck on itself and had no movement for the longest period
of time.
The film also makes no attempt to show anything about Mumford's
character or his inner being, except by telling the mere biographical
data a TV news report might tell about someone arrested as an impostor.
Mumford remains as bland and unknown by the film's conclusion as he was
throughout the film. This guy must have some serious mental problems to
do what he did, yet there is no treatment offered for him, as he's the
one in the film who needed it the most and his only penalty is a
slap-on-the-wrist jail sentence in a country club prison and a heroes
acceptance by the town. This is stupidity glorified beyond a point of
belief. There was nothing this film had to say that made any sense, and
to top it off, there was no comedy in its attempt to be a screwball
comedy. Frank Capra used to make social films like this in the '30s and
'40s, but those goody-goody themes have long been played out. If they
weren't, they would still be making films like that.
Mumford took the name of the town of Mumford, forged his credentials,
and became the new psychologist in this once depressed mill town, which
has now recovered thanks to the efforts of a young computer geek named
Skip, (Jason Lee), who is worth three billion dollars from his Panda
Modem Company, whose company produces 23 percent of the world's modems,
where he employs a large percentage of the town. Mumford, after being a
crooked investigator for the IRS, a drug user, and having an affair with
his wife's partner, goes on the run after the IRS blames him for framing
an innocent businessman, who got so depressed that he took his life. He
ends up living with monks in a remote part of Arizona before coming to
Mumford. He rapidly becomes a very popular therapist even to his
surprise, and catches the jealousy of the town's two other therapists,
Dr. Ernest Delbanco (Paymer) and Dr. Phyllis Sheeler (Jane Adams).
He discovers he can treat those who are lonely and those who have sexual
problems: Skip is lonely, but does not want to be with women he knows
only want him for his money; a schoolgirl (Zooey Deschanel) who is
self-hating and asocial, is sent for pro bono therapy by her school
system to be rehabilitated by him; a pharmacist (Pruitt Taylor Vince)
who is afraid of his sex drive, is told that porno is OK; and, a young
lady he falls in love with, who suffers from a chronic fatigue syndrome,
Sofie Crisp (Hope Davis), is encouraged to get out of the house and
fight her depression. I found the last vignette particularly phony and
disconcerting, since the film has the arrogance to say that her illness
is merely psychological, which goes against most evidence of the disease
and discredits those who suffer from this very real illness, as they
know that its physical nature is very serious, and their treatment
requires a competent medical doctor seeing them, not a quack.
Of course, the phony psychologist cures her and the last act of the
film, after he helps everyone he comes into contact with, is to confess
about his deception. He is told to come clean with his past by his
landlady neighbor, the only black woman seen in town, who owns a popular
diner, Lily (Alfre Woodard). She is someone who has stopped believing
that there is a man around for her, but who is someone with enough sense
and strength not to need a shrink. She is the one Skip falls in love
with and through Mumford's help they get together.
But before he can tell anyone that he's a fraud, Robert Stack on the TV
program Unsolved Mysteries tells his troubled story and asks the public
to turn the missing person in.
There was nothing fantastic about this fantasy film, not even the
fantasy. It was a film that tried to make you feel good about your
problems and tried to show how they would go away if you can just get
someone to listen to you: anyone. It was meant to be a likable film like
elevator music is meant to be not upsetting, as a sort of universal
music of acceptance. In both cases the effort wasn't worth it, by trying
to be so bland it had more of a negative effect than if it was trying to
say something worthwhile. This was a film made up of phony characters,
whose problems were surface deep and were covered in the most
superficial of ways. It was hard for me not to see this film as an
excuse to justify doing something that is criminal and then explaining
that it is OK, look at all those who were helped. If we followed the
film's logic, then it would be OK for someone to pretend to be a
surgeon, as long as he operated successfully.

Dr. Mumford (Loren Dean) is a psychologist with a difference in MUMFORD,
the latest cinematic treasure from writer/director Lawrence Kasdan (THE
BIG CHILL and GRAND CANYON).
As an inviting enigma, Dean gives a deceptively seductive performance.
He almost hypnotizes the audience with his smooth, blank slate of a
face.  Dr. Mumford, a world-class listener, possesses such subdued charm
that people are compelled to tell him their most hidden secrets,
something it's obvious the doc must have a few of himself.
In town for less than 5 months, he's already got more patients than the
other two local shrinks combined.  Ridiculed by one of the town's
sophisticates as "Mayberry, RFD," the place where the doctor has moved
has (coincidentally?) been called Mumford since 1813.
Dr. Mumford listens stoically to some patients but cuts others' time
short if he thinks they're wasting his time.  In a story that isn't in
any hurry to get anywhere, the movie charms with its cornucopia of
well-written and superlatively acted characters.  One of the film's
delights is that you haven't any idea where it is headed.  Its one
mystery is fairly obvious.  Full of wry humor that produces a host of
small laughs and constant grins, the script is perhaps its biggest star.
("The only problem I had with degenerate, self-destructive behavior is
that I couldn't get enough of it.")
>From bars to hardware stores, people pull Dr. Mumford over to seek out
his advice and to bare their souls.  The movie has an almost magical
aspect to it that you can't quite put your finger on.  Lit by
cinematographer Ericson Core to look like a Norman Rockwell painting,
the town of Mumford manages to look appealing even though it conceals a
hotbed of neuroses.
One of his patients is a waif, who has an unhealthy addiction to glamour
magazines.  Lying on his coach, cuddling Bazaar and Elle in her arms,
she confesses, "I want to live in the world that these people are in."
Sofie Crisp (Hope Davis), his prize patient, suffers from Chronic
Fatigue Syndrome.  Davis gives a convincing performance as someone so
tired that she can barely move.  With pale, translucent skin, she
appears so fragile that her bones might be in danger of disintegration.
"You may lie down," the doctor advises her on her first visit to his
office.  "Most people do."  "I'd better not," she replies as if
exhausted by speaking.  "I'd fall right asleep.  Besides, it's probably
too early for me to start sleeping with you."
As obsessive shopper Althea Brockett, Mary McDonnell (DANCES WITH
WOLVES) plays a woman who never met a catalog she didn't love.
Especially fond of two-named stores (Williams-Sonoma, Neiman Marcus,
....), she has closets overflowing with the loot that she's bought but
hasn't unboxed.  Her husband (Ted Danson) is an investment banker who
enjoys the high life.  "No one ever said on his death bed, 'I treated
myself too well,'" he explains to Dr. Mumford, as he blows the smoke
from his large, hotdog-sized cigar into a brandy stifter big enough for
a small aquarium.
The town's Rock of Gibraltar, Lily (Alfre Woodard), owns the local
coffee shop and rents a room to Dr. Mumford.  She spends her evenings
watching television shows like "20/20."  ("It's shocking!" she tells the
doctor about the latest investigative report on 20/20.  "The government
is wasteful.  You heard it here first.")
In a likable and wonderfully naive turn, Jason Lee (CHASING AMY) is Skip
Skiperton, the town's young success story, as the founder of Panda
Modems.  Skip's a lonely guy with a serious case of insecurity for a
multibillionaire.  He complains that his company makes "23% of the
world's modems, but I can't connect with women."  He pays the doc to
play ball with him, while he discusses his many anxieties.
In a movie filled with gems, it's hard to pick out a favorite.  The most
unusual, however, is the telling of his dreams by the pharmacist (Pruitt
Taylor Vince).  He dreams in black and white and his characters are
lifted straight out of old dime store paperbacks - the types populated
with women with large bosoms and grease-monkey men.  Just the sort that
a kid might sneak off to a shed to read, lest he be caught by his
parents and the sort that might forever be trapped in an adult's
subconscious.
MUMFORD runs a fast 1:36.  It is rated R for sex-related images,
language and drug content.  It is a good-spirited film that would be
fine for teenagers.

"Mumford", a hit and miss ensemble comedy from Lawrence Kasdan ("The
Big Chill"), is more weird than quirky, and more quirky than
funny. Which, as you can tell, isn't saying very much.  Newcomer Loren
Dean plays Dr. Mumford, a man who in four months has become the most
popular psychologist in a town called...Mumford. His unorthodox
approach gains him a new friend, lonely skateboarding billionaire Skip
Skipperton (Jason Lee). Mumford tells Skip a secret which he has
successfully hidden in his four months in town. He isn't, nor has he
ever been, a psychologist. In a scarily odd flashback sequence,
Mumford confesses about his former life as an I.R.S. investigator.  A
life filled with drugs, adultery and paranoia. But the Doc seems to be
helping people get back on their feet; most notably Sofie (Hope
Davis), a woman suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome and quickly
becoming the object of Mumford's affection. The cross-section of his
individual patients include Mary McDonnell, Zooey Deschanel, Ted
Danson, David Paymer, and a very un-"Heavy" Pruitt Taylor Vince. But a
district attorney (Martin Short) can't help digging up dirt on
Mumford, and soon he finds himself caught in quite a dilemma. As a
film, I wish "Mumford" could have stuck exclusively to the scenes with
Jason Lee. In all his films, he shows his own brand of cynicism laden
humor which never tires. Hope Davis is also good in her role, but the
romance between her and the Doc is not very believable. "Mumford"
often drags and feels much longer than its short running time, but at
times it is effective, if not at all funny. If Loren Dean, as the
lead, was a better actor with more charisma, "Mumford" could have
worked. He has a bland appearance and no real guile. If you're looking
for a light, almost enjoyable but downright weird "comedy", then
"Mumford" is for you. If not, stay far, far away.

Mumford
Directed by:  Lawrence Kasdan
Starring: James Adams, Ted Danson, Hope Davis, Loren Dean,
Jason Lee, Mary McDonnell, David Paymer, Martin Short, 
Robert Stack, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Alfre Woodard
Running time:  111 minutes
My rating (5 star scale):  ***1/2
Mumford (Dean) is a psychologist who has recently opened a
practice in the town of Mumford.  He is highly successful
and it seems every citizen of prominence in the town comes
to him.  Among his patients are the local pharmacist with
a rich fantasy life in which he never appears, a high 
school girl suffering from anorexia, a housewife who can't 
stop buying things, a young divorced woman with chronic
fatigue syndrome, and a billionaire who just isn't happy.
Everything seems ideal on the surface.  But there are problems.
Mumford isn't quite what he seems to be.  A rejected patient,
Short playing the sneaky annoying guy he always plays, tries
to create problems for Mumford.  The local billionaire has
some unusual requests.  And Mumford finds himself falling in
love with one of his patients.
I watched this film with a friend who took umbrage at the 
underlying message, that serious illnesses like anorexia
and chronic fatigue syndrome can be cured by having a friend
or getting a date.  Of course, this film isn't a serious 
attempt at espousing a treatment and Mumford's methods are
not to be taken seriously.  But I suspect some people will 
be upset at this depiction.  
This is a funny movie.  It's also pretty obvious.  You are 
never surprised at any of the revelations or at the final
turn of events.  But it does make you laugh.  And what more
can you want from a comedy?
