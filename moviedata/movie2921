     Most of us have grown up without the help of a "nanny."  In fact,
few of us have ever spoken with one.  Who, then, would expect a
documentary about a couple of nannies would not only be of interest to
the average moviegoer but would actually turn into a 4-byter?
     Jyll Johnstone, the producer-Director, wanted to make a film about
Martha, the nanny who played such an important part in her life and
family for forty years.  Coincidentally, co-producer Barbara Ettinger
was visited by Johnstone, a childhood friend.  Jyll was fascinated by
the number of pictures on the walls of Ethel, Barbara's old nanny.
After a short time for thinking about it, Jyll and Barbara decided to
make the documentary.
     With World War II behind them, many talented and educated women
looked for something to replace their responsibilities to their
children with women who would care for them.  The film tells of the
love and the closeness of the two nannies with their charges and how
they influenced the Johnstone's five children and the six Ettingers.
     The film goes as far back as the 1930s when Catholic Martha was
nanny to a wealthy Jewish family in Baden-Baden, Germany.  Life became
difficult for her when Hitler came to power; her having worked for a
Jewish family was a black mark and so she moved to the U.S where in
1941 she was hired.
     Ethel, the daughter of a black South Carolina share cropper
family  eventually moved north and took on the job of raising the
little Ettinger children.  The difference in the two nannies is obvious
but that they both loved the children is equally apparent.
     The filmmakers, their children, and especially the nannies, are
interviewed all through the film and reveal their love and
attachments.   Although this review is written in mid February 1995,
mark MARTHA & ETHEL down as nominees for a Documentary Oscar come
February 1996.
