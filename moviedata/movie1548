I recommend Disney's Tarzan for a number of reasons.
First, my family liked it a lot.  My wife and kids and I all sat fascinated 
by the animation.  The computer-assists grow sharper by the movie:  here we 
have a startlingly three-dimensional jungle, limbs and vines passing the 
camera with fresh realism.  Many of the characters - Wayne Knight's Tantor, 
for instance - are drawn as charming throwbacks to traditional animation;  
the elephants are reminiscent of the military marchers in The Jungle Book.  
What's most exciting is the way the camera follows Tarzan's agile ranging 
among the trees.  He zips and zooms, cuts and caroms, surfs and slides.  
American amusement parks are always trying to build a better roller coaster, 
and Disney has built the ultimate (as of the last year of the century) ape 
man.  Tarzan is always likable and, even though his hi-jinks defy physics, 
he always keeps the eye occupied.
Edgar Rice Burroughs' story moves smoothly at the start.  We watch a 
husband, wife and baby abandoning a burning ship.  They land on some part of 
the African coast, where they build an extensive tree dwelling and, 
presumably, the parents die by the claws and teeth of a large cat.  
Discovered by a compassionate and large-eyed gorilla (Kala, voiced by Glenn 
Close), the English baby becomes part of the extended clan.  Although the 
silver-backed leader Kerchak (Lance Henrickson) is against keeping the 
child, as he is not of their kind, the boy grows and becomes friends with 
most of the surrounding animals, especially his two pals, this film's 
versions of sidekicks.  They are Tantor, done with a slightly silly, 
adenoidal voice by Wayne Knight, and Terk, a young female gorilla with a Don 
King 'do and a Brooklyn attitude (supplied ably by Rosie O'Donnell).  Both 
of these voices are delightfully distinguishable, by the way, as is the 
threatening rasp of Henrickson as Kerchak.
Something else we loved was the human side to Tarzan.  We are attracted to 
his character mostly, I think, because he is an outcast,  fully accepted 
neither in the world of the jungle, nor in the less civilized society of 
humankind.  Tarzan frequently feels excluded from his clan, and is thrilled 
to find Jane (Minnie Driver), the English woman who has accompanied her 
father, Professor Porter (Nigel Hawthorne), and the hunter Clayton (Brian 
Blessed).  Of course the main conflict is supplied by the white man's 
encroachment upon the natural habitat of the apes.  What's rather 
predictable here is that Professor Porter himself has come merely to observe 
gorillas, whereas Clayton - and his boatload of mercenary thugs - are armed 
with rifles and the cages that will transport as many apes as possible back 
to the zoos and laboratories of Western civilization.
Small moments make most of the difference.  Directors Chris Buck and Kevin 
Lima cause Tarzan's basic conflicts to evoke our sympathy again and again.  
There's one scene in which the jungle hero has heard the reports of rifles 
and gone to investigate.  We watch as he picks up a shell casing, sniffs and 
then tastes it.  It's foreign and unsavory, of course, and a fine example of 
the main fight going on in the narrative.  Another moving scene occurs when 
Tarzan places his palm against Jane's - and sees that hers is a 
comparably-sized, human hand.  These brief moments sketch character without 
using speech, a feat difficult to do even when using live actors.
As the voice of Tarzan, Tony Goldwyn performs well.  He's heroic without 
showing off - his job the equivalent of a good writer telling a story with a 
transparent prose style.  Minnie Driver is very expressive, especially in 
the frantically-paced scenes in which Tarzan rescues her from vicious 
baboons.  Finally, the voice of Phil Collins is quite pleasing in the 
background.  It's a pleasure that none of the animals themselves breaks into 
song:  the story relies on the musicianship of a proven soft-rock star.  
Another aspect of language handled cleverly is the English spoken by Tarzan 
while he is with the gorillas, versus the English he learns from Jane and 
her father.  It's more believeable than the scenes in which Pocahantas 
suddenly speaks fluent English to John Smith;  it also makes good use of 
linguistic jokes, as when Tarzan connects the name "Clayton" with the 
gunshots intruding upon the quiet jungle.
Only The Lion King used a story original to Disney writers.  I find it 
ironic, therefore, that their Renaissance continues with reliable stories 
like Tarzan.  I hope they keep doing it, though, because there are not 
enough good G-rated movies around, and because it makes good sense, after 
all, to go with a good thing.

1999 - 88 minutes
Rated G (if this were live-action, it would be at least PG for violence).
Reviewed June 18, 1999.
These past two years have not been kind to Disney's animated features, 
particularly their last two summer films--the mediocre "Hercules" and the 
arrantly forgettable "Mulan." With the same old story formula and 
increasingly dull music, not to mention unextraordinary animation, I was 
beginning to wonder if Disney had finally run out of steam. At least one 
thing was certain: they weren't making top-quality films like "The Little 
Mermaid" and "Beauty and the Beast" anymore. With that said, the writer of 
this review is going to have to eat his own words as the newest Disney 
feature, "Tarzan," is a rip-roaring, thoroughly entertaining, and emotional 
motion picture, one of Disney's better recent excursions. Fascinatingly, it 
is said that the books of Edgar Rice Burroughs, based on the human "ape-man," 
Tarzan, is one of the most consistently remade stories in history, second to 
only Bram Stoker's "Dracula." Since I was more or less unfamiliar with 
Tarzan, aside from the basic details, this new Disney-fied version of 
"Tarzan" came off as more original than it probably should have, and it was 
rather easy to get caught up in the joyful goings-on.
The stunning opening, played to the lyrical tune, "Two Worlds," by Phil 
Collins (who composed five songs specifically for the film), introduces us to 
a young couple in perilous danger, as they escape with their baby from a 
burning ship. Stranded in the jungles of Africa, the kindly ape, Kala (voiced 
by Glenn Close), grieving over the tragic death of her own child, finds the 
human baby in a cottage atop the trees, which also leaves traces of his own 
parents, who were killed by a leopard. Convincing her companion and leader, 
Kerchak (Lance Henriksen), to take the baby, whom she names Tarzan, into 
their ape community, Tarzan finally grows up into a buff young man who has 
learned ape-"speak" and is able to swing gracefully from vine to vine. He 
realizes that he looks different than his surrogate "mother," Kala, but has 
been able to get past this fact and has made two good friends, the 
loudmouthed ape, Terk (Rosie O'Donnell, who else?), and the elephant, Tantor 
(Wayne Knight). As luck would have it, one day Tarzan narrowly saves the 
good-natured, young British woman, Jane (Minnie Driver), who is on a gorilla 
expedition with her professor father (Nigel Hawthorne) and the smarmy, 
rifle-toting Clayton (Brian Blessed), from a pack of wild monkeys. 
Discovering for the first time that there are beings just like him, Tarzan 
grows a fondness for Jane, who teaches him English in exhange for Apish, and 
finds himself suddenly torn between two completely different worlds--the one 
he grew up in, and the one he is supposed to belong in.
Using a brand-new technique known as "deep canvas," which 
three-dimensionalizes the backgrounds, the animators of "Tarzan" have really 
outdone themselves this time. The film is constantly an enjoyable piece of 
eye candy, with the scenes of Tarzan swinging through the trees almost as 
exhilarating as riding a rollercoaster. In particular, the sequence in which 
Tarzan saves Jane from the monkeys is a definite runner-up for the most 
exciting action set-piece in any movie this year.
While the other recent animated pictures have had approximately the same 
exact running time as "Tarzan," they all have come off as oddly empty and 
seemingly much too short. This unfortunate fact most likely was due to the 
repetitive nature in which they were made, as the characters would break into 
a ho-hum song every ten minutes, thus taking away from actual character 
development. Wisely and refreshingly choosing to not be a musical this time 
around, with the Phil Collins songs simply playing in the background, 
"Tarzan" feels neither hollow nor too-brief, and Tarzan's plight was far more 
easy to get into. Continually, the relationship he forms with Jane is one of 
the sweeter romances seen in any animated film in, dare I say it, history. 
Their connection, and gradual love for one another, does not come off as a 
contrivance (as so many of them do in Disney movies), and it, like the the 
film as a whole, felt more adult-oriented, although children 5 or 6 and up 
will also fall in love with it.
Too often voice-over work isn't as effective as it should be, but once again, 
the Disney folks have hit jackpot, particularly in the form of Minnie Driver, 
who gives one of the most winning performances I've seen in 1999, animated or 
not. Driver brings a surprising sassiness and life to Jane, and gets the most 
unforced laughs in the film. Tony Goldwyn is also perfect as Tarzan, with the 
pitch-perfect deep voice and expressions (although I couldn't help but be 
reminded of Brendan Fraser throughout, no doubt due to the 1997 live-action 
"George of the Jungle"). Glenn Close is touching in the voice of Kala, and 
her sad character, coming-to-terms with her own child's death, even has a 
scene that almost stole some liquid from my tear ducts. Lance Henriksen, as 
the gruff Kerchak, who makes it clear to Kala that, "Tarzan will never be my 
son," also gives fine voice work. Even Rosie O'Donnell, who began to 
seriously grate on my nerves after her first few scenes, grew on me, and even 
had one opportunity to flex her dramatic muscles(!)
With "Tarzan," Disney has hinted at a possible, much-needed redemption for 
the studio. If their animated tentpole for next summer is also a winner, then 
their talent will be confirmed. Though nowhere near as masterful as 
Dreamworks' "The Prince of Egypt," "Tarzan" remains everything a quality 
animated feature should be: intelligent, accessible to both kids and adults, 
and most important, genuinely fun. If only Disney could improve their 
incessantly awful live-action attempts; well, we can always hope, can't we?

   If Disney's latest animated feature were regarded from
Jane's point of view, it would be subtitled, "The Swinger Who
Shagged Me."  Further, if the lead character--the only human
being not yet a member of America Online--were to sign up,
his screen name would be Tarzan48@aol.com. Proving that
sequels need not always be downhill runs, this "Tarzan" will
attract its audience of millions for its qualitative differences
from all previous ape-man stories, as this one utilizes no
human beings, no gorillas, and no people dressed in simian
raiment.  Every moment of its run combines computer-
generated imagery with traditional drawings, seamlessly
bound to defy the audience to distinguish between them.
   Johnny Weissmuller notwithstanding, there's quite a bit that
animation can do that live performers and settings cannot. 
Through the almost infinite variety of color combinations
available to designers, the African jungle can be made far
more beautiful than a traveller on safari will ever remember it
to be.  Waters will be stunningly aquamarine, trees will be
appear in lush, verdant splendor.  Animals can be fashioned
either anthropomorphically (like Kala, the gorilla) or conceived
according to their genuine nature (like Sabor, the leopard). 
Music, generally used as soundtrack in films employing live
actors, easily moves to the forefront in cartoons.  And since
celebrities are used as voiceovers, a cartoon will attract
people who are fans of the stars.  Kevin Lim and Chris Buck,
who direct this visually exhilarating entry into the Disney
lineage, exploit these resources thoroughly.
   If the story of Tarzan takes place during Victorian times in
England, this is only because its creator, Edgar Rice
Burroughs, was a product of those times.   This version of
the Burroughs story requires no previous knowledge of the
classic tale.  It takes us through the entire story of the title
character's birth through his courtship of Jane, a professor's
daughter who accompanies her dad on a study of African
gorillas.  The one segment of the story which could scare the
kiddies occurs during the opening minutes which, by the way,
are the most impressive part of the entire 88-minute film. 
The camera cuts from a gorilla family headed by the alpha
male, Kerchak (Lance Henriksen) and his sentimental
woman, Kala (Glenn Close) to the human family of Tarzan
(Tony Goldwyn) and his shipwrecked parents.  Kala's young
son is chased and eaten by a leopard, a fate which similarly
befalls Tarzan's folks, leaving the former childless and the
latter an orphan.  The baby Tarzan is found by Kala, adopted
by her despite her mate's hostility to this "hairless wonder,"
and comes of age with fellow gorillas and elephants as his
only mates and mentors.  When a study party led by
Professor Porter (Nigel Hawthorne), his dressed-to-the-nines
daughter Jane (Minnie Driver), and their gun-toting protector
Clayton (Brian Blessed) settle into camp, Tarzan meets Jane,
whisks her to safety in a stunning ride across cliffs from limb
to bough. They like each other.  Tarzan teaches Jane Gorilla
and is tutored in English in return.  The tension mounts when
Clayton, more interested in capturing gorillas for the money
he can get for them in England, executes plans to betray his
employers.
   The animators of this striking film bring to mind the
designers of similar cartoon enterprises such as "Prince of
Egypt" and "Pocohantas," and when compared to epic films
like "The Phantom Menace" may seem positively retro. 
Despite the throwback to the more conventional school of
animation, this movie soars by its melding of computer
graphics with the paint-and-paper design and through new
processes such as Deep Canvas, a technique which puts a
third dimension into the title character's oscillations.  Scripters
Tab Murphy, Bob Tzudiker and Noni White may not have
thrown in the obligatory witticisms for the adults
accompanying the small fry, but the story profits from the
crackling good spirits of Minnie Driver and Rosie O'Donnell
as Jane and Terk (who is Tarzan's simian best friend)
respectively.    
   As Tarzan and Jane fall more deeply in love, you'll wonder
how their association will turn out.  Will she succeed in
conning the ape man to civilization, where he'd be studied by
stuffy anthropologists as was Kaspar Hauser?  Or will the
muscular swinger get her to shed her crinolines and
strangling neckwear to enjoy the freedom of the jungle?  Will
Jane wonder how she is going to survive without the toilet
paper to which she is accustomed?  Will Tarzan ponder the
disadvantages of chucking his free bananas for expensive
salons serving tea and scones?  Author Burroughs had his
own idea for the resolution of the plot, one which is at odds
with the cartoon's.  In any case, the plot's not the thing in this
film of startling animated beauty which, like "Prince of Egypt,"
gives a fresh look to one of the world's popular myths.

If there were anything in terms of the movie world as certain as death
and taxes are in terms of life in general, it's the iron-clad formula for
Disney animated features.  Tune-heavy musicals ready to be adapted for
the Broadway stage, with comic relief broad enough to appeal to wee ones
and grown-ups alike and happy endings calibrated for maximum
crowdpleasing, The Formula has been sturdy and reliable enough to be
worked year after year, like clockwork, to satisfying effect. 
Though last year's _Mulan_ put their animation grosses back on the
upswing, box office for Disney animated features had been in steadily
decline since _The_Lion_King_'s high-water mark in 1994.   Factor in the
recent raising of the animation ante by DreamWorks's sumptuous epic
_The_Prince_of_Egypt_ and to be further elevated, if buzz is to be
believed, by the forthcoming _The_Iron_Giant_ from Warner Bros., that
Disney formula--as tried-and-true as it is--is looking ripe for
reinvention.   And that's what the Mouse has done with _Tarzan_, a highly
enjoyable adventure that takes risky devations from The Formula--and, for
the most part, succeeds.
As can be gleaned from the title, this 37th full-length Disney animated
feature is based on Edgar Rice Burroughs's legendary man of the apes
(voiced as a child by Alex D. Linz, as an adult by Tony Goldwyn), who was
raised by a family of gorillas after his parents were killed when he was
an infant.  Directors Kevin Lima and Chris Buck memorably cover the
backstory--the arrival and settling of Tarzan's parents in the African
jungle, their death at the hands (paws?) of a vicious leopard, Tarzan's
adoption by gorilla matriarch Kala (Glenn Close)--with an efficient and
stunningly animated prologue scored to the rhythmic Phil Collins-penned
and -performed tune "Two Worlds."  The song effectively conveys the
primary theme of the film: that of Tarzan being caught between the world
of gorillas and that of humans, a conflict that comes to the forefront
when a human expedition team, including the beguiling Jane (Minnie
Driver, extremely well-cast), arrives in the jungle.
"Two Worlds" is one of five tunes heard during the course of _Tarzan_,
but, unlike nearly all of Disney's animated output, the film is _not_ a
musical.  It was a daring move, but it was a wise one.  Collins's songs
function well as an underscore (in terms of music and in terms of the
story's themes), and in this story, to have the characters burst into
spontaneous song would have simply felt odd--not to mention have been a
distraction.
And that's exactly what the film's sole production number, the clumsily
integrated "Trashin' the Camp," is--a needless distraction that stands at
odds with the rest of the film.  The song is a showcase for Tarzan's ape
best friend Terk, who is voiced by Broadway's most famous fan, Rosie
O'Donnell.  As has been widely reported, O'Donnell agreed to do the film
only if she were given a song to perform.  While her involvement gives
_Tarzan_ some negligible marquee name value, it wasn't worth the expense
to the film as piece; it not only is out of place, it also stops the film
dead in its tracks.  Even worse, the number, which (as the song's title
implies) has Terk and her pals destroying the humans' camp, is, quite
simply, not much fun.
The same can be said for Terk and her elephant pal Tantor (Wayne
Knight), the designated comic relief of the film.  Plainly said, they
just aren't very funny; their phoned-in small guy/big oaf routine is a
poor man's imitation of _The_Lion_King_'s classic comic team of Timon and
Pumbaa.  I cannot think of any good reason for there to be any comic
relief in _Tarzan_ other than to make a safe concession to The Formula. 
Surely Lima, Buck, and screenwriters Tab Murphy, Bob Tzudiker, and Noni
White could have seen that there is enough situational comedy built into
the story, as clearly evidenced by the hilariously, adorably awkward
first meeting between Tarzan and Jane and the refined Jane's clumsiness
in the wild forest. 
The forest is indeed wild--and wonderfully alive--in the hands of Lima
and Buck, for _Tarzan_ signals another advancement for Disney in the
visual arts.  _Tarzan_ is by far the most inventive Disney effort in
terms of animation; the aforementioned opening is a wonder in and out of
context, and with none of the restrictions present in the flesh-and-blood
world, the exhilarating abandon of Tarzan's vineswinging can truly be
captured in its high-flying glory.  Because of the interspecies language
divide, _Tarzan_ is highly dependent on facial expressions, which the
animation crew has refined to an even greater level of precision than
previously seen in Disney films.
I wouldn't rank _Tarzan_ among the very best of the recent Disney
animation crop, but for all its shortcomings, it is still family
entertainment of the highest order, with great appeal to both kids and
adults.  It also represents a crucial turning point for the Mouse's
animation house: a brave step away from The Formula and toward a new,
more varied direction for the new millennium.

"I said he could stay. That doesn't make him my son."
With the voice talents of Tony Goldwyn, Wayne Knight, Brian Blessed,
Glenn Close, Alex D. Linz. Rated G.
Despite the recent success of pictures like Dreamworks' Antz, Disney
continues to reign as the king of animation. In recent years, it has
found a way to make "cartoons", as they are still affectionately called,
equally accessable to both children and adults. Works like Aladdin
entertained tykes with broader gags while keeping the often unwilling
parents glued to their seat with the razor-sharp wit that has since
become a trademark of Disney animation. The Lion King kept moviegoers of
all ages riveted with the unexpected power of its story (and I'm still
known to hum Hakuna Matata). So it comes as a disappointment that
Disney's latest production contains the least in years to interest
adults. Tarzan is one of the few features from the Mouse that fails to
transcend both age groups.
Loosely adapted from Edgar Rice Burroughs' classic tall-tale, Tarzan is
no longer a novelty, with nearly 50 films sporting some variation on the
legendary Ape Man. Even some of Tarzan's target audience has seen films
like George of the Jungle and have experience with the plot. And that
plot has nearly become a mimeograph, a template for filmmakers to
slightly tinker with and pass off as their own creation. Tarzan is
abandoned by his family in the jungle (due to the family's death),
discovered and raised by apes. Then Tarzan meets Jane, falls in love but
gets in trouble with his ape family as well as some of Jane's malevolent
companions.
With Tarzan, Disney has dared to release their first non-musical feature
in years, wisely keeping the songs being played in the background.
Unfortunately it is also the most non-memorable Disney feature. The
humor that punctuated films like The Lion King and Hercules is virtually
absent from this effort. Furthermore, Tarzan lacks interesting
characters, owing to the fact that Tarzan barely ever speaks. Visually,
this is one of the most impressive animated films to date, but as
Hollywood has discovered the hard way lately, visual flair is hard-
pressed to replace other, more important cinematic qualities. Still,
Tarzan seamlessly blends non-intrusive CGI images with the always
impressive handiwork to make a movie that is a sublimely effective piece
of eye-candy. And it tends to be more aesthetically pleasing to see an
animated Tarzan swinging gracefully through the vines then, say, a live
Johnny Weissmuller do it; he just doesn't have the knack for acrobatics
demonstrated by our animated friend. If nothing else, this new Tarzan is
gloriously devoid of campiness.
To its credit, this Tarzan has the guts to defy animation conventions.
Not only does it omit the redundant showtunes, but the hero doesn't have
a sidekick (what some might perceive as one isn't really a sidekick to
Tarzan; more like a good pal) and the villain has no henchman. It's
refreshing to see a different animated film, but unfortunately Tarzan
leaves out some of the good qualities along with the bad.
The film is voiced rather undistinctively by Tony Goldwyn as Tarzan,
Glenn Close as Tarzan's ape mother, Rosie O'Donnell as Tarzan's pal and
Lance Henricksen as the skeptical head of the ape family. The only
talent that stands out in Tarzan is that of the delightful Minnie Driver
as Jane; whose deliciouisly sarcastic and often hilarious delivery is
the only one that has a chance of appealing to the more sophisticated.
Family films need to be equally enjoyable to adults and wee ones alike,
thus the "family" moniker. But movies that can be equally alluring to
all age groups are exceedingly rare. Tarzan is superb childrens'
filmmaking, but adults might fare better skipping this surprisingly sub-
par endeavor.

     Tarzan the Ape Man gets the Disney treatment this year.  For some
classic characters (Snow White, Bambi), the transition has been a
positive one.  For others (Pocahontas), it's been a disaster.
Thankfully, TARZAN is among the former group.
     The last time we saw Tarzan, he was saving a Lost City in the worst
film of 1998 (shockingly titled TARZAN AND THE LOST CITY).  The story is
a bit more traditional this time, with Tarzan adopted by gorillas after
his human parents are killed by a leopard.  When he grows up, a group of
British explorers stumble upon him, and after the `You Tarzan, me Jane'
exchange, the British bad guy, Clayton, decides he's going to take all
the gorillas back to Britain for sale.  Adventure ensues, along with a
love story and singing.
     For an animated Disney plot, it's considerably better than recent
fare.  In fact, it might be too good  the kids in our audience were
more often found cowering in the aisles than watching the picture from
their seats.  Be aware that TARZAN has its share of adult moments
(including a hanging, seen in shadow)  more than I'd thought
appropriate.  The animation is top-notch, of course, and most of that
will be wasted on the youngsters, too.
     TARZAN is also (thankfully--most thankfully) light on the musical
numbers.  There's only one song performed by the characters, when the
gorillas take over the human camp and do a rendition of `Stomp.'  The
rest of the music is all in the background, fairly well done by Phil
Collins.  Again, it's awfully nice to *not* have to put up with a diva
or two on the soundtrack.  Even the whole talking animals thing makes
sense this time: Tarzan can speak to them.  The other humans cannot.
Well done.
     As for the annoying sidekicks (voiced by Rosie O'Donnell and Wayne
Knight), I leave them for either your mirth or your displeasure.
Ultimately, this Disneyfied TARZAN ends up somewhere between THE LION
KING and HERCULES.  You can decide for yourself exactly where.

"Tarzan" is the best animated adventure since "The Lion King"!
Not only does it have family drama, laughter, love, and five new songs
by Phil Collins, but it offers young boys a viable role model for the
emotional conflicts of adolescence. The story begins as a shipwrecked
infant is orphaned in Africa when his parents are devoured by a
leopard. Despite the initial reluctance of her mate, he is adopted by
a loving female gorilla, Kala (voiced by Glenn Close), who has herself
lost a child.  As Tarzan matures into a young man (Tony Goldwyn) with
the instincts and athletic prowess of a jungle animal, his idyllic
habitat is invaded by British visitors, most notably Jane (Minnie
Driver). Quickly realizing that she's more like him than any other
animal he's ever seen, he's immediately intrigued - and far too
curious. Meanwhile, her nutty father (Nigel Hawthorne) and gun-toting,
big game hunter (Brian Blessed) pose a threat to the sanctity of the
jungle. That much is predictable from the Edgar Rice Burroughs
classic. Yet there's a lot that's new here. Tarzan no longer swings on
vines; instead, he glides through the trees like a skateboard surfer
on safari. And Cheetah's been replaced by annoyingly brash, comical
Terk (Rosie O'Donnell). But, even deeper, this Tarzan is an adolescent
in search of his own identity, wondering: Who am I? What am I? And,
most important, where do I belong? It's a coming-of-age comedy-drama,
not unlike "The Lion King," and the thoughtful, sensitive conclusion
differs from the traditional tale. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to
10, this "Tarzan" is a timely, triumphant 10. He's a hero for our
times: a cool guy who seeks harmony and acts from the heart, utterly
devoid of machismo.

Disney takes another animated shot at a legend with the infamous
jungle-man's big screen release featuring the voices of Tony Goldwyn, Minnie
Driver, Glenn Close and Rosie O'Donnell.
PLOT:
Small child is abandoned in a jungle after his parents are killed by a
tiger, and eventually brought up by a pack of gorillas. Once matured, some
humans visit the island and attempt to lure the ape-man back to their
civilization, and capture said gorillas.
CRITIQUE:
Impeccably animated, this feature pulls you in with its incredible depiction
of a labyrinthian jungle tainted in emerald, majestic waterfalls and island
settings, a creatively scrawled Tarzan, and wonderful action sequences
featuring our main wild man frenetically swinging from vine to vine,
branch-surfing and roller-footing down limbs, and bellowing his way through
many a physical confrontation. The story, on the other hand, is one that we
are obviously all familiar with by now, and does little more to pull us in
further than any of its previous incarnations. All Disney animated films
generally take me over the top with a superior performance from either the
bad guy in the film (Jaffar from ALADDIN (7.5/10)) or the goofy sidekick
(Mushu from MULAN (7.5/10)). This film struck out on both counts, with a
less than compelling wicked character and no standout crony to speak of.
Having said that, I still found myself interested throughout most of this
picture because of its exquisite achievement in animation, with some
sequences eerily skimming the lines to reality, and other jumpin' jungle
shots suggesting three-dimensionality at their core. Pretty incredible up on
the big screen! If this was a live remake of the same story with the same
plot-line and characters, I probably would've dismissed it as hackneyed and
unimpressive in narration. But when you consider that it's a Mickey Mouse
Corp. feature starring many wondrous images and a familiar, yet oddly
original (in respect to its highly visual context), story, it has to be
appreciated on a much simpler playing field...that of a wide-eyed-child's
point of view. So I turn my head to its lack of overwhelming narrative and
the scary Phil Collins tunes, and applaud its ingenuity in animation,
musical numbers snub, fun action scenes and emotional effectiveness. Kids,
of course, will adore it!
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Glenn Close was the person who dubbed Andie MacDowell's Jane voice in the
1984 version of Tarzan called GREYSTOKE.
In 1912, Edgar Rice Burroughs first introduced the character of Tarzan to
the world. Since then, he has been featured in magazines, comic books, 26
authorized novels, radio and television programs, and more than 43 motion
pictures. Supposedly, Burroughs himself once toyed with the idea of an
animated version of his jungle hero, but nothing came of the project.

Mr. Bryan Frankenseuss Theiss
  I have a complicated relationship with Disney movies. In 1988, when Who
Framed Roger Rabbit came out and revived the American animation industry from a
creative and financial coma, I was about to enter high school. I had recently
become obsessed with Popeye and Rocky and Bullwinkle, and the Richard Williams
directed, Tex Avery inspired animated antics of the Toontown characters were
enough to push me over the edge into a permament fascination with animation.
And unless you're a white male in his 20's (which I am) who thinks that
animation is only sophisticated if it has big breasted women being raped by
demons and/or taking showers with giant robots (which I am not), being an
animation buff means watching every new Disney feature hoping that it will be
one of the good ones.
  And I have done that, enjoying all of the modern Disney features on some
level, including the unpopular ones. The widely criticized Pocahontas is one of
my favorites, combining more complex emotional situations than most Disney
features with some of Glen Keane's best animation acting - I like to cite the
silent first meeting between Pocohontas and John Smith as some of the greatest
character animation ever created. My absolute favorite of the modern Disney
movies is The Rescuers Down Under, which seems to be mostly ignored for the
most inane possible reason: disappointing box office returns. But to me it is a
great piece of entertainment. It inventively elaborates on the miniature mouse
society from the first Rescuers film, stands out from other Disney films by
being a full fledged action adventure, and contains awe inspiring animation of
a giant eagle (again, the work of Glen Keane) which is still impressive after
ten years of innovations in animation technique. In a way it, not The Little
Mermaid, should stand as the marker between old and new Disney, since it was
the first to use the CAPS system for computerized coloring.
  I do recognize the limitations of the Disney formula and am frustrated by the
company's tendency to be conservative. Therefore, I find that Disney movies are
best appreciated taking into account the constraints of the Disney formula, and
in comparison to other Disney movies. When compared to, say, The Nightmare
Before Christmas or The Thief and the Cobbler, Disney's version of Hercules
wouldn't be particularly striking in the design department. But compared to
other Disney features it seems shockingly adventurous, a near revolutionary
departure from the house style. And I admire the boundaries Disney pushes in
tiny steps, because I'm anxiously waiting for them to push hard enough that the
whole formula breaks and they aren't able to put it back together for a while.
  I also have somewhat of a bias against musicals. Some of my best friends are
musicals, such as The Nightmare Before Christmas and Willy Wonka and the
Chocolate Factory. But I have a definite preference for the Nightmare style of
musical, where the songs are impossible to separate from the story. They push
the plot along - most of the time, they *are* the plot - and they illustrate
the characters' emotions with a vividness that just could not be accomplished
with dialogue. What frustrates me is the Lion King style of musical, where the
songs seem to be there just because someone higher up wanted to have songs in
the movie. A lot of them really don't seem to have a strong enough story or
character purpose, and I'm reminded of the way Beavis and Butthead's storyline
is constantly interrupted by irrelevant music video breaks. The Lion King is
often held up as the pinnacle of Disney achievement, but to me it's the nadir.
Scenes like the death of Mufasa and the adult Simba's meeting with Rafiki are
dramatic and powerful, but I have a hard time appreciating them because I am so
distracted by the movie's tendency to spin off on tangents like the very
popular song about the farting warthog.
  All this is to establish why, without bursting out of the Disney formula,
Tarzan is the kind of Disney movie I have been waiting for. There's enough
tradition in there to satisfy the mothers and fathers who want to know what to
expect from a Disney movie before they buy their kids the video. But it
emphasizes the aspects of Disney movies that I like (emotional drama,
tremendous and at times subtle character animation) while playing down the ones
that I don't (unfunny comic relief, musical numbers). It's my kind of Disney
movie.
  For starters, Tarzan is not a musical. I didn't think Disney would ever try
this again after the financial failure of Rescuers Down Under (which also
wasn't a musical) but perhaps the success of Toy Story taught them that it's
possible make piles of money and even sell soundtracks without having sing
along songs. The catch is, the non-musical Disney formula requires the presence
of songs by cheeseball white rockers (in this case, Phil Collins, whose songs
are far less tolerable than Randy Newman's). It's a sacrifice I'm willing to
make, though, because without farting warthog tangents the story and characters
feel far more developed. Even the montages seem designed to tell the story
without the song lyrics, rather than just being there to illustrated the lyrics
with wacky antics.
  Before the release of Tarzan, there were rumors circulating that the more
serious tone of the film would be damaged by a musical number performed by a
scatting Rosie O'Donnell character named Terk. These reports were greatly
exaggerated. Tarzan purists looking for a serious, dramatic translation of the
story have every right to be disappointed. But when looked at as a Disney
movie, in relation to the studio's body of work, the song doesn't prevent the
film from being surprisingly serious. The scene, in which animals innocently
destroy a human camp, is more of a musical sound effect collage than an actual
musical number. It's playful and entertaining and organic to the story. I
would, however, like it better if Terk were breaking plates in awe like the
others, rather than dancing around conducting the whole primate orchestra. 
  Other than that there's not much emphasis on Rosie O'Donnell, and she doesn't
come across as embarrassingly unfunny as previous Disney comic relief
characters like Timon and Pumbaa and the Wisecracking Gargoyles. She doesn't
even fit the formula of the pasted on comic relief character, because she's
central to the story, having grown up with Tarzan and being bitter to see him
taking on relationships with humans. Terk's elephant buddy Tantor is a little
harder to swallow, because his design is more cartoony than the other animals,
and it's not clear whether he wanders away from his elephant troop to hang with
the gorillas, or whether he actually lives with them. There's also an
unfortunate incident of Tantor using his trunk as a periscope, which seems more
out of place than it would in other Disney movies since the movie for the most
part avoids that type of joke.
 The main advantage of an animated Tarzan, of course, is the way Tarzan moves.
It's Glen Keane to the rescue again, and it's hard to imagine another animator
pulling it off so well. Tarzan is a nearly naked mass of muscles, and he swings
deftly from vine to vine, barefoot surfs across trees and walks on his knuckles
like a gorilla. He even uses his toes as fingers, something I have a hard time
imagining in live action. He's an animal inside a human body, and he does his
best to mold his body into the proper animal shape. It's hard to imagine that
this portrayal of Tarzan will ever be topped, at least physically.
  My favorite character is an actual gorilla, though - Kurchak, the patriarch
of the gorilla family. His design is more realistic than most Disney animals,
but his arms are practically the size of an entire human. Voiced grimly by good
ol' Lance Henriksen, his menace and his relationship with Tarzan are the
emotional center of the film. All of the gorillas are afraid of Kurchak, but
Tarzan has particular reason to fear him, because he has never been accepted as
a real gorilla. When Tarzan discovers that there are other "creatures who look
like me," he threatens to endanger the gorilla family by leading humans to
them. Kurchak intimidates Tarzan, fiercely telling him to stay away from
humans. It's sad for many reasons, not the least of which is Tarzan and the
audience's knowledge that Kurchak is probably right.
  From childhood on, Tarzan is always trying to prove himself to Kurchak, but
of course it's not easy. When a vicious leopard attacks Kurchak and injures
him, Tarzan saves the day for the first time in an intense fight sequence which
culminates in Tarzan raising the droopy corpse of his opponent in the air and
making his trademark primal yell. The conflict is all in the facial expressions
as Tarzan tries to address Kurchak, not certain whether he's made him proud or
only humiliated him. Both in dramatic sophistication and in raw brutality,
sequences like this contradict Disney's reputation as a studio interested only
in kiddie fluff. Kurchak's final scene with Tarzan is even more powerful, and
the animation of the gorilla's facial expressions is incredible.
  Jane is also a strong character, far more memorable than most Disney heroines
due to a humorous vocal performance by Minnie Driver. Jane isn't the usual
blandly positive role model for young girls. She's humorously high strung, and
a little self-deprecating. Her first scene with Tarzan is a classic scene, far
more spot-on than Disney usually is when it comes to being funny. 
  Tarzan is also more action packed than most Disney films. A new computer
technique called Deep Canvas allows Tarzan and Jane to swing and swoop and
slide in every direction through complex, three-dimensional jungle backgrounds.
There are a few vine-swinging chase scenes that look and feel like
rollercoaster rides - a nice, unexpected touch.
  But what makes Tarzan more memorable for me are the quiet, subtle moments. I
like the way they approach the language barrier between animals and humans.
Tarzan has a talent for mimicking sounds, and uses it to learn a few phrases
from Jane. When he teaches Jane how to speak to gorillas, he teaches her to say
"Jane stays with Tarzan," and giggles like a little boy as he does it.
  There are many scenes where the animals only speak in animal noises. The
whole scene where Kala discovers baby Tarzan and decides to keep him is sad and
scary and entirely without words. Even when the characters do talk, it's the
physical gestures that end up saying the most - like the way Kala backs away in
fear when Tarzan brings humans to see her, or the way her eyes tear up when she
sees Tarzan wearing human clothes.
  The only major weakness in the film is in its villain, Clayton, a member of
Jane's party who secretly (but obviously) wants to poach the gorillas. His
design is inelegant, his voice is typical of Disney villains and his character
has far less dimension than the others in the film. He does, however, have an
emotional final showdown with Tarzan and Gets His a little more brutally than
other Disney villains. Ouch.
  I'm also not a fan of Jane's father, Porter, who looks suspiciously similar
to Belle's father in Beauty and the Beast. However, the only time he really
interferes with the story is in the finale, when he rather awkwardly invites
himself to move in with his daughter and her new boyfriend.
  But these aren't the things you come away from Tarzan thinking of. You
remember Kurchak's eyes as he dies, and young Tarzan noticing that his fingers
are different from his mother's, and Tarzan looking unnatural whenever he tries
to move like a human. 
  With some Disney movies, I always remember the unfortunate parts I didn't
like. When I think of  Hunchback of Notre Dame, I think of those ridiculous
comic relief gargoyles inappropriately joining in the climactic battle before I
think of the movie's attempt to deal with more serious, adult themes like the
lust of priests. But Tarzan strikes a better balance, so when I think of it I
think of nothing but classic scenes.  I don't think Tarzan is as perfect an
animated drama as, say, Kiki's Delivery Service. But I do think it's one of
Disney's best.

It's been a long time since Walt Disney has delivered us a classic along
the lines of The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast. Sure, there
have been delightful outings like last years Hercules. But nothing
entirely groundbreaking. With the release of the studio's newest feature
length film, a remake of Edgar Rice Burrough's creation Tarzan, Disney
has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques.
It's no classic, but this new Tarzan represents exactly what a family
film should be.
The plot is loyal to the original storyline, as Tarzan's parents are
forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire, and find shelter in
the jungles of Africa. But, they are killed (offscreen) by the snarling
cheetah Sabor, leaving baby Tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib. Found
by Kala (voiced with effective gentleness by Glenn Close), a kindhearted
mother and member of a gorilla pack, Tarzan is taken into the primate
group and raised as one of their own.
We follow the young boy through the years, as he partakes in various
adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend Terk (a very brash but
funny Rosie O'Donnell) and clumsy elephant Tantor (Wayne Knight). Of
course, in any Disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or
humorous chum for the hero. In Tarzan, these characters fill that space
rather inconspicuously. Gags that were magnified in other family films
are kept quite minor here. Most of the characters are amusing without
being forced.
As Tarzan grows to manhood, the suspected antagonist stumbles into the
picture. Here, the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter Clayton
(Brian Blessed), who's accompanying a hapless professor (Nigel
Hawthorne) on an expedition through the jungle. Of course, there's the
professor's daughter, Jane (nicely vocalized by a cheerful Minnie
Driver) who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie.
The thing that blew my socks off about this version of Tarzan is the
stunning animation. Directors Chris Buck and Kevin Lima have applied a
breathtaking 3-D element to the movement of the athletic title
character, and the fast-paced editing is absolutely a marvel. As Tarzan
carries Jane through the treetops, narrowly escaping a pack of nasty
baboons, he slips and slides like a daredevil snow boarder or star
surfer riding the big wave. Your eyes can barely keep up; it's a
fantastic accomplishment.
The subject matter here is also a notch or two above animation average.
There are important questions raised about Tarzan's place in the world,
and all are handled exceptionally well by the screenwriters. There is no
shred of doubt left to ponder afterward, which is a surprising plus that
I wasn't expecting to find here. Suffice to say, this film will have
both adults and children thoroughly entertained.
The grown-up Tarzan is voiced by Tony Goldwyn, who made a name for
himself as the `big mean jerk' from Ghost. Goldwyn is effective playing
someone who's not aware of his world's dangers. Glenn Close is also
memorable as his gorilla mother, and Lance Henriksen (from TV's
Millennium) is terrific as the silverback father unsure of how to accept
the presence of a human child. As the movie's villain, there is nothing
particularly special or catching about the character of Clayton. It
helps that Brian Blessed supplies his voice with game enthusiasm, but he
is nothing compared to James Woods' hilarious Hades from Hercules. A
burley guy with a big gun who just wants to capture the gorillas does
not quite constitute for an all-together noticeable screen presence.
Still, this is one great thrill-ride that Disney has constructed. I
never expected Rice Burrough's work to be transformed so successfully
from live action to animation, nor with so much emotional depth.
Parents, along with all the kiddies, are going to find much to like in
Tarzan.

One of the most amazing things about "Tarzan" is that it has taken this 
long for someone to produce an animated version of the Edgar Rice 
Burroughs adventure. With a lead character who talks with apes and 
routinely performs physical feats of superhuman ability, the jungle king 
has always seemed a natural for the form. Even Burroughs said so back in 
the '30s, with the caveat "the cartoon must be good. It must approximate 
Disney excellence." Done and done. Disney's "Tarzan" is a corker; a 
robust, remarkably kinetic realization of Burroughs' grand, preposterous 
fable. The most successful melding of classic and modern Disney styles to 
date, "Tarzan" takes the essence of the venerable tale and presents it in 
a streamlined form, filled with drama, humor and amazing vitality. 
The enduring popularity of "Tarzan" (47 films prior to this one, not to 
mention the TV series, comics and, of course, Burroughs' many books) is 
easy to understand. A kid grows up in the wild, away from all societal 
rules, to become a living legend, a hero routinely having fantastic 
adventures in an exotic world. Burroughs cooked up an incredibly juicy 
premise that neatly encapsulates virtually everyone's escapist fantasies, 
not to mention their sexual ones. Be honest, between Tarzan, the near-
naked jungle stud, and Jane, the prim Englishwoman who defies propriety 
to embrace the wild life, you've had a dirty thought or two.
Unfortunately, most "Tarzan" movies are formulaic crap. For every gem 
like 1934's "Tarzan and His Mate" (starring Johnny Weissmuller and 
Maureen O'Sullivan, the definitive Tarzan and Jane), there has been a 
steady stream of pure dreck, with trite situations and stock footage 
substituting for creativity. The nadir came last year with "Tarzan and 
the Lost City," a godawful mess with walking mannequin Casper Van Diem 
striking poses for 108 torturous minutes.  
Disney restores the luster to the franchise with its "Tarzan," a lush, 
economic offering which minimizes many well-known story points in favor 
of character development and swirling visuals. Although romance plays a 
part in the film, this "Tarzan" is primarily a coming-of-age story, as 
the young ape-man wonders why he is so different from the other apes and 
tries to find his place in the family, while his disapproving surrogate 
father glares from the distance (for a family-friendly company, Disney 
sure produces a lot of movies where at least one parent is either 
emotionally inaccessible or dead).
"Tarzan" takes care of the story basics with a dazzling opening montage 
set to Phil Collins' song, "Two Worlds," adroitly jumping between 
parallel shots of humans and apes. One breathtaking image flash-cuts from 
a human family cowering in a boat to an ape family huddled in the jungle. 
In short order, Tarzan's parents are killed by a leopard in their 
treehouse sanctuary, and Kala (Glenn Close), a grief-stricken gorilla 
mother who lost her child to a leopard, discovers the infant orphan. She 
adopts the squirming pink baby against the wishes of Kerchak (Lance 
Henriksen), her mate and leader of the tribe. As the child grows, he 
struggles to be accepted by his ape brethren, keeping up with the tribe 
by swinging on vines and "surfing" moss-covered tree limbs. Eventually, 
of course, humans show up and yadda yadda, you know the rest.
Thankfully, "Tarzan" is not a musical and Phil Collins' songs serve to 
propel, rather than interrupt, the story (incidentally, while I've been 
burned out on Collins for years, his rhythm-heavy tunes are surprisingly 
effective in this context). Although the artwork represents another leap 
forward for Disney, the company continues to cling to the tried and true, 
so Tarzan is provided two comic sidekicks. Wayne Knight is fine as a 
neurotic elephant, but Rosie O'Donnell, as a smart-ass ape, is a bit 
annoying, largely due to her grating voice. 
The rest of the actors are exemplary. Alex D. Linz voices Tarzan as a boy,
 with Tony Goldwyn as the adult ape-man, and both are very good. 
Particularly strong is Minnie Driver, providing Jane a nicely layered 
personality. Together, they make the oft-told story seem fresh and 
Tarzan's identity and cultural crisis genuinely poignant.
But the main appeal of the film remains the knockout combination of art 
and music. Beyond the thrilling action scenes, some of the best images 
are the smallest. When the infant Tarzan yawns and stretches, watch the 
movement of his tiny rib cage and belly. This baby actually moves like a 
baby - a rarity in cartoons. The depth and detail in the jungle vistas 
are equally impressive, as Disney continues to up the ante in animation. 
"Tarzan" may not be quite as compelling as some Disney films, but it 
still ranks as one of their strongest efforts to date, a rich melange of 
comedy, drama and adventure surrounded by some of the dandiest eye candy 
I've seen in a long time.

After watching Disney's latest animated offering, there were a couple
of points that stayed with me from the moment that I left the theatre
up until now as I sit in front of my computer.  The most striking was
the terrific animation and level of detail that we've come to expect
from Disney animators.  The beautiful waterfalls and the indigenous
wildlife of the lush African forest are vividly brought to life.  And
there are three notable scenes that highlight the level of detail at
work.  The first features Kala (voiced by Glenn Close), a mother
Gorilla who saves young baby Tarzan from the jaws of a hungry leopard. 
Another involves a battle between a now-grown-up Tarzan versus the
leopard that almost killed him as a child.  And another scene features
Tarzan saving a prim, young, lass named Jane (voiced by Minnie Driver)
from a pack of hungry beasts.  He swings from vine to vine and slides
up and down an array of branches with the same look and feel of an
Olympic bobsled run.  This is nothing less than impressive.
`Tarzan' is about an orphaned baby that is raised in the wilds by
gorillas.  Kala cares for and adores him like her own son, but her mate
and leader of the gorilla pack, Kerchack (voiced by Lance Hericksen)
doesn't accept him.  He's different from the others, and as the ugly
duckling, Tarzan has to convince the protective Kerchack and even his
own gorilla play pals that he does belong among his simian siblings.  
Yet as Tarzan grows older, he does notice innate differences between
himself and his mother.  He becomes further confused after meeting
Jane, the first human that he encounters.  He sees that he has
physiologically more in common with Jane than he does with his gorilla
family.  Questions of self-identity and measures of self-worth are
brought forth, and now Tarzan wonders what his true calling is.  Trying
to sort out his loyalties and learning more about himself are
family-values' elements at which Disney storytelling excels.  Kids can
relate easily to this situation.  And I think that most kids will also
enjoy the clumsy antics of Tarzan's elephant friend, Tantor  (voiced by
Wayne Knight) and the sardonic wit of Terk (voiced by Rosie O'
Donnell). 
But the film has a definite feeling of maturity to it.  Another
subplot, although less intriguing, involved Jane's fellow travelers. 
One of them is her father (voiced by Nigel Hawthorne) who is on a
scientific trip to study the gorillas.  The other traveler is Clayton,
He purports to be their bodyguard, but he secretly wants to find these
gorillas and to capture them for a pretty penny.  This rogue is as oily
as they come.   He senses Tarzan's attraction to Jane and exploits his
feelings in order to gain knowledge of the gorillas' secret nesting
area.  Boo!  Hiss!
I have grown used to Disney films as being feel-good adventures filled
with humor, song, and color.  And maybe that's why Little Mermaid still
ranks as my favorite among all of the Disney animated films.  This film
(and I think recent Disney animated features in general) has purposely
tried to be more adult-oriented.  For example, many songs in the film
are created by contemporary popmeister Phil Collins, while the colors
of the film are noticeably paler than Aladdin or Beauty and the Beast
or even Pocahontas.  Tarzan is surprisingly weighty and Disney films
are definitely maturing.  But my mind is still humming `Under the Sea.'

TARZAN by DeWyNGaLe (John Sylva)    Rating: B
http://members.aol.com/DeWyNGaLe/MoviePED.html
Disney, who is still the king of animation and always will be, has been in a
slump lately, with its last two animated films not doing well at the box
office, Hercules and Mulan.  Disney used to deliver classic films such as The
Lion King and Beauty and the Beast, but hasn't come out with anything even
close to the quality of those films recently, but Tarzan gives it a good shot.
Tony Goldwyn is the voice of Tarzan in this adaption of the famous legend.  The
film starts off from Tarzan's beginning, when he is just an infant.  In the
jungle, his parents are killed by a cheetah, but Tarzan is left unharmed, but
alone.  When Kala, voiced by Glenn Close, a gorilla who roams among the jungle
nearby where Tarzan's parents were killed, finds Tarzan, she takes him to live
with her family.  Kerchak, voiced by Lance Henrikson, who is the leader of the
ape family, doesn't want an outsider to be a part of their family, but gives in
to Kala, who will raise Tarzan alone.  While Tarzan grows up, he learns the
ways of the gorilla, taking on their language, walking style, and their
behavior.  Still after many years, Kerchak avoids Tarzan.
Now grown up, Tarzan has the full agility and speed that a gorilla does.  One
day while roaming the vast jungles, Tarzan discovers Porter, voiced by Nigel
Hawthorne, his daughter Jane, voiced by Minnie Driver, and friend Clayton,
voiced by Brian Blessed.  The three have set up a camp, as they plan to search
for gorillas, and Tarzan has no idea what they are, considering he doesn't even
know other humans exist.  He immediately bonds with Jane, as they become
wonderful friends as time goes on.  Jane teaches Tarzan the ways of human, the
English language, and how to walk and behave like a human.  Of course Tarzan's
entire family is upset that he has found new friends, especially his life long
friend Terk, voiced by Rosie O'Donnell.  
Tarzan is a new step in animated features, creating vast jungles and roaring
waterfalls that seem real.  Sequences in which Tarzan is swinging on vines
rapidly are particularly well done, creating a real environment.  Even though
the environment looks tremendously real, the gorillas do not.  This is most
likely to make them kid friendly, but if Disney has the power to make things
look real, they should include the creatures.
One key feature of Tarzan is that the characters don't break out into a song
every thirty seconds, but the songs are in the background while the action on
screen is taking place.  This transition was a smart move, considering most
songs in Disney films are lengthy and not well-written.  Phil Collins, who
wrote and performed all of the music for Tarzan, does a nice job.  The lyrics
and beat to the songs fit the movie perfectly, but the songs seemed too much
alike.
Tarzan is missing the magic that other Disney movies, such as Aladdin and The
Lion King, have had.  Aladdin and The Lion King had moving, epic stories, that
appeal to adults and children, but Tarzan seems to be an attempt for Disney to
get back in the game, and not an effort to touch the hearts of children and
adults.  Although Tarzan is good, it doesn't seem like a Disney film, lacking
humor and character development.  The Lion King was moving, as you cared about
the characters, because they were developed carefully, but in Tarzan, the
characters don't change much, and Tarzan seems to just swing around in the
trees, rather than letting the viewer get to know him better.  The only
characters who seem like they belong in this film are Jane and her father
Porter, who have light and friendly personalities that fit a Disney film.
After viewing Tarzan, there is no impact on me at all, there are no memorable
moments that I am still thinking about, and I hardly remember any scenes from
the movie.  Tarzan looks great, but the quality doesn't live up to the
animation.  The voices are good though, as Rosie O'Donnell, Tony Goldwyn, and
Minnie Driver give the best voice tracks among the large cast.  Tarzan isn't
for children under 7, due to the darkness and some violent sequences which
don't belong in a children's film.  If directors Kevin Lima and Chris Buck
would have made this film more kid friendly, then Tarzan would be up there with
Disney's best recent animated feature, The Lion King.
The Bottom Line- Disney gives a good try to get back in the big time, but
doesn't succeed.

For the forty-ninth celluloid addition of Tarzan, Disney has created a
sometimes excellent, mostly below-par animated translation. The main concern
that this film has to worry about is that it may not succeed in satisfying its
target age ranges. The gruesome deaths of a number of characters may distract
younger viewers and the overall sappiness Tarzan has may distract teenagers.
(Tarzan can swing and slide throughout the jungle like a skateboarder on a
half-pipe, an obvious attempt to make teenagers forget about the saccharine
mood of the film). Another problem is that this film is nothing new. The
animation may have advanced over the years, but the story of a character who
does not know where to fit in has been used to death by Disney (see The Little
Mermaid, The Lion King, Aladdin, etc.). These films ostensibly may seem
different from first glance, but in reality, they're all the same; Same ending,
same characters, same ultimate morals.  Tarzan is no exception to this trend.
The movie is unoriginal and predictable. The aforementioned films above share
these negative adjectives with Tarzan, but they are not as blatantly obvious
or, for some reason, as painful to sit through. 
Also those Disney classics all have very memorable characters that carry the
whole movie. The Little Mermaid's Sebastian, The Lion King's Timon and Pumbaa,
and Aladdin's The Genie all shined with excellent supporting roles. Tarzan
attempts to add some comedic flair to its cast with friends of Tarzan named
Terk and Tantor. Voiced by Rosie O'Donnell and Wayne Knight respectively, they
are both underused and not as funny. The only noteworthy voice from the cast
was that of Minnie Driver as Jane. Perfectly cast as the British researcher who
falls in love with the protagonist, Driver's confused, stuttering voice is very
convincing when she first meets Tarzan and as the film progresses, she still
maintains the same justifiable uneasiness of where she is and who she is
talking to. 
The story, of course, follows Tarzan, a boy raised by gorillas and his attempts
to fit in with his family by copying their exact mannerisms and gesticulations.
When he discovers humans for the first time, he must decide where he belongs in
life. Tarzan is, as mentioned before, irritating in some areas, particularly in
the beginning and the end. It takes way too long for Tarzan to meet Jane and
since you know exactly what will happen at the end, it is almost unbearable to
sit through.  For an alternative to this Disney feature, check out the
under-appreciated Warner Bros. flick The Iron Giant.

 Normally, whenever Disney gets a new tech toy, it takes them a while to get
used to it, to learn it fully and bring their films back up to par.  With
Tarzan, this gap is nonexistent.  With its first outing, Deep Canvas takes
Tarzan's animation to incredible levels, giving us the best quality
animation in years.
 Perhaps then it is fitting that Tarzan is the movie that finally pulls the
Disney animation team out of its slump.  Ever since The Lion King (not
inclusive), they have been slacking on the quality of animation and the
quality of film that they turned out.  And, if there is one thing that
Tarzan doesn't do, its slack.
 Tarzan also doesn't mess around.  It begins quickly with a ship burning at
sea and the last-minute self-saving action of a man and his family, and
never stops in pace from there.  Unlike the last several Disney films, which
drag their feet, Tarzan never wastes a minute of its running time.  Its
characters are simple but good, the voices perfect.  Instead of making an
American fake a British accent, they import actual Brits for British roles.
 The movie is, sadly, a very old and unoriginal story.  Anyone familiar with
the Tarzan story knows it, knows the famous and infamous line ("Me Tarzan,
you Jane").  We've been inundated with the line since birth.  Like the Jaws
theme it has been parodied innumerable times.  However, by keeping it simple
and adding a Disney-style humor, they manage not to let the movie fall into
a slump.
 Another thing that almost kills the movie are the songs by Phil Collins.
The movie has a fine musical score, one that goes in sync with the feel of
the moment.  However, whenever one of the musical numbers comes on, it feels
highly distant from the movie.  The sound of the song, the lyrics, all of
them go completely against what is happening off screen.  It has a way of
getting under your skin, and causing an itch.
 The true saving grace of the movie comes in the form of the animation.
Tarzan literally surfs through the jungle, flying from vine to vine and
sliding up and down trees like the ultimate circus acrobat.  Whenever each
one of those sequences comes on, you are given the feeling that you are
right there, experiencing it.  It's like an animated roller-coaster ride.
 The voices on the movie are excellent.  Minnie Driver, a true brit, takes
the role of Jane and gets to have some fun in it (rather than play the
ultimate oppressed woman).  Brian Blessed voices Clayton, a game hunter who
is out to poach Gorillas, and he does it with all the appropriate charm of a
snake.  Lance Henriksen, from "Millenium" fame, does the appropriately
deep-voiced Kerchak, the silverback head of the gorillas.  Wayne Knight
voices and elephant.  Rosie O'Donell plays a sarcastic ape.  In short, they
all do voices that fit exactly with who there characters are.
 Tarzan, the first good animated film I've seen in '99, is definitely going
to pull Disney out of its slump.  Fiscally, it's always been able to keep
going, but now the quality has risen to match.  Finally, I can breathe a
sigh of relief.  The five-year Disney reign of terror has ended.

Disney's recent animated efforts have become nearly identical in plot
and indistinguishable in theme.  They all follow the same basic
formula: rich, gun-toting white guys = bad; cute animals,
strong-willed women, and weird freaks = good.  Let it be known that
the company's most recent foray into the animated market, "Tarzan," is
no exception.  It's certianly a typical Disney movie, although it's
probably one of their better efforts in recent years.  Despite its
problems (and they are certianly legion), "Tarzan" manages,
ultimately, to be a passably entertaining time at the movies.
The film opens with a brief sequence that sets up the backstory.  With
the accompaniment of a mind-numbingly annoying, quasi-African song
blaring over the soundtrack, we see Tarzan's parents barely escape a
harrowing shipwreck with their newborn son and make their way to a
tropical island.  Once there, they build a "Swiss Family
Robinson"-esque hut.  The parts of the sequence dealing with Tarzan's
parents are intercut with shots of Tarzan's future family, the
gorillas, leading their daily life.  During one of the gorilla-related
moments, we see a baby gorilla get killed and his mother's reaction.
By the end of the sequence, Tarzan's parents are also dead, having
been killed by an evil tiger that looks suspiciously like Kahn from
"The Jungle Book."
The mother gorilla, Kala (voice of Glenn Close), discovers the hut.
While scouring through it, she finds baby Tarzan hidden under a
blanket.  Still grief-stricken over the loss of her child, she views
Tarzan as a potential replacement.  
The leader of her Tribe, Kerchak (voice of Lance Henriksen), thinks
otherwise.  He views Tarzan as a threat, and orders Kala to leave him
in the jungle to let him fend for himself.  Kala's strong maternal
instincts ultimately prevail, however, and Kerchak reluctantly decides
to let Tarzan stay.
We are then "treated" to yet another annoying musical sequence, scored
with what sounds like the same song from earlier in the movie.  The
sequence culminates with baby Tarzan growing into boyhood.  The movie
lingers in that stage of Tarzan's life for a while, showing us the
inevitable conflicts that a boy child would have when raised among
gorillas.  Tarzan is viewed as different and strange by his playmates
(a clumsy, obvious stab at racism that is typical of Disney).  Kerchak
still views Tarzan as an outsider, and is suspicious of his every
move.  His status isn't helped any by a botched attempt to impress his
friends by stealing a hair from an elephant.  The plan backfires when
he causes a stampede that nearly wipes out the entire tribe.  
Finally, after another sequence scored with what sounds like the same
song, Tarzan grows into adulthood.  He is generally accepted now,
although Kerchak still doesn't like him much.  His relatively
care-free existence is challenged when he discovers a small group of
humans trudging through the jungle.  The group consists of Professor
Porter (voice of Nigel Howthorne), a kindly old gentleman who only
wants to study the gorillas, his beautiful daughter, Jane (voice of
Minnie Driver), who wants to do the same, and their guide, Clayton
(voice of Brian Blessed), this movie's obligatory gun-toting, and
hence evil, white male.  Having never seen the female of his species,
Tarzan obviously finds himself attracted to Jane.
Tarzan studies them from a distance until Jane finds herself being
chased through the jungle by a band of monkeys.  Tarzan swoops down
via a vine and rescues her, taking her on a wild ride though the
trees.  Shaken up by the experience, Jane returns to the small group's
camp and tells her companions about her adventure.  Inevitably, they
dismisss her experience, citing Tarzan as merely a fantasy.  They
change their respective minds, however, when Tarzan shows up at their
camp.
As Tarzan spends more and more time with his fellow humans, he finds
himself to be increasingly attracted to Jane, and the human lifestyle
in general.  He must decide between his love for Jane and the only
family that he has known throughout his entire life up to that point. 
The themes in "Tarzan" are certianly not new to Disney movies.  As
aforementioned, all of the politically correct stereotypes are there,
and Tarzan's delimma is reminiscent of "The Jungle Book" and
"Pocahontas."  These movies have become continual repititions of the
same themes under different contexts.  Furthermore, the film's climax
seems incredibly contrived and serves merly to satisfy a Disney
convention.  
I was also a bit disturbed by the erotic overtones in this movie.
There are some unavoidable, implied, sexual themes when you have a
half-naked ape man running around in the jungle; themes, I think, that
are a bit too mature for the target audience.  The attraction between
Tarzan and Jane was very erotic, far more so than most Disney movies.
One scene in particular, where Tarzan studies Jane, went a bit too far
in my opinioin.  Since Tarzan can barely communicate with Jane, the
only possible attraction is physical.  Tarzan is even referred to as
Jane's "fantasy" at one point.  
Still, "Tarzan" has a couple of very good points, the most notable of
which is the knock-out animation.  Much like "A Bug's Life," this
movie looks so good that it's worth watching along those lines (I was
actually more visually entrhalled during "Tarzan" than I was during
"The Phantom Menace").  The story, while contrived and inherintly
politically correct, works and is entertaining when looked at within
the light of a children's movie.  Despite my mostly negative sounding
review, I have to admit that "Tarzan" is leaps and bounds ahead of
Disney's last animated effort, "Mulan."  It's certianly not up to par
with the likes or "Peter Pan" or "Robin Hood," but it's still mildly
entertaining, enough so to garner a limited recommendation from me.

Sometimes, a movie goes so far beyond political correctness that it
becomes necessary to coin a new term to describe the bizarre gyrations
a movie studio will undertake to avoid offending the professionally
offended.  In my opinion, a good candidate for this new term is
"tarzan", as in:  "That movie was tarzan from end to end" and "man,
they really tarzanned that one up".
Mind you, the visuals of Disney's new animated Tarzan are often lush,
and the hardware assisted graphics are mind boggling.  In fact, the
only times where the animation falls short, where it gets most
saturday-morning-ish,  are the very times when the movie is at it's
most obsequious.  It's almost as if two animation teams worked on the
film; one from a major motion picture studio, and one from Darkwing
Duck.
Tarzan is, thankfully, entirely free of the dreary, unrelenting potty
humor that has plagued recent Disney releases.  Although the humor is
usually forced and often embarrassing, it doesn't stoop to the stygian
depths of My Favorite Martian, or even the mild anal references in
Flubber.  Tarzan, in fact, has the antiseptic quality of early Disney
cartoons.  Back when they were, you know, good.
But what Disney studios did to the story, and for what (apparent)
reasons, is something that should never happen to a major novel.
Tarzan of the Apes, published in 1912, was the first novel in a series
that eventually became 30-odd novels, books of short stories, and
juveniles.  In this story, John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, and his young
wife are abandoned on an African beach by mutineers.  Clayton does the
best he can for his young bride, but eventually, some time after
giving birth to a son, she succumbs to madness and death.
Nearby dwell a tribe of the "near exinct"  (and probably fictional)
"great apes" the "largest and most ferocious" of the simians.  Their
leader is the bloodthirsty Kerchak, a huge bull ape prone to episodes
of sudden uncontrollable rage.  It was during one of these episodes
that he attacks Kala, a young female in his tribe, and causes the
death of her child.
Inevitably, the tribe finds Clayton's cabin, and Kerchak himself kills
John Clayton as he sits in deep depression after his wife's death.
The apes explore the cabin, and Kala finds Clayton's young son still
alive in the crib, next to the body of his mother.  Nearly mad with
grief over the loss of her own cub, Kala takes the young child to
raise as her own, calling him Tarzan.  Tublat, Kala's mate, appeals to
Kerchak (during one of his more lucid moments) to force Kala to give
up the hairless ape, but Kala threatens to leave the tribe, and
Kerchak is reluctant to lose her.
Tarzan, of course, grows up with the apes, learning to use his greater
intelligence and natural curiosity to compensate for his lack of brute
strength and natural armament.  At ten years old, his curiosity leads
him to his unknown father's cabin, where he finds the hunting knife
which would be the means of his salvation when he's attacked soon
after by a huge gorilla.  Tarzan narrowly escapes death and makes his
first great kill.
Years later, when Kerchak flys into one of his famous rages, Tarzan
kills him and assumes leadership of the tribe.
The story is told from an ape's point of view, using words in the
(again, fictional) ape language to describe the world around Tarzan.
Hence, we have Numa, the lion, Sheeta, the panther, Tantor, the
elephant, Gora, the moon.  Tarzan lives with the apes, but differs
mainly in his intelligence, practical jokes, and preference for fresh
meat which he has killed himself, as opposed to the grubs and carrion
preferred by the rest of the tribe.
When Tarzan reaches adulthood, a wandering tribe of cannibals moves
into the neighborhood.  When Kala is killed by Kulonga, the son of
Chief Mbonga of the cannibal tribe, a bloody feud is begun between
Tarzan and the tribe that would last for many years.  From the tribe,
Tarzan steals weapons and his first garments.
Through a bizarre set of circumstances, Tarzan learns to read and
write English and speak French but not the other way around.
Later, William Clayton, nephew of Tarzan's father John Clayton,
American Jane Porter, her black servant, her father and his assistant
land near the cabin to look for an historic buried treasure.  When the
group is threatened by jungle animals, a renegade from Kerchak's
tribe, cannibals and pirates, Tarzan must save them repeatedly.  A
love triangle develops between William Clayton, Jane, and Tarzan that
is not resolved by the novel's conclusion.  Eventually, Tarzan follows
Jane to civilization.  His odd education is filled out along the way,
and in the fullness of time he becomes a polished aristocrat with the
instincts, strength and reflexes of a savage beast.
That's Tarzan of the Apes in a nutshell.  Now, let's let Michael
Eisner loose on it.
First of all, we must scour the story clean of any People of Color.
Gone are Jane's servant and all local natives.  Disney's Africa is,
curiously, completely devoid of Africans, reminding one of Apartheid's
"empty land theory".  This was, apparently, preferable to showing
People of Color in roles that might upset the Terminally Offendable.
Or maybe Eisner just doesn't like blacks in his cartoons.  I don't
know.
Of the lily-white cast, Tarzan's parents lose their objectionable
upper-crust heritage and become no-name survivors of a ship fire.
William Clayton, Lord Greystoke, Tarzan's cousin, becomes the
completely unrelated "Clayton", a standard, paper-thin Disney villian,
utterly interchangeable with Governer Rattcliffe and Gaston,
ostensibly the guide of Professor Porter.  In a great unintentional
in-joke, Tarzan, when learning English, mistakenly believes that
"Clayton" is the name of the noise made when the villian fires his
gun.  And that's all Clayton is, in the movie -- an excuse for lots of
gunshots.
Guns, of course, are only ever two things:  Completely ineffective
(the shotgun in Tarzan's luckless parents' cabin) or completely evil
(the double barrelled high capacity elephant-machine-gun wielded by
Clayton).  Clayton "searches for apes" by shooting at anything that
makes a sound.  Just what you always wanted in a guide.
Professor and Jane Porter are transformed from treasure seekers to
naturalists in search of gorrillas to study.  Burroughs' "great apes"
become Gorillas In The Mist.  Tublat is gone, and Kerchak (now a
silverback Gorilla) takes his place as Tarzan's wise, noble, adopted
father.  Just as Clayton and his henchmen are intolerably bad, the
gorillas are intolerably good and noble and just.  You can't have any
shades of grey in a Disney movie, no sir.  Nor can you have animals
acting like, well you know, animals.
True to Disney formula, Tarzan is saddled with two wisecracking
sidekicks, an embarrassed sounding Wayne Knight as Tantor The
Anxiety-Ridden Elephant, and in probably the most annoying role in her
career, a screechy, wisecracking Rosie O'Donnell as Terk, a midget ape
with bad hair.  In a minor divergance from formula, the sidekicks are
not at Tarzan's side for the entire movie, but true to the Disney
vision, they contribute nothing to the plot except some really painful
attempts at humor and one completely improbable rescue.
Thankfully, Tarzan isn't a musical as such, with the exceptions of a
brief bedtime song from Kala to young Tarzan, and a really horrible
be-bop number by Rosie O'Donnell that stops the story dead and is
guaranteed to make you squirm in your seat.  An excellent time for a
potty break.
Phil Collins tunes comprise most of the background music, and are
decent enough to almost make me want to buy the album.
As mentioned above, Burroughs' Tarzan subsists mostly on meat he has
killed himself.  Disney's Tarzan, true to nineties sensibilities, eats
only fruit and appears to be completely non-violent, killing nothing
during the movie's 88 minutes, not even nasty old meat-eating Sheeta,
the panther, who expires bloodlessly by accidentally falling on
Tarzan's spear offscreen.  In all of Tarzan's altercations, his main
strategy seems to be to keep his opponant occupied until said opponant
accidentally hurts himself.
There are ragged scraps of the original story in there someplace, and
indeed, Disney's Tarzan retains more of Burroughs' Tarzan of the Apes
than most of the 30-odd Tarzan movies that preceeded it.  Some of the
action scenes are amazing.  But while Disney has retained cosmetic
similarities, they've torn the guts out of the story, leaving only a
good looking, unoffensive corpse in it's place.
In fact, what is left is no more or less than a gender-switched
Pocahontas, with the same basic plot, character types, and a slightly
different ending.
Burroughs is on record as saying that his Tarzan character could best
be realized in animation, and this latest effort shows the potential
of the medium to tell the story of the displaced Lord Greystoke.
Perhaps some day we will see an effort from some other studio (perhaps
one of the Anime teams?) that hasn't been deliberately neutered.
Score:  One star of four for spectacular computer-assisted animation,
a few great action sequences, and some decent backgroup music.  Should
have been two stars, but I had to subtract one for general annoyance.

Title:  `Tarzan' beautiful to look at, easy to follow.
Review: Disney continues its trend of producing animated summer blockbuster 
movies meant mostly for children but with enough wit and charm for adults to 
be interested and at least entertained by the story.
        The basic premise is the same as every other `Tarzan' story: a boy is 
raised in the African jungle by gorillas and becomes one himself never really 
understanding (or even noticing) that he's human and is a lot different from 
the animals he befriends.
        The first third of the film shows how Tarzan comes to be adopted by 
Kala (voiced by Glen Close), a female gorilla who lost her own child in a 
classic case of Darwanism. Her mate, Kerchak (Henriksen), is a mean, 
conservative leader of the pack of gorillas who make up Tarzan's extended 
family. He refuses to acknowledge Tarzan (voiced by Alex D. Linz during the 
childhood scenes) as a son and often has to hold himself back from killing 
Tarzan after he continually does dangerous, wild things that are the result 
of his own childish instincts. I have a feeling children will quickly be able 
to identify with Tarzan since all he really is is just a kid who wants to 
have fun and it's funny how the adults fail to comprehend this.
        Later, as the story transitions from Tarzan as a child to a 
full-grown man (voiced by Goldwyn), he is encounter by a party of three 
humans from England: Jane Porter (Driver), a beautiful woman who is something 
of a zoologist and an artist, her father Prof. Archimedes Q. Porter (voiced 
by Nigel Hawthorne) who is also a scientist; and their slick and cunning, yet 
barbaric safari bodyguard Clayton (Blessed).
        It's easy to tell where the story is going at all times but the 
screenplay doesn't seem like it was written hastily nor dumbed down for 
children's enjoyment. Sure there's a lot of cliche stuff here, like Clayton's 
smugness and diabolical manipulation of Tarzan and Jane; the goofy supporting 
characters (voiced by Rosie O'Donnell [in full Brooklyn accent!] and Wayne 
Knight - `Hello Newman!').
        There's also a lot of fun action such as Tarzan's swinging through 
the jungle on vines and sliding down and around tree branches and trunks. 
It's just like skateboarding really fast and doing all sorts of tricks (those 
McDonald's commercials really prove this point).
        Ultimately, you get exactly out of `Tarzan' what you expect... and I 
mean that as a compliment, so have high expectations.
Pros: Animation and sound are a feast for the senses, story is lighthearted, 
breezy and not dumbed-down, no stupid sing-along songs to get stuck in your 
head.
Cons: Surprisingly violent, should have been rated PG. Young children may not 
understand some of the more adult themes (parents, be ready to have some 
heavy questions thrown your way). Running time is a bit short.
Would you recommend this to friends? Not to MY friends, but to the 
movie-going public I would.
Score: *** (out of ****) or 4 (out of 5 with no 0 rating).

There is something so magical about animation- it's taking art and
shaping it into a story.  Disney has captured the glory and significance
of this movie art form through the years and Tarzan's animation is
mesmerizing.  I wish I could say the same for the movie itself.  I liked
it a lot, but it doesn't hold up in the company of The Little Mermaid,
Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, or The Hunchback of Notre
Dame.  Perhaps I find the latest Disney offerings (Pocahontas, Mulan,
Tarzan) somewhat disenchanted because I am growing up.  However, I still
continue to watch old Disney classics and the earlier 90s films and am
always thrilled by them.  Tarzan is good fun, though, and it even has
something to say - that perhaps a child can be raised by anyone, any
animal; that we can all live in harmony and peace together on this
earth, beast and man.
Set in Africa, the film begins with scenes of Tarzan's parents being
shipwrecked and building a house for themselves on the island upon which
they are stranded.  When Tarzan's two parents are killed by a viscous
leopard, ape Kala (Glenn Close), who has also lost her baby to the
leopard, adopts him as her own.  Her mate Kerchak (Lance Henriksen)
disapproves.  He is a melancholic ape who will, for most of the rest of
his life, taunt and be cold towards Tarzan.  There is a part of Kala who
thinks Tarzan can replace her dead baby.
As Tarzan grows up, he makes friends with Turk, another ape (Rosie
O'Donnell), and Tantor, an elephant (Wayne Knight).  When a group of
explorers visits the jungle, Tarzan is curious because they look exactly
like he does.  He is suddenly angry at his ape mother for hiding this
from him, the fact that there are people who look like him, and soon
discovers the truth of his adoption.  He befriends these humans, among
them a bubbly Minnie Driver character, a courageous, spunky girl named
Jane Porter.  She, her father (Nigel Hawthorne), and Clayton (Brian
Blessed), a man who is with them to protect them but seems to always go
against their wishes, are in the wilds to study gorillas.  Mr. Porter
has a theory that gorillas are social animals and are gentle.  Clayton,
the core villain of the film, thinks differently and is out to shoot
some.  When Jane is attacked by a group of monkeys, Tarzan comes to her
rescue, and then, they fall in love.  Tarzan must then decide whether he
wants to stay in the world he has known all his life or go back to where
he "belongs."
One of the movie's greatest flaws is the lack of a memorable villain.
The Gaston-like brute Clayton, is stupid and not frightening at all.
Because of this, Tarzan just isn't as fun as it could've been.  I
enjoyed Phil Collins' songs laden with percussion beats.  There is a
nice bounce to the beginning of the single version of the Rob Cavallo
co-produced "You'll Be In My Heart."  Though none of the songs are as
memorable as Disney's earlier theme songs, Collins' work fits the film
perfectly.  I enjoyed the voices, too.  I bet Rosie O'Donnell had a lot
of fun creating Terk's voice.  She kind of exaggerates too much and her
performance doesn't seem as natural as Minnie Driver's performance, but
she's fun.  Driver is enthusiastic and her magnetic self as Jane, and
Nigel Hawthorne is funny as Jane's lively father.
Over the years, I have set high standards for Disney movies.  They used
to have grandeur and heart, and while Tarzan has both, it is all to a
lesser degree.  Tarzan has a vibrant energy in its scenes in which
Tarzan is fighting with animals like leopards and wild monkeys, but as a
whole, the movie is disappointing; fun, but underwhelming.

The Happy Bastard's Quick Movie Review
For a minute there, I thought I was going to be groaning over the
release of Disney's latest, another adaptation of a legend from the
past.  (Remember the pathetic Pocahontas?  Yikes!)  But guess what-
Disney, a company that's been on a roll lately with animated films,
strikes again with another wonderful tale that pleases the eyes as well
as the inner kid in you.
The story is pretty basic- Tarzan is left orphaned and a female gorilla
who's lost her young adopts him into her group.  As he matures into a
much older man, Tarzan still wonders just why he's so much different
from the clan, and then arrives a hunter, a professor, and the
professor's lovely daughter, Jane- who meets Tarzan rather quickly after
getting in trouble with a group of feisty babboons.  From there, Tarzan
faces tough choices- should he stay with the ones that he grew up with
or go join his own kind in England?
The voicework here is pretty top-level.  Tony Goldwyn is very convincing
as the Ape Man; Minnie Driver adds a delectable touch to the
already-beautiful Jane; Nigel Hawthorne makes for a pretty nasty hunter
voice; Rosie O' Donnell keeps the laughs rolling as Tarzan's best ape
friend Terk; and Wayne "Newman" Knight has his moments as a panicky
elephant.
The movie is superb throughout, mixing a great script with incredible
computer-assisted visuals.  When Tarzan tree-surfs (a twist that was
added on top of the same ol' vine swinging- and a great one, I might
add), the camera twists and turns, allowing the trees all around to come
to life vividly.  I couldn't believe my eyes- Disney has come a long way
since starting in a ballroom for Beauty and the Beast.
And the music's not half bad, either.  Fortunately, there's no
ridiculous singing characters here, just a great set of songs by Phil
Collins that perfectly fit the mood.
There's some great action sequences here as well, including a
wonderfully done chase between Tarzan, Jane, and the aforementioned
babboons.  But, of course, it's not all action- there's a message here
as well that has to do with family.
This is easily one of Disney's best animated films of the decade and
it's one I can't wait to put in my home library...that is, if my VCR
still works in the year 2000.

So what is it that makes the new TARZAN so special?
TARZAN, Disney's big, animated, summer movie, has great songs, nearly
perfect casting, and some funny dialog that make it a wonderful choice
for the entire family.  But it is the movie's animation, a technological
tour de force that uses computers to enhance, not replace, traditional
drawings, that almost upstages everything else.
The animators use a new computer technique that the Disney Studios call
"Deep Canvas" to make the background images at once more stunningly
realistic and imaginatively abstract.  Words don't do it justice, but
I'll try.  Picture a foreground with carefully drawn, brightly-colored
characters, one in which you can feel the painstaking work that
animators put into every cel.  That they researched and rethought every
human and animal movement is obvious with their incredible attention to
detail.
These foreground figures are then integrated into a lavish background
that is the picture's piece de resistance.  With equal parts of van Gogh
and Renoir, the lush, fog-shrouded, green-forested jungle looks so
lovely and believable that you want to reach out and touch it, half
expecting that a museum guard will arrest you if you try.
According to the press notes, "Tarzan" is the second most adapted book
ever.  Its 47 adaptations are exceeded only by "Dracula." It also points
out that the author of "Tarzan," Edgar Rice Burroughs, suggested in a
letter to his son way back in 1936 that an animated version might be
best suited to realizing his vision.  His only caveat was that "It must
approximate Disney excellence."  Talk about having your dreams come
true.  How about a movie made by Disney that exceeds even their own high
standards?  Welcome to Disney's breathtaking instantiation of the Tarzan
legend.
Glenn Close, a five-time Oscar nominee, is an acting chameleon, taking
on roles from sexual predators to nurturing mothers.  If you were going
to be raised by an ape mother, Glenn Close would be the type you'd want,
which is exactly what Disney thought, so they cast her as Kala, Tarzan's
adopted ape mother.
As the story opens, Kala loses her ape baby to a tiger.  This same tiger
kills Tarzan's parents, so, much to the chagrin of Kerchak (Lance
Henriksen), the patriarch of her gorilla family, Kala adopts the orphan
Tarzan.
Probably better than any other TARZAN, this version does an extremely
convincing job of giving Tarzan animal characteristics.  It is easy to
get so mesmerized by Tarzan's movements that you lose track of
everything else.  Glen Keane, Disney's star animator (Beast, Aladdin,
Ariel and Pocahontas among others), is the genius behind Tarzan's looks
and movements.  His inspiration came from two unlikely sources, his
teenage son's skateboarding and the old surfer song "Wipe Out."  Keane's
energetic Tarzan doesn't just swing from the vines, he surfs the
branches.  This single piece of inspiration gives Tarzan's movements an
unbounded and joyous spirit that is exciting to watch.
Phil Collins is equally inventive, using a closet full of household
items to create a magical set of jungle rhythms.  With one exception,
the songs are performed, as they were in TOY STORY, not by the
characters but as a backdrop to the action.  This frees Tarzan and the
others to do what they do best without having to stop their action to
break into song.
The casting of the show is particularly inspired.  Tony Goldwyn, as the
adult Tarzan, breathes life and charm into his part without overpowering
it with needless bravado.  (Alex D. Linz plays the younger Tarzan.)  The
scene in which Tarzan mimics Jane is the film's comedic high point.
The bulk of the film's comedic legwork is done by Minnie Driver as Jane
and Rosie O'Donnell as Terk, Tarzan's gorilla pal.  Jane is a proper
young English lady who's an independent free spirit.  The charismatic
Driver is wonderfully appealing as the vulnerable but tough Jane.  Just
as sidesplittingly funny is O'Donnell, who says she always thought of
herself as an ape.  They both steal every scene they are in.  Too bad
they aren't in many scenes together as it would have made for an
interesting comedic contest.
Disney, as it has done from BAMBI to THE LION KING, has dared to
introduce genuine tragedy into a kids' movie.  When the nefarious
Clayton (Brian Blessed) begins to hunt the gorillas, you know that
something bad will happen, and it does.  Life is like that.  But the
story doesn't dwell on it, and the film is the stronger for its
introduction into the storyline.
Tarzan's fast paced, high-spirited high jinks are certain to delight one
and all.  Visually astounding, the film is a mesmerizing treat worthy to
be counted among Disney's best.
TARZAN runs 1:29.  It is rated G.  Although there some moments during
the gorilla hunt that might briefly scare the youngest viewers, the
picture is fine for all ages.
My son Jeffrey, age 10, said he was impressed by Disney's work on the
film and gave it ***.  He liked the way young Tarzan and Terk looked and
thought that they were really cute together.  One of his favorite parts
was the way that they took you into a gorilla's family.  His only
complaint was about the sad part.  His friend Nickolas, also 10, thought
the movie was okay and gave it **.  He said that he liked everything but
the ending.

        He moves with the grace, swiftness, and agility of a mountain lion
stalking its prey.  He delivers a blood-curdling cry that carries for
miles.  He looks like Christopher Lambert.  And every time he pauses for
thought among the lush green vegetation of his jungle home, he's backed by
Phil Collins getting all earnest on us.
        Phil Collins?  After Elton John's contributions to "The Lion King,"
the conspiracy becomes clear: short, paunchy, balding, soft-pop superstars
living out their golden years on Disney royalty checks.
        Collins' occasional caterwauling aside (mercifully he performs only
five new songs), Disney's animated version of the Edgar Rice Burroughs
classic tale about the man raised by apes is not without its engaging
moments.  In fact, it sticks closer to Burroughs' novel than any of the
previous 47 screen variants (with perhaps the exception of "Greystoke: The
Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes" which starred, coincidentally,
Christopher Lambert).  But, animation-wise, it's not the most impressive of
summer releases from the Disney studios.  If nothing else, Tarzan made me
realize that my first impressions of last year's "Mulan" were perhaps a
little harsh.
        Tarzan himself, voiced by Tony Goldwyn (Tony who?), is nevertheless
wonderful in all three presented life stages--infant, juvenile, and
fully-formed, loincloth-sporting muscle man, who whips from tree to tree
faster than a Jedi speeder or "The Little Mermaid."
        As an infant, he's featured in the film's scariest scene (according
to my ten year old), when he tangles with a particularly nasty leopard
(nasty in both senses of the word; this animal has a particularly
badly-drawn head, and it makes one eagerly recall the lithe, sensuous lines
of "The Jungle Book"'s big cats--Bagheera and Shere Khan).  This is where
the soon-to-be-called Tarzan is rescued by a nurturing gorilla called Kala
(voiced by Glenn Close), much to the disapproval of the group's domineering
leader, Kerchak (Lance Henriksen).
        As a juvenile, Tarzan provides the film's funniest scene (according
to my eight year old) when, on a dare, he attempts to retrieve a hair from
the tail of an elephant and is mistaken for a piranha, causing much
consternation and trampling of plant life.
        But there's nothing really new here.  No ballroom scene ("Beauty
and the Beast"), no zebra stampede ("The Lion King"), no charge down a
snowy mountain pass ("Mulan").  Disney's animators appear to have spent
most of their energies devising how fast Tarzan can get around the jungle.
The supporting characters are flimsy at best: the big game hunter; the
bumbling, mustached scientist; and Jane herself (voiced by Minnie Driver in
her best role to date), who single-handedly drags Disney's feminist
advances back a good ten years.
        The obligatory wisecracking sidekicks are replaced here by a
cockatoo-coifed gorilla called Terk (Rosie O'Donnell--say no more) and a
dim-witted baby elephant.  The obligatory pink polka dotted underwear are
also in evidence.
        Unfortunately the best part of Disney's "Tarzan" (according to the
38 year old me) was when the whole disappointing affair came to an end.  If
Disney didn't set such high standards the potential for disappointment
would be undeniably less.

When I first heard that Disney's next animated feature was going to be TARZAN,
I was almost horrified.  I was worried that Disney was going to make another
HERCULES (Sorry, JERK-ULES).  That effort was too overloaded with comedy (and
the hero was too boastful and pompous to be considered a sympathetic hero),
and, after viewing it to this day, I find it a disgrace for Disney animation.
When I saw the trailers, I was thinking "Hmm... This isn't bad at all.  This
just might have potential."
When I bought the soundtrack, I was really quite surprised at how different it
sounded from most Disney features.  I have never really heard of Phil Collins,
nor have I heard of Mark Mancina, so I was wondering, how would these two make
this Disney flick spin?  I was pleasantly surprised:  The music is top-notch. 
Phil Collins' songs are terrific, percussion-heavy pieces of work that seem to
break the formula for typical Disney songs.  The score from Mark Mancina was
also neat; it reminded me a bit of THE LION KING, but it was more original. 
So, the soundtrack wasn't bad at all, considering it was by two people I am not
familiar with.  This film could be good... but will it be?
When I finally went to see it (on opening day, as I tend to do with most
Disney animated features), my question was answered, in a complete turnabout of
expectations for me:  Disney's TARZAN is surprisingly decent.
The story starts out with Tarzan's parents surviving a shipwreck and finding a
home on an island where apes live in peace.  However, one day, a vicious
leopard, Sabor, attacks and kills Tarzan's parents, leaving him (at this
time, a baby) alone-until Kala of the Apes rescues him.
Kala wants to raise the child as her own (she lost hers previously to Sabor),
but her mate, Kerchak is not too sure.  "It's not our kind," he says.  He
agrees, though, to let her take care of little Tarzan, but "that doesn't make
him my son."
Tarzan grows up, vowing to be "the best ape ever", but no matter how hard he
tries or what he does (at the guidance of his hilarious ape friend, Terk), he
just can't convince Kerchak that he is one of the apes, even when he defeats
Sabor in a battle.
One day, a new animal shows up:  humans.  This is where Jane comes into the
picture.  She is on an expedition with her father (Professor Porter), and a
despicable hunter (Clayton) searching for gorillas.  Tarzan rescues her when
she is chased by baboons, and soon they get to know each other.
Even though Tarzan falls in love with Jane, this causes things to go wrong. 
Clayton tricks Tarzan into taking him, Jane, and Porter to see the apes, who
are convinced that he has betrayed them.  Worse, Clayton has plotted to send
the gorillas to London for money.  Will Tarzan find out which family he belongs
to and save the apes?
I'm not gonna tell you, sorry.  You're gonna have to see for yourself.  And
see it you should; the animation is, as always, top notch, particularly when
Tarzan goes soaring through the trees (read that, skateboarding).  The DEEP
CANVAS computer generated effect adds an authentic feeling to the jungle which
Tarzan lives in.  In fact, it seems similar to the computer imagery/cel
animation combination in rival Disney animted films, such as Fox's ANASTASIA
and Dreamworks' PRINCE OF EGYPT.  Could it be that Disney was actually taking
ideas from their rivals?
The casting is fairly good.  Tony Goldwyn is emotionally believeable as Tarzan
(and to my relief, the animators have succeeded in not making him another
Hercules.  Nicely done), and Glenn Close is wonderful as Kala (She has a
beautiful singing voice, too, by the way).  Lance Henrikson as Kerchak somewhat
reminds me of Robby Benson's Beast voice, which makes him all the more
ferocious and gripping.  Minnie Driver had me a little worried at first as the
voice of Jane.  I thought she had the most annoying voice in the whole film
(when I first saw the trailers), but when I saw the film, I didn't have a
problem with her.  I take back my insult on Driver.  It's nice to hear Nigel
Hawthorne do another voice for a Disney animated feature (He was Fflewdurr
Flamm in Disney's most underrated classic, THE BLACK CAULDRON); he is funny and
delightful as Professor Porter.  On the villiany side of the voices, Brian
Blessed (the guy who did Boss Nass in STAR WARS:  EPISODE I-THE PHANTOM MENACE)
brings a pompous, and later on vicious, voice to the sinister Clayton.  He
might not be the strongest character in the film (he's just a plain bad guy,
nothing else), but Blessed's vocal work contributes greatly.
But if there is any voice that I think steals the whole show, it should be
Rosie O'Donnell, who is hilariously funny as Terk.  She also has a fiesty
attitude ("I'm gonna kill ya!" she says, more than once).  I almost sung along
with her during one of the film's best moments, where the apes make a mess of
the human's camp, via song, er, scatting "Shoo-be-doo, da-be-dah".  I can see
why she wanted to have a rock song for the film, she's a good singer.
Not that she was the only funny character in the film, though.  Wayne Knight
(who played Stan in SPACE JAM) gives a whimsically funny style to Tantor, an
elephant who is especially worried about stepping into "un-sanitary" water. 
(Thankfully, there is no real sound of flatuence-That would have killed the
picture).
The songs, as I said before, are decent, mostly sung by Collins.  This sets a
new standard for Disney animated films because for the first time, the
characters do NOT sing.  I tolerate musical numbers from characters a lot more
than some other guys would, but I found this to be a nice change of pace.
The story does have elements of comedy in it, but they also load it with
strong dramatic touches, which makes this film far better than the
unbelieveably uninspired HERCULES.
If there is anything disappointing about TARZAN, it might be the omission of
the 'N Sync version of "Trashing The Camp" from the film.  I heard it on the
soundtrack, and wondered where it was going to be.  I was upset that it wasn't,
because I had thought of taking a few friends of mine who like 'N Sync to see
TARZAN.  Oh, well...
Overall, I was enthralled with TARZAN.  I wouldn't hold it high the way I do
with MULAN or THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME (my all-time favorite Disney
classics), but this film deserves a high place among Disney's greatest
achievements.  I give a nod to Disney for following up their spectacular *****
masterpiece, MULAN, with this great animated adaption of Egar Rice Burrough's
TARZAN.

"Tarzan" swings onto the screen with the power and grace of a charging
cheetah. The story of a lost infant in an African jungle is told richly with
music (Phil Collins) and colorful images. Kala, a female gorilla finds the
human baby and saves him from Sabor, the leopard. "I shall call him Tarzan"
she tells her un-approving dominant male, Kerchak. Terk, a young ape
retorts, "Tarzan? Okay, it's you're baby."
Tarzan and Terk become best friends as they grow into their teens.
You know the rest, British anthropologists, Professor Porter and daughter
Jane, come to observe while their bodyguard, Clayton, upsets the jungle
paradise.
Surprisingly, this is an action film! In one amazing scene, Tarzan rescues
Jane from an aerial stampede of perturbed baboons. Tarzan not only swings
with the greatest of ease, but literally "surfs" the mossy tree trunks that
wind like waves high above the jungle. This may just be the fastest paced
animated sequence ever produced -- easily rivaling the "Star Wars" pod race
in the exciting speed department.
Perhaps its only imperfection, the film puckers out a bit short of the home
stretch. But that lull won't stop me from heartily recommending this wild
action comedy to kids and adults of all ages. Go see it!

TARZAN ** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers ( tarzan@filmfreakcentral.net )
starring the voices of Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver, Glenn Close, Brian
Blessed
screenplay by Tab Murphy, Bob Tzudiker, Noni White,
based on 'Tarzan Of The Apes" by Edgar Rice Burroughs
directed by Chris Buck and Kevin Lima
Parody him, give him a syndicated television series, put a tuxedo on
him, it doesn't matter: to paraphrase Led  Zeppelin, Tarzan remains
the same; he's a simplistic tribute to primeval man. The basic story
of a baby abandoned in the jungle who is raised by apes has been
filmed more times than any other, if only because Burrough's book is
in the public domain. Now that Disney has appropriated the character
for use in its annual summer cartoon, I'm not even sure I can type
"Tarzan" without the Registered Trademark symbol. And just because
they've animated him doesn't mean they've liberated him: Disney's
swift, agile Tarzan is, personality-wise, as yawn inducing as previous
incarnations. The movie itself is an uneasy hybrid of conflicting
formulas. 
Tarzan commences with a rousing sequence that depicts the parallel
lives of Tarzan's parents and parents-to-be. Shipwrecked, Tarzan's
human mother and father build a treehouse, and successfully tend to
their baby until disaster strikes in the form of a hungry leopard.
Kala (Close), a mother gorilla whose new child was similarly devoured,
discovers Tarzan squirming in a cradle and adopts him instantly; her
husband,  Kerchak (Lance Henriksen), refuses to acknowledge the boy as
a son based solely on his human appearance. The years pass, and Tarzan
learns to negotiate the forest like his ape protectors. Then he
encounters Jane (Driver), who is on expedition with her father and a
big game hunter named Clayton (Blessed); they are three people who
look more like him than anyone else in the jungle, so he suffers a
brief but potent crisis of identity. 
Two gaping plot holes occurred to me as I watched Tarzan '99. First,
let me establish that Tarzan and his primate friends speak English for
our sake, but it's understood that they're babbling variations of
"Oo-oo-ee-ee-ah-ah" to each other. So why is Tarzan able to introduce
himself to Jane as "Tarzan"? 
Then there's the issue of Clayton. Everybody's inexplicably surprised
when he betrays his escorts and sets trap for the gorillas. If the
Snidely Whiplash-moustache and double-barreled shotgun were not clues
enough, surely the fact that he excitedly asked Tarzan over and over
again "Where are the gorillas?" was a bold sign that he had ulterior
motives for being in Africa. 
The film rehashes the The Lion King's irritating time-compression
technique: Tarzan's formative years are skipped entirely with a lap
dissolve of preteen Tarzan to adult Tarzan-the film misses its only
opportunity to be innovative by dismissing his maturation. What would
adolescence be like for Tarzan? If one was raised by apes, would(n't)
one develop a sexual attraction to some of them? The film hints at a
burgeoning romance between Tarzan and Turk, a girlla, that is
interrupted by the arrival of Jane, but if Turk has more than platonic
feelings, they remain as subtext. 
Such depth, not to mention a beastiality subplot, would be out of
place in a Disney film, anyway. After said opening, Tarzan goes bland.
(This includes Phil Collins' song score, which is elevator music for
the wild.) It answers questions of racism and gun control with a big
smiley face. It preaches against poaching only slightly more
effectively than last year's lame remake of Mighty Joe Young. It
provides unnecessary, obnoxious sidekicks for our hero in the form of
the aforementioned Turk (Rosie O'Donnell in a grating vocal
performance) and an aw-shucks elephant named Tantor (Wayne Knight). It
offers not a single moment of surprise in its climax. None of this
quite meshes with the conventions of Burrough's Tarzan tales-I can't
determine which recipe has been shoehorned into the other. (Does it
occur to children weaned on the new Disney movies that they're
watching the same story over and over again? Pocahontas, Mulan, and
Tarzan fit into the same rigid paradigm, yet they're respectively
based on an American legend, Chinese folklore, and a beloved modern
mythology.) 
One aspect of this Tarzan does enthrall. I'm talking about its
resplendent design, of course, a seamless blend of digital and
traditional animation techniques-the two are most complementary during
the "Deep Canvas" action scenes, which will undoubtedly be diminished
on the small screen. (They are perhaps reason enough to see Tarzan at
the cinema.) Tarzan soars through the trees like a surfer coasting on
an imaginary wave (indeed, his liquid movements were modeled after one
animator's skateboarding kid). If only he defied our expectations as
well as gravity.

"You'll go ape over TARZAN because it's more fun than a barrel of
monkeys!"  Okay, there's the quote in case Disney wants to put
something in their ads for the movie.
Disney's latest animated feature throws us right into the action from
the very beginning, skipping the usual main title sequence and putting
us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a
sinking ship.  Father, mother, and infant somehow make it to shore
amidst a rousing song by Phil Collins, and have soon built a treehouse
which would impress the Swiss Family Robinson.  It's amazing, the
kinds of things you can do when you work to a soundtrack.  Before you
know it, an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands
of Kala (Glenn Close), a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to
a predatory leopard.  Against the wishes of her mate and family
leader, Kerchak (Lance Henricksen), she takes on the infant boy as her
own.
TARZAN is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the
African jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either
humanity or the wild. Much of Tarzan's young life is spent trying to
become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his "father,"
which occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how well-meant his
attempts.  All he's looking for is acceptance, perhaps a goal easily
identifiable by young viewers, but one which will ring true with a lot
of adults.  When you really think about it, this story fits right into
the Disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end.  Look back
on past Disney animated features and you'll see the trend.
Growing up, Tarzan (voiced by Alex D. Linz as a child, and by Tony
Goldwyn as an adult) has a couple of friends.  One is an ape named
Terk (Rosie O'Donnell), and the other is a paranoid hypochondriac of
an elephant named Tantor (Wayne Knight).  Both provide the requisite
comic relief (Timon and Poombah from THE LION KING immediately come to
mind) and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the Disney mold.
I'm beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one of
these films.  Just fill in the blanks!  Can you see it?  "Now we have
to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into
mischief, but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it.
We've already had a fish and a crab, and we've had a candle and a
teapot, a genie and a dog, a few stone statues....have we had an ape
and an elephant yet?  Well, there we go!"
Of course, there's gotta be romance somewhere along the line, so Jane
(Minnie Driver) gets introduced about halfway through.  Together with
her father Dr. Porter (Nigel Hawthorne) and the big game hunter
Clayton (Brian Blessed), Jane is on an expedition to find and study
the wild gorillas of Africa.  She discovers the man raised by apes and
is enchanted almost immediately, and soon shares an amusing version of
the compulsory "You Tarzan, Me Jane" scene.  Thankfully, those aren't
the exact words.  However, I found it distracting that Tarzan is going
"ohh ohh ee ee" one second and then tells Jane his name in this manly
voice with perfect diction.  How does he tell his name to another ape?
"Ohh ohh ee - Tarzan - ee ee ohh?"  Well, regardless of my picky
nature, the romance actually works as only Disney romance can:  Purely
contrived, but for some reason rather believable.  But hey, Tarzan's a
young adult.  Do you think he dated a few of the female apes before
meeting Jane?  Isn't that illegal in most countries?  Oh, well.  I
don't think Disney will be using my quote anymore.
TARZAN departs from the usual Disney feature in that this one is not a
musical.  There's lots of music to be sure, but not a single character
song in the whole hour and a half of running time.  We instead get
more of a Phil Collins concert, as no less than five of his original
songs are used as interlude material.  This isn't really a bad thing,
as the songs are very high-energy and catchy (I found myself singing
one to myself for most of the following day); it's just different.  Do
yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound
system, because the music will come through astonishingly well and
really enhance the movie.
With each new feature, Disney animation gets even better.  Not
necessarily by leaps and bounds, but since they put out a new film
each year, a steady rate of improvement is apparent, and this
definitely shows in TARZAN.  There are a couple of scenes where the
animation achieves a near 3-D effect, and a number of scenes which
feature Tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying.  The
way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of
skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers, and had me thinking this
isn't just Tarzan, it's "Extreme Tarzan."  However, TARZAN does not
seem to have what I call its "chandelier scene," which is the one
scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate
amount of effort, utilizing a computer-assisted process that makes the
animation absolutely breathtaking.  Lasting but a few seconds at most,
it's been the signature of nearly every Disney animated feature since
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, in which the castle ballroom chandelier was
rendered in stunning detail.
As usual, the voice talent is up to snuff, convincingly make you
believe in the convictions of animated characters.  The one poor
choice in casting, however, was Rosie O'Donnell.  Going into the film,
I didn't know she was even a part of it, but when Terk started
talking, I recognized her voice immediately.  Her performance was
fine, but through the rest of the film I kept thinking, "That's no boy
ape, that Rosie O'Donnell."  Distracting to say the least.
I'll admit I've never read the Edgar Rice Burroughs story "Tarzan of
the Apes," so I couldn't tell you how true this film stays to the
book.  But unless you're a purist, you should have few objections to
this film.  With solid performances, action, adventure, a bit of
romance, and great music and animation, TARZAN should appeal to the
kids and to the kid in all of us.
Note:  When I wrote my review of MULAN a year ago, I went off on the
promotional and merchandising tie-ins prevalent with the release of a
Disney animated feature.  This time, I'll just say that I went to
McDonald's yesterday to treat myself to a McFlurry, and Tarzan was on
the cup.  'Nuff said.

Starring: the voices of Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver, Rosie O'Donnel, Glenn
Close, Lance Henriksen, and Wayne Knight
Synopsis: 
Orphaned as an infant when his parents died in the African jungle, Tarzan
(voice of Tony Goldwyn) is adopted by the she-ape Kala (voice of Glenn
Close) and raised among apes as her surrogate son. Tarzan becomes adept at
jungle skills, but because of his obvious differences he is not quite
accepted as an ape by his adopted father Kerchak (voice of Lance Henrikson)
and others. When Tarzan stumbles across friendly zoologists Jane Porter
(voice of Minnie Driver) and her father as well as evil poachers he must
decide between his ape responsibilities and the lure of becoming human.
Rosie O'Donnel offers comic relief as Tarzan's buddy Terk, a gorilla with a
New York accent.
Opinion:
This animated gem puts an interesting spin the tale of Edgar Rice
Burroughs' Tarzan of the Apes, this time painting a story about earning
acceptance. 
Adults will enjoy watch this version of Tarzan because he's not a wimpy,
passive, politically correct hero. With knife in hand, young Tarzan goes
one on one with a killer leopard and roars the Tarzan victory cry. And when
he gets trapped in the hold of a ship, he gets a crazed look in his eye and
begins to exhibit the wildness and claustrophobia of a cornered animal. 
On the other hand, children will LOVE this flick because it tells the tale
from a kid's point of view. Here's this young kid Tarzan growing up
slightly hyperactive, trying to come to grips with himself while surrounded
by big adult figures approving and disapproving, encouraging and
discouraging. He surfs down winding branches and careens through the trees
like a monkey to the tune of rhythmic pop music. He faces down danger or
runs away from it. He has exciting adventures and sticks to his values. He
finds his way.
Take the whole family. This one's worth it.

Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.
     The opening ten minutes of Disney's TARZAN represent as gripping and
mature an example of animated film-making as I've ever seen.  Underscored
by the urgent rhythms of the Phil Collins song "Two Worlds," the sequence
depicts two families in Africa: a human couple and their infant son trying
to rebuild their lives after being shipwrecked, and a pair of gorillas
with their own new baby before a leopard attack takes the young ape's
life.  Shortly thereafter, the grieving gorilla mother Kala discovers the
orphaned human baby -- its parents also slain by the leopard -- alone in
the wreckage of their shelter.  Only after another close call with the
leopard can Kala (voiced by Glenn Close) bring the baby boy into the
gorilla community, much to the dismay of her mate Kerchak (Lance
Henriksen).
     That dark, dazzling prologue works not only on its own dramatic
terms, but also at shifting expectations -- perhaps TARZAN could stand on
its own as more than re-cycled motifs from THE JUNGLE BOOK and THE LION
KING.  The story eventually presents the adult Tarzan (Tony Goldwyn) with
a Simba vs. Mowgli dilemma.  After spending his entire life trying to
convince Kerchak that he belongs with the gorillas, Tarzan encounters
other humans for the first time:  slightly dotty ape researcher Professor
Porter (Nigel Hawthorne); Clayton (Brian Blessed), Porter's jungle guide
with an ulterior motive; and, of course, Porter's feisty daughter Jane
(Minnie Driver).  When romance blooms between Tarzan and Jane, the ape man
faces a choice between returning to the society of humans and staying as
defender of his ape family.
     TARZAN continues Disney's impressive streak in recent years of
incorporating more serious themes into its animated features.  There are
moments when it's easy to forget you're watching a film marketed at kids,
from the effective interpersonal moments (energized by Driver's charming
vocal performance) to the twist on the obligatory musical numbers that
turns most of them into transitional bridges.  The animation itself feels
more grown-up, even when the flashy "Deep Canvas" technology turns a trek
through the trees into a ready-made theme park ride.  Where its animated
features are concerned -- and its live-action kid flicks, notoriously, are
not -- it's clear Disney genuinely cares about creating complete, resonant
stories.
     It's also clear that Disney cares plenty about making sure the cash
cow isn't cut just for the prime rib audience.  There are Kids' Club
burgers to be sold as well, which means comic relief that's a relief only
when it goes away.  Sucking up valuable screen time are two pals for
Tarzan, his spirited cousin Terk (Rosie O'Donnell) and nervous elephant
Tantor (Wayne Knight).  Both characters, plush-toy cute though they may
be, feel like tacked-on creations contributing a slapstick silliness the
story just doesn't need; the pointless show-stopper "Trashin' the Camp" in
particular  seems to belong in another film entierly.  Even the nasty
Clayton is out of place, adding an external conflict only because
tradition has dictated it.  There's nothing wrong with Disney making
purely amusing kiddie fare like HERCULES and ALADDIN.  There's also
nothing wrong with letting the deeper stories be deep.
     The issue isn't whether TARZAN should have been plodding and somber,
because it's clear that the core narrative could provide all the
entertainment a viewer of any age could want.  There's plenty of humor in
the interactions between Tarzan and Jane, and plenty of adventure in
Tarzan's various encounters with jungle beasts.  TARZAN is a solid film,
stronger in its basic filmmaking elements than most wide-release films,
but it might have been a spectacular one instead.  Disney will never go
broke relying on the successful Disney animated formula, and they'll
continue to turn out largely enjoyable family films.  They'll also have
trouble breaking free to make a stirring, utterly unique animated film,
one that fulfills the potential of TARZAN's magnificent first ten minutes.

** (out of 4) I went to TARZAN hoping to hate it. I am generally cynical
about Disney movies, and I hoped I could pull a "Mr. Cranky."
I still won't say I liked TARZAN, but I liked parts of it, and on the
whole I couldn't really fault it, given the genre. But it never wowed me
and won me over. I never felt sheepish for having doubted Disney, as I
did with A BUG'S LIFE.
Plotwise, TARZAN is a fairly traditional retelling. A shipwrecked couple
are killed and their infant son is adopted by gorillas. The boy grows up
never knowing why he looks different from his friends, never knowing
about human beings.
One day, after Tarzan (voiced by Tony Goldwyn) has grown, he hears a
loud bang in the distance. It is a party of people. A ridiculous-looking
naturalist (Nigel Hawthorne), his daughter Jane (Minnie Driver), and
their trophy-hunting bodyguard Clayton (Brian Blessed) are looking for
gorillas.  
After their first encounter, Tarzan and Jane start hanging around
together (ouch, sorry). Meanwhile, the goofy professor Porter and the
slippery villain try to get Tarzan to say where the gorilla nesting site
is, the prof so he can study them, the bodyguard so he can cage them and
sell them.
As with other recent Disney cartoons, this one is a musical. Phil
Collins belts out the pop hits over montages of Tarzan "skating" down
tree branches. (The music is always over a montage because the cast
members don't perform their own songs. For example, Tarzan's "mother"
starts the first few bars of a lullaby, then Collins takes over the
soundtrack and the visuals shift into MTV mode.) None of the songs are
too saccharine, and there's even one that's fairly catchy -- "Trashing
the Camp."
Another trademark of Disney cartoons is that they always manage to top
themselves when it comes to technical innovation. First it was the
spinning ballroom shot in BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. Then it was the focus
pulls on THE LION KING. In TARZAN, the trick is "hand-held" camera.
Early in the film a leopard is chasing Tarzan's adoptive mother. The
scene happens very quickly anyway, and the "camera" hops around trying
to follow the action as though the virtual camera operator had legs.
(The same technique is repeated later in the movie.) So why create this
effect? Because they can? Because it hasn't been done before? To get
film nerds like me to say "whoa"? Whatever the reason, it's a neat
gimmick, even if it's gratuitous.
That brings me to a fairly big complaint about the movie. Because of the
animators' acute technophilia, TARZAN is stylistically incoherent.
Technical innovation may be neat, but that alone shouldn't be reason
enough to include it in a movie.
The characters in TARZAN are all traditional-looking animated creatures.
They could have been drawn for THE JUNGLE BOOK forty years ago. But the
setting they inhabit has become hyperrealistic. With computer-modeled
jungles, rivers, sunlight and shadows, it has become hard to tell for
sure where the cartoon ends and "reality" begins -- until you change
your focus to the cartoon apes in the foreground.
This inconsistency is a stylistic mistake. It keeps the audience from
understanding and getting into the animated world. The characters and
settings ARE animated separately, but they shouldn't look that way. Even
assuming there were a good reason to mix two such disparate styles,
Professor Porter's character introduces a third style that's even
further out of place.
Set in the "real" jungle, Tarzan was animated with sharp, heroic lines,
as was Jane. Clayton's figure was a bit more exaggerated, but as the
villain, it was excusable. But professor Porter's form was neither
realistic nor heroic. He was so flat, round, silly, and, well,
cartoonish, that he would have fit in better with Mickey Mouse and
Donald Duck. Each style might work on its own, but to ignore how they
integrate is a mistake.
I have one more complaint, and to discuss it, I'll have to give away the
ending. (That's okay, though. If you're familiar with the Disney
formula, you already know what the ending is.) 
The kid-movie justice system is insane.
My sister said it best: her daughter was telling her about a movie that
had a happy ending because the bad guy died at the end. Later, to me, my
sister was incredulous. "It's a HAPPY ending because someone you don't
like is DEAD? What kind of message is that?"
Having observed this childish system of justice in movies ranging from
TARZAN and A BUG'S LIFE (rated G) to CON AIR and THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE
CRADLE (rated R), I've discovered a few other "rules." The good guys
never do their own dirty work. The bad guy always dies because of his
fatal flaw, usually greed, rabid perseverence, and/or pure, inhuman
evilness. The more gruesome, sudden, and irreversible the death, the
better. The Greeks had DEUS EX MACHINA endings. We have MORTIS EX
FORMULA endings.
Ideally, we'd be teaching our kids to outwit their oppressors, not to
hope for luck to bring their deaths. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen
very often in movies. (A noteworthy exception is last year's "Ever
After," which I strongly recommend.) No wonder we are a nation in love
with the death penalty, where bad guys die without the rest of us
getting blood on our hands.
Back to TARZAN, I'm probably being too hard on this movie, when my real
complaint is with the formula. Still, I wouldn't say I liked it, and I'd
even go so far as to say that it doesn't quite measure up to other
Disney offerings. I'm sure those of you with younger kids would enjoy an
afternoon at TARZAN. But the rest of us could probably skip it.

 Tarzan (1999) 4 stars out of 4. Featuring the voices of Tony Goldwyn,
Minnie Driver, Glenn Close, Lance Henriksen, Rosie O'Donnell, Wayne Knight
and Brian Blessed.
 "Tarzan," Disney's latest animation feature, is a visual delight that will
leave you breathless as you soar through the primordial jungle with the
legendary ape man.
 Using a process called Deep Canvas, the Disney animators have created an
Edenesque landscape in which Tarzan swoops, glides and soars. Edgar Rice
Burroughs' famed creation no longer swings through the trees like a trapeze
artist; rather, he skates and surfs the boughs and branches as if they were
green waves. He has been transformed into the "Big Kahuna" of the forest.
 "Tarzan" is Disney's most thoughtful and satisfying animated feature since
"The Lion King." Keeping merely the basic premise of Burroughs' original -
a husband, wife and baby are marooned off the African coast, the parents
are killed and the baby is adopted by a female ape who raises him to
manhood - the story becomes a quest for identity.
 And that is the genius of this adaptation. The character of Tarzan has
been brought to the screen nearly 50 times since 1918, yet only one movie -
Hugh Hudson's plodding "Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes"
- has even come close to hinting at the conflict within Burroughs hero.
 And yet, this was a theme Burroughs touched upon in most of the 24 books
chronicling the adventures of Tarzan.
 One of the most outstanding factors of Disney's "Tarzan" is the editing,
an aspect usually overlooked in animated films.
 The opening sequence, paralleling the stranding of Tarzan's family with
the family life of the she-ape Kala and her mate, Kerchak, leading up to
the killing of Kala's baby by a leopard and the death of baby Tarzan's
parents by that same big cat is inspired.
 The entire episode is played out over the song "Two Worlds," sung by Phil
Collins.
 It is one of the four songs written and performed by the pop star, whose
vocal and composing talents are one of the film's finest contributions.
 Not enough can be said about the character animators. For nearly the first
half of the film Tarzan moves on the balls of his toes and his knuckles -
apelike.
 It is not until he meets Jane and begins to realize why he is different
from the other apes that he adopt an upright stance.
 And that is the crux of the story. Tarzan is the outsider, the outcast.
Despite the love and protection of Kala and the friendship of the
smart-mouthed ape, Terk, and the neurotic elephant, Tantor, Tarzan can
never truly feel like a full-fledged member of the ape tribe.
 It is the discovery of people, a safari led by the evil Greystoke that
ignites the spark of humanity in Tarzan's breast.
 With the help of Jane and her scientist father, Tarzan learns about man
and the outside world.
 Usually in the Tarzan movies, Jane must rely on the strength and courage
of Tarzan for her protection. This animated Jane, though, has spunk - and a
sense of humor. As voiced by the wonderful Minnie Driver, Jane is
quick-witted, intelligent, curious and fearless.
 She is the perfect complement to Tarzan.
 As Tarzan, Tony Goldwyn (best known as the villain in "Ghost" as well as
the director of "A Walk on the Moon") modulates his voice to show the angst
and conflict within his character. When Kala advises him to create his own
roar and not copy that of the tribe, Goldwyn's Tarzan does not use a Johnny
Weissmuller-like yodel, but a deep, freeing sound that comes from his
heart.
 Goldwyn is able to convey Tarzan's vulnerability as well as his strength
and determination.
 Glenn Close is wise and loving as Kala, while Lance Henriksen ("Aliens,"
TV's "Millennium") is gruff, suspicious and ferocious as Kerchak.
 The comedy relief is supplied by Rosie O'Donnell as the wise-cracking Terk
and Wayne Knight as the meek Tantor.
 Brian Blessed provides the right tone of suave villainy as Greystoke,
while Nigel Hawthorne is funny and warmly befuddled as the absent-minded
Professor Porter, Jane's father.
 Also interesting to note is the way the animators created Kerchak and
Greystoke.
 Structurally, they are almost mirror images of each other. This adds a
dimension to Tarzan's struggle of finding his true self as he watches these
two male role models.
 Directors Kevin Lima and Chris Buck have created a movie that again raises
the bar for Disney animation. And in the process they also have made one of
the finest Tarzan movies in the entire ape man canon.
 "Tarzan" is a must-see, 88 minutes of color, adventure, suspense, humor
and romance. It is one of the best movies of the year. Don't miss it.

TARZAN (PG).  
(Disney/Buena Vista International)

Henriksen, Wayne Knight, Rosie O'Donnell, Alex D Linz, Jim Cummings.
Along with Dracula and Sherlock Holmes, Edgar Rice Burroughs'
Tarzan is one of the most filmed of all fictitious literary
characters, with nearly 50 films and tv series exploring the
adventures of the legendary loin-clothed jungle hero.  However, more
recent versions have ventured further away from the spirit of
Burroughs' novels, and the character seems to have lost much of its
appeal.
This ambitious Disney feature is the first animated film to
depict the adventures of Tarzan, and remains fairly faithful to
Burroughs' original vision.  Tarzan easily lends itself to the Disney
style of family oriented animation, and this is one of their better
features of recent years.  Tarzan took three years to make, and as
expected, the animation is superb.  With sophisticated computer
generated animation techniques, the jungle has been superbly brought
to life.  Animation also allows our hero to swing through the jungle
with a fluidity not permitted in live action filming, which provides
some exciting action sequences.
The narrative itself traces Tarzan's origins.  Following a
ship wreck, the baby Tarzan and his family are left stranded in a
jungle wilderness.  When a leopard kills his parents, the orphaned
Tarzan is adopted by the gorilla Kala (Glenn Close) and Kerchak
(Millennium's Lance Henriksen), who have lost their own child and
raise the boy as their own.  As he grows, the only family that Tarzan
knows are the wild animals.
The arrival of the beautiful Jane (Minnie Driver) and her
anthropologist father Professor Porter (Nigel Hawthorne) raises
strange feelings that Tarzan has to deal with.  The film follows the
dilemma that Tarzan faces as he is torn between two cultures.
Although the Porters have come to study the gorillas in their natural
habitat, their guide Clayton (Brian Blessed) has other ideas.  Tarzan
has to fight to defend his adopted family from the cruel intentions of
poachers.
Thankfully, unlike most Disney films, the characters here
don't burst into bland songs every other scene.  Former Genesis
drummer and singer Phil Collins provides an appropriately primitive
sounding percussion-driven score, and five new songs, which seem to
propel the narrative along.  Typically, a strong vocal cast has been
assembled.  Alex D Linz (Home Alone 3) provides the voice of the young
Tarzan, while Tony Goldwyn (Ghost, etc) voices the adult Tarzan.
Driver once again proves that she does a superb British accent and
makes for an appealing and feisty Jane.
This is the second time Close has loaned her voice to a Tarzan
film, having previously redubbed Andie McDowell's voice for Hugh
Hudson's Greystoke all those years ago.  Wayne Knight and Rosie
O'Donnell bring humour to the film as Tarzan's animal pals Tantor, a
neurotic and accident prone elephant, and Terk, the wise cracking ape.
The whole concept easily lends itself to cute animal antics
that will appeal to younger audiences, and the producers have taken
full advantage of the opportunities.  The highlight is when the
animals invade the Porters' camp and stage an impromptu orchestra.
This easy going and enjoyable enough film will inevitably invite
comparisons with Disney's 1967 classic animated adaptation of The
Jungle Book, with which it shares a number of superficial
similarities.  However, in terms of both story telling and standard of
computer generated animation, this '90's version is far more
sophisticated.
For many, Beauty And The Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King
represent the peak of Disney's recent achievements in animation.
Tarzan is not quite in the same league, lacking the irreverent humour,
sly in-jokes and winning style.  However, there is more than enough
humour and action to please both adults as well as children, and this
film should be a big hit during the holiday season.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Disney's annual summer animation extravaganza begins promisingly 
there's no annoying Mickey Mouse cartoon and about ten minutes of
fantastic-looking action with no dialogue or song.  But it can't keep up
the pace and it fails to generate the laughs that adults have enjoyed in
Disney's past two summer hits, Mulan and Hercules.
Don't get me wrong  it's certainly not a bad film.  Disney and
screenwriter Tab Murphy (The Hunchback of Notre Dame) do an admirable
job of adapting the classic Edgar Rice Burroughs novel.  The script
pulls no punches and might actually be a bit jarring and melancholy for
the youngsters.  And old-timers beware - this ain't your father's
Tarzan.  The loin-clothed wonder not only swings from vines, but also
surfs down tree trunks like those bastard kids that rollerblade down the
handrails in front of the post office.
The infant Tarzan (voiced by Alex D. Linz, Home Alone 3) and his parents
land on a deserted island after narrowly escaping death on a flaming
ship.  They quickly build a remarkable treehouse (a la Swiss Family
Robinson) and seem fairly content spending their lives in their remote
surroundings.  But one day, a bloodthirsty leopard slays both parents,
leaving the tot to be discovered by Kala (Glenn Close, 101 Dalmatians),
a gorilla that ironically lost her only child to the same deadly feline.
When Kala brings the human child home to the tight-knit gorilla
community, she is met with great resistance  especially from her
husband and primate leader, Kerchak (Lance Henriksen, Millenium).  The
boy grows up feeling like an outcast, but is able to befriend a
similarly aged gorilla named Terk (annoyingly voiced by nasally K-Mart
pitch-person and media whore Rosie O'Donnell) and a bumbling elephant,
Tantor (Wayne Knight, Seinfeld's Newman).
Years later, an older and more chiseled Tarzan (Tony Goldwyn, Kiss the
Girls) turns everything around when he saves Kerchak's life after the
savage leopard attacks the patriarchal figure.  In an instant, Tarzan
becomes a man, unknowingly avenges the death of his birth parents, wins
the affection of Kerchak and develops his trademark yell.  But the
excitement doesn't stop there.  Almost immediately after dispatching the
deadly leopard, the jungle is jolted by the sound of gunfire.  There are
visitors on the island!
Of course, the visitors include Jane (Minnie Driver, An Ideal Husband),
the girl who would be Mrs. Tarzan.  Almost instantly, she strays from
her three-party group  father Porter (Nigel Hawthorne, The Winslow Boy)
and trigger-happy bad guy Clayton (Brian Blessed, Boss Nass in Episode
One)  and quickly finds herself being chased by a bunch of angry
baboons.  Tarzan saves her and realizes that Jane is more like him than
his monkey brethren.
Having not been trained in human social skills, Tarzan shocks Jane by
first mimicking her and then violating her `personal boundaries' by
looking up her dress and jamming his head between her perky Disney
breasts.  Needless to say, the two hit it off and Tarzan even considers
leaving the island to return home with Jane.  If she had simply put out,
he probably would have gone with her, leaving the film with a completely
different ending.
Tarzan was directed by Chris Buck (his debut) and Kevin Lima (A Goofy
Movie) and features new music from former Genesis frontman Phil
Collins.  His songs replace the big, flashy musical numbers that usually
plague Disney toons, leaving precious little time to develop any
semblance of a story.  But that isn't the case here  the absence of
singing characters is welcomed in any film.  (1:30  Rated G, but
contains some seriously depressing and violent scenes)

     Disney Studios seems to love the concept of feral children.  They
have made three films from Rudyard Kipling's THE JUNGLE BOOK.  Now they
are starting in on Tarzan, Edgar Rice Burroughs's even more popular
character originally inspired by the Mowgli tales.  And with luck,
starting is all they will do.  Tarzan would be a good choice for Disney
studios since Disney never feels particularly obligated to be faithful
to the source material.  After all, why bother?  Their version will be
the canonical one after it is released anyway, right?  But Burroughs
fans are used to disappointment.  With all the many theatrical film
versions of Tarzan almost none have been accurate to the Burroughs
conception. Until the Disney version the original 1918 film version of
TARZAN OF THE APES and the first half of GREYSTOKE: THE LEGEND OF
TARZAN, LORD OF THE APES are the only films that even look at where
Tarzan came from and how he got to be Tarzan. The rest just assumed
there was this man in the jungle.
     In the new Disney animated version we begin with a mother, father,
and baby escaping from a burning ship and trying to survive ashore in
equatorial Africa. (In the book they were Alice and John Clayton, but
the name Clayton is used in this film for the villain.)  At about the
same time the she-gorilla Kala (voiced by Glenn Close) lost her own
baby to Sabor the fierce leopard who holds Kala's tribe in fear.  The
grieving Kala hears the cry of a human baby and finds a tree house
destroyed by Sabor, and in it a dead man and woman, and their still-
living baby.  Over the objection of her mate Kerchak (Lance Henrickson)
and the disapproval of the other apes Kala adopts the baby, naming him
Tarzan.  Tarzan (Alex D. Linz as a boy and Tony Goldwyn as a man) grows
up an outsider with an androgynous friend Terk (Rosie O'Donnell who
brings entirely too much Rosie O'Donnell humor to the film).  Tarzan
struggles to win the approval of Kerchak, but Kerchak is a bigot who is
not ready to accept a human into his family. (Yes, there are many
politically-correct lessons in the course of the film.) Eventually
Tarzan meets humans who come in an expedition to find gorillas.  The
expedition is made up of Professor Porter (Nigel Hawthorne), his
daughter Jane (Minnie Driver), and guide Clayton (Brian Blessed).  Of
course, the expected love story is told one more time.
     I cannot think what Disney's studios could have done to so
alienate Hans Zimmer that he would leave them in the lurch when they so
desperately needed him. Zimmer, who scored films like THE LION KING,
has a feel for the sound of African music.  He could have done a
beautiful score for TARZAN.  Instead we have a collection of totally
obnoxious songs by Phil Collins.  Mark Mancina's music harmlessly fills
in the spaces.  On the other hand, the animation is little short of
wonderful with odd stylistic touches that mix flat animation with some
impressive three-dimensional animation.  In Disney's new tradition, a
different team animates each of the major characters.  One advantage of
this, I suppose is a lot more people can be working in parallel on a
single scene, yet a single character is consistently animated through
the entire film.  Some parts of the screen may look like traditional
flat animation; others will seem to be almost filmed as live-action.
It could be bothersome having more than one animation techniques in a
single scene, but it really is not.  The one animation problem is that
the words do not really fit the characters' lips well.
     Several problems with the script and its visualization show how
this film talks down to its audience.  We see Tarzan skid over tree-
limbs with obvious skate-boarding motions.  And the tree limbs would
have to be thirty feet long or more for the time he spends on each
limb.  And where in the world are there so many major waterfalls in
such close proximity?  We know immediately that Clayton is a villain
because he is so ugly.  Just once it would be nice to have an
attractive villain and an ugly hero.  (Lookism apparently continues to
be exempt from the Disney agenda.)  How likely is it that the
expedition has brought a magic lantern and a praxinoscope and hence is
prepared to teach Tarzan about civilization.  This seems like in the
worst traditions of "Gilligan's Island."
     There are no African people in this version.  That is not
surprising since however they are portrayed there would be someone
unhappy with the representation.  Though Africans are present in the
original novel, Disney decision-makers probably thought it was best
side-stepping the issues of including them in their adaptation.  There
have been some people taking issue with the fact they have been
eliminated, but it is relatively few.  It is ironic that the filmmakers
may be afraid to put in native Africans since they have Tarzan himself
ask the question, "why are you afraid of anything different from you?"
Apparently the filmmakers felt they themselves had something to fear.
But it is doubly ironic because Tarzan himself is a symbol of the power
of diversity.  After all he is presumably the lord of the animals
because he is actually human, and he is an invincible hero among humans
because he was raised by animals.
     Disney studios had the potential to make a very good adaptation of
the Edgar Rice Burroughs classic fantasy TARZAN OF THE APES.  Instead
they have set their sights considerably lower and made a film that will
have little appeal beyond grade-school level audiences.  I rate it a 4
on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.

88 minutes
starring the voices of Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver, Glenn Close, Nigel
Hawthorne, Alex D. Linz, Rosie O'Donnell, Wayne Knight
based on the story "Tarzan Of The Apes" by Edgar Rice Burroughs
written by Tab Murphy, Bob Tzudiker and Noni White
directed by Chris Buck and Kevin Lima
Although many movie studios have taken the animation genre to
unexpected heights in the past five years, the films carrying the
Disney logo are still the most memorable.  "Tarzan", Disney's latest,
is no exception. Using the original story by Edgar Rice Burroughs,
"Tarzan" breaks little new ground, but it is still an entertaining
treat. "Tarzan" features Tony Goldwyn(director of "A Walk On The
Moon") as the title character, and Minnie Driver as Jane, his love
interest. The story is the oft-told one about the boy who is raised as
a gorilla and uses his animal instincts to woo a woman who is studying
the gorillas. At times, "Tarzan" is very derivative of "The Lion
King", and the characters aren't nearly as well developed as those in
that film. But "Tarzan" is an animated film that people of all ages
