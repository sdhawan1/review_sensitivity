Professor Brody (Jeff Goldblum, "Jurassic Park II") is on the verge of 
discovering a cure for human allergies to dogs.  This doesn't sit well
with Mr. Tinkles (voice of Sean Hayes, TV's "Will and Grace"), a pampered
Persian seeking to return world rule to his fellow felines.  When the 
Brody's dog, a canine agent named Buddy, is catnapped, the canine underground's
attempts to plant a new agent is foiled and it's up to a Beagle puppy
named Lou (voice of Tobey Maguire, "Wonder Boys") to protect the humans
and foil the felines in "Cats & Dogs."
After the successful anthropomorphics of the "Dr. Dolittle" and "Babe"
movies, "Cats & Dogs" would seem a natural.  But a slew of special effects,
Jim Henson's creature shop and trained animals can't make up for witless,
charmless writing.
After the somewhat amusing catnapping episode, we settle in to watch a
film that simply lays there.  Dogs drive vehicles to headquarters and use
surveillance devices.  Ninja cats and a Russian Blue attack Lou.  The 
professor forgets his son's soccer practice.  Mr. Tinkles gets driven 
around in a limo.  The Brody's are held for the ransom of the allergy drug, 
which Mr. Tinkles plans to reverse and distribute via a horde of mice.
All of this is numbingly boring.
The dogs at least look like real dogs, although the vocal talents of Susan
Sarandon, Maguire, Charlton Heston, Joe Pantoliano and Michael Clark Duncan
are wasted.  Alec Baldwin's Butch, an Anatolian shepherd, is the most likeable 
character in the film, although even he is forced to say lines like 'Son of
my mother.'  (Baldwin now has the distinction of appearing in two of the worst 
children's films ever made with this following "Thomas and the Magic 
Railroad.")
The cats are all clearly puppets, an uneven distraction.  In fact the cats 
of "Cats & Dogs" bear more resemblance to Gremlins than to actual household
pets.  Yet even these cats fare better than the human cast.  Jeff Goldblum 
appears to be in a drugged stupor, his apparent reading of an absent-minded 
professor.  Elizabeth Perkins ("28 Days") is embarrassingly stiff and young 
Alexander Pollock ("Big Bully") is bland.
I couldn't be cattier - "Cats & Dogs" should be relegated to the pooper
scooper.

PLOT:
A goofy scientist is about to come up with a formula that will get rid 
of all dog allergies around the world. All of the cats in the world 
aren't happy about this chain of events because they fear that this will 
make dogs even more popular with people, and diminish their power. So 
they come up with a plan to steal the formula from the scientist, invert 
its effects and make everyone in the world allergic to dogs. Woo-hoo!
CRITIQUE:
Not as laugh-out-loud funny as SHREK, not as energetic as SPY KIDS, but 
certainly an all-around fun movie for kids. I say kids specifically, 
because the two films mentioned above also worked for me as someone over 
the age of 12, but this film was a little more kiddie-oriented. Not as 
many inside jokes or mature potshots in this one (other than one of the 
funnier lines in the film in which a pissed off dog exclaims "Son of my 
mom!" (i.e. Son of a bitch!)). Pretty funny, I thought. Overall though, 
the humor and the very basic Disney-esque plot of the film didn't engage 
me as much as I had hoped from the trailer. Having said that, holy 
special effects, Batman! I gotta give out some major props to the 
filmmakers here because the movie is shot impeccably and the effects 
work really well throughout. The dogs really look like they're talking, 
the cats really look like they're smiling and frowning and by God, they 
all really look like they're fighting, punching and pulling the wool 
over every human's eyes. Very, very well done in that respect. I also 
have to mention the great vision of the script, which has to do with 
cats working on a worldwide scale to end the "best friend" token tag of 
dogs, as well as the whole doggie underworld (which is literally 
under-ground) packed with futuristic mobiles, sophisticated 
communication systems, computers and a UN-type organization filled with 
dogs from all around the planet. Sounds pretty cool, eh?
Well, it's definitely cool and admittedly most of the action scenes were 
plenty slick as well. There are two particularly hi-larious characters 
in the film, both of whom spring from feline. One is the night-goggled 
ninja cats who break into a dog's home and kick all kinds of Matrix 
arse, and two, is a Russian pussy who they send in after the first round 
of kitties. A true "professional" hitman with a great accent and some 
real funny lines. The "live" characters on the other hand, Jeff Goldblum 
and Elizabeth Perkins, don't really need to do much in this film other 
than stand around and pretend not to know what's going on (and Goldblum 
acts "weird" as usual), while Alec Baldwin's voice as Butch, the lead 
dog, is impeccable and the dog even looks like him! (pretty neat) 
Overall, I certainly did enjoy myself with this picture, but it didn't 
really blow me away more than that. Most of the time I was just thinking 
to myself "oh, that's clever" as opposed to getting into the whole thing 
and laughing my head off. But like I said earlier, this movie is 
definitely more kid-oriented and even though everyone else is likely to 
enjoy it as well, I don't think that it's gonna strike as many chords 
across the board. BTW, seeing as one of the species comes out the 
"winner" in this film, need I predict a sequel entitled DOGS & CATS? 
Natch. Take the kids, they'll love it!

Reviewed by Dustin Putman, July 6, 2001.
Judging from the theatrical trailers and TV ads, "Cats and Dogs" should have 
been a good movie. It should have been original, energetic, witty, and, most 
of all, a love letter to dog and cat lovers everywhere. But it isn't. A 
family movie that is too juvenile to impress adults (you know, the way the 
recent "Shrek" did), and far too meanspirited to be heartwarming or sweet, 
"Cats and Dogs" is a surprisingly ill-advised misfire that surely won't be 
garnering many devoted fans above the age of single digits.
The title says it all--the film is a 90-minute battle between cats and dogs 
over world domination. Mr. Tinkles (voiced by Sean Hayes) is a beautiful, 
white Persian cat who everyone thinks is cute, but actually is the 
no-holds-barred leader of the feline population. When word gets out that he 
plans to steal the anti-dog-allergy serum that a human scientist (Jeff 
Goldblum) has created, it's up to the scientist's new puppy (voiced by Tobey 
Maguire) and his camaraderie of fellow dogs to stop the fiendish Mr. Tinkles.
Directed by Lawrence Guterman, "Cats and Dogs" is not particularly enjoyable, 
and it's only intermittent smiles are produced from the adorableness of the 
animals, rather than the dim-witted screenplay by John Requa and Glenn 
Ficarra. Dull and by-the-numbers, there are no characters (human or pet) that 
gain our sympathies or that we grow to like, and the only creativity to be 
found is merely hinted by the overall premise of cats against dogs.
There is also an obvious bias over the dogs in the picture, all of which are 
presented as the "good guys." The cats, on the other hand, are scheming, 
manipulative, and nasty, so the movie doesn't even play fair. How are 
audiences able to have fun in deciding who to root for when the cats are so 
blatantly characterized as the villains? Aside from Sean Hayes' inspired 
voiceover work for Mr. Tinkles, the other animals are giant bores, including 
those played by such well-known thesps as Susan Sarandon, Alec Baldwin, and 
Tobey Maguire.
The human cast is nearly non-existent, both in terms of screen time and 
development. Jeff Goldblum (1998's "Holy Man") must be down on his luck these 
days; how else can you explain him taking a wasted role reminiscent of Rick 
Moranis' in 1989's "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," and then not even being any 
good? Elizabeth Perkins (2000's "28 Days"), as Goldblum's wife; Alexander 
Pollock (1999's "Resurrection"), as their son; and Miriam Margolyes (1999's 
"End of Days"), as Mr. Tinkles' annoying maid, are equally slumming it with 
parts that anybody could have played just as well, or better.
The frequent attempts at humor in "Cats and Dogs," including yet another riff 
on "The Matrix," are strictly amateurish, and aside from the clever first 
scene, no attempt even seems to have been made to take advantage of its 
ingenious storyline. Ultimately, the only mercy that is given to audiences 
unfortunate enough to end up in a theater showing "Cats and Dogs" is that 
it's only 90 minutes. Without an ounce of entertainment value, anything more 
would have, quite honestly, been torture.

We've already seen kids play James Bond this year in Spy Kids - now it's
time for the family pet to don high-tech gear and battle the bad guys.  And
if there's anything more visually pleasing than a talking dog using
binoculars, I don't want to know what it is.  Cats and Dogs ranks somewhere
between Shrek and Atlantis for summer family-film enjoyment.  The story
barely matters, and it smartly takes a backseat to the picture's
surprisingly well-done special effects.
I know, I know - you're all thinking, "We've just seen a cruddy movie about
talking animals with Eddie Murphy, and the last decent family film with
talking dogs and cats was Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey, and that's
so old, Michael J. Fox wasn't even shaking yet."  Well, you're right, and
what's more, Cats is violent and mean-spirited, to boot.  But it's a whole
lot of fun, and the kids at my screening sure seemed to enjoy the hell out
it.
The film opens with an impressive chase scene between a dog and cat that
culminates in the dog being "catnapped" by a gang of ferocious felines that
work for the fiendishly evil Mr. Tinkles (voiced by Sean Hayes, Will and
Grace).  What, you may ask yourselves, would a cat who is hell-bent on
taking over the world want with a mangy old pooch?  It's simple:  The dog
was really an undercover special agent protecting a scientist (Jeff
Goldblum, Holy Man) and his cutting-edge research on a dog allergy formula.
If Professor Brody succeeds, dogs will remain at the right hand of their
masters.  If the cats are able to sabotage the project, they'll take over
the human race, just like they did in ancient Egypt.  (Don't ask me - I told
you the story took a backseat to the effects, remember?)
The undercover dog agents (whose motto is "To Fetch and Protect") try to get
one of their own into the Brody household to defend the professor's work,
but a rather moronic Beagle puppy named Lou (Tobey Maguire, Wonder Boys)
becomes the new family pet instead.  Lou has dreamt of exciting adventures
but has no formal dog militia training, which means he gets his ass kicked
by a pair of Ninja cats before his superior (Alec Baldwin, Pearl Harbor) can
show Lou how to take care of himself.  Holy shit!  Is it a sign of the
apocalypse when the dog voiced by Baldwin looks just like Baldwin?  That's
one creepy dog.
There are a few other decent celebrity voices in Cats, like Susan Sarandon,
Michael Clarke Duncan, Joe Pantoliano and Jon Lovitz (wait - is he still a
celebrity?).  Like Shrek, there's a lot of inside adult humor, too, like
when one dog exclaims in frustration, "Son of my mother!"  The bit with the
Russian cat is priceless, as is the best soccer spoof since The Simpsons
went to the Mexico v. Portugal match.  It's all kind of surprising,
considering the script is from a couple of guys with no feature-film
experience (John Requa and Glenn Ficarra), and it's directed by a
first-timer, too (Lawrence Guterman)..

Susan Granger's review of "CATS & DOGS" (Warner Bros.)
  Unbeknownst to us humans, a struggle for control of our planet has been waged between cats and dogs for centuries. And the balance of power is tipping. Professor Brody (Jeff Goldblum) is working on a medication for people who are allergic to dogs, causing an edgy, maniacal white Persian cat, Mr. Tinkles (Sean Hayes), and his reluctant henchcat Calico (Jon Lovitz) to declare war, targeting the Brody home, including Mrs. Brody (Elizabeth Perkins) and their 11 year-old son Scott (Alexander Pollock) as their newly adopted pocket beagle, Lou (Tobey Maguire), becomes pivotal in the canine counter-spy network. Working to prevent a cat-astrophe are Butch (Alec Baldwin), a jaded Anatolian shepherd; Ivy (Susan Sarandon), a wise Saluki hound; Peek (Joe Pantoliano), a small Chinese Crested who's a computer whiz; Sam (Michael Clarke Duncan), a bumbling Old English sheepdog; and Mastiff (Charlton Heston) in charge of Central Dog Command.  Their adversaries include a secret agent k!
nown as The Russian, along with a team of Devon Rexes as Ninja cats, armed with knives and grenades, and 6700 "infected" mice. And it all leads up to a confrontation in Mr. Mason's Flocking Factory, filled with industrial-size tree-flockers, plus snowmen, Christmas trees.
   Despite the ad copy, writers Glenn Ficarra & John Recqua don't allow you to "root for" pet rivals, since they stack the doggone deck against the sneaky felines. And director Lawrence Gutterman, working with renowned animal trainer Boone Narr, is far more concerned about seamlessly combining live-action with puppetry and CGI. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Cats & Dogs" is a purr-snickety 6. For a matinee, it's frisky, fanciful, furr-ocious family fun!

In a line of canine propaganda, Butch (voiced by Alec Baldwin) reminds us "Dogs
have always been man's best friend."  Cats, on the other hand, represent the
dark side in Lawrence Guterman's live action comedy, CATS & DOGS, a movie that
has enough on its mind to entertain the parents but is clearly aimed at the
youngsters in the audience.
In this eternal battle between cats and dogs, both sides are now armed.  A crack
team of secret agent dogs has doghouses that are worthy of NSA outposts.  Using
every weapon from radar to sonar to thermal imaging, they are tracking the
nefarious cats.  After admonishing his dog agents that "failure is not an
option," their leader goes on to remind them "one hundred million dogs have
placed their destiny firmly in our paws."
The three humans in the story are an out-to-lunch Professor Brody (Jeff
Goldblum), a mad scientist like Wayne Szalinski from HONEY I SHRUNK THE KIDS,
the professor's oblivious-to-the-obvious wife (Elizabeth Perkins), and their
son, Scott, played lifelessly by Alexander Pollock.  The professor is working on
a cure for dog allergies in humans.  With it, everyone can adopt a puppy without
worries.  This, however, worries the felines who figure that this would
constitute a cataclysmic shift in the balance of world power between cats and
dogs.  The cats want to stop the professor and turn his experiment to their use.
The feline arsenal includes everything from Ninja paratroopers to stealth poop. 
 Their leader, a snowball of a cat named Mr. Tinkles (voiced by Sean Hayes),
will stop at nothing in his mission of world domination.  His biggest problem is
a pesky maid who treats him like, well, a cat.  Most humiliating is her
proclivity for dressing him in cute little dresses.  The dog world looks to an
accidental new recruit, a sweet little beagle named Lou (actually short for
Loser), who is voiced by Tobey Maguire, to lead their battle.  Not surprisingly,
Lou rises to the challenge.  
The script by John Requa and Glenn Ficarra has many funny moments.  My favorite
line comes from a dog named Ivy (voiced by Susan Sarandon).  Although strictly
speaking she is a "stray," she prefers to refer to her condition as being
"domestically challenged."  The best moment comes in a totalitarian dictator
scene as Mr. Tinkles lays out his grand plan to his assembled masses.  It's a
stirringly funny scene.
Personally, I am waiting for the sequel, DOGS & CATS, so that the dogs' evil
ways can be exposed, and the sweet kitties can conquer.  Did I mention that --
although I love all animals -- I am definitely a cat person?  No matter.  Any
objective observer will see that the poor cats were railroaded in this comedy
and deserve a chance for revenge!
CATS & DOGS runs 1:27.  It is rated PG for animal action and humor and would be
acceptable for all ages.
My son Jeffrey, age 12, loved everything about the film and gave it ****.  He
especially mentioned how much he enjoyed Lou, Mr. Tinkles, the gadgets and the
animals' planning.  His cousin Matthew, age 5, gave the movie **** as well.  His
favorite part was the mice scene.  Matthew's brother Jacob, age 8, gave it ***. 
He enjoyed Mr. Tinkles's dress-up scenes the best.
The film is playing in nationwide release now in the United States.  In the
Silicon Valley, it is showing at the AMC and the Century theaters.

Cats and dogs are both intelligent, well-organized species that talk. A
secret war between them has been going on for over a thousand years. In
ancient Egypt, cruel feline overlords herded their human slaves around
like cattle, until an army of canines came to our rescue, thereafter
acting as benign guardians of mankind.
At least that's the way the dogs tell it.
Why, you may ask, don't we remember such a momentous historical event?
According to one pooch, the answer is simple. "Humans are primitive," he
explains to a pup. "They can't sense earthquakes, they can't smell fear
and they won't accept responsibility for their own farts."
"Cats and Dogs" is a raucous comedy based on a genuinely inventive
concept. Kids, I suspect, will love the movie and most adults will find
it moderately entertaining. There's nothing wrong with that, but it's
frustrating to see such a promising undertaking fail to realize its full
potential. The problem is that the screenplay was written for children,
with scattered bits thrown in for adults, even though the premise
screams for a multilayered approach. With another rewrite or two, "Cats
and Dogs" could have kept the adults laughing as hard as the children.
I'm convinced the authors were up to the task. Anyone capable of having
an angry dog shout, "Son of my mom!" could surely have pulled it off.
Still, there are treats to be had, beginning with the storyline. An
uneasy, but long-standing truce between cats and dogs breaks down due to
a megalomaniacal feline and a preoccupied human scientist. Professor
Brody (Jeff Goldblum) is on the verge of a major breakthrough: a simple
formula that will immunize mankind against all dog allergies. If
successful, the balance of power between the two four legged species
would shift. For the power-mad tabby Mr. Tinkles (voiced by Sean Hayes),
the situation offers him a golden opportunity Â if he can destroy the
formula and infect man with a substance that will increase dog
allergies, he canÂ RULE THE WORLD!
The dogs will have none of this, of course, so they make arrangements to
place one of their top agents in the Brody household. But a mistake
happens and, instead of the James Bond of pooches, the new Brody "pet"
turns out to be a wet-behind-the-floppy-ears pup named Lou (Tobey
Maguire).
And so the battle begins. The dogs work undercover to bring Lou up to
snuff, with an embittered veteran named Butch (Alec Baldwin) heading up
a team including Sam (Michael Clarke Duncan), Peek (Joe Pantoliano) and,
to the discomfort of Butch, Ivy (Susan Sarandon), an ex-lover who knows
him all too well. Meanwhile, Mr. Tinkles sets his master plan in motion.
I won't reveal the specifics; suffice to say it involves threats,
kidnapping, deception on a grand scale, and ninja cats.
For the most part, the special effects are convincing. Computer
animation is employed to make the animals appear to speak and change
facial expressions, with animatronic puppets used for scenes requiring
unusual physical adroitness. The CGI is quite well-done and, more often
than not, the puppetry works. But hoo-boy, when it doesn't Â those
critters look like Muppets being struck by lightning.
As with "A.I. Artificial Intelligence," the actors playing non-humans
are far more credible, and likable, than the "real" people. On the dog
side, Tobey Maguire gives Lou the right mix of naivetÃ© and brashness,
Susan Sarandon is wise and smoky as Ivy and Alec Baldwin does fine work
essentially re-playing his character from "Pearl Harbor" (only with
better dialogue). In Cat Land, Jon Lovitz is fine as a surly assistant
and, in the key role of Mr. Tinkles, Sean Hayes provides the appropriate
grandiose tones for the would-be kitty Napoleon.
Oh, but when the humans take center stage, the film devolves into a
carbon copy of one of those wretched live-action Disney family comedies
from the '60s. Alexander Pollock is bland as son Scott and Elizabeth
Perkins is even blander as Mrs. Brody, an ineffective nurturer who
spends most of the movie fretting. As wacky scientist/lousy father
Professor Brody, Jeff Goldblum is simply embarrassing, slathering his
patented stammer over the walking stereotype.
If "Cats and Dogs" is successful enough to warrant a sequel, I have a
couple of suggestions for the filmmakers. First, take your time and
write more jokes for the grown-ups. Second, if a maniacal cat threatens
to kill the Brody family, let him.

Thinking about dogs, this image comes to mind.  Our
stately friend plays with your child in the backyard,
happy to chase balls and sticks.  He sits on a
windowsill to bark at strangers and mailmen.  He roams
the neighborhood and marks his territory.  However, in
the cleverly presented family film, "Cats & Dogs," we
learn that these animals are not just family pets that
run happily through idyllic, suburban yards.  Most of
their actions revolve around reconnaissance.  And what
are they on the lookout for?  The answer is cats, who
grow continually resentful that dogs are man's best
friend and not them.
It's a dog-eat-dog world out there and only the
strongest species can claim their spot next to humans.
 Cats and dogs have been locked in a never-ending
struggle since time immemorial.  So intense are their
military tactics that dogs work from a secret base at
the center of the earth with technology that rivals
the headquarters of any James Bond film and, perhaps,
even the Pentagon.  Cats are equally well-equipped. 
In some of the wackier sequences, ninja cats come
prowling along with night vision goggles while another
evil feline spy coughs up hairballs that hide grenades
and other devices.
The current battlefield involves the Brody house.  The
father (Jeff Goldblum) is an eccentric scientist who
is on the verge of a major breakthrough.  If
successful, he could eradicate allergic reaction to
dogs.  This is very threatening for cats who visualize
more dog lovers in the world as a result.  The evil
cat, Mr. Tinkles (voice of Sean Hayes), has a
nefarious plan of his own.  Steal the formula, alter
its composition, and then use it to make humans
deathly allergic to dogs.  
Assigned to guard the Brody home is Lou (voiced by
Tobey Maguire), a cute beagle puppy guaranteed to
elicit several 'awws' from the audience.  Lou actually
winds up there as a result of a mix-up.  Yet despite
his inexperience, Butch (voiced by Alec Baldwin), a
regal shepherd dog and weathered secret agent, quickly
brings him up to speed.  For much of the film, these
two and other various dog agents fend off increasingly
ambitious encroachments by the cats.
Also of note are the special effects.  The animals
bear expressions that are incredibly human and the
lips move in perfect unison to the words being spoken.
 To bring this film to life, state-of-the-art
techniques combine real animals with puppets and
computer-generated effects.  The realism is
impressive.
You may see these common house pets and think that
spying dogs and scheming cats are absurd.  But if you
think about it, dogs would make great agents.  With
their acute hearing, heightened senses, speed, and
bravery, dogs could accomplish many unique tasks. 
It's also easy to picture Mr. Tinkles as the
supervillain.  I am reminded of a movie villain named
Blofeld (a recurring nemesis of early James Bond
films) who always held this type of cat in his lap. 
Maybe this cat will succeed where Blofeld failed.  Mr.
Tinkles has a deadpan, capricious demeanor and is as
demented as he is funny.
A better family film along this genre is "Spy Kids." 
That film had more energy.  However, children will
love the talking animals and adults should find enough
humor to keep them from getting bored throughout the
87-minute running time.  Like cats and dogs, this film
is nice to have around.

Featuring the voice talents of Tobey Maguire, Alec
Baldwin, Sean Hayes, Susan Sarandon, Joe Pantoliano,
Michael Clarke Duncan, and starring Jeff Goldblum,
Elizabeth Perkins, Alexander Pollock and Miriam
Margolyes. Directed by Lawrence Guterman. Rated PG.
While other films have had it as a subplot, Cats &
Dogs is probably the first film to focus on the
eon-old rivalry between the two titular species. You'd
think, though, that said rivalry would be domestic in
nature, consisting of kitchen hijinks, running up
trees and other varied kinds of Tom & Jerry-style
ephemera. But, since all American movies must take
their subjects to their logical conclusions, the cats
and dogs here have their own secret societies,
complete with elaborate plans for world domination.
There are human characters as well, namely Professor
Brody (Jeff Goldblum), his wife (Elizabeth Perkins)
and his pre-teen son Scott (Alexander Pollock).
Professor Brody is working on a formula to eliminate
dog allergies in humans. This formula is very
important to the dog underworld, of course, since
their world still revolves around humans despite
having technology that's just as advanced. To the
cats, led by the nefarious Mr. Tinkles (Sean Hayes),
the formula spells (smells?) disaster, and they want
to steal it. Meanwhile, in their own labs, they work
on a way to reverse the formula to make all humans
allergic to dogs.
After the canine agent in charge of protecting the
Brody formula is dognapped, headquarters sends in a
new agent, a young recruit straight out of the
Academy. He never gets there. Instead, the Brodys get
a clueless young beagle pup named Lou (Tobey Maguire),
who wouldn't know a walkie-talkie if it rammed him on
the head. It's up to him, then, with support by a
next-door veteran agent (Alec Baldwin) to protect the
formula against Russian spy cats, ninja cats and other
feline schemes.
Cats & Dogs' script is completely commercial and
conventional, likely written and rewritten until an
executive thought it was in the best form to please
the most people. That the film still works is the
result of seamless special effects, solid performances
by reliable stars and those flashes of imagination
that were still left over. I like the way that the
doggie underworld was depicted; it's always good to
see a movie that isn't afraid to look a little silly.
I like, too, that the film made the cats villains.
I've always thought there was something sinister about
those creatures and Cats & Dogs confirms my
suspicions. Actually, I'm just allergic to them and
I'm venting my anger. Don't mind me.
There are some clever one-liners, such as the
painfully obvious but still funny exclamation "Son of
my mom!" given to one of the lead canines. Others are
just painfully obvious, such as a stray dog calling
herself "domestically challenged." And Will and
Grace's Sean Hayes is consistently a hoot as Mr.
Tinkles; I don't know where the hell he came from all
of a sudden, but I want to see more of him in
big-screen comedy.
What disappointed me most was the film's decision to
turn into a sugary (more like lumpy) boy-and-his-dog
tale. Since all eyes are on the special effects and
the central inter-species rivalry, nobody in the
audience cares whether or not little Scott likes his
puppy or not, and neither do the filmmakers. The
resulting subplot works best if you ignore it.
You get the idea. The movie is hit-and-miss. But the
90 minutes go by fast, and this is adequate family

Since time began, the fight for world domination has been going on between
two powerful and intelligent adversaries. Unknown to mankind, cats had once
wielded supreme power until the canines of the world threw out these feline
dictators. Since then, the struggle has continued until now when kitty-cat
leader, Mr. Tinkles (voice of Sean Hayes) has come up with a plan for him
and his minion to take back power and rule the world once again in "Cats &
Dogs."
Just look at the concept presented here: talking, smart cats and dogs wage
a war - the cats want to take over and the dogs, the loyal creature that
they are, want to save man from feline tyranny. Throw into this mix a mad
scientist, Professor Brody (Jeff Goldblum,) who is on the brink of finding
a permanent cure for dog allergies, a cure that would make it possible for
every man woman and child to own a dog. The cats, led by Mr. Tinkles, will
stop at nothing to destroy the formula and put Mr. T at the helm of a
kitty-dominated world.
When the Brodys' canine guardian Buddy is catnapped, a new protector must
been put in the old bloodhound's place to make sure the family is safe and
unaware of any danger. Circumstance pushes a cute beagle pup into their
household and the little guy soon learns of the evil feline plan. He is
recruited by doggie secret agent Butch (Alec Baldwin) and undergoes an
intensive course of training to fulfill his mission - protect the formula
and the family. When the Brody son, Scotty (Alexander Pollock), rejects the
puppy, calling him "Loser," or "Lou" for short, it becomes the little dog's
additional mission to become the boy's best friend.
This all sounds like a great idea - on paper, at least. Talking cats and
dogs, high-tech special F/X and a story concept that seems like a real
winner should make this a good, if not great, kids' movie. It isn't and
fails, miserably, in bringing any life to the wooden, unfunny screenplay by
John Requa and Glenn Ficarra. The elements of a successful film are there,
but the unentertaining story that should bring the animals and the F/X
together falls flat on its face. What we get is a routine fantasy with bad
kitties trying to take over the world and the good doggies out to stop
them. Throwing in numerous James Bond references - like an evil Russian
Blue cat hurling a knife at Lou, saying it's "from Russia with love," get
it? - and lots of high-tech gear like doggie rocket sleds is supposed to
make it exciting. Well, maybe for very small kids, but I think not for
anyone else.
The vocal talents used to give voice to the cats and dogs are okay, but
none of them breaths real life into their animal personas. Compare this
film, for example, with the much funnier anthropomorphic efforts in the
recent "Dr. Dolittle 2," where a few lines by a raccoon with rabies
provides more laughs than the entirety of "Cats & Dogs." Toby Maguire is
bland as the voice of little Lou. Alec Baldwin gives strength to his
vocalization of Butch, but he fights a losing battle. Sean Hayes is more
annoying than sinister as the power hungry feline, Mr. Tinkles. Wasted are
the vocal efforts of Susan Sarandon, Joe Pantoliano, Michael Clarke Duncan,
Jon Lovitz (who should have had a heck of a lot more fun as the toady
hench-kitty, Calico) and, especially, Charleton Heston. Live action players
Goldblum and Elizabeth Perkins must be told they made a horrible career
decision showing up here.
It is unfortunate that the special F/X team, led by Ed Jones and utilizing
the talents of Jim Henson's Creature Shop, are saddled with the incredibly
lame story. These folks make the animals do the impossible - talk, fly,
engage in martial arts and operate a rocket sled - and could have, with a
well-written, intelligent story and its execution, made this a fun summer
flick. As I have said many times before, special F/X, alone, do not make a
movie and even a kiddie pick should have intelligence and wit. "Cats &
Dogs" just batters you with the inane and lots of it.
Whoever created the theatrical trailer should be applauded (or disdained)
for doing such a great job in making a bad movie look good. Maybe that crew
should have made "Cats & Dogs." This is a case of shoot those responsible
and forgive the technicians. I give it a D.

I have officially reached my quota for the year of talking animal
movies.  Dr. Dolittle 2 pushed me to the edge, and the animatronic
animal flick Cats & Dogs has pushed right over it, into a giddy oblivion
where I now firmly believe purple dinosaurs can communicate with humans
through song and dance.
Cats & Dogs is ridiculous and harmless, a Mission: Impossible for the
animal world.  For years, a secret high-tech espionage war has been
waged between the feline and canine races, right under the noses of
ignorant humans.  The spark of this high-tech war came about as the
result of the dog race overthrowing the then-dominating cat race during
ancient Egyptian times (they even ruled the human race).  Man's best
friend re-established the humans as the dominant race and has protected
that balance for years.  And a breakthrough for dogs is approaching, as
one human, Professor Brody (Jeff Goldblum), is on the verge of
discovering an allergy vaccine which will enable all humans and dogs to
co-exist in peace.  The only problem is that the diabolic Mr. Tinkle
(voiced by Sean Hayes), a furry white Persian with the attitude of
Richard Grant's character from Hudson Hawk, and his small army of pesky
felines have "cat-knapped" the family dog Buddy, who has been guarding
the Professor and his family from the tuna-breathed fiends.  The
bodyguard job then falls on the shoulders of a Beagle pup named Lou
(voiced by Toby Maguire) -- who is mistaken as a secret agent dog by an
Anatolian Shepard named Butch (voiced by Alec Baldwin).
Butch and his crew, which includes an Old English sheep dog named Sam
(voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan) and a Chinese Crested named Peek
(voiced by Joe Pantoliano), train young Lou in self-defense and the best
ways to put a cat down for good.  Along the way, Lou and the crew face
crazed Siamese ninja cats, a Russian Blue who throws enough knives to
make Oddjob proud, and the tyrannical Mr. Tinkles, who declares in
moments of comedic brilliance that, "Evil does not wear a bonnet!"
It sounds ugly but hey, it's a kids movie and that's the audience that
will love it.  The animal training/acting is above par.  The computer
graphics are decent, but the animatronic talking dogs and cats resemble
the talking dolls on the boat ride at Disneyland's "It's A Small
World."  My biggest complaint with Cats and Dogs is that once again,
cats are demonized into evil incarnations that would have Jim Jones
shaking in his boots.  "Who Will You Root For?" the posters ask us?  The
film leaves you no choice at all.  [filmcritic.com is cat people. -Ed.]
The downfall of Cats & Dogs comes when the human characters start
dominating the film.  The cornball Hallmark-esque moments of family
bonding and issues of neglected children distract you from the sharp
comedy between Mr. Tinkle and his main henchman Calico (voiced by the
brilliant John Lovitz) as they discuss their vain attempt to take over
the world through "World Domination Pamphlets."
And I'd also like to know how the hell the dogs are able to afford to
build rocket ships and radar stations to keep this war going.
