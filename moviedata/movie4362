It is with a queasy mind that I entered the theater to see Election.
This year has already had a glut of high school movies, most of which
have been of dubious quality.  Does the world need another one?  If that
movie is Election, the answer is "yes".  A smart and funny satire of
high school, and life in general, Election shows how to do the high
school genre right.
Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is an overachieving student at Carver
High School, in Omaha.  She is the type of girl who will stop at
absolutely nothing to reach her goal.  Her latest challenge is to become
Student Body President, which shouldn't be too hard (since she's the
only one running).
Enter Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick), history teacher.  He secretly
despises Tracy, and decides to give her a challenge.  He urges Paul
Metzler (Chris Klein), a naive but popular jock, to enter the race.
But things don't stop there, as Paul's lesbian sister, Tammy (Jessica
Campbell) decides to join the race as well.  An outcast at school, she
initially seems to have no chance of winning.  Yet, her nihilistic
attitudes strike a chord with the student body, and soon she becomes a
serious contender as well.
Based on Tom Perrotta's novel, Election is clever and whimsical.  Not
only does it aptly capture the nuances of high school and pointless
student body elections, but it reveals truths about politics and life as
a whole.
Matthew Broderick is an unusual choice to play Mr. McAllister.  At
times, he still seems a bit too boyish for the role, even though makeup
has added a bit of grey at his temples.  Still, Broderick is able to
bring a good dose of humor to the role, which serves as a compliment to
his Ferris Bueller days.  McAllister is a man who obsesses about the
difference between ethics and morals, meanwhile ignoring both.
The students are all a treat.  Reese Witherspoon is riveting as the
driven Tracy Flick, creating a memorable character that is familiar yet
unique.  Chris Klein seems to be channeling Keanu Reeves at points, but
he achieves the desired ambiance, that of a good intentioned airhead.
The film gets a bit distracted when it diverts attention away from the
election to focus on the marital problems of McAllister, his wife, Diane
(Molly Hagan), and their best friends, the  Novotnys (Mark Harelik and
Delaney Driscoll).  But, even when dwelling on this subplot, the film
retains its cruel comic edge.
Director Alexander Payne has created a very enjoyable satire in
Election.  Not the typical high school comedy, Election proves itself to
be much more.

     The time is coming for student council elections at Carver High
School. Unopposed for president is Tracy Flick (played by Reese
Witherspoon) the school's smug and snotty over-achiever.  This is the
girl who seems to be in every school club, on every school committee.
Everyone knows that she is the best and nobody tries to compete with
her.  What few people know is that she also was instrumental in the
firing of a teacher for a sexual misconduct in which she was
considerably more than a willing victim.  Jim McAllister (Matthew
Broderick) is the star teacher of the school, having won the Teacher of
the Year Award a record three years in a row.  He also was a friend of
the fired teacher. Partially because he knows that the indiscretion was
not all the teacher's fault, and partially as a lesson in democratic
principles to his students, Mr. McAllister decides to try to see if he
can whip up some competition for Tracy. The idealistic civics teacher
convinces Paul Metzler, a likeable jock sidelined by a broken leg, to
run against Tracy.  He is the exact opposite of Tracy.  Less than
bright in his studies he is nevertheless a nice person with lots of
friends.  Soon there is a surprise third counter-culture candidate
running for reasons of her own and collecting the vote of all the
disaffected of the school. This small beginning leads to chaos that
engulfs several people's lives, not the least of which is Mr.
McAllister's.
     ELECTION is a film that looks like it was shot in 16 millimeter
and blown up for the full sized screen.  The production values overall
seem to have been designed for economy.  About the only place it excels
is that it has a really good script.  I call that a pretty good
tradeoff.  In spite of the modest production budget co-writer and
director Alexander Payne has managed to do some things extraordinarily
well.  The lower-middle class is rarely shown in other films.
Character's homes shown in films tend to be wither upscale or on the
level of trailer parks.  Yet the housing developments with their sparse
vegetation strike a really believable note.  In fact the whole set of
inexpensive production values tend to make this film seem all the more
realistic.  Payne's only previous feature film was CITIZEN RUTH, itself
not a bad social satire.  But ELECTION shows a considerable
improvement.
     With the exception of the two leads, most of the cast has little
film experience, yet the acting in the film seems perfectly
professional.  Matthew Broderick seems a little young for the role of
the teacher, but that could be just because he himself seems boyish.
Reese Witherspoon may well find that this is a defining role in her
early career.  While she did not seem to bring any special talents to
her role in PLEASANTVILLE she is just perfect as the smug and totally
self-absorbed, over-achieving, Monica-Lewinsky-in-training.  ELECTION
is a satire of the caliber of Michael Ritchie's SMILE.  That puts it
miles ahead of recent entries like WAG THE DOG.  SMILE and ELECTION
would, in fact, make an excellent double feature.  I give ELECTION an8
on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.

        Pitched as a high-school comedy, "Election" is a troubling movie
more suited to an arthouse audience despite its mainstream storyline of a
young and motivated overachiever working the system.  While at times the
film matches the wit and sophistication of Wes Anderson's "Rushmore," a
film which sports similar themes, it doesn't apply as consistent an
approach, and "Election"'s overall mood is too dark and disturbing to shrug
off this weakness.
        The laughs are certainly there, even if empathizing with the film's
characters is difficult.  The actors, however, cannot be accused of turning
in less than accomplished performances.
        Reese Witherspoon, who seems to be fronting just about every other
Hollywood release these days, is bright and confident as Tracy Flick, the
perky go-getter who's running unopposed for Carver High's student
presidency.  That is, until poli-sci teacher Mr. McAllister convinces Paul
Metzler, a big lug of a football hero, into running against her.
        McAllister is played by Matthew Broderick with just the right
amount of murky ambivalence.  McAllister dislikes Tracy Flick, blaming her
for just about everything that has gone wrong in his life.  And he blames
her for destroying the life of one of his colleagues, with whom Tracy had a
brief but devastating affair.  "Some say it was because I never had a
father figure in my life," comments Tracy.  "I just felt so safe and secure
with him."
        It's throwaway lines like that which give "Election" its disturbing
edge.
        Director and co-writer Alexander Payne ("Citizen Ruth") rarely
misses an opportunity to make these subtle jabs.  Of course, once you're
lulled into this predictable pattern, Payne delivers a shocker of a
distinctly unsubtle variety.
        Payne's turbulent styling extends to his main characters.  While
clearly a tragic figure, Tracy is so irritating that she alienates
everyone's sympathies.  McAllister, on the other hand, is painted as a
likable schmuck but is almost repulsive in his hypocrisy and self-delusion.
It's an odd technique by the director, since you wind up not liking anybody
yet feeling sorry for everybody.
        "Election" pushes its satirical way through the seemingly
good-humored election race, pausing from time to time to blindside you with
some jarring realizations about human nature.  By the time the campaign is
in full-swing, Paul's sister Tammy has submitted her candidacy for
president as a knee-jerk reaction to being betrayed by her girlfriend, who
doesn't share Tammy's deeper feelings.  Tammy's Ross Perot-inspired
strategy is one that seems to appeal to the apathetic students of Omaha's
Carver High: vote for me and I'll do nothing!
        What we have here is not just another pubescent comedy because its
moral and ethical observations are shocking and true.  Payne understands
satire and possesses an innate ability to go for the jugular but sometimes
his deft and subcutaneous touch is too uncomfortable.

Smart movies are getting harder to come by.  Smart movies that are
entertaining are even tougher to find.  Give us a good story, honesty
within the script, and a good cast, and you've got yourself a movie
that'll go to the head of the class.  So before the summer session
begins, enroll yourself in what might be one of the hidden gems of this
movie year.  It's called "Election", and you won't find a smarter film
this month.
`Election' takes a unique look at life in high school.  It forwards the
notion that at that tender time of adolescence, everyone's primary goal
in life is to do something that will benefit themselves.  All others
are just obstacles to be stepped on.  Specifically, it centers on a
student body President race, and the three final contenders span the
gamut of personality types from zealous overachiever to popular jock to
irreverent lesbian.   The presidency is a tool that each one can use to
further their goals.  This story is also about frumpish
three-time-Teacher-of-the-Year Mr. McAllistar (Mathew Broderick). He
cares about each student, imparts sage advice whenever he can, and is
as much a part of high school life as study hall, detention and pep
rallies.  He oversees the student body election, but despite his
general hands-off disposition, certain circumstances cause him to take
more of an interest in who wins.  
Above all, he wants to stop Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) from
achieving the greatness that she is destined to achieve.  Partially,
it's because she had an affair with one of his colleagues.  But mostly,
there is just something intolerable about the Tracy Flicks of the
world.  She is always the first to raise her hand in class and always
volunteers time for every club.  On the outside, she is a prim, perky
angel.  But on the inside, there broods a vindictive jezebel and
merciless competitor.  In her bid, she spends late nights stamping out
`Pick Flick' pins and prepares 500 cupcakes on the morning of the
election.  McAllistar hates her with a passion yet also lusts for her. 
His solution is to convince Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) to run against
her, who can leverage his reputation as the popular jock who's
handsome, rich (thanks to his father), and well-liked.  When Tracy
learns of Paul's entry into the presidential race, she projects a cold
look of disdain that could send shivers up your spine.
Within the high school genre lies an untapped lode of great stories and
varied personalities.  Here, we aptly see that it's a vacuum of
'me-centered' people who do what they can to survive.  I still remember
the trials and tribulations of high school as if it were only
yesterday.  The student body was like a rich tapestry full of color,
surprises, and confusion.  `Election" is a strikingly refreshing story
that satirizes the culture of high school and gives us a production
that is unique, original, and honest.  There are no corny love stories,
no sign of students who looked like 20 something models, no goofy
cliques, no bets on who could win the heart of a girl, and no climactic
scenes that always seems to take place at a wild house party or at the
prom.  If only high school students were as smart as this movie, we'd
all graduate to bigger and better things.

1999, R, 103 minutes [1 hour, 43 minutes]
Starring: Matthew Broderick (Mr. Jim McAllister), Reese Witherspoon (Tracy 
Flick), Chris Klien (Paul Metzler), Jessica Campbell (Tammy Metzler); written 
by Alexander Payne, Jim Taylor; produced by Albert Berger, David Gale, Keith 
Samples, Ron Yerxa; directed by Alexander Payne; based on the novel by Tom 
Perrotta.
Seen May 7, 1999 at 7 p.m. at the Crossgates Cinema 18 (Guilderland, NY), 
theater #10, with Chris Wessell and Shawn O'Shea for free using my Hoyts 
season pass. [Theater rating: ****: excellent, seats, sounds and pictures]
        Politics are by far one of the easiest and most frequent topics 
subject to brilliant satire in many forms. But when we think of politics we 
usually think of the bigger races: president, senate, congress, governor, 
even our local aldermen, not president of a high school student government 
association which is where `Election' gets its niche. However, the film isn't 
so much concerned with being an allegory for real politics as much as it is 
using a seemingly ordinary high school election to tell a story of some of 
the blackest comedy which is often cruel but sinfully tasty.
        WHO:
        Mr. Jim McAllister (Broderick): A 30-something social studies teacher 
who is also the advisor to the SGA and monitor of the school elections. He 
tells us a little of his life's background and present situation, most 
importantly that he and his wife have been having minor marital problems over 
the years which they hope will cease since they finally have the time to have 
a baby. McAllister is a pretty nice guy for the most part except he seems to 
take his job too seriously, especially when it comes to...
        Tracy Flick (Witherspoon): A high school over-achiever to the nth 
degree who is very smart but also extremely lonely. She has a cute face like 
a porcelain doll and is such a `good girl' she's sickening (like trying to 
down spoonfuls of sugar). We're told she was pushed by her single mother to 
be the best at everything possible and she lives up to that, but this also 
creates for her a major character flaw: jealousy. This is brought out and 
spotlighted in her race for SGA president, initially unopposed, but then 
comes...
        Paul Metzler (Klien): Former athletic hero for the high school until 
a skiing accident left him permanently hobbled. Paul is a complete and total 
mimbo (male bimbo), so much so that he talks and acts like he's stoned when 
he's always sober. He's also a popular guy because everyone at the school 
sympathizes with him, plus the fact he's a rich kid. All of which are perfect 
reasons for a good head-to-head race against Tracy, if it wasn't for...
        Tammy Metzler (Campbell): Younger sister of Paul whose secret 
girlfriend dumps her for her own brother and in the process reveals a case of 
jealousy. But Tammy is a bit more passive with her jealousy and often lets it 
out through depression, not hostility like Tracy. She enters the race simply 
to spite Paul, Tracy and the entire school establishment.
        WHAT:
        Anal-retentive Tracy begins her campaign and is determined to beat 
the Metzlers at any costs. But neither of the Metzlers take the election too 
seriously and at least Paul has fun participating in it. Meanwhile, Mr. 
McAllister's personal life is becoming too boring for him and in a 
subconscious effort to liven things up, he finds himself hopelessly drawn to 
his wife's best friend, who also happens to be the ex-wife of his own best 
friend (who has a disturbing connection to Tracy which is briefly touched on 
but is better off interpreted by the individual viewer).
        CRITIQUE:
        The film's screenplay deserves the most credit for making an 
otherwise shocking story flow so smoothly. Every character's motivation is 
clearly spelled out and often times done so well it's more than we need to 
know. Having the four main characters constantly recite their own narration 
from their perspective is  an original storytelling device and works well 
here since it actually helps the film to pace itself.
        If we were to simply list some of the factors at play here, this film 
could be seen as twisted and mean-spirited: the three candidates all screw 
over each other both consciously and unconsciously simply to win an election. 
We can at least chalk this up to immature children, but even our central 
adult figure, Mr. McAllister, isn't much of a role model since he's just as 
deviant as the mudslinging, lying, cheating, backstabbing, crybaby actions of 
Tracy, Paul and Tammy. But the fact he still comes off as the protagonist at 
all is nothing short of amazing (especially his role in the story's climax).
        The film definitely has a special, unique sense of satire and often 
manages to make for themes and issues that symbolize the real world, and not 
just of politics. In fact, there's very little specific issues of politics 
spoofed here. Tracy's narration of how she's had to work for everything just 
to have to run against people who have had everything handed to them might be 
a good example. A scene of a school assembly in which Tammy conveys a message 
of pure unadulterated apathy for the system to the audience's delight is 
another good one. In the end, it's just modern society that takes a beating - 
an easy target but it's not any kind of cop out.
        `Election' succeeds because it manages to take so many lurid elements 
of pop culture and society and somehow throw them at the viewer through a 
form of witty black comedy. But it reminds us that even black comedy is still 
a comedy, and who doesn't like to laugh?

Most people who have attended a typical American high school will
agree that few events are as inconsequential as the student election.
The only people who really care are the ones who are running for
office, and that because they want to make themselves appear
well-rounded when applying to college. When people take the election
seriously, as in this film, the politics can be intriguing and darkly
humorous.
This year's student council presidential election initially appears to
be uneventful, because the only person on the ballot is Tracy Flick
(Reese Witherspoon). Not too many people have much interest in the
election, but Tracy is not a typical student. She is highly serious,
motivated, and driven. Tracy takes everything so seriously that she
does not appear to have a clear view of reality. Everything she sees
is distorted by her overachiever's view of the world, where people are
either allies or rivals.
Tracy is well known and appreciated by the faculty, because she is
enthusiastic and involved. However, Tracy has an unusual relationship
with Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick), the history teacher.
Underneath the surface of their unremarkable teacher/pupil
relationship, they have a source of tension. Besides simply being
annoyed by Tracy's overambitious demeanor, Jim also holds her
responsible for the breakup of a friend's marriage and the destruction
of his career. It so happens that Tracy had an affair with a teacher,
a close friend of Jim, which ultimately led to his dismissal although
the details of the case never became public. While it may initially
appear that there will be a struggle between the obsessive, ruthless
Tracy and her wiser, principled teacher, Jim is shown to be a more
ambiguous character. A glaring discrepency exists between Jim's
lectures on morals and ethics, and how he implements those principles
in his personal life.
The story takes an unconventional approach by making neither of the
main characters likable. Tracy is cloyingly perky, annoying in her
desire to wield power when she can, ruthless and willing to step on
others in the pursuit of her own goals. Credit must be given to the
screenplay and to Witherspoon for bringing to life such a
multi-layered character. Witherspoon deftly keeps Tracy between being
too cute, and also keeps her from becoming simply malicious. Although
Tracy might not be a likable character, she is not as disagreeable as
Jim. While Jim is initially an involved and clearly inspiring teacher,
significant flaws in his character soon emerge. Jim's desires
eventually drive him to become as ruthless and selfish as Tracy.
The thought that Tracy will easily get what she wants, in terms of
becoming the President of the student counsel, bothers Jim. He decides
to encourage the injured football player, Paul Metzler (Chris Klein),
to also run for president. While Paul does not have the drive and
ambition of Tracy, he is a star athlete and a popular student, so
Tracy perceives a sudden threat to her desires.
The story ambitiously adds another dimension when Paul's sister Tammy
(Jessica Campbell) decides to run to spite her brother for a
transgression he is clueless about. Tammy runs on the platform of
apathy, saying that if she is elected she will do nothing, and this
strikes a chord with a large part of the student body. The election
will mean nothing to most students, but it will be cut-throat for a
few involved, and will suck in Jim also.
The film is note worthy in the number of characters it develops and
the number of subplots it connects. However, it could have done more
with the unidimensional Paul. Also, Paul's girlfriend Lisa (Frankie
Ingrassia), is given significant screen time, but is never developed
beyond existing as a plot device. The remaining characters, however,
are all substantially examined and presented believably. The story has
one glaring weaknesses, a key development that was a conveniently
sloppy mistake, where the offending character will obviously be
caught. However, the story as a whole is original and engaging.
Because the characters are given so many directions, it is not easy to
predict which direction the story will travel. At times the plot has
suspense and intrigue, and it is consistently filled with black humor.
Highly recommended. This is an entertaining film which strikes a
balance between comedy and drama. It strives to present complete
characters, and even succeeds in using main characters that are
identifyable, but not likable. The plot is engaging, and although it
telegraphs some key events, it still remains engrossing.

Every school has a student that is an overachiever.  The student strives day
and night to be better than everybody else, including their very own teachers. 
They are a part of every extra curricular activity you could ever imagine. 
Well, at Carver High School, Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is that student.
At Carver High School, it is time to have the elections for the officers of the
Student Council. Tracy Flick is running for president without anyone running
against her.  Mr. McAllister (Matthew Broderick), Tracy's wonderful teacher,
cannot stand the thought of having Tracy as the President of the Student
Council, so therefore he tries to find others to run against her.  He finds
injured football star Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) to run against her, only
because he has nothing else to do with his life, although he doesn't have any
idea what he is doing.  Deciding to run as well is Paul's younger,
unenthusiastic student Tammy, played by Jessica Campbell.  Tracy is absolutely
infuriated with the other nominees because they are reducing her chances to
win.
The election is only one part of the actual film though.  The second main plot
of the film deals with Mr. McAllister and his confusing, troubled life.  He has
so many different emotions in his head about school, his wife, having children,
cheating on his wife, and Tracy Flick.  This plot is much like what John Cusack
went through in the film Pushing Tin.  It is pretty ugly, un-fun, and
depressing material, but Broderick really shined in it.  Matthew Broderick has
almost completely annoyed me in every film he has ever been a part of, but in
Election, he actually did a wonderful job.  Hopefully, he will stay with the
more serious kind of film from now on.  It would do his career much good if he
got into more films such as Election, rather than terrible films like 1998's
Godzilla.
Reese Witherspoon brilliantly carries the entire weight of the film on her
shoulders.  She is absolutely perfect as Tracy Flick, creating the character in
a three dimensional sense.  This is the third film I have seen Reese in, and I
have loved her performances in all three.  In 1998's Pleasantville, she didn't
get to go very many places with her character, and in 1999's Cruel Intentions,
we didn't get to see her enough, but in Election, she gets to do exactly what
she is capable of doing.  Now I believe that Reese Witherspoon can play anyone
she wants to be.  Her characters are all so much different from each other, it
is amazing that she can play each one of them in a very realistic sense.
When Reese Witherspoon or Matthew Broderick aren't present making the film
great, we get outstanding supporting performances by newcomer Chris Klein and
Jessica Campbell.  Chris Klein's character is totally clueless and very funny,
and his sister is a total sarcastic brat which reminded me of a character from
a television show called "Daria."  I wish that we could have seen more of these
two hysterical characters rather than the depressing plot line of Mr.
McAllister losing everything he has in life. 
Election reminded me much of the 1998 surprise hit, Rushmore.  Tracy and Max
Fischer (played brilliantly by Jason Schwartzman in Rushmore) were both
complete over achievers, and both made me laugh extremely hard.  Tracy is a
very likable and unlikable character at the same time.  At times she can
disgust you with her lowness, and at times she can make you crack up when she
is the only one raising her hand in class all of the time.
Teen comedies have been the "big" thing lately, but I think that Election
really broke through that barrier.  Rather than using the same old jokes or the
same old plots, Election goes with a much more smart, original theme.  The type
of humor in Election is starting to be used more widely, and I truly love it. 
The comedy isn't as immature, but in many cases is directed towards adults. 
Election is truly a movie for teens and adults.  This factor may not seem too
impressive, but considering the films that have been coming out lately, such as
Ten Things I Hate About You or Jawbreaker, it would be considered a
masterpiece.
The Bottom Line- I elect this the best, funniest comedy in years.

Starring Matthew Broderick, Reese Witherspoon, Chris Klein. Rated R.
It comes as a walloping disappointment to moi that Election is being
actively marketed as the latest derivative teen flick. Derivative it
ain't, and it isn't a teen flick either, although mature teenagers are
likely to enjoy it. Instead it is a brilliant, biting satire about
crossing the very boundaries of dignity and sacrificing one's career for
something one believes in -- or thinks he believes in.
Matthey Broderick, whom I have never really appreciated as an actor (not
even in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, which I think deserves to be a
classic) finally takes a step in the direction of thespianism. He plays
Jim McCallister, an extraordinary teacher who truly loves his job, loves
his profession, loves his life. His legacy and image are virtually
unscathed, until the latest Student Council Election comes along. You
see, there's this girl named Tracy Flick. She's your perfect example of
a know-it-all over-achiever -- she's the kind of student that is often
the only one to know the answer, leaving the teacher desperately looking
for another student to call on. Tracy is a member of every committee
imaginable; she spends long hours and weekends working on school
projects.
McCallister loathes her with all his heart. Perhaps he is jealous,
perhaps he is simply annoyed by her, but either way when she runs
unopposed for Student Council President, he can't stand to see her win.
He dreads that someday someone like her will rule the country. He is
afraid to imagine what it will be like then. The only thing to do for
him, it seems, is to launch a counter campaign. He singles out Paul
Metzler, a good, popular, albeit slightly slow guy to run against Tracy.
Unfortunately his anger soon leads him to go much farther than that to
prevent Tracy Flick from becoming the next Student Council Prez.
If satire is simply a witty exaggeration of ordinary events, then this
is satire at its brightest. Besides being an effective political satire,
this can be viewed as an affectionate take on what can happen when a
student becomes the pet peeve of an important teacher. But underneath
this is also a serious movie, one about sacrifice and revenge and it
works like a gem, emotionally sincere as well as scathingly funny.
Broderick is brilliant; his character is unabashedly subversive but he
makes him touchingly and unsentimentally sympathetic as well. I look
forward to Broderick doing more movies like this one (unfortunately, his
next project is Inspector Gadget). Reese Witherspoon (Pleasantville) is
not quite as effective, but she does a decent job as well, although
realism isn't one of her strong points in this one.
Those who argue that Election is morally depraved because it puts the
perfectionist Tracy in a bad light are missing the point by a mile.
That's not what this movie is about. It's about anger, it's about
revenge, it's about obsession. Director Alexander Payne's movie is about
important and significant things, and is above and beyond caring whether
it offends a select group of people who have no reason to be offended.
I love this movie. It's a satire that blends hilarity with resonant (but
not overwhelming) moral statements. It's brutal, it's funny, it's
brilliant.

The appeal of this intelligent, witty social and political
satire should extend far beyond the teenage years. It's classified as
a "high school flick" because virtually all the characters are
students or teachers, but its sly intrigue should appeal to a
sophisticated young adult audience. Set in Nebraska at George
Washington Carver High, the story revolves around an aggressive and
loathsome young woman, Reese Witherspoon, who is running, unopposed,
for president of the student government. She's a cocky, irritating
over-achiever with a sizable chip on her shoulder, cast in the mold of
Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. Matthew Broderick, as a popular
faculty advisor, is so alarmed by her brazen determination that he
convinces a gentle but dumb super-jock (Chris Klein) to run against
her. Their rivalry becomes even more complicated when the jock's
younger sister (Jessica Campbell), a sophomore, declares her
candidacy, based on a promise to do nothing as student president but
abolish the idiocy of student government. It's a platform that seems
to have great appeal. Written by Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor, and
directed by Alexander Payne ("Citizen Ruth"), the theme is profound
cynicism about today's democratic process in which someone must be
ruthlessly ambitious, not to mention hypocritical, in order to win
votes and attain public office. Add to that a disdain for the state of
love, sex, and marriage in the '90s and you have a subversive,
wickedly clever premise which is fully realized by the artful
casting. Both Reese Witherspoon and Matthew Broderick are completely
believable in their parts, as are Chris Klein and Jessica Campbell. To
me, this comedy rings with malevolent teenage truth. On the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Election" scores an audacious, acerbic
8. It's a winner.

Every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio, with every
indication that it will be a stinker, and to everybody's surprise (perhaps
even the studio) the film becomes a critical darling.  MTV Films' _Election,
a high school comedy starring Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon, is a
current example.  Did anybody know this film existed a week before it
opened?
The plot is deceptively simple.  George Washington Carver High School is
having student elections.  Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is an
over-achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question, way, way, high.
Mr. "M" (Matthew Broderick), sick of the megalomaniac student, encourages
Paul, a popular-but-slow jock to run.  And Paul's nihilistic sister jumps in
the race as well, for personal reasons.
The dark side of such sleeper success is that, because expectations were so
low going in, the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even
more enthusiastic than they have any right to be.  You can't help going in
with the baggage of glowing reviews, which is in contrast to the negative
baggage that the reviewers were likely to have.  
_Election, a good film, does not live up to its hype.  
What makes _Election_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot
details lifted directly from _Rushmore_, released a few months earlier.  The
similarities are staggering:
Tracy Flick (_Election_) is the president of an extraordinary number of
clubs, and is involved with the school play.
Max Fischer (_Rushmore_) is the president of an extraordinary number of
clubs, and is involved with the school play.
The most significant tension of _Election_ is the potential relationship
between a teacher and his student.
The most significant tension of _Rushmore_ is the potential relationship
between a teacher and his student.
Tracy Flick is from a single parent home, which has contributed to her
drive.
Max Fischer is from a single parent home, which has contributed to his
drive.
The male bumbling adult in _Election_ (Matthew Broderick) pursues an
extramarital affair, gets caught, and his whole life is ruined.  He even
gets a bee sting.
The male bumbling adult in _Rushmore_ (Bill Murray) pursues an extramarital
affair, gets caught, and his whole life is ruined.  He gets several bee
stings.
And so on.  What happened?  How is it that an individual screenplay
(_Rushmore_) and a novel (_Election_) contain so many significant plot
points, and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other, made
from two different studios, from a genre (the high school geeks revenge
movie) that hadn't been fully formed yet?
Even so, the strengths of _Election_ rely upon its fantastic performances
from Broderick, Witherspoon, and newcomer Jessica Campbell, as Paul's
anti-social sister, Tammy. Broderick here is playing the Mr. Rooney role
from _Ferris Bueller_, and he seems to be having the most fun he's had since
then.  Witherspoon is a revelation.  It's early in the year, it's a comedy,
and teenagers have little clout, but for my money, Witherspoon deserves an
Oscar nomination. And once Campbell's character gets going, like in her
fantastic speech in the gymnasium, then you're won over.
One thing that's been bothering me since I've seen it.  There is an
extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film.  I suppose that, coming from
MTV films, I should expect no less... but the film starts off light and
airy, like a sitcom.  As the screws tighten, and the tensions mount,
Alexander Payne decides to add elements that, frankly, distract from the
story.  It is bad enough that Mr. M doesn't like Tracy's determination to
win at all costs, but did they have to throw in the student/teacher
relationship?  Even so, there's no logical reason why Mr. M has an affair
when he does.  
There's a lot to like in _Election_, but the plot similarities to
_Rushmore_, and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly
sex-driven, mark this as a disappointment.

DIR: ALEXANDER PAINE
Maybe consciously I was simply avoiding any film with even the vaguest
hint of cyber-anything. Or perhaps unconsciously I'm hopelessly stuck
on titles that begin with the letter "E" (as in last week's review of
"Entrapment"). Whatever the case, I'm not the least bit sorry I chose
to duck in out of the sun and catch a  Saturday afternoon matinee of
"Election."
Senior Tracy Flick (Witherspoon) is the reigning Miss Apple Pie of the
Free World. Everything she wants, she pretty much gets. And everything
she gets, she pretty much deserves. So, getting elected president of
the student body should be little more challenging than copping a
smoke in the girls room in between third and fourth period.
At least that's the way she sees it.
Of course, being quite the perfect specimen (she's the type who on at
least one occasion probably wore her 4-H ribbons pinned to her
cardigan for school pictures), she's got ten perfect little toes, all
of which are just waiting to be stepped on.
Enter Jim McAllister (Broderick), three-time educator of the year and
student council advisor. He's got a wife he can't seem to get
pregnant, lust in his heart for the divorcee who lives across the
street, an aging Ford Festiva (one of the greatest self-esteem killing
auto designs in the history of motorized transportation), and a
nascent disgust with Ms. Flick.
Expect the shenanigans to begin momentarily.
When the Man Who Was Once Ferris declares war, you suddenly realize
you're in for one heck of an interesting ride. Director/co-writer
Payne and cast absolutely bond to create one of the more piercing
satires in recent memory. The script is so streamlined that it's no
less than positively aerodynamic. Not a single moment isn't accounted
for as the pieces of the puzzle come together. Big laughs emerge from
around unexpected corners. The allegory at hand is firmly anchored by
a foundation so sturdy it must have been constructed by union labor.
Not to mention the casting director deserves no less than a State
Dinner at the White House.
Witherspoon is so perfect as Flick that at one point I feared she
might slap me upside the head with an apple pie. The shear depth of
her unctuousness will forever make you think twice about accepting a
complimentary cupcake from anyone less than your best friend. If she
burst into tears within earshot, you'd cross a street during rush hour
without looking both ways to offer her a shoulder to cry on. As
student body president, she would undoubtedly wield enough power to
convince the lot of us to chuck pizza and pay more attention to
getting in our three squares a day.
Broderick thoroughly becomes quite the slightly downtrodden
proletarian next door. But  the moment he senses his big chance to
really "make a difference," that malicious demeanor he perfected all
those years ago as Ferris Bueller takes on a whole new dimension.
While it's safe to say all the characters here are somewhat flawed in
character, he is in many ways the most believable.
The rest of the cast is filled out mostly by first-timers and
unknowns. Chris Klein as a Keanu Reeves Jr. clone more than proves
that a thoroughly vapid aptitude shouldn't stop one from running for
office. Jessica Campbell as his sister, the third candidate in the run
for the roses, clearly illustrates that getting a little political
during your tender sophomore year really isn't a bad thing--especially
if having vaguely diabolical leanings are an integral part of your
fabric. And finally, Phil Reeves as the hapless
ringmaster--er--principal... No need to say more here; he's a walking
laugh factory.
Payne and collaborator Jim Taylor have successfully mined the fields
of political satire once before with "Citizen Ruth" (1996), which I
coincidentally just caught on video a couple weeks ago. While that
little morality tale about the tug-of-war between pro-life and
pro-choice fronts was entertaining enough, it was in many ways more
interesting than effective. "Election" is quite the quantum step
forward.
For all practical purposes, "Election" is a civics lesson with one big
advantage over your rank-and-file lesson plan; it's built-in fun
factor is actually worth dropping a few bucks to check out.

28th September 1999: The Watershed, Bristol 
Election tells the story of Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon), a Nebraskan
high-school student who is brilliant and hard-working, and who takes
part in all manner of worthy student activities. She is a perfect
student - prim, chirpy, and ambitious. And her teacher, Jim McAllister
(Matthew Broderick) has had just about enough of her - he is not an
ambitious man, is quite happy with his simple life and finds Tracy's
intensity very wearing. 
The high-school election for President of the student body is about to
take place, and although Tracy is so far the only candidate, she
conducts a businesslike campaign with drive and efficiency. Mr.
McAllister doesn't like the idea of having Tracy as the student
President, so he arranges for a rival candidate to enter the election.
Soon, a third candidate throws her hat into the ring. Tracy is not best
pleased. As the election campaign progresses, things take a bad turn in
Mr. McAllister's private life, and he becomes inclined to take his
frustration out on Tracy by scuppering her ambition. 
Matthew Broderick is not a heavyweight actor, but he does a fine job
here as an underachieving teacher haunted by an overachieving pupil. But
the film belongs to the ever-excellent Reese Witherspoon, who is fast
establishing a reputation as one of the finest young actresses around.
Her performance as Tracy Flick is simply magical, stealing every scene
she's in. And when Miss Flick lets rip with one of her outraged, tight-
lipped scowls, take cover - those nostrils are so scary they could
curdle milk at thirty paces.
Simply but effectively directed by Alexander Payne, who also co-write
the snappy and witty screenplay with Jim Taylor (from Tom Perrotta's
novel), Election is a high-school comedy drama, a political satire and a
study of jealousy and the price of ambition. It's quite disheartnening
that Election wasn't distributed more widely here in the UK. I can't
imagine anyone not enjoying this film and it deserved a shot at the
multiplex audience. It's a gem of a movie and is my film of the year so
far.

It is 1999, and America, for the most part, is tired of politics. In
1998, the year of the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal, we had 3 political
comedies: PRIMARY COLORS, WAG THE DOG and BULWORTH. This year, we have
the unlikely teenage political satire ELECTION, which is the first
mildly ambitious film from the folks at MTV Films, but even that
cannot fully save the movie itself.
Matthew Broderick plays Jim McAllister, 3-time Teacher of the Year at
Carver High School. As you may have guessed from the title, it is the
time of year for student council elections. The only presidential
candidate is Tracy Flick(Reese Witherspoon), an ambitious
goody-two-shoes who takes the election quite seriously.
But Mr. McAllister has his second thoughts about Tracy. A couple years
before, Tracy had been carrying on an affair with a teacher at the
school(Mark Harelik), who happened to be McAllister's close family
friend. When the news broke out, the teacher's wife, Linda(Delaney
Driscoll), filed for divorce immediately, and since then,
Mr. McAllister has been constantly with her, helping her run errands
while Mrs. McAllister(Molly Hagan) helps her take care of her son.
Mr. McAllister is just dying to to take his friendship with Linda to
an adulterous level.
So, that seems to be a basic motive for Mr. McAllister to want to
sabotage Tracy's election campaign. And the battle begins. The first
pawn that he throws her way is Paul Metzler(Chris Klein), who was the
school's quarterback until he broke his leg in a skiing accident. He
doesn't really care too much about running, but Mr. McAllister seems
to inspire him enough. Paul has no hard feelings for Tracy, and
infact, he wants her to win. But Tracy feels nothing but genuine rage
for McAllister.
Then, there is Tammy Metzler(Jessica Campbell), Paul's younger sister
who just happens to be a lesbian. After her best friend/lover starts
gettin' jiggy with Paul, Tammy declares all-out war, and becomes a
nominee herself. She feels that people shouldn't vote at all in this
phony election.
Sound familiar? Probably, if you've ever followed a real election
campaign, which ELECTION attemps to satirize. Director Alexander Payne
is no stranger to satire. He made the abortion comedy CITIZEN
RUTH. And ELECTION, his latest film, is a very smart, very funny, very
witty satire itself. But the problem lies in the characters. The only
marginally likable character is Paul Metzler, and this guy's a
dumbass.
Reese Witherspoon, who should remind many of a young Holly Hunter, is
one of the finest young actresses working today, but her character
isn't given any attractive or likable qualities. That is not to say
that this isn't one of her better performances; I just wish she had a
role that would let her do more. And as for Matthew Broderick, why oh
why? Forget FERRIS BUELLER; Matthew Broderick is a bad, bad actor, and
his performance in ELECTION proves my point exactly. And to have to
listen to all this voice-over whining makes the film bad enough.
To all the critics who said Max Fischer in RUSHMORE was unlikable, I
ask you to think a little bit about the characters in ELECTION. But,
needless to say, if ELECTION was trying to prove a point that all
politicians are unlikable, they have got that job done. But after the
presidential scandal of 1998, did we really need any more proof of
that fact?

     This is how I know I'm dealing with a film of uncommon intelligence:
ELECTION resists the tidy summations in which most films are all-too-eager
to wrap themselves.  Like many recent films, it is a comedy set in a high
school, but it's more than just the latest high school comedy.  It deals
with a student body election, but it's not really _about_ a student body
election.  It's a film in which characters narrate much of the story, but
it doesn't use that narration in a conventional way.  Like director
Alexander Payne's previous film CITIZEN RUTH -- if to a somewhat less
successful degree -- ELECTION is a satirical scalpel that refuses to let
you know exactly when or whom it's going to cut.
     It's spring at Omaha, Nebraska's Carver High School as ELECTION
begins, which means it's time for elections for the next year's student
body officers.  The prime candidate -- and apparently _only_ candidate --
for student body president is Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon), an
extracurricular machine who sees the office as her destiny.  Seeing things
a bit differently is Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick), a civics teacher
and student government advisor that Tracy rubs the wrong way.  In an
attempt to make the election less of a foregone conclusion, McAllister
convinces injured football hero Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) to mount a
challenge, which in turn generates the "third party" candidacy of Paul's
alienated younger sister Tammy.
     It would have been easy enough for ELECTION to turn into a broad
comedy about adolescent peer politics, and it _still_ would have been more
insightful than most teen comedies.  Payne and co-writer Jim Taylor, 
working from Tom Perrotta's novel, have bigger targets in mind.  They use
the Carver High election as a microcosm not just of high school life, but
of politics on a much grander scale.  Tracy Flick's campaign casts her as
a political cousin of our current president, seeking election as a "you
really like me" validation rathern than out of a desire to serve; even her
nomination speech parrots the naming-of-names, I-feel-your-pain personal
touch.  Tammy, meanwhile, rallies the disenfranchised minority behind the
idea that nothing changes but the names in conventional governance.  Even
the ridiculous posters, filled with little more than sloganeering, seem
disturbingly similar to national election campaigning.  It's savvy,
cynical, and very funny.
     Even more effective is Payne's use of that old literary device the
"unreliable narrator" as counterpoint to his direction.  McAllister,
Tracy, Paul and Tammy take turns explaining their take on the events of
the film, each one mouthing words that don't quite match their his or her 
actions.  McAllister describes his personal and professional contentment
as he sifts through a trunk full of pornography; sexually-confused Tammy
explains that "I'm not a lesbian, I'm attracted to the _person_.  It's
just that all the people I've been attracted to have been girls;" Tracy
describes her mother's actions on her behalf in a way that shows she's
being programmed for greatness.  Only Paul, perhaps too dense to be
duplicitous, seems pure of heart.  As he did in CITIZEN RUTH, Payne
explores the way we convince ourselves that our motivations are pure, even
when we don't really understand what our motivations are.
     If Payne stumbles anywhere, it's in his choice to focus much of the
film's second half on McAllister's domestic troubles.  Tammy's character
in particular is abandoned by this choice, letting the school
administration's reaction to her unconventional candidacy off the hook too
easily.  But ELECTION is too smart to be derailed by this problem, too
clear-eyed in its study of good intentions muddled by psychological
baggage.  With surprising sympathy towards all his flawed characters,
Alexander Payne creates a furiously funny film in which his surrealistic
directing touches keep the audience off-guard.  He understands that in a
world where people can't even summarize themselves in a neat-and-tidy
sentence, we can't expect to summarize the movies about them that way.

Don't let outward appearances make you lump _Election_ with such shoddy
teen-targeted product as _She's_All_That_ and _10_Things_I_Hate_About_You_.
 Despite a cast largely comprised of young adults and an MTV Productions
pedigree, adults will be the ones to truly appreciate the satirical sting
of Alexander Payne's hilarious high school comedy.
The "election" in question is that of student body president at George
Washington Carver High School in Omaha, Nebraska.  Ambitious Tracy Flick
(Reese Witherspoon) seems to be a shoo-in, and rightfully so; not only is
she insanely dedicated to her civic duty at Carver, she is also unopposed
in the race.  That is, until well-liked student government advisor Jim
McAllister (Matthew Broderick) taps injured football star Paul Metzler
(Chris Klein) to put some excitement into the race and throw his hat into
the ring.  Not too long after that, Paul's younger sister Tammy (Jessica
Campbell) follows suit, and Tracy becomes even more doggedly determined to
secure what she feels is her destiny.
>From that synopsis, _Election_ sounds like typical teen fodder.  However,
I neglected to factor in some of the wonderfully warped wrinkles that Payne
throws in.  Tracy, it turns out, had a torrid affair with a now-fired
teacher who was McAllister's best friend; Tammy decides to run after an
ex-girlfriend (yes, she is a lesbian) redirects her affections toward Paul.
 It may seem as if I have divulged some plot surprises, but I haven't given
away anything that isn't covered within the first half hour (at the most).
That Payne can use outrageous twists such as those as a mere starting point
is a testament to his diabolically witty imagination.
Payne's dark comic vision is given pitch-perfect life by his actors.
Witherspoon commands the film as terrible Tracy; her incongruous blend of
wholesome all-American looks and relentless, often maniacal ambition is not
only funny, it's quite scary.  The two unknowns playing her challengers,
Klein and Campbell, similarly strike no false notes; their assigned
territory is ditziness and ballsy attitude, respectively, and they are
right on target.  What does strike a false note, though, is a domestic
subplot given to Broderick's character; while he does a convincing job as a
whole, he can't redeem a thread involving McAllister's marriage.  It fails
too hook as strongly as the high school action simply because the writing
isn't as inspired.
That misstep doesn't prevent _Election_ from being the most biting youth
comedy in recent memory.  It is the film that _10_Things_I_Hate_About_You_
claimed, but failed, to be--a dark, wildly entertaining romp that wears its
cynicism on its sleeve and sees no reason wash any of it off.

Driscoll, Colleen Camp, Frankie Ingrassia
   "Election" takes place in a high school but is not a
teen flick.  Directed by Alexander Payne and written by
Payne and fellow satirist Jim Taylor, "Election" uses the
setting of a secondary school in Omaha, Nebraska as a
parable of life in America; specifically, about the craving that
Americans have to succeed at all costs and the emptiness
that triumph can bring to people who neglect other aspects of
their lives.  Its creators imply that what really counts are
genuine friendship, true love, and modesty.  As the song
goes, "It's fine to be a genius of course,/ but keep that old
horse before the cart,/ First you've gotta have heart."
   Being the fine satirists that they are, Payne and Taylor--
whose well-cast 1996 film "Citizen Ruth" was also about the
depraved nature of fanaticism--is never didactic.  We do not
feel we are receiving a lesson when we watch this ingenious
piece, which is so well written and wonderfully acted that its
comic moments come across unforced.  You may go away
from this sparkling picture resolved (at least for a day or so)
to take yourself just a trifle less seriously while putting your
ambition in perspective. Given regular reinforcement of other
such films, you may wind up staying around on this earth a
mite longer, enjoying yourself more, and cultivating a more
sensible outlook on your life.  That's quite a return on your
eight dollars, but then, "Election" is not your ordinary
Saturday night at the pictures.
   This is not to say that the country's economy would grind
to a halt if we all absorbed Payne and Taylor's purport.  One
character in the movie, Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), does
become successful in gaining the school office that he seeks-
-if only for a day or so--and he achieves his prominence while
holding on to his modesty, his popularity, and his guileless
aw-shucks attitude.  "Election" is a spirited teen-dominated
film that throws spitballs at Americans unlike Paul-- who will
step on everyone in their way to gain power, who rigidly insist
that their hard work signifies the correctness of their vision. 
Director Taylor levels his feature at nothing less than
America's Puritan heritage, at the conviction that celebrity,
riches and power will assure its adherents a place in heaven
among God's elect.
   "Election" centers on two people; Jim McAllister (Matthew
Broderick), a popular social studies teacher in his late thirties
who acts as adviser to student government, and Tracy Flick
(Reese Witherspoon), a junior with an unwholesome impact
on her teacher's life.  There's a Tracy in every high school: in
the movie "Rushmore," her protege would be Max Fischer
(Jason Schwartzman), an overachiever who takes charge of
virtually every extracurricular activity and, with his romantic
pursuit of one of his school's instructors, appraises himself an
adult.  Tracy's is the hand that is always raised while others
in the class are stymied.  Her drive is all-encompassing
enough to seduce her geometry teacher, Dave Novotny (Mark
Harelik), thereby ruining his career.  Her vigor and
aggressiveness have adverse effects on Jim McAllister, who
has been unable to get his wife pregnant and who is
becoming increasingly irritated with his spouse's quirks. 
Though McAllister is smart enough, there are times that we
think young Tracy knows more about him than he is aware of
himself.  Despite his popularity (he has been selected
teacher-of-the-year three times, a school record), Tracy feels
sorry for him: after all, he teaches the same subject year
after year, and what person of reasonable faculties would not
climb the walls after drawing a chalkboard diagram of the
legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government for
the seventy-fifth time?  Tracy's vital sense of life becomes a
malevolent influence on Jim, who will eventually
self-destruct--though in ways far more comical than you
would imagine.
   The story is told with extensive narration, mostly in
flashback, and centers on a school election.  When no-one
dares oppose the willful Tracy, McAllister is determined to
thwart her drive to the top student office.  He recruits a
popular athlete, Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), a lad who is none
too bright but who has high regard for McAllister and
reluctantly agrees to run.  The fun swells when Paul's lesbian
sister, Tammy Metzler (Jessica Campbell) enters the race, a
friendless youngster whose popularity soars when she
declares that if elected, she would dismantle student
government permanently so that "we would never have to go
to another stupid election assembly."  Had the film not been
blessed by marvelous leading performances, Ms. Campbell
could have stolen the show.  Without for a moment expressly
intending to be amusing, she brings down the house with her
genuinely felt anarchism, though she can be touching as well
when her love for another young woman goes unrequited.
   Best of all is Reese Witherspoon--at 23 years of age a fast-
rising star currently on the cover of trendy magazines like
TimeOutNY. She knocks out a trenchant performance as a
17-year-old who thinks she has it all but deep in her soul
realizes that she is missing life's most important reward: the
sincere affection of her peers.  Matthew Broderick comes on
wonderfully as well as a kind of Willy Loman. Though unlike
Arthur Miller's creation this Jim McAllister is confident of his
choice of profession, he shares Willy's unawareness of the
kind of man he really is. Throughout the story we are
cognizant of some inner adversary that gnaws at his essence
far more profoundly than the bee which lands on his eyelid
while he is visiting a momentary lover and creates an ugly
bump with its stinger. Because "Election" is so well acted, so
probing, directed with such a laid-back hand by a man with a
perfect sense of comic timing, this movie is right up there
with such terrific accomplishments as Todd Solondz's equally
satiric classics, "Happiness" and "Welcome to the Dollhouse."

Paramount, MTV Films, Rated R (some sexuality and related dialogue, some
graphic language), 105 Minutes. Reese Witherspoon, Matthew Broderick, Chris
Klein. Screenplay by Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor. Directed by Alexander
Payne.
(Note: There are spoilers regarding the film's climax; the election, of course)
We see Matthew Broderick, a man torn to a primal state; he's been unfaithful
to his wife, lied to and manipulated his students,  and by the same token
they've demeaned his masculinity, his self-respect, his desperate attempt at
changing the world. And yet, he equates the cause of his pain, his torment,
with Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon). No matter how many students have come and
gone, and disappointed him as an educator, she's the real threat. About to
give in, and divulge that she's won by only a lone vote, Broderick's
McCalister turns in defeat, sees Tracy's euphoric celebration in the outside
corridor and says, 'No'. The fact that he simultaneously lusts after her
ideologically further illustrates that Freudian foundation of entitlement which
all men, no matter how obscure, have in their relationships; a traditional
expectation of success, to usurp and surpass women as a proverbial industry.
She can't go higher than him. He won't allow it.
And what's amazing about "Election" is that every word of that criticism is
drawn from a rather opaque metaphor. Early in the film we learn that Tracy was
romantically, and then sexually, involved with a now departed teacher. It's
like Payne and Taylor, his co-screenwriter, have taken Tracy, a girl desperate
for friendship, loyalty, and almost perversely drawn the mythological pattern
of kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers, that they found sitting at
the teachers' lunch table more fitting, to an unlikely extreme with her as
the protagonist. And it's amazing the compassion that we have; it seems so
real to us, and not merely because it's happened before, splashed all over
the front pages, but, because of the all around "nice" persona of these people,
we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters. It's with Mandy
Barnett's "If You'll be The Teacher" playing winsomely over the closing
credits that Payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most; a final, viscous
injection of bittersweet irony.
Sexuality, though, is not the only basis for Payne's satire, or its success.
It also makes a telling point about politics, friendship, and class boundaries.
Satire is required (or ought to be, anyway) to take itself seriously, or act
so, while the audience does not. It's a fine line to straddle, but some films
ignore it altogether ("Drop Dead Gorgeous" leaps infuriatingly to mind). Payne
and Taylor hit the right chord; their characters are real people: neither is
perfect, but rather both of the leads are flawed, misguided individuals who
retain, somewhat, noble intentions at heart. We sympathize with them, but
still, as a satire, their idiosyncratic behavior, and their wrongdoing, is
taken to an extreme for the audience to knowingly chuckle, but also reflect and
meditate, about.
Minus half a point, though, for Payne admitting not to having seen "Ferris
Bueller's Day Off". Whatever.

ELECTION (M).  
(Paramount/MTV Films/UIP)
Director: Alexander Payne
Stars: Matthew Broderick, Reese Witherspoon, Chris Klein, Jessica 
Campbell, Colleen Camp, Matt Molloy, Holmes Osborne.
Yet another teenage comedy set in an American high school!
However this razor sharp and biting comedy about the politics of high
school has much more in common with the recent anarchic Rushmore
rather than more vacuous and light weight films like She's All That
and its ilk.  Election is also everything that the somewhat
disappointing Rushmore aspired to be but failed to achieve.
This smartly written and archly funny black comedy is set in
Omaha's Carver High School.  Tracey Flick (Reese Witherspoon, from
Pleasantville, etc) is the sort of ambitious overachiever who makes
Rushmore's Max Fischer seem positively half hearted.  She is involved
in every conceivable school activity and is possessed with a ruthless
win-at-all-costs streak.
Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick, the original Ferris
Bueller) is a career teacher and student advisor, who has devoted all
his energies and time to guiding his students.  He has thrice been
voted teacher of the year, a record at Carver High.  But there is
something about the compulsive, not so naive Tracey that this popular
and dedicated teacher dislikes with a passion.  When she stands
unopposed for the presidency, McAllister decides to teach her a
lesson, with unpredictable results for all concerned.
He convinces popular but dim-witted jock Paul Metzler (Chris
Klein, in a role not too dissimilar to the one he recently played in
the raunchy adolescent comedy American Pie) to run against her.
Further complications arise when Paul's angry, alienated lesbian
sister Tammy (Jessica Campbell) also mounts her own campaign, although
she has no real interest in the politics of the school, or in Carver
itself.
As the increasingly vicious campaign and the dirty tricks hot
up, the lines between right and wrong become blurred.  McAllister's
lectures about morals and ethics resonate ironically throughout the
rest of the film as he tries to subvert the democratic process and
prevent Tracey from winning the election.  Meanwhile, McAllister's
personal life becomes increasingly confused, which leads to him making
even more costly errors of judgement.
Broderick slowly but surely trashes his good guy screen image
with his wonderful performance as the increasingly desperate and
sleazy McAllister.  Witherspoon is also superb in a complex role, as
her perfectly angelic looks hide a spiteful, wilful and vengeful
disposition.
 
Election is a smart, vicious and often subversive comedy that
looks at morality, ethics, ambition, greed, destiny and power
politics.  Writer/director Alexander Payne uses a clever, multi-first
person narrative structure to give the audience insights into the
different motivations and attitudes of the characters.
Is McAllister merely driven by a sense of frustration, knowing
that he is a teacher who will shape and inspire his students while the
more talented and ambitious of his charges will graduate and chase
their share of the American dream?  Is Tracey that sort of person who
always seeks power and personal glory, oblivious to those she tramples
over on the way to the top?  The nicely ironic epilogue goes some way
to answering these questions and providing a neat moral to this comic
fable.

1999 - 103 minutes
Rated R (for sexual situations and profanity).
Reviewed May 8, 1999.
Well, who would have thunk it? After an endless stream of mostly 
predictable and cliched movies set in high school in the last year, one 
has finally come along that is amazingly so precise, so hilarious, so 
biting, so smart, so perfect, in every one of its minute details that it 
comes as a sort of godsend. Its name is "Election," it's directed by 
Alexander Payne (1996's "Citizen Ruth"), and it, no doubt, will go down 
as one of the very best films of 1999.
Set at Omaha's Carver High School during the election for student 
council, the film imaginatively is narrated by all four of the main 
characters so that we can learn and understand the innerworkings of 
their minds, even when they are saying the opposite of the actions they 
are making. Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick, coming full circle from 
his role in 1986's classic "Ferris Bueller's Day Off") is the school's 
most popular teacher, a guy who has won the Best Teacher Award for three 
years running and who shows up at school nice and early each day. 
Friendly to (almost) all of his pupils, the one student who manages to 
get under his skin so much that he can't stand her is overachieving 
senior Tracey Flick (Reese Witherspoon), currently running unopposed for 
school president. If you're old enough to have experienced high school, 
you've definately run into someone like Tracey. She's the "perfect" 
student, a person who seems friendly to everyone even though you can see 
through their thin facade; a person who constantly raises their hand in 
class and knows every answer to every question; and a person who you 
know, no matter what, is going to achieve everything that he or she 
strives for in life. It's just Mr. McAllister's luck, then, that he 
happens to also run the student elections and, determined to cause 
Tracey to lose just one thing in her life, he convinces naively cheerful 
football jock, Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), who has recently broken his 
leg in a skiing accident, to run against her for president. Altough at 
first hesitant, Paul quickly grows eager to join the race, causing 
Tracey to grow outraged. For her, this means war. But that's not all; in 
a plot twist whose particulars should be discovered on your own, Paul's 
younger, rebellious sister, Tammy (Jessica Campbell), a sophomore, also 
enters into the race, causing a three-way tug-of-war between Tammy, who 
poses to the students that she doesn't even care if she wins the 
election, and as president, won't do anything; Paul, who is joyous just 
to be in the running; and dear, dear Tracey, who will go to any length 
possible to ensure her ultimate defeat.
Reading the premise, "Election" may sound like "just another teen 
flick," but it isn't by a long shot, and is in its masterful treatment 
that it succeeds so highly. I can assure you there is no climax set at 
the prom, and the story doesn't cowardly degenerate into a romance 
concerning which guy gets the girl. No, what "Election" is is a 
brilliantly articulated satire, a "high school" movie that is probably 
targeted more towards adults, but that all thoughtful teens will greatly 
appreciate as a much-needed diversion from all of those sugar-coated 
teen fantasies that have assaulted the multiplex in recent months. 
Although "about" a high school election, it gradually grows clear that 
telling such a simple, clear-cut story isn't director Payne's 
intentions. Not only is there a heavy dosage of narration by the four 
principle characters, but the film also isn't always told 
chronologically, as each plot thread is carefully and delightfully torn 
away to not only create a more meaningful motion picture, but also one 
that has something to say about loneliness. Through the big, sly laughs 
that the film creates, it is revealed that each of the characters are 
lonely, in their own certain way, and we are taken into each one of 
their lives to learn just why they are the way they are.
For example, we eventually find that Jim McAllister is obviously 
unhappily married (even though he says during narration that his wife is 
"his source of strength"). When his buddy and a fellow teacher, Dave 
Novotny (Mark Harelik), is fired for having a sexual relationship with 
one of his students, Jim grows closer to Dave's solemn wife, spending 
more and more time with her and convincing himself that he loves her, 
not realizing that it isn't love that draws them together, but 
desperation. Jim's life is a monotonous and dull routine, as he goes to 
school, teaches the same things over day after day, and then goes home 
to the same woman that he has been married to for nine years. Certainly 
a lot of people have this sort of life, but Jim needs more. Matthew 
Broderick, who has fallen on hard times in recent years (1997's 
"Addicted to Love," 1998's "Godzilla"), has revitalized his career with 
"Election," and has, indeed, given his strongest, most gratifying 
performance since "Ferris Bueller" thirteen years ago. We don't just see 
his sadness, we feel it.
Matching Broderick in every way is Reese Witherspoon, maybe the most 
talented actress under 25 working today, who has never been better. It 
would be criminal to see her flawless, nuanced, and hilarious 
performance get snubbed of an Oscar nomination come next year. 
Witherspoon transforms herself so completely into the heart, soul, and 
body of Tracey that it will be difficult from now on to distinguish the 
two personalities, although she is so wonderful in every film that she 
should have no trouble doing just that. In the character of Tracey 
Flick, we have also been given one of the most distinguished and 
memorable characters I've probably ever seen in my years of 
film-watching. She is the type of girl who you really shouldn't like at 
all. She's perky, she's unblemished, she's successful, but she is also 
so desperate and determined to be a winner that you can't help but feel 
genuinely sorry for her when things don't go her way. Like Jim 
McAllister, no matter what feats Tracey seems to triumph over she 
remains a lonely person without any actual friends. In a couple brief 
scenes involving her paralegal mother (Colleen Camp), we get a few hints 
as to what made Tracey the way she is. Although loving, her mother 
strives for the same exact great success as Tracey.
Chris Klein and Jessica Campbell, two film newcomers, also fit neatly 
into their respective roles. Klein is probably the most completely 
likable character in the film, as his Paul comes off as always innocent, 
even after we see him doing several arguably negative things, because he 
is so unintelligible and dense that he never really comprehends the 
things he's doing. There's no denying, however, that Paul has a big 
heart, and he cares about others. Jessica Campbell turns in a touching 
performance as the outsider, Tammy, who is torn apart when the girl she 
loves breaks up with her. "I'm not really a lesbian, though," Tammy 
reassures. "It just so happens that so far all of the people I have been 
attracted to have been girls."
If "She's All That" is "'Pygmalion' set in a high school" and "10 Things 
I Hate About You" is "'The Taming of the Shrew' set in a high school," 
"Election" is "'Fargo' set in a high school," and out of the three the 
latter is definately the highest honor. We don't necessarily watch 
"Election" as much as we absorb every single second of its constant 
entertainment and pleasures, excited to find out where it will lead us. 
Of technical note, the music score by Rolfe Tent is distinct and often 
even gains laughs because of its frightening perfection, sort of like 
Tracey herself. Writers Payne and Jim Taylor have fashioned one of the 
most fresh and original screenplays to come along in some time, as it 
never condescends to any of its potential audience members, whether it 
be adults or teens. "Election" is a dazzling dark comedy, clear in both 
tone and substance, and has the ability to be rib-tickling one moment 
and poignant the next, all the while never losing sight of its 
truthfulness and courage. In a week when "The Mummy" will unfairly be 
the #1 movie in America, making tens of millions of dollars, "Election" 
is the real deal, and now that it is in wide release, make it an effort 
to go out and see this sure-to-be classic as soon as humanly possible.

Here's a movie that raises a question of ethics (or is it morals). Either
way, the film steps all over such ideals, perhaps in hopes of redefining
them. Appropriately, it ended up poking me with an ethical dilemma: a film
with such excellent direction, acting, dialogue and humor, deserves high
marks from a reviewer; but my own sense of morality (regarding it's subject
matter) is holding me back from giving it the grade.
Allow me to clarify. The director of "Election" pays so close attention to
detail that he makes you feel like you're a participant in the film. The
timing of the editing is flawless. The script's dialogue is completely real,
riddled with the knocks and pings of everyday, high school population
stutters and stops. The acting ... appropriately straight on the money. And
it's funny. I was laughing, we were all laughing.
When Miss senior over-achiever discovers that her plans to become class
president are being challenged ... her prissy face loses it's smile and a
primal scream rings out over her closed mouth expression.
But the topic isn't just the election, it's infidelity and statutory rape
for starters -- involving students and/or teachers. Perhaps I'm not alone
when I say that kind of thing makes me feel uncomfortable. Don't get me
wrong -- I'm okay with being uncomfortable during part of a film --
especially if it's an investment toward a larger goal. But, I felt
uncomfortable for nearly the duration of this tremendously well put together
piece. Nor, did I feel resolved about it at the end. So, I think you see the
dilemma.
I'm going to be weak. I'm going to let my intangible, perhaps unjustifiable
feelings regarding specifically the touchy topics, prevent me from giving it
an 'A'. Forgive me.
Starring Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon.

 Election (1999) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Reese Witherspoon, Matthew
Broderick, Chris Klein and Jessica Campbell.
 One of the pleasures of movie reviewing is watching a film that arrives
unannounced and charms you with its humor and originality.
 Such "sleepers" as "Fargo" and "The Full Monty" fit snugly into this
category. And now you can add "Election," an askewed look at the polemics
of high school politics.
 Everyone of us knows a Tracy Flick. That's the student who always raises
his or her hand first, always knowing right answer; the one who cheerfully
organizes the car wash to raise the money to fund the prom, the one who is
destined to be student body president and lead the school to glory.
 We all know a Tracy Flick - and most of us hated her - or him. OK, maybe
hate is too strong. Jealous, envious. We admired that student's ease and
self-confidence around others while cursing our own tongue-tied
inadequacies.
 At George Washington Carver High School, Tracy Flick is the classic
overachiever, a bright, perky go-getter whose ambition is to be student
government president. And it looks like she will succeed, since she is
running unopposed.
 Jim McAllister is a much beloved, veteran civics teacher at Carver. He has
been on the faculty for 12 years and has been recognized three times as
"Teacher of the Year."
 And he decides that Tracy must be stopped. He sees her treating high
school as the first step in a lifelong career strategy that could take her
to unimaginable heights.
He also knows Tracy's dark secret. She had an affair with his best friend,
a teacher who lost his job after their romance became public.
 So McAllister recruits Paul Metzger, a dim-witted, but nice, popular
football hero sidelined by an injury to run against her.
 Paul is totally unfit for the job, completely in the dark about student
government, but McAllister convinces him that it's his civic duty to run.
 The situation gets even wilder when Paul's younger sister, Tammy - seeking
revenge on the girlfriend who dumped her and began dating her brother -
enters the race on a platform of abolishing student government.
 Soon life in and out of school begin spinning out of control for
McAllister as his plans go awry.
 "Election" is a satirical joy, due mainly to the performances of Reese
Witherspoon as Tracy, Matthew Broderick as McAllister, Chris Klein as Paul
and, especially, Jessica Campbell as Tammy.
 Witherspoon's Tracy is bubbly and gushing to the point of nausea. Her
Tracy is one of those students who treats others as if they were her serfs.
She may be all smiles and dimples on the outside, but underneath she rages
and burns with ambition and intolerance for those who do not live up to her
standards.
 Broderick's deadpan performance is one of low-key desperation, as his
various plots to thwart Tracy continue to be upended.
 Klein is sincere as the friendly doofus who, unlike Tracy, does not see
the election as a life-and-death struggle.
 Campbell's Tammy is sarcastic and brutally honest. Her best moment comes
during the assembly where the candidates give their campaign speeches. She
rallies the students by pointing out the hyprocisy of the system and the
ineffectual role of student government, calling for its abolition.
 What really sets "Election" apart is the voice-over narrations by the
various principals, especially when - at times - what they are saying is in
counterpoint to the action on the screen.
 The script by Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor, based on a novel by Tom
Perrotta, could be seen as an allegory of our democratic process, but I'd
rather not be that pretentious.
 I look at "Election" like that blind date that turned out to be the most
fabulous night of your life. It's a sharp, funny and entertaining movie
that will keep you laughing from the opening reel to the closing credits.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Matthew Broderick's character in the new Alexander Payne (Citizen Ruth)
comedy could be an adult version of Ferris Bueller.  Sure, we don't want
to think about the carefree Ferris turning into Election's popular high
school teacher Jim McAllister, but you almost can't help it.
McAllister is a mélange of every educator you've ever had  dingy
short-sleeved oxford shirt, bad tie, brown shoes, tiny Ford Festiva, and
a genuine love of teaching.  Despite winning George Washington Carver
High's `Teacher of the Year' a record three times in his twelve-year
tenure, McAllister still has one major Achilles heel that ultimately
leads to his unraveling  a peppy junior named Tracy Flick.
Flick (Reese Witherspoon, Cruel Intentions) is running unopposed for the
student body President, and her vivacity and eagerness are just the
qualities that would have made her an easy target for people like
Ferris.  She in the top seven percent of her class, dresses like she's
still trapped in Pleasantville, walks like she has a bulky object
crammed up her backside, and perfectly pronounces every word that leaves
her tightly pursed lips.  And don't get me started on her hair, which,
at one point, resembles demonic horns.
Things take an odd turn at Carver when McAllister convinces well-liked
school quarterback Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) to run against the
seemingly unstoppable Flick juggernaut.  When the dust settles, viewers
will have been treated to tastes of pornography, marital infidelity,
lesbianism, sex with minors, election tampering, and a very disturbing
scene where McAllister cleanses his genitals in the bathtub of a cheap
hotel.  Not your typical MTV Production, eh?
Payne's direction (he also co-wrote the script, based on the Tom
Perrotta novel) is reminiscent of both Wes Anderson's superior Rushmore
and either of Betty Thomas' biopics, The Late Show and Private Parts.
Repeatedly using montage clips, Payne also bathes his actors in a sea of
horrible fluorescent lighting, exposing every physical flaw.
Although the acting is first-rate, Witherspoon's Flick really stands
out.  Her unknowingly fiendish role will likely be remembered among the
more evil roles in film history, along with Oddjob, Keyser Soze, Robert
Patrick in Terminator 2 and that Russian guy from the fourth Rocky
film.  Or was it the third?  Well, you get my point.  (1:43  R for
adult language, nudity, sexual content and drug use)

    Comparative only to "Go" as the years most original comedy,  Alexander 
Payne's new film "Election" supplies enough dry wit and trenchant humor to 
place it in a category that is far beyond what we would expect from the 
quintessential "teen comedy."  Whereas most teen movies are cast based upon 
looks (i.e.: I Still Know What You Did Last Summer), Election is one of the 
few that eyed for talent,  something very refreshing for those looking for 
substance in the recent abundance of low-quality teen films.
Although Reese Witherspoon has a large role as the ambitious and 
overachieving Tracy Flick,  the film is centered on the mundane life of 
teacher Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick).  Everyday he goes through the 
routine of running around the track,  taking a shower,  and preparing his 
lessons.  The monotony of his life is cleverly shown in a scene in which he 
is shown over and over explaining the difference between executive,  
legislative,  and judicial.  As he is giving a lecture on morals and ethics,  
he seems reluctant to call on the anxious Tracy,  and almost annoyed at her 
zeal.  It's ironic that morals and ethics would eventually come back to haunt 
him.
Tracy is asked why she puts up posters even though she is running 
unopposed for president in the upcoming school election.  "Coca-Cola is the 
number one soft drink company in the world without any major competitors," 
she responds.  "But they spend millions of dollars on advertising.  I guess 
that's how come they stay number one."
McAllister is unnerved when he finds out that his colleague has had an 
affair with Tracy.  "He's the type of guy who became a teacher because he 
never wanted to leave high school," McAllister explains.  He then becomes 
even more worried he realizes that Tracy will win the election,  and they 
will have to spend a lot of time together.  He tries to inspire Paul Metzler 
(Chris Klein),  the athlete who seems to be more caring than the archetypal 
popular jock,  to run for office.  "Maybe it's time to give something back," 
he tells him.  Metzler eventually decides to run,  and when he starts to date 
the love interest of his lesbian sister,  she enters the race as well,  
seemingly just despite him. It is in fact his sister Tammy,  who turns out to 
be the dark horse in the election,  after her rousing speech on the 
meaninglessness of a student body.
By using coarse sexual dialogue,  unexpected viewpoints,  and 
freeze-frames at the strangest of moments,  Payne is able convey his dark 
humor with a sense of quirkiness that is both amusing and remarkably 
engaging.  In fact,  one extreme close up of a teacher describing a sexual 
encounter with a student is so surprising and frank,  that it nearly garnered 
the film an NC-17 rating.  The success of this type of offbeat high school 
movie could also be seen in last year's "Rushmore."
Reese Witherspoon is able to give the best performance of her young 
career.  Her voice embodies the determination of someone who will stop at 
nothing in order to assure their success.  The walls of her room are laden 
with posters that are more likely to be seen in a classroom rather than 
teenagers.   On the night before the election,  her candor is seen when she 
prays,  "Dear Jesus,  I really must insist that you help me win this 
election,  because I deserve it."
The performances of Broderick and Witherspoon power Alexander Payne and 
Jim Taylor's (who previously collaborated on Payne's first movie "Citizen 
Ruth" in 1996) script to play perfectly on the screen.  Election's 
sophistication and attention to the times rivals John Hughes teen classic 
"Sixteen Candles,"  and looks even better when compared to today's teen 
movies.

Mr. Bryan Frankenseuss Theiss
 Upon the release of virtually every high school related movie of the past few
years (Can't Hardly Wait, She's All That, Varsity Blues, Jawbreaker, etc.) one
sound could be heard: me, whining about high school movies that seem to be made
by people who were home schooled. Sometimes it's amusing to see how filmmakers
view today's teenagers - the writers of Never Been Kissed, for example, seem to
think that high school kids idolize Tiger Woods - but it gets old fast, and you
start yearning for a movie that captures the daily rituals and heightened
emotional traumas of high school in a semi-accurate fashion.  
  Election does that and more. It's really not a teen movie, as it takes on the
point of view of Mr. McAllister (Mathew Broderick, playing his first neurotic
teacher role to perfection) and follows him into his home life, outside of the
world of lockers and notebooks. But it is perhaps one of the most accurate film
depictions ever of a suburban public high school.
   Let's compare Election to She's All That, the Freddie Prinze, Jr. movie
about giving a makeover to a good looking unpopular girl to make her into a
good looking popular girl. In She's All That, the class president is the most
popular guy in school. The office is one of great power -  in one scene, he
asks two bullies to eat pizza covered in their own pubic hairs, and they have
no choice but to do it.  
  Election is different, because it takes into account things like reality and
common sense. In this school, few really care about class elections. Initially,
the sweater wearing, hyper-ambitious Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) runs
unopposed. Because really, who cares about student government besides Tracy
Flick, who likes to collect good lines to put on her resume? Another late
entering candidate points out in her speech the obvious fact that student
government is really a pointless exercise with no power of any kind. Even Mr.
M, who at least cares enough about the election to manipulate its outcome,
snaps at one point, "We're not electing the fucking Pope." 
  This is a movie that remembers that student government is not a popularity
contest. Because how many popular kids want to be in student government? When
Mr. M tries to recruit the popular, injured football player Paul Metzler to run
against Tracy, he points out that it's more Tracy Flick's kind of thing. 
  There are no bully cliches, intense prom queen races or Clueless rip offs. At
long last, a high school movie that treats the audience like people who may
have once experienced the real thing. Who would have thought that Miramax would
bring us She's All That, while MTV brought us Election?
  The director is Alexander Payne, who also helmed Citizen Ruth, the funniest
movie ever made about abortion. In that film, Laura Dern plays a glue sniffing
pregnant woman caught in a tug of war between anti-abortion and pro-choice
activists. The film ruthlessly satirizes both sides, not letting anyone off
easy - kind of like Dead Man Walking with laffs. Election has a similar
sensibility, setting you up to side with Mr. M only to later realize that he's
much, much more flawed than his arch-nemesis. There's a lot of grey area, very
little black and white, and the movie asks you to make up your own mind about
the characters and what they're doing. It hardly even nudges you. 
  Payne doesn't pretend that the election or its outcome are important. To Mr.
M, Tracy losing the election would be a symbolic victory over people who
trample over others to get to the top. But it is clear that his quest is more
fueled by sexual fear - his old best friend lost his job and marriage after
becoming sexually obsessed (and involved) with Tracy. Tracy mentions to Mr. M
that if she wins they'll be spending a lot of time together, and he starts to
see some of his buddy's desire in himself. 
  It is in this aspect, and in a subplot about an extramarital affair, that the
film is most daring. The camera seems to scrutinize Mr. M, magnifying his
flaws, both humanizing and humiliating him. It never comes across as forced
shock value, but it's still uncomfortable subject matter. Here we have one of
the school's best loved teachers, in many ways an admirable man, watching a
porn video about cheerleaders, and later picturing Tracy's face on the back of
his wife's head as he has doggystyle sex. I like it when a movie can make me
cringe intentionally, like when Mr. M mistakes a woman's friendship for sexual
advances and playfully suggests getting a room as they drive past a hotel. And
I can think of few moments in movies that are as embarrassingly human as the
one where he squats down in a hotel bathroom, still wearing a shirt and tie,
cleaning his crotch before a planned sexual liaison.
  Another thing that makes it work is that while Tracy is ostensibly the
villain, and her characterization is a humorous semi-exaggeration of annoying
personality traits that we all recognize, she is never demonized. In fact, the
worst thing Tracy ever does is tear down her opponent's campaign posters in a
fit of rage, and then lie about it. When it comes down to it, poster
desecration is fairly small potatoes in the annals of movie villainy.
  In any other movie, Tracy would be an outwardly wholesome person with a
secret dark side, like Serial Mom, or Nicole Kidman in To Die For, or Patricia
Arquette in the more forgettable Goodbye Lover. But outside of poster-tearing,
Tracy has no dark side. She's not a femme fatale or a seductress, and in fact
is portrayed as a victim during her relationship with Mr. M's colleague. Later,
you can't help but feel for her when she lays on her bed crying, having lost
the election, and her mom tries to console her by gently intoning, "Maybe if
you had tried some of my suggestions."
  Paul is a similarly moldbreaking character. In my experience, high school
athletes often were cruel and misogynistic brutes, more extreme even than how
they are portrayed in movies, but not all of them were. Paul (who bears a
striking resemblance to Keanu Reeves) is hilariously dim-witted, but he's the
most genuinely nice person in the movie. He reminds me of people from my high
school, and doesn't remind me of characters from other movies. His hilariously
bad campaign speech made my eyes water. I felt like I should stifle my
laughter, as if I was sitting in those bleachers and he might see me making fun
of him.
  Election is the type of movie where you keep seeing little details that make
you think, "That happens all the time in real life - how come I've never seen
it in a movie?" I like the corny painted-on-butcher-paper campaign posters
("Paul Metzler - You betzler!"), and Tracy's obsession with taping them up
neatly. I like that while Tracy makes her speech, one student in the bleachers
yells out an unrelated obscenity, causing everyone to laugh, which in turn
causes the principal to commandeer the microphone and scold the school for not
"acting like adults." 
  I like that the lesbian characters look like regular people - they're not
exaggeratedly sexy or butch. In fact, all of the casting is amazingly true to
life, from Mr. M's not-particularly-attractive mistress to the two kids who,
for some reason, pride themselves on accurate ballot counting.
  The cars are realistic, the houses are realistic, the hair is realistic. You
feel like you're spying on one of your teachers from high school more than you
feel like you're watching a movie. I read somewhere that Payne hadn't seen very
many teen movies before, and I believe it. He seems unaware of the low
standards that are considered acceptable in the genre.
  In the epilogue, there is a brief scene where Tracy finds out that college
life isn't quite what her mom and her teachers and the brochures made it out to
be. While she tries to sleep, four perfectly cast, frizzy haired dorm neighbors
sit on the floor outside of her door, talking. Tracy probably realizes that
these guys were able to get into college without super-charged resumes, and it
pisses her off. Moments of dead-on accuracy like this are rare in movies about
young people (especially those brought to us by MTV, which include Dead Man On
Campus and Varsity Blues), but Election is absolutely loaded with them.
  There are a few similarities with Rushmore, one of my other favorite movies
I've seen this year, but in a way they're opposites. Max Fischer and Tracy
Flick are almost the same character type, dominating virtually every school
activity, masterfully manipulating every school resource available to them -
they even both take on unhealthy relationships with teachers. But Max is
portrayed as the hero, while Tracy acts as a quasi-villain, and Election has an
overwhelmingly pessimistic view while Rushmore ends optimistically. 
  Election makes a good companion piece to both Rushmore and Citizen Ruth, and
acts as a powerful antidote to the many brainless teen movies where the last
act takes place at a big dance, game or party. This is the high school movie
I've been waiting for, the one with no makeovers or in-school radio stations,
that doesn't feel like the son of the son of the son of whichever John Hughes
movie. This is the one that could have happened in my school, the one that
hacks off a piece of real life and puts it in a magnifying jar so we can all
watch it wiggle around.

When civics teacher Jim McAllister asks his class for the definition of
ethics and morals, consistent overachiever Tracy Flick immediately
shoots her hand toward the ceiling.  Although Tracy looks like she may
pull her arm from its socket if she isn't called on, Mr. McAllister
tries hard to find some other student who knows the answers.  He's tired
of her dominance.  But, when others flub the answers, he's left with no
choice.  With a barely perceptible roll of his eyes he reluctantly
selects Tracy.  She -- no surprise -- barks out the exact textbook
definition from memory.
Tracy, as we will learn, knows the definition but not the meaning.
Writer and director Alexander Payne, whose last picture was the
delicious satire CITIZEN RUTH, is back again with an even better
satirical piece, ELECTION.  Although it plows some of the same fertile
ground as RUSHMORE, the more consistent ELECTION bears even more fruit.
As the picture's star, Reese Witherspoon plays the anal-retentive Tracy
Flick with a nuanced performance that's light-years ahead of her
marvelous work in PLEASANTVILLE.  When Tracy needs to be, she appears
innocent, vulnerable and naively seductive.  Usually, however, she's as
tough as nails.  Dressed in conservative tweed skirts with dull,
avocado-colored stockings, she is prim, proper and prissy.
If there were an Academy Award for body language, Witherspoon would win
it hands down for this performance.  When she concentrates on important
things, like the proper taping of a sign, Tracy's lips appear sealed
with super glue.  When she needs to smile in order to get what wants,
her lips retract, and a frozen smile instantly appears.  The best comes
when the excessively serious Tracy gets some good news.  She hops around
the school halls like a jackrabbit on speed.
Tracy is running unopposed to be class president of George Washington
Carver High School.  (The richly sardonic script by Alexander Payne and
Jim Taylor, based on Tom Perrotta's novel, even uses the school's name
to poke fun.  I counted only one African-American at this large Nebraska
school.)
Matthew Broderick, reminding us again after the GODZILLA debacle what an
excellent actor he can be, plays award-winning teacher Jim McAllister.
Tracy had had an affair the previous year with another teacher, causing
him to lose his job.  This put the fear of God into Jim.  When Tracy
flirtingly reminds him that, if she wins, they will be spending a lot of
time together, he knows he has to act fast.
As a solution to a possible nightmare, Jim enlists the laid back but
popular athlete Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) to run against Tracy.  Shy
Paul is so nervous that he delivers his campaign speech to the school
assembly without ever pausing for a breath.
The campaign balance is disturbed when Paul's lesbian sister, Tammy
(Jessica Campbell), decides in a fit of pique to run against him.  The
nihilist Tammy runs on a campaign of abolishing student government if
elected.  She says the only ones who benefit are those elected, since
they can use it on their resumes.  This generates a war whoop from the
student body and immediately transforms her from underdog into a real
contender.
The subtle script takes a chirpy, upbeat attitude to its black comedy
material.  The leads all speak in frequent and insightful voice-over to
explain their points of view.  The editor freeze-frames the characters,
especially Tracy, in the most unflattering ways.  Tracy may project
utter confidence and some wide-eyed innocence, but these freeze-frames
show the ugliness that lies just below the surface.
The movie really shines in its small touches.  When one character has an
affair, he goes to the motel (the "American Family Inn" to be precise)
in advance in order to properly prepare the room.  The pičce de
résistance is the fresh rose he places inside the Gideon Bible in the
nightstand drawer.  How many lovers will figure their paramour will want
to engage in a little Bible reading after their assignation?
The pre-election prayer scene is quite illuminating.  Tracy, Paul and
Tammy are especially honest and revealing when talking to God in the
privacy of their rooms.
There are many surprises along the way, including an investigation
involving certain campaign irregularities, but the question is who will
win at the voting booth?  It might not be whom you suspect.  The
screenwriters manage to make the story enthralling even though they make
what looks like a mistake and let the story go on past its natural
conclusion.
ELECTION runs 1:45.  It is rated R for sex, profanity and a brief dope
smoking scene and would be fine for older teenagers.

The dark comedy ELECTION presents a scathing look at the harsh world of
politics.  While occurring in a teenage setting, this quality script fleshed
out on screen through skilled acting deals with themes older generations will
find relevant. 
Meet Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon).  This girl involves herself with every
possible school activity she can enter, allowing for a busy schedule and no
friends.  With an over-achieving attitude, she sweet talks administrators and
staff and arrives in the spot of teacher's pet with ease.  Striving to attain
the highest rank in everything she does, the apparently innocent young blonde
will crush anyone who opposes her.  
The time has rolled around at Carver High School for the student body to choose
their new class officers who will represent them for the upcoming school year. 
The film follows the race for the esteemed position of president.  Tracy,
always spotting the opportunity for a good college resume booster, enters the
race unopposed. The bubbly, cute persona she puts on in public only stands to
further her inner desires of domination.  She endlessly campaigns with banners,
pins, and free chewing gum, even though she certainly holds a lock on the win.
The events he sees transpiring upset history teacher Jim McAllister (Matthew
Broderick), the Student Government Association sponsor.  Having firsthand
experience of the underlying schemes Tracy uses in achieving her goals, he
comes to despise the constant perkiness and know-it-all mentality she conveys. 
As a result, McAllister decides he cannot let her easily win the race without a
fight, so he secretly pushes the football team's star quarterback to run for
president as well.  
Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), the dumb jock urged to enter, reluctantly accepts
his favorite teacher's proposition.  With this he begins plastering posters
throughout the school and issues a full-blown campaign.  Of course, an outraged
Tracy demands to find out who put the athlete up to this, and a full-scale war
ensues.  She now endlessly muscles her way around spreading her messages of
"Pick Flick" and "Vote for tomorrow today." 
Adding to the melee, Paul's lesbian sister Tammy (Jessica Campbell) becomes
entrenched in the race as a surprise third candidate when she believes she can
use this attempt to get back at an old girlfriend who supports her brother. 
Yes, it admittedly sounds a little screwy, but she comes off as the only
competitor with a truly earnest spirit and lack of self-serving motives.  Her
crowd-pleasing speech to the assembly of jeering students earns her the place
as the favorite because of her honesty, while the snobby Tracy and sweet but
goofy Paul merely give bland promises of the future.
The movie offers a biting portrait of the political process which runs
throughout elections from high school all the way to Washington.  The tactics
employed to assure victory by the nominees, especially Tracy, depict the
do-whatever-it-takes mentality so prevalent in today's officials.  By stepping
on anyone in the way, the representative may eventually fulfill the road to
power, but the public often does not view the high costs and dirty tricks
applied in reaching the status.  
The film's funny tone gives a lighthearted feel to a mature message of sticking
to morality rather than regressing into lies to gain an objective.  No one
escapes suffering from the consequences when vigorous plots suppress the truth.
 Witherspoon portrays the venomous Tracy with a wonderful performance, and
Broderick's McAllister shows how simply a nice guy can suddenly find himself
trapped in a bad situation.  Election delivers the goods for insight into the
ruthless political game while supplying laughs along the way at every turn.  B

ELECTION (director: Alexander Payne; cast: Matthew Broderick (Jim
McAllister), ReeseWitherspoon (Tracy Flick), Chris Klein (Paul Metzler),
Jessica Campbell (Tammy Metzler), Phil Reeves (Walt Hendricks), Mark
Harelik (Dave Novotny), 1999)
Election is director Alexander Payne's (Citizen Ruth) cynical satire of
the American schools and the electoral process. In it he questions
American values, suggesting that it is better to lose and be a nice
person than to win and stand for nothing but your own
self-aggrandizement. Tracy Flick (Reese) wants to succeed at any cost.
She even asks God for his help to win the school election, where she is
running for president of her high school in Omaha, Nebraska. She becomes
the easily recognizable villain in Payne's satire of American society.
One of the questions that might also be asked: Is how do you work in a
system when you stop believing in it?
That will become the 64 dollar question for Jim McAllister (Broderick),
as he undergoes some critical changes in his life and seems on the brink
of a serious burnout. That he is a hypocrite, also, will become plain
enough, when we see how he rationalizes his own personal foibles, which
includes an extra-marital affair with the divorced wife of his friend
(Harelik). This is the friend who lost his teaching job because of his
affair with Tracy. What makes this satire seem not to ring true, is that
Harelik actually falls in love with this over ambitious student, who
leaves no impression that she is lovable.This makes Harelik's love for
her seem highly improbable. Jim, meanwhile, seems pathetic and
disingenuous, as he looks down at his friend's ex-wife's cleavage, and
he tells her how much she means to him, as he actually believes he is
suddenly in love. The point being made in both cases, is that these men
don't know the difference between love and sex.
In school he is the faculty advisor to the student council and speaks
from his high perch of moral authority. In class he asks the students
about the difference between ethics and morality, holding out for the
most idealized answer. Jim cannot see the difference between his lies
and how he perceives other people who lie.
When Tracy runs unopposed for school president, Jim decides to talk a
dumb football player into running, Paul Metzler (Chris). He just broke a
leg, so he can't play football, and is despondent about that. He has no
real interest or ability for the office, but Mr. McAllister is able to
twist his arm into running by telling him good government depends on
opposition, that it is his duty to run in order to make the election
meaningful. Paul is one of those rich kids who is very nice and very
popular, but who is not a very sophisticated or manipulative person. In
the meantime, Paul's sister Tammy (Campbell) is having an affair with
another girl. But this girl says she was just experimenting, that she's
no dyke; and, she breaks Tammy's heart further by dumping her in favor
of her brother. In order to get even with somebody for her hurt, Tammy
decides to run against both Paul and Tracy for president.
The three candidates campaign with posters and reasons why they should
be elected. Tracy obviously feels she must win. She has put her whole
life on the line; her sole purpose is to win. Paul thinks he might be
able to do some good. While, Tammy becomes the dark horse candidate by
stating, "Who cares about this stupid election?"
The film didn't know quite how to resolve the moral dilemma Jim got
himself into; it is both funny and sad to see how this once perfectly
acceptable teacher, who could have lived out his career with total
community acceptance, gets entangled with rigging the election and
letting a personal hatred for a girl he was supposed to be an advisor
and moral influence to, get the better of him.
In some ways, this film reminded me of two diverse recent films I saw,
Welcome To The Dollhouse and Rushmore. They all had an anger to them,
pointing at something in society that is not all that it appears to be
and saying that is where the problem lies.
In this screenplay, by Payne and Jim Taylor, it has accurately captured
a certain look and feel  high school has about it. This film was able to
show how its school was not conducive for the individual to feel free
in. That all the characters are flawed, unable to see beyond the very
narrow limits they operate under has made for a very trying tale. The
film just didn't know how to end its story by landing on its feet. It
had a great performance by Matthew Broderick, who was subtle and obvious
enough to bring out the inner and outer conflicts in his life. Yet, the
main problem remaining is that aside from the flaws of all the
characters involved, there is no one else to blame for the moral dilemma
that is presented.

It's hard to imagine a better political satire than Election, Alexander
Payne's intelligent and genius follow-up to his 1996 film, Citizen
Ruth.  True, it's a story about a high school election, starring Reese
Witherspoon presidential candidate Tracy Flick, and Matthew Broderick as
Mr. McAllister, the teacher who hates her most.  But Election serves not
just as an acerbic attack on high school politics, but as an attack on
politics in general (now I know what Hillary Clinton was like in high
school).  The film features four dead-on performances; Broderick and
Witherspoon are both show masterful comic timing, but also give their
characters depth.  Chris Klein is wonderful as Paul Metzler, the big,
stupid, lovable jock oaf who runs against Tracy; Jessica Campbell is
also great as Paul's laconic, lesbian sister.  But what really makes
Election such a funny, touching, brilliant blast of a film is Payne's
direction:  he observes these people with such immaculate objectivity
and seething irony that you can't help but like them all, even with
their flaws.  In short, Election is what satire is all about.

Actor Matthew Broderick finally comes full-circle after several failed
attempts at a respectable career as a working actor in Hollywood, and
becomes a teacher in high school, a role diametrically opposed to his most
famous acting role to date, as the uncatchable student Ferris Bueller in
1986's classic John Hughes comedy FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF (8/10). Anyone?
Anyone??
PLOT:
Overly ambitious student Tracey Flick is running for the student body
presidency and will not let anybody stand in her way. Not her twelve-year
veteran teacher Mr. M, not the most popular boy in high school who is also
running for the political prize, nor his lesbian sister, the other nominee
on the ballot.
CRITIQUE:
Clever, somewhat predictable, stylish film features Reese Witherspoon's
greatest performance to date as the most annoying overachiever that you'd
ever NOT want to meet. Now despite generally enjoying this film, I could not
help but compare it to (what seems like its male counterpart) the superior
1998 film, RUSHMORE (8/10), which featured a stronger performance by its
co-star, Bill Murray, a more entertaining script, and many funnier moments.
But since any direct comparison is inherently unfair, I would say that this
film does succeed in its root of black comedy, with no huge laughs, an
interesting plot, and several great performances, with Witherspoon's showing
topping them all.
By its very nature, this scathing satire contains various contemptible
characters who essentially think of no one but themselves, and create that
sort of "Seinfeld" mentality in which the person making the least immoral
mistakes will win, if only by default. The one character that did feature
some conscientious behavior, the football playing popular-boy, struck me as
too big of a moron to appreciate as a true character, but maybe that's just
me. Too goofy, for my taste. One other thing to note is that this film is
definitely a comedy for adults, not for kids! Some teenagers may appreciate
it, but overall, me thinks this feature is geared towards the more cynical
segment of our modern day adult population. All in all, a superb performance
by Reese Witherspoon, a clever script, some funny moments, but ultimately
too similar to RUSHMORE to appreciate as an original story (for me, that
is).
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Actress Reese Witherspoon is currently engaged, and carrying the child of
fellow actor Ryan Phillippe. Interesting little story about her from the
IMDb, "Shortly after she started acting she had an audition for a role in
CAPE FEAR (8.5/10). She was supposed to meet with Robert DeNiro and Martin
Scorsese for the audition, but at the time didn't really know who they were.
On the plane she was talking to the man next to her about her audition, and
the man started to rave to her about DeNiro and Scorsese. This made her so
nervous that she completely blew the audition and the role eventually went
to Juliette Lewis."
Matthew Broderick was at one time engaged to actress Helen Hunt, and another
time, to actress Jennifer Grey. He has now been married to actress Sarah
Jessica Parker since May 1997.
For first-time movie actor Chris Klein, it was during his senior year at
Millard West High School in Omaha that he literally bumped into director
Alexander Payne as he was scouting Klein's high school as a possible
location for ELECTION. After an audition for Payne, and only four weeks into
his first semester at Texas Christian University where he is studying
dramatic arts, Klein received the offer to star in ELECTION.
It is also the first time acting gig for actress Jessica Campbell, who plays
Chris Klein's sister in the movie. Her former acting coach asked
writer/director Alexander Payne to take a look at Campbell's audition tape
in consideration for a role in the film, subsequently landing one of the
production's lead roles.
Director Alexander Payne's first feature film was 1996's critically
acclaimed CITIZEN RUTH. Originally from Omaha, Nebraska, Payne received B.A.
degrees in history and Spanish literature from Stanford University. Payne
then earned an M.F.A. from UCLA's prestigious filmmaking program. His thesis
film, THE PASSION OF MARTIN, was screened at the 1991 Sundance Film Festival
and more than 20 other festivals around the world.
A couple of scenes in this film are in obvious homage to director Alfred
Hitchcock's PSYCHO.
This film is based on a novel of the same name by writer Tom Perotta.
Actress Thora Birch left the filming in Omaha on her third day because of
creative differences with director Alexander Payne.

Just when you thought that there was nothing more than brainless, insipid
teenager movies obsessed with sex and money comes a delectable treat known as
Election. It is one of the best, quirkiest, smartest and most outrageous movies
of the year - a bright, comical triumph from first frame to last. It also
boasts one of my favorite performances of the year - from the wondrous fireball
of energy known as Reese Witherspoon. 
Witherspoon stars as Tracy Flick, a scheming, energetic, overly ambitious,
overachieving high school student (how rare nowadays to witness such a person
in any movie) with dreams of running for office. Tracy tries so hard that she
makes muffins with the logo "Pick Flick" emblazoned on each one while seated at
her campaigning table. And campaign she does, as Tracy runs for the upcoming
high school election for school president. Only the civics teacher, Mr.
McAllister (Matthew Broderick), is not sure he wants Tracy to win, and she has
a hell of a chance since she's the only one running. So he encourages a dumb
jock, Paul Metzler (Chris Klein - a keen reminder of Keanu Reeves) into running
for the election, thus sending a chord of resentment through some principal
characters. Tracy is understandably furious thinking she's the only one who
should run. Paul's sister, Tammy (Jessica Campbell), is a rebellious loner with
lesbian tendencies, and decides to run for president as an attack against her
brother's girlfriend. What transpires are voting posters torn from walls,
countless affairs, inarticulate political speeches, bee stings, meditating
between power lines, lies, bitter jealousies, and enough catastrophic events to
make Monica Lewinsky blush with shock. 
"Election" is deftly written and imaginatively directed by Alexander Payne.
His first effort, Citizen Ruth, was a mild, uneven black comedy that
nevertheless raised issues about abortion rights - a touchy subject. With
"Election," Payne explores and deeply uncovers a cutthroat comic spirit in the
realm of politics , and there is an occasional mean streak - all the characters
suffer and pay for the consequences of their actions. Yes, even the righteous
Mr. McAllister, who knows the difference between morals and ethics but does not
apply them to his daily life. As played by Matthew Broderick, it is hard to
dislike him, but you can reject his ethical and moral choices. 
In "Election," it is impossible to know whom you should be rooting for or whom
you should sympathize with. And Payne cleverly shifts from one character's
point-of-view to another to the point where we at least hope everyone gets away
with their individual actions. We hope that Tracy gets the shot as president,
but we start to doubt her ethics (she wants to get ahead in the world, after
all). However, is she any worse than McAllister, who has an affair with his
friend's wife? Does it matter that his friend was a former geometry professor
who had an affair with Tracy and, as a result. ousted from the school? Or what
about the dumb, sweet Paul who can't give a speech to save his life? Or Tammi
who has ambitions beyond elections, and considers suspensions to be restful
vacations? 
The cast is uniformly perfect. Reese Witherspoon is a spunky, tense,
frighteningly ambitious creature who will do anything to get support (not
unlike her similar character in Freeway) - she is like a tight ball of energy
ready to burst. Broderick has his best role in ages - he adeptly switches from
an omnipresent, good-natured teacher to a repulsive-looking creature with a bee
sting aiming to destroy Tracy - an act Ferris Bueller's principal (the
memorable performance by Jeffrey Jones in Ferris Bueller's Day Off) would have
been fond of. Jessica Campbell goes against the grain of zit-free, attractive
teens with her braces and rebellious attitude towards the school - she would
have been a fitting replacement for Rachel Leigh Cook in She's All That. And
the cameo by Colleen Camp as Tracy's mother is a shrewd casting choice - she is
as ambitious as her daughter.
"Election" is a hysterical, wonderful movie guaranteed to keep you in stitches
throughout. It is original, offbeat, edgy and facetious. It is still early, but
the vote is in for me: "Election" is the best film of the year.

Matthew Broderick and high school comedy. The two terms have been 
practically inseparable since Ferris Buehler took the day off in 1986. 
Now it is 13 years later, and Broderick has another high school comedy, 
Election, to show the world. Ferris Buehler's Day Off showed an 
educational setting that was similar to a pile of marshmallows. It was 
light, fluffy, tasty, and sparkling clean. But Election is far 
different. This production is a dark, and frighteningly realistic one 
that does so much more than entertain for the 103 minutes it occupies; 
it shocks as well.
Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) is the type of teacher that makes 
American high schools proud. He is a kind, caring, younger man who has 
built his life around Carver High School. In turn, Carver High School 
has provided a home for him. Jim has won teacher of the year no less 
than three times in his 12 year span, and is a well respected social 
studies teacher among the student body.
Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is an intelligent, outgoing, and, to 
quote the film, "super nice" young girl. She is involved in numerous 
extracurricular activities, always has her hand up first in class, and 
is extremely popular among most of the student body. So, it is a natural 
progression when she decides to run for school president.
The Metzler family is an extremely wealthy one. The father, Dick (Holmes 
Osborne), owns a cement company. The mother, Jo (Jeanine Jackson), is an 
ideal housewife. And the two children, Paul (Chris Klein) and Tammy 
(Jessica Campbell), are both students at Carver High School. Paul was 
the quarterback of the football team before he injured himself, and is 
definitely a candidate for most popular person in school. Tammy is a 
lesbian who, to say the least, is going through a period of self 
discovery.     
For reasons of revenge, hatred, and sexual envy, Jim convinces Paul to 
run against Tracy for school president. He claims that in a democracy 
you need choices, and having Tracy run unopposed creates a dictatorship 
of sorts. So Paul agrees and the race is on. But then, in an effort to 
spite the two candidates, Tammy announces that she is running as well. 
Her campaign is straightforward: People only run to put it on their 
college applications, then they do nothing. Well, "I don't even want to 
go to college," she says.
In Election, there are no "good guys". Almost everyone has their own 
agenda. No matter how deeply hidden, the production digs it up and 
exploits it for the audience. Tracy is the type of person that you 
remember from high school. She is the girl that would be labeled "Most 
likely to achieve anything she wants" in the yearbook, and everyone 
secretly envied her because of that. Jim is a teacher that takes the 
trust that students give him as a privilege, and uses it to his own 
amoral advantage. Everyone, including the principal, a former teacher, 
all the candidates, and even Paul's girlfriend are two sided characters. 
That is much of this film's beauty, it doesn't have the typical good 
guys that Hollywood likes, instead it is a realistic portrayal of the 
real world, specializing in revealing the type of sexual perversions 
that people usually keep to themselves.
Matthew Broderick couldn't have been any more perfect for this role. His 
character is often similar Bill Murray's award winning role in the 1998 
film, Rushmore. Of the two acting jobs, Broderick's is far superior. But 
even he is overshadowed by the young Reese Witherspoon. The hatred that 
she causes the audience to develop towards her, is simply indescribable. 
Broderick and Witherspoon are simply at their best when they are playing 
off each other in various scenes. One such moment occurs when she 
approaches him in his car as he is leaving school one day. You can see 
her self pride in her eyes as she presents him a list of signatures, 
making her an eligible candidate. And his subtle disgust with her is 
apparent, although he tries to mask it between the lines and attempts to 
put on a happy face.
The supporting cast is one with little Hollywood experience. But that is 
far from apparent as everyone takes control of their part. However, the 
real treat is Jessica Campbell in her confused role as a young 
homosexual girl. This is never more apparent than the scene where she 
delivers her speech announcing her so-called platform for presidency. 
She is just marvelous as her hatred towards what she thinks to be an 
unjust system is expressed.
If Ferris Buehler made you feel good about American high schools, and 
gave you an innocent laugh or two, then the movie achieved its goal. But 
don't you dare think that Election's goals are similar. It is just as 
real in its portrayal of high school, as its characters are in the real 
world. There certainly is no pile of marshmallows here.

Far too often when we step into the voting booth, we are forced to choose the
lesser of evils. It's a fact of jaded modern life that we rarely feel there is
a "best person" we want to win. It's no different in high school.
At George Washington Carver High School (with hardly a person of color in
sight), Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is destined to win the student body
election. There is no one running against her.
Her error is reminding faculty advisor Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) that
when she wins, they will be spending a lot of time together. Remembering the
previous year when the beautiful teen took a colleague of his into the
darkroom to see what developed and thinking of his secret collection of
cheerleader porn, McAllister can see the ominous writing on the wall.
Determined to avoid his fate, he convinces star jock Paul Metzler (Chris
Klein) to run against Tracy. Paul stumbles into trouble when his sister
Tammy's (Jessica Campbell) supposed lesbian lover jumps into his bed. Tammy
decides to run against Paul for revenge.
The issues are gray rather than black and white. There are no demons or
saints, just people. Director Alexander Payne must remember what high school
was really like.
Even better, it's hilarious. When prim and proper Tracy is wearing an
over-sized campaign button and giving away cupcakes, all saying "Pick FLICK",
it's a reminder of why her last name is a typographer's nightmare and
broadcasts her secret attitude.
The actors are in fine form. It's fun to watch Broderick on the other side of
the desk from his Ferris Bueller role. Witherspoon is flawless as the
pursed-lipped and driven over-achiever. The film is something of a satire of
the 1992 elections and her character is loosely based on Bill Clinton
(Campbell is Ross Perot), but she seems more like potential contender
Elizabeth Dole. Klein and Campbell are perfect in their roles.
Unlike any other teen film of recent years, "Election" is both humorous and
thoughtful. A fine combination.

"Were the world perfect, it would always be wrong to trespass, but as
the world is not perfect, sometimes one must.  And when you do, you
live, you break free, you fly.  I know this is true, and the reason it
is true, I believe, is that the spark of transgression comes directly
from the heart of God."
Superficially, Election is about a student council election in a small
high school in Omaha, Nebraska.  I say "superficially" because,
really, little can be more superficial than a student council
election.  The biggest ovation (and the biggest laugh) is reserved for
the one character who points out the foolishness of the exercise and
promises to abolish the student government if elected school
president. Much of the comedy is directed at the mounting silliness of
the election and the grotesque awkwardness of the high school
experience, making it easy to pigeonhole Election as a typical MTV
Films coming-of-age movie.  Do not make this mistake.
It would be a little more accurate to call Election a smart, snappy
commentary on our electoral system, which it is.  Election's top
candidate is Pleasantville's Reese Witherspoon, playing consummate
overachiever Tracy Flick.  There's a scene early on that catalogues
Tracy's accomplishments -- student council member, French Club,
yearbook -- that's somewhat reminiscent of a similar scene in
Rushmore.  Both Jason Schwartzman's Max Fischer and Tracy Flick are
involved in a plethora of high school activities as a creepy
substitute for acceptance, but there are important differences.  Tracy
is bright, cheerful, and nauseatingly perky, where Max is confused,
difficult, and hyperactive.  Where Max is seeking to burrow to the
heart of his school. Tracy's activity is directed towards the outside
world.  Bit by bit, we see her slowly building her resume on a path to
leadership and eventual world domination.  Every piece of gum she
gives away, every poster she makes, every cupcake she bribes voters
with is just one more step along her predetermined path.
Of course, with people like this, any deviation from that
predetermined path is a problem.  Very early on, a younger version of
Jeff Spicoli swipes a double handful of Juicy Fruit from Tracy's
hallway election headquarters.  "ONE PIECE PER PERSON!" she yells, as
though the world had ended.  Anything that breaks her composure,
anything that ruins her perfect plan, threatens to send Tracy into a
violent, sobbing (and highly entertaining) rage.
What makes this political satire?  Well, keep in mind that
director/screenwriter Alexander Payne introduces Elizabeth Dole's name
into the discussion.  I'm not making any invidious comparisons here.
Really.  I'm not.
Anyway, one of the many things that disappointed me about
Pleasantville was the way that Reese Witherspoon's character
disappeared midway through.  Here, she's given almost the whole movie
as her personal private playground, and she turns in a sharp, funny
performance that's right on the mark.
But that still isn't what the movie's about.
No, Election is about the divine spark of transgression, the message
of temptation, the occasional powerful impulse to do something wrong.
Mostly, we control that spark and keep our evildoing to a minimum.
Some of us let that spark burn us up, others let it suffocate, but
everyone knows its irresistible power.
It is the spark of transgression that powers Election and raises it
from its unpromising lineage to become a genuinely good film.  That
spark is personified by Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick), three-time
teacher of the year at Carver High and all-around good guy, the sort
who would never... ever...  do anything bad or wrong or evil.
At first, it seemed cruel to me to cast Broderick in this role, and it
is a little sad to see Ferris Bueller teaching government class,
especially with graying temples that look for all the world to be
applied with Liquid Paper.  But the spark of transgression can light
up even the dullest, grayest life.  Broderick sees Witherspoon's
character as a mortal threat.  McAllister fears Tracy on a personal
level (she's already slept with, and ruined the life of, his best
friend) but he also fears the inevitability of her rise to power, or
merely wants to teach her a lesson.  Whatever the reason, McAllister
is sitting in his basement, drinking a Pepsi,
watching... well... let's just say he's watching TV... and the spark
of transgression hits him.  He decides to enlist football hero Paul
Metzler (newcomer Chris Klein) as Tracy's opponent.  And from there,
the sparks start flying, and don't stop until the very last scene.
These are the high points of the movie, and they make Election worth
seeing by themselves.  But such a review leaves out a lot of the
small, good touches that make Election special -- as well as the
annoying little freeze-frame and flashback sequences that make it
imperfect.  If Election were a perfect movie, such criticisms would be
superfluous.  Election is not a perfect movie, but it lives, it breaks
free, and every once in a while it even flies.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Matthew Broderick's character in the new Alexander Payne (Citizen Ruth)
comedy could be an adult version of Ferris Bueller.  Sure, we don't want
to think about the carefree Ferris turning into Election's popular high
school teacher Jim McAllister, but you almost can't help it.
McAllister is a mélange of every educator you've ever had  dingy
short-sleeved oxford shirt, bad tie, brown shoes, tiny Ford Festiva, and
a genuine love of teaching.  Despite winning George Washington Carver
High's `Teacher of the Year' a record three times in his twelve-year
tenure, McAllister still has one major Achilles heel that ultimately
leads to his unraveling  a peppy junior named Tracy Flick.
Flick (Reese Witherspoon, Cruel Intentions) is running unopposed for the
student body President, and her vivacity and eagerness are just the
qualities that would have made her an easy target for people like
Ferris.  She in the top seven percent of her class, dresses like she's
still trapped in Pleasantville, walks like she has a bulky object
crammed up her backside, and perfectly pronounces every word that leaves
her tightly pursed lips.  And don't get me started on her hair, which,
at one point, resembles demonic horns.
Things take an odd turn at Carver when McAllister convinces well-liked
school quarterback Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) to run against the
seemingly unstoppable Flick juggernaut.  When the dust settles, viewers
will have been treated to tastes of pornography, marital infidelity,
lesbianism, sex with minors, election tampering, and a very disturbing
scene where McAllister cleanses his genitals in the bathtub of a cheap
hotel.  Not your typical MTV Production, eh?
Payne's direction (he also co-wrote the script, based on the Tom
Perrotta novel) is reminiscent of both Wes Anderson's superior Rushmore
and either of Betty Thomas' biopics, The Late Show and Private Parts.
Repeatedly using montage clips, Payne also bathes his actors in a sea of
horrible fluorescent lighting, exposing every physical flaw.
Although the acting is first-rate, Witherspoon's Flick really stands
out.  Her unknowingly fiendish role will likely be remembered among the
more evil roles in film history, along with Oddjob, Keyser Soze, Robert
Patrick in Terminator 2 and that Russian guy from the fourth Rocky
film.  Or was it the third?  Well, you get my point.  (1:43  R for
