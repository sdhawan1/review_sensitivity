        It's become obvious that the teen movie glut has not only reached
critical mass, but also creative bankruptcy.  The latest entry in the
youth horror sweepstakes, _Final_Destination_, not only had Death
claiming most of its characters, but also any real inspiration.  In the
comedy department, all accounts have the new _Whatever_It_Takes_ sinking
even lower than the depths slogged through in its immediate teen laugher
predecessor, _Drive_Me_Crazy_.  So when someone aims to do something
different with a youth-targeted film film, as the makers of
_All_I_Wanna_Do_ and _Here_on_Earth_ have, it comes as somewhat of a
relief.  But relief from the norm is one thing, and being refreshing is
entirely another--and only one of these two fits that bill.
        That compliment goes to the one that would appear to be less likely to
receive it: _All_I_Wanna_Do_, a comedy set in an all-girls boarding
school in New England.  While the film does cover the usual high school
comedy conventions--raging hormones (heightened, of course, by the
virtual absence of the opposite sex), gross-out humor--the estrogenic
setting and the time period (1963) gives the film a distinct point of
view.  Writer-director Sarah Kernochan does take her time to get to her
main point; a good portion of the film is devoted to simply hanging out
with the main group of girls, who form the secret society D.A.R.
(Daughters of the American Ravioli).  Its members are the scheming Verena
(Kirsten Dunst); wannabe slut Tinka (Monica Keena); smart girl Momo
(Merrit Wever); bulimic Tweety (Heather Matarazzo); and outspoken Odie
(Gaby Hoffmann), the new girl at Miss Godard's Prep School for Girls.
        Once the audience gets to know the group, the main story comes to the
fore: dire financial realities look to force Miss Godard's into going
co-ed, and the D.A.R., refusing to bow down to what they winkingly call
"the hairy bird," do what they can to keep the tradition of their school
alive.  While many teen films feature headstrong heroines, most of those
have the females' independent, intelligent attitudes melt away in the
arms of a handsome hunk.  Here, though, not only do the girls maintain
their voices, they grow louder and stronger as the film progresses. 
Rarely does one see a youth film quite as female-empowering as
_All_I_Wanna_Do_, and that fact would explain both former distributor
Miramax's barely noticeable test run of the film (then titled _Strike!_)
in 1998 and the ensuing years in distribution limbo; the prevailing
Hollywood mindset holds that girl power = limited commercial prospects. 
But any film as energetically performed (all the actresses, even the
usually annoying Hoffmann, are first-rate), entertaining, and rousing as
_All_I_Wanna_Do_ clearly has the potential to cross the demographic
barriers--that is, if given the chance.
        On the other hand, I can't imagine any audience other than weepy girls
falling for the teen tearjerker _Here_on_Earth_.  However, there are two
things going for this story of a small town girl torn between a wealthy,
big city suitor and a longtime friend: (1) the film is a romantic drama,
which is a nice change of pace for the teen market; and (2) a talented
and appealing cast.  Leelee Sobieski displays real grace and poise as
Sam, the girl caught in the middle; Josh Hartnett (who still doesn't use
a comb) displays some surprising depth as childhood sweetheart Jasper;
and the ever-promising Chris Klein radiates real movie star presence as
rich prep school boy Kelley.
        It's a shame that their talents are put at the service of such a mawkish
and poorly constructed piece of melodrama.  The love triangle never
catches fire because Jasper never seems a formidable romantic adversary
for Kelley; once that part of the story has long been exhausted, writer
Michael Seitzman and director Mark Piznarski trot in a lame bit of
potential weepiness that is made all the more annoying by its arbitrary
nature.  The three leads' impressive work confirms their potential for
major stardom, but _Here_on_Earth_ is far from the vehicle that will put
them over that plateau.

I had no idea that guys were referred to as hairy birds by girls (I can
only imagine why). More surprising still, I didn't think going co-ed was
such a big deal until I saw this movie. Being bred in an all boys
school, I can see the pros and cons of having the opposite around, but I
have no qualms either way.
So when Miss Goddards preparatory school for girls is being threatened
with the inclusion of boys, the loyalties of a group of close friends
become divided. On one side stands those immaculate virgins or those not
so immaculate, who are waiting to get laid by the first boy that comes
their way. In contrast there are those who do not want to be dominated
by boys (I'm not referring to lesbians), but believe that they should be
able to develop their aspirations in an environment free of the hairy
bird. So what follows is a high school romp not too dissimilar to the
Hayley Mills classic Â‘The Trouble With Angels'. Only this time, the plot
is to save the school from boys, and this involves getting them drunk,
getting them into bed and making them purge on stage. All very wicked
and light hearted fun.
The cast includes the familiar faces of Kursten Dunst (Little Women),
Gaby Hoffman (Now and Then) and Lynn Redgrave, as the seemingly cold
head mistress who has a heart beneath a stone exterior. I think this
should be considered a girl's movie, because I really can't see the
average, non-new age guy caring a toot about why a school shouldn't go
co-ed, when bigger things like tits and buns are at stake. Not for the
average Jo, but it will tickle the fancy of women liberationists.
