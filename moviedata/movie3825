     Not since Top Secret! has a cow been featured so prominently as a
plot device in a movie.  While The Wedding Cow, a Swiss/German
production currently making the festival rounds, bears little
resemblance to the Val Kilmer movie (aside from its German setting),
it's a funny diversion nonetheless.
     Flora (Isabella Parkinson) is a hapless girl headed to southern
Germany to start a new job as a librarian.  From the get-go, her travels
are ill fated, as she finds her money stolen and gets kicked off the
train.  The equally hapless plumber Tim (Oliver Reinhard) takes pity on
the hitchhiker and picks her up.  The cow in back, he explains, is a
wedding present from his aunt.  He's on his way south to get married in
just a few days.  It's Forces of Nature meets "Hogan's Heroes."
     The Wedding Cow quickly develops as your standard road trip
comedy.  The cow goes missing.  The truck breaks down.  Another loony
hitchhiker is picked up.  The truck gets stolen.  No one will let them
bring the cow into a hotel.  The travelers start to hate each other.
But perhaps they'll fall in love?  The Wedding Cow travels over familiar
ground but the ride is truly an enjoyable one.
     At less than 90 minutes, Cow is hardly epic filmmaking.  German
comedy is not something we see a lot of, and director Tomi Streiff has a
flair for making a rural journey seem a little bit askew.  The problem
is that the comedy never goes full-tilt over the edge:  the movie is
funny but it's never fall-down hilarious.  I wanna see some twisted-ass
Teutonic humor!  With a cow in the show, how could you miss?
