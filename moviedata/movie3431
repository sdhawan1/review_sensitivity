In the summers that aren't Bond-summers, we get the Bond-movies without
Bond. Which is to say gadget movies, all the high-tech toys and
death-defying leaps that'll fit into 2 hrs. Entrapment is all of this and
more: it even has the original Bond--Sean Connery--playing high-stakes cat
thief Mac. More or less the same veteran criminal-type role he had for The
Rock, except this time he's starring opposite Catherine Zeta-Jones,
insurance agent (Gin Baker), high-altitude acrobat, sharp dresser. The
Bond-girl has to be all of this and more.
Gin Baker is, and then some. But too, she has a day job, or, more
specifically, an assignment: to gain Mac's confidence via assuming the role
of fellow-thief, then turn him in. In a nutshell, this is Entrapment (and
Donnie Brasco, and countless more). Granted, the technical difficulty-level
of the robberies Mac and Gin attempt together does escalate, which is
satisfying, and their relationship does flirt with intimacy, which is
necessary, but, as the title suggests, that's not really what it's all going
to be about. What it is all about is entrapment, defined in the trailer as
what the law does to the unlawful. And whether honor among thieves applies
or not. And who's entrapping whom in the first place. Ving Rhames is even in
there somewhere, waltzing through his Mission Impossible role again. To
director Jon Amiel's credit, though, he does keep us guessing until the
final frames (via occlusion, which isn't quite fair, but so it goes), when
everyone takes their double-agent masks off and bears their collective
souls. Which is to say he never quite lets Entrapment get lost in its own
gadgetry.
Instead, he does another version of the same sleight-of-hand Raiders of the
Lost Ark pulled off once and for all: he not only legitimizes the thief, he
glorifies the thief. The thing is, if we don't have sympathy for the main
character, if we don't want Indiana Jones to get away with the golden idol
(and thus 'preserve' it), then the rest of the movie tends to fall apart.
And there's many ways of legitimizing the theif. Absolute Power does it by
essentially cleansing the (similarly) aging criminal's crime, making it
petty in comparison to the crime he witnesses. Which creates a hierarchy of
criminal acts, which succeeds in making the thief less a thief. Entrapment
goes about it differently. What Mac steals is largely modern art, which the
'modern' world doesn't assign that much value in the first place. So,
suddenly, petty larceny's the name of the game; nobody's starving as a
result of Mac's crime habit. Add to this the fact that he's not stealing it
to resell, but to ornament his Highlander- esque castle, and he's either a
lonely gentleman addicted to the thrill of the game or a particularly
debonair bachelor in need of interior decoration, either of which are
forgivable.
Where Entrapment breaks away from tradition--at least the Bond-type
tradition--is that the narrative finally isn't hinged upon one final stunt
that outdoes all previous stunts, but upon a man and a woman alone in a
train station. This isn't The Jackal or The Saint, with little epilogues
tacked on as an afterthought. Here, the epilogue is the final stunt. While
that may not quite satisfy those who actually expect such developments in a
movie, it does set Entrapment slightly above the usual Bond-replacement,
which, in a Bond-less summer, might just be enough.

In a recent article in PEOPLE magazine, the topic highlighted the
growing but strange trend that more and more films have seasoned
leading actors who are paired with much younger female co-stars.  They
mentioned Harrison Ford and Anne Heche in the summer fluff "Six Days
and Seven Nights" as well as Michael Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow in the
sometimes-chilling "A Perfect Murder."  What would be the draw of a
film featuring a couple where one is twice as old as the other?  Can't
they find similarly talented and similarly aged actors?  That is not to
say that Douglas and Ford are not great leading men.  What girl
wouldn't fall for them?  It also goes without saying that the venerable
Sean Connery (playing an accomplished thief named MacDougal) possesses
an undeniable charm and sophistication.  However, when I see this, in
the back of my mind I feel that Hollywood is just trying to force two
individually good actors into a movie so that it can sell tickets.  But
the drawback of this kind of pairing is that it's hard to find (or
accept) chemistry between two such disparately aged people. 
Immediately, my defenses go up knowing that this will become more of a
distraction rather than a plus.   
What is a plus for this film, however, is it's glossy production of two
skillful thieves.  MacDougal is one of them.  His skills have caught
the attention of insurance agent Jinn (the curvaceous Catherine
Zeta-Jones).  Her specialty is art, and she convinces her boss that he
is responsible for the recent theft of a Rembrandt painting in order to
get the okay to find him.  But, it takes a thief to catch a thief and
she embarks on a trip to track him down with her own secret agenda. 
The result is an uneasy partnership ("first we try, then we trust,"
they say to one another) with the ultimate goal of first stealing a
heavily guarded ancient Chinese mask inside a fortress of a museum and
then one final caper to a bank computer installation where they will
attempt to download enough money to rival the Gross Domestic Product of
a small country.
The best parts of the film are watching these two commit
near-impossible robberies.  All of these sequences are well executed,
hold-your-breath, nail biters.  They use incredibly sophisticated
devices to scale down the side of a skyscraper, to disarm alarms, or to
enter well-guarded strongholds.  To prepare for one of their jobs,
which involves maneuvering through a room full of infrared beams, they
practice by creating a mock-up of the room with yarn used to simulate
the laser beams.  In another sequence, they force their way through a
heavy marble floor, timing their entry to the chimes of Big Ben, which
will drown out their sound.  It's all very neat stuff.  Locales are
also beautiful, which enhances the look of the film.  Despite these
zippy scenes, the romantic aspect between these two thieves seemed
awkward and begins to bog the film down.  As individual thieves, they
are something to behold.  As a couple, they lack energy and excitement.
 And that's too bad, because this film is actually a fairly slick
production with some fine sequences.

Bob the Happy Bastard's Quickie Review:
Sean Connery is an old thief who steals simply for the love of it;
Catherine Zeta-Jones is the insurance agent who wants to bust him wide
open during the heist of a much-adored Chinese mask.  However, as the
movie unfolds, there's many twists and turns to endure, some of which
come across more as puzzling rather than smart.
Still, the movie's got a bit of eclectic zip, thanks mostly to the
onscreen performances by the classy Connery and the delectably sexy
Zeta-Jones.  Ving Rhames doesn't really do much as a side character,
however- it would've been fun to see more of him in the act.  The story
has holes, but, for the most part, delivers the goods, and the heist
scenes are decent espionage fun.
The movie seems to fall apart in its final few minutes with TOO many
twists for its own good, but credit director Jon Amiel for at least
giving believability for a run for its money and for choosing, for the
most part, two actors just right for the lead roles.

1. It's all right to date women forty years your junior, as long as it
looks good on screen. Don't ask me how, but Sean Connery, with his
undeniable lasting charm, gets away with a kiss from the lovely
Catherine Zeta Jones and nobody squirmed!
2. The idea of stealing billions from the world exchange bank on top of
the K.L. Twin Towers is a good idea, but I hear that the bank is
actually imaginary. In fact, the world's tallest building now stands
mostly half empty thanks to the recent SE Asia recession.
3. A story about professional thieving is exciting, and there hasn't
been one of this calibre and quality for awhile. My personal favourite
was a Sidney Sheldon mini series If Tomorrow Never Comes.' My only
complaint is that towards the end, the ability of these professional
thieves becomes too magical when they somehow start jumping trains
mid-motion in heels and dress.
4. This movie will be remembered for some very sensual and sensational
body movements from Zeta Jones, as she twists her firm, slim body
through some tight motions when navigating a maze of laser beams. And
WOW, what a body!

     It's tough to say what ENTRAPMENT will be remembered better for:
Sean Connery's hairpiece, or Catherine Zeta-Jones's ass.  I pick the
ass, and the way it's featured in the trailers for ENTRAPMENT, I'd say
the producers do too.
     If only the rest of the movie was so interesting.  While the idea
is pretty cool: a cop and an art thief tangle in a cat and mouse game,
constantly switching sides, all on the eve of the millenium... it's the
execution that gets 'em every time.
     Connery's the thief, and he does fine work.  Zeta-Jones is the
cop.  Well, she's not a cop.  She's an, um, well, how do I put it? 
She's an *insurance agent*--although unlike any I've ever encountered...
not by a long shot.  And when Connery steals a valuable Rembrandt, does
insurance boss Will Patton send in the feds to catch him?  No!  He sends
Z-J.  Why not?
     Well, most of ENTRAPMENT plays out in head-scratching "Huh? Why?
Eh?" moments like these.  Like how do you "download" money off of a
mainframe?  Why doesn't Connery have locks on the doors to his castle? 
Can you just check valuable art in your baggage?  Why would you leave
DNA evidence (on gum) at the scene of the crime?  And wow do you get
away with the crime if they know exactly who you are?  And why does an
insurance agent get to carry a gun?
     There are no answers to these little riddles... but it's really
moments like Zeta-Jones playing gymnast through "invisible laser beams"
and the constant "disappearing behind a moving train" maneuvers that
really had 'em rolling in the aisles in our screening.
     That's not to say that ENTRAPMENT isn't without its little charms. 
There's exotic locales, clever hi-tech gadgetry, and of course, the
aforementioned ass.  Something to remember when the plot's a distant
memory.
     The presskit claims ENTRAPMENT was sold to Fountainbridge Films
after a Ron Bass pitch only seven lines long.

Warning:  this review contains indirect spoilers!
As far as I'm concerned, with the exception of 'The Hunt for Red October',
the 90's have been a bust for Sean Connery.  Consider, if you will, films
like 'Medicine Man', 'Highlander II: The Quickening', 'First Knight' and
last year's disastrous 'The Avengers'.  His obvious hand at calling a lot of
the shots on the sets of his movies are a mistake.  Connery is the kind of
movie star/actor who is better at leaving the creative end to directors and
writers because Connery's only real talent seems to be his on screen
presence.  This is confirmed by his obvious
capabilities that won him the Oscar in 1987 for 'The Untouchables'.  And,
Connery, as we all know, is the best James Bond there ever has been and/or
ever will be.
Connery, presumably in his last film of the 90's, has redeemed himself with
'Entrapment'.  This film is perhaps one of the cleverest and most shifty
eyed and perceptive films of the year and probably has one of the best
twists since 1995's 'The Usual Suspects'.  Not as multi-layered as that film
was, 'Entrapment' has an even tempo with little break away moments of wit
that make it seem more entertaining than it really is in many scenes.  Its
ability to compensate for some of its slow spots and weaknesses are the
film's greatest asset.
In 'Entrapment', Connery plays a seasoned veteran of crime.  A grand old
master of burglary who is still in the game not because he needs the money
but because he enjoys it.  He is not a small time crook.  He lives in a
castle in the British Isles that looks like it costs several million
dollars.  He has pampered his living quarters with many posh and upscale
artifacts and is a man of culture.  An insurance company in New York City is
investigating what they believe is his latest theft --- the disappearance of
a rare painting.  A former FBI man (Will Patton) is now the head
investigator for the insurance firm whose top go getter (Catharine Zeta
Jones), is excellent as one of his investigative hot shots and believes she
can get close to Connery, plan a job with him and turn him in as part of a
sting operation.  The audience is thrown into a frenzy of guessing games
when it appears that Jones is playing all sides to her advantage in order to
walk away with all of the loot herself.
Director Jon Amiel ('Sommersby', 'Copycat', 'The Man Who Knew Too Little')
structures the film like a game of chess.  He wraps the film in a riddle and
the film is not predictable which is its real pay off.  You'll wander
through 'Entrapment' finding huge plot holes that are large enough to drive
NATO's entire force through but the holes will all be closed as the film
hits its final mark.  Ron Bass and Michael Hertzberg, originators of the
film's story do a good job of creating a plot that doesn't drown in its own
premise.  This is not an action film.  Many of the scenes are very much just
a two character story with direct interaction between its two leads.  It
reminded me in many ways of 1972's 'Sleuth', where Laurence Olivier and
Michael Caine tried to outwit each other.  Will Patton's character as Jones'
boss is also a tepid one although he is on screen very little.  Shades of
Scott Glenn's character from 'The Silence of the Lambs' are the best way to
describes Patton's contribution to the film.
One problem I had with the film were the lazy performances encompassed
within its story.  Connery and Jones seem very relaxed at times and Jones
doesn't have even half of the zest that she possessed in 1998's 'The Mask of
Zorro'.  Ving Rhames, one of the best character actors of his generation and
who is often under used in his films, actually steals some of the scenes
he's in with Connery as a man whose loyalties are not quite understood until
the film's final moments.
'Entrapment' has a genuine look to it that shows the creative forces were
aiming to please all the way and while it's obvious that the film under went
several re-writes before getting it right, the performances could have used
a little spice and keep it from being a good film but one that is not that
memorable.

The trailer worked. I would bet dollars to donuts that the infamous "money
shot" of Catherine Zeta-Jones curving her precious bottom under a laser
beam, pulled in at least half of this film's opening weekend box-office
numbers all on its own. That being said, ol' man Connery probably didn't
hurt the numbers with his Scottish charm and rugged good looks. And what
about the story, you say? Well, two out of three ain't bad.
PLOT:
Rich old guy/career criminal hooks with a beautiful young insurance
agent/undercover thief, to pull a couple of huge international heist jobs.
They train together, look good together, and mistrust each other together.
CRITIQUE:
Entrapment is well, okay...I guess. Its plot is paper thin and packed with
implausibilities, its style is so-so, its acting is so-so, its action scenes
are so-so, in fact, the only thing that makes this film graze the mark of
mediocrity is its two great looking and charming leads, Catherine Zeta-Jones
and Sean Connery. Allright, so we don't really buy the supposed attraction
between Cathy and her 40-year senior Connery, but both actors are so filled
with conviction and charisma, that we don't seem to mind it all that much,
or the fact that the story itself offers very little in originality, action
or suspense. In fact, I'm even afraid to refer to this film as an actual
thriller, seeing that barely a thrill crossed my path until the film's
ultimate finale sequence.
Looking back, I suppose I was never really bored during this film, but never
really impressed by anything either. There were actually a couple of twists
and turns that I didn't foresee, but all of the action in this film was
based on so many preposterous ideas, that it was hard to care about the
story at all. And while the two leads were used effectively in this film,
Ving Rhames and Will Patton were side-players in roles that could've easily
been juiced up to the levels of each talented actor. The film did lack a
certain amount of style, but offered a good international feel, charming
leads and an easy-to-follow, despite being filled with holes, storyline. All
in all, a so-so kind of a movie.
PS: Someone please confirm to me that I did not see a razor-thin mustache
gracing Catherine Zeta-Jones' lovely upper lip throughout this movie...the
horror, the horror.... :)
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Despite her Latin look, Catherine Zeta-Jones is actually Welsh and born in
Swansea, Wales, UK. She stands 5'8". She was apparently handpicked for this
role by actor and producer on this film Sean Connery.
In 1953, Sean Connery entered the Mr. Universe contest, finishing third in
the tall man's division. According to his friend and fellow actor, Michael
Caine, he is a bit of a hypochondriac. He stands 6'3".
THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS (6.5/10) director Antoine Fuqua was originally set
to direct this film. He was eventually replaced by Jon Amiel.
Screenwriter Ron Bass won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for 1989's
RAIN MAN (8/10), starring Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman. Among many other
screenplays, he's also written MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING (7.5/10), STEPMOM
(6/10) and WAITING TO EXHALE.

Stockholm film Review (http://www.reviewfilm.com)
After a daring robbery of a Rembrandt, insurance agent Gin Baker
(Catherine Zeta-Jones) is convinced that a famous art thief,
Robert 'Mac' McDougal (Sean Connery) has been responsible, and
persuades her boss Hector Cruz (Will Patton) to let her go
undercover in order to track Mac down. Hector reluctantly agrees,
and Gin heads to London and soon makes contact with Mac. She
persuades him that she is a fellow thief, and that she needs his
help in order to steal a priceless (what else ?) Chinese mask,
which is on display in an English castle. They devise an intricate
plan to bypass the security systems (which involves lots of lasers),
which involves the help of Mac's associate, Thibadeaux (Ving
Rhames). The questions are, is Mac really convinced that Gin is a
bone fide thief, and what is Gin's real role; undercover agent or
double agent ?
Entrapment is a curiously listless affair. It's intent seems to be
a glossy, fast-paced international thriller, full of exotic locales
and exciting action sequences. Almost like a 007 movie, perhaps ?
However, no amount of tourist scenes from the U.S. and Malaysia can
disguise the fact the movie is more or less set in Scotland. Sound
economics maybe, but not so exotic. Sean Connery produced this
movie and he finished it under budget. It shows. It might also
explain the most puzzling aspect of the film. There are two heists
in the film, the theft of the mask, which takes up most of the
movie, and a cunning scheme to rip of an international bank in
Kuala Lumpur on the eve of the millennium (the film opens 15 days
before the Millennium) which provides the climactic finale to the
film. Though it becomes apparent that the bank heist is intended
to be the highlight of the film, and a complicated job, it
occupies a small amount of screen time. Moreover, Mac and Gin only
have less than 24 hours to read a bunch of detailed schematics of
the world's tallest building, learn about all the security systems
and plan their robbery, and spend half of that time trying to
double-cross each other.
What is even more odd is the amount of time spent avoiding the
alarm laser beams which intersect the exhibition room. This means
that Gin, is a rather fetching, skin-tight costume, must perform
an intricate routine (almost like a ballet) to squeeze between the
beams. While it is great to look at (and, I suspect, the actual
reason for the scene) it accomplishes very little, since the guard
arrives about 10 seconds after they take the mask, and sounds the
alarm. A smash and grab would have achieved the same result. The
bank heist isn't much better, and degenerates into a very routine
chase.
Since Sean Connery is almost seventy years of age, and Miss Jones
is a mere slip of a girl at 29, it was always going to be a bit
difficult to convince the audience that there can be a plausible
romance between the two. In fact, you would find more evidence of
chemistry (organic or otherwise) on the Moon. If anything, their
relationship comes across as more father-daughter, which is probably
even less palatable than a straightforward romance. Moreover, the
Gin character acts more like a teenager than would-be master
criminal, and most of the plotting and attempted double dealing
is either incomprehensible or just silly.
It is possible to make an enjoyable movie with the sort of raw
material available in Entrapment. After all, Brian DePalma managed
such a feat with Mission:Impossible (1996). Jon Amiel not so much
directs as just points in the general direction, in the vague hope
that the film finds its own way. It doesn't. Ving Rhames is sadly
underused (and just about repeats his Mission:Impossible role),
Will Patton doesn't have much to do either, and Maury Chaykin
performance as criminal art collector Conrad Greene is excruciating.
Connery himself looks tired throughout the film, as if perhaps he
has finally realised that he's getting a bit old for this sort of
nonsense. It's not that Entrapment is a very bad movie, just a
very indifferent one. For a thriller, that's not much of a
recommendation, though.

        At the ripe old age of 68, Sean Connery still has what it takes to
carry a motion picture.  Not only is his name still prominent up there on
the marquee, but in "Entrapment," the elegantly aging Connery is asked to
do more than a bivouac of actors half his age and he *still* gets the girl
(even if this one happens to be 40 years his junior).
        While some might take affront to the age difference, I didn't,
simply because Catherine Zeta-Jones ("The Mask of Zorro") has never seemed
much of a push-over on camera.  In "Entrapment," Connery and Zeta-Jones
click, and their relationship is one of two reasons to see the film.  The
other is sitting back and enjoying what is essentially an old-style heist
picture, aided and abetted by some new-fangled technical gadgetry.
        "Entrapment" is the kind of film that re-awakens interest in those
classic caper films of the sixties and seventies, with their rare artifacts
encased in glass, sophisticated surveillance systems, and invisible webs of
laser beams criss-crossing museum floors like an elaborate cat's cradle.
If you've seen the trailers, you'll have seen Zeta-Jones gyrating and
contorting her spandex-clad body under, over, and through the red security
rays.  I guess the producers felt the scene wouldn't have had the same
oomph with Connery in the catsuit.
        Zeta-Jones plays Gin Baker, an insurance investigator who suspects
that the recent theft of a Rembrandt painting from a seemingly impenetrable
skyscraper is the work of master art thief Robert MacDougal.  In order to
prove it, she sets up a similarly impossible heist, with an antique Chinese
mask as the bait, and convinces "Mac" to work with her.  She has the code;
he has the know-how.  Inevitably, their cat-and-mouse antics lead to
discovery, but then Gin dangles an even bigger carrot in front of the
charismatic Scot.
        In a brilliant piece of "casting," the world's tallest
building--Kuala Lumpur's Petronas Towers--provides the international
banking setting for Gin's latest scam.  Her plan is to "stall" time for ten
seconds on the eve of the millennium when computer security is temporarily
shut down, allowing her to download $8 billion dollars into her private
account.  Is this the time to try, or to trust, as our leading players like
to ask.
        Director Jon Amiel keeps a tight lid on the proceedings, focusing
the camera as much on his two principals--and their busy stunt doubles--as
possible.
        Ving Rhames is underutilized as MacDougal's shady associate, but
that's just as well since his character is an atypically unpleasant one.
Maury Chaykin almost makes up for Rhames' disappointing appearance by
providing a small but entertaining role as an ultra-affected Malaysian art
lover.
        There are high-rise thrills and spills and a well-grounded
relationship that rarely steps outside of its "let's not get personal"
confines.  "Entrapment" is good, clean, escapist fun.  "Welcome to the
rock, Miss Moneypenny."

Hollywood's fascination with the older man-younger woman romance
continues in the heist drama, Entrapment.  Sean Connery and Catherine
Zeta-Jones are the cross-generational lovers.  Their lukewarm romance is
the pitiful highlight of this thoroughly ridiculous film.
Robert MacDougal (Sean Connery), aka "Mac", is a master thief, rich
beyond all wildest dreams. He steals now for the challenge, seeing each
potential theft as a magnificent puzzle to be solved.  He is the best of
the best, and has never been caught.
Gin Baker(Catherine Zeta-Jones) is an insurance investigator who has
been tracing Mac's illustrious career.  She gets approval from her boss,
Cruz (Will Patton), to go undercover and trap Mac in a heist.  However,
Gin has other plans in mind...
Entrapment is a movie with only one redeeming value:  the personal
charisma of its stars.  The dialogue is horrible, the plotting
ridiculous, and even the stunts aren't all that alluring.  But when Sean
Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones are on the screen, you start to forget
how bad a movie this really is.
But it is bad...very bad.  The movie starts with some promise, in a
whiz-bang robbery scene right off the bat.  But when the dialogue kicks
in, the technical wizardry seems to go out the window, and the entire
film deflates into nothingness.
The plot hinges around the upcoming millennium shift.  It's a timely
topic, but the screenwriters apparently didn't research Y2K issues much
deeper than the name.  Then again, nothing in this movie seems to be
very well researched.  From security measures to tricks of the thieving
trade, the details of the film all seem to be invented off the cuff.
The leads, appealing as they are, are hopelessly trapped in their
shallow characters.  Sean Connery is actually given very little to do.
His role here is more of a coach than a player.   Catherine Zeta-Jones
would be much more enchanting if her character  wasn't constantly
whining and pouting.
Don't be lured into Entrapment on the basis of the stars alone. The
power of their sheer presence can only lift the movie so far. Entrapment
isn't worth the heist.

     At least ENTRAPMENT lets you know what your in for from its opening
shot, a sweeping helicopter approach over water towards the New York
skyline.  It's a shot that has opened many a recent film, one of those
showy mood-setters of which imagination-impaired directors are so very
fond.  Of course, you can't expect much more from a director when he's
working with imagination-impaired writers.  There are movies that repulse
you, movies that enthrall you, and then there are movies that just plug
away joylessly to fill a genre slot on a release schedule.  ENTRAPMENT is
one of those movies apparently made by people who have spent their entire
lives locked away from the world watching other movies...and not even
other _good_ movies.
     The set-up finds an insurance investigator named Virginia "Gin" Baker
(Catherine Zeta-Jones) fascinated with the career of a legendary art thief
named Robert "Mac" MacDougal (Sean Connery).  Mac has cost Gin's company
millions, so Gin convinces her boss (Will Patton) to let her launch a plan
to reel him in.  Posing as a thief herself, Gin lures Mac into a
partnership to steal a priceless Chinese mask.  The alliance is, of
course, an uneasey one, complicated by the distrust of Mac's partner and
supplier Thibadeaux (Ving Rhames) and the romantic feelings developing
between the two duplicitous characters.
     It's possible that ENTRAPMENT could have gotten away with being just
a heist thriller; the elaborately choreographed break-ins are decently
crafted, and offer at least an occasional whiff of tension. Unfortunately,
the script -- credited to Ron Bass and William Broyles, but actually the
work of several more -- wants to cast Gin and Mac as star-crossed lovers,
kindred spirits divided by their hidden agendas.  It's a thoroughly failed
attempt, since the characters are kept so enigmatic that it's never
possible to understand their attraction, and their exchanges are so leaden
that they might as well have the pages of the script on the table in front
of them.  Meanwhile, the pacing grows so lugubrious as Gin and Mac
exchange loaded glances that you're likely to nod off between break-in set
pieces.
     The other option for a viewer is to use that time to play Spot the
Cliche.  Be sure to have your pad and pen ready from that opening
helicopter shot, because ENTRAPMENT appears to be the product of a
Script-O-Matic.  From the B-follows-A dialogue exchanges (She: "There
won't be any surprises."  He: "There _always_ are surprises.") to the
physics-defying disappearing acts, from the ominous location-identifying
on-screen titles to the training montage, the film is on auto-pilot from
start to finish.  Thank heaven for Ving Rhames' vaguely menacing
performance, and Maury Chaykin's bizarre Sidney Greenstreet-meets-Truman
Capote crime boss, or there might not have been a second of ENTRAPMENT
worth remembering a day later.  It's designed to be swallowed without
chewing. 
     I suppose that's partially to avoid giving anyone in the audience
reason to ponder the jaw-dropping gaps in logic.  ENTRAPMENT ends with one
of those "betcha didn't see that coming" conclusions which, frankly, I
_didn't_ see coming.  I'd also long ago given up caring, especially when
the behavior of the characters at certain points in the film makes no
sense whatsoever when compared to what we eventually learn about them.
You can only forgive that kind of laziness-disguised-as-cleverness if a
film has been working hard to entertain you, to keep you engaged from
start to finish.  ENTRAPMENT is a film that just doesn't care.  It's a
film about theft, all right...of your money, your time, and the devices of
a dozen other trite Hollywood star projects.

Written by Ronald Bass and William Broyles, Jr.
Starring Sean Connery, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Ving Rhames, and Will Patton.
     Someone find me a cure, I'm obsessed with film.  Sure, there's your
general movie buff, who digests about a hundred or so films a year.  Then
there's your true obsessive-compulsive film watcher.  He has HBO, Showtime,
and a fair sized video collection and still watches about three hundred
films a year.  Then you have your movie fanatic.  A man who can recite, word
for word, the script from a movie you've never heard of, he has all the
premium channels, watches edited films on cable, and a fine video
collection.  Then you have me.  In my best year, 1996, I saw 2/3 of the
films in national release.  I have a video collection of about three hundred
EP tapes, plus several tapes I have bought.  I have two premium channels
that I watch at least three movies on a week and I am steadily building a
DVD collection.  When there is a sneak preview, I will be there.  When I can
get videos for reduced cost or for free, I will get them.  Like Candance
Bushnell is reputed to buy shoes, I buy movies.
     So, when the chance presented itself to see Entrapment early, how could
I resist?  I was willing to travel more time than it took me to see a movie,
end up back home at about 11:00, and get my first fix of seeing a sneak
preview in about a year and a half.
     Seeing it, I remembered how refreshing sneak previews are.  I
remembered why I started going to them in the first place (aside from my
neurotic need to see a movie before anyone else does) people cheered.
    This may have been the general air of the screener, one of excitement as
fairly ordinary people's days are lit up by seeing a movie before it comes
out. Of the prizes won, the prizes lost, but, you know what, I'm willing to
think that it was the movie that made people cheer.
    Entrapment is not really anything new to the world of crime fiction as
far as books are concerned. In books, we see capers so well planned that you
can't help but love them. Entrapment, however, is the first movie I've seen
with exceptionally planned robberies, ones that go above and beyond the norm
of the break in and do the job antics that populate Hollywood. It goes
beyond nicely plotted, it goes beyond nicely planned. Both are cinematic
aspects planned to a T.
    The story is basically one of love among thieves. Sean Connery is a
crack jewel thief (the best in the world, of course Monty Penny) who is
being chased by Gin Baker, a woman working for an insurance company (at a
desk). As they are brought together by a high profile heist of a Rembrant,
the two begin to develop a strange love-hate relationship. Connery and Gin,
begin to plot to get an ancient Chinese mask worth $40 million with an even
better heist planned after that.
    I'd love to tell you more, but part of the fun of Entrapment (besides
pulse-pounding action, and the sex appeal of Catherine Zeta-Jones for men
and Sean Connery for women) is not knowing for sure what's going to happen
next. Yeah, you know everything will turn out honky-dory, and you know that
they'll make it through their heists, but you don't quite know what's
coming. You have general ideas, but they won't help you that much.
    Unlike Jon Amiel's previous film, Copycat, Entrapment does not have more
plot holes than stones in a graveyard he learned from his mistakes and used
some spackle to cover what could be some potentially irreconcilable damages
to the plot. It takes care to answer every how, why, when, and what.
    In fact, on this film almost everybody does their jobs. Sean Connery
shows the same off-kilter charm he showed with every one of the James Bond
films. Catherine Zeta-Jones is always able to look as good as she acts, and
Ving Rhames is able to show off the basic street charm that's made him
famous. Will Patton plays as good (or bad) of a jerk as he always has. The
cinematographer does his job by throwing in some very impressive shots. The
writers do their jobs by making an action movie a critic can enjoy.
    Yes, as always, I'm not going to completely laud the film. I have my
stupid gripe, and for Entrapment it would have to be that Catherine
Zeta-Jones can't keep her voice steady for the first half of the picture.
It gives you the sense that she was basically like `Yes, I'm acting with
Sean Connery, now let me act like a ditz!' Not to say she did a bad job she
didn't, but either her or the mike operators screwed up.
    Well, that's about all I can tell you, except that with Entrapment, the
best thing to do is sit back, relax, and let Entrapment trap you.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
I had two good ways to start off my review for Entrapment but couldn't
decide on which to use.
There is the more obvious approach: Goofing on the studio's tagline for
the film - `The trap is set' - by saying something clever, like that the
`bait' is its two charismatic leads and the `trap' is an utterly
implausible story, with unsuspecting viewers being snared by its star
power and eye-popping trailer.
Then there is the more polished route: Taking a piece of dialogue from
the film and then turning it around to poke fun at the filmmakers, who
obviously felt that this particular chunk of babble was so important
that it had to be repeated a few times - like `First we try, then we
trust.'  I could say that potential moviegoers might use this wisdom to
decide whether to fork over seven bucks to see a film that was directed
by the guy who filmed the Bill Murray bomb The Man Who Knew Too Little
(not to mention the producer of 1999's worst film, Simply Irresistible)
and written by the guy responsible for four consecutive bore-fests (My
Best Friend's Wedding, How Stella Got Her Groove Back, What Dreams May
Come and Stepmom).
The film opens just weeks before the millenium during the high-tech
robbery of a heavily guarded office in a New York City skyscraper.  The
bandit makes off with a Botticelli painting, but has a sense of humor
and leaves a velvet painting of Elvis in its stead.  The cagey thief
jams the rolled-up masterpiece into a mailing tube  addressed to Kuala
Lumpur  and drops it down the building's mail chute.
The brigand is believed to be super-criminal Robert `Mack' MacDougal
(Sean Connery, The Avengers), an aging villain known for his daring
larceny who has been hunted for years by a company that insures high
prices of art around the world.  Legend has it that years ago, two if
its employees were sent to apprehend Mack and were never heard from
again.  Mysterious, eh?
Catherine Zeta-Jones (The Mask of Zorro) is an employee of this
insurance company, as well as a limber gymnast and a bit of an
aficionado of the Mack legacy.  She convinces her boss (Will Patton, The
Postman) to let her go after Mack, but are her intentions to entrap the
unscrupulous burglar, or to join him in the biggest robbery that the
world has ever seen?  You won't find out who's playing whom until the
end.
While Entrapment is not particularly bad, it does offer plot holes
bigger than Dionne Warwick's nostrils.  Case in point: Viewers won't
have a clue what Zeta-Jones' character is named until about two-thirds
of the way into the film, when Mack calls to her.  And even then, you're
not sure what he said.  Jen?  Gem?  Jed?  It's actually Gin  as in
Virginia  but you get the idea.
And how about the part where Gin and Mack steal an ancient Chinese mask
from a room guarded with several dozen security lasers?  Sure, it's
suspenseful  Gin has only three minutes to maneuver through the
grid-like maze, make off with the mask and get out  but it takes her
2:25 just to get to the booty, leaving only 35 seconds to escape.
Viewers don't get to see the escape, but I'm sure must have been quite
dazzling.  Maybe the picture was running too long and that part had to
be cut out.  Hey, you've gotta cut something.
The ending is also exciting, involving a risky $8 billion heist at the
International Clearance House Bank in Malaysia, but this stuff has all
been done better before.  Even in 1992's Sneakers, starring another guy
who seemed too old to be getting himself into trouble (Robert Redford,
who was still decades younger than Connery is now).  On the positive
side, Entrapment isn't bogged down by silly subplots  there are very
few characters in the film  and its action sequences are capably lensed
by Philip Meheux (The Mask of Zorro).  Ving Rhames (Out of Sight)
provides big laughs as Mack's confidante and tech supplier, while Maury
Chaykin (Mouse Hunt) has a very hammy role as a Kuala Lumpur fencer of
incredibly valuable `hot' pieces of art.  His character would not have
handled this film.

Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones both carry some star power. Connery
is the epitome of James Bond. And even now he is still doing the part of
Bond  take a look at his character Mason in The Rock. Zeta-Jones coming
off her hot debut in The Mask of Zorro is a hot commodity these days. With
this much star power this movie can't lose -- or can it?
Mac (Sean Connery) is a professional thief who is rich enough that he
doesn't have to steal for the money  he steals for the enjoyment and the
thrill. Gin (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is an insurance agent for a large
insurance company. She is going undercover and working hand in hand with
Mac in order to catch him in the act of stealing. She's the bait for the
entrapment of Mac during the next robbery, a theft of a beautiful Chinese
mask. But, is Gin all that she says she is?
We have two other minor characters who are in the shadows most of the time,
but we get the sneaking suspicion that they have a hand in all that is
happening. These two are Gin's boss Hector (Will Patton) Cruz and Mac's
former partner Thibadeaux (Ving Rhames). Patton, who I loved in Armageddon,
plays Cruz without much flair and the accent that he adopts feels
counterfeit. Rhames doesn't get enough screen time to do anything
substantial, his talents are completely wasted in Entrapment.
The script by Ron Bass (My Best Friend's Wedding) and William Broyles Jr.
takes us on a whirlwind tour of the world, stopping at many photogenic
locations. But, all of this eye candy and beautiful cinematography doesn't
matter since the script is weak. The lack of thrills is the downfall of
this film. The script isn't the only thing that is flat in this film though.
Sean Connery gives a wooden performance as Mac. His performance is lacking
that onscreen charisma that we've come to love from him. Because of his
mediocre performance there is no real tension between him and Zeta-Jones
and the sexual tension between the two fizzles. At times the relationship
between Mac and Gin felt more father-daughter like than romantic.
The direction from Jon Amiel is surprisingly tame. Amiel who directed one
of the best thrillers I've seen, CopyCat, is bland in this film. The
tension-filled scenes are lax, with the focus more on Zeta-Jones's curves
than on the action. Amiel was not the first director hired for this film
though. Amiel took over the helm from Antoine Fuqua. Fuqua was the director
who pumped life into the lifeless film The Replacement Killers. Fuqua's
direction in Entrapment would have raised it out of mediocrity  Fuqua has
a keen eye for style that, when applied correctly, would have made us
forget about the horribly thin script.
Had it not been for the multiple, seemingly contrived, twists at the end of
the film, I would have walked out of the theatre fuming. But, the twists
were pretty fun to watch unfold and I walked out of the theatre with a
slight smile on my face. I don't recommend seeing Entrapment in the
theatres, matinee or otherwise. Though, this would be a good pick for a
weekend video rental. 
 a guy with a helluva attitude who loves the cinema.
 i'm your hard boiled movie guide.

 For anyone who has caught on to my overall taste in movies, you know 
 that, while I give everything a chance, espionage/spy/thief action 
 pictures are definately not my cup of tea. They all seem very much the 
 same, and I find the large majority of them either dull or crushing 
 bores. But with that said, I liked "Entrapment," in a kinda-sorta way, 
 thanks to the wonderful repartee of Sean Connery (in his first good film 
 in a long time) and Catherine Zeta-Jones, who is a sparkling new talent 
 that I have instantly fallen in love with. Sure, she's absolutely 
 beautiful, but she also has a sneaky way with words and is able to 
 modify her mildly underwritten character into a wholeheartedly 
 believable, not to mention likable, creation.
 Virginia "Gin" Baker (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is a New York insurance 
 investigator who has tracked down and been following the expert art 
 thief, Robert "Mac" MacDougal (Sean Connery). After spying on him on one 
 occasion, she is awaken in the middle of the night by Mac, who reveals 
 that he is one step ahead of her. Posing as a thief herself, Gin makes a 
 proposal to him: help her steal an ancient Chinese mask worth millions. 
 As the last days of 1999 close in, which will inevitably cause a 
 "millenium bug" in all of the computers, Gin also forms another plan, 
 this one with the stakes heightened: steal $8-billion from the largest 
 and tallest bank in the world (located in Malaysia) and they will split 
 the money, but the theft has to be done during the last ten minutes 
 before the new year.
 "Entrapment," like the similar, but in my opinion inferior, James Bond 
 films, spans across the globe from the already-mentioned Nfrom the 
 already-mentioned New York to Malaysia to Scotland, where Mac's castle 
 is located. As Mac and Gin get deeper and deeper in over their heads, 
 Mac grows suspicious of Gin's possible false identity and her motives, 
 while Gin fears that she, through all of their bickering, might actually 
 be falling for him. In case this subplot is unbelievable, don't worry. 
 Although Zeta-Jones is 28-years-old and Connery is 68, this is the least 
 to worry about when you're dealing with such a preposterous, but 
 admittedly entertaining, story. Besides, Connery has aged very well 
 (like Warren Beatty and Robert Redford), and so their budding romance 
 isn't quite as much of a stretch as the downright ragged Clint Eastwood 
 and his near-laughable womanizing character
 Although never a particular fan of Connery's (who played James Bond 
 himself, primarily, in the '60s and '70s), he is very charismatic and 
 enjoyable here, even when we aren't sure if his character of Mac should 
 be trusted. Matching, and actually surpassing, his performance is 
 Zeta-Jones, who was last seen in "The Mask of Zorro" (which I opted to 
 skip when it was in theaters) and will be appearing in "The Haunting" 
 this July. She has a lovely, innocent, but at the same time experienced, 
 face that you could stare at for hours on end, and a fetching 
 personality to play. I loved, for example, the scene in which Mac asks 
 her if there has ever been someone she hasn't been able to seduce, and 
 without a moment's thought and with a sly grin, replies, "no." Without 
 Connery and Zeta-Jones, and without the fun that is had concerning the 
 tension between them, "Entrapment" wouldn't have been nearly as 
 successful, and it is their casting that, to me, was the most vital 
 element in making the whole picture.
 The two action set-pieces, one in which they attempt to steal the 
 Chinese mask, and the climactic sequence in which they set out to steal 
 billions from the bank, are stylishly and expertly crafted. Back at 
 Mac's Scottish castle, he trains Gin to be able to slink through the 
 invisible criss-crossing laser beams in order to get to the mask, and a 
 great deal of suspense is stirred up in this scene. The climax, also, is 
 breathtaking, with Mac and Gin being spotted stealing the billions and 
 in their desperation to escape, must crawl out onto an unsteady wire 
 seventy stories in the air, above a prestigious New Year's celebration.
 When all is said and done, "Entrapment" is a fun and completely amiable 
 precursor to the upcoming onslaught of Summer movies. There's nothing 
 extraordinary about it, it isn't likely to stick in your mind as some of 
 the best films do, and the plotting leaves several holes. The supporting 
 characters are all wasted, including Ving Rhames as a friend and 
 gadgetry-supplier of Mac's, but that was fine with me since the heart of 
 the film belongs to the delicate and nicely-acquired relationship 
 between Connery and Zeta-Jones. "Entrapment" isn't a particularly 
 fulfilling experience, but it easily gets the job done.

Starring Sean Connery; Catherine Zeta-Jones; Ving Rhames; Will Patton &
Maury Chaykin
First, let me get something off my chest. Over the last few days I have been
reading the reviews of Entrapment. All anybody seems to be able to talk
about is the romantic pairing between Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones.
I'm really beginning to wonder if I saw the same film that these critics
did. I didn't think that the age difference was such a big deal. Especially
not considering the story behind it. This may sound a bit sexist, but here
goes. As far as I know, the main audience for an action movie is young
males. So it seems perfectly reasonable to me to cast a young, very
attractive actress in the leading role. Many of the critics have wondered
why an actress closer to Connery's age wasn't cast in the Zeta-Jones role.
Some have even suggested Meryl Streep. Streep might be a great actress, but
even in her prime, she didn't look half as good as Zeta-Jones. I guarantee
you that half the reason that people are flocking to Entrapment is to see
Zeta-Jones. Young guys aren't going to spend money to see Meryl Streep in an
action film. They certainly aren't going to pay to watch her writhe through
the much publicized laser beam shots in which Ms. Zeta-Jones' behind is so
prominently displayed. Am I just a sexist pig? Or is it just realistic to
think that Hollywood makes movies with the intention of making money. And
Catherine Zeta-Jones is going to get a whole lot more people into the
theater than an older actress. I'd like to see Angela Landsbury look that
good in spandex.
And now, our feature presentation. Entrapment is what I like to call a
popcorn film. It is your typical big budget summer movie. It is all style
and the plot is a fairly simple one. Although, it does manage to throw a few
curve balls. The chemistry that Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones had on
screen was amazing. Quite frankly, I got so wrapped up watching the two of
them that I might not have even noticed if there was no plot at all. He is
still one of the top leading men in movies, even though he is almost 70.
Zeta-Jones, in addition to her obvious stunningly classic beauty, is one of
the most talented actresses that is working in film today. Her beauty gives
her a captivating screen presence, but her considerable talent certainly
doesn't hurt either. The combination of Connery and Zeta-Jones plus some of
the most stylish direction that I've seen in a while, all adds up to one fun
film. The supporting cast of Ving Rhames and Will Patton are like icing on a
great cake.
Entrapment focuses on insurance investigator Gin Baker (Catherine
Zeta-Jones). She has set her sights on bringing to justice master thief
Robert MacDougall (Sean Connery). In order to catch him, she must first gain
his confidence. She does so by pretending to be in need of his services for
a very high profile robbery. He agrees, and the two team up to pull off the
ultimate heist, using the latest in amazing high-tech devices. Of course,
this is Hollywood, so not everything goes quite according to the way we the
audience thinks it will.
I don't think that I have ever seen a movie in which Sean Connery gave a bad
performance. Entrapment doesn't change that. Connery still looks as much at
home in the role of action star as he did in 1962, when he first played
James Bond, the role that made him a household name. I suppose that it's a
bit of an irony that many people who will undoubtedly flock to see this
movie may never even have seen some of the original Bond films. Catherine
Zeta-Jones made her mark in 1998's The Mask Of Zorro. She held her own
against Anthony Hopkins in that film, and she proves that she is more than
capable of doing it again in Entrapment. I would go so far as to say that
she even outshines Connery in a few scenes. Contrary to popular belief, she
didn't just become an overnight success with The mask Of Zorro. She was an
accomplished actress for over a decade before that film was made. Her
experience shows with her performance in Entrapment. The Mask Of Zorro might
have made her a star, but her performance in Entrapment will ensure that she
stays one. Ving Rhames plays a sort of assistant to Connery's thief. He is
the man who procures all of the high tech tools of the trade that are used
in the spectacular robberies. Will Patton is also present as Zeta-Jones'
boss at the insurance company. Both Rhames and Patton were a little under
used in my opinion, but both give the solid performances that audiences have
come to expect from them.
The plot was a bit over the top in places, but it didn't hurt the film. Most
of the questionable plot devices led to spectacular stunts or nifty visual
effects. So, I for one, wasn't complaining. And the twists and turns of the
story line more than made up for any minor weaknesses in my book. Entrapment
is a great looking film. And I'm not just talking about Zeta-Jones. Director
Jon Amiel makes the most of the exotic scenery that, more often than not,
surrounds his cast. The high tech robbery scenes, in addition to being very
well filmed, also have that air of believability about them. Even as
fantastic as some of them are, I was never left thinking that none of it
could possibly happen.
Entrapment is a light summer film. The story is a fun one, and I appreciated
the extra effort of some of the plot twists in the story. Of course none of
these plot twists are designed to make you think real hard -- just keep you
guessing a bit. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that Entrapment will
probably end up as one of my favorite movies of 1999.

This slick and undeniably entertaining thriller about a
seductive female insurance investigator who tries to catch a suave
thief almost makes the forthcoming remake of the 1968 caper movie The
Thomas Crown Affair redundant.  Entrapment takes the basic plot
details and updates them with sophisticated technology of the late
'90's, and throws in a few extra twists and turns to make it more
interesting.  Cleverly written by Ron Bass (Rain Man, etc), Entrapment
also brings to mind Hitchcock's To Catch A Thief and its ilk.  The
film adheres closely to the charming formula of those wonderful caper
thrillers from the '60's, but adds a few cynical 90's touches.
When a $25 million Rembrandt is stolen from a New York
skyscraper, insurance investigator Virginia "Gin" Baker (Catherine
Zeta-Jones, who last heated up the screen in the entertaining The Mask
Of Zorro) sets out to prove that notorious but debonair cat burglar
and art thief Robert MacDougal (Sean Connery) is responsible.  She
plans to trap him by convincing him to help steal a priceless Chinese
heirloom from a museum.  But she also has another agenda in mind.
MacDougal soon finds himself involved in trying to steal billions from
Malaysia's high-tech securities bank on the eve of the new millennium.
As with the great caper comedies of the past, the film
explores in detail the elaborate plotting and daring execution of
their impossible robberies.  The uneasy relationship that slowly
develops between the pair is further characterised by a mutual lack of
trust.
British director Jon Amiel (The Singing Detective, etc) is
better known for his off beat comedies, but he brings plenty of
suspense and tension to the material.  The key set pieces are superbly
staged.  There are a number of implausibilities within the convoluted
plot, and a willing suspension of disbelief comes in handy.
However, the sheer chemistry between the two stars more than
carries the movie.  Connery may be the oldest action hero in the
business, but he shows few signs of slowing down or making concessions
for his age.  He still oozes charisma and carries off the role with
deceptive ease and conviction.  The gorgeous Zeta-Jones is seductive,
sultry and heats up the screen as the tough heroine.  Unlike many
other superannuated stars, Connery actually makes the older
man-younger woman dynamic work here.  Connery and Zeta-Jones develop a
real chemistry, and their scenes together positively shimmer with a
palpable sexual tension.  Ving Rhames (from Mission: Impossible, etc)
is along for the ride as the enigmatic Thibadeaux, whose involvement
in the scheme of things is never really explained until the
conclusion.
The ending is a little clumsily handled, but otherwise
Entrapment quickly snares audiences with its appealing and
sophisticated combination of suspense, romance and old fashioned
entertainment.

It's like a bad hair day.With high expectations you enter a newer, much
talked about beauty salon. You exit  looking terrible. Fluffy is good but
uglifying fluffy is not. You go to the movie Entrapment  in a positive
state of mind since no matter what he plays, Sean Connery is appealing
simply "because he's there" --like Everest . Also, because last July,
co-star Catherine Zeta-Jones made a strong American debut in The Mask of
Zorro.
Among more esoteric criteria, there's curiosity as to what Brit-born
director John Amiel hath wrought. His feature debut Queen of Hearts (UK)
was excellent; his next films ,U.S. made were the quirkily original Tune in
Tomorrow; Sommersby ( the remake of The Return of Martin Guerre), and
Copycat , both ho-hum; The Man Who Knew Too Little, a fizzle.
Producer-writer Ron Bass has scripted or co-authored Rainman, Gardens of
Stone, Sleeping with the Enemy, The Joy Luck Club, and more .Lately he
perpetrated What Dreams Come True. William Broyles co-wrote Apollo 13. The
reputation of the technical crew (cinematographer, designer, editor, etc.)
is solid. And it is the techs who are the real makers of Entrapment. Q: For
better or for worse?  A: for worse.
In the opening sequences, a totally masked human being dives a huge
distance from the top of a New York skyscraper down to the outside of a
large picture window. The creature uses incredible gadgetry and carries on
its body enough super-high-tech gizmos to build a Ferrari. The break-in
nets a Rembrandt painting.
Right away the outrageous gadgetry is like a warning sign to the viewer. At
first, like a yellow traffic light.  In the next few minutes it turns red.
Expectations are rapidly discouraged.
Cut to the big insurance company which will have to shell out $24 million.
Investigator Gin talks her supervisor Hector Cruz (pronounced Cruise) who
pants discreetly in the presence of the beauty, to let her go after the
thief.
Videos of an auction confirm that the robber has to be the master of them
all, the  mega- I.Q. Mac. The videos are providential, as everything else.
Nothing ever goes terminally wrong. Name the place, time, planning,
operation, method,equipment, throughout the flick all work with the
precision of an atomic clock -- and to the detriment of even a shadow of
believability. More discouragements for viewers.
In London, Gin stalks Mac, Mac stalks Gin. When they get together Gin
declares that she was the robber of the Rembrandt. "Now can be a good time
for you and I to discuss something" says  suave Connery, whose smoothness
does not extend to the English grammar. They join forces for a series of
feats-- but not feasts for our brains.
Gimmickry keeps bombarding us. It replaces what logically should have been
the step-by- step development of heists, scams and such, from conception,
to planning, to modus operandi.. We are placed before "faits accomplis."
All this involves double- and triple-crossings, mistrusts, Mac's princely
castle in Scotland, a call-box that just happens to be in view of the
mansion (Mac predictably monitors Gin's call to her boss), the reaching of
an exposition by underwater means.The duo remove their diving outfits to
appear in public in impeccable formal clothes.They perpetrate a  highest
-tech robbery of an invaluable Chinese mask. All this keeps the viewer at
arm's length, uninvolve, without a stake in the game.I have nothing against
techno-flicks, even think fondly of some, like the wrongly disparaged
WarGames. But man cannot live by computer chips alone.
The couple take off for Kuala Lumpur, in Malaysia, for what will be a
climax of a scheme of Gin's. At the start of the new millennium, via
computer strategies, big money establishments will  find themselves eight
billion (with a b) dollars lighter.
What surfaces is a) a case of aesthetic blindness. Looking at the
backwaters of the city, Gin warbles "Isn't it beautiful?" (My answer :NO!
); b) the reappearance of diverse characters, all even less than
unidimensional; c) the main action. It  takes place during the Millennium
revelry at, in, and between the interconnected twin towers of the tallest
building in the world. All this is beyond the possibilities of sane
descriptions. The phony wrap-up, a  happy ending that, while not hi-tech,
makes no sense, is strictly from hunger.
Matters are so incredible that they veer from ridiculousness to script
stupidity. I realize that this entire turmoil is supposed to be amusing,
but my funny bone was paralyzed. A few good moments are overwhelmed by the
mechanical nature of things. It's not just Missions Impossible but also
Suspense Impossible. At least, whether bored or not, the viewers won't be
offended by the picture. That's a teeny plus.
(There may be an exception, though. Actor Ving Rhames, who seems to be
Mac's main purveyor of high-tech stuff --but wait-- is, I hear, highly
principled, moral and religious. Yet he plays the movie's sole purveyor of
cascading four-letter words. It jars).
What about love and sex, you'll say? By moviedom's Ten Commandments there
has to be mutual attraction. For a change, it is made into a hesitant
flirtation, a "pas de deux" miles away from the instant bonding of James
Bond and his cuties. But then, if filmmakers go for cliches, they ought to
have the courage of their convictions. Too little time is devoted to
romance.At one point, Rhames reminds Connery "Hey, you're 60." In reality
he was 68 when the film was made, and made with an uncomfortable, secret
awareness of his true age. The couple is handled diffidently, as if with
roadsigns that warn "Dangerous Curves. Reduce Speed."
James Bond was a bedding-downer, not a lover. But 23 years ago, in Robin
and Marian, the aging, scarred, battle-weary  Robin (Connery) and the aging
nun Marian (Audrey Hepburn) gave us a splendid, beautiful, moving love
story. With a little more daring, while never talking to the mind,
Entrapment could have spoken to the heart  had it propped up its awfully
dull dialogue and un-propped the stage props.
The overwrought, cartoonish, supra-tech nature of the yarn dehumanizes
everything. By comparison, it  makes even the James Bond adventures feel
realistic and rich in characters. Here however, total and unstoppable
incoherence takes us from plain yawns to giga-yawns. It can be dangerous if
you also feel like gagging.The solution is for your brain to gag and your
jaws to yawn.

As I watched "Entrapment" I found myself wondering if Sean Connery could 
estimate the quality of a script he was shooting.
If he can, he surely realized this one was mediocre.
It's the story of Robert MacDougal (Sean Connery), called "Mac."  He's a 
world-class art thief, and the insurance company that covers the stolen 
works is very upset.  Waverly Insurance employs an expert, Gin (Catherine 
Zeta-Jones) to analyze his methods.  Overzealous, Gin is granted permission 
actually to track down Mac, in London.  The old and wily thief is soon on to 
her, but she convinces Mac she is a sort of double agent, a thief herself 
only posing as an expert in solving crimes by dismantling them.  Soon she 
and Mac land at his remote castle on the coast of Britain, where they 
rehearse the methodology of this particular crime - the stealing of a golden 
Chinese mask.  With daring skill they break into an enormous manor, and Gin 
begins her practiced body movements to elude the lasers that would trip the 
alarm.  Watch these scenes for Zeta-Jones doing her martial arts of 
elusiveness, bending and twisting along what seems to be an open floor.
After this caper is successful, the control of the criminal duo shifts.  Now 
Gin seems to be the one manipulating "Mac," and as they travel to Malaysia 
to engineer the scheme she has created, a romance clearly begins to develop. 
  The climax of the film is a high-tech bank heist on the crack of the new 
millenium, and indeed the high points of the story include the actual 
robberies I've described.
But there are too many low points for the film to take its place as anything 
more than a minor espionage flick.  Connery is a masterful actor, and 
Zeta-Jones holds her own opposite him, except during occasional bouts of 
adolescent anger.  What these players are working with is not enough help.  
The cuts are often too fast, and director Jon Amiel does not allow adequate 
time for the development either of character or of meaningful relationships. 
  Will Patton is miscast as the honcho from  Waverly insurance:  he's given 
a darkened mustache and Hispanic name, Hector Cruz.  Ving Rhames sketches 
his character - Thibadeaux, apparently a right-hand man for Mac - with 
authority and menace, a performance that is effective but perhaps too easy 
for the physically imposing actor.  (Someone, please cast this wonderful 
presence against type!)  The film does benefit from changes in scenery, its 
international locales lending variety and at times stunning beauty.  But are 
these elements enough to salvage a film that tries to draw its strength from 
the oldest tricks in the spy/thief genre?  And yes, we know early what's in 
store for us - as many turnabouts of identity as can be packed into a plot, 
some of them downright red herrings.
"Entrapment," a solid one-word title, is passable entertainment, but I would 
suggest seeing it as we did, in a second-run theater.  You'll like the 
gadgets and the figurative meanings that reflect about the screen like 
deflected lasers.  But you'll also sense the places responsible for 
mediocrity

 Starring Sean Connery, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Ving Rhames. Rated PG-13.
There are some pairs of actors and actresses that can light up the screen
when they are together. Can you recall how well Jack Lemmon and Walter
Matthau mixed before they degraded to the likes of such travesties as The Odd
Couple 2? Remember how luminous a screen pair Julia Roberts and Rupert
Everett were in My Best Friend's Wedding? If movie stars have chemistry they
can do wonders for a film, and there is no better example than the terrific
action thriller Entrapment, in which the show belongs to the aging Sean
Connery and the gorgeous Catherine Zeta-Jones.
Entrapment is a tricky little movie that stars Jones as Gin, an unusually
agile insurance agent who has plans to track down and capture a notorious art
thief named Robert MacDougal. She plans to accomplish this by presenting
herself to him another thief and give him an opportunity to steal an ancient
Chinese mask worth a reported $40 million dollars. Evidently he trusts her --
but not before stealing a few microchips worth millions and threaten to frame
her if she betrays him.
Ving Rhames, one of my favorite actors, has a minor, although deceptive role
in the movie, but it is not minor enough to dissappoint; it is so
underwritten that Rhames is not given the opportunity to inject his trademark
charisma into the script. The rest of the cast fares far better: as a matter
of fact, Connery and Jones shine. Despite their fairly obvious age
difference, the two seem to be made for each other and the script made just
for them. It is always a virtue for an otherwise inconsistent film for its
stars to invariably grab our attention.
Although Entrapment is always fun, sometimes outrageously exciting, sometimes
wickedly tricky and sometimes intriguing in human aspects of the story, much
of the plot and continuity will not stand to close scrutiny. To wit,
essential plausibility is often sacrificed for the sake of showing us
something cool. Sometimes it is but sometimes it just makes so little sense
that it undermines the flow of the movie.
On the bright side, although the movie does feature its share of nifty
high-tech gadgets, director Jon Amiel (Copycat, The Man Who Knew Too Little)
for the most part avoids utilizing those gadgets to neatly rescue his
characters when they back themselves into a corner. So many James Bond-type
thrillers do that, and it's often times frustrating because it usually
demonstrates a lack of creativity on the part of the filmmakers.
Of course movies about thieves, deceptions and lies of all sorts have to have
some sort of surprise at the end, but Entrapment does this interestingly. The
movie drops all sorts of clues to the movie's big secret -- even some that are
blatantly obvious, but you don't realize how obvious they were until after the
secret is revealed. It's refreshing to see a film that plays fair with it's
audience; there is nothing that it throws at you that the perceptive viewer
couldn't have suspected.
There's a difference between this and predictability. If the film were to be
predictable, Amiel and his screenwriters would've had to have done their best
to conceal their trick from you but blunder so that you were able to guess
it. But here, they purposely and seemingly subtly give you a chance to figure
out what's going on before coming right out and saying it at the end. When
this method succeeds it's not predictability.
Entrapment is an engrossing, fun, effective thriller that triumphs despite its
continuity errors. It works because of its stars, because of its smarts and
because of its deftess in bringing a script to throbbing, pulsating life.

There must be a stipulation in Catherine Zeta-Jones' contract which
says that her face must be lit so that her eyes twinkle in every shot
in which she appears.  In Entrapment, the flashy follow-up to her
breakthrough role in The Mask of Zorro, there is nary a scene in which
she doesn't look like a team of makeup people just powdered her nose.
Zeta-Jones is Gin Baker, an eager insurance investigator who sets out
on an impossible mission of sorts to catch master art thief Robert
MacDougal (Sean Connery, in a variation of his escaped con role in The
Rock) in the act.  After tracking him down in London, Baker offers the
aging entrepreneur a sweet deal: he'll aid her in the theft of a
jeweled gold mask at an art exhibit and get a share of the profits
from its sale.  Of course, the sexual tension in their strange
partnership starts building immediately, giving rise to plenty of
boring romantic scenes during which the audience can go to the
concession stand and get refills on their popcorn.
Is Baker setting MacDougal up for a fall, or is she just as cunning
thief as he is?  An even more pressing question: Will director stop
teasing us with his cheesily non-revealing shots Zeta-Jones in the
altogether?  Will we see the liver-spotted skin (ugh) of Mr. Connery
mixing it up with own Ms. Zeta-Jones' own Ivory-soap bod?  Do we dare
keep our eyes open to find out?
Admittedly, when hokey romance isn't getting in the way, the film is
fun to watch.  With its expertly executed heists and sometimes
heart-poundingly tense quandaries, Entrapment actually manages to
reach an adequate level of excitement.  In one memorable scene, Gin
performs a ballet-like navigation of a room criss-crossed by invisible
lasers, moving with the same caution Tom Cruise evoked when he did his
Peter Pan impression in Mission: Impossible (It's probably no
coincidence that M:I's Ving Rhames appears in a supporting role as a
comrade of MacDougal).  But even with all the film's meticulous
dissections of the art of thievery, certain ponderous aspects of their
skill seem to be taken for granted. For example, do all master thieves
have the ability to zip in and out of the tightest places without
being seen, the limits of their own agility and the laws of physics
notwithstanding?  How do the hell do they do this?
Interestingly, the objects of the thieves' passion -- the artworks
themselves -- are given very little scrutiny.  The script never allows
the characters to explain what their fascination is with the pieces
they steal.  Instead, a little more than halfway through the film,
MacDougal and Baker become greedy bank robbers who'd rather go for the
big score than collect priceless masterpieces.
When all's said and done, and the credits roll over the film's
aw-shucks ending, you're left with the echoes of a few cheap thrills,
and also with the idea that there wasn't really that much to be
excited about.  The thieves' nifty gadgets (not to mention their
acrobatic stunt doubles) are the real stars here.  And they hold their
own quite well, considering that Zeta-Jones' face tries its very best
to hog screen time.

THE MASK OF ZORRO's Catherine Zeta-Jones firmly establishes her star
power in ENTRAPMENT.  With a dazzling performance, she dominates the
picture with absolute assurance and a bewitching smile.
An actress who breaks the popular mold, she's not a teenager, not
anorexic and not a martial arts master.  An incredibly beautiful
actress, Zeta-Jones has much more than looks going for her.  So
intelligent and likable, she's an action star somewhat like Diana Rigg
in her prime.  Zeta-Jones has delicate, ballet-like movements, but her
strength, which shines through her every frame in ENTRAPMENT, is her
charismatic confidence.  Never has a smile possessed more power.
Cast opposite Zeta-Jones is someone of equal intelligence, grace, and
looks, Sean Connery.  Although showing his age a bit, he is still a
force to be reckoned with.  Like a chess game between grand masters,
Zeta-Jones and Connery match wits and savoir-faire.  With great
chemistry together, they engage in an acting battle that is as
mesmerizing as the story itself.  In the end, the old pro is outclassed
by the younger rival, she's 30, but both do themselves proud, delivering
wonderful performances.
As we meet Virginia "Gin" Baker (Zeta-Jones), a crackerjack insurance
investigator, she is hot on the trail of Robert "Mac" MacDougal
(Connery), whom she suspects has just pulled off a daring skyscraper
robbery of an expensive painting.  She's been following him for 5 years
now.  Her boss (Will Patton) maligns Mac's skills, saying, he's
"60-years-old -- he ain't no spring chicken."  Still, Gin is convinced
that Mac did it and gets herself sent to London to set up a trap.
As directed by Jon Amiel (COPYCAT) and written by Ronald Bass (RAINMAN
and BLACK WIDOW) and Michael Hertzberg, the movie concentrates as much
energy on the relationships as the action.  The action is imaginative
and exciting, but it can't compare with the human drama.  Zeta-Jones
steals every scene no matter how suave Connery acts, and he delivers an
excellent performance that is his best in years.  The story contains
several surprising twists, some of which you'll probably guess and
others which you won't.  Your enjoyment of the picture doesn't depend on
your being fooled.  The movie will be just about as entertaining even if
you figure out every turn in advance.
Some movies get tripped up by their implausibility, while others thrive,
even if one must suspend disbelief.  ENTRAPMENT is in the latter
category.  In fact, implausibility can sometimes prove an advantage.
While on the job, Gin sleeps in the nude with make-up that lasts the
night.  Although all we get to see is her backside, she certainly has an
exceptional one.
Gin tries to convince Mac that she is a thief and has a big job that
requires his help.  Mac sizes her up right away.  "Has there ever been
anyone you couldn't manipulate, beguile or seduce?" he asks with a
twinkle in his eye.  Without need for thought, she replies with a simple
"no," giving him one of her million dollar smiles in the process.
As Mac's smart-mouthed assistant, Ving Rhames provides much of the
story's humor.  It's a small part, but Rhames manages to make it seem
larger.  The film's only disappointment is Maury Chaykin, who plays a
Jabba the Hutt clone that should have been eliminated as a bad
distraction from what is otherwise a completely satisfying narrative.
If Zeta-Jones continues improving at her current rapid rate of
acceleration, by her next movie, Jan De Bont's THE HAUNTING with Liam
Neeson, she should be astounding.
ENTRAPMENT runs 1:54.  It is rated PG-13 for a little violence,
sexuality and profanity and would be fine for kids around 9 and up.  I
would have taken my 10-year-old if I had known how mild it was.

_Entrapment_ (PG-13) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
About a third into _Entrapment_, we have learned the following about
Catherine Zeta-Jones: her character is an insurance investigator trying
to nail a world famous thief by posing as a thief herself; she is very
athletic and remarkably limber (watch her slither her way around a grid
of security lasers); she struggles with an American accent (her natural
Welsh lilt always creeps through); and she looks smashing in a skin-tight
cat suit.  In short, we have learned just about everything--except for
one teensy detail: her character's name.
This is a problem, but one that it easily forgiven; after all, maybe
director Jon Amiel was as distracted by Zeta-Jones's magnetism--and, for
that matter, that of leading man Sean Connery--as the audience is.  Their
combined charisma keeps _Entrapment_ watchable.  What it doesn't,
however, is make this action adventure terribly exciting.  That's Amiel's
job, and he does not appear to know quite how to approach it.
Amiel does stage a particularly tense heist scene where undercover
investigator Virginia Baker (yes, that is Zeta-Jones's character name)
and her quarry, master thief Robert MacDougal (Connery) team up to steal
a precious mask.  But that's about the only thrill scene that Amiel
doesn't fumble in some way.  An early car chase is too abbreviated to
make any sort of impression, and a high-wire climax is too contrived and
conventionally staged to be very suspenseful.  Amiel handles the quieter
moments better, but there he is largely helped by the the rapport between
his megawatt stars.  Even that, however, isn't always enough; the two
can't hide the fact that the manipulative, overly drawn-out resolution
could have used a lot more tightening in the editing room.
The many twists in the script by Ron Bass and William Broyles Jr. do not
always make complete sense, but it delivers enough surprises to keep the
audience on their toes and interested.  But without some real zest and
style on the directorial end--which ousted helmer Antoine Fuqua
(_The_Replacement_Killers_) could have brought to the
project--_Entrapment_ is more of a diversion than a true thriller.

        I have no real tangible proof of this, but I swear that there
are a lot of producers in Hollywood who adamantly believe that if you
take a bad script, written by a bad writer and give the project it to
an equally bad director, then it is actually possible to make a good
movie. Using their logic, all that really needs be done to change the
bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of super-famous actors and
provide an almost unlimited production budget.
        This is the only way I can fathom how 20th Century Fox hired
Jon Amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my
time (not counting the time it took me to get to and from the
theatre). Now, before I continue to ferociously attack what's wrong
with this film, I just want to point out that one of the reasons it
fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an
exciting thriller. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Virginia Baker, an
insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named
Robert MacDougal (Sean Connery). If you've ever seen any Hollywood
blockbuster before, I really don't have to spend too much time on
frivolous plot details: the two team up for various jobs, stealing
various things for various purposes. 
        The problem we come to is that we've all seen this a few
billion times before and this film doesn't break any new ground in the
big-budget/Hollywood/action genre. The result is that the entire
production feels contrived. I'm going to be completely honest here:
pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the run-time
was looking at Catherine Zeta-Jones. Now while this may be a
compliment for Ms. Zeta-Jones, it certainly isn't for either the
writers or the director, who are not nearly as clever as they think
they are. Just about the most profound thought they can inject into
this film is when they have MacDougal lecture Baker on the semantic
difference between "entrapment" and "blackmail". 
        With an eighty million dollar budget, you'd think that
Entrapment would at least feature edge-of-your seat action scenes or
breathtaking special F/X. Well, you'd be wrong. The action that is
present in this film takes place in a huge skyscraper and is
relatively unspectacular. Unfortunately for all those involved with
Entrapment, Die Hard narrowly beat it to the screen by 11 years. The
reality is that after 15 minutes of watching this picture, you know
exactly what's going to happen, despite rather pathetic attempts in
the screenplay to throw in plot twists.
        Many scenes seem to exist merely as a reason to outfit
Zeta-Jones in extremely tight-fitting clothing. One particular scene
features Baker crawling around trying to avoid laser-beams while she
tries to steal an ancient Chinese mask. Nothing wrong with that, but
she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask
was - so why didn't she and MacDougal tunnel in directly under the
mask instead of the other side of the room? I'll tell you why: because
it's a great excuse to photograph Zeta-Jones' posterior as it slides
underneath those beams (and it also allows a second scene of the exact
same thing - the rehearsal).
        Ving Rhames also makes an appearance in this movie, and though
he has great screen presence (although so do Connery and Zeta-Jones)
and the most interesting character in the film, not even he can rescue
this film from the depths of the Boring Film Abyss (a concept I
invented just to describe this picture). 
        One last complaint: Entrapment is littered of instances where
MacDougal will just slip into a shadow or behind a building, or he
becomes obstructed by a moving vehicle and then in the next shot,
he'll spontaneously disappear in ninja-like fashion. I can picture
Amiel patting himself on the back, thinking to himself "It'll leave
the audience wondering for days: How did he do that?" We know Jon,
it's called editing.

Sean Connery, in his 68th role, plays Robert MacDougal, a well-known art
thief who matches
wits and falls for Gin Baker, an insurance agent played by Catherine
Zeta-Jones, fresh off her first
starring role in "The Mask of Zorro." The film is Jon Amiel's "Entrapment."
The comment is,
"Come on, Mr. Connery. I never thought I'd say this, but you're out of
you're league."
I'm a little tired, so I'll sum up "Entrapment's" plot rather vaguely. After
a Rembrandt is stolen from
a corporate building, Gin Baker(Zeta-Jones), an insurance agent, decides to
try to catch the
thief(Connery). Slowly, she starts to like the thief, and she ends up
playing both sides; helping him
steal, and helping to catch him.
Catherine Zeta-Jones is once again good in the heroine role she perfected in
"Zorro", but I'd like
to see her try something else(a romantic-comedy, perhaps?). Sean Connery is
also suave as ever.
But the film's plot doesn't always make sense and the movie is too glib for
its own good. Director
Jon Amiel wants "Entrapment" to a Bond-style crime caper, but the most it
provides is harmless
fun.

If the real world were like some recent Hollywood films, most of the couples
strolling down the street would be 60 year old men with women in their 20s.
The older women and younger guys would be left sitting around playing euchre.
This does happen occasionally although not at the frequency that Sean Connery
and Clint Eastwood would have us believe. What is the appeal? Freud suggests
that women look for their fathers and older men make good big daddies.
The more likely explanation, according to some theories, is the biological
hardwiring left over from prehistoric days. Subconsciously, men seek
childbearing potential and women look for protection from the dangerous
beasties for their offspring. In our society older men are the more powerful.
As Henry Kissinger supposedly observed, "Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac."
(Of course Kissinger's comment was self-serving, he being an extremely
powerful man at the time. It would be like me proposing the idea that writing
movie reviews is the ultimate aphrodisiac - and I can assure you that has
_never_ worked.)
In the alternate dimension of cinema, the explaination is a bit simpler. A
young romantic interest asserts the virility of the leading man and gives the
males in the audience something to look at. As the adventure heroes age, they
still have a box office draw, but need some propping up.
The film industry is slower in recognizing the appeal of mature women. There
are a few roles available (Sigourney Weaver is over 50), but they are rare.
I could go on about this topic and am tempted to. It's much more interesting
than the film this column is supposed to be about.
Connery is Robert "Mac" MacDougal, a famed art thief so successful that now he
pulls jobs just for the thrill of it. When insurance investigator Virginia
Baker (Catherine Zeta-Jones) convinces her boss that Mac is behind a recent
theft, she's on his trail.
She teams up with Mac to catch him in the act. Or is she actually a thief
herself and needs his help? Or is something else entirely going on?
The opening sequence involves a high-tech heist with the thief hanging upside
down outside a skyscraper and breaking in to a heavily protected room. A half
hour later one of the characters drops a supposed bombshell about that scene
that anyone with eyes and half a brain has already figured out. 
Connery is a charismatic as ever. As he ages, he is no longer the agile James
Bond, but his acting skills have only increased. This is certainly not his
greatest role, but it's virtually impossible for him to be uninteresting.
Zeta-Jones captured the imagination of the movie-going public in last year's
"Zorro". She appears to have some talent, but here she's mostly eye candy for
the males in the audience. A scene where she's clad in a skin-tight outfit and
moving snake-like through a series of security lasers appears designed
primarily to show us what an impressive posterior she possesses.
Surprisingly, most of the time there's not a great deal of chemistry between
the two. They connect for a few moments, but usually it's as though they are
in different rooms. This part of the formula doesn't work.
There is an abundance of wasted potential. Ving Rhames, as Mac's partner, is
on screen for only seconds. Will Patton is Virginia's boss but his character
is boring and serves no function. Maury Chaykin is something like you might
expect if Marlon Brando played Jabba The Hutt, but is oddly understated for
such an over-the-top role.
Understated may be the theme for the movie. Much of the action feels lame. The
sexual tension doesn't click. The plot maneuverings are too often transparent.
The film features a few entertaining bits. The climax atop the world's tallest
buildings in Kuala Lumpur features its share of excitement. A New Year's Eve
theft depends upon a bank's last minute Y2K testing making this the first film
to incorporate a millennium bug plot device.
The primary appeal is the two stars. Connery's screen presence is like an old
friend. Zeta-Jones' butt is nice, but I'm not sure its worth the price of a ticket.

years but refuses to believe he falls into the "older man" category yet.

Roger Ebert describes Entrapment as a "star vehicle," and he enjoyed it
on those terms.  I'm not letting it off that easily.  Here is a film
that not only ignores logic, characterization, and coherence, but spits
in the face of every known rule of physics.  It's also such a
superficial movie that the most notable element of the last scene is
that the characters' costumes are perfectly matched with the sets. 
Style over substance?  Definitely.  Should we care?  I sure did.  It's
not a loathsome film; on the contrary, it stars two people who are easy
on the eyes and light up the screen.  In fact, there are only two
reasons to see Entrapment:  1) the presence of Sean Connery and
Catherine Zeta-Jones, and 2) director Jon Amiel, who does what he can
with a script overdosed on cliches.
Even these three talents can't make sense of this inane screenplay,
which is credited to Ronald Bass and William Broyles; it's one of those
scripts that's far more interested in shocking us with ludicrous plot
twists than it is in actually telling a story about thieves.  The
framework for the film is pretty simple:  Gin Baker (Zeta-Jones) works
for an insurance company; she's assigned by her boss (Will Patton) to
make a deal with and ultimately betray Robert MacDugal (Connery), a
rich, big-time thief.  The usual assortment of plot devices can be
expected, including several double-crosses, a sordid love affair, a
sidekick subplot (starring Ving Rhames), and a lot of characters staring
pensively at the action-packed sight of a surveillance camera.
Entrapment fires cliches at its audience with mechanical rapidity; it's
likely that anyone keeping track will lose count well before the film is
over.  For instance, if Mac is such a sly, brilliant thief, why is it
that Gin is able to instantly pull up a file containing every crime he's
committed since his foray into the world of robbery?  Well, that's
probably because the screenplay wouldn't work very well if Gin doesn't
know what Mac looks like.  Another cliche is the Vanishing Character
Act.  The last scene (the one I mentioned above) has about four
Vanishing Character Acts, where characters vanish into thin air and then
appear seconds later in places they could not possibly have gotten in
such a short amount of time.  My personal favorite is the obligatory sex
with Sean Connery cliche.  Entrapment doesn't actually feature a heated
sex scene, but it's implied.  
Jon Amiel (Copycat) is a skilled director, and the heist scene in which
Gin and Mac steal the Chinese mask is sharply crafted, especially after
seeing the way they train for it.  Connery and Zeta-Jones don't do much
acting, but they have presence, so much that I was almost interested in
the love affair angle.  The supporting cast is nice, though Patton and
Rhames are both shamelessly wasted.  Entrapment is a pretty lousy movie
when all is considered, but it has its pluses.  It just would have been
nice if someone -- anyone -- had at least made an effort to tone down
the cliches and make sense of the story.  Stars can carry a movie only
so far before a little bit of coherence in the plot is necessary.

ENTRAPMENT **˝ (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers ( entrapment@filmfreakcentral.net )
(Visit Film Freak Central for your cinematic fixin's:

Clothing optional.)
starring Sean Connery, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Ving Rhames, Will Patton
screenplay by Ron Bass and William Broyles, Jr.
directed by Jon Amiel
Sean Connery is permitted use of his native accent in Entrapment (or,
as Connery pronounces it, Entchraphmint) while theWelsh Zeta-Jones is
not. Her character's exotic beauty and worldly ways are at odds with
her bland, midwest dialect. It doesn't help that Zeta-Jones is no
Meryl Streep when it comes to vocal gymnastics. But then, most (men,
at least) aren't likely to notice that Zeta-Jones' lips are even
moving as they watch Entrapment; slinking between security devices
like a hungry feline (she's a cat-burglar, har har), Zeta-Jones is
adept at real gymnastics. Her impeccable physique takes centre stage
in a film that elevates thievery into performance art.
Connery plays Mac, an infamous robber baron who takes Zeta-Jones, as
rookie thief Virginia Baker ("Gin"), under his wing. She wants to
steal a priceless Chinese mask; as Connery proves quickly, she's
flexible but not as cunning as he is. I should mention at this point
that Gin is a double agent, if you will: she's working for the
treasury to bring Mac down. Her tutelage is a ruse.
Or is it? Twenty minutes into Entrapment, I determined just what kind
of movie it is: the type that throws red herring after red herring at
the audience, peeling away story layers like pieces of a Chinese box.
Yet the experience of watching Entrapment is not nearly as frustrating
as sitting through the similarly plotted Wild Things, a film that 
unwrapped its bandages only to reveal the invisible man. (Entrapment,
unlike Wild Things, is not out to deconstruct a genre; for all its
twists and turns, it is a conventional, mainstream picture.) One
element of Entrapment does remain pleasantly constant throughout, and
that is the bizarre tango between Connery and Zeta-Jones. Whatever 
their motivations, it's clear that they're smitten with one another
from their first scene together. (Aside: note the phallic imagery the
first time Mac meets Gin-she is naked in this scene, and his gun
provides an amusing and subtle gag.) While their romance doesn't quite
conjure memories of such old-fashioned pairings as Cary Grant and 
Grace Kelly, the two actors achieve a level of intimacy that Eastwood
could not with any of his young, female co-stars from the recent True
Crime. (I mention Eastwood-who is close in age and stature to
Connery-only to emphasize the May-December nineties trend; sometimes
it works, sometimes it doesn't, though the time is nigh for both men
to admit their age on screen, as Beatty did in Bulworth.) Entrapment
also features a freakish performance from Canadian actor Maury
Chaykin, who invests his bit part (as a Confuscious-quoting guru to 
burglars) with a ferocious energy that recalls early Nicolas Cage.
Jon Amiel has had a spotty career (his Copycat is a series of missed
or botched opportunities). Entrapment is directed efficiently but only
the set pieces show real visual flair. I felt the break-and-enter
sequences in DePalma's Mission: Impossible were the best things about
it; Entrapment's are similarly thrilling. For the Chinese Mask number
(which left me breathless), the filmmakers may have created a new
sport: laser ballet. I also enjoyed the extensive training before the
second heist: movies of this ilk rarely acknowledge the rehearsals
that take place before the main events.

Fox's first summer blockbuster before 'that' film is a entertaining enough
thriller which more twists than a very twisty thing. Sean Connery plays
master thief Robert MacDougal, who's still hanging off buildings and
prancing around at the age of sixty. Jones plays FBI agent Gin Baxter, who
thinks she'll be able to catch Connery if she goes undercover with him,
pretending to be a 'thief' herself. The plot is not as simple as it sounds,
however, and the film pulls off a number of twists that keep the tension
running.
Entrapment amounts nothing more than a pleasant diversion. There's nothing
heavy in this movie, it's as linear as hell and doesn't really suffer from
that. Sean Connery is charismatic enough as the thief, although it's a
little implausible that this granddad can survive some of the situations
he's thrown into. Zeta-Jones, who's starting to get a movie career going
thanks to The Mask of Zorro, looks pretty on-screen, although her acting is
a little flat. Unfortunately, her character must have been described in the
script as 'show off her butt,' because the character doesn't amount to
anything else. But that's what the popcorn popping public expect, the studio
obviously thinks. It won't hurt the box office, anyway. Comic relief comes
from the ever excellent Ving Rhames as Connery's sidekick, although he is
woefully underused. He gives the film a comic lift that is missing from the
rest of this somewhat droll affair.
Jon Amiel, whose previous film include the ho-hum Sommersby, is again rather
ho-hum here. There's only one true scene that has a lot of tension, where
Zeta-Jones is skilfully twisting and turning to avoid lasers. Other than
that, the direction is somewhat flat, and the first 30 minutes are almost
hideously slow, and not promising at all. The last 30 minutes are hideously
loud, and while full of bam bam action, are missing a spark that makes the a
ction exciting. It's all rather dead. Still, some nail biting stunts are
included, but it won't keep you on the edge of your seat during the entire
movie, which is what a action suspensener should do.
Finally, a large amount of suspension of disbelief is needed to make this
film work. It's seem impossible that Zeta-Jones would fall for Connery, not
due to the age difference, but due to the fact that the script gives them
little reason to. It's also hard to believe that Connery's character could
still be running and jumping around at his age, especially during the high
octane department. I wouldn't be surprised if Connerys stuntman earned more
than Connery himself. The twists are executed well, however, and not to
predictable.
Entrapment, although fun, has a air of disappointment about it. The film
really could have tried a little harder, and there's only small patches of
excitement rather than a continuing stream. It's no waste of celluloid, and
Connery and Jones are both watchable, but Entrapment hasn't set the
benchmark for summer movies.

"Entrapment" boasts a top notch cast, an effective score, wonderful 
photography and a great deal of style. The caper film also has a plotline 
that stretches plausibility further and further until the final act, 
where it snaps entirely, leaving any link to reality fluttering in the 
breeze. Whether you exit the theater annoyed or amused will likely depend 
on your appreciation of Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Me, I like 
the charismatic duo enough to forgive the film's major failings in the 
logic department.
Reminiscent of the glossy romantic thrillers from the '60s, "Entrapment" 
centers around a heist of monumental proportion, one that can only be 
carried out on December 31, 1999. The story begins in New York, when a 
thief with no apparent fear of heights steals a Rembrandt by using high 
tech equipment to enter an upper floor of a high-rise from the outside. 
After insurance investigator Gin Baker (Zeta-Jones) convinces her boss, 
Hector Cruz (Will Patton) that legendary bandit Robert "Mac" MacDougal 
(Connery) is the man behind the crime, she sets off for London to find 
him.
Mac quickly turns the tables on the young woman, and the pair move to his 
castle in Scotland to sort matters out. Soon enough, they begin plotting 
the theft of an extremely rare Chinese mask from an English museum, but 
Gin has an even bigger job in mind. If Mac agrees, they will make a New 
Years Eve trip to Kuala Lumpur in the Far East, where they can take 
advantage of Y2K computer changeovers to funnel $8 billion from a bank 
headquarters in the Petronas Twin Towers, the tallest buildings in the 
world. What finer way to celebrate the Millennium than by pulling off the 
biggest robbery in history?
But is it a set-up and, if so, who is setting up whom? Questions of 
allegiance are pivotal to the convoluted plot of "Entrapment," along with 
outlandish schemes, outrageous coincidences and loads of technobabble. By 
the time the film reaches its fractured conclusion, primary characters 
pull off stunts that could only be accomplished by wizardry. The story is 
utterly preposterous, but this is an old-fashioned "star vehicle" where 
plots are incidental. What matters in a film like this is attitude and 
sex appeal, which "Entrapment" has in spades. Exotic locations, potent 
music and jazzy cinematography combine to make an engaging package, 
although, of course, the main attraction is the pairing of two movie 
stars; one a veteran aging like fine wine and the other a delicious 
offering of a more recent vintage.  
Catherine Zeta-Jones made a big impact in last year's "The Mask of Zorro" 
and she continues to dazzle here. Her eyes, focused and assured, burn 
with a fierce intelligence that makes her other physical assets all the 
more captivating. She is a strikingly beautiful woman who seems quite 
comfortable strutting her stuff. The camera caresses her form, 
particularly in a training sequence where she glides her magnificent 
fanny ever so smoothly under a faux laser beam. The shot doesn't feel the 
least bit sexist because Zeta-Jones is totally in command of the 
situation. Instead of being turned into an object, she comes off as 
choreographer of her own erotic ballet.
And then there's Sean Connery, one of the coolest men who ever lived. At 
nearly 70, the years of been kind to this cinematic treasure. Each new 
wrinkle adds more character to that great face, while his demeanor 
remains as assured as ever, with an added gruff edge underscoring the 
sense of danger so crucial to his appeal. Working with this alluring 
woman 40 years his junior, Connery's character strives to maintain a 
professional distance, while both romantic and paternal feelings do 
battle with his judgment. The script hands him cheesy lines like "Never 
trust a naked woman," but Connery handles them with aplomb. 
Meanwhile, several other very good actors are given virtually nothing to 
do. Ving Rhames, one of the best talents in the business, makes do with a 
throwaway role that squanders his skills, Will Patton pops up to sputter 
occasionally, and Maury Chaykin spends his screen time plopped in the 
Buddha position, spewing threats in a fey voice while displaying his big 
belly and sagging breasts. Why? I have no idea.  
After three increasingly silly, but well-staged, action set pieces, the 
film builds to a climax at a train station where lead characters 
magically appear and disappear while law enforcement agents behave like 
Barney Fife after too many cups of hard cider. Somehow, the rampant 
stupidity in "Entrapment" actually enhances the film's goofball appeal. 
Add the charms of Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones and you've got 
112 snappy minutes of big, dumb Hollywood fun.

MOVIE VIEWS by Jamey Hughton:   http://welcome.to/movieviews
Anyone who says Sean Connery is getting too old for action movies hasn't
seen his latest movie. Connery will always be remembered as the
definitive James Bond, and in Entrapment, part of the fun is watching
him replay certain shades that made his portrayal of the famous spy so
popular. His age is starting to show, but you have to hand it to Mr.
Connery, because he sure is a good sport.
In Entrapment he plays Mac, a master thief with high-tech gadgets for
scaling buildings and stealing antique Rembrandts for his personal
collection. He catches the eye of an insurance agent (!!) named Gin
Baker, Catherine Zeta-Jones. With the news that a priceless chinese mask
is being displayed in a London museum, Zeta-Jones knows that Mac won't
be able to resist the chance to snatch it. So she tracks him down and
poses as a thief, proposing that the two become partners in crime and
attempt the daring heist. Of course, her boss (Will Patton) wants her to
bring Mac in afterward. But carefully predicting the pattern of their
meetings, you can surely guess that their relationship will escalate to
something more than business.
Zeta-Jones is 29, and Connery is now 68. With this enormous age
differential, can the stars still create believable chemistry? The
answer is a surprising yes. Director Jon Amiel plays their relationship
on a different level than just a love story, in fact, he stages their
confrontations like they were father and daughter. If this is simply a
massive error, then it was a turn for the better, because this way the
stars are given more breathing room and their chemistry is still
believable. In one scene toward the end, when the two burglars separate,
you realize that you actually care about their situation. Even if he
could play her grandpa.
One disappointement is the use of the supporting cast. Ving Rhames is
once again electric and involving, as one of Mac's former partners, but
he is criminally underused with his undemanding role. Maury Chaykin hams
it up as a Budha-like art dealer. Will Patton has little to do playing
Zeta-Jones' boss. Amiel also uses a fade-out approach to end many of his
scenes, which gets very repetitive very quickly.
But, Entrapment is still an exciting heist adventure that glides along
smoothly after a bumpy first hour. The final robbery that the duo pull,
an 8-billion bank caper on the eve of the millenium, is simply terrific.
I never even glanced at my watch through the two-hour running time.
Catherine Zeta-Jones gives a flawed but luminous performance, and
Connery is just a lot of fun to watch. Reports indicate he may return
once more as James Bond. No matter how old he is then, I'll probably
still buy it.

   One way that critics' opinions of movies often differ from
those of fans is that regular folks are often content with
excitement and romance while reviewers are obsessed with
originality and believability.  "Entrapment" has been getting
mixed notices, with many critics complaining that little is
credible, while vast crowds of moviegoers credit the film for
its style.  Surprisingly, Roger Ebert goes along with the latter
group, saying in his review that though "Entrapment" has a
"preposterous plot [there is] so much chemistry between
attractive actors that we don't care....I didn't believe a second
of it, and I didn't care that I didn't."  The Great Man is on the
money this time: "Entrapment," which recalls stylish vehicles
like "Topkapi" and "To Catch a Thief," is neither original nor
plausible, but then, is anything done by the successful James
Bond series feasible?  Logical action is not the point with
such a genre.  Technique is everything, and this movie is
adept in various spheres.  Note Phil Meheux's startling
photography (especially the night scenes and the vista that
contrasts a dirt-poor Malaysian neighborhood with the high-
rise palaces of Kuala Lumpur's business sector).  Let the
special chemistry between its two principal performers
register: director John Amiel will have you wondering whether
the 69-year-old Sean Connery's attention to the 29-year-old
Catherine Zeta-Jones is sexual or paternal.
   Sean Connery (who could still play Bond, for my money)
takes on the role of Mac, a wealthy thief who now steals not
for the money but for the excitement.  With a particular
expertise in making off with the works of the masters in art
museums, he turns his skills to stealing a Chinese mask. 
When Gin (Catherine Zeta-Jones), an insurance investigator,
seeks to entrap him by tempting him to take on a daring
assignment, Mac at first does not trust her but agrees to
make her a partner in the theft of a $40 million Chinese mask
on exhibit in Scotland.  With his partner Thibadeaux (Ving
Rhames), he is later to move on to the attempt the biggest
haul in history: the lifting of eight billion dollars in corporate
deposits, while Gin's boss, Hector Cruz (Will Patton) ventures
to capture him.
   If you're wondering why Ms. Zeta-Jones is depicted in an
acrobatic pose in the posters, the posture is not simply an
attention getter to entrap prospective viewers.  While entering
a museum, cat-like to avoid invisible laser beams seen only
by Mac with a special instrument, Gin must bend and twist
her curvaceous body lest a misstep of an inch set off alarms
and foil the theft.  
   "Entrapment" engulfs the viewer in both its focus on the
two attractive actors and in its photography of a series of
capers including one in which Mac dangles from a 70-story
building while opening a security system.  While younger fans
(the movie is rated PG-13 because of its relative absence of
violence) will be absorbed in the impressive stunt work, those
of a romantic bent will be fascinated particularly by Catherine
Zeta-Jones, who is not simply a knockout in the looks
department but has smarts and spark to match.  
   Though "Entrapment" recycles some of the classics--its
many clever twists conforming to the usual Hollywood
playing-by-the-numbers--its exotic locales, clever repartee
between actors of different generations, and breathtaking
stunts give "Entrapment" a handsome look, a mischievous
bearing, and a good time for its patrons.

Sean Connery (Mac) plays the "James Bond" of the art theft world. Catherine
Zeta-Jones (Gin) is the sexy insurance investigator who travels to England
after him. But who will entrap who? The film does a good job of keeping us
guessing all the way to the end. It's a careful balancing act not unlike the
gymnastics Gin shows off as she twists her body through a scattered array of
laser light alarms.
As always, Connery is terribly charismatic and I can't deny that he is still
handsome in his elder years, but I absolutely don't buy the manipulatively
clever Gin falling for him in a sexual way. Fortunately, all the contact we
have to witness is a short kiss -- which could have been more effective if
only implied.
The film is at its best when entrenched in clever thieving, planning,
gadgetry and execution. This it does very well. The film is at its worst in
its words; the dialogue dipping into immaturity at more than a few points.
All in all, "Entrapment" is a cute/clever, rather TV-esq picture that could
have used just a little more heart.

        "Entrapment" is a sneaky little movie-- a child, if you will,
with one hand perpetually stuck in the cinematic cookie jar.  So taken
was I with the film's flash and style that it wasn't until driving
home after the screening that I realized just how disjointed the story
was.  Plot twists that appeared plausible (if unlikely) while watching
the film shed their coherence when subjected to mental instant-replay.
Is that enough to derail the movie?  I didn't think so, but I suppose
that's up to the individual viewer.
        To say much about the plot is to risk spoiling the surprise
ending(s), so I must tread carefully.  Suffice it to say that
professional burglar Robert "Mac" MacDougal (Sean Connery) and
insurance agent Virginia 'Gin' Baker (Zeta-Jones), who also dabbles in
theft, team up to pull two big jobs which could net them a paycheck in
excess of eight billion dollars.  Can they trust each other?
Certainly not, and this problem forms the cornerstone of the entire
second half of the film.  But damn, it's fun watching them try.
        The movie itself is skillfully directed by John Amiel, who
infuses the story with plenty of action and entertaining moments.  Nor
is the script without merit: in addition to some great Lawrence
Block-type burglar humor, "Entrapment" is one of the few films of
recent years that seems to have a pretty good grasp of how computers
work.  It's also the first story to do something intelligent and
interesting with the concept of the Year 2000 bug.  The movie's
failing, and it's not necessarily a fatal one, is a lack of coherence.
Clever pay-offs are sacrificed numerous times for cheap action-film
cliches.  Nothing new here.
        Also, a couple of glaring technical problems took me out of
the story.  For example, why do the security doors close so slowly
when Mac and Virginia are busted in a high-security setting?  The
whole point of these doors is to trap any burglars who make their way
into the restricted area.  Shouldn't those things SLAM shut instantly?
But no, our two thieves have ample time to continue putzing around
with the computer before casually making their escape through the not-
yet-shut doorway.  A minor problem, but irksome.  And why does
Connery's character happen to have a *parachute* of all things with
him during one puzzling scene?  (The biggest head-scratcher for me,
though, is still the duo's plan to "download" billions of dollars onto
a recordable CD-ROM.  Come again?)
        Sure, there are flaws, but when the performances are this
much fun, who cares?  Zeta-Jones in particular does great work
here, as I expected she would: she proved in "The Mask of Zorro"
that she's not just another pretty face, but a fine actress as well.
This film will only increase her notoriety, particularly among the
audience's hetereosexual males. Ving Rhames (from "Pulp Fiction")
also turns in a good performance in a role that's an interesting
variation on his usual hard-nosed gangster persona.
        "Entrapment" is by no means the year's best action-movie ("The
Matrix" still bears that distinction, at least until "The Phantom
Menace" opens in three weeks), but it's hardly the worst.  With a
great bittersweet ending that winks at "Casablanca," the film is
clever more often than not.  It's also a good deal of fun... and isn't
that why we go to the movies in the first place?
     ("Entrapment" captures your local theater on Friday, April 30th.)

Story by Ronald Bass and Michael Hertzberg.  
Screenplay by Ronald Bass and William Broyles Jr.  
Directed by Jon Amiel.  
Starring Sean Connery, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Ving Rhames.  
Rated PG-13 (contains violence, sensuality, and profanity)  112 mins.  
Synopsis:  An aging master art thief, his supplier, and a young, buxom
security consultant are all not who they first appear to be (or are they?)
in this convoluted mess involving a risky heist during the millennium.  
Comments:  This movie was boring.  Plain and simple.  
ENTRAPMENT should not have been boring.  It stars Sean Connery, who can
still carry an action film despite his age, Catherine Zeta-Jones, a likeable
enough film presence, and Ving Rhames, ultra-cool star of PULP FICTION and
MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE.  It takes full advantage of the Y2K computer bug fears
(a current "hot topic" in the news) in its storyline, which is set at the
end of 1999.  It has some genuinely well-staged action sequences.  So, what
went wrong?  Plenty, unfortunately.  
The major problem with ENTRAPMENT is its script.  It has a been-there,
done-that feel to it.  Nothing seems particularly inventive or original, so
the whole movie lacks suspense and drags (it runs nearly two hours).  The
screenwriters, for example, periodically use a countdown to the millennium
as a means of transition between scenes (i.e. "4 days to the Millennium").
This device was used much more effectively in the overlooked sci-fi film
STRANGE DAYS.  The characters are not who they appear to be at the
beginning, which is neat at first but the device wears thin once the
umpteenth "surprise" revelation is made.  ENTRAPMENT, in other words, relies
too heavily on the audience not knowing what each character's true motive
is, resulting in a convoluted story which leaves many scratching their heads
in confusion.  
The star power here is quite strong, but the viewer can't help but feel the
actors are wasted in this production.  Sean Connery is given such
mind-numbing lines as "Never trust a naked woman."  Ving Rhames' character
seems like an afterthought; he's not developed at all.  The camera zooms in
frequently and leeringly at Catherine Zeta-Jones's tight wardrobe.  This, in
and of itself, is not bad, but, after a while, it has a juvenile feel to it.
At least the SPECIES movies hold no bones about the fact that they're
exploiting the female body.  ENTRAPMENT does the same under the thin
disguise of plot development (Sean Connery supposedly falls in love with the
girl while watching her, in tights, arc and pivot around laser beams).  
The tagline for this movie reads "The trap is set."  It sure is, on those
who spent money to see this movie.  ENTRAPMENT really isn't that bad; it is
watchable.  I would suggest, however, one waits until this is on cable or
television to see it.
