He is Alan (Jared Harris), elementary school teacher by day, volunteer
hospital disc jockey by night.  She is Beatrice (Asia Argento), who, when
not sitting at a desk for a nondescript company, is the best jewel thief
in London.  Somehow, some way, these two fall in love.  Which leads to
the question--why?
_B._Monkey_, named for the heroine's criminal moniker, only
satisfactorily answers one half of that question.  It is easy to see why
Alan would be so taken with Beatrice when he first spots her in a
pub--she is an exotic Italian beauty, and the sexy spunk that Alan
discovers once he gets to know her just adds to her allure.  In a sense,
it is also fairly easy to understand why Beatrice would initially be
drawn to Alan.  Tired of the criminal life, Beatrice wants to go
straight, and the square Alan presents the ultimate act of rebellion
against rebellion.
Their romance shows Beatrice the joy of a normal life, but it does not
convince the audience quite so easily.  Chalk it up to Alan and Harris'
dry portrayal--he's nice and stable, all right, but did he have to be so
boring?  Beatrice's relationship with Alan may be more functional than
that with her former roommates and partners-in-crime, drug dealer Paul
(Rupert Everett) and his lover Bruno (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), but it's
also considerably less interesting.
So it's no surprise that _B._Monkey_ springs back to life whenever Paul
and Bruno reenter the picture, and when Beatrice's ties with them pulls
her back into the game.  Of course, she goes along with it with great
reluctance and hates every minute.  However, it would have been more
compelling if scripters Michael Thomas and Chloe King added a bit more
conflict--that is, when put back in the pressure cooker, Beatrice felt
some of the thrill that kept her in crime for so long.  One would think
she would, yet she doesn't, completely "cured" by Alan's love.
_B._Monkey_, director Michael Radford's follow-up to 1995's 
_Il_Postino_, had been sitting on Miramax's shelf for the better part of
two years, and that's more than likely due to the film's many differences
with that beloved Oscar-winner.  Aside from the obvious differences in
tone and style, it is also, quite simply, just not nearly as effective a
love story; it's a cold piece of machinery from a filmmaker whose last
film moviegoers recall with great warmth.
