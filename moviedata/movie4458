     Tonight I had the good fortune to see a preview of this new film.
I must admit I was a little turned off by the name, stolen from the
Beatle's song, which by the way does not even appear in the film.  But
from the start you come to realize that this film is not the cheesy-
looking film depicted in the horrible advertising campaign.
     The film is of high caliber.  The script and acting are all first
rate.  The cinematography is beautiful.  The entire film was shot in
Russia, which attributes to the look of the film.  (We also get a look at
the Moscow McDonald's!)  I am sure that Roman Polanski's acting forces
were also felt behind the camera.
      The plot revolves around a missing artwork (icon) that is recovered
by the church in the opening minutes.  Stolen just minutes later, the
film becomes a chase to find it.  There are plenty of plot twists and of
course, the occasional chase, but it is the story and characters that
hold the film together.
      As I mentioned before, the film does not feature the Beatle song
which shares the same name of the film.  In fact, there is no rock music
except in the end credits, which is okay with me.  The orchestrational
score for the film is a must hear.  It is a definite purchase for all
those soundtrack collectors out there.
     In the end, I recommend this film.  It is a good time and most
importantly it moves along nicely and uses its time wisely.  Do not
think of this as a simple film.  It is not.  But I consider it the first
film of 1992 that is worth seeing.
