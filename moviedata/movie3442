Bad. Bad. Bad. That one word seems to pretty much sums up Beyond The Valley
Of The Dolls. If that summary isn't enough for you, how about T&A, T&A, T&A?
Still haven't got the point? Other than director Russ Meyer's predilection
for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the
afore-mentioned anatomical areas, there is really only one other reason to
recommend even taking a look at this movie. That is the fact that it was
co-written by famed film critic Roger Ebert, who also was responsible for
the screenplay. After watching this movie you will never be able to sit
through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for
bad writing with a straight face. This movie stinks out loud. Quite frankly,
this movie deserves a 0 out of 10. But there are parts of it that are so bad
they are almost funny. So I'm giving it a 1 out of 10. And maybe that is too
generous.
Right from the opening credits, I knew that I had a class-A bomb on my
hands. Not only are the way the credits actually shot distracting, but the
first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a
guy in a nazi uniform. I had absolutely no idea why the hell that was
happening (it does get explained later) and as soon as the first scene is
over, we cut to a completely unrelated scene. To be honest, as I sat through
this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was, I actually forgot
about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in
the film. With the quality of the writing during the rest of the film, it
wouldn't have surprised me if the opening had never been explained.
So what is this movie about? you ask. Like it really matters. OK, here goes.
This all-girl band headed by Kelly MacNamara (Dolly Reed) and her friends go
to Hollywood to try to gain a foothold in the music industry. Once there,
they do manage to find success (Due as much to their hooters as anything
else Â– it sure wasn't for their brutally bad singing voices), and the movie
chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get
to them. Everything from big egos, to booze and drugs to free flowing sex
sends them on a downward spiral. There are a couple of other idiotic
subplots thrown in for good measure, but the fame is the one that pretty
much sums up this thing.
>From a creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here. Other than the
above-mentioned obsession with big knockers that Russ Meyer seemed to have.
The dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts. Mr.
Ebert has generously thrown in helpings of "hey man","dig" and my all time
favorite -- "this is my happening, and it freaks me out". Now I ask you,
with lines like that how can you go wrong? Ebert had tried to inject as many
big words as possible into the dialogue. Maybe he thought it would make the
movie seem smarter. I don't know, but all the big words in the world
wouldn't be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting.
But the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of
everything else in this movie. I've seen home movies directed better than
Meyer managed with this turkey. In fact, there is one scene -- the one in
which they are in a van driving to Hollywood to make their fortunes --
during which I really had to question if Meyer or his editors had just
suffered serious head injuries. Add to the directing and writing the music
in this movie. I almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was
broken, there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers.
Then we have the cast. First lets start David Gurian who played Harris, the
manager of the band. This has got to be the goofiest looking guy that has
ever set foot in front of a motion picture camera. Sadly, his acting doesn't
come close to making up for his looks. If you have been following along up
to this point, this shouldn't surprise you. Meyer's stable of well endowed
girls also have the benefit of being fairly attractive to go along with
their other assets. Dolly Reed plays Kelly, the leader of the band. And no
surprise here, she was cast for her cup size, not her talents. And yes, she
does loose the shirt a few times and display her impressive talents.  Sadly,
her ass is almost as large as her chest. Hey, it a sexist movie, so I'm
writing a sexist review.
Then we have former Playboy Playmate Cynthia Myers in a fairly small role as
Casey, one of the other band members. This goes along with the rest of the
idiotic thinking in the movie. Meyer casts a gorgeous Playmate with a rack
to kill for and who obviously has no acting talent at all, but her nude
scenes are the biggest disappointment of all. Sure Russ, now is the time to
get artsy and throw in some well placed shadows. On the up side, she does
have a fun lesbo scene. I sound like I'm writing a review in a porn
magazine. But hey, I'll admit it; the only reason that I actually managed to
sit through this damn movie was to catch a look at Cynthia Myers naked. And
since that was a huge disappointment, I pretty much wasted two hours of my
life on this turkey.
The only thing that I can say about this movie is that you should stay away
from it. Unless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing
that even a Pulitzer Prize winning film critic like Roger Ebert has screwed
up at least once in his life too. And if you are thinking of checking it out
for the double D's -- you are better off just downloading nude Cynthia Myers
pictures off the Internet. This is a movie that should be avoided at all
costs. An even better idea might be to require video stores to place a
warning on the box of Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls -- Beware: This movie
is extremely hazardous to your common sense. Proceed with extreme caution.

     I rented BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS over the weekend. It was
*great*. A real trip!
     Due to the many things I have heard about this Russ Meyers film, I
thought I'd post my own comments, because it was nothing like what I
had been led to assume.
     Often I had heard that BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS was a steamy
soft core porn flick--but it is not.  What it is is a parody of
gigantic and sumptuous proportions. Let me put it this way, if you've
ever passed an inappropriate giggle while watching things like FALCON
CREST or DYNASTY or (especially :-) any of the afternoon soap operas on
tv, then you'll bust a gut laughing at BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS.
It's *too* exquisite!
     This film is also "known" by virtue of the fact that tv movie
critic Gene Siskel gave a thumbs down to the screenplay--which was
written, interestingly, by sidekick Roger Ebert. I think Gene must have
been a little less than objective in this summation, for the screenplay
is an ingenious work of art!  Unlike many other parady movies, which
are usually stitched together by binding bits of non-parody for the
sake of keeping some semblance to a plot, BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE
DOLLS is ALL parody. There is nothing in it that's normal. If you like
movies like DR.  STRANGELOVE, etc, then BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS
is definitely for you.
     A send-up of the Sixties Hollywood culture scene, BEYOND THE
VALLEY OF THE DOLLS starts out light and loud, introducing the main
characters and setting the mood via a LAUGH-IN-type party, where
various people and comments are variously zoomed in upon. But after the
doctor appears (you'll love this scene :-), the parody becomes intense,
quiet and focussed on the dilemmas of the individual sub-plots.
     BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS is an incredibly splendid and
artful parody on the order of Poe's FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER, a short
horror story so skillfully executed that many people who should know
better still think it is meant to be serious. The verbose and
prolixitous voice over summing up at the end is priceless.

1:49, NC-17, Drama/Comedy, 1970
Director: Russ Meyer
Cast: Dolly Read, Cynthia Myers, Marcia McBroom, John LaZar,
      Michael Blodgett, Edy Williams, Charles Napier
     This film shows three rock singers, Dolly Read, Cynthia Myers, and
Marcia McBroom, who go to L.A. and start to make it big.  They run into
many problems on the fast track and try to make it through them
successfully.
     BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS (the sequel to VALLEY OF THE DOLLS
by name only) has just been re-released on CBS/FOX Home Video (now just
called FOX Video I believe) and may be showing up in your local video
store.  This black comedy is worth seeing, if you can take weird dark
films.  On a scale of zero to five I give BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE
DOLLS a four (with reservations).  BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS is
rated NC-17 for female nudity, adult situations, explicit language, and
violence.
     The biggest problem with BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS is that it
is rather slow in some places and probably could have been cut by half
an hour.  Other than that, the story, which was written by Russ Meyer
and film critic Roger Ebert, is well written.  On of the best things
about this film is that it doesn't conform with Hollywood standards,
which is probably what earned it the NC-17 rating.  The ending to the
film is very well done and leaves the viewer with a satisfied feeling.
     The actors and actresses are normal B grade film actors.  They
don't have a lot of talent, yet they are not horrible.  In some ways
though, they make the film better than if it had a higher grade cast.
Because the film is about the lower class talent, it fits better, I
feel, to have a lower class cast.

     I recently had the--um--opportunity to see BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE
DOLLS at the Pacific Film Archive in Berkeley.  Among the odiferous genre
known as Badfilm this one stands out as a pungent weed: a film that is
skillfully bad.
     Imagine all the worst of the late Sixties (the film was made in the early
Seventies) strained through a Hollywood point of view and sliced like a
microtome sample right through the silliest parts.  Roger Ebert's screenplay is
a brilliant hodge-podge of paisley psycho-babble and psychedelic cliche.  I'm
convinced that he knew exactly what he was doing with the improbable and
wandering story of an all-girl rock group called "The Carrie Nations" (with
approximately six talents between them if you get my drift and I think you do).
I have serious doubts whether the director, Russ Meyer, knew what was going on
and it's clear that the actors hadn't a clue.
     Meyer, known for his soft-core photography of callimastian women of truly
heroic proportions, had impressed the studio with his "Vixens" film which
grossed tens of millions for a $600,000 outlay.  When he got his big budget to
make BVD (which has absolutely nothing to do with the VALLEY OF THE DOLLS
film/book by Jacqueline Suzanne), he ran right out and hired a schlock director
of photography and a kid from Chicago to write it.
     At least Ebert saw his chance.  I have a clear mental picture of him at
his typewriter:  Tap, tap, tap, and then roll on the floor with laughter.  I'm
sure he wondered if anybody would deliver the lines with straight faces.  As it
turned out, very little genuine emotion of any kind appears on any faces during
the film.  I still marvel at how several conversations were carried on without
saying one sentence in intelligible English.  ("This is my scene and it freaks
me out.")  Also telling is the searing accusation by an establishment lawyer:
"She has been living with three other people.  One of them is a man, and...,"
he turns, points a finger for dramatic effect, and emphasizes, "...the other
two are *women*!"
     I could go on and on.  The movie goes on and on.  And on.  And on.  Like a
bad symphony it keeps ending.  I counted four complete, distinct endings.  One
is an Eddie Wood-like voice over recounting the sins and lessons to be learned
of each character in the film.  By this point I realized that the film was not
merely an exercise in excess and bad taste, but a shaggy dog.  See it if you
think you can stand it.  It's a real education in how outrageous boredom can
be.
