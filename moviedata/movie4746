This is the first film made under the label of Dogma, a Scandinavian
film group inspired by the Danish director von Trier, which insists that
their new manifesto on how to make films, be adhered to by those who
make films under their label.
This dogma consists of improvised acting and hand-held camera work,
among other dogmas the film must adhere to. It reminds me most of  how
Godard filmed during his Mao stage, but without the apparent overt
political messages, as Godard's films during the late 60s were anti-film
films, replete with diatribes against the bourgeoisie, which seemed
filled with the director's hubris and self-congratulation on his
political stance, that he was right and others wrong in their beliefs,
and his rather tiresome political cliches, that seemed to be more
opportunistic than spontaneous, even though every attempt was to make
the film appear as if they were spontaneous.
Trier has a bunch of middle-class cult groupies living together in a
rich private house that one of their relatives gave them, as the group
members seem to be either in their late teens or their 20s, whose
repulsive purpose is to freak out in public and sometimes do it when
together in the privacy of their house. To spasse, is a Danish term,
which refers to those who act like idiots even though they are not.
These episodes of spassing give this film an odd look that is guaranteed
to turn off a lot people and anger many, especially those who expect
more conventional ways of looking at the problems young people face in
society.
The theme of the movie is certainly obnoxious, it is very difficult to
feel much of anything for these middle-class drop-outs, as we first
encounter them in action in an elegant restaurant and watch them spasse,
retardedly eating their food, under the direction of one of them
(Susanne), who pretends to be their keeper, while one of them, Stoffer,
grabs on to a lady (Karen), sitting alone, and refuses to let go of her.
Karen seems to be responding kindly to the idiot, just like she didn't
react with any ill emotion after being treated rather brusquely by the
waiter when she told him she doesn't have much money and will be just
ordering the salad. The group leaves together with Karen and tells her
it is just a game they enjoy playing, inviting her to join them, even
though she does not appear like they do, but she does look desperate and
lonely and unhappy, and might benefit from hanging around with such
idiots as they are.
They do another spassing in a Rockwood furniture factory, which was more
stupid than humorous and belabored any point that was trying to be made
about workers in a factory or about  middle-class values, it was goofy
in a way to watch them operate, as it seemed to be similar to the way
that fraternities might find their inane initiation rites uplifting to
their older members who already went through the initiation process to
join the group, but to outsiders it would seem like they were seeing a
bunch of spoiled children.
In another public spassing, Jeppe is left by the one playing his keeper
(Stoffer), with a burly looking bunch of tattooed, beer guzzling biker
types, who are asked to mind him for ten minutes, after they notice
Jeppe staring at their tattoos, while the keeper goes to the other part
of the bar. Again, it was not funny, but yet, it was curiously
interesting, in a prurient kind of way to see what the interaction was
going to be between these two groups of outcasts.
The most controversial part of the film is the sex orgy among the group
members, acting as idiots, and actually seeming to copulate on camera
(porno stars were used to do the sex), sort of giving the film a mock
documentary feel to it, as the orgy members smear caviar all over their
faces, and try to unbend from the middle-class environment they all came
out of. The tenderest love making was between the teenager Josephine and
the older Jeppe, who really seemed to be falling for each other, but
could only do it under the cover of being idiots. Soon Josephine's
father would embarrass her by coming to the group's home and removing
her from the home.
The film moved into the gist of the filmmaker's message when Stoffer,
the leader of the group, decided he would spin a bottle and whomever was
chosen would have to spasse in front of family members or those they
previously worked with. Axel and Henrik could not do it and thereby left
the group. What was becoming increasingly clear was that the game was
almost over for all of them, that they couldn't really confront the
idiot inside themselves, that it was becoming apparent to them, that it
was just a temporary game they were playing, perhaps, in an experimental
phase of their young life.
I think the point that von Trier was trying to make, is that you really
have to be an idiot to change the system, or think that you can change
it, but that you can only be effective when you really confront who you
are, reaching past the point of where authority rules who you are; or
else, you are stuck with the same cultural values you have always had
and can't really change who you have been brought up as. Being an idiot
is the last act of despair. It is an act of courage. And it only matters
when you can do it for real and not be using it to play a game. For von
Trier, being an idiot is an endearing way at looking at someone acting
out who he is, in order to initiate change in the system.
Karen's story now unfolds; and, she turns out to be the one with the
most dramatic thing to tell about her life. She volunteers to go back
home to do her spassing with Susanne as her witness. We meet her family,
who act cold towards her, asking her where she has been for the last two
weeks, and wondering why she didn't go to her baby's funeral. We meet
her husband, who shows her no love, and then we see her spasse on her
cream cake after dinner, acting as her baby might have acted when eating
the cake, and she gets slapped by her husband and leaves the house with
Susanne, who is filled with genuine tears. The trauma for her has
reached a point of no return, and the very dangers of spassing or
regressing back to one's childhood to find a way of dealing with a
society you are antagonistic to, seems frought with extreme personal
dangers, and the possiblity of a psychosis developing looms over all the
young people's heads.
Trier has made his point. He has won me over. This very unusual personal
film, that is very difficult to warm up to, that mocks what is
conventionally thought of as right, by doing what is unconscionable and
politically incorrect, becomes only too real and too sad to comprehend,
as it is presented so as not to give us a way out in our perception of
how to deal with the alienation the youngsters feel, as they seem to be
left with only their naive hopes and disillusionments; and possibly,
their emotional experiences that they can value. Their situation is not
resolved. The film does not end with all loose ends tied up in a nice
bow. We can't even be sure how long their commune life will continue,
and how soon it is that they will find themselves out in the cold world,
alone again, as misfits, where some of them will fit in without too much
trouble but will be living a lie; and, where others will find it very
difficult to go back to being middle-class, and will always be restless
in such a society. But they tried something... and whether they reached
their inner-self or not, something penetrated them, whether they are the
better for this experience, is difficult to tell, but something
significant to them did take place, just as we in the audience, whether
we liked the film or not, something inside us was moved by what we saw
taking place, causing us to react in a way we might not normally act
when watching a film; and, in my way of thinking, that is great
filmmaking.

Why would a group of upstanding citizens of the middle class decide to
meet in a large country house and get in touch with their inner idiot?
 These young people are in a continual training process to get in touch
with what they describe as their `inner idiot', allowing themselves to
lapse into behavior outside of the constrictions imposed by a society
obsessed with a mask of etiquette.
 Their revolutionary behavior is demonstrated when they journey out into
the `real world' to behave as though they are mentally retarded. They
wander into restaurants and dribble food over themselves, speaking in
gibberish, or they arrange for field trips to industrial factories where
they make a mockery of the foreman. Everything they do is an attempt to
break through the politically correct and achieve a cathartic response
in everyone they touch, be it frustration or disgust, anger or
humiliation.
 They're all pretty content to revel in their idiocy because it brings
them back to something primal, but are they dilettantes wasting their
time pis*ing people off, or are they indeed tapping into something that
is boldly social and political?
 Writer-director Lars von Trier, who supposedly wrote the screenplay in
four days and seems to rely heavily on improvisation, poses plenty of
difficult questions in The Idiots and refuses to hand his audience a
map. In fact, there's a rather large question mark as to whether his
film is merely an elaborate prank on the viewer or a genuine attempt to
question the modes of society when it comes to behavior and the attempts
to homogenize creativity and spontaneity.
 The character who introduces us to the world of The Idiots is Karen
(Bodil Jorgensen), an ordinary woman in a yellow sweater. We first see
her wandering around, uncertain where she wants to go. She goes into a
restaurant and orders her meal, and witnesses three of the `idiots'
wandering around playing with the patrons, who grow increasingly annoyed
with their childish behavior, and the helpless waiter who attempts to
maintain an atmosphere of calm within the restaurant. The tension of the
scene is the inability of those in the restaurant to insult people who
are `obviously' mentally handicapped and know not what they do.
 Karen goes with these three, who reveal themselves to in fact be
hypereducated members of the bourgeois. The leader of the group is the
intense Stoffer (Jens Albinus), whose uncle owns the house in which they
run their workshop. Karen passively observes their behavior around the
neighborhood - running around naked in the woods, or selling cheap
potted plants from house to house for an outrageous sum all the while
keeping up the front of being lumbering `idiots.'
 She and Stoffer engage in hearty debates of exactly what their
philosophy is, and why they would go to great lengths to prove a point
which seems to be different for each member in the group. Their arrogant
leader stresses the importance of what they are doing by savagely
insulting the routines of the humdrum real world they are escaping from
 the doctors, teachers, and privileged kids among them. `They are the
ones who are making fun,' sneers Stoffer, deflecting the argument that
all they do is stir up trouble and insult those around them.
The stakes grow increasingly higher as Stoffer pushes them to break out
of their shells, resulting in some of the scenes which made it so
difficult to release The Idiots in this country, particularly the
infamous "gang-bang' scene which results in a playful group orgy. It's
not so playful when von Trier cuts to a hardcore image of a penis
thrusting itself into a woman's vagina (and for the United States
release, a black bar will be inserted over the insulting mail member.
Funny how Basic Instinct didn't face the same problem with Sharon
Stone's winking crotch.
It becomes increasingly clear to some of the members of the group,
however, that Stoffer may not be able to handle the pressure he places
on the shoulders of his peers. There's a crucial scene midway through
the film when one of the `idiots' brings a group of people who have
Down's syndrome to the house for lunch, and the pretenders are forced to
look at the very people who they behave like, only without the guise of
`acting' or some political ideal of being an `idiot'.
The question of why anyone would want to explore their inner `idiot' or
`child' varies among the members of the group, but is brought home by
the crucial final scenes with Karen, where she allows herself to explore
her own unspoken motivations for becoming a part of their group. It's
powerfully affecting.
The Idiots is the second film to come out of the Dogme 95 Manifesto, a
series of guidelines created by von Trier and Thomas (The Celebration)
Vinterburg. The rules include that the film must be shot entirely
hand-held, in natural light. The sound must be recorded on location
(i.e., no dubbing or sound effects will be added in post-production.)
Also, no `genre' films are allowed, such as horror or science fiction.
Any Dogme 95 films which break their rules must make a confession (for
example, von Trier admits to using a `stunt penis' in the gang-bang
scene, using a porn star instead of the actual actor for the one shot.)
There's a certain amount of in-joke humor and sarcasm within the
manifesto, but it does serve to `shake up' cinematic conventions which
have become routine and predictable in modern film.
Of course, some may find the technical elements to be below par. It
looks as though it were fairly cheap to make, and is clearly video
technology  lacking the grain of film. The camera occasionally picks up
the boom pole or the shadow of the cameraman as it follows the action,
allowing itself to be cinema verite. It feels a little pompous, but
there's no denying that it captures a certain immediacy and spontaneity
in the performances which couldn't have been done any other way.
Lars von Trier has slowly been moving away from the classical filmmaking
approach he used in such films as the stylized, black and white
Zentropa, which, as experimental as his storytelling was, felt more or
less traditional in its carefully lit cinematography.
He moved deeper with Breaking the Waves, his amazing film about a young
woman's act of sacrifice for God, allowing the cameraman to shoot
entirely hand-held in a documentary style, never shooting a scene the
same way twice. In the editing room, he broke the rules of narrative
filmmaking and conventional cutting by allowing the emotional content of
the scene to dictate its flow, allowing for large jump cuts and radical
transitions.
With The Idiots, he's gone further than ever before. It's a
non-narrative story, with small fragments of scenes playing out entirely
at their own pace. The camera moves among it's large group of characters
focusing on whatever it finds most interesting, and only very slowly do
some of the characters begin to emerge as personalities. It's an
interactive film which allows you to take an interest in whatever
characters you like, since there is always a large flurry of activity
happening at any given time.
It's certainly an interesting approach to take, and substantially
different than most of the films you'll see this year. It's frustrating,
even annoyingly smug in its pompous display of a `new wave of
filmmaking.' It's annoying to feel as though von Trier has pulled one
over on you by not bothering to tell a story, or show you how to feel,
or even know whether or not he's insulting your lifestyle or the
characters onscreen.
Rating a film which is basically an elaborate experiment or Rosarch test
for the viewer is hardly an easy task. This is the type of film which
drifts between being a masterpiece and an utter failure, depending on
how you the viewer choose to respond to it. Ultimately, it calls for
repeated viewing if you have the patience or  more important  the
desire. It's decidedly not for everyone, and may alienate passive
audience members (or even active ones who decide it's degrading nonsense
from a smug, self satisfied little punk named Lars von Trier.) For my
money, it's one of the most interesting films which will be released
this year, and though I both love it and hate it, I'll give it the
highest possible recommendation.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
In 1995, Danish writer/director Lars von Trier established Dogma, a
oddly restrictive anti-establishment filmmaking manifesto that requires
its participants to take a vow of chastity forbidding the use of, among
other things, props, sets, artificial sound and light, lens filters and
superficial action, all while filming with one handheld camera.  To
date, it's worked wonders  producing von Trier's phenomenal Breaking
the Waves, Thomas Vinterberg's The Celebration and 1999 Cannes favorite
Mifune. von Trier's decree also forces its filmmakers to give up the
idea that they are creating art `at the cost of any good taste and any
aesthetic considerations.'  Yikes!
After watching The Idiots you could get the impression that von Trier is
probably more than a little like the film's lead, Stoffer (Jens
Albinus).  Stoffer is the ringleader of a very bizarre co-ed communal
household of fellow Danes that have shunned the normal life for that of
relative idiocy.  That's right  I said idiocy.  The David Lynch
lookalike Stoffer and his housemates venture out into civilization for
the sole purpose of acting like retards.
Now before you get all upset, think back to Matt Dillon telling Cameron
Diaz about his little friend `Mongo,' and tell me that you didn't laugh
up a lap full of popcorn.  Acting retarded isn't wrong.  In fact, Adam
Sandler gets $20 million per picture to do it.  Someday you might even
encourage your kids to do the same.
But these idiots are different than Sandler's.  They're probably closer
kin to Stanley Tucci and Oliver Platt in The Impostors  people using
their skills to con themselves into positions that are generally
unobtainable by the average Joe (or, in this case, your average Bjřrn).
Acting retarded is handy when you're dining out and want to skip out on
the check.  It can also get you access to tour a factory that would
otherwise be off-limits.
Don't get me wrong  this movie shouldn't make you think of Pauly
Shore.  It's a fascinating character study that makes you wish that the
film could continue on after the credits role, just so you could learn
more about what makes these people tick (the handheld filming gives The
Idiots a very real, documentary feel).  Why is Stoffer so hell-bent on
obtaining perfect idiocy?  Why do the young lovebirds Jeppe (Nikolaj Lie
Kaas) and Josephine (Louise Mieritz) still act retarded during their
first romantic encounter?  Why does Karen (Bodil Jřrgensen) seem so
willing to be kidnapped by the idiots during one particular scam?
Trying to answer these questions is pretty futile once the
full-penetration scene hits the screen.  But I'm not complaining

     My review of the BLAIR WITCH PROJECT made reference to the fact
that it was very nearly a Dogma 95 film, probably without even trying.
In the September 13 NEW YORKER David Denby makes the same observation.
In the most recent episode of Roger Ebert's review program on TV he
said that JULIEN DONKEY-BOY is a Dogma 95 film.  Now a correspondent
has asked me to explain my take on Dogma 95.  Well, I cannot claim to
be an expert, but here goes.
     Back in the 1960s an issue of MAD MAGAZINE talked about audiences
who went to see foreign films.  Their illustration was an audience
watching a film and the image on the screen was of water with one arm,
limp at the wrist rising above the surface.  In other words they were
watching something depressing.  Even then there was the idea that
European art films were serious, depressing, nihilistic affairs and
American films were somehow lighter.  There was probably some truth to
this.  Most were not as glum as the MAD image would indicate though
maybe Andrzej Wadja's KANAL, which takes place mostly in a sewer, might
be a candidate.  Roberto Rosellini's OPEN CITY is very downbeat also.
It is an anti-Nazi film shot secretly in Rome while it was still
occupied by Nazis.  (I picture Rosellini setting up on the street like
we see the title character do in ED WOOD.  But when he yells "run" his
film crew really had something worth running from.)  American films of
the post-war era like John Wayne westerns were generally lighter fare.
     Flash forward to the 1990s and there is still the division.  We
now have computer techniques to create visuals that are spectacular.
Films have never looked better.  On the other hand, there are very few
films of much substance.  The American film industry is catering in
large degree to the public who spends the most money on films.  That is
people from age 15 to 25.  That audience tends not to like a lot of
deep thought in their films.  So the formula is to aim films at that
range, make them dumb if necessary but very visual, and if the film is
not theatrically marketable, it can go direct to cable or cassette.
There are not many films of any substance being made these days by the
major American studios.  It is too easy to make a nice looking film
without much substance that will appeal to the affluent but not well
discerning audiences.  Compounding the problem is that good filmmakers
like Paul Verhoeven make substantial films in their own country, then
get seduced by the big budgets of the American film industry and never
make a film of real substance again.  A set of European filmmakers have
said that they are not going to make artificial special effects driven
films, they are going to make films in what appears to be the tradition
of Roberto Rosellini.  They will follow a list of ten rules drafted by
Danish filmmaker Lars von Triers:
     I swear to submit to the following set of rules drawn up and
confirmed by DOGMA 95:
     1. Shooting must be done on location. Props and sets must not be
brought in (if a particular prop is necessary for the story, a location
must be chosen where this prop is to be found).
     2. The sound must never be produced apart from the images or vice
versa. (Music must not be used unless it occurs where the scene is
being shot).
     3. The camera must be hand-held. Any movement or immobility
attainable in the hand is permitted. (The film must not take place
where the camera is standing; shooting must take place where the film
takes place).
     4. The film must be in color. Special lighting is not acceptable.
(If there is too little light for exposure the scene must be cut or a
single lamp be attached to the camera).
     6. The film must not contain superficial action. (Murders,
weapons, etc. must not occur.)
     7. Temporal and geographical alienation are forbidden. (That is to
say that the film takes place here and now.)
     Films that already have been made following these conventions
include BREAKING THE WAVES and THE CELEBRATION.  Obviously the mystical
number ten was important in the rules since even von Triers himself has
never followed his own tenth rule.  (Or perhaps is it just not that we
know of.)  THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, by chance, or perhaps inspired by
the same concerns followed Rules 1 to 7.  And that film's appeal is the
immediacy of its action which is certainly one of the goals of Dogma
95.
     The Dogma 95 directors are in a sense the puritans of the
international film industry.  This is not in the sense that they eschew
sex and naughty words in their films, but they have reacted to what
they see as excesses in the film industry by creating their own strict
set of rules to live by apart from the mainstream.  They want a more
natural, less gimmicky and not by chance a less expensive mode of
filmmaking.  It itself is a gimmick and I am sure even the Dogma 95
filmmakers admire a great many films that break many of their rules.
     Is Dogma 95 in itself a good idea?  One might as well ask if
Cubism is a good idea.  It is a movement that will appeal to some and
not to others.  Most people I talk to do not like Dogma 95 films.  A
common objection is the use of the hand-held camera.  This is not a
device that a filmmaker like Rosellini used because it was not around
in his time.  But he undoubtedly would have appreciated the naturalism
of filming with a box you hold in your hands.  The over-use of hand-
held cameras does lead to motion sickness in some viewers.
     One thing certain is that Dogma 95 strips away from film a lot of
the folderol that distracts from the theme and essence of a film.  Like
other forms of Puritanism it clearly is intended to elevate substance
over style, which is probably a good thing.  And it is not a movement
that is going away after one or two films.  I think it will be with us
for a while at least.

Pioneered by Danish enfant terrible Lars Von Trier, the Dogma
manifesto represents a back to basics style of film making.  The
manifesto stipulates that films made under its guidelines are truly
collaborative efforts, without individual recognition or credit given
to cast and crew.  Under this code of practice, films are shot on
location using hand held cameras and natural lighting, and attempt to
draw out the natural emotional elements of a specific scenario rather
than rely on artificially created action.  The Idiots (Idioterne) is
the first film produced under this manifesto to reach Australian
screens, and it is something of an eye opener.
The Idiots is a challenging, provocative and outrageous film
about a group of middle class friends who "spass" - pretend to be
mentally handicapped in public places.  Spassing allows them to get
free meals from restaurants and enables them to get away with
behaviour that would normally be greeted with condemnation.  People
are prepared to tolerate and accept certain standards of behaviour,
and make allowances for the handicapped, but this group callously
trade on their generosity and faith.  The group live in a communal
arrangement in the house owned by Stoffer's uncle.  The loosely
structured plot follows them through a number of public encounters - a
factory tour, a swimming lesson, a meeting with a couple of bikies -
and explores the hypocrisy of society when it comes to dealing with
mental illness.  There are some hilarious sequences throughout, but
there is also an uncomfortably vicious tone to some of the group's
antics.  In one scene, Stoffer introduces his friends to some
potential buyers who have come to check out his uncle's house.  While
the couple profess to be comfortable with their handicaps, they can't
wait to get away.
The lonely and troubled Karen (Bodil Jorgensen) briefly joins
the group, and finds solace and escape from the harsh reality of her
life.  But slowly the group begins to fall apart as their spassing
gets out of control.  The Idiots explores the dynamics of group
behaviour, and depicts how the selfish actions of one person can
impact on the harmony and unity of the rest.
The film's content may well offend many in the audience, but
one suspects this is what Von Trier deliberately set out to achieve.
Some eight seconds worth of footage have been deleted from the
climactic orgy scene.  Von Trier has always been a provocative and
challenging director, but here he is also pushing aesthetic and
ethical boundaries to the limit.  With its naturalistic,
quasi-documentary style, Von Trier also seems to be deliberately
turning his back on those earlier stylish films that established his
reputation as one of Europe's finest and most inventive young
directors (Europa, etc).  Some scenes seem improvised, and the
performances are natural and spontaneous.  There is something of an
amateurish look to the film as boom microphones keep dropping into the
shot, and crew members can be seen walking around in the background on
several occasions.  The jerky, hand held camera movements and the
fuzzy, out of focus shots eventually become irritating.  Ultimately,
this style of cinema verite becomes an artifice rather than a genuine
advance in cinematic technique.
Von Trier gives The Idiots a sort of warts-and-all
documentary-style feels, as he features talking heads interviews with
the principal characters to disguise the technical blemishes.
Brimming with contentious ideas, The Idiots offers a
challenging time at the cinema that many within the audience will not
feel entirely comfortable with.  The film will certainly polarise
audiences, and many may not last the distance.  While The Idiots lacks
the raw emotional power of Von Trier's Breaking The Waves, it will
still move audiences in other ways.
