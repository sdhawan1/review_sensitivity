Filled with the worst kind of popular tripe, 'Never Been Kissed' is the
ultimate focus group movie.  Every detail of the film's script, and other
(for lack of a better term) academics have been scrutinized and marketed to
an audience where only one core group, high school senior girls, will
appreciate it.  The film's wardrobe, high school atmosphere, teenage and
teacher stereotypes as well as a totally unbelievable story make this movie
more than a waste of time and that is an understatement.  It runs 110
minutes but feels more like two and a half hours.
Drew Barrymore plays Josie Geller, a 25 year old copy editor at the Chicago
Sun Times (I wonder what Roger Ebert will think of this movie), who goes
undercover as a 17 year old to do a story of high school life in 1999.  But
there is much more to the plot than that.  Josie is a virgin and has never
been kissed.  She was ridiculed throughout her time in high school by class
mates who played cruel and unusual jokes on her.  In those days, she wore
her hair like a cave woman, had braces on her teeth and wore baggy overall
dresses.  Even her supposed date for the high school prom showed up at her
front door by passing by in a fully equipped limo and stuck his head through
the sun roof, producing a stunning female companion next to him and they
hurled eggs at Josie in her prom dress and laughed as they continued to
drive by.  This assignment by the paper sort of gives Josie a second chance
to "fit in".
The pranks come fast and furiously upon her return to school as three
conceited Barbie doll wannabes (Jessica Alba, Marley Shelton, Jordan Ladd)
make fun of her using guys at the school that they have trained to obey them
and they accuse Josie of wearing an outfit that became extinct in 1983.
Josie falls for her English teacher (Michael Vartan) who is one of only
three appealing characters in the film.  The other two are Josie's brother
(David Arquette) and a girl who befriends her at school (Leelee Sobieski).
The other characters in the film are a complete throwaway.  They are Josie's
head boss (Garry Marshall?), her other superior (John C. Reilly) and the
office tramp (Molly Shannon).
'Never Been Kissed', for those who will like it, will probably find it
comparable later in life to a record you bought when you were in high school
but hated it when you were well into your adult years.  The film is also
extremely tasteless in many scenes.  It makes fun of high school metal
detectors, getting high, alleged safe sex involving bananas as a demo, and
drug use among some minority groups.  Drew Barrymore, who served as
executive producer, also looked very confusing in this film.  Her weight
seemed to shift from scene to scene.  In one scene she had a double chin and
her clothes made her look plump.  At other times she looked fine but these
factors kept switching back and fourth throughout the run of the movie.
Director Raja Gosnell ('Home Alone 3'), photographs the film in an extremely
ordinary way.  The pace Gosnell gives the film is like wading through heavy
snow.  There is no real focus to the story.  This mess looks and feels like
a series of out takes from a bad movie.
There is a movie from 1985 entitled 'Just One of the Guys' where an
extremely attractive female high school reporter proves she can be taken
seriously when she assumes the disguise of a boy, transfers to another
school and does her job.  That film knew how to enter the appealing side of
your mind and having seen it when I was 19, I still enjoy it at 33.  'Never
Been Kissed' is de facto entertainment.  And a couple of guys in the back
row of the theatre where I saw it were actually hurling humourous insults at
the screen which was the best part of the film.  The film is like many other
recent teenage rumblings getting more and more popular in film and making a
mockery of the greatest medium in the world and infecting it like a cancer.
Unlike promotional materials for 'I Still Know What You Did Last Summer' and
'Cruel Intentions', where Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar's
breasts were used as shameful marketing tools, 'Never Been Kissed' at least
looked appealing going in.  Too bad its execution was a total failure.

Have you ever wanted to go back to high school and try to relive some of the
moments that you missed, knowing all of the things that you know now? Well,
Drew Barrymore gets that opportunity in this teenage flick that continues to
propagate Hollywood's love affair with all things young, beautiful and
teen-oriented.
PLOT:
Rookie newspaper reporter is placed undercover in a high school to write an
article about the "kids of today". Having been a major nerd in her high
school days, Josie (Barrymore) tries to adapt to the hip, young kids, but
finds the transition just as painful as it was in her original days.
CRITIQUE:
Generic, unoriginal, mildly amusing comedy, offers very little in laugh-out
loud humor, but does give us several dynamic performances, and some
surprisingly tender moments. Granted, there are only a handful of films
coming out nowadays that offer much in original thought (RAVENOUS (7.5/10)
is one of the few that plops right into my head), but a few wise-cracks
about Archie, Betty and Veronica, do not a hip and unique script make.
Fortunately for this film, it doesn't bore us, isn't too long, and it does
give us a somewhat original ending, with a countdown conclusion that is
definitely unique. Garry Marshall was also very funny in all of his scenes,
but regrettably, he's only in a few of them. David Arquette also steals some
thunder in his role as the older brother, and Molly Shannon has at least one
interesting sequence in a classroom.
Kudos go to Drew Barrymore for allowing herself to look this bad for this
movie (Except in the prom scene, in which she looks absolutely stunning in
that medieval dress). She is the ultimate geek, but I found her character to
be a little too unbelievable and dorky. It seemed like she was made to be
the ultimate loser, but I didn't buy it. I also didn't appreciate any of the
other "geeks" and "hipsters" in her high school, because they were all drawn
out of the same one-dimensional chalkboard that all of these teenage movies
seem to manufacture. And this is despite Leelee Sobieski's solid performance
as the head-geek. Add an upbeat soundtrack, a good-looking Luke
Perry-wannabee teacher by the way of newcomer Michael Vartan, and you've got
yourself another teenage high school movie of the week, with a sweet ending,
forgettable characters, and what seemed like more drama than laughs. Your
video machine will appreciate it, but your hard-earned bucks at the movie
theatre will not. Oh yeah, and if anyone in Hollywood is listening, I think
it's time to start slowing down the teen-flick machine. Me thinks it's
starting to bubble over.
NOTE: One thing that was truly original about this movie was its closing
credits. Alongside all of the names of the folks in the film, a high school
picture of their days of young. Cute, if you dig that kind of thing.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Actress Drew Barrymore also served as the executive producer of this film.
Flower Films is her production company. Her middle name is Blythe and she is
godmother to Courtney Love's daughter Frances Bean.
When not acting, actor David Arquette performs with his band Ear 2000. Their
song "The Race" is featured on the SCREAM 2 (7/10) soundtrack. He is
currently engaged to actress Courtney Cox.
Actor Michael Vartan was born in Paris to a French father and an American
mother. He grew up in the tiny Normandy village of Fleury (pop. 300) until
the age of 18 when he moved to Los Angeles to live with his mother. Soon
thereafter, he enrolled in acting classes and started working both here and
in France. He speaks both English and French fluently.
Garry Marshall, who plays Barrymore's boss in this film, is a film director
in his own right. His credits include PRETTY WOMAN (7.5/10), FRANKIE AND
JOHNNY (8/10) and THE FLAMINGO KID. His most recent effort was THE OTHER
SISTER starring Juliette Lewis.
Director Raja Gosnell's first shot at directing was the third installment of
the HOME ALONE series, after working as a film editor for over fifteen
years, editing both previous HOME ALONE movies.
This is the first full-length screenplay for writers Abby Kohn and Marc
Silverstein. They came up with the premise for this movie while attending
the Master's Program at the USC School of Cinema-Television.

Teenagers have a lot of power in Hollywood. Every year countless films 
will be made targeting that audience in particular, and rely on the 
entire teenage population to turn out on Friday and Saturday nights, 
wallets in hand. The formula is very simple, you make a film with a big 
name young actor or actress with sex appeal. You add a high school 
environment that features everyone from prom queens to math club nerds, 
and then a very simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in 
90 minutes, the typical teenage attention span. The response is enormous 
as this part of the population will waste it92s money on almost any =
film set in an environment they can relate to, and, most importantly, 
they don92t care to judge films=92 quality, so any piece of trash will =
due. That is just what Never Been Kissed, the latest film from director 
Raja Gosnell, is; trash.
Josie Geller (Drew Barrymore) is the youngest copy editor in the history 
of the Chicago Sun Times. She has her own personal assistant, unlimited 
supplies, and her own office. But she is very much dismayed with her 
position in life. There is nothing she wants more than to be a reporter 
and go out into the field, where she can play a more active role in the 
Chicago media. So when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her 
out of nowhere, she jumps at it with elation.
Constantly smothering Josie in the work place is her friend Anita (Molly 
Shannon) and her amicable superior, Gus (John C. Reilly). The two of 
them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first 
assignment, as they both deem her to be an office worker and not a 
reporter. However, since this film is aimed at a teenage audience with 
little patience for character conflict, this otherwise interesting 
scenario is resolved within two minutes, and Josie is headed for the 
field.
Obviously, the field assignment involves a high school. Specifically, 
she is to become an undercover reporter at a high school, by enrolling 
in the senior class and "becoming one of them." I don92t think that I =
need to even begin to explain all the impossibilities of this situation 
ever occurring, so I won92t.
The movie develops into Josie trying to find the life that she never led 
in high school. Interwoven flashback scenes show us just how much of a 
dork she truly was, and she appears to be heading down that road again. 
Fortunately for this lame production, other characters do appear that 
make some of these high school scenes both humorous and remotely 
interesting. They include the predictable love stories, between both a 
student (Jeremy Jordan) and a teacher (Michael Vartan), to show that 
Josie is really two people in one body. Also, her younger brother and 
opposite, Rob (David Arquette) comes into her new found life and even 
causes a rare scene that is mildly provocative.
The humor found in this film is actually quite amusing. Typical for 
teenage films, it is chalk full of sexual innuendoes and condom humor. 
One scene in particular features a certain classroom activity involving 
bananas and latex that is absolutely hysterical. Most of the other jokes 
are straight forward high school humor that anyone who has ever been to 
high school can appreciate and will enjoy. But those still don92t =
recover for the total lack of quality in this movie.
Following this trend of high school movie rules, comes the general 
acting. It is even worse than the trend of overplaying a scenario from 
film to film. In this case, Drew Barrymore is absolutely painful to 
watch. She is required to play her character on two levels, having some 
very black and white transitions. And although some scenes are written 
to be particular shades of gray, she seems to hold that color throughout 
all of her screen time. At one point she is alone with an obvious love 
interest on a Ferris wheel, and is expected to him on an adult level, 
since he is one, her teacher. But she never seems to get out of the gray 
area, and in doing so she makes a mockery out of his otherwise good 
performance.
Following Barrymore is the pitiful Molly Shannon (Saturday Night Live). 
She seems to be limited to playing an ecstatic character that no one can 
relate to, and draws the attention of an audience as simply unrealistic. 
It is these "qualities" that prevent the aforementioned condom scene 
from being one of the few decent.
Luckily there is one great performance to emerge out of this otherwise 
bleak film. David Arquette (Scream) takes home the prize for being able 
to stand out in an ensemble performance that is absolutely pathetic, and 
not have his brilliant acting ruined. And as a central character he gets 
to take on his own mini-plot, which is one of the few well done parts of 
Never Been Kissed. In a dazzling cherry-on-the-sundae type piece of 
work, he does an absolutely hilarious Tom Cruise impression from the 
1983 hit, Risky Business.
Never Been Kissed is a mediocre film at best. The predictable plot has 
become so overplayed in Hollywood, that it is sickening to watch time 
and again, and this film is no exception. The acting is just as bad, but 
there is the one positive presence of David Arquette to add some light. 
Unfortunately, the bottom line is that the movie will be a success, 
because teenagers will pay to see any trash.

Release Date: April 9, 1999
Starring: Drew Barrymore, David Arquette, Michael Vartan, Molly Shannon,
John C. Reilly, Garry Marshall, Octavia Spencer
Directed by: Raja Gosnell
Distributed by: 20th Century Fox Films Corp.
MPAA Rating: PG-13 (sex-related material, some drug content)
If you've ever asked this question to someone of considerable age, you
undoubtedly know the answer is something like, "Not unless I could have
the knowledge I do now." And indeed, there's a certain naďveté about the
teenage years that befits the young but baffles the elderly. This
philosophical fountain of youth is pondered in the lyrics of songs and
countless movies, but most recently it's given a home in the flighty
Raja Gosnell romance NEVER BEEN KISSED. 
Gosnell (HOME ALONE 3)'s story is also a foray into the
fish-out-of-water theme, which posits a character in unfamiliar settings
and exploits the implied, resultant humor. In this case, Chicago
Sun-Times copy editor Josie Gellar (Drew Barrymore) is chosen to write
an undercover piece on today's high schoolers. Unfortunately, in her
first go at it, Josie was a real geek -- worse than Paul on "The Wonder
Years." To the rescue comes her brother Rob (David Arquette), who proves
the little-known truth that it only takes one person to think you're
cool to be "in." Soon Josie is in the running for prom queen and the
romantic interest of stud English teacher Sam Coulson (Michael Vartan). 
Throughout this story the movie attempts to juggle several different
ideas before dropping them all in favor of a predictable and
disappointing ending. The first of these themes is Josie's inadaquate
character for the job of undercover reporting -- she's a control freak
copy editor, accustomed to correcting people's grammar and not sliding
into hip-and-trendy MTV-era high school. This idea gets dropped in favor
of the second one, which is the inevitable humiliation that will occur
when Josie attends high school. The third subplot, which is unfinished
and consequently unsuccessful, is the romantic possibility between Josie
and her English teacher Coulson; the resolution to this plot does not
make sense. And finally, the fourth facet of the script is Rob's minor
role in Josie's life, as well as his "redemption" in high school. Truly,
his story holds interesting potential, but it too is compromised in a
quick-and-easy ending. 
The cast carries off these different larks in typical and unremarkable
fashion. Barrymore gives a lackluster performance here, which is
especially disappointing after she had received such high acclaim for
her last two romantic pictures (EVER AFTER and THE WEDDING SINGER). She
proves here that she's unable to carry a movie which has little support
and relies heavily on the lead. In terms of support, both Arquette
(SCREAM 2) and Vartan (THE MYTH OF FINGERPRINTS) have too little
screentime and not enough to say to make an effective appearance. There
is not a standout player among the lot. 
In terms of romantic offerings this year, NEVER BEEN KISSED falls below
par. There are those who will sympathize with the geekiness of
Barrymore's character, but in its own right, the movie paralells its
oddity. Nothing ever comes together, and other than a good laugh or two
at the expense of others, time and money are best spent elsewhere.

        "Never Been Kissed" is the sort of film that would thrill
the cast of "Mystery Science Theater 3000," the legendary
television show which has elevated the process of watching
horrible movies into an art form.  They'd have a field day with
this film's attempted sentimentality, its happy-go-lucky acting
style, and the numerous jokes which fall far short of anything so
blatant as outright humor.  They'd also likely appreciate the
story's attempts to bring warm and fuzzy cheeziness to every
convention it attempts to embrace.  Ah, thank you, movie.
        If you've seen the trailer, you basically know every twist
of the story.  Twenty-five year-old Josie Geller (Drew Barrymore)
is a junior editor for the Chicago Sun-Times, though she dreams
of pursuing her passion: writing.  Her editor doesn't think she's
ready to be a reporter, but she finally gets her big break thanks
to her youthful appearance.  Her mission: go undercover as a high-
school student and write a series of articles about the trials and
tribulations modern teens have to face on a daily basis.  It's a
choice assisgnment; if she does well, it could break her career
wide-open.
        The problem is, Josie is much too conservative and spastic
to be accepted into the elite cliques she's supposed to be milking
for story material; she is even, horror of horrors, considered
"uncool."  Because of her plain, unattractive features (yes, Drew
Barrymore is playing an ugly duckling-- more on this later), she
is relegated to the outskirts of the school's social circle,
eventually befriending a fellow nerd named Aldys (Leelee Sobieski
from "Deep Impact").  Aldys appears to be a sweet, highly-
intelligent girl, whose biggest problem is her unusual name.  "Try
being named after a guitar-playing pussycat," laments Josie in a
joke that apparently flew over the heads of the fourteen year-olds
who filled the theater at my advance screening.
        Even among the monsoon of wretchedness currently
playing at your local cinema, "Never Been Kissed" stands out
as a shining beacon of irrelevance, a shimmering tower of
"Who Cares?".  None of us are strangers to bad movies, but
even so, it's fairly rare to get one which is not only clueless,
formulaic, and obviously tailored to the lowest common
denominator, but completely oblivious to its own lack of merit
as well.  "Never Been Kissed," bless its little heart, actually
seems to think it's telling the audience an entertaining story,
rather than one full of stereotypes and the cinematic cliches
we've seen so many times before.  It's rather like watching
"Casablanca," as performed by a group of first-graders.  It's
crude, shallow, and insulting.  I have absolutely no doubt it
will make at least a hundred million dollars at the box office.
        As anyone who has seen the trailer already knows, Josie
eventually blossoms into a creature of grace and beauty.  No
surprise there, and the sooner the better: the scenes with the
"ugly" Josie are among the most unintentionally funny that I've
witnessed all year.  Barrymore looks like a woman desperately
trying to hide the fact that she's a knockout, rather like Rachel
Leigh Cook in "She's All That."  No amount of crusty hairdos or
horrid, overdone zombie-esque makeup can hide the fact that our
star is hot stuff, and the way the movie expects us to simply buy
into the fiction shows us just how low Hollywood's opinion of the
average moviegoer's mentality is.  (See also "The Truth About
Cats and Dogs," "Hope Floats," and the aforementioned "She's
All That.")  Nonetheless, we are subjected time and time again
to cheap gags involving Josie's confirmed "loser" status while
the film meanders slowly towards its utterly predictable
conclusion.
        One thought ran through my mind like a mantra as I watched
this movie: if you're an adult who's so insecure that you require
acceptance from a group of high-school students, you've got bigger
problems than never having been kissed.  The film asks us to cheer
for Josie, even as she tries to befriend a group of people who would
make Ace Ventura look like a Jedi master.  Poor Josie falls in love
twice, once with her teacher (Michael Valtan), and once with the
school's O.D.M.O.C. (Obligatory Dashing Man on Campus).  It's all
sweet and gooshy and smarmy, but I wonder how innocent it
would've felt if Josie had instead been a twenty-five year-old
guy, picking up a seventeen year-old schoolgirl under false
pretenses.  Would the teenyboppers in the audience still have
cheered at the conclusion of the film?  Probably not.  Double
standards are "cool," you know.

Never Been Kissed, starring Drew Barrymore, Michael Vartan, Molly Shannon,
David Arquette, Leelee Sobieski and Garry Marshall.  Directed by Raja Gosnell. 
1999.
   In the past few years, teenage-geared movies have become all the "rage" in
Hollywood.  Starting with the wildly popular Scream, teenage films have become
a must in most studios.  However, like all fads, this one is coming to its end.
 Never Been Kissed entered the race late for the teen audience, and ironically,
had a twenty-five year-old star leading the way.  Just like the fad it was made
for, Never Been Kissed fails in all ways possible, yet somehow keeps you from
hating it, which is about the only thing it does right.
   The premise of Never Been Kissed revolves around the Chicago-Sun Times's
copy editor, Josie Geller, also known as Josie Grossie.  Her ultimate dream is
to become an investigative reporter, and when she gets her first-ever
assignment from Mr. Rigfort (Garry Marshall), she has to go back to high school
and investigate the teens that go there.  I must admit, I personally thought
this could have been a wonderful premise for a comedy, but, director Raja
Gosnell obviously was forced to aim this towards teens and Never Been Kissed
fails even before it starts.
   Drew Barrymore stars as Josie Geller, and continues her streak of "adorable"
performances.  With such a horrible script, Barrymore basically tries to carry
the film on her shoulders.  Unfortunately, the burden is too much.  Barrymore
gives Never Been Kissed only a few scents of decent laughs, and not even SNL's
Molly Shannon can get more than one laugh.  Yes, she even manages to do worse
than she did in the hideous Superstar, because she at least gave an effort in
that film.
   The rest of the cast is basically unrecognizable, and that aspect is
illuminated by their terrible performances.  David Arquette plays Rob, Josie's
brother, and despite not being that funny in the first place, Never Been Kissed
does not even capitalize on his ability to get a few stunt laughs.
   The biggest problem with Never Been Kissed is all of the ripe possibilities.
 Instead of capitalizing on the laughs that could have been gained between the
budding relationship between the student and teacher (Barrymore and Michael
Vartan), they make it serious, and do not even do that well.  Never Been Kissed
even brushes on some funny topics, like Rob dating a 16 year-old gymnast, but
instead of divulging into the topic, it is hastily resolved and ignored for the
rest of the film.
   Despite all of the gripes, and there are a lot of them, it is still hard to
hate Never Been Kissed.  Drew Barrymore has an aura about her that is able to
save a few shreds of decency for such a horrible film.  Barrymore once again
proves she can lead a film, it just seems that the rest of the world is not
ready to pay to see it.  Until Barrymore can get into another good film,
something like The Wedding Singer, which allows her to shine and get laughs,
Barrymore will continue to play second fiddle to other romantic comedies like
Notting Hill.
   While it may be hard to hate Never Been Kissed, it is still a horrible piece
of filmmaking, if it can even be called that.  Once Barrymore leaves the
screen, that hatred shoots up as fast as possible.  Unless you are a really big
Drew Barrymore fan- and I mean a BIG Barrymore fan- please stay away from Never
Been Kissed.  Rent something better, even something meaningful, like the
wonderful Life is Beautiful.

Rating: *** (out of ****)
20th Century Fox / 1:46 / 1999 / PG-13 (language, brief drug use, sexual
discussion)
Cast: Drew Barrymore; David Arquette; Michael Vartan; Molly Shannon;
John C. Reilly; Leelee Sobieski; Garry Marshall
Director: Raja Gosnell
Screenplay: Abby Kohn; Marc Silverstein
What kind of movie combines a preposterous premise with improbable
casting, confusing character treatment and an overdose of gloppy
sentimentality? In the case of "Never Been Kissed," a thoroughly
charming one. It's rare when a film coasts on pure star power alone, but
this lightweight if extremely pleasant romantic fantasy is downright
unthinkable without the talents of totally game lead Drew Barrymore. Her
perfectly sunny performance elevates what could have been grade-C
schmaltz into quite the springtime charmer. Only gruff cranks will leave
the theatre unsatisfied - at least with Barrymore.
She plays Josie Gellar, an ambitious, mid-20s copy editor at "The
Chicago Sun-Times" who suffers from the titular lack of passion in her
too-rigid life, let alone a nerdy facade, stuffy wardrobe and
unflattering hair-don't that keeps Barrymore's spunky sexuality
successfully under wraps. Fate tosses her a second chance when her
grumpy superior (Garry Marshall) orders her to enroll undercover at the
local high school to get the scoop - any scoop. Exactly how this is done
is never revealed, and it would be a major enjoyment roadblock had
"Never Been Kissed" already made us so eager to watch Barrymore's ugly
duckling become a swan.
Flashbacks confirm Josie's past nightmarish educational experience -
where she was dubbed "Josie Grossie" by cruel classmates and made the
victim of a vicious prank - and here she is out of her element again,
trying her darndest to make friends with the in-crowd. They, of course,
reject Josie at first, only to later embrace her following some story
twists best described as unlikely. But so what if practically nothing in
this movie rings true? Barrymore, in a role that definitely goes against
type (come on, who _wouldn't_ want to be her buddy - or more?), performs
with such conviction that even the biggest leaps in logic are pretty
irrelevant.
Also ultimately mattering little by the time "Never Been Kissed" arrives
at its grandly melodramatic - yet wholly satisfying - ending are the
occasionally iffy relationships Barrymore has with some of her co-stars.
As a new student, Josie becomes friends with a math clubber (Helen Hunt
lookalike Leelee Sobieski) also spurned by the hip kids, but she
disappears for a long while following an odd bonding sequence that moves
all too quickly from tears to giggles. And when Josie finally clicks
with an ambiguously-written trio of Miss Popularities and one Mr. Cool,
"Kissed" can't decide if it wants to hiss or laugh at them.
Better luck is had with supporting actors David Arquette, as Josie's
underachieving brother, and "Saturday Night Live" ace-pratfaller Molly
Shannon, as an oversexed "Times" co-worker. They exist to prod the story
along (sometimes plausibly, sometimes not), which includes Josie's
potential - and potentially reciprocated - attraction to a handsome,
young English teacher (Michael Vartan). Since she's working under the
guise of a 17-year-old, this subplot sounds full of the Mary Kay
LeTorneau heebie-jeebies, but pulling it off is Barrymore and Vartan's
welcome subtlety in some surprisingly tender scenes that addresses its
implications.
The big prom finale has been seen before in every recent bit of
teen-oriented fare (from "She's All That" to "10 Things I Hate About
You" - take your pick), and "Never Been Kissed" assuredly follows suit.
This time, though, the formula doesn't feel old because of an
interesting literary couples theme - bonus points for Josie's smashing
Renaissance costume and the visual references to Raoul Duke and Dr.
Gonzo references - and a treacly moment-of-truth that actually works.
The related monologue is delivered by Barrymore's Josie, of course, and
her emotional strength make this preachiness, this person and this movie
utterly embraceable.

"Upon hearing word of this outrage, Star Wars' creator George Lucas (in
the throes of developing scripts for the two remaining "Star Wars"
films) quickly removed all references to an upcoming character allegedly
named Stingy MacHaggis, a kilt-wearing alien who was to spend a good
portion of Episode II' drinking, picking fights and playing an alien

Someone give a pat on the back to Drew Barrymore's agent.  This agent has
literally erased the bad girl image of Barrymore with the last few films
she has done.  And with Never Been Kissed it's not any different, Barrymore
is just so lovable in this film.
Never Been Kissed is not a plausible film by any means: A 25 year old copy
editor from the Chicago Sun Times, who has never really been kissed, is
sent back to high school to do an undercover story about high school life
in the 90s.  But, this implausibility is instantly lost as we meet Josie
(Barrymore) Gellar, the copy who is going to be sent on the assignment.
Barrymore is so cute and huggable in this film that we instantly relate to her.
Josie is, at first, ecstatic about the undercover assignment  it marks her
first writing assignment for the Sun Times.  But, as her brother Rob (David
Arquette) reminds her of the things that she went through her first time in
high school she starts to withdraw from the idea of going back a second
time.   Josie was a loser in high school, known as `Josie Grossie', and it
takes a bit of pep talking from Rob to get her to go back to high school.
As Josie starts high school again she meets a very attractive English
teacher, Sam, and this establishes the romantic part of this romantic comedy.
At the heart of Never Been Kissed is a story of finding oneself and second
chances.  We see this theme in Josie's story, but also in Rob's.  The story
is heartwarming and funny and will definitely appeal to many  especially
those who are currently in high school or about to enter high school.  This
is a film that falls squarely in the crowd-pleaser category and it succeeds
wildly at this.
Barrymore is so sweet in Never Been Kissed that it's hard to criticize her
performance.  Her performance is just fine in Never Been Kissed  though
sometimes a bit hokey, like early on in the film where she describes how
she's never really been kissed.  The performance that I liked the most is
David Arquette's.  Arquette gives an energetic performance as Josie's loser
brother who dreams of playing baseball in the majors.
Don't Miss Never Been Kissed in the theatres.  This is a film that will
make you all warm and fuzzy by the end of the film.  This film will also
have you leaving the theatre with a smile on your face and tears in your eyes.

 Drew Barrymore is beginning to corner the market on playing the girl
outside - the one who's the awkward klutz or the spunky do-it-yourselfer;
the one who just doesn't fit in with the others.
 She has perfected these characters in movies such as "The Wedding Singer"
and, most notably, "Ever After."
 Now she's back, starring in what could be called a modern-day Cinderella
fable - "Never Been Kissed."
 You know it's a fable because she plays a copy editor at a newspaper who
has her own office as well as a secretary. Trust me on this one, no copy
editor has seen the inside of a private office since Gutenberg (and I don't
mean Steve) invented the printing press.
 The premise is simple. Barrymore's Josie Geller, at 25 the youngest copy
editor ever to be hired by the Chicago Sun-Times, is assigned to go
undercover and return to high school to do an expose on what today's teens
are feeling and doing.
 Josie (she says she was named after the '70s cartoon character) was a geek
in high school, so she jumps at the opportunity for a second chance. This
time, she thinks, she will get it right and be accepted by the in-crowd.
 Now, what kind of adult  - with a good job and a successful career - would
actually look forward to reliving the hell that was - and is - high school
and adolescence.
 These are among the many problems that plague "Never Been Kissed."
Screenwriters Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein cannot get a handle of Josie.
Their script has her capriciously switching from confident adult to ditzy,
blubbering woman-child at the least provocation.
 And the fact that an adult would put so much stock into trying to become
tight with the vapid airheads who are supposedly South Glen High School's
most popular girls leads you to question her maturity and mental stability.
 OK, so "Never Been Kissed" is not a sociological expose of today's high
school scene. However, certain rules should apply to film, and one of those
is consistency of character.
 Among the movie's problems is the ill-conceived conceit that Josie would
seriously strive to climb the high school food chain and, in the process,
lose focus on her assignment.
 Any competent editor would have tossed her ass out the door quicker than
you could say "get me rewrite."
 To be fair, Barrymore is very appealing, but she is given very little to
work with. She tries valiantly to get a firm grip on her character, but the
script continually undermines her.
 Barrymore comes off best in the physical comedy aspects of the script in
which she tries to walk, talk and act like a cool, hip high schooler.
Otherwise, she is left foundering on a cliched sea of teen-age stereotypes
and situations.
 "Never Been Kissed" is entertaining and funny in fits and starts. It lacks
consistency and a firm grasp on what it wants to accomplish.
 The movie's main bright spot is provided by Leelee Sobieski as Aldys, the
outsider who befriends new student Josie. Josie sees a lot of her former
self in Aldys, yet still abandons her to hang out with the popular girls.
Real mature.
And that is the main deficiency with "Never Been Kissed." It's illogical,
unrealistic, uneven and undemanding.
 It has some warm and humorous spots, but not enough to overcome its many
obstacles.

Director: Raja Gosnell.
I guess there are those who have never been kissed before (a rare and
dying breed), except if you're child  in which case it would be called
experimenting. Rarer still are those who have never been kissed before
they reach the twenties. Hardest to believe still, is that Drew
Barrymore has never been kissed. Despite all these hard to believe tit
bits, there are people out there who have never truly been kissed, and
who are still waiting for that right person to give them the wet, sloppy
warm feeling of tongues intermingling, reassuring them that their search
for true love is over.
Well, this movie is about a girl waiting for the right boy to give her
the kiss of her life. And it's sweet. Drew Barrymore who shone in Ever
After' is wonderful as Josie, Grossy', the high school dweeb who becase
a professional editor, before being assigned by her paper to return to
school as an undercover reporter. It addresses the issues of how a
dweeb, becomes a prom Queen and finds the man of her life all in one
sitting. Hard to believe, but possible.
There may also be those who have been kissed before, but in fact, never
truly been given THE kiss. So this movie can be watched by those who are
waiting for true love or those who are still searching for it. Either
way, it is one enjoyable sit, with a fairytale ending.

The idea of a teenage comedy set in a high school has been used
extensively over the past few years. It seems we're also seeing a
pattern in the plot of these movies: a guy or girl is masquerading as
something they are not, they fall in love in the process, and then their
girlfriend or boyfriend finds out about the scheme they are pulling. It
happened in She's All That, it happened in 10 Things I Hate About You,
and now budging in line is Never Been Kissed.
Here, Drew Barrymore plays Josie Gellar, a young reporter for the
Chicago Sun Times. She's given the breakthrough opportunity of her
career: an undercover story about the lifestyle of today's teenagers.
This means that Josie must disguise herself as a 17-year old and go
behind enemy lines at a local high school to get the scoop. She must
elude the school geek (Leelee Sobieski) and become chums with the `in'
girls without hurting anyone's feelings. Ah, to be young again...
Barrymore has come a long way since her turbulent childhood, and has
proven herself to be a great young actress. Even as the film becomes
increasingly hard to swallow, Barrymore has the ability to sweep us off
our feet at any given time. I hardly believed a moment in Never Been
Kissed, but the film and it's stars are so unexpectedly charming and
sweet you will have to fight off the urge to smile.
There is one aspect of the story that is quite different. The main
character here has two alternatives for love. There's her kind English
teacher (Michael Vartan) or a hunky classmate (Jeremy Jordan) who both
have their respective eyes on Josie. Director Raja Gosnell decides to
take the easy route, tying up the loose ends in an unsurprising manner,
but the film's genuine charm still manages to catch you off guard during
the final scenes.
This also leaves room for a few key supporting players to shine. David
Arquette plays Josie's once popular brother, in a funny performance that
rings nicely true. John C. Reilly is her editor, and Garry Marshall
plays the big boss of the paper. The screenplay is about as lumpy as a
disastrous Thanksgiving gravy, but that's the least of your worries.
When you actually stop to think about the movie's plot, you may realize
how completely ludicrous it sounds. Never Been Kissed even ends with the
ultimate teen movie cliché: the Prom. How in the world the film develops
into a sheer delight I may never know, but the probable reason is the
young executive-producer and star. These are high times for Drew
Barrymore, and here she displays the charisma and magnetism that all
great Hollywood actresses possess. I hope the world is ready for Drew,
because she's making her move in high style.

"Never Been Kissed" (1999) - David Arquette, Drew Barrymore, Molly
Shannon...
        Drew Barrymore is well on her way to becoming the latest classic
American sweetheart with solid performances in "The Wedding Singer," "Ever
After," and now "Never Been Kissed." The latter movie, opening April 9,
was also produced by Barrymore, and her influence helps make this a solid
entry in the crowded teen-oriented movie market.
On the surface, "Never Been Kissed" has rich comic potential. Drew
Barrymore is Josie Geller, a quiet copy editor at the Chicago Sun-Times,
and her first assignment as a reporter is to go undercover - at high
school. The first time around, she was an awkward, braces-wearing ugly
duckling with the cruel nickname "Josie Gross-ie" and, as the title
suggests, she's never been kissed.
Between bad memories and being ten years out of touch with
contemporary culture, the myriad possibilities of a "fish out of water"
story are obvious. South Glen South H.S. has it all: the social elite
(three Valley Girls and their jock boyfriends), cliques, booze, drugs,
rock and roll. All of these are explored, leaving more than a few good
laughs in their wake.
The romance doesn't enter in until later, when Barrymore finds
herself falling for a Shakespeare teacher (Michael Vartan). In the proud
tradition of romance throughout literature and film, it's seemingly doomed
from square one: he thinks she's a student, and that's just not kosher in
these days of sexual harassment suits; and she can't tell him how she
really feels without blowing her cover.
"Never Been Kissed" takes the phrase `romantic comedy' to heart,
delivering plenty of both. Barrymore and Vartan don't actually share a
great deal of screen time, but they do share a good amount of on-screen
chemistry which makes the romance and their characters believeable.
Unlike many films in this genre, "Never Been Kissed" knows better
than to take itself too seriously. David Arquette steals more than a few
scenes in his improbable role as Barrymore's older brother, who also goes
back to high school in hopes of being noticed by a major league baseball
scout. Through a hidden camera, the rest of the Sun-Times staff watches
Barrymore's life like a soap opera. Even the closing credits are good for
a chuckle; the cast and crew are shown - using their high school yearbook
pictures, of course.
"Never Been Kissed" has plenty of laughs, a heartwarming love
story, and a hint of attitude - all the ingredients for a tasty romantic
comedy stew.

newspaper of Southeast Missouri State University.)

Running Time:  104 minutes.
Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.
     I'm willing to forgive NEVER BEEN KISSED many of its failings
because, for all practical purposes, it's a fantasy.  I can over look the
irony of a film about an adult returning to interact with teenagers which
portray teens the same inane way adults usually think of them.  I can let
it slide that the tone is terminally bubbly when a touch of venom might
have helped.  I can even shrug my shoulders at the notion that Drew
Barrymore was ever a spat-upon teen wretch.  Sometimes a romantic comedy
can get away with being ridiculous as it strives to pull us into its wish
fulfillment.  What it can't get away with is being lazy or being miscast,
the two blunders that insure NEVER BEEN KISSED never had a chance.
     Our high-concept premise finds 25-year-old Chicago Sun-Times copy
editor Josie Geller (Barrymore) offered her first real reporting
assignment:  going undercover as a high school student.  The assignment
brings mixed emotions for Josie, a brainy high school outcast still
smarting from her adolescent ostracism.  As she begins her quest for a
story, Josie finds herself drawn back into the world of the "smart kids"
at South Glen South High School, including her new friend Aldys (Leelee
Sobieski).  That's before her editor (John C. Reilly) demands that Josie
get in with the in crowd, and before Josie's arrested adolescent
23-year-old brother Rob (David Arquette) also re-enrolls and helps turn
the one-time "Josie Grossie" into a potential prom queen.
     NEVER BEEN KISSED does a serviceable job of telling Josie's story,
exploring how a woman comes to terms with the person she was and is.  If
only the script had shown as much dilligence with the other elements.
Arquette's character is potentially even more interesting than Barrymore's
-- a jock who peaked at 18 trying to re-live his glory days -- but it's
generally watered-down and ignored.  The romantic angle between Josie and
her English teacher (Michael Vartan) is half-heartedly developed, muddles
the entire point of the story -- are we supposed to believe that Josie was
incapable of finding true love before re-creating her traumatic youth? --
and builds to a spectacularly clumsy conclusion.  Most depressing of all
is a ghastly device which finds Josie wearing a miniature camera,
contributing nothing more to the story than pointless cutaways to Josie's
co-workers gaping or cringing in embarrassment.
     There's plenty to gape and cringe at as Barrymore plays Josie.
You've got to admire how gamely Barrymore subjects herself to humiliating
situations, but she's all wrong for the lead role in her first feature as
executive producer.  Even the marketing people at Fox realize that she's
most appealing as a sweet object of desire, making the central image in
the film's publicity a photo of Barrymore smiling coquettishly with knee
drawn up to her chest.  As a star carrying this film, she looks out of her
depth.  It's slightly embarrassing watching her play the professional
Josie as a tightly-coiffed fussbudget correcting everyone's grammar and
usage; as implausible as she may be as a high school senior, she proves
even more implausible as a grown-up.
     You always want to like a film as good-natured as NEVER BEEN KISSED,
even though it wants so much to be liked.  There simply isn't a nuance to
the material that director Raja Gosnell manages to capture, not a moment
of sincere emotion, nothing that doesn't look like it wouldn't exist if
not for other movies about kids in high school.  When the script manages
to work in a wise observation -- like the idea that one popular person in
high school can dictate who's cool and who's not -- it feels like someone
tripped over it accidentally.  NEVER BEEN KISSED is most certainly a
fantasy for anyone who ever felt like the quintessential high school
outsider, but the film-makers are living in a fantasy world if they think
that's all they need to deliver.

_Never_Been_Kissed_ (PG-13) *** (out of ****)
The makers of _Never_Been_Kissed_ expect the audience to buy a number of
hard-to-swallow contrivances:
        3)  Co-star David Arquette plays Barrymore's _younger_ brother.
Yet not only do we swallow all this, we eat it up.  And that's because of
the considerable talents of Barrymore.  As I mentioned, it's a stretch to
have this glam gal play a dork.  But the gifted Barrymore is up to the task
as Josie Geller, a lonely 25-year-old copy editor at the
_Chicago_Sun-Times_ whose first job as a reporter is to go undercover in a
high school and find a story.  Not only does this present Josie with the
opportunity to pursue her dream career but a chance to erase her miserable
memories of high school, where her less-than-popular ways earned her
unflattering nickname of "Josie Grossie."  It's hard to imagine Barrymore
being remotely considered gross, but she entirely convinces in both the
flashback scenes where she sports stringy brown hair, pimply makeup, and
braces; and as the better-groomed but still frumpy--with the attitude to
match--Josie.  The character's nerdiness also gives Barrymore the chance to
display a heretofore unseen flair for light physical comedy.
The script by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein is nothing if not formulaic.
In addition to the predictable touchstones of Josie's predictable personal
and professional redemption, the wacky younger sibling (Arquette's Rob),
and the nerdy student (Leelee Sobieski) with whom Josie identifies while
undercover, there's also her dream of finding romance with a guy--or, at
the very least, a "real" kiss (hence the film's title).  When young,
intelligent literature teacher Sam Coulson (Michael Vartan) enters the
scene, there's no mistaking how everything will eventually turn out.  But
by the film's climax, I was surprised at how invested I was in Josie and
her dream, due in no small part to Barrymore's natural rapport with the
audience.  So likable is she that we're willing to overlook the somewhat
discomfiting fact that Sam would be attracted to someone he believes to be
his student.
But Barrymore is not the only person onscreen who makes an impression;
there are some colorful supporting performances by Arquette (even if he in
no way looks like he could be younger than Barrymore), Molly Shannon (as
Josie's libidinous co-worker), and John C. Reilly (as Josie's boss).  That
said, there is no doubt that _Never_Been_Kissed_ belongs to Barrymore and
that if it weren't for her delightful presence, the film would not be, to
paraphrase the tagline, "a thing worth waiting for."  (opens April 9)

     They are: SHE'S ALL THAT, 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU, and now,
NEVER BEEN KISSED.  All treading some familiar ground: high school
sucks.
     Maybe I can relate, and NEVER BEEN KISSED is certainly the best of
three, but really, if I have to sit through this story line one more
time, well, I'm liable to spike the punch the next time out, just to see
what happens.
     KISSED starts pretty incredulously: we are supposed to believe that
Drew Barrymore is a copy editor at the Chicago Sun-Times.  No, that's
not the stretch:  The jaw-dropper is that she has both an office *and*
an assistant!  If you're not in the publishing biz, let me say that
that's about as crazy as Drew Barrymore being the executive producer of
a feature film.  (Uh, wait a second.)
     So here we have a lovable, 25 year-old, copy-editing virgin named
Josie (Barrymore), who is sent--"undercover"--back to high school in
order to get the hot story about today's youth.  Sadly, Josie is a
big-ass loser whose personal freakshow is the best story going.  She's
alienated by the cool crowd, and only when her genuinely cool (but dim)
brother (Arquette) comes to the rescue, is she able to become Miss
Popular (and prom queen to boot).  Never mind also dropping 20 pounds
and getting a decent haircut and some fashion sense.
     There's also a subplot about Josie's somewhat creepy
would-be-affair with teacher Sam (Vartan), but ultimately it's KISSED's
frequent, unapologetic jokes and good-natured fun that redeem it above
its competition.  It may be the same old story, but at least it isn't
completely mindless.

There's something about Drew Barrymore that brings out the big brother in 
me. I'm not sure whether it's her genuinely sweet nature, the way she 
emerged triumphant from a rocky adolescence, or just some residual "E.T." 
magic, but the notion of criticizing such a charming young performer 
makes me uncomfortable. It should be obvious by this point that I'm going 
to do so anyway, but hopefully the preceding remarks will at least 
establish that I'm not happy about it.
"Never Been Kissed" is a lousy movie. The premise, while far from 
original, is serviceable enough. A fledgling reporter masquerades as a 
high school student to do a story on the youth of today. Several years 
earlier she suffered great pain as an outcast in school, and the 
assignment affords her the golden opportunity for a second chance. This 
time she'll get it right.
She doesn't, of course, and neither does the movie. The filmmakers behind 
"Never Been Kissed" apparently believe that as long as they provide a 
fuzzy-wuzzy romantic finale, it makes no difference how they get there. 
The movie makes virtually every mistake in the book, including flagrantly 
violating the moral of their own story. 
"Find out who you are and try not to be afraid of it," our 25 year old 
heroine nobly proclaims late in the film. This inspirational statement 
comes from a person who pretends to be someone she isn't and tries to 
insinuate herself with the vacuous school elite through patently phony 
affectations. She fails, only to be rescued when her 23 year old brother 
joins the charade and also re-enrolls, becoming an instant hit by downing 
a tub of cole slaw in the cafeteria, then bestowing his sister with 
popularity by telling the in-crowd how cool she is. Right.
Drew Barrymore was delightful in "The Wedding Singer," "Ever After" and 
even "Home Fries," but turns in a terribly strained performance here. As 
anal-retentive copy editor turned hapless reporter Josie Geller, she 
whines, winces and crinkles her eyes continuously, desperately trying to 
wring some pathos out of her poorly written character. In one of the 
worst cases of miscasting in years, she plays a high school loser who 
grew into a mousy adult. Buried under bad make-up, she is quite 
embarrassing but never convincing.
As a reporter, her character is even worse. We're expected to believe 
that a professional, whose job is to check facts, would fail to research 
teen fashion, instead showing up at school dressed like a go-go dancer 
from the '60s. We're expected to believe that a reporter would sit down 
with students she has just met and ask "What are you guys' hopes and 
dreams?" Nothing Josie Geller says or does is even remotely credible, 
especially her idiotic romantic gesture at the film's climax; an exercise 
in public humiliation that no human on Earth would subject themselves to 
in a million years, except in the wonderful world of contrived movies.
The awfulness doesn't stop with Barrymore. John C. Reilly, Mark 
Wahlberg's pornstar-pal in "Boogie Nights," is flat-out dreadful as 
Josie's boss, doing a wretched imitation of Lou Grant. Garry Marshall 
chews scenery as a management tyrant, and young Leelee Sobieski (the 
talented actor from "Deep Impact" who looks like Helen Hunt Jr.) has far 
too much innate poise and dignity to pull off her role as a contemporary 
high school geek.
About 40 minutes into the film, screenwriters Abby Kohn and Marc 
Silverstein make matters even more annoying by slapping a hidden micro-
camera onto Josie, subjecting us to pointless "Truman Show" style 
reaction shots of Chicago Sun-Times staff members (get this) sitting 
around the office for hours and hours watching the monitor, enraptured by 
Josie's pratfalls and her quasi-romantic relationship with a teacher 
(Michael Vartan, an anemic-looking fellow inexplicably presented as a 
dreamboat). I can hardly wait to read what Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger 
Ebert has to say about how the film depicts the inner-workings of his 
newspaper.
There are a few bright spots in the production. Molly Shannon makes the 
most of her supporting role, particularly in an amusing scene where she 
pretends to be a sex-education teacher, and the always goofy David 
Arquette, despite looking too old to play Barrymore's younger brother, 
projects an odd giddiness that is fun to watch. In fact, his character, a 
lost young man who views the high-school re-enrollment facade as a last 
chance to realize his dream of becoming a ballplayer, is far more 
interesting and engaging than Josie.   
Subjecting an innocuous trifle like "Never Been Kissed" to so much 
bashing may seem excessive, but when hack filmmakers steal 107 minutes of 
my life, they deserve what they get. As for Drew Barrymore, hopefully 
she'll take a good look at this bad flick and be more selective when 
accepting future roles. She deserves better than this and so do we.

NEVER BEEN KISSED by DeWyNGaLe    Rating: A
http://members.aol.com/DeWyNGaLe
Drew Barrymore has come a long, long way in her life.  Her parents were very
famous actors, and they were well known for classic movies.  At first, Drew
Barrymore seemed like she wasn't going to go anywhere with her career in
acting.  In my opinion, her breakthrough movie was 1996's Scream (A+), where
she played a small role, but also a great role.  Next Drew went on to co star
with Adam Sandler in 1998's the Wedding Singer (B+), where she was good but
didn't get the chance to show off her skills.  Later on in 1998, with Ever
After (A-), Drew was almost able to carry the movie by herself, but not without
help from Angelica Huston.  Now, in Never Been Kissed, Drew has gotten the
opportunity to show off her stuff.  After coming through a hard childhood, Drew
has finally gotten the title of "great actress" in my opinion.
In Never Been Kissed, Drew stars as Josie Gellar, a journalist at the Chicago
Sun Times.  At the Chicago Sun Times, things are a little slow, and they need a
really good story.  Josie is picked to do the story, and she is now a reporter.
 The task is a hard but fun one- Josie must enroll in high school to study
today's teenagers and schools in America.  There is only one pressure holding
Josie back from the job.  When Josie was in high school, she was the class
outcast, and she had the nickname "Josie Grossie."  She barely had any friends
at all, but she held on to become successful after high school.
Josie decides to take her chances.  On the first day of school, everything goes
horrible.  She makes a fool of herself in front of everyone, including the
popular people who remind her of some people back when she was in high school. 
Everyone finds her to be very strange the first day, so she must try harder to
be a teen again.  Josie's brother Rob, played by David Arquette, is a worker at
the Tiki Post, a place for office supplies.  He realizes that this story is
very important to her, and he must help her out.  He enrolls in high school to
help Josie, and also plans to fulfil his dreams of playing baseball in college.
 Rob becomes popular instantly, and he knows that if he puts the good word in
for Josie, they will accept her as well.
Never Been Kissed may not highly original, but Drew Barrymore, who also
produces the film, did such a wonderful job as Josie Gellar.  She created one
of the most likable characters I have ever seen in a movie.  Drew is funny as
Josie, and is also very emotional and realistic.  On the other hand, Kirsten,
Gibby, and Kristen, who are the mean, popular girls played by Jessica Alba,
Jordan Ladd, and Marley Shelton do a good job as well, but characters are very
unlikable.  A performance which was surprisingly strong was that of Leelee
Sobieski's as Aldys, a girl who becomes friends with Josie at the high school.
In many films today, sub-plots are what ruin many of them.  That's not the case
in Never Been Kissed.  There are quite a few sub-plots containing plots similar
to Message In A Bottle, EDTV, and even Carrie.  Molly Shannon, who is involved
in one of the sub-plots, is very funny as Anita, a worker at the Chicago Sun
Times.
On the trailers, it looked like Never Been Kissed would be a laugh riot, but it
was so much more than that.  It was very funny, but also inspirational, sad,
and meaningful.  There are so many unexpected elements in the movie, and that's
what makes it fun all the way through.  The scenes that were supposed to make
you laugh made you crack up, and the scenes that were supposed to make you
think made you really think.  It is very rare a film does either one of these,
but Never Been Kissed certainly succeeded.

PLANET SICK-BOY:  http://www.sick-boy.com
The tagline says that `Some things are worth waiting for.'  This sure
ain't one of them.  Drew Barrymore (Ever After) stars as Josie Gellar,
the youngest copy editor in the storied history of the Chicago
Sun-Times.  (Do you think that makes Roger Ebert hate the film more or
less?)  She's meticulously uptight and loves the sentimentality of your
typical Hallmark card.  In other words, a mousy brown-haired virgin.
Although she longs to one day be an undercover reporter, her superior
Gus (John C. Reilly, Boogie Nights) pays no attention to Josie.  That
is, until the day the Times' nut-job editor-in-chief (Garry Marshall),
who is tired of getting scooped, assigns a surprised but exuberant Josie
to work undercover at South Glen South, a local high school.  Now, mind
you, there isn't any particular story he wants unmasked.  She's just
supposed to stumble onto something earth-shattering that will boost
paper sales.
Now, if I had a nickel for every time I heard some schlub say, `If I
could go back to high school now, knowing what I know, my whole life
would be different  tee-hee-hee.'  Sure it would.  The closest these
people come to doing something about their personal schooling horrors is
to relive it vicariously through Johnny Depp on 21 Jump Street.  It's
sort of like saying `Jeez, if I knew that eating a box of Twinkies every
day would make my ass-shadow eclipse Cleveland, I never would have
started  tee-hee-hee.'
Josie is just like these out-of-touch wonders.  Even though she was a
zitty geek (nickname: `Josie Grossie'), she looks forward to getting
another stab at being popular.  The newspaper rigs her with a hidden
camera, with all images being transmitted back to Gus, who apparently
has nothing better to do all day than watch his reporter's exploits,
hereafter dubbed `The All-Humiliation Network' due to Josie's uncanny
knack of not being able to fit in.  In fact, she's forced to befriend
the lowest of the low (according to the 1999 edition of The High School
Food Chain)  the math club and their leader (a brilliant Leelee
Sobieski, A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries).
Things take an odd but expected twist when Josie's brother Rob (David
Arquette, Ravenous) also enrolls at South Glen South.  Why?  Because he
apparently blew his shot at a big baseball scholarship when he came down
with mono before the most important game in his high school career.  His
instant popularity jettisons the homely Josie into the ranks of the
school's social elite and even nets her the welcome advances of the
skinny-cool-sensitive guy who plays guitar.  When I was in high school,
guys like this got beat up.  Now, I guess they're popular.
Throw in the predictable romance with her English teacher (Michael
Vartan, The Curve, who weaves in references to the whole `All the
world's a stage' thing from Shakespeare's As You Like It), as well as
the big prom finale (which is actually a competition with rival high
school East Glen East, natch) and you know you're just minutes away from
a gem of a line like `I've waited my whole life to fit inand now, I
finally do!'  Sit down and shut up.  You're not really fitting in.  It's
a sham of a mockery of a travesty of a sham.  And I think she wore the
same dress to the prom that she wore in Ever After.  Talk about your
fashion faux pas!  It's a good thing Joan Rivers wasn't covering that
event.
Barrymore is actually becoming quite the deft physical comedienne,
unafraid to make herself look unsightly for effect.  But her performance
isn't enough to overcome even one of the other problems with Never Been
Kissed, which was directed by John Hughes understudy Raja Gosnell (Home
Alone 3)  who apparently didn't study enough.  But if you go, make sure
you stay for the closing credits because they show school pictures of
the whole cast and crew.  (1:47  PG-13 for mild language, sex talk and
implied drug use)

Molly Shannon, and Octavia Spencer
     Theory on Film: As the year goes on, the number of bad films
progressively gets smaller.  The chances that a bad sounding will be good
increase, and the chances that a good sounding film will be bad decrease.
This only applies during the non-summer months.  During the summer months,
anything that will make money is put onto the table, and thus my thesis is
null and void during that time period.
     Now it is April.  The movies that I have groaned at the previews of
(i.e. The Wachowski Brothers' The Matrix) end up being ten to twenty times
better than I expect.  Scratch that.  Remembering my algebra, a negative
number times a positive number is still negative.  Hence the movies are
better than I expected by being good at all.
     Never Been Kissed is a classic example.  After watching the terrible
duo of Ever After and The Wedding Singer, the last two films with her in
them that I have seen, I have been tempted to find the girl from ET and do
to her what was done to her in Scream.   So, when Never Been Kissed came
around, I expected to see a terrible film that I would have more fun
perfecting my crackpot aim with the light weight missile weapon known as the
popcorn kernel - a much harder object to hurl than is displayed in the
movies.
     What I found instead was a popcorn film plot with two very gifted
writers and an excellent performance by someone who hasn't given an
excellent performance in three years.  Basically, Never Been Kissed follows
Josie Gellar (Drew Barrymore), a 25-year-old copy editor for the Chicago Sun
Times.   For those not familiar with the newspaper world, that roughly
translates as 30 Grand a year and no respect.
     Josie is fairly unattractive, loves correct grammar and women's
business suits (her constant correcting of incorrect grammar is the perfect
touch put in by writer Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein).  Oh, yeah, she's a
virgin who has never been kissed.  Well, she's been kissed, but not with the
kind of magic that we find more in movies than in life.  Another nod to the
writers: she describes the first kiss in such terms as would put Juliet on
the balcony to shame.
     By some miracle of her psychotic editor-in-chief, Josie is sent as an
undercover reported into the midst of the den of lions known as High School.
Her goal: to find out about kids today.  Of course, since she was nicknamed
Josie Grosie when she really went to high school, things don't go too well
for her.  Her only friends are Cynthia (Octavia Spencer), a member of a
Calculus team known as "The Denominators", and her English teacher Sam
Coulson (Michael Vartan).  Formula to the core, we all know that she falls
in love with the teacher.
     The funny thing about the movie is that it has humor on both levels.
For the teeny-boppers who go see it thinking that it will be a "cool" film,
they won't be disappointed: a great soundtrack, Drew Barrymore, David
Arquette (as Drew's younger brother) and a bunch of immature humor will tide
them over.  For the rest of us, the geeks, the twentysomethings who have
finally realized what a charade High School was, people with an IQ over 120,
you are treated with wonderful tidbits of humor such as the Calc team
getting pi slightly wrong and the Shakespeare class quote from Henry VI
instead of As You Like It, the subject of the class.
     The performance by Barrymore actually shows that talent may be genetic
(her father was a terrific actor), because she actually makes me care about
a character, something that I normally do the exact opposite of.
     Her basically pitiful High School experiences contrasted with her
current (and eventually very successful) experiences are shown through a
well done series of flashbacks (the director takes care to overlight and use
grainy films in the flashback scenes, to give it the 80s look it deserves),
and we actually get to see Drew Barrymore, a girl stalked since 5 by some
person or another, successfully act very unpopular.  She has braces, she has
greasy hair, and she wears nothing but sweaters.
     It's not a film that lives in the box.  Instead, it lives in two boxes
simultaneously.  One box is the "oh-that's-so-sweet" High School audience,
it's target, and the other is the twentysomethings who may truly enjoy it.
So, if you fall into either category a or b, see the film.

>From E.T. to THE WEDDING SINGER, Drew Barrymore always seems to
shine. That is probably the main reason why she was chosen to play the
lead role in Raja Gosnell's NEVER BEEN KISSED. Barrymore turns in a
fine comic performance and steals the show from a spectacular
supporting cast, proving that she deserves to play the protagonist
more often. It's too bad that Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein couldn't
give her a better script to work with, because NEVER BEEN KISSED ends
up playing out as nothing more than contrived fun
Barrymore plays Josie Geller, a copy editor for the Chicago Sun-Times
who is picked to do her first piece as a reporter. She must go back to
high school and write a story about any specific problem she finds
within it. But her brother, Rob(David Arquette), reminds her of just
how bad her high school years were. She wore huge braces, never washed
her hair, was asked out to the prom as a joke, and was called "Josie
Grossie."  But she still decides to give high school a second
shot. But instead of hanging out with the kids who cause trouble worth
writing about, she befriends a nerdy mathematician(Leelee Sobieski)
and crushes on her English teacher(Michael Vartan).  When her
boss(John C. Reilly) demands that she somehow become popular so that
she can get her story, her brother enrolls in the school, becomes
popular in a day, and starts to hint to people that Josie does have a
cooler side.
NEVER BEEN KISSED has some very funny scenes(the prom theme is "Great
Couples in History" and two people dress up as the Doctor and Gonzo
from FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS), but the story seems forced, as
if a Fox executive demanded that the writers find some way to combine
Drew Barrymore with high school, so that everyone in the world will
want to see it. As I wrote earlier, Barrymore makes a great leading
lady, and makes it seem that the top-notch supporting cast was wasted.
But even a charming Drew can't change the fact that NEVER BEEN KISSED
is predictable and insignificant. But if you end up seeing the film,
stay for the credits, where every actor and crew member's high school
photo is shown.

Never Been Kissed
Reviewed by Eugene Novikov
http://www.ultimate-movie.com/neverbeenkissed.html
Member: Online Film Critics Society
Starring Drew Barrymore, David Arquette, Molly Shannon, Michael Vartan. Rated
PG-13
The first line of Never Been Kissed is "You know how some movies have these
dream sequences but they don't tell you it's a dream? Well, this is so not a
dream." If you examine those two sentences closely, you'll notice that they
don't really make sense. However, they made me sit up in my chair and really
pay attention, because those two sentences when placed at the beginning of a
film are somehow appealing, unusual, almost like a dream. This very well
describes the movie that follows those words. Wasting no time, we are
introduced to Josie Geller, a shy young copy editor for the Chicago
Sun-Times, who prides herself in her neatness and precision and who feels it
necessary to correct everyone else's grammar usage errors. She's a young,
small-time employee, who seems to be waiting for her big break as a reporter.
That break comes at a company meeting where her boss (played with hilarious
gusto by Garry Marshall) gives her an undercover assignment -- she is to
enroll in high school and investigate what the cool people of the 90's like
to do.
This is both delightful and depressing to Josie. She is overjoyed at her big
opportunity as an undercover reporter. But high-school also brings back
excruciating memories. She was the queen of geeks back then. The whole school
would mock her shouting "Josie Grosie!". She was invited to the prom by the
guy that she adored, only to be devastated when, on prom night, she finds out
it was a joke and gets pummeled with raw eggs as she is standing outside her
house in a dress waiting for her date.
So, you can imagine how it would be difficult for Josie to go back to all
those memories and attempt to fit in among teenagers, again. But go to
high-school she does, wearing a ridiculous outfit, being mocked, spit on and
rejected. She has no success among the "in" crowd, which is her assignment,
until her 23-year old cool brother (David Arquette) also enrolls in high
school and literally tells everyone to like her.
The idea, as well as the film itself, is completely implausible. It is
unconceivable that in this day and age, two twenty-year olds would be able to
enroll in a high school, without having their age revealed or at least
without generating some suspicion. It is also ridiculous that there could be
stories in the Sun-Times telling about an undercover reporter at that high
school, and not have anyone snoop around to find out who the person is. But
in this particular film, it hardly seems to matter. You see, Never Been
Kissed plays out almost like a surrealistic fantasy. Time flies when watching
it, and one feels almost as if he is in a dream.
The movie is ridden with cliches, but since nothing we see on the screen
seems real (in a good way), those cliches are there exclusively to make a
point. And the film's point is a nostalgic one; it seems to be saying that
people come and go, but school does not fundamentally change. The same kinds
of people will be there time and again, and what really matters what breed
you choose to fit into, what games you choose to play.
Drew Barrymore gives a charming performance in an interesting exploration of
what might happen if a girl gets a second chance at being young. She has a
big part in a little movie, making it twice as important for her to come
through, and she does. We are with her character every step of the way, and
we absorb and understand every dilemma that faces her.
Director Raja Gosnell, who made his directing debut almost two years ago, with
the digestible Home Alone 3, completely triumphs with this graceful,
entertaining, smart teen comedy/adult fantasy. It's not only funny, it's also
profound, touching and relatively subtle. Never Been Kissed blows a glaring
opportunity at the very end to really make its point heard, but I was too
delighted with the last two hours to complain.

NEVER BEEN KISSED (PG).  
(Twentieth Century Fox)
Director: Raja Gosnell
Stars: Drew Barrymore, David Arquette, Michael Vartan, Leelee
Sobieski, Jeremy Jordan, John C Reilly, Molly Shannon, Garry Marshall,
Jessica Alba, Marley Shelton, Jordan Ladd, James Edward Franco,
Branden Williams
Running time: 107 minutes.
Chicago reporter Josie Geller (Drew Barrymore) returns to high
school on an undercover assignment to report about modern adolescents.
In her high school days, Josie was a geek with an uncool dress sense
and braces, and was the butt of many cruel practical jokes.  In short,
her school years were a nightmare, and she is not exactly keen on
repeating it.  But in returning to school and trying to fit in again,
the 25 year old misfit eventually finds herself and true love.
Never Been Kissed features the usual cliches of the typical
American high school comedy - the cliques, the nerds and the jocks,
the outcasts, the bitchy politics, and the climactic prom night - and
explores territory that will be familiar to audiences through a recent
spate of adolescent comedies (She's All That, Jawbreaker, Ten Things I
Hate About You, etc), albeit without the mean spirited streak.  Never
Been Kissed also owes a huge debt to the films of John Hughes, which
virtually established the teen genre for the '80's.
However, the formula has also been cleverly dressed in the
familiar trappings of the romantic comedy, as the clueless Josie
discovers the pangs of first love.  First time writers Abby Kohn and
Marc Silverstein have drawn upon their own experiences at high school
for much of the material, which adds a more personal element to some
of the action.  The pair draw out some underlying sexual tension in
the growing attraction between Josie and handsome English teacher Sam
Coulson (Michael Vartan, from The Myth Of Fingerprints, etc).
Coulson's lectures on Shakespeare's As You Like It, and its themes of
masks and deception, underscore one of the principal themes of this
surprisingly entertaining and charming comedy.
Former editor Raja Gosnell, who made his directorial debut on
the formula-driven sequel Home Alone 3, is able to leave more of a
personal impression on this material.
         Barrymore is not a conventional beauty, but the former wild
child has recently reinvented herself as a romantic lead with films
such as Ever After, the contemporary flavoured reworking of
Cinderella.  Barrymore's willingness to play the awkward geek in
several scenes also adds a touching element to the film that works a
treat, and her enthusiastic performance lifts the film.  She is well
supported by Leelee Sobieski (Deep Impact, etc), Vartan, and former
pin up idol Jeremy Jordan, who plays the school hunk.  David Arquette
provides the comic relief as Josie's brother Rob, the former jock and
high school drop out, who reluctantly returns to school to help boost
her popularity.  Unlike some recent romantic comedies, Never Been
Kissed actually manages to offer a perfectly satisfying conclusion
that will have audiences leaving the cinema smiling.

Drew Barrymore is a lonely, 25 year old, copy editor for the Chicago
Suntimes. When a sudden firing leaves an undercover reporting job open, her
psycho chief editor impulsively promotes her to the task of impersonating a
17 year old student at Glen South High.
Barrymore is so giddy about playing undercover that she forgets what a
nightmare her own high school experience was. In her naivetZ, she also
neglects to sniff out a spicy hot story with which to quench her fuming
editor.
This is a sappy movie. It knows it is and it doesn't try to hide that fact.
It's also not without implausibilities and moments of bad acting (due in a
large part to her handsome teacher/ love interest). But it's fun. It's silly
teenage "Revenge of the Nerds" fun. And it's spirited. Barrymore's vitality
just won't let you write off this corny picture. She's adorable, charming
and so is her performance as the girl who gets to do high school all over
again.
Starring Drew Barrymore and David Arquette.
Directed by Raja Gosnell.
Produced by Sandy Isaac and Nancy Juvonen at Fox 2000 Pictures.
Rated PG-13.

Never Been Kissed is a film about second chances.  Similar in ways to
Peggy Sue Got Married, the film gives its lead character a chance to
relive her not-so-glorious days of high school (albeit without the  time
travel twist).  Never Been Kissed is fluff...but it's likable fluff.
The hopelessly geeky Josie Geller (Drew Barrymore) has become the
youngest copy editor at the Chicago Sun-Times, and is assigned her first
undercover reporting assignment:  to go back to high school, and gain an
understanding of kids today.  An easy assignment, or so it seems, until
Josie finds herself reliving her tormented high school past.
Spurned by the popular set, Josie finds refuge with a friendly girl,
Aldys (Leelee Sobieski) and her nerd clique, the Denominators. But she
still desperately longs to be popular, and to be noticed by the cute,
popular guy, Guy (Jeremy Jordan), or her cute English teacher Sam
(Michael Vartan).
Josie's primary confidante is her slacker brother, Rob (David Arquette).
Cheated out of a baseball scholarship by an ill-timed attack of mono,
Rob now spends his life working at a Hawaiian-themed copy shop. But,
inspired by Josie, he sees an opportunity for a second chance. He, too,
returns to high school with the hopes of being spotted by a minor league
baseball scout.
None of this is breathtaking stuff, nor does it try to be.  Never Been
Kissed sets its sights on being slight and enjoyable, and there it
succeeds.  It has a little romance, some nostalgia, and plenty of wish
fulfillment to round out the corners.
Drew Barrymore surprisingly does quite well in the role of a hopeless
geek, and David Arquette is appropriately humorous as her brother.  Both
are able to carry the film through its sluggish spots.  The film sets up
a romantic triangle (between Barrymore, Jordan and Vartan), but then
fails to follow through...likely because one of the arms is much
stronger than the other.
The biggest letdown of the movie is the supporting cast at the Chicago
Sun-Times (including Molly Shannon, Garry Marshall and John C. Reilly).
Most of their jokes just don't pay off. Luckily, when Josie gets back to
high school, the cast there shines.  Leelee Sobieski, in particular,
does an outstanding job as the nerd determined to carve her own path.
Never Been Kissed is never that deep, meaningful or even very
believable.  However, as light entertainment it certainly makes the
grade.

Susan Granger's review of "NEVER BEEN KISSED" (20th Century-Fox)
 How deep are your teenage emotional scars? Anyone who has
ever experienced an awkward, horrible humiliation in high school will
relate to Drew Barrymore's dilemma as she is forced to negotiate the
social and emotional land mines of adolescence - not once but
twice. As mousy, 25 year-old Josie Geller, an incurable romantic and
the youngest copy editor at the "Chicago Sun Times," she's assigned to
go undercover to report on today's teenagers.  But Josie was a brainy
nerd in high school, a gawky geek to the core, nicknamed "Josie
Grossie," and her re-visit promises to be a repeat. "All I wanted was
to be accepted, and they just tortured me," she wails to her younger
brother (David Arquette), a self-styled "loser," who decides to lend
support, catapulting her from "outcast" to "instant popularity."  And,
of course, she finds romance with an English literature teacher
(Michael Vartan) who finds himself uncomfortably attracted to one of
his "students." Drew Barrymore has a dazzling comic flair; her saucy
performance is hilarious. One of the newer trends in the motion
picture business is targeting a specific audience - in this case,
teenage girls, who are all to familiar with the cattiness, cruelty,
and clique-mentality. This romantic comedy has all the hallmarks of
vintage John Hughes - think "Pretty in Pink" and "Sixteen Candles" -
as director Raja Gosnell coaxes freshness out of Abby Kohn and Marc
Silverstein's formulaic script, which delivers the message: "Find out
who you are and try not to be afraid of it." On the Granger Movie
Gauge of 1 to 10, "Never Been Kissed" is a lively if sophomoric 7 -
but, for its target audience, it's a captivating, totally cool teenage
chick's flick.

NEVER BEEN KISSED should be dedicated to all of you who've had
nightmares of having to return to high school.  Drew Barrymore, in one
of the best performances of her career, stars as Josie Geller, a
25-year-old "Chicago Sun Times" copy editor and would-be reporter.
Josie is proud of her current job in which she has a private office and
all the office supplies she can use, but she desperately desires to be a
reporter.
The newsroom nerd, who feels compelled to correct everyone's grammar,
especially that of her boss, played by John C. Reilly, Josie is willing
to put her job on the line to go undercover in high school.  The paper's
owner, played with noisy bluster by Garry Marshall, fires people if they
don't deliver.
As directed by Raja Gosnell and written by Abby Kohn and Marc
Silverstein, the story charms us with its intelligent humor.  The
comedic dialog works along with the physical comedy, and they even
manage to make the clichéd sex education class scene funny again.
Josie was one of those girls for whom high school was a living hell.
Mocked as "Josie Grossie" and physically taunted in the halls, she
barely survived the reign of terror.  Now she is heading back into the
flames of Hell, all in the quest for a story.
The beauty of Barrymore's performance is in how bad she's willing to let
herself look.  As a copy editor, she wears some of the dowdiest dresses
possible and is made up like a 25-year-old trying to look twice her age
for some amateur play.  In the frequent flashbacks to her old high
school, we see how bad it was for the klutzy but smart Josie and how
awful Barrymore is willing to appear.  With braces, a pockmarked and
pudgy face and tacky clothing, she looks so pathetic that it's easy to
empathize with her -- she looks like the girl that no one would ask for
a date.  Although the story has nary a serious moment, there is plenty
of social commentary just below the surface.
As an investigative reporter, Josie's euphoria quickly turns to fear.
It is only the school nerds called "The Denominators" and led by Aldys
(Leelee Sobieski from DEEP IMPACT), who are willing to adopt her.  The
beautiful people want nothing to do with her, and her first proposal for
a story -- an exposé of bad cafeteria food -- is turned down flat by her
paper.  Only the arrival of her savvy brother Rob, played in a boyishly
charming performance by David Arquette, saves the day.  Undercover
himself, he joins the in-crowd in a single day by becoming the "Cold
Slaw King of the World" in an eating contest with a big jock.  Once on
the inside, he plants positive rumors about Josie without admitting that
she is his sister,
Barrymore shows us parts of her acting ability that we've not seen
before.  One of the funniest scenes occurs when she does an impromptu
dance on stage after eating a drug-laced brownie.  Basically, Barrymore
just lets it all hang out, while delivering a real crowd-pleasing
performance throughout this scene and all the rest of the movie.
So what seals Josie's fate as a certified member of the popular group?
Why, choosing just the right theme for the school's prom -- the school
aggressively competes each year for the city's best prom, and this year
someone stole their original choice of "The Millenium."  Some of the
costumes worn using Josie's theme are really inspired, none more so than
that of her brother.  The film's ending is so hokey that it becomes
almost a parody, but Barrymore's innocent charisma gives its such grace
that it becomes a perfect cap to a precious movie.
NEVER BEEN KISSED runs 1:47.  It is rated PG-13 for sexual humor and
some profanity and would be fine for kids around 12 and up.

In the last two years, Drew Barrymore has been one of the most 
delightful and winning presences in all of her films, playing 
strong-willed, but innocent and kind souls ("The Wedding Singer," "Ever 
After," "Home Fries"). Her reign as America's cutest, cuddliest young 
actress working today continues in her latest film, "Never Been Kissed," 
which is also her production company, Flower Films' debut film 
(Barrymore also produces). Unfortunately, "Never Been Kissed" is also 
yet another high school movie (one comes every week, it seems), and out 
of the many teenage-oriented comedy-dramas that have been thrust upon us 
recently, this is one of the most weak and sloppily-written.
Josie Geller (Drew Barrymore) is a clumsy and unfashionable, but 
intelligent 25-year-old copy editor for the Chicago Sun-Times, and her 
yearning to become a newspaper reporter comes true when her stern boss 
(Garry Marshall) assigns her to pose as a high school student to write a 
story on the lives of today's teenagers. Although Josie is in a state of 
euphoria since her dream has finally come true, her 23-year-old slacker 
brother, Rob (David Arquette), who really was popular in his adolescent 
days and an aspiring baseball player, reminds her of how nightmarish her 
own high school days were. The butt of every joke, Josie was chubby, 
pimply, had braces, and was given the embarrassing nickname "Josie 
Gross-y." "Sorry about that," Rob says in the present day. "If I had 
known it would stick, I would never have made it up." 
Returning to high school, right on her first day and dressed in a tacky 
white outfit and boa around her neck, Josie finds herself almost 
immediately shunned by all of her classmates once again, befriended only 
by Aldys (Leelee Sobieski), a generous, unconventional "nerd" who 
invites her to join the Denominators, a calculus club. Threatened to be 
fired if she doesn't present a flashy story, and fast, Josie is forced 
to attempt to become popular, with the help of Rob, who also returns to 
high school and gets buddy-buddy with the in-crowd right away by winning 
a cole slaw-eating contest. Regrettably, as Josie begins to hang out 
with a clique of superficial girls, two of which are named Kirsten and 
Kristin (Jessica Alba, Marley Shelton), as well as attract the eye of 
renowned stud Guy Perkins (Jeremy Jordan), she begins to lose sight of 
what is really important, all the while trying to come to terms with her 
own high school experience, and growing close to her young english 
teacher, Sam Coulson (Michael Vartan).
"Never Been Kissed" acquires its title from a scene early on in the film 
when Josie is talking to her friend and co-worker, Anita (Molly 
Shannon), on a lunch break. "I've kissed guys before," she says, "but 
I've never felt that thing." I know exactly what Josie is talking about, 
but I wish I would have also felt that thing while I was watching this 
film, which is an uninspired rush-job. Although 107 minutes, "Never Been 
Kissed" seems to be always moving at such a break-neck pace that it 
rarely ever has time to slow down and develop any of the characters, and 
therefore, they all came off as blatant stereotypes (Comparingly, I was 
reminded of last week's high school entry, "10 Things I Hate About You," 
which didn't talk down to its audience and was wholly intelligent). In 
my four years of high school, not once did I ever come across people who 
acted like the one-dimensional Kristin and Kirstin do, nor have I ever 
seen someone who acted like the geeky Aldys (even though, as played in a 
standout performance by Leelee Sobieski, she is the most effective 
character in sight). On another note, I seriously doubt the real Chicago 
Sun-Times is like its depiction here, but I disgress. If "Never Been 
Kissed" is supposed to be a lightweight fantasy, I still have another 
complaint, which is that Barrymore is supposed to play a 25-year-old who 
goes back to high school and sticks out a little since she looks older, 
but the fact is that she doesn't. Unlike "10 Things...," in which the 
actors really looked like teens, every single central "teen" actor here 
looks just as old, if not older, than Barrymore. Come to think of it, I 
believe I just came up with an infinitely more original storyline, which 
is that every older-looking "teenager" discovers that they all are 
working for feuding newspapers, and in their rush to get their story out 
first, have accidentally enrolled in the same high school!
Since all of the characters were unwisely written as caricatures, there 
is no way I could care about the fates of anyone. Of course, Barrymore 
is as bright and likable as usual, but even concerning her I began to 
long for the days a few years ago when she was a more diverse actress, 
where she could go from playing a sexual predator (1992's "Poison Ivy") 
to a confused manic depressive (1995's "Mad Love") to a terrified victim 
stalked by a masked killer (1996's "Scream"). Don't get me wrong: I love 
Barrymore's sweet image as much as the next person, but I fear she is 
starting to get typecast in these roles. Giving the best performance in 
the film is the aforementioned Sobieski (who was snubbed of an Oscar nom 
for last year's "A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries" and will next be seen 
in the highly awaited Stanley Kubrick thriller, "Eyes Wide Shut"). 
Sobieski's Aldys was so nice to Josie right from the beginning that I 
felt it was a major misstep on Josie's part to begin to snub her as she 
became popular, since she obviously had been in Aldys' shoes eight years 
before. On the other side of the spectrum are Saturday Night Lives' 
Molly Shannon (in her first starring non-SNL feature) and John C. Reilly 
as another of Josie's co-workers, both of which have their comic 
abilities put to no good use. Tellingly, Shannon had more to do (and was 
given the opportunity to be infinitely more funny) on her guest-starring 
role in this week's half-hour episode of "Will & Grace."
Inevitably, everything leads up to a climactic scene at the prom (If my 
mind seves me correctly, I've seen three, count-'em, three, other movies 
this year that also led up to the prom: "She's All That," "Jawbreaker," 
and "10 Things I Hate About You"). I'm not really sure how, or why, 
everything always occurs at the prom in movies since, after all, it's 
only one night of the year. With a major similarity to 1995's 
far-superior "Angus," the dance concludes with Josie standing up for 
Aldys and giving a speech to all of the "misfits" out there. In "Angus," 
it felt more real, while in "Never Been Kissed," just like the rest of 
the movie, I was constantly making note that the film was simply going 
through the well-worn motions.
Ultimately, you feel almost guilty about giving a negative review to a 
movie that stars Barrymore (although I was forced to do it last year 
with "Home Fries"), but this movie just really isn't very good. It lacks 
a tightly-written screenplay, smart characters, or any real honest 
emotions (the movie is mostly steeped in obvious sentimentality). While 
watching "Never Been Kissed," I was reminded of 1997's wonderful comedy, 
"Romy and Michele's High School Reunion," which it is nearly identical 
to in story (aside from the latter set at a reunion). Both movies depict 
a person (or people) that suffered through the four-year hell that was 
high school, both feature almost duplicate flashbacks (even though the 
prom flashback in "Romy" was more heartbreaking and, again, more 
involving), and both allow the central characters to get back at all of 
the people who tormented them in a crowd-pleasing finale. One of the 
points the film wants to make is how ridiculous and cruel some teenagers 
can be to others. Too bad "Never Been Kissed" turned out to be just as 
painfully artificial as they are.

I'm currently accepting all future names for Drew Barrymore characters.  In
_The Wedding Singer_, she was Julia Gulia.  In _Never Been Kissed_, she's
Josie Grossie.  Future DB character names include: Janet Granite, Janey
Grainy, and for that NC-17 project in the works, Jo-Jo... aw forget it.
I'll stick to my day job.
This is a teen movie, all right, except the main characters aren't teens.
Drew Barrymore is a copy editor at the Chicago Sun Times who gets her big
break as a reporter, only it's very clear from the onset that she lacks the
toughness and the pushy extravertedness that marks the best of reporters.
The story she's covering is not really a story, but a story in the making.
She is to return to high school as a student and explain what's REALLY going
on.
The irony is that Drew's character, was such a dweeb first time around, that
she is terrified at going back.  When she does, she says the wrong things,
wears the wrong clothes, and projects the "I know the answer" in class that
popular kids (or at least popular kids in the movies) reject.  At least she
befriends nerdy Aldys (Joan of Arc's Leelee Sobieski--watch for her), who
turns out to be more beautiful than those who are "supposed" to be more
beautiful than her.
What works:  Drew's geeky old-self.  After a start in films that was
headline driven, and a nadir of roles that had her play the sluttish
character, it's a surprise to see her with bad hair, big glasses and braces.
It's very funny.  
What doesn't work:  Drew's geeky new-self.  Come on.  Nobody dresses as bad
as she does.  Couldn't she just go to _The Gap_ and take suggestions?  Had
she dressed like Princess Leia it would have been better.
The comedy is supposed to progress when Drew's younger brother (played with
zest by David Arquette) reenlists to jump-start his baseball career.  Now,
how in the world can somebody as nerdy (but in a funny way) as he can be the
most popular kid in the school... in a day?!
The dialogue in the film is, well, an embarrassment.  Her co-workers (Molly
Shannon, John C. Reilly and Gary Marshall) are in terminal hyper-drive.  Her
teenage peers (except Sobieski) are so inept and stupid that there's little
bite from them.  Couldn't the filmmakers watch _Heathers_ first?
Lastly, I am proud to say that I caught a significant gaffe in the film.  If
you see the film, you'd know what I'm talking about: 
Drew walks into a bar, has her hand stamped, and over the night associates
with some Rastafarians with some delicious, um, cake.  She goes wild, sleeps
in late.  When she wakes, she rushes off to school, without showering,
without noticing that her head, lying on her stamped hand all night, has
transferred part of the stamp's image to her forehead, spelling "LOSER".
Funny, eh?
...except that the hand would have transferred that image BACKWORDS.

Raja Gosnell's 'Never Been Kissed' is a slick and likable film, a 
formulaic but ultimately satisfying romance targeted toward you, if 
you are part of the 18-34 demographic that causes Hollywood directors 
to look over their shoulders at every gag and angle.
Executive producer Drew Barrymore is so hard to dislike:  she has a 
talent for seeming genuine, ingenuous, sweet, amicable.  This vehicle 
has her portraying Josie Geller, a 25 year-old, brilliant young editor 
at the Sun-Times, a Northwestern graduate who has never gotten around 
to having a personal life.  A whim of her crusty boss gives her the 
chance at being a reporter - long an ambition of Josie's.  Better yet, 
she'll be an undercover reporter at a high school, enrolling as a 17 
year-old!  Her  brother, Rob Geller (David Arquette) isn't so sure 
this ruse will work, but Josie nevertheless drives up to the school in 
Rob's gauche Vega.  Will Josie be popular enough to penetrate the 
cliques-that-be?  The answer, which we discover as Josie in her white 
jeans sashays into Spanish class:  NO!
Josie, as it turns out, still suffers from terminal over-compensation. 
 She is so preoccupied with pleasing others, that she stumbles 
clumsily through the halls and life, even once walking into an opening 
door.  Rob, as it turns out, saves her act by re-enrolling also.  He 
has faked his ID, and wishes to reactivate his chances at a minor 
league baseball contract.  Smoothly Rob reverses the opinions of the 
superficial student population:  he lies continually until Josie has a 
sterling, awesome reputation.  Now she is liked not only by the 
"Denominators" - a nerdy math group led by a girl named Aldys (Leelee 
Sobieski) - but by the cool crowd as well.  
Alas, her major problem persists:  even as she masquerades as a part 
of the teen crowd that rejected her the first time through high 
school, Josie Geller is scooped by reporters from other papers.  She 
simply cannot uncover the right story, the juicy scandal that would 
invite the notoriety for which Mr. Rigfort (Garry Marshall) has sent 
her.
The film is expert at recreating "Josie Grossie's" zit-covered high 
school years.  Barrymore navigates her innocent way into gross 
injustice.  Even before the prom she is set up, Carrie-like, to take a 
humiliating dive.  In flashbacks disturbing in their reality, we watch 
the insensitivity of youngsters.  Later on, of course, there is too 
much moralizing about this selfishness;  but Barrymore pulls off the 
preachiness without being too pouty.
David Arquette acts well as Rob, his manner properly crazy and 
supportive.  In posing as a teen, he has a bit more trouble than 
Barrymore, though:  too mature and mannish.
Garry Marshall?  This guy is the original Brooklyn smoothie:  he does 
it all (with canny knowledge of how to make his own directing efforts 
succeed), and acts with abandon in a role replicated from his 
performance as network chief in 'Murphy Brown.'  Good at creating a 
living caricature, this guy is.
Michael Vartan as English teacher Sam Coulson is accomplished at 
playing through in the game of overcoming stereotypes:  he's the 
caring and supportive teacher, young and good-looking and himself 
artistic yet athletic.  A he-man with a momma's-boy 'do.  What amounts 
to the film's key plot element as well as its horrendous artifice is 
the relationship between Sam and Josie.  Apparently the audience is 
not supposed to be bothered when Sam longs for Josie, her precocious 
knowledge enthralling him.  What's worse, Rigfort and  another of 
Josie's bosses, (funny guy John C. Reilly, miscast here) try forcing 
Josie's hand into an ethically messy situation involving Sam.  And we 
are not supposed to dislike them for this scheme?
Molly Shannon supplies great support as Josie's newsroom friend Anita. 
 Her role also demands several nods to stereotypes, namely promiscuous 
ones.  But Shannon shows that her comic muscles are in shape in scene 
after scene.
As an aside, what causes screenwriters to fall for silly or obscurely 
allegorical names?  Who out there knows the meaning of the name of 
Josie's vacuous office assistant???
'Never Been Kissed' ranks above average in the surplus of teen films 
hitting the market.  Its strength is sincere acting, its weakness a 
cloying predictability.  It's obvious the film is  aware of its own 
need to meet the formula that will satisfy an audience.  The paradox 
here is that the ending makes us wait, and then indeed IS satisfying.
