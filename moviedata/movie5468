Four teenage girls at a Los Angeles Catholic high school who have ample
reasons to hate the world (even beyond the fact that they are teenagers)
attempt to solve their problems by becoming witches -- with disastrous results.
As the result of a Wiccan advisor, the film has about as much accuracy in the
area of witchcraft as you could hope for in the midst of a quasi-horror movie
from an effects-happy Hollywood. Some of the rituals and concepts come
directly from the modern neo-pagan religions, but then the special effects
blow it all away into science fiction land. It's as if a scene in a film about
Christianity featured a priest performing a baptism with a flood of water
flowing from his fingers and lightning bolts shooting from his eyes.
Films featuring religion as the center point have always been a difficulty 
for mainstream studios, especially belief systems that are seen as The Other.
The easy approach is to grab the most exotic and sensational aspects and go
with them: Moslems as Jihad warriors, Hindus as fakirs, witches as
power-hungry spell-casters. At least there is none of the usual miscasting of
witches as Satan worshipers.
This story does capture the teen fascination with magick as a means to their
ends. A couple of the universal truths of adolescence are feelings of
powerlessness and a dissatisfaction with the cultural status quo. Magick is
seen as a cure for both. Empowerment in a way sure to piss off the parents.
When the girls perform a ritual to evoke a powerful spirit, they are in true
form: over their heads with precision in their act but no grounding in theology.
When one of the young witches realizes that things are falling apart (a slow
learner, she catches on after several deaths and her coven-mates begin
attacking her), she goes to an older witch for help. The elder practitioner
gives her a few hints, but our young friend runs away before she can help much.
The movie especially falls apart towards the end. One of the three "bad"
witchs seems to see the error of using magick to control others and then
suddenly she's back in the role of "evil"  without explaination. The tale
moral appears to be one of the main Wiccan beliefs: what you put out, you get
back threefold Â– the witch's version of the Golden Rule. The good little witch
supposedly believes that and uses it to defeat her opponents, but the last
scene shows her using her powers in an act of vengeance to scare and warn her
former friends.
As a horror film aimed at the younger set, this is nothing amazing, but does
stand a chance of becoming a cult (no pun intended) classic. It topped the box
office list during its first weekend in release. Checking out the pagan
newsgroups on the internet, the Wiccan opinion seems to be "It's not as bad as
we feared."

BEVERLY HILLS 90210 MEETS THE NECRONOMICON
The place is ivy-hung and haunted St. Benedict's High (well, I
guess it looks like any other American high school, but then evil's always
on the inside, isn't it?).  It is where Nancy, Rochelle and Bonnie hold
coven against a brutal society of whitebread prom queens and macho jerks.
They're wannabe witches, with their candles, incense and incantations, all
perky breasts and black eyeliner.  They're also ostracized and made fun of
by their snooty SoCal classmates... you know how cruel kids can be about
your hairstyle/skin colour/family background.  But all that changes when
new girl on the block Sarah (Robin Tunney), a "natural witch", is drawn to
them and they discover that together they can call upon a primeval,
supernatural entity to fulfill their wishes.  Uh oh... you know what's
going to happen to those snooty classmates now, don't you?  From scenes of
the ensuing hairloss and humiliation of their clean-cut, pearly-toothed
tormentors, cut to one of our hexy, sexy heroines strutting smugly through
school, suitably hip rock music playing in the background.
Soon enough though, when Nancy (Fairuza Balk) decides that they
should "invoke the spirit", all this happily dysfunctional adolescent
bitchcraft gives way to maledictions of grimer, more potentially earth-
threatening proportions... suffice it to say that whales get killed in the
process.  Not funny at all.  From this point on, to the predictable
show-down between good and evil (a contrite Sarah against an increasingly
twisted Nancy), the only things to watch out for are Fairuza Balk and a
few nifty special effects.  Fairuza Balk (also in THE ISLAND OF DR.
MOREAU) plays the proud but confused Nancy who needs to prove herself to
the world by demanding all the power in it.  She is by turns pathetically
attention-seeking and cruelly malicious, and remains the only believable
character even when she becomes irredeemably diabolical and psychotic.
The penultimate scene where she stalks Sarah through her house is the only
one that is truly eerie, and not because of the inclusion of buckets of
snakes and bugs.
If THE CRAFT was meant to be a scary movie, then it's so only because it 
could have been a cross between THE LOST BOYS and HEATHERS but turns 
out not even close to either of them. It's informed by occult 
references (the movie has a Wiccan priestess as a consultant for
crying out loud), yet fails to be subtle or original about them.  It has
the trappings of a stylish teen satire, yet ends on a humourlessly banal
note.  And it's altogether just too damn serious by half.  What it does
have is a first-rate performance by Fairuza Balk, a great soundtrack, and
enough visually impressive scenes to make a cool music video.  Good enough
for you, I suppose, if you're a trendy, Magic-playing person who always
wanted to be a witch.  But me and the tea leaves are against this one. 
Gerald Tan used to belong to the Magical Order of Dagon, but quit when
they couldn't get him a car.  He now belongs to the Cynical Order of
Dependent Twentysomethings. 
The Flying Inkpot Rating System:
 * Wait for the TV2 broadcast.
 ** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha! 
 *** Pretty good, bring a friend.
 **** Amazing, potent stuff.
 ***** Perfection. See it twice.

The Craft (1996) * out of ***** - Cast: Robin Tunney, Fairuza Balk, Neve
Campbell, Rachel True, Cliff De Young.  Directed By: Andrew Fleming.
Running Time: 100 minutes.
Director and co-writer Andrew Fleming is steadily becoming my least
favorite filmmaker.  He made 1988's "Bad Dreams", a horrible rip-off of the
"Nightmare on Elm Street" series.  Then in 1993 he made "Threesome", a very
disgusting film about three college roommates who all end up sleeping
together at the same time.  Now he gives us "The Crap", I mean, "The
Craft".  Actually, there's not much difference.
"The Craft" is all about four freaks, I mean, witches, who live in Los
Angeles.  Say, what better location for witches?  They all attend the same
catholic high school which, of course, is populated with the meanest kids
in the world.  The witches use their witchy powers to take revenge on the
racist girl, the womanizing jock, and to make themselves pretty (actually,
just brushing their hair and taking a shower would have made them pretty).
But, as stories about power go, things tend to get out of hand.  The head
witch Nancy (a scary looking Fairuza Balk) starts to go mad after being
struck by lightning while chanting at the beach.  (Wouldn't you?) She wants
to fly around and kill people, but the good witch Sarah doesn't want any
part of it and leaves the group.  Well, let me tell you that you don't
leave a group of witches, it's
like the mob.  Soon the remaining three witches are casting spells on Sarah
and in the final scenes are trying to kill her.  At this point, who cares?
The last 10 minutes features about a million bugs and snakes, which I
always believe is a ridiculous thing to put into a movie because about 90%
of the audience will turn away from the screen rather than look at bugs.
So making the climax of the film
all about bugs and snakes certainly is brilliant filmmaking.
"The Craft" is obvious from start to finish, with no depth into anything.
It's not even a good "revenge" flick, as the supposed "good" characters are
so stupid and unlikable that you really have no one to root for.  And I
don't blame Andrew Fleming entirely, because I don't think anyone could
have made a good film out of the script.  It's just not a worthwhile story.

     A coven of outcast, teenage witches wreaks havoc at a high school.
     Rarely have I been able to totally boil down the plot of a film so
succinctly, but with THE CRAFT, it's a piece of cake.  What, no intricate
subplots, you ask?  No involved character development?  No story
progression from one act to the next?
     Not really.  In fact, the witch stuff is just about it, and let me
tell you, that isn't nearly enough to carry a film for 105 minutes.
Rather, this film is much more concerned with jamming in 20 or 30 of your
favorite pop songs.
     The young witches are:  Sarah (Robin Tunney), the newcomer to school.
Nancy (Fairuza Balk), the white trash slut.  Bonnie (Neve Campbell), the
burn-scarred introvert.  And Rochelle (Rachel True), the token minority.
(They all represent one of the elements too, but I could never keep that
straight.)  The four girls form a coven of witches, find themselves outcast
from the rest of the school, and use their growing powers to get revenge on
everyone in their way.  One of these victims is played by Christine Taylor,
who played Marcia in THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE, and who causes lots of
laughter-for-the-wrong-reasons when she's on screen.  Another one is Chris
(Skeet Ulrich), on whom Sarah inexplicably casts a love spell.
     So what's the verdict on THE CRAFT?  Well, Balk looks even scarier
than normal, and it looks like she's forever doomed to play these wacko
roles.  A lot of the movie is just plain gross.  The jokes are largely not
funny.  The characters don't garner a lot of sympathy, as they're pretty
much just as evil as their victims.  While the leads can all act, the
script doesn't let them do too much of that.  The movie feels twice as long
as it really is.  And...the big daddy of all mistakes...THE CRAFT makes the
fatal error of trying to be *serious* instead of campy like it should have
been.  (Reread the first line of this review if you don't believe me.)
     On the plus side is very little of consequence.  Some of the effects
are pretty cool, but it's tough to make a big deal out of "magic" on a
movie screen when it's clearly just digital manipulation or parlor tricks.
Star-getter numero uno?  The leads are all very cute, especially Tunney.
     I still don't know what the intention of THE CRAFT was.  Was it
supposed to be a comedy?  A thriller?  A horror flick?  More like a music
video, if you ask me.
