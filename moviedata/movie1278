CROUPIER (director: Mike Hodges; screenwriter: Paul Mayersberg;
cinematographer: Mike Garfath; editor: Les Healey; cast: Clive Owen
(Jack Manfred), Kate Hardie (Bella), Alex Kingston (Jani de Villiers),
Gina McKee (Marion Neil), Alexander Morton (David Reynolds), Nick Reding

Runtime: 91; 1998-UK)
Being a croupier (dealer) in a London casino surprisingly turns out to
be the perfect job for the struggling South African novelist who is
looking for a subject and a main character for his book, and will find
it in this job he at first thought would only be a secondary one. Clive
Owen is Jack Manfred, the poker-faced narrator, whose voice-over not
only relates what is taking place onscreen, but relates how his novel is
coming along. He sometimes becomes his fictional alter ego, the main
character in his novel about a croupier.
Jack, the antihero of this sparkling and intelligent noir tale, is
having trouble writing, so he is forced to take a job his unscrupulous
father, who was once a notorious gambler but is now a bartender still
living in South Africa, secures for him through his connections in a
London casino. Jack's father brought him up in casinos and forced his
lifestyle upon him, raising him as a single-parent when his wife left
him. Jack loathed working as a dealer in the South African casino and
moved to London with the hope that he could become a writer.
Why Jack refuses to gamble but enjoys being a croupier becomes a main
thread of the story. The answer is only hinted at, being either that
Jack has watched his father's gambling habits make him a loser and has
sworn that won't happen to him, or perhaps, Jack himself was at one time
a compulsive gambler and has had a negative experience.
This is an overlooked noir thriller--shamefully it couldn't get a
British film distributor to give it a wide release when it opened. It is
a film from Mike Hodge, the director of the legendary "Get Carter" in
1971. What is magnificent about it, is the way its cynical tone captures
the London nocturnal after-hours club scene and how the charismatic
Clive Owen was able to pull you into his thought process as he weaves
Jack's character study, mainly by having him be an observer of the
punters (gamblers) in the casino, sneeringly looking down at them as
losers. Jack identifies with the casino and the casino's credo of not
being in the business of gambling but in winning. Jack wants to do
things in a honest way to win, whether as a writer or as a croupier, who
makes it a point of telling us how much he hates cheats, yet by a twist
of fate, part of the forced psychodynamics of the story, Jack ends up
like all the other cheats, choosing to be dishonest. The cynical message
inferred, is that one can't change human nature, that sooner or later
one will have to make a choice and bend the rules to accomodate who one
is.
In a plot that can be faulted only for its contrived surprise ending and
a death of one of the main players near the end, that adds absolutely
nothing to the story, what remains striking, is the passion the croupier
has for casino life and how it relates to his passion for writing.
The croupier knows that he has hit nirvana when he can no longer hear
the ball of the wheel as it rolls. It is beautiful to see this notion
converted onto the screen, as the film is a one-man show for Clive Owen,
relating how the tension builds inside him as he is confronted with
changes in his life, whether they are ones that might be considered
trivial like being forced to ride public transport or heavier changes,
as how to deal with his ex-cop, current store detective live-in
girlfriend Marion (Gina), or even heavier changes, if he should get
involved in a casino scam.
Jack wavers between loving Marion as if she were his conscience or not
being fully in love with her because he can't love someone who is so
straight. She states that she only wants to live with a writer not a
"fucking" croupier and always has such a sad expression, and is an open
book to read; while, Jack is always an enigma. How Jack deals with his
life and how keenly accurate he is in describing others he meets, makes
this film very literary.
He instantly becomes a favorite of casino manager David Reynolds
(Alexander Morton) because he is so good at the job and because he is so
trustworthy. Reynolds lectures him about the house rules and warns him
about fraternizing with gamblers and with his fellow casino employees,
and also tells him that he must report anyone he sees cheating or else
he will lose his job.
But our antihero soon ignores those rules, first by bar-hopping with the
casino's dishonest dealer Matt (Paul Reynolds), whom he will use as the
protagonist in his book about a croupier (Matt suggests the theme for
the book, by telling Jack, "I wanna to fuck over the world"), then by
having sex with another dealer (Kate Hardie), and then by associating
with a sexy grifter (Alex Kingston) who plays at his table on purpose,
as she tries to get him to go to bed with her and go along with a plan
to use him as an insider to heist the casino during Christmas.
There are a few other subplots brought up, such as him beating up men
who are cheaters. But, as with the many other subplots, its theme is
never fully realized.
When compared to three recent films about gambling, "Casino," "The
Rounders" and "Reindeer Games," there is no comparison, this one was the
more real and pertinent one. It is only too bad that "Croupier" couldn't
feel more committed to the power of the lyrical voice-over and less to
the canned responses of all the odd twists it had to throw into the
story, that diminished the bleak truth it was harping at -- of how life
itself is a game of chance and the casino is only a cheap imitation of
life.
In the end, the film's stylish depiction of the casino milieu, its
thrilling noir ambiance, and the character study of the croupier,
override the film's failure to end the film convincingly with the kind
of payoff that this thriller warranted. It turns out, that this
compelling story is just as much about being a writer as it is about
being a croupier. But the ace it has up its sleeve, is the distinguished
performance by Clive Owen.

     Good noir-ish thrillers are so few and far between that it almost
breaks my heart when one with so much going for it stumbles so badly down
the stretch. That's the situation with CROUPIER, a slick tale set in the
world of a London casino. Jack Manfred (Clive Owen) is an aspiring
novelist having trouble making ends meet while he tries to get something
published. Fortunately, he has a back-up skill: Having been raised around
casinos by his compulsive gambler father (Nicholas Ball) and having worked
in one in South Africa, Jack is an adept black jack dealer and roulette
wheel operator. His talent lands him a job in a casino where the money is
great, the rules of conduct strict and the hours challenging to his
relationship with his girlfriend Marion (Gina McKee). It also introduces
him to some potentially dangerous characters, like a patron named Jani
("E.R.'s" Alex Kingston) who wants Jack to help her with a little insider
job.
     From the outset, CROUPIER looks like it has all the classic film noir
elements. The protagonist narrates the story in a hard-boiled voice-over,
using a third-person description of events as Jack forms his experiences
into something he can write. Owen's laconic performance as Jack is
perfectly pitched; he's got that Campbell Scott deadpan thing going, which
is particularly appropriate since he's a dead ringer for Scott. There's a
promising femme fatale in Kingston's Jani, who slowly insinuates herself
into Jack's life before dropping the hammer. And Paul Mayersberg's script
offers a potent combination of sly dialogue, effective characterizations
and intriguing introduction to the world of the croupier. As the world of
the casino becomes ever more attractive to Jack, CROUPIER builds momentum
towards a resolution that seems certain to have a tremendous kick.
     Only it doesn't. It's hard to imagine a more anti-climactic climax to
a thriller than the one offered up by CROUPIER. The heist into which Jack
is recruited takes some unexpected turns, but for once that's far from a
compliment. It suddenly becomes evident that Mayersberg is going to wrap
things up far too quickly to make the film's conclusion satisfying. A dead
body turns up, but it never really matters in the long run. A manipulative
plot is exposed, but Jack doesn't seem particularly concerned by it. A
character appears to confess a secret love that makes you wonder what film
you just wandered into. A film like CROUPIER absolutely demands a big
payoff -- either realization that the protagonist has been suckered into
being the victim, or a big smile as he ends up the victor. CROUPIER can't
manage to provide either one. It's almost as though Mayersberg got stuck
on the film he was writing and pasted on the end of another film entirely.
     It's a testimony to how well CROUPIER works for 90% of its running
time that the train wreck of a conclusion can't derail the whole
film. Director Mike Hodges (probably best-known stateside for the garish
1980 FLASH GORDON) stylishly captures the dim casino milieu and the
choreographed moves of the croupiers, while Owen keeps us involved in what
will happen to Jack. There are some memorable scenes -- Jack's expert
manipulation of a poker game, for instance -- and some provocatively
enigmatic holes in Jack's back-story. There are also so many missed
opportunities that you just want to shake Mayersberg for his sloppiness. 
Right up to the moment of the planned casino heist, CROUPIER is well worth
recommending. I'd also recommend leaving the theater at that point. Any
ending you can come up with in your head is better than the one that ended
up on the screen.

Jack Manfred (Clive Owen) is a cool operator who naively thinks that he
always has everything under control.  Mike Hodges's CROUPIER, based on a
sharply written script by Paul Mayersberg, centers around Jack and his
alter ego, Jake.  Jack is a writer who has taken a job as a casino
dealer ("croupier" in British parlance) in order to get some exciting
source material for a novel.  The protagonist in Jack's book is Jake,
whom he models on himself, working at his new job.
It is hard to delineate exactly where Jack ends and Jake begins, but the
main difference is that Jack has a strong respect for rules and a belief
in the importance of honesty, whereas Jake has more malleable morals.
The beauty of the script is Jack's constant, third-person voice-over, as
he writes his novel in real-time based on his experiences in the gaming
industry.
Although bearing a passing similarity to REINDEER GAMES, CASINO and
ROUNDERS, CROUPIER's story isn't the least bit derivative.  With a sleek
look and feel, the movie has stylish atmospherics and a detached
approach that is a far cry from the typical in-your-face Hollywood
production.  The characters are intriguing, but they never feel the need
to beg you to like them or to insult you to get you emotionally hooked.
The intricate plot doesn't require any knowledge whatsoever of gambling,
and such insight information might be a detriment anyway, causing you to
pay too much attention to uninteresting minutia.
The ever-present voice-over by a dour protagonist is reminiscent of John
Cusack's part in HIGH FIDELITY.  As it is in HIGH FIDELITY, it is the
best part of CROUPIER.  ("A feeling of elation came over him," Jack says
of Jake.  "He was hooked again watching people lose money.")
But whereas HIGH FIDELITY is definitely a comedy, CROUPIER is sort of a
thriller.  More than anything it is a character study with some nice
little twists involving disreputable punters (gamblers), croupiers and
casino managers.
CROUPIER does has some humorous moments with perhaps the best being a
brief bit concerning another author working for Jack's publisher.  This
author, being a terrorist rather than a croupier, recently wrote a
successful "kill-and-tell book."
The women in Jack and Jake's lives -- Marion (Gina McKee), his live-in
girlfriend, Bella (Kate Hardie), a street-smart, fellow croupier, and
Jani (Alex Kingston), a mysterious and romantic punter -- lure them one
way and then another.  These twists form key parts of the labyrinthine
plot, but the enjoyment is in observing them more than in anticipating
where they are leading.  In CROUPIER, the journey itself is truly the
reward.
CROUPIER runs a fast 1:31.  The film is unrated but would be an R for
sexuality, language, dope smoking, brief nudity, some violence and adult
themes.  It would be acceptable for older teenagers.

Susan Granger's review of "CROUPIER" (Shooting Gallery Films/Loews
Cineplex series)
     This compelling crime caper by British director Mike
Hodges is what low-budget, independent film-making is all about. Back
in the '70s, Mike Hodges did the critically acclaimed "Get Carter,"
starring Michael Caine, and this is in the same vein. It's based on a
script by Paul Mayersberg, who years ago wrote one of my all-time
favorites sci-fi films, "The Man Who Fell to Earth." Clive Owen plays
Jack Manfred, a frustrated, aspiring novelist whose father (Nicholas
Ball) gets him an interview for a job as a croupier at the Golden Lion
Casino in London.  And why not? He has the hand of a conjurer - or an
experienced card player. Reluctantly, he takes the job at "the house
of addiction," philosophizing, "You have to make a choice in life: be
a gambler or a croupier - and live with your decision." And Jack is
coldly obsessed with watching people lose since, after all, a good
customer is a consistent loser. One of the most intriguing losers is a
beautiful gambler (ER's Alex Kingston) from South Africa with whom he
has an affair, deceiving his lover (Gina McKee), a store detective who
believes Jack's high-tension job has made him into a miserable
zombie. He also becomes involved with a fellow croupier (Kate
Hardie). "I'm not an enigma," Jack explains. "I'm a contradiction."
Jack's ultimate aim is to become totally detached (i.e.: "The croupier
had reached his goal - he no longer heard the sound of the ball.").
Jack's behind-the-scenes casino adventures and the various scams are
intriguing but his hackneyed internal monologues about the book he's
writing soon become tedious. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
"Croupier" is a clever, stylish, cynical 7. "Gambling," we're told,
"is about not facing reality, not counting the odds." But, ah, the con
artists!

   Here on Manhattan island where I see virtually all of my
films, "Croupier" is playing at only one movie house--which
speaks novels about what studios consider the taste of even
the sophisticated moviegoing public of New York.  U-571, a
well-made techno-thriller which the NY Times critic astutely
calls a movie "without a brain in its head" and one suitable
for "kids," is sending people to the box office with the 
speed of a torpedo.  "Croupier" on the other hand is one of
those noir films that might be called a sleeper, perhaps
because of insufficient marketing--a gamble its producers
were afraid to make.
   Featuring a cast of first-rate performers largely unknown to
an American audience, the picture is directed by Mike
Hodges, whose "Get Carter" back in 1970 is (like his current
feature) a lean drama--one featuring Michael Caine as a
small-time gangster investigating his brother's death.  Though
the 68-year-old British director's output has been meager, his
"Get Carter" and his "Croupier" demonstrate his taste for
realistic action and technical pizazz.
   Employing a technique used by playwright Eugene O'Neill
in his experimental work "Strange Interlude," Hodges has his
title character narrate his thoughts, allowing us to get to know
him better.  At several points in this fast-moving melodrama,
Jack Manfred (Clive Owen) would make comments to his girl
friend Marion (Gina McKee), to his dad (Nicholas Ball), and to
the sexy South African gambler Jani de Villiers (Alex
Kingston), only to subvert his remarks with wry, narrative
reflections.  Through Jack's inner musings and outward
commentary, we learn not only quite a bit about this
fascinating person but receive abundant information about the
goings-on of gaming casinos in much the way that "Airport"
instructs us about the world of the airline industry.
   Jack Manfred, who is in virtually every scene, is at heart a
writer who is blocked because, being jobless, he seems to
have nothing to write about.  His inspiration comes when he
takes employment as a croupier, or casino operator, a gig
which he father urges him to grab given the young man's
inability to make a go behind his laptop.  Showing a natural
ability to manipulate a deck of cards, he is hired by a London
casino owner who likes what he sees.  Jack himself never
gambles, choosing to get his kicks not from winning or, as
some psychologists hold, by self-destructively losing, but by
watching his customers forfeit their shirts.  He recognizes that
the odds always favor the house and is particularly
bewildered by his girl friend's custom of buying lottery tickets
despite the odds of 42 million to one.
   Hodges' picture possesses the elements of the noir genre,
including a femme fatale, an eternal cigarette in the mouth of
its protagonist, and filming that takes place almost exclusively
at night or in indoor spaces.  Most of all, "Croupier" is an
exercise in cynicism, featuring a plot with a wonderful
surprise ending that proves that nice guys often lose, adding
that a solid sense of humor can go a long way toward
alleviating the damage.  Clive Owen is made for the role. 
With hair dyed black and a tuxedo that fits him like his own
skin, Owen could be the next James Bond--except that in his
current role he is even more detached than his fictional fellow
countryman, too wound up with inner debates and exploited
vulnerabilities.  "Croupier" is a thriller without car chases or
explosions which works as an intense, swiftly-paced winner.
The picture lets us in on as much as we need to know about
a novelist whose losing life undergoes a radical change after
he takes a job that most people of his station would never
consider.

"I've a system that's fiendishly clever
"That I learned from a croupier friend;
"And I should go on winning forever,
"But I do seem to lose in the end."
     Gambling is a loser's game.  As seen through the cool, 
odds-calculating eyes of Jack (Clive Owen), a professional croupier and 
aspiring novelist, the punters who sit at the blackjack and roulette 
tables are sheep headed, sooner or later, for the shears.   
     Jack himself doesn't gamble.  At least, not on cards or the spin of 
a wheel.  But he's not immune to a little risk-taking in life.  After 
all, he's a writer, and if a writer doesn't throw open the doors to 
chance and a little danger, there's not much to write about.  Risks are 
the chips a writer buys to get in the game.  The odds, of course, are as 
bad for a writer as for a gambler, as Jack observes, browsing in a 
bookstore where "books are piled like chips."
     The movie opens with Jack being courted by an editor to write a 
novel, and it unfolds, with voice-over narration, in third-person 
chapter form once Jack reluctantly follows his father's urging and takes 
a job as a croupier in one of London's private gambling casinos.  The 
book he undertakes is not the soccer novel he's discussed with the 
editor, but a dispassionate insider's take on the casino world.  It's a 
world of strict rules routinely broken, of odds and chances, of personal 
loyalties and skin-saving expediency.  And what is actually happening to 
Jack, and what is happening to his novel's protagonist Jake, is not 
always easy to distinguish.
     Clive Owen, the 35-year-old actor who plays Jack, opens the door 
into star territory in his first role to successfully weather the 
Atlantic crossing.  He has the chiseled intense elegance of a young Sean 
Connery.  Tuxedoed, unflappable, with piercing eyes that miss nothing, 
he occupies "the still center of that spinning wheel of misfortune."  
Placing him there are another couple of veteran filmmakers.  Paul 
Mayersberg (The Man Who Fell to Earth) builds his screenplay through 
character and detail before throwing in an unexpected twist at the end.  
Director Mike Hodges, whose first and best-know feature, the crime 
classic Get Carter (with Michael Caine), came out thirty years ago, 
directs with the sang-froid of a player counting cards. 
     Croupier is that refreshing anomaly, the sleeper hit that keeps the 
system honest.  In the wild gamble that is the movies, it's reassuring 
to see that, if you play your cards right, it's not impossible to beat 
the odds.

A croupier is a dealer in charge of a gaming table. As simply put, a
dealer who is there to watch you win or lose. The dealer's main
concern is that you lose. In director Mike Hodge's latest crime caper,
"Croupier," Jack is one of those dealers, keenly aware of every move
you make, including the people he knows outside the casino.
Clive Owen plays Jack as a cool, detached wanna-be novelist, told to
write a book on soccer. He is living with his uncouth girlfriend,
Marion (Gina McKee), whom he only "half-loves." Marion is a store
detective with vaguely romantic notions about writers. But Jack is
virtually bankrupt on any story ideas - he needs inspiration. It
finally comes when his gambler father (Nicholas Ball) advises him to
take a job at the Golden Lion, a London casino. Jack is interviewed
and gets the job, much to the disappointment of Marion who prefers for
him to stay home and write, and sleep the same hours she does.
Jack is an expert on counting cards and counting money - he is quick,
smart and clever, nothing can escape him. He also never gambles. As we
are told in narration by Jake, Jack's literary alter-ego (the basis
for the book he is writing on his own experiences), the croupiers are
there to watch you lose. There is also the complete detachment
expected from croupiers towards other clientele, or
clients. Nevertheless, Jack's alter-ego takes over and breaks all the
rules he so steadfastly held. He has a brief affair with Bella (Katie
Hardie), a drug-addicted croupier, and parties with another croupier
who is stealing from the casino. Jack also gets involved with a femme
fatale, Jani De Villiers (Alex Kingston from TV's "E.R."), a regular
player at the Golden Lion who sees, literally, a wealth of
opportunities with Jack, if he complies to her plans.
"Croupier" never makes a wrong move in plotting or characterization,
but its main strength is the character of Jack. My favorite films are
usually the most subjective, and this is also true of "Croupier,"
which features Jack in every single scene. Every move he makes is seen
from his point-of-view, or heard by the reliable use of
narration. Jack is at firsthand unlikable, and perhaps untrustworthy,
but slowly we start to sympathize with him, understanding that he is
doing a job he does not like solely for creative inspiration. A great
scene is when Marion reads the first few chapters of his book and says
she does not like it, claiming it has no hope and that the character
is a zombie. Jack counterattacks, asking her if her job as a store
detective makes her happy.
If the film does not quite strike the vivid chord of film noir or
neo-noir at its best, it is largely due to the casting of Alex
Kingston as the conniving, sexual predator Janni. She is meant to be a
seductress but is too homely and innocent to make the character
convincing (imagine Anne Archer as a seductress and you may know what
I mean). Don't get me wrong, I love Kingston, and her work in "E.R."
is extraordinary, but she is better suited to less dangerous character
parts.
One other minor gripe is that I wish I saw more of Marion - a
character who understands Jack all too well. She knows what he thinks,
how he behaves, and she is aware that she cheats on her with Bella,
but she still loves him and wants to marry him. Marion is a complex
character to be sure, if only there were more of her to do Jack's
character real justice.
Otherwise, "Croupier" is an exciting, lean, and electrifying film -
atmosphere and style are essential to noir landscapes and this film
has it in spades. Clive Owen shows remarkable chaste and suaveness in
Jack, exuding double the charisma and coolness fo someone like Pierce
Brosnan. Finally, Owen shows us that Jack may think he knows every
trick in the book when playing cards, but he also finds that life
plays its own tricks as well.

When I saw Croupier, there were no coming attractions. While I saw the movie in
a perfectly respectable Loews Cineplex theater with three screens, no studios
thought that their money would get put to good use by placing a trailer before
this film. This could be a sign that expectations were low in regard to how
much of an audience this movie would receive. More likely though, it's a sign
that little movies like these are often the best films out there. While some
smaller movies get the mainstream quota achieved by hits like Life Is
Beautiful, Being John Malkovich, and The Blair Witch Project there are others
that remain doomed to the film festival. Adopted by The Shooting Gallery as
their fifth film in this year's lineup of six, Croupier is an intense film noir
piece worthy of your attention. The scheduled two week run does shame to a
movie that should play for longer for all to see and experience.
Clive Owen plays Jack Manfred. Jack is a struggling writer who takes a job as a
croupier in a casino after his father suggests it to him. Jack is currently in
a relationship with Marion (McKee), who doesn't like his new job. Life as a
croupier is a depressing one. Jack watches people lose their money night after
night. Another croupier winds down after work with drinks at a local prostitute
heavy bar. Ã¢ÂÂThe job will kill you if you donÃ¢ÂÂt.Ã¢Â? he says. Even though
strict rules issued by the casino forbid it, Jack soon begins sleeping with a
co-worker named Bella (Hardie). Jack breaks another rule when he begins seeing
Jani de Villiers (Kingston), a gambler from South Africa who catches his
interest. He soon falls in love with her, but Jani has ulterior motives to
their relationship. She asks Jack to take part in a hiest to rob the casino,
offering him quite a deal of money to do so. 
All the classic detective movie elements are here. There are many voice-overs,
there is a woman with a secret, and the characters smoke a lot and drink a lot.
Indeed everything needed is here but the detective. While Croupier is certainly
not a mystery, it does a brilliant job of almost turning itself into one in the
last few minutes. Questions we weren't really asking get answered, and it's a
nice touch to end the film with. Clive Owen is terrific as the lead character
and makes his sullen, emotionless view of the world an interesting outlook. You
have no doubt the casino he works in is real. The filmmakers did a remarkable
job of making you feel that somewhere this casino really does exist. Everything
seems so dark and gloomy in this world. At times, I felt black and white would
have been more appropriate to this movie than color. Either way, it would still
be thrilling. The lights, the noise, the people, everything that might annoy
one in a regular casino is here to set a unique atmosphere. The cheaters and
obsessive gamblers Jack encounters in the casino seemed to me a metaphor of the
characters in the movie. All of the them are trying to cheat at something or
are permanently downcast with nowhere to turn. Croupier is not rated. If
submitted, it would get rated R for sexual situations including graphic nudity,
language, and some violence. Several unneeded breasts are present. Then again,
maybe this too is a suggested way that gamblers escape from their troubles. Not
only is Croupier a high quality drama, but it made me think about what leads
people to become obsessive gamblers. The movie doesn't come up with an answer.
Then again, maybe there isn't one.

        Heavy on style and seductiveness, the British film "Croupier" is
one of those unassuming Channel Four franchises that creeps out of nowhere
and provides a thought-provoking alternative to the blather of Hollywood's
summer lead-in.  In Mike Hodges' film, a blocked writer (expertly played by
Clive Owen) takes a temporary job as a croupier in a London casino to make
ends meet and soon becomes drawn into the complexities of gambling,
gamesmanship, and goodness knows what else.  It's a simple enough storyline
but it's given remarkable depth by writer Paul Mayersberg and significant
worth by its stellar cast, mostly unknowns on this side of the Atlantic
(although the croupier's girlfriend, played by Gina McKee, will be
recognized from "Notting Hill").  Owen, handsome as all get out with his
jet-black hair and matching tux, commands the film with a smoky, smoldering
performance that's matched only by his own smoky voiceover, often times
nicely at odds with--or second guessing--the narrative, and a smooth jazz
scoreline by Simon Fisher Turner.  "Croupier" is more a character study
than a card-sharp drama, yet Hodges scores some winning touchdowns in the
casino proper.  Here the hush of a dealt card and the chink of one chip
against another provide delicate soundscapes that contrast with the glam of
the ensuing roughness.  Good stuff this, as Jack (Owen), who was raised in
South Africa and did some dealing there, soon regains his wonderlust for
watching people lose as he tries to walk the straight and narrow.  But it's
a wicked twisted world out there where temptations are ripe and
commonplace, more frequent, certainly, than the turn of a friendly card.
