Despite its superb performances, this is a bleak film about one
of life's dissolute losers. Set in a tiny New Hampshire town in the
dead of winter, Nick Nolte is the local cop and snow-plower who's
brow-beaten by the town's real-estate power broker, unhappily divorced
from his wife, and painfully alienated from his pre-teen
daughter. Except for his waitress girl-friend, Sissy Spacek, no one
wants to be around him, even his drunk, sadistically violent and
emotionally abusive father, James Coburn, who allowed his mother to
freeze to death in their isolated farmhouse.  As the story unfolds,
solemnly narrated by his younger brother, Willem Dafoe, we find out
how he came to be who he is and why, when a local union boss is
accidentally killed in a deer-hunting accident, he is told to just
look the other way - if he wants to keep his job. Instead, he indulges
his conspiracy theories involving foul play and discovers some
devastating truths about himself, his past, and his future.  Adapted
from a novel by Russell Banks, this sanity-to-madness saga should be
more emotionally affecting than it is, but writer/director Paul
Schrader ("Taxi Driver," "Raging Bull") invests so much coldly
calculated gloom, doom, and foreboding into every cruel scene that
there are few highs and lows. From the beginning, Nolte's life is one
of tortured, desperate rage.  With no self-esteem, he is spiritually
adrift and neurotic, unable to maintain a relationship with anyone. In
short, he's a wreck. His life is in shambles. All his dark angst is
symbolized by a persistent, throbbing toothache which he suffers
throughout. Both Nick Nolte and James Coburn deliver remarkable
performances, but on the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Affliction"
is a desolate, uncompromising 6. One of the most harsh, depressing
movies of the season.

Affliction is a riveting piece of entertainment on all respective
levels. The acting is extraordinary, the story is captivating and the
atmosphere is chilling and effective. While there are numerous sub-plots
about family confrontations and small-town murder, Affliction is really
only about one man who is being pushed over the edge.
That man is Wade Whitehouse (Nick Nolte), a small-town sheriff and
divorced father, who is living a complicated and frustrating life in the
snow covered surroundings of New Hampshire. The first half of the story
rotates largely around Wade's best friend Jack Hewitt (Jim True), who
accompanies a business man on a hunting expedition only to witness him
shoot himself. While Jack stresses it was just a freak hunting accident,
Wade thinks there is something more to it. And so he uncovers a possible
conspiracy involving his boss (Holmes Osborne), and the victim's
son-in-law.
But Affliction is, by no means, a murder mystery. The real emotional
charge comes care of Wade's relationship with his drunken, abusive
father (marvelously played by James Coburn). Director Paul Schrader
(veteran scribe of such films as Raging Bull and Taxi Driver) uses
flashbacks to introduce us to the Whitehouse family problems, and this
approach is incredibly effective, especially on the basis of visual
presentation. Schrader presents the footage in a fuzzy, worn appearance,
much like an old home video filmed with the picture out of focus. Some
people may find this tedious, but the effect is profoundly striking.
Affliction turns into Wade's incomparable struggle to come to grips with
everything in his life. He's fighting a custody battle with his ex-wife
(Mary Beth Hurt) for his daughter he cares for but can't rightfully
support, the appearance of his father puts an awkwardness on his current
relationship with local waitress Maggie Fogg (Sissy Spacek), and on top
of it all he has an incredible toothache. Wade Whitehouse is a troubled
human being living a turbulent life, and some may find it difficult to
watch as it spirals out of control.
The standout reason to see Affliction is the incredible performances.
While Coburn's performance is phenomenal and downright chilling, it's
Nolte who owns the screen. This is the breakout performances of the
actor's career, and he leaves no margin for error in his portrayal of
the troubled sheriff. His performance is commanding and immensely
powerful. I also found much to like in the performance of Willem Dafoe
as Wade's younger, more civilized brother. Dafoe's presentation is
initially limp, but we come to relate to his quiet and dignified
character. Schrader uses Dafoe as a voice-over narrative in sporadic
instances, but doesn't go overboard. The director knows his actors are
competent enough to set the point across themselves, and rarely relies
on this familiar narration approach.
Nick Nolte has taken to his role as Wade Whitehouse like a bull by the
horns, and the riveting outcome of the movie is directly because of his
amazing performance. While James Coburn won an Oscar for his role (and
rightfully so), Affliction should always be remembered as Nolte's movie.
For the first time in years, the actor's fierce aggression on screen
does not seem forced, not even marginally. His character is so
overwrought with paranoia, family issues and business problems and
Nolte's delivery seems completely and utterly perfect. While the ending
of Affliction is rather simplistic, it creates a shocking final effect
that hits right at home in the heart of the viewers, like a single brick
landing with a resounding thud' at your feet. The snowy November
weather only assists as Affliction, a startling character drama with a
superb cast, succeeds in stopping your blood cold.

give me a buzz on the ol' e-lines, iluvmick@hotmail.com
You should be open-minded when you walk into movie theatres.
It's not fair to pre-judge films and remain closed to the
possibility that you actually might like it. For instance, I
thought that when I finally saw the hyped-up Oscar-winner, "The
English Patient", I would hate it, but it was excellent and
enjoyable. So, yes, preconceived notions can hinder a reviewer
and make the review seem much less credible. Having said all of
that, I strolled into the theatre to see "Affliction" and winced
when Paul Schrader's name appeared as the director. Sorry, but
the ol' mind was a little closed here. The screenwriter of "Taxi
Driver" and "Raging Bull", Schrader seems to have a fixation on
showing every form of the sordid side of society. I think "Taxi
Driver" is highly overrated and the violence is gratuitous. I
hold Schrader responsible.
        Well, if that film is about urban paranoia, "Affliction"
must be about rural paranoia. This is a typical Schrader story of
the seamy underbelly of human life. It probes the emotions and
feelings of its characters very well until the rather abrupt
finale that leaves something to be desired. There's no subtlety
to the conclusion and the film is not as poetic as it tries to
be. It's actually too obvious what they're trying to say with the
metaphors of alcoholism and dealing with pain. However, I hate to
give a poor recommendation to a film that could win two acting
Oscars. So I won't. This is a film worth seeing, if only for Nick
Nolte and James Coburn, who could each win their first trophy
(Nolte for lead actor and Coburn for supporting). The
performances are great, but the movie is unsatisfying.
        The story features Wade Whitehouse (Nolte) a bitterly
divorced father of a little girl and the small town's spineless
cop. He also works as a snow-removal guy. His life is an absolute
mess. His daughter says she loves him, but can't handle being
around him. His girlfriend, Margie (Sissy Spacek), is
sympathetic, but she is unable to positively affect his life.
Willem Dafoe, who narrates and plays his brother, Rolfe, has left
the small Maine town to make a life for himself and forget about
the bad childhood memories he left behind. And that leads us to a
man (James Coburn) who is a cinch to walk up the steps on Oscar
night for his cruelly outstanding supporting performance as
Wade's father, Glen Whitehouse. For this unrepentant role of a
selfish old drunk, and for his lengthy (yet unrewarded career),
Coburn is due.
        When Wade and Rolfe were young, their father verbally abused
them and even resorted to violence. This contemptable man grows
old, not caring that he has scarred Wade inside more than his
punches ever could. Wade tries his best not to be a bad man, but
he is failing. He is a loser and the only thing preventing him
from becoming just his drunken father in the first half of the
film is a desperate attempt to cling to his sanity.
        After an inexperienced hunter is found shot while out with
Wade's friend and co-worker, Jack Hewitt (Jim True), Wade
suspects that the death was a murder conspiracy with several key
players--including his own boss. He sets out to prove it, making
wild accusations, losing his job, and alienating his girlfriend
and daughter. Meanwhile, to add to Wade's troubles, his mother
dies because of his father's uncaring negligence, causing Wade to
move back in and take care of the old bastard.
        This is supposed to be a character study and it certainly is
that. For a little while, it actually looks like a serious
"Fargo". But, towards the end, it takes a hard turn and Wade
collapses into such despair and desperation that he clearly
becomes his father. He fights that transition, but in such a weak
script it's inevitable. I can't say more because that would
reveal too much, but I have one suggestion (which is obviously
months too late!)--the very last image in the film should be of
Nolte's defeated face. After all, he's the thrust of this
slow-moving tale.
        Nolte could take home the golden prize on Oscar Night,
Coburn probably WILL for his years of fine work, and they both
deserve to win. These are definitely characters we care about, no
matter what horrible things they do or say. We want to see what
will happen to them. However, this film is neither enjoyable nor
as intelligent as it wants to be. A better director would have
found a better hook to make the story as unforgettable as its
subjects.
USELESS TRIVIA--Paul Schrader also directed "American Gigolo". If
I ever review that piece of trash, it will get one of the very
rare 0/10 ratings I'll EVER give. There is NO reason for people
to see that film (and I usually give at least SLIGHT
recommendations!).

AFFLICTION ***˝ (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers ( wchamber@netcom.ca )
starring Nick Nolte, Sissy Spacek, James Coburn, Willem Dafoe
screenplay by Paul Schrader, based on the novel by Russell Banks
directed by Paul Schrader
     Wade: "I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe. And
some night I'm going to bite back."
     Rolfe: "Haven't you already done a bit of that?"
     Wade: "No, not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit."
Why Schrader chose to adapt Banks' disquieting literary novel
Affliction is no great mystery; its story follows an arc similar to
that of Schrader's best known works, such as his screenplays for
Scorsese's Taxi Driver and his own Hardcore. Affliction's Wade
Whitehouse, like Travis Bickle before him, is a man who fixates on
exposing corruption in place of confronting his own violent past. (In
Bickle's case, planning the assassination of a governor represses
memories of the Vietnam War, from which he was honourably discharged;
Wade has been afflicted for years by his father Glen's wickedness.)
Wade (Nolte) is a barren New Hampshire town's resident policeman and
snowplow operator. His personal life is a shambles: his ex-wife hates
him; his only child, a daughter named Jill (Brigid Tierney), has
little love left for him; his boss, Gordon LaRiviere (Holmes Osborne),
considers him expendable; and his current girlfriend, the humourously
named Margie Fogg (Spacek), is reluctant to become his fiancee. When
he sees a chance to play hero, by detecting the murderous motives
behind a hunting accident (in which Evan Twombley (Sean McCann), a
union leader about to testify against organized crime bosses, was
killed), he takes it.
Wade has a persistant toothache, which serves as a physical
manifestation of his grief. Bad memories, like his mouthsore,
occasionally prevent him from functioning normally. Glen, much to
Wade's chagrin, is still alive, and still prone to berating his
children and binge drinking. Wade obsesses over the Twombley case; if
he solves it, it might boost his self-esteem. The investigation also
provides him with an outlet for his rage; familial loyalty prevents
him from directing it at the people who truly deserve it.
In that respect, Wade is awfully reminiscent of another Banks'
antihero, "The Sweet Hereafter"'s ambulance chasing Stephens, who
spent weeks seducing a town into believing a fatal school bus accident
could be avenged to avoid confronting the news that his runaway
teenaged daughter tested HIV positive. Wade is a more compelling 
character, cinematically, than Stephens, because Schrader paints a
picture of Wade's world before diving into his crusade. We learn that
a night in the life of Wade Whitehouse consists of emotional tugs of
war with Jill, some pot smoking with the locals, copious amounts of
booze, a fight with the ex, and perhaps an early morning phone call to
his estranged brother, Rolfe (Dafoe), a history professor who was
smart enough to leave town at the first opportunity. Wade leads a
listless yet restrictive existence.
Nick Nolte is such a commanding screen presence; he makes even a
common toothache compelling. After a pair of dynamic performances in
Cape Fear and The Prince of Tides, Nolte frittered away his comeback
clout on I Love Trouble, Blue Chips, and other forgettable-sometimes
downright terrible-big movies. His recent Oscar nod for Affliction
signals the beginning of a new phase in his career-Nolte is finally
showing his vulnerable side and being recognized for it. Built like
Frankenstein's monster, he lurches in scenes with Coburn, revealing a
sorrow and hopelessness that appears to physically shrink him. He
deserves the award come March 21st.
Coburn, a frequent collaborator of the late, great Sam Peckinpah,
delivers his finest performance since Peckinpah's WWII drama Cross of
Iron. After two decades of jokey cameos in such films as The Muppet
Movie and Maverick (and even a how-to gambling video!), Coburn reminds
us the blood of a great actor courses through his veins. Gone are the
pearly whites and blow-dried hairdo; Glen "Pops" Whitehouse lacks
vanity. A good self-image is obviously none of Glen's concern.
Schrader strips iconic Coburn of his very Coburn-ness; Coburn's
trademark gruffness is abrasive in Affliction and not at all
endearing.
Affliction's super8 flashbacks lack sting. I dare say they aren't at
all necessary: the blankness in Wade's eyes conjures mental images
much more brutal and upsetting than anything a filmmaker can
manufacture. Thankfully, they're but a small portion of the tapestry
of anguish woven by Schrader and Banks (Schrader has quite faithfully 
translated Banks' prose); it should be warned that the film offers no
tidy resolutions to its plot threads. For some afflictions, the
filmmakers thrillingly speculate, there is no cure.

Harvey S. Karten
   The production notes for "Affliction" advise us that if a
kitten does not have human contact during the first two
weeks of its life, it will never EVER respond to human touch. 
It will become a feral beast.  This may sound harsh and
inspire disbelief, but as an animal lover I can affirm that the
statement is absolutely true.  Imagine, then, that the feline is
not simply ignored by people but is actually kicked around
and thrown out of windows by wanton boys, and perhaps
then you can accept this fact of nature.  This example may
be used to symbolize what happens when a small boy is
abused by a drunken father virtually every week of his young
life.  Not only will the lad likely turn into an alcoholic himself:
he will bear the imprint of this misuse throughout his days.
Though most people will probably repress the memory and
go on to live seemingly normal, if vaguely unhappy lives,
Wade Whitehouse (Nick Nolte), the principal character in
writer-director Paul Schrader's "Affliction," is unable to curb
his rage.  Based on a novel by Russell Banks and
thematically similar to that author's more appealing short
story, "The Sweet Hereafter," "Affliction" cannot sustain its
thematic weight.  Mr. Schrader is intent on dramatizing not
just a textbook case of abnormal psychology but on
portraying, Greek-tragic style, the affects of a strongly macho
culture on generation after generation of men, propelling the
narrative into epic import.  This has a legendary impact that
could well work on the page but is too ponderous, sluggish,
and alien to the virtues of the screen.  
   The chief flaw in this movie occurs at the very beginning.
Wade's brother Rolfe (Willem Dafoe) delivers an off-screen
narration, giving away a key point of the plot.  By explaining
right off the bat that he will relate the story of a man who
gave full vent to his neurotic obsessions and thereby suffered
cognitive deterioration, he forgets that the audience wants to
believe Wade's interpretation of events, to cheer for him as
he moves to root out evil in his town.  By giving away the
store during the initial minutes, Rolfe has destroyed most of
the tension that the story could have developed.
   The story takes place in a bleak, snowed-in, economically
depressed rural area of northern New Hampshire (actually
filmed near Montreal), the sort of rustic "paradise" that people
with an ounce of smarts would make tracks from, and pronto. 
Wade, however, has remained, despite the failure of his two
marriages to Lillian (Mary Beth Hurt), sustained by odd jobs
for businessman-selectman Gordon Lariviere (Holmes
Osborne) and a laughable job as a traffic cop with no crimes
to pursue.  When rich union leader Evan Twombley (Sean
McCann) is killed in a hunting accident, Wade suspects foul
play, convinced that the man was murdered by his hunting
guide and Wade's friend, Jack (Jim True), at the orders of
Twombley's son-in-law, Mel Gordon (Steve Adams).  Seeing
the chance to become a hero and thereby regain the affection
of his wife and his nine-year-old daughter Jill (Brigid Tierney),
he pursues an investigation, provoking conflicts with his boss
and the hostility of the suspected mastermind in murder,
Gordon.  Though he has gained the devotion of the local
waitress Margie (Sissy Spacek), he cannot dispel the
memories of his abusive dad, Pop Whitehouse (James
Coburn), whom he conjures us in his memories of childhood
days and whom he visits as well in the present.  Though his
brother Rolfe (Willem Dafoe) has successfully escaped to the
big city by becoming a professor at Boston University--
determined never to return unless tragedy were to strike his
family in Laverne, New Hampshire--Wade cannot break the
bonds of his cruel and offensive dad and sets up a self-
destructive scenario.
   There is much to admire in the performances. Nick Nolte
gives one of the finest of his career as a man who
successfully covers up his emotional scars, particularly in the
affectionate way he relates to his daughter, Jill, whom he has
taken for the weekend Halloween festivities.  You've got to
admire his patience.  Jill is the sort of youngster who could
try anyone's patience, a disagreeable, insulting, hostile
creature who from the moment she arrives at the party insists
on being taken home to her mother.  One can see, as well, a
certain fondness he holds for his girl friend Margie, though he
throws hints that he is proposing marriage to her only as a
way to help gain custody of his daughter.  James Coburn as
Wade's dad is precise in his depiction of a man who is
anything but politically correct, one who has apparently
learned his lessons well at his own father's knee: that women
should know their place and sons should show unmitigated
respect and devotion toward their dads.
   There are few people in this harsh environment to
sympathize with.  We get the feeling that Schrader, and
novelist Banks before him, are eager to get this story to the
public as an antidote to feel-good movies like "Pleasantville"
and "The Truman Show," which celebrate the virtues of
small-town life.  This is to the good: an acerbic edge is
welcome if only to deconstruct the false homilies we've been
brought up to believe.  But despite fine performances and
ambient music to match the dismal milieu, "Affliction" is too
novelistic, dependent on outright narration, too much in the
principal character's head, and, thanks to Willem Dafoe's
opening narrative which gives away the design, too lacking in
suspense.

It has been said that men achieve a piece of immortality through their
children. Fathers and sons in particular are a uniquely bound pair,
having a historical precedent of patriarchal family living. Some sons
aspire to be the great men their fathers were, while others live under
the shadow of their father's legacy. In the case of Wade Whitehouse
(Nick Nolte), his father's legacy was one of drunken abandon, a legacy
which now frightens him in a very personal manner in Paul Schrader's
character drama AFFLICTION.
Wade, a character essayed in fine form by the accomplished Nolte, is a
man who's being sucked into a black hole of desperate living. His wife
(Mary Beth Hurt) left him, and due to his reckless lifestyle, has taken
their daughter (Brigid Tierney) with only minimal visitation rights. His
life is plagued by a multitude of minor problems which snowball into a
giant, aggrivating circumstance: his car's transmission is bad, he has a
toothache, he can barely afford to pay his lawyer, and he's frightened
to death of becoming the man his father is. 
His father (James Coburn), as we learn, beat him and his brother Rolfe
(Willem Dafoe) as children; the old man lives on now in a drunken stupor
of harmlessness. Yet the tensions between Wade and his father are now
greater than ever, due to a lifetime of silent confrontation. Nolte and
Coburn really accentuate this relationship, and through excellent
casting the father-son bond is truly authentic. Nolte, in particular,
offsets some of the horrible risks this film takes by wearing the
character of Wade like a second skin. 
Some of the risks that AFFLICTION takes pay off, and some do not. For
instance, center-wrapping the movie around the character of Wade pays
off because of Nolte's excellent work. Deviating from the conventional
plot structure and allowing Wade to simply hit bottom does not work.
Using a particular deer hunting accident to emphasize Wade's crooked
mind does work; attempting to turn the accident into a mystery and then
dropping it does not work. Also, the script suffers when it discards the
characters of Rolfe and Margie (Wade's love interest, played by Sissy
Spacek), for they are the stabilizers of Wade's life and the audience's
only sympathetic characters. 
In all, AFFLICTION is a dark and scary character study of the common
man. It has a very realist point of view, evident because the chain of
events is very plausible. And the atmosphere bears no hint of lightness.
This is a different kind of movie for a different kind of crowd.

Better bring an extra wrap with you to AFFLICTION, as the snowy New
Hampshire landscapes and the chilling story will likely send some
shivers up your spine.
Russell Banks, a master at creating character studies set in the frozen
north, has had his second novel in as many years adapted for the screen.
About a year ago, Atom Egoyan's adaptation of Banks's THE SWEET
HEREAFTER was number two on my best of the year list.  This time writer
and director Paul Schrader, whose previous pictures include LIGHT
SLEEPER and TOUCH, brings Banks's AFFLICTION to the screen.
In what would seem certain to be an Academy Award nominated performance,
Nick Nolte plays Wade Whitehouse, a policeman of sorts.  Actually, being
the small town's law enforcement officer is only one of his jobs.  He's
also the school crossing guard and a snowplow operator, and he's not
taken seriously as a cop.  Even his speeding tickets are liable to be
refused by the local scofflaws.
The story starts ominously on the night before the opening of deer
season.  Wade, who has been married twice to the same woman, is now a
divorced dad.  His daughter reluctantly accompanies him to a Halloween
party that night, but she soon begs to go home to mom, played by Mary
Beth Hurt, whom you probably will not recognize.
The next day, Wade's buddy, Jack Hewitt (Jim True), is hired to
accompany an out-of-town hunter, who is then killed in a hunting
accident.  Doubts about what really happened occur only to Wade, making
him persona non grata with the local establishment.
Attempting to resolve this mystery, if it is one, is half of the story.
The other, and more compelling aspect, is Wade's relationship with his
father, Glen, played in probably the best performance of his life by
James Coburn.
A violent alcoholic, who is so mean that he literally freezes his wife
to death, Glen has treated his family vilely all of his life.  Glen
apparently learned his family values from his father.  ("My old man was
a real man who didn't let women push him around.")  Glen is infamous
around the small town where they live, with people at bars still telling
stories about his abuse of his kids.
Nick Nolte, who usually plays strong, macho characters, shows us his
vulnerable side.  Although firmly rejecting his father's values, he has
the family demons flowing strong in his blood.  His drinking is getting
worse and his temper seems in danger of exploding.
To make matters worse for Wade, he has a horrible toothache throughout
most of the movie.  With no dentist appointments available, a red-faced
Wade claws at his face as if he will scrape his entire jaw away with his
bare hands, he is in so much pain.  Like the recent movie, INSOMNIA, in
which lack of sleep affected the detective's judgement, the toothache
begins to alter Wade's.
Wade's brother Rolfe (Willem Dafoe) believes that, when he was a child,
he successfully avoided his father, so he wasn't "affected."  Wade casts
doubts on his brother's claim.  At any rate, Rolfe is a teetotaler and
the family's Rock of Gibraltar, when he is around.  (He wisely left town
years earlier.)  Their sister, who appears briefly, is a born-again
Christian, a role that is relegated to caricature.
Dafoe is good but underused on the screen.  He is also the narrator,
which is the script's biggest mistake.  The narrator simply isn't
needed, and the lines he is given tend too often to turn a profound
scene into a trite one with the narration's pomposity.
Sissy Spacek has a wonderful small part as Wade's supportive girlfriend.
Spacek doesn't get much screen time, just enough to make you wish
directors would cast her more often.
Paul Sarossy's cinematography is stunning.  The snow and the gray skies
all have a dreary and foreboding steel-blue cast to them.  The
tragically sad movie contains some powerful performances.  While it
isn't quite in the same league as the last Russell Banks adaptation, it
is a marvelous and moving film in its own right.
AFFLICTION runs 1:53.  It is rated R for violence, profanity and one
scene of dope smoking.  The film would be fine for mature teenagers.

Wade Whitehouse is afflicted, but it is not a physical disease that ails
him, but rather it is the psychological and emotion scars of his childhood.
His detachment, distrust, and distorted perception are the result of
constant berating and beating in his formative years. As the oldest of the
siblings, he took it upon himself to intervene, and as a result, he was the
one who bore most of the wrath of his father. His younger brother Rolfe
learned early on (by avoiding the mistakes of Wade) how to avoid the abuse,
and has become a seemingly well-adjusted adult. Wade, however, was not so
lucky. He does not have a serious problem, but he is not able to maintain a
stable relationship. He want to wrest more visitation rights from his
ex-wife, but he is oblivious to the fact that his young daughter does not
enjoy the time she spends with him. A combination of events interact to push
Wade over the edge.
This film is similar in mood to "The Sweet Hereafter", another film based on
a novel by Russell Banks. Similar to that story, this one is filled with
symbolism -- from the bleak New Hampshire winter, to Wade's progressing
toothache. It provides an uncommon depth to the story. Nick Nolte gives a
fantastic performance as Wade by giving a subdued presentation of the
character, thus not relegating him to a simple psychotic. The viewer sees
all the events presented to Wade and can see how Wade's perspective is
causing him to potentially read too much into situations. Wade's childhood
abuse is made menacing by the fact that very little violence is shown, but
rather we only see its effects.
A common occurrence in child abuse cases is that sometimes a beating is so
severe (eg. broken bones) that medical attention is required. In order to
keep the abuse concealed from others, a lie is constructed. The ruse given
is that the injuries were caused by an accident, usually some type of fall.
The story suggests that one of the subtle scars that abuse victims carry is
a suspicion that events described as "accidents" may be actually be a cover
for more sinister events. This is often manifested at a subconscious level,
so even those who feel they have not been afflicted might miss this in
themselves.
Highly Recommended. This file features excellent writing, directing, and
acting. It will be enjoyed by viewers who like brooding, reflective
character studies.

Paul Schrader's "Affliction" is such an angry and bitter motion picture 
that you can almost physically feel the emotional coldness that is 
brewing under the surface of the two central characters who are living 
in the wintry, snowy landscape of New Hampshire: a brutal, insensitive 
father (James Coburn) whose shockingly heartless and cruel character 
traits seem to be rubbing off on his son, Wade Whitehouse (Nick Nolte), 
a small-town sheriff in his fifties.
As "Affliction" opens, it is Halloween night, although it certainly 
doesn't appear to be, as the entire town is covered in a heavy blanket 
of snow. Wade is taking his young daughter, Jill (Brigid Tierney), to a 
Halloween party, but before the night is over, the unhappy Jill has 
called her mother and Wade's ex-wife, Lillian (Mary Beth Hurt), to come 
and get her. Wade is outraged by this action and is fed up of being a 
stranger to his daughter, so much so that he becomes set on aquiring an 
attorney to start a custody battle. The following day, a hunting 
accident involving one of Wade's friends goes awry, leaving the other 
man, who slipped on the snow and ice and shot himself, dead. Although 
there is no evidence that would lead anyone to believe otherwise, Wade 
is convinced that there was a conspiracy to murder him, and that maybe 
even the mob is in on it. Finally, there is a love interest in Wade's 
life, Maggie Fogg (Sissy Spacek), an understanding and caring waitress 
who only wants to make Wade happy. From the first shot of Wade, it is 
obvious that he has an edgy temper, and as the film progresses, we are 
treated to glimpses of his traumatic childhood, as he was constantly 
bullied and terrorized by his abusive and emotionally wounding father. 
There are slight traces of his father in Wade, to be sure, and he knows 
it himself, but seems trapped, not only in his life, but in what is 
quickly becoming an inevitable transformation into his father, whom he 
desperately hates.
"Affliction" reminded me of an equally brilliant previous film from 
1998, "The Celebration," which dealt with many of the same topics, such 
as the hurtful wounds and hatred in a family. Based on a novel by 
Russell Banks, whose other book, "The Sweet Hereafter," was adapted 
superbly for the screen in 1997 by Atom Egoyan, "Affliction" is a 
superior piece of work and an enormous accomplishment for director Paul 
Schrader, who wrote such film classics as 1976's "Taxi Driver" and 
1980's "Raging Bull," and specializes in the underlying dark emotions of 
the human psyche.
One of the pleasures I always get from a motion picture like 
"Affliction," although the subject matter is difficult at times, is its 
multi-layered story. It would be easy enough to create a film about a 
man losing his grip with saneness, but it is completely another thing to 
create multiple subplots, such as the hunting accident mystery, which 
may just be part of Wade's deterioration; his relationship with his 
confused daughter; and his romantic involvement with Maggie. All of 
these elements smoothly come together to form an extraordinary tapestry 
of the human conditon, and a more affirming character study of Wade, who 
is not a bad man, but finds his grim future inescapable.
As Wade, Nick Nolte gives, perhaps, the best performance of the year. He 
is flawless throughout, and seamlessly is able to convey all of his 
character's feelings to the audience without spelling it out with words. 
Wade is heartbreaking because of the reality that he knows he is headed 
for, but doesn't want to go to, and Nolte is certainly up to the 
challenge. Meanwhile, James Coburn is hateful and even terrifying as 
Wade's father, and whenever he appeared on screen I was taken over by a 
deep sense of dread at what he might say or do. If an actor can make you 
believe he is as mean and sick of a human being as Coburn does, it is a 
sign of an exceptional performance. Lending fine support are Sissy 
Spacek, who was refreshing to see after a considerable absense from the 
screen lately, and in her portrayal of Maggie Fogg, we sympathize with 
her plight as she sees the man she loves slowly begin to turn into his 
nightmarish father. And as Jill, Wade's daughter, Brigid Tierney gives 
an amazing performance, for we believe that she is her character, a 
young girl in the middle of her love, and fear, of her own father, and 
her longing to be in the confines of the safety of her mother. The film 
is occasionally narrated by Rolfe, Wade's younger brother (Willem 
Dafoe), who is living far away but briefly makes an appearance a little 
over an hour into the film.
Adding to the effectiveness of the picture is the simple, yet perfectly 
realized, music score by Michael Brook, and the blustery, atmospheric 
cinematography by Paul Sarossy, which grows to become an effective 
metaphor for the isolation that appears between the characters.
As I watched "Affliction," I was not quite sure where everything was 
headed, and the masterfully-done climax caught me by utter surprise, and 
left me with feelings of uneasiness, which was entirely appropriate 
since the film was only staying true to itself. All of the plot threads 
never seemed false or out of place, and I never once doubted the 
reasoning and emotions of the characters. Paul Schrader not only shows 
his grand abilities of directing the film, but also for writing its 
remarkable screenplay, which, I doubt, could have been any better. 
"Affliction" is one of the most powerful and heartwrenching films of 
1998.

AFFLICTION (director: Paul Schrader; cast: Nick Nolte (Wade Whitehouse),
Sissy Spacek  (Margie Fogg), Jim True (Jack Hewitt), James Coburn (Glen
Whitehouse), Willem Dafoe (Rolfe Whitehouse), Mary Beth Hurt (Lillian),
Brigid Tierney (Jill), Holmes Osborne (Gordon LaRiviere), Sean McCann
(Evan Twombley), Steve Adams (Mel Gordon), 1998)
The opening scene paints a deceptively pretty postcard picture of this
small New Hampshire town, Lawford, covered with a late fall snow, as a
young school aged girl wearing a red Halloween mask, Jill (Brigid), is
guardedly speaking to her policeman/crossing guard father, Wade (Nolte),
asking him if he was bad as a child, doing Halloween pranks, as he
warily but unsuccessfully tries to respond to her in his car, as they
have just left his ex-wife's place, which is in another town about a 1/2
hour away, and are heading for a children's Halloween party he arranged
with his boss, the town selectman, Gordon LaRiviere (Holmes), especially
for her sake, even though she doesn't feel comfortable with the town or
with him. His former wife, Lillian (Mary Beth Hurt), who married him
twice and is now married to someone else, can no longer relate to him
and his angry mood swings.
After dropping Jill off at the party she doesn't want to be at, Wade
leaves the party being held at his police station, to go off smoking
some weed with his much younger friend and fellow snowplower for the
town, the complacent Jack Hewitt (True), who shares many of Wade's
feelings about the town they were both born in, but who is mostly pining
about his chance to play minor league baseball for the Bosox coming to
an abrupt end, and how he is now broke and everything seems to be
leading to a dead-end.
We soon see that Jill really does not enjoy the visitation she has with
her emotionally distraught father, even as she tells him that she loves
him, she still can't wait to get back home to her loving mother. A nasty
scene develops as Jill reacts to her unhappiness at being there, by
calling her mother and asking to be taken home, and when the mother
arrives with her husband, Wade goes slightly ballistic, scaring the hell
out of the child.
There is a voiceover, and the rich discernible voice of Willem Dafoe
(Rolfe) is heard, as he relates that this is a story about two brothers
who were afflicted by pain and violence by an abusive and alcoholic
father, Glen (Coburn), and this is the story as told from his point of
view, about the criminality of his brother and how it can be explained.
But for most of the film, it is through Wade's narrow focus that we see
what is taking place. We don't even get to see Rolfe until about after
an hour of the film has elapsed; but, even though he has distanced
himself from his family situation, teaching now at Boston University, he
keeps daily contact by phone with his older sibling, who rattles on
about his divorce, telling him that he is going to Concord to get a
lawyer, foolishly thinking he can get custody of the children, as he
also rants about his personal bitterness and the emotional difficulties
he is constantly having. Since Rolfe pictures himself as the survivor of
the family, the less physical of the two, he tries to help out Wade with
his more rational insights, grateful that his brother had acted as a
protector for him when they were growing up in a house with a demonic
father and an angelic mother, but a mother who seemed helpless against
the rages of her husband.
This is another Russell Banks novel based film that has been well-suited
for the big screen (a recent one was the more personally meditative, THE
SWEET HEREAFTER). AFFLICTION depicts how a man can go over the edge,
just lose it completely one day, and that there is nothing anyone can do
to prevent it. The inward turmoil of Wade is constantly being stirred by
all the disappointments he feels about himself and his memories which
are magnified by what he experiences daily in this small town.
Outwardly, we see how run down he has become, even if he has stopped
drinking. His constant toothache and not going to see a dentist, is
overworked symbolically into the story, but it does show how he is also
afflicted with physical pain that he can't readily handle, and how he,
eventually, painfully solves this problem, by pulling his aching tooth
out with a pair of pliers.
When Jack takes an influential visitor from Massachusetts (McCann) out
hunting, and he shoots himself by accident, Wade, backed up by his
brother's shared opinion, thinks that this isn't an accident, but
perhaps, a professional hit done by the mafia or by Jack, because the
visitor had enemies in his union. When Wade becomes obsessive about the
accident, ranting on to Jack and his boss about their part in the crime,
his brother tries to tell him that he was mistaken in thinking it was
anything other than an accident, that he should forget about it and just
concentrate on straightening out his own problems.
Wade's one chance for genuine affection, is with the local waitress,
Maggie (Spacek), who cares for him deeply and is willing to put up with
a lot of his unpleasantries because she knows his situation and how much
he has been hurt. There is the tragic visit she makes with Wade to his
parents' house, where he introduces her to his dad in a visit to check
on how his dad is doing, that is so draining for Wade, as she acts as a
buffer between him and his still verbally abusive elderly father. But
the visit ends upon the discovery that his mother froze to death because
his father failed to get anyone to fix the furnace.
Because we see the accident through Wade's neurotic eyes we are never
quite sure what it is we have seen, but by the time the movie winds down
and Wade unravels, we see how pervasive corruption is in this
economically depressed town, and we hope that Wade can move in that
direction to get the guilty culprits instead of chasing something he
might have imagined. But since this story is mostly a psychological
thriller, we are caught in the web of Nolte's very compelling
characterization, as he is someone who puts us into his shoes, so that
we can't help seeing what a tormented person he is, and are really
unsure for the time being whether a crime was committed or not, until by
the film's end, then everything seems to come into place, and we realize
how far gone Wade has become. Nolte is so good in this role, that we can
actually feel Wade's traumas reverberating within us.
The other standout performances come from Brigid Tierney, who almost
steals the film from the veteran actors Nolte and Coburn, because of how
genuine she comes across in her very pertinent role as a young child
having to distance herself from a father she is afraid to love. Coburn
is convincingly good as the cold-hearted father, who recognizes that his
older son has inherited his traits. His iconoclastic and memorable
portrayal of an abusive father, is very hard- hitting and original.
Holmes Osborne and Jim True look and act as if they stepped out of the
streets in rural New England, and were actually who they portrayed on
screen. Sissy Spacek was her usual sweet self. These characterizations
made the bleakness of the story delightfully credible and penetrating.
Living in a small New England town myself, I can attest to how uncannily
realistic the town and the people in it appeared to be.
Schrader (the director of TAXI DRIVER) is so uniquely suited to do this
type of film, as he makes the most of this absorbing look into these
troubled men' psyches, holding up a mirror of truth, to see if it is
still possible for those who are so troubled to see themselves in
someone else and to astutely ascertain what it is they are doing to
themselves. One of Wade's greatest fears was that he was becoming like
his father.
Creating a portrait of how a dysfunctional family is, without being
trite about it, is not that easy to accomplish, especially since this
kind of subject matter is old news by now. But this film accomplished
that by creating an edgy mood piece, that has to be watched carefully,
because it is filled with plenty of jewels for those who are willing to
dig them out in the dark spaces they are to be found in, where one man's
plight becomes something that can be so universally felt.
That is not to say that this film didn't have moments of reaching too
far afield and failing miserably, such as trying to make Wade out to be
a Christ figure, while as a crossing guard he freezes at not seeing his
daughter going to school and stretches his arms out in a crucified
position, as Mel Gordon (Adams) representing "new" money in town
disrespectfully speeds by him. That representation is not the Wade we
see for most of the film, the Wade who is the local good guy, willing to
get along with all the other locals, until he loses his equilibrium.
That is the more accurate portrayal of the volatile Wade, who is also
capable of taking someone's life and not capable of overcoming his
horrible childhood.

AFFLICTION (M).  
(Village Roadshow)
Director: Paul Schrader
Stars: Nick Nolte, James Coburn, Sissy Spacek, Willem Dafoe, Mary Beth 
Hurt, Jim True, Homes Osborne, Brigid Tierney, Marian Seldes, Sean McCann,
Wayne Robson, Brawley Nolte
Running time: 114 minutes.
Adapted from the novel by Russell Banks (The Sweet Hereafter,
etc), Affliction is a powerful, dramatic tale that looks at the
disturbing pattern of male violence, and explores how this brutal
legacy is often passed on from father to son.
The pathology of male violence is a theme common to much of
writer/director Paul Schrader's work (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Blue
Collar, etc), but rarely has it been tackled in such uncompromising
and potent style before.  Schrader seems to understand these
characters and their motivations, and his sympathetic and insightful
handling results in a compelling and hauntingly poignant character
study, that is both chillingly realistic and deeply disturbing.
Wade Whitehouse (Nick Nolte) is the sheriff of Lawford, a
depressed and sleepy New Hampshire hamlet.  Reduced to being little
more than a glorified traffic cop, he is increasingly frustrated by
his demeaning role.  He holds the job purely at the whim of the town's
corrupt and oily businessman (Homes Osborne).  Wade's impending
divorce grows ugly and bitter, the relationship between him and his
daughter grows more strained and distant, and a massive toothache is
causing him pain.  Wade turns a hunting accident into a murder
investigation, in an attempt to distract his attention away from the
real causes of his anger and frustration.
Wade's problems lie in his relationship with his father ('60's
action star James Coburn, cast largely against type).  For a long
time, the young Wade (played by Nolte's own son Brawley) absorbed the
full force of the brutal punishment dished out by his drunken, abusive
father, to protect his mother and younger siblings.  Younger brother
Rolph (Willem Dafoe, who provides the voice over narration) escaped
this brutal environment, but reluctantly returns home briefly
following the death of their mother.  The reunion is overshadowed by
the intimidating presence of their father and his violent legacy.  The
emotionally crippled Wade sees himself becoming more and more like his
father, and finally takes drastic action to exorcise his personal
demons and find salvation.
Affliction unfolds like a low burning fuse as it works its way
towards the inevitable explosion.  Nolte is superb as the put-upon
Wade who is slow to understand the true nature of his affliction.  In
one of his best, most heartfelt and moving performances in a long
time, he brings a sense of sympathy and compassion to his complex
character.
In his Oscar winning role, Coburn perfectly nails the abusive,
domineering, contemptuous and unforgiving father, who bemoans the loss
of real, hard men in a society growing soft.  He is a monstrous
figure, but somehow Coburn gives the character a surprisingly human
dimension and depth.  Sissy Spacek makes the most of her smaller role
as Wade's waitress girlfriend, who finally decides to leave this
volatile relationship before tragedy strikes.
Affliction explores many themes common to Banks' work -
dysfunctional families, psychologically damaged men, the tense
relationship between fathers and their children, small towns with dark
secrets, difficult moral dilemmas - all set against the coldness of an
unforgiving, snow covered landscape.  The harsh, wintry landscape is
almost a character in the story, and somehow adds to the chilling
atmosphere that pervades the film.
Like the recent American History X, Affliction is an important
film dealing with a serious theme, and deserves to be seen.  However,
this bleak film has proved difficult for its local distributors, who
clearly had no idea how to market it and were going to release it
straight to video.

'Affliction' is not as obvious a film as it may seem.  Besides showing
the inherited traits that are often passed down from father to son, this
film also strives to show one man weak enough to actually swallow that
theory whole.  His feeling of worthlessness, his dysfunctional life, his
incompetence on the job, and his ability to eventually alienate everyone
in his life he cares about but he manages to hang on to the one person
most detrimental to himself before things turn tragic and the course of
his life will be changed forever by the film's conclusion.
Nick Nolte as Wade Whitehouse, gives his finest performance to date as a
small town police officer in upstate New Hampshire who looks the other
way for his so-called friends, has an ex-wife who hates him, a young
daughter who finds him weird, and a girlfriend (Sissy Spacek) who tries,
unsuccessfully, to change him.  He drinks and while indications of the
film's description you may have read elsewhere may lead you to believe
that alcoholism is the inspiration for the film's title, the real
affliction is the monstrous behaviour burdened upon Nolte by his
brooding, violent, irresponsible and alcoholic father Glen (James
Coburn).  Coburn's portrayal is, in many ways, more scary than most
manufactured monsters shown in some of the most sinister horror and
science fiction films.  Uncaring, unloving and a human being with
absolutely no redeemable qualities, Coburn is one of the sharpest
supporting players seen in film in years and his character is so
realistic that it will haunt many long after they leave the theatre.
The film has narration by Wade's brother Rolfe (Willem Dafoe).  Dafoe
also has a small part as Wade's younger brother who leads a normal life
and despises the abyss his father and brother have fallen into.  He is a
successful school teacher and the remarks aimed at his family are less
than endearing.
'Affliction' is based on the novel by Russell Banks, the author of 'The
Sweet Hereafter' and the film is written for the screen and directed by
Paul Schrader who has worked on such screenplays for the movies as 'Taxi
Driver' and 'Raging Bull'.  Schrader's screenplays and in this case his
direction, looks abstract to the genuine concept of entertainment.  I
also had a similar criticism of 1998's 'A Simple Plan', which generated
a similar feeling as this film does.  Just because these films purport
to tell a story about the true condition of the human soul and how it
can be destroyed can make for fine film focus but they often have
limited entertainment value attached to them, especially with such a
downer ending, which they often contain.
To expand on the comments made about Nick Nolte and James Coburn, I must
say that I never expected them to be as perfect on screen as father and
son as they are in the finished product.  Coburn has always been an
under rated actor and has always managed to please in his employment as
a performer.  And what can you say about Nick Nolte?  A man with only
one Oscar nomination to his credit for 1991's 'The Prince of Tides',
this film could easily win Nolte an Oscar but it wouldn't be genuine
unless Coburn also wins.  Although there is only twelve years between
them in real life, they truly look like father and son on screen.  Nolte
should have received additional Oscar nominations in his career for work
in 'North Dallas Forty', 'Under Fire' and 'Weeds'.
The last thing that I can say about this film is that Nolte's
performance, while totally convincing and heartbreaking is also the
stuff that fits the first line of this review in so much that his
performance is not obvious.  For the first hour or so, his character is
rather sedated.  But we come to later realize that Wade Whitehouse is a
man who has in fact, bottled up his feelings for so long that when the
film concludes, we find that sometimes it's better to let your feelings
out rather than control them to the point where they build to the point
of eruption which is inevitable among human beings.

Affliction is based on a novel by Russell Banks, and has been adapted
for the screen and directed by Paul Schrader.  The film features
brilliant performances from Nick Nolte and James Coburn, but it suffers
from the inescapable burden of voice-over narration.  This is some of
the worst narration I've ever encountered -- it's ham-handed,
condescending, theme-spewing nonsense, provided by a peripheral
character as if he's the center of the film.  The film didn't engage me 
properly, and this is why.
After all, Nolte's performance has finally proven to me that he's a
good actor, not just an annoying bundle of machismo (which is what I
thought of him until very recently).  He plays Wade Whitehouse, a
small-town rent-a-cop employed by the city.  We follow him through his
trifling, pathetic life.  His ex-wife (Mary Beth Hurt) thinks he's a
wreck, and they have a daughter whom he only sees on the weekends.  And
he's romantically involved with Margie Fogg (Sissy Spacek), a local
woman who sees something in him that no one else does.  
On the first day of deer hunting season, a rich member of the community
ends up dead; the only witness is Jack Hewitt (Jim True), Wade's partner
and friend.  Jack says that it was an accident, that the man was clumsy
and shot himself.  Wade doesn't quite believe him, and begins to
construct an insane plot in which his boss, Gordon (Holmes Osborne), has
sold out to a big corporation in order to take over the town.  Woven
through all this is character background on Wade -- his alcoholic father
(James Coburn), and his abusive behavior towards Wade and his brother,
Rolfe (Willem Dafoe).
Affliction is certainly not a bad film, even though there were points
during which I was so frustrated that I wanted to walk out of the
theater.  It does, after all, feature two of the best performances of
the year.  Schrader also makes some interesting artistic choices; the
film has a cold, ominous tone.  We get the feeling that the characters
are always on the edge of their feelings, as if the slightest change
might destroy their lives.  There are many wonderful shots throughout
the picture, such as a pair of headlights moving slowly through the
white landscape of early-evening.  
But Schrader is also responsible for the film's overall failure.  It
seems that one of the main problems with adapting a novel into a film is
that so much information must be converted from exposition.  Atom
Egoyan, who adapted Banks' The Sweet Hereafter, managed to get all the
important information from the book onto the screen without resorting to
flashbacks and voice-overs.  Schrader, however, has taken the easy way
out.  Instead of letting us imagine the horror Wade and Rolfe go through
with their father, he shows it to us in grainy, manipulative
flashbacks.  Whose flashbacks are they?  Well, we assume they're Wade's,
although they play more like a horrific home video with no real
point-of-view.
This brings me to the film's central flaw, which is Rolfe's voice-over
narration.  The narration opens and closes the film, and can be heard in
various parts throughout.  In the opening shots, Rolfe explains to us
what's going to happen to Wade.  In the concluding sequences, he tells
us what's wrong with Wade.  He spells out to us the theme -- the way a
father's abuse can ruin a child -- so explicitly that I almost wondered
why Schrader had bothered making the film at all.  On one level, it's
interesting to see the way Rolfe denies the fact that he, too, was
"afflicted by that man's violence" (as he puts it), but the mere
presence of the narration is both insulting and frustrating.  I'd
imagine that Banks framed the novel this way, but it seems clear that
Schrader should have changed this in the interest of cinema.
Thankfully, Nolte and Coburn are present to hold the picture together. 
We get a sense of Wade's desperation, and we realize his desire to
actually be someone -- to have a purpose in his life.  Nolte subtly
conveys the developments through skillful acting, making me wish
Schrader had just trusted us to get what we need from his performance. 
Coburn is also fascinating as the abusive father, especially in his last
scene, when it seems that the entire purpose of his life was to turn
Wade into a mean son of a bitch.  
But I was sidetracked, even with the power of these two performances. 
I didn't sympathize with the characters the way I should have, mostly
because of Schrader's ill-advised and baffling direction.  Affliction is
a story about Wade, a pathetic man who lies to himself.  It's not a
story about Rolfe, Wade's sound-minded brother, who gazes on the
situation without the objectivity he thinks he has.  I don't know why
Schrader chose to frame the picture through Rolfe's eyes, but, in doing
so, he has wronged a perfectly good story, and a couple of perfect
performances.

Writer: Paul Schrader (based on the novel by Russell Banks)
Starring: Nick Nolte, Sissy Spacek, James Coburn, Willem Dafoe, Brigid 
Tierney, Jim True, Holmes Osborn, Mary Beth Hurt, Marian Seldes, Sean 
McCann, Wayne Robson
It's easy to see some of the more prominent themes that hover over every 
single Paul Schrader script (or film): that of a man, seen as strong by 
others, is in fact crippled by a paralyzing pyschological handicap. In 
his most famous (and best) script, "Taxi Driver," Travis Bickle is a man 
haunted not only by Vietnam and maybe a bad childhood (both alluded to 
but never dealt with up front), but also by his present inadequacy to 
assimilate with society. In "Raging Bull" (co-written with Mardik 
Martin), Jake LaMotta is a powerful boxer who's plagued with jealousy 
and petty sexual anxiety. Even in "The Last Temptation of Christ," he 
shows Jesus as a man with a giant burden on his back, supposed to be 
some kind of reluctant martyr. "Affliction," his newest written AND 
directed film (others include "American Gigolo," "Mishima," and "Light 
Sleeper"), Schrader presents us with a man named Wade Whitehouse, a 
divorced, alcoholic small-town cop. Nick Nolte, usually a symbol of 
strong masculinity, plays Wade as a man beaten down by life, incredibly 
weary, and foolishly optimistic about the future.
In the film's first scene, Wade drives his estranged young daughter Jill 
(Brigid Tierney) to a halloween party in his town, and though she 
clearly doesn't want to go, Wade ignores it and assures her she'll have 
a good time. After abandoning her with people she doesn't even know, he 
goes out for a quick smoke, and when he comes back in he finds that 
she's called her mother (Mary Beth Hurt) and asked her to come pick her 
up. This scene is masterful for several reasons: a) it easily sets up 
the characters, not by telling about their past lives, but by 
demonstrating it through human action; b) it has no real direction, and 
feels to flow like an improvistational section of life; and c) it sets 
the stage for what's to come.
There are two intertwining stories going on here, and the first one 
begins shortly after, concerning a hunting accident where a notoriously 
wealthy man (Sean McCann) was shot to death in the presence of Jack (Jim 
True), a friend of Wade's. Not known to do much actual police work (even 
when handing out a speeding ticket, he gets it thrown back in his face), 
he decides to be a little suspicious of what happened, and suspects fowl 
play, even if it does involve a good pal of his. Soon, he discovers what 
may be a big conspiracy involving his other employer (Holmes Osborn), 
even if others tell him nothing is going on.
The second story takes off around the same time, involving his father 
(James Coburn), a stern, gruff, obnoxious sonofabitch who's been drunk 
most of his life and is notorious around the town for beating his sons 
up (Coburn, usually not much of a dramatic actor, here is absolutely 
riveting and brilliant). He's been so bad that his daughter is a 
characateured born-again Christian, and his other son (Willem Dafoe) has 
long since left the town and become a college professor. Visiting him 
one day with his girlfriend (Sissy Spacek), he finds him asleep in his 
chair and his long-suffering mother dead of cold in her bed. Broken 
furnace, dad tells him. Wade takes care of the funeral arrangements, and 
prepares to sell his father's house which means he has to live with him, 
even if his dad is still a sonofabitch - a decrepit, miserable old man 
who still drinks too much and bitches about how things aren't like they 
used to be, "when women knew their place."
Along with his constant troubles with his daughter, whose emotions 
juxtapose between love and fear, Wade's life slowly begins to implode. 
Things get out of hand. Nightmarish flashbacks sift through his mind. 
And he has a toothache and can't get a dentist's appointment. Like 
Travis Bickle, Wade Whitehouse is tortured by everything that he can't 
be, but at the same time, is shown that he is in full responsibility of 
his actions. When he attempts to reopen the divorce so that he can 
change the custody precedings, we know that it'll only make matters 
worse, and that his ex-wife, who despises him as it is, will despise him 
a little more. And slowly, he begins to lose touch with everyone around 
him, even his girlfriend, whom we're not sure is with him because she 
honestly loves him or feels pathos for his difficult life. As Wade, Nick 
Nolte is a pile of fear and defeat but with a smidge of hope, and the 
latter his often is undoing in the situations he gets himself into. He's 
constantly told by everyone around him that the shooting was an 
accident, and that even if it wasn't, he should let it go, but he can't 
help himself.
Paul Schrader expertly shows us the pain he has to live with, the 
anguish he feels when he looks in his daughter's eyes and sees 
resentment, and the misery of having been beaten by and living with a 
father who doesn't care for him one bit. His well-deserved temper often 
explodes in fits of anger that are caught right at the second they've 
erupted, and we just know that at some point, he's going to finally 
explode in a fit of monumentous anger from supressing his anger for so 
long. Nolte and Schrader are so good at capturing the mixed emotions of 
the character and the audience of this character that for his character 
alone, this film is a triumph, not as classic and masterful as, say, 
"Taxi Driver" or "Raging Bull," but pretty close. This film has been 
based on a novel by Russell Banks, the same guy who penned "The Sweet 
Hereafter," directed by Atom Egoyan, which is probably one of the best 
films I've ever seen, and like that film, "Affliction" has a cold and 
sad feel to it, that of loss and pain (great cinematography, too, Paul 
Sarossy). But while Egoyan's film was masterful and lyrical, this one is 
more blunt and to-the-point, and in some ways more effective but for the 
most part, not as. Both contain the weird, occasional pop up of 
eccentric humor and instances, like the presence of people in 
wheelchairs who are not more than brief cameos, or unique small town 
mannerisms.
But "Affliction" does have some real problems. The worst part of the 
film is easily and without a doubt its use of narration, done by Dafoe's 
prodigal brother character, who shares his thoughts about the themes, 
especially in the final minutes. There's a couple movies that I'd like 
to re-edit and take things out of, just to make them as good as they 
possibly could be, and mine would be to delete the final minutes of this 
film. It has such a great ending there, but then it goes on, explaining 
more than it has to, and discussing the themes, a no-no if you're making 
a film where the themes are strong, multiple, and even ambiguously 
placed, like they are in this one.
In fact, the final narration deserves major reprimanding because it 
takes the story of Wade, such a great story, and turns it into a 
message-film, preaching against the way fathers beat their sons, because 
it lives on into further generations. Yawn. We already knew that, right? 
But take it out, or flat-out ignore it, like I suggest (even leaving a 
couple minutes early would suffice, and you'll know when to leave), and 
it's a fantastic movie. Haunting. Saddening. Deeply emotional. After 
all, all of Wade's problems cannot possibly stem back to beatings, but 
further instances, and the best thing to do is to show what he's like 
now, and allow us to see what has affected him and how he deals with 
them now. Wade's such an interesting character and so complex that this 
is too good a film to be reduced to an exercise. But I'm almost willing 
to ignore it, and pay most attention to the rest of the film (even the 
opening narration isn't totally horrible - it at least sets the story up 
for a tragic fall, making Wade's attempts to claw out of the inevitable 
even more profound, as if he had forseen it all already), which is so 
good and so effortlessly powerful that it's a shame to see it mucked up.

As any sociologist will attest, your childhood and the types of
parents that you have will heavily influence your happiness as an
adult.  Parents that are supportive and environments that are
nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms
that can allow them to live healthy and productive lives.  But if your
upbringing is marred with violence, hate and dysfunctionality, then
your journey towards a happy adulthood will be saddled with
psychological obstacles almost too great to overcome.  `Affliction'
explores how a man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly
nightmarish childhood.
The man in question is Wade Whitehouse (Nick Nolte).  Here is a man
who is like any other citizen on the surface.  He is a productive
member of the community and goes about his daily routine much like you
and me.  But as you scratch beneath the surface, something scary and
evil begins to rear its ugly head.  We see that he is a mean-tempered
person.  He has a hard time taking control of his emotions, which
usually gets the better of him.  He is quick to apologize for his
actions and wants to be a gentle person, but something is sparking a
tendency towards violence.  He also has tremendous problems with
relationships.  He is divorced and his only connection to love is his
daughter.  But his bearish persona and stature alienates her.  He is
visibly shaken by her rejection even though she says that she loves
him.  His demeanor also puts his relationship with a local townsgirl
(Sissy Spacek) at risk.  She tries to remain true to him and
supportive, but for women unlucky enough to attach themselves to this
kind of person, relationships will ultimately end like sentences
ending with an exclamation point.  Finally, he is spiteful and
vindictive.  As a rejected father, he initiates a custody battle that
seems hopeless.  As the town's only police officer, he issues a
speeding ticket to a man whose father has just died.  We can see that
this is a man that is both afflicted and living with pain.  He is a
prisoner and a slave to it.  He is moving towards a level of madness
and insanity that defies comprehension.   What kind of force can move
a man to the edge of his emotions and beyond the reach of people who
genuinely care for him?
We learn that the answer is his father (James Coburn).  This is the
kind of father that every son would be ashamed to have and that any
woman would be afraid to meet.  He is an overbearingly misogynistic
and frequent drunk who rules with an iron fist.  We see his tyrannical
behavior through flashbacks.  To heighten the father's churlishness,
the flashbacks are shown as home video footage taken by a very
frightened person.  Very effective.  Today, Wade's dad is quite
elderly, but still manages to instill fear into a grown man.  The
influence that the father possesses is inescapable, and its unsavory
effect clamps down hard on the tortured Wade.  The result is every
son's nightmare  becoming like the father that one has always dreaded
to be. 
This is a terrifically presented piece of psychological drama, and
Nolte turns in a strong performance as a man whose pain seems to
become a detriment as well as a necessity.  He's a hulking person who
is still reduced to whimpers when in the presence of his father. 
Coburn displays heft as the bitter dad.  But, it's most certainly not
Saturday-night-friendly fare.  There's nothing light or fluffy about
this film.  That may turn many moviegoers away.  But it's certainly
worth noting that this is a well-acted drama showcasing Nolte's and
Coburn's raw acting talents.

Nick Nolte encapsulates the weary, average working man beautifully in a raw,
bristling performance in Paul Schrader's latest exercise in machismo,
"Affliction." Nolte is so ideal in this role that it becomes iconic - his bulky
physique and dark, cropped hair remains the most frustrating character of
suburban domesticity since Jack Nicholson's Bobby Dupea in "Five Easy Pieces." 
Nolte stars as Wade Whitehouse, a born loser in a small town in New Hampshire.
He is the sheriff, a schoolbus crossing guard, and performs some chores for a
local, hot-headed businessman. He is also a rotten husband and father who
doesn't have an inkling of how to treat his unctuous daughter. His ex-wife
(Mary Beth Hurt) hates him, his straight-arrow brother (Willem Dafoe) abandoned
him and the family, his father (James Coburn) doubly hates him, and the whole
town seems to have no respect for him. 
The only one he has left to support him is his girlfriend, a kindhearted and
loyal waitress named Margie (Sissy Spacek). Margie is a name synonymous with
any small-town tale. Wade does find an avenue of restoring some respect and
dignity when an accidental shooting occurs in the woods. He feels there is a
conspiracy, a cover-up dealing with the building of a ski resort. He becomes
more resourceful, and just as pathetic. 
He beats people, drags his daughter around like a rag doll, tries to sue his
ex-wife for custody of the daughter, and gives a speeding ticket to a grieving
son whose father has just died. Wade is convinced that the conspiracy, which
has riled up the town, will make him respectable. 
The underlying story in "Affliction" is Wade's relationship to his domineering
father - both are virile yet weak men with no other agenda than to abuse. Wade
is afflicted by his father's abusive past, shown in hand-held grainy footage
with a dark-haired Coburn spouting all kinds of obscenities. It is his
childhood and his mother's untimely death that drives Wade closer and closer to
the brink of madness. 
"Affliction" does not have the degree of depth of Paul Schrader's other
machismo portraits, such as "Raging Bull" or "Taxi Driver." Somehow, we see the
weaknesses and afflicted behavior of Wade, but we rarely get close to the
demons tearing him apart. In one shattering scene, he pushes his father against
a wall, threatening to kill him if he gets close to Margie. Another scene has
him pulling his bad tooth out of his mouth and shedding a tear. They are
individual moments of isolated violence, but they do not make for a cohesive,
full-bodied portrait. 
This has a well-rounded cast, including Nolte's raw, hard-edged personality
that still makes the character unforgettable, despite the ambiguities. There is
also James Coburn, in perhaps the finest, shrewdest performance of his career,
as the monstrous, unredeeming father with a cold, heavy heart - he does have
one moment where he appears dejected after his wife's death, though there is
nothing remotely sympathetic about this man. 
Mary Beth Hurt brings a warm glow to this brutally cold landscape as the
ex-wife. She has a stirring scene where she speaks kindly about Wade's dear old
mother (while 'Ases Death' from "Peer Gynt" plays on the soundtrack) - a
beautiful, poignant moment. Sissy Spacek is nicely understated as the patient
Margie, who finds that Wade can be too much to bear. 
"Affliction" has some dark, heavy blues in its cinematographic look that
embodies the snowy environment in Russell Banks' novel - he also wrote "The
Sweet Hereafter." The performances are solid and powerful. But it's Wade's lack
of logic and unmotivated actions that may leave viewers straining to put up
with him and his afflictions.

 Affliction is as depressing and cold as its New Hampshire winter setting.
 Starring Academy Award-nominee Nick Nolte and Oscar winner James Coburn,
this tale of a violent, dysfunctional family is powerful, disturbing
filmmaking.
 But what can you expect when you have a movie directed by Paul Schrader,
who adapted a novel by Russell Banks.
 Wade Whitehouse (Nick Nolte), is the police officer in Lawford, a small,
economically depressed town where nothing really ever happens. Wade's job
consists mostly of clearing the snow off the roads and acting as the school
crossing guard.
 Wade is a man who keeps his fury and frustrations bottled. He is in the
midst of a custody battle with his ex-wife and even at this stage in his
life he cannot stand up to his abusive, alcoholic father.
 An eruption is imminent, and its catalyst is the shooting death of a New
England big shot in what is supposed to be a hunting accident.
Wade, though, sees conspiracy and sets out to prove that the man's death
was murder.
 Yet, the crime is really a secondary issue to Schrader.
 Affliction is about a man who gets "to feeling like a whipped dog" that
someday is "going to bite back."
 And circumstances are bringing that day nearer.
 Despite the love and comfort of Margie (Sissy Spacek), a waitress in a
local restaurant, Wade cannot find peace.
 He feels that if he can prove that a murder was committed and solve it, he
will regain the respect of his daughter, the townspeople and, most of all,
his father.
 Coburn is Wade's father, Glen, a bully and a man who breathes violence
like the rest of us breathe air. He is abusive physically and mentally and
is non-repentent about his actions or lifestyle.
 Coburn gives a brutal performance as Glen, a bitter drunk who only knows
how to express himself with his fists. He spares no one. Glen is a monster,
yet the joy of Coburn's performance is that you feel some pity for this man
even though you should feel nothing but hate. His Oscar was deserved.
 Nolte gives the performance of his career. He is a walking mound of rage,
exploding suddenly, then subsiding and apologizing like a little boy caught
stealing money from his mother's purse.
 His Wade is a poignant, troubled man living in a climate of self-doubt
created by his overbearing father.
 But the real star of Affliction is Schrader. In films such as Blue Collar
and Hard Core, he has created individuals who are outsiders, men who have
difficulty connecting with the society around them.
 An air of bleakness and tragedy hangs over Affliction. Like most of
Schrader's works, it is not a feel-good movie, but it is powerful
moviemaking from a man who has mapped the darkest terrain of the human
soul.
 Affliction is filled with despair, hopelessness and excruciating losers.
You would not want to spend any time with these people, but watching them
try to connect is a painfully fascinating experience.
 Affliction will make you uncomfortable, make you squirm. And you will
emerge from the theater saddened. And that is the power of Schrader's work.

        With a definition like that, you know from the get-go that "Affliction" 
isn't going to be a walk in the park.  And with a screenwriter like Paul 
Schrader ("Taxi Driver," "Raging Bull") at the helm, plus Russell Banks' 
("The Sweet Hereafter") searing novel providing the source material, 
it's even less likely that the film is going to serve as anyone's idea 
of "light entertainment."
        In the last several years, filmmakers have used the white stuff, the 
cold, harsh grip of midwinter, as a backdrop for some emotionally 
intense psychological dramas.  Films like "Fargo," Atom Egoyan's 
afore-mentioned "The Sweet Hereafter" and, most recently, "A Simple 
Plan" have all been set in some distant, desolate place where the sun 
barely shines.  It's a familiar sight: our protagonists crunching 
through freshly fallen snow, looking like alien beings with their woolen 
hats pulled down tightly about their ears, oversized mittens rendering 
their fingers immobile, their huge coats flapping in the icy Arctic 
wind.
        "Affliction" is the latest addition to the cold winter drama, and once 
again the snow and the ice lend the film a certain dignity, reminding us 
unequivocally that bad things happen in bad weather.
        Set in the upstate New Hampshire neighborhood of Lawford, "Affliction" 
focuses on the character of Wade Whitehouse, a man with one humdinger of 
a toothache.  Born and raised in the economically depressed town, Wade 
functions as Lawford's solitary law enforcement officer, but is often 
relegated to acting as school crossing guard or performing odd jobs for 
a local entrepreneur.
        A struggling alcoholic, Wade is separated from his wife Lillian (an 
unrecognizable Mary Beth Hurt) and trying to maintain a relationship 
with his teenage daughter, whose line "I love you Dad, but I just want 
to go home" summarizes a lot of the pain experienced by children 
embroiled in bitter custody battles.  Wade is all too aware of 
parent-child conflicts, having been raised by an abusive, drunken father 
(James Coburn), whom he occasionally visits at the crumbling family 
farm.
        When a prominent businessman is accidentally shot and killed on the 
first day of the deer hunting season, Wade suspects foul play, and sees 
the investigation as an opportunity to re-establish himself in the eyes 
of the disillusioned community.
        "Affliction" is a bleak, downbeat tale with few rays of light or hope.  
As Wade, a man on the emotional edge, Nick Nolte turns in a powerhouse, 
OscarŽ-nominated performance that is sometimes sensitive, often times 
brimming with intensity.  Coburn also received a nomination for his fine 
work here.
        Willem Dafoe (from Schrader's "Light Sleeper") as Wade's brother Rolfe, 
who has escaped Lawford for an arguably better life, narrates the tale, 
sparingly.  Sissy Spacek--where's she been hiding all these years?--is 
excellent as Wade's beleaguered girlfriend, Margie Fogg.  Also worthy of 
mention is Paul Sarossy's cinematography--Sarossy shot "The Sweet 
Hereafter"--and Michael Brooks' somber score that never outplays its 
welcome.
        As the barn burns and Wade pours himself another drink, we're left with 
the disturbing image that we are what our parents taught us, how their 
emotional and psychological abuse can diminish our capacity to love and 
to be loved as human beings.  In Wade Whitehouse's case, that is the 
deepest, darkest definition of "Affliction."

Affliction takes a man with a messed up life and tears it to shreds. 
>From the opening of Affliction you know that this is not a Hollywood-type
film. The mellow opening with its seemingly still pictures of a quiet town
is a masterful way of settling the audience into the groove of the film.
And it also serves to start the film off on a happy note  a note that
doesn't last long in Affliction. As the film goes on, we hear an eerie
narration done by Willem Dafoe. 
Rolfe Whitehouse (Willem Dafoe) narrates and speaks about his brother, Wade
(Nick Nolte), who is the policeman in a small town. Rolfe lives in Boston
and is not the main character of Affliction. Wade is the focus of the film.
Wade is a loser, plain and simple. He's a man who's taken all the wrong
turns in life  many times taking the wrong turns twice. Wade and Rolfe
grew up as abused kids -- taking both verbal and physical abuse from their
father (James Coburn). Wade was more affected than Rolfe.
Wade's troubles include a job he hates, a daughter from his divorce that
hates him, and a dad who lives too close and is still quite abusive. Wade
does have better parts in his life, like his girlfriend Margie (Sissy
Spacek). As the film moves on, the troubles start to compound on Wade. The
flashpoint of the trouble start when Wade's friend Jack takes a rich man
out deer hunting. Something goes wrong and the rich man is killed. Jack
says it was an accident, Wade thinks different.
Though the death is the flashpoint, it is not the focus of the film. The
film concentrates on the characters. Wade being the biggest of them and
later on in the film Wade's dad is added. These two characters are so well
written that the film would have been engrossing even with out the hunting
accident. What we see is that abuse comes in vicious cycles  as we can see
how the cycle goes from Wade's father to Wade.
I'm not accustomed to seeing Nolte in dramatic roles, so it took me a
little to get used to him as Wade. But, once I accepted him as Wade,
Nolte's performance was brilliant. Nolte was able to make me sympathetic to
him throughout the film  which at points was hard since as the film
progresses, his character becomes more and more withdrawn from reality. The
character of Wade is what characters in Hollywood should be like. Fleshed
out and well-written, Wade shows that a movie doesn't have to rely solely
on special effects to be engaging.
Coburn as Wade's father is one of the scariest, most unpredictable
characters in the film  and in recent memory. Coburn turns in a
wonderfully textured performance as Wade's father.
The one small thing that felt out of place in Affliction was a short car
chase in the middle of the film. Is it some sort of requirement to have a
chase in every movie? But, this is a small shortcoming when looking at the
film as a whole.
The script by Paul Schrader is wonderful in its characterizations.
Schrader, working off of Russell Banks' novel, gives us characters that we
can follow and feel for. Schrader has put together a film that studies the
lives of many people and shows us what consequences come from their
actions. He humanizes Wade, a man who is spiraling down to an unknown point.
Affliction is not a happy film. It is depressing and gloomy by the end.
But, at the end we come to understand what it is like to be a man who has
made all the wrong turns in life and ends up at a point where there's no
turning back. Director/writer Paul Schrader has put together a character
study that will haunt the audience. Kudos to Schrader for not putting
together a Hollywood-type happy film and going his own way while making
Affliction. I read in an article where James Coburn says that Affliction
will not be a film that will have people lining up to see it. I agree that
this film with its limited distribution will not have people lining up to
see it. But, Affliction is a Don't Miss film. If you miss Affliction in the
theatres, Don't Miss it on video.

     I don't blame Paul Schrader for thinking he could get away with
voice-over narration where so many others had failed.  After all, he did
set the standard for ideal use of the device when he let us into the mind
of Travis Bickle in TAXI DRIVER.  Every once in a while, a talented writer
will figure out just when he can get away with the narration crutch, and
for what purpose.  Schrader forgot those things while adapting Russell
Banks' AFFLICTION.  Working with all the elements for a raw dramatic
masterwork, he appears unclear how to tell the story through to its
conclusion.  And in a fit of panic, he turns the final minutes of the film
into a mess of ham-fisted plot summary and perplexing epilogue.
     It's a crying shame, because the set-up for AFFLICTION is so utterly
compelling.  Nick Nolte stars as Wade Whitehouse, a lifetime resident of a
small New Hampshire town.  Recently divorced, Wade spends his days as a
civil servant -- running the snowplow and serving as crossing guard --
while also acting as the town's lone part-time cop.  He's trying to put
his life back together, even beginning a new relationship with a long-time
friend named Marge (Sissy Spacek), but his life has been permanently
scarred by his abusive, alcoholic Pop (James Coburn).  The death of his
mother brings Wade back into his father's house, rekindling long-buried
emotions just when his suspicions of foul play in a recent hunting
accident have him on edge.
     The heart, soul and twisted guts of AFFLICTION lie in Nick Nolte's
performance as Wade, as beaten-down a human being as the screen has ever
seen without turning him into a "lovable loser."  Whipped into a
psychological submission by his Pop, Wade crawls through life on his belly
-- working menial jobs at the whim of a town Selectman (Holmes Osborne),
feared and abandoned by his ex-wife and daughter because he has abandoned
them emotionally, taunted by a wealthy man to whom he tries to serve a
traffic ticket.  Afraid of turning out anything like his father, Wade
absorbs every bit of pain for fear that releasing it will cause him to
lose control.  He's tragic and pathetic and doomed, and Nolte nails him.
     Schrader, on the other hand, doesn't seem convinced that he has
nailed Wade.  The film opens with narration by Wade's younger brother
Rolfe (Willem Dafoe), narration which appears at irregular intervals.
Initially, the narration is simply florid and unnecessary; later, it
begins to repeat entire scenes just completed, as though afraid we might
have just walked in from the lobby and missed something.  Finally, the
narration becomes absolutely insufferable, summing up every theme from the
previous two hours in a few tidy sentences that makes you wonder why you
spent your time with Wade instead of his self-appointed shrink.  That
narration is part of an attrocious conclusion that nearly ruins the film,
tagging on explanations of much that has gone before and some that comes
after.  Either Schrader ran out of money to show us all this significant
material, or he ran out of ideas regarding how to do it.  
     Perhaps such a gaping hole in the resolution of the protagonist's
story should have ruined the film, but there's too much else that works in
AFFLICTION.  Cinematographer Paul Sarossy, who captured Russell Banks'
winter mindscapes previously in THE SWEET HEREAFTER, captures a sense of
chilly isolation, and the supporting cast -- notably Coburn's casually
emasculating turn as Pop -- is solid top to bottom.  There's an ache at
the core of AFFLICTION as painful as the rotting tooth that, in a
Shakespearean display of psychic corruption manifested through physical
corruption, torments Wade through much of the film.  There will also be an
ache in the head of many viewers, as Schrader spends the film's critical
final minutes beating them with a Moral to the Story that anyone able to
add single-digit numbers should comprehend unassisted.  It may have worked
for Travis Bickle, but here Schrader's use of narration nearly trumps
Nolte's triumph.  It's enough to make an edgy critic ask, "Are you _still_
talkin' to me?"

Paul Schrader's adaptation of the Russell Banks novel is just as bleak
as 1997's justly celebrated Banks adaptation, Atom Egoyan's
_The_Sweet_Hereafter_, but, unlike with that haunting masterpiece,
something's amiss.  It's not in the acting: Nick Nolte delivers a
terrifically nuanced performance as Wade Whitehouse, the reigning police
officer in a small New England town; even more memorable is a frightening
James Coburn as Wade's alcoholic father, whose physical abuse of his son
as a child--or, rather, its psychological after-effects--is the
"affliction" that Wade continues to suffer from.  Neither is there
anything at fault on a technical level, boasting superior cinematography
by Paul Sarossy, who also shot _The_Sweet_Hereafter_.
What's crucially missing is a strong emotional connection, the
development of which is hampered by Schrader's glacial pacing, which
picks up by the third act, only to end rather abruptly.  The film lacks a
knockout punch because of the familiarity of the whole"violence begets
violence" premise, and Schrader doesn't go in any particularly new
direction with it.  Even so, the powerful performances by Nolte and
Coburn make the film well worth a look, even if they are part of a
less-than-developed whole.

One of the most frightening occurrences in nearly every adult's life happens
in front of the bathroom mirror. While shaving or applying lipstick, you'll
catch a glimpse out of the corner of your eye. One of your parents is staring
at you from behind the glass.
Most people's childhood memories of their parents are of ancient people in
their thirties or forties. When the child reaches that age, his self-image is
rarely that...then there's that vision in the mirror.
While we may be fated to look like our parents, we don't have to become them
if we don't want to. Most of the time, though, DNA isn't all that's replicated
in children.
Small town cop Wade Whitehouse (Nick Nolte) hates his abusive alcoholic father
Glen (James Coburn), yet every day Wade becomes more and more Glen. Although
the broken-down man is on his last legs, he dominates his son's life.
Wade is stuck in a dead-end job in a dead-end town. He's primarily a school
crossing guard and his other part-time job consists of running errands.
He's destroyed two marriages to the same woman. His young daughter assures him
that she loves him, but doesn't want to spend time with him.
Wade's one place of refuge is with girlfriend Margie (Sissy Spacek), a
waitress at the local diner. He's unconsciously working on sabotaging this
relationship, himself.
He sees a chance to change all of this when a wealthy visiting union official
is killed deer hunting. It's ruled a hunting accident, but Wade uncovers clues
that it might be a mob hit.
Until the end, it's uncertain whether it was an accident or Wade is onto the
truth. Maybe he's finally gone off the deep end. It's possible he's created
this drama to take his mind off his own desperation.
The film is less about the mystery than it is about Wade. It paints a vivid
portrait of a man struggling with overwhelming personal failures. To top it
all off, he has a toothache that won't stop.
Nolte is astonishing in the role. He transcends "Nick Nolte" and becomes Wade.
It's no wonder that he won New York Film Critics and National Society of Film
Critics awards and was nominated for an Oscar.
The casting of Coburn is inspired. The two look and act enough alike that it's
easy to believe they are related. His Supporting Actor Oscar is well-deserved.
Screenwriter/director Paul Schrader is in touch with males on the verge of
madness. His scripts for "Taxi Driver" and "Raging Bull" lead directly into
this one.
The film is filled with chilling scenes. As in Fargo, the town is
constantly snow-covered. Released widely during the first week of spring when
the audience is yearning for warmer weather, the movie is a reminder of the
long hard winter just past.
Some events are archetypal of dysfunctional families. Brother Rolfe (Willem
Dafoe) who escaped by leaving town, denies childhood incidents ever happened.
Glen seems to have been abused by _his_ father. After Wade pulls a man over
the cafe counter and pins him down, he holds his daughter telling her, "It's
all right. That didn't happen. That didn't happen."
Wade sits at his parents kitchen table calmly drinking a glass of whiskey.
Through the window his father's ramshackle barn burns in a field of bleak
white. The scene is eerily unsettling and says it all.
(Michael Redman has written this column for over 23 years and is growing
increasingly weary of dismal films no matter how well crafted they are. He's
currently looking for something in the light-hearted adventure genre.
