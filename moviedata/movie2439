IN SHORT: Fast moving, very cool battles. Slower moving story.
Being an epic-type film, "slow" is about the only negative I can toss at
Ridley Scott's Gladiator and those of you that are into "epic" length
flicks should not have any kind of problem with the flick. Everyone
else, stick to the small soda and popcorn, 'cuz you won't want to be
ducking out on the story, whose recreation of ancient Rome is a wondrous
thing to behold. Scott wanted to recreate a long lost world and, with
seamless integration of CG effects, has. So a tip of the hat to him, and
to whichever of the writers came up with the line "At my signal, unleash
hell." That's how we begin this film, with a battle between the Roman
Legions led by General Maximus (Russell Crowe) and the barbarian hordes
of Germania. Far behind the battlelines, watching hell unleashed, is the
dying Roman Emperior Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) who has decided
that Maximus should succeed him as Emperor.
This doesn't sit well with the first born son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix)
who, through a good deal of dramatic manipulation, takes the throne and
sentences Maximus and his family to death. Gladiator is still firing on
all cylinders at this point, as Maximus survives to find himself sold
into slavery for the gladiator pits in the outer reaches of the Empire.
Nicknamed "the Spaniard" and believed to be a deserter from the Roman
Legion, he is befriended by an African named Juba (Djimon Honsou) and
battles for his life under the ownership of freed former Gladiator
Proximo (Oliver Reed). Newly crowned Emperor Commodus orders the
Gladiators back to the Colosseum and you can guess what's coming from
there.
That's where politics rears its ugly head and slows the story down . . .
or adds a whole ton of real story to what would otherwise be a simple
man seeking vengeance scenario. The political end involves Commodus'
sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), who would've been Emperor save for an
accident of birth and Marcus Aurelius' final wish, to restore the Roman
Republic and the democracy founded there. The head of the Roman Senate,
and a co-plotter in these actions is Gracchus (Derek Jacobi), who
brought the story of Claudius to Masterpiece Theater years ago. We
wonder what Jacobi made of the fact that the story of Claudius plays a
key role in the twists in the story of Gladiator. Debate and discuss.
On the grand scale of the big screen, this is the kind of movie that
should be seen on the biggest one available. The opening battle and the
CG reconstructions of the Colosseum alone are worth the price of the
ticket. The battles could force some of us into testosterone overload.
Once the pace slows down, though, so does the rush and the excitement.
Gladiator is gonna make Russell Crowe a major star, his nomination for
The Insider notwithstanding. His characterization of Maximus, the
maturity of the relationship with Lucilla and sheer hatred of Commodus
are the stuff that people talk of.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Gladiator, he would have paid...
Seven less a deduction for the length. Speaking strictly from a guy's
standpoint, the rush from the  opening battle alone will carry you
through the first hour and a half.

Just before a battle scene early in "Gladiator," General Maximus
(Russell Crowe) turns to his second in command and says "At my signal,
unleash hell." The moment is significant for two reasons. First, because
Crowe delivers the sentence perfectly  as an instruction, not a movie
tagline (imagine how the command would have sounded in an old Clint
Eastwood or Arnold Schwarzenegger flick). Second, because when Maximus
finally gives the signal, his troops really do unleash hell, a horrific,
mesmerizing explosion of fire, blood and fury.
Directed by Ridley Scott ("Blade Runner," "Alien," "Thelma and Louise"),
"Gladiator" is the first film since the '60s to visit the swords, sweat,
decadence and deliverance of the Roman Empire. In the heyday of the
genre, the films could be divided into two camps: low budget, cheesy,
overstuffed action epics with wooden acting and strong homoerotic
subtexts, and expensive, cheesy, pretentious Judeo-Christian action
epics with hammy acting and slightly more subtle homoerotic subtexts.
Scott's film successfully navigates around these traits (not that
there's anything wrong with a juicy homoerotic subtext). He presents his
tale in a direct, no-nonsense fashion, with uniformly excellent acting
and, thankfully, no laborious speeches.
For a Roman epic, the story is easy to follow. (SPOILER ALERT: PLOT
POINTS FOLLOW) General Maximus is a humble Spaniard who has never even
seen Rome. His only goal is to finish his service to the emperor so he
can return home to his wife and son. But after the aforementioned
battle, Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) asks Maximus to be his
successor. The aging leader can't turn over the empire to his children.
While his daughter Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) would "make a fine Caesar,"
women are forbidden to rule, and Aurelius fears that his reckless son
Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) would abuse the power of the throne.
His concern is well placed. When Commodus learns of his father's plans,
he murders the Emperor and orders the deaths of Maximus and his
family.     Maximus escapes his would-be assassins, but arrives home too
late to save his wife and son. The grieving General is captured and made
a slave, landing in a North African outpost where ex-gladiator Proximo
(Oliver Reed) runs a training camp. Eventually, Maximus ends up in the
Colosseum of Rome, fighting for his life while the sneering Commodus
gazes down from the good seats. Maximus, anonymous behind his warrior
helmet, has a new task  to somehow avenge the murders of his loved ones
and insure that the wishes of his commander are finally carried out (END
SPOILER ALERT).
It's a familiar plotline ("Rob Roy" and "Braveheart" covered the same
turf), but Ridley Scott has a knack for taking a simple story and
turning it into something special. "Gladiator" dazzles because of
stellar acting, thrilling action scenes and spectacular imagery.
Russell Crowe heads the fine cast with yet another flawless performance.
Fresh from dual triumphs in "L.A. Confidential" and "The Insider," he is
positively searing as Maximus, using his amazing physicality to turn an
icon into a man. Crowe is the grounding force of the movie  we believe
because he makes us believe.
In his best work to date, Joaquin Phoenix is riveting as the wicked
Commodus. Playing an effete character with balls is no easy task, but
Phoenix pulls it off grandly. Although they receive limited screen time,
Connie Nielsen makes quite an impression as the regal Lucilla and Djimon
Hounson is memorable as the warrior Juba.
"Gladiator" also gives us the chance to see two seasoned veterans strut
their stuff. With wispy white hair and a deeply creased face, Richard
Harris simultaneously projects corporeal frailty and strength of spirit
as Emperor Marcus Aurelius. In his final role, Oliver Reed steals scenes
with gusto as the jaded entrepreneur Proximo. Incidentally, the press
kit for the film states "Sadly, Oliver Reed passed away in Malta on May
2, 1999, near the end of filming his role in 'Gladiator.'" Is it just
me, or does the use of the word "near" seem ill chosen?
The art direction in "Gladiator" is as impressive as the cast. Deftly
combining elaborate sets with computer graphics, Scott and company
present ancient Rome, from the streets of the city to the magnificent
Colosseum, with incredible verisimilitude. An aerial shot gliding up and
over the massive Colosseum is particularly breathtaking. For me, though,
the most memorable image was that of Maximus' hand gently sweeping over
stalks of grain, which speaks well of the artistry of Ridley Scott.
Still, I have a few quibbles with the film. The numerous battle scenes
are extremely robust, consistently exciting and inventively staged, but
Scott's frequent use of jump cuts makes the action hard to follow. And
while the swordplay is quite impressive, it can't hold a candle to the
phenomenal mano a mano sword fight at the end of "Rob Roy," where you
can actually feel the imposing weight of the weapons.
Finally, there's a question of thematic depth. Maximus battles not to
end the tyranny of slavery or to stop the barbaric games where men are
killed as entertainment for the masses, but to avenge his family and be
true to his fallen sovereign. His cause is personal  a bit too personal
for a story of such grand scale. As a result, I found myself admiring
"Gladiator" instead of being engulfed by it. Still, my admiration is
quite strong for this gorgeous, savage, terrifically acted film. Ridley
Scott may not have created the perfect epic, but he came awfully close.

Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.
     "I am just an entertainer," sniffs one character to another late in
Ridley Scott's GLADIATOR. The comment is intended as counterpoint to the
hero's moral courage and desire to right wrongs, but it also rings an
all-too-familiar chord as the movie season heads into its "summer event" 
phase. How often have brain-dead films been defended with a sniff that
it's "just meant to be entertaining?" How often has "entertainment" in the
blockbuster era been defined as "tens of millions of dollars thrown at a
production that began without a completed script?" Critics cringe as the
first of May draws near, knowing that a cadre of Hollywood film-makers who
consider themselves "just entertainers" will be spewing forth grotesquely
inept stories peppered with explosions and digital effects.
     With such images in mind, I shouldn't diminish GLADIATOR by tossing
out so banal a word as "entertaining" -- but it is. I shouldn't succumb to
the temptation to describe it with ad-copy buzzwords like "spectacular!" 
or "dazzling!" or "epic!" -- but it is. Movies just don't get much more
fundamentally satisfying on so many levels -- simple without being
simplistic, grand in scope without losing track of its basic appeal.
     The time is 180 A.D., where the Roman Empire is finishing the
military campaign in Germania that will eliminate the last outpost of
resistance. Leading the troops is General Maximus (Russell Crowe) --
valiant warrior, humble farmer and favorite of Emperor Marcus Aurelius
(Richard Harris). Though Maximus wants nothing more than to return home to
his family at the end of the war, the ailing Marcus Aurelius wants him to
become the next emperor, ultimately to return Rome to a republic. This
understandably troubles Marcus Aurelius' son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix),
who kills his father before his will can be known. Succeeding to the
throne, Commodus orders Maximus and his family executed. Maximus escapes,
only to find himself enslaved by gladiator owner Proximo (Oliver Reed). 
>From his now-lowly state, Maximus vows to avenge the deaths of his family
and his emperor.
     The story is, to put it bluntly, older than the Roman Empire: 
reluctant-but-impossibly-noble hero fights against great odds to bring low
a regal-but-impossibly-dastardly villain. It has been done and done and
done again, because when it's done well, few stories are as viscerally
effective. And GLADIATOR does it remarkably well. Crowe plays Maximus as
straight as he can possibly be played, giving him an iconic grandeur; it's
the kind of role that makes actors into movie stars. Phoenix makes a
sensational sniveling villain, wrapping his parricidal tendencies and
incestuous lechery after his sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) in a
pathetically sincere need to be adored. The late Oliver Reed also scores
in his final role as the casually cynical Proximo. Every one of them is
playing a standard film type; every one of them refuses to submit to the
notion that a type can't be played with energy and commitment. As a basic
film story, GLADIATOR is lean and effective.
     And it's not too bad as a visual treat, either. Copious use of
digital effects is de rigeur for epic genre films circa 2000, yet there is
nothing remotely obligatory or pointlessly showy about GLADIATOR's
re-creation of ancient Rome. It's stunning work that raises the ruins of
the Colosseum and captures both the magnificence and the casual brutality
of the culture. The scenes of warfare and gladitorial contests are taut
(and graphically gruesome) pieces of action film-making, bringing Ridley
Scott back to the artistic heights he abandoned for films like G.I. JANE
and WHITE SQUALL. It is becoming a Hollywood clich to claim that "every
dollar is up there on the screen," but that's the way GLADIATOR feels. The
execution of its technical detail is so precise that it never feels like
more or less than exactly what is necessary to complement the story.
     If there's a weak link to GLADIATOR, it's the amount of time devoted
to Roman political intrigue. The imperial/republican squabbling and
back-stabbing certainly recall classic sword-n-sandal films like
SPARTACUS, but GLADIATOR starts to drag a bit whenever Derek Jacobi's
plotting senator is on screen. Perhaps it's just that GLADIATOR is so
invigorating as a stripped-down, nuts-and-bolts dramatic adventure that
anything remotely resembling subtext just gets in the way. It's even more
silly than amusing to contemplate parallels between GLADIATOR's
crowd-pleasing bloodsports and professional wrestling (complete with
Maximus's combat moniker "The Spaniard"). The usual caveat for summer
event films has been something akin to "leave your brain at the door," but
that's not entirely appropriate or fair to apply to GLADIATOR; it's too
smartly scripted in its old-fashioned way. The better suggestion is to
leave your expectations of hipness, reflexivity and big-budget bombast at
the door. GLADIATOR is just entertaining ... in all the wonderful ways
that word can be a good thing.

"Gladiator" (2000) ***1/2 (out of four)
Starring Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie
Nielsen, Derek Jacobi, Richard Harris, Oliver 
Reed, and Djimon Hounsou.
Imagine this. You're given a sword and a shield and
very basic, minimal training. A man you don't know
tells you that this will be the last day that you will
live. You are thrown into an arena with thousands of
spectators wanting to see you die. You frantically
monitor several closed doors which, in seconds, will
release vicious enemies prepared to destroy you. You
watch as the innocent friends you made in the last few
days are murdered in cold blood. If you are lucky
enough to survive this chaos thrown at you, you know
you're going to have to do it all over again tomorrow.
Eventually know matter how strong or skilled you are,
you're going to die. This is the life of a gladiator.
You'll never have to be a gladiator and after seeing
Ridley Scott's powerful Gladiator, you'll be thankful
for that.  
With his new film, Scott has returned cinema to the
fascinating age of the ancient Roman Empire. And like
those preceding it, Spartacus and Ben Hur, Gladiator
has nearly everything going for it - a strong lead
actor, a wonderful supporting cast, eye-catching
special effects, and a great script. Since the two
aforementioned films came out before the prime target
viewers of Gladiator (teenagers to thirty-year-old
males) were around, a whole new genre may just be
reborn and revisited. 
>From a weak beginning, the film starts off extremely
gloomy and inauspicious. Rome's best general Maximus
(Russell Crowe), who has helped the Empire conquer
nearly everywhere they have attempted, is currently
(in the year 180 A.D. that is) waging a war against
Germania. Scott shoots the gory battle in an awkward
style, similar to that of Saving Private Ryan but much
less effective. It's blurry, in slow motion, and the
sound is muted. As soon as this artistic method began,
it was hard to tell what was what and who was who.
It's a good thing Scott stops this after the first
twenty minutes or else Gladiator would have been
torture to watch. Instead, the general swears he will
get out after this battle. He wants to go back to his
family and his crops, he wants a quiet life. But,
unexpectedly, he gets anything but that. The dying
emperor of Rome, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris),
decides to have Maximus appointed new emperor of Rome
once he dies. He asks Maximus to restore the Republic
by giving more power to the senators. All of this does
not go well for Aurelius' son, Commodus (Joaquin
Phoenix) who was expecting his father to name him the
new emperor. Jealous and upset, Commodus kills his own
father, names himself emperor, kills Maximus' wife and
son, and attempts to kill Maximus. But Maximus is able
to escape his own death and vows to kill Commodus and
fulfill Marcus Aurelius' wishes. Now a slave, the only
way he can win his own freedom and complete his goal
is to become a winning gladiator, who eventually are
released for their success. 
A story of betrayal and promises, Gladiator is more
than just a mindless action flick. You actually care
about the characters, sometimes even the evil villain
Commodus, who is just a young man as determined to
make Rome one way as Maximus is determined to make it
the other way. Phoenix plays his character
brilliantly. Think of Commodus as the Percy Wetmore
(of pant-wetter The Green Mile) of the Roman Empire -
a whiny, sleazy,
"respect-me-because-my-father-was-a-good-man" brat who
hates when he's not the center of attention. Every
scene we see Commodus, he's either crying or he looks
like he has just been crying. Phoenix has definitely
matured as an actor since To Die For, and Gladiator
shows he's more than just River's little brother.
Crowe is also excellent as the film's grisly-faced
hero. Maximus is one of the few characters in recent
cinema who actually has emotions. This guy actually
acts like a anyone in his situation would act, he's no
invincible superhero who only blurts out one-liners,
he (believe it or not) acts like a human being! The
rest of the cast, including Richard Harris, Djimon
Hounsou, Walter Hill, Derek Jacobi, and Connie Nielsen
are also first rate. 
Ridley Scott, using outstanding special effects, has
brilliantly recreated the Roman Coliseum, the loudness
of the Roman Mob, and the city of Rome in general. The
visuals are breathtaking and voluminous, like a
Cleopatra of the year 2000. The costuming is also
wonderful from the detailed shields and armor to the
exquisite dress of the upper-class politicians.  
Gladiator is another movie you have to see on the big
screen to get the most out of the experience. Along
with U-571, action fans should have plenty to see in
theaters this week and should expect much more
excitement to come this summer of 2000.

Directed by Ridley Scott. Screenplay by David H Franzoni, John Logan and
William Nicholson. Starring Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie 
Nielsen. Running time: 153 minutes. Rated AA for blood letting and 
violent scenes by the MFCB. Reviewed on May 8th, 2000.
The reign of Caesar Marcus Aurelius in the mid-second century A.D. is
often considered a golden age of the Roman Empire. Marcus was 
instrumental in securing peace in the nether regions of the Empire, but 
was also a philosopher of great renown. He died in 180 and rule passed to 
his son Commodus. The transition was an orderly one; Commodus was 
recommended to the Senate by Marcus, and indeed had been sharing power 
with his father since 177. Commodus' rule, however, would go down in the 
history books as disastrous, with the Caesar's demeanour descending into 
brutality and ultimately madness. In 182 his sister Lucilla and a group 
of senators tried unsuccessfully to have him assassinated. Commodus 
became obsessed with the gladiatorial games, and in 192 his own advisers 
had him strangled by a popular wrestler.
"Gladiator" is a condensed and largely fictionalised version of the true 
events. The most notable addition to the story is Maximus (Russell 
Crowe), a general who leads the Romans to victory against the German 
tribes to the north. Contradicting real life, Marcus Aurelius (Richard 
Harris) wants Maximus -- not Commodus -- to be Rome's new ruler after his 
death, with the aim of eventually turning the empire back into a republic. 
Before he can proclaim his decision, however, the deceitful Commodus 
(Joaquin Phoenix) murders his father and orders Maximus' execution.
Maximus escapes and tries to return home to Spain, only to discover that 
Commodus has had his wife and son killed as well. Gravely wounded in his 
flight, Maximus is captured and bought by Proximo (the late Oliver Reed)
to fight as a gladiator. Initially reluctant, Maximus soon embraces his
new role when it gives him a chance to travel to Rome, where the new
Caesar has declared 150 days of gladiatorial games to celebrate his 
ascension to the throne. There, Maximus' efforts to take revenge on 
Commodus involve him in the machinations of Commodus' sister Lucilla 
(Connie Nielsen).
The first blockbuster movie of the 2000 summer season, "Gladiator" is a 
visual feast. Expert set design and computer effects have been exploited 
in their fullest by director Ridley Scott to bring ancient Rome to life. 
Shots which pan overhead across the city to the Coliseum, teeming with 
spectators, are fabulous to behold. It is difficult not to feel  
transported eighteen hundred years back in time.
In some respects, however, Scott overdoes it with his cinematic trickery. 
Specifically, he portrays many fight scenes -- both with the gladiators 
and the legions -- using a choppy, strobe-like technique. Scott is 
clearly trying to achieve the sense of disorientation in battle that was 
so successfully conveyed in films like  "Braveheart" and "Saving Private 
Ryan". Instead, he merely makes these sequences disjointed and hard to 
watch. It is virtually impossible to follow the actions of even the 
principal characters, and so the viewer is left to try to piece together 
what is actually happening.
It has been more than thirty years since the last great Roman epic was 
made. In reviving the genre, the scriptwriters have elected to hew 
closely to tried-and-true storylines rather than break new ground. 
"Gladiator" does not deviate much from other examples of the genre, 
echoing everything from "Spartacus" to "Doctor Who". The mad emperor, the
resurgent war hero, and the gladiatorial games as a conduit for revenge 
are all familiar plot elements. Nonetheless, the story is entertainingly 
told, and while considerable attention is paid to the gladiator combat 
which is the movie's main attraction, this is not overaccentuated. 
"Gladiator" is no "Mortal Kombat", moving from meaningless battle to 
meaningless battle without pause. The film is very well paced, and the 
quieter aspects of the plot are not trivialised.
Perhaps as a result of this, "Gladiator" boasts some unusually fine 
acting for a big-budget action picture. Crowe, although by no means 
achieving the complexity of his Oscar-nominated performance in "The 
Insider", brings a pleasant depth to Maximus. The general is a man first 
and a hero second; he is driven to confront Commodus not by a love of 
Rome, but rather of a man who was as a father to him, and of a murdered 
wife and child whose deaths he must avenge. Crowe brings an evenness to 
the role which makes Maximus seem more real than similar characters in 
other movies.
Likewise, Phoenix does well not to overplay Commodus. The role of the
insane tyrant has often been an invitation to hammy overacting in the 
past, but Phoenix's portrayal is more subtle. Commodus' burgeoning 
madness is manifested largely through his body language, rather than any 
particular statement or deed. Also very good are Reed and Harris in 
supporting roles. Despite their comparatively short screen time (indeed, 
Reed actually died before filming was complete, forcing Scott to 
compensate using clever editing and digital effects), both grant their 
characters a sense of history and profundity.
Perhaps least successful is Nielsen as Lucilla, despite having what may be
"Gladiator"'s most involved role. Lucilla is Commodus' sister, and he 
obviously harbors inappropriate feelings for her. It is also strongly 
implied that she is Maximus' former lover. And she is a dispassionate and 
intelligent schemer, whose allegiances may be pivotal in determining 
Rome's future. But Nielsen comes across as detached throughout the 
proceedings, more so than is called for by her character. Even in scenes 
where Lucilla's reserve breaks, Nielsen feels removed from the action. 
Given her importance in how the events of the movie play out, this is an 
unfortunate central weakness.
But all in all, "Gladiator" is entrancing to watch, beautifully acted, 
and really just a lot of good old-fashioned fun. Although far removed from 
the greatness of classics like "Ben-Hur", it marks an entertaining and 
satisfying return of what was once one of Hollywood's favourite genres.
Indeed, given the possibilities offered by this age of increasingly 
sophisticated special effects, "Gladiator" is hopefully just the first 
of many forays back to the time of the great Roman Empire.

     "Joey, do you like movies about gladiators?"  Hey, who doesn't!?
     The awe-inspiring trailers for Gladiator may have you dreaming of
Spartacus and Ben-Hur, but you may be surprised to find this film in
reality a less palatable mélange of Braveheart and Mad Max: Beyond
Thunderdome.  This isn't altogether a bad thing, but those expecting a
new Roman epic that will stand the test of time (like Spartacus and
Ben-Hur) are in for some surprises.
     The currently hot Russell Crowe stars as Maximus, "the general who
became a slave" who begins the film as a commander so high in the
echelons of the Roman army that the aging Caesar Marcus Aurelius
(Richard Harris) hand-picks him to become the next Caesar... instead of
his own son Commodus (not pronounced Commode-us, played by Joaquin
Phoenix).
     Joaquin Phoenix's appearance in a movie always means trouble, and
sure enough, dad is soon dead, Commodus is Emperor, and Maximus is off
to execution.  It's a roundabout road (that lasts 150 minutes) to get
from general to slave and slave to gladiator.  From there, Maximus ends
up in Rome at the Colosseum (you know: THE Colosseum), threatening to
overthrow the Emperor and return power to the Republic.  And here we
are, 1600 years before the American Revolution.
     Gladiator's finest hour comes when the gladiating begins (though
this is a good 60 minutes into the picture).  And we are talking serious
carnage.  Bloodletting.  Decapitations.  People severed in two.  Dirty
fighting.  Joey would like this movie.
     Shot in an aggressive yet vaguely annoying chop-chop style,
Gladiator borrows heavily from the camera style Spielberg used in Saving
Private Ryan's battle scenes:  Print every other frame of film twice,
and run at regular speed.  This casts everything in a dreamlike quality,
which sometimes works in the film but gets old due to overuse and
overall poor lighting.
     Then there's the chit-chat of Gladiator's "plot," a threadbare bit
of political intrigue, with Commodus worried sick about Maximus's rise
to popularity via the mob crowds at the pit, Connie Nielsen's Lucilla
(Commodus's sister), also worried sick in fear that her son will be
killed... blah blah blah.  I zoned out whenever one of these weepy
people took the stage, waiting for the fighting to start again.  You
know, with the chariots!  And the tigers!
     There's something Jerry Springeresque about Gladiator, but Crowe
lends a lot of legitimacy to the proceedings.  Less effective is
Phoenix, who invites you to believe he is an actual Emperor of Rome.
This turns out to be impossible, as Phoenix comes across as, well, River
Phoenix's little brother.  There's also the little issue that Gladiator
stretches the boundaries of "historical fiction" to new and impossible
lengths, which almost goes without saying.  Almost.

Here's one spectactle of a film Ridley Scott definetly made for the
masses, a large-budgeted (somewhere over 100 million bucks) digital
effects epic, a Star Wars film for grown-ups, with the intention to
overwhelm you with its technical feats and please your senses with its
photography and dazzle you with the Roman Colosseum gladiator events,
and most of all, it tries to breathe new life into the much maligned and
parodied Heroic Tale. Art becomes subservient to the public's taste for
what is deemed enjoyable. The film keeps reminding you in intervals of
every 15-minutes, as if that was a spot to go for a commercial, that its
aim is primarily to please the crowd.
With a functional script to its credit, some fine bursts of mannered
acting by Russell Crowe who is asked to carry the film and ably manages
to ground it on his furtive looks of steel and his intense inner need
for revenge, and the film's palatable heroic story of good versus evil,
the film is a reminder of the old Hollywood sword- and- sandal films of
grandeur and muscle and frivilousness. A few of those Hollywood oldies
that the film takes after are: Quo Vadis, Ben Hur, and The Fall of the
Roman Empire. Though, it lacks the kind of political intrigue to be
considered in the same class with Kubrick's last fling with Hollywood,
Spartacus. In modern times, it comes closest to aping Braveheart.
Russell Crowe is the great Roman General Maximus in the Rome of 180
A.D., who is asked by the dying philosophical tyrant turned seeker of a
better legacy, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), to rule Rome after he
dies, to end its corruption and make sure that the senate gets control
of the empire so that the empire is turned into a republic. The love
between Aurelius and Maximus is mutual, much like a father and son
relationship.
Maximus wins a bloody battle over Germania, the last resistance from the
barbarians, which takes 10-minutes of the opening of the film to
accomplish. General Maximus commands his troops to `unleash hell' on
their underdog adversaries with an outpouring of arrows and flaming
canisters to fill the screen with blood and gore and mud, and a
beautifully framed picture of the barbarians' woods on fire and its
landscape turned into an eerie hue of bluish-gray ash. Scott succeeds in
his visceral opening just like Spielberg did in Saving Private Ryan, of
grabbing the audience's attention and keeping it for most of the film.
When Marcus's cowardly son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), is told by his
father that he has given the empire to Maximus because he doesn't think
he would be a fair ruler, his unappreciative son kills him and inherits
the crown by deceit. The proud general refuses to pledge his loyalty to
him and is arrested and sentenced to be slain immediately, but manages
to stave off his executioners and return to his farm in Spain,
unbeknownst to the new emperor. But he arrives too late to save his
family, as his wife and son are crucified. The general then becomes a
slave and is sold to the gladiator entrepeneur Proximo (Oliver Reed-he
died before finishing the film).
Proximo, an ex-slave gladiator who won his freedom from Marcus Aurelius,
considers himself to be in the entertainment business, of giving the
public a good show for their money. He, to his pocketbook's regret, must
work the provinces (in North Africa) since Marcus Aurelius banned his
gladiator show in Rome five years ago.
The new emperor in an effort to please the mobs, orders 150 days' of
gladiator games at the Colosseum in Rome. Meanwhile, the gladiator
becomes of a single-mind to get revenge on his foe, as he pictures in
his mind his ravaged family and feels that they are waiting for him in
heaven, a revenge theme used by so many Westerns to inspire their hero
to take action. That is now the main focus of the film, as the gladiator
is given a slim chance of hope that he can have his freedom restored by
winning in the arena and meeting again Commodus.
In Rome, the emperor, played with a feverish but transparent perversity
by Phoenix, desperate for some kind of affection and aflame for his
older sister, the stately and beautiful Lucilla (Connie Nielsen). But
she has this crush on the general, who sired her eight year old son
(Spencer Treat Clark). She never revealed the true identity of the
father, so the general who rejected her doesn't know that his son is the
next heir to the throne, and more importantly the emperor doesn't know.
When the games begin in Rome, which are promoted like modern World
Wrestling Federation events are, Proximo's advice to the gladiator is,
"Please the crowd and Rome will be yours."Maximus fights to stay alive
in the Colosseum while awaiting the chance to take his revenge on
Commodus. He snarls and says things in a low but sure-fired baritone
voice, that is heavily-laced with a macho Australian accent "In this
life or the next, I will have my vengeance." He survives a historical
battle re-creation by taking on lions and other gladiators, and becomes
the crowd favorite and gets to meet the chagrined Commodus in person,
who has the only funny line in this flick, as he remarks, "My history's
a little hazy, but didn't the barbarians lose the battle of Carthage?"
The gladiator sees Lucilla in the dark dungeon of his present residence,
as they exchange greetings and catch up on all the missing details of
their lives since they last met. The plan is for him to escape with the
help of the senator who is for the people, Gracchus, played by the great
British actor Derek Jacobi, who could have done more if only asked, as
he seems to move across the senate floor as gracefully as possible,
seemingly sleepwalking through his thin part.
With all the rogue parties agreeing to a plan of escape for Maximus,
after which he will lead his old army stationed outside the gates of
Rome to move against Commodus and help restore a  republic, that is, if
Maximus can just stay alive for a little while longer. The climax to the
21/2 hour epic comes when the escape plan is foiled by the cunningly
insecure Commodus, who then devices a plan to poison Maximus and
subsequently gets him to fight a duel in front of the Colosseum crowd,
so that he can look like the conquerer of Maximus in front of their
festive eyes and thereby get the people back on his side.
The film is gaudy but it is entertaining, always a pleasure to look at
even if it is disdainful to think what crass aims it is up to. Oliver
Reed did a feisty job and stole a few scenes toward the end of the film
with his cynical performance. The neurotic, clutching on to dear life,
performance of determined evil by Joaquin Phoenix, made him a formidable
villain. Russell Crowe relished the fight scenes and gave the film
exactly what it asked for. Connie Nielsen added some class to the
storytelling. The film did match the uneven quality of the old Hollywood
film, the kind of standard epic that hasn't been made for a number of
years, and probably won't be made after this one because of the
prohibitive high budget. Gladiator should be well-received by the
public, after all, it is giving them what it thinks they want. If you
notice, sex is all but absent from the film, there is instead, plenty of
violence. Ah! people's tastes are so fickle!

When at its best, Gladiator is one of the great films of all time. Every
moment is exhilarating, every fight engaging and every moral and statement
so well thought out and of such a classic nature that they can be
appreciated and pondered simultaneously. However, when at its worse,
Gladiator's two-and-a-half hour length takes the spotlight off the film's
numerous virtues to the point where a slip in the projection gave a preview
audience an unintended intermission necessary to tolerate some upcoming
moments that would make `Wuthering Heights' seem like a page-turner.
Fortunately, the good disproportionately outweighs the bad so much that you
should have no reservations about seeing this film if you want to be
in-the-loop on Oscar night.
The first person onscreen is, appropriately enough, Maximus (Russell Crowe,
setting the bar for this year's Best Actor race), the movie's hero. When we
meet him he is a general at war commanding thousands of troops in the name
of pre-Nero Rome. Like most great war heroes in the movies, Maximus is
humble and wise. His motivation in battle is more to return to his family
than to defend Rome. Although, given the benevolent nature of the empire's
current Caesar, he has no qualms fighting for the great city.
Maximus' skill, bravery and humane qualities are rewarded when he is
informed that he, not the Caesar's son, will inherit the emperorship of
Rome. Yet one of the inherit rules applying to just about all of Hollywood's
great epics is that the kinder the ruler is, the crueler and less loyal his
son. Gladiator isn't an exception. Soon Maximus is no longer a General but
rather a slave and no longer fighting for his family but rather the name of
the great Caesar who once tried to name him his successor only to be
murdered by his blood son that very evening.
Above all else, credit Ridley Scott, the director of the film. And then give
John Mathieson, the deft cinematographer, his due as well. The two brilliant
behind-the-scenes men have created an ancient Rome that few will have
trouble accepting as reality. Thousands of extras are coordinated perfectly
down to the most irrelevant details which only a nit-picky critic like
myself would pay any heed. As for the scenery and backgrounds, to call them
gorgeous would be an enormous understatement  if Dreamworks needs to make
any more money off this film, they should have no difficulty selling
postcards.
Yet surely Scott and Mathieson wouldn't have been able to accomplish this
incredible feat without the aid of a $100 million budget. What does this
tell us about Hollywood today? Perhaps those nine figures are the proof that
although a fluke like The Blair Witch Project will come around from time to
time, enough money combined with the right individuals can create a movie as
marvelous and spectacular as Gladiator. Unfortunately, the large sum
ultimately makes a little too much movie as the creative duo seem to have
gotten caught up in scenery and re-creating the past so much so that they
forget to advance the plot at certain points and instead test the audience's
patience with a craft that belongs in an art gallery, not on the silver
screen.
Gladiator's good guys share a political philosophy of favoring the Senate
over a dictator-like emperor. Many of the more loveable characters also put
their faith in an afterlife as a form of surviving their less-than-ideal
current lives. These issues raise enough debate that Gladiator manages to
achieve its final success by crossing the border from being just another
heroic epic to being a modern-day classic, not unlike Ben-Hur and
Braveheart, even if the film could use some trimming around the edges.

Being trumpeted as the first big "event" picture of the summer of 2000, 
Ridley Scott's "Gladiator" is a robust, lumbering, often very exciting, 
extremely well-acted, and long, action-adventure, the first movie of its type 
to be set in Rome in over three decades. In fact, the film has been made on 
such an enormous scale (with a price tag of $103-million) that it's difficult 
not to be completely swept away in its high-style effectiveness and technical 
grandeur. Despite the sparkling presences of the film's three lead actors, as 
well as the many rousing battle set-pieces, "Gladiator" is a flawed motion 
picture, and one that, for all its flashiness, comes off as a mild 
disappointment. It is still a good film, but only marginally so, and easily 
could have been a great one.
Opening in 180 A.D., Maximus (Russell Crowe), an acclaimed Roman general, has 
sent his group of men into battle against the Germanics, in the final fight 
to defeat the empire's enemies. Set against the backdrop of the fog-induced, 
murky Bavarian forest, just as nightfall approaches, Maximus carries on his 
battle plan, and amidst the carnage, lives to see their victory. A much-loved 
and admired militarian who hasn't seen his wife and young son for 
two-and-a-half years, Maximus has become the sort of adopted son of Emperor 
Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), who offers him the chance to be the ruler 
of Rome when he passes away, despite the title expectancy going to his own 
flesh-and-blood son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). 
Once the cowardly Commodus discovers his father's decision, he promptly 
murders him and demands that Maximus and his family be executed at once. 
Following his escape and the discovery that his home has been burned down and 
his wife and son brutally murdered, Maximus is captured by slave traders and 
sent to the provinces to act as a gladiator for the citizens' entertainment. 
Known as "The Spaniard," he surprisingly manages to defeat everyone that 
steps in his way, and is, finally, sent back to Rome, where he must carry out 
his newly enslaved life. But Commodus, the new emperor of Rome who believes 
Maximus has long since been killed, does not know that the masked mystery man 
the crowds have been cheering for in the Coliseum, is the man he most 
despises.
Unlike most action-adventures, "Gladiator" has a heart, along with its 
visceral thrills, thus allowing the audience to not only get involved in the 
sword fights and battle scenes, but also in the fates of the major 
characters. It also strengthens its entire impact and adds dimension to a 
story that otherwise might have come off being ineffectual and thin-skinned. 
As Maximus, 35-year-old Russell Crowe has once again made a 180-degree 
transformation from his Oscar-nominated last character, the 57-year-old 
Jeffrey Wigand in 1999's "The Insider." Toned, alluring, and exceptionally 
convincing, Crowe has created another largely memorable character, one that 
is not your typical action hero, but a man who seems real--who can get hurt 
and even killed, and is bound to not always be able to save the day, no 
matter how talented of a gladiator he is.
In his strongest role to date, Joaquin Phoenix, usually cast as punk or dense 
types (see 1995's "To Die For" and 1999's "8mm"), really gets to show off his 
acting chops, and is plausibly threatening and powerful as the scheming 
Commodus. As Commodus' sister, Lucilla, Connie Nielsen (2000's "Mission to 
Mars") is superb, managing to hold her own in each of her scenes, right down 
to her final one, which is a marvelous display of acting. The way she reacts 
in her last moments onscreen come off as strikingly genuine and real, and 
Nielsen unveils herself to be a talent worth watching.
The cinematography, by John Matheson, is sweeping and unforgettable, using 
the most out of its widescreen format. However, many sequences are overly dim 
and more than a little grimy looking. The brighter scenes, however, 
particularly the angelic ones set back at Maximus' home, as well as all of 
the scenes at the Coliseum, are dazzling in their visual glory. Also making 
an impression is the memorable music score, by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard, 
perfectly capturing the feel of a Roman epic.
Where "Gladiator" loses some of its luster is in its overlong running time, 
which could have easily been nipped and tucked here and there without losing 
anything substantial with its characters or the story, at hand. Moreover, 
certain sections run on a little too long, and the fight scenes begin to grow 
repetitive by the final half-hour. 
What ultimately saves "Gladiator," making it a film worth seeing, is the 
intensity and power of the climax, a tour de force fight to the death between 
Commodus and Maximus, with unforeseen results. It is moments like these that 
prove what a natural craftsman and possibly underrated filmmaker Ridley Scott 
(1982's "Blade Runner") is. "Gladiator" may be guilty of needless excess, but 
when it really works, it's an unadulterated adrenaline rush.

Amidst the mighty city of Rome, stands the Coliseum, shining in the sunlight
in all its splendor and magnificence. It is the greatest construction in
human history and a proof of that Rome truly is the center of the earth. In
it -- blood flows and heads roll amidst the laughing and applauds of the
noble crowd. This is the symbol of the Roman Empire -- a symbol of the
pride, mesmerizing beauty and inhuman power, but also of the savage
brutality of the Roman ideology.
It has been four decades since chariots raced and swords flashed across
movie screens in epic dramas of a time long past. Now, director Ridley Scott
brings the glorious battles of the ancient Roman arena back to the big
screen in a sweeping story of courage and revenge. The great Roman General
Maximus (Russell Crowe) has once again led the legions to victory on the
battlefield. The war won, Maximus dreams of home, wanting only to return to
his wife and son; however, the dying Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard
Harris) has one more duty for the general-to assume the mantle of his power.
Jealous of Maximusí favor with the emperor, the heir to the throne, Commodus
(Joaquin Phoenix), orders his execution and that of his family. Barely
escaping death, Maximus is forced into slavery and trained as a gladiator in
the arena where his fame grows. Now he has come to Rome, intent on avenging
the murder of his wife and son by killing the new emperor Commodus. Maximus
has learned that the one power stronger than that of the emperor is the will
of the people, and he knows he can only attain his revenge by becoming the
greatest hero in all the empire.
This is Ridley Scott's greatest and most successful achievement since 'Blade
Runner' (1981). 'Gladiator' is what 'Titanic' was supposed to be: a
combination of a dramatic emotional story, grand star cast and breathtaking
visuals. A film with spectacular locations, wonderous cinematography, fast
paced editing and heavenly music. But when 'Titanic' stopped at visual
perfection, creating merely an illusion of a great epic, 'Gladiator'
succeeds because of David Franzoini's complex script, multidimensional
characters and impressive acting. Russel Crowe , recently Oscar nominated
for his role in 'The Insider', is equally spectacular in his recent
achievement as the vengeful Roman general. It is a role that demands more
presence than acting, but Crowe has both. Scott , along side with
screenwriter David Franzoini ('Amistad') have created very strong, mature
and complex characters that are all spirits of their time. Maximus is the
greatest general of Rome and a loyal servant of his good master Marcus
Aurelius, fabulously played by Oscar nominee Richard Harris. Maximus was an
idealist -- a noble warrior that believed in justice, perfect worlds,
rightisnous kings and sacrifices for the greater good. But a tough life has
shown him the dark side of his paradise. He is a simple man with simple
needs. The endless wars, the constant death around him and his hands still
warm from his enemies blood, don't bother him anymore. He has become numb.
The only light in his life is the hope that someday he will see his wife and
son again. When he looses his master, his family and his reputation, he
cheats death and returns to Rome, with one single purpose -- avenge the
death of his family. He soon finds himself a part of a conspiracy to murder
the young Emperor, Commodus. Commodes is the most complex character in the
story and has a striking resemblance to Amon Göth from Steven Spielberg's
'Schindler's List'. A man that is capable of unspeakable crimes, and jet
never becoming a consistent villain in our eyes. He is a man with not so
many great qualities, but with great desires and ambitions. As the film
progresses, we get to know him as a person and dive deeper into his dark
heart. He is filled with emotions that he can not express, reaching for love
and respect he can not gain. Phoenix ('8MM') plays him fabulously as an
amoral, insecure young man driven to near madness by total power and the
inherent loneliness that attends it. The only support he thinks he has is
from his sister, Lucile. Played by Connie Nielsen ('The Devil's Advocate' ),
she is a wise, mysterious beauty. She remains at her brother's side until
she realizes the incredible danger, but then it is too late. In the latter
part of the film, we see her cruelly abused and mistreated by Commodes, with
her past intelligence and freshness lost forever. Proximo is an old
gladiator that gained his freedom with the blood of his opponents and the
will of the crowd. He is a lion. His eyes have not lost the fearsome power
and his voice has not lost its strength. In Maximus he sees himself at a
younger age, and this encounter awakens memories of his glorious past.
Energetically played by Oliver Reed in the last role of his life, where he
shows why he was elected one of the best actors alive. Proximo teaches
Maximus the tricks of the trade and makes it possible for him to go to Rome
and dream of revenge against the new emperor. All these lives and many more
are crossed together, woven into a magnificent web of events. There is a
great and touching friendship between Maximus and Juba, a good-hearted man
that has suffered the same fate as Maximus himself, is emotionally portrayed
by 'Amistad's Djimon Honsou . This friendship remains the only pure and good
in a world of blood and death. There is a very interesting and heartbreaking
relationship between Commodus, his sister and her son; and a touching
connection between Proximo and Maximus. The film is also filled with
intellectually stimulating conspiracies and betrayals -- the darkness under
the sparkling facade -- the Senate.
'Gladiator' is a perfect combination that will certainly appeal to the mass
audience, and although it's not as primitive as 'Titanic', it will still
rock the box office. But this is much more than a commercial success, it's
an artistic and intellectual achievement. It has an extremely powerful
emotional impact. Grotesque battles in all their glory (inspired by 'Saving
Private Ryan' ), a great love lost and friendship gained. Hopes, dreams,
fantasies, ideas and ideologies. Revenge in all its darkness, justice,
sacrifice, betrayal and destiny in all its mystique. This film has it all.
And it is presented in such beauty and elegance that it's impossible to
refuse. Although Maximus existed only in ancient legends, this film has
otherwise a very strong grounding in history. Both Marcus Aurelius - the
philosopher, Lucile - the wise and the Roman senators depicted in this
movie, really existed. As for Commodes it is said: "[He was] one of the few
Roman emperors of whom nothing good can be said..". Off course characters
such as Proximo are all fictions, but extremely effective.
Rome is recreated in all its splendor and power thanks to Benjamín
Fernández's and John King's magical art direction and miraculous digital
special effects. Here, even Romans would feel at home. Every detail is
perfect, whether it is the 100's of statues that surround the Coliseum or a
tree in the forests of Germania. The sets look even more real when you see
the costumes these actors are in. They are supremely crafted with every
detail taken care of. The lighting, the framing, the blue camera filters,
in-depth high speed filming of a war with the Germanic Barbarians and a
Gladiatorial reenactment of the war of Cartage. But what Ridley Scott has
achieved is much more than visual splendor. He has somehow recreated a
multidimensional picture of Rome, with its corruption and wickedness hidden
under the shining mask of grandness. He has created an uneasy and disturbing
atmosphere where everyone are against one another. Where everyone is talking
about the welfare of Rome, while thinking only about personal gain and
happiness. It's a place where friends smiling stab each other in the back --
the whole specter of Roman mentality. This is 'Spartacus' with all its
intelligence, 'Braveheart' with all its pumping adrenaline, 'Saving Private
Ryan' with all its openness and raw emotions, and 'Titanic with all its
visual splendor. Whether it will win the Oscars is yet to be discovered, but
one thing is certain, Ridley Scott has created a true and glorious epic.

Summer is beginning earlier than ever, with each
year's first blockbuster action picture being released
in early May. Last year, early May brought us `The
Mummy', easily the worst film to hit screens in 1999.
The summer of 2000, however, seems to be a more
ambitious one, with its May blockbuster being Ridley
Scott's thrilling `Gladiator', a solid, high-octane
period picture that wears the guise of a sweeping,
emotionally-charged epic.
The success of `Gladiator' (both critically and
commercially) should be attributed to two film
veterans. The first is director Ridley Scott; a man
who, in the early 80's, changed the face of
science-fiction forever with `Blade Runner' and
`Alien', and showed a knack for female-exploitation
with his estrogen-fueled `Thelma and Louise' and `G.I.
Jane'. 
The second reason for the event-movie status of
`Gladiator' is Australian heartbreaker Russell Crowe,
who was recently robbed of an Oscar for his riveting
work in Michael Mann's `The Insider'. After years of
stunning bit roles in American films like `L.A.
Confidential', he may finally become a recognized star
with his compelling performance in `Gladiator'.
The film begins with a battle sequence so sharply
edited that it rivals the football matches in Oliver
Stone's `Any Given Sunday'. The Roman army, led by
General Maximus (Russell Crowe), engages in bloody
combat with an incompetent squad of Germanians, and
comes out victorious. The battle brings to an end
another tireless war, and the dying king Marcus
Aurelius (Richard Harris) feels that it is time to
pass his crown on to another man.
The expected choice would be Aurelius' son, the
brutally unscrupulous Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). But
Aurelius has a different agenda, and tells General
Maximus in closed quarters that it is he who he wants
as heir. When not on the battlefield, Maximus is a
humble farmer with a wife and son, and claims not to
know a thing about Rome and/or politics. Aurelius
claims that his lack of political knowledge proves
only that he has not been corrupted by Roman wealth,
unlike his son.
When Commodus learns of his father's proposal to
Maximus, he murders his father and then orders Maximus
to be put to death. Maximus escapes his execution, and
his wife and son suffer the fate that he was planned
to receive. In the desert, a wounded Maximus is
captured and sold as a slave to a man who plans
barbaric gladiator fights in large stadiums. Because
of his former stature in the army, he is quite a
fighter, and becomes known as `The Spaniard'. He plans
to use his new `power', and some help from the radiant
Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), to help exact his revenge on
her brother, Commodus.
`Gladiator' is full of intense, strategic scenes of
gladiatorial battle, and beautiful, wide-angle
cinematography. It is a slick action film,
entertaining and often thrilling, but if Ridley Scott
is aspiring to a sweeping, `Braveheart'-like epic,
then his work is unsuccessful. `Gladiator's' plotline
is the generic revenge tale, somewhere along the lines
of `Hamlet' and `The Count of Monte Cristo'. 
`Gladiator' is glorious on a technical level, but the
emotional aspects of the film are not on par. Crowe's
Maximus is a traditional hero, Phoenix's Commodus his
traditional villain, and like most action films,
`Gladiator' is traditionally predictable. Though the
film has been blamed for some historical inaccuracies,
the period detail of ancient Rome seems particularly
genuine.
Ridley Scott is a master of the movie blockbuster, and
his films are often revered by his legion of fans long
after their original release. Despite a number of
shortcomings, `Gladiator', a film magnificent in its
scope, should prove to be no exception. It is a
wonderful way to kick off a long summer.

Ridley Scott's ("Blade Runner", "Alien") "Gladiator" is the kind of movie
that hasn't been seen in a very long time: A massive, sprawling epic of a
picture which is a shock to the senses. This is the kind of movie that
Hollywood hasn't made in past years due to the enormous budget required to
recreate ancient Rome. Now, thanks to computers and the miracle called CGI,
Hollywood can show us Rome in all its glory. Speaking of glory, what a
glorious movie "Gladiator" is. Not only does Scott's Rome look fantastic,
but so do the costumes, the gorgeous cinematography, and the amazing battle
scenes. "Gladiator" is the sort of movie that will leave you staring
slack-jawed at the majestic proceedings unfolding before you. This is the
sort of film which isn't merely watched, it is experienced.
Maximus (Russell Crowe) is a brilliant and respected Roman general, fighting
the barbarian hordes of Germania. After defeating the barbarians, Maximus
has only one dream to follow: to return to his wife and son back in Rome.
However, Caesar Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) is dying, and he refuses to
let his amoral son, Commodus (Joquin Phoenix), succeed him as emperor. He
wants Maximus to take the throne until the time is right to hand the kingdom
over to the senate. Commodus, infuriated by his father's decision,
assassinates him and then sends Maximus off to be executed. Maximus escapes
his executioners, only to find that Commodus has slain his family and
destroyed his home. After wandering blindly for awhile, he is picked up by a
slave caravan and sold to Proximo (the late Oliver Reed), a man who buys
slaves and trains them to become gladiators. Now Maximus has returned to
Rome to compete in the arena and find a way to get his revenge.
While the previews might lead you to believe that "Gladiator" is nothing
more than a whole lot of arena fighting and one or two large battles, they
are a tad misleading. There are, in fact, only four major arena fights and
one large battle scene at the film's beginning. The rest of the film is
filled with political intrigue and watching Commodus slime his way through
his emperorship. This doesn't mean the film is boring, far from it in fact.
Two and a half hours have seldom felt so short as they did in this movie.
While the political goings on may be interesting, the vast majority of
audiences are seeing "Gladiator" for the fights, and they are certainly
worthwhile. The battles which take place in the Roman Coliseum are fast
paced and exciting; particularly one involving a one on one fight between
Maximus and an undefeated gladiator. The two go at it, with swords and axes
flying, while tigers circle, waiting for one of them to get too close.
Acting obviously isn't supposed to be a high point in a movie like this, but
when Russell Crowe ("LA Confidential", "The Insider") is involved you can
expect at least one great performance. The real surprise was that nearly the
entire cast turned in great performances. Joquin Phoenix ("8MM") is suitably
slimy and evil as the ambitious emperor, despite my fears that I would be
able to see him as nothing more than River Phoenix's little brother. Connie
Nielsen ("Mission to Mars") gives a nice, almost understated turn as
Commodus' sister and love interest (remember, ancient Rome and incest tend
to go hand in hand). Oliver Reed ("The Big Sleep") gives a great final
performance as the greedy Proximo. I found it interesting how Reed's
character was recreated through CGI after his death. Watch for Djimon
Hounsou ("Amistad") and Duane Johnson (professional wrestling's The Rock) as
fellow gladiators.
There are two more things I must point out as being simply great about
"Gladiator". First is the score, which I can only hope Academy members will
remember at the end of the year. Composer Hans Zimmer ("The Thin Red Line")
has created a truly magnificent and moving body of music here (I went out
and bought the soundtrack the next day). The music played during the battles
is fierce and rousing, causing your heart to pound just as much as the
action does. The other great moment in the movie is the opening battle
scene, which simply must be witnessed on the big screen. During this battle,
we see wide panning shots of massive Roman legions marching towards
barbarian hordes; flaming arrows flying overhead; a burning forest in the
background; and some wonderfully choreographed fight scenes. I'd recommend
everyone see "Gladiator" on the big screen rather than waiting for video.
I'm certain it's going to lose a lot of its power on the small screen. The
film runs 154 minutes, but believe me, it won't feel nearly that long. I
give "Gladiator" a well earned four and a half out of five stars.

Another Hollywood wannabe epic film made mostly for the sake of wooing Oscar 
voters with its classic
story of eternal love and quest for vengeance. 
It's a guy movie and a chick flick at the same time. It has many exciting and 
bloody battle scenes which
service the plot about a Roman war general named Maximus (Russell Crowe) who 
was about to become
the next leader of the great empire until heir-apparent Commodus (Joaquin 
Phoenix) has him removed.
Commodus becomes an arrogant, selfish emperor who uses his power to service 
his own desires instead of
doing what's good for Rome. 
At 150 minutes the film is a bit overlong but at least its story is full of 
detail so pay close attention. The basic
plot is familiar and very Shakespearean, but the gladiator life Maximus finds 
himself trapped in is the most
interesting aspect of the film. Not as good as "Spartacus" or "Braveheart" 
but it's a fine effort.

Rave reviews about this movie have been trickling onto the Net for months
now. Russell Crowe is an extremely hot commodity after his Oscar nomination
for THE INSIDER, and Ridley Scott has been due for a big movie for some time
now. With all of these expectations brewing in my little head, I was just
asking to be disappointed in this hyped film, but once I got into my seat,
absorbed battle scene after crazy battle scene, I couldn't help but be drawn
into this motion picture event myself. See it for yourself. It's solid.
PLOT:
A highly respected general of the Roman Empire is stripped of his livelihood
and family, when the son of the recently deceased Emperor decides that he is
a threat to his leadership. Enslaved and forced to join the gladiator
circuit and fight for survival, it isn't long before the fallen man
discovers a way to return to Rome and face the man who ruined his life.
CRITIQUE:
A sprawling epic set ablaze by massive sets, genuine authenticity, awesome
battle sequences and yes, even a good ol' fashioned story dipped in love,
power and revenge. And to top it off, this film officially christens Russell
Crowe as an all-out "movie star", a man laced with superior acting talent,
an impressive body of work and a rugged handsomeness to boot! Having seen
him in several interviews, Crowe comes across as the ultimate unpretentious
actor, whose down-to-earth manner and subtle charm endears him to most
anyone who follows his work. A man's man starring in a film created for men,
but ultimately accessible to all. The film's strong points are
unquestionably highlighted in its various battle scenes, but don't let it be
said that these fights are set adrift in a plot-less movie. In fact, many
internal struggles take place in this picture with love, redemption,
revenge, honor, tradition, allegiance and blackmail all making personal
appearances. For perverts, incest also plays a part in the festivities,
albeit a small one, but it is the film's sheer scale which demonstrates its
grandest achievement. All we kept thinking about as we walked out of the
theatre was how Hollywood has been rebooting crappy TV shows into movies for
the past decade now, and no one, and I mean no one, ever thought to bring
back the Roman action flicks.
Kudos to Ridley Scott for having the balls to go ahead with it, and further
kudos to him for managing to pull it off so magnificently. God knows copycat
producers are already developing various incarnations of this film for next
summer, but this will surely be the one to remember. You always remember
your first. A couple of minor complaints of mine include the so-so showing
by Phoenix, who seemed to be "acting" a little too much for my taste, some
scenes which dragged on for a few minutes too long, and the general
predictability of the story. Of course, none of these minor details made
much of a dent in my overall enjoyment of the movie, which was all but
certified with a great ending, accentuated by some effective emotional
drama. Yes...I even got a little choked up. Of course, you don't have to
take my word for it, you can read just about every other review of this film
on the Net, the majority of which praise the movie through and through. In
the end, you will more than likely get your money's worth on this picture if
the story and trailer appeals to you. Now put your hands together and
welcome back...the epic motion picture!!
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Russell Crowe had no problem packing on 40 pounds for his Oscar-nominated
role in THE INSIDER, but took much longer to lose the weight for this film.
With his cholesterol level being at such a high rate, the Australian actor
only managed to lose 5 pounds after his first five weeks of working out
alone. Russell also accepted the role on a giant leap of faith. When
presented to him, they basically said "We don't have a script which is good
now, but we've got a concept. Ridley Scott...185 A.D...you start the movie
as a Roman General. Want to talk to Ridley?" Russell immediately agreed.
He's been acting since the age of six and smoking since the age of ten.
Joaquin Phoenix was born with a cleft lip, and is the younger brother of
late actor River Phoenix. Joaquin was the one who made the 911 phone call on
the night his brother overdosed at the Viper Room.
The character of Maximus is purely fictional, but the rest are all drawn out
of the history books.
Actor Oliver Reed, who portrayed the role of Proximo in this film, died of
apparent heart failure toward the end of filming.

Rated on a 4-star scale
Screening venue: Odeon (Liverpool City Centre)
Released in the UK by UIP on May 12, 2000; certificate 15; 150 minutes; 
country of origin USA; aspect ratio 2.35:1
Directed by Ridley Scott; produced by David Franzoni, Branko Lustig, Douglas 
Wick.
Written by David Franzoni, John Logan, William Nicholson; from a story by 
David Franzoni.
Photographed by John Mathieson; edited by Pietro Scalia.
Ridley Scott's "Gladiator" is an interesting and attractive action movie, but 
not a very forceful one. It needs to spend more time with the gladiator 
himself. This is a "hero out for revenge" picture that keeps cutting away to 
its cardboard villain, just as we're starting to cheer on the protagonist. 
It's like channel-hopping between "Spartacus" and "Caligula".
Russell Crowe stars as Maximus, a Roman army general under emperor Marcus 
Aurelius (Richard Harris). Marcus is so impressed by Maximus's leadership 
that he appoints him as his successor. His son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) is 
not best pleased by this news, as he himself had expected to be next in line 
for the throne. Commodus kills his father, seizes power, and orders the death 
penalty for Maximus and his family.
Of course, Maximus escapes this fate, but his wife and child do not. Then 
Maximus is kidnapped and sold into slavery. His master, Proximo (Oliver 
Reed), forces him to become a gladiator, and when his military training leads 
to great slaughtering talent, Proximo takes him to Rome, to perform at the 
Coliseum. There the crowd falls in love with him, which forces Commodus into 
an awkward position; yes, he's found Maximus, but he can't deal with him, 
because if he kills him then he'll lose the support of his people.
The movie is basically taken up by Maximus and Commodus doing a lot of 
plotting against each other, punctuated by lofty speeches and gruesome 
fights. That is as it should be. The problem is that we don't spend enough 
time with Maximus -- the film is divided pretty much equally between him and 
the enemy, when it needs to be much more single-minded. Look at "Ben-Hur" or 
"Braveheart" -- these films are driven completely by their heroes' 
determination, and that's why we get emotionally involved. Crowe gives a 
great performance as Maximus -- he has a penetrating stare, commanding voice, 
muscular body and towering demeanour. He's a powerful, passionate Hollywood 
lead, and we want to invest our care in him. We just don't get the chance.
Because "Gladiator" never gets us wrapped up in Maximus's struggle, the 
action sequences are not as tense or affecting as they should be. We can't 
simply enjoy the excitement of the violence, either, because it's not 
stimulating, it's sick. Roman bloodlust is one of the most shameful things in 
history, and Scott, the director, presents it realistically, throwing us into 
the middle of gladiator fights by way of giddy close-ups and shutter speeds, 
while the chants of the despicable onlookers thunder at our ears in stereo 
surround sound.
What we have here, ultimately, is one amazing piece of acting and several 
flourishes of wonderful technique, spoiled by unwanted distractions. The 
overall bold, colourful nature of the filmmaking might have been enough to 
recommend the picture if its better parts hadn't led us to expect something 
superior. Strange: "Gladiator" would have been a more enjoyable movie if it 
had been made with less skill.

     It has been many years since we have had a film about ancient
Rome of the sort we have gotten from Ridley Scott, and in some ways
we have never had a film like this.  This is a sort of post-modern
ancient Rome.  I expected to love the giant battle scenes.  But they
start early in the film and my eye kept rebelling at what it was
seeing.  Something was wrong with the images I was seeing.  Scott
has always played with his visual images.  He used to shoot through
incense to create an odd filtered effect.  In GLADIATOR he was doing
a lot more.  I cannot authoritatively say what Scott was doing but
it looked like images in the background were filmed normally, images
in the foreground were moving more jerkily.  I could be wrong, but
it seemed that instead of the foreground images being different each
frame, they were kept on the screen for a count of two or perhaps
even three frames each.  This is impossible to do with normal
filming but it is quite possible with digital processing of images.
For me the irritation is about the same as if there was a buzz on
the soundtrack.  I suppose Scott may have felt that it enhanced the
mythic effect.  Time and again images in the film felt like they had
been tampered with and were somehow off-kilter.  Perhaps I was
over-sensitive, but it was an annoyance that just had to be ignored.
     Of course, Ridley Scott does odd experiments with the visuals.
In this film he frequently plays with fog or smoke.  Other times he
uses backgrounds that look more like postcards than reality.  The
film is heavy on sunrises and sunsets.  Other scenes play with
color.
     The film covers the same historic interval and figures as THE
FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE (1964) and some of the incidents of this
film are borrowed from that rather than history.  Even the fictional
character Livius in the 1964 was carried over as the hero Maximus.
The emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) is off in snowy
Germania where he is in the last stages of victory over the
barbarians.  His general Maximus (Russell Crowe) is "unleashing
hell" against the last stronghold of resistance.  Unleashing hell is
releasing the kind of power one probably would have thought required
modern weapons.  The scene fully justifies the fear that most of the
world at that time had of the Romans.  But the most powerful
position in the known world is about to change hands.
     Philosopher and gentle soul Marcus Aurelius wants to restore
the Republic that Julius Caesar abolished.  He knows his son
Commodus is too anxious for power to restore the republic so Marcus
plans to name Maximus as his successor, entrusting him to return the
republic.  But when Marcus breaks this news to Commodus, Commodus
murders his father.  To complete the task he also has a contingent
of men take Maximus to be murdered and another to kill his family.
The general does not die so easily, however.  The attempt to kill
Maximus only leaves him wounded and wandering, then collected as a
slave.  The slave is purchased by a wise old gladiator-turned-
freeman and gladiator-dealer Proximo (Oliver Reed in his last and
probably best role).  The gladiator, now called "the Spaniard" is
sent to Rome to fight before Emperor Commodus, where he hopes he may
work his revenge.  Tired of the war, tired of seeing death, and
disillusioned about the causes he has fought for, the gladiator is
sent to Rome to fight and die in front of audiences anxious to see
death.
     The plot borrows from THE TEN COMMANDMENTS the ruler who
creates jealousy in his son by choosing another as an heir.  It
borrows from BEN HUR the blood feud of old close friends.  There is
even a line borrowed from THE UNTOUCHABLES.  Of course, there is a
lot of SPARTACUS and THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.  The major plot
elements are not new.  But most of what is borrowed is from films of
the last generation.  And some of what is new, like the Ken-
Russell-style surrealistic scenes, seems far more out of place than
they would seem in a film of modern setting.
     Ridley Scott is a reasonable action director with a good feel
for integrating actors with special visual effects.  Somehow Russell
Crowe seems out of place in an ancient setting.  It took a while to
get used to him.  Joaquin Phoenix is actually a little too dignified
and reserved the psychotic Commodus.  For once an actor could have
chewed the scenery and been more faithful to the history books.  It
seems almost cliche to say that an actor who died in the production
gave one of his best performances, but it is true of Oliver Reed who
finally has overcome the stiffness of his earlier acting.  Connie
Nielsen as Lucilla is appealing, though it is a little strange to
see the demure actress cast in the role that in 1964 went to Sophia
Loren.  Derek Jacobi plays a Senator trying to preserve the Senate.
The score by Hans Zimmer is not one of his most memorable.  He is
quick to capitalize on a minor location in Africa, probably because
the LION KING composer is not known for his German or Latin musical
themes.
     With a few reservations for Scott's visual style this is
pleasant return of a type of film we have not seen made since the
60s.  I rate it an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the -4 to
+4 scale.
     This film grossly misrepresents the Emperor Commodus whose
actual wacko quotient rivaled Caligula's and Nero's.  The real
Commodus renamed the months of the year to be his twelve titles so
that he might be worshipped each month.  He renamed Rome "The Colony
of Commodus."  He identified himself with Hercules and he would
dress for the role in lion skins and would beat prisoners to death
with a large wooden club.  He would fight in amphitheater as a
gladiator, but would give his opponent a nearly useless lead sword.
Commodus would slaughter animals in the ring, including elephants
and giraffes.  He would behead ostriches with arrows headed with
crescent razors.  All this could have been shown in GLADIATOR and
would have been quite cinematic.  Instead he is reserved and almost
dignified.  As Roman Emperors go, Commodus as portrayed in GLADIATOR
might almost have been respectable.
     It should be noted Commodus showed far more tolerance of
Christians than his father Marcus Aurelius had.  His motives are
open to speculation.
     Eventually those closest to him grew tired of living in the
fear of his capricious displeasure and the immediate death that
might follow.  A conspiracy, likely headed by his mistress Marcia,
poisoned his drink one day on his return from hunting.  When he fell
asleep rather than dying a young wrestler, Narcissus, strangled him
without him resisting.
     Both GLADIATOR and THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, however, have
him die in a dramatic sword fight with the former general of the
German campaign.  In both that general was also a former friend of
Commodus favored for emperor by Marcus Aurelius over Commodus.
Actually Marcus Aurelius had publicly named Commodus his heir and
there is not likely to be any historic record that Marcus favored
anyone else.
     As has been pointed out in the arena the signals were not
thumbs up or thumbs down, it was thumb hidden in fist for life,
thumb sticking out for death.  But the first responsibility of the
director is to communicate hat is going on.  The actors are speaking
English, but they have to speak the audience's language.  The
audience knows thumbs up and thumbs down.
     So there are inaccuracies, but if one waits to the end of the
credits the film clearly says that some of the characters are real
but that the story is fiction.  With that in mind the accuracy of
this film is not at all bad.

Ridley Scott is one of those directors that makes good quality films but yet
has no stamp of his own.  Watching 'Alien', 'Blade Runner', 'Black Rain',
'Thelma and Louise' and 'G.I. Jane' would give you no hint that it's the
same guy.  Even though most directors have that look or feel that ignite
their names in the minds of audiences through camera angles or injections of
sub plot, I have never felt that way about Scott but I do admire his films
greatly.  'Gladiator' is a broad, sweeping epic film that pays tribute to
Shakespeare in its tone, 'Ben-Hur' in its combat scenes and 'Spartacus' in
its heroics.  What makes the film work is that these influences are not
obvious.  The film is skillfully presented in such a way as to give the
viewer a fresh perspective of the Hollywood epic without ripping off those
that came before it.
One thing that has to be mentioned right off the bat is the performance of
Russell Crowe.  This guy is one of the next generation, an actor of
downright diversity and intensity who thrives at not being stereotyped.
>From an unorthodox cop in early 1950's Los Angeles in 1997's 'L.A.
Confidential' to a whistle blowing, conscience stricken tobacco executive in
'The Insider' to a vengeful Roman army soldier, Crowe, along with the likes
of Kevin Spacey, Edward Norton and Tom Hanks, will takes over for Pacino,
Hackman, Hoffman, De Niro and Nicholson when they retire from films.
In 'Gladiator' Crowe plays General Maximus, a loyal and seemingly
unstoppable combat soldier in the Roman empire's army some 2000 years ago
who builds a family like relationship with the Caesar of the times named
Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris).  The bond between these two men is similar
to the bond between a father and son but evil would soon lurk its ugly head
between the passage of this great bond.  After winning a major battle,
Marcus Aurelius secretly tells Maximus that he will name him as successor to
the throne of Rome and this does not go over with Marcus Aurelius' son
Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix).  Before news of the succession can get out,
Commodus murders his father and tries to kill General Maximus and
does kill Maximus' entire family.  Maximus thrives on his fugitive
situation and has one goal: survival.....so he can have his vengeance later.
Connie
Nielsen plays Commodus' sister who was once Maximus' flame and is sort of
caught in a catch-22 in all of the treachery that plays out and Derek Jacobi
is casted well as a Roman senator.
In the slave world Maximus is purchased by Proximo (Oliver Reed) and this
man makes his living training gladiators and finds a hot property with
Maximus who is victorious at every turn and even defeats well established
legends in the minds of the spectators and quickly becomes a new hero to
them.  There are greats scenes of sword play, brutal hand to hand combat and
confrontations with such fierce creatures as tigers.  The cinematography by
John Mathieson is breath taking and his work is an early contender for an
Oscar.
One thing I didn't like about this film is the fact that Ridley Scott, in
filming his action sequences, plays with too many close up shots where the
action scurries around in a whirlwind of dust, smoke and fast moves so much
so that we cannot focus entirely on the action at hand and the editing
process throughout all of this is somewhat rushed and comes off as aloof at
several points.
One thing that makes 'Gladiator' work well on many levels is the advent of
computer technology.  There are many crowd scenes and architectural
landscapes that were obviously generated by computers because if the cost of
so many extras were put forward along with the cost of building and erecting
many Roman like city structures for the given era, the film would have cost
about the same as it did to make 'Titanic'.....a cool 200 million dollars.
Compared with that film, 'Gladiator' came in at a much lower 103 million
dollars because things were not built to scale the way they were in
'Titanic' where James Cameron had a relic of the famous boat built 90% to
scale.  I remember someone from the cast of 'Ben-Hur' saying that if a film
like 'Ben-Hur' were made in this day and age it would probably cost 200 or
even 300 million dollars to produce.  'Gladiator' has now been made in a
time where computer effects look authentic and not cheesy and combined with
many other scenes, I defy anyone to tell the difference between the fake
stuff and the reality in every single detail of the film's labour.
Through the eyes of death, the struggle between good and evil and the
resolution of the film's climax, 'Gladiator' pays tribute to the most high
end of Shakespearean art and will leave the audience finding a whole new
perspective on a genre of film some thought might be buried indefinitely.
Thank goodness it's not.
A film must receive a three star rating or higher to be eligible for a
recommendation.

Russell Crowe appeared in LA CONFIDENTIAL and THE INSIDER, which were among 
the very best films of 1997 and 1999.  His anchor role in this year's 
GLADIATOR seals the film's place as one of the best released in the first 
half of 2000.
What's so good about this guy's acting?  Perhaps that he's rather 
unassuming; Crowe often seems to play the role of the general-turned-slave 
Maximus without effort.   He's the opposite of a showoff or a ham or an 
over-actor.  And as anyone from Laurence Olivier to John Wayne knew, 
understatement is best.  In his mid-thirties, slimmed down from his role as 
Jeffrey Wigand in THE INSIDER, Crowe inhabits his character with the proper 
authority and confidence.  Maximus is tough, muscular, and not afraid to 
fight hand-to-hand and risk dying with his men.
The film starts by chronicling the northern armies of Rome in a battle 
against a Germanic horde in 180 A.D.  In the scenes of preparation through 
the battle itself, the film engages us with the most striking battle footage 
since the first half hour of Speilberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  Ancient Rome 
surely sustained massive war machines, and director Ridley Scott simulates 
them very well here.  There are the archers shooting flaming arrows;  there 
are the precursors to artillery, huge incendiary bombs launched from 
catapults, the charges exploding on impact with the trees sheltering the 
enemy.  Finally, there's the combat itself, the armored legions marching 
against the whooping middle European natives.  It does not make the best 
statements about imperialism or empire-building, but the material here does 
grip and hold our attention.  And it's all the more interesting because of 
the hand-held cameras, the choppy film speed and the wonderful graininess.  
Even when you have full color at your disposal, you don't need to use it, 
Scott is telling us wisely.
So Maximus is victorious, and he is complimented by the emperor himself, 
Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris).  It's not long before this Caesar asks his 
best general what he wants; Maximus replies he wants to return to his wife 
and son, and their farm, outside of Rome.  Of course the complication is 
that the emperor, who loves Maximus as a son, offers him a form of power of 
succession.  Maximus would not be a dictator, which Marcus and previous 
Caesars have been; instead, he would serve as a sort of sergeant-at-arms for 
the Roman Empire, the administration and actual power returning to the 
Senate.  Rome would once again be the republic it was at its founding.
More intrigue surfaces when the emperor's real son and daughter enter.  We 
first see them ushered to the battle  after the death-dealing is done  in 
a luxurious coach.  Joaquin Phoenix plays Commodus, who believes he will be 
the next dictator.  His sister Lucilla is played by Connie Nielson;  this 
character is supposed to be the smarter of the two, the more politically 
canny and the wiser.  She had also apparently been involved with Maximus 
before his marriage to another.
It's clear that GLADIATOR will take the path of a revenge story, and the 
cause for revenge unfolds quickly.  Commodus makes sure his father's wishes 
are never formally broadcast, and commits a heinous combination of crimes: 
patricide and regicide!  Refusing to pledge loyalty to the heir, Maximus is 
sent off to be executed.  Experienced fighter that he is, he survives, 
foreshadowing the fighting he must do later  always against enemies of 
greater numbers and armament.
The main motivator for vengeance?  The ambitious and ruthless Commodus has 
Maxmimus' wife and son slaughtered -- terrorized and crucified.  By this 
time, of course, it's the audience's desire to see Commodus get his just 
deserts.  This predictability is one of the film's few flaws.
As the childish, hateful young emperor, Joaquin Phoenix is miscast.  He is 
despicable, yes, but he also seems to have to put the most effort into his 
role.  Phoenix delivers the least naturalistic, the least transparent, 
performance among the major players.
Connie Nielson as Lucilla is fascinating:  her character is perhaps the most 
complex in the film.  Where her loyalties lie is unclear for much of the 
narrative.  In one memorable scene, she tries to use her history and 
physical wiles with Maximus to get him to reveal her father's wishes.  
Nielson also plays a loving mother well.  Her son Lucius is apparently the 
male heir after Commodus.  She is extremely cautious around her brother, 
particularly in a scene in which Commodus watches the sleeping boy closely.  
Fortunately, Scott and screenwriters David Franzoni, John Logan and William 
Nicholson only imply Commodus' sexual perversion; there are no scenes 
involving sex.  Commodus' incestuous tendencies are shown more clearly with 
his sister.
Oliver Reed does a nice turn as the slave trader and gladiator trainer 
Proximo.  Reed died not long after finishing the film.  His character is 
deeply conflicted; he doesn't know whether to assist the man he has 
discovered is a general, or to make all the pieces of gold he can.  Reed is 
perfect for this role, the sinews on his thick neck standing out with age, 
the cadences of his British accent mixing well with the accent assumed by 
Crowe.
Another strong supporting actor is Derek Jacobi as Senator Gracchus.  He 
looks a little too gentle and wise to be involved with such dark politics; 
nevertheless, Jacobi's manner gets us quickly aligned with his cause, which 
is the same cause Maximus is willing to die for.
Djimon Hounsou is nicely cast as a captured slave, one who offers kindness 
to the wounded general  or the `Spaniard,' as Maximus is known among the 
gladiators he trains and fights among.  Hounsou shades his portrayal with a 
natural friendliness.
Special effects are stunning in GLADIATOR.        We view them mainly in the scenes 
showing ancient Rome, the immense and pillared structure, the impressive 
statuary, the painstakingly recreated Old World flavor of a living city.  
Recent speculation about the Coliseum, for instance, has made it into this 
film: historians believe long poles depended from the top, and from these 
poles hung sail-like awning, the closest thing to a retractable partial-roof 
of its time.  Wonderful details confront us: it would take more than one 
viewing to notice everything.  The only reservation I have about large scale 
backgrounds like the ones here is that they sometimes appear ultra-real, 
almost plastic  too-clear video images in a feature film.  It's better 
they're here, though.
Other special effects are employed in sequences that simulate dreams.  The 
initial image starting the film shows a warrior's hand skimming the tops of 
wheat stalks, and later we see definite imagery of death as Maximus dreams 
of meeting his son and wife in the Elysian fields.  We even notice some 
early Christian references.  Although the gods are mentioned, we hear 
Maximus praying to "Blessed Mother' and `Father.'  And he meditates with 
small statues of his wife and child.  It's easy to see how Christianity was 
developing at the time this story takes place; Scott is to be commended for 
showing the spirituality of some of his main characters.
Music by Lisa Gerrard (from the group Dead Can Dance) and well-known 
Hollywood score master Hans Zimmer is smooth and haunting.  Gerrard's voice 
sounds like it's from the Middle East, assisted by ancient instruments.  The 
CD would be a good investment.
The film is rated R for graphic violence.  I counted only one vile word, 
which could find its way into PG-13 rated fare.  GLADIATOR would be fine for 
those 15 and up.  The violent scenes are not tame, but neither are they done 
in a way that glorifies violence.

"Gladiator" is silly, overblown, and shallow. Perfect. It's highly
flawed, with many glaring defects immediately visible. Lovely. It
represents the worst kind of Hollywood excess, great sums of money
thrown at something ultimately pointless. Yee-haw! At the risk of
having my "serious film critic" certification revoked, I'm also going
to have to say that "Gladiator" is fun. It kicks ass. It totally
rules, dude. This movie forced itself on me; it made me have fun in
spite of myself. That's not supposed to happen -- I'm supposed to be a
serious, studious, jaded film critic! I did not think that "Gladiator"
was the greatest movie ever, but I suspect many critics are having the
same reaction I did (and some to a much greater extent): "Gladiator"
is greater than the sum of its parts. It turns critics into
hypocrites. Cool, huh?
This is the story of Maximus (Russell Crowe), top general in the Roman
Army and favorite of the current, aging emperor (Richard
Harris). After a major victory, the emperor calls Maximus in and tells
him that he, and not the emperor's cowardly son Commodus (Joaquin
Phoenix), will be named heir to the throne. Maximus is stunned by this
news, but he requests to return to his family once his military duties
are over. The emperor begs him to think about the offer before making
a decision, and Maximus agrees.  Unfortunately, he never gets to make
that decision, because Commodus kills his father upon hearing the
news, and by making it look like a natural death, is able to claim
innocence. Since no one else knew about the late emperor's offer, the
throne goes to Commodus, and the new emperor's first decision is to
order death upon Maximus and his family. Maximus manages to escape his
execution and is sold into slavery, eventually ending up in the hands
of Proximo (Oliver Reed), a trainer of gladiators. Maximus vows to get
his revenge by fighting his way to Rome and killing the emperor, but
he must stay alive long enough to do so.
"Gladiator" can easily be nit-picked to death. There are a lot of
little things wrong with it. The dialogue, for example, is usually
functional and unassuming, but the odd unintentional knee-slapper does
sneak in. (The early "emotional" scene between Commodus and his father
elicited a few chuckles from the audience, though I don't think it was
supposed to.) Sometimes the heroism gets a little overblown: Does
everyone need to react in overblown emotional fashion to everything?
And the characters mostly remain shallow archetypes; there's not a
whole lot of development here. Maximus is a good, honest man with a
short fuse, while Commodus is a slimy, cowardly snake who calculates
behind closed doors. The screenwriters make a few lame attempts at
developing these two, but their attempts generally fall flat. A family
for Maximus? Great, but we never really get to know them. Commodus
shows signs of an incestuous relationship with his sister Lucilla
(Connie Nielsen)? That wasn't necessary; we already know he's a bad
guy.
But despite all these problems, "Gladiator" still manages to be an
enjoyable ride, and I think part of the reason is Crowe. He has easy
charisma, which is instantly perceivable to the audience as soon as he
steps in front of the camera. We *want* to root for him. Crowe has
that elusive Mel Gibson quality: He's attractive to both men and women
(for sometimes different -- and sometimes similar -- reasons), he has
a voice that can make even the most banal lines sound sincere, and the
more he gets beaten and bloodied, the more we love him. Even when the
script gets preposterous, Crowe keeps it grounded in humanity with his
naturally honest performance, bringing his character more sympathy
than the script afforded him. If the early audience reaction to
"Gladiator" is any indication, Crowe could have a long and prosperous
career ahead of him.
Ridley Scott directs the film with some efficiency; his only real
missteps are some befuddling decisions he makes on how to film
transitions. Shots of clouds moving rapidly across the sky look great
-- but they belong in another movie. Most of "Gladiator" is grimy,
earthy, and grounded. This means that when Scott tries for an ethereal
feel between scenes, it's jarring. But that's okay; the battle
sequences deliver the goods.  Desiring to create whirling dervishes of
action, Scott does away with long establishing shots here; you get a
quick set-up detailing who's fighting who, and then the camera starts
spinning. Some may find this disorienting, and I can't really blame
them: Sometimes it is hard to tell what's going on.  But that's pretty
much the point. Real gladiator battles probably weren't carefully
choreographed dances. They were ugly, brutal, and short.  Scott's
accomplishment is in finding split-second pauses in the chaos to
center on one beautiful image, suggesting everything that has gone on
before it, before moving on to the next bit of jumbled action. You get
a shot of a gladiator raising his spear, some whirling movement, and
then a shot of an impaled foe. Put the pieces together.
It's hard to figure out what makes "Gladiator" so darn fun to watch.
It's not particularly original; the story and events have largely been
stolen from "Spartacus" and "Braveheart." The acting, while good (I
particularly liked the supporting turns from Oliver Reed and Derek
Jacobi, as a sympathetic senator), doesn't really stand out. The
battle scenes are exhilarating, but nothing new. The political
intrigue does provide some points of interest, especially in the
comparisons of the gladiator games to modern spectacles, professional
wrestling in particular. For example, the central conflict could
parallel any number of recent WWF storylines, with Maximus the popular
anti-hero and Commodus the reviled heel who cannot defeat the hero
without first winning over the crowd. Scott even seems to be making a
point here about the whole spectacle: Marx's famous quote about
religion being the "opiate of the masses" fairly describes Scott's
attitude towards spectator sports. Commodus uses the games to keep the
people complacent while he seizes power for himself. At one point,
Maximus screams to the bloodthirsty crowd, "Are you entertained?!" Is
Scott suggesting the audience question their own responses to his
bloody battle scenes?  Perhaps.
But even the political intrigue and contemporary references aren't the
real focus of the film; "Gladiator" is plot-driven, not
theme-driven. And that brings up the same question: What makes
"Gladiator" good? Considering that no one single part of it really
stands out, it ought to come off as a fairly mediocre film. But for
some reason, it doesn't, and I think I know why: "Gladiator" is an
*epic*, in every sense of the word, making liberal use of modern
technology to produce a movie in the Old Hollywood style. Sure, it's
no "Spartacus." It's not even "Braveheart." But all the right elements
are here: A hero who falls, only to rise again. A villain who thinks
he has the upper hand, only to have his one mistake come back to bite
him. Romance, politics, action -- what more could you ask for?
"Gladiator" isn't groundbreaking, but it's good old-fashioned
entertainment.

Starring Russel Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed,
Djimon Hounsou. Rated R
It must have been a hell of a gamble. Making a $100 million Roman epic,
the likes of which we haven't seen in decades, with no automatic-draw
stars and few merchandising opportunities is hardly a sure bet but one
that seems to be paying off mightily. Gladiator, a breathtaking trip
through the 180 A.D. Roman Empire, is a rarity: an unabashedly
grandiose production with one major priority: entertainment. If there
is any subtext or moral in the film, it is purely secondary. This is a
big, all-stops-out blockbuster and it delivers.
The film opens with a battle scene rivaling the notorious invasion
sequence at the beginning of Saving Private Ryan in scope. Maximus
(Russel Crowe) is a general leading great Roman Emperor Marcus
Aurelius's army in a fight to put down a widespread rebellion. The
cunning Maximus wins easily. After the battle, Aurelius calls Maximus
into his chambers. Knowing that his time on Earth is coming to an end,
the old Emperor gives the throne to Maximus. The two are not related,
but they love each other like brothers and Aurelius truly believes that
this general will do the best job as ruler of the vast empire.
The news doesn't please Aurelius's son Commodus (the unrecognizable
Joaquin Phoenix). The corrupt, power-hungry prince is outraged at his
father's betrayal and kills him before he can officially announce his
successor. He then sends Maximus off to be executed. Unbeknownst to
Commodus, Maximus escapes but thinking that he is dead, Commodus kills
his family. After finding this out, the injured Maximus collapses on
the ground. He is discovered by slave traders and sold to Proximo
(Oliver Reed), an organizer of gladiator matches.
So Maximus is forced to participate in these cruel, lurid battles to
the death. He quickly wins over the audience and becomes the most
popular gladiator around. When the action unexpectedly shifts from a
small "suburban" arena to the big kahuna itself -- the Collosseum in
Rome -- a showdown between Maximus and the corrupt Commodus, against
whom Maximus has vowed revenge, seems inevitable. Commodus's sister
(Connie Nielsen) offers Maximus her services in helping destroy her
malevolent brother.
Ridley Scott, bless his soul, is an extremely skilled technical and
visual director and he knows exactly what he is doing. The
aforementioned opening scene is heartstopping: fast and furious but
also riveting and suspenseful. There is so much going on but Scott
presents it so well that not only do we understand what's going on but
our eyes are glued to the screen. It's an excellent hook, grabbing my
attention from the word go.
In later scenes, Scott shows a penchant for taking bloody, often
gruesome scenes and turning them into crowdpleasers. This may not be
the most moral approach to a film like this, but damned if it wasn't
fun -- and when Crowe, after brutally dismembering a rival, asks the
cheering stadium audience if they've been entertained, we feel a quick
twinge of shame because we realize that we've just been entertained by
the exact same thing. Gladiator somehow strikes a balance, keeping the
moralizing minimal enough so that we can still enjoy the rest of the
action and not feel too guilty about it. This is a movie that has its
priorities straight.
Russel Crowe, undergoing an unbelievable transformation from a chunky
tobacco Insider to a beefy Gladiator, is quickly proving himself to be
an amazingly versatile actor. There is not a trace here of the Russel
Crowe we've seen before. It's a whole new role and it seems like a
whole new actor. I could hardly believe my eyes.
Joaquin Phoenix, too, is utterly convincing as the villain: his
Commodus is powerful and formidable on the outside but always with an
undertone of weakness and helplessness. As the bad guy, he's easy to
hate but we feel a little sorry for the guy, too. It's obvious that he
got himself in way over his head, he just doesn't know it.
The script, by David Franzoni (Amistad) and John Logan (Bats, believe
it or not) is not completely without flaws. The ending seems too eager
to set up a grandiose showdown between the protagonist and the villain
and is also the only major historical inaccuracy in ways I won't
reveal. It has the intended emotional effect on the audience, but
looking back it's probably the only part of the film which I found
implausible. It works a bit too hard, contrives a little too much to
get a strong reaction.
Gladiator presents us with a man forced to be a superhero. He wants to
avenge his family's wrongful death and in the process kills a lot of
people and becomes famous throughout Rome. Kids idolize him, crowds
worship him and why? Because he can kill. And don't we look for
characters who can kill when we choose which summer blockbuster to see?
Gladiator's biggest achievment is that it doesn't put a guilt trip on
us. It's tremendously entertaining but not hypocritical. You can take
or leave the message. For many, I'm sure, the movie will just be a
rollicking good time. And that's okay.

My rating: A Bulleye. (4 out of 4 stars)
Director: Ridley Scott
Cast: Russell Crowe, Richard Harris, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen,
Oliver Reed, Djimon Hounsou
Writers: David Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson
`People should know when they are conquered', intones a lieutenant to
General Maximus (Crowe), early in the film. It's a statement that serves
as a reflection of the indomitable force of human desire. Gladiator is a
film about man's ability to overcome near insurmountable odds. Homeric
in scale, it is one of those rare films that deserves the title `epic'.
Nestled within a grand tale of treachery, political maneuvering and
personal loss, it none-the-less takes time to savage the modern day
notions of sports and entertainment.
Crowe is General Maximus, pointman for the juggernaut-like Roman
military of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Harris), an expansionist pricked by
nettles of guilt over his place in history. Harris effectively conveys
the weariness of absolute power checked by self doubt as he wonders if
his yearnings to build a strong Rome have smothered his philosophical
leanings. He visits Maximus on the battlefield as his army executes it's
final sweep in a 100 A.D. version of Manifest Destiny. The battle opens
the film. It's filmed in deeply saturated tones of dark yellow and blue,
contrasting the muddy, fog covered terrain against the warm flare of
archers lofting flaming arrows towards their targets. The whole film is
suffused with gorgeous colors, making it a truly beautiful movie.
Director Scott uses a frenzy of jumpcuts as the action blinks from
combatant to combatant. His pace is so frenetic that it becomes
indecipherable who is doing what to whom. It's disconcerting and
detracts from comprehension of the fighting. As the battle is won and
Aurelius praises Maximus for his leadership, Aurelius' son, Commodus
(Phoenix) ,arrives disingenuously asking if he has missed the battle.
The contrast between the leather clad, bleeding Maximus and the
misplaced looking, bejeweled silk and fur garb of Commodus signals the
near palpable difference between the two men.
As the army tends to it's wounds, the ailing Aurelius takes the General
aside for a father-surrogate son chat in which he pleads with Maximus
that he take control of Rome upon his passing. It is the Ceasar's wish
that the power of Rome by given to the senate, and by proxy, the people,
dissolving the dictatorship it has been under. It's a request that tears
at Maximus. A simple farmer at heart, he longs to return to his wife and
son, but can't deny his intrinsic devotion to the Roman empire. Later,
as Aurelius explains his decision of succession to Commodus, events
quickly take a turn into true Greek tragedy as Commodus kills his father
in a opportunistic fit of ambitious rage. The scene plays out better
than would be expected as Commodus shows no glee in the killing and
appears helpless to fight his naked desire. Phoenix plays Commodus  as
progressively unbalanced throughout the film, yet manages to project an
aura of animal cunning. He is a man seriously flawed, yet brutally
dangerous in the wielding of his power upon his father's death.
Revealed around the same time is a former love affair between Aurelius'
daughter, Lucilla (Nielsen)and Maximus. Time and again, much is made of
the unspoken love
between the pair. I found it a bewildering relationship as Lucilla
repeatedly betrays Maximus in the name of self preservation. It seems as
if Lucilla is supposed to come across as a sympathetic character as she
tries to temper Commodus' rage. The implication is that her actions are
driven by her maternal protection of her son, but as her transgressions
against both Commodus and the General escalated, I found myself thinking
her nearly as evil a monster as her brother. When she gives a speech
late in the film praising Maximus, it speaks as much of her hypocrisy as
it does to Maximus' strength of character.
Not to reveal the entirety of the events that unfold, but in quick
succession, Maximus must endure the stripping of his position, the death
of his family and being captured into slavehood, where he is forced to
become a gladiator.
As each gladiator event unfolds, with the stakes being no less than the
lives of the combatants, it cast a none too kind light upon today's
modern day gladiators in professional sports and our national
fascination with personal tragedy. Whether it was Scott's intention or
not, an argument can be made that the gladiator fights are a blistering
indictment on our tabloid crazy, insensitivity to the pain of others as
we look for entertainment, no matter what it's form.
As Gladiator (Maximus) rises through the ranks, he eventually comes into
conflict with his nemesis, Commodus.  Commodus comes to represent the
duplicity and scheming of politicians, while Gladiator speaks to the
force of human desire. As Commodus manipulates events in an attempt to
gain a perceptual advantage over Maximus in the populace's eyes, one
can't help but see an analogy to modern day spinmeisters and today's
national media in relation to the leeming-like whims of the general
public.
Crowe's Gladiator is a model of reluctant heroism. For him, fighting is
a functionality of survival, nothing more. He eschews flashiness unless
it is necessary. This is not a superman. He is a simple man, who is very
good at what he does. By downplaying the invincible hero aspect in favor
of a protagonist who bleeds, cries and suffers loss, the film ups the
meter on Crowe's already infinite watchability. Crowe's oft displayed
intensity adds dimension to what could have been a two dimensional role.
His yearnings and sense of loss take on a certain tangibility due to his
acting skills.
Oliver Reed is an equally strong presence as a gladiator trainer who
almost sells his soul as he panders to the masses thirst for
entertainment. Djimon Hounsou soulfully essays the role of Gladiator's
best friend and confidant.
Gladiator doesn't come across as a dissection of Roman politics, nor
does it particularly pander to the blood thirsty voyeurs lurking in its
audience looking for cheap thrills. It  manages to travel a middle
ground of  viscerally captivating, solid entertainment.

"Are you not entertained?" charismatic Russell Crowe roars
scornfully to the cheering crowd in the Roman Colosseum. Certainly
there hasn't been this kind of awesome sword-and-sandals spectacle
since "Spartacus," "Ben-Hur" and "Cleopatra."  Set in 180 A.D., Crowe
plays Maximus, a Roman general who promises his aging mentor, Caesar
Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) that, as his appointed successor, he
will return power to the Senate, thus restoring the Republic. That
infuriates Caesar's evil, envious son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), who
becomes Emperor and orders Maximus' execution. But Maximus escapes,
becomes a slave and learns from an entrepreneur (Oliver Reed) how
gladiators can fight their way to freedom and vengeance. That's when
the excitement ignites. For years, Hollywood believed that historical
epics were too expensive; now, high-tech computer wizards can
digitally revive that classic genre. Ridley Scott has cleverly
recreated a mythic form in defiantly modern terms under the raw,
realistic influence of "Braveheart" and "Saving Private Ryan," meaning
there's lots of gruesome, bloody carnage, plus surreal, dreamlike
glimpses of Elysium. What's most impressive is the gloriously detailed
world Scott creates on-screen, inhabited by characters whose emotional
motivations come from a contemporary mentality. These are real people
coping with real problems in a brutal, superheroic setting. But there
are weaknesses in David Franzoni's story - like alluding to an
unexplained affair between Maximus and Commodus's sister (Connie
Nielsen) - and the overt, almost comic villainy of Joaquin Phoenix,
whose power-hungry demeanor suggests a demented "Richard III." On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Gladiator" is a savage, sweeping,
spectacular 9. Thumbs up!

Jacobi, Djimon Hounsou, Richard Harris, Spencer Treat Clark 
Written by: David H. Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson 
Directed by: Ridley Scott 
Running Time: 157 minutes 
Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) chooses his trusted
general Maximus (Russell Crowe) as his successor.  However the emperor's
evil son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) murders his father before the
announcement can be made, and Maximus (as well as his family) is
sentenced to be executed.  Maximus is able to escape his executioners,
but is later captured and sold as a slave to Proximo (Oliver Reed). 
Proximo is looking for gladiators to earn himself money (he being a
former gladiator himself), and Maximus reluctantly uses his skills to
prove himself a powerful gladiator.  When emperor Commodus announces
that new games will be held in the Colisseum, Proximo takes his
gladiators there to do battle.  Maximus sees this as his chance to exact
revenge on Commodus. 
Gladiator begins with a great battle sequence between the Roman army and
Germania, and actually is able to maintain interest during the now
required "40 minutes of exposition after a kick ass opening sequence"
style of moviemaking.  The only downfall of the opening sequence is the
editing style used... it's choppy slow-motion which is unsettling and
distracting.  It's similar to the opening sequence in Saving Private
Ryan, but nowhere near as effective. 
The actual gladiator battles are thrilling, but also a bit disjointed. 
Many times it's unclear as to exactly what's going on... all the
audience can tell is that blood is being spilled.  We're not sure who's
blood or by who's hand though.  There's an instance of this earlier in
the film too that's disappointing.  It's comes when Maximus escapes his
executioners.  Some flashes and a few quick cuts later and Maximus is
free... but I still don't know exactly how he did it. 
Russell Crowe should have become a major star after his gleefully over
the top role as a computer generated serial killer in 1995's
Virtuosity.  For whatever reason his stardom never arrived... but he
should have it now.  From here on moviegoers should now be able to say,
"Let's go see the new Russell Crowe movie".  He gets the best scene in
the film (and one of the best moments of all recent movies) when he
reveals his identity to Commodus in the Colisseum.  It's both rousing
and chilling. 
Joaquin Phoenix does a very effective job of making Commodus a person
and not just a cartoon character (which could have easily happened). 
Commodus is conniving, sneaky and whiny, but Phoenix never lets the
character get silly.  It's a very good (and very creepy) performance. 
Oliver Reed died during the filming of Gladiator, and it's a huge loss
to the acting world.  I've always been fascinated with Reed... he's one
of those very talented performers who once had a fine career but ended
up in direct to video junk during his twilight years.  It's ironic that
this film probably would have gotten him back into real movies again, as
he gives a fun and sincere performance.  The film is dedicated to him,
and he will surely be missed. 
Reed's death presented the filmmakers with an obvious problem, as he
still had scenes to be completed.  Rather than recast the role (and end
up reshooting a great deal of footage), a digital version of Oliver Reed
was created at a reported cost of 2 million dollars.  Ironically, that
was probably more money than Reed ever earned for a single film. 
Anyway, this digital effect is only used in one scene that I am aware of
(for about twenty seconds) and if you aren't looking for it you won't
even be able to tell.  
Some of the other digital effects are less convincing however... and
like I always say, noticable digital effects take me out of a movie
immediately.  It's sad that such a good film has these distractions. 
Movies like The Fall of the Roman Empire and Spartacus seemed to do okay
without the use of computer effects. 
Keep in mind that Gladiator is based on real people and real events, but
is entirely a work of fiction.  However it's a work of fiction that's
great entertainment, and another film to add to the list of damn fine
flicks released in 2000 A.D.

   If this review were limited to two words, these words would
reflect the grandiloquent gesture of the 50,000 spectators in
the Roman Colosseum: "Pollice sursum." Thumbs up.  The
expected huge audience for this $100 million movie is likely
to be as excited by its realization as the 50,000 fans at
Rome's Colosseum had been when watching the victorious
combat of the title hero, Maximus, also known simply as
"Gladiator."  While grand spectaculars are commonplace for
the big Hollywood studios, biblical marvels like "The 10
Commandments" and historical epics centering on ancient
Rome have been largely missing from the big screen for the
past thirty-five years--victims of cost and perhaps the feeling
by studio execs that mainstream moviegoers have lost
interest in historical drama.
   But thanks to the marvels of modern technology imposed
on a fictionalized, historical past, Judah Ben-Hur's chariot
in motion looks like a scooter ride at Coney Island when
contrasted with the thunder and hoofbeats of the legionnaires
in Ridley Scott's robust and bloody tale of revenge.  If the
lavish spectacles of the fifties and early sixties brought
audiences to the theaters for what they could not see on their
small TV screens, "Gladiator" will likely pile up box office
numbers as well, especially given its sincere, vigorous, wholly
credible and consistent action with nary a campy moment for
unintentional laughter.  
   While "Gladiator" is not officially a sequel to any previous
effort, the movie takes off where Anthony Mann's 1964 effort
"The Fall of the Roman Empire" leaves off.  Like Ridley
Scott's labor, Mann's picture, starring Sophia Loren and
Stephen Boyd, possesses a solid screenplay, masterful
direction and terrific ensemble acting and is likewise set in
the year 180 A.D. and opening in the Germania forests.  This
time, Roman legions are fighting the last stronghold of the
barbarians, a fully bearded, strange lot of people who are
ultimately trashed by an army under the command of
Maximus (Russell Crowe).  The film opens with photographer
John Mathieson's close-up of the face of the great general, a
man whose pensive, exhausted look serves effectively
enough in place of the lengthy speechifying we'd have
expected from seeing earlier historical screenplays such as 
Joseph L. Mankiewicz's "Cleopatra" and George Stevens's
"The Greatest Story Ever Told"--both products of the sixties
when the genre was at its height.  
   When a Roman messenger carrying a request for
surrender to the German forces returns on horseback to his
own side minus a head, the general's right-hand man quips,
"They say no."  Maximus gives his final pep talk to the troops
before the great battle--a combat scene that could almost be
compared for bloodletting with Steven Spielberg's opening of
"Saving Private Ryan."  "If you find yourself in a green field
with the sun on your face, do not be troubled.  You're in
Elysium and you're already dead," Maximus intones almost
poker-faced to the amusement of the spear-and-sword
carrying men.  Burning the forest that serves as protection for
the men of Germania in much the way the U.S. utilized
napalm to destroy the shielding groves of Vietnam, Maximus
emerges triumphant, impressing the then-reigning emperor
Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) enough to be named
successor to the dying man.  When Aurelius--who is troubled
that only four of his twenty years was time spent in
peace--fails to convey his wishes to the Senate,
Aurelius's son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) declares himself
emperor.  The envious neurotic orders the execution of the
popular general.  
   Escaping the executioner, Maximus is captured, sold as a
slave by Proximo (Oliver Reed), and turned into a gladiator,
where his success in the African ring leads Proximo to take
him to the Roman Colosseum for the big time.  The
remainder of the story alternates political scheming with
Maximus's combat in the ring against a varied assortment of
foes from other slaves to legionnaires with tigers in tow. 
Commodus and his allies deal in their own ways with the big
man's opponents--particularly renegade Senator Gracchus
(Derek Jacobi) who favors a return to a republic, and the
emperor's own two-timing sister, the beautiful Lucilla (Connie
Nielsen), with whom the emperor is in lust.  As we hear the
bantering of these statesmen, we cannot help thinking of
politics in our own times.  Leaders plot to displace one
another legally or otherwise and legislatures demand a
greater say in the decisions of our era as the U.S. Congress
recently did during the impeachment and trial of President
Clinton.
   Filmed principally in Malta, and also in the southern city of
Ouarzazarte, Morocco (standing in for the Roman province of
Zucchabar), "Gladiator" boasts some intriguing travelogue
photography, the most impressive being the mud houses and
500-year-old casbah of the touristic Moroccan city.  Ridley
Scott does not dare to make any of his many battles
redundant, pitting Maximus first against the amateurs in North
Africa, later against legionnaires on chariots with spokes on
their wheels designed to cut opponents in half, then throwing
in a tiger or two (actual, tame cats were used in this
production), and finally a reasonably tense one-on-one
between Maximus and the emperor himself--after Commodus
conveniently delivers a gruesome stab wound to his
opponent's back while the latter stands chained inside the
Colosseum walls.
   Joaquin Phoenix makes for a formidable villain, the
epitome of pure evil that Claudius and Nero themselves
would envy.  This emperor kills his own father,
virtually has incestuous relations with his sister,
and fights with his nemesis only after delivering a
malevolently unsporting blow to his opponent.  He
moreover shows his disdain for the general by describing the
way his men executed Maximus's family, the brood to which
Maximus wishes to return and do farming after the final battle
with Germania.  "They say your son squealed like a hawk
when they nailed him to a cross and that your wife moaned
like a whore as she was ravished again and again and
again," he intones to the beleaguered hero.  For her part,
Connie Nielsen looks bewitching as the unhappy sister of the
emperor, siding with Senator Gracchus and with General
Maximus in their desire to rid the vast empire--housing one-
quarter of the human population and stretching from North
Africa to Britain--of its malicious ruler.  
   Perhaps to no one's great surprise, Russell Crowe is
already being touted for the Best Actor Oscar of the year
2000, an award on which he barely missed out courtesy of a
crackerjack performance by Kevin Spacey in yet another
DreamWorks production, "American Beauty."  Had this actor
in the role of research scientist in Michael Mann's "The
Insider" been afforded the weaponry he uses in this movie,
none of the seven lying CEO's of the tobacco giants would be
alive today.  Crowe shows an uncanny ability to exchange the
bearings of a paunchy, middle-aged high-school teacher in
"The Insider" for the lean, mean, bearded general this time
around.  He's the guy that will bring in the women for a
picture that's hardly a chick flick, while the youthful crowd will
be captivated by chariots crashing and dismantling against
the walls of the Colosseum, heads rolling, torsos bloodied,
and tigers maimed. "Gladiator" is fast and furious, its physical
action tempered with the verbal sounds of Machiavellian
political maneuvers.  This is not a movie that can wait for
video nor should it be ruined months from now by inserting a
tape or DVD into your home entertainment system. Savor
"Gladiator" for the big screen in all of John Mathieson's
wonderful wide-screen action replete with an array of
smashing costumes, defensive armor, and determined
weaponry.
Rated R.  Running time: 154 minutes.  (C) 2000 by

In GLADIATOR, director Ridley Scott (ALIEN and BLADE RUNNER) wants to
give us a SPARTACUS for our time.  With John Mathieson's stunning
cinematography, Hans Zimmer's music reminiscent of a Wagnerian opera,
Art Max's lavish sets and with extensive computer graphics, Scott has
some impressive ingredients with which to work.  Most of all, he has
Russell Crowe (an Oscar nominee for THE INSIDER) in the starring role of
Maximus, a general and a gladiator.  A red-blooded film, it works
magnificently in its fighting sequences as people are sliced and diced
faster than you can count them.  A virile motion picture, it's the
happiest when it's the goriest.
It's great in the ring and on the field of battle, but most of the movie
concerns Roman political intrigue that's as foreign to American
audiences as the machinations of today's ever-changing Italian
governments.  Although it picks up toward the end, most of the movie has
you slumping in your seat as it drags on.   Action pictures should be
measured by how often you are on the edge of your seat, and in GLADIATOR
this almost never happens.  The script's writing committee of David H.
Franzoni (AMISTAD), John Logan (BATS) and William Nicholson (FIRST
KNIGHT) has success with Maximus but significantly underdevelops the
other key roles.
The story concerns a Roman general, Maximus, whose allegiance to a
quickly murdered Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) costs Maximus
his freedom and the lives of his family.  Incorrectly assumed dead,
Maximus reappears in the gladiator minor leagues, far away from Rome.
When he becomes famous, he is drafted by the majors and sent up to meet
his nemesis -- the killer of his family and the new Emperor.
In two bad casting choices, Joaquin Phoenix plays Commodus, the new
Emperor and Marcus Aurelius's son, and Connie Nielsen plays Lucilla,
Commodus's sister.  An especially lame villain, Phoenix doesn't show any
depth.  Similarly Nielsen, last seen in MISSION TO MARS, approaches her
role with lackluster simplicity when an ambiguous duplicity would have
been more interesting.  The two actors sap the energy out of any scene
in which they appear.  And the ones with only them in it are the worst
of all.
The result is that what could and should have been a great film turns
out instead to be merely an adequate one.  Only the film's look and
Crowe's usually wonderful performance causes it to rise above the
ordinary.
GLADIATOR runs way too long at 2:30.  It is rated R for pervasive strong
violence and would be acceptable for older teenagers.

If ever a genre was dead beyond hope, the sword-and-sandal epic was it.
Who on earth would consider making such a film again, and, more to the
point, who could raise the mountain of cash required to make such a
movie? Director Ridley Scott and Dreamworks, that's who. If Gladiator
had been a monumental flop, everyone would have shaken their heads and
commented on the amazing stupidity of the whole idea. "Who wants to see
a gladiator movie? A gladiator movie ferchrissakes!" Well actually,
based on the film's performance at the box office, we do. Forget the
cheesy and homoerotic Steve Reeves movies that inspired the pilot in
Airplane! to ask "Do you like gladiator movies?", this is a full-blooded
action drama for real men. Quiche-eaters should stay away.
The film opens with Maximus (Russell Crowe) about to launch the attack
that will seal victory in the Roman empire's campaign in Germania. The
dying emperor (Richard Harris) intends to end the line of imperial
succession and restore the republic, and he calls on his friend Maximus
to use his army to protect the new government. The emperor's son
Commodus (Joachim Phoenix) has no intention of relinquishing his
birthright, and assumes power as the new emperor. Instead of being the
protector of Rome, Maximus finds himself a slave, competing as a
gladiator and nursing the mother of all grudges against Commodus.
Action heroes of the recent past have tended to be musclebound airheads.
Russell Crowe is a new breed: a believable hero whose pores ooze dignity
and testosterone in equal measure. Crowe's effectiveness on screen is
nothing to do with time spent in the gym - he's built like a pretty
average guy - but has everything to do with being a magnificent actor
who can excel in physical roles. Joachim Phoenix is an effective slimy
scheming villain, but he sometimes delivers lines so flatly it's as if a
take from a read-through made it into the final cut by mistake. Oliver
Reed, who plays Maximus's owner and trainer, died during production and
in one scene a performance had to be coaxed from a pseudo-Ollie
fashioned from a body-double and some fancy CGI work. Reed's public
image was, probably unfairly, that of an appalling drunken buffoon, but
at least his career ended on a high note - he has rarely been better
than he is here. At one point his character tells Maximus, "I'm an
entertainer." He was certainly that, and he could not have chosen a more
appropriate film to be his last.
The scenes of gladiatorial combat are breathtaking. Limbs are hacked,
heads are smashed, torsos are skewered and the air is full of blood.
Comparisons have been made between the combat sequences in Gladiator and
the Normandy landing sequence in Saving Private Ryan, but the approaches
are completely different. Whereas Spielberg used camera and post-
production techniques to give the combat scenes the look of a
documentary and presented the carnage as might a journalist - there it
is, now look at it - Ridley Scott never dwells on the blood and gore,
but instead uses an impressionistic approach to give flashes of brutal
savagery and cutting away immediately. Not only does this solve problems
with scissor-happy censors, it's very effective - in this form of
combat, a new mortal threat is hardly more than 1/24 of a second away,
so there's no time to waste dwelling on the mess you've just made of
another person's body. The smell of fear and sweat and blood leaks from
the screen. The battle sequence that opens the film is equally
impressive. Shot in a gloomy and muddy English forest, the scale and
savagery of the fighting makes for heart-pounding movie-going.
The CGI team worked their magic in creating a completely convincing
interior for the Colosseum. When the gladiators first enter the arena,
they are amazed at the scale and spectacle of what they are seeing. As
they look up and around this vast amphitheatre, the viewpoint tracks
around them and as we see the entire stadium with its thousands of
spectators, we share the gladiators' amazement. The film also benefits
from John Mathieson's photography and the stirring musical score, mainly
by Hans Zimmer, which borrows from varied sources, notably the Mars
segment of Holst's suite The Planets. 
The script (by David Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson) sticks
to genre conventions and gives the characters plenty of overwritten
stagey dialogue in which to plot their various intrigues and revenges.
Maybe that's the way it has to be in this sort of movie. If centurions
and emperors talked like real people, the whole thing might,
paradoxically, become less believable. I don't know if any general would
really say "at my command, unleash hell" - but it's great stuff. And as
is usual with such traditional epics, there is plenty of chat between
the memorable set pieces, but the film hardly ever drags - we are really
made to care about Maximus, through his fall and rise and eventual...
well I'll only say that the script provides a satisfying but poignant
resolution, only slightly spoiled by the implausibility of the final
showdown. 
Although the script could have been written during Hollywood's last
fling with this genre nearly forty years ago, Gladiator is still a
technically astonishing entertainment of the most spectacular kind and
demands to be seen on the biggest screen you can get to.

Back in the days of the Roman Empire, Italian soldiers spent a lot of time
conquering Europe. But as one particular Caesar ages, he ponders his
purpose. "Maximus, why are we here?" (in Germania), he whines. "For the
Glory of Rome," Maximus (Crowe) responds. Reflecting on the bloodshed,
Caesar sighs, "So much for the glory of Rome." This seemingly-innocent
mumble has a wonderfully-biting double edge.
Tired of war, Caesar plans to raise his trusted and son-like warrior,
Maximus, to guardian of a restored republican Rome. Yet, in all his great
wisdom Caesar prematurely reveals the plan to his real son, Commodus.
(There'll be no Rome left for him.) Before Maximus is ordained, Commodus
kills his father and thus becomes a tyrant king. He orders the deaths of
Maximus and family, then sits back in the throne. Maximus narrowly escapes,
but is captured (as a slave) by a circus leader who runs a traveling
gladiator show. Coincidentally, Commodus decides to reinstate the game in
Rome, thus the mighty Maximus arrives back in the capital harboring a
festering vendetta.
It's a great story, celebrated warrior turned slave, turned gladiator,
turned revolutionist. And Crowe is steadfast. But here are the problems: His
son and daughter look like models in an aspirin commercial. They have no
lines. They're displayed either as Utopian or crispy dead - never real. So
we feel nothing for them and when they're slain, we don't care. Better to
leave them unshown. Crowe is a great actor, let his love for them be enough
to make us care. This is a long film, cut out their segments entirely.
Conveying them only as ideas, the film would be stronger. I have great faith
in Crowe's ability to make us long for that family with him. Unspecified, we
can fill in the blanks with our own warm feelings of home.
The two other problems involve the beginning and the ending. I just don't
believe that a great wise leader would have so immaturely handled such a
delicate situation as depriving the thrown from his immoral son. Caesar
would have ordered his son Commodus off on some important mission in some
distant land or other, while Maximus was ordained. Either that, or (dare you
scheme with me) Caesar may have wanted the son to murder him, thus inspiring
Maximus all the more - but if the writers intended this twist they certainly
did not clearly lay it out. Such a strategy would have improved the film and
my ability to "buy in" earlier on.
But weather you "buy in" or not, it's still a fun story. Powerful underdog,
rising from the slime and under-appreciated to challenge the all mighty
czar. And there's all that blood and guts in the arena.
The very first fight (meant to establish Crowe as a fighting man's general
of war) begins with nightsky-scraping flaming arrows that dash across in the
twilight emitting a magically-lethal orange glow. I thought to myself, "This
is one medieval battlefield rumble to end all cinema recreations." As the
conflict rages, the camera angles become increasingly narrowed and the
screen full of flames and blurred soldiers in slow mo. But the effect
becomes over-digitized in a strobe reminiscent of a consumer camera,
subtracting from the realism and gravity of the fight. And instead of
continuing the ever-tightening angle to personalize the savagery, a few
mid-wide shots are tossed in. It breaks up the direction of the sequence and
wakes the viewer from its hypnotic effect. Still a strong sequence overall,
but "The Messenger" did a better job.
Lastly, this is an action film and not-disappointingly it ends with action.
Unfortunately, a few additional lines of dialogue are tacked on, again
diluting the power of the event. Nothing needed to be said!
"Gladiator" does best what it proposes - it be's big! Though I expected more
from this two hour fifty minute epic, I still enjoyed it, while most others
I spoke with loved it.

"Gladiator" is the bloodiest, nauseating, dullest and most old-fashioned
gladiator flick in ages - a big thud in director Ridley Scott's career. It is
beautifully shot and appropriately murky but also hopelessly, terminally
monotonous.
The indefatigable Russell Crowe stars as the stoic Spanish-born Maximus,
general of a Roman army, who in the film's brutal opening sequence, lavishes an
attack against multitudes of barbarians - his command is "Unleash hell." That
phrase sums up the film in a nutshell. 
Later, Maximus is praised by Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris - looking
more haggard and drunk than ever) for vanquishing the enemy. The dying Emperor
also wants Maximus to succeed him, which causes dissent from the Emperor's
devious son, Commodus (Joaquim Phoenix). It is no surprise that Commodus, a
weakling who has never seen the gruesome reality of war, kills his father and
almost has Maximus killed and guess who becomes the new Emperor? 
After Maximus escapes, he is sold as a slave and prepared for death as a
gladiator by Proximo (Oliver Reed), a supplier and instructor of gladiators who
has seen all kinds of savagery in his heyday. Maximus survives several battles
to the death, enough to go to the paramount level - the Colosseum where
Commodus is often seen in attendance. Dispensing one of the few clever notions
in the screenplay, the Colosseum recreates famous battles yet Maximus ends up
beating the odds, to the enormous applause from the audiences who love this
kind of spectacle. 
"Gladiator" is at heart a revenge story since Maximus wants to kill Commodus
for having killed his family and all his friends. But Maximus embodies lots of
grunts and excessive moroseness - none of this merits much in the way of
empathy or sympathy. His Maximus is a study in complete stoicism from beginning
to end but there is not much beyond that - Crowe, an excellent actor, offers no
hints of humanity, only vigor. I may be bold for saying this but even
Schwarzeneger's Conan had a sense of humor in between his vicious
sword-wielding moments.
The action scenes are another problem. In this age of super MTV-split-second
edits, the battle scenes in the Colosseum and in the opening sequence are cut
so frantically and with such headache-inducing movement that it is difficult to
tell what is happening on screen. I suppose director Ridley Scott considers
this an experimental approach post-"Saving Private Ryan" but at least in
"Ryan," you had some clue as to what was occuring from one shot to the next
(both films are from the company Dreamworks). The similarly old-fashioned,
silly "Spartacus" was also cohesively shot and edited so that you never lost
sight of who was killing whom. Here it is all a jumbled collage of rapid
movements causing headaches more than excitement. 
"Gladiator" has some decent performances, the best of which is the intense
presence of the late Oliver Reed, but the film meanders at such a languid pace
that it is often to difficult to stay awake while watching it. Its joyless,
somber tone and thin characters makes it a chore to sit through. This may be
the first summer blockbuster for the year 2000 but the outlook is not too
promising.

 Gladiator (2000) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Russell Crowe, Joaquin
Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Richard Harris, Oliver Reed and Djimon Hounsou.
Screenplay by David Franzoni and John Logan and William Nicholson. Story
by Franzoni. Directed by Ridley Scott
 Grip your theater seats and prepare to be entertained.
 From its opening battle to its visually poetic finale, "Gladiator" is a
non-stop action piece, a thinking man's epic in the vein of "Spartacus"
and "Ben Hur."
 Starring Russell Crowe, Gladiator combines excitement and thrills with
a solid script and a larger-than-life hero.
 Crowe plays Maximus, a legendary Roman general, loyal to his emperor,
Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), and his ideals.
 Through the machinations of the jealous Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the
emperor's ambitious, immoral son, Maximus is marked for assassination
after Marcus Aurelius' sudden demise.
 Escaping an ambush, he rushes to his far-away home to find his wife and
 Captured and sold into slavery in North Africa, Maximus is trained as a
gladiator. He soon begins winning fame in the bloody arena and is taken
to Rome to do battle in the Colosseum.
 Once in Rome, Maximus sets out to win over the populace as well as
avenge himself on the new emperor - Commodus.
I
 n print, this all may sound a bit silly or even childish. Or worse,
like one of those cheesy Italian `epics' from the late '50s or early
'60s starring people such as Steve Reeves or Gordon Scott.
 Take my word for it, "Gladiator" towers over those movies like Mount
Everest over the Himalayas.
 If it's blood and swordplay you crave, than "Gladiator " is your fix.
 But be warned: This is a brutal movie. Limbs are hacked, heads fly and
bodies are split. Yet director Ridley Scott's camera is too busy to take
a breath and linger on the corpses. We are thrown into the midst of
combat; the clanging of swords, the whoosh of arrows, the thump of
spears hitting flesh, the cries of dying and wounded men surround you.
 Yet behind all this spectacle and special effects is a story of honor
and of one man's quest for justice.
 Maximus may be a heroic general, but underneath he is a simple soldier
longing for his home and family. He craves no honors except to be
allowed to rejoin his wife and son.
 Fate treats him cruelly, thrusting him into a world where he must
survive not only on the strength of his sword arm, but with the cunning
of his brain.
 Crowe is magnificent as Maximus. Though he goes through "Gladiator"
killing dozens of men, you continue to cheer for him. You hold him in
awe and respect him, despite the brutality he must adopt to endure.
 Crowe is an actor whose silence speaks volumes. He uses his
expressions, especially his eyes, to convey a wide range of emotions.
The Australian actor is a chameleon. You will not see any of "The
Insider's" Jeffrey Wigand, nor "L.A. Confidential's" Bud White in this
Crowe.
 Here he is solid, square-jawed, standing like a Roman god. With a quiet
dignity, he commands the screen and your attention.
 Phoenix is an effete psychopath, reminiscent of John Hurt's Caligula in
the BBC series "I, Claudius," but not as hammy or mad as Jay Robinson in
"The Robe" or "Demetrius and the Gladiators." No, Phoenix's Commodus is
an immoral, ambitious, spoiled little boy.
 One aspect of Commodus that is almost a cliché is his incestuous lust
for his sister, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen). Why is it that every film that
features a villainous Roman emperor must insist that the character -
besides his other flaws - have the hots for his sister. Is not throwing
people to the lions or assassinating rivals proof enough?
 One sentimental note about "Gladiator." The movie marks the final
performance of Oliver Reed, and it is a memorable supporting role.
 Reed is Proximo, who runs the gladiator school. Unlike the bombastic,
over-the-top characters Reed played in his later films, his Proximo is
an honorable scoundrel, and Reed plays him accordingly. It is good to
see that this fine actor went out as a winner.
 "Gladiator" will keep you riveted to your seats. The time flies, even
though the film clocks in at about 2 hours and 40 minutes. "Gladiator"
is a continuous visual treat from beginning to end. It opens the summer
movie season with a bang.

"Gladiator"
Reviewed by Christian Pyle
Directed by Ridley Scott  
Written by David H. Franzoni, John Logan, and William Nicholson
Starring Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, and Oliver Reed
Grade: B
More than forty years ago, the "sword and sandals" genre of historical epic
ruled the box office.  During the 1950's Hollywood sought to give audiences a
reason to turn off their televisions and go out to the movies by offering the
grand spectacle of the Roman Empire in Cinemascope.  "Ben-Hur."  "Cleopatra." 
"The Robe."  "Sparticus."  "The Fall of the Roman Empire."  "Quo Vadis." 
Sometimes brilliant, sometimes campy, the Roman epic was the Technicolor
funeral pyre of classic Hollywood.  Since then, epics have appeared
infrequently ("The Last Emperor," "Braveheart") and some of the best have been
small-screen affairs produced in the 1970's ("Roots," "Shogun").  Yet, the
phrase "We who are about to die salute you" has been absent until now.
"Gladiator" begins in Germania in A. D. 180.  Roman General Maximus (Russell
Crowe) has conquered yet another group of barbarians for his emperor Marcus
Aurelius (Richard Harris), and he is eager to retire to his plantation in Spain
where his wife and son are waiting.  However, the emperor is worried that his
decadent weakling son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) will prove a poor successor,
so he wants to make Maximus his heir as a transition toward Rome becoming a
republic again.  When Commodus hears the plan, he strangles his father and
orders Maximus and his family murdered.  Maximus escapes from the executioners,
but he arrives home too late to save his wife and son.  A caravan of slavers
pick up the wounded hero and carry him off to North Africa.  (Why the caravan
happened to be cruising by Maximus' place is never explained.)  An African
named Juba (Djimon Hounsou) treats Maximus' wounds.  Proximo (Oliver Reed), a
gladiator who won his freedom, purchases Maximus and Juba as fodder for the
arena.  Of course, Maximus proves as able a gladiator as he was a soldier, and
his fame spreads.  When Commodus reopens the Coliseum, Proximo brings his
troupe of warriors to Rome to compete.  Our hero wins the hearts and minds of
the cheering crowds and finds that he has an ally in Commodus' sister Lucilla
(Connie Nielsen).
The similarities to "Braveheart" are obvious:  an evil king, a determined
warrior seeking revenge for his murdered family, the aid of a lovestruck
princess.  Also, like Mel Gibson's epic, "Gladiator" has a primarily visceral
appeal and is driven forward by the hero's anger.  It's a simple tale of good
versus evil.  Maximus has all the manly virtues:  nobility of purpose, courage
in battle, loyalty to king and country, physical stamina, and devotion to
family.  Commodus is his opposite in every way:  a sniveling, selfish coward
who is intended to disgust the audience.
The opening night crowd in my theater was about 70% male, and that seems
appropriate.  "Gladiator" is a guy movie (would the opposite of a "chick flick"
be a "dick flick"?).  There's much pumping of testosterone and chopping off of
body parts in gruesome battle sequences.  (Those easily offended by gore should
stay away.)  Lucilla is the only female character, and what sparks there are
between her and Maximus are dampened by his devotion to his dead wife.
Joaquin Phoenix gives an astounding performance.  In the scene where Commodus
kills his father, Phoenix shows the pain of a son who has never had his
father's love or pride.  Throughout the picture, Phoenix manages to give depth
to a character who's scripted as a caricature of evil.  I've been a Russell
Crowe fan since "Romper Stomper."  This role doesn't offer him the complexities
of his parts in "L. A. Confidential" and "The Insider" -- essentially his job
is to grunt heroically -- but his voice, which has a Richard Burton resonance
textured by a Clint Eastwood rasp, is perfect for the genre.  The late Oliver
Reed gave us the best work of his career in his last role.  I hope it will be
rewarded with an Oscar.
My only major quibble with "Gladiator" is its stylized look.  Several scenes
are tinted.  We've seen a lot of the tinted look lately, particularly in
"Payback" and "The Matrix."  I don't get the appeal of the style, which makes
feature films look like TV ads.  In "Payback" it was merely annoying, but in
"Gladiator" it bleaches the color out of the grand spectacles that are the
raison d'etre of the Roman epic.  (Perhaps it's meant to gloss over the
imperfections of the computer-generated shots.)  Also, the battle scenes are
filmed in a strange herky jerky style that seems to be slo mo and fast forward
simultaneously.  (It reminds me of the way the Flash runs in the comic books,
leaving a half-blurred trail of images of himself behind.)  With a more
realistic look, "Gladiator" could be even more satisfying than "Braveheart"
because it has a tighter script and a more fulfilling conclusion.
Bottom line:  A rousing action film enriched by fine performances but tarnished
by stylistic choices.

`Gladiator' is a story that roars one simple message. 
And that message is `Charge!'  This film steadily
rushes towards you like centurions on a chariot.  Fun
summer movies are about being visceral delights.  And
this one delivers.  Heroic in tone, epic in scope, and
far from bloodless, the summer's first
blockbuster-to-be is a grand tale of Rome,
retribution, and requital.  
The film opens with an ambitious battle sequence.  `At
my command, unleash Hell,' says the film's hero,
General Maximus (stately Russell Crowe).  Maximus
leads his legion of troops into battle, masterminding
an important victory for the glory of Rome.  His
continued leadership has brought him the admiration
and love of the current but aging Emperor, Marcus
Aurelius (regal Richard Harris).  A benevolent leader
with noble visions of Rome's future, his final hope is
for Maximus to succeed him when he dies.
This decision infuriates Aurelius's tempestuous son,
Commodus (darkly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix). 
Consumed with jealousy, he attempts to destroy Maximus
and his family before ascending the throne himself. 
The crafty General manages to escape, but his family
is not as lucky.  
Stripped of everything he loves, he is captured by
slave traders and then subsequently sold to Proximo
(Oliver Reed), a businessman who specializes in
training Gladiators. In the training arena, Maximus
filets his opponents as easily as Japanese chefs filet
fish.  But he is also taught that he must win over the
crowd if he is to truly win the match.  
As a victorious and popular gladiator, he will travel
to Rome to perform in the Colosseum.  As a man with a
noble heart, his personal crusade is followed with
much interest.  As such, he garners support from
fellow gladiators (including Djimon Honsou), a former
love/Commodus's sister (Connie Nielsen), and a
civic-minded Senator (Derek Jacobi).   He looks for a
chance to avenge the death of his family, restore his
honor and posthumously bring forth the vision of
Emperor Aurelius.  
To enjoy `Gladiator' fully, find a big screen with a
good sound system.  There is an array of impressive
combat sequences with equally imposing sound effects. 
When you hear a battle axe being thrown, you might
want to look over your right shoulder just in case. 
Cinematography is also beautiful.  From its renderings
of ancient Rome to the way hues are incorporated into
scenes (for example, gray hues magnify the bleakness
of battle while rich amber hues reflect the lushness
enjoyed by the nobility), careful attention is taken
to immerse the audience in the movie-going experience.
 And the 165-minute saga of Maximus is stately and
absorbing.  Crowe is a gladiator's gladiator and he
brings depth and feeling to a new breed of action
heroes.
Yet, I have two reservations (no spoilers given).  The
first was that Commodus was seemingly baleful, but his
actions took a backseat to his psychotic personality. 
He was all talk but a man of little action.  When the
final showdown occurs, the audience doesn't view him
as much of a threat.  A greater reservation, however,
was the pace of the final act.  So much momentum was
building towards the finale that its ultimate
resolution seemed like an apology from the director
because they couldn't secure enough financing to
finish it with the same kind of epic battle that
catapulted its beginning. 
But these are just minor points in an otherwise grand
story.  `Gladiator' is spectacular summer fare.  Its
tale is engaging, its presentation is bold, and it
certainly sets the bar for summer movies at a high
level.

   GLADIATOR is one empty spectacle. But damn, what a spectacle it is. The film
is Ridley Scott's attempt at a post millennial sword and sandals epic akin to
SPARTUCUS or BEN HUR though the final product bears a closer resemblance to
CONAN THE BARBARIAN plus some added pretension. With GLADIATOR it's obvious
that Scott really wanted to make an important film rather than an exploitive
action yarn like CONAN, though his expository scenes are dull and lacking in
the charge of his spastic action sequences. Still, even those sequences really
don't work on quite the level they're supposed to.
   The opening battle (easily the worst action scene in the film) is a
hodgepodge of pompous Hans Zimmer patriotic marching crap that sounds like a
Puff Daddy remix of the composer's scores from CRIMSON TIDE, BROKEN ARROW and
THE ROCK, sped up film stock, and quick cuts of graphic carnage all building up
to a long slo-mo digression complete with much gratuitous howling. It must also
be mentioned that the scene is so murkily downcast for no reason other than
Scott's seemingly fetishistic attraction to grungy palettes. (Remember it was
Ridley Scott who filmed his GI JANE training sequences like lessons in
stylistic masturbation complete with, yes, Hans Zimmer, rain, lightning, mud,
saliva, sweat, everything but semen). This makes the screen appear as if Scott
and his crew smeared shit over the camera lens in order to create some sort of
epic sword and sandals-noir!?!??? It wants to be all moody and fill us with
ominous dread, but all it did was make me want to hose the screen down with a
vat of Windex.
   Thus begins our supposed epic: Maximus (Russell Crowe in what would have
been the Jean-Claude Van Damme role had this film been made a mere seven years
ago) is picked (for very hackneyed political reasons) by the emperor of Rome
(Richard Harris, seething with Shakespearean glee) to be his replacement, but
the emperor's son Commudus (Joaquin Phoenix) will have none of that. He's a
greedy, whiny brat who wants to rule so badly that he kills his own father,
takes his throne, then orders his guards to lead Maximus out into the woods and
have him killed. The plan goes awry for Commodus when the mighty Maximus (I
smell a HERCULES spin-off waiting in the wings) escapes in a rousing and
appropriately brutal getaway. He races on foot back to his picturesque commode
hoping to be greeted by his family, only when he arrives they've already been
killed by Commudus' minions. Our hero passes out and is eventually picked up by
slave traders--the kind of slave traders who roam the countryside searching for
unconscious victims of those corrupt Romans. You know the kind. He's sold to
Proximo (Oliver Reed, sharper than ever in his final performance), a former
gladiator and current trainer. After Maximus endures some qualifying bouts
under the reluctant guidance of Proximo, he makes his way up to the
much-dreaded Coliseum.
   Everything seems to be in place for one helluva an epic, the sort of epic
that will be cherished forever amongst many generations 
to come. And don't get me wrong, for many this will be just that. Allow me to
elaborate: before dolling out a review I customarily scan those of other film
critics, in a search of opinions that clash with my own. I looked far and wide
for a negative review of GLADIATOR and all I could find was Roger Ebert's pithy
write up. Judging from a quick scan of that review (I make it a habit never to
read an entire review before writing one of my own because I'm so darn serious
about my craftâŚpathetic, no?) I noticed that the portly critic seemed to be
all up in arms about historical inaccuracies, none of which (to show how awful
I was in History) I even noticed. Others are calling it the best film of the
year, a sure Oscar contender, and audiences definitely like it as well; the
crowd I saw it with reacted just as positively to the film as the crowd I saw
STAR WARS: THE PHANTOM MENACE with reacted negatively. However a promising
story, good performances, and decent art direction does not a classic make.
   My biggest caveat with the flick is how hollow its script is. No emotion
feels true; it's as if the screenwriters poured over BRAVEHEART in an attempt
to transport that story to the time of the Coliseum. And with no help from
Ridley Scott who seems to think that he can compensate for that lack of depth
by giving us lengthy expository scenes and making his characters overly gloomy
(I think Russell Crowe smiles maybe once throughout the entire film).
   Those expository scenes are akin to (sorry to bring up Lucas's steaming pile
of celluloid waste, but I must for I am far too lazy to think of a better
example) the political trial scenes in STAR WARS: THE PHANTOM MENACE, which
virtually everyone will agree were dramatically inert, passionless, and, well,
boring. GLADITOR's expository scenes are just as tedious, and while the
dialogue is mostly decent and the performances are above par, there's nothing
behind it all, no subtext, no character. Instead of becoming involved in the
picture I found myself stealing glances at this very attractive blonde woman
sitting below me to my right. She seemed so into the film. I wish I could have
been that involved.
   When I wasn't gazing at the blonde I was hoping for more of Scott's
stylistic excesses, which probably would have annoyed the piss out of me in any
really good movie, now, at least they kept me attentive. Those action sequences
try to enthrall us the way SAVING PRIVATE RYAN did, and Scott employs a similar
technique, choosing to film his action up close rather than from afar. But RYAN
grabbed you by following its characters through the nightmarish obstacles of
war in a documentary like fashion that made the audience feel as if they were a
part of the horrific undertaking. Scott, instead, opts to film his battles as a
series of jerky movements and quick cuts. While RYAN drew you into the action,
GLADIATOR continually flinches away from it.
   Much has been said about how Scott is filming this old-fashioned epic with
all the modern technology at his hands. Sure the film is always nice to look at
(though not nearly as nice as that blondeâŚ) but we are always aware that the
Rome we see is an effect (while I'm positive the blonde was real). Nobody in
the audience will mistake the Coliseum for the Coliseum. The structure we see
looks about as authentic as textbook art placed up on the big screen. Which
isn't to say that it looks bad, it just doesn't look authentic.
   Where Scott really goes wrong is not in the design but in the conception. He
seems to believe that all he needs to make a great movie is the ingredients of
one; scorned hero, duplicitous bad guy, parables of today, ad nausemum. What he
neglects to include is the passion that is essential to become involved on a
deeper level. Some may think the film is deep because everything is in place
for it to be. But look closer as the tag line for AMERICAN BEAUTY screams. And
if you do all that you will see is an abundance of Scott's fabricated rage.

The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Corrupt politicians.  High-profile athletes.  Bloodthirsty fans.  No, 
it's not business as usual in modern-day America...  
It's 180 A.D; Maximus (Russell Crowe), fearless and beloved General in 
the Roman Empire, has had a hard two years and 234 days and one morning, 
and just wants to go home to his wife and son.  But Emperor Marcus 
Aurelius (Richard Harris) has something else in mind for the General: 
declaring Maximus "the son I wish I'd had", Marcus wants Maximus to 
insure that Rome returns to public rule by taking interim control of the 
Empire until the Roman Senate can get it together enough to take over.  
This does not sit well with Marcus' actual son (and next-in-line for the 
Emperorship), the pampered Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix); feeling cheated 
out of his rightful place in life, he conspires against Marcus and 
Maximus, as well as his sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) and her son 
Lucius (Spencer Treat Clark), and Senator Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to 
become the next Emperor of Rome.  Commodus [am I The Only One who can't 
help thinking of a toilet bowl when seeing that name in print?] does Bad 
Things that eventually lead to Maximus being made a gladiator-slave in 
the servitude of Proximo (Oliver Reed), who teaches Maximus and fellow 
gladiator-slave Juba (Djimon Hounsou) the rule-of-thumb of becoming a 
successful--that is, living--gladiator: "win the people, and you'll win 
your freedom".
The Upshot:
Hmmm...that shorthand synopsis sounds a bit soap-operaish, and in fact, 
elements of the story do bring in mind something along the lines of All 
My Decadent First-Century Children.  And a soap isn't the only thing the 
storyline of GLADIATOR brings to mind; the movie reminded me of any 
number of things, from NFL players in a stadium, to the American 
Congress, to other movies (like, of all things, Kevin Costner's version 
of "Robin Hood", and of course, classics like BEN HUR and SPARTACUS).  
But mostly, GLADIATOR reminded me just how brilliant and chameleon-like 
Russell Crowe is as an actor.
It's breathtaking to watch Crowe so easily losing himself in his roles, 
while totally drawing the viewer in and keeping them believing; just as 
Crowe *was* the downtrodden, overweight, middle-aged protagonist in THE 
INSIDER, he is equally convincing here as Maximus--about as far from 
Jeffrey Wigand as he could be.  Yet, both characters have something in 
common: their sense of family and the need to make things right.  And 
whether it's from under a business suit or a suit of armor, Crowe 
portrays those strong character traits skillfully.
That said, the movie suffers most whenever Crowe is not involved in a 
scene.  To be sure, most of the supporting cast is capable, if not 
strong--Richard Harris in his brief turn as the Emperor, Oliver Reed in 
a meatier role as Proximus, and Derek Jacobi's Gracchus, being standouts 
among them--but the movie seems to crawl along most noticeably in 
Crowe's absence, and when the action stops.  That, and the difficult 
time I had believing that Commodus would last a day as Emperor [could he 
be more whiny?] or that Lucilla would suddenly become powerless and 
demure in the presence of her rather limp brother, threatened to wreak 
havoc with my suspension of disbelief...until Crowe showed up on the 
screen again, and everything was Made Right once more.
And speaking of "action", director Ridley Scott pulled out all the stops 
to bring it to the audience, in full, bloody gore.  The special effects 
are seamless and spectacular; never getting in the way of the story, it 
wasn't until the closing credits rolled that I remembered that so many 
of the background images were computer-generated.  Effects alone doesn't 
pay the bills, though; and the interplay between Crowe and Nielsen, and 
Crowe and Phoenix, and Crowe and [insert castmember's name here] show 
the earmarks of good directing on Scott's part.
The parallels in GLADIATOR with American politics were humorous--a 
leader would give power back to The People by empowering The Senate?  
bwah!--but those parallels also made it all the more easy to follow the 
plotline.  And before the viewer has a chance to get comfortable with 
the humor, Scott and Crowe come back with a testosterone rush and get 
the adrenaline pumping again.
Now *that's* how you kick-start a Summer movie season!  
Bammer's Bottom Line: 
Spectacular images, remarkable action, powerful scene-chewing by Russell 
Crowe in the lead - on top of a hit-and-miss story presented whenever he 
wasn't on-screen.  Oh well; three outta four ain't bad...
GLADIATOR (rating: greenlight): 
It ain't Spartacus, but it's most def good enough for a repeat 
performance, if only to see Crowe sizzle again.

Until now, Hollywood hadn't made an Ancient Roman epic in my lifetime.
And they may as well not attempt another, because I can't see them
creating a better one than Gladiator.  Director Ridley Scott's (G.I.
Jane) unique visual stamp  from the colorless studio logos for
Dreamworks and Universal at the beginning, to the startling, dream-like
ending  has crafted a real winner, firmly establishing Gladiator as
2000's first genuine blockbuster.
Gladiator takes place at the tail end of the second century, where the
Roman Empire controls much of existence.  With one more campaign
remaining to bring peace to this vast empire, General Maximus (Russell
Crowe, The Insider) leads his troops into battle in the woods of
Germania against a group of barbarians in the winter of 180 A.D.  Before
giving the signal to begin the skirmish, Maximus bends down to scoop up
a handful of dirt, which he rubs into his hands and smells, before
uttering the wonderful line, `At my signal, unleash Hell.'  And
thankfully the way he says it isn't totally over the top, like a
Stallone or a Schwarzenegger.  The battle scene is as well done as
Braveheart, but darker, muddier, foggier, and probably more akin to The
13th Warrior.
After annihilating the barbarians, Maximus is summoned by the current
Emperor, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris, Smilla's Sense of Snow), who
is dying and expresses his desire for the well-respected General to take
over his throne.  Despite wanting only to return to his farm, wife and
young son, Maximus reluctantly agrees.  The news of the Emperor's
appointment doesn't sit well with Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix, 8mm), who
is Marcus Aurelius' only son.
Without divulging too many surprises, I'll just say that a bunch of
stuff happens.  Now Marcus Aurelius is dead, Commodus rules the Empire,
and Maximus is a slave purchased by a former gladiator named Proximo
(the late Oliver Reed, who died before filming ended), along with Juba
(Djimon Hounsou, Amistad) and Hagen (former Mr. Universe Ralph
Moeller).  Proximo plans to enter his new slaves in fight-to-the-death
battles that will entertain the masses.
Maximus isn't the biggest soldier or the strongest soldier, but like
Braveheart's William Wallace, Maximus is the perfect combination of
heart and head, with an ample dose of hell-bent revenge tossed in for
good measure.  Together with Juba and Hagen, he plows through local
competition, smelling dirt and fighting his way to the top like Rocky,
eventually earning the right to battle before 50,000 in Rome.  This, of
course, give Maximus the perfect opportunity to get close to Commodus
and, potentially, to settle the score.
Crowe is fantastic as Maximus and, for the twenty-nine people that
actually saw his Oscar-nominated turn in The Insider, you won't see even
a trace of Jeffrey Wigand here.  The biggest surprise is Phoenix, who
turns in a respectably strong performance as the picture-perfect,
sneering antagonist.  Gladiator was filmed in Morocco and Malta, and was
written by John Logan (Any Given Sunday), William Nicholson (Nell) and
co-producer David H. Franzoni (Amistad).  The film was brilliantly
photographed by John Mathieson (Plunkett & Macleane, which was directed
by Scott's son Jake) and edited by Oscar-winner Pietro Scalia (JFK). The
unobtrusive score is from another Oscar-winner - Hans Zimmer (The Lion
King), and the marvelous sets and costumes, which reminded me a lot of
the World War II look in Titus, were designed by Arthur Max (Se7en) and
Janty Yates (Plunkett & Macleane), respectively.
2:34  R for graphic battle violence and mild adult situations

Another Hollywood wannabe epic film made mostly for the sake of wooing Oscar 
voters with its classic
story of eternal love and quest for vengeance. 
It's a guy movie and a chick flick at the same time. It has many exciting and 
bloody battle scenes which
service the plot about a Roman war general named Maximus (Russell Crowe) who 
was about to become
the next leader of the great empire until heir-apparent Commodus (Joaquin 
Phoenix) has him removed.
Commodus becomes an arrogant, selfish emperor who uses his power to service 
his own desires instead of
doing what's good for Rome. 
At 150 minutes the film is a bit overlong but at least its story is full of 
detail so pay close attention. The basic
plot is familiar and very Shakespearean, but the gladiator life Maximus finds 
himself trapped in is the most
interesting aspect of the film. Not as good as "Spartacus" or "Braveheart" 
but it's a fine effort.
