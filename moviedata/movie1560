     Here's to you Mrs. Robinson... One of everybody's "Friends,"
David Schwimmer, stars in this dull retread of THE GRADUATE. He's
definitely no Dustin Hoffman, and he can't carry a movie either. The
supporting cast -- Gwenyth Paltrow, Barbara Hershey and the
always-underused Michael Rapaport -- do their best, but a ship with
Schwimmer as skipper will always sink whether the cargo is talented or
not. Add in some bad writing and direction that can't tell if it wants to
be bold or conventional and you're ready to bury THE PALLBEARER six feet
under. 
     Now that I've thoroughly trashed the movie, I'll recount the main
plot to you -- a young man has an affair first with a much-older woman,
then realizes it's a younger woman he wants to spend time with. The main
difference is that Paltrow isn't Hershey's daughter, not to mention that
Hershey is actually looking good, unlike Anne Bancroft in THE GRADUATE
(sorry, Mel). I know Hershey's had plastic surgery out the wazoo, but if
any twentyish guy was asked to "console" her in the manner she
suggests, I don't imagine he'd offer too many objections. 
     But even if it isn't a direct plot-lift from the 1967 Hoffman
classic, they steal enough from another film to be guilty of
double-plagiarism. Here's how the movie begins -- a group of old friends
get together over the death of a friend and then proceed to bond over a
period of several days. It's the Generation X version of THE BIG CHILL 
and again, there's only difference. This time, the dead guy isn't Kevin
Costner but some guy none of the friends can seem to remember. But
Hershey, the greiving mother, tells Schwimmer that as the best friend of
the departed, he should be the one to read the eulogy. 
     Can you see the situation comedy ramifications of such a thing?
Poor Ross doesn't even remember this guy and he has to deliver a
eulogy about him. He looks in his old yearbook and all he can find on the
dead guy is that he was in the chess club. So he's pretty much screwed,
and without any help from Monica, Chandler, Rachel, Joey and Phoebe.
I have to mention the other five "Friends" because Schwimmer is
completely annoying without any of them to counteract his whining. That
show has gone downhill too but looks like classic comedy next to this
dead comedy.

The phone rings. You pick it up. There's someone crying on the other
end. Someone has died. Who is this person?  It's the dead man's mother.
She wants you to make a eulogy at his funeral. The truth of the matter
is that you can't remember him.
At this point I would have replied: Â‘Ma'am, it's a real honour to be
asked to say some loving words in memory of your son, but I would think
it inappropriate because I don't remember him.'
Being truthful, yet remaining sensitive, would have been the most
tactful approach to this situation. But being alone (Schwimmer).
Twenty-five years of age. Unemployed, and still living with mother, can
do strange things to a man. Namely, agreeing to make a eulogy for
someone that you don't remember from chess club at high school, then
sleeping with the dead man's mother.

     David Schwimmer (from the television series "Friends") stars as a
sensitive (and slightly neurotic) single guy who gets more than he
expected from the grieving mother (Barbara Hershey) of a classmate he
can't remember.  Hello Mrs. Robinson!  Though quite cute as a romantic
comedy, THE PALLBEARER is paced like a funeral march.  The characters
act, react, and interact at half-speed, making for one *excruciatingly*
long sit.  (And what's with the dreary lighting?) Co-writer/director
Matt Reeves brings some snap to the story's midsection; the film briefly
comes to life when our hero attempts to resolve his feelings for
*another* classmate (a very appealing Gwyneth Paltrow).  By this time,
though, most viewers will have either fled or fallen asleep.  Those
tough souls who stay with it can marvel at the sleepy-eyed Schwimmer, a
hound dog with a head cold, who can go for over an hour without ever
changing his expression.

     THE PALLBEARER is THE GRADUATE for the 90s.  The locale has been
shifted to Brooklyn and the protagonist lives only with his
insufferable mother (Carol Kane), but the rest of the major story
elements are in place.  Don't get me wrong, this is not a literal
remake, but if you try to count the number of similarities, you will
soon lose track.  First, and foremost, the twenty-five year old lead
character, Tom Thompson (David Schwimmer), sounds and acts like Dustin
Hoffman did in THE GRADUATE.
     The set up for THE PALLBEARER is that Ruth Abernathy (Barbara
Hershey), referred to in the film, of course, as Mrs. Abernathy a la
Mrs. Robinson, calls Tom and asks him to be a Pallbearer at her son
Bill's funeral.  There is a small problem in that, although Tom went to
high school with Bill, he does not remember him at all.  Moreover, none
of his friends from high school, Julie DeMarco (Gwyneth Paltrow), Brad
Schorr (Michael Rapaport), Cynthia Edelman (Toni Collette from MURIEL'S
WEDDING), Scott Edelman (Michael Vartan), and Lauren (Bitty Schram),
can remember Bill either.  When they look up Bill's picture in the
annual, it is blank, and the only info is that he was in the chess
club.
     Soon it goes from bad to worse as Ruth becomes convinced that Tom
was Bill's best friend and so gets Tom to agree to do the eulogy.  Tom
starts off with "Who is Bill Abernathy?  This is not an easy question
to answer."  He then goes on to wing it with his friends in the pews in
stitches.  The speech felt like it was lifted straight from Hugh
Grant's wedding speech in FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL.  This is one
derivative show from beginning to end.
     Just like in THE GRADUATE, Tom falls in love with the naturally
beautiful Julie who is his age.  At the same time, the older, heavily
made-up, peroxide blonde Mrs. Abernathy seduces him.  This puts him in
an untenable situation.  Remember the problems this caused in THE
GRADUATE?  Well, many of them are replayed here, but not as well.
     The problem with THE PALLBEARER has nothing to do with the casting
or the acting.  Most of the acting, with the exception of the poor
performance by Hershey, is fine.  The problem is the script by Jason
Katims and the directing by Matt Reeves.  The show is kept at the
superficial level.  There is not a character that is real or that you
care about.  Now, strictly as escapist entertainment, it almost works.
Certainly there are many big laughs in the show, but I left the movie
feeling a bit cheated and unsatisfied.  The film just does not realize
its potential.
     THE PALLBEARER runs too long at 1:46.  It is rated PG-13, but it
is a mild PG-13.  There is no sex, nudity, or violence, and the
language is pretty tame.  It would be fine for kids over 9 although I
suspect, given the subject matter, it might be more appropriate for
those over 12.  Several big laughs were not enough to get me to
recommend this retread, but I am giving it ** for the laughs and for
David Schwimmer's performance.

     If you haven't been beaten over the head enough with news of the grand
entrance of "Friend" David Schwimmer into the world of film, here's a
little more!
     Schwimmer's first outing, THE PALLBEARER, doesn't venture too far from
the "Friends" tree, as we are presented with a big romantic comedy that
borders on television kitschiness, full of screwball humor and plenty of
misunderstandings to fuel the plot.  In fact, the entire premise of THE
PALLBEARER is driven by one big misunderstanding itself:  Tom Thompson
(Schwimmer) is asked to give the eulogy at the funeral of Bill Abernathy, a
guy from high school who he doesn't even remember.  (While THE EULOGIST
might have been a more appropriate title, I figure a name like THE
PALLBEARER will confuse enough stupid American moviegoers anyway.)
     Tom reluctantly agrees to help out at the funeral thanks to the
sobbing and advances of Bill's seductress mother Ruth (a bleached-blonde
Barbara Hershey).  Of course, not remembering the deceased is good for at
least 40 minutes of laughs, the remainder of which are filled with Tom's
completely unrelated pursuit of high school crush Julie (Gwyneth Paltrow).
     Between Schwimmer's lost-puppy look and Paltrow's permanent pout, one
might think this is a serious movie about love and death, but of course
it's not.  In fact, with its large supporting cast of twentysomethings
variously afflicted with angst (including Michael Rapaport and Toni
Collette, Muriel from MURIEL'S WEDDING), it's a lot like a long "Friends"
episode ("The One With The Dead Guy").
     Now while I enjoy the show, I'm not too keen on a 94-minute version of
it, because as with many comedies, the jokes can get old, the story can get
silly, and the characters can get on your nerves.  While this isn't too bad
with THE PALLBEARER, it does happen on occasion, mainly because of director
Matt Reeves letting the film wallow in Tom's self-pity far too often.
Also, the progression of Tom's various romances here is a bit iffy, but at
least it gives schmucks like myself some hope for the future.
     Overall, THE PALLBEARER may not be as stylish or as funny as some of
the other comedies of 1996 like THE BIRDCAGE or FLIRTING WITH DISASTER, but
it's fairly good....  At least it's better than a funeral.

     Matt Reeves' THE PALLBEARER is loaded with none-to-subtle=20
references to Mike Nichols' 1967 classic, THE GRADUATE.  The problem is=20
that this mediocre toast to the past has lost its fizz, resulting in a=20
bland concoction that's as devoid of originality as it is of warmth and=20
humor. =20
     Oh, there are occasionally funny moments, but those are outnumbered=20
by instances when THE PALLBEARER makes its audience feel uncomfortable. =20
There is a funereal atmosphere, and even the most "lighthearted" scenes=20
are handled with a heavy hand.  This is the most grim comedy since=20
MURIEL'S WEDDING, but THE PALLBEARER is neither as well-written nor as=20
deftly directed.
     Only in the movies could a guy like David Schwimmer find himself=20
the romantic target of both Gwyneth Paltrow and Barbara Hershey. =20
Schwimmer plays Tom Thomas, a directionless, post-college architect=20
who's looking for a job, financial independence, and a way out of him=20
mother's house.  One day, Tom gets a phone call from a distressed woman,=20
Ruth Abernathy (Hershey), who wants Tom to be a pallbearer at her son's=20
funeral.  Tom doesn't remember the dead guy, but, unable to refuse a=20
crying woman, he agrees.  Meanwhile, Julie DeMarco (Paltrow), a high=20
school classmate Tom had a crush on, moves back to town, and he=20
convinces her to go out with him.  Complications arise when his attempts=20
to comfort Ruth develop into a sexual relationship, and Tom finds=20
himself caught between two women.
     There are some cute scenes between Schwimmer and Paltrow, but the=20
pairing with Hershey doesn't generate any heat or pathos.  Two of the=20
characters in the film, Tom's Mom (played by Carol Kane) and his best=20
friend, Brad (Michael Rapaport), are irritating beyond belief.  Rapaport=20
(BEAUTIFUL GIRLS) is normally annoying, so this is no surprise, but Kane=20
(THE PRINCESS BRIDE) is typically likable.
     Ultimately, the real problem is that THE PALLBEARER is a real=20
downer -- and it's more than just the title.  From the dark=20
cinematography, glum tone, and stagnant humor to the uninspired=20
direction, there aren't many reasons to like this film.  While it's not=20
a terrible example of movie making, it represents a clear picture of=20
mediocrity, and those hoping to see a '90s version of THE GRADUATE will=20
be disappointed.  THE PALLBEARER doesn't have what it takes to make the=20
grade.
