U-571 is a submarine war movie in almost all senses, but I couldn't help 
thinking of it as a warped science fiction movie. Space movie elements most 
have seen before are abundant here. The crew who sometimes doesn't get along, 
the ship/submarine that's not suited for flying/moving through water and 
needs repairs, the captain shouting off random commands to crew members that 
the audience doesn't understand, etc. During one point near the middle, 
Matthew McConaughey even says, "Make it so" a famous line often uttered by 
Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) in recent Star Trek movies and the Star 
Trek: The Next Generation television series. My mind drifted away with 
thoughts like these for the entire movie, yet it was easy to keep up with the 
events happening onscreen. U-571 takes some simple plot concepts and milks 
them for all they are worth. At times this makes for an entertaining action 
film thatâs easy to follow. At other times it's downright cheesy.
An American group of submariners led by Lt. Andrew Tyler (Matthew 
McConaughey) sneak onto a German submarine hoping to capture the Enigma 
cipher machine that would enable the American army to understand coded German 
radio communications. The group kills most of the crew inside and beats the 
ship up pretty bad, but soon their own ship gets blown up. This forces the 
American crew of nine to stay on the enemy submarine and pose as Germans when 
a German re-supply sub comes to help them. The crew, which includes Chief 
Klough (Harvey Keitel) and Tank (Dave Power), must work together to evade 
German ships in hostile waters. 
There is a lot to like about this movie. Some action sequences are 
spectacular. One particular scene where water explodes out of the ocean in a 
perfectly timed pattern is nothing short of amazing. The sound is also 
astounding. Remarkable care to the sound effects for this movie make it an 
easy contender for Best Sound and Best Sound Effects Editing at the Oscars. 
The sound really tests the theaterâs speaker system. Walking out of the 
movie, I became very surprised. I could still hear! Another nice thing about 
this movie is that the German characters actually speak in German. Instead of 
conversing in English with German accents, there are subtitles as they talk 
on the screen. These people are actually speaking in their native language. 
This is quite a surprise in a mainstream Hollywood action production.
The problem with U-571 is that it lacks appeal. The lead characters 
(McConaughey, Keitel, Paxton, and more) are always grimy, their faces soaked 
with sweat. I don't need to see Harvey Keitel or Bill Paxton with combed over 
hair ever again. It's hard to look at Matthew McConaughey and not see him 
naked playing bongo drums. The crew (which also features the Chris Rock of 
the 1940s) isn't very likable, and there was no chance to pick a favorite or 
choose someone to root for. U-571 is also under the crosshairs regarding its 
accuracy. In reality, the British actually captured the Enigma machine and 
many small details (mostly regarding the operation of a submarine) get 
overlooked. Some WWII veterans have said it's the, "Funniest movie they've 
ever seen." The ending of the movie made me groan with displeasure. It was 
just too unbelievable.
U-571 can't decide whether it wants to be Saving Private Ryan or Titanic, and 
it fails at both. Too many elements were implausible, and some good action 
doesn't make up for the actors and plotline. This submarine sinks without a 
doubt.

Okay, so the film doesn't exactly have the catchiest title in the world, but
how could you go wrong with Harvey Keitel and singer/actor Jon Bon Jovi in
the same movie? Well, uhhm....okay, forget that! All you have to remember is
that this is a submarine movie, an action submarine movie, a fun, loud,
easy-to-swallow action submarine movie. Slap in handsome naked
pothead/bongo-man Matthew McConaughey, and you've got yourself a swingin'
time!
PLOT:
World War II is raging on when an American Navy crew is sent to overtake a
stranded Nazi U-boat (aka nasty sub), stuck somewhere in the middle of the
ocean. Their mission: to capture their unique decoding device.
CRITIQUE:
A loud, fast-paced, simple story set within the always tense environment of
a submarine, featuring a lot of repetitive "sub-talk", great looking men in
cool Navy garb and the official christening of the summer popcorn flick
season. (Splashes) I can't say that much about this film surprised me, in
fact, I can't say that anything about it really did. But I suppose there are
only so many ways that one could tell a story in a sub. Lots of cramped
quarters, an all-male crew tossing jargon upon jargon back and forth, others
manning the electronic surveillance equipment diligently, everyone bracing
for impact, or hoping for the non-impact. The proverbial "dive, dive, dive"
bellow from the captain, the rookie member of the crew with his big moment
to shine, the captain's difficult decision to make, the staple scene of the
entire crew stripping down to their skibbies and getting "jiggy" with one
another. Well, okay...that last one was just to see if you were paying
attention! (Splashes)
All in all, the film does deliver on its intended purpose: to entertain. I
thoroughly enjoyed the film while I was there, liked the loud booms and
bangs of the detonations, felt like I was getting thrown around just like
one of the crew. Really liked the actors, McConaughey in particular, with
his great looks, great hair and subtle confidence...a perfect casting
choice. Keitel was also decent in his second fiddle role, as were the rest
of the dirty group, who all seemed real enough for me to care about.
(Splashes) Of course, the screenplay doesn't really get too deep in respect
to any of the characters, or the story for that matter (Nazis
bad...Americans good), but these aren't exactly the types of films which
accentuate character development. This film is about having fun, believing
what you see, being entertained and made especially for those who enjoy the
easy, crunchy, action movies. Admittedly, I could have done without the
umpteen shots of people staring at the sky waiting for the eventual
impact/non-impact or the cheesy dialogue here and there, but God bless
America, because this movie took my mind off my crappy problems du jour and
at the end of the day...that's what it's all about! Get the nachos, grab the
better half, spread some salsa all around and have yourself a good time!
(Splashes)
The (Splashes) references throughout my text are made to poke fun at a
recurring line from the film which was just too good to pass up. And for all
you Jovi fans who want to know how the man makes out in this film, allow me
to put your minds at ease, since he does deliver a pretty decent
performance. Of course, things do get a little slippery when wet, right?
(Sorry, but I just had to!)
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Director Jonathan Mostow recently dropped an email over at our good buddy
Harry Knowles' infamous movie site, and offered him some behind-the-scenes
pictures of the full-scale 600 ton diesel-powered submarine replica which
they built especially for this film. If you'd like to see the pics, visit:
http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/display.cgi?id=5693
Actor Jack Noseworthy also starred in director Mostow's second picture
called BREAKDOWN starring Kurt Russell. Mostow's directorial debut came in
1989 when he helmed the comedy BEVERLY HILLS BODYSNATCHERS starring TV
"Alice's" own Vic Tayback. Incidentally, Jack Noseworthy was also featured
in a Bon Jovi video called "Always". Ironically, he co-stars with Jovi in
this movie.
Jon Bon Jovi's birth name is John Francis Bongiovi. Jovi lost the lead role
in CROW: CITY OF ANGELS to French actor Vincent Perez (Thank your lucky
stars, Johnny boy!).
Harvey Keitel is a great actor who is also known for showing off his
"goodies" onscreen in various pictures including THE PIANO, BAD LIEUTENANT
and FINGERS. Rock on, Harv!

     Well, let's get this out of the way immediately.  It did not
really happen this way.  If you read the statement at the end of the
film, even the film tells you that it did not happen this way.  The
first Enigma machine was captured months earlier than this film's
Spring 1942 setting.  It was the British H.M.S. Bulldog whose 1941
mission in the North Atlantic captured the first Enigma.  Americans did
capture a U-boat with an Enigma machine, but not until 1944--much later
in the war.  In fact, even that was a total foul-up.  If the Germans
learned that the Americans had captured an Enigma they would have
changed their codes and ruined the precious work done by the British
cryptographers.
     It was the British who cracked the German military code Enigma in
World War II (building on pervious work by Polish mathematicians
earlier in the war).  That task required a chain of extraordinary
feats, not the least of which was capturing one of the machines.  When
Michael Caton-Jones wanted to make an exciting film about flying
bombing runs over Germany he fibbed and made it the last flight of the
Memphis Belle in the film MEMPHIS BELLE.  The real last flight was not
so dramatic.  It is a sort of dramatic license.  Similarly when
Jonathan Mostow wanted to make a film about submarine warfare in World
War II, he invented a fictional American mission to capture an Enigma
box in 1942.  And for those who think that it is so terrible for
Americans to claim what was really a British accomplishment, I suggest
they look up David Lean's 1952 film THE SOUND BARRIER.  So now we are
even with the British.
     It is spring, maybe four months after Pearl Harbor, and the crew
of an American submarine, the S-33, is called back early from leave for
a special mission that will not wait.  Commanding the submarine through
this world of rain, wind, steel, fire, and water, a world of heavy
machinery, darkness, and loud explosions, is Captain Dahlgren (played
by Bill Paxton) and his second in command, just passed over for
promotion to his own command, is Lt. Andrew Tyler (Matthew
McConaughey).  Tensions arise as Tyler knows that the reason he was not
promoted is that Dahlgren would not recommend him for command.  But
Tyler is going to get his taste of command this mission.
     The S-33 has been modified to look like a German U-boat in a
deception intended to help the crew capture the disabled U-571.  This
U-boat has an Enigma code machine.  The plan is to capture the machine
and scuttle the U-boat so the Germans assume that the Enigma machine is
lost.  But as the title suggests, the U-boat will play a more important
role in the story than that.  Once the American crew finds the U-571
the pace of this film is non-stop up to the closing credits.
     The real problem with U-571 is the amount that has been recycled
from previous films.  The very first shot is just an eye staring.  In a
second or two we realize that it is an eye staring into a submarine
periscope.  It is very similar to the opening scene in THE RUSSIANS ARE
COMING, THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING.  In the next seconds the U-boat
torpedoes a ship and then looks around to see a destroyer headed
straight at the periscope.  Seen almost from the level of the surface
of the water it is a sobering sight.  It certainly was in the film DAS
BOOT.  The filmmakers have used very little imagination to show us
situations we have not seen before.  Perhaps DAS BOOT used up all the
good anxiety scenes that one can have with a U-boat.  But all the
classic submarine film scare sequences are somewhere here.  The
submarine is depth charged as the crew sits and listens waiting for the
concussion that will spell their death.  There is the sequence with a
submarine sinking too deep.  The water squirts in as if from a fire
hose and gauges crack.  A bolt flies like a bullet.  (That is why
submarine hulls are welded, not bolted.  That would not happen in real
life.)
     Jonathan Mostow, who is best known for having written and directed
the very different film BREAKDOWN, repeats those functions in this
film.  The script calls for Paxton to be mature and McConaughey to be a
little less self-possessed.  They do that reasonably well, but neither
gives a memorable performance.  McConaughey looks like he is under
pressure and sweats well, but does not make the audience identify with
him.  Harvey Keitel is a good actor who almost always plays someone
unsavory and somebody who lives outside of society.  It is something of
a departure seeing him playing a good decent career navy man with
nothing but decent intentions.  His few major scenes are really the
acting that I will remember.  Jon Bon Jovi is hardly noticeable in the
film and that is probably just fine.  Richard Marvin's score sounds
brassy and martial, but unlike the characters, the score plays it safe
and takes no chances.  Mostow, however, does take some chances and the
biggest is making this film that will obviously invite comparison to
the modern classic submarine film DAS BOOT.  He loses but, it is a
competition he could probably never have hoped to win.
     Perhaps we should consider U-571 to be just a fanciful thriller
set in World War II in the style of Alastair MacLean.  It is a "could
have happened but didn't" sort of action tale like THE GUNS OF
NAVARONE.  But for the familiarity of the situations I would have rated
it fairly well.  I give it 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the
-4 to +4 scale.
     [In November 1999 PBS ran a very good documentary, "Decoding Nazi
Secrets" on what all was involved in breaking the code.  Details are
available at http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/decoding.]  By the way,
capturing a U-boat is one thing, figuring out how to run it in a matter
of minutes is something very different.  It should have taken days.
That is one more place where this film takes liberties with the truth.

The "submarine" genre of movies seems to be one of the most intriguing
and compelling types of storytelling there is.  Think about it... these
films are completely based in reality, yet only a handful of people have
ever been on one, making them fascinating to the general public.  They
aren't like movies that take place on a plane or a train, as anybody can
get on one of those.  And they aren't like movies that happen in outer
space either, because no one's done any of that stuff yet.  When a new
one comes out, you don't hear anyone say "ugh, another submarine movie"
like people tend to say "ugh, another boxing movie".  Look at modern
movies that involve submarines: Das Boot, The Abyss, The Hunt for Red
October, Crimson Tide... all are well regarded as top-notch
entertainment. 
Gladly joining that bunch is U-571, which stars Matthew McConaughey as
the executive officer of a U.S. Naval submarine during World War II. We
learn he has been denied a recommendation for his own command by his
superior (Bill Paxton).  McConaughey's crew then receives orders that
they will be boarding a disabled German submarine to steal the Enigma, a
German communications encoding device that has stumped Allied
Intelligence.  The mission goes horribly wrong however, and as a result,
McConaughey and only a handful of his crew (as well as a captured
German) become trapped aboard the U-571 in enemy waters. 
The first great thing about U-571 is the film's opening sequence.  The
German crew of U-571 are under attack, which sets the events of the rest
of the film into motion.  It's tense, exciting and fascinating.  And I
applaud the filmmakers for not copping out and instead keeping the
entire sequence in German with English subtitles.  Most movies with a
scene this long would have panicked and had the German crew speaking
English right away. 
Once the plot gets moving, U-571 gives us action sequence after action
sequence, making the audience wonder "Ok, now how do they get out of
this?".  The stakes keep raising (much like in Executive Decision, an
excellent action-thriller), and even though the audience knows how the
film will end, it's a lot of fun getting there. 
I only have two minor complaints about the entire film.  The first comes
from the scenes which follow the opening sequence.  While their purpose
is to introduce us to the characters and to get the story going (which
they do), I feel as though it could have been done much quicker, and
less conventionally.  I mean, did we really have to see the ship's crew
at a wedding?  Because of that, you now know exactly what's going to
happen to the groom! 
My other gripe would be during the film's finale.  There's an explosion
which ends the film that is one of the weakest looking CGI effects since
the President's plane crashed into the ocean at the end of Air Force
One.  I cannot stress this enough... until a CGI effect can be made to
look like a model effect, stick with using models. 
Yes, U-571 is historically incorrect and there are surely some specifics
in the plot that people who have been onboard a submarine will tell you
"that couldn't happen", but the overall point of this film is
entertainment.  It succeeds fantastically.  [PG-13]

Jovi, Bill Paxton, Erik Palladino, Tom Guiry, T.C.
Carson, David Keith, Jake Weber, Jack Noseworthy,
Matthew Settle, Will Estes, and Dave Power.
I had lost all faith in PG-13 movies that are intended
for teenagers and adults. The last dozen or so that I
have seen have all felt incomplete, as if the most
crucial scene was deleted in order to obtain a more
lucrative rating. However, after seeing the creative
Frequency last week and now the exciting U-571, my
bias is beginning to go away. Both films are as
innocuous for younger viewers as they are intellectual
for older viewers. Even better, I didn't think either
one of these films would be any good from first
instincts. Everyone loves surprises. U-571 looked like
another action film using an actual war as an excuse
to shoot torpedoes and bullets. This may be true, but
the action is so extraordinary that it is clear
director/co-writer Jonathan Mostow completed his
ultimate goal; to blow the audience's socks off. 
Set during the early stages of World War 2 when the
United States struggled to break the codes of the
technologically advanced German U-boats, U-571 follows
a small crew of American men who swipe the typewriter
necessary to solve the enigma from an enemy ship.
There's only one problem: the American ship they came
from and hoped to return to has been shot down
stranding the men on a German submarine known as (you
guessed it) U-571. It is now up to the mostly young
and inexperienced sailors, led by an interim captain
named Tyler (Matthew McConaughey), to return the
typewriter to America without getting sunk by far
superior German ships. 
The film starts off very slowly with a somewhat weak
opening action sequence and another uneventful half an
hour to introduce several of the sailors (most of whom
die when the mission goes awry or just inexplicably
disappear). Once the crew gets on the U-boat, the
movie shifts to another level and never leaves this
high energy level until the ending credits roll down.
As soon as the action starts, it does not stop and
luckily, because it is so exciting, I didn't want it
to stop. This is not a movie for those wanting to
avoid loud noises, from the wonderful, heart-pounding
score to the constant yelling of panicking men, make
sure you see this at a theater with
surround-soundotherwise, do not see it all.  
The best parts of U-571 are when Tyler is forced to
make impromptu decisions on how to escape seemingly
impossible situations. Throughout the movie, several
morals or characters are introduced to make Tyler's
job as stressful as possible. Germans gun down their
own men, Tyler's mentor Captain Dahlgren warns him
that a captain has to be prepared to sacrifice even
the most beloved soldiers for a victory, another
sailor (Erik Palladino) threatens mutiny. All of these
examples, and several others, increase the chaotic
atmosphere and the importance of Tyler's every move.
They also make U-571 one of the most exhilarating
movies I have seen in a while.

     I'll tell you how U-571 ends: The good guys win. I'll let on another
key piece of information: When two characters are engaged in conversation
during a non-combat moment, you can bet your life that there should be a
bright red neon sign beneath the characters' faces that flashes the word
"FORESHADOWING" over and over again. We know the villains are villains
because they mow down unarmed survivors with their deck guns; we know the
heroes are heroes because they'll even save the lives of one of the
villains. Moral complexity? Psychology? Subtext? Who has time for 'em? 
U-571 is a relentless plot machine. It's narrative film-making stripped
down to the barest essentials: a plot, people to move the plot forward and
a director to set the pace.
     The director in this case happens to be Jonathan Mostow, who
previously helmed the relentless plot machine called BREAKDOWN. And he's
very good at wringing every last drop of adrenaline out of his propulsive, 
generic tales. U-571 wrinkles history a bit to tell the story of an
American mission to nab an Enigma code device -- which had been allowing
German U-boats to pick their way through the North Atlantic fleet with
little resistance -- from a crippled U-boat. The crew of an American
submarine gets the job, including just-passed-over-for-a-command Lt. Andy
Tyler (Matthew McConaughey). Posing as part of a German supply crew, the
Americans manage to subdue their German counterparts. In fact, that turns
out to be the easy part of the mission, as a torpedo to the American sub
leaves her crew trapped on U-571.
     The emphasis should be on the word "crew," because it's not
particularly easy -- or, in fact, necessary -- to distinguish between
individual crew members. Since McConaughey and Harvey Keitel (as Chief) 
are the most recognizable faces, they get a few moments of individual
character development. The rest of the bunch either play necessary plot
roles -- the radio operator (Jack Noseworthy) keeps us up to date on
exactly how close to disaster our protagonists are; the vaguely unsavory
military intelligence operative (Jake Weber) is around to remind us they
must succeed or die trying -- or have endearing nicknames like Tank,
Rabbit or Trigger. I have now effectively put as much time into 
delineating the individual characters as the screenwriters did. For two
hours, they are asked to scramble about madly trying to keep the sub from
sinking. Thank you for your time, Mr. Noseworthy, and here's your check.
     Ordinarily, an action film with such a minimal concern for its human
beings sets me to slumping despairingly in my seat. Mostow, on the other
hand, has a knack for keeping me on the edge of it. U-571 takes us from
one almost-impossible situation to another, never allowing the film to
rest long enough for the whole enterprise to seem shallow. There would
seem to be only so many ways to make spraying water, shuddering submarines
and nautical maneuvers exciting, but Mostow finds every one of them. You
know you're in the hands of a gifted action film-maker when you find
yourself watching scenes that should have you scoffing, but instead have
you cringing in anticipation. There's not a reason in the world to care
about any of the people on board U-571, except as representations of our
noble fighting men. Mostow managed to keep me enthralled in the fate of a
sub full of puppets.
     Of course it would have been preferable for U-571 to seem a bit more
concerned with men under fire. In a way it's a throwback to the World War
II films of a bygone era, interested primarily in waving the flag for the
bravery of those who whipped Jerry into submission. Circa 2000, you can
also add big-budget special effects and killer sound to the mix (do
yourself a favor and see it in a theater that will have you shrinking from
the straining walls). And you can add Jonathan Mostow, a director who's
never going to be confused with Eric Rohmer when it comes to exploring the
nuances of the human condition. The man can keep you hanging on to your
armrests, though, and that's a rare talent. U-571 doesn't take its sub to
any great depths. It just keeps the boat rockin'.

"The moment I get confused, I check out of the movie. When all of a sudden 
stuff starts happening, and I don't know where I'm at... well, I think an 
audience has, like, an umbilical cord to the screen, and it gets severed when 
confusion comes in."
    --Quentin Tarantino
Well put. That's exactly what happened to me right in the middle of "U-571". 
Submarine movies are inevitably going to be claustrophobic, sweaty, noisy and 
dark -- tension turns this into masterful entertainment, confusion kills it.
The setting is World War Two. A squad in the U.S. Navy, led by Bill Paxton 
and Matthew McConaughey, have been ordered to seize a German U-boat that 
carries the radio codes used by Nazi submarines to plan attacks on Allied 
shipping. The movie opens with a cliché -- introducing us to all the boys at 
a big gala, before an urgent telegram comes in, informing them to return to 
their posts -- but there was still hope for the film at this point, because 
it has a promising appearance, with period texture perfectly captured. People 
looked, talked and walked differently in the 1940s; they had different ways 
of eating, washing, learning, wearing clothes. Many period films just plant 
obviously contemporary figures among archaic props, but the director of 
"U-571", Jonathan Mostow, gets the details just right.
There is tension on the boat before the big attack. It's a risky assignment, 
having to seize this sub, and these guys are sailors, not combat soldiers. If 
it goes wrong, not only is everyone dead, but the Germans will change their 
codes and tighten their security, and that may have implications for the 
outcome of the war.
At the decisive moment of action, when the Americans sneak onto the German 
boat by posing as a supply ship, I got completely lost as to what was going 
on. One of the sailors plants dynamite somewhere, and we can't tell if he's 
supposed to be doing so or not. Something explodes elsewhere, and the cause 
is never made clear. Someone thinks they've found a code book, and we're not 
sure if they have or not. A load of Americans end up in the water for no 
reason, and they don't swim the few metres back to their sub, they just 
scream and drown. Why?
This isn't one of those battle scenes that's supposed to disorientate us. 
It's an incompetently shot beginning to the film's middle section. So, with 
my umbilical cord severed, I found it hard to watch the rest of the film, 
with the guys in the submarine shouting impenetrable jargon and running 
around tight spaces, often with no clear purpose.
The scenes I did manage to follow were repetitive and silly: Every now and 
again a new obstacle would come up, and McConaughey would give an order as to 
how to combat it. Two of the other men would take separate turns to repeat 
these instructions verbatim, in hushed awe. It would be carried out to the 
letter, and work. Then they'd repeat it back to themselves, and say "Phew!"
Even some of the visual effects are shoddy. I'm amazed that Hollywood seems 
to be going backwards in this respect -- two or three years ago complimenting 
a movie's technological wizardry seemed redundant, but now, with releases 
such as "Battlefield Earth" on our screens, we seem to have returned to the 
days of shoddy "Star Wars" rip-offs. "U-571" has a torpedo attack that looks 
like it was shot by a kid throwing toys at a camcorder in the bathtub. And in 
the shots where people are supposed to be drowning, they look awfully in 
control: remember the scene with the rubber octopus in "Ed Wood"?
I feel sympathy for Mostow, who spent eight years of his life on this 
project, and has come out with something that can't be taken seriously. It 
did fill me with respect for World War Two veterans, but only in the sense 
that if their experiences were anything near as stifling or boring as the 
movie, then it's amazing they managed to carry on making important strategic 
decisions. The end credits reveal, by the way, that it was the British, not 
the Americans, who were actually the heroes of the German code-breaking 
operation. How nice that the filmmakers thought to tell us.

It isn't the most original movie.  It doesn't have the most
interesting characters.  It's been done before, in a multitude of
ways.
The premise of U-571 is a familiar one.  A submarine crew gets
called out to do An Important Mission, that may Win the War for
the United States. (Oh, were there other countries that were in
the war on the Allied side, too?  No matter, it's irrelevant.)
We saw this in Hunt for Red October.  We've seen it in countless
World War II movies.  We even saw it in Crimson Tide, for crying
out loud.
So what makes this movie different?  Well, the details of the
plot are slightly different.  This time, the plucky submarine
crew is out to capture a coding device from a crippled German
submarine.  The coding device must be captured at all costs.  It
is more important than the lives of any of the men on the crew.
Also, there is an Executive Officer who was only recently turned
down for a captain's position, because his commanding officer
felt that he was not ready to order men to their deaths.  Hmm.
Combine these two plot points, and I'm sure you can see where the
movie is heading.  
And even as predictable as all of this is, I still liked this
movie!  It's a great adventure movie, uncluttered by any of the
irrelevant crap that so often weighs down otherwise-good
adventure movies.  There was no romantic interest, pining away at
home for her man at sea.  There were no unnecessary shots of the
commanding forces back on land, planning out what should be done.
There was only the submarine, the men, and the enemy, and a fine
adventure story tying them all together.
Sure, the character development was crappy, but it was also
unimportant.  You knew what you had to know about these
characters:  this man is the crusty drill sergeant, this man is
the hothead who's going to screw everything up, this man is the
noble and principled commander, and this man is the plucky
enlisted man who will do anything for his captain.  For this
movie, those outlined character sketches were all that were
necessary.  
I found myself biting my nails during a few key points of this
movie.  The suspense and drama drew me in, made me want to know
what happened next.  This is not a movie during which I would
have felt comfortable leaving for ten minutes to get popcorn --
not because I would have missed important plot, but because I
would have missed the action, and in this movie, the action was
what was important.  Will they avoid the depth charges?  Will the
submarine survive at this depth?  Will the commanding officer be
able to give the command to abandon some of his men?  What will
happen?
All things considered, I'll give this movie a favorable review.
It's not the best movie ever, but it was a fun ride, and that's
all I wanted it to be.

Kretschmann, Matthew Settle.

Rated PG-13.
"U-571" is the kind of movie that cannot be taken seriously. In fact, it 
is absolutely imperative that you don't take it seriously. At all. If 
you do, you'll hate it. But this isn't a terribly serious movie; it's 
cotton candy cinema. You pays your money, you gets your thrills, and you 
shouldn't expect anything more. It's also somewhat pointless to harp on 
the obvious: "U-571" is filled with war movie clichE9s, stands as a =
retread of previous submarine movies ("The Hunt for Red October," 
"Crimson Tide"), and therefore doesn't have much in the way of original 
material to offer. But I liked it. Why? Because this movie manages to do 
something that a lot of bloated Hollywood blockbusters don't: give the 
audience no-frills, old-fashioned entertainment. I didn't gain any great 
insights from "U-571," but I had a blast watching it.
The plot? OK, so there are these men, see, and they're on a submarine, 
see, and they're trying to steal something from another submarine, see, 
and it doesn't quite go as planned and . . . oh. You want names, don't 
you? Fine: Lt. Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaughey) is the executive 
officer (i.e. second in command) aboard an American submarine during 
World War II. His captain (Bill Paxton) doesn't think he's ready for his 
own boat, so despite Tyler's impressive service record, he has withheld 
his recommendation. While on shore leave, the crew of the sub is called 
into action: A German sub has been disabled somewhere in the Atlantic, 
and that sub, the U-571, contains a special encoding device called the 
Enigma. Since its capture means they will be able to crack the German 
code, the Allies want to get their hands on this device, and the mission 
is to board the ship disguised as German sailors, steal the Enigma 
machine, and get out without anyone knowing. Unfortunately, the plan 
goes awry when the American sub is destroyed during the raid, leaving 
Tyler and a skeleton crew stranded aboard the disabled U-571 boat.
But as I said before, specifics don't matter. What matters is that 
director Jonathan Mostow manages to hit the proper marks with a simple 
premise, so "U-571" has very little to bog it down. There is a simple, 
straightforward narrative, nary an extraneous subplot, and a simple 
goal, and that's all you need to make an effective adventure movie. 
You'd think it's an easy thing to do, but recent action films have 
repeatedly failed to get the point. Either we got murky self-importance 
("End of Days"), annoyingly "clever" self-parody ("The Mummy"), or 
pointless and underdeveloped subplots ("The 13th Warrior"). Compared to 
some of the action-oriented duds thrown our way in the last year, 
"U-571" is remarkably unpretentious. Mostow keeps it simple: The 
Americans are the good guys (duh), the Nazis are the bad guys (double 
duh), and the Americans have to fight improbable odds to beat the Nazis. 
This gives us ample opportunity for nail-biting action sequences with 
plenty of leaking water, shaking subs, and the requisite big explosion 
to top it all off. Mostow handles this all with marvelous economy; there 
are few unnecessary scenes, and action sequences don't run any longer 
than they have to. Any director wondering how to properly make a big, 
dumb, entertaining movie should give this guy a call.
The cast, most likely realizing they are only around as props, just say 
their lines and get out of the way. In a movie like "U-571," this is as 
it should be. McConaughey, Paxton, Harvey Keitel, Jon Bon Jovi (your 
guess is as good as mine), and a score of hard-nosed sailors deliver 
their frequently dopey one-liners and patriotic soliloquies with 
square-jawed conviction. That's all they're required to do. After all, 
we don't root for these guys because they're fully-realized human 
characters (and they most definitely aren't); we root for them because 
they're remarkably less evil than the Nazis. Most of the actors' lines 
practically scream "Exposition!" or "Foreshadowing!" But that's okay -- 
if you're looking for character development, you're in the wrong place. 
Let me see, if McConaughey's character has been held back because he's 
"too close to his men," will he have to make a difficult decision later 
in the film to sacrifice one of his crew? If there's a German captive 
kept -- alive -- on board the sub, will he try to sabotage the 
Americans' chances? Will the good guys win out in the end? Don't worry; 
you don't have to answer those questions.
So yes, the plot developments in "U-571" are awfully predictable. They 
also happen at reasonable times, and nothing is overly contrived. When a 
young sailor has to display some selfless heroism, it happens at the 
right time. When the Nazi gets his comeuppance, it happens at the right 
time. Once it gets past the fairly quick character introductions and 
becomes focused the accomplishment of a simple goal, "U-571" is 
astoundingly well-paced. It's also Hollywood entertainment, which means 
that it should not be confused with a history lesson. Controversy has 
arisen about the film's decision to depict the main heroes as Americans, 
despite the fact that the first Enigma machines were actually captured 
by the British Navy. The film does include some end credit title cards 
to document these achievements, so it's at least managed to cover its 
bases, but to me, this controversy seems like much ado about nothing. Is 
anybody going to mistake "U-571" for a factual document? I hope not.
It's easy to complain about historical inaccuracies in an action film, 
just as it's easy to snipe at cardboard characters and a thin plot. In 
fact, after watching "U-571," there isn't a whole lot to say in its 
favor, at least not from a quantitative standpoint. I found that the 
film fell apart quite easily upon even a cursory reflection. But therein 
lay my problem: I was *thinking* too much. "U-571" is not the kind of 
film you have in-depth discussions on; it's the kind of film you watch 
and appreciate how much the armrest-grabbing suspense and spectacular 
action is making you forget you're watching trash. You're not in a movie 
theater; you're 200 meters below the surface, much deeper than the 
submarine was meant to go, the Nazis are dropping depth charges on your 
head, and you're scared as hell. That's where "U-571" shines. Jonathan 
Mostow hasn't made an intelligent, thought-provoking film out of 
"U-571," but he didn't try to. He just wanted to give us two hours of 
solid entertainment. That he has.

Directed by Jonathan Mostow. Screenplay by Mostow, Sam Montgomery and 
David Ayer, from a story by Mostow. Starring Matthew McConaughey, Harvey 
Keitel, Jake Weber. Running time: 119 minutes. Rated PG for mild language
by the MFCB. Reviewed on April 30th, 2000.
For the past few years, most movies set during World War II have been 
more about the mentality and morals of war than about simple military 
adventure and heroics. Even the last great submarine movie, "The Hunt For 
Red October," was as much a character study of Sean Connery's Captain 
Marko Ramius as it was a Tom Clancy actioner. "U-571" bucks this trend, 
hearkening back to the simple but exciting Saturday matinee flicks which 
were so popular half a century ago.
The plot here is straightforward, existing mainly as an excuse for 
deep-sea dramatics. A British destroyer has crippled a German U-boat, 
the U-571. The Allies are aware that the submarine is equipped with an 
Enigma device -- the key to unlocking Nazi ciphers, and possibly to 
winning the War. An American sub is sent out to reconnoitre with U-571, 
poising as a German supply ship. The American troops are to seize the 
vessel, capture the crew, and bring the Enigma back to their ship. All 
this has to be done without the Nazis getting suspicious, because if they 
find out the Allies have the Enigma, they'll just change their codes and all
will be for naught.
The mission, led by young up-and-comer Executive Officer Lieutenant 
Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaughey), goes smoothly at first. Then the 
American sub gets torpedoed, killing most of its crew except for the 
U-571 boarding party. Trapped on the damaged German submarine, Tyler and 
his remaining men have to find their way back to Allied territory before 
they're discovered by the Nazis.
In terms of being sheer popcorn fare, "U-571" does a pretty good job. 
Although the film takes too long to get going, things heat up nicely once 
the Americans are trapped on board the U-boat, and the tension keeps 
building from there. Particularly exciting is a lengthy sequence in which 
the sub is being depth-bombed by a Nazi ship. Having devised a desperate 
plan for survival, Tyler orders his crew to take the dilapidated vessel 
deeper than it should go even under normal operating conditions. The 
explosions get nearer and nearer; the groaning of the bulkheads grows 
constantly louder. It's an engrossing piece of cinema.
But other plot developments are more routine. For instance, in the 
aftermath of the explosion of their ship, the Americans find the Nazi 
captain of the U-571 (Thomas Kretschmann), still manacled after his initial 
capture, struggling to stay afloat. In an act of mercy, Tyler has him 
pulled out of the water and chained up in the engine room. I was counting 
the minutes until the captain betrayed the Americans, and my expectations 
proved correct on not one but two occasions. A lot of the movie feels 
like this: standard action/military scenes transposed onto the submarine 
setting.
"U-571's" biggest deficiencies, though, lie in its almost total lack of 
characterisation. Part of what makes other war movies, like "Saving 
Private Ryan," so good is that each of the soldiers involved are 
portrayed with depth and feeling. They might not have a lot of screen 
time, but they feel like real people with real lives nonetheless.
The same cannot be said of the cast of "U-571", who prove to be a 
faceless, unmemorable bunch. Even the main stars play cookie-cutter 
characters. Take McConaughey's Andrew Tyler, for example. At the start of 
the movie, he argues with his commanding officer, Mike Dahlgren (Bill 
Paxton) about whether he's ready for his own command. Dahlgren doesn't 
believe he is, and explains why. By the end of "U-571", surprise 
surprise, Tyler has learned exactly those lessons Dahlgren had described. 
You could almost check them off a list as they come up. Tyler is just a 
standard military action hero, and what attempt there is to flesh him out 
comes across as transparent and uninspired, like the above. McConaughey 
does a decent enough job as the heroic lead, but to propel it, "U-571" 
needs its lead to be more interesting than that.
The other headliners are similar non-entities. Harvey Keitel plays the 
Chief as if he'd just stepped out of any one of a hundred similar movies. 
He's an old sea dog who hands out spoonfuls of advice every few scenes on 
cue. Jon Bon Jovi, in his acting debut, is passable but forgettable as 
Tyler's best friend, Pete Emmett. Paxton is surprisingly lacking in 
passion or involvement as Dahlgren.
At least "U-571" looks good. Despite the limited choices of location and 
camera angles, director (and co-writer) Jonathan Mostow keeps our eyes 
glued on the screen. There are some nice shots, for instance, where the 
camera actually follows the submarine as it dives beneath the waves. On 
the other hand, one thing Mostow seems to attempt with success is to 
convey a sense of claustrophobia in the leaky submarine. Characters sweat 
and look about nervously, and water drips from every corner. But the feeling
that those metal walls are closing about them -- just barely keeping out 
the crushing ocean waves -- simply isn't there.
As light entertainment, you could certainly do worse than "U-571". It's 
fun and exciting, and every now and then might even set your pulse racing 
a little faster. But ultimately, as a big-budget update of those old 
postwar action films, Mostow has borrowed a few plot elements and 
characters too many. And in the end, that's what sinks "U-571".

   My gosh.  There's so much tension in the eyes of the fellas
in one of the German navy's unterwasserschiffen, so much
sweat pouring down foreheads for most of this movie's 118
minutes, that you'd think that these sailors all live in a yellow
submarine.  The only yellow here is this lemon of a war
movie--in most ways a second-rate "Das Boot"--but U-571
sure is an unusual vessel.  The U-571 that Lt. Andrew Tyler
(Matthew McConaughey), Captain Dahlgren (Bill Paxton),
Chief Klough (Harvey Keitel), Lt. Pete Emmett (Jon Bon Jovi),
and Lt. Hirsch (Jake Weber) have boarded is not an
American craft but one built in Germany to house several
Nazi sailors with a modicum of comfort.  What makes this U-
571 distinctive, however, is only partly that Americans and
not Germans are running it.  The boat houses the Enigma, a
decoding device that looks like one of those stenotype
gadgets which courtroom reporters use, but instead of
chronicling events at a trial, this baby is doing so much
damage to the Allied forces that the wrong guys are winning
the war. At least that's the impression we get from the
stalwart officers and their men who have captured a Nazi
sub, gunning down the fellas who fight for the Fuhrer, and
taking its captain prisoner.
   Not too long into the movie, any discerning observer soon
realizes that this is not going to be "Das Boot Zwei."  The
1981 movie a.k.a. "The Boat," directed by Wolfgang Petersen
and based on the novel by Lothar G. Buchheim is above all a
human story.  Politics takes a back seat to a drama in which
the German characters are so well developed that an
American audience cannot help sympathizing with the enemy. 
The captain of Das Boot does not even like Hitler, and has no
problem expressing his disdain for the little German dictator
who started the great big war.  He and his men just want to
survive, so they spend their time talking about their lives back
home rather than about Mein Kampf while they sing "It's a
Long Way to Tipperary," because that has a bouncier tune
than "The Horst Wessel Lied."
   By contrast, while the claustrophobia of submarine life
comes across in Jonathan Mostow's movie, the battle scenes
are repetitious (how much tension can be generated by depth
charges fifteen minutes into the movie, twenty-five, thirty, and
so on) but what is most disappointing is that these men have
no stories to tell.  No, that's not entirely true.  One ensign,
informed that the 48-hour liberty is cancelled, whines "I didn't
even have time to consummate my marriage," though he
does not seem all that upset.  On board, another enlisted
man tells of a foolproof way he gets women to "come
across."  He talks to them about pressure introduced when a
submarine dives below 150 meters.  This may not be much of
a "line," but we all know that this Casanova is interested only
in foreshadowing what his boat is going to do.
   The only theme resembling a human story in "U-571"
centers on Lt. Andrew Tyler, who complains to Capt.
Dahlgren that he was not given command of a boat. 
Dahlgren is sympathetic to the hard-working lieutenant but
thinks the young man is not ready to assume such a
responsibility.  In Dahlgren's view, Tyler is too wishy-washy,
that the lieutenant feels so close to his men that he may not
be willing to give them an order that could result in any loss
of life.  Predictably enough, Tyler gets his chance to prove
his superior officer wrong when Dahlgren is killed in action
and Tyler assumes command of the sub.
   "U-571" is a World War II action drama about a U.S. Navy
submarine captain on a mission to steal a decoding device
from the German sub that houses it, a device that enables
the Nazis to communicate positions of Allied shipping on the
Atlantic.  The contraption must be snatched in a such a way
that the Germans are unable to transmit information to their
own side lest Germany simply change the code.  The most
absorbing part of the film occurs when the Captain Dahlgren,
shipping out on a fleabag of a sub disguised as a Nazi
vessel, sends a party of impersonators out on a raft to board
the opposing U-571, taking command after a furious
exchange of gunfire only to see his own craft go under. 
Unfamiliar with the German labels (only one man aboard can
read the language), the Yanks do the best that they can,
holding their breath as a German plane hovers over them
undecided about whether to strafe the Americans or to accept
them as Germans.  
   After the usual events--a German prisoner breaks free of
his chains and threatens the entire project, for example--the
new captain is tested.  As a German destroyer approaches
the U-571, he orders to sub to descend to a position so close
to the ocean floor that the pressure could crack it like an egg. 
He sends a man into a flooded compartment to fix a couple
of leaks which, if left unrepaired, would make the U-517
unable to discharge its torpedo against the hovering enemy
destroyer.  As the German depth charges go off, getting
closer and closer as the Americans perspire even more
freely, the submarine shakes and rocks, director Mostow 
capturing the reaction by jiggling the camera.
   "U-571" takes its place in a repertory of submarine dramas
including Tony Scott's "Crimson Tide," involving a power play
aboard a Navy nuclear submarine; Dick Powell's "The Enemy
Below," which even in 1957 had superior special effects; and
Robert Wise's "Run Silent Run Deep," pitting Clark Gable
against Burt Lancaster as a battle of wills between officers. 
The conflict between McConaughey's character, Andrew
Tyler, and those men who distrust his competence, is a
mirror image of its forerunners. Petersen's "Das Boot" stands
as the only drama supplying an inspiring combination of
human interest and dramatic and varied fighting scenes,
including one attack by the boat against a British caravan
heading through the straits of Gibraltar.  The acting in the
current film, however, is merely competent, the dialogue
humdrum, the direction without sufficient challenge.  Since
the radio on the pursuing German destroyer had been
demolished by a lucky shot and the Americans are unable to
use their own signal for fear of giving away their position, we
do get the feel of the vastness of the water as the submarine
and the destroyer play out their cat-and-mouse game as
though they housed the only human beings on the planet.
   For those who object to the falsification of history, note that
the true story is that in 1941 the British Navy's HMS Bulldog
snatched the Enigma from a German U-boat, while a Station
X in the English countryside performed the decoding.  This
truer version is described by Robert Harris in his novel,
"Enigma."

The submarine movie.  It seems like everybody thinks they can make a
successful one.  In the 90's, 'The Hunt for Red October' and 'Crimson Tide'
were among the most popular.  But the grand daddy of all submarine movies is
Wolfgang Petersen's 1982 masterpiece which re-defined the term
white-knuckler when describing motion pictures.  Academically efficient and
technically brilliant, director of photography Jost Vacano actually
developed (in an authentic submarine with cramped corners) a method that
allowed the camera to run from one submarine bay to another as smoothly as
if the camera were on a flat conveyor belt.  This is a feat that should have
won him an Oscar but instead the award was given to Billy Williams and
Ronnie Taylor for their easy and mostly outdoor filming of 'Gandhi'.  'The
Hunt for Red October' was a sly and extremely well written espionage film
that tied itself up a little too perfectly at the end but kept in the
tradition of Hollywood standards without ticking off the audience.  'Crimson
Tide' had the distinction of being a superbly acted film (it doesn't get
much better than Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington) with great sub woofer
capabilities on the home entertainment system.  The new millennium brings in
yet another movie about a war time machine they now name a sandwich and this
one has some pretty bland ingredients and some very large plot holes.
I also got the feeling that while watching this movie that someone behind
the camera actually lost a lot of games of Battleship. You remember that
Hasbro board game where people would exclaim "You sank my battleship!"  I
say this because the film is like a game of Battleship that someone wanted
to win very badly and the characters are largely portrayed as parts of a
pinball target, video game target or just about any other target you can
imagine in the name of combat.  'U-571' actually feels at times like
standing next to someone who has only emptied half of his roll of quarters
during the routine of playing a video game and you say, "Come on.  Hurry up.
Let's go!"....because you're so bored after a while.
The setting for 'U-571' is World War II.  Lt. Andrew Tyler (Matthew
McConaughey) and Lt. Commander Mike Dahlgren (Bill Paxton) are the lead
officers on a mission for the United States that will allow, in theory, for
a group of navy recruits and their officers to board a Nazi submarine, in
the disguise of fellow Nazis, and steal an encoding device which the Nazis
will protect at all costs.  This all goes smoothly for a while until a
clever Nazi crewman with binoculars spots the sabotage and all hell breaks
loose.  The Americans have to then fight their way aboard the submarine and
steal the device while fearing an attack from their own allies, managing the
vessel's incurred damage and looking after captured prisoners.
After the initial mayhem, the film becomes bogged down with repetitive
vacuums of action which are handled very well with a booming sound track of
refined detail but it all becomes tiresome before too long.  This truly
surprised me because director Jonathan Mostow mad a crackling and totally
authentic Hitchcock style thriller in 1997 entitled 'Breakdown' which showed
the intimacies and nightmares of violent crime and had believable
performances from its cast and filled the bill nicely for two hours.
Producer Dino De Laurentis, aside from standing behind Mostow on 'U-571'
also stood with him as producer of 'Breakdown' and it looks like a
compromise was reached where they agreed that one would have his way on one
picture and the other would have his way on the other because these two
films look completely different although they have the same director and
producer working on them.  Even if subject matter is completely different
from one project to the next, a film buff can spot the trademarks of an
established produced and director that makes all of their work seem similar.
The mix of collaborative efforts looks lost on 'U-571' but directors always
have a better eye for films than businessmen do any day of the week.  When
you go back to look at the career of De Laurentis, he has been involved with
some pretty dreadful movies including 'Conan the Barbarian', Conan the
Destroyer', 'Dune', 'Silver Bullet', 'Year of the Dragon' and 'Body of
Evidence'.  The last two being razzie award nominees for worst picture of
their respective years.
One thing that is mentioned at the end of the film are some of the other
missions that men in real time war have given sacrifice to.  This was a
pleasant thing to see.  Much in the same way that 'Star Trek IV: The Voyage
Home' paid tribute to the men and women of the Challenger disaster of the
way Oliver Stone paid tribute to the men who fought and died in the Vietnam
war with 'Platoon' and 'The Towering Inferno' dedicated its title to fire
fighters who gave their lives and the opening scene of 'Dirty Harry' shows a
wall of names depicting deceased police officers. 'U-571' would make a great
video game and it wouldn't surprise me in this age of marketing if one
actually comes out.
A film must receive a three star rating or higher to be eligible for a

The story tells of the United States' efforts to crack Nazi U-boats' 
communication codes during World War
II. To do so they must get an encoding device off a Nazi submarine without 
the rest of the German army
knowing they've done so. 
Matthew McConaughey stars as Lt. Andy Tyler, a sub-under-assistant Naval 
officer who thinks he could be
a leader and gets his wish when his crew's mission to get the encoder is 
botched and all hell breaks loose. 
The film presents an interesting and original plot when Tyler and his crew 
are stuck in a German sub and
must fight off another German sub and a destroyer ship while their own boat 
is falling apart. 
The action sequences are interesting at first but wear out quickly after the 
same scenarios keep repeating
and the individual conflicts and problems within the sub become so 
predictable and just plain fake. A good
premise hurt by poor direction.

 They sweat, strain and die under the banner of patriotism and prose so
purple it may make you blush.
 But "U-571" does have a sort of old-fashioned innocence to it, and in
its own corny way it is a fun outing.
 Set during World War II, the movie's plot revolves around the retrieval
of an Enigma code machine from a German U-boat. With this machine the
Allies will be able to decipher the secret German code and will be able
to intercept all their messages.
"U-571" is the type of movie in which one good guy torpedo sinks a
destroyer while 2 million Nazi depth charges cannot even put a dent in a
rust bucket, battle-scared submarine.
 OK, so "U-571" isn't history. It's a throwback to those lovable John
Wayne-Randolph Scott war movies in which We were the stalwart heroes and
They were the hissable villains.
 It's the kind of movie in which the black cook - without any formal
training - can man the controls of a German U-boat.
 It's a movie in which the firm, no-nonsense captain (Bill Paxton) gives
his executive officer a lecture about being hesitant to sacrifice men's
lives for the overall good, which - of course - foreshadows events to
come.
 Every situation is telegraphed, every character is stock.
 And the music by Richard Marvin tries to give the film an epic air, but
it only succeeds at assailing the eardrums.
 The claustrophobic feel of the U-boat was done much better in Wolfgang
Petersen's classic, "Das Boot". "U-571" is merely a pale copy.
 Matthew McConaughey is chiseled and determined as the lieutenant
suddenly thrust into command. Harvey Keitel is sagelike as the veteran
Navy chief who helps McConaughey's Lt. Andrew Tyler grow into command.
 The movie's main flaw: The main action piece takes place during a
stormy night, thus making it almost impossible to see who among the cast
lives and buys it for God and country.
 "U-571" is the type of film you drag your wife or girlfriend in
retaliation for being henpecked into taking her to see a weeper such as
"Random Hearts" or "The Horse Whisperer."
 "U-571" is pabulum, a no-brainer. It's merely an excuse to munch on
popcorn.

Das Boot is the Holy Grail of submarine movies.  It's so good that you
have to wonder why anyone would bother making a film about subs after
Boot was released in 1982.  You know, kind of like how Ben-Hur ruined
the whole `chariot race' genre for everyone else.  Granted, you'd be
better off spending your $20 for tickets and popcorn on the the
director's cut of Boot on DVD instead, but U-571 is still damn
entertaining.
Sure, it's as close to Boot as Mulholland Falls is to L.A. Confidential,
but U-571 is an edge-of-your-seat good time.  And who woulda thunk it,
coming from this bunch of `auteurs'?  Director Jonathan Mostow's only
previous mainstream directorial credit was 1997's reprehensible
Breakdown. Mostow penned the script with Breakdown cronie Sam Montgomery
and some other guy named David Ayer, a former Navy sonarman who had
never written a feature film.  The talent in front of the camera isn't
particularly awe-inspiring, either.  Matthew McConaughey?  Bill Paxton?
Not much brain activity there.  Harvey Keitel?  I only recently regained
my sight after seeing him in a dress and lipstick in Holy Smoke.  Jon
Bon Jovi?  Nuff said.
U-571's story isn't that fantastic, but it does offer the best cinematic
macguffin since `the Process' from David Mamet's The Spanish Prisoner.
The film is set in the Atlantic Ocean during the spring of 1942, where
German U-boats have their way with Allied ships while slowly approaching
the east coast of the United States.  The German's sea supremacy is
unmatched, partly due to the fact that the Allied Forces are unable to
decipher the transmissions that they intercept from their adversaries.
If the Allies could only get their hands on Germany's `Enigma' machine,
they could crack the code and possibly turn the tide of war to their
favor.
And that's just what U-571 is about.  The crew of a rickety, antiquated
Word War I submarine are ordered to disguise themselves as German
soldiers and take over a disabled sub stranded in the middle of the
Atlantic and capture the mysterious `Enigma' device.  The American sub,
skippered by Captain Dahlgren (Paxton, Mighty Joe Young), is even
doctored to look like a German U-boat, and a German-speaking officer
(Jake Weber, In Too Deep) and combat Marine (David Keith, A Family
Thing) are included in the mission.
Of course, the mission doesn't go exactly as planned, otherwise there
would be no movie.  The Americans end up aboard the German vessel, but
the ship is beyond repair.  To make matters worse, they can't read the
controls, they only have one torpedo remaining, and they insist on
keeping the German Captain (Thomas Kretschmann) aboard the ship as a
prisoner.  Gee, I wonder if he's going to break free at a really
dramatic moment in the film?
There are more predictable things in the film, mostly revolving around
McConaughey's (edTV) Lieutenant Andrew Tyler.  As the film opens, we
learn that he was passed over for promotion because Captain Dahlgren
says he doesn't possess the ability to sacrifice his own men if the
situation deems it necessary.  Gee, I wonder if Tyler will end up in
charge of the mission and have to sacrifice his own men?
Yet despite the predictability, lack of capable stars and weak script,
U-571 still succeeds.  The sound is remarkable, especially during scenes
where the sub is being pummeled by depth charges.  In fact, these scenes
are so well done that they jammed three of them into the film (the third
time was a little much).  The film, while not based on a true story, is
dedicated to the brave men that captured the `Enigma' machine, which was
apparently an actual device that truly did shift the balance of power in
the Atlantic over to the Allies.

When it comes to submarine movies, the last word will
probably always be director Wolfgang Petersen's 1982
thriller "Das Boot," the story of a World War II German
U-boat's many brushes with disaster during a particularly
perilous mission.
The shadow of Petersen's film hangs heavily over "U-571,"
in which Matthew McConaughey and a group of American
sailors try to evade the enemy after commandeering a Nazi
U-boat. In fact, one key scene - in which the sub has to
dive to a dangerously low level to avoid an oncoming
destroyer - figures prominently in both movies.
In terms of the filmmaking, there's really no point
comparing the two pictures. "Das Boot" has considerably
deeper characterizations, a much creepier mood and more
believable dialogue and relationships. There's not much
time devoted to human interest stories in "U-571," an
unpretentious, no-nonsense suspense film engineered to
provide two hours of excitement. It's not art, and it won't
get a theatrical re-release 20 years from now the way "Das
Boot" recently did. But on its own simple terms, it works
just fine.
The screenplay by Sam Montgomery fictionalizes a 1941
mission by the British navy to capture an Enigma, a
machine that would help the Allies break the secret codes
used by the Germans to send messages. In "U-571," the
time frame has been shifted to the spring of 1942, when
U.S. Navy Lt. Andy Tyler (McConaughey) and his
inexperienced crew are dispatched to a disabled U-boat to
retrieve an Enigma.
Despite the importance of the assignment, Tyler can't help
but be a little distracted as he prepares to leave for it; he
just lost the chance to command his own sub because his
captain (Bill Paxton) wouldn't give him a recommendation
because of Tyler's lack of self-confidence and leadership.
"You have to be able to make hard decisions based on
imperfect information," his commander tells Tyler. "If you're
not willing to make those decisions, without pause, without
reflection, you're not ready to be a submarine captain."
With that kind of a setup, it's a safe bet Tyler will soon be
called upon to display his true mettle. Indeed he is, as he
and several of his men are forced to take over the U-boat
after their own ship is destroyed. Director Jonathan
Mostow (who made the 1997 sleeper "Breakdown")
manages to work up a pretty potent atmosphere of tension
as the crew faces dangers ranging from a bombardment of
depth charges to internal problems stemming from
misreading the sub's instructions (which are, of course, in
German).
In keeping with such other contemporary looks back at
WWII such as "Saving Private Ryan," "U-571" does not
have a bunch of superheroes or archvillains at its center.
Instead, most of the guys feel underqualified for the work
they have to do and they sometimes question Tyler's
orders even while carrying them out. Erik Palladino (Dr.
Dave on "ER") plays the loudest voice of dissent, a pest
who tries to undermine Tyler's authority and finally gets a
sock in the jaw for his trouble.
In his first time out in an action film, McConaughey hits
the right notes of heroism, while Harvey Keitel as a veteran
sea dog and a hard-to-recognize Jon Bon Jovi offer effective
support.
The real stars of "U-571," however, are the special effects
(the subs look considerably more authentic than the ones
in "Das Boot"), Richard Marvin's panicky score and the
truly outstanding sound. This is one movie you really must
see in digital stereo to fully appreciate. The explosions, the
rushing water and the terrifying creaks of metal giving way
are so vivid you can practically feel them, and for many
people that's as good a reason to go to the movies as any.

U571 (M).  
(Universal/Studio Canal/Village Roadshow)
Director: Jonathan Mostow

David Keith, Jake Weber, Jack Noseworthy, Erik Palladino, Matthew Settle,
T C Carson, Thomas Guiry, Dave Power, Thomas Kretschmann, Derk Cheetwood
Running time: 112 minutes.
Das Boot without the subtitles?  All of the usual clichés
of the wartime submarine drama are trotted out one more time in this
big budget World War Two adventure from Jonathan Mostow (whose last
film was the Kurt Russell actioner Breakdown).  The surfeit of
clichés however doesn't diminish the excitement nor the
claustrophobic suspense that holds the audience's attention for the
duration.
          By 1942 Hitler's submarines were winning the war in the
Atlantic, due mainly to their unbreakable Enigma code.  The Allies
were desperate to get their hands on the top secret code and thus turn
the tide of war.  When a German submarine lies crippled in the
Atlantic, the US Navy seizes its chance.  Under the command of Bill
Paxton and a gung-ho marine (David Keith), a hastily assembled mission
is sent to board her, retrieve the German code machine and books, and
scuttle the boat.
When the American's own submarine is destroyed by a German
U-boat, the surviving members of the crew commandeer the crippled
U-boat.  They find themselves desperately trying to repair the broken
down U571 and steer her across a hostile ocean to safety in England.
Brash young commander Tyler (Matthew McConaughey) finds himself in
charge, trying to whip his small, inexperienced young crew into shape
under adverse conditions during the heat of battle.  Unfortunately,
there are a number of glitches in the film's plotting, but Mostow's
pacy and ruthlessly efficient direction manages to gloss over most of
them until the curtain closes.  Many may also object to the excessive
jingoism, in which Mostow suggests that the heroic efforts of American
soldiers and sailors were largely responsible for the capture of vital
German code books.
As with many war movies, the characters here are little more
than ciphers that serve the plot, and the audience finds it hard to
identify with them.  Mostow has assembled a strong cast, although many
of the big names are killed off within the first 45 minutes.
Performers of the calibre of McConaughey and Harvey Keitel do what
they can with their essentially one dimensional characters.
However, the film is certainly impressive in its staging of
the underwater battle scenes, and Mostow brings plenty of tension to
the film.  U571 deliberately resembles Wolfgang Petersen's classic
tale of war and heroism in both look and feel, although the potent
antiwar message is missing here.  Production designer Gotz Weidner
even worked on Das Boot.  The special effects and production design
are superb, and enhance the claustrophobic atmosphere.

     It's finally time to reassess the submarine movie to see if it's
outlived its useful life.  I was skeptical enough when Crimson Tide came
out in 1995, feeling like a knockoff of The Hunt for Red October, itself
an homage to Das Boot, it something of an homage to Run Silent, Run
Deep.  They even made Down Periscope, which four years of therapy have
not helped me to forget.
     U-571 takes the Das Boot path, starring a dozen of the sweatiest
men in Hollywood (the makeup department working overtime on this one),
all led by everyone's favorite naked bongo player, Matthew McConaughey.
Loosely based on real events, U-571 involves a WWII mission to capture a
German Enigma encryption device from a sinking German submarine adrift
in the middle of the Atlantic.  Skipper Bill Paxton and his 2nd in
charge McConaughey hop to the task, dressing up their wreck of a sub to
look just like a German U-boat.  One guy on the crew speaks German, so
there shouldn't be a problem in posing as a rescue ship, right?
     The recovery goes as planned but, uh-oh, the Germans catch them in
the act and sink the American sub.  McConaughey, with his commander
dead, decides to lead the surviving skeleton crew to take over the badly
damaged U-boat and try to escape the big bad Nazis on their tail.
     Just describing the plot gets me juiced about the action in U-571.
There are plenty of real thrills and enough Navy jargon to make any
war-happy moviegoer perk up in his seat.  Truly, U-571 is a fun movie,
much like Crimson Tide.  But... there is a catch.
     The problem is that U-571 is so overwhelmingly contrived that
suspension of disbelief is nearly impossible.  It's bad enough when we
see the Nazis shoot up a rowboat full of survivors because of "orders
from Der Fuhrer," just so we know it's okay to kill the Germans later in
the film.  But what of the later hushed conversation, when a grim-faced
officer proclaims that there must be no survivors if a dangerous plan
goes awry, because the Germans will torture them all without mercy?
Anything to get the audience on your side, huh?
     There's the usual "take the boat below the most remotely imaginable
depth" scene.  There's a prisoner to contend with.  There's all that
"down bubble" talk.  There are implorations to be silent.  The usual sub
clichés are all here, except they never "bottom 'er out on the ocean
floor."
     But the icing on the cake is when McConaughey and his crew are on
the run from the enormous destroyer, dropping dozens of depth charges,
shooting torpedoes, firing cannons... and nothing seems to hurt this
ship!  U-571 is apparently some kind of German superboat!  It's amazing
it was damaged in the first place!  Pretty soon, you'll probably grow
tired of watching explosion after explosion do absolutely nothing to the
sub, and then the thrills of U-571 will quickly fade.
     Sorry Hollywood, it's time to put the sub movie in dry dock.  At
least until the next World War.

Susan Granger's review of "U-571" (Universal Pictures)
   Brace yourself, the first popcorn picture of the season has
arrived! "U-571" has everything you could want in an
action-adventure. Set against the backdrop of World War II, when
Hitler launched a devastating U-boat assault against the Eastern
seaboard of the United States, it revolves around a daring mission to
capture an Enigma machine, a top-secret Nazi radio coding device. But
the crux of the story involves a young executive officer, played by
Matthew McConaughey, who proves his leadership ability in a crisis
situation when his submarine crew is deployed to answer the distress
call of a stranded German U-boat. Their assignment is to masquerade as
a resupply ship and, wearing German uniforms, board the damaged vessel
and seize its Enigma encrypting device. "Get the damned trophy and get
the hell outta there," orders the captain. But everything that can go
wrong does, as the cleverly constructed script poses several dilemmas
and one complication after another. Directed and co-written by
Jonathan Mostow ("Breakdown"), it's a taut, exciting tale of
historical fiction, a composite of actual events, not revisionist
history, which an important point which is made clear in the closing
credits. Matthew McConaughey shows remarkable emotional dimension,
ably supported by Harvey Keitel, Bill Paxton, David Keith, Jack
Noseworthy, Erik Palladino, Tom Guiry and Jon Bon Jovi. And
cinematographer Oliver Wood captures the claustrophobic emotional
stress of being in the path of deadly torpedoes and depth charges and,
even more terrifying, the helpless, eerie silence of expectation. On
the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "U-571" is an action-packed,
explosive 8.  If you're into ferociously suspenseful, high-tension
thrillers: go, go, go!

Back in the days of the "good war" the German Nazi war machine had an
unbreakable code generated by a device code named ENIGMA. Over the
course of about three years, Allied Forces managed to piece together
parts of the code,culminating with the capture of a complete machine in
1944. Having broken the code, Allied Command was forced to watch as the
other side continued to sink our ships, for getting word to those ships
would tip the Germans to the fact that we knew what they were thinking.
That's a story for another day, unlike the compressed story told by
writer/director Jonathan Mostow in U-571, is a superb thriller and a
great ride, once things in the story go from bad to worse.
Mostow sets his story in the Spring of 1942, with the US fresh into the
war and still running World War I era subs like the S-33, which will
never be captained by Lt. Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaughey) who has
been passed over for promotion. Tyler's hopes have been shot down by his
Lt. Commander Mike Dahlgren (Bill Paxton) and, before he can request
transfer to another boat, the S-33 ships out on a mission of utmost
secrecy and importance. It seems that Intelligence has tracked radio
signals from a floundering Nazi sub (and how that happened starts this
story in high gear) in the mid-Atlantic. The Germans have dispatched a
rescue sub; The S-33's mission is to get there first, waylay the crew
and steal the Enigma coding machine and code books. Best estimate is
that our side can get there ten hours before their side.
Nope. Nothing I've written spills anything that isn't in the trailer or
teevee spot, so don't complain. Let's just say that the nine Americans
who find themselves in control of a crippled, leaky U-boat must fight
the impossible fight against the full strength of a healthy Nazi Navy,
determined to send that Enigma machine to the depths. Among the American
crew (some will live and some won't) are Chief Klough (Harvey Keitel in
a low key, dead on dramatic performance), Lt. Peter Emmett (Jon Bon
Jovi), crewmen Mazzola (Erik Palladino) Wentz (Jack Noseworthy) and mess
steward Eddie (T.C. Carson) and Special Ops officers Lt. Hirsch (Jake
Weber) and Major Coonan (David Keith). German officer Kapitanlieutenant
Wassner (Thomas Kretschmann), a captive below decks plays a key role as
well.
We were taught in school of the "can do" effort of wartime America,
recovering from the almost complete destruction of the Pacific Fleet at
Pearl Harbor and Mostow's script, filled with depth charge and torpedo
battles and the decreasing odds for survival of our heroes, exploits
that spirit to the letter. His direction exploits the claustrophobic
conditions of the ship and the special effects run the gamut from bone
shaking to downright beautiful. I never thought I'd say that about a
depth charge going off, but you'll know the scene when you see it.
U-571 is a great popcorn flick, and while I usually use that term in a
deprecating fashion, I don't now. Outside of a short pause at the
beginning of the flick, catch your breath - you'll need it, U-571
doesn't stop. Not in its action, not to slow down and detail what
happened to the crewmen that don't make it. Put the popcorn hand on
autopilot and have a good time. 
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to U-571, he would have paid...

Starring Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton, Harvey Keitel, Jon Bon Jovi.
Directed by Jonathan Mostow. Rated PG-13.
Jonathan Mostow is a director with few pretensions. He knows what genre
he is working in -- so far it has been pure action -- and invests all
of his efforts in making the best damn genre movie possible. His first
two Hollywood projects, the Kurt Russell thriller Breakdown and now the
splendid submarine movie U-571 have both been rousingly successful in
doing one thing: generating pure, unadulterated suspense. The dialogue
is minimal, the characterization is purely perfunctory but with Mostow,
it doesn't seem to matter. I doubt anyone is going to accuse Mostow of
being the next Hitchcock, but I doubt he'll mind: he's too confident
and smart a director.
The film has one of my heretofore least favorite Hollywood actors earn
at least a little of my respect. Matthew McConaughey, whom I had given
up on a long time ago, plays Tyler, an executive officer in the Marines
who, in the beginning of the film (and in the middle of WWII), is
complaining to his superior (Bill Paxton) about his being refused his
own submarine to commandeer. Literally moments later, he gets his wish.
He and a varied group of Marines, some experienced and some not, are
being sent on a covert mission: to retrieve the Enigma, a machine that
would help the Allies decode secret messages that the Axis powers are
sending to each other. This involves pretending to be a Nazi submarine
to raid another one that is broken down at sea.
As the film's marketing campaign reveals, the operation does not go
smoothly. They retrieve the Enigma and are about to get back on their
sub and go home when it is blown up by torpedoes. McConaughey and Co.
are now stuck on an unfamiliar German submarine. Only one of them knows
how to read German and extensive repairs are necessary to get the sub
moving again. As if that wasn't enough, they also have a Nazi
battleship to contend with...
U-571 simulates the same creaky, dripping underwater atmosphere as did
Das Boot, the mother of all submarine movies, as well as The Abyss,
which went quite a bit deeper into the blue sea. There have been
others, but few done as well as this one. Not since Titanic has a
camera been so much a part of the action: it tirelessly chases after
the actors, sweeps around the cramped sets and goes in for terrifying
close-ups of the soldiers' wrenched faces. The film doesn't bother to
define interesting characters -- the people here are mostly just
composites of conventions from earlier films -- and yet we worry about
the people we see on the screen.
Mostow effectively uses silence to help the excitement along. I'm a
firm believer that a strong soundtrack can save an action movie but
moments when we hear nothing can be just as suspenseful as blaring
music. As Alfred Hitchcock said, it's not the bang that scares you,
it's the anticipation. When the aforementioned battleship starts
dropping charges in the water above the submarine, we hear the muffled
explosions get louder and louder. Before we know it, we're on the edge
of our seats awaiting the "Boom" that will send our beloved crew
members flying. We know it will happen but Mostow stages these scenes
so masterfully that we have fun simply waiting for it.
McConaughey, it seems, has finally found his niche. Much like Keanu
Reeves, the actor is most effective when the least is required from
him. There is no complexity to this role -- I don't even remember the
character's name -- and he shines in it. He doesn't have to emote much
and he manages to make his character sympathetic.
U-571 is frightening and claustrophobic and yet it is never cold or
unpleasant. Like he did in Breakdown, Mostow creates heroes we can root
for, puts them in a situation we can get interested in and then has
them solve the conflict at hand in spectacularly exciting ways.

U-571 [Mostow] -- To summarize Breakdown, Jonathan Mostow's previous
endeavor, I'd offer about sixty-seven synonyms for the words taut,
powerful, suspenseful, professional, so on, so forth. Or, to much more
magnify the apparent slump that he appears to be in, I offer The Game,
1997's best film, as far as I'm concerned, for which Mostow served as
executive producer. This, for the observant among you, however, is not
Breakdown -- nor, by a long shot, The Game. Very little of this one
works, thespians included. The plot is interesting, I suppose, but it's
execution is not. The action is tepid: in fact, some of it is laced with
such boredom that the exit sign appeared much more interesting than the
goings on screen.

An old-fashioned WW11 submarine movie made for men, featuring an
all-male cast, played with a square jawed military call for patriotism.
There are no jokes here, even though it could have used some to lighten
its torpedo load. Every move made in this film is seemingly life
threatening, whether on a personal basis or because of the action
scenes. But, aside from being as sober-minded as some of the classical
films of this genre-- such as Run Silent, Run Deep, this is no Wolfgang
Petersen's Das Boot (81), the only excellent submarine film ever made
thus far, but it is as thrilling and as contrived as the recent,
big-budgeted Crimson Tide. This makes for a fairly entertaining but
vacuous film, whose entertainment value, I estimate, to be in the
middle-range of this genre. If you get your sea legs under you and don't
mind the film's history being blurred and its insistence on making
heroes out of the men at all costs, then you should find it viscerally
challenging and not be underwhelmed by its clichés and its technical
inaccuracies, as noted by other observers with far greater submarine
technical knowledge than I have, who point out for example: You can't
start a diesel engine in a submerged submarine.
The film is set in the spring of 1942, when German U-boats in the North
Atlantic and along the East Coast of the U.S., were targeting allied
shipping. An allied vessel is downed by the Germans as the film opens,
with the bad guys, the Germans, at first exhilarated by their hit but
then taken aback when attacked by the depth charges hitting their boat,
causing severe damage. English subtitles appear for the first ten
minutes or so, as the Germans in distress speak only German, scurrying
around in their claustrophobic confines, trying to repair their almost
unfixable boat. The next move they make is to radio Berlin and get a
boat to resupply them.
The scene switches to the good guys, the American sailors, who are on
shore leave, celebrating together with a big bash. Andy Tyler (Matthew
McConaughey) is the second-in-command and is saddened, he has just
received the news that he was passed over for captain. His hard-nosed
commanding officer Dahlgren (Bill Paxton) refuses to recommend him for
promotion, as he doesn't believe Tyler has the right stuff to lead the
men by making the hard decisions that are necessary without feeling
sorry for them. The stern-looking Andy, contrary to his appearance and
tight-lipped nature, is just too friendly with the crew and even though
he's very competent and ambitious, he is told that his time hasn't come
yet. Predictably, you can figure out where the film is going with this
subplot!
Shore leave is suddenly cancelled and this gives the film an opportunity
to introduce some of the standard main characters always found in films
like this, such as the loyal old-timer, Chief Klough (Keitel), who can't
wait for some action, and all the green sailors worried about their
first war assignment, as the men stand in the rain by the dock watching
their submarine being equipped anew. They are about to find out that
they are going out to sea disguised as a German supply ship to
rendezvous with the stranded German U-boat and take from it an Enigma
code machine (a classified-secret encoding device resembling a
typewriter). The mission calls for them to get onboard and steal the
Enigma machine without the enemy knowing it is missing. This machine is
so important, that it is more valued than their lives, being that it can
shorten the war once gotten undetected into allied hands. The machine
allows the Germans to relay positions of Allied shipping on the
Atlantic. This fictionalized version varies greatly from the historical
records, where the British actually carried out this assignment in 1941,
a year before America was to enter the war, and this one episode is an
amalgam of several such episodes. In actuality, the British Navy's HMS
Bulldog grabbed the Enigma from a German U-boat while a Station X in the
English countryside performed the decoding. This matter is detailed in
Robert Harris' novel Enigma.
The most action-packed scene comes about in the dark and in the rain at
the renedezvous, as the Americans and the Germans on the U-boat go at
it. The action is tense but hard to see what's clearly taking place, as
death is happening quickly and each side looks like the other in the
dark. As an added kicker the American's ship is blown up by the German
supply ship coming on the scene earlier than expected, which causes most
of the sailors we just met, such as the Bon Jovi character and the
marine major (Keith) who trained them, to be killed off. We are left
with a handful of American survivors retreating back to the compromised
German submarine, who will have to battle it out with the powerful
German boat standing in its way. Andy will be in charge, as the captain
was killed, but Andy will have the chief and his years of experience to
counsel him if necessary. The chief will give him his unswerving support
and the men will learn to respect him as the one giving the orders now.
We are on familiar territory here, with one more bit of melodrama, if
Andy fails to succeed, he can't let his men live, the reason being that
the Germans must not know that their secret coding system has been
stolen, and that the men would be unmercifully tortured if taken alive.
The film has almost every expected submarine battle scene ever presented
take place. It is directed with emphasis on sustaining suspense,
building on the action scenes, and letting go full force with its
special effects, making for a solid and exciting effort. Though, to its
down side, character development is the first casuality in this war
film- it simply is not a top priority of the director for this nut-and-
bolts actioner. The same could be said for dialogue, which consists
mainly of drab submarine lingo.
Matthew McConaughey must carry this film and he does, as a tight-lipped
career sailor who becomes the Man under trying circumstances, who
convincingly becomes the hero overnight, giving the public what it
wants. But I don't think this film has that something special that
sometimes makes these easy-to-watch films into blockbusters. But it
should do a brisk business in the box office, anyway. It is a film
geared for the unthinking man that is well-crafted and impressive in
carrying out its purpose to be about those who are efficient at doing
their job and don't question orders. It's a change of pace from a lot of
the current war films and a throwback to those old WW11 genre films,
with perhaps, a new audience ready to take that leap back in time, and
maybe, even an old audience, coming back to see a war that counted for
something, at a time when values were much different, a time when such a
full-scale war can be remembered fondly by an older generation, who know
the price that was paid for the war effort by the loss of lives it cost.

How much impact the Second World War has on contemporary culture is visible 
in Jonathan Mostow's story of submarine warfare, U-571.
I can remember watching films as a child, films like THE LONGEST DAY, THE 
BATTLE OF THE BULGE, PATTON and countless others;  always, as in episodes of 
THE TWILIGHT  ZONE, the Nazis were demonized, and the Allies were  
victorious.
Well, in U-571, this formula is touch-and-go:  we don't know immediately if 
the American crew will be successful in raiding a stranded German sub; 
further, we don't know if they will survive at all when their S-class 
American submarine is torpedoed by yet another U-boat, forcing the handful 
of sailors to retreat into the German vessel that they were about to 
scuttle.
Perhaps what causes the story to float is the blend of a solid  though 
fictionalized  story, with a script that goes out of its way to avoid 
clichés.  What's bound to happen in any story set aboard a sub does happen  
the claustrophobic sets, the spraying water and floods, and even the popping 
rivets (or seals) a la DAS BOOT.  Similar to Hitchcock's LIFEBOAT, it turns 
out they bring aboard a German saboteur.   Otherwise, this new treatment 
makes a very plausible effort to speed along the plot with originality and a 
few scenes of fine acting.
Largely a part of the background, the premise follows the crew's efforts at 
capturing an `Enigma' encoding machine, a device that was enabling the 
German Navy to run roughshod over the Allied forces in the early years of 
the war.  In fact, the American involvement in this particular treatment has 
drawn protest  as it was the British who mounted an astounding and 
ultimately successful effort at capturing the machines and breaking the 
code.  Of course the real aim of U-571 is to thrill the audience, not to 
explain the finer points of history.
The finest performance available here is the Chief  the military equivalent 
of a foreman on a construction job  who is played by Harvey Keitel.  With 
his blooming nose and stubbly mustache, Chief Klough helps to hold the story 
together.  He has been at this type of warfare since the Great War  when he 
apparently worked aboard this same, now crumbling class of American sub 
(that is, the S-boat destroyed less than half-way into the narrative, a 
gutsy twist).  Mixing unquestionable loyalty with uncanny intuition, the 
Chief excels at running the ship and at giving advice to the officer in 
command, Lieutenant Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaughey).  To put a spin on a 
line spoken by Keitel, this actor is welcome to play in any movie I pay to 
see.
Other outstanding performances are turned in by rock artist Jon Bon Jovi and 
Jake Walker  the two Americans fluent in German.  Walker, as Lt. Hirsch, is 
at first touted as the key to the mission; later he actually freezes when 
German sailors are shouting greetings to the American boarding party.  
Walker is clearly good at playing multi-dimensional characters.
Matthew McConaughey has a harder time convincing us and gaining our 
sympathy.  Tyler has a problem with not having received his own captaincy  
blown out of the water, as it were, by his own skipper, Captain Dahlgren 
(Bill Paxton, another actor often challenged by the prospect of acting with 
believable naturalness).  McConaughey often plays well off the characters 
around him, though he seems to try too hard during particularly stressful 
scenes.
A subtle and engaging effect occurs when U-571 is being attacked by depth 
charges.  The hull of the submarine bows under the great pressure, but does 
not implode.  Other effects include several exploding vessels;  most of 
these detonations are convincing, but occasionally we see the blur of fake-y 
motion, just at the edges of the action.  Computer generation has come a 
heck of a long way, but has not reached it final destination.
Fifty-five years after the war ended, Hollywood producers are still backing 
projects that highlight its battles, famous or not.  A couple of years ago 
we watched SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and THE THIN RED LINE.  No doubt we will see 
more, but why?  Yes, there are repetitions of the rhetoric we have heard 
before: it was the last great and honest war, the American army was the most 
awesome war machine ever assembled, never was there a more noble effort to 
preserve democracy.  But these narratives make just good stories, too.  
Granted, they are stories of the hunt, stories involving aggression and 
weaponry;  but they are also the embodiment of values so many viewers hold 
important.  War stories have always sold, and World War Two stories will 
continue to hold our interest.
As I write this review, I am watching Roger Ebert and this week's co-host 
(fellow `Tribune' employee Richard Roeper), both of whom are panning U-571.  
Although I do see some of what they are speaking, I still have to recommend 
the film for its engaging pace spurts of originality.  Not as well-made as 
DAS BOOT, U-571 nevertheless undertakes a tough task  sustaining a story in 
a microcosm of society at war.  And it is a good watch for the time it 
takes.

Hollywood can be awfully patriotic at times. It may not seem that way, with
movies like "Three Kings" and "Platoon" making the US look like a villainous
bully; but Hollywood gets particularly patriotic when making WWII movies
like "Patton" and "Saving Private Ryan". You can now add Jonathan Mostow's
("Breakdown") "U-571" to that list of red blooded, gung-ho, fight till we
die, all American movies. The good guys are pristine and courageous, while
the bad guys are evil, faceless terrors from Germany (where all evil,
faceless terrors come from). "U-571" may be the sort of brainless but
uplifting movie that will never stand the test of time like the far superior
"Das Boot" and "The Hunt for Red October"; however, one can't blame the
movie for being brainless as this film's only purposes are to get your pulse
pounding and your spirit soaring. It succeeds admirably on both counts.
It's the middle of WWII, and the Allied forces are getting pasted in the
Atlantic due to a German code they have been unable to crack. Captain
Dahlgren (Bill Paxton, in what amounts to little more than a cameo) has been
assigned to lead a submarine crew, while posing as a German resupply ship,
to a stranded German sub, and steal their code book. His first officer, Lt.
Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaughey), has just been turned down for a
promotion because Dahlgren doesn't believe he is ready for the strains of
command. The crew carries out its mission only to have their ship sunk by
the real resupply ship. Lt. Tyler now finds himself in command of the
captured German sub. He has only a handful of raw cadets and one grizzled
old sea dog (Harvey Keitel) to help him get the code book back to Allied
soil before the German fleet discovers what they have stolen.
Like I said, "U-571" is mindless entertainment at its best; as a result, the
dialogue sounds a bit forced at times and the events depicted are more than
a little implausible (and quite historically inaccurate). Those few flaws
aside, this movie is a blast. The set designs for the insides of WWII
submarines are remarkably accurate and are dark and dank like a submarine
interior should be. As in all submarine movies, the ability to properly
convey the feelings of claustrophobia and dread experienced by the submarine
crew is very important. Jonathan Mostow writes these emotions into his
characters perfectly. As for the score by Richad Marvin ("Breakdown"), it is
as rousing and patriotic as the movie itself (I'm surprised they didn't have
American flags hanging from the ceiling in the theater).
Unfortunately, the acting in the movie isn't quite up to par. I'm not sure
if this is a result of the rather cheesy dialogue; but whatever the reason
it does at times hinder the film. Matthew McConaughey ("Cutthroat Island")
gives the movie's worst performance. I think this is because he never quite
finds his footing playing his character. Lt. Tyler switches from being
unsure of himself and his crewmen, to being a great submarine captain in the
blink of an eye and then suddenly back again. Bill Paxton ("Titanic", "A
Simple Plan") is given a bit part, which is somewhat confusing as he is
possibly the most recognized name on the cast list. The remainder of the
supporting cast is adequate at best, with the only exception being Harvey
Keitel ("Reservoir Dogs", "Pulp Fiction"). Keitel is perfect as the veteran
of the submarine crew, getting such wonderful lines as "You're the Captain
now, and that means you have to know everything whether you actually do or
not."
The high point of the story comes shortly after the crew begin making their
escape in the captured submarine and are discovered by a German destroyer.
The two play cat and mouse through the Atlantic, with the sub staying as
deep as possible while the destroyer drops depth charges. These scenes do an
excellent job of displaying the fear felt by the submarine crew as the
explosions come closer and closer and the sub shakes more and more. "U-571"
has only one other flaw, which is that it does take awhile to really get
going. The nice thing is that once it finds its footing it's a heck of a
ride. The movie runs a respectable 118 minutes, though a little trimming at
the film's start wouldn't have hurt. I'd recommend it to fans of WWII
movies, and especially to fans of "Das Boot" and give the film three and a
half out of five stars. Now if you'll excuse me, I feel like singing "The
Star Spangled Banner" or buying a flag or something.

One of the turning points in World War II came when we captured a German
Enigma coding machine.  This device, the Germans believed, made their
codes uncrackable.  Once we had the machine without the German's
knowledge, we were able to break their codes without their being the
wiser. By being able to read the German's secret orders to their subs,
we were finally able to win the Battle of the Atlantic, thus allowing us
to supply our troops in Europe.
U-571 tells a stirring tale of submarine warfare, inspired by these true
events.  Even though the picture may be criticized for being a
fictionalized composite of various events, it's probably closer to the
truth than many films that claim to be true stories.  Regardless of
this, it is most certainly an exhilarating and satisfying thriller that
will have you on the edge of your seat once the battles begin.
The movie's only serious flaw is that director Jonathan Mostow
(BREAKDOWN), who shares the writing credits with Sam Montgomery and
David Ayer, lets his movie drift at first as he takes too long setting
up the plot.  But, after the movie finds its sea legs, you won't have
time to catch your breath in this first action movie of the summer.
(Okay, I know it's only spring, but this film, with it's realistic
battle sequences, is a big budget, summer thriller even if it arrives in
port a bit early.)
The plan is to outfit an American sub and crew to look German.  This
boat will rendezvous with a stranded German sub, and before they know
what hit them, the Americans will storm the sub and steal their Enigma.
They will then scuttle the German sub so that the Germans don't know
that we have their translating machine.  This simple plan goes seriously
awry, setting up a wonderful, classic war sequence that takes place
mainly underwater in a sub as it is being attacked.  The tension is
palpable, causing your adrenaline to pump like crazy.
As Captain Dahlgren, Bill Paxton gives the movie's only wooden
performance, arguably because of his stilted dialog.  ("Relax Gentlemen,
she's old but she'll hold," he reassures the others about their fake
German sub.)  His XO is played by the film's star, Matthew McConaughey,
who turns in one of his most convincing pieces of acting, eschewing his
tendency to superciliousness (AMISTAD, for example).  Harvey Keitel
plays the wise old Chief who guides his XO on how best to command.
The rest of the ensemble cast (Jon Bon Jovi, Jake Weber, Erik Palladino,
Matthew Settle, David Keith, T.C. Carson, Derk Cheetwood, Will Estes,
Tom Guiry, Jack Noseworthy and Dave Power) work as well together as a
crew would at sea.
If there is one part of the movie that best captures the film's essence,
it is the realistically frightening depth charge scenes.  Imagine being
a couple of hundred feet under water as the enemy above you drops drum
after drum of explosives at you.  An imaginative captain can help, but
basically you have to wait and pray that they will miss you.
One of the few unabashedly patriotic movies in some time, U-571 pays
homage to our brave soldiers who fought and died in a world at war.  And
it lets you vicariously feel some of their trauma as they wonder if each
moment will be their last.
U-571 runs 1:56.  It is rated PG-13 for war violence and would be fine
for kids around 12 and up.
