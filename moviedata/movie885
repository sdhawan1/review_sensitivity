Walt Disney / 1:33 / 1999 / PG (bawdy humor, brief nudity)
Cast: Jeff Daniels; Christopher Lloyd; Elizabeth Hurley; Daryl Hannah;
Wallace Shawn; Ray Walston; Michael Lerner; Christine Ebersole
Director: Donald Petrie
Screenplay: Sherri Stoner; Deanna Oliver
As if last spring's big-screen version of "Lost in Space" didn't scream,
"Danger, movie-goers! Danger!", here's yet another unnecessary updating
of a beloved 1960s TV chestnut. Martian the sitcom ran from '63 through
'66 and featured wacky Ray Walston as an extraterrestrial living amongst
earthlings in human disguise; "Martian" the movie runs 93 minutes and
gives equally wacky Christopher Lloyd the Walston role, though Walston
himself does show up in a supporting turn that eventually pays heed to
the his former self.
That in-joke will be lost on kiddies, but they'll probably be content
enough with the film's potty humor, lively pace and fun special effects.
Adults, on the other hand, may only enjoy "My Favorite Martian" if they
were fans of its original incarnation, or if they don't mind gazing at
pretty female co-stars Darryl Hannah and Elizabeth Hurley (though both
are arguably miscast). The story - Lloyd's "Uncle Martin" crashes in
Santa Barbara and is taken under the wing of a harried television
producer (Jeff Daniels in the Bill Bixby part) - accomplishes pretty
much what the series did in just its pilot and finale, albeit with far
better production values, moments of lavish lunacy (like a cool
climactic alien rampage) and computer-generated antennae.
There's some decent physical shtick here, and even a few chuckle-worthy
moments, but most of the comedy is provided by a talking, gyrating space
uniform named Zoot (brought to, uh, life by the voice of "Seinfeld"'s
Wayne Knight). This Zoot suit is no riot, and neither, unfortunately, is
too much of "My Favorite Martian."

Based on the 1964 TV series of the same name, My Favorite Martian is a
light-hearted silly movie aimed at showing kids a good time. Disney makes no
serious attempts to keep this film reasonable from an adult perspective.
Rather, they spend all their time in the silly fun department going for the
juvenile chuckle in a Herbie, the Love Bug kind of way. And by Joe, I think
they got it.
"You are a brilliant quasar in my black hole of a day." A pleasant enough
complement from a quirky Martian. Though he's generally jolly, Uncle Martin
(his Earth title) is vulnerable to bouts of depression which cause him to
literally fall apart (as in -- at the major joints).
Our favorite Martian (Christopher Lloyd, of course) crashes to Earth just
yards from news producer Tim O'Hara (Jeff Daniels) who inadvertently ends up
housing the alien. The two are forced to bear with each other until "Uncle
Martin" can get the ship up and running. Tim attempts to document this huge
news story, but is plagued with moments of compassion toward the odd fella's
safety. The "way way over the top" government investigator played
hysterically by Wallace Shawn accuses beautiful-but-simple newscaster Brace
(Hurley) of hosting the alien in her body, "So if you're not really a
Martian ... do you have any idea how alien DNA got on your cigarette?"
Ray Walston (TV's original Favorite Martian) pops into the picture as well
(greeted by a bit of an applause in the screening I attended). If you're
curious or nostalgic and you've got kids ... treat them to this movie.
Starring Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniels, Daryl Hannah and Elizabeth Hurley.
Directed by Donald Petrie. Rated PG.

Films like "Shakespeare in Love", "Elizabeth" and
"The Thin Red Line" are currently playing in theatres.
The Academy Award season is usually the best time
to go to the movies, as the studios hope to capitalize
on the resulting publicity of the nominees.  But with
all these fine films playing, I went to see
"My Favorite Martian".  I have an excuse: my wife
wanted to see it, and with Valentine's Day approaching,
I needed brownie points.
Having wasted ninety minutes of my life watching this
bad-but-not-truly-awful attempted comedy, I now must
further waste time writing a review.  The pen may
not be mightier than the sword, but at least I can
get some sort of revenge on Disney studios with
my review.
Is there anything nice that can be said about
"My Favorite Martian"?  There is an entertaining chase
scene involving a spaceship, a sewer tunnel, and a
roto-rooter.  There might be three good jokes
for those with great patience and forgiving natures.
Elizabeth Hurley is very attractive and has nice legs.
She also overacts, but perhaps the director can
be blamed for this.  There is a silly silver suit that
talks (think "Roger Rabbit".  Whatever happened to Roger,
anyway?).  I was indifferent to the suit's antics, but
the kids in the theater loved it.  If, God help us,
there is a sequel, expect the silver suit to have a
leading role.
Hollywood is determined to make a movie version of
every 60s television series, no matter its quality.
When will they get around to 'Green Acres', with
Dustin Hoffman replacing Eddie Albert and Fran Drescher
replacing Eva Gabor?  And who will play Arnold the pig?
While the World ponders this momentous casting
decision, I guess that I had better say something
about the film I am supposed to be reviewing.
A plot summary is overdue.  Jeff Daniels is a struggling
reporter, who wants selfish daddy's girl Hurley,
instead of Darryl Hannah who wants him.  Daniels gets
a scoop opportunity when a Martian (Christopher Lloyd,
with his usual goofy mad scientist schtick) lands and
kidnaps him.  Like in "Starman", Fed agents pick up
the trail, led by obnoxious character actor Wallace Shawn.
Daniels does better than expected. Hannah needs better
costumes. Ray Walston has the requisite cameo to provide
a link to the original series.  Lloyd makes goofy faces.
Ten year old kids will enjoy the movie more than their
escorting parents.  Enough said.

   "My Favorite Martian" is based on the TV series of the
same name and it looks it.  Loaded with banal one-liners that
brought laughs to neither the critics nor the small fry in the
audience, the picture depends for its appeal on visual effects
and a story about a friendship between two people from
different worlds.  The effects, however grand, are ugly, unless
you go for Monty-Python style graphics about a man who at
one point says "I'm coming apart" and then literally does. 
And it would be a stretch to interpret the friendship between
an emerald-green Martian and an Irish-American as a
metaphor for the idea that we can learn to live together
happily with people who look different from us and act in
ways we consider strange.  At one point, director Donald
Petrie reaches for the E.T. factor, hoping perhaps that the
audience would sympathize with a dying Martian whom the
doctors have given up trying to save, but don't think of selling
your Kleenex stock yet: tissue usage is not about to increase.
   When Tim O'Hara (Jeff Daniels), a reporter looking to
impress his boss with a big story, accidentally falls into what
could be the scoop of the century, he is dismayed to discover
that a just-landed Martian (Christopher Lloyd) is determined
to keep his identity secret.  Converting himself from the
standard Martian look to a human countenance, the visitor
sets about exploring the culture of the planet Earth, which he
and his people have always considered a center of
barbarism.  Believing himself to be bereft of human-style
feeling, he is surprised by his reaction to several women,
including Tim's TV-reporter girl friend Brace Channing
(Elizabeth Hurley), TV crew member Lizzie (Daryl Hannah)
and Tim's landlady Mrs. Brown (Christine Ebersole).  
   As the budding rapport of the two men evolves into pure
camaraderie, the two ride through events which are milked
for comic potential.  In one situation Martin takes on Tim's
identity and explores the nature of kissing with one of the
lovely women, and in a final change of identity he becomes
the gorgeous Brace Channing, delivering a comic newscast
designed to keep his secret identity secure.    Since the folks
who make movies for the little ones are convinced that a
vulgar situation or two can't hurt, director Petrie exploits a
ride that Martin and Tim take through a sewer, pursued by a
Roto-Rooter in the hands of villainous scientists led by Dr.
Coleye (character actor Wallace Shawn).  Believing they are
home free, they discover they are submerged just under the
toilet seat of a man who asks for his Field and Stream
magazine and complains that he shouldn't have had that
fourth burrito.
   Special effects are imposing but nothing that we haven't
seen before in the Mars-attacks genre.  The showstealer is a
suit named Zoot (played by "himself"), an empty uniform that
feels abandoned when its owner discards it for something
more in line with the Santa Barbara style.  The only gag
subtle enough to appeal to adults, one that you'll miss if you
blink, displays Lizzie leaning back at the studio reading a
copy of "Men are from Mars."  On the whole, "My Favorite
Martian" is an Unimpressive Flying Object.

MY FAVORITE MARTIAN
(Disney)
Starring:  Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniels, Elizabeth Hurley, Daryl
Hannah, Wallace Shawn, Christine Ebersole, Michael Lerner, Ray Walston.
Screenplay:  Sherri Stoner & Deanna Oliver.
Producers:  Robert Shapiro & Jerry Leider and Mark Toberoff.

MPAA Rating:  PG (profanity, adult humor)
Running Time:  93 minutes.

     Suggestive references to "balls" and "nuts."  To breasts.  To giving
"the finger."  To getting into someone's pants.  To catching one's
genitalia in one's zipper.  To contraception.  To virginity.  Two
references to urination.  A flatulence gag.  A couple of belches.  And a
toilet's-eye-view of a fat guy's rear end as he bemoans eating that last
burrito.  
     Welcome, friends, to the Wonderful World of Disney.
     In MY FAVORITE MARTIAN, we discover that there is intelligent life in
our solar system, and that absolutely none of it was involved in making
this film.  Continuing its impressive string of stupid and vulgar live
action films, Disney this time recycles the 1960s television series which
starred Bill Bixby and Ray Walston.  Jeff Daniels stars here as Tim
O'Hara, a somewhat socially inept television news producer; Christopher
Lloyd is a Martian who crash-lands and poses as Tim's Uncle Martin while
trying to repair his ship.  Along the way there are plenty of crazy
misunderstandings and near-discoveries, including the suspicion by Tim's
faithful camerawoman Lizzie (Daryl Hannah) that he has the hots for her,
and the attempt by ambitious reporter Brace Channing (Elizabeth Hurley) to
break the story of a close encounter.
     Not surprisingly, MY FAVORITE MARTIAN essentially consists of a
series of scenes which present the opportunity to show off special
effects.  Martin is able to appear in human form through the use of a
special gum, which also has unique effects on humans.  He has a sentient,
wise-cracking spacesuit called Zoot (uncredited voice by "Seinfeld's"
Wayne Knight) which does kooky things like pitching woo to a dress.  He
uses a "molecular condenser" to shrink objects like his space ship and
Tim's Plymouth (don't even bother with scientific curiosities like why a
"molecular condenser" also changes the weight of the object).  When
Martin gets upset, his body parts fall off.  And viewers who enjoy that
sort of thing -- and don't have trouble with the ridiculous notion of
Daryl Hannah as a wallflower -- will giggle blithely along.
     Trouble is, most of those will be kids.  Yes, MY FAVORITE MARTIAN
sports a PG rating, which clearly states that "some material may not be
suitable for children," but let's get serious here.  Disney has turned the
company name into a license to print money for "family entertainment,"
which used to mean something a parent wouldn't be embarrassed to take a
kid to see.  Take a look at that list in the first paragraph above and you
decide.  This is filmmaking not for children, but for idiots of all ages,
pandering with a sense of impunity because they haven't exactly gone broke
in the last couple of years by doing so.  In a late scene, when Tim is
admonished that humans should do something "about the oceans...and
afternoon talk shows," the hypocrisy of this film holding _anything_ up to
ridicule for its stupidity or offensiveness nearly burst a large vein in
my forehead.  How sad to see appealing comic performers like Lloyd
(regurgitating bits from BACK TO THE FUTURE) and Wallace Shawn (as nasty
government scientist Dr. Elliot Coleye...e. coli, get it?) floundering in
a mess like this.  How much sadder still that people will pay to see it.
     There are maybe two harmless visual gags that work in MY FAVORITE
MARTIAN, and perhaps that many examples of real wit in the script.  I
liked the fact that Martin's molecular condenser makes a sound remarkably
similar to R2-D2 when he's shot by the Jawas in STAR WARS; the absurd
parallel to E.T.'s revival also made me chuckle.  Mostly I sat in stony,
angry silence as this aggressively brainless film dribbled towards a
sequel-ready conclusion, tallying up the ways it treated viewers like
pre-schoolers who laugh hysterically when they shout "doody-head" at each
other.  Remember that list next time you trust Disney's name to mean
anything but mass-market infantilism.

Anyone over the age of thirty remembers the television show, My Favorite
Martian which starred Bill Bixby and Ray Walston.  This movie is NOT a
remake of that series.  It takes place today and several changes have been
made to our Martian friends.  The biggest difference is that our new
Martian is not alone.  A silvery suit that walks and talks on its own
accompanies him.  It also has amazing powers.
A television producer/reporter named Tim O'Hara [Jeff Daniels] works with
an on-air reporter, Brace Channing [Elizabeth Hurley] whose father is
O'Hara's boss.  Another co-worker is Lizzie [Daryl Hannah].  One night,
while driving back from an assignment O'Hara sees a mysterious object
descend from the sky and come to a stop on the beach alongside him.  The
alien, who later becomes known as Uncle Martin [Christopher Lloyd], has
the ability to shrink the spaceship to the size of a toy. 
Most of the film is comprised of the ridiculous situations that an alien
encounters on earth.  The buckle on Suit's belt contains chewing gum balls
that allow the chewer to take on the characteristics of a specific planet.
Uncle Martin, who has three eyes, four arms, and such, upon landing,
chews the Earth gum. The plot is filled with dirty' kid-type humor, such
as the suit' mooning people, talk of US astronauts wetting' in their
suits, the purchase of a pooper scooper', etc.   There are some attempts
at clever writing, but it falls short.  For example, the scientist's name
is Dr. E. Coli.   The Hawaiian Tropics Senior' competition offered humor
that never materialized.  It is nice to see Ray Walston in familiar'
surroundings.
The movie is totally ridiculous, but it's harmless.  We took our
9-year-old grandson with us.  He loved it, and we enjoyed it.  It will
never make screen history, but it's worth seeing.  I give it a C+.

_My_Favorite_Martian_ (PG) no stars (out of ****)
Grab a thesaurus.  Look up the word "bad."  See those words listed?  There
you have my review of the absolutely atrocious screen version of the 1960s
TV sitcom.  The Martian in question (Christopher Lloyd) becomes the
"favorite" of TV news producer Tim O'Hara, who reluctantly allows the alien
(who passes himself off as Tim's "Uncle Martin") and his living, talking
space suit to live with him as they repair their damaged spaceship.
Certainly some suspension of disbelief is in order, but there was one thing
that kept on bugging me while watching this film: just where exactly was
the Martian heading if he didn't want to land on earth?  It makes no sense.
Not that sense should be the priority of director Donald Petrie and
writers Sherri Stoner and Deanna Oliver--their main concern should be
laughs.  But there are none to be had in this tedious turkey, which uses a
lot of admittedly diverting (but not diverting _enough_) effects work in a
futile attempt to hide the 
clunkiness of the script and, worst of all, the performances.  Lloyd is
insufferably obnoxious and smug; Daniels is a complete blank; Daryl Hannah
(as Daniels's devoted camera operator) is even worse.  But as bad as they
are, they don't come close to the abysmal, forced work of Elizabeth Hurley.
 She's a born straightwoman, yet she's called on to actually _be_ funny as
bitchy reporter Brace Channing--and she has no clue _how_, showing no sense
of comic timing whatsoever.  It's not a pretty sight---a statement that can
be applied to the entire waste of celluloid that is _My_Favorite_Martian_.

        Whoever thought to cast Christopher Lloyd as the alien in
Disney's new remake of "My Favorite Martian" is to be commended, as
he tends to look like he's just visiting this planet to begin with.
Lloyd's unusual face and voice make him perfect for the role of
"Uncle Martin," a friendly extraterrestrial who finds himself
stranded on Earth after a spaceship crash.
        Donald Petrie's remake of the '60s television series is
agreeable enough, I suppose: it's bright, zany, and smart enough to
reinvent the characters for the 1990s, rather than locking them into
a 1960s mentality (as in the recent "Brady Bunch" films).  There's
a lot of action and humor which borders on the surreal (watch as Jeff
Daniels and Daryl Hannah try Martian gum for the first time), but
unfortunately that doesn't stop the movie from following a routine
storyline which culminates in an unnecessary (and distracting)
romance.
        Tim O'Hara (Jeff Daniels) is an unsuccessful TV producer
who works for a local news program.  Although Tim rarely gets to
cover the big stories, he finds one when he observes a crashing
spaceship.  Tim eventually befriends the alien inside, an
excitable but friendly creature he christens Uncle Martin.
        Martin is quite a character.  Able to control gravity and
change his shape, the curious alien enjoys learning about Earth
culture from his new friend.  One of his favorite Earth delicacies
is ice cream, which for Martin has an effect similar to alcohol.
(You'd think the first ice cream hangover would teach him a
lesson, but no.)  Martin and Tim also debate whether Earth or
Martian culture is superior:
        You know you're watching a Disney film when an article
of clothing becomes one of the most memorable characters.  Martin's
spacesuit, Zoot, is animate, loves to talk, and has a personality
more concretely defined than any of the human characters.  This is
a good idea in theory, but Zoot is so unique that everyone else
seems much less interesting by comparison, including Martin
himself.
        Daryl Hannah, for example, is basically wasted in the role
of Lizzie, Tim's friend and co-worker.  She's here only to be the
requisite love interest, and to help Tim and Martin escape from
one particularly nasty situation they later find themselves in (a
trick she accomplishes with the help of the aforementioned
Martian gum).  Although she gets a lot of screen time, Lizzie is
unfortunately never allowed to be anything more than a plot point.
(Why is it that no one is ever in a happy relationship at the
*beginning* of a movie?)
        Ray Walston, who played the original Uncle Martin in the
television series, gets an extended cameo here as a SETI official
hot on the trail of the alien.  The role is thoroughly unnecessary,
and appears to have been inserted for no other reason than to give
Walston a reason to appear in the film.  He plays up to the camera
big time: as we know, Martians get "drunk" on ice cream.  Witness
how Walston turns right to the camera at one point and takes a big
bite of vanilla.  I guess it's supposed to be ironic that the former
Martian is now eating ice cream, but it comes across as nothing more
than camera-hogging.  Yeah, hi Ray.  We see you.
        Perhaps most disappointing is the film's willingness to
follow its characters down irrelevant tangents, even when
urgency is required.  Martin appears frantic when he discovers
that an explosion will result if he doesn't take off within 12
hours, but nonetheless, he and Tim go about their business in a
leisurely manner.  And I was most surprised to discover that an
alternator from an American car will interface with a Martian
spacecraft engine with no rewiring whatsoever.  Neato.
        I know, I know, I'm missing the point.  As a kids' movie,
there's nothing wrong with "My Favorite Martian"; parts of it are
fun, and Lloyd in particular goes above and beyond the call of
duty to keep the audience laughing.  But like most science-fiction
films, the movie relies more on effects than story.  Kids will
probably enjoy it, and so will adults (if they have a love for
wacky physical comedy), but I was hoping for a little less formula
and a little more science.

Susan Granger's review of "MY FAVORITE MARTIAN"
   It's hard to believe that the big-screen version of the
ingratiating CBS-TV sitcom of the early '60s could be this awful!
Christopher Lloyd seems geniunely embarrassed as a stranded space
alien who meets Earthling Jeff Daniels when his UFO crashes, and
Jeff's a mild-mannered TV news producer investigating the
phenomenon. (Bill Bixby played the role originally.) Lloyd stows away
in the trunk of Daniels' car and moves into his home, posing as his
Uncle Martin, wreaking havoc until, allegedly, his superiority complex
and wacky charm prevail. Don't believe it! This is no "Addams Family"
or "Brady Bunch." Screenwriters Sherri Stoner and Deanna Oliver
("Casper") concocted the wretched screenplay filled with banal
one-liners and an ending unabashedly lifted from "E.T." - and the mess
is ineptly directed by Donald Petrie ("Grumpy Old Men") who must have
encouraged the over-acting.  A bizarre casting note: Darryl Hannah
plays a supposedly homely camerawoman who reads "Men are from Mars"
and is secretly in love with Daniels who, predictably, pants for
Elizabeth Hurley, his airhead co-producer. Wallace Shawn is a silly,
villainous scientist who conspires with a secretive government
operative, Ray Walston (TV's original Uncle Martin), to capture the
emerald-green Martian to perform some gruesome experiments on him,
probing his retractable antennas and analyzing his ability to levitate
things by pointing his finger. And the Martian's spacesuit, named
Zoot, is an over-sexed animated character, voiced by unbilled Wayne
Knight. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "My Favorite Martian"
is a lamebrained 2. It's cheesy, creepy, and sleazy or were those
three Disney dwarfs?

Synopsis:
MY FAVORITE MARTIAN is a special effects comedy based on the 1963 black
and white TV sitcom of the same name starring Ray Walston and Bill
Bixby.
A young Santa Barbara newsman named Tim stumbles upon a crashed Martian
spaceship and befriends a wacky but kindhearted Martian as well as the
Martian's sentient space suit. To help the friendly Martian remain
undetected, Tim and the Martian pretend the Martian is Tim's "Uncle
Martin." Funny situations arise out of cultural misunderstandings,
attempts to remain inconspicuous in the community, and trying to
outsmart alien-catching dark-suited agents from a menacing research
organization called SETI.
Meanwhile Martin tries to help Tim's romance life. Tim fantasizes about
glamour gal Brace (Elizabeth Hurley), but isn't plain coworker Lizzie
(Daryl Hannah) closer to his heart?
Opinion:
Truth is stranger than fiction. Blurry, high altitude shots of the Mars
northern hemisphere's Cydonia region (taken by the 1976 Viking I Mars
orbiting probe and published by the National Space Science Data Center)
reveal what seem to be various triangular, square, and 5-sided pyramidal
objects, along with straight lines among and between them. Most
intriguing is a gigantic Washington Monument-type obelisk standing tall
on the side of a huge crater and casting a long shadow. Since craters
are large indentations caused by meteorites smashing into the ground,
it's likely the monument was created after the crater formed; otherwise
it would have been smashed to smithereens by the meteorite. If so, what
natural process could have erected a tall, thin, pointy structure? It
would take a six-month journey from Earth to Mars in order to reach the
site and investigate.
As for the movie, fans of the 1960s TV series will recognize the theme
song and welcome the familiar face of Ray Walston. There's not a whole
lot of substance to MY FAVORITE MARTIAN, but plenty of energetic running
around and MEN IN BLACK-style morphing into goofy alien creatures make
it entertaining as a children's film. Parents, however, should be warned
there are some instances of crude humor that aren't too appropriate for
little kids such as the space suit growing breasts and a scientist
hinting of sexual advances to a tied up lady.

Another day, another nostalgic sitcom movie adaptation.  But, with My
Favorite Martian, Hollywood is truly scraping the bottom of the barrel.
(Well, one could argue that the barrel scraping started with Car 54,
Where Are You? and McHale's Navy, but let's not quibble, shall we?)  The
headache-inducing My Favorite Martian has little to offer but empty
special effects and a vacant sense of humor.
Jeff Daniels stars as Tim O'Hara, a struggling television journalist.
He spends his time chasing pointless news stories while lusting after
the boss's sexy reporter daughter, Brace Channing (Elizabeth Hurley),
and completely ignoring his production assistant, Lizzie (Daryl Hannah).
Tim's entire life is turned upside down when he witnesses a UFO crash.
Before he knows it, the alien inside has donned human form, and moves in
with him, posing as his "Uncle Martin" (Christopher Lloyd).  As if
living with an alien with magical powers wasn't enough, Tim also has to
put up with Martin's self-animated talking spacesuit, named Zoot.  (Zoot
was apparently added to demonstrate special effects technology and
provide comic relief...neither of which he does very well.)
In addition to repairing his spaceship, Martin must evade the
governmental men in black who are hunting him down.  Led by the obsessed
scientist, Dr. E. Coleye (Wallace Shawn), and accompanied by the
enigmatic Armitan (Ray Walston), the government agents will stop at
nothing to capture a live Martian specimen.
This is the type of film whose most inspired scene is its very first (in
which the Mars Pathfinder somehow misses evidence of a thriving
futuristic alien society on Mars).  It's a scene almost worthy of a
laugh, and everything is all downhill from there.
Borrowing a page from Flubber, My Favorite Martian subscribes to the
theory that frantic special effects action simply must be humorous.  The
idea is that if there's enough commotion on the screen, your mind will
simply stop trying to find humor, and just assume that things must be
funny.  Granted, small children and the easily amused might actually
fall for that ploy, but most people will simply get annoyed.
Christopher Lloyd's spaced out spaceman is simply a variation on his
familiar wild and eccentric characters.  Martin could easily be Back to
the Future's Doc Brown with antennae (if only he were more amusing).
Jeff Daniels once again  plays the exasperated straight man.  You would
think he would be able to find better material than this by now.
Young children and others who don't know better might pretend to find
some sense of amusement in My Favorite Martian.  But don't be
fooled...this film is even more desolate than the arid Martian
landscape.

 My Favorite Martian (1999) 1/2 star out of 4. Starring Jeff Daniels,
Christopher Lloyd, Wallace Shawn and Ray Walston
 Sometimes we film critics go above and beyond the call of duty. We sit -
and suffer - through some products so you won't have to.
 Such is the case with My Favorite Martian, a witless, childish adaptation
of the mid-1960s sitcom.
 It is a movie that contains laughs, but they are more of the embarrassing
type than ones created by humorous situations.
 Jeff Daniels as Tim O'Hara and Christopher Lloyd as his "Uncle Martin"
spend most of their time mugging outrageously rather than acting. They are
joined by Wallace Shawn, who is so over the top that you can cover him with
pineapple and use him for an Eastern Sunday dinner.
 It's a sad pronouncement on a movie when a computer generated living
spacesuit conveys more personality than any of the live actors.
 Thus it is with this silly, crass venture.
Am I being too critical of something that is meant to be merely a piece of
fluff. Not really. Just because a movie aims for the lowest common
denominator doesn't mean it should be praised when it hits its mark.
 Even the special effects have that second-rate feel to them, more along
those of a made-for-TV movie than a big studio motion picture.
 The plot, what little there is, revolves around "Uncle Martin" crashing on
Earth and his attempts to repair his spaceship and return to Mars. Along
the way Lloyd makes numerous cliched remarks about how backward humans are,
while learning the joys of ice cream.
 It's all very juvenile and aimed for a young, undiscerning and
unsophisticated audience.
And of course, the ending leaves an opening for a sequel which, if one is
produced, should go directly to video or the Disney Channel, where such
low-fare offerings can be switched off with the pressing of a button.
 My Favorite Martian is an black eye for the Disney studio. It is a movie
that should make a warp speed jump to the video shelves.

Pssst, if you'll be very quiet, I'll sneak you inside the locked doors
of one of Hollywood's creative departments where some
multimillion-dollar executives are planning their next movie.
On the far wall they have glued pages from old "TV Guides". It falls to
the senior executive in charge - he doesn't make those big bucks for
nothing - to throw the dart.
Zip, it hits the old "My Favorite Martian" series. This is quite
fortuitous, since it came close to hitting Bonanza instead. With
Bonanza, they'd have to hire a big cast and do expensive location
shooting, but, with a movie like MY FAVORITE MARTIAN, they can make it
much cheaper. One suit says that they can get his daughter to use her
Erector set and the family camcorder to film the opening Mars land rover
sequence.
They need someone to write the script. Best to use two writers so they
can get the job done fast. They go for Sherri Stoner and Deanna Oliver.
Stoner and Oliver whipped out a quick, if bland, script for CASPER,
another remake, so they could probably be counted on to do the same for
MY FAVORITE MARTIAN.
One guy suggests that they get the lead from the original television
show to do a cameo part. It's his lucky day. Robin Williams answers the
phone himself. But as luck would have it, Robin turns out to have been
in a different old TV show, one called "Mork & Mindy." Such is the
problem of being a 25-year-old executive, your memory only stretches
back so far. Looking in the Internet Movie Data Base, he finds out that
the original Martian was Ray Walston. A call to him, and they have a key
supporting player signed.
In order to keep the attention of the adults in the audience, they
figure a woman reporter with minimal brains but maximum cleavage would
be perfect. They are on a roll now, as their first choice for the role,
Elizabeth Hurley, accepts. They'll ask the writers to put in as much
sexual innuendo as possible and throw in a bit of nudity - although not
by her, it turns out - just so long as the movie gets no worse than a PG
rating.
For the rest of the cast, they go for old reliable Christopher Lloyd
from the BACK TO THE FUTURE series to play the Martian and Jeff Daniels
from 101 DALMATIANS to be the poor reporter who discovers the Martian.
In their best touch, they even find a part for the lovely, but generally
ignored, actress Daryl Hannah from SPLASH.
A year or so later, the executives gather in their plush screening room
to view the results. MY FAVORITE MARTIAN runs just 1:32. It got the PG
rating they needed even with the sexual innuendo, brief nudity, mild
profanity and monsters that will scare some little ones. They figure,
probably correctly, that the film is appropriate for all ages even if
they did push some limits.
My son Jeffrey, age 9, probably summed it up best. He said that the
movie was little more than a 30 minute TV show and gave it just * ˝. His
friend Jessica, age 9, liked it a little better (***) and her brother
George, age 7, liked better still (****), so there is some hope for good
box office numbers, but more importantly, for those lucrative video
sales and rentals.

Running Time: 1 hour 33 minutes
I love movies. I really do. Every time I watch great movies like Goodfellas
(1990) or Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), a tear comes to my eye due to the
awesome talent, skill and entertainment that is on display. Even lower grade
films such as The Naked Gun 33 1/3 (1994) or Ghostbusters II (1988) while
not exactly brilliantly well made, are certainly not a waste of celluloid
and present entertainment value. Then there's My Favourite Martian, the
exact opposite of what a movie should be: a hurried, poorly written and
acted movie with one goal, to make money. Disney, ever since The Lion King
(1994) have lost their magic touch, but this dross just shows how far Disney
have sunk.
Christopher Lloyd plays a Martian who crash lands in front of T.V reporter's
Tim O'Hara car (Daniels), and soon Tim finds the Martian in his home, trying
to recover and fix his spaceship. Along with his 'Zoot' spacesuit, voiced by
Wayne Knight, must fix his spaceship before it explodes, and also try to
stop his identity being revealed to the public, firstly by O'Hara, but later
by rival T.V presenter Brace Channing (Hurley), by calling himself Tim's
'Uncle Martin.' 'Laughter' is supposed to arise from the 'comical' events,
but never does.
Many bad films have good intentions, but My Favourite Martian doesn't appear
to try to provide any entertainment. Filled to the brim with wham bang
special effects,  My Favourite Martian offers little more than some nice eye
candy. Christopher Lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie, I've never
seen a man pull a face for 93 minutes until now. Jeff Daniels plays 'staple
nice guy' and his role is useless. His performance is incredibly lazy,
although his paperthin character doesn't deserve more than the performance
he gives. Darryl Hannah looks as pretty as ever, but her role is somewhat,
erm, limited. Hurley mistakes 'acting' for 'shouting and looking like a
twit' and wins the David Wilcock award for 'Most Irritating, Godawful
Performance in a Moving Picture.' Way to go Liz! For the supporting cast,
Disney manage to assemble every character actor out there, during the film I
was going 'he was the guy in...ah..er...' before finally giving up and
switching off.
Another major setback is the staple 'comedy sidekick.' Unfortunately, the
writers (Sherri Stoner and Deanna Oliver, if anyone cares) forget that a
comedy sidekick needs to be 'funny.' Instead, they deliver Zoot, the
Martians deeply unfunny sidekick. Although meant to be a manic character no
doubt, every line that comes out of his 'neck' is a dud. A real dud. Citizen
Kane delivers more laughs a minute than his hell spawn piece of polyester.
Even the kids in the audience were insulted by this character: not one child
even bothered to smirk. It's a nice special effect, though.
Another problems with this comedy are the gags themselves. Or rather, the
lack of them. My Favourite Martian reaches a new level of toilet humour: it
goes past the bowl, down the pipe and into the sewer. Now, toilet humour can
be funny, as Dumb and Dumber (1994) humorously showed. But here, characters
farting, belching and almost getting crapped on (literally) is not
'amusing.' It's insulting. There's one good gag right before the credits,
but it appears the guy who wrote that gag tragically died and his unfunny
twin continued. Either that, or they were hoping that easy to please six
year olds wouldn't mind the fact that his movie is beaten by Men At Work in
the funny stakes. Yes, Men At Work. Yowza!
The fact that a lot of money was pumped into this film, and that they
actually got people to agree to be in this film just depresses me even more.
There are thousands of brilliant films out there that can't get
distribution, yet trash like this gets released nation-wide with ease.
Thankfully, as soon as it makes it's money, it will never be seen again, and
My Favourite Martian will end up where the two lead characters do near the
end of the movie: down the toilet.
