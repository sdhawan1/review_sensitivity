 (Maurice Guppy),  Elizabeth McKechnie (Iris), Laura Sadler (Joyce),

 1996-UK/Canada)
A disturbing drama, inspired by a true story, that rails against the
hypocritical sexual attitudes of the times. It takes place in 1954, in a
small English coastal town. The first-time filmmaker, Philip Goodhew,
takes us behind the nice lace curtains of a respectable British
household and brings us a story of repression, jealousy, and obsession.
It's a well-made but grimly unmoving film, that dwells on an unpleasant
subject, that culminates in a gruesome double homicide.
Harold Guppy (Rupert Graves) is a handsome but disturbed lad, whom his
mother gave up on when he was a lad. He has some psychological maladies
due to an imbalance in his system and was told by a Navy shrink if he
ate huge quantities of sugar it would calm him. He spent his childhood
in reform schools in Australia and spent some time in the Merchant
Marines. He returns to his hometown to strike up a relationship with his
brother Morris (Les Dennis), who doesn't recognize him when they first
meet. It turns out that Morris only saw his younger brother a few times
in his life, and considers him to be a stranger.
Not made welcome in his brother's house, as his frigid wife, Iris
(Elizabeth McKechnie), is leery of Harold and considers him as merely an
intruder. But Harold answers a newspaper ad and finds a room in an age
50-ish grandmother's house, Marjorie Beasley (Julie Walters). She's
married to Stanley (Matthew Walker), who is a good provider despite
having lost a leg during WW 1. But ever since he lost his leg, she only
respects him as a breadwinner but otherwise finds him to be a
reprehensible drunk. Also at home, there's a bright but troubled
13-year-old daughter Joyce (Laura Sadler), who likes to fill her head
with little facts and spouts them out to shock whomever she's talking
to.
Upon taking the room the bossy landlady, prone to wearing thick
eyeglasses, having her short hair in a curled bouffant, clad in frumpy
dresses, and supplementing her income by working as a laundress, tells
Harold: "My husband and I keep separate rooms for medical purposes, and
I sleep with Joy." On the school evening of Joy's 14th birthday party,
the landlady who insists her lodger call her Mum, sneaks into his
bedroom and slips under the bed covers of the reluctant lodger, and
won't leave until Harold capitulates and says yes. If this isn't
complicated enough, Joy enters the room and hops into bed, saying she'll
tell her dad if she can't stay. In this rather peculiar ménage ŕ trois,
Harold is not only stuck with Mum but has to ward off Joyce. They
threaten to either tell the police on him, or tell Stanley. On the first
night of this upcoming sexual affair Joy pretends to sleep, as Mum can't
resist having another go at it with Harold even though her daughter is
in the same bed. During the course of the story, Harold has quite a time
keeping Joy a virgin and Marjorie from devouring him.
Seeking advice from his cold-hearted brother and frigid sister-in-law,
he's advised to get away from that house and join the Army. When he
does, he meets a girl named Jean (Annie Keller), whom he wants to marry.
But Marjorie blackmails him into returning and buys his way out of the
Army.
There's plenty of black humor in the film: the weak-willed Harold gets a
tattoo with Mum written on it; the landlady lectures a fired laundress,
who got pregnant, on her immoral behavior; and, birthday girl Joyce can
exclaim upon being asked to go back to her room alone when seeing Harold
and her mother in bed: "It's not fair. It's my birthday!"
By the climax, it becomes apparent that this affair is no laughing
matter. The pathetic Harold is a real sickie, who gets sentenced to life
for going berserk and killing the two women who tormented his dim-witted
soul. But the film somehow couldn't get past its laughter at these
absurd characters and it failed to provide some pathos to go with the
dramatics. There was just a growing emptiness that seemed to hang over
it, which prevented me from seeing this as just your typical bizarre
crime story.

     Okay, I admit it.  I'm a sucker for true stories.  Everyone has
their weakness, and reality-based movies are mine.  In the press kit
for INTIMATE RELATIONS, first-time writer and director Philip Goodhew
claims that ninety-nine percent of the facts are accurate.  He even
took the film's title from the coy term the newspapers of the time used
instead of the forbidden word, "sex."
     Rupert Graves plays the easily manipulated, 33-year-old Harold
Guppy.  Harold comes to stay for a spell in an English country town.
Not having much money, he rents a small room from the Beasleys.
Stanley Beasley (Matthew Walker) is an alcoholic with a wooden leg,
thanks to the war.  His wife Marjorie, an unattractive grandmother in
her late fifties, is played by Julie Walters, the Academy Award nominee
for EDUCATING RITA.
     Marjorie interviews Harold before allowing him to stay with them.
"Don't worry about me," he assures her.  "I was just a bit of a
rapscallion when I was 10."  Her husband warns him that they have a
young girl living in the house, so he expects him to be on his best
behavior.  The warning, however, should have gone to his wife.
     Marjorie, who loathes her husband and denies him any sex with her
due to her delicate condition, has anything but honorable intentions
toward her new lodger.  Set in the ticky-tacky, pastel 1950s, the
time's hypocritical attitudes about sex are sometimes surprising but
never more so that Marjorie's lechery.
     Their 13-year-old daughter Joyce is played with a mixture of
innocence and sexual longing by film newcomer Laura Sadler.  At first
she is the typical young teen.  She and her friend discuss the
definition of biology, and Joyce says it is "the study of living
orgasms."  This sends both of them into uncontrollable fits of giggles.
This is also one of the few laughs in what is a serious film about a
highly dysfunctional family that gets involved in a high profile,
criminal case.  The sometimes kitsch sets leads one at first to think
that the show will become a black comedy, which it doesn't.
     Joyce's 14th birthday party -- full of hideous blue cake and silly
cucumbers shaped like tiny alligators -- is when the troubles start.
An innocent spin-the-bottle game has Marjorie attacking Harold into the
hall.  That night, Marjorie sneaks in bed with Harold, who is initially
repulsed and refuses to cooperate.  Joyce, who normally sleeps with her
mom -- her drunken father has own room, comes into bed with her mom
even though she is in bed with Harold.  When Joyce feigns falling
asleep, Marjorie and Harold start what will become a long series of
liaisons.  Like alcoholics trying to quit, the show has many scenes in
which Marjorie assures Harold that this will be the last time if he
will just make love to her now.
     The complication in the story is that the two carry on their
affair under Joyce's eyes.  Morality has no practical meaning for any
of them.  Julie Walters gives a convincing portrayal of a woman who
fancies herself a young seductress as well as an upstanding member of
the community but is neither.  When a girl at the laundry where she
works gets the sack for becoming pregnant, Marjorie lectures her
sternly.  "A lady's reputation is all she has," she admonishes her,
sounding completely sincere.
     Like mother like daughter, Joyce tries, unsuccessfully, to
blackmail Harold into having sex with her.  When Harold has had enough
of this manipulation by both of them, he joins the army and signs up
for a 12 year hitch.  "I like being told what to do," he explains.
"I'm used to it."
     And this is just a part of their crazy lives.  Eventually, after
more twists and turns, the film comes to its somewhat predictable
conclusion.  The ending is the least satisfying aspect of the movie,
even though it is true.  It is the character study of these people up
until the ending that makes the picture.  Human beings can do some
pretty stupid things and let themselves get stuck in hopeless
situations.
     INTIMATE RELATIONS runs 1:45.  It is rated R for sex, profanity,
and violence and would be fine for mature teenagers.  I give the
picture a mild thumbs up and ** 1/2.

No one could be more the model of a decent, upstanding wife and
mother than the fiftyish Marjorie Beasley (Julie Walters).   She,
her husband Stanley (Matthew Walker), and their 14-year-old daughter
Joyce (Laura Sadler)  live in a small town in England.    Who would
dream that hormones are raging uncontrollably in Marjorie's blood?
Her husband, a WWI veteran who lost his leg in the war, is treated
by Marjorie like so much dirt, to the point where she does not share
a bedroom with him.  Instead he has been relegated to a cubicle.
The bedroom now belongs to her and Joyce. In other times, Marjorie
would not have married Stanley but this was after the war when men
were in short supply.
Based on a real event that shocked the nation, (99% of the facts are
true according to the writer)  the film opens with Harold (Rupert
Graves) a young man with an unhappy childhood and  just out on
parole answering an ad for a lodger.  Once ensconced in his bedroom,
Harold quickly discovers what Marjorie meant when she advertised bed
and board.   Dressed in curlers and an old bathrobe she enters his
room and pleads for a little "cuddling.".  Surprised and reluctant
at first, he soon succumbs.  Harold had spent all of his young life
in institutions and lacks the will or ability to say "No."
Marjorie, in her perversity, and now having what she wants and
loving it,  gives him no rest.
The film turns even blacker as daughter Joyce (in a fine bit of
acting by Sadler)  joins in by demanding that she be allowed in bed
with Harold and Marjorie; permission is granted.   Even when husband
Stanley becomes aware, he is too browbeaten to make a fuss.   Thus,
behind the lace curtains that look out on the quiet street, some
weird antics are going on which can lead to no good; someone is going
to get badly hurt.
The very title speaks of euphemisms.   The newspaper articles on
which the story was based never used the word "sex."    The English
of that period used catch phrases; hence "intimate relations."

     INTIMATE RELATIONS is the latest in a long line of films that 
claims to have been inspired by real events.  This is one of those 
instances, however, when I could care less whether or not the movie is 
based on a true story -- the knowledge certainly doesn't add anything to 
the viewing experience.  Nevertheless, for some reason, it seems 
important to first-time director Philip Goodhew that we recognize that 
at least the bare-bone facts of INTIMATE RELATIONS are culled from the 
historical record.
     Of far more interest than the "based on a true story" aspect is the 
film's central theme about the inherent hypocrisy of a "morally upright" 
(or should that be "uptight") society.  There has been and always will 
be a human preoccupation with sex.  The only thing that changes with the 
years is how the culture deals with this basic concept.  The 1950s, the 
era in which INTIMATE RELATIONS is set, was a time of sexual repression.  
Appearances meant everything, and people would go to extraordinary 
lengths to seem above moral reproach, even if the truth was much 
different.
     Such is the case with Marjorie Beasley (Julie Walters), an aging 
wife and mother who is outwardly a model citizen.  Inwardly, however, 
she is a haunted and lonely person who craves sexual satisfaction.  Her 
husband's touch disgusts her, so she constantly rebuffs him, even going 
so far as to move into a separate bedroom.  But, when a handsome young 
border, Harold Guppy (Rupert Graves), rents the Beasleys' spare bedroom, 
Marjorie goes on the prowl, insinuating herself into Harold's good 
graces, then seducing him.  Their affair gets off to a rocky start, but 
the biggest problem isn't the two decades age difference -- it's that 
Marjorie's 13-year old daughter, Joyce (Laura Sadler), is fully aware of 
what's going on between her mother and the lodger, and she intends to 
use that knowledge to blackmail Harold.
     It's possible to see INTIMATE RELATIONS as a dark comedy, but it's 
really more of an attack on the hypocritical attitudes that pervade 
society in every era.  By choosing a story from '50s England, Goodhew 
distances us from events, but that doesn't mean that the issues he is 
addressing aren't as valid today as they were two generations ago.  Our 
society may claim to be more liberal and permissive in the '90s, but 
sexual secrets are still the most closely guarded, and, if they get into 
the open, have the greatest potential to damage.  Appearances still 
count for more than reality.
     Plot-wise, INTIMATE RELATIONS is nothing special.  The film is too 
long and too repetitive -- we get the point well before the final, 
inevitable act.  In many ways, this movie seems to be trying to 
recapture the spirit and feel of Peter Jackson's courageous, original 
HEAVENLY CREATURES.  Indeed, there are some similarities -- the slightly 
exaggerated fashion with which '50s families are depicted, the way that 
simple domestic discord grows into something that's increasingly more 
ominous, and the manner in which obsession is shown to short-circuit all 
rational thought.  INTIMATE RELATIONS is a more pedestrian film, 
however.  It lacks the artistry and the character depth that Jackson 
brought to his breakthrough feature.
     Veteran actress Julie Walters (best known for her role in EDUCATING 
RITA) is wonderful as Marjorie.  It's a little chilling how easily her 
character switches from the British version of June Cleaver (who would 
rather "be dead than brazen") to the pathetic, sex-starved woman who 
crawls her way into Howard's bed every night.  Rupert Graves (THE 
MADNESS OF KING GEORGE) is almost, but not quite, as good as the object 
of Marjorie's obsession.  Howard sees himself as a victim, although, in 
fact, he shares equal responsibility for starting the affair.  He just 
didn't expect to be trapped by a woman with a FATAL ATTRACTION.  
Newcomer Laura Sadler, who plays Marjorie's teenage daughter, brings an 
appealing mix of innocence, eroticism, and cunning to the most complex 
role in the film.
     Ultimately, I appreciated the ideas in INTIMATE RELATIONS more than 
the presentation.  Things feel a little too over-familiar at times, as 
if I've seen them before, and it isn't hard to guess how the story will 
end (consequently, it seems to take forever to get to that point).  
Also, from time-to-time, the characters are designed more as tools to be 
used in service of Goodhew's themes than as unique individuals.  These 
elements conspire to weaken the film just enough that the mixture of 
drama, suspense, and dark comedy fails to gel properly.  As a result, 
while INTIMATE RELATIONS makes an important statement, it does so in a 
forum that often feels clunky and awkward.
