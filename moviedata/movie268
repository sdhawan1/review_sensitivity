I enjoyed the original Rush Hour, the 1998 action comedy that grossed
more than $250 million worldwide.  Through its central characters,
played by Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan, the film provided audiences with
a fresh, exciting combination of action and outrageous comedy.  Although
not a great film, and certainly not worthy of a sequel, director Brett
Ratner admirably stitched together two immensely different characters,
finding a charismatic delight in the diversity of Tucker and Chan.
Unfortunately Ratner does not find the same joy in Rush Hour 2, an
occasionally amusing comedic adventure that leaves us with a profoundly
annoying Chris Tucker fighting for attention while Jackie Chan fights
one-dimensional Chinese villains with his bare fists.  The film contains
some neat action sequences, a great third act, and the most hilarious
outtakes I can remember - but the clash of genres feels intrusive and
awkward.  I wanted more excitement, more character dimension, and a
whole hell of a lot less of Chris Tucker's irritating mouth.
In this sequel, Chan and Tucker reprise their roles as Chief Inspector
Lee of the Royal Hong Kong Police and the all-American LAPD detective
James Carter.  As the movie opens, the two buddies arrive in Hong Kong
for a much needed vacation but receive the biggest case of their careers
almost immediately.  An explosion has killed two U.S. customs agents who
were investigating producers of counterfeit money, and the police
suspect the mastermind behind the scheme to be Ricky Tan (John Lone, in
a very effective performance), the head of the deadliest gang in China.
Although it pisses Carter off, Lee accepts the case -- for personal
reasons, perhaps.  Enter the seductive secret service agent Isabella
Molina (Roselyn Sanchez), billionaire hotel owner and Tan associate
Steven Reign (Alan King), and a sexy but dangerous Hu Li (Crouching
Tiger, Hidden Dragon's Zhang Ziyi), and you have the unpredictable
formula for Rush Hour 2.  Jumping from one locale to the next, Carter
and Lee find adventure at a local massage parlor, a bar, a casino, an
extravagant hotel, and even a luxurious yacht.
Good action sequences and energetic performances don't fuel the movie's
plot, which is often rambling and meaningless.  Rush Hour 2 tries to
pass its plot off as serious, but it's hard to play along when Tucker
can't even play roulette without making a fool of himself.  This is not
supposed to be a stark drama, but after a while, we want relief from the
nonstop comic relief.
Tucker doesn't steal his scenes; instead he steals our attention away
from them.  Chris Tucker is a talented, energetic comedian.  In
moderation, he can be very effective.  Unfortunately, in Rush Hour 2, he
appears in almost every scene and quickly outstays his welcome.  In Rush
Hour, he was an appreciated comic relief.  Here, I just wanted him to
shut up.

Starring Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker, Chris Penn, John
Lone, Ziyi Zhang. Directed by Brett Ratner. Rated
PG-13.
I guess it's a credit to Jackie Chan and the general
likeability of the franchise that Rush Hour 2 could
not be ruined even by the nauseating "comedy" of Chris
Tucker. I'm a fan of Jackie Chan in just about any
medium, and this movie lets him not only do his
impressive-as-ever martial arts schtick, but show off
his comic timing as well. It would have worked better
if he was the only name above the title.
The plot is your basic martial arts flick clothesline
for stunts and special effects. This time around, the
evil smugglers are led by Ricky Tan (John Lone), who
makes his fortune by shipping counterfeit money into
the United States (I'm still not sure how you can make
a fortune doing that: is there a place where one can
exchange fake bills for real ones?). The only way to
tell the phony money from the genuine article is to
set it on fire and see what color it burns.
Of course, it's up to Hong Kong Detective Lee (Chan)
and trash-talking LAPD Detective James Carter (Tucker)
to take the bad guys out and the authorities, to the
extent that they even exist, stay out of their way.
Rush Hour 2 turns the tables on the first film in that
here it's Carter who gets the two of them into trouble
and Lee who winds up having to get them out.
I guarantee that my rating would have been at least a
half of a grade higher had anyone other than Chris
Tucker been cast as the foil for Jackie Chan. He
refuses to shut up. Not only did his voice feel like a
jackhammer on my head, but his jokes just aren't
funny, a pathetic mixture of sub-par Eddie Murphy
fasttalking blather and wannabe Chris Rock
white-man-black-man jokes that wind up being more
offensive than funny. I realize that in a movie like
this some of the biggest laughs come from letting the
actors ad lib beyond what the script dictates, but
didn't anyone realize how irritating Tucker's
incessant ranting and raving was? If this is all the
comedian has to offer then I don't care to see any
more of his films.
Fortunately, Chan makes for a marvelous straight man,
and he redeems the fledgling comedy completely. It's
not often that one actor can so completely save a
movie, but there is no other name for what he does;
whenever he's on screen, Rush Hour 2 comes to nearly
breathtaking, often hilarious, life. Much of it hinges
on the dubious value of how cute it is to watch Chan
try to be a "player," but who cares? I can think of
few high concepts that are funnier.
The movie ends with outtakes that, as usual, show that
Chan isn't perfect, and that it does, indeed, take him
a few tries to get some of his incredible stunts to
look seamless. Chris Tucker botches some lines as
well, and his mistakes are funnier than anything he
says in the whole movie.
A lot of people have pointed out Rush Hour 2 isn't
very different from its predecessor in tone or style.
But I liked the original, and I like the sequel,
though a certain sidekick seems to have done his best
to ruin it. Director Brett Ratner (The Family Man)
keeps it moving at an entertaining pace and manages to
keep the laughs coming despite the fairly miserable
hit to miss ratio of the jokes (I guess sometimes the
shotgun approach works). It's not great Jackie Chan,
but it's Jackie Chan, and that's enough.

The problem with movies like RUSH HOUR 2 that give away almost all of the good
jokes in the trailers is that seeing the movie itself is about as much fun as
watching reruns.  In RUSH HOUR 2, this problem is further compounded by the lack
of freshness in the jokes themselves.  How many times have we heard the one
about the two guys who keeping misunderstanding each other as when one says a
woman "is da bomb" and the other thinks that the woman "has the bomb?" 
The movie's almost saving grace is that it stars that teddy bear of a martial
arts comedic hero, Jackie Chan.  Actually, he refers to himself in the movie as
a Snoopy character that women love.  And women, if you do have a thing for
Jackie, you'll be glad to know that you'll get a chance to catch a glimpse of
his naked buttocks this time.  Blink, and you'll miss it.
As they did in the original, Chan, as Hong Kong Detective Inspector Lee, teams
up with Chris Tucker, as LAPD Detective James Carter.  They have good chemistry
together even if Tucker keeps trying to upstage Chan.  Lee and Carter are best
when they are the most surprised, as they are when they go to a gay haberdasher
(Jeremy Piven) to get outfitted in the finest silks.  But, if you've seen the
trailers, you already know the joke.
The setup this time, to the extent that one is needed in a Chan movie, concerns
the thwarting of an international counterfeiting ring.  John Lone (THE LAST
EMPEROR) and Zhang Ziyi (CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON) play the villains. 
Roselyn Sanchez plays a big bosomed woman who may or may not be a secret service
agent hot on the trail of the cash and the printing plates.  Don Cheadle has a
cameo that works best in the outtakes, just about always the best part of any
Chan film anyway.
As always, Chan is lovable, funny and vulnerable.  Unlike most action heroes,
his pain is palpable.  Working from an unimaginative script by Ross LaManna,
director Brett Ratner is never able to get the pacing right, with long slack
sections slowing the momentum between funny moments.  In the movies today, all
roads lead to Las Vegas, where the neon glitters and all of the buildings are
little more than movie sets for adults.  RUSH HOUR 2 ends there in a burst of
glory that hints at what could have been if the rest of the movie were better
written and more tightly paced.
RUSH HOUR 2 runs 1:30.  It is rated PG-13 for action violence, language and some
sexual material and would be acceptable for kids around 8 and up.
My son Jeffrey and his friend Sam, both age 12, gave the movie *** 1/2 and ***,
respectively. They both thought that it was funny and had well planned out
laughs.
The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, August 3, 2001.  In
the Silicon Valley it will be showing at the AMC and the Century theaters.

   Given the relative absence of real laughs and total absence of
wit in this "Rush Hour" sequel, the all-important factor is the
chemistry between the two principals.  Fortunately, it's there in
abundance, several times more so than the rapport between
Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie in "Original Sin"--which is
not saying a whole lot.  Jackie Chan, of course, plays the guy with
most of the physical action: he turns in some mind boggling
stunts best of which involves not his pummeling the criminals but
his slithering under the barred window that protects the earnings
of a Las Vegas night club and his dangling on a bamboo pole
about 15 stories from the ground.  Chris Tucker, still the
motormouth, still the guy whose role is considered "obnoxious but
not so much as in the original" as so many critics have stated,
provides the racial banter, the wide-eyed surprises, the ineffective
womanizing.
   "Rush Hour 2" cooks up no real plot, which is OK since nobody
goes to this sort of movie expecting the slightest taste of
originality.  But Matthew F. Leonetti's lensing under the direction
of Brett Ratner gives us armchair travelers a solid view of Hong
Kong, particularly its gorgeous harbor showing the regular ferry
connecting the two islands with the shots of the boldly lit
advertisements the greatest paean to capitalism east of Las
Vegas.
   When Detective Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) and L.A.P.D.
Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) turn up in Hong Kong,
they're expecting a nice vacation filled with Tsingtao, women and
song, Carter carrying a Cantonese-American dictionary that gets
him into trouble every time--as when he hollers across to the
women in the next car,  "I want to see you naked and to sacrifice a
goat."  When Lee is called in by his commanding officer and
assigned the job of tracking down the Triad gang and its deadly
leader, Ricky Tan (John Lone), Carter sounds more than annoyed
but we can see deep down that he's probably more excited about
the action that awaits than he would be even in the massage
parlor where he has chosen a quintet of women to relax his
muscles.
   The inevitable fight scenes that pit the two buddies against the
sinister, unsmiling gang members are happily not over-edited but
compared to what Jet Li faced in "Kiss of the Dragon," pitting Li
against a veritable army of black belts, Jackie's skirmishes are a
walk in the park.
   The story by Jeff Nathanson and Ross LaManna moves along
swiftly, from Hong Kong to L.A. to Vegas with nary of moment of
zen-like meditation to accomplish any character-building.  The
humor, such as it is, is based on physical action except for one
great racially tinged gag about an entertainer's color.  The coolest
stunt in the picture featured Jackie Chan with a grenade taped
securely to his mouth while Hu Li (Zhang Ziyi), who is in cahoots
with the Triad gang, is trying to get her finger on the button that
will blow his 32 teeth into his brain--as the malignant star of
"Crouching Tiger" puts it.  Roselyn Sanchez and Zhang Ziyi could
easily make the cut for the next Bond movie ("Bond 20") if the
producers were scouting the field and Ms. Zhang in particular is
absolutely gorgeous. A shame that Mr. Ratner could not have
afforded more time for the woman who made "Crouching Tiger"
such a vital and engaging movie.
Rated PG-13.  Running time: 90 minutes.  (C) 2001 by

Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan are, no doubt about it, one of the great 
present-day motion picture teams. Tucker, mugging charmingly for the camera, 
is a comedian who definitely grows on you, and his outright energy that is 
put into his scenes allow it to brighten up considerably. Chan is just as 
vital a part of their union, the straight man to Tucker's funny man who 
actually has a sly sense of humor himself. The characters in which Tucker and 
Chan portray might as well be named "Chris" and "Jackie," though, as they 
appear to be playing slightly more off-the-wall versions of themselves. The 
smaller roles are all unextraordinary and underdeveloped, with the only one 
worthy of note being Zhang Ziyi (who won acclaim in 2000's "Crouching Tiger, 
Hidden Dragon"), as the ferociously beautiful, tough, and psychotic 
villainess, Hu Li. Ziyi has next to no dialogue, but she inhabits her role 
with an undeniably mesmerizing presence that breaks through, full throttle, 
in her nicely choreographed fight sequences. 
While there are a few instances that show off Chan's incredible martial arts 
bravado (he has been widely publicized to perform all of his own stunts in 
every one of his films), there are not nearly enough of them, choosing to 
almost always go for the comedy in any situation. And because Lee and Carter 
are playing the wholly defined protagonists, there is little sense of 
suspense or possible endangerment to either party. As a full-out comedy, the 
film works only some of the time (it commits the cardinal sin for simply 
trying too hard, and has end title bloopers that are far more amusing than 
anything in the narrative), and as an action film, it is passable, but less 
than awe-inspiring. "Rush Hour 2" leaves the door wide open for a third 
installment; let's hope the makers try harder next time before spending an 
insanely high $90-million on a story that has been told, quite frankly, to 
death.

What has fueled the excitement around "RH2"? 
Arguably, the team of Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan is
the best cop/buddy combo since those guys from "Lethal
Weapon."  Summer moviegoers are looking for a fun
time, which is almost guaranteed when you watch either
of these two flamboyant stars.  And, the first "RH"
was so much fun that you can't help but have high
expectations for this one.
With expectations as high as a mountain, it's almost
impossible for a movie to overcome this kind of
barrier.  And this one can't, falling short on laughs
and defining moments.  In fact, many will think that
the most memorable moments were the outtakes at the
film's end and the cameo by actor Don Cheadle who
speaks Cantonese and displays the Tiger Claw fighting
style.
But the film is not all bad thanks to Chris Tucker,
who as Detective James Carter, is the life of the
party.  In the film's first act, he's in Hong Kong
visiting his old pal, Inspector Lee (Chan).  However,
Lee is always on the job and is currently trying to
solve a recent bombing, suspected to have been carried
out by Ricky Tan (John Lone), a notorious Triad gang
leader.  
Carter just wants to have a good time, and when he
whoops it up at a Karaoke bar, Lee begs him to remain
incognito for this is where Triad gang members tend to
hang out.  However, you just can't shut him up.  "I'm
from LA; we invented gangs," he says.  Turning to the
crowd, he screeches, "All the Triads and the ugly
women on the left side, all the f-f-i-i-i-n-e women on
the right side."  Tucker's brassy demeanor, his
down-with-it attitude and his cluelessness about the
culture and the language make him hilarious to watch.
Unfortunately, after the first 30 minutes, our duo
leaves Hong Kong and all the fun behind.  The
investigation leads them to Los Angeles and Las Vegas
where it's Chan's turn to play the fish-out-of-water. 
But, he looks uncomfortable when speaking English and
doesn't possess Tucker's insouciance.  Chan seemed
statelier and more at ease in the first "RH."  His
role was more dramatic in nature, and he didn't have
to speak too much English.  This film lightheartedly
acknowledges Chan's broken English when he asks,
"don't you understand the words that are coming out of
my mouth?"  Tucker replies disgustedly, "don't nobody
understand the words coming out your mouth!"  Even the
outtakes show many scenes where Chan is trying to
force his English lines.
Also missing are the great stuntwork and fight
sequences that are hallmarks of Chan's work.  The only
good sequence occurs early on where Chan goes against
a cadre of gangsters atop rickety scaffolding several
stories above.  But the other sequences seemed tepid
or looked cartoonish.
"RH2" is only marginally fun to watch while short on
drama.  Yet, it received so much press and hype that
it succeeded in grossing over $69 million in its
opening weekend.  This is an incredible
accomplishment!  And considering the fact that August
is the slowest of summer movie months (the previous
opening record in August was "Sixth Sense" which took
in about $27 mil.), moviegoers couldn't wait to see
Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker reunite.  But what's the
hurry?  "RH2" felt kinda slow.

PLOT:
They're baaaaaack! Only this time the American loudmouth police officer is in
the ass-kicking Chinese police officer's backyard, Hong Kong. There are some bad
guys, lotsa fights, lotsa jokes and that's pretty much all you need to know.
Have a blast!
CRITIQUE:
First things first...do you think that Chris Tucker is a funny guy? If the
answer to that question is a resounding "no", then don't even bother reading the
rest of this review or seeing this movie because you seriously gotta appreciate
the man's humor if you're going to see this movie in the first place. Alright,
now as for the rest of you, be prepared to have yourselves a b-b-blast with this
picture, as Tucker goes gonzo with his motormouth and doesn't shut up until
you're pissing all over yourself in the aisles. Talk about a "laugh a minute"
movie! Ironically, I went into this picture thinking that its best jokes were in
the trailer, but five minutes into this puppy, I knew that I was in for an
all-around good time. But don't you dare go in expecting originality, dramatic
entanglements or emotional attachments to the characters, because that ain't
what this movie's about.
It's actually one of the "easiest" movies that I've had to watch all year, one
that left me beaming when I left the theater (especially since the outtakes are
almost as funny and cool as the film itself) and still smiling when I thought
back to some of Tucker's one-liners (some of his facial expressions alone
cracked me up!). The film is basically this: Tucker makes jokes, Chan kicks ass,
Ziyi Zhang looks great...repeat...Tucker makes jokes, Chan kicks, Ziyi Zhang
looks great. So if you liked the first film, I see no reason why you wouldn't
enjoy this round of fluff either. They've even slapped some different locations
in this one like Hong Kong and Vegas, and a nifty little cameo by the way of Don
Cheadle (kung-fu master!). The film also flies by at a quick 90 minutes and
rarely slows down to take a break. So as long as you don't go in expecting to
save the world when you come out, you will surely be entertained, especially if
you dig on Tucker's humor because he is all over this one! Damn dude, I started
clapping all by myself at some point...wtf?! Fun shtuff!

_Rush_Hour_2_ (PG-13) *** (out of ****)
        _Rush_Hour_2_ is a textbook case of commerce over art, of retreading
over reinvention.  Yet there is something to be said about having a second try
at something that didn't quite work the time out, for derivative and disposable
as it is, this latest go-round with mismatched buddy cops Jackie Chan and Chris
Tucker is a more satisfying light entertainment.
        The original _Rush_Hour_ certainly had its moments, but it had one
central failing: the refusal to let Jackie be Jackie; when the world-famous
martial arts superstar's biggest showpiece in the film is not a fight scene but
a simple slide down a banner, something is clearly amiss.  What fights there
were lacked the creative flavor of his Hong Kong works--making the fact that the
film was Chan's first true stateside blockbuster all the more unfortunate.
        The first big showpiece in _Rush_Hour_2_ shows the situation being
remedied, with Chan's Inspector Lee chasing some baddies while weaving through a
bamboo scaffold.  Later scenes show an even stronger feel for Chan's style, with
the fights featuring his trademark "everything and the kitchen sink" way of
using anything within arm's reach as a weapon.  This being an American (read:
sanitized) production, the action set pieces don't come close to the audacity of
his HK films, but coming after the tepid displays in the original _Rush_Hour_,
they get the job done well enough.
        What of the plot?  Returning director Brett Ratner and writer Jeff
Nathanson don't offer much of an answer.  The film begins just days after the
end of the first, with Lee and LAPD detective James Carter (Tucker) in Hong
Kong.  Carter just wants a relaxing vacation, but naturally that isn't in the
cards as Lee gets him entangled in some not-terribly-interesting business
involving Triad gangs.  Disappointingly, _Rush_Hour_2_ doesn't make much of the
inverse fish-out-of-water scenario it begins on, for before long the duo's
investigation leads them back to U.S. soil--first L.A., then Las Vegas.
        Chan and Tucker's off-kilter chemistry is even more playfully amusing
here, with Chan actually getting the opportunity to deliver some laugh lines
this time.  Of course, the brunt of the comedic burden is carried by Tucker, and
while arguments that he is too loud even by his own standards do hold water
(even if he doesn't come close to what is heretofore his most shrill and
overdone work--his grating performance in Luc Besson's _The_Fifth_Element_), his
timing and ease with a wisecrack deliver the goods.
        The lack of a strong plot means a shortchanging of those playing the
villainous element, particularly _Crouching_Tiger,_Hidden_Dragon_ star Zhang
Ziyi.  It goes without saying that her role here isn't nearly as demanding as
that of Jen Yu, and hence she is more than up to the diminished task here: look
hot in black leather and kick some ass.  Granted, she is more effectively used
than I had initially feared (I was thinking all of her scenes were those in the
trailer), but it is a let down to see that her acting chops don't get much of a
workout.
        But, in all fairness, do anyone's ever get a workout in a Ratner film? 
After all, the most anyone can hope for when seeing his name attached to a film
is a diverting enough slab of slick Hollywood hackwork--and, indeed,
_Rush_Hour_2_ is that.  Chan does his thing; Tucker does his, and everyone who
buys a ticket gets exactly what they paid to see--which is more than can be said
of a number of other popcorn entertainments this summer.

In 1998, director Brett Ratner and his stars, Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker,
breathed new life into the buddy-action film genre with the cross-cultural
"Rush Hour" - to the tune of about $250 million. You don't mess with
success, so the team is back again, and better, in "Rush Hour 2."
The combo of the terrific physical talents of Chan and the non-stop motor
mouth of Tucker made for an ethnically unusual duet in "Rush Hour" that
played well to audiences around the world. The formula worked so well, in
fact, that the sequel was inevitable. I'm never thrilled with the idea of a
follow-up to a successful original since they rarely meet the previously
set expectations. Surprisingly, "Rush Hour 2" wastes no time getting down
to business and turns out to be better than the flick that spawned it.
The script, by Jeff Nathanson (utilizing the characters developed by Ross
LaManna in the first film), wastes no time getting to the point right from
the start. Terrorists have bombed the US embassy in Hong Kong, killing two
American translators, and Chief Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) is handed the
job of solving the crime. Concurrently, his friend James Carter (Chris
Tucker) arrives on the island for some much needed R&R and expects his
friend to spend some time and show him the sights. Instead, Lee drags
Carter into the case and the duo get involved in stopping a conspiracy to
counterfeit hundreds of million of US dollars.
The makers of "Rush Hour 2" are working at a distinct advantage over the
original. We, the viewer, are familiar with the two lead characters and the
already-existing chemistry that Chan and Tucker developed so well the first
time around. That chemistry was a high point (and probably the saving
point) before and, now, the pair wears their friendship like a comfortable
suit. Little time is wasted in getting to know the key players so the
screenplay capitalizes on those things we liked best in "Rush Hour."
First and foremost to me, in "RH2," is the immense pleasure in watching
Jackie Chan's artistry in fight choreography. The 47-year old martial arts
master has a renowned reputation for doing all of his own stunt work and,
here, he does not disappoint. Chan's use of props when battling bad guys
continues as he pulverizes his opponents with whatever item comes to hand,
such as a trash bucket. His moves look every bit as good as they ever did
as he fights four or five nemesis at once on bamboo scaffolding, on the
tail end of a yacht, in a Hong Kong massage parlor and, for the finale, in
a Las Vegas casino. Like Harold Lloyd or Buster Keaton, Chan takes pride in
putting his physical self on the line in pursuit of his artistry and is a
joy to watch.
Chris Tucker reprises his role as the motor mouthed LA cop, Carter, who
teams, again, with Lee to put down the bad guys. When he is unceremoniously
pulled from his vacation to help his colleague and friend with the big
case, he still looks to have some fun. When Lee goes into a karaoke bar,
the lair of chief bad guy Ricky Tan (John Lone) and his hoods, Carter takes
the spotlight on stage with a credible Michael Jackson riff. The comedian
made the move from the improv stage to the big screen and, with Jackie
Chan, has a franchise to hang his coat on to pay the bills. The combo of
Chan's flying feet and fists with Tucker's fast mouth make a duet more
endearing than Riggs and Murtaugh in the "Lethal Weapon" films.
The supporting cast is here to move things along efficiently. John Lone, as
Ricky Tan, is a suave villain who is the real power behind the throne of
American bigwig Steven Reign (Alan King in a walk through performance).
Lone doesn't chew scenery or make pronouncements to "get Lee and Carter,"
but gives the chief bad guy elegance. Zhang Zi-Yi ("Crouching Tiger, Hidden
Dragon") continues to display her martial arts skills as Ricky's taciturn
henchlady, Hu Li, who carries on an ongoing battle with Carter. (Carter has
a problem, through most of the film, with hitting a woman, but this falls
aside with their eventual one-on-one melee at the conclusion.) Roselyn
Sanchez is knockdown gorgeous (and resembles Sandra Bullock) as undercover
agent Isabella Molina - she doesn't add much to the equation but is
terrific to watch.
Director Ratner and the original "Rush Hour" production team have assembled
a crew of skilled craftsmen to work behind the camera. Cinematographer
Matthew F. Leonetti has had a long career of shooting action flicks and
gives "RH2" the fluid camera movement the genre film needs. Production
design by Terrence Marsh spans continents and gives the right look, whether
it is in a Hong Kong karaoke bar or a high stakes Las Vegas casino. The
rest of the techs are of the same high quality.
I'm surprised to even say that "Rush Hour 2" is the most entertaining of
the summer blockbuster movies. It takes the best of the first film and
kicks Jurassic dino butt in its fun, frolic and fast pace and is the best
mainstream thing out, so far, this summer. I give it a B.

In 1998, the police buddy-movie "Rush Hour" clicked with audiences due
to the inspired pairing of lovable action star Jackie Chan and
motormouth comic Chris Tucker. My review of the original stated "Tucker
slightly tones down his hyperactive, helium-voiced, in-your-face
chatter, making his character humorously abrasive rather than
insufferable. He's actually quite fun to watch as he talks his way in
and out of trouble, periodically breaking into a bizarre urban-Egyptian
form of dance and using leering effeminate movements to challenge other
males. I have no idea how Tucker developed his alien-on-amphetamines
shtick, but he's certainly one of a kind."
The bad news about "Rush Hour 2" is that Tucker doesn't tone down
anything this time around. The good news is that Jackie Chan's
performance is so strong that he makes up for the excesses of his
partner. To be fair, I should note that Tucker does have some effective
scenes. My favorite (SPOILER ALERT: The rest of this paragraph reveals
two jokes) takes place at a Las Vegas casino, where he attempts to draw
the attention of security by breaking into a strident rant accusing the
facility of racism. During his tirade, he announces that black people
have suffered the abuse of whites "for 362 years," which I believe marks
the first time anyone has ever pinned it down so precisely. Seconds
later, when a defensive white official denies that the casino is racist,
citing the fact that Lionel Richie is playing there, Tucker's character
shouts, "Lionel Richie? Lionel Richie hasn't been black since he left
the Commodores!"
If only the rest of his work was so consistently funny. There were times
when I wanted to climb into the screen, slap Tucker silly and force-feed
him Ritalin. Thank Goodness for the soothing presence of Jackie Chan,
who gets more charming with each passing year. His athletic abilities
are as strong as ever and his skill as an actor keeps improving, as does
his command of English.
The sequel opens in Hong Kong, where LAPD detective Carter (Tucker) is
vacationing with Chief Inspector Lee (Chan). Carter just wants to visit
with his friend and sample the exotic pleasures of the city, especially
the women. But the guys soon get caught up in a huge case. An explosion
at the American Embassy kills two U.S. Customs agents that had been
investigating smugglers trafficking in "superbills," extremely
high-grade counterfeit American $100 bills.
The main suspect in the bombing is Ricky Tan (John Lone), the suave
leader of the deadliest gang in China. Lee approaches the case with a
fervor, because Tan was once a Hong Kong police officer partnered with
Lee's father and was directly involved in his death. Lee and Carter's
pursuit of Tan leads them through a variety of colorful locations,
including a karaoke bar, a massage parlor and a yacht party on the
waters of Victoria Harbor. The massage parlor visit, by the way,
features a beautifully choreographed fight scene that ends with the
lawmen unceremoniously thrown bare-assed onto a busy city street.
The duo also must deal with Tan's right hand woman, Hu Li (Zhang Ziyi
from "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"), mega-rich hotel and casino owner
Steven Reign (comedian Alan King) and Isabella Molina (Roselyn Sanchez),
who is either an undercover U.S. agent or a turncoat aligned with Tan.
The chase takes Lee and Carter back to Los Angeles briefly and then on
to Las Vegas for the climax of the film, set on the Strip at the opening
of the Red Dragon Hotel and Casino.
At one point in the proceedings, I jotted "too much plot" in my
notebook, but the rousing finale suitably deals with all the elements
and characters raised in the story. And while Jackie Chan tosses off
lots of one-liners, he plays Lee's relationship with the man that killed
his father completely serious, which makes the plot seem like more than
just an excuse for jokes and stunts.
As with the vast majority of sequels, "Rush Hour 2" isn't as good as the
original, but it offers more than enough entertainment to warrant your
time and money (the riotous outtakes that run over the closing credits
are funnier than most of the films passing as comedies this summer). If
the series continues, and it certainly appears on track to do so, I hope
future installments focus more on the camaraderie between the leads and
less on their bickering. There are plenty of bureaucrats and bad guys
ripe for them to belittle, let the boys play nice with each other. Other
suggestions: Write stories that get both Lee and Carter emotionally
involved in the case, keep the jokes and imaginative fight scenes coming
and, for Pete's Sake, tone down Chris Tucker. Jackie Chan has proven his
ability to be humorous and serious in the same film, give Tucker the
opportunity to do the same.

Beginning right where the original left off, "Rush Hour 2" finds Hong Kong
Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) hosting his LAPD buddy James Carter's (Chris
Tucker) vacation while trying to break a counterfeiting ring that's just
bombed the U.S. Embassy.  While screenwriter Jeff Nathanson's plot pulls
in dual bad guys in Asian gang leader John Lone and L.A. magnate Alan King
and dual babes in Zhang Ziyi ("Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon") and
Puerto Rican beauty queen Roselyn Sanchez for the leads to tussle with,
director Brett Ratnor wisely keeps the focus on action and comedy over
story.
"Rush Hour 2" is one of those rare sequels that surpasses the original.
While breaking no original or artistic ground, the problems with the first
effort (over-emphasis on an unexciting plot and an imbalance between the two 
leads) have been fixed.
Chan and Tucker's non-PC repartee has been criticized for its reliance on
racial jokes, but its delivered with no ill will ('In Hong Kong, I'm Michael
Jackson and you're Toto' Chan garbles.  Later, presented with a bevy of
Asian beauties Tucker advises 'Never get in front of a black man in a buffet
line.'  Tucker's case-cracking advice to always 'follow the rich white man'
proves worth heeding in this film as well.).
Chan delivers his amazing stunts with his appealing charm yet again, but this
time Tucker holds his end up whether performing a hilarious karaoke rendition 
of 'Don't Stop Til You Get Enough' or getting directions from a non-English
speaking chicken vendor.  Tucker's climatic choreographed fight with Zhang
Ziyi is a comedic ballet, while Chan's given a potential love interest
(and plot mechanism for part 3) in Sandra Bullock lookalike Sanchez.  
Jeremy Piven is amusing as a flamboyantly gay Versace salesman and an
uncredited Don Cheadle ("Swordfish") plays straight man to Chan and Tucker as 
a Chinese restaurateur/martial artist.
"Rush Hour 2" is the first commercial summer movie that's actually
entertaining.  Make sure to stay for Jackie Chan's habitual end credit
outtakes and you should leave the theater with a smile on your face.
