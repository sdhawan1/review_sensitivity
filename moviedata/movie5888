"Deadly Voyage" is an HBO made-for-TV production.
Most people would consider the movie unwatchable
due to its grisly themes.  I can't say that I enjoyed
the film, but it made for compelling viewing.
'Intense' is perhaps the best adjective.  By the
end of the film, however, the story loses some
credibility, even if it is based on true events.
Omar Epps stars as Kingsley Ofusu, an African
who is a stowaway on a Russian ship bound for
France.  Along with eight other stowaways, he
is looking for a better life in a western country.
Meanwhile, France is seeking to curtail illegal
immigration, and fines shipping companies $45,000
for every stowaway that they unwittingly bring.
The stowaways are detected by the crew while the
ship is en route to France.  The weak-willed captain
(Joss Ackland) wants to treat them humanely, but gives
in to his scheming, ambitious officer Ion (Sean Pertwee)
who prefers murdering them and dumping their bodies
overboard.  Complicating matters, a suspicious, unfriendly
inspector (David Suchet) representing the shipping company
is on board.  The slaughtering must take place
without the inspector's knowledge.
What follows is a storyline similar to teen-oriented
slasher films, except the hunters are Russian sailors,
and the hunted are African stowaways.  It is clear
that racial hatred plays a role in the murders,
and only those with strong stomachs will be able
to finish this tense, humorless film.
What is the message of "Deadly Voyage"?  It is
Macbethian: amoral personal ambition left
unchecked can lead to the most evil actions.
A human life is worth far more than any
governmental fine.  Hopefully, the government
of France has since lowered the fines.
