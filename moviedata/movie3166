The advertising line on Spice Worlds poster reads: They cant
just sing. Which is news to me  because I never knew they could
sing anyway.
Having now seen their film, my opinion has differed considerably: the
obvious talent they possess in vocals and dance (not to mention their
looks) is what has earned them a position at the top of the music
industry.  Fortunately, acting was never part of the groups forte -
until now
Before the film started I was shocked - shocked I tell you, when I
realized that I had been suckered into a devious scheme to cram as
much advertising as possible into a two hour experience.  First came
the Polaroid Spice Cam, then the Impulse Spice Deodorant, and
when the film began it didnt even stop there.
For what else is Spice World than a movie length endorsement of this
mega popular group?  The soundtrack is from the groups latest album
(of the same name), and after seeing the movie who wouldnt want to
spice up their life? However, spicing up your life means slicing
up your wallet.  Its just a good thing that Spice World is more than
worth its admission price.
The group of five consists of Emma (Baby Spice), Geri (Ginger Spice),
Melanie B (Scary Spice), Victoria (Posh Spice) and Melanie C (Sporty
Spice).  Their clichi characters come through sharp and clear, and
although they are obviously exaggerated to suit the needs of fans and
mammoth commercialism, this is all the more fun.
The film follows the pressure, tension and adventure leading up to the
Spice Girls first live concert ever.  The girls are faced with their
own set of dilemmas, including making time for their pregnant friend
(of which they are the Godmothers of) and avoiding a nasty scheme to
split them up, concocted by a lunatic newspaper owner.  But the
documentary style of this film is almost deceiving - this is by no
means a serious or even accurate account of the girls experiences.
The biggest surprise in stall for viewers is the elements of tame
slapstick humor that Spice World welcomes with open arms, and
occasionally is not unlike what we have seen in films such as Austin
Powers or even Robin Hood: Men in Tights.  But whereas those films
based their entire plot around that kind of humor, Spice World
contains it as an added bonus  so the comedy aspect of this film
wont bore or patronize the audience.  Celebrities Richard E. Grant,
Meatloaf and Roger Moore help the plot move swiftly along its
entertaining ride of comedy and music.  As for the girls themselves;
their performances are naturally not of the highest standard, but
thankfully their acting time is limited and impressive dance/music
scenes occur numerously.  There is no doubt in my mind that the Spice
Girls were perfect characters for a movie ever since the start of
their career - Spice World knows this and often parodies that idea and
the sketchy structuring of the film.
During the movie girls are able to appreciate the music and
exaggerated personalities of their idols whilst the guys will have
more than a good time, as their eyes will no doubt wander across the
screen depending on where the Spice Girls are sitting, crouching or
dancing.
Its somewhat surprising that Spice World turned out to be such a
clever contraption of comedy and song, and whilst the obvious strength
of the movie is its fabulous music scenes, everything shown is sexy,
catchy and great fun for teens of both sexes.

Here we've got a really rare bird: a film so stupid it can't even make fun of
itself properly. You know a culture is in trouble when even its trash doesn't
stick to your mind.
SPICE WORLD may not be the worst big-name movie ever made -- I'm divided at
this point between SPECIES II and MONEY TRAIN, with NORTH in the running --
but it's not even a good crummy movie. It's just crummy. I kept begging for a
moment of some halfway genuine wit -- a mistake, a sneeze, a sense that they
just grabbed something and ran with it instead of staying with the script. No
such luck. That script, by the way, plays out like something they scratched
onto a soggy cocktail napkin at a producer's party.
Comparing this movie to A HARD DAY'S NIGHT would be a sinful mistake.  A HARD
DAY'S NIGHT was conceived as a quick exploitation package to cash in on the
Beatles' popularity, but two things happened: one, the Beatles stuck around
and became more important than anyone could have guessed; two, the movie was
brilliant. Neither exception applies to this film. We get performance
segments which are flimsy and witless, padded with revue-type material that
doesn't garner a single chuckle, and fistfuls of stuff shoveled in that dates
the movie horribly (like a dumb X-FILES gag, complete with halogen
flashlights). The Girls are also disturbingly untalented (again, unlike the
Beatles) -- there's five of them bleating away up there, and collectively
they don't even add up to ONE good singer.
Who are these girls, anyway? Despite their variegated appearances and
hairstyles, they're one indistinguishable pulpy blob. What frightens me the
most is that like so many other junk-food culture artifacts aimed at the
younger set -- the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or the Power Rangers -- there
aren't any real individuals in the group. There's just this kind of
amorphous, composite personality that they pass around between them, like the
three crones in Greek legend who all shared one eye. I hate reading a great
deal into pop-culture phenomena, but if the Spice Girls send a message of any
kind, it's twofold: that it's better to subordinate your personality to a
premanufactured group identity, and that trash not only sells, but
aggressively seeks its own level. Santayana once bemoaned America's love
affair with trash, and he noted that it wasn't the trash that bothered him,
but the love.
he film's most telling moment: Immediately after a performance, someone tells
the Girls, "That was perfect -- without actually being any good." Imagine
that. A moment of genuine insight, in the middle of this movie. Maybe there
is a God.

Talk about a movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters!
Spice World is the feature film debut of the pre-fabricated pop band,
The Spice Girls.  It's intended as a sort of Hard Day's Night, but ends
up simply hard to watch.
When watching the Spice Girls, I'm reminded of an old Saturday Morning
Cartoon trick (such as from The Smurfs, The Snorks, or Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles) in which identically animated creatures are
differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and a
different name.  The Spice Girls are themselves as interchangable as
Pringles, and about as talented.
There's Ginger (Geri Halliwell), the brainy one, Sporty (Melanie
Chisholm), the athletic one, Baby (Emma Bunton), the childish one, Posh
(Victoria Adams), the fashion-conscious one, and Scary (Melanie Brown),
the one with a tongue pierced back so far you're almost certain the post
sticks out her throat.
The film itself doesn't really have a plot.  It follows the girls as
they travel here and there, culminating at their "first live
performance" at Albert Hall.  The action, however, seems more like a
hodgepodge of mismatched ideas.
The various misfires include: an alien encounter, a fiendish tabloid
editor scheming to wreck The Spice Girls, the shooting of a Spice Girls
documentary, a movie producer (George Wendt) trying to pitch various
ideas for a Spice Girls movie (nearly all of which, though incredibly
far fetched, seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended
up), a meeting with a pregnant friend (whose sole purpose seems to be to
maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth
before the movie ends), a boating adventure, a bus race, club-hopping
(wherein apparently no one notices the famous Spice Girls among the
crowd...even when they start to sing), and an assorted number of musical
performances, press conferences, and general all-around celebrity
stuff.  Whew.
For some reason, the film is littered with star cameos.  From Elton John
to Elvis Costello, from Bob Hoskins to Meat Loaf.  Heck, even Roger
Moore shows up, though he can't decide if he's parodying himself as
James Bond, or if he's lobbying to be the reincarnation of Ernst Stavro
Blofeld. Richard E. Grant has the largest secondary part, a thankless
role of the band's manager, Clifford.
The celebrity spotting is partially amusing, and a decent way to pass
the time when confronted with the rest of the film.  Neither amusing or
spontaneous, when the Spice Girls are between songs they are deadly
boring.  Their songs are alright, but they play like lifeless
adaptations of the music videos.
My advice to fans is:  stay home and watch that video collection, or at
least spin that CD a couple of more times...either option will be more
enjoyable than the film.  Non-fans should know to stay well away from
this one.

I hate the Spice Girls.  I hate how their music is so catchy that it sticks
in your head for days after hearing it.  I hate how they promote "Girl
Power," yet they dress scantily and pose nude for horny pubescent teenage
boys.  And I hate how they're all over the place, even though they have no
real talent.  Why I saw this movie is a really, really, really long story,
but I did, and one would think I'd despise every minute of it.  But...
Okay, I'm really ashamed of it, but I enjoyed it.  I mean, I admit it's a
really awful movie, a wannabe "Hard Day's Night" (no pun intended), filled
with excuses for them to act wacky as hell, and to provide the locale for
the ninth floor of hell desginated for every single person willing to do a
cheap ass cameo in a cheap ass movie.  The plot is such a mess that it's
terrible.  But I loved it.  Why?  Well...
For those of you who still don't know, the Spice Girls are a quintet of
british bimbos who were recruited to be the next "big thing" in the pop
scene world, and therefore sing really iritating songs that are
nevertheless catchy (after I first heard "Wannabe," I tried to get a
labotomy to remove the section of my brain that remembers every painful
note).  About a year after conquering America, releasing the number one
album of last year, they have a movie in an effort to make them the
faux-Beatles.
But their first movie is hardly "A Hard Day's Night," even if it lifts a
lot from it and drops it into their movie.  Here's a basic sketch of the
plot and see if it sounds familiar: the girls o' spice have a big concert
at Albert Hall, and the film chronicles a wacky week in their life prior to
this gig, including press conferences filled with boring people, boisterous
escapes from their schedule, a big cliff-hanger over whether they'll make
their concert or not, and bitching from their nervous manager Clifford
(Richard E. Grant).  Now, the plot of "A Hard Day's Night:" the Beatles
have a big concert and the film chronicles a wacky couple days in their
life prior to this gig, including press conferences filled with boring
people, boisterous escapes from their schedule, a big cliff-hanger over
whether they'll make their concert or not, and a lot of bitching from a
nervous TV manager, played by Victor Spinetti.
Of course, "Spice World" also lifts a lot from the second, wackier (and
funnier) film, "Help!," which was so weirdly comical, and so incoherent
that it was almost more enjoyable but hardly artier.  "Spice World" lifts a
lot from this one, including some wacky sub plots (one includes a sneaky
photographer played by Riff Raff himself, Richard O'Brien, trying to dig up
anything bad about them for a newspaper who wants to print bad news about
them), a surreal living style (how big is the inside of their bus?), and
some really weirdly funny sequences that may go way over the head of its
target audience (how many Spice Girls fans will understand the dream
sequence starring Hugh Laurie as a faux-Poirot?).
But what the film forgets is that "A Hard Day's Night" was deceptively
brilliant, and wonderfully organized, while "Help!" found the Beatles after
this more artier film and gave them the liscence to just go completely
wacky (Paul McCartney confessed that the plot of the film was determined by
which foreign places they wanted to visit).  "Spice World" tries to combine
these two elements, and comes out snake eyes with both of them.
This doesn't mean that this film is a disaster.  I, who hate the Spice
Girls, do confess that their best quality is their energy, and second is
their sense of humor.  They may suck musically and all, but at least they
don't take themselves seriously, and do what it is they do with a lot of
energy placed into it.  Songs like "Wannabe" and "Spice Up Your Life" are
awful tunes, but when seeing them performed they seem better due to what
the girls put into the act.  In this film, they do the same thing.
The film is really just a series of comic skits, some which are pretty bad,
and a lot which are pretty hilarious and admittingly joyful.  I couldn't
get into a bit where they escaped on a boat, or another one where they were
getting dance lessons from a hard-assed fruity army man (nice idea,
though), but bits like a movie idea proposed by the hilarious ex-"Kid in
the Hall" man Mark McKinney (currently rotting on "SNL") about a film
called "Spice Force Five" left me in stitches.  And the finale where they
try to make it to their concert is hilarious, only because as they're doing
this it is being narrated by McKinney to a suicidial Clifford.
Also, I found myself liking each of the Spice Girls.  I might hate their
act, but I couldn't help kinda loving all of them.  They're very likable
people, and each of them is presented with a distinct personality.  They
command the film nicely, making up for any really big problems with the
film itself.  And, my god, the cameos in this film!  This is fun just to
spot all the celebrity turn-ups, including Meat Loaf as a bus driver,
Shakespearean actor Richard Briers as a bishop, british comic actor Stephen
Fry as a condemning lawyer (getting the film's funniest line), Elvis
Costello as a bartender, and Roger Moore as "The Chief," the omniscent man
upstairs who strokes a pig, and spouts out numerous aphorisms to comic
effect (I think I'm the only critic who liked him).  And I can't be the
only one who just didn't recognize Bob Geldof at first, can I?  Or the one
who didn't automatically realize that the fat head of the villainous
newspaper (Barry Humphries) is really Dane Edna sans dress?
When I left "Spice World" it was the exact opposite of what happened when I
went in - which was "I cannot fucking believe I paid $7.50 to see 'Spice
World!'"  I came out with a big grin on my face, as I had seen a tacky yet
hysterical little flick that had won me over soon into its 93 minute
run-time.  Though I'm really not sure I'd ever see it again (at least for
any amount of cash - I mean, for $7.50 I coulda seen it thrice at a
suburbanite theater), it held my attention span for its full lenght, and
entertained me.  I know I'll be figuritively crucified for giving this film
a positive review, but it did manage to entertain me and by the finale, I
did like the Spice Girls a lot more than I did when I went in.  And that's
probably all those girls really really wanted (sorry for the bad joke).

     In the press kit for the Spice Girls' first movie, SPICEWORLD, the
girls are called "the most famous people on the planet at the moment,"
by actor Alan Cumming.  Although others might rank the President of the
United States, the Pope, or others higher, it is undeniable that the
Spice Girls have become a sensation in the recording world.
     With fame comes the chance for more fame.  And as with the Beatles
did before them, the Spice Girls have been given their own movie to
star in.  Too bad their celluloid debut could not have been in a better
movie, but since they worked on the idea for the story, they have
themselves partly to blame.
     For non-fans some advice is in order.  The movie's lackluster
beginning may convince you, as it did the guy behind me, that the movie
might be a good time to catch up on your sleep.  Hang in there, though,
because the girls' undeniable charm will begin to work its magic on you
as it did me.
     The show has two distinct parts -- singing and non-singing.  Kim
Fuller's script for the latter feels as though it were thrown together.
Sometimes the jokes work, but too often they are hopelessly lame.  The
highly energetic vocal numbers, of which there should have been more,
pulsate with energy.
     The relatively confusing story concerns rival groups that are
making and proposing to make movies about the Spice Girls.  The movies
include a straightforward documentary and a variety of other pictures
such as SPICE FORCE 5 -- think of the action figure possibilities.
     The film's humor works best at its most self-deprecating.
Ensconced in a spooky old mansion, all the girls except one have the
same nightmare about losing their heads.  The one with the scariest
dream of all visualizes losing not her head but her make-up.
     Another sequence pokes fun at the group's popularity.  When one of
the girls answers a reporter's rhetorical question with, "Is the Pope
Catholic?," she unleashes a media circus.  Scandalous headlines report
on the girl's questioning of the Pope's belief in Catholicism.
     Roger Moore, among other stars, take on small roles in the
picture.  He plays their babbling chief who strokes his pet pig as he
utters his enigmatic homilies.  ("The headless chicken can only know
where he's been.  He can't see where he's going.")
     Richard E. Grant plays the group's merciless manager.  "You don't
have a life," he barks at them.  "You have a schedule."  Life's hard
when you're a multi-millionaire member of a rock group.
     With Grenville Horner's multicolored set designs and editor Andrea
MacArthur's colorful spiral-swirl scene transitions, the images are
inviting even when the story isn't.
     "Did anyone care if Marilyn Monroe could act?"  George Wendt,
playing a fictitious producer, asks.  "All they cared was, 'was she in
focus?'"  Can the Spice Girls act?  You can judge for yourself.  What
is clear is that they can certainly have a good time.  The silly show's
high-spirited frivolity does eventually win you over mainly due to the
inherent charm of its stars.
     The show ends in London's Albert Hall with a concert that rocks.
Stick around afterwards as the girls will be talking directly to you
during the cute closing credits.
     SPICEWORLD runs a fast 1:30.  It is rated PG for light profanity
and a little sexual innuendo.  The show would be fine for kids around
seven and up although they may need to be older to be interested.

OK, I admit it--I find camp amusement with the Spice Girls.  Yes, the same
Spice Girls of the gimmicky individual "identities," they of the annoyingly
infectious bubblegum pop hooks and cheesy unifying mantra of "Girl Power."
But not even their guilty pleasure appeal isn't enough to carry their big
screen debut, a junky mess which would be more aptly named Shite World than
Spice World.
The film begins amusingly enough, with a cheeky 007-esque title sequence
in which the British quintet--"Scary" (Melanie Brown), "Baby" (Emma
Bunton), "Sporty" (Melanie Chisolm), "Ginger" (Geri Halliwell), and "Posh"
(Victoria Adams)--are introduced one by one (to, much to my surprise,
excited and only slightly mocking cheers from the press audience) as they
croon the silky ballad "Too Much" (a tune that would sound right at home in
an actual James Bond film).  A few minutes and an Elton John cameo later
comes an introductory tour of the numerous plotlines that run through the
film: (1) the Spicy ones go on a European publicity tour leading up to
their first live concert at London's Royal Albert Hall; (2) a film producer
(George Wendt) and a screenwriter (Mark McKinney) pitch various film ideas
to the Girls' manager, Clifford (Richard E. Grant); (3) a documentary film
crew follows the Girls; (4) a pregnant "mate" (Naoki Mori) of the group
rapidly approaches her due date; and (5) a tabloid publisher (Barry
Humphries) attempts to destroy the group with the help of a sneaky
shutterbug (Richard O'Brien).  Capped off by a live rendition of the Girls'
bouncy hit "Say You'll Be There," a wealth of laughs and merriment is sure
to follow, right?
Wrong.  It's all downhill from there as Spice World collapses into a
series of misfired comedy sketches.  I must give the Girls credit for their
refreshing willingness to make fun of themselves, but writer Kim Fuller and
director Bob Spiers can barely come up with a funny joke between them, much
less a organized framework for all the "wacky" goings-on.  Spice World
jumps from vignette to vignette, subplot to subplot with no direction and
little sense, at one minute having the Girls meet with aliens (no joke) and
at another having them stage a daring rescue of two young fans who fall
into the water during a boat ride.  While a decent joke slips through the
cracks here and there--during a "dance bootcamp" scene, the Girls sing the
lyric "We know how we got this far/Strength and courage and a
Wonderbra"--much of the material is not even funny on the chuckle level.
Some gags are just plain pointless, such as Roger Moore's recurring role as
the mysterious Chief, who dispenses cryptic, metaphor-heavy advice to
Clifford.  The only reason why I can think anyone would find that funny is
the fact that Moore once played James Bond.  Ha ha.
As weak as the script is, I think there's one insurmountable problem with
even attempting to make a Spice Girls movie, and that is the Girls
themselves.  The point is not that they can't act (and, for the record,
they really _can't_) but that their individual personas, which works as a
gimmick over the span of a four-minute music video, are too thin to survive
outside of the truncated, video bite MTV world.  Posh (who garnered the
most enthusiastic cheers during the introductions) comes off best by
default because her persona (rich bitch) most easily translates into
character in a film.  Baby's persona (young innocent), to a lesser extent,
also works, but the remaining Girls' identities are a little harder to
flesh out.  There really isn't much to do with Sporty besides having her
exercise every so often (which is _exactly_ what Fuller and Spiers do),
and, after all, what exactly entails being "Ginger" or "Scary"?
Apparently, just their wardrobes.
Spice World manages to pick up some steam in the late going following a
flashback performance of the Spices' signature hit, "Wannabe."  The song is
as grating as ever, but the energy of the number gives the proceedings a
much-needed shot in the arm, setting the stage for a wave of
self-referential humor stemmed from the screenwriters' film ideas (the film
almost mirrors Robert Altman's The Player in the way the film snails into
itself).  This section of the film, involving all manner of derring-do
involving a speeding bus, is perhaps its most effective, but it also points
up how all the other storylines (the publisher, the documentary crew) lack
a satisfactory payoff.
Spice World is harmless entertainment suitable for the entire family, and
it will please the Spice faithful.  But this sloppy enterprise surely won't
win them any new fans, which is what the group sorely needs to bolster its
rapidly waning Girl Power in the States.  Once the hype disappears, Spice
World will likely serve as the the Spices' final hurrah in America.

SPICE WORLD (1998)

McKenney, Bob Hoskins, Meat Loaf, Elvis Costello
Written by: Kim Fuller
Directed by: Bob Spiers
Running Time: 93 minutes
My Rating: ** out of *****
"Spice World" is just one long promotional film for the British girl band
The Spice Girls. Sure there's a hint of humor in there every once in a
while. Actually, there's a couple of pretty good jabs AT The Spice Girls.
But overall, who cares? Not me.
If you don't know by now, The Spice Girls sing songs of love and friendship
and responsibility and girl power, yet dress like streetwalkers from a lower
middle class neighborhood. In "Spice World" they ride around in their big
tour bus, whining about having to do photo shoots and give interviews.
Amazingly, all the talk they do about keeping commitments and upholding
responsibilities only really applies to fun things, things they WANT to do,
not things they are required to do to keep earning money. And they keep
babbling about "girl power" when they should really be talking about
"cleavage power". I mean, if all it takes is girl power, then why are they
only one thread away from bursting out of their skimpy outfits? The film is
PG, but really with only some very minor dialogue changes and scene
extentions, you'd have yourself one raunchy adult film.
By the way, there's something in the opening credits which says "Based on an
idea by The Spice Girls". Wow, they got idea credit! I certainly wish that
was a new trend in Hollywood... giving credit for simply having the thought
"Say girls, let's make a movie!"
The supporting cast fares well. Roger Moore (the real James Bond) mockingly
plays the cliche-spewing "Chief" of The Spice Girls, and darn it all, he's
fun to watch. Mark McKenney also is good as a screenwriter trying to pitch
film ideas to the band's manager (Richard E. Grant). One question though:
George Wendt?
You'd think that "Spice World" would envoke one of two reactions in people.
If you like the Spice Girls, you'll like them even more afterwards. And if
you can't stand them (like me), then "Spice World" will really make you
sick. Oddly, the audience I saw the film with, roughly 50 twelve year-old
girls, sat in silence for the entire film. Well, not the two who sat
directly behind me. They kept muttering "This is stupid" over and over
again. Maybe there is hope for humanity after all. [PG]

Cast: The Spice Girls, Alan Cummings, George Wendt, Richard E. Grant, 
      Claire Rushbrook, Roger Moore.
Directed by Bob Spiers
        I am a Spice Girls fan, and am one of the few over eighteen who 
will admit that they indeed do have talent.  Part of the Spice Girl 
backlash is that many feel they are simply pretty faces and became 
extremely popular extremely fast.  I have no problem with that, yet they 
can sing, and their songs are enjoyable.  They are entertainers, not a 
band, so in my mind, they do not have to play instruments to be 
legitimate.  
        Can they act though and do they deserve a movie?  This could only 
be proven by watching "Spice World," which I did, and enjoyed 
considerably.  Of course its silly and is not a filmmaking clinic, but it 
does what some of what are considered great films have failed to do: 
entertain.
        To answer my first question, some Spice Girls are better actors 
than others, and the winner of most-talented Spice Girl goes to Melanie 
Chisholm (Sporty Spice).  Her distinctive voice is highlighted in the 
song "Too Much," and is peppered throughout the rest.  Yet, she can 
really act, as well, to the point where it felt as if she was being more 
than just a Spice Girl.  Among the others, Melanie Brown (Scary Spice) 
and Geri Halliwell (Ginger Spice) act well, and Emma Bunton (Baby Spice) 
and Victoria Addams (Posh Spice) were given lesser roles in the scheme of 
things.  You can really feel their bond and comfort with each other.
        The plot basically takes us through the follies of the girls as 
they go from rehearsals to press conferences to one final big live show.  
Members of the press try to ruin them, and their managers are put to the 
test trying to keep things together.  The tabloid run by Kevin McMaxford 
(Barry Humphries) is the weak link in this, as they try to show his evil 
through visual effects of thundering galestorms and streams of spittle as 
he talks.  The managers, played adeptly by Richard E. Grant (Portrait of a 
Lady) to ridiculous extremes and Claire Rushbrook (Secrets and Lies) create
some on-screen chemistry that Grant thwarts each time he talks to her.  Roger 
Moore plays an omnipotent producer known as The Chief who carries on sight 
gags and  mixes his cliches a la "Naked Gun."
        Other appearances are made by George Wendt (Cheers) as a film 
producer and Alan Cummings (Circle of Friends, Emma) as a documentarian 
who both attempt to make films of the Spice Girls and their travails.  
What is churned out is a film about the making of a film about a film in 
which the Spice Girls are the main attraction.  The Spice Girls sing 
their tunes to the delight of fans, stringing in what are essentially 
four or five music videos.  
        The Spice Girls show they are not all work when they help out a 
pregnant friend (Naoko Mori) who missed the Spice boat, but who supported 
them when they just got started.  Cameos by Elton John, Elvis Costello, 
and Bob Geldolf are thrown in, but the movie is at its strongest when the 
girls themselves are on screen.
        I was expecting it to be dumb, but there was even some adult 
humor in there that kept me going, and it never disappointed me.  If 
you're a fan, you'll enjoy the movie.  If you're not, then don't go, 
because we don't need to hear yet another person mocking them because 
that is the popular thing to do.

starring Mel B., Mel C., Emma, Geri, Victoria, Richard E. Grant
written by Kim Fuller directed by Bob Spiers
Spice World is critic-proof. What kind of person would read a review
for this film before going to see it? The young, teenaged girls in
attendance on Friday afternoon certainly weren't concerned with
Ebert's assessment (he already declared it the worst film of
1998). Let's boil it down: if you like the Spice Girls, you will see
the movie. If you don't like the Spice Girls, you will not see the
movie. If there are such people out there heming and hawing over
whether or not to see this flick, read on.
The Spices, alternately known as Scary, Sporty, Baby, Ginger, and
Posh, respectively, are at the peak of their fame: the papers can't
get enough of them, the fans follow them through the streets, and
there isn't a day off in sight. It is because of this that the
backlash begins, and it's up to harried manager Grant to ward off bad
press, with assistance from a double-talking, animal loving mystery
man at the top (hilariously played by Roger Moore, relishing the
chance to mock Blofeld, James Bond's greatest villain). Meanwhile, two
Hollywood producers (played by George Wendt and Mark McKinney) are
keen to plug the girls into a big-budget movie.
The film unfolds over a one-week period in the girls' lives, during
which they also encounter aliens, a haunted house, and a tour bus
wired to explode. Director Bob Spiers, who helmed every hilarious
episode of the BBC's "French & Saunders", has a considerably less
talented main cast to work with here (let's say the Spice Girls do not
possess crack comic timing), and his attempt to fill out the remaining
roles with old pros is only somewhat successful, due to Fuller's
juvenile screenplay. But when things turn surreal--a downpour in an
office, the alien encounter--Spiers is just the man for the job, and
without him the movie could have been entirely witless. And the girls
are at least likeable, although they're better taken in small doses. I
felt after this film spoiled on too much dime-candy.
Spice World ultimately could use more edge. The Spice Girls' image has
been softened over time--when they first appeared, for instance, they
were frank and unsparing in their sex talk--and the movie
complies. While the filmmakers do poke fun at them, it is with a
gloved finger. There is nothing biting about this mockumentary (if one
can call it that); if it were a Spice World, after all, the world
would be very bland indeed.

Why do people hate the Spice Girls?  What exactly have they done wrong, 
other than perhaps offend the Fashion Police?  So what if they are not 
"great" singers---they ain't singing opera, folks, its pop music!  Who 
exactly IS a "great" singer? 
Judging by that opening paragraph it is obvious that I like the Spice 
Girls.  They do what they do--sing some catchy tunes--and they do it 
pretty well.  They are able to carry that into their first film, "Spice 
World".  "Spice World" certainly isn't a great filmgoing experience. . . 
what it is what the Spice Girls are all about: fun, songs, and a lot of 
"Girl Power!" 
Drawing from a number of different films (like the Beatles' "Hard Day's 
Night") "Spice World" chronicles the week heading up to the Girls' first 
concert at London's Albert Hall.  They get to tool around London in a 
big ol' bus (driven by Meat Loaf!) and generally have fun.  In order to 
through a semblence of plot into the film, there is an evil tabloid 
publisher played by Barry Humphries, better known to Americans, for 
about 15 minutes, as Dame Edna (remember her?)  He wants to sabotage the 
Girls' concert so he can sell papers. 
Of course, the point in a movie like "Spice World" isn't plot.  The 
center of the film is the Spice Girls themselves: Ginger (the recently 
departed Geri Haliwell), Posh (Victoria Adams), Sporty (Melanie 
Chisolm), Scary (Melanie Brown), and Baby (Emma Bunton).  Each one has 
their own personality and, perhaps the best part of the film, look like 
they are having some honest-to-goodness fun, something that can't be 
said for a lot of people in films today. 
Along for the ride are Richard E. Grant as their manager, Clifford, and 
various other characters making quick cameo appearances (including 
teriffic British actors like Richard Briers and Stephen Fry).  And, 
every once and a while, Roger Moore pops up as The Chief to spout odd 
koans (added bonus: he gets to, in the words of Craig Kilborn, dance, 
dance, dance.) 
Watching this film was fun, for the most part.  There are a few slow 
segments, but overly, director Bob Spiers keeps things moving at a quick 
pace, with plenty of hummable Spice Girls songs in the background.  His 
camerawork is fairly pedestrian, though the final concert number is done 
quite well with effective use of editing.   
The look of the film promotes the high fun, with the design of the 
SpiceBus being quite original and eye-catching.  Add in wall-to-wall 
Spice Girls music and this film is lovable romp.  If you don't like the 
Spice Girls, you won't change your mind with this film.  But, if you 
find them at least tolerable, get ready to sit back and chill because 
the Spice Girls are here to entertain you. . . and do it QUITE well.  
"Spice World" (1998).  Directed by Bob Spiers.  Written by Kim Fuller. 
 Music by the Spice Girls.  With Geri Halliwell, Victoria Adams, Melanie 
Chisolm, Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton, Richard E. Grant, Claire Rushbrook, 
Roger Moore.  Distributed by Columbia Pictures.  Running time: 92 
minutes.  Rated: PG.  Available on Home Video.

SPICE WORLD is like a jigsaw puzzle in reverse: you start with the completed 
picture and then dismantle it piece by piece, revealing how the whole thing 
was locked together to begin with.  It's an obvious metaphor for film 
criticism, but with a textbook example such as this, there is very little 
beyond the obvious.  The same processes for its criticism are responsible 
for its creation ; you can almost hear the production meetings behind every 
scene.
For a brief period near the end of the 90s, the five-girl pop group Spice 
Girls saw a meteoric rise to fame and fortune  would that shooting star 
have turned out to have been more akin to Halley's instead of the 
Shoemaker-Levy they might have lasted longer before plunging back down into 
the atmosphere just as suddenly  garnering legions of young fans and 
saturating the mass media with their visages and, occasionally, music.  As 
with any other product, the group was marketed with a slogan, Girl Power' 
and the Girls themselves were similarly packaged with the epithets Sporty, 
Angry, Ginger, Baby and Posh.  It's the same strategy that worked with the 
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (substitute monikers for colors), and is aimed 
at pretty much the same age range, so why not?  It was only a matter of time 
when a Spice Girls movie was going to arrive on the scene, and just as 
inevitable that it would open itself up to criticism from those who were 
fast wearying of the group.  Using the tried and true template of the 
Beatles' A HARD DAYS NIGHT, SPICE WORLD follows the misadventures of the 
five Spices and their harried manager as they prepare for a big show.
Having established a pretty basic formula, the next decision of the 
film-makers was to ward off the expected criticism of the girls' images and 
the likely transience of their fame by getting their own scripted potshots 
in first.  The overall tone of the piece isn't self-deprecating enough to 
pull this off, although ironically the predictions of girls leaving the 
group, falling pregnant and failing to maintain the heights of their chart 
success did come true within a couple of years of the film's release.  
Instead we are left with the rather curious sight of the real' Spice Girls 
playing the characters of the Spice Girls who are trying to break out of 
their media conceptions and into the real' Spice Girls.  In the long term, 
we're left with no more insight in their feature than one of their music 
videos, and those who have never seen the five performers before will be 
hard pressed to see what the fuss was about or even to differentiate them.  
As far as the film is concerned, one is a bit more working class' than the 
others, one rolls her eyes a lot, one sucks a lollipop, one seems sulkily 
detached, and one has ginger hair.  If you need to learn more, tune into the 
wonderful music trivia show POP-UP VIDEO.
SPICE WORLD is so dedicated to distracting attention from itself that it 
fabricates an abundance of subplots and throws in a huge number of cameos  
the old tactic of endorsing a celebrity product by surrounding it with those 
who already have credibility (Jonathon King, Elvis Costello, Jools Holland 
and others).  The camera is almost afraid to linger on any one member of the 
group, so the dialogue becomes a string of one-liners.  Meanwhile, dance 
routines and songs drift in and out of the story, the Girls jump from one 
unrelated scene to the next and for a finale the film starts spoofing its 
own status as a vehicle for the group.  By its very nature SPICE WORLD is 
consumed quickly and then forgotten.  It's not a bad film (has anybody ever 
tried to watch that Pet Shop Boys movie more than once?), it's just that it 
was never possible for it to be particularly good.
As SPICE WORLD is primarily an exercise in promotion it would make criticism 
on cinematic grounds redundant (doubly so when you consider that its target 
audience of youngsters would not be the type to even read reviews) unless 
the purpose of the act was to be seen as providing a record of a cultural 
phenomenon.  Will the 12-year old girls who saw this movie in 1997 be 
reading the reviews out of interest or nostalgia many years later?  It looks 
as though even the Spice Girls read their demographic wrong: as the film's 
credits roll, Mel B stares into the camera lens and says decisively to the 
other members of the group that the audience is about to leave the cinema 
and go to the pub.  Hardly.

Cast Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton, Melanie Chisholm, Geri Haliwell,
Victoria Addams, Richard E. Grant, Alan Cumming, Roger Moore. Written by
Jamie Curtis, Kim Fuller. Directed by Bob Spiers
Let's begin by saying that I am not a fan of the SPICE GIRLS. I don't
know their names, and after watching this movie I still don't know their
names. However, for the sake of posterity, there's the blonde one who
likes fluffy toys, the red haired one with big boobs, the dark skinned
one fixated with hair, the dark haired one fixated with clothes and the
other dark haired one who does somersaults ...... and they can all sing
even if they can't act. Strangely this tact works because the girls are
being themselves and they want us to laugh at them, if not with them.
So I laughed at them and for all the wrong reasons. This screwy, corn
ball, wacky, silly movie is very pretentious and very them. The most
annoying part of the SPICE experience was waiting in line with two
hundred screaming adolescents, shoving and pushing their way into the
cinema. Embarrassingly, I laughed at all the silly jokes and they
didn't, but surprisingly I actually enjoyed myself. Maybe I'm just a
sucker for tacky British humour, but if I could rename the movie it
would be CARRY ON SPICE.
So who are the SPICE GIRLS? If you've seen the series SEVEN UP, they are
reminiscent of the three working class girls who end up pregnant,
divorced and obese 21 years later. I'm not in any way implying that this
will befall SPICE, but my theory is - in their twenties they look like
Marilyn, when they're forty they'll look like Roseanne. Imagine a cow
trying to chew grass and recite lines at the same time, well that's how
SPICE GIRLS speak.
The cameo appearances made by who's who of British song and screen is
one of this movie's highlights. To think they showed support and rallied
to the aid of the girls continues to baffle me. But if money can buy
loyalty, then the girls have plenty of that. The other main roles worth
mentioning are Roger Moore who gets to play with animals, and a
hysterical Richard E. Grant who manages the girls. Add to this some
London sight seeing, a SPICE BUS, an evil media baron, scenes copied
from SPEED, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, GREASE, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS; throw in
themes about motherhood, pregnancy, friendship and loyalty and you have
the volatile cocktail that is SPICE WORLD  you'll either hate it or
love it.

 If you were to make up a mock Top-40 chart of all the movies ever made
featuring pop stars, the Spice Girls' "Spice World" would fit in well below
Prince's "Purple Rain" and several notches above Peter Frampton and the Bee
Gees' ghastly, overblown "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band." "Spice
World," directed by Bob Spiers of "Absolutely Fabulous" fame, is at the very
least unpretentious, with only one item on its agenda: to sell the Spice
Girls in a lavish 93-minute commercial. The group's many detractors may be
dismayed to discover the Girls have a winning sense of humor about
themselves, their image and their art. To borrow a line from a pop princess
of the past, these Girls just want to have fun, and sometimes the good humor
they generate is contagious.
 Although the model for "Spice World" would seem to be the Beatles' film
debut "A Hard Day's Night," the film most closely resembles the 1967
obscurity "Good Times," which attempted to launch Sonny and Cher as a
big-screen team. The concept behind "Good Times" had the duo enacting
fantasies about the kind of movie they'd like to star in, while, in the real
world, they negotiated to get out of acting in a picture they knew wasn't
right for them. What little plot "Spice World" has consists of filmmakers
Mark McKinney and George Wendt pitching script ideas to Clifford (Richard E.
Grant) , the Spice Girls' fictitious manager. At the same time, a
documentary crew headed by Alan Cumming is trying to get the real story
behind the hype, and the quintet of Girls are struggling to balance their
loyalty to old friends with the demands of world-wide superstardom.
 What sets "Spice World" apart from most rock movies is its ambivilent
attitude toward fame. Each of the Spices --Baby, Posh, Ginger, Scary and
Sporty, and yes, you will be able to identify each of them by the end of the
film-- seem to realize Spicemania won't last forever and the inevitable
reversal of fortune is coming. "In the old days, it was 'where's our next
meal coming from?'," says Baby Spice in one of the film's few quiet moments.
"Now, it's 'where's our next single going to?'."
 Still, this is hardly a scathing expose of the music scene. Much of "Spice
World" consists of the Girls' performances of revamped versions of "Say
You'll Be There" and "Wannabe," as well as their current tunes, such as the
shout-it-out salsa number "Spice Up Your Life" and the endearingly
doo-wopish "Too Much." Like the film's comedy, the music is not always
consistently good but it is consistently loud.
 Years from now, "Spice World" will undoubtedly serve as a colorful reminder
of a pop phenomenon, and that seems to be all it ever intended to be. "That
was absolutely perfect without actually being any good," a music director
tells the group after a false start on one of their songs. The same review
applies to "Spice World."

Spiceworld -- Despite the spicy title, it's a rather vanilla movie, all
things considered.  If you're not a fan of the Girls, let me save you an
hour and a half of saffron: don't waste your thyme on this one.  However,
if you don't hate them, or (like me) you think they're just plain savory,
some sage advice is to cumin get it while it's still hot... due to chili
reviews by cloves-minded critics, I cayenne see this bay-sically
good-hearted flick tarragon from theaters before too long, parsley because
the anti-Spice movement is inexplicably strong these days.  The plot (what
little there is), doesn't have too many leeks in it, and follows the girls
through a series of capers they experience on the way to their first live
show (which will turn out to be a lemon if the villain and his kelpers get
their way).  Peppered with silliness and grrl power, I was really arrow
rooting for Our Heroes by the end of the movie.  In particularly odd
moments, Roger Moore shows his salt and earns his celery in an odd turn
that most closely resembles a particular James Bond villain, anise no
surprise when he shows up feeding a pig with a baby bottle.  Throwing
caraway, the Girls' on-screen manager is so hilariously bitter and uptight
that one would expect him to bleed vinegar.  Dill, despite some
shortcomings (none of the humor was laugh-out-loud funny), it's clear the
girls fenneled all they could (and they mint what they said) into their
project, and while it mace seem strange to some, I found their enthusiasm
suited me to a tea.  Soy sue me, I liked it.
Overall, though I'm destined not to curry favor from others for this
review, I'd gingerly recommend this movie, if for no other reason than
it's allspice, and kept a goofy smile on my face the whole time.  Cassia
later.

Cast: Victoria Adams; Melanie Brown; Emma Bunton; Melanie Chisholm; Geri

Director: Bob Spiers 
Screenplay: Kim Fuller 
Hello. My name is Jamie, and I'm a Spiceaholic. Well, not really. Let's 
just say I'm a casual fan of the Spice Girls; I know they're not too deep 
or challenging, but their British bubblegum bounce is good enough to keep 
me on the stairmaster for a long while. (And, a definite plus, group 
members Geri "Ginger Spice" Halliwell, Emma "Baby Spice" Bunton, Melanie 
"Sporty Spice" Chisholm, Victoria "Posh Spice" Adams and Melanie "Scary 
Spice" Brown are all easy on the eyes.) I fearlessly admit that I'm 
familiar with their music, and now I'm familiar with "Spice World," their 
feature film debut, as well. A kind of hybrid between "A Hard Day's 
Night," "Clueless" and the "Naked Gun" movies, "Spice World" isn't quite 
tasty, nor does it leave you with a bad case of indigestion. It's alright, 
but I'd probably rather be on the stairmaster listening to them than sit 
through their movie again. 
There isn't much of a story here, as "Spice World" is basically a series 
of interchangeable, scattershot skits and spoofs stuck between some 
adequately spirited musical numbers. The movie is framed around a hectic 
couple of days for the girls, as they ready themselves for a big concert 
in England. Along the way, there are dozens of potential comedic 
catastrophes -- a documentarian (Alan Cumming) trails the group endlessly, 
a pregnant pal (Naoko Mori) prepares to give birth and sleazy tabloid 
types conspire the end of the Spice Girls for good, all while a 
mysterious, T.J. Eckelberg-like figure (Roger Moore) watches from above. 
And of course Posh, Baby, Scary, Ginger and Sporty are in just about every 
scene, talking about clothes, guys and "girl power" whenever they aren't 
singing. 
Perhaps the big question mark here is regarding the Spice Girls' acting 
capabilities, but I'm not too sure of the answer. They're not thespians 
(hey, neither were the Beatles), but they boast a perky, self-depreciating 
buoyance that's sort of difficult to deny. The rest of the cast is nice 
enough to acknowledge that this isn't their show, with George Wendt and 
Mark McKinney getting the best bits as American filmmakers on a quest to 
convince the quintet to make their American movie debut. Meatloaf seems to 
be cast as their tour driver simply so he can make groan-inducing 
allusions to his album playlists, while weird Richard E. Grant ("Bram 
Stoker's Dracula"), as the Spice Girls' manager, is decked out in so many 
emerald suits he looks like a refugee from Oz. And those familiar with the 
British entertainment scene will note sometimes-clever, sometimes-not 
cameos by the likes of Bob Geldof, Stephen Fry, Bob Hoskins and Jennifer 
Saunders. 
The fundamental problem with "Spice World" is an even hit-or-miss gag 
ratio. For every moment that scores (a hilarious faux-movie trailer for an 
action flick called "Spice Force Five"), there's one that comes close to 
embarrassment (the ladies' impromptu performance of their hit "Wannabe" in 
a coffee shop-flashback). The best sequences arguably come whenever the 
Spice Girls are holed up inside their tour bus, which is modeled after the 
British flag. They poke the most fun at themselves here; watch each's 
reaction when one whines that the media has a tendency to stereotype them 
too often. Around the 45-minute mark, things seem to screech to a halt, 
certainly not helped by a dwindling sense of humor (what's up with that 
goofy labor scene?) or stuff that's just too stupid to work (what's up 
with that dopey alien encounter?). At least the film is capped-off nicely 
with a vibrant live rendition of their current tune "Spice Up Your Life." 
"Spice World" definitely isn't going to win any of the gals' detractors 
over, and it isn't likely to sway those who are neutral one way or the 
other. Those seeking a message or any kind of social relevance had better 
look elsewhere; the closest "Spice World" comes to either of those is a 
sequence that illustrates the dangers of driving a bomb-equipped bus in 
stiletto heels. It's an hour-and-a-half of brainless comedy and music, 
starring five pleasant-looking pop divas who don't seem to fear 
self-parody. And that's presumably all that die-hard Spice fans really, 
really want.

How do you judge a film that is so bad, but intentionally so? In SPICEWORLD,
the highly popular singing group the Spice Girls accomplish their major goal:
mocking themselves with a purposely cheezy film and having a lot of fun doing
it. If that was their goal, they did a fantastic job. So is it fair to give it
such a low grade when it wasn't really meant to be much better than this?
Honestly, I'd rather see this film before many others I gave higher grades, so
does that mean I graded it inaccurately? Truth be known, I don't really think
I can answer this question.
To understand SPICEWORLD, you have to understand the Spice Girls. Unless
you're very *very* young, or fairly older, you probably have at least heard of
them. They're a group of five busty British babes who've had #1 hit singles
and whose debut album sold millions. They're primarily adored by pre-teen
girls who hope someday the contents of their training bras might match those
of Ginger Spice's (real name: Geri Haliwell) Wonderbra. All five of the girls
have these "spicy" names for which they are better known than their real
names. There is the aforementioned Ginger Spice, as well as Sporty Spice
(Melanie Chisholm, or Mel C.), Scary Spice (Melanie Brown, or Mel B.), Baby
Spice (Emma Bunton), and Posh Spice (Victoria Addams), and all of them, to
some degree or another, resemble their stage names.
The Spice Girls took the world by storm, and SPICEWORLD is actually a good-
humored spoof of all that transpired during their quick rise to fame. It's
quite nice to see what good sports the girls are (and not just the one dubbed
Sporty) about poking fun at themselves. They don't take themselves too
seriously, and that's probably the best thing about them. It's also surprising
how natural they seem in front of the camera *acting*, and not just singing
and dancing. They're not flawless by any means, but for the most part, they
deliver their lines without feeling staged, and, like them or not, we get the
sense the five are very at home within their characters (which seems
reasonable since they portray themselves).
What makes the film bad is that extreme fans of the Spice Girls won't get
enough of their music, while the rest of us don't get enough of a movie. The
real point of this is to look at the Spice Girls for over ninety straight
minutes. Most of the film is very blasé, but several parts are downright
boring, and then they have those sporadic moments that actually make us laugh
out loud! If you're a big fan of the group, you probably won't get enough of
what you want, and if you're not a big fan, you get too much time devoted to
nothing more than "look at us" moments. For the right crowd, the "music video"
sequences will be the highlights of the film, but for others, they will serve
as three-minute lulls in a hectic-but-overall-uneventful storyline.
Other key actors include Richard E. Grant as Clifford, the Spice Girls'
manager, Alan Cumming as the film-maker Piers Cutherton-Smyth who attempts to
make a documentary of the group, George Wendt as Martin Barnfield, a producer
who constantly works on pitching a Spice Girls movie, and Roger Moore in a
small, self-parodizing role. All provide relatively good performances, keeping
in mind once again that this film wasn't meant to be acted seriously. Even
Meat Loaf shows up as Dennis the bus driver and seems to have fun with it.
While this film is continuously compared to the Beatles' A HARD DAY'S NIGHT, I
think that is an unjust comparison. It is supposedly the movie studio that
first mad the comparison by way of press kits, but I don't think drector Bob
Spiers, nor the Spice Girls, intended it to be so. I think the studios were
just trying to boost hype and interest in the film, and have instead, come off
rather pretentious. I don't think this film is trying to be anything more than
a fun, satirical look at a group that got so big, a movie seemed the next
likely step. And what could've been better than a self-indulged yet self-
mocking approach? Probably nothing, and so it is.
SPICEWORLD is a movie I thought would be embarrassing to enjoy, but now
instead, I find myself wanting to defend a movie I didn't even give a good
review. It's bad, but it succeeds in every way it intended. It gives the Spice
Girls a chance to play while allowing all those obsessive fans out there to
indulge in every brainless moment. Perhaps the group is nothing more than a
gimmick. If that's the case, the movie's gimmick is that it *is* such a
gimmick! You might be saying, "a Spice Girls movie? Come on!", but when it
comes down to it, I think that's the point.

Spiceworld Review by Eric Lurio (C)1998 
 If I didn't know better I would say that the first couple of drafts of the
 `Spiceworld' script was written while Jamie Curtis and Kim Fuller were
 intoxicated.
 This may or may not be the case, but anything this cheerfully dumb could not
 be the product of a healthy mind.
 For better or worse, Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton, Melanie Chisholm, Geri
 Haliwell and Victoria Addams are the Spice Girls. They go around in a bus
 [driven by Meat Loaf] who's interior is about twice the size of the exterior. 
 They pretty much do nothing but hang out, sing and show off their thier
 mammary glands while the likes of Roger Moore, Barry Humphries, George Wendt,
 Stephen Fry, Bob Geldof, Bob Hoskins, Elton John, Jennifer Saunders and Elvis
 Costello briefly step in front of the camera to ham it up for old times sake.
 There is some slight semblance of a plot concerning the sixth Spice Girl,
 played by Pete Bes..er...Naoko Mori, who is ten months pregnant and about to
 give birth just before the show at the Albert hall begins, but that doesn't
 really help or hurt whatever this thing is at all.
 People have compared `Spiceworld' to `A Hard Day's Night,' but it's in fact
 something close to a remake of the Monkees' `Head' which came out in 1968.
 Except that actually stands the test of time.  

Author

The Spice Girls' first film (of many?) is set over five days leading up
to their first live performance at the Albert Hall. Its a story which
has grown from the extentions of their adopted characters, the premise
is basically -:what if the Spice Girls really were Scary, Sporty,
Babyish, Posh and ...well..Ginger? How whould they act when thrown into
an equally make-believe 'film' setting?
The film is tongue in cheek about the Spice Girls, fame, fans, the
media, even the whole film concept, throughout the whole thing, their
manager is negotiating a deal for a film which it eventually turns out
that we're watching....circles within circles, cool.
The girls themselves were, on the whole, really good. By and large, they
sounded like they were just talking normally. With the exception of
Victoria, who I'm afraid just can't drag the words off the page and
reveals herself to be the least talented in yet another area. They stood
up,against a host of celebrities and actors without looking completely
outclassed and stupid. 
Talking of the numerous cameos, they are also treated with the same
self-pointed wit, especially Roger Moore as the Blofeld style, martini
drinking, all knowing big boss of the girls. 
In conclusion, it's two thumbs way, way up for the Spice Girls.
They don't just sing, you know.

The following is a list (Larry Kink-style) of things that I learned from
the new film, Spiceworld:
   * The Spice Girls have the best teeth in all of England
   * George Wendt's career is washed up (although I should have figured
that out when he was thrown off of the sitcom The Naked Truth)
   * Sadly, Mark McKean (The Kids in the Hall) may also be having career
problems
   * The Spice Bus is very roomy and comfortable
   * Sporty Spice is arguably the most talented of the spices
   * `Girl Power' has something to do with Wonder-Bras and unwed
pregnancy, but I'm not sure because I nodded off for a bit
   * I believe that Posh Spice would best suit my mature and refined
demeanor
   * The best parts of the movie are when Mark McKean pitches ideas for
potential Spice Girls movie plotsall better than the one that
actually made it to the screen
   * Director Bob Spiers has proven that his previous flop, That Darn
Cat! (Worst 10 Films of 1997) was no fluke
   * I actually prayed for the songs.  The singing scenes were far less
vapid than the ones where the acting was trying to happen
   * There is nothing that can be found in a dark theater to aid a
person with a suicide attempt.  Believe me, I looked
   * The screenplay, by Kim Fuller (Tracy Takes On) and Jennifer
Saunders (Absolutely Fabulous) is as annoying as Tracy Takes On
and Absolutely Fabulous
   * The names of the Spice Girls should be changed to Red, Itchy,
Swollen, Burning and Painful (after a certain proctologic

     Arguably, the Spice Girls are to the 1990s what ABBA was to the 
1970s.  Despite their radically different compositions, both groups have 
a lot in common.  Just like ABBA twenty years ago, the Spice Girls are 
pop wonders who manage to rise consistently to the top of the music 
charts despite the essential vapidity of their hits.  And, although they 
get very little respect from "serious" music lovers, they continue to 
sell albums at an alarming rate.  Now, for better or worse, the Spice 
Girls have done something that ABBA never did:  starred in a movie.
     It's worth noting at the outset that I am definitely not a member 
of the target audience for this movie.  I'm not a screaming pre-teen 
girl or a hormone-crazed 12-year old boy.  I'm also not a Spice Girls 
fan.  Actually, going into the film, I was rather neutral towards them.  
As SPICE WORLD's running length dragged on, however, and I was subjected 
to one repetitive song after another, I began to develop an active 
dislike for the singing group.  They may be pleasant to look at, but 
their irritating antics as presented here are enough to put someone off 
of them permanently.  Suffice it to say that I won't be buying the 
soundtrack.
     The movie's premise is as flimsy as can be, but it least it doesn't 
require a whole lot of acting from the main quintet of Baby Spice (Emma 
Bunton), Ginger Spice (Geri Halliwell), Scary Spice (Melanie Brown), 
Sporty Spice (Melanie Chisholm), and Posh Spice (Victoria Adams).  SPICE 
WORLD follows the group as they travel around London getting ready for a 
big concert at the Albert Hall.  Along the way, they endure photo 
shoots, constant attention from the paparazzi, pressure from their 
neurotic manager (Richard E. Grant), interference from a documentary 
film maker (Alan Cumming), and the attempts of a tabloid owner (Barry 
Humphries) and his chief photographer (Richard O'Brien) to split them 
up.  In the end, however, they triumph over all adversity and wow their 
fans.
     The press package for SPICE WORLD makes the jaw-dropping statement 
that the film is "a '90s version of A HARD DAY'S NIGHT with a pinch of 
THIS IS SPINAL TAP and a dash of SPEED".  Time for a reality check.  Any 
similarities between SPICE WORLD and those three films are entirely 
superficial.  The SPEED citation points to a brief parody of a high-
speed bus chase, and nothing more.  No aspect of SPICE WORLD's 
occasional pseudo-documentary approach comes close to the acid edge 
achieved by SPINAL TAP.  And, although the film is clearly trying to 
follow in the footsteps of the Beatles' classic, it's several long 
strides behind, lacking the same sense of originality, spontaneity, high 
energy, and joi de vie.  Not to mention the differences in music 
quality.  A HARD DAY'S NIGHT was a breath of fresh air; SPICE WORLD is 
recycled.
     The film is littered with unexpected cameos (Stephen Fry, Bob 
Hoskins, Elton John, Hugh Laurie, Meat Loaf, Jennifer Saunders, Richard 
Briers, Elvis Costello).  Some can surely be attributed to the 
involvement of film maker Bob Spiers, who is a directing icon for the 
British sit-com industry.  During his long career, he has helmed 
episodes of "Fawlty Towers," "Are You Being Served," "Alexi Sayle," "A 
Bit of Fry and Laurie," and "Absolutely Fabulous."  Sadly, however, 
Spiers doesn't generate enough laughter here, and even the "name the 
next familiar face" game can't save the film.
     Although the Spice Girls, who appear comfortable in front of the 
camera, are the headliners, there are a few legitimate performers in the 
film.  Richard E. Grant leads the pack as an intentionally over-the-top 
neurotic who quickly got on my nerves.  Alan Cumming, Barry Humphries, 
George Wendt (as an American movie producer), Richard O'Brien (best 
known as Riff Raff from THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW), and Claire 
Rushbrook (as the Girls' assistant) all have more than a few seconds of 
screen time.  Then there's Roger Moore, who, as "The Chief," finds 
himself satirizing his part as James Bond (although some would argue 
that his tenure in that role ended in self-parody).  While sipping 
shaken (not stirred) vodka martinis, stroking a cat, and living a life 
of luxury, he utters such nonsensical profundities as "A headless 
chicken can only know where he has been.  He cannot see where he is 
going."  
     SPICE WORLD is a vanity project -- an ego trip designed to show the 
five girls in the best possible light and give them a chance to perform 
about 14 numbers on-screen.  As a comedy, it's weak, because most of the 
jokes are obvious and not especially funny.  As a satire, it's weaker, 
because the screenplay never takes any chances and all of the mini 
parodies are safe, silly, and creatively lifeless.  The film isn't even 
a particularly good musical, because the songs are so inane.  The only 
people who are likely to be able to sit through SPICE WORLD without 
casting numerous yearning glances at the exit are those who number 
themselves among the group's legion of die-hard fans.  Ultimately, this 
film has too much Spice and not enough flavoring.

 Spiceworld (1998) 1 star out of 4. Starring the Spice Girls.
 Spice World  tries very hard to be A Hard Day's Night. Unfortunately, it
turns out to be "Blandworld," a movie aimed at the female pre-pubescent
fans of the Spice Girls, a British girls group whose members offer more
attitude than talent.
 Luckily, it is their attitude that salvages this movie. While the Spice
Girls are by no means actresses, their lack of self-consciousness before
the camera gives the film a naturalistic vibrancy.
 As performers the Spice Girls are merely adequate. They strut and pose
rather than dance, and they at least sing on key. Their songs are
unremarkable, and after a while, they all begin to sound alike.
 Despite cameos from Elton John and Elvis Costello, among others, most of
the regular performances are embarassingly hammy.
 It's a shame to see a wonderful actor such as Richard E. Grant, as the
girls' manager, mug his way through the proceedings. Roger Moore, as the
behind-the-scenes Mr. Big, is a travesty.
 More than anything else, Spice World  needs a harder edge. The girls try
too hard to please and to be liked and accepted, unlike the Beatles who, in
A Hard Day's Night, enjoyed thumbing their noses at the establishment.
 A little more seasoning added to the Spice World  recipe, could have made
for a tasty treat instead of a safe, unoriginal extended music video.

Rated PG: teen-oriented themes

    I have had almost no exposure to the Spice Girls. Going into this
film, I was convinced that I wouldn't know a single song of theirs (I
found out later that I actually had heard one before seeing the film).
They just seemed like five ditsy British girls that dance around and
make lots of money. I was anxious to see Spice World because I knew my
favorite actor has a cameo in it. Aside from this, though, I expected to
deplore this film.
    And now that it's over, I still want to deplore it. But I can't. I'm
i...in...fected bbbby the SPICE GIRLS! No, but seriously, Spice World is
a terrible film that, regrettably, is also entertaining. Sure, it's
really goofy, and very stupid, and the film ultimately is awful, but
it's harmless and funny. And Bob Hoskins is in it for ten seconds. In
theory, that's all I need.
    Naturally, the story is nothing to write home about. It centers
around the Girls (Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton, Melanie Chisholm, Geri
Halliwell, Victoria Adams) and their manager (Richard E. Grant) who are
on their big bus heading towards their first live show. Along the way,
there are subplots: a crew tries to make a documentary about the Girls
(led by Alan Cumming); a couple of evil men try to smear them by having
a guy follow them and take pictures at inopportune times; and some
Hollywood producers try to get in on the fun with high-minded concepts
for films that the Girls can star in.
    Spice World, first and foremost, is a disorganized mess of a film.
It jumps around from subplot to subplot and never really becomes
engaging as a story. Scenes are rapidly thrown at the audience (it jumps
from the Girls to the various subplots frequently) with little to no
warning, so concentration in this case is nearly impossible. You'll find
yourself blindsided by big, colorful images at high speeds.
    What is probably the worst thing about it is that, leaving the
theater, I knew nothing new about the Spice Girls. Everything in this
film is fabricated and phony. Take, for instance, the scene where they
remember a time before they were famous, singing in the local diner. I
read somewhere that there were auditions to be in the Spice Girls, so
this scene was obviously made up for the film. Knowing that the Spice
Girls likely hate each other in real life didn't help as I watched;
every attempt at "friendship" in the film seems completely forced.
    The most inherently silly thing about the Spice Girls are the
so-called "identities" that they all have. Having seen the film, I would
still have to go searching for their five identities. The only ones that
stuck out were the girlish antics of Baby and the stuck-up,
materialistic Posh. I can see the rest of their faces, but what they
are, and what they do in this film, is still a mystery.
    Aside from the film as a whole being really bad, it goes for the
unexpected and turns out really funny. Some of the sequences here are
clever and hilarious, like a Speed rip-off in which the Girls are
trapped on the bus with a bomb. Every time Richard E. Grant opened his
mouth, I laughed. I also liked the nightmare sequence in which they make
fun of themselves (a judge dooms their next album to debut at number 176
on the Billboard 200, only to drop off the next week). And the film is
so frantic and exasperating that boredom is impossible. Spice World may
be a terrible movie, but it's so terrible that I just couldn't help but
enjoy myself.
