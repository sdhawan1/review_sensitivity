     I fell asleep during TURTLES, was mildly amused by BTTF III, but
had a terrific time at GREMLINS 2 today.  Yes, it's true, the
performances by the special effects are generally better than the
performances by the actors, and the film has more rubber logic than
most, but it's FUN!
     Yes, you can guess the story.  Gizmo winds up in a research lab
after his owner, the old Chinese man, dies.  The research lab in in
"Clamp Tower," a massive New York sky scraper that contains various
cable networks (including things like "The Archery Network" and "The
Safety Channel"), a mall, restaurants, and the headquarters for Clamp
International.  Of course, Billy and Kate, the heros from the first
film, also happen to work in that building.  Billy rescues Gizmo from
the genetics lab (run gleefully by Christopher Lee), but your typical
series of catastrophes happen to little Gizmo and gremlins rapidly
infest the entire building.
     Since there's a genetics lab to trash, the gremlins mutate into a
variety of bizarre creatures, including a winged gargoyle,
spider-monster, and a quasi-intellectual, pipe-smoking Yuppie.  There
are more sight-gags, parodies and wonderful bits throughout this movie.
There's the "Movie Police," "Microwaving with Marge," and some amusing
cameos by various Warner Brothers characters.  There's an on-target
parody of Kate's "Why I Hate Christmas" speech (though it was a tad too
long) from the first movie, and great satire of corporate personality
throughout the film.
     The movie is rated PG-13, though most of the violence happens to
gremlins and to the set rather than to any humans.  Our nine-year-old
was liked the movie, but didn't really start laughing at it until after
the gremlins popped out all over.
     The puppetry and radio-controlled gremlins in this movie were both
extremely well-done.  The gremlins have a little more personality in
this film than in the first one.
     GREMLINS 2 took a good idea and made it better.  I hope Dante &
company quit while they are ahead.  I'm not sure how the movie is doing.
We saw it in an empty theater today, which is a shame because the movie
is a blast.

     GREMLINS 2 is a hard film to pin down and review.  It is hard to
criticize the story because it's not seriously trying to tell its story.
Maybe it is working only half-time to tell its story and the other half
is divided up among making film references, making comments about
business and politics, and playing practical jokes on the viewer.  As
rationales for sequels go, this one is about par for being crass and
high concept.  The little monsters are back and taking over Trump Tower.
Of course, they cannot call it Trump Tower so it is Clamp Center, owned
by Daniel Clamp, an amalgam of Donald Trump and Ted Turner.  The world
needed a film with the gremlins vandalizing a skyscraper about as much
as it needed a toothbrush with disk brakes.
     But while it seemed in GREMLINS that the gags were getting in the
way of the story-telling, in GREMLINS 2 the story does a much better job
of staying out of the way of the gags.  Just as the gremlins take over
the building, the gags take over the film.  That is fine, I suppose,
because while I cannot recommend the story, I did appreciate many of the
gags.  I rather hope that this film is marketed on videocassette with a
complete list of the films parodied and the well-known people appearing
during the course of GREMLINS 2.  Then the movie can be played like a
word search puzzle.
     The plot has likable young couple Billy Peltzer (played by Zack
Gilligan) and Kate Beringer (played by Phoebe Cates) living together (in
sin!)  in New York and both working for Clamp (played by John Glover).
All three work in the same building with a team of genetic scientists
led by Dr.  Catheter (played by Christopher Lee!).  Billy finds out that
the genetic scientists are playing around with his favorite Gremlin and
we are off.  Rounding out the cast we have Robert Prosky playing Al
Lewis playing Grandpa playing havoc with Clamp's cable broadcast
station.  Having Prosky playing Al Lewis is like having Robert Duvall
play Soupy Sales.  The whole concept of the "Gremlins" films is that
nasty accidents happen.  But just to show that happy accidents happen
also, at least for Dante, GREMLINS has the Trump character discovering
he likes a young woman working for him.  Her name is Marla.  Director
Joe Dante insists that *all* filming was complete well before anyone
ever heard of Marla Maples but, of course, the choice of that name fits
very nicely with the theme of promising contrivances going wrong.
     Of course, much of the film is spent in little plays and blackout
sketches that parody society and that star the very recently created
Gremlin Repertory Troup.  They act out scenes from films that logic
tells you the creatures could have no way of knowing about.  This
apparently bothers nobody in the audience.  It is supposed to be funny,
not make sense.  Actually somewhat funnier are the jabs at Ted Turner
and his attitude toward classic film, including a great line about
CASABLANCA.
     However, because I am still hung up on films having plots and this
one is a pretty mediocre plot, I can give this film no better than a
high zero on the -4 to +4 scale.

        GREMLINS 2: THE NEW BATCH is a noisy, unoriginal, and altogether
unnecessary sequel.  The film tries to fashion itself as an AIRPLANE-style,
no-holds-barred parody.  And to be honest, some of the movie's satire is
surprisingly amusing.  The problem is that the laughs in GREMLINS 2 aren't
consistent enough and don't come often enough to keep the film moving.
About every five or ten minutes, GREMLINS 2 comes up with a clever gag, but
in between you have to suffer through some awfully chaotic and deadly dull
sequences, as the gruesome gremlins belch, bang, and brawl their way
through the movie.
        GREMLINS 2 reunites Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates, the
protagonists from the original movie.  Galligan is adequate in the lead
role, but Cates proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that her acting lessons
were a terrible waste of time and money.  The sequel also features
Christopher Lee (as a mad genetic scientist), Gedde Watanabe (as a
camera-happy tourist) and John Glover, who gives a savory comic performance
as Daniel Clamp, a wealthy entrepreneur who is the epitome of egotism and a
wonderful take-off on Donald Trump and Ted Turner.  The movie also has fun
with cameos by wrestler Hulk Hogan, film critic Leonard Maltin and director
Paul Bartel.
        In case you care, the plot this time around has the mischievous
little buggers wreaking havoc on Clamp Centre, an automated, ultra-modern,
high-rise office building in Manhattan.  Come to think of it, the movie
could have killed two birds with one stone if it had brought in Bruce
Willis to thwart the monster-terrorists.  Imagine, "Die Hard 2: The Next
Batch."  Now, THAT'S high concept.
