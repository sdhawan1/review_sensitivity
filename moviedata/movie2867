Am I the only one who's had it up to here (that's right...here!) with films
that start by either thirteen or six? Let's look at the past few years.
There was THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR, THE THIRTEENTH WARRIOR and now, THIRTEEN
DAYS. There's also been THE SIXTH DAY, THE SIXTH SENSE and SIX DAYS, SEVEN
NIGHTS. C'mon Hollywood...get original, dude! How about tossing some new
numbers in there? The SECOND DAY might've been just as good/bad, or what
about the EIGHTEENTH WARRIOR? I don't know, maybe I'm just a little cranky
cause it's that time of the month again and my memory sucks, but let's see
what Kevin Costner has to say about all this...
PLOT:
Based on a real life event. The Soviet Union is stockpiling nuclear missiles
in Cuba. The United States spots the warheads and considers them to be a
little too close for comfort. The President and the rest of the big wigs in
the government spend the next thirteen days grazing the possibility of an
all-out war breaking out against the USSR. Who's gonna blink first? Are the
Soviets bluffing? Will Marilyn Monroe save the day?
CRITIQUE:
Historians, patient moviegoers and those fascinated with the
behind-the-scenes goings-on of all things political are likely to embrace
this movie. I dug it myself. Certain elements from it reminded me a lot of
two other great films, namely NO WAY OUT and CRIMSON TIDE, although this
film focused more on the talkie-talkie stuff, rather than any action,
romance or humor. Of course, this film isn't about that anyway. It's about
tense moments, tit-for-tat strategy sessions and basically, one of the
greatest political chess games of all time. I thoroughly enjoyed this film,
never once felt bored during its two and a half hour runtime and was gripped
by its many strong performances. Ironically, the first utterance of Kevin
Costner's thick, thick Boston accent had me wondering if I had walked into a
comedy or what, but it only took five minutes for me to believe both him,
his accent and pretty much everything else that occurred in this movie from
there on out.
You see, the Cuban Missile Crisis took place long before my time and I
honestly didn't know all that much about it before seeing this movie (me no
Americanos), so every second on the clock was a captivating one for me. The
jargon wasn't too hard to follow, especially with the Kennedy brothers
sharply tag-teaming their way through most of the hard-liners, and all of
the main characters, very well drawn out. And what about those awesome suits
that the brothers and Costner were wearing? Very cool! All in all, this
movie is structured a lot like a play. Plenty of dialogue, lots of
characters interacting amongst one another and very few distinct locations.
One thing I didn't "get" or like about this film, was the director's
seemingly arbitrary use of black and white vs color scenes. He pulled a
couple of these babies early on and then stopped. Not exactly sure why. It
was just distracting. But on the whole, the movie grabbed by the cojones and
let me fly up on the wall during a pretty funky time of our history.
Granted, it didn't have me chomping fingernails the whole way through, but
the tension was present throughout, the dead-on performances by Bruce
Greenwood and Steven Culp infectious to behold, and ultimately, the movie
helped me achieve a greater understanding of the entire event as it took
place, and allowed me to put my little miscommunication issues with the
Missus in perspective.
You see, when the Mrs. and I miscommunicate, I don't get any nookie for the
night. But when JFK and Kruschev miscommunicate in this movie (couldn't
these guys just call each other direct?), the result could likely have
turned into World War 3. Makes the whole toilet seat up-or-down debate seem
pretty insignificant, eh?
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Note about this film (from the press kit): While this picture is based upon
a true story, some characters have been composited or invented, and dialogue
and a number of incidents contained in this film were fictionalized for the
purpose of dramatization.
PackBacker, this one's for you! This is screenwriter David Self's second
produced screenplay. His first was for 1999's THE HAUNTING. Yikes!
Director Roger Donaldson previously worked with Kevin Costner in the 1987
thriller NO WAY OUT.

Sharply percussive snare drum hits shatter the high flying violin song 
as nuclear rockets dash across the screen leaving mushroom clouds in 
their wake. This is not the opening sequence of some light tale. 
October 1962, the country is oblivious to the tension reeling through 
JFK, brother Bobby, and adviser to the president played by Kevin 
Costner. Soviet Russia builds nuclear weapons in Cuba; will the USA 
strike first to eliminate the threat or opt for negotiations with an 
untrustworthy government? 
"Thirteen Days" paints a Norman Rockwell picture perfect image of 1962 
... even dropping into black and white (or blue and white) for effect. 
And launches from there into a highly compelling spiral of 
argumentation, politics and diplomacy. All the while, the threatening 
black cloud of nuclear holocaust descends ever nearer the most powerful 
nation in the world. 
The military brass pressures JFK, "Order now and we'll be able to invade 
and take over Cuba in 8 days;" their pleas as insistent as television 
mail ads ... "Order now, Order now, Order now." Kennedy is torn, tending 
to the decision with grave seriousness, "There's something immoral about 
abandoning your own judgment." 
His assistant offers a double-edged reassurance, "There is no wise old 
man, there's just us." 
It's a long film that sneaks up on you. Enjoying the nostalgic view back 
into the 60's, and barely tolerating the fake accents, I didn't realize 
how much the tension had crawled from the screen under my skin. Then 
when JFK's publicity guy announces to the public that JFK will speak 
regarding a matter of the "highest urgency" - I felt my throat tighten 
in pain as if my country sincerely was in danger. 
And though, I could tell you with certainty that outcome of the Cuban 
Missile Crisis did not involve nuclear war ... I was still engaged 
firmly in this power play of politics and military muscling. Whew!!!! We 
won.

When the Cuban missile crisis happened in 1962, I was too little to
understand the particulars. I remember sitting on the carpet in front of
our black and white TV while John F. Kennedy spoke in solemn tones about
the conflict. Afterwards, my father looked grim and my mother unusually
anxious as they discussed what the young president had said. In bed that
night, I tried unsuccessfully to sort it out. All I really knew was that
a face-off was occurring over Russian rockets and, if somebody didn't
back down, there was a good chance that the world would come to an end.
"Thirteen Days" provides a flawed but gripping look at the United
States' side of the crisis and shows that the men in the White House
were just as scared as I was. We see events primarily through the eyes
of presidential aide Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner), a former classmate
of Bobby Kennedy and a close friend and confidant of both the Kennedy
boys. There are positives and negatives to the "World According to
Kenny" storytelling motif. On the plus side, it keeps the focus firmly
on the inner circle, establishing and maintaining a unique intensity. By
following O'Donnell, the filmmakers can offer personal observations and
glimpses of family life without concocting situations or exchanges for
John or Bobby Kennedy.
But the approach puts blinders on the audience similar to those that
were on the President and his advisors. Amazingly, there was no direct
line between the White House and the Kremlin in those days. For the most
part, messages were filtered through public speeches and private
meetings with ambassadors. On October 16, 1962, when U.S. aerial spy
photographs revealed the presence of Soviet medium-range ballistic
missiles in Cuba, the White House saw what Russia was doing, but had no
idea why.
And neither does the audience. The truth is that, after dealing with
President Kennedy at a summit meeting, Soviet Premier Khrushchev
dismissed our commander in chief as a lightweight and decided that the
USSR could get away with such a daring stunt. That's an important piece
of information that we never hear during "Thirteen Days." In fact, over
the course of the film's 144 minutes, we never get any specifics on the
Russian leader's mindset.
It's not as if the facts were unavailable. A number of documentaries
depict the goings-on in both Washington and Moscow, as did ABC in the
early '70s, when the network presented "The Missiles of October," a
well-received dramatization starring William Devane as John Kennedy,
Martin Sheen as Bobby and Howard da Silva as Khrushchev.
While the filmmakers behind "Thirteen Days" would likely argue that
their approach makes dramatic sense, I believe the film would not have
suffered by presenting a complete view. At the very least, why not
include substantial informative crawls at the beginning and the end of
the story?
The production has a few other problems. After watching the long,
remarkably effective music-free stretch in "Cast Away," I was acutely
aware of the scoring here. When the screen is filled with characters
heatedly discussing the fact that nuclear war could break out at any
time, do we really need orchestral cues to feel tense? I think not. And
why, oh why, does the film periodically shift from color to black and
white?
Speaking of needless affectations, what about Kevin Costner's Boston
accent? The oft-maligned actor told an interviewer, "Luckily, Ken's
accent wasn't as strong as the Kennedys' accent, but I still studied
hard because I know I did a really lousy accent in 'Robin Hood: Prince
of Thieves' and I didn't want to take that kind of heat again."
Apparently, old habits die hard, because, despite his protestations,
Kevin offers a repeat performance. He starts the film with a broad,
metallic accent, then fades into his standard Malibu Ken mode. Sadly,
the brassy Boston accent pops up throughout the film, mostly during
family scenes that were probably shot together early in the production.
Accents aside, Costner does fine work, adjusting his style so that he
doesn't overshadow the principals. As for the lead characters, Steven
Kulp is strong as Bobby Kennedy, projecting a sense of great energy
being contained by propriety, while Bruce Greenwood, neatly underplaying
his role, creates a John F. Kennedy that feels like a real person
instead of a cultural icon. Impressive. The supporting cast is sturdy,
with Michael Fairman a standout as U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson.
Despite its problems, "Thirteen Days" offers a chilling look at how
close to destruction our world came in 1962. Hopefully, those who
appreciate the film will seek out additional information so they can
learn what happened on the instigator's side of this life and death
chess match as well.

On a chilly October day in 1962, America teetered on
the verge of war.  A national crisis had developed
when it was discovered that Russia was secretly
installing nuclear missiles in Cuba, giving our Red
adversary first strike capability.  America was
adamant in finding a way to remove them.  However, it
was unclear as to whether diplomacy would work or
whether military force would be needed.  Had the Cuban
Missile Crisis escalated out of control, it would have
started an irreversible chain of events that could
have, in all likelihood, sent mankind on a trajectory
towards Armageddon.  That is, unless cooler heads
could prevail.
"Thirteen Days" is a wonderfully suspenseful and
dramatic retelling of the Cuban Missile Crisis when
America hoped for the best but virtually expected the
worst, showing us why cooler heads did prevail. 
Culled from a host of sources, including historical
records and documents, White House tapes, memoirs, and
interviews with some of the key players, the
screenplay centers on three people that ultimately
helped to pull America and the world back from the
brink.  The most crucial, of course, is then-President
John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) who must
simultaneously act decisively to address the grave
threat to national security, maintain a sense of
decision-making integrity to appease opposing
political forces, and exercise temperance in this time
of high volatility.  We learn that it's not just the
"big red dog digging in our backyard" that poses a
threat.  Equally menacing is the zealous military
brass that wants to take immediate, forceful action. 
Greenwood turns in a strong performance who makes a
believable Kennedy, allowing the audience to
internalize the agonizing political decisions that
would not only affect the future of his administration
but the future of the world as well.  
The other two key players are Attorney General Robert
F. Kennedy (Steven Culp) who remains edgy about any
path they undertake but is committed to carrying out
the decisions of his Presidential brother.   Also,
Kenneth P. O'Donnell (Kevin Costner) is a brusque
political advisor that helps to keep the political
machine from unraveling.  Both also give fine
performances, making it easy to accept them as the
people that they portray.
The movie chronicles the crisis from when offensive
missiles are first discovered being assembled in Cuba.
 Every action that the U.S. takes in countering the
threat seems reasonable.  However, the results bring
frightening consequences that push us closer towards
the unthinkable with alarming momentum.  Throughout
the film, the sense of urgency and tension mounts. 
For President Kennedy and the world, the stakes are
unspeakably high and the territory that they have
entered is uncharted.
The stark nature of the drama is heightened as some
scenes are shot in black and white.  Additionally, to
give the onscreen turmoil a more profound sense of
realism, many scenes feature video footage from that
period.  We witness the pandemonium at the stores as
citizens stocked up on goods; watch venerable news
anchor Walter Cronkite struggle to find the words to
adequately describe the frenzied situation; and most
haunting, view images of school children running for
cover during a bomb drill.
This is a riveting, message-driven film about a
pivotal point in our history when a handful of men had
the power to save or destroy the entire world.  It's a
chapter of America's recent past that should never be
forgotten.  After seeing it, you'll feel lucky to be
alive.

In October 1962, the United States and the Soviet Union had a staring
contest that is commonly referred to as The Cuban Missile Crisis.
Everyone knows the story  the Soviets put nukes in Cuba, President
Kennedy furrowed his brow and orchestrated a sea blockade of the island,
then the missiles were dismantled and sent back to Red soil.  The event
is referred to as a "crisis" because the two countries nearly wound up
in a nuclear arm-wrestling match, but, thankfully, cooler heads
prevailed.
The Crisis serves as the subject for Thirteen Days, the new $80-million,
two-and-a-half-hour film that features Kevin Costner as John F.
Kennedy's influential political advisor, Kenny O'Donnell.  Like the real
O'Donnell, who became an alcoholic after Kennedy was assassinated
following The Crisis, Costner (For Love of the Game) sports a thick
Boston accent that turns words like "Cuba" into `Q-ber.'  One of the
members of `The Irish Mafia' that rode Kennedy's coattails to
Washington, O'Donnell had a loving wife (played by Remember the Titans'
Lucinda Jenney) and five good-looking kids  a point Days doesn't let
you forget.
Using a generous amount of stock footage and black-and-white clips
(which makes Days' director Roger Donaldson look like a third-rate
Oliver Stone), the film does a decent job recreating the tension that
ran through the White House when surveillance photos revealed the
delivery of the Russian nukes to Cuba.  The missiles, which wouldn't be
operable for a couple of weeks, would be capable of striking any target
in the continental United States.
President Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood, Rules of Engagement), his brother
and the U.S. Attorney General Bobby Kennedy (Steven Culp), and a gaggle
of others had to decide how to handle the situation.  Too much force
would cause the Soviets to invade Berlin, and too little could lead to a
decisive Russian first strike.  The decision boiled down to a military
strike and Cuban invasion, or a blockade that would prevent an incoming
fleet of ships from delivering more weapons to the tiny island.
This debate grows incredibly tiresome during the film, although,
surprisingly, it only consumes the first half of Days.  Most people
think The Crisis ended when the Russians blinked and turned their ships
around, but recently declassified information gives Days enough content
to stretch itself out for another 75 minutes.  Since this part of the
story isn't as well known, I'll leave out the gritty details.  It's
interesting and all, but it didn't need to be anywhere near this long.
Costner, who also produced the film (which may explain the ungodly
running time), does an admirable job with his accent, although his role
doesn't really offer much else to get excited about.  Greenwood's JFK
looks eerily like a dark-haired David Caruso and spends almost all of
his time gritting his teeth and staring out the windows of the White
House (watching for Marilyn's car, no doubt).  Culp, who played Bobby
Kennedy in HBO's Norma Jean & Marilyn, sounds just like Richie
Cunningham, while Dylan Baker (The Cell) turns in another strong
performance as Defense Secretary Robert McNamara.
Director Donaldson (Dante's Peak), a coworker with Costner in 1987's No
Way Out, does a horrible job of keeping the film interesting.  Everybody
knows how the first half of the film is going to shake out, and
everybody also knows how it's going to end.  There is no reason
Donaldson needed to keep Days this long, other than making the film's
length seem more Oscarworthy.  His continual use of nuclear weapon
detonation throughout the film (as a `what if' scenario) and the
inclusion of O'Donnell's family life is clumsy and calculated.
Days was written by David Self (The Haunting), who based his script on a
book called `The Kennedy Tapes - Inside the White House During the Cuban
Missile Crisis," which was written by Ernest R. May and Philip D.
Zelikow.  There are a bunch of scenes in the film that are supposed to
be dramatic but end up being corny (one even features Chip Esten from
the comedy improv television show Whose Line is it Anyway?).  And Days
uses the term `rules of engagement' about a dozen times, so it almost
seems like the script is rubbing the failure of Greenwood's last project
in his face.
2:25  PG-13 for brief strong language

Directed by Roger Donaldson. Screenplay by David Self, based on the book
"The Kennedy Tapes -- Inside The White House During The Cuban Missile 
Crisis" by Ernest R May and Philip D Zelikow. Starring Kevin Costner,
Bruce Greenwood, Steven Culp. Running time: 145 minutes. Rated PG for mild

It's sometimes said that today's society -- especially in North America 
-- is lacking a modern mythology. We have no counterpart to the Greek 
myths of two thousand years ago, the Norse sagas of the first millennium, 
or the Arthurian legends of the Middle Ages. But this really isn't true; 
we have developed our own mythology, but not one populated by gods and 
demons and magicians. Instead, it is made up of actors like Marilyn 
Monroe, singers like Elvis Presley, Prime Ministers like Pierre Trudeau... 
and Presidents, like John F Kennedy.
Few figures in recent history have accumulated such a body of folklore as
the thirty-fifth president of the United States. Much of this is derived 
from the mystery surrounding his assassination, of course, but it extends 
back further than that, to the various crises which highlighted JFK's term 
of office, his rumored romantic liaisons, and so on. And the mythology 
encompasses the rest of his family too, from his brother Robert to his
son, John Junior.
If John F Kennedy is a figure of modern mythology, then "Thirteen Days"
stands as one of the legends which make up his myth, an "Odyssey" to his
Ulysses. Like any good legend, of course, it is a fictionalised version of
the true events. But, although the screenplay by David Self plays fast and
loose with real history, it does so in a manner which avoids overt
sensationalism. "Thirteen Days" effectively portrays the tension and
paranoia of the time -- the feeling that one wrong decision could mean not
only the end of free society, but human civilisation itself.
"Thirteen Days" chronicles the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962.
During routine aerial surveillance of Castro-controlled Cuba, the American
military captures photographic evidence of Russian nuclear missile
emplacements on the island -- contrary to the Soviet promise that they
would not equip communist Cuba with offensive weaponry. Aware that the
combination of short- and medium-range missiles threaten the integrity of
much of the continental United States, a special committee of top White
House and military brass is quickly formed to map out strategy.
Leading these sessions are President Kennedy (played here by Bruce 
Greenwood, looking not very much like the real JFK but successfully
channelling his fire and sagacity) and Attorney General Robert Kennedy
(Steven Culp, looking very much indeed like the real Bobby). They're
assisted by their boyhood friend Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner). The
Kennedys quickly find themselves under pressure (especially from the Joint
Chiefs of Staff) to abandon any efforts at a diplomatic solution and
undertake a full-scale military deterrent. JFK is well aware that such a
maneuver carries with it the very real risk of nuclear war -- but with
just days left to go before the weapons in Cuba become operational, and
even more Russian ships steaming toward the island, time to find an
alternative is quickly running out.
Under the careful direction of Roger Donaldson ("Dante's Peak"), "Thirteen
Days" perfectly evokes the atmosphere of October 1962; it is difficult not
to feel transported back to the turbulent Cold War era. The film has
received some criticism for playing up the antagonism between the
administration -- particularly the Kennedys, O'Donnell and Secretary of
Defense Robert McNamara (Dylan Baker) -- and the military brass over
appropriate tactics. There is a persistent implication running throughout
the movie that the Joint Chiefs are trying to bully the President and have
their own way in the Crisis: "this is a setup," intones O'Donnell.
But even if such scheming and dissension did not really occur behind the
scenes, their place in this film is not unwarranted. Because certainly,
even if the politicos were in accord, the general population was not --
the United States was a seething mass of opposing viewpoints. Just as many
people wished to avoid the possibility of war at all costs, there was
also a sizeable number who wanted to duke it out with the Reds at the
nearest opportunity. "Thirteen Days", then, transposes this mix of popular
opinion onto the nation's leaders, and is thereby able to bring such
conflict to the fore.
That said, the picture does not neglect the common man either. Indeed,
that's basically the role that O'Donnell is supposed to play. In real
life, he was a minor figure in the Crisis, a footnote in the historical
annals. In "Thirteen Days", he is used as the audience's point of view on
the proceedings, a man who has very little direct involvement in the
political maneuverings but who is nonetheless in a position to watch the
situation unfold from beginning to end. Donaldson's most successful use of
O'Donnell comes when he sends him out onto the streets of Washington
midway through the crisis, to see firsthand how the country is reacting to
the Crisis.
But unfortunately, O'Donnell's effectiveness in "Thirteen Days" is at best
mixed. While he has his uses, there are times when he feels more like 
extra baggage -- hanging around in the background of scenes and tagging
along after the Kennedys like a groupie in suit and tie. To make matters
worse, Costner is burdened with a laughable New England accent that
recalls his similarly ludicrous effort in "Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves".
It is not impossible to see beyond this and recognise that Costner
delivers a solid performance as O'Donnell -- consider, for example, a
well-acted scene in which he tries to persuade an Air Force captain to
betray convention and hide certain facts from his superiors for the
national good. But in order to work well, O'Donnell needs to be an almost
invisible presence in the film, and Costner's casting makes this virtually
impossible.
Still, "Thirteen Days" is a potent film which does an excellent job of
taking well-documented historical fact and turning it into a 
suspense-filled drama. Donaldson rarely falters, and the cast approaches
the material with perfect conviction. I wasn't alive during the Cuban
Missile Crisis -- but now I almost feel like I was there.

     My view of THIRTEEN DAYS is heavily colored by my view of the
Kennedy administration and its Cuban policy in general and in this
incident in particular.  The crisis is just about the only major
Cold War incident when I feel the Soviets were in the right.  It is
not easy to get me to agree with Soviets I might add.  At this point
in history the US had already put nuclear missiles just off the
borders of the Soviet.  They also had complained loudly but really
only complained about a branch of the US government sponsoring an
invasion of Cuba.  Had the tables been reversed we would have
labeled the Bay of Pigs invasion "an act of war," but I suspect the
Soviets were a little fearful of the implications of so doing so and
quite rightly.  Acts of war really require retaliation.  They could
not, however, ignore a second such invasion, so they needed a
deterrent to prevent it from ever happening if for no other reason
than to preserve the peace.  It is the Americans who say, "If you
want peace, prepare for war."  The Soviets looked at the missiles
just over the border in Turkey and saw them as setting a precedent,
they would fortify Cuba.  That would seem a just act.  But instead
of regarding it as such it led to a head to head confrontation.  If
you see the film you will see all the tangible steps to diffuse the
situation are taken by the Soviets.  This we label "Going eyeball to
eyeball with the enemy and the other guy blinked."  Thank goodness
he did blink when we might not have.  I cannot help but feel the
unsung hero of THIRTEEN DAYS is Nikita Khrushchev.  This is just my
interpretation, I am no expert, but it colors my reaction to the
film.
     THIRTEEN DAYS is the story of the Cuban Missile Crisis from the
point of view of Presidential advisor Kenneth O'Donnell (played by
Kevin Costner).  The film is pretty much just a blow-by-blow
recounting of the incidents of the crisis beginning with a spy plane
flying over Cuba and seeing the nuclear missiles the Soviets had
provided the Cubans.  The John F. Kennedy ( played here by Bruce
Greenwood) is told almost immediately.  He calls in his brother
Robert (Steven Culp), his closest confidant.  For the remainder of
the crisis the President seems to have two heads, the Jack head and
the Bobby head.
     Anyone with a knowledge of history knows what happened next,
including the strong policy split between the military and civilians
in government.  The Chiefs of Staff were anxious to take on the
Soviets in a war they assumed they could limit.  Toward the end of
the crisis we realize that the Soviets also have their own divisions
in policy with hawks and doves in the Politburo.  The film is a
constant battle between those who want military solutions and those
who want diplomatic ones with John Kennedy being indecisive between
them, and rightly so.  Kennedy is haunted by his reading of Barbara
Tuchman's THE GUNS OF AUGUST, an account of how both sides behaving
in what at the time appeared logical ways inexorably descended into
the First World War.  That could happen again, this time with
nuclear missiles.
     THIRTEEN DAYS makes some bad stylistic mistakes.  The film
opens with a missile firing and a nuclear explosion.  Then more
missile firing and more big explosions.  Then more of the same.  The
point is, of course, that this sort of exchange is what they will be
trying to avoid.  Frankly I started to find this frequent visual
reminder of the high stakes involved rather annoying.  We all agree
that this is what we are trying to avoid.  We all agree that nuclear
weapons are very, very bad.  But to think clearly we have to avoid
what Kissinger called "scaring ourselves to death."  Showing the
bomb so often in hellish hues of red is a patronizing emotional
argument thrown in among the logical arguments of the film.  A
number of scenes toward the beginning seem for no reason to start
out in black and white and steel blue and fade into the full color
spectrum.  It was not all scenes and the implication may have been
we are taking this from cold-hard records and breathing life into
it.  But I was not sure.  Whatever it was trying to do it was
failing.  The Boston accents were a distraction particularly because
actors were not consistent in the degree of their own accents.
SPARTACUS was not made in Latin with English subtitles.  Director
Roger Donaldson could have toned them down a little and we could
have lived with the inaccuracy.
     On the other hand the film does produce a great feeling of
immediacy without snowing the viewer in detail he does not
understand.  The build of tension is very good in spite of the fact
we all know how it will turn out.  Part of the problem with this
documentary is that it has been done before and is overly familiar.
There was an excellent TV docu-drama in the mid-1970s, THE MISSILES
OF OCTOBER.  There was also at least one good documentary made for
television.  Each was better than THIRTEEN DAYS.
     I think films like this that show us an important event in
history in minute detail are very good, but that THIRTEEN DAYS is a
highly flawed example that makes it fall short of being a really
great film.  I rate it 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to
+4 scale.  And I still think it picks out the wrong people to be
heroes.

I was four years old when the Cuban Missile Crisis was going down.  After
seeing director Roger Donaldson's "Thirteen Days," I'm glad I was oblivious
to the saber rattling.
In a year when "The Contender" represents the current state of politics
and the media's obsession with sexual shenanigans, "Thirteen Days" harkens
back to the days of true world leaders.  In October, 1962, President John
F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood, "Double Jeopardy") is presented with photographs
identifying Russian missile installations being built in Cuba.  With his
Chiefs of Staff, including extreme Hawk General Curtis LeMay (Kevin Conway,
"Two Family House"), bristling for a fight, Kennedy and his brother Robert
(Steven Culp, "Nurse Betty") are forced to play an intricate game with the
highest of stakes.
David Self's script (1999's "The Haunting") uses Kennedy advisor
Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner) as the audience's eyes and ears into the
escalating tension at the White House as well as a bridge to family life
outside the political arena.  As O'Donnell's name isn't widely recognized,
we're able to observe the likes of the Kennedy brothers, Robert McNamara,
Adlai Stevenson and other notable figures of the era from more common ground.
With the exception of the overly broad Boston accent, Costner delivers fine,
restrained work here.  (Historians may quibble about the extent of O'Donnell's
role, but it works for the film).  While most may be familiar with the
broadstrokes of this event, the script is still rivetting storytelling
as the world's future all comes down to human intuition and second guessing.
O'Donnell's closeness to the Kennedy family is immediately established as
he jokingly spars with Jackie (an unconvincing Stephanie Romanov) over a
White House party guest list.  Soon the major players - Robert McNamara 
(Dylan Baker, "Happiness"), General Maxwell Taylor (Bill Smitrovich),
General Curtis LeMay, Dean Rusk (Henry Strozier), General Marshall Carter 
(Ed Lauter), Lyndon Johnson (Walter Adrian), Dean Acheson (Len Cariou) and 
Ted Sorensen (Tim Kelleher) are assembled in various configurations debating
the course of action.  Kennedy clearly doesn't trust his military advisors
after the Bay of Pigs, so favors a blockade (to be called a quarantine as
a blockade is an act of war).  Many of his advisors find this weak.
O'Donnell takes it upon himself to contact the men in the trenches flying
spying missions over Cuba, to beg them 'not to be shot at' - in other 
words, not to provide any information about Russian aggression to their
commanders.  McNamara squares off against the Naval Chief of Staff in the war 
room, demanding that only the President give orders to fire upon Russian 
naval vessels.
The uneasiness is also represented for the Russian side, as Kruschev's
handwriting is analyzed as 'being under great stress' and O'Donnell
reassures a nervous secretary in the Russian Embassy that he's a friend.
Pacifist Adlai Stevenson (a terrific turn by Michael Fairman) recreates
the famous, televized UN hearing where he accuses the brash then flustered
Soviet Ambassador Valerian Zorin of lying about their missile installations.
Meanwhile Helen O'Donnell (Lucinda Jenney, "Remember the Titans") copes 
with the large O'Donnel brood as her husband intermittently makes his way home 
for brief time periods at odd hours.  The media is held at bay until
JFK addresses the nation, then the American public empties stores of
supplies and holds its collective breath.
Bruce Greenwood beautifully evokes JFK.  Without really looking or sounding
like him, Greenwood gets the body language, the mannerisms, the fiery
intelligence and the uncertainty of the man.  Steven Culp, looking and
sounding quite a bit like RFK, absolutely works off of Greenwood to create
a portrait of the two brothers.
Director of photography Andrzej Bartkowiak ("Dante's Peak") keeps his
camera intimate, occasionally punching up the visuals with shots of 
US pilots darting through dangerous Cuban skies.  Color is gradually
bled from the film, letting some scenes play in a bluish black and white
that recalls the time setting.  Production designer Dennis Washington
("Dante's Peak") did extensive research to recreate JFK's White House.
The film is tautly editted by Academy Award winner Conrad Buff ("Titanic").
The film ends on a grace note.  As the Kennedys and O'Donnell walk outside
the White House walls, we hear the real voice of JFK.  The actors pass, each
leaving a shadow, the last of which is our 35th President.

Umm, it's the Cuban missile crisis folks. I'm going to keep the plot summary 
really short, and if you want to know more before seeing the film I'd 
recommend breaking out the old history books. When the Russians begin moving 
nuclear warheads into Cuba, the US catches them with aerial photographs. 
When confronted with accusations of their activities, the Russians deny 
everything and claim to the world that the US is trying to make them look 
bad in an effort to start a war. President John F. Kennedy (Bruce 
Greenwood), Robert Kennedy (Stephen Culp), and Kennedy's chief adviser, 
Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner) have to decide what to do about the 
situation. The joint chiefs want to go in, guns blazing and destroy 
everything in Cuba before occupying the country. Other advisers want to set 
up a blockade, keeping any Russian ships from entering Cuba with more 
supplies. The last alternative, which almost no one is willing to consider, 
is to make a deal with Russia and remove the nuclear weapons we have in 
Turkey in exchange for Russia's agreement to remove all weapons from Cuba 
and never put any in the country again. They have to choose quickly, because 
in only thirteen days the nuclear weapons in Cuba will be active.
Let me admit something to you before we begin. There's only one reason I 
went to see Thirteen Days, and I'm ashamed to admit it was just to 
see the preview for the upcoming Lord of the Rings movie. Yes, the 
trailer was very nice, but I was even more surprised to discover that I 
truly enjoyed the movie which followed. I remember seeing the previews for 
Thirteen Days some four or five months ago, and thinking two things 
to myself: "That's going to be completely inaccurate" and "How can a story 
on the Cuban missile crisis be all that suspenseful?" I'm happy to report 
that I was pleasantly surprised on both counts. Being something of a history 
buff, I expected the film to maul the real events. I pictured behind the 
scenes espionage, unreported armed conflicts, hidden murders and more (I 
half expected something as ridiculous as Kennedy himself flying a 
thunderbird into Cuba to drop a necessary bomb). Surprisingly (and 
thankfully), the film stays fairly true to the real events. Yes, some of the 
technology used didn't yet exist, and a few behind the scenes dealings were 
obviously made up/theorized, but otherwise this is quite historically 
accurate (unlike, say, U-571 from earlier in the year). As for the 
suspense, well, lets just say I had no idea a whole lot of talking and 
pensive expressions could keep me on the edge of my seat.
I must say, when I first read the cast list for Thirteen Days, my 
expectations plummeted into the basement. I've never been a fan of Kevin 
"Bad Sci-fi" Costner, and I've never understood peoples' fascination with 
his brand of "I'm playing the exact same guy with different names" acting. 
True to form, his acting in Thirteen Days simply bugged me. In 
particular, his impersonation of a Boston accent was gratingly bad. 
Thankfully, Costner is given tremendous support from the unlikeliest of 
places. Bruce Greenwood, who has shocked and appalled with one rancid 
performance after another (Double Jeopardy and Rules of 
Engagement being prime examples) is outstanding as JFK. This is made 
even more surprising by the fact that Greenwood doesn't particularly look 
like Kennedy and yet you don't question his playing the man for more than a 
minute. Equally impressive is Steven Culp as Robert Kennedy. Culp's career 
thus far has been composed almost entirely of brief parts in films and one 
recurring character in the television series "JAG", but I expect things to 
take off for him after his turn in Thirteen Days. The remaining cast 
members all give decent performances, the only exception in my opinion being 
Madison Mason (Crazy in Alabama), who seems to be having far too much 
fun making his Admiral Anderson look like a complete jerk.
It's a testament to the film's script and Roger Donaldson's (Species) 
direction that a story we all know the end to manages to keep us guessing, 
wondering, and hoping for a good outcome. Thanks mainly to Donaldson, the 
story moves at an unrelenting pace, seldom giving you more than a few 
minutes to sit back and take a breather. These breather scenes tend to 
involve things like Kenny visiting his son's football game, or he and the 
Kennedys sitting in the oval office, reminiscing. Otherwise the scenes are 
packed with taunt verbal action between Kennedy and his advisers. It's true, 
the joint chiefs are shown as a little more villainous than is likely to 
have been true, and the Kennedys are shown as indomitable heros, but you 
know what? That's that's the way Americans seem to like it. Something else 
I've got to commend Donaldson for is the amount of restraint he shows when 
it comes to military conflict being portrayed. As well all know, there 
wasn't any actual combat in the Cuban missile crisis, and I was pleasantly 
surprised to find that there are really only two or three scenes in the 
movie which even resemble armed conflict. They're brief scenes, involving 
planes flying over Cuba taking pictures while ground troops and SAM silos 
take pot shots at them, but there's something patriotic about seeing our 
boys fly in there, and I'll be damned if it didn't bring a tear of pride to 
my eye. Alright, I'm better now.
The faults with Thirteen Days are few, but significant. First, and 
most importantly, the film simply runs out of steam. I realize it's 
difficult for any movie to keep its audience engrossed for well over two 
hours (though Traffic managed that very thing with apparent ease), 
but after a tense, involving two hours, the sudden plummet into the depths 
of boredom in the film's final half hour comes as something of a shock. 
Also, the film ends on a schmaltzy, feel-good note which feels quite out of 
place compared with the rest of the movie. A minor quibble would be with a 
few of Donaldson's filming ideas. For example, at times the film suddenly 
goes into black and white for a few moments before switching back into 
color. There appears to be no rhyme or reason to when this will happen, and 
it succeeds in doing little more than confusing the audience (I heard a 
fellow behind me telling his wife he'd go talk to the manager about their 
projector being broken). Fortunately, working heavily in the film's favor is 
the score by Trevor Jones (Dark City). The score is not only 
brilliantly written, but perfectly utilized; underscoring and highlighting 
every scene it's played during rather than overpowering the action on 
screen. 13 Days runs a long 145 minutes, so get some rest before you 
catch it. I'd recommend the film to fans of political thrillers and history 
buffs (who, if nothing else, will get a kick out of some of the technology 
being used) and give it four out of five stars.

     In an early scene in THIRTEEN DAYS, Kenny O' Donnell (Kevin Costner)
sits at the breakfast table with his wife and children. It is October
1962, and O'Donnell is a special advisor to President John F. Kennedy
(Bruce Greenwood). As the conversation turns to field trips and report
cards, alarm bells begin going off. Not literal alarm bells for some civil
defense drill -- metaphorical, artistic alarm bells for viewers with a
sense of deja vu. This is a film about the Cuban Missile Crisis, but here
we are with a crew-cut Costner in his domestic glory. Will THIRTEEN DAYS,
like JFK before it, make the mistake of looking at a pivotal moment in
American history and asking, "How did it affect Kevin Costner's fictional
family?"
     Then, for most of the film, something wonderful happens: We see no
one but men in suits, trying to solve a seemingly unsolvable problem. As
tautly directed by Roger Donaldson, THIRTEEN DAYS finds riveting drama in
passionate debate, tricky politics and impossible decisions -- at least
until the O'Donnell kin start turning up again. Most of the narrative is
spent in the war rooms and strategy sessions that find JFK and his key
advisors -- O'Donnell, his brother and Attorney General Bobby (Steven
Culp), Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara (Dylan Baker) -- trying to
determine the appropriate course of action after spy planes identify
Soviet nuclear missile sites under construction in Cuba, just a couple of
weeks away from being functional. Do nothing, and doomsday is a five
minutes flight from half of America. Try diplomacy, and the sites become
operational while offers and counter-offers take place. Sneak in to
attack the sites, and the Soviets retaliate in Europe, setting off a
likely World War III.
     THIRTEEN DAYS is a history-based thriller that faces a variation on
the knuckle-headed joke promulgated by the anti-TITANIC contingent: In
this case, we know the boat (or the human race) _doesn't_ sink. But
THIRTEEN DAYS isn't about whether or not the world will be bombed to
cinders; it's about the astonishing real-life war game played by capable
but flawed people for the fate of civilization. For a film that is devoted
largely to debate and description of scenarios, THIRTEEN DAY is incredibly
tense. We watch politicians go toe-to-toe with soldiers over the
appropriate philosophical footing for dealing with the Red Menace. We
watch brinksmanship played like two kids shoving each other on a
schoolyard. It's the kind of smart film-making of ideas that can keep you
on the edge of your seat waiting for a phone to ring, or not to ring.
     Mostly, however, it's a profile in the courage under fire of John F.
Kennedy. Plenty of films have opted either to canonize JFK as our great
slain king or demonize him as a womanizing rich kid, but I don't think any
film has ever made him as compelling a dramatic character. As played with
a piercing intellect by Bruce Greenwood, Kennedy is portrayed as an often
short-tempered man with burdens to bear (the subtle acknowledgement of his
chronic back pain is one of many effective shorthands in David Self's
script). He's also the essence of a great leader, bringing the finest
minds together, considering the greatest possible good and finally
trusting his own reason and judgment. Greenwood's dynamic performance
finds JFK's legacy not in some legend of golden boy heroism, but in the
idea that he carried out his responsibilities with character.
     All is exceedingly well in THIRTEEN DAYS until the story begins
drifting back to O'Donnell fretting over his loved ones. Costner is a
much-maligned dramatic actor, and he doesn't do himself favors here with a
honking Boston accent that's borderline absurd next to the subtler
intonations of Greenwood and Culp (as scary a dead ringer for RFK as you
could imagine). When one scene after another in the final half hour of
THIRTEEN DAYS finds Costner staring pensively at one of his children,
sharing a quiet moment with his wife or rubbing his tightly-closed eyes,
it becomes too easy to lose focus on the big picture for some misguided
sense of "humanizing" the story. There are plenty of dramatically
fascinating humans in THIRTEEN DAYS without ever leaving the closed
conference rooms of the White House and the Pentagon. Policy can make
surprisingly intense cinema, without a breakfast table or report card in
sight.

 Thirteen Days (2000) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Kevin Costner,
Bruce Greenwood, Steven Culp, Dylan Baker, Michael Fairman, Kevin
Conway, Christopher Lawford and Len Cariou. Music by Trevor Jones.
Written by David Self. Directed by Roger Donaldson. Rated PG-13.
 The trick with doing movies about historical events is making them
interesting enough to hold the attention of an audience that ó going
into the feature ó already knows the outcome.
 With lesser known historical events ó such as in Glory ó or events from
the more distant past, more dramatic license can be taken.
 But with events that are fresher in peopleís memories, such as Ron
Howardís superb Apollo 13, the trick is to involve the audience in the
behind-the-scenes nuts-and-bolts that helped create or shape the event
as we know it.
 Such is the case with Thirteen Days, a nail-biting retelling of the
Cuban missile crisis. The movie delves into the machinations and policy
decisions that took us from the brink of World War III ó and probable
nuclear annihilation ó to a rational, peaceful resolution.
 What makes Thirteen Days so watchable is that it builds suspense, not
so much from the situation ó we know what is happening and going to
happen there ó but from the conflicts, arguments and clashes amongst the
men entrusted with and burdened by having to make decisions that could
lead ó literally ó to the end of the world.
 Of course, since this is a movie, dramatic license must be taken. And
that is the crux of another problem. For no distinction is made between
fact and fiction.
 When a group of generals leave a White House briefing and complain
about the Kennedys leading this nation to ruin, is that a report of a
factual conversation or a writer's invention to show the military's
disdain for President John F. Kennedy?
 Questions such as these are the movieís minor distraction.
 The story of Thirteen Days is told from the viewpoint of Kenny
OíDonnell (Kevin Costner), President Kennedyís main political adviser.
So, since he is played by Costner has OíDonnellís role in events been
exaggerated or is what is shown on screen the part he really played in
these harrowing events? We donít know because the film expects its
audiences to accept everything as factual.
 Perhaps, these are nitpicks. After all, the overall picture is correct.
The Soviets did bring offensive missiles into Cuba, the U.S. and
U.S.S.R. went eye-to-eye, they blinked and the missiles were withdrawn.
 The bigger picture matches what the history books say.
 Thirteen Days is an actor's showcase, especially for two reliable, but
not box-office name performers: Bruce Greenwood as President Kennedy and
Steven Culp as his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy.
Greenwood, best known as the star of the short-lived Fox series Nowhere
Man as well as for playing Ashley Juddís villainous husband in Double
Jeopardy, stands head and shoulders above any other actor who has
portrayed Kennedy. Here he plays a young president who is still
untested, who really has not gained the respect of those ó especially in
the military and intelligence communities ó who supposedly are under his
command.
 Greenwood shows the burden of decision making actually weighing down
Kennedy as he takes to his rocking chair to ruminate on what course to
follow and the consequences of whatever action he chooses.
 Culp is dynamic as the younger brother who pushes the presidentís
advisers to devise a solution that does not include military action or
escalation. He is the moral voice, keeping a leash on the military who
so eagerly want to invade Cuba to make up for the Bay of Pigs fiasco.
 Either or both are deserving of Academy Award recognition in the
supporting actor category.
 And then there is Costner. His Boston accent is atrocious and
amateurish. He almost stalls the entire production whenever he is on
screen and opens his mouth. It would have been better if he had just
taken his producerís credit and not stepped in front of the camera.
 David Selfís script is riveting, capturing the tension of not only the
men in power, but of a nation as a whole as it gears itself for the
unthinkable. He accomplishes this through images such as churches
holding around-the-clock confessionals and common people reading the
newspapers, their brows furrowed, worry creeping onto their faces and
fear into their eyes.
 Director Roger Donaldsonís does a very good job of staging scenes of
verbal confrontations; the best being the famous U.N. debate in which
U.S. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson (a wonderfully understated performance
by Michael Fairman) confronts the Soviet ambassador at a Security
Council meeting over the issue of missiles in Cuba.
 Donaldsonís one misstep was his decision to fade from color to black
and white during certain scenes involving either the Kennedys or one of
the brothers with OíDonnell. It seemed arbitrary and distracting.
 These minor faults, though, should not detract from the overall power
of Thirteen Days. It is a grim reminder of how close we came to
self-destruction, as well as a triumphant celebration of man's ability
to stare into the brink and have the courage, fortitude and intelligence
to avoid his folly and back away.

That's it.  The nostalgia trip is heading for a long walk off of a short
pier.  I mean, really, who pitched this movie, and how did they pull it
off?  Was it, "Come on, let's revisit those good old days when we were
worried the reds would nuke the crap outta us."  Or, "It's potential
nuclear holocaust... with a heart."  And, if I didn't know the answer to
the question of what moronic producer would buy the rights to the
project (I'll give you a hint: he's also the film's biggest star), I'd
ask that, too.
Thirteen Days, the second film of 2000 to do a number on the
Massachusetts accent (really, you should hear Costner, he sounds like a
drunk New Jerseyite), deals with a time period of 13 days during which
we almost destroyed the world.  No, it's not Crimson Tide, Part 2.  It's
the Cuban Missle Crisis, and it's presented here to us by the incapable
hands of director Roger Donaldson, who gives us such terrors as the
"artistic" blending of black and white and a digitally constructed White
House exterior.  And, spending two-and-a-half hours exploring as few
facets of this story as possible, Roger Donaldson tries to keep us
guessing.  His goofy mind tricks are so incompetent that, at one point
as the film underwent technical difficulties, I had to just yell out,
"So come on, did we all die or what?"
There really isn't much that I can tell you about the events within
Thirteen Days that you can't read in books, but in case you never
attended junior high and think the Cuban Missile Crisis was a bad porno,
here's the story: In 1962, the Soviets began putting nukes in Cuba,
hoping to blow us away.  Forget the fact that we had missiles in Europe
and had similar attack capabilities -- the Soviets could have blown us
away in about five minutes, and, as Americans, we were really pissed off
about this.
Admittedly, the Cuban Missile Crisis was a bit before my time, but come
on, do we have to see the movie?  And even if we have to see the movie,
does it have to be this bad?  Every time a new character is introduced,
they come complete with a subtitle bearing their name and position, and
are then greeted.  It's surprising Bruce Greenwood doesn't wear a
nametag that reads, "Hello, My name is Mr. President."
Dramatic family montages, cheap stock footage, cliched characters,
they're all here.  And, even worse, the film drags on for the
aforementioned 2 1/2 hours, all failing to build even a semblance of
suspense.  Imagine Apollo 13 if it were made really badly -- bad
filmmaking coupled with an ending that you can't change (though
Donaldson actually tries to trick us at many points by interspersing
stock footage of nuclear explosions into the movie, we know better). 
The result is not a reliving of the Cuban Missile Crisis: It's a
sickening exploitation of a historical event.  Don't believe me?  Go to
the movie's web site (see below) and check out the strategic military
exercise, a game in which it's your patriotic responsibility to destroy
all Russian forces.

Unlike many Januarys, this month offers almost too many good releases to 
cover.
Director Roger Donaldson does a dynamic job with historic material  namely, 
the Cuban missile crisis of October, 1962  in the new film THIRTEEN DAYS.
Think it might be boring because it features politicians and events covered 
briefly in history books?  Think again.
Bruce Greenwood plays President John F. Kennedy facing a situation that 
would define him as a leader.  Several months after the U.S.-supported 
invasion of Cuba failed (the Bay of Pigs), the Kennedy administration is 
confronted by perhaps the hardest fact of the Cold War.  The Soviet Union is 
raising their level of support for Fidel Castro and his Communist regime in 
Cuba.  Building a missile base on the island of Cuba, just 90 miles from the 
mainland United States, is unacceptable.  Because the missiles are some of 
the most dangerous nuclear weapons the world has seen, action is compulsory. 
  Of course the pressure on the young president and his cabinet is great.
Kevin Costner plays Kenny O'Donnell, a character who is a composite of JFK's 
advisors.  It's been said that Costner made the right decision in not 
playing either Kennedy or his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy.  
Certainly this is the strongest performance and the strongest material 
turned in by Costner in some time.  We see O'Donnell's life divided between 
family and job: as we see, family life is disrupted greatly.  One reason 
Costner was smart to take the O'Donnell role is that his character is the 
pivot of the narrative.  O'Donnell has probably several more minutes than 
anyone else, and we see the action through this unassuming narrator.
The script and direction are equally competent in keeping the story moving.  
With the help of many documents obtained only recently by the National 
Archives, the movie enables us to see the crisis from many vantages.  One 
key fact long hidden by government safekeepers:  Russian commanders in Cuba 
possessed tactical nuclear weapons, bombs that could have proven devastating 
to our troops and ordnance in any short of conflict.
Greenwood plays the President well.  He never goes over the top, and his New 
England accent is not distracting.  The actor playing Robert, Steven Culp, 
has actually appeared in the role previously, and his looks and manner are 
striking.  We especially sympathize with this powerful politician during a 
scene in which Kenny O'Donnell is driving him to his office to meet with the 
Russian foreign minister.  Bobby Kennedy expresses exhaustion and 
frustration with his reputation of being ruthless.
Costner is the star of this film.  Although his own accent (his character 
grew up knowing the Kennedys) is at times distracting, this veteran actor is 
able to convince us thoroughly.  We get a sense of several dimensions of the 
Washington power structure, and we see just how important are presidential 
advisors in striking deals and averting crises.  The scenes featuring 
O'Donnell's family nicely evoke the American scene of the early 1960's.
Henry Strozier is strong as one of Kennedy's more prominent cabinet members, 
Secretary of State, even though his role is small.  In an even tinier role, 
Walter Adrian speaks one line as vice president Lyndon Baines Johnson.  
Frank Wood portrays McGeorge Bundy, and Janet Coleman is the President's 
secretary, Evelyn Lincoln.
The star of the support cast is Dylan Baker as Secretary of Defense Robert 
McNamara.  This role lets Baker portray the guts it must have taken to stare 
down not only the `Red Menace' but also the hawkish American generals who 
were dubious of the President's methods of operation.
THIRTEEN DAYS would be especially effective for students in high school 
Government or American History classes.  It's a good story set in a vastly 
important time in American history, and it's told with a quick pace and 
timeless tension.  Donaldson also does a nice job paying tribute to the 
Kennedy brothers, without getting too much into the cults of personality and 
family surrounding them.  Ultimately the story honors their memories, as 
well as the spirit of America itself, at the heart of which is freedom.

The Cuban Missile Crisis of the early 1960s are re-visited in this docudrama 
that tells the story behind the headlines, of what was going on in the JFK 
Whitehouse at the time (or what MAY have been going on, this is a movie after 
all and Hollywood has a tendency to exaggerate). 
The film is able to take a real-life situation and exploit it for its 
intensity without making it seem like a cliche, half-baked action flick. 
Everything shown on camera has some documented truth to it so it's kind of 
like being brought back to the actual situation and reliving it all. The cast 
is made up mostly of obscure working actors who all shine beautifully. 
The entire movie is one really long intense moment, like those parts in 
regular thrillers where the heroes have to make a quick, crucial decision, 
only here it's compounded tenfold and never comes off as trite or lame. 
Kevin Costner seems to have been cast simply to give the movie a name to sell 
to the public, which is unfortunate because he's terrible at faking accents 
and quite distracting here. The film also wastes time by trying to play up 
the sentimental angle of showing Costner's family being so distraught by the 
crisis. The whole country is feeling the exact same way so it's pretty much a 
given families might experience a lot of grief and still be brought closer 
together in the end. 
Movies about war have been done to death, but what makes "Thirteen Days" 
stand out is that it's about AVOIDING war. And not just any kind of war, 
nuclear war, which could have very well spelled the end of the modern world 
as we knew it had it happened. 
I'm not a history major and I doubt much of the audience attending this film 
will be either, but that's okay because virtually the entire story is one big 
history lesson. The Cold War was a bitter, intense standoff that lasted 
decades between the United States and the Soviet Union but no film has really 
taken the time to tell a smart, detailed story of how it worked at the 
highest level. Here, the story is realistic, most of the characters are 
historical figures who likely did the things they did in this movie. 
For two hours two nations have their fingers on the launch bottom, each 
waiting for the other to blink first. How we managed to not blink is quite 
amazing, and even though you already know the outcome before you even see the 
movie it's still fascinating and mysterious. 
One of the best thrillers ever made.

During the Cuban missile crisis, John F. Kennedy faced a real-life 
Armageddon as the world came as close as it ever has to global nuclear 
war.  THIRTEEN DAYS, starring and produced by Kevin Costner, depicts 
this famous period.  As a history lesson, it is absolutely engrossing, 
but, as a movie, it falls short of what it should have been able to 
achieve.  Although the film is well worth seeing and clearly gets a hit, 
with this material it should have gotten a home run.
Directed by Roger Donaldson, whose dubious credentials include his most 
recent films, DANTE'S PEAK and SPECIES, and scripted by David Self, 
whose only credit is the laughably bad THE HAUNTING, THIRTEEN DAYS is 
perhaps as good as could be expected.  
With a gratingly exaggerated accent, Costner, playing Kennedy's special 
assistant and personal friend, Kenny O'Donnell, manages to upstage his 
boss in most of their scenes.   Bruce Greenwood plays John Kennedy as a 
brooding, withdrawn type whose real genius was to pick the best advice 
from conflicting advisors.  Greenwood's bland performance is emblematic 
of what is wrong with the movie, namely that it gets itself bogged down 
in long, slowly paced interior scenes in which the strategy is planned.  
But when the movie cuts back and forth between the politics on the 
ground and the excitement of the ships at sea and the planes in the air, 
the film really comes alive.
The story happens in October of 1962.  In the midst of the mid-term 
election in the United States, a U2 spy plane, high over Cuba, takes a 
picture of Russian missiles, not yet armed, being put into place.  
Pointed at the United States, these missiles could reach almost as far 
as Seattle and could kill most American citizens within minutes.  This 
would give the Russians a first-strike capability and forever upset the 
world's balance of power.
We had to force the Russians to back down, but how?  Gen. Maxwell Taylor 
(Bill Smitrovich), Gen. Curtis LeMay (Kevin Conway) and the rest of the 
military brass counsel the president to strike before the missiles are 
operational and be prepared to wage nuclear war when, and if, the 
Russians retaliate.  LeMay, for one, figures that the Russians will not 
strike back because they will be afraid of starting a nuclear holocaust.  
Kenny O'Donnell and Robert Kennedy (Steven Culp), on the other hand, 
believe that a more peaceful solution must exist.  With much difficulty, 
Robert Kennedy forces the Pentagon to reveal the blockade strategy which 
they had been holding back.  This is the approach that the president, 
after much agonizing, finally adopts.  It is only partially successful.  
As we now know, the blockade, combined with some skillful negotiation 
and some fortuitous incidents, eventually caused the Russians to 
dismantle their missiles.
Trevor Jones's music for the picture is the old-fashioned melodramatic 
type.  The big black limos used by the government officials are mainly 
1959 Cadillacs, probably because they featured the biggest and most 
ridiculous tailfins ever.  But the acting is generally too reserved.  
When the director allows emotions to come to the surface, the movie has 
the impact that it should.  After all, these guys were debating nuclear 
war, not some military procurement bill.  After his Bay of Pigs fiasco, 
one can reasonably expect President Kennedy to have gotten quite 
emotionally involved in his Cuban missile crisis.
THIRTEEN DAYS is definitely a movie with an explicit message.  The 
military boys with their toys cannot be trusted.  The politicians, on 
both sides, are the self-proclaimed "good men," who are ready and 
willing to save us from the military's proclivity to go to war.  Besides 
the fantastic history lesson, the movie leaves us to ponder the veracity 
of its anti-military message and to wonder how much revisionist history 
is taking place.
THIRTEEN DAYS runs a long 2:25.  It is rated PG-13 for brief strong 
language and would be acceptable for any kid old enough to be interested 
in this period in history.

In October of 1962 the United States found itself on the brink of nuclear 
holocaust when U2 spy plane fly-overs of Cuba revealed that the Soviet 
Union was actively deploying and installing medium range ballistic missiles 
90 miles from the US. President John Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) and his 
staff must face this major threat to world peace and stop Soviet 
expansionism in director Roger Donaldson's dramatic recreation of the most 
dangerous crisis in American history in "Thirteen Days." 
One of the highlights to come out of made-for-TV movies was a 1974 entry 
called "Missiles of October" that also recreated the historic event that 
almost embroiled the US, USSR and the world in an all out nuclear showdown. 
That teleplay, starring William Devane and Martin Sheen as John and Bobby, 
showed the political tensions of the period that brought to the fore the 
danger the world faced in those two weeks in 1962. Now, a quarter of a 
century after the landmark TV movie, director Roger Donaldson and producer 
Kevin Costner team together again (the last time was for the taught spy 
thriller "No Way Out") to re-enact the events of that most dangerous time 
in America's and the world's history. 
Taken from the viewpoint of Special Assistant to the President Kenneth P. 
O'Donnell (Costner), Donaldson and crew recreate that volatile event, once 
again, as the country is plunged into what could have been total nuclear 
war. As O'Donnell gets ready to head to work one October morning, he deals 
with the usual family crises and problems. Meanwhile, a U2 spy plane photo 
mission over Cuba has produced some startling images - medium range nuclear 
missiles in the first stage of deployment. Suddenly, Ken's routine day 
switches into crisis mode as the President and his key advisor Bobby begin 
to muster the considerable forces of the US military to face the Soviet 
threat. 
Where "Thirteen Days" differs most from "Missiles of October" is, as 
expected, in the scope of the project. There is a big difference, 
budget-wise, between making a television docudrama and one that goes to the 
big screen. It shows as the makers of "Thirteen Days" craft a recreation of 
the Cuban Missile Crisis that encompasses not only the political intrigue 
within the White House, it also depicts the events that took place as 
America girds itself for nuclear confrontation. 
The cast, a true ensemble, is led, surprisingly, by Bruce Greenwood as JFK 
and not by Kevin Costner. Costner's O'Donnell represents the family guy 
thing as the drama of the crisis has its impact on him and his family. This 
puts a personal spin on the film as we see both the crisis and America's 
preparation for war and the pressure it brings to bear on those in the 
know. Kenny reassures his wife and kids that all will be okay and they will 
be safe, but he knows that, if the crisis comes to a head, his family will 
be no more. The meat of "Thirteen Days" is in the big picture, not the 
microcosm of family, though. 
This is where the film stands out as we see the workings of our government 
on the highest levels. The story does not just cover the face-off between 
the world's two most powerful countries; it also depicts the animosity 
between the president and the military/CIA. The disaster of the Bay of Pigs 
invasion the year before left a distrustful taste in the mouths of the 
generals and admirals who blame the Kennedys for not backing the Cuban 
expatriates fighting Fidel Castro. The missile crisis becomes a struggle 
for power as the Army/Navy/Air Force want to flex their might and invade 
Cuba, while JFK wants to end the confrontation peaceably but with America's 
dignity and world leadership intact. 
While the internal battle for power rages in the White House, with Air 
Force chief Curtis LeMay (Kevin Conway) advising the president to bomb Cuba 
into the stone age, our armed forces are set into motion to stop the 
Soviets with a blockade of offensive weapons to Cuba. This is where the 
political intrigues of high office are replaced by exciting action. When 
the first confrontation takes place between a US warship and a Soviet 
freighter, the tension is palpable. The most involving action sequence 
takes place late in the game as another U2 is sent up to shoot some snaps 
of the buildup and the fully prepared Soviet forces launch an anti-aircraft 
attack on the hapless pilot of the spy plane. This is a sweaty palm 
sequence to say the least, making you squirm in your seat as you try to 
help the pilot avoid those missiles. 
The ensemble cast places Greenwood as the first among equals with like 
weight given to all the principle players. Greenwood does not play act at 
being a caricature of JFK, foregoing the typical Kennedy Boston accent. 
Instead, he plays the man as a powerful figure who has to maintain the 
dignity of the office, directing his subordinates but giving them the 
latitude to make clear all of his options. Kennedy used this decision by 
committee method to good effect as his senior staff uncovers all the 
options available to the president. Costner, as Ken O'Donnell, is really a 
supporting cast member as a Kennedy crony brought on board as a personal 
political favor. Costner plays O'Donnell as if he crammed on old JFK 
speeches with a forced Kennedyesque twang to his speech. 
The rest of the players are first rate from start to finish with Steven 
Culp looking and sounding just like Robert Kennedy. The rest of the 
familiar players in this drama are uniformly well cast, too. Standing out 
are Michael Fairman as the beleaguered US Ambassador to the UN, Adlai 
Stevenson, who was forced to become the challenging voice of the United 
States in the United Nations and I remember the confrontation vividly. The 
filmmakers capture the accusations laid down by Stevenson with accuracy, 
using old style video footage to good effect. Dylan Baker has the look and 
feel of the intelligentsia as the brainy Secretary of Defense Robert 
McNamara. Kevin Conway gives his General LeMay the right "bomb them to 
hell" attitude. Also notable is Christopher Lawford as navy pilot William 
Ecker who, with his wingman, takes on the dangerous mission of a low-level 
photo recon into the heart of Cuba, bravely challenging Kenny O'Donnell's 
admonition, "Don' get shot." 
Tech credits are superb across the board with an admirable depiction of the 
US armed forces being placed on a war footing. It's an impressive 
production with the careful use of period aircraft and ships that gives the 
film a veracity fitting the event. Solid costuming by Isis Mussenden is 
subtle but has the look of the Kennedys. There is the usual array of 
vintage cars from the period to make things look right. The special F/X of 
the U2 sequences are a nice crafting of computer imaging. 
The Cuban Missile Crisis is probably the most intense two weeks that the 
United States has ever faced in its survival as a world leader. Helmer 
Donaldson and his fine crew and cast have given the depiction of this 
crucial event with the care and attention to details that make this one of 
the finest docudramas of the year. I give "Thirteen Days" an A-.
