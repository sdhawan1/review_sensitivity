     The experiment was this:  Make an action/suspense movie that takes
place in *real time.*  That is, ninety minutes of film shows us ninety
consecutive minutes in the lives of the hero and villains.  Real time
has been done before (see also Alfred Hitchcock's ROPE, which is not
only in real time, but has the appearance of being one continuous shot
with no cuts).  Real time has never been done quite like this.
     In NICK OF TIME, director John Badham has taken a traditional
three-act thriller and jammed it into a sparse 90 minutes.  The plot
follows accountant Gene Watson (Johnny Depp), now a single father of
seven-year old Lynn (Courtney Chase).  Arriving at Union Station in
downtown Los Angeles, Gene and Lynn are picked from the crowd by the
enigmatic Mr. Smith (Christopher Walken) for a devious task.  Smith
gives Gene a gun and a little over an hour to commit a murder or else
his daughter will be killed.  The catch?  The target is the governor of
California (Marsha Mason).  Watson then has to balance the life of his
daughter with the far-ranging conspiracy he finds himself caught up
in.  And time is running out.
     The main problem is that the plot is basically silly, because
*everywhere* Watson goes, he finds another flunkie working for Smith.
Even some of those closest to the governor are in on it, any number of
whom could pull the trigger, certainly better than some accountant
picked from the train station.  But Smith's scheme is to frame Watson
as a nut case so Smith can walk off scott free, and because Smith
follows the flustered Watson around all the time, after forty-five
minutes you know he'd be better off letting Watson go and shooting the
governor himself, just to end the hassle.
     Good pacing and the experimental nature of the film tend to
overcome the lack of an engaging plot.  Of course, real time generally
means dead time, and Badham does a good job at keeping things moving so
you never get bored.  I'm not sure what it says about the film, but
keeping track of whether they're really on schedule with the frequent
shots of clocks is as much fun as watching the movie itself.  The
numerous scares indigenous to the thriller genre are also plentiful.
     Depp's acting is plain, and Walken hams it up until his character
has become the typical complete joke that he's becoming well-known
for.  The horrid Roma Maffia, as Smith's sidekick, almost manages to
bring the film crashing down, but she thankfully doesn't have enough
lines to cause too much damage.  Worth watching for is Charles Dutton
as a crusty, disabled shoe shine man who becomes Watson's only friend
and ally.
     Given that NICK OF TIME won't be a smashing success, it'll be some
time before the real-time experiment is tried again.  I'm looking
forward to another one, though.  But next time, folks, lets try to get
some criminals that aren't so completely stupid.

*** (out of 3 = good)
1996, R, 89 minutes [1 hour, 29 minutes]
[thriller]
starring: Johnny Depp (Gene Watson), Christopher Walken (Mr. Smith), Marsha
Mason (Gov. Eleanor Grant), Charles S. Dutton (Huey), written by Patrick
Sheane Duncan, produced and directed by John Badham.
"Nick Of Time" might not be the greatest film ever made but it is definitely
a landmark in filmmaking as it takes place in actual, real time. It does
become the standard thriller it is trying to avoid, but it's always
interesting and fun to watch.
Criminals tend to be pretty dumb in the movies, but here we get a conspiracy
to kill a governor through a brilliant method - by blackmailing a common
person into committing the act for them. The only problem here is that the
people who want to assassinate this person are nearly all the members of her
security force and even her husband.
Johnny Depp stars as Gene Watson, an accountant who is about to board a
train with his young daughter when he is stopped by who he believes to be
police. These people turn out to be terrorists of sorts who threaten to kill
him and his daughter if he doesn't assassinate Gov. Eleanor Grant (Mason) in
90 minutes. Their calculated and precise method of operation is impressive,
and shows achievement on behalf of the film's writer, Patrick Sheane Duncan
("Circle Of Friends," "Mr. Holland's Opus").
The immediate sense of shock and fear displayed by Depp is sympathetic,
especially considering how vile Walken is as Mr. Smith - the man constantly
watching him. Smith almost has a supernatural presence because everywhere
Watson turns he sees him and cannot avoid him. In a way this makes the story
a little too sensationalized, but it does enhance the chilling, suspenseful
mood.
In the course of an hour and a half, Watson goes from ordinary John Doe to
Batman. The clock is constantly ticking and his mind is racing. If he kills
the governor he will probably be killed too, but if he doesn't he and his
daughter will both be killed. It's a no-win situation, but somehow Watson
keeps his cool.
Watson puts together a mini-conspiracy of his own, as he befriends Huey
(Dutton), a brave shoe-shine man, along with threatening one of Gov. Grant's
top aides, and even confronting the governor himself. All of the individual
scenes are quickly paced and detailed, and surprisingly enough, I didn't find
myself doubting the credibility.
Still, "Nick Of Time" is a good, solid movie that is unlike anything I've
seen in a long time. It's not the most realistic story, but it works for what
it is. Maybe it does become a bit cliche, but its overall originality and
actual breakdown work fine.

     In the thriller NICK OF TIME, the ludicrously malevolent duo of
Christopher Walken and Roma Maffia select from a train station crowd
accountant Johnny Depp and his six-year old daughter Courtney Chase.
They seize them, put them in a van.  Depp is handed a revolver and
ordered to go to a big political shindig at Los Angeles' Bonaventure
Hotel.There he must kill California Governor Marsha Mason who is on a
re-election campaign.  It is 12:16 pm.  If by 1:30 the Governor is not
dead, Depp's child will be executed.
     Panicked and confused, increasingly desperate to find a way out,
Depp makes several attempts at warning the Governor, but they are all
foiled by Walken who is omnipresent.  Until, that is ... but I'm not
telling.
     There are five principles or guidelines or formulae governing the
thriller NICK OF TIME.  Not all of them work here but they all add
pizzazz and excitement to the movie.
     One principle is that political conspiracy is a subject so
believable that it can paper over at least some of a film's
impossibilities, especially a film like this one, as opposed to, for
instance, the far more credible THE PARALLAX VIEW.
     Another is "real time," where action and viewing time are the
same.  Then we get The Worm Turning, as Depp finds unsuspected
strength.  Fourth and fifth are The Countdown and The Missing Finger
principles.
     Real-time has been tried before, sometimes convincingly.  Alfred
Hitchcock's ROPE, an interesting experiment of ten-minute takes,
strains at the seams to make all its events fit the movie's running
time. "High Noon" does surprisingly well with its packing character
depiction and development in its 84 "real time" minutes.  The best
example I can think of is a sad one, since the filmmaker died so
recently.  It is Louis Malle's MY DINNER WITH ANDRE.
     The Countdown formula is in hundreds of movies.  Clocks and
watches, as in NICK OF TIME, in HIGH NOON, in DR. STRANGELOVE,
in war films, heist, escape, blackmail pictures and a host of other
genres, regularly show the hour and minutes as we near the H-hour.  It
is also done with digital countdown, as in director John Badham's own
WARGAMES.
     The Missing Finger comes from Hitchcock's THE 39 STEPS.  An
innocent visitor in London gets unwittingly involved in a murderous
spying plot, and has to flee.  Reaching Scotland, in a manor Robert
Donat blurts out to his polite host Godfrey Tearle that the ring-leader
has a missing finger. "Like this?" says Tearle, showing his
four-fingered hand.
     This fits Hitchcock's even larger principle of The Wrong Man, and
in thrillers stands for the most unlikely people turning out to be
villains.  In NICK OF TIME, outside and inside the Bonaventure, just
about everyone Depp meets or warns is in cahoots with the plot's
instigators.  The number of conspirators is incredible, whether they
are checkers with metal detectors or portable phones, a man videotaping
the meeting, people in the Governor's entourage, others at the highest
levels of the political scale.
     Helpless Depp goes from one "missing finger" to another.  When he
does find allies they are both African-American, which satisfies the
movie's political correctness and the greedy need for minority
audiences.  The helpers are successively a young woman then a
one-legged Vietnam veteran shoeshine man Charles S.Dutton.
     Most of the film is incredible.  Item: why doesn't Walken "wire"
Depp so as to hear everything he says?  Item: why Depp, watched by
Walken, thinks he can talk to Dutton undetected by Walken, simply by
covering his mouth with his fingers?  Item: why does Walken not notice
this?  Item: how does Dutton enlist aid so lightning fast and organize
resistance?  Item: what's the vision that Depp has, of successive
killings? Item: how is it that Maffia, trying to shoot the child at
close quarters in the van, keeps missing?
     The list is long.  But what would normally require impossible
suspense of disbelief gets nicely hocus-pocused from the very start by
non-stop suspense, fast action, breathless as well as imaginative
cinematography and editing.  The camera makes you almost dizzy with its
numerous shots, large variety of angles, close-ups, zooms that follow
the action.  The sound too plays effective tricks (from inaudible to
distant to echoey speech and noises) that reflect Depp's agitated
state.
     This a kinetic movie-movie,not an actors' film, so that the
performances are okay.  Except for Maffia's overdone nastiness, most of
the roles are underplayed, each with almost a single expression.  Depp
is Everyman in a nightmarish situation; Walken is satanic; Dutton
colorful but not in an insulting way; the several villainous roles are
properly impassive and you can tell right away whenever a new bad 'un
shows up.
     John Badham is a familiar name.  Writer Patrick Duncan is less
known, yet his credits include the Chuck Norris movie CODE OF SILENCE
(writer); the excellent 84 CHARLIE MOPIC (writer-director); the
little-seen, very good Kathy Bates starrer A HOME OF OUR OWN
(writer-producer).  Coming very soon: THE PORNOGRAPHER
(writer-director) and the Richard Dreyfus opus MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS.

     There are very few films that are shot in "real time," the term
meaning that if the action shown on-screen is supposed to occur over a
two-hour period, the film will be a two-hour film.  NICK OF TIME was
shot with that intent.  It is unlikely that the general audience will
be aware of it.  In any case, NICK OF TIME has little else to
distinguish it from the never-ending number of films that are turned
out each day.
     Like so many other action films, there is a certain amount of
suspense ... but not very much.  This one is about an ordinary man,
Gene Watson (Johnny Depp) who with his daughter, Lynn (Courtney Chase)
are kidnaped by a Mr. Smith (Christopher Walken) and Ms. Jones (Roma
Maffia).  Watson is told that his daughter will be held hostage in a
van until Watson shoots and murders the Governor, Eleanor Grant (Marsha
Mason) who will be appearing at a re-election rally that day.  Watson
gets the usual cautionary talk about "no tricks" or your daughter is
dead.  And that in essence is the movie's plot. We are indirectly asked
what we would do under such circumstances and with little time to come
up with a feasible plan to thwart the kidnapers.
     If anything saves the film from the rest of this year's action
films, all of which contain the good guys vs. the bad, it is that the
acting here is somewhat better than most films of that ilk.  Johnny
Depp and Christopher Walken are the principals involved in most of the
action.  An important role is played by Huey (Charles S. Dutton) as a
shoeshine man who aids Watson's try to thwart the villains.
     However, the rest of the cast, even those important to the story,
are on the screen only for very short times.  Marsha Mason, Brendan
Grant (as her husband) and even Roma Maffia are only in the film in
short takes, perhaps to keep the film in the "real time."

 NICK OF TIME (director: John Badham; screenwriter: Patrick Sheane
 Duncan; cinematographer: Roy H. Wagner; editors: Frank Moriss/Kevin
 Stitt; cast: Johnny Depp (Gene Watson), Christopher Walken (Mr.
 Smith), Charles S. Dutton (Huey, Shoeshine Man), Peter Strauss
 (Brendan Grant), Gloria Reuben (Krista Brooks), Marsha Mason (Governor
 Eleanor Grant), Courtney Chase (Lynn Watson), G.D. Spradlin (Mystery
 Man), Roma Maffia (Ms. Jones); Runtime: 89; Paramount; 1995)
An Amtrak train pulls into LA with accountant, Gene Watson (Johnny
Depp), and his little daughter Lynn (Chase) aboard. They are approached
in the station by Christopher Walken and Roma Maffia, posing as cops and
telling them they are being brought in for questioning. They are placed
in a van and Walken tells them if Depp hasn't killed the liberal
Governor of California Marsha Mason -- within the next 80 minutes, then
Roma will kill his daughter. The randomly chosen Depp is given a loaded
gun and the governor's schedule for the afternoon, and told in a
snarling tone by Walken that he better kill her.
The gimmicky premise grabs your attention, but the film fails to
maintain its suspense as the story line becomes increasingly more
absurd. Why the nondescript, Everyman character played by Depp, would
believe that Walken wouldn't kill his daughter anyway, even if he did
kill the governor, is just one of the major flaws in this ridiculous
premise.
The action begins to take hold, when Walken follows the conflicted
accountant on his mission and prevents him from telling anyone about
what he's been asked to do. Depp's only source of help, comes
reluctantly from a shoeshine man (Dutton).
The film's main sphere of operation is in the Bonaventure Hotel, where
the governor has  her headquarters and where she is scheduled to give a
speech. Walken keeps his serpentine plan going by constantly threatening
Depp with the loss of his daughter's life if he doesn't do the job.
The blurred reason why the governor must be eliminated, is because a
wealthy backer
wants revenge because she backed out of promises made to him and has
become too liberal. G. D. Spradlin plays this mysterious tycoon.
If you buy into the story line, then you should find the film
suspenseful in the Hitchcock style. If you don't, the only consolation
is that the acting was good. As far as I'm concerned, it was a
preposterous premise and even if believed, the plan was far too risky
and complicated for those involved, and there is no way the high
insiders in the governor's camp wouldn't have come up with another plan
to use, like the usual one of a professional assassin with a
high-powered rifle.
The only surprise the film could have for me, is if both Depp's daughter
and the governor were killed. This unnotable suspense yarn, brings
little to the table and concludes with an unsatisfying ending -- which
was more silly than tense. Director John Badham ("Saturday Night
Fever''/"Stakeout'') tells the story effectively in real time, which
makes it a watchable though forgettable film.

Nick of Time uses a gimmick to get the audience into the movie.  The
gimmick is that for every minute in real time is equal to every minute in
movie time.  Sounds like a bad word problem from math class, right?  But,
it's simple, the events in the movie take place in real time.
In Nick of Time Johnny Depp tries his hands at being an action star.  Depp
plays Gene Watson whose daughter is being held hostage until he can
assassinate the governor of California.  Mr. Watson has exactly 90 minutes
to do it.  And for the audience, since the movie is in real-time, these
seem to be the longest 90 minutes of our lives.
The movie spins a large conspiracy story of why the people who have
Watson's daughter want to kill the governor, but it is not truly revealed
even by the end of the movie.  Watson is brought into the conspiracy, and
spied upon, by a character played by Christopher Walken.
Does the real-time gimmick work?  No, not really.  It actually seems to go
against bringing the audience into the movie.  There are lulls in the movie
when Watson has nothing to do.  And throughout the movie there are shots of
clocks, trying to remind us of how long Watson has to assassinate the
governor, in some sort of way to build tension.  The film comes off looking
cheesy.
Depp fails at becoming an action star with this film.  Moreover he looks
more like a wimp with a gun.  I've never really liked Walken as an actor,
and Nick of Time only goes to show why I don't.  Some actors can give
over-the-top performances and get away with it because they do it so well,
Travolta would be one of those actors.  But, Walken is not.  In Nick of
Time he gives an over-the-top performance, but it falls flat and he looks
more like an amateur actor overacting.
Nick of Time is a bad action film that relies on a cheap gimmick to try to
draw the audience in.  The gimmick fails to work, and one actor who can't
fill the action hero role and one actor who overacts also weight down the
film.  Skip this film unless you want to see the failed gimmick in action.

As the minutes tick away, we get older each day. This is a real time'
movie so let's do this review real time.
12.00pm Depp arrives at the train station with his daughter.
(The door bell rings, it's the Jehovah Witnesses. Oh no not again!)
12.15pm Walken and companion kidnap Depp and his daughter. Kill the
governor, or your little girl dies!'
(Phone call. It's a survey on cars. Do I like B.M.W.s, Mercedes, or
Porsches? I like Toyotas thank-you very much).
12.30pm Depp arrives at the hotel with Walken breathing down his neck.
(Time for a toilet break.)
12.45pm The Governor's in the lift. Here's Depp's opportunity to shoot
her, but the gun's not loaded.
(What shall I have for lunch? Pizza? Kentucky? MacDonald's? Oh what the
heck let's go Italian.)
1.00pm Ooops. Depp's just missed his second opportunity to kill the
governor. The conspiracy unfolds.
(Pause button. Home made Italian -  Bolognese in the microwave. Ugggh!)
1.15pm Depp and the governor have a heart to heart at gun point.
(Dry cleaning, groceries, return the videos and work tomorrow! And
there's still a million and one things to do today.)
1.30m Finale. Finally.
(Now of to the gym before it closes for renovations, and I got there in
the nick of time!)
Ever feel like you were being rushed to finish something. Well that's
what this movie feels like. Too much time focussed on the clock ticking
away, and not enough time spent thinking through the mechanics of the
movie.
Solid performances by Depp and Walken. An original concept, and
occasionally tense.

     Ready for the first completely real-time movie since ROPE?  Ready
to hyperventilate?  With NICK OF TIME Writers Patrick Duncan and Ebbe
Roe Smith have come up with an innovative script that starts at noon on
May the second and rushes like a runaway train to a preannounced climax
at 1:30 PM.  The screenwriters tell you this and then director John
Badham carefully choreographs the actors so that the movie itself takes
exactly one hour and thirty minutes to get there.  Since the dizzying
cinematography by Roy Wagner keeps focusing in on every clock in sight,
the audience becomes obsessed with the time.
     The plot is fairly simple.  Some bad guys led by Mr. Smith
(Christopher Walken) and his sidekick Ms. Jones (Roma Maffia) find an
innocent passenger, Gene Watson (Johnny Depp), and his 5 year old
daughter, Lynn Watson (Courtney Chase), getting off the Amtrak train
that arrives at noon in LA.  They tell Gene that either he agrees to
kill the governor of California, Eleanor Grant (Marsha Mason), by 1:30
PM or Ms. Jones will kill his little girl.  Gene doesn't understand so
Mr. Smith repeats his instructions with a carefully paced cadence, "It
is now 12:16.  If she is alive at 1:30, I call my partner, and your
daughter is dead."
     After many futile attempts to escape, a la the typical innocent
victim of circumstance from a Hitchcock film, Gene begins to realize
that the Mr. Smith is both omniscient and omnipresent.  Whenever Gene
is just about to summon help, Mr. Smith appears and warns him that any
funny business and his little girl will be gone forever.
     Early on we find out that the reason the governor is in trouble is
that she ran as a conservative but turned liberal once elected, and the
conservative special interest groups are angry, especially those
represented by the mysterious man identified in the credits only as the
Mystery Man.  The Mystery Man is played by the veteran actor, G. D.
Spradlin, who was the original evil politician from the Godfather, the
senator that defies the Godfather and then gets a dead horse's head put
in bed with him.  As the governor's husband, Brendan Grant, we have
Peter Strauss.  One of the best minor characters is that of a hotel
shoe shiner named Huey and played by Charles Dutton.  Huey is a real
character who dispenses free advice on life while shining shoes, and he
is one who Gene turns to for help.
     I will not reveal any more details of the movie since working your
way through the maze of the plot in real-time is something you should
experience yourself.  Suffice it to say that it is wrapped up nicely
although you think it is such a conundrum that there is no reasonable
way to end it.  Moreover, it even has a neat and brief epilogue with
one of the key minor characters.
     Johnny Depp is an actor who can play an amazing range characters
from his everyman role in NICK OF TIME to the ones in ED WOOD, BENNY
AND JOON, and EDWARD SCISSORHANDS.  Here he is low key but quite
effective.  I was disappointed by Christopher Walken.  Usually he
dominates any scene he is in with his explosive or potentially
explosive behavior.  Here the director had him under too tight a leash.
Peter Strauss never even attempts acting in the movie.  His role could
have added to the tension, but Strauss's lack of energy only serves to
dampen it.  G. D. Spradlin played his part as a cliche of an evil
millionaire, but the role demanded better.  My favorite actor in the
movie was Marsha Mason.  She was totally believable and brought a lot
to a small but crucial role.  She plays a spunky politician that looks
a little like California Senator Barbara Boxer.  Here Mason manages to
be both in command as a Governor and vulnerable as a human being when
faced with a mad assassin.
     The script is fun, and the real-time aspects work.  The dialog is
nothing special however, and most of the characters should have been
better written.  The cinematography is outstanding on many levels in
the way it conveys the hopelessness and the confusion of the main
character.  We get unsteady views as if from Gene's eyes.  In other
scenes extreme wide angles are used to show how distorted the world
feels to him.  In still other scenes we have rapid zoom outs to show
how isolated he is.  The glass elevator in the hotel is used as a
metaphor in the camera work to show how vulnerable Gene is.  Finally,
the sets by Philip Harrison and the music by Arthur Rubinstein help to
portray the overwhelming feeling of desperation.
     NICK OF TIME runs, and I do mean runs, a little over an hour and a
half.  It is rated R for some bad language and some shot 'em up
violence, but without much blood.  There is no sex or nudity.  I think
it is a soft R, and I would have no problems with teenagers going.  One
family in our theater brought in their 3 and 8 year olds, which was
just plain stupid - it is not PG-13 material.  I recommend the movie to
you and give it ** 1/2.

        As Perot would say, this is just sa-a-a-a-ad. NICK OF TIME 
openly rips off Hitchcock by exploiting the fact that it is filmed in 
"real time" (that is, one screen minute equals one real life minute -- no 
cutting to later that day or two weeks later), but it's all boring enough 
that it resembles life's real time. I've already written about movies that
are boring and padded and still only ninety minutes long and NICK 
OF TIME is definitely one of those. It could have been an hour-long 
episode of any one of the "Playhouse" shows of the 50's and 60's or 
maybe a half-hour tale from the crypt today.
        The film opens with a giant closeup of a clock. Get used to 
that image because you'll see at least fifty others before NICK OF 
TIME is over. The director constantly and needlessly shoves the 
real-time thing in our faces and -- you know what? -- it isn't even 
accurate. By the time the movie clock goes from 12:00 to 1:30pm, 
only seventy-six minutes have passed. So much for the integrity 
of "real time."
        Johnny Depp plays a CPA who is unwillingly drawn into a 
murder conspiracy as Christopher Walken approaches him and his 
young daughter in a bus station, flashing a badge and asking in his 
usual creepy tone if Depp will accompany him to his van. He does 
and, once he gets there, he discovers his daughter will be held 
hostage by Walken's accomplice until Depp assassinates the 
governor. Any attempt to tell the police or anyone else about 
his dilemma will bring instant death to his daughter.
        So, for the next hour or so, Depp wanders aimlessly around 
a hotel with gun in pocket, making repeated attempts to tell people 
his "big problem," after which Walken will pop up and remind him 
his daughter will die if he doesn't kill the governor by 1:30. Soon 
enough, we discover almost everyone in the governor's administration 
is in on the conspiracy, which raises an inevitable question. If people 
on the inside are involved in this, why wouldn't one of them 
orchestrate the murder himself instead of having Walken find 
a guy off the street to kill her? I mean, if it was just Walken and 
his accomplice acting out some terrorist fantasy, it would make 
sense, but if the governor's own husband wants her dead, he can 
find a way to do it and make it look like an accident. But then we 
wouldn't have a plot, would we?
        NICK OF TIME mixes a gimmick and premise that could 
have worked incredibly well together and instead drives it into the 
ground by showing us a lot of nothing. The whole movie is basically 
Depp wandering around aimlessly with Walken in the background, 
making sure he doesn't go to the police. And those closeups of the 
clock get old fast. As far as the whole time metaphor goes, I'd only 
suggest watching NICK OF TIME on the October night we turn our 
clocks back. That way, you'll only waste half-an-hour on this lifeless 
thriller instead of the full ninety minutes.

     "Real terror in real time":  that's what NICK OF TIME promises.
Unfortunately, that's not what it delivers.  Sure, the film unfolds with
one minute of screen time equaling one minute of theater time, but
there's no hint of tension.  About the only thing John Badham's lamely-
directed thriller has in common with an Alfred Hitchcock production is
the blatant rip-off of a camera shot from VERTIGO.  And such an obvious
reminder of the master serves to underline how poor this effort is.
     As a lead in a romantic comedy or a drama, Johnny Depp has shown
considerable screen presence.  Based on this performance, however, he's
not cut out for thrillers.  His Gene Watson is so incredibly bland that
it's difficult to stay with him through ninety minutes.  We need bad
guys Christopher Walken and Roma Maffia to liven things up.
     The premise, which is a case of wasted potential, has Watson and
his young daughter, Lynn (Courtney Chase), disembarking from an Amtrack
train in Los Angeles.  As they're making their way through the station,
Lynn is kidnapped and Gene is told that the only way he'll see her alive
again is if he takes a gun and assassinates the liberal governor of
California (Marsha Mason).  Just to make sure he doesn't get cold feet
or try to run to the nearest police officer, one of the bad guys
(Walken) will be close at all times.
     NICK OF TIME relies on a bunch of easily-predicted "twists" to keep
it moving.  The real reason that Walken's character wants the governor
dead turns out to be incredibly feeble.  Then there's the question of
why the assassination plan has to be so convoluted, especially when
almost everyone on the governor's staff appears to be involved.  This
motion picture rarely makes sense, even when you're not thinking too
deeply about what's going on.
     One has to question why Paramount chose to release this film as
their big Thanksgiving offering.  Originally, their intention was to
open Tom Cruise's MISSION IMPOSSIBLE for the holiday, but those plans
were scrapped early in the year.  NICK OF TIME is a poor replacement,
but there's a certain justice in showing this movie around the time of
year best known for turkeys.

Der Geschäftsreisende Gene Watson kehrt gerade von der Beerdigung seiner
(fast) geschiedenen Frau aus San Diego zurück und will am Bahnhof
eigentlich nur kurz ein Telefonat führen, bevor er mit seiner kleinen
Tochter weiterfährt. Dummerweise wird er von dem Killerpärchen Mr. Smith
und Ms. Jones (kennen wir das nicht irgendwoher?) auserkoren, die
Gouverneurin Eleanor Grant zu erschießen, während sie in einem großen Hotel
verschiedene Reden halten wird. Er bekommt eine Waffe und das Versprechen,
seine Tochter werde in knapp 90 Minuten tot sein, wenn er seinen Auftrag
nicht ausgeführt hat. Gene versucht sich an die Polizei zu wenden, doch
jeder scheint an der Verschwörung beteiligt zu sein, und die Uhr tickt...
Wer schonmal ein Fertiggericht in der Mikrowelle aufgewärmt hat, weiß, wie
lange eine Minute dauern kann. Wer "Gegen die Zeit" gesehen hat, der wird
sich wundern, wie schnell 90 Minuten vorübergehen können, denn
Regie-Veteran John Badham ("Saturday Night Fever", "Drop Zone") hat einen
fast schon unmenschlich spannenden Echtzeithriller hingelegt, der für eine
Videopremiere schon fast zu schade ist. Johnny Depp glänzt als junger,
verzweifelter Vater, denn selbst wenn er mit seinen kargen Dialogen nicht
viel aus seiner Figur machen kann, ist es seine Ausstrahlung, die ihn zur
perfekten Identifikationsfigur macht. Den besten Part hat allerdings
Christopher Walken abbekommen, denn in "Gegen die Zeit" spielt er nicht nur
einfach den perfekten, allwissenden Killer, sondern hat mit den gleichen
Schwierigkeiten zu kämpfen wie sein Opfer, als da wären Menschenmengen,
Funkstörungen und "gewissen" Bedürfnissen nach einem Drink. Das macht ihn
nicht nur menschlicher, sondern verleiht dem Film auch echte Spannung, wie
man sie nur selten erlebt, denn hier kann man sich wirklich fragen: weiß
der Killer Bescheid? Hat er's gesehen? Knackpunkt am Film ist natürlich
seine an den Haaren herbeigezogene Story, die in sich keinen Sinn macht,
ihre Abgedrehtheit aber vollends ausspielt, denn Regisseur Badham weiß, wie
er aus den kurzen, aber knackigen Höhepunkten seines Film am meisten macht:
mit schwindelerregenden Zeitlupen, mehrfachen Kamerafahrten an seine
Hauptdarsteller heran und Vorrausdeutungen im Dutzendpack gelingt es ihm
spielend, den Zuschauer von den bohrenden Fragen nach dem "Warum"
abzulenken. Und das muß ein Film erstmal schaffen. Das Finale ist zwar
etwas vorraussehbar geworden, trotzdem ein würdiger Abschluß für einen
unterschätzten Film.
