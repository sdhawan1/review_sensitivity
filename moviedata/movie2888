Director Darren Stein's debut film is on the flip side of the coin
occupied by his recently released, much-maligned sophomore effort,
_Jawbreaker_ (which I actually happened to like).  The micro-budgeted indie
_Sparkler_ is as grainy and rough around the edges as the studio effort
_Jawbreaker_ was slick and flashy.  The "sparkler" of the title, trailer
park queen Melba May (Park Overall), is as sweet and good-natured as
_Jawbreaker_'s main character, high school uberbitch Courtney Shayne, was
unrepentantly evil.
However, there is one overlying thing that the films have in common: in
both, Stein is aping the voice of other, better directors.  While he
channelled _Heathers_'s Michael Lehmann and _Clueless_'s Amy Heckerling in
_Jawbreaker_, in _Sparkler_, Stein goes after the demented vibe of John
Waters. Our white trash main character travels from Victorville, California
to Las Vegas to find a trio of young men (Freddie Prinze Jr., Jamie
Kennedy, and Steven Petrarca) she met by chance at a local bar.  Along the
way, she and the audience encounters such Waters-esque touches as
underground strip clubs and a butch lesbian wearing a T-shirt reading
"PUSSYWHIPPED."  The difference there isn't enough energy to the direction
to hide the fact that there is really no plot, just some loosely
strung-together of individual events; nor is there enough to make anything
barely cross the "amusing" mark.  (now playing in New York; opens in Los
Angeles April 2)

When a film begins with a big truck slowly coming to a stop on a plastic
Bambi yard ornament, I get the feeling I'm going to be entertained.
Melba (Park Overall) and Flint (Don Harvery), the Fred and Wilma of
Victorville, live a blissful small town life until Melba catches Flint and
her best friend with their pants down. Sweet naive Melba swallows her tears,
dumps her white trash hubby, dolls up in her mother's best 1950's sparkly
jumper, and heads out for a night on the town. On the way, she crosses paths
with three rich, Las Vegas bound, brats from L.A. (one of which is Freddie
Prinze Jr.).
The three little kings ditch her, but Melba is the country cat that just
keeps coming back to find them.
Written and directed in a Fargo-esque kind of way, "Sparkler" brings real
life and coincidence together making for a fun quirky movie. I also
appreciated the true-to-life dialogue and attention to small detail.
