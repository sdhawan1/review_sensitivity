I agree with most critics that this is a fine movie, but let's be frank
here, originality ain't this movie's strong suit! If you liked any
combination of the following movies, you will probably enjoy the goings-on
in this film, despite its deja-vu feel at times: ROUNDERS (7/10), RESERVOIR
DOGS (9.5/10), OUT OF SIGHT (8/10), TRUE ROMANCE (9.5/10), TRAINSPOTTING
(9/10) and PULP FICTION (7.5/10).
PLOT:
Four dudes that get in over their head after losing a chunk of dough in a
poker match to a really nasty, bad guy, have to figure out a way to repay
the man half a million pounds before the end of the week. Plenty of crime,
seedy, underground characters and unpleasantries ensue.
CRITIQUE:
Fun, interesting, rehash of yet another crime caper starring a sackful of
quirky and degenerate characters, which features some fine acting by all
involved, a hot-dogging soundtrack, and some of the finer stylish shots to
hit crime cinema since 1996's TRAINSPOTTING. Granted, some of the filming
techniques used to stir our imagination are somewhat overused, but still
cool to watch, especially the stop-motion slo-mo stuff sprinkled throughout.
I did enjoy the plot line as well, but my rating of this film versus all of
the others mentioned above, gives you an indication of how derivatives of a
great thing, don't always impact the viewer as much as the originals did.
That, and the fact that I had to filter out a good lump of the dialogue due
to the ol' British accents and slang.
Unlike Tarantino movies, this film wasn't peppered with pop references all
over the place, but it did lace itself with a fine overtone of comedy and
irony. It doesn't even try to hide its influences, with plenty of hinted
homages to the many recent great crime films mixed into its lair of colorful
characters, stylish bravado and double-smoking entertainment. You'll
probably like this movie if you're "into" this whole hip, black comedic
crime flicks theme, or if you really dig films with a lot of flashy style.
You'll probably hate it, if you think that many of the films that I named
above sucked. Note: There are almost no women in this entire movie.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Director Guy Ritchie started his career off as a TV commercial director.
"Hatchet" Harry's collector in this movie named Big Chris, is played by
actual "football" star Vinnie Jones. Noted as one of soccer's hard men, he
leapt to fame when a photographer at a match snapped him "marking" another
player by grabbing his testicles. His nickname is "Psycho".
Trudie Styler is one of the executive producers of this film. In real life,
she is married to singer/actor Sting, who happens to play the role of Eddy's
dad in this movie. Sting's real name is Gordon Matthew Sumner.
This film was nominated for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film
at the 1998 British Academy Awards, and won a best director award for Guy
Ritchie at the 1998 Tokyo International Film Festival.
Originally titled TWO SMOKING BARRELS.

Guy Ritchie's relentlessly funny and violent picture is one of the most
artistically original movies I've seen in months. The ingenious plot,
which centers around four friends who get mixed up in a series of
crimes, is flawlessly designed and brought together in the conclusion,
and Ritchie never misses the chance for a terrific shot. The movie does
fail to create real people, and there isn't a shred of humanity to be
found anywhere in the picture, but Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels
is still great fun.

REVIEW: Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels
By Luke Buckmaster (bucky@alphalink.com.au)
Cast: Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, Nick Moran, Jason Statham, Steven
Mackintosh, Vinne Jones, Sting, Lenny McLean, Steve Sweeney, Frank
Harper
Director: Guy Ritchie
Screenplay: Guy Ritchie
Australian theatrical release date: November 12, 1998
With Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, British writer/director Guy
Ritchie has given an original twist to what is probably this decades
most popular style of filmmaking.  You know the sort - blazing guns held
by people who mutter ordinary, day to day dialogue, and are corrupt and
shady characters brought to life more by their actions rather than their
words.  If Pulp Fiction wasn't smart enough for you, or Elmore Leonard
films (Jackie Brown, Out of Sight) appear too relaxed, this film will
appeal.  It tightly interlaces all plot elements smartly and
efficiently, whilst gushing out bittersweet black humor.
Almost immediately, Ritchie introduces a spectrum of villainous and
ultra stylish characters.  First is Eddy (Nick Moran), a scheming
charmer with a talent for cards.  He and three of his mates chip in
25,000 pounds each for Eddy to compete in a card game ran by the
notorious porn king, Hatchet Harry (P.H. Moriarty), in the hope that
their investment will pay dividends.  It doesn't.  Eddy and his gang -
which consists of Bacon (Jason Statham), Tom (Jason Flemyng) and Soap
(Dexter Fletcher) - end up not only losing their money but are left
owing half a million pounds.
Harry, with the aid of Barry the Baptist (Lenny McLean) and leather
jacketed debt collector Big Chris (Vinnie Jones), give them one week to
cough up the dough before they start losing their fingers.
Alternatively, Eddy's Dad JD (Sting) can cancel the debt by handing over
his bar - lock, stock and barrel - to Harry, an old adversary.
Without giving much away, let me just say that Eddy's plan to cover his
debt involves a factory full of weed, a dangerous drugs dealer with a
proud afro cut and two valuable antique shotguns.
What eventuates from all this fun and confusion is very, very clever.
Ritchie's screenplay introduces every character and every scenario for a
specific reason, which only becomes evident at the very end.  At no
point does he ever slow the pace; everything moves wickedly fast.
Ritchie's previous work as a director of music promos for bands and
commercials comes through vibrantly in this, his first feature film.  In
fact, many scenes look so stylish and are so carefully constructed that
it's easy to imagine that Ritchie has not drastically changed his
filming techniques.  Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels often feels like
a lengthy music video; the music in this case being the chemistry
between its wide breadth of characters.
Although of the same genre, when compared to Tarantino's Pulp Fiction or
Reservoir Dogs, the similarities to LS & TSB are somewhat limited.  For
starters, Ritchie replaces the well-known Tarantino style of dialogue
with something much snappier, but less relaxed.  The narrative rockets
from point a to point b, whereas many American filmmakers seem to love
confusing audiences until every piece of their story is eventually put
together.  Finally, the tension never breaks.  Ritchie doesn't stop to
carefully examine his characters, or to introduce any hint of a romance,
or even to take a breath and let the film's surroundings soak in.
That's the best and worst thing about LS & TSB: whilst it is great to
have a constantly high level of entertainment, I would have liked some
more character development.  I would have liked to understand and
sympathize with these immoral protagonists, if only to understand them
enough so I could laugh at them more.
Guy Ritchie deserves to be highly credited for a startling debut feature
film.  It's nice to know that some directors are bent on giving original
twists to genres, even if Ritchie's genre is already a new twist off the
Hollywood product line.  An original film, from one of this decade's
most original - and popular - genres.  It's tight, tense, funÂ…and that's
that - lock, stock, barrel.

The too clever yet too convoluted title is the first problem.  The
second problem is the first twenty or thirty minutes, as our cast of
characters is introducted, with each of the individual quirks and
defining characteristics actually told to us by a Cockney-accented
voice-over.  Yes, the film blithely violates the whole show-not-tell
rule.  No, they don't get away with it.  There's really only one main
character for whom they don't do the describe-explicitly thing with,
and his whole persona is spoiled by this godawful line about cats and
sour milk.  Dialog that goes clunk.
So, LSA2SB takes too long to get into the story, spending half an hour
on what should be obvious.  The story itself kicks off at a high stakes
card game, whick one of our young heroes loses badly.  The trick in
losing is that our hero borrowed heavily from one of the local crime
bosses to call, and Our Gang has to come up with half a million pounds
(800,000USD or 740,000EURO) by the end of the week.  The bulk of the
movie is about their plan to rob their neighbors, who, in turn, are
planning to rob this gang of potheads.  The plot becomes more intricate
-- and the movie gets its too cute name -- when the only firearms Our
Gang can get is a pair of antique shotguns.  Yes, it is a British film,
not an American one, or else Our Gang could just pop into the local
Wal-Mart for new hunting rifles.  Of course, the ease at which they can
heavily arm themselves would take away from the central premise of the
movie, that of a gang of amateur robbers going about their business
with pitiful equipment.
The plot, actually, does start moving about an hour into the movie, as
crossed wires, bad scheduling, and comic coincidences actually starts
driving the long-expected humor of the film.  It is a comedy, but it'd
be hard to tell until closer to the end than is good for it.  Even
then, it's not _that_ funny.  I will admit that some of the camera work
is very nice, with some well placed overcranking and undercranking, and
a freeze frame or two thrown in.  The high point of this sort of thing,
though, is probably the card game itself, and that's where the movie
gets underway; the cute tricks get used up relatively quickly.
I believe this movie has been touted as a British "Pulp Fiction", or
maybe some cross between Tarantino and the very energetic
"Trainspotting".  I suppose any recent movie featuring violent
gangsters with guns and droll humor gets compared to Tarantino, but
this just doesn't fly in this case.  LSA2SB shows little touch with the
characters beyond the ham-fisted voice overs, and the onscreen violence
lacks a certain flair, lacks a certain impact.
Oh, it is somewhat refreshing to see deflation finally starting to work
on the amounts of money being bandied around movies.  For years, we've
had Armed Robber A getting away with $20 million and Terrorist B
demanding $10 billion.  The height of silliness is probably in "Die
Hard 3", with the bad guys knocking over the Fed.  It's refreshing to
see sums of six figures, albeit in British Pounds.  I'm not going to
count Dr. Evil asking for one million dollars, though.
Lastly, Sting has a cameo, but I'm not a devout following of Sting, so
I'm not sure where he is.

     It's tough to knock a film as undeniably invigorating as LOCK, STOCK
AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS without coming off as an impossible-to-please
crank.  Yes, it's generally funny, clever and unpredictable; true, it's
plotted with a precision that should make aspiring screenwriters take
notes; indeed, it has visual style to spare.  Guy Ritchie's
caper/comedy/thriller has a savage entertainment value that's awfully hard
to find anymore.  It's also a film without an ounce of humanity, a
narrative machine where the fun feels hollow because the characters come
with names and virtually nothing more.
     That's a problem that really only nags in hindsight, since you'll
spend all your viewing time just trying to keep up.  The tale begins with
four London pals -- Eddy (Nick Moran), Tom (Jason Flemyng), Bacon (Jason
Statham) and Soap (Dexter Fletcher) -- who pool their small-time criminal
resources to come up with 100,000 pounds to get cardsharp Eddy into a high
stakes game.  Unfortunately, Eddy is victimized by some dirty dealing, and
ends up half a million pounds in debt to a sordid character named
"Hatchet" Harry Lonsdale (P. H. Moriarty).  Faced with only seven days to
avoid an unpleasant fate at the hands of Harry's henchman Barry the
Baptist (Lenny McLean), the quartet comes up with a desperate plan to get
the necessary money:  ripping off a van full of cash and marijuana from a
gang of thugs who just ripped it off from someone else.
     Believe it or not, that's the simple part of the multi-layered
plotting in LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS.  Also tied into the main
story:  the theft of two antique guns from an estate auction; a trio of
over-their-heads pot farmers; Jheri-Curled, sports fanatic crime boss Rory
(Vas Blackwood); and an enforcer-for-hire named Big Chris (Vinnie Jones)
who has a soft spot for his young son.  There are plenty of occasions
during the first half of the film when it feels over-populated,
over-plotted and over-directed, sending situations, vertiginous camera
angles and new faces at the audience in overwhelming waves.  Only
Ritchie's appealing wit might keep you from throwing up your hands and
throwing in the towel.
     Fortunately, the second and third acts offer so much propulsive
action that forgiveness for the early excesses becomes fairly easy.
Ritchie manages to pull all these threads together quite deftly, creating
a series of confrontations which continuously whip up new permutations of
violence, dark humor and surprise.  There are missteps here as well --
including a depiction of the protagonists' celebrating an apparent victory
which resembles a drinking binge by the Monkees -- but the caper itself is
engrossing enough to help hide them.   LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS
blindsides you with its sheer momentum, the pieces falling into place so
rapidly that you can't help but admire Ritchie's audacity.
     It's considerably harder to admire his thoroughgoing lack of interest
in his characters except as gun-toting props.  Every bit of color in the
film's performances comes from the use of physical types -- the bald,
imposing Barry; the short, high-strung Rory; strapping but soft-spoken Big
Chris.  Quentin Tarantino often is credited with inspiring a slew of
nihilistic comic-crime imitators, but Tarantino's way with actors and
redemption-hungry characters has always given him away as a closet 
humanist, and has always tempered his infamous violent streak.  Guy
Ritchie has a gift for adrenaline, to be sure, but he sends that
adrenaline through a body that has no heart.  You can't knock a director
in 1999 who at least makes you want to watch.  You just wish this rowdy
bit of entertainment made you want to care about something, anything,
besides how many bodies will pile up before the credits roll.

Out of England comes perhaps the most visually exciting and fresh film in
the Tarantino ouvre, except it is hardly a copycat.  Within it's two hours
come some of the most fresh characters, intriguing plot twists, and
mesmerizing photography.  The soundtrack's cool too.
If there are problems with the film, it's that the story can appear more
confusing than it has any right to be.  There are no less than twenty
significant characters in the film, and them cockney accents don't help. Any
detailed synopsis of the story will help.  And I'm tempted to not give it,
to have the viewer discover it for themselves.  But give it I shall,
dummied-down:
There are five groups of individuals, plus two knuckleheads and Sting.
Group A consists of  four friends who pool their money into a high stakes
poker game.  They lose.  They owe a heck-of-a-lot-of-money to Group B.
(Group B consists of a local porn king, and two enforcers who collect the
money or else).  Group A, fearing for their lives, accidentally overhear of
a plan from Group C (robbers) to steal from Group D (marijuana growers).
They conspire to surprise Group C after the holdup, take the money, and
repay group B.  They succeed. Group E, (Rastafarian dudes whom Group D rely
on for protection) wants revenge.  
Now: add a significant subplot involving the two knuckleheads hired to steal
two priceless antique guns, and you have the film.  It is a given that at
one point, it appears that these two smoking barrels will pass hands to
nearly every character.
What _Lock Stock_ loses in the American translation, it more than gains in
visual style, witty characterizations, great dialogue, unique camera setups,
and all-around coolness.  I was fortunate to catch this without seeing any
commercial for it, and didn't expect the camera to fill me with exhilaration
the way it did.  Every move is carefully mapped, carefully thought out, for
maximum viewing enjoyment. 
So many memorable scenes!  When the boys first walk into a specialty bar,
only to be greeted by a man set on fire.  The dazed camerawork in the poker
sequence.  The drugged out girl.  And my favorite: the face-off between an
uzi and a b-b gun (guess which holds its own for a while).  
A lot of films have been compared to _Pulp Fiction_ throughout the years,
but this is the only film that truly deserves the compliment.  And it
deservedly won the British Oscar for Best Picture last year.  
One more thing: the very final scene will stick to your head like no other
recent film.  Genius.

PLease post the following review to the newsgroup
rated R
starring Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, Nick Moran, Jason Statham, Steven
Mackintosh, Vinnie Jones, Sting
written and directed by Guy Ritchie
Guy Ritchie's new British import LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS
is a film that can be either loved, loathed or both. LOCK, STOCK tells
the story of 4 criminals who pool their money into a rigged game of
poker. They even lose some money that was lent to them by local "porn
king" "Hatchet" Harry (P.H.  Moriarty). He gives them a week to
retrieve the money. From that point on, the film goes wild, twisting
plot points around your head quicker than you can say "What's going
on?"  LOCK, STOCK would be confusing as an American film, but it is
British, which makes it all the more confusing because of the
unidentifiable slang and accents. Throughout the film, I could not
distinguish one character from the other. In my opinion, LOCK, STOCK
needs maybe 3 viewings to be fully enjoyed. One to recognize Guy
Ritchie's direction, which is at once derivative and dazzling. Two to
in some way digest some of the dialogue being spoken. And three in
order to try to understand each plot point. But sadly, most people,
like me, would rather just see a film once.
Despite its shortcomings, LOCK, STOCK is a fun-filled caper, and it
has more energy and hipness than most of our violence-laden action
pictures. LOCK, STOCK was supposedly a huge hit in England, and it's
not hard to see why. I only wish that the filmmakers and taken the
approach that Artisan Films did to MY NAME IS JOE by subtitling the
English-language film. Another one of the film's flaws is its
excessive use of drum & bass music between scenes. At the beginning of
the movie it was hip, but towards the end it becomes repetitive. There
is really no message in LOCK, STOCK, and it never comes close to
reaching the poetic display of RESERVOIR DOGS, but if you're looking
to spend a free afternoon at the movies, this should provide some
entertainment as long as you bring a dictionary. (Oh yeah, I forgot to
mention that Sting has a small role)

LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth
        It features a ne'er-do-well quartet of underachievers with names
like Soap and Bacon.  It's got a narrated, freeze-frame opening sequence in
which two tossers bolt from the fuzz to a pulsating rock soundtrack.  It's
got heavily-accented dialogue that could benefit from subtitles, lots of
ultraviolence, and a big bag of dosh.
        It's not "Trainspotting," the trans-Atlantic junkie hit that saw
Ewan McGregor (soon to be seen as the young Obi-Wan in the eagerly-awaited
"Star Wars" prequel) shooting heroin like there was no tomorrow.
        It's "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels," the latest anarchistic
exercise to bear the slogan "the film that took England by storm."
        Like Danny Boyle's "Trainspotting," Guy Ritchie's film finds
strength in its cast of virtual unknowns, SAG-speaking that is.  One face
will be familiar to a particular British audience, but seen spattered with
mud and blood on the small screen, not the big one.
        First, former Manchester United striker Eric Cantona had an
unexpected turn as a French ambassador in the acclaimed costume drama,
"Elizabeth."  Now, not to be outdone by his former English league rival,
Wimbledon midfielder Vinnie Jones has a sizable and affecting role in
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels."
        Whereas M. Cantona was simply adequate as an historical dignitary,
Jones' performance is surprisingly on the ball.  Not just when he exhibits
the kind of prowess he showed on the football field--a headbutt here, a
kick to the groin there, a fist to the face elsewhere--but also when he
portrays his character's odd sense of propriety and placidly threatening
demeanor.  Jones, appropriately attired, jeweled, and coifed, plays Big
Chris, debt collector to a seedy porn king with the catchy moniker of
Hatchet Harry.
        Harry likes to play cards, and it's one of his high stakes poker
games that first introduces us to our hapless heroes: Eddie, Tom, Bacon,
and Soap.
        Eddie is the brains of the bunch (and that's not saying much) who's
known how to handle cards ever since he could handle cards.  As the film
opens, Eddie and his friends are scurrying to find the considerable funds
necessary to enter Harry's card game.  Cash in hand, Eddie enters the fray
and eventually finds himself on the losing end of a pair of sevens
(depressingly realistic hands for a change).  Now the guys have a little
problem: one week to come up with half a million pounds to pay off the
hatchet man.
        The clever and complicated plot twists and turns and finally comes
full circle.  Whereas the script is smart, our protagonists are not, and
vast amounts of money change hands as often as the pair of antique firearms
referred to in the title.
        Writer/director Ritchie shoots all this with the grainy,
sepia-toned imagery of an old-fashioned western.  Whether it's an homage to
that genre or an unabashed rip-off of "Trainspotting," one thing is clear:
it's bloody funny.  Better make that bloody *and* funny, since "Lock, Stock
and Two Smoking Barrels" spares very little in either department.

Susan Granger's review of "LOCK, STOCK, AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS"
       Talk about hype! If you read the newspaper ads, this looks like
an irresistible crime caper. Don't believe it - unless you're willing
and able to decipher rhythmic Cockney slang, familiar only in London's
East End. In fact, the garbled dialogue is so unintelligible that, in
several scenes, there are even subtitles! The action-packed, Quentin
Tarantino-like plot revolves around underworld ineptitude. Nick Moran
plays a cocky card-shark who loses 500,000 pounds ($800,000) to a
gambler in a rigged card game. He's told to pay up within a week or he
and his hapless pals (Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, and Jason
Statham) will get their bodily parts chopped off in increments,
starting with the fingers. There is an alternative: he could get his
father, played by Sting, to turn over his popular bar to the
gambler. Since neither solution is appealing, Moran and his friends
decide to rip off a neighborhood marijuana factory. There's lots of
shooting, several battling gangs, Damon Runyon'ish characters (Hatchet
Harry, Barry the Baptist, Big Chris) and even a few laughs in the
midst of the crazy get-rich-quick schemes. One of the ploys involves
stealing two valuable antique muskets - the titular smoking barrels.
But, all in all, it's quite violent, repeatedly profane, and the
characters are remarkably unpleasant to watch. Obviously, first-time
writer/director Guy Ritchie has a talent for style and, given a more
coherent story, he'll do good films in the future. But the virtues of
this film lie in the rapid pace, MTV-like camera angles and quick
cuts. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Lock, Stock, and Two
Smoking Barrels" is an edgy, fumbling 4, filled with double-crosses,
chaos and corpses.

What are four blokes to do when the high stakes poker game, for which
they saved their money so diligently, turns out to be rigged?  In
British writer and director Guy Ritchie's LOCK, STOCK & TWO SMOKING
BARRELS, they embark on what turns out to be an intricate escapade of
crooks stealing from other crooks.
After the game leaves the four men, played by Jason Flemyng, Dexter
Fletcher, Nick Moran and Jason Statham, in the hole, they try hard to
devise cons that will pay off their debts, but the only scheme quick
enough to repay them in time is to rob some other criminals who live
next door.
This sporadically funny movie's limitations start with the casting and
the costuming.  There are over a dozen characters in this
shoot-and-steal tale, but they can be easily collected into three
groups.  There are the tall, thin, young white guys, the beefy,
middle-aged, white guys, and the mustached, young black guys.  The
script doesn't do much to differentiate the characters within the three
groups.  Within each group, they look, dress and act remarkably alike,
adding to the confusion.
The storyline bounces around like a leaf in the wind.  Although there
are several funny episodes, the picture as a whole never quite gels.
If the dialog, mumbled with thick accents, has trouble carrying the
movie, the atmospherics are dead-on.  Filmed by Tim Maurice-Jones with a
gritty, dimly lit, sepia-toned look, the movie employs a wide variety of
techniques from still pictures to slow motion to fast action.  Iain
Andrews's sets are full of convincingly low-rent buildings.  One of the
main characters, "Hatchet" Harry Lonsdale (P.H. Moriarty), is a
self-proclaimed "Porn King," who runs a sleazy joint that sells sex toys
from an authentic looking establishment.
The film has several nice small touches.  The eclectic firearms that the
criminals use range from an ineffective airgun to fancy, antique
double-barrel shotguns to an ancient machine gun that looks like it
hasn't been fired since D-day.  There is also one scene with English
subtitles to translate the slang, e.g., "bird's nest" means "chest."
This is the sort of movie in which a stranger in flames comes running
out of a bar.  He is never seen again, and why he was torched is never
quite explained.  In another scene the guys go into a pub that turns out
to be a Samoan pub that serves strange-colored cocktails large enough to
"hide an orangutan."  To the director's credit, he has the good sense to
take a serious approach to his bizarre little, dark comedy.
Scored to loud electric guitar music, the movie is as confidently
presented as it is confusing.  Subplots abound, and since the actors
look so much alike, it is frequently unclear whose side each is on.
Although it ends in a Quentin Tarantino-style hail of violence, the
movie has firmly established British roots.  During a big heist, one of
the robbers stops to fix himself an invigorating cup of tea.
LOCK, STOCK & TWO SMOKING BARRELS runs 1:46.  It is rated R for strong
violence, pervasive profanity, sexuality and drug content and would be
acceptable for older teenagers.

No heroes and no story are the main attributes for this futile attempt
at a Trainspotting, Performance, The long Good Friday, and a
Tarantino-like gangster/comedy, all rolled into one film, served up with
an Eastender's sense of vile English humor, as this is writer/director
Guy Ritchie's first feature film, formerly known for his video
commercials. He tries every bit he could muster from the lore of
gangster and screwball comedies, to make this film work, but still
misses by a city mile.This is just a bad film. A Laurel and Hardy film
would have looked like deep sardonic humor compared with this sophomoric
effort.
Every character in the film tries to be a character, succeeding only in
being a one-dimensional one, while women do not play a significant part
in this unoriginal film, as they are reduced to being go-go girls or
unnoticeable druggies.
Ritchie's aim for the film, is to keep the audience guessing at what is
happening.
It all starts when four lame-brained Eastenders (Tom (Jason Flemying),
Bacon (Jason Statham), Eddy (Nick) and Soap (Dexter Fletcher)) pool
their life savings together to put one of them, Eddy, into a card game
with a notorious crime boss and porn king and antique gun collector by
nefarious means, Hatchet Harry (P.H.). Eddy who never loses an honest
game, loses this crooked game, and has a week to pay off the half a
million pounds debt or else his fingers and his friends' fingers will be
taken off by Harry's thug, one day-at-a time. The thug is a Lionel
Stander clone, but not even close to him in getting laughs, Barry the
Baptist (Lenny). Lenny McLean was a former bare knuckle champion, who
died shortly after the film was released.
Then the film gets slapstick happy and four gangs are going after a
bundle of money, ripped-off a non-violent drug dealer and marijuana
grower (Steven Mackintosh), who works for a Samoan crime boss, who looks
like Little Richard, (Vas), as mix-ups, treachery, confusion and
attitude become the thing, but with no group holding our attention for
long, as the pace quickens, and each group goes for their little bit of
violence and comedy, and we never stay focused on any one group, which
was a major blunder in artistic direction; after all, this is supposed
to be a movie, not a video commercial.
The gang ripping-off the drug dealer is led by a vicious thug, Dog
(Harper), who is the neighbor of the four boys, as they overhear him
planning the drug robbery, and they plan to rob him after he robs the
drug dealer, which is the way they see themselves getting out of the jam
they are in.
The film gets carried away with trying to be too clever, as one
character is always trying to top the other in craziness.
Some of the many characters in the film who caught my eye were: Chris
(Vinny Jones, who is the English bad-boy of soccer), who plays his hit
man part with a killer's deadpan face, as he works with his equally
business-like young son, (Peter McNicholl), as they both work for Harry.
Thrown into the picture are a couple of inept burglars, a greedy middle
man named Nick the Greek, a constantly stoned girl, a befuddled traffic
cop, and Sting, as a bar owner and disapproving father of Eddy. As
Eddy's dad, he can cancel the debt by handing over his bar, lock, stock
and barrel to his old adversary, Harry, but chooses not to.
The plot has its twists and turns, and it would serve no purpose telling
you about it, since the heart of the film, is about the surprises and
corpses it delivers. Since the film's humor didn't suit me and I grew
tired of seeing so many characters try to fit into such a small movie,
with all of them being a composite of a boring and motley crew of
stereotypes; and, the violence didn't particularly appeal to me, either,
leaving me squirming in my seat with displeasure.
If you take my advise, you'd avoid this one. I think you would get more
satisfaction, if you are hooked on this type of film, in seeing
something like Reservoir Dogs, even if you must see it again, it is
better than seeing this poor imitation once.

   Some British papers have hailed "Lock, Stock and Barrel"
as the film of the week, with some Brits hoping that it will play
out in the U.S. like the major sleeper "The Full Monty." 
Unfortunately it is yet a copycat sample of its genre--one that
mines the well-worn territory of comical criminals and glorified
gangsters.  It's a first-feature by its writer-director, Guy
Ritchie, its style cloned largely from black-humor hoodlum
genre works like "Reservoir Dogs" and "Pulp Fiction."  A
moviegoing British public would probably identify it closely
with the 1970 film "Get Carter" starring Michael Caine in the
role of a small-time gangster investigating his brother' death,
a work by Mike Hodges that captures the seediness of the
petty rackets in England.  
   Like Quentin Tarantino's 1994 masterwork "Pulp Fiction,"
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" is an audacious,
outrageous look at honor among lowlifes told in a style that
links seemingly separate stories, but though director Guy
Ritchie hired a cluster of non-actors--including a couple of
real tough ex-cons and a major British soccer player for a
look of authenticity, none of the actors maintains the sheer
magnetism of the likes of Samuel L. Jackson and John
Travolta.  Ritchie's film, like Tarantino's, is not for the
squeamish: although its director states in the production
notes that he abhors graphic violence and cuts away when
the action gets vicious, the movie is laced with quite a few
samples of the gory butchery albeit without the ketchup. 
Examples: one low-life holds the son of another gangster
hostage in a car while the daddy drives toward their
destination.  When daddy gets the jump on the hostage taker,
he dangles the latter's head just outside the car door and
proceeds to close the door on the man's crown swiftly,
viciously, and with intent to grind it to a pulp.  In yet another
vista, a hoodlum is felled by an axe thrown into his back but
before checking out he manages to shoot the perp and the
perp's boss in the gut.  
   Although the plot can be plenty confusing, it avoids
Tarantino's signature style by moving steadily, if at blazing
speed, from one incident to another rather than narrate
separate vignettes that come together only toward the
conclusion.  The picture's center is Eddie (Nick Moran), a
attractive gang member whose company of pals raise the
requisite 100 British pounds to enter a high-stakes card game
at the porn palace of crime boss "Hatchet" Harry (P.H.
Moriarty).  Though Eddie, a noted card sharp, wins hand after
hand, he is conned into taking a loan of 500,000 pounds from
Harry for one big pot, not knowing that the game is rigged. 
When Eddie loses the hand he is warned by Harry's right-
hand man, Barry the Baptist (Lenny McLean), that Eddie and
his three friends would have a week to come up with the
money or lose one finger each for every day they are in
arrears--and that's for starters.  Eddie and company must
think fast: how to raise such a grand sum in such a short
time?  The obvious answer: steal it from other criminals.
   With razzle-dazzle cinematography--including freeze-
frames, slo-mo and fast-mo action, and upside-down images-
-the sepia-toned print takes Eddie into the activities of
criminal organizations, each specializing in a well-known
aspect of drug-related or violent crime.  We're introduced to
marijuana growers and dealers, some Samoan drug lords
(including one with an Afro in a role that an American director
would have given to Sam Jackson), and a couple of buffoons
who are sent out on a mission to steal valuable antique guns.
   Neither plot nor characterization appears to be the selling
point of director Ritchie, who is eager to portray the milieu of
London's East End during his 36-day shoot, caricaturing the
neighborhood's bad-guy ambiance with Tim Maurice-Jones's
helter-skelter photography.  In one imaginative scene that
goes by so fast that you'd do well not to blink, he flashes
some dialogue made up almost entirely of Cockney
colloquialisms with subtitles for the any overeducated people
in the audience who are not hip to street slang.  Not
surprisingly the most convincing performers in the tale grew
up in London's East End and are quite knowledgeable about
the ways of the pub-crawlers and swindlers who make their
home there.  One such fellow, a guy with tough past who
turns in one of the sharpest roles, is the late Lenny McLean
as Barry the Baptist--known as Britain's most successful
bare-knuckle fighter--who claimed to have been shot twice,
stabbed, and a participant in countless barroom brawls.  
   "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" would be a
prominent piece of low-budget filmmaking if had appeared a
decade or so ago, but by now the genre is so tired, the
glorification of violent criminals so prosaic, that it rates simply
as an also-ran.  The characters sometimes blend together
like the soldiers in Terrence Malick's "Thin Red Line," in a
movie which, however amusing, is just repackaged fare.

_Lock,_Stock_and_Two_Smoking_Barrels_ (R) *** (out of ****)
Take a dash of _Trainspotting_'s scuzziness and generous helpings of the
oeuvre of Tarantino, and you've got an extremely derivative film.   But
if the film is as entertaining as first-time writer-director Guy
Ritchie's fresh and fun _Lock,_Stock..._--a smash in its native Great
Britain--the lack of originality hardly matters.
Ritchie takes his time setting up the players in this story about a
foursome of inept small-time hoods (Nick Moran, Jason Flemyng, Jason
Statham, and Dexter Fletcher) who stage a heist to pay off a gambling
debt owed to a crime boss (P.H. Moriarty).  The fact that these players
are lacking any real depth or substance is actually of little
consequence, for Ritchie drops them in a clever, complex, and comic caper
that takes its share of unexpected twists and turns.  It may not a
perfect debut for Ritchie, but the visual flair and ingenious plotting he
displays with _Lock,_Stock..._ leaves one optimistic about his future
efforts.

When I first saw the poster for this film, I thought "it's a spoof on
'Reservoir Dogs'." I wasn't too far off, it certainly shares that Tarantino
genre. Though, it's not a spoof -- unless you think "Reservoir Dogs" is a
spoof on "bad guy" films.
I suspect you'll enjoy this picture if you're a fan of Quentin Tarantino, or
even harsh action films like "Ronin." If you're not familiar with Tarantino,
this is what you can expect: An ugly real violence contrasted with gangster
goof-ups. Rat packs of hoodlum and hoodlum wannabes that fumble through a
gritty underworld maze surprising each other at the turns and exhausting
many a cartridge of bullets. Lots of dead guys.
This is a British film with four teams of shady characters, a thug and his
son, and Sting (as the involuntarily involved bartender). That's a lot of
bad guys, so it takes a while to introduce them all, making the first part
of the film rather uneventful and dry. The ball gets rolling near the middle
of the picture and picks up speed at a steadily increasing rate right up to
the credits. The twists and turns are well set up, yet unexpected and fun --
really fun.
Lastly, the picture sports some unique cinematographic sequences (utilizing,
super-slow-mo, stop-action, etc.) spicing up the presentation and
maintaining a light-hearted perspective despite the blood.
Starring Jason Flemying and Nick Moran.
Written and directed by Guy Ritchie.
Produced by Matthew Vaughn via Polygram released at Gramercy.

     LOCK, STOCK, AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS is the kind of farce we have
seen before. It is a comedy of chaos.  This sort of comedy puts enough
groups of people together in a script, none knowing what the others are
doing and (perhaps) the audience can follow what is going on, but you
can reasonably expect that none of the characters has a clue.
Particularly good comedies in this vein are Martin Scorsese's AFTER
HOURS and John Landis's OSCAR.
     The plot of LOCK, STOCK, AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS works like a
well-oiled machine set on high-speed, with everybody doing things to
everybody else and nobody being sure who is doing what to whom. It
seemed like a good idea at the time. Four young London low-lifes figure
they have a good shot at getting rich if they can get into a high
stakes poker game.  They get together 100,000 pounds.  What they did
not count on was that the game was rigged and that they would end up
owing 500,000 pounds.  And they have one week to get it.  Luckily a
possibility presents itself.  Their next-door neighbors are planning to
rob an urban marijuana farmer.  Our group plans to steal the proceeds
of that crime.  But that is not all that is happening.  All told there
are about six different groups of people, all criminal in some ways,
running around bumping into each other, double-crossing each other, and
shooting each other up.
     Everybody is doing something illegal in this part of London; it
goes with the turf.  Set in a part of London where the law is something
of an irrelevancy, this frantic farce is the first outing for 30-year-
old writer and director Guy Ritchie.  Everyone here is a criminal, but
at least he is an eloquent one.  As has been the style for crime films
since PULP FICTION, the dialog leans to the clever and inventive side
and away, far away, from realism.  Everybody knows that few real thugs,
and certainly not the ones this far down the ladder, are as eloquent
and as engaging to hear as the ones in this film.  If they were this
bright, they would be in a less hazardous profession.  But then the
filmmaker's first responsibility is to entertain.  Some Americans will
have problems penetrating the thick accents that unfortunately obscure
some of the funniest lines.
     Most of the actors have good credentials in British films, though
they may be less familiar in this country.  One exception is a small
part for Sting. Supplementing the cast are some particularly ugly
actors, apparently by the credits supplied by a special agency
dedicated to providing ugly actors.
     The film has considerably more violence than an Alec Guinness
English crime comedy would have and some of it may cut against the
humor, but Guy Ritchie is a promising director.  Rate this a 6 on the0
to 10 scale and a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.

Here's a big shock, for ya: there's actually a film that has to do with
crime, uses the now-dying Tarantino brand of love for crime and
criminals as a backboard, and is filled to the brim with immense amounts
of style over a minute amount of substance that, *shock*, actually
works.  I'm not so sure I believe it myself, but 'Lock, Stock, and Two
Smoking Bullets,' the new film from newcomer Guy Ritchie, is probably
the first straight-up crime flick since 'Pulp Fiction' to actually
breathe life into the overused genre.  Ever since 'Pulp Fiction' came
out, the necessity of others to make films just like it has plagued us
and only recently begun to seriously decline, not just because the
Tarantino style has gone out of style, but also because no one could
ever actually capture that feeling that 'Pulp' introduced.  What makes
'Lock, Stock...' work is that while it's obviously inspired by
Tarantino, it's also been inspired by the great British crime flick,
'The Long Good Friday,' and the hybrid of the two, I suppose, has bred
this: a film that is jam-packed (and I mean jam-packed) with interesting
characters who are all, in some way, related to crime; features a
plethora of nasty violence (shootings, stabbings, beatings, burnings,
even a hatchet in the back or two); possesses a complex amount of plots
and subplots; and has a streak of humor that is not necessarily black or
quirky as much as it is traditionally 'British.'
In fact with all of that compressed into about 105 minutes of film, it's
actually a bit tough to follow.  But the main plot is this: a foursome
of young London Eastenders, who hardly need the money, enter their
unofficial leader (Nick Moran), who's ace at cardplaying (he can sense
emotions easily), into a high-stakes poker game with a local mob boss,
named Hatchet Harry (P.H. Moriarty, incidentally from 'The Long Good
Friday').  Turns out, duh, that Harry cheats with the help of his
enormously menacing assistant, Barry the Baptist (the late Lenny McLean,
once a real-life bouncer and ruffian), and once they lose, Barry informs
them that they have only three days to get what they owe in to him.
Meanwhile, another gang, who lives next door to them, are devising a
scheme to rob a local pot dealer (Steven Mackintosh) of his cash on the
day it's being transferred to another local mob boss, Jamaican Rory
Breaker (Vas Blackwood).  Thus the main gang decides to rob that gang.
Also meanwhile, in another part of town, two inept crooks are hired by
Barry to steel some very expensive antique rifles from a mansion, and,
believe it or not, they become involved slightly in everything that goes
on.
I'll refrain from revealing any more, as part of the fun is just trying
to keep up with the plotty plot, while another part of the fun is trying
to keep track of who's who.  This film must feature about 25 main
characters, some who actually look alike, but all of whom have catchy,
quirky names, like Nick the Greek, that are instantly reminiscent of the
heydays of Tarantino (oh those were the days).  And, surprise, much of
this film rides high on the enormous amount of style that comes along
with it.  Guy Ritchie has pretty much officially overdirected this film,
employing slowing down a shot then speeding it up frantically, freezing
frames and spinning around a subject, using bizarro angles and lenses to
distort the picture, the occasional use of narration to sum things up
(this was my favorite effect, I must add), witty direction (when you see
a guy throwing carrots into a pot from the POV of the pot, you really
should have no doubt Ritchie worked in commercials) and usage of about
35 years of music in designing the soundtrack, which features everything
from new stuff to James Brown and Dusty Springfield.  To tell you the
truth, it looks a lot like a Gap commercial.
And, predictably enough, throughout much of this film, with all the
style and glitz that accompanies it, we don't really care what happens
to anyone.  There's no real characterization here, and it would almost
seem like if the film had decided to concentrate on another group of
characters in this film and not our lead foursome, there'd really not be
much of a difference.  And as much as this sounds like a criticism, it's
not.  I enjoyed this film.  There's no real big reason why: it's just
bloody entertaining stuff.  I liked the use of style way over substance
(particularly the poker scene, which is phenomenal to look at), and I
liked how the film took an objective look at all the characters and
never actually deepened them (in a film like this, depth of anything
would be distracting beyond recognition).  Hell, I even liked the fact
that this film actually coasted on style for most of it.  I suppose if I
had to actually come up with a concrete reason why I actually think any
of this is worth a teensy bit of merit is: it has energy.  This movie's
alive.  Movies aren't much alive these days, but this film is so
energetic and filled with zeal that you can almost sense that making
this film must have been the most fun thing in the cast and crews'
lives.  And this is conveyed to the audience in the way that it's been
designed, through the humor and the unserious tone, which could
otherwise be interpreted as posing.
But even if this stuff is not your average cup of tea, the final act is
so brutally wicked and devilish that it's as if the first two acts, the
exposition and the chief robberies, were only leading up to the
hilarious way in which the film ties up all its loose ends.  At least
three quarters of the cast of characters get done away with, and by the
end, everything (or at least almost everything) has been dealt with in
such a satisfying and Machiavellian manner that it'd be tough not to
leave the theater with a big stupid grin on your face, giggling about
what you just saw.  But even so, throughout there's such a good amount
of humor that watching it is breathlessly entertaining (all clichÃ©s
aside, British humor really is pretty much the best kind, at least I
think so), from the little one-liners (quoting Winston Churchill on the
subject of gold whilst torturing a victim) to the small idiosyncrasies
(one crook's fascination with his poofy hair) to the hysterical bits of
casting (most hysterical: Sting, yes Sting, as Moran's bartender father
- the camera seems to linger over him whenever he shows up, as if
someone offscreen is about to shout out 'Hey!  Isn't that recording
artist Sting?!?!?!').  Even the acting is spotlessly superb, with
our four leads being instantly likable (esp. Moran), and the biggest
accolades going to McLean and professional soccer player/hooligan Vinnie
Jones as soft-spoken yet still enforceful collector Big Chris (with his
dry little son, Little Chris).
Basically, this is the most furiously entertaining movie I've seen so
far this year (big challenge)...yet, that may actually be a part of its
partial undoing.  It's so furious and so busy trying to always be
unpredictable and wild that I wonder if this film actually holds up over
repeated viewings.  Maybe this film will be one of those films where the
initial viewing is always the best, while others slowly degrade in
quality.  Yet, there's still that initial viewing, which was so
demanding of attention, so witty, and so entertaining that it's hardly a
shock that it's not completely satisfying.  You're more or less bound to
have a blast watching it, that is, if you don't take any of it seriously
(this includes the style which, once upon a time, may have been
considered, *ahem*, 'Brilliant').  Even then, though, even not taking it
the least big seriously, I couldn't help but describe this film to a
friend in one damning word: 'cute.'  Fun flick; doubt I'd think so after
three viewings.  Yet, strangely enough, I can't wait to see it again.

PLANET SICK-BOY:  http://www.sick-boy.com
Imagine that you talk your three best friends into giving you their life
savings for you to wager in a can't-miss high-stakes poker game.
Imagine that, despite your remarkable card-playing skills, you somehow
lose everything and even end up in debt to a fellow named `Hatchet'
Harry, a local crime boss and porn king that once beat a man to death
with a gigantic black rubber marital aid.  Imagine Harry tells you that
if you don't cough up his cash within a week, he'll send his henchman,
Barry the Baptist, to start chopping off the digits of you and your
friends.
That's the basic plot of Guy Ritchie's exhilarating big-screen debut,
which was a critical and box office hit in England and the darling of
this year's Sundance Film Festival.  Ritchie's inspired directing
technique, especially during the aforementioned card game (where it
almost feels like you were actually punched in the stomach), is actually
one-upped by his splendid script, which also includes a drug kingpin, a
group of degenerates led by a guy named `Dog,' a stoned group of pot
growers, two idiot hitmen, a father-and-son debt-collecting team, a pair
of antique shotguns and a bartender played by Sting.
Sound confusing?  It is for a while, but Ritchie ties everything up so
deliciously in the last ten minutes that you can't help grin as the cast
is hilariously thinned out by a series of misunderstandings and bad
timing.  What starts out as a hodgepodge of Pulp Fiction, Trainspotting
and Reservoir Dogs slowly becomes as enjoyable and visually stylish as
the films from which Lock, Stock draws its comparisons.  For fans from
across the pond, look for notorious soccer bad-boy Vinnie Jones as the
debt-collector Big Chris and the late bare-knuckle fighting champ P.H.
Moriarty as Barry the Baptist, a man who earned his name for his
drowning interrogation style.  The film also has a great soundtrack
featuring The Stooges, The Stone Roses and James Brown.  Produced by
Trudie Styler (aka Mrs. Sting).  (R Â– 1:05 extreme violence, adult
language and brief nudity)
JON'S INTERVIEW WITH LOCK, STOCK STAR VINNIE JONES
That was the final line delivered by Big Chris, a vicious debt collector
in the new, highly stylish British import Lock, Stock and Two Smoking
Barrels.  The funny thing is that he utters it with as much vigor and
emotion as a Stallone or a Van Damme.
But the actor playing Big Chris isn't a `big' action hero Â– he's Vinnie
Jones, a major star in English soccer making his film debut in Lock,
Stock.  Describing his thuggish role, Jones says, `He's very tough and
he's got a lot of respect on the street.'  Jones adds `He takes his boy
with him, Little Chris, and he's teaching him the ropes, but he's also
trying to teach him manners.'
The scenes featuring Big and Little Chris are some of the most
entertaining in the film.  And the irony isn't lost on Jones, who has
been known to strike fear into the hearts of opponents on the soccer
pitch.  `When I'm on the football field, I've got like a Jekyl and Hyde
character; I know that,' Jones continues, `But I'm just going out there
and I want to win, and sometimes that gets you into a lot of trouble.'
Trouble, indeed Â– Jones has been ejected from ten matches in his career,
but that kind of passion might be what caught the eyes of casting
directors.  The 33-year-old Welsh star might sound like somewhat of a
British Dennis Rodman Â– he made a few cameo appearances on British TV
and even hosted his own award-winning television talk show.  `It was a
lads' show really,' Jones notes, `It was based in a pub and we had a
live audience sort of thing.  I'd invite guests into the pub, three or
four at a time, to talk about football and women and magazines.'
And that's not the only acting experience on Jones' resume Â– he also
grappled with Stone Cold Steve Austin when the World Wrestling
Federation made a stop in London last December.  `I got in and knocked
him out and I had a couple of fights with The Bossman,' beams Jones,
also noting that there isn't much difference between acting in the WWF
and acting in feature film.
`My energy is going to be toward movies now,' Jones remarks, `If I get a
big enough part, I shall just hang the ol' boots up, I think.'  He has
played for such prestigious English clubs as Chelsea, Leeds, Sheffield
United and Wimbledon, the team he first signed with in 1986, giving up
his less glamorous job as a brick carrier.  He hasn't played since
November, when he was passed over for a coaching job at his last club,
Queens Park.  `I think the football part of my life is drawn to an end
and this (film) is another challenge I want to get on with.'
Jones couldn't have picked a better film for his debut; Lock, Stock was
a monster hit in England, earning the princely sum of $19.3 million on a
paltry $1.6 million budget.  Describing the reactions at screenings
during the Sundance Film Festival, Jones says the audience reaction `was
brilliant Â– it's been getting standing ovations.'  The film, best
described as a cross between Reservoir Dogs and Trainspotting, was the
only film that generated widespread excitement at Sundance.
Up next for Jones is writer/director Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock
follow-up, The Diamonds.  But the London Sunday Times reports that Jones
is in negotiations to play a British spy in the upcoming Tom Cruise
vehicle, Mission Impossible II.  `I haven't received any phone calls
about it, but you never know,' muses Jones. `I'm just an apprentice in
this business at the moment.  I just don't know how things work or
anything like that.  It's flattering to be even mentioned in that
context.'  Ironically, the same newspaper also reported that Cruise
plans to shoot an American version of Lock, Stock.
After The Diamonds, Jones says, `I don't really have any plans.  I'm
just going to see how this movie goes out here and see if we get any
offers of any other bigger movies.'  He reflects on his career by
stating, `It's fantastic.  I suppose it's any lad's dream to be a big
football player and then try the chance of being in movies.  I've done
this very much for a challenge, just for a change of direction and it's
all snowballed.'
We should all be so lucky in our careers.

LOCK, STOCK, AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS has been described as the British
PULP FICTION, and on the surface, that would seem like an accurate
depiction.  It's got the usual cross-section of characters with witty
tongues involved in varied illegal activities, that get themselves into
very peculiar situations in which no one really survives unscathed. 
Nonetheless, the film seems to be missing something that characterized
its predecessor.  And right now, you're getting the feeling that I'm
about to quickly file LOCK, STOCK as another Tarantino homage/copy-cat
crime, but that's not quite it either.
LOCK, STOCK is in fact, probably the best film since PULP FICTION in
which there are no really good guys.  Like PULP FICTION, LOCK, STOCK
begins with what would seem to be a simple story, that quickly careens
out of control.  In this case, four buddies; Tom, Eddie, Bacon, and
Soap, pool their money together to back can't lose Eddie at an
unbeknownst-to-them rigged game of cards.  Of course they get fleeced,
and end up in heavy debt to the local heavy.  What follows is a madcap
plan to recoup the money by intercepting a heist Eddie has fortuitously
discovered his neighbor is carrying out.  The interrelation of the
problems with the original heist, along with the interception of it by
Eddie's gang, and a couple of other local illegal activities result in a
frantic circle of destruction.
Though the web of illegal activity is obviously reminiscent of PULP
FICTION, where LOCK, STOCK most significantly strays from its de facto
blue print is in theme.  In Tarantino's masterpiece, the theme was
essentially that there was no theme, no morality.  In the gritty
underworld, outcome is random.  While Samuel L. Jackson is divinely
saved and given a second chance to "walk the earth like Kane in Kung
Fu," his partner in the guise of John Travolta is sentenced to death on
a toilet.  In this incarnation, the badder they are, the worse their
fate seems to be, which often is death.
The real question now, is why have I rambled on without making much
comment on the quality of the movie.  The answer of course, is that I
don't have much to say.  LOCK, STOCK is end the end one of those films
that pretty much leaves you when you leave it.  You can talk about the
witty plot, and the funny lines, but in the end, I guess a movie with o
one to really root for (I guess we do root for our four pals a little)
leaves you in the end without too much invested.  So we leave it like we
left PULP FICTION before it, by walking out of the theater and saying,
"Wow, that was pretty cool," and not thinking of it after that.  (Of
course, as with PULP FICTION, some could always take a deeper shine to
it.)
