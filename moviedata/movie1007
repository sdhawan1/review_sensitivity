     Rule number one for successful affairs: Do not leave your wedding
ring behind at your lover's apartment.
     Gorgeous and fabulously wealthy Emily Bradford Taylor has been
spending a lot of time lately with her favorite painter, the
impoverished David Shaw, and it's not just to admire his etchings.  We
watch them kiss while rolling over and over in bed so they must be more
than just good friends.  (Sex in the movies is, well, different.)
Although they naively believe that their clandestine relationship has
not been discovered, Emily's husband, Steven, knows, and he plans to
put a stop to it in a most unusual way.  He's going to offer David
$500,000 to kill Emily.
     A remake of Alfred Hitchcock's DIAL M FOR MURDER, A PERFECT MURDER
is by Steven Seagal's action director Andrew Davis (ABOVE THE LAW and
UNDER SIEGE), who seems lost remaking an intricate Hitchcockian
thriller.  Without the usual explosions or constant violence to
punctuate his movie, Davis has the cameras instead pan the Taylor
mansion so frequently that you may think it's the latest installment of
"The Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous."
     As investment banker Steven Taylor, Michael Douglas gives us
Gordon Gecko-lite.  Patrick Smith Kelly's script needs more sharply
drawn characters.  Steven, for example, should be more ruthless and
coldly calculating.  Instead, he's a villain without much of a
cinematic punch.
     As Steven's wife, Gwyneth Paltrow is certainly lovely, but she
lacks the visceral vulnerability necessary for the suspense to build
properly.  Paltrow seems more to be in a third parallel universe from
SLIDING DOORS than in a thriller.
     Viggo Mortensen from G. I. JANE plays the sleazy lover and "petty
swindler" David.  Badly miscast, Mortensen gives a fairly lifeless
performance.  Never threatening or particularly convincing, Mortensen
looks relatively disinterested in the entire production.
     David Suchet, television's Hercule Poirot, appears all too briefly
as Detective Mohamed Karaman.  His role, which could and should have
added an interesting investigative part to the story, is never
developed.  His character's sole purpose apparently is for Emily to be
able demonstrate her foreign language dexterity.  She converses with
him in his native tongue to inquire about his family's health.
     Once David accepts Steven's money, the story takes a few twists
and turns, but Davis stages the scenes without any regard for subtlety.
He brings the camera in tight and has it frame the future murder weapon
so that we all know in advance what will happen.  And when Steven drops
an envelope and paper with care, Davis zooms the camera in so we can
see David put his fingerprints on them.  Next, we watch Steven
meticulously covering the fingerprinted materials in case anyone in the
audience missed the last obvious clue.  Davis doesn't want any
"surprises" that are not suitably preannounced.
     In order to atone partially for the lackluster story, Davis
injects a heavy orchestral score by THE POSTMAN's James Newton Howard.
With long violin notes, pianos in the low registers, and blaring French
horns, we are reminded incessantly that this is a thriller no matter
how languid the pacing.
     Having the ingredients for a mystery isn't the same thing as
actually creating one.  One needs an accomplished chef to prepare the
dish, and Davis needs explosions and fast actions to concoct a
cinematic treat.  He had the recipe right in THE FUGITIVE, but he has
long since lost it.  His blow 'em up extravaganza, CHAIN REACTION, was
his last movie attempt, and it was a bomb in more ways than one.
     A thriller without much genuine suspense isn't much of a thriller
even if the atmospherics are dead-on as they are in A PERFECT MURDER.
The picture, however, is instructive.  In addition to the wedding ring
rule, we learn that, if you're fabulously rich, don't forget those
pre-nups.
     A PERFECT MURDER runs 1:47.  It is rated R for violence, profanity
and sex and would be fine for most teenagers.
     The film will open nationwide in the United States tomorrow,
Friday, June 5.  In the San Jose area it will be playing at the AMC and
Century theaters.

     I did not care much for Alfred Hitchcock's DIAL M FOR MURDER when
I saw it as a child.  It seemed a set-bound and a rather dry exercise.
Seeing it as an adult was an entirely different experience.  It clearly
is a stage play, but it has to be one of the most brilliant stage
thrillers ever written.  The entire play works like a well-oiled
machine of surprising complexity.  It was *the classic* stage murder
thriller.  Compared to DIAL M FOR MURDER, SLEUTH and DEATHTRAP are
merely gimmicky.  For DIAL M FOR MURDER, the playwright really sat down
and sweated all the details.  The one unrealistic touch is that main
character Tony Wendes is just too brilliant to be fully believed.  He
has a mind like a computer, thinking out all possibilities and
reconstructing his plans instant by instant.  The play must have been
rewritten over and over as Frederick Knott rethought the possibilities.
The remake A PERFECT MURDER has some of the plot, but it loses a lot in
the transition.
     In A PERFECT MURDER, the Taylors are probably one of the top 100
prominent couples in the country. Steven Taylor (played by Michael
Douglas) is an international commodities dealer who makes deals in the
hundreds of millions of dollars every day.  Emily Bradford Taylor
(played by Gwyneth Paltrow) is an heiress to one of the richest
families in America.  She has a position working as translator at the
United Nations General Assembly and as an aide to the Unite States
ambassador.  But Emily has other positions she likes more, fooling
around on the side with promising new artist David Shaw (Viggo
Mortensen).  Shaw has a future as an artist, but he also has a past,
and that he would like to keep quiet.  Unfortunately Steven Taylor
knows all about Shaw's past and has his own plans for Shaw's future.
The plans include killing Emily Taylor.  Saying any more about the new
and somewhat cluttered plot would really be telling too much.
     Michael Douglas is something of a master at portraying quiet
smoldering anger on the screen.  He is a good choice to show rage, but
he cannot bring to the role the kind of passionless thinking machine
quality that Ray Milland had in the original.  Luckily this script does
not call for Steven Taylor to make the sort of quick rethinking of
problems that Tony Wendes did in the original film.  Paltrow really
does have the sort of pristine good looks that are reminiscent of Grace
Kelly in the first film.  There are even scenes where she looks a bit
like Grace Kelly.  The problem is that the film insists on showing her
in bed with her lover. 1990s audiences demand to see some flesh, I
suppose.  There clearly is passion going on though nothing is seen that
really counts as nudity.  But what we do see of the sex is enough that
she no longer appears to the viewer to be an innocent.  And that loses
her the audience's sympathy.  We are left with several cold and
unsympathetic characters wandering around on the dark sets of this
film.  I should mention that Dariusz Wolski shot the film and if that
name is unfamiliar, he also filmed THE CROW and DARK CITY.  That should
tell you that he likes under-lit sets to create a cold and dark feel.
And this film certainly has that. Viggo Mortensen plays the third leg
of the romantic triangle.  He does not have much screen presence, but
he does have a very realistic look.  Rounding out the cast, but
appallingly under-used, is David Suchet as Detective Mohamed Karaman.
I suspect he had a bigger role in the original script.  It is his
character in the original play who does the real detective work.  But
rumors say that the end of the film was re-shot and presumably his role
was cut down in size.  Perhaps test audiences thought him solving the
crime was a little too close to what he does in his TV persona as
Hercule Poirot.  But for whatever the reason Suchet had only a small
part, and it was a serious waste to have such a good character actor in
so tiny a role.
     If you have seen the original film, there will still be plot
twists to keep you guessing, but you will also get an appreciation of
how good material can sour in the wrong hands.  It takes a remake like
A PERFECT MURDER to show the viewer how much has changed in the 1990s
conventions of films and to appreciate the genius of an Alfred
Hitchcock.  This cold and dark remake gets a 5 on the 0 to 10 scale and
a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.

With a name like A Perfect Murder, a movie has a lot to live up to. Is A
Perfect Murder perfect?
Stephen Taylor (Michael Douglas) is a big money mover who is married to
Emily (Gwyneth Paltrow), the daughter of a rich family. Emily is having an
affair with a grimy looking painter, David (Viggo Mortenson). 
The questions posed by the script are: Does Emily's husband know about the
affair? What would he do if he found out? How long can the affair last? And
is it really love that David is searching for?
If you have seen the previews for A Perfect Murder, you'll know that
Emily's husband does find out and he wants Emily dead. He plans the
"perfect murder" in which David is the killer. The plan is foolproof -- or
is it?
The plot unfolds slowly and is deliciously evil. Which makes the ending
feel somewhat like a cheat.
Director Andrew Davis (The Fugitive) tries to redeem himself here after his
horrible Chain Reaction. And Davis does an admirable job with A Perfect
Murder -- though, it never reaches the heights that his The Fugitive did.
The look of the film is engrossing with its high contrast lighting. This
has been done before and better -- look at Douglas's last film, The Game,
for this.
Performance-wise the best comes from Viggo Mortensen. Mortensen is one of
the most underrated and underused actors in Hollywood -- this is a shame
because Mortensen is a versatile and talented actor. If you've never seen
Mortensen, check out Crimson Tide and G.I. Jane also.
If Gwyneth Paltrow's Sliding Doors character had a third story line, A
Perfect Murder would have been it. Paltrow does nothing new here. Following
in Paltrow's footsteps, Douglas is not doing anything either. Douglas
almost seems like he didn't leave the set of his last film, The Game.
Paltrow and Douglas's lack in the performance arena doesn't hurt the film
at all though. The script is well written enough to make us overlook these
flaws.
One performance to look for is David Suchet as the head police
investigator. His part is small, but he makes a good impression.
Overall, I really liked A Perfect Murder and I recommend it. The film is
not a perfect murder, but it is still quite a good killing.

Director: Andrew Davis
Screenplay: Patrick Smith Kelly based on the play "Dial M for Murder" by
Frederick Knott
When it comes to a good ol' murder yarn, one wants to be surprised,
thrilled and kept in suspense throughout. With these elements in place,
one will be swept away with the mystery. There is no perfect murder,
there are only those who get away with the crime and those who aren't so
lucky. In the case of this movie, the crime is almost perfect, with the
one exception of human error.
In a re-make-over of the classic DIAL M, we are represented with that
most horrid scenario of a man wanting to murder his wife. What is made
more poignant this time round, by Gwynetth Paltrow playing the wife,
than in the original role played by Grace Kelly, is that the wife is
having an extra marital affair. Whether this is a sufficient reason to
commit murder, is debatable, but it is made clear in the plot that the
two major roots for murder are money and jealousy.
Keeping this in mind, we are led through one man's (Michael Douglas)
most horrid attempt at ridding himself of his most beautiful, unfaithful
wife. There are new elements added to the original Hitchcock classic,
bringing it up to date with current trend of nineties plot twisting. The
lover (Viggo Mortensen) is one of these elements. This is not necessary
better, but does give a different perspective to those who have already
seen the many reruns of the original. Those who haven't seen the
Hitchcock classic, are the ones who will most likely appreciate this
almost perfect mystery.
Michael Douglas is ideal as the cold, manipulative husband, and all his
WALL STREET colours shine through brilliantly in this role. Gwyneth
Paltrow is as usual charming and beautiful as the wealthy, unfaithful
wife. Not classical material, but more a valiant attempt at trying to
recreate the magic of DIAL M.

Starring: Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Viggo Mortensen, David

Synopsis:
This movie is about various battles between three characters. Steven
(Michael Douglas) is a greedy old rich guy whose fortune is going down
the tubes, fast. But he stands to inherit extra money if his heiress
wife dies. Emily (Gwyneth Paltrow) is Steven's beautiful unfaithful
wife. She is a United Nations linguist who doesn't love Steven, and is
having a steamy affair with artist David. Meanwhile David (Viggo
Mortensen) is a manipulative money grubbing ladies man who has targeted
Emily's riches. 
The story opens with Emily and David committing adultery, and Steven
secretly finding out about it. From then it's a question of who plans to
kill whom, and who foils whom. The greedy and clever Steven gets the
lion's share of the battles and schemes, battling both David and Emily.
Of course, one of the three plots a perfect murder, hence the title.
An interesting side character is introduced in the form of Detective
Mohamed Karaman (David Suchet) a sharp police chief who noses around
investigating the murder. 
Opinion: 
On the good side, it's interesting to see which one of the three
strategists - - David, Steven, or Emily - - will emerge victorious in
the end. On the bad side, the matchups are kind of lopsided. Steven and
David seem to be masters of deceit, while Emily's the kind of person who
- - soon after being brutalized by a thug - - deliberately wanders
around alone in a seedy lower class neighborhood. Emily shows promising
multilingual abilities which she uses to make the acquaintance of
Detective Karaman and some Hispanic tenants, but it turns out she can
just as easily complete her strategies without them, and in English.
I was a little bit disappointed in the weak alliance between Emily and
Karaman. As soon as Detective Karaman arrives on scene to investigate
the murder, there's an instant feeling of electricity. Here's a guy who
can read human nature from a mile away. Karaman is brilliantly played by
David Suchet (he also plays Agatha Christie's Inspector Hercule Poirot
in the PBS detective series). He takes compassion on Emily, and
likewise, she connects to his Middle Eastern culture and language, but
unfortunately, the two don't partner up as in cop buddy movies.
If you liked Michael Douglas as the heartless corporate raider Gordon
Gekko in Oliver Stone's WALL STREET, he gives basically the same
performance here. Meanwhile - - as the sleazy, long-haired artist - -
Viggo Mortensen does a complete about face from his crew cut navy Master
Chief John Urgayle role in GI JANE. Mortensen does a great job as the
reprehensible young artist. Of the three, Gwyneth Paltrow probably has
the most complicated character. Is she a cold and unfaithful vixen who
has latched on to a wealthy marriage of convenience, or is she just a
naďve linguist in search of empowerment?
It's tough to root for any of the three main characters when the
winner's got to be either an adulteress, a sleazy young manipulator, or
a greedy old manipulator. What good is a schlumpy, morally relativistic
message, right? However, it's interesting from a dramatic standpoint to
watch the actors/actresses one-up each other.

Few directors can claim to have improved on the Master of Suspense, Alfred
Hitchcock, but Andrew Davis' "A Perfect Murder" eclipses Hitch's "Dial M for
Murder."
Truth be told, of course, "Dial M" was a substandard product for the Master. 
(But only an idiot or Gus Van Sant would remake a great film).  Adapted from
Frederick Knott's popular stage play, Hitchcock's movie remained stage-bound;
all of its action takes place in one room, and "Dial M" lacks the
experimentation of "Rope" (also a one-room stage adaptation).  As the husband
plotting to kill his wife, Ray Milland was coldly evil but uninteresting.  As
the wife, Grace Kelly was beautiful and vulnerable, and that seemed to be all
that was required of her.
Davis' version retains the basic skeleton of "Dial M"'s plot:  a wife has a guy
on the side; her husband hires someone to murder her, but she kills the
attacker instead; the husband tries to retrieve the house key he gave the
killer but picks the wrong one.  However,  Patrick Smith Kelly's screenplay
takes that basic story in new and interesting directions.  Steven (Michael
Douglas) is a cold and distant millionaire husband to Emily (Gwyneth Paltrow),
who is boffing David (Viggo Mortensen), a bohemian artist.  But David is hiding
a secret past as an ex-con, and Steven blackmails him into a plot to kill
Emily.  Emily spikes the would-be killer with a meat thermometer and soon
discovers the plot against her.  Several plot twists and double-crosses follow.
Besides having a fleshier plot, "A Perfect Murder" boasts better acting than
"Dial M" (directing actors was always Hitch's weak point).  Paltrow stands out
by not simply hashing out another rendition of the stock character Threatened
Woman.  Emily is vulnerable enough to be sympathetic but also tough enough to
be respected.  Douglas is his usual sinister self, part-pouting-victim,
part-vengeful-aggressor.  Mortensen is the weakest cast member and brings
little to the table.
Despite the improvements, "A Perfect Murder" is still genre fare, but it is an
entertaining diversion.  Davis, best known for large-scale action movies like
"The Fugitive" and "Under Siege," shows that he can be just as effective with a
character-driven piece.

   "A Perfect Murder" is an ironic title given the fact that
Hollywood movies rarely involve killers who get away with
their crimes.  Considering the cleverness of its villain, it's
difficult to believe he would commit so many flaws in planning
the murder of his wife--or even that he would allow himself to
lose so much money on Wall Street that he would be
financially wiped out.  While the errors in his scheme make
the plot more predictable than we'd like, Andrew Davis's
direction of Patrick Smith Kelly's screenplay is so disciplined
that the film maintains its suspense from beginning to end. 
Based on the play "Dial M for Murder" by Frederick Knott,
later made by Alfred Hitchcock ito a clunky movie starring Ray
Milland, "A Perfect Murder" relies on its excellent cast to rivet
audience attention.  Though Michael Douglas is still Gordon
Gecko, he  plies his craft with enough variety to involve us. 
There's simply no one else who can carry off the demeanor of
a cold, calculating, handsome and passionate money man.
   "A Perfect Murder" begins in bed as Emily (Gwyneth
Paltrow), the trophy wife of currency trader Steven Taylor
(Michael Douglas), is carrying on a torrid affair with a much
younger man, painter David Shaw (Viggo Mortensen). 
Though she is not yet aware, her husband has detected and
photographed her afternoon movements and feels deeply
deceived by the woman he loves for herself and not primarily
for her $100 million worth.  When she arrives home to their
drop-dead designer apartment overlooking New York's Central
Park, she and Steven say all the right things but you can tell
by their body language that things are wrong.  She
avoids his eyes; his are flashing with justifiable anger.  The
couple are mismatched in age, Emily about twenty-five years
Steven's junior.  Though they attend the same functions and
appear to be of the same social class, her straying is almost
excusable.
   The film spends most of its time in the planning of a
murder, with Steven's offer of $500,000 to the man he is
convinced will accept the assignment because of certain
information he can use to blackmail the perp.  Steven's
motivation all the more believable as he has suffered a drastic
financial loss on the market which has wiped him out.  The
narrative is gripping not only in the well-executed unfolding of
the crime but even more in the insight the story gives us into
the lives of the super rich and in the subtle ways the
characters show their feelings for one another.  Emily's
mother, Sandra (Constance Towers) welcomes her daughter
to a spacious suburban home and shoots a glance of dislike
toward Steven.  Is she disappointed that her daughter married
a man who is so much older?  Does she have some insight
into the nature of his character?  Mohamed Karaman (David
Suchet), in the role of detective inspector Mohamed Karaman,
is immediately suspicious of Steven, a vague intuition,
perhaps, and as an Arab-American is charmed by Emily's
knowledge of the Arabic language.  Despite her wealth, Emily
works, but in a glamour job as a multilingual translator at
United Nations headquarters, where she is best friends with
Raquel--a woman whom Steven calls "the Castilian femme
fatale" (but who does not look at all Castilian).  Steven plays
cards at the club with $1,000 as a typical opening bet, and
Emily "lunches" with her friend.  Yet Emily takes the subway
to a drug nest and charms a dealer by speaking his language
while Steven spends some time in a dilapidated loft building in
the downscale Greenpoint section of Brooklyn.
   Director Andrew Davis gets good work from his classy cast,
getting Douglas to portray a man who is driven by greed but
by his feelings of betrayal as well.  David Suchet, known to
aficionados of detective stories as Agatha Christie's Hercule
Poirot, is appropriately all-knowing as the skeptical police
inspector, and Viggo Mortensen--who plays a guy who is not
what he seems--can effectively vary his chameleon-like
demeanor according to the needs of the situation.
    The film's ending is too neat, even juvenile.  A European
version would rely more on a chessboard artifice than on light
artillery.  "A Perfect Murder," which features opulent settings
as one of its principal characters, is a vigorous entry into the
summer entertainment market.

A PERFECT MURDER is supposedly a remake of Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 film
DIAL M FOR MURDER.  In truth, it only uses the setup and a few details
from the original.  Wealthy financier Steven Taylor (Michael Douglas)
discovers that his beauteous and much younger wife Emily (Gwyneth
Paltrow) has a lover, so he decides to have her killed.  Rather than
blackmailing an outside party into doing the job, as in the original,
the businessman hires the lover, a con artist posing as a starving
artist named David Shaw (Viggo Mortensen).  With cold logic, Steven has
designed the murder to look like a routine burglary gone wrong, but his
intended victim fouls it up by killing the hit man in self-defense.
The movie is no masterpiece, but it's somewhat better than the lukewarm
reviews might lead you to believe.  The updating has mostly improved on
the original film, which just preceded Hitchcock's amazing run of
masterpieces, beginning with REAR WINDOW (1954) and ending with PSYCHO
(1960), THE BIRDS (1963), or MARNIE (1964), depending on whom you ask. 
DIAL M FOR MURDER shackles Hitchcock with Frederick Knott's stagey play
and the 400-pound immobile camera he had to use to film in 3-D.  With
its drab color and stiff acting, the only entertainment value in DIAL M
FOR MURDER is watching Ray Milland be what Hitchcock unwisely tried to
make out of Cary Grant in SUSPICION (1941) - a genteel charmer with an
icy murderous side.
Director Andrew Davis is still struggling to regain his form from 1993's
THE FUGITIVE.  He's so taken with showing us how fabulously rich these
people are that his direction skirts the absurd - the Taylors 
drink out of martini glasses that look like Jacuzzis.  Dariusz Wolski's
high-contrast photography looks self-important amid Manhattan's
jet-set.  By contrast, Michael Chapman's cinematography for THE FUGITIVE
combined with that movie's Chicago setting to give it a grim elegance. 
A PERFECT 
MURDER moves quickly and efficiently, but that only works with the
movie's glossiness to make it seem glib and disposable.
The remake does smooth out many of the original's implausibilities. 
DIAL M FOR MURDER leaves you wondering why the cuckolded husband doesn't
simply off the boyfriend and have done with it.  Patrick Smith Kelly's
script gives him a reason - his business is in trouble and his wife is
worth a ton of money to him dead.  Viggo Mortensen is preferable to the
stodgy and inept Robert Cummings in the original, and David Suchet's
basso profundo homicide cop (a rare positive portrayal of an
Arab-American in a Hollywood movie) is much weightier than John
Williams's fussy Scotland Yard 'tec.  Even the remake's disappointingly
conventional (and confusing) grappling-for-the-gun ending is better than
the tediously anticlimactic walk-through of the failed hit that
concludes Hitchcock's movie.  The updating, though, doesn't explain why
the Taylors don't have an answering machine, which is why Emily has to
get out of her bathtub to answer the phone so she can be attacked.
Michael Douglas spins perhaps the cruellest variation yet on his
embattled rich white man act.  His power-tripping megalomaniac in WALL
STREET isn't a killer, while his dangerously out-of-control cop in BASIC
INSTINCT is at least more casual in his brutality.  The night Emily is
supposed to be killed, she pleads with Steven to stay home and obviously
wants to admit everything.  He gives her a cold stare with a hint of a
smile in it as he says, "It's too late."  The tightly controlled Douglas
is, as one might expect, good at playing a control freak, but you wish
he had relaxed a bit and hit the key moments harder, like at the end
where he tells Emily, "The only way you leave me is dead."
It's only appropriate that Paltrow plays the Grace Kelly role, because
Paltrow essentially is Grace Kelly - a patrician goddess with a sense of
fun - but warmer and more vulnerable.  That vulnerability, projected 
through the very Paltrowvian stare that radiates confusion and pain,
probably got her cast in this thriller.  Like some other tall actresses,
she seems apologetic for her height, and here it gives the effect of a
16-year-old dolled up in designer gowns.  She looks callow and out of
her depth here, but then the character is out of her depth as well.  Had
the movie been made in 1990, Julia Roberts would have played this part. 
Roberts is now mature enough to select interesting material on her own,
but Paltrow's getting stuck with the boring damsel-in-distress roles. 
There's every reason to hope that she, too, will overcome Hollywood's 
typecasting.
Paltrow's presence is enough to provide a rooting interest, but the
movie's real problem isn't unsympathetic characters (as some reviewers
have said) but a lack of chemistry between any of the leads.  The
Taylors don't have a believable marriage.  Steven knows about the affair
and is set on murder from the beginning, while Emily cringes inwardly
whenever her husband touches her.  Good for the plot, but what brought
these people together in the first place?  Since Emily comes from money
and doesn't need it to marry it, why would she attach herself to a
middle-aged sadist, albeit a handsome and well-connected one?  You
really don't blame her for having an affair, but Mortensen doesn't have
the razzle-dazzle of a professional ladies' man, and somehow doesn't
strike me as a guy who's dynamite in the sack.  It's the shallowness of
the movie's personal relationships that make A PERFECT MURDER less than
the sum of its parts.

Frederick Knott)

Suchet, Sarita Choudhury
"A Perfect Murder" is, of course, lifted from "Dial M For Murder," the 
play that was later transformed into a terrific Hitchcock movie starring 
Ray Milland and Grace Kelly, thus this film belongs in the elite 
sub-sub-genre of films known as Hitch Remakes. Hitchcock is commonly 
referred to as the Master of Suspense, and rightly so, but he was a 
quaint director and liked to deal more with character development and 
set pieces rather than dump thin characters in a silly plot - he made 
his stories believable and involving by major use of directorial tricks 
and the like, but never corrupted his films. And his fims were his own; 
no one has ever been able to immitate his filmmaking abilities because 
he had such a gentle, unique touch when it came to movies. Why directors 
are so arrogant to think they can imitate him is beyond me (Gus Van 
Sant, that was directed towards you), especially since thrillers just 
aren't made like that these days, and that's why I'm just a little more 
open-minded towards Andrew Davis for making "A Perfect Murder" almost 
nothing like the original. The plot - a millionaire hires an assasin to 
kill his cheating wife - is the same, more or less, and the (attempted) 
assasination involves a distracting (for her) phone call.
But that, refreshingly, is where the similarities end. Why refreshing? 
Like an adaptation of a novel, why can't remakes be exactly the same, 
changing as little as possible? Or at least you'd probably think that 
was my thinking, but alas, that isn't as of now. Over the summer, just 
hearing the fact that the lover is hired to kill her drove me nuts; 
nowadays, after hearing the spectacle de crap that was the "Psycho" 
shot-for-shot remake (to be fair, though, I still haven't seen it), I've 
had a change of heart, basically because if a film (or an adaptation of 
a novel) is exactly the same, why should I watch that and not the 
original, which is the authentic one? Well, "A Perfect Murder" changes a 
whole lot from the original play and subsequent film: the assasin is 
changed, as I said; it takes place all over the city, instead of mostly 
inside an apartment; it does immensely less with the detective (David 
Suchet, limited to merely being a sporadic visitor), involving the 
characters more; and the ending is changed incessantly, as well as other 
smaller details (the wife is given a friend and a UN job, etc.).
On paper, it looks pretty good: it makes it more of a morality play, 
dealing with the villainy and evil of each of the characters, at least 
in some way. Not only does the husband wreak evil-incarnate, but the 
boyfriend is given a twisted other-side, and the wife even gets to do 
her own evilness (at least it appears so in an unused, alternate ending 
I was priveleged to see). Some not bad ideas, here, and the ingredients 
for a twisted little thriller. Alas, it isn't really so. While there is 
a lot to like about "A Perfect Murder," mostly of what's above, it's an 
overall disappointing and run-of-the-mill thriller, not too suprising as 
it comes to us courtesy of Andrew Davis, who, yes, directed the terrific 
"The Fugitive" a couple years back, but if you also remember has 
directed a cheapo Steven Seagal movie or two (well, I almost liked 
"Under Siege," but "Above the Law" blew and you know it), as well as a 
couple other disappointments (do you even remember "Steal Big, Steal 
Little?"). Sure, Michael Douglas gives another great, chilling 
performance, the kind he's best known for (read: George Gekko), adding 
mounts upon mounts of tension into such simple scenes of saying hello to 
his wife after a day at work. And he's our protagonist, thankfully, 
ensuring that we'll be front row for some Machiavellian instances of 
gusto.
But instead of being truly twisted, "A Perfect Murder" tosses him into a 
series of twists and turns that slowly become so manufactured and 
questionable that the film soon loses all credibility and descends into 
yet another generic thriller that Hitchcock would have never made 
without a full frontal labotomy. At first, the first big twist, 
concerning the lover (Viggo Mortensen, so marble-mouthed that the film 
should require subtitles when he speaks) works, and it continues to work 
throughout, but the implausibility gear kicks in after awhile, and a 
twist towards the end is so cliched and questionable that I couldn't 
believe the surviving character was so cool about it afterwards. He 
loses his edge along the way, as well, occasionally treated like a 
Richard III-esque anti-hero, as we follow him along with his numerous 
schemes to be the surviving character in this charade, and then treated 
like the supreme villain of the piece because the film's not sure what 
to do with him. It's afraid to go all the way and accept Douglas as our 
anti-hero, like the original film did, and in turn, deceives its own 
protagonist and even we the audience. It only hurts more that his 
character is saddled with such a pathetic excuse for an ending; I'd 
almost like to make a movie law about the use of gunshots to end 
thrillers - they're merely half-assed ways of finishing a conflict when 
they could be finished with a much more complex and much more satisfying 
finale (unforunately, that's not going to be the alternate ending I 
saw).
I'd be willing to look over this (I did with "The Cook, The Thief, His 
Wife, and Her Lover") if it had been satisfying up till then, but sadly 
enough it's only marginally satisfying up to that point anyway. 
Throughout, the script takes numerous easy-way-outs amongst the clever 
twists of the storyline, and instead of being a gleefully twisted duel 
between Douglas and Mortensen, both of whom are greedy, it adds on 
maudlin sympathy involving the wife (played nicely by Gwyneth Paltrow), 
who is seen as a whole other section of the movie as the big 
distraction: she may uncover some cheap truths about Douglas (why can't 
it be more about his wounded ego and NOT about mere greed), but she also 
ends up as the Achilles Heal to Mortensen, a huge detractor for the 
film. This ends up taking us out of the film, and doubting the film's 
handle on his character: is he changing from his past self, and if he 
is, then why is he at the same time not - I mean, what gives, man? 
Throughout, Davis directs with a mistaken amount of distance from the 
situation, as if he's not sure whose story this actually is. In the 
original, Hitchcock gave some sympathy for the husband, and later on, 
made it about wife and the husband. But Davis isn't sure who to 
highlight at any time, and we never feel for any of them, not even 
Paltrow's wife character. A great thriller would have us identifying 
with all of them, and then slowly and subtlely closing in on all of them 
as they play off one another.
I'm not much of a fan of Davis, save for his work on "The Fugitive," and 
I'm again not a fan after this film: his use of suspense is too slick 
and shock-loving. He even mucks up the assasination scene: in the 
original, the most memorable image was Kelly on the phone, oblivious to 
the assasin behind her (it's even on the cover of the tape, folks); 
here, it's another forgettable, in-the-moment jump into frame 
assasination, never more frightening than a quick jump in your seat, 
forgettable seconds later (though I have to applaud its replacement for 
the scissors - nice touch). Not that I'm wishing it were more like the 
original; I'd just like to see it as the competent, chilling film that 
it apparently wants to be but isn't. Instead, it's a film filled with a 
couple smart aspects, some nice twists, and a good jump or two, but 
absolutely nothing that you'll remember more than a week after seeing 
it. Here's to hoping someday someone will be able to make a Hitch remake 
that can successfully stand up on its own. Or, rather, how about just 
abandoning remakes altogether and instead coming up with a wholly 
original thriller, huh?

     Any remake of an Alfred Hitchcock film is at best an uncertain 
project, as A PERFECT MURDER illustrates.  Frankly, DIAL M FOR MURDER is 
not one of the master director's greatest efforts, so there is ample 
room for improvement.  Unfortunately, instead of updating the script, 
ironing out some of the faults, and speeding up the pace a little, A 
PERFECT MURDER has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything 
that was worthwhile about DIAL M FOR MURDER, leaving behind the nearly-
unwatchable wreckage of a would-be '90s thriller.  
     Almost all suspense films are loaded with plot implausibilities.  
The best thrillers keep viewers involved enough in what's going on so 
that these flaws in logic don't become apparent until long after the 
final credits have rolled.  Unfortunately, in A PERFECT MURDER, the 
faults are often so overt that we become aware of them as they're 
happening.  This is a very bad sign.  Not only do such occurrences 
shatter any suspension of disbelief, but they have the astute viewer 
looking for the next such blunder.  Of course, in the case of A PERFECT 
MURDER, at least that gives an audience member something to do besides 
concentrating on the inane plot and the lifeless, cardboard characters.
     A PERFECT MURDER isn't a strict remake of DIAL M FOR MURDER, but it 
does borrow heavily from Frederick Knott's play (which was also the 
source material for Hitchcock's version, as well as a 1981 made-for-TV 
retelling).  Emily Hayes (Gwyneth Paltrow) is the wealthy wife of 
powerful Wall Street mover-and-shaker Steven Hayes (Michael Douglas).  
Their marriage isn't going well -- Emily resents Steven's controlling 
instincts, and, as a form of rebellion, she is having an affair with a 
penniless painter, David Shaw (Viggo Mortensen).  When Steven learns of 
the relationship, he decides to confront David, but his approach isn't 
that of a typical cuckolded husband.  Instead of yelling or threatening, 
Steven offers David a proposal that's too good to resist:  for $500,000 
in cash ($100,000 before, the rest after), he is to break into Steven's 
New York apartment and kill Emily. (Of course, after getting the first 
payment, David never bothers to ask how he's supposed to get the rest.)
     Ultimately, I'm not sure which of the three main characters we're 
supposed to be sympathetic to:  the cold-hearted husband, who wants his 
wife dead so he can get his hands on her fortune; her mercenary lover, 
who is willing to do the deed for half-a-million; or the woman, who is 
happily carrying on an extramarital affair.  Not only are these 
individuals all profoundly dislikable, but they're not interesting.  
(It's possible to make a good movie with detestable characters -- see 
RESERVOIR DOGS -- but there has to be something compelling about them, 
which, in this case, there isn't.)  Steven, Emily, and David are all 
lifted directly from the Screenwriting 101 text book on stereotypes.
     The actors in this film are obviously just on hand to get their 
paychecks.  Michael Douglas is playing the kind of heartless tycoon that 
he can do in his sleep -- he's Gordon Gekko with an unfaithful wife.  
Gwyneth Paltrow, who was recently delightful and appealing in SLIDING 
DOORS, is simply awful here.  She now has the dubious distinction of 
have starred in two of 1998's worst thrillers (the other being HUSH).  
At least Viggo Mortensen (G.I. JANE) has a little fun with his part, but 
then he usually does interesting things even in bad movies.  The thin 
supporting cast includes David Suchet, the star of "Poirot," as a police 
inspector, and Sarita Choudhury (KAMA SUTRA) as Emily's best friend.
     A PERFECT MURDER is a plodding production that generates almost no 
suspense from beginning to end.  There aren't many twists and turns in 
the unexpectedly linear script, which makes the ending inevitable almost 
from the start.  It's surprising to see director Andrew Davis, the man 
behind THE FUGITIVE, involved in this mess, but, like his stars, he too 
needs to earn a living.  It's just that remaking Hitchcock, and doing it 
so badly, hardly seems to be an honorable way to go about getting the 
dough.

A Perfect Murder (1998) 1 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Michael Douglas,
Gwyenth Paltrow and Viggo Mortensen
 A Perfect Murder is an imperfect movie.
 A stylish thriller, loosely based on Dial M for Murder, which was one of
Alfred Hitchcock's lesser thrillers of the 1950s, A Perfect Murder is cold
and uninvolving.
 And while all the intricacies are in place for what could have been an
entertaining thriller, scriptwriter Patrick Smith Kelly seems to have
forgotten one important ingredient - humanity.
 Steven Taylor (Michael Douglas) and his much-younger wife, Emily (Gwyneth
Paltrow), are among New York's elite. Money, power, a beautiful home - they
have it all.
 Emily also has something extra - a lover. David Shaw, a poor artist, is
actually a con artist whose specialty is bilking rich women out of their
fortunes.
 Steven discovers the affair and hires David to murder Emily.
 From there, the plot unwinds in a continual charade of double dealings and
double crosses.
 But it is all so cold and impersonal that the viewer really doesn't give a
hoot about who does what to whom. Will Steven's plot succeed? Will Emily
realize her husband's duplicity? Who cares.
 It's fun to watch, but there is definitely no emotional involvement.
Paltrow is lovely, like a chiseled blonde goddess. Douglas is chilling and
level-headed.
 Viggo Mortensen seems out of his depth as an artist (who, by the way,
learned his trade in prison), but comes to life when he reverts to his con
man personna.
 But even then he remains overshadowed by his two co-stars.
 Nor is it ever explained how this starving artist made contact with the
patrician Emily, nor how he can afford his spacious loft.
 The only glimpse of humanity offered anywhere in the film is from
character actor David Suchet as the police detective investigating the
Taylors' lives.
 Director Andrew Davis, whose best work still remains The Fugitive, keeps
the proceedings moving at a leisurely pace. He offers few tricks and a
couple of surprises, but nothing earth shaking that would set A Perfect
Murder apart from any of a dozen other movies rolling off the studio
assembly line.
 What this movie needs is a bit of heart, a touch of compassion. Without
it, A Perfect Murder is just a sterile outing. It's like going to a museum
and looking at the pretty pictures without being able to get close to the
artworks.

Remake of Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 thriller originally titled DIAL M FOR
MURDER, pits Michael Douglas alongside Gwyneth Paltrow and Viggo
Mortensen, under the direction of Andrew Davis, the man behind the
1993's FUGITIVE (8/10) starring Harrison Ford.
PLOT:
Caught in a loveless marriage, Paltrow hooks up in an affair with
artist Mortensen. Paltrow's ultra-rich husband Douglas soon finds out
about the tryst, and develops a foolproof plan to murder his wife. The
plan does not quite go as planned, and all three characters are left
dangling in a plot filled with double-crosses, blackmail and intrigue.
CRITIQUE:
Effective, well-paced murder mystery set within the elite of New York's
high society, melds elements of intrigue and suspense, with some plot
holes and plenty of guesses as to what's gonna happen next. This film
kept me (and Mrs. JoBlo) guessing all the way through, and added to the
overall enjoyment of this imperfect mystery. I'd heard predictability
complaints from others that had already seen this picture, but let me
tell you that most of the stuff that went down in this movie was quite
the surprise to this guy! The performances, on the other hand, were
not.
All three characters were your basic Hollywood movie cardboard cutouts,
but still, the actors all managed to pull off some decent performances.
Michael Douglas has all but certified his position as the ultimate
rich-guy with rocks of steel, as this performance and his earlier
tours-of-force in THE GAME (8/10) and Gordon Gekko (my hero!) in WALL
STREET (8.5/10) have undoubtedly proven. Paltrow didn't really do much
with this role, but then again, it wasn't written with much in mind.
Her character seemed quite ignorant and aloof for most of the film. But
Viggo Mortensen, well heck, now there's an actor with some bite!! If
you have yet to hear much about this man, open your ears, and listen
wide. This guy can act...and act well goddammit! I have loved almost
all of his performances, with his role in THE INDIAN RUNNER (6/10) and
last year's G.I. JANE (6.5/10) standing out in my mind, and certainly a
force to reckon for all great future character roles. Watch for
him...he's hot!
On the whole, this film never bored me, always kept me guessing, and
offered some ripe performances from some decent actors, while never
overplaying itself. It will definitely not go down in the history of
film as one of the greatest mysteries to ever be shown on the big
screen, but then again, it ain't a stinker either. Curl up with your
loved one, shut the lights, inhale those nachos, and try to figure out
who's going to be doing what to whom next. You'll have a fun time,
despite the film's lack of major breakthroughs.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Viggo Mortensen actually painted the large murals in his artist's
studio in this film. He also lived in South America from age 2 to age
11.
Gwyneth Paltrow admitted that her romantic scenes with Michael Douglas
felt weird in this film, because he had practically seen her grow up
before his very eyes, since Michael and her father, Bruce Paltrow, are
good friends. On August 15, 1998, Gwyneth gave a $21,000 watch to
boyfriend Ben Affleck as a birthday present. She stands 5'9.
Michael Douglas won an Oscar for Best Actor for his role as Gordon
Gekko in 1987's Oliver Stone film WALL STREET (8.5/10). He also
produced the Oscar-winning film for Best Picture in 1975, ONE FLEW OVER
THE CUCKOO'S NEST (7.5/10), whose movie rights were owned by Mike's
father, Kirk Douglas, for a long time before his son finally started
the project.

As antiquated as the formula is, I'm surprised Hollywood keeps it
around: wife cheats on abusive spouse and, instead of leaving him,
convinces her lover to kill him so they can be together and get all
his money.  Or, roles can be switched and jealous husband can be the
one doing the plotting.  As is the case with MURDER, nicely conceived
and gamely acted.
Douglas plays a businessman, Steven Taylor.  His business is about to
go bankrupt.  His wife, Emily (Paltrow), is having an affair with a
painter across town, named David (the expressionless Mortensen).  They
plan to let Steven in on it - she more than he: "It's not fair to
him".  But, Steven is no dupe.  Though, how he knows, or even
suspects, enough to have the two photographed during an afternoon
rendezvous, is never explained.
Standard stuff.  But, the movie has smart, thinking individuals.  Like
Douglas, who has his plan to do away with his wife down to how and why
to do what with keys.  And, Mortensen - a scamster - who agrees to do
the "wet work", but has plans, also.  Every detail of the murder plot,
and the complications that inevitably arise, seems to be coherent and
logical, and it's kind of fun watching the genre played out
intelligently for once.
I liked someof the physical acting between Paltrow and Mortensen, as
during an art exhibition where he sees her, starts walking toward her
and she inconspicuously waves him off.  Then, once they've met in the
corner, and Douglas comes upon them, they act completely natural and
never give any sort of nervous reaction that maybe he knows.
And I liked the way Douglas seemed to have everything figured out, and
together.  He's able to verbally explain his motives with well- chosen
words.  I like dialogue where people come at the subject of discussion
from not just one angle, but think a situation through, think about
every possibility.  MURDER has that kind of banter.
I just wish the film had been about more.  I kept waiting for it to
ask questions movies like this never ask.  For instance, why does the
Paltrow character keep saying it's not fair to her husband to keep her
affair a secret?  As if she's concerned about how he feels.  I'm
wondering why she would've had the affair in the first place, and not
worry about how it may or may not affect him, and why it would only
hit her a good ways into the affair to at least let him know about it.
Does she love her husband?  People don't usually get married
otherwise, right?  And if she does love him, how much or how little
that she can't try and work things out?  Or, _has_ she tried?  Does
she care about whether or not she has hurt him, or that she'll hurt
him again?  Steven doesn't seem like such a bad guy (of course, he
_is_, but that's only later on).  He's rich.  He likes being rich,
gives him a certain air of superiority (at one point he tells Paltrow
which dress to wear - so, you know he's a real creep).  Maybe he makes
her feel small, and insecure, but has it always been that way?  How
did it _get_ that way?  Also, there's no tangible chemistry between
Paltrow and Mortensen, furthering my question into
why-is-she-with-either- man territory.
The same goes for Douglas' character.  He has multiple reasons for
wanting his wife dead, not just the obvious (which, come to think,
isn't really a reason at all, considering what he's most worried
with).  But, why is he married to her?
It's an inconsequential line of inquiry in the end, I guess, but
wouldn't answering such questions - or even addressing them - give the
film a little more dramatic depth?  Of course, that would make a
longer movie.  But hey, attention spans do exist.
And why, oh why, do they have to revert to a violent ending?  I saw a
movie once called, I believe, LADY BEWARE.  It starred Diane Lane.
The storyline wasn't quite the same, but it, too, could have ended in
a violent way.  Instead, it chose a more subtle approach that was
much, much more effective.  A PERFECT MURDER deserved one of those,
because it has a lot going for it already.  -R-

I find that the presence of Michael Douglas in a film will make that
particular film seem smarter.  There's something about the 
condescending way he delivers dialogue that instantly inflates the
intelligence level of the film.  Of course, this heightened intelligence
may an illusion, such as in A Perfect Murder, but the point is that
Douglas fools you through the duration of the film's running time.  (The
one exception to the Douglas Rule is, of course, the unwatchable The
Ghost and the Darkness, in which he acts very silly.) 
A Perfect Murder is the new film from director Andrew Davis, who also
brought us The Fugitive.  He also brought us Chain Reaction, which, many
will agree, is not as good as The Fugitive.  I think Davis is getting
better at what he does, and A Perfect Murder should prove to most people
that he has a lot of style and knows how to handle suspense pretty
well.  The problem here is with Patrick Smith Kelly's script, which
relies far too heavily on a convoluted and contrived plot, and not
enough on characterization or anything that seems even remotely
plausible.
Douglas plays a rich guy named Steven Taylor.  Gwyneth Paltrow plays
his wife, Emily; and Viggo Mortensen plays her lover, David Shaw.  Now,
if you've seen the previews, you should be aware that this is a film
that banks on plot twists.  The first twist is early, and it's bad form
for me to tell it to you simply on the basis of plot synopsis.  I'll
just say that Steven becomes aware of his wife's infidelity, and he
develops a plan to eradicate her in an easy and fashionable manor.  Oh
hell, he plans a perfect murder.
The film is always fun to watch, and it certainly never gets boring. 
Davis, along with cinematographer Dariusz Wolski and production designer
Philip Rosenberg, has created an atmospheric and extremely rich setting
for the characters to roam through.  The film isn't overflowing with
style, but it has just the right amount to keep you interested without
making you horribly aware of the nifty camera angles.  
A Perfect Murder is based on the play Dial M for Murder, which was made
into a terrific film by Hitchcock in 1954.  It's important to remember
that A Perfect Murder is not a remake of Hitchcock's film, nor is it
derivative of it in any way.  I was glad to see that Davis didn't try to
imitate Hitchcock, although most of what I liked most about Dial M for
Murder is not present in Davis' film.  A Perfect Murder falls back on
mindless action and unlikely plot developments, whereas Hitchcock's film
was intriguing and always believable.  
Of course, that isn't Davis' fault.  I do admire Kelly for trying to
make a very complicated story and still tie all the loose ends together,
but the story simply falls apart when you think about it.  Characters
are forced to do things that they wouldn't do.  Lives hang in the
balance of chance meetings and unlikely coincidences.  People believe
things they shouldn't, and say things that incriminate them, and make up
elaborate and perfect lies in half seconds.  The funny thing is, Davis
weaves the material so seamlessly that the Swiss-cheese-ness of Kelly's
script is only blatantly noticeable on afterthought.
The acting is good, although one of the major problems with the film is
that there really aren't any sympathetic characters.  Douglas plays
nearly the same role that won him the Oscar for Wall Street, although
his performance here suggests more depth in his character and maybe even
a little bit of a conscience (gasp!); eventually, however, he does
things that only hateful sub-humans would do.  Mortensen proves his
versatility again (you might not even recognize him as Demi Moore's
nemesis in G.I. Jane), and does some interesting things with his
character.  Paltrow is also good, but she's the character we're supposed
to root for, and yet there's nothing much to like about her.
Oh, I'm just quibbling.  I liked watching this movie.  It's fun, and
even surprising in a lot of parts.  It could have been better though,
and more realistic, but Andrew Davis at least has shown me that he can
carry his talent beyond The Fugitive.  And as for Douglas, Hollywood
should keep casting him as smart characters in silly movies, because he
sure is good at pulling a messy script together and making it seem smart
. . . even if it is just an illusion.

Andrew Hicks
        Not so perfect, I'd say. At the beginning of the movie, 
Michael Douglas gives a toast "to stolen moments." A PERFECT MURDER 
is full of them, and Lord Hitchcock must turn over in his grave every 
time someone watches it. Dial R for this ripoff of Hitch's DIAL M FOR 
MURDER, though instead of black humor and a decent plot, we have the 
Ice-Cold Rich Couple standby, visible plot twists and an utter lack of 
any protagonist to sympathize with.
        Douglas, officially entering his old fart years, plays Steven 
Taylor (the lead singer of Aerosmith). He's a filthy rich investor who, 
we learn at the beginning, may be in some financial trouble. It's all 
good, though, because he's married to Gwenyth Paltrow, in her 
twentieth movie role of 1998. She's getting retribution for her cheated-
on character in SLIDING DOORS by having an affair with sexy artist 
Viggo Moortensen who, if he's not rich, at least isn't old enough to be 
her dad.
        a) Gwenyth works as a translator for the United Nations, 
therefore she must be intelligent and classy and, therefore, she can 
bond with anyone who speaks another language. This will be utilized 
with no subtlety when we discover her best friend is Spanish and the 
police detective is some kind of east European.
        b) Douglas is even creepier here than his Gordon Gekko 
character in WALL STREET, always giving people phony, pseudo-
charming one-liners while something sinister brews just beneath the 
surface. We're supposed to realize gradually that he's evil, but it's 
obvious right off the bat.
        c) Moortensen is also a total creep, albeit of the sleazy, petty 
variety. He's more or less the kind of guy who would sell out his 
grandma for a double cheeseburger, a contrast to Douglas' 
sophisticated facade. Either way, it proves Gwenyth is always attracted 
to losers (HOW long was she shacked up with Brad Pitt?).
        I'll hit the highlights of the first hour -- Gwenyth tells 
Moortensen to meet her at a party, not thinking Douglas will be able to 
make it. But he does, and the two men meet. The movie keeps us 
guessing (ha-ha) about whether Douglas knows of the affair, as he 
arranges to meet Moortensen to look at his art, then comes up to his 
loft and toys with him like cat and mouse, etc. And Moortensen 
notices Gwenyth left her wedding ring lying out, which I'm sure is 
symbolic of the value of the marriage. Whatever.
        Douglas reveals his knowledge of the affair in his charming / 
sophisticated / creepy way, then offers him $500,000 to kill her, 
threatening to blackmail him if he doesn't do it. You see, Moortensen 
isn't really a starving artist, he's a starving gigolo who romances 
women for their money, and Gwenyth is sitting on a $100 million trust 
fund from her family. As classy and creepy (read: Hitchcockian) as 
this movie is supposed to be, the motives all come down to money.
        The plot in a movie like this dictates the "perfect murder" 
will be far from perfect, botched in such a way that the three lead 
characters are still around to screw with each other's heads. Some of it 
is interesting and absorbing, but more often than not, it's an exercise 
in tedium. A PERFECT MURDER isn't much of a resume booster for 
Douglas or Paltrow, or director Andrew Davis, who brought us THE 
FUGITIVE in 1993. It illustrates the principle, if you're going to do a 
remake, at least do a good one.

        Perhaps I should preface this review by stating, for the record,
that I happen to love Michael Douglas.
        Well, I'm not *in* love with him.  Gwyneth Paltrow is in love with
him.  Well, not Gwyneth Paltrow exactly, but the character she plays in her
latest film, one Emily Bradford.  Well, she *was* in love with him,
presumably at some point (not Michael Douglas per se, but the character he
plays, Emily's husband Steven Taylor).  But now Emily, as the movie opens,
is in love with Viggo Mortensen.  Well, the character *he* plays that is,
emerging--and chronically handsome--artist David Shaw.
        So here we have a problem.  Emily's married to Steven but she's in
love with David.  Steven, who knows it, is set to inherit a tidy sum if his
wife, er, expires.  Hmm...  How are we going to rectify this situation?
Well how about a juicy little murder for starters?
        Yes.  That would certainly resolve a thing or two.  And it's
certainly the least we can expect from a movie called "A Perfect Murder,"
loosely based on Alfred Hitchcock's "Dial M for Murder."
        In Hitch's 1953 film, Ray Milland schemes to knock off his lovely
wife (played by the even lovelier Grace Kelly) in order to bolster his
flagging bank balance.  His cause is also "justified" by the fact that his
wife is guilty of cheating on him.
        In this '90's update, Michael Douglas has similar designs on
Gwyneth Paltrow's cashflow, even though he's filthy rich himself (Douglas
plays yet another one of his classic "greed is good"
banker-broker-commodities-trader-dealer-investor types.  It's a role
Douglas could play in his sleep ... and probably does!  Emily's passionate
trysts with the afore-mentioned David provide Steven with similar
"justification" for orchestrating her timely demise.
        The twist?  Steven entertains his wife's lover and makes him an
offer he can't refuse: $500,000 tax free.  "For just walking away from
her?" asks the painter with, it turns out, a scurrilous past (handy for
blackmailing purposes).  "I said tax free, I didn't say free.  You get
$100,000 now and $400,000 later."  "For what?"  "Killing my wife."  Well,
we've all seen the previews...
        OK, so it's not the most pleasant proposition on the planet but the
way Douglas says "my wife" is totally delicious.  I mean, I bet he's said
it a million times before in a million different movies but it's the sort
of phrase you want to record on a dictaphone and play back to yourself over
and over.  "My wife."  It's got that mean, menacing, rasping quality that
gives you the shivers.  Damn, that Michael Douglas is good!
        "A Perfect Murder" is a slick, smart, sexy, and satisfying thriller
from director Andrew Davis ("The Fugitive").  The film is well
cast--everyone and everything is gorgeous looking--and it doesn't insult
the intelligence like some other hack psychodramas.  There are the
requisite twists and turns and the murder weapon--a pair of scissors in the
original--is tastefully inspired, if a little too telegraphed, this time
out (causing this reviewer to mutter under his breath "he's done!").
        Davis' film is less than perfect--the ending briefly descends into
slasher flick-dom for one thing--but it's a murderously fun way to spend a
couple of hours in a darkened movie theater with or, preferably, without
"my wife."

Before the remake of Psycho appears, we've got to suffer through this remake
of an earlier Hitchcock film, Dial M For Murder. As usual, Hollywood has
filled it with glitz and big name stars, and it all amounts to a loud
sounding nothing. The film opens with Emily  (Paltrow) and David (Viggo
Mortensen) 'having fun' in an loft apartment. The problem is, Paltrow is
married to Stephen (Douglas), who is not too happy when he discovers this
affair. If I was Paltrow, though, I'd definitely go with Mortensen. Less
wrinkles. Anyhow, Stephen approaches David with an interesting proposition:
he'll pay him to kill his lovely wife. Mortensen agrees, but the murder goes
awry, and the twists keep on coming as the film progresses.
Unfortunately, the film dosen't progress very fast. In fact, it moves like a
tortoise with arthritis (read: very, very s-l-o-w.) The plot moves nowhere
fast, and only becomes exciting in very short bursts. Not too good for a
'thriller.' Also, the performances, apart from Douglas, are below par.
Paltrow, showing immense talent in Se7en (1995) and Sliding Doors (1997) is
strangely stilted, even unconvincing, in this movie. Mortensen is a little
bit better, coming across as a younger Douglas, but his role isn't meaty
enough to show all his talent. Which leaves Douglas to waltz away with the
film, which is does. However, I doubt Douglas finds it very hard to play a
stogie smoking, drinking womanizer with a creepy underside. Also popping up
in the film is David Suchet, playing a shifty looking detective. Again, it's
not a character we're seeing on the screen, it's David Suchet.
The director, who bought us The Fugitive, piles on all the flash techniques,
such as zoom-in's, quick cuts, etc. The lighting is also interesting.
However, looks can't save this film from the depths of mediocre, and the
film seemed to work better in a single set anyway. The screenplay is O.K,
but there's some hackneyed sub-plot about Douglas being a ruthless player on
Wall Street (again) and the ending is surprisingly stupid and cliched. The
characters also make incredibly dumb moves, especially Paltrow, and Stephen
appears to lose all intelligence in the last reel.
With a combination of no tension, drama, or decent characters, A Perfect
Murder is a failure all round, and an incredible disappointment. There are a
few bright moments, but they are far and few between. The last thing a
thriller should be is boring, and although the film just barely manages to
keep your interest thanks to Michael Douglas, you wouldn't be missing
anything if you decided not to watch A Perfect Murder.

        "A Perfect Murder" is a great thrill for
weekend get-together nights.  It's got
everything a suspense thriller needs: suspense
(duh), atmosphere, and *believable*
characters.  Michael Douglas seems apt at
playing lonely millionaires, and Gwyneth
Paltrow once again masters the role of the
vulnerable wife.  One thing I found interesting
about this movie is that it's not really a
"whodunnit" in the sense that we know from
the start who the murderer is.  It's the why
and how that keeps us on the edge of our
seats.  Throughout the movie there's an
atmosphere of loneliness and perverted
sentiments that works really well in the plot.
The bathing scene reminded me of "Psycho,"
and I thought it was a nice touch at the end
with Paltrow's character (and us)
experiencing a sense of deja vu when we
revisit the apartment.  Towards the end,
however, it's clear what the only menacing
factor is that's left, so the only excitement
left for us is seeing how the couple will
resolve their, ah, differences.   Even though "A
Perfect Murder" lacks in some creativity, it
dots the I's and crosses the T's at what it's
trying to do, and does it well.
Rating:  B- (First viewing, 10/29/98)

Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.
     You'll be seeing ads for A PERFECT MURDER trumpeting "from the
director of THE FUGITIVE," which should set off a few alarms.  If you're
inclined to do the math, you'll note that THE FUGITIVE came out five years
ago, and you might reasonably wonder what Mr. Davis has been up to in the
interrim.  The answer is two films Warner Bros. is hoping everyone has
long forgotten:  the bloated, laughless caper comedy STEAL BIG, STEAL
LITTLE and the bloated, lifeless action film CHAIN REACTION.  Those films
too were advertised as "from the director of THE FUGITIVE," only the
director of THE FUGITIVE never showed up.  Could Davis finally display the
film-making skill which once held viewers on the edge of their seats, but
seems to have been in hibernation for half a decade?
     I'm pleased to note that Davis directs A PERFECT MURDER with much
more of the style and savvy which characterized THE FUGITIVE.  Too bad the
script is such a mess.  The film is based on Frederick Knott's play "Dial
M for Murder," previously made in 1954 by a fellow named Hitchcock.  This
version casts Michael Douglas as Steven Taylor, a wealthy New York
commodities broker with a lovely young wife named Emily (Gwyneth Paltrow).
Though she's a highly-educated diplomat with the United Nations, Emily is
treated like a trophy by Steven, leading her to seek fulfillment in an
affair with starving artist David Shaw (Viggo Mortensen).  Unfortunately,
Steven learns of the affair, and has the natural husband's reaction of
wanting to kill somebody.  His approach, however, is somewhat unusual:  he
offers David half a million dollars to kill Emily.
     Thus begin the expected twists, turns and double-deals, with the
three main characters regularly exchanging the upper hand.  All three
roles are well-cast and well-played -- Paltrow as the smart but vulnerable
ingenue, Mortensen as the sexy but dangerous "other man," and Douglas as
the calculating, morally shady businessman in the manner he should have a
patent on by now.  Douglas in particular gives the material a welcome
edge, pitching tart dialogue with a superior sneer and making it supremely
satisfying to watch his plans go awry.  Davis' production team, including
production designer Philip Rosenberg and cinematographer Dariusz Wolski,
creates an appropriately gothic atmosphere to complement tautly-directed
individual sequences.  All these elements are crafted by Davis into a
satisfying package likely to keep you intrigued as long as your watching.
     Watch out for the drive home, though, when the whole thing may fall
apart in your head so fast you'll lose sight of the road.  On the one
hand, A PERFECT MURDER contains as many metaphorically unfired guns as any
film in the history of post-Chekhovian drama.  Why doesn't it matter that
Emily is multi-lingual?  Why is one character left conspicuously
wounded-but-not-necessarily-dead, never to appear again?  Why does a
sharp-witted homicide detective (the talented David Suchet, in a magnetic
but under-used performance) play virtually no role in the investigation?
On the other hand, it underlines some of its key plot points so blatantly
(INSERT LINGERING CLOSE-UP OF MEAT THERMOMETER HERE) that it's more than
vaguely insulting, then drops key clues into the narrative from out of
nowhere.  Add to that a story which dumps intellectual gamesmanship for
struggles over a gun, and it's no wonder the film went back before the
cameras for 11th-hour re-shoots of its final scenes.  Writer Patrick Smith
Kelly makes a lot of changes from DIAL M FOR MURDER, but he doesn't make
much sense.
     I suppose it's a credit to how much Davis does right that A PERFECT
MURDER still pushes plenty of the right buttons until the anti-climactic
climax.  If a director is lucky, he gets a good script he can make even
better with stylistic choices.  On other occasions, the best he can do is
apply makeup to all the blemishes.  Between the film's mood and its solid
performances, A PERFECT MURDER is about as strong a film as you can make
from such feeble material.  It may not be redemption for "the director of
THE FUGITIVE," but it sure is a step in the right direction.

REVIEW: A Perfect Murder
By Luke Buckmaster (bucky@alphalink.com.au)
Cast: Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow, Viggo Mortensen, David Suchet,
Sarita Choudhury
Director: Andrew Davis
Screenplay: Patrick Smith Kelly based on the play "Dial M for Murder" by
Frederick Knott
Australian theatrical release: October 15
In A Perfect Murder, a loose remake of Alfred Hitchcock's Dial M for
Murder, Michael Douglas reprises a similar role to that of Nicholas Van
Orton in The Game.  He plays Steven Taylor, a wealthy and wise middle
aged man.  He's the kind of guy who says the right thing and the right
time, but plans his actions so meticulously and carefully that there is
bound to be a screw loose somewhere along the line.
Allegations have sparked over director Andrew Davis' work in this piece.
"Hitchcock's work should not be ripped off," the wags scoff, unaware
that Hitchcock himself adapted the screenplay from the original play
written by Frederick Knott.  Smartly, Davis attempts to use as much
Hictchcockness as any person other than Hitchcock could hitch.  There
are a small group of directors who can create similar feels of tension
and suspense that the great man seemed to achieve so easily, one of
which is definitely David Fincher, the mastermind behind Se7en and The
Game.  Australian Craig Monahan has also shown distinct skills for
unraveling a mystery in the grueling The Interview.  Sadly, Davis is not
one of them.  His direction is inconsistent and often unclear; at some
moments it's a little overpowering, others too passive.
Emily Hayes (Gwyneth Paltrow) is having an affair with starving artist
David Shaw (Viggo Mortensen).  Her husband, Steven, is not too happy
about the situation, and - for one reason or another - carefully hatches
a plot to kill her.  He hires David to do the deed, giving him explicit
instructions as to how to pull it off without incriminating anyone.
Surprise surprise, things go wrong
Michael Douglas is always interesting to watch.  What is even more
interesting is his bizarre choice of films, of which many of them seem
to have a woman-hating theme.  Take Fatal Attraction, Basic Instinct and
Disclosure for example, three of his best known films.  But it was The
Game which highlighted how impressionable an actor he can be, and he
must have enjoyed the experience because he now performs in a role
which, as I mentioned, is identical in many ways.  The only reason why
his performance in this film does not reach the same level (or actually,
lands well below the previous level) is the messy screenplay, which
misses out on the subtleties of his character.
That's a pity, since Patrick Smith Kelly has adapted Knott's play with
as much sophistication and puzzlement as he could possibly cram in. The
first half of A Perfect Murder is quite pleasing, as it introduces the
murder scheme with well-planned tautness and builds a genuinely
interesting scenario.  The real problems lie in the second half, when
the murder, planned murder or failed murder - which one, you can find
out yourself - has came and gone.  Thus the film takes one step forward
and two steps back, making some characters discover what we already
know, and others stand around and wait to mutter threatening lines of
dialogue.  In no time, everything seems a little silly.
For a film that really isn't too bad, A Perfect Murder is far from
rewarding.  It's the confused and faintly ridiculous conclusion to this
piece that will disappoint most viewers, as it is comprised of violence
and brutality - something that the film carefully avoids beforehand.
Although Davis is definitely not the 90's equivalence of Alfred
Hitchcock, he still succeeds with creating an intriguing mystery, if
only for a few sparse moments.

Andrew Davis directs this update of Frederick Knott's suspense play,
Dial M For Murder, previously made into a masterful Alfred Hitchcock
thriller. This time around, the technology and sensibilities have been
updated, but the key story remains exciting and suspenseful.
Michael Douglas plays Steven Hayes, a junk bond investor whose world is
collapsing.  His company is under investigation, his finances are shot,
and he recently discovered his wife is having an affair.
Emily (Gwyneth Paltrow), his rich wife, has been frequenting the company
of starving artist David Shaw (Viggo Mortensen).  Steven develops a
carefully constructed plan which could solve all his difficulties.  He
will hire a man to kill his wife, the he can use her trust fund money to
fix his monetary problems.
Fans of the Hitchcock movie, and the original play, will probably
already notice some differences.  The setup of the movie is roughly the
same, but, though a key piece of concluding evidence is the same, the
last half of the film is different in all but tone.
Although it is not a stretch, Michael Douglas fits his role perfectly.
Though it is nice to see him stretch now and then, and he can play the
modern rich white male in his sleep, he does such a good job at it that
he's fun just to watch.  His character here, as in Dial M for Murder, is
a planner.  We get to learn his meticulously crafted perfect murder
plan, then watch as he rapidly adjusts when things begin to go awry.
Michael plays his role in such a way that you hate and cheer for him at
the same time.
Gwyneth Paltrow has a beefier part here than Grace Kelly did in Dial M
for Murder, and she manages to do an admirable job with it.  Though not
without sin, she is the most sympathetic of the major three characters.
And even if she does make a few big leaps of logic here and there in the
film, she maintains credibility throughout.
As the third vertex of the triangle, Viggo Mortensen also has a bigger
role than before.  Of the three main cast members, he is the weakest,
and his motives are never 100% clear.  But, he does serve to add a
little extra mystery to the plot.
And the plot here is strong (what a welcome change).  The additions made
to A Perfect Murder enhance the violence of Dial M for Murder, but
maintain the same atmosphere.
The end result is about as good as you could hope for in a remake of a
Hitchcock classic.  It has some rough edges here and there which could
have used the master's touch, but, for the most part, A Perfect Murder
is an exciting and truly suspenseful thriller.

Release Date: June 5, 1998
Starring: Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow, Viggo Mortensen, David
Suchet, Sarita Choudhury
Directed by: Andrew Davis
Distributed by: Warner Brothers
MPAA Rating: R (violence, sexuality, language)

The suspense genre, which has been decidedly absent of quality movies
since last year's THE GAME, comes back to life here in a thrilling
recreation of Alfred Hitchcock's DIAL M FOR MURDER. It is to some degree
of wonder that Michael Douglas, who had the lead role in the 1997
thriller, comes back to command the genre again. Whether it's his
involvement, or the able direction of Andrew Davis (THE FUGITIVE),
there's a lot about A PERFECT MURDER that goes right, making this movie
a top-of-the-line suspense thriller. 
Michael Douglas is once again a successful businessman, this time named
Steven Taylor. He's got a trophy wife, Emily Bradford (Gwyneth Paltrow,
Great Expectations), who works for the United Nations. Unfortunately for
Steven, though, Emily has an artist lover named David Shaw (Viggo
Mortensen, G.I. Jane). Once Steven finds out, though, it's no big deal -
under the guise of looking to buy some art pieces, he travels to David's
downtown loft and confronts him about it. Ultimately, he makes David -
an almost penniless man - an offer he can't refuse: five hundred
thousand dollars to kill his wife. 
The movie takes off from there as an intense character battle between
three different characters. Steven, icily intense and incredibly wild,
is easily the best of the three, done by Michael Douglas in outstanding
fashion. David and Emily both pale in comparison, although David is
slightly better simply for the devil-may-care attitude that Viggo
Mortensen brings to him. Finally, Gwyneth Paltrow does the least amount
of truly suspenseful acting; her character is left to walk around like a
doe in a shooting gallery. What makes the conflict even more exciting is
the fact that both Steven and Emily also have financial gains to make:
Steven's a lucrative businessman, so obviously he's loaded, and Emily
has one hundred million dollars in inheritance that lands in the lap of
whatever man she dies while married to. As Sarita Choudhury (playing
Raquel, Emily's friend) says in the movie, "Money is the oldest reason
in the world to kill someone." 
The music is also in fine form here, scored by James Newton Howard. It
picks up and moves to a crescendo to emphasize character emotions, and
in general increases the suspense level by several notches. This is more
than adaquate proof of Andrew Davis' skill at directing a suspense film;
but also of note are the way he combines the script with cinematography
to provide a sensationally tense atmosphere. A PERFECT MURDER may not
fare well in the box office against more flamboyant summer films, but it
is a truly enjoyable film throughout and a definite must-see. Suspense
fans, this one's for you.
FINAL AWARD FOR "A PERFECT MURDER": 3.0 stars - a good movie.

 A Perfect Murder is about the unhappy marrige of Steven Taylor (Michael
Douglas) to filthy rich Emily Bradford Taylor (Gwyneth Paltrow).  Steven's
business will be wiped out soon, leaving Steven broke.  Emily is secretly
sleeping with a wannabe artist (Viggo Mortensen) on the side.
 All of this leads to a murder, but I will not tell who does it and who ends up
laying in a pool of blood on a kitchen floor.
 Based on the play Dial M for Murder, which was adapted by Alfred Hitchcock
into one of his lesser movies, Perfect Murder is crisp, stylish, seductive, and
oozing with suspensful surprises.  I would rank it as one of 1990's most
accomplished thrillers, next to Silence of the Lambs (1990) and Copycat (1995).
 The film is far more involving than Douglas's Fatal Attraction (1987) and
Basic Instinct (1992), but just as good, if not more so still, than 1997's The
Game. 
 It's beautifully shot and directed by Andrew Davis (The Fugitive).  I
recommend the DVD, for it features the alternative ending and history of the
original play.

It's not always a smart move to update a classic.  I tremble at the
thought that some very talented people are possibly throwing their
careers away in updating _Psycho_ for the 90's.  I get angry at those
individuals of the moviegoing public who refuse to see a film that is
older than they are;  I am further upset at those studios who cater to
such individuals, bastardizing a classic in the process.
That said, it has been years since I have seen _Dial M for Murder_,
which, I assume, is to my advantage here.  _A Perfect Murder_, a stylish
remake, works on the merits of its casting, its direction, and it's
post-_Pulp Fiction_ noir attitude.  If nothing else.
Michael Douglas is perfect as Steven Taylor, a courteous-on-the-outside,
devious-on-the-inside, commodities trader who faces possible bankruptcy.
He is married to Emily Brandford played by the attractive but glass-eyed
Gwyneth Paltrow.  While the age difference is great, that only serves to
undercut the tension in their marriage.  She opts to pursue an
extra-marital affair with David Shaw, played with special oiliness by
Viggo Mortensen.
Taylor catches wind of the affair, and approaches Shaw--not to kill him,
but to offer him a deal: kill his wife, and he will get substantial
money and be spared from having his skewered past revealed.  (Taylor
needs the money from his wife's estate to pay off serious debts).  It's
a good setup, and one of the better script twists not offered in the
original.
I will not reveal the rest of the plot, only to say that there are more
twists where that came from.  What I liked (and didn't like) about this
film is that nearly every character is shady and devious, including
Paltrow's.  I appreciated the noir-ish shadings of the characters, but I
also stayed emotionally distant.  The only character whom I rooted for
was that of the detective, played by David Suchet.  But his character
seemed more like window dressing than a hero.
Andrew Davis has rebounded, if only slightly, from the nadir of _Chain
Reaction_ and _Steal Big, Steal Little_.  But he is clearly not at the
level he once was, the heights of _The Fugitive_ and _Under Siege_.
Don't get me wrong.  I liked _A Perfect Murder_; I was entertained.  I
can only speculate whether I would like it so much had the original not
been as distant a memory.

The murder may be perfect, but Andrew Davis's loose update of Alfred
Hitchcock's 1954 classic _Dial_M_for_Murder_ is not even close.  Davis and
screenwriter Patrick Smith Kelly have come up with an interesting wrinkle
to Frederick Knott's original play: a wealthy industrialist (Michael
Douglas) wants to kill his adulterous heiress wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) for
the money, but in this version, the person he hires to do the job is the
lover himself (Viggo Mortensen).  Also, for the most part, Davis and Kelly
have successfully opened up the action of the original, which largely took
place on a single apartment set.
But, as is the case with too many remakes, the slick new take falls short.
 Generally speaking, Douglas, Paltrow, and Mortensen deliver passable
performances, but Douglas lacks the complexity of _Dial_M_'s Ray Milland;
he is a bit too one-note evil that it's hard to believe that anyone could
suspect anyone other than him (not helping are some obvious up-to-no-good
lines, such as this reply to Paltrow's request that a lunch date be
postponed until the next day: "What if there's no tomorrow?").
Nonetheless, Davis manages to generate some tension, yet this is squandered
by the uninspired finale, which bears the unmistakable fingerprints of
post-test screening retooling.  Watch closely, and you'll notice an
underscored detail that is not picked up on in the finale, much like how
the final, post-test version of _Fatal_Attraction_ lets a similar matter
dangle.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
More than adequately suspenseful, A Perfect Murder one-ups its
predecessor with a bigger and better cast and a boatload of twists and
turns.  Based on the Frederick Knott play, which spawned the Hitchcock
thriller Dial M' for Murder, the modernization is a glowing exception
of a remake surpassing its original in terms of sheer entertainment
value.
Michael Douglas (The Game) stars as Steven Taylor, a seemingly
successful New York businessman married to trophy wife, Emily (Paltrow,
Sliding Doors), a United Nations employee.  They live in a swank pad
overlooking Central Park, but that don't mean they're happy  he's is
secretly going broke and she's boffing an angry long-haired artist named
David Shaw (Mortensen, G.I. Jane).
Not being a dumb guy, Steven quickly finds out about the affair and
confronts David with a strange proposition  murder Emily for $500,000.
Why does Steven want his wife dead?  Turns out she's worth millions and
needs the cash to keep his business afloat.  Why would David kill the
fuck-bunny that he's been more than eager to use for a sperm
receptacle?  He's really a gold digger who has already been convicted
twice and faces the deadly `three strikes  you're out' law if charged
again.  In fear of being caught for his previous scam in Florida, David
agrees to take $100,000 up front and the balance on receipt of the dead
babe.
While Steven has the entire murder planned out, things quickly spin out
of control.  By the time you realize that something is afoul, it becomes
impossible to tell who's trying to con who into what.  I've seen the
original and I was on the edge of my seat.  OK  slumped down on the
edge of my seat.  But you get the point.
Douglas is wonderful as the savvy equal to Gordon Gecko, although he is
flawed in different ways and much angrier and much scarier (I think).
He's the only guy that I can think of that can win the support of the
audience by trying to kill his wife.  Paltrow is, well, nice eye-candy.
She's perfect as a leggy May to Douglas' December and even spends time
in a subway and elevator ala Sliding Doors.
The ugly duckling of the threesome is Viggo Mortensen, who's pretty boy
looks make him more of a candidate for Melrose Place than the big
screen.  His chin dimple is a huge distraction, rivaling only Harry
Hamlin in terms of size and depth.  I spent too much time trying to
think of funny things to jam in there  a tennis ball, a rubber chicken,
Sandy Duncan's glass eye.  In certain light, Mortensen strikes a
disturbing resemblance to Douglas.
The real heroes of the film are, as always, behind the scenes.
Cinematographer Dariusz Wolski (The Crow) keeps everything dark but
bathes the leads in a warm overhead light.  The score, composed by James
Newton Howard (E.R.), is both eerie and precarious, and the direction
(Andrew Davis, The Fugitive  no stranger to making really old guys look
good) adds a classy touch to the mix.
Yeah, it's not The Spanish Prisoner, but that's like comparing apples
and oranges.  Or maybe apples and orange Jello.

Starring Michael Douglas; Gwyneth Paltrow; Viggo Mortensen & David Suchet
Michael Douglas plays Steven Taylor, a rich financier who has a very young
wife. (Gwyneth Paltrow). Things are not going great in the marriage. This
may have something to do with the fact that she is having an affair with a
struggling artist (Viggo Mortensen). So Hubby decides to have his lovely
young wife murdered -- and he hires his wife's lover to do it. If that
doesn't interest you right there, I don't know what will. Douglas's
character has the murder planned to perfection. Except one little thing goes
wrong, his wife survives the murder attempt. Now her husband must cover his
tracks and avoid being caught.
A Perfect Murder is based on the stage play "Dial M For Murder" and is a
remake of the Alfred Hitchcock classic of the same name. This latest version
is certainly on of the most well written movies that you are likely to see
in the near future. I was amazed at the amount of thought that was put into
the story, particularly the amount of detail surrounding the murder plot.
The dialogue is also first rate, which is what you'd expect for a film of
this caliber.
It's one thing to have good writing, but you also need the acting to go with
it. Casting Michael Douglas in this film was the best thing they could have
done. He gives his usual stellar performance, and makes everyone around him
look that much better. That's not to say that Douglas's costars weren't
great. Quite the opposite, Gwyneth Paltrow and Viggo Mortensen did a
fantastic job in this film. In both cases though, they did not fail to give
their best performances in the film when they were doing a scene with
Michael Douglas.
Also worthy of mention is the overall look of this film. To say it was
stylish was an understatement. This is one good looking film. The obvious
attention to detail that was paid to the sets and overall feel of the film
is more than a match for the intricate plot line of this film.
A Perfect Murder is a film that makes you pay attention. Not because you
have to, but because you want to. This is a tribute to the fine storytelling
of this movie. It also makes A Perfect Murder a very good choice for your
next trip to the video store.

In times of crisis people are driven to desperate measures. Of course what
constitutes a crisis differs from person to person. What may be a disastrous
situation for one, may be seen as a challenge to another. As Deepak Chopra is
known to say, "It's not the ride, it's the rider." Unfortunately
clear-thinking is not always the reaction to problems.
Wall Street wheeler dealer Steven Taylor (Michael Douglas) is a man with
troubles. He's sunk his money in illegal financial activities and it's blown
up in his face. In a matter of days he will lose it all.
His wife Emily (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a highly-placed UN interpreter and is not
happy with her life either. Her marriage is cold and unfulfilling. Unknown to
her, her new lover David Shaw (Viggo Mortensen) is not only a painter, but an
ex-con with a history of bilking wealthy women of their money. Emily is a
prime target: she's worth over $100 million.
Steven's solution to his predicament is to offer David half a million to kill
his wife. The artist accepts and the movie is underway.
Drawing from Frederick Knott's play and loosely based on Hitchcock's Dial
M For Murder, this is all-too typical of summer releases. All style and no
substance. And there's really not much style. Director Andrew Davis (the
accomplished Witness and best-forgotten other films) has made exactly
the wrong choices at almost every turn.
Douglas and Paltrow have both shown us that they are skillful actors in
previous films. Mortensen showed promise in the past. Here all three are
walking uninterestingly through their roles with oddly waxen faces. The only
person who shows any sense of life is David Suchet as New York Detective
Mohamed Karaman. He's only on-screen long enough to make you think that there
might be a likable person in the film and then he disappears.
The first concern of a suspense film is to create suspense. Surprises are
important. In this movie the audience keeps waiting for something to happen.
And nothing ever does. Nearly every event is telegraphed in advance. Close-up
on this object or that action and it's easy to guess what's going to happen.
As the film plods towards its inevitable conclusion you keep expecting a plot
twist to make the movie worthwhile. It's a hopeless quest.
The story doesn't make much sense. Steven's wife is loaded. Even with
unfriendly relations, you'd think that he could have talked to her about his
difficulty rather than deciding to kill her. When he does decide on the dire
plan he makes an unreasonable choice. If you were going to hire someone to
kill your wife, would your first choice be her lover? No matter how sleazy he
is, I would think there might be a chance that he would turn down the
opportunity. Why would Steven plan the murder as a break-in in their
apartment? Why not just take her out as she was walking to David's loft in a
bad neighborhood?
While deciding among the numerous summer films, you might do well to skip
this one. You'll find more suspense than this movie offers by watching the
Weather Channel.

Whenever Steven Taylor (Michael Douglas), looks upon his wife, Emily
(Gwyneth Paltrow), there is an unmistakable aura of dislike hanging in
the air.  "That's not happiness to see me," they bitterly say to one
another.  It is a marriage that has degenerated into something hateful,
something wickedly cold.  Stephen, a detached SOB who is a power player
in the world of high finance, is currently facing a crisis.  His company
is under investigation for illegal transactions that not only threaten
him with legal action but also with impending bankruptcy.  Meanwhile,
Emily looks upon her union with Steven with equal disdain.  Wanting
love, she turns to an up and coming artist named David (Viggo Mortensen)
and has an affair with him, an affair that Steven eventually discovers.
Steven is an opportunist and is extremely clever.  He learns that David
has some dark secrets and a hidden agenda.  Using this information, he
propositions David with an offer to kill his wife.  With Emily dead,
David's secrets will remain safe and he will make off with a tidy sum as
compensation.  Meanwhile, Steven would inherit an absurd amount of money
which would allay his financial woes.  But when the plan falls through,
it becomes a psychological cat and mouse game as everybody begins to
question one another while at the same time they take steps to conceal
their true intentions.  A determined detective also arrives on the scene
to make matters even more tricky for everyone involved.  Soon, the movie
transforms into a sort of "who's playing who" kind of movie.
Unfortunately, this is the kind of story that reveals itself too early
in the film.  For the remaining 60 minutes, we see Douglas dodge in and
out of excuses, Mortensen looking for a way to get more money out of the
deal and Paltrow trying to figure out what's going on.  Two things,
however, really distracted me.  One was the fact that this movie never
gave us any surprises.  It seemed that some kind of revelation would
have pushed this movie up a notch, but this movie which is about secrets
didn't really have any for the audience.   I also objected to the
ending, which was a letdown considering how the story was developed on a
psychological level.  It could have ended on a eerie note where the
unhappy couple is left pondering about their lives as they look dryly
into one another's eyes.  But, it gives us a Hollywood-style ending
complete with flying vases, knockdowns and gunshots.  As stylish as the
film looked, I think that we deserved better.  
Yet, I can't discount the terrific performances that sustained the dark
mood of the movie.  Douglas is at the top of his form as the
cold-hearted, master-of-the-universe husband and Paltrow is likable as a
woman in search of love and truth.  Mortensen shows that his character
is equally adept at playing the blackmail game, and the best piece of
casting is the detective (David Suchet) that investigates the case.  I
have my reservations about "A Perfect Murder," but it's a good-looking
thriller nonetheless that offers a lot of promise, even though it
ultimately can't quite deliver.  Though far from perfect, a marginal
recommendation would not constitute a crime.
