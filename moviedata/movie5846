PLANET SICK-BOY:   http://www.sick-boy.com
Here's a way to tell if a movie is really bad:  Take a peek at your
watch when the credits start to roll.  If it's exactly 90 minutes from
the time the lights went down, odds are you just suffered through a real
stinker.  Why?  Because the director probably delivered a 120-minute
opus to the studio, who immediately recognized it for the piece of dung
that it was, slapped the director silly and hacked it down to a
viewer-friendly run time.  Another way to tell is if somebody sitting
next to you keeps saying, `My, God.  I wish I was dead!'  That's how the
person sitting next to me was tipped off to the fact that it blew.
Riding the wave of the retro fad, the popular 70s television series
bullies its way into theaters with a lethal blend of bad acting,
scripting and directing.  In case you're too young to remember the show,
it was about three teen delinquents who, for some reason, became
undercover cops that fought both crime and fashion ideologies.  There's
Linc (Omar Epps, Higher Learning), a former arsonist that seems more
concerned with his ride than anything else.  There's Julie (Claire
Danes, My So-Called Life), a recovering alcoholic convicted of assault.
And there's Pete (Giovanni Ribisi, The Other Sister), a dimwitted
burglar and spawn of the hostile suburbs.  Three fenceposts could have
been more effective.  Did I mention that they weren't allowed to carry
guns?  That's right  an action movie nearly devoid of delicious
gunplay.  That's sort of like drinking a can of Coke that's been open
for three months.
There are two scenes that I particularly enjoyed.  One occurred when the
three idiots were working undercover in a sex club.  Communicating only
with a series of secret winks and hand gestures, they delve deeply into
their undercover identities, being careful to make sure that nobody
believes either that they're cops or that they know each other.  Then
they all go home in the same car.  In another dazzling display, Linc has
to don a disguise to go incognito when on the run from some crooked
detectives, so he puts on a hat.  A hat.  That's his disguise.
The Mod Squad is sort of like The Brady Bunch movies  everyone else
dresses and acts like they're living in the present day, but the stars
dress like disco is still king.  They use hip lingo like `solid' and
`right on,' and whenever something really exciting happens  and believe
me, these moments are few and far between  the music awkwardly shifts
from 90s modern rock to 70s deep funk.  You know, Shaft stuff.  The
film has the look of a Levi's button-fly loose-fitting wide-legged
baggy-crotch jeans commercial  all edgy and alternative.  And if you
can't get enough of Giovanni Ribisi playing that semi-retarded role
(like Friends), then this is the picture for you.  The rest of you
should just stay away.

THE MOD SQUAD (M).  
(MGM/UIP)
Director: Scott Silver
Stars: Claire Danes, Giovanni Ribisi, Omar Epps, Dennis Farina, Josh 
Brolin, Michael Lerner, Steve Harris, Richard Jenkins.
Another old tv series is revisited and updated for the '90's.
However, this lacklustre big screen version of The Mod Squad, which
originally ran from 1968 to 1973, joins other dud adaptations such as
The Beverly Hillbillies, Lost In Space and the recent My Favourite
Martian.
The original series centred around a squad of delinquent
teenagers put back onto the streets by a tough but sympathetic cop,
who used them to infiltrate seedy bars and clubs and street gangs in
an effort to fight crime.  This big screen version takes the same
premise, but basically trashes it with a formulaic and unoriginal plot
that involves crooked cops and illicit drug deals.
This '90's version also loses the rebellious
anti-establishment undercurrents that were prevalent in the '60's and
'70's, and which gave the series an unusual edge.  This new look Mod
Squad is little more than an average television movie, and is unlikely
to appeal to the same audiences that remember the similarly themed 21
Jump Street with more affection.  The script is trite and predictable,
the dialogue terribly clichéd and the characters one dimensional.
Scott Silver's direction is pedestrian.
The three stars lack rapport, and their performances are
uncomfortable, flat and uncharismatic.  Claire Danes does the best she
can with the undemanding role of Julie Barnes, the street wise former
drug addict.  Giovanni Ribisi (from The Other Sister, Saving Private
Ryan, etc) brings an intensity to his performance as Pete Cochrane,
the rich kid turned bad, that seems misplaced given the almost comic
book quality of the material.  Omar Epps (from Higher Learning, etc)
gives his Linc Hayes all the life and energy of a lump of wood.
Veteran Dennis Farina is wasted as the squad's mentor Adam Greer,
whose murder kick-starts the plot.
The ending conveniently leaves the way open for a sequel.
However, if prolific producer Aaron Spelling was hoping to turn The
Mod Squad into a successful new movie series he has sadly under
estimated the intelligence of the audience and over estimated the
quality of the banal script.

Claire Danes, Giovanni Ribisi, and Omar Epps make a likable trio of
protagonists, but they're just about the only palatable element of The
Mod Squad, a lame-brained big-screen version of the 70s TV show.  The
story has all the originality of a block of wood (well, it would if you
could decipher it), the characters are all blank slates, and Scott
Silver's perfunctory action sequences are as cliched as they come.  By
sheer force of talent, the three actors wring marginal enjoyment from
the proceedings whenever they're on screen, but The Mod Squad is just a
second-rate action picture with a first-rate cast.

Susan Granger's review of 'THE MOD SQUAD" (MGM)
       Let's face it..."The Mod Squad" wasn't that cool when it was on
ABC television 30 years ago (Sept.'68 to August '73) and it certainly
hasn't improved with age. If anything, it's deteriorated - and today's
teenagers, who are the target audience, weren't even alive when the
series aired. For those who don't remember, "The Mod Squad" were
juvenile delinquents - Peggy Lipton, Michael Cole, and Clarence
Williams 3rd - who plea-bargained their way out of custody by agreeing
to work with The Man fighting crime undercover. It was a
counter-culture thing that appealed to the late '60s, early '70s
mentality.  This time 'round Claire Danes, Giovanni Ribisi, and Omar
Epps are the teenagers who are enlisted to work as undercover police
operatives, reporting to gruff but kindly Dennis Farina.  The plot -
and I use that word loosely - revolves around a cache of drugs that
disappears from a police evidence locker. "The Mod Squad" is supposed
to find it. "I'm getting too old for this," they moan, just as they
did on the TV series, but it's a line that's far more believable when
muttered by Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in one of the many "Lethal
Weapon" sequels. Basically, the dialogue is drivel. Written by Stephen
Kay, Kate Lanier and Scott Silver, and directed by Mr. Silver, this
film has nothing, absolutely nothing to recommend it except that it's
short, so you only waste 94 minutes of your time. So, on the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The Mod Squad" is a thudding 1. It's the Clod
Squad. There is no excuse for a movie being quite this lame and
stupid.

Directed by Scott Silver.
Cast: Claire Danes, Giovanni Ribisi, Omar Epps, Josh Brolin, Dennis 
Farina, Michael Lerner, Steve Harris, Mariah O'Brien.
1999 - 94 minutes
Rated R (for violence, profanity, partial nudity, and sexual 
situations).
Reviewed March 27, 1999.
One of the problems with "The Mod Squad," otherwise known as a cool, or 
"hip" group of people, is that the three main characters never earn that 
sleek, exclusive title. Oh, sure, they make think they're cool, but 
there is never any evidence that they actually are, and when one minor 
character asks them at the end, "what do you all think you are? Some 
sort of mod squad or something?," it felt contrived and phony, a 
desperate attempt to make some sort of revelance come from the name.
Based on the cult Aaron Spelling crime-drama series that ran from 
1968-1973, the show and film's premise is simple enough: three troubled 
youths, recovered drug addict Julie Barnes (Claire Danes), ex-arsonist 
Linc (Omar Epps), and goofy robber Pete Cochran (Giovanni Ribisi), agree 
to help out the San Francisco police and become undercover cops (minus 
any sort of weapons) in place of serving time in jail. You'd think the 
work would be a sort of community service but I guess not, since the 
three young adults are obviously paid enough to own their own 
apartments. Anyway, getting back to the story at hand, the three are 
assigned by their superior, Capt. Adam Greer (Dennis Farina), to scope 
out a night club that may or may not be involved in a prostitution ring. 
Soon, Greer has been murdered, and thinking that they may be blamed for 
the crime, Julie, Linc, and Pete set out to find the real culprits.
"The Mod Squad" is such a terminally thin, virtually motionless action 
film that it is only luck it contains many things surrounding the 
convoluted plotline that actually are worthwhile. Claire Danes, a 
wonderful actress who began her acting career with the best television 
drama of the '90s, "My So-Called Life," which met a premature burial but 
can still be found on MTV and home video, has appeared in several 
feature films since then, but none have been able to rise to her 
ability. Although beautiful and obtaining a hard-edged amiableness in 
many of her roles, judging from her latest picture, she should try and 
choose her projects better. Giovanni Ribisi, also a talented actor (just 
watch 1998's indie "First Love, Last Rites," and the recent "The Other 
Sister" if you don't believe me), I'm afraid is beginning to get 
typecast as the "silly" character used for comic relief. Here, that is 
exactly what Ribisi does, and it is the way he is instructed to act that 
began to grate on my nerves in the first half, although he was able to 
flesh out his character a little bit towards the end. Finally, Omar 
Epps, so very good in 1995's "Higher Learning," really doesn't have that 
much substantial material to work with, but still gives a respectable 
turn. Together, the three work fetchingly as a team, and this is the 
film's one saving grace, even if it still, unfortunately, isn't able to 
buoy the proceedings so that the film can be necessarily recommended. 
Some sort of pseudo-relationship arises near the end between Danes and 
Ribisi, but the movie never follows through with it, leaving the whole 
subplot to be a rather pointless waste of time. Aside from these three 
actors, the other characters mostly show up, read some lines, leave, and 
cash a paycheck. Michael Lerner should especially be embarrassed since 
he is given a ridiculous scene in which he forces Epps to dance with 
him. Huh? Where did that come from?
Even if "The Mod Squad" never proves to be what I would call stylish or 
cool, the funky music score, by BC Smith, definately is. Mixing '90s 
music with a groovy '70s-style score that often sounds suited for a 
blaxploitation movie, was a far more original and effective technical 
choice than anything else in the movie. One particular scene that jumped 
startlingly to life thanks solely to the music was a protracted 
comic-action sequence set at a carwash.
Meanwhile, the suspension of disbelief is tried many times throughout, 
with the apartment and Lerner-Epps dance sequence examples already 
given, as well as in the action finale in which Danes and Ribisi jump 
out of a car going at least 55mph onto the hard pavement, only to have 
Danes jump up and begin run as if nothing had just happened. Nevermind 
the fact that we had just gotten finished seeing her stunt double smash 
onto the road like a pancake. Also, one of the on-going jokes during the 
climax is the references to the "Lethal Weapon" series. "I feel like I 
should say we're getting too old for this s***," Pete says. "At least we 
aren't going to end up in some old, abandoned warehouse," Julie chimes 
in. And guess what? That is the exact place that they end up at! At once 
passingly clever, this sort of humor really doesn't work well in films, 
since it is both predictable and obviously a strain for original ideas.
During the running time of "The Mod Squad," I saw three promising young 
actors with a surprising amount of chemistry together, but nonetheless 
wasting their times; some entertaining music that fit the picture well; 
a few honest character scenes that made me yearn for more time to learn 
about the people; and a story that is as old as the hills, with all of 
the so-called "twists" being telegraphed far in advance, particularly in 
dealing with Julie's old boyfriend (Josh Brolin) who miraculously comes 
back into her life. For all of its virtues, "The Mod Squad" does not do 
justice to its "Mod" title. Basically, it really is just a cliched 
"Lethal Weapon"-ish action movie masquerading as something more.

As anyone who has read my last two reviews: short films that studios and
people alike have never heard of and are available for free download via the
internet, you can probably guess that I have it out against the current
regime of Hollywood movies, which, after seeing basically crap for about
four months, is beginning to make Communist Russia under Stalin seem like a
pretty friendly place.
    In case that hasn't tipped you off, my gripes about The Mod Squad, a
movie based on a late-sixties, early-seventies TV show that wasn't that
great to begin with, should probably clue you in.  I am not saying starring,
because anyone who would act in this film and consider themselves a star for
it is either a drunk or has an agent that's a drunk, probably the latter.  I
can forgive Giovanni Ribsi, on the account of the fact that he's acted in
good movies (unlike Epps and Danes, who rarely even get close to a good
role).  He's been in Gus Van Sant and he even does a good job among the
twentysomething shoot-the-actors while making them popular sitcom of
"Friends", where several good actors seem to go to work the bad acting out
of their system (i.e. Lisa Kudrow).  I maybe can forgive Dennis Farina, who
is at least killed off before the movie gets really bad.
    Being the eternal optomist that I am, I'll have to give you a few good
points.  For one, it has a really nice soundtrack.  For two, it's fun to
pick on.  The script is so bland and unoriginal that I will further
investigate my theory that major movie studios are experimenting on monkeys
turning out scripts for them, and anonymously email my evidence to the ACLU
and ASPCA for them to lobby and handle.
    The director tries to light his film like it's noir: half of it takes
place in a nightclub and it shows.  When I came out of the theatre my eyes
hurt from the light changing so much.  He also tries to act like he's
Richard Donner, taking all that could have been a good scene from the Lethal
Weapon saga.  I can forgive him for it to, after all, he directed the cheap
film Johns, and someone whose done something that bad doesn't need to be
kicked when he's down.
    Unfortunately, the movie doesn't show us the same courtesy.
    Basically, frame one is the movie's high point and it goes down from
there.  Watching this movie, I understand which the Mad Bomber placed his
bombs under the seats of movie theatres.  Claire Danes, Omar Epps, and
Giovanni Ribsi make up a mod squad (insult to our intelligence: both terms
are defined at the beginning of the film) of undercover cops under the
command of Dennis Farina.  They stumble upon a drug conspiracy with corrupt
cops (What movies was that?  Take your pick.).  They find love, shoot the
bad guys, and act cool (they wear Ray Bans on a cop's salary).  And in the
end, the world is safe for democracy and even more drug dealers.
    No one does a good job in the movie, no one makes the façade of cool
stand up.  Even the target audience won't enjoy this film.  Face it, it
sucks.
    The film tries to be funny.  It fails.  It tries to be cool.  It fails
at that, too.  It tries to be enjoyable.  Strike three, you're out.

   It is movies like these that make a jaded movie viewer thankful for
the invention of the Timex IndiGlo watch.
   Based on the late 1960's television show by the same name, The Mod
Squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the
police to go undercover. However, things go wrong as evidence gets
stolen and they are immediately under suspicion.  
   Of course, the ads make it seem like so much more. Quick cuts, cool
music, Claire Dane's nice hair and cute outfits, car chases, stuff
blowing up, and the like. Sounds like a cool movie, does it not? After
the first fifteen minutes, it quickly becomes apparent that it is not.
   The Mod Squad is certainly a slick looking production, complete with
nice hair and costumes, but that simply isn't enough. The film is best
described as a cross between an hour-long cop show and a music video,
both stretched out into the span of an hour and a half. And with it
comes every single cliché. It doesn't really matter that the film is
based on a television show, as most of the plot elements have been
recycled from everything we've already seen.
   The characters and acting is nothing spectacular, sometimes even
bordering on wooden. Claire Danes and Omar Epps deliver their lines as
if they are bored, which really transfers onto the audience. The only
one to escape relatively unscathed is Giovanni Ribisi, who plays the
resident crazy man, ultimately being the only thing worth watching.
Unfortunately, even he's not enough to save this convoluted mess, as all
the characters don't do much apart from occupying screen time. 
   With the young cast, cool clothes, nice hair, and hip soundtrack, it
appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset. Despite an
American 'R' rating (which the content does not justify), the film is
way too juvenile for the older mindset. Information on the characters is
literally spoon-fed to the audience (would it be that hard to show us
instead of telling us?), dialogue is poorly written, and the plot is
extremely predictable. The way the film progresses, you likely won't
even care if the heroes are in any jeopardy, because you'll know they
aren't.
   Basing the show on a 1960's television show that nobody remembers is
of questionable wisdom, especially when one considers the target
audience and the fact that the number of memorable films based on
television shows can be counted on one hand (even one that's missing a
finger or two). The number of times that I checked my watch (six) is a
clear indication that this film is not one of them. 
   It is clear that the film is nothing more than an attempt to cash in
on the teenage spending dollar, judging from the rash of really awful
teen-flicks that we've been seeing as of late. Avoid this film at all
costs.

The Hollywood creative rut of recycling old TV show reruns has finally
gotten deep enough to reach The Mod Squad.  A ridiculous show to start
with, should we be surprised that it has spawned an even more ridiculous
movie?
It seems that the qualifications to work as a cop are completely
optional.  At least that is what Detective Greer (Dennis Farnia) decides
when he recruits three young criminals to form an elite, though
weaponless, undercover squad...the Mod Squad.  Whose great idea was
this?!?  The film conveniently starts in media res, so we never get to
hear Greer's arguments for turning the justice system on its head.
In any event, the Squad is composed of Julie (Claire Danes), Linc (Omar
Epps) and Pete (Giovanni Ribisi), guilty respectively of assault, arson
and robbery.  Their mission in the movie is to infiltrate a high class
prostitution ring.  Oh, and to look cool while doing it.
But things quickly go wrong.  Soon, The Mod Squad are embroiled in a web
of murder, deceit, drug deals and police corruption.  Before you jump to
the conclusion that this sounds interesting, let me assure you that any
life and excitement that may have one time inhabited this plot has long
since fled the scene.
The Mod Squad's best attribute, nay, its only positive attribute, is its
sense of style, and even that is troublingly forced.  Shot with moody
colored lighting, and the occasional wild angle, The Mod Squad is less
of a film that an extended length music video...without the
entertainment factor.
There are a few good actors buried under the moldy plot and pointless
dialogue.  The film tries to give each of the Mod Members a poignant
scene or two.  Julie runs afoul of an old flame (Josh Brolin), Pete
tries to reconcile with his parents, and Linc...well, Linc really likes
his car.
But then, there's the plot.  Ugh...what a plot!  The whole thing relies
on the bad guys clearly stating their evil intentions in a loud enough
voice to make any James Bond villain proud.  I guess since policework is
this easy, it's no wonder any random criminal can be a cop.
And don't go to see The Mod Squad expecting any excitement.  The
characters themselves even remark how incredibly boring it is, sitting
around in cars.  And yet, nothing is ever done to liven things up.  Even
the few "action" scenes are dull and lifeless.
The Mod Squad is the type of film that is best enjoyed merely from
watching its commercials.  Subject yourself to this mindless movie in
quantities larger than 30 seconds, and you'll certainly regret it.

I have little against remakes and updates of older films and tv series. If
there's a will, there's a way; and I believe that anything, no matter how
great or revered can be effectively improved upon. This is the reason that I
responded so well to Gus Van Sant's universally panned update of Psycho; I
thought it to be not only an intriguing cinematic experience, but also very
on-par with an original. But I do have a big problem with remakes that are
blatantly bad. You see, the point of a remake is, or at least it should be,
to iron out the original's flaws and bring the work that much closer to
greatness or even perfection. But what if the source material on which the
remake is based isn't any good to begin with?
That is the only cinematic question pondered by the bland actioner The Mod
Squad. I've only seen a couple episodes of the late 60s tv series on which
it is based, and to be honest, I didn't like it all that much. It has a
concept that -- and still is -- interesting; a group of corrupt young
adults, all in their early 20s are given a choice: they either go to jail
for the various crimes that they all have committed, or they can become
undercover cops, helping the police get into places that they normally
wouldn't be able to access. Obviously, all 3 opt for the latter option and
become undercover policemen (and policewomen).
The three main characters here are played by Claire Danes, Omar Epps and
Giovanni Ribisi. Of the three, only Danes has a real character. Ribisi's
dumbass 20 year old is played exclusively for laughs; Epps' slightly more
intelligent one is used to create various chase scenes. When the squad's
superviser gets killed off and his reputation dirtied in death, the three of
them, sure that their beloved master was framed, go off and investigate on
their own, discovering corrupt cops, lots and lots of expensive whores and
very lucrative drug operations. All kinds of good stuff!
The only times that The Mod Squad comes even close to working is in its
comedic moments. Although Ribisi is a trite actor and his characters repeat
movie after movie, his man here is really rather amusing, when the script
gives him a chance. Epps' straight man is effectively played against
Ribisi's clueless spontaneity. But the rest of the film is dull, boring and
singularly uninteresting. A drug-op action plot is no longer anything new,
not even with teenage action heroes, and the way it's executed here, it's
also nowhere near exciting or suspenseful.
Claire Danes' character has potential, but it is buried under heaps of
cliches and her performance is too restrained. She could have been a
tour-de-force, but instead director Scott Silver puts shackles on her and
simply does not allow her to do anything really significant with her role.
Epps and Ribisi fare slightly better and do as well as can be expected,
although their characters aren't nearly as rich as Danes' could have been.
The Mod Squad is a mind-numbing marketing plot of a film, and teens will
jump all over it. It's full of bad dialogue, scenes and concepts that make
no sense and -- get this -- drug dealers that like to tango with other guys
in their spare time. Nothing is remotely intriguing or worth paying for.
Claire Danes is no longer alluring -- mainly because she's got a horrible
hairdo, so that draw is out. There are, however, cool explosions, guns and
chases which may lure a viewer into thinking that he or she is about to
experience an exciting thriller of some sort. Do not be fooled. Some may
call this escapist fare -- I call it escape-as-quickly-as-you-can fare.

It's clear Hollywood is scraping the bottom of the old TV barrel when
filmmakers start adapting things like "The Mod Squad," which left the
airwaves more than 25 years ago and has rarely been seen since. The
movie, which is louder, racier and more profane than the show ever
could have been, retains the concept of the serieswithout managing to
have much fun with it. This is a movie awash in dazzling trimmings but
devoid of ideas.
For awhile, "The Mod Squad" looks like it may get by on flash
alone. Director Scott Silver, cinematographer Ellen Kuras and editor
Dorian Harris use every possible film school trick (high-speed zooms,
time-lapse photography, arty out-of-focus shots, jump cuts, etc.) to
jump-start the film, and the images are backed up by a scorching
soundtrack mixing vintage R&B and new tunes by Lauryn Hill, Bjork and
Everlast. The score by BC Smith is ripe with the cheesy organs and
blaring horns of classic 1970s TV music.
But like last year's "The Avengers," "Mod Squad" eventually dissolves
into stylish chaos. It's as if the production team dressed up the
stage, lined up all the right people and then lost interest in the
project once the cameras started to roll.
The script, which vacillates between confusion and tedium, sets up
young troublemakers Julie (Claire Danes), Lincoln (Omar Epps) and Pete
(Giovanni Ribisi) as novice cops under the wing of Captain Greer
(Dennis Farina), who realizes the three can effectively infiltrate
places and organizations the boys in blue never could. When Greer
turns up dead, the trio realizes the force was against him, and they
scramble to uncover the corruption within the police department.
Perhaps because of the scattershot screenplay, the cast members
frequently seem to be at a loss as to how to play their roles. Danes'
performance as a recovering alcoholic and drug addict is not one of
her strongest, although she does come up with a convincingly grungy
look for Julie. Aside from occasionally glowering and looking
concerned, Epps has absolutely nothing to do.
Only the doughy, slack-jawed Ribisi ("The Other Sister," "Saving
Private Ryan") appears to have a solid grasp on his characterization
of Pete as a would-be fly guy who generally ends up looking like a
dweeb.
For a movie that seems to know exactly how silly it is - at one point,
Pete and Julie make "Scream"-style cracks about how the big finale had
better not take place in an abandoned warehouse - "The Mod Squad"
keeps a straight, sometimes even sullen face too much of the
time. Hopefully the promised/threatened film version of "Charlie's
Angels" won't make the same mistake.

There have been Merchant-Ivory costume dramas with more of a pulse than
"The Mod Squad," a self-consciously "hip" cinematic rendering of the old
TV series still looked upon fondly by so many baby-boomers. Well, said
"Squad" certainly won't be a pleasant viewing experience for them or
anybody else, maybe even the teen target audience the movie has been
geared towards. A contemporary take on this decidedly '70s show doesn't
exactly seem unwarranted, but one wonders if the mold it accumulated
while waiting on the shelf didn't transform into a full-blown case of
botulism.
How curious that the film begins by defining both mod and squad,
insisting that the latter is a group of people working together and then
contradicting this definition by keeping its titular trio apart for a
sizeable chunk of the running time. They are Julie, Pete and Linc,
reformed delinquents working undercover for the LAPD (exposition put out
of the way so fast that you're likely to be lost from the opening
moments on), and they are respectively played by Claire Danes, Giovanni
Ribisi and Omar Epps, talented actors each deserving of better than
this.
Their plight involves standard cop-corruption stuff, as our would-be
protagonists catch wind of an internal cover-up after their superior
(reliable Dennis Farina, one of the best things here and gone so
quickly) gets killed and framed for drug trafficking. They pout a lot
and eventually get cracking to expose this convoluted conspiracy using
surveillance tactics that would impress the Hardy boys and Linda Tripp
but few others. When you're supposed to be asking, "What's going to
happen next?", you'll instead entertain thoughts like "Who are these
people and why should I care?" or "Aren't thrillers supposed to contain
thrills?"
Not that Danes, Epps and Ribisi don't give it a shot. Danes can do the
troubled teen thing in her sleep, as evidenced by "My So-Called Life,"
but she's saddled with a mysterious-boyfriend (Josh Brolin) subplot so
see-through you begin to seriously question her so-called intelligence.
Ditto for Ribisi's ("Saving Private Ryan") looney loose cannon, though
at least he performs with a wild-and-crazy vigor that occasionally
demands attention. But Epps - poor Epps. Epps ("Higher Learning") is so
short-changed he's reduced to literally waiting around for a bad guy to
chase him.
All this sloppiness can be attributed to the screenwriters, one of whom,
Scott Silver, is also the director. They must think that if they dress
up their stupid story in such spiffy trappings (the look of the film is
really quite impressive), it'll somehow pay off, but this "Mod Squad"
plods anyway. Characters are non-existent; present are just some
good-looking young things modeling cool Levis and cooler attitudes. Plot
hardly escapes confusing convention. And the one genre element you'd
think would be show up in generous portions - a few nifty explosions,
some fights, any kind of action whatsoever - only rarely makes it to
this dull gabfest.
All those quick to put down last month's inept but serviceable "My
Favorite Martian" update need to take a step back. Here's a
small-to-big-screen translation that really should've stayed in its
former incarnation, "Mod" or not.

Something is horribly appropriate about THE MOD SQUAD. It lies in that
confusing teenage ground between mainstream and fringe, and its cynical
postmodern view is suddenly becoming very prevalent in adolescent
society. However, this tiny societal revolution is nothing more than a
hiccup in civilization's grand scale. And so the wave of trendiness
which Scott Silver's THE MOD SQUAD rides is too meaningless to make the
movie of any worth. 
The plot is similarly meaningless for most of its 95-minute running
time, and for a movie of such brevity, that's never good. The fast-paced
feeling is nothing more than an illusion created by the liberal editing
job, and it should be clear that the plot is nothing more than a
skeleton to hang plot devices upon. The three writers involved (director
Silver as well as Stephen Kay and Katie Lanier) have little experience
between them, and that's frequently obvious: the comic relief would be
nothing without Giovanni Ribisi and the suspense is never
well-disguised. 
Of course, with a little work, THE MOD SQUAD could've easily been
premiered on primetime television, and so there's not much room for
extended development. In quick succession, we're introduced to the
characters, their mission, and their problems which will lead to the
climactic final scene. Protagonists Julie (Claire Danes), Linc (Omar
Epps), and Pete (Ribisi) are teens on their way to jail who cut a deal
with police captain Adam Greer (Dennis Farina). The man says: help us
and we'll help you -- that is, our heroes hold a get-out-of-jail-for-now
card while they undercover-cop their way into Los Angeles' hottest
hangouts. All does not go as planned, however, when Greer ends up dead
with some drugs on his person, and everything stinks of setup. 
It takes some time for all of this to stick in the heads of the
audience, and by the time it does, the end credits are only fifteen
minutes away. Most of the script is filled with trivial banter or
clichéd substance, and unfortunately it isn't until the last scene that
one of the characters takes a poke at the recycled plot. But when all is
said, the script never helped this movie. 
So instead director Silver tries to put the burden of success on the
movie's trendy atmosphere: the 70's-revival dress, the racous big city
nightlife, and the ease with which one can get laid therein are all
themes which prevade the movie. Unfortunately the actors are too one-
dimensional (Danes and Epps) or over-the-top (Ribisi) to draw the
audience in, and thus THE MOD SQUAD will be dismissed as smoke and
mirrors. It is possible to have fun watching this movie, but that would
take far more brain power than the producers assumed the target audience
would have.

Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.
     An opening title in THE MOD SQUAD conscientiously defines "mod" for
the viewing audience, then goes the extra mile of defining "squad" as
well.  It's your first clue that the target audience is that
ultra-desirable -- and, apparently, lexically-challenged -- youth
demographic, rather than primarily baby boomers familiar with the
1968-1972 television series.  Not surprisingly, THE MOD SQUAD is a loud
and generally stupid action film with a dose of teen-angst melodrama.
Impressively, it even compounds the misery with a ridiculously convoluted
plot.
     The basic set-up, like that of the series, involves three troubled
young people (back in the day, they'd be called "juvenile delinquents")
recruited by L.A.P.D. Capt. Adam Greer (Dennis Farina) to be a unique
undercover trio.  Faced with the alternatives of prison or police work,
Julie Barnes (Claire Danes), Pete Cochran (Giovanni Ribisi) and Linc Hayes
(Omar Epps) are assigned to "get into places nobody else can."  One of the
places they still seem adapt at getting into is trouble, trouble which
gets particularly nasty when Greer turns up dead and implicated in drug
trafficking.  For no really good reason other than a continuation of the
film, the "Mod Squad" begins its own investigation, uncovering a
conspiracy which would baffle "X-Files" creator Chris Carter.
     You might think that a dense, multi-layered plot would indicate faith
in audience intelligence, but you'd be very mistaken indeed.  THE MOD
SQUAD uses its innumerable narrative threads like shiny objects to
distract an infant, never really caring whether they make for a more
interesting or engaging story.  Julie spends most of the film getting
re-involved with an old flame (Josh Brolin), while Pete and Linc track
down leads in a plot line that runs mostly parallel.  Meanwhile, Pete has
a sensitive moment with his estranged parents, a goofy drug dealer
(Michael Lerner) dances with Linc to "My Favorite Things," Pete and Julie
almost kinda sorta get together, and Linc's car is the object of
ever-wackier damage at Pete's hand.  It doesn't even matter that many of
the sub-plots drift together by the film's conclusion; its Short Attention
Span Theater mentality makes it not at all worth the effort to keep up.
     It's also a dim-witted and trite action film that has the nerve to
wink ironically at its place in the pantheon of dim-witted and trite
action films.  Pete (given an off-kilter sensibility by Ribisi, one of the
few reasons to keep watching) comments incredulously late in the film
about "dirty cops, drug deals...I can't believe this actually happens.  I
feel like I should be saying 'I'm getting too old for this sh*t.'"  Cute
gag, only THE MOD SQUAD hasn't earned that level of self-deprecation.
It's the kind of film where a guy spills his guts to someone who has
chased him down yelling "I'm a cop!" despite the absence of any badge or
weapon.  It's the kind of film where the villains spell out their plans in
more detail than James Bond baddies.  And it's the kind of film that truly
defines gratuitious sex, violence and profanity.  A bad movie can't be a
commentary on the state of bad movie-making.
     The strange thing is that much of that formulaic foolishness could
have worked if THE MOD SQUAD had been played straighter as an homage to
formulaic early-70s cop dramas.  The only time the film is at all
diverting is when B. C. Smith's funky retro-score plays under a dimly lit
chase scene, giving it that faux-gritty vibe.  Director Scott Silver
simply can't maintain that energy, not when he's wasting time on choppy
music video editing of his characters' tender personal moments.  THE MOD
SQUAD is busy and headache-inducing, and rarely even manages to channel
that into viscerally effective action.  It's just another lousy piece of
brand name recycling, so clearly pitched at a dumbed-down audience it's
surprising that, when taking the time to define the film's title, they
risked spotting us the "the."

Gather closely around the table, kids, and let's try to figure out what goes
through the minds of Hollywood studio execs, when green-lighting a movie
such as this. "We'll get the baby-boomers in the theatres with the TV show's
nostalgia factor. We'll get every single kind of kid in the theatre with the
three divergent stars of the movie. We'll slap it all in an eclectic, hip,
young soundtrack and spend our weekends counting all of the money that we
will make. But what about a story, sir? Forget the story, son. This is
marketing!!!"
PLOT:
Three young hoodlums are taken in by a cop who is willing to give them a
second chance. He tells them that they could either work undercover for him
or go to jail. They choose the former route and begin their investigation of
the stolen drug evidence. Soon enough, they find themselves in over their
heads, and without any legal authority to do much about it.
CRITIQUE:
This film has no character development. We are given no reason to give a
rat's ass about any of its leads. This film has a plot line no more
intricate than any weekly mediocre episode of "Miami Vice". With Aaron
Spelling executive producing, this is no big surprise. This film has bad
dialogue, pretty bad acting, and a  horrible haircut by way of Claire Danes.
When you consider that this is a remake of a popular TV series, this might
be caused by the lack of clarity on whether or not this movie was trying to
be serious on its own, or a parody of said show. But most importantly, this
movie is not entertaining in the least, hasn't a single memorable moment in
its entire short runtime of 94 minutes, and only saves itself from being a
complete loss, by the way of Giovanni Ribisi's funny lines.
Oh yeah, and another thing. The number of irrational scenes in this movie is
staggering. Why would anyone give these "kids" any information on the
streets, you might ask? Who knows. One guy gave up all his information
without ever being shown a badge, a gun, or even a viable threat. Also,
early on in the movie, the kids have an opportunity to bail on their given
ultimatum without any repercussions, but without much explanation, they
remain on the case, for in my humble opinion, the sake of this most
uninspirational screenplay. No hip clothes, no hip songs, no slick style,
this film has very little mod about it. In fact, my dictionary definition of
mod reads: "boldly modern and unconventional". This movie is anything but
this! It's a boring, standard, TV show-remake gone wrong, starring Claire
Danes in a role not meant for her, Omar Epps brooding and walking funny, and
Ribisi as the film's only saving grace. And did I mention that there's
barely any action in this movie? You have better chances of being amused in
a dentist's office.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Born and raised in New York, Claire Danes always wanted to be an actress.
She enrolled at the Lee Strassberg Theatre Institute when she was only ten
years old.
Omar Epps is also a rapper and a music video director for such artists as
Heather B, Special Ed and his own rap duo, Wolf Pack. He and his cousin
G-Sharp, recently recorded an as-yet untitled album, producing two of its
tracks. A Brooklyn native, he received his professional training at High
School of Performing Arts in New York City.
Giovanni Ribisi has been in such diverse fare as Steven Spielberg's SAVING
PRIVATE RYAN, David Lynch's LOST HIGHWAY (9/10) and TV's "Friends", as
Phoebe's (Lisa Kudrow) brother, and "The X-Files".
Actors Richard Jenkins and Josh Brolin, who both star in this film, also
co-starred as gay police officers in the hilarious FLIRTING WITH DISASTER
(8.5/10).
"The Mod Squad" TV series also spawned from the brainchild of producer Aaron
Spelling. The series ran from 1968 to 1972, encompassing 100 episodes.  He
is also known to be the father of TV actress Tori Spelling.

Of the possible old television series to remake, "The Mod Squad" has to
be one of the least promising.  Although it was one of my favorites from
back in the late 1960s and early 1970s, its charm was highly tied to the
era.  Rather than update the series, Scott Silver's THE MOD SQUAD is
merely a recast version.  With less material than in one of the old
episodes, the feature film script by Stephen T. Kay and Silver is so
thin it feels like an executive summary that you might present to
potential financial film backers.
Figuring that today's generation not only hasn't seen the series, they
don't even know what "mod" means, the introductory credits feature its
dictionary entry.  Perhaps the confusing and convoluted storyline would
have been helped by explanatory subtitles, but, since you're unlikely to
care, it doesn't really matter.  Suffice it to say that the plot
involves drugs, prostitution and crooked officers with 3 young,
undercover cops, Julie, Pete and Linc, as the heroes of the story.
The best of the new team of crime fighters is Claire Danes as the
attractive blonde, Julie.  Her intelligence enlivens a role that's
little better than a stick figure.  None of the characters have any
depth, and the director doesn't come up with a single fresh scene in the
entire movie.
Giovanni Ribisi plays Pete as only a few IQ points brighter that the
mentally-challenged character he played in THE OTHER SISTER.  Weakest of
all is Omar Epps as Linc, who was the best character in the old show.
Epps's inert acting makes his character less than two-dimensional.
The time period for the movie is relatively indeterminate as the cars
and sets are a mixture of stuff from the 1970s and the 1990s.
Cinematographer Ellen Kuras creates an exceedingly ugly picture, whose
dark, grainy images make it look like it was filmed on cheap videotape
and then later transferred to film stock.  The film's jarring music by
B.C. Smith is full of bongo drums and a jazz beat in the style, perhaps,
of the original, but it feels heavily dated and awkward today.
Yes, Julie does get to say her signature "Right on!" line a few times,
and Linc is allowed one "Solid," but that's about as close as this
remake ever gets to the genuine article.  The original may not have been
worth preserving for the ages, but it did have some class and style,
qualities notably absence from this lame and lifeless movie.
THE MOD SQUAD runs 1:34.  It is rated R for profanity, violence and sex
and would be acceptable for teenagers.

My memories of TV super-producer Aaron Spelling's original late '60s-early
'70s action series are fuzzy at best.  I don't think I've ever seen a full
episode, but I do recall the image of three young, cool cops running
together in pursuit of a perp.  I may not know much, but I know this: the
new big screen revival of the series sure as hell isn't how I remember it.
The new _Mod_Squad_ is a study in how a surefire idea gets botched in the
execution.  The premise of having a group of three young ex-crooks--Julie
Barnes (Claire Danes), Linc Hayes (Omar Epps), and Pete Cochrane (Giovanni
Ribisi)--do undercover police work is a concept ripe for updating.  But any
high hopes are just about immediately let down, then wiped out completely
in one early scene where the three talk in a car.  Sounds simple enough,
but Danes, Epps, and Ribisi show no group chemistry whatsoever.  Some squad
this is--and for reasons known only to Silver and co-writers Stephen Kay
and Kate Lanier, they spend most of the film in individual plot threads.
Individually, though, these actors have problems of their own.  Danes is a
good enough sport, but she appears somewhat ill-at-ease in this, her first
popcorn movie.  Ribisi's Pete is only slightly more intelligent than his
character in _The_Other_Sister_, and his portrayal is every bit as grating.
 The only one who appears the slightest bit in place is Epps, but he
literally runs through the film.  In fact, those running scenes are all
that in-over-his-head director Scott Silver (whose only other film was the
low-budget indie drama _johns_) tries to pass off as action in this talky,
terrible film.  After the one-two failed franchise punch of this and
_The_Rage:_Carrie_2_, MGM is once again left to wait for James Bond to
rescue them with his next, certain-to-be-a-blockbuster adventure, due in
November.

        Absolutely nothing happens in "The Mod Squad," MGM's new
misguided big-screen remake of the "classic" (in the same way
that the rusted Chevy stacked up on cinder blocks and leaking
oil in your neighbor's front yard is a classic) television show.
        Three juvenile delinquints are offered a choice between going
to prison or assisting the police department in an undercover
investigation.  Although they lack experience, training, or
discernible personalities, they agree to the terms of the deal.
The "kids" in question are Julie Barnes (Claire Danes), Pete
Cochran (Giovanni Ribisi) and Linc Hayes (Omar Epps),
who are deemed a valuable resource by their sponsor, Adam Greer
(Dennis Farina).  "They can get into places we can't," he
solemnly explains to anyone who'll listen.  The outcasts sign
aboard as "unofficial officers," which means they're forbidden
to carry badges, firearms, or the audience's interest.
        When Greer is found dead shortly thereafter, his "mod
squad" are identified as the prime suspects.  Knowing they've
been set up, the trio vows to solve the murder and clear their
name.  Julie apparently thinks the best way to assist in the
investigation is to sit in the bathroom floor and drink, which
leaves Pete free to wander around like a brain-damaged yak in
a china store.  It's up to Linc to save the day, and he does not
disappoint: the way he dramatically sneers at one of the villains
is the closest thing to an action sequence contained here.
        Excuse me, I mispoke: there are no "villains" in "The
Mod Squad."  To be a villain, one must have a discernable goal,
something towards which the character (and movie) is building.
"The Mod Squad" just has "bad guys," with the most evil character
still being at least a thesis away from true villainhood.  The
idenity of film's chief "bad guy" is so astonishingly obvious
that I was surprised the movie even attempted to make it into
a mystery.  I mean, duh.
        Giovanni Ribisi is rapidly proving himself to be one
of the most annoying actors working in movies today: I submit
this movie, "The Other Sister," and "First Love, Last Rites"
as evidence.  He's supposed to be comic relief here, but his
performance is like being cornered at a party by an obnoxious
drunk.  Claire Danes, who is often excellent, is barely
going through the motions, while Omar Epps, bless his heart, is
all the more pityable because he's actually trying to save the
movie.  It's so cute!

If you watched TV in the early 70's, you'll probably remember "The Mod
Squad" TV series ... or at least Linc, because he was the coolest of the
trio. "Mod Squad" the movie, borrows the hip idea of deputizing three
prison-bound delinquents. The film starts out promising, but ends up
forgetting its promises.
Here's what the picture did well: 1) Balanced an off the wall, "few cards
short of a full deck" wild-mouthed, white guy (Pete) with Linc (a smooth
black guy who didn't need words to be cool). Even though liberties where
taken in completely changing the TV series' Pete character -- I still liked
this balance. Add to that the straight-shooter Claire Danes and we've got a
likable team. 2) Some of the action sequences were very nicely timed and
shot -- heart-pumping. 3) Though Giovanni Ribisi played the same character
from "The Other Sister" (okay, one notch sharper -- but a lot more
dangerous). He's very funny.
Here's where the picture fell short: 1) Was this a "Mod Squad" of the 90's?
If so, then why the use of "Right on" and "Solid" and the dust-buster on the
wall? If not, then why the late model Cadilac? 2) Convertible through a
car-wash -- been there/done that. 3) Twice our Mod Squaders catch the bad
guys just openly revealing their scheming plans, making it painfully obvious
what they are up to -- and repeating it twice for the tape recorder. 4) Then
there's the scene where the fat old male drug dealer wants to slow dance
with Linc -- What's that? I don't get it? Was it introduced to break the
lull? 5) Lastly, the characters themselves bring attention to the worn cop
show cliches that surround them: drug pimps, crooked detectives and
abandoned warehouse shoot outs.
Did I miss something? Was this supposed to be a spoof? Then it took itself
too seriously. If it wasn't supposed to be a spoof, then it threw itself
away. Which was unfortunate, because it could have been a decent movie.

Here's a quick note to any motion picture company.  If you preface your
movie with a dictionary-like definition, you'd better be careful.  Why? 
Because when the screen displays this snippet of information, it demands
that we begin forming some kind of expectation about this film. In this
instance, the word is 'mod'.  Being mod is showcasing an
unconventionality that is unexplainably cool.  It's a mixture of
rebellion and style or perhaps tenacity and wit.  And the three members
of the Mod Squad do exhibit varying degrees of 'modness'.  Lincoln Hayes
(Omar Epps) sports wicked facial hair and drives a mint 70s Oldsmobile
convertible.  Pete Cochran (Giovanni Ribisi) is a baby-faced,
emotion-driven, loose cannon.  And Julie Barnes (Claire Danes) looks
fabulous in those hip-hugging pants that barely reach her waistline. 
But the film itself doesn't feel 'mod' as much as it does a patchwork
crime story with elements recycled in from other films. 
The story focuses on corruption within the police department and fingers
begin to point in the direction of these three kids.  It's easy to blame
these three young rabble-rousers.  They are all street-hardened kids who
quickly lost their way as they entered adulthood.  They've spent most of
their young adult lives in jail who have been recruited by the police as
special undercover operatives.  You see, normal policemen aren't very
cool, and these three have the ability to stealthily blend into places
that no others can, like illegal rave dances or clubs suspected of
fronting a prostitution ring.  But these three suffer a handicap, as
they come from broken families and a life of crime.  
Without a father figure and a sense of guidance, they're seemingly at a
loss as to how to determine the truth.  All they have is each other. 
And, I would have liked to have seen more dialogue explore their inner
thoughts and visions of their own personal sanctuary as they try to cope
with their precarious situation.  But the film was light on dialogue.  I
would also liked to have seen a modicum of police work, but it seemed as
if the result of their efforts came by way of luck rather than real
sleuthing.  There is just way too much screen time devoted to the
loneliness and despair that these three are going through.  It was
almost like watching a series of three-minute Ad Council commercials
urging children to stay in school or to stay away from drugs.  The story
also mixes in elements of a vast police department conspiracy, Julie's
ex-boyfriend who may or may not be as sincere as he seems, and a pimp
and drug seller whose inclusion completely bewildered me.  
Walking out of the theatre, it amazed me at how empty this movie was. 
It seemed as if the director was content on just having three
cool-looking actors strut in and out of scenes.  They yell, they scream,
they curse a lot, they give the occasional 12-step hug, and they're
scrappy enough to survive using only their wits.  But we never really
develop any kind of sympathy or attachment to any of the three.  The
villains were nondescript, and the story was equally flat.  It only goes
to show that looks aren't everything.

rated R
starring Claire Danes, Omar Epps, Giovanni Ribisi, Dennis Farina, Josh
Brolin, Steve Harris, Michael Lerner, Richard Jenkins
written by Stephen T. Kay, Scott Silver, and Kate Lanier
directed by Scott Silver 
About five minutes into Scott Silver's awful THE MOD SQUAD, I had
already made up my mind to leave the theater. But just as I was
getting out of my chair, a feeling hit me.  Maybe by the end of this
review, I'll know what that feeling was.
Now I know that in most of my reviews I reserve the second paragraph
to describe the plot, but I looked hard at THE MOD SQUAD and couldn't
find one. Those of you who watched the 60's TV series on which this
film is based know that the "mod squad" is a group of three young
criminals (Claire Danes, Omar Epps, Giovanni Ribisi) who are sent out
to become undercover cops. In this two hour long episode (hmm, maybe
the show wasn't this bad) they are sent out by their boss (Dennis
Farina) to execute some kind of drug bust. The funny thing is that
there is not one engaging plot twist to be found at all. For some
reason though, when I decided not to walk out, I became oddly drawn
towards the screen. In no way was I engrossed in the experience, but
there was something subtle in the film that begged me to like it even
the slightest bit. I mean, the film at least lookd great, thanks to
some great cinematography by Ellen Kuras and three very fresh-looking
young faces. Each one of these actors has shown incredible potential
in their prior film outings. Get Danes, Epps, and Ribisi together in a
film with a decent script and I'll be first in line to see it. And
somebody please give Giovanni Ribisi a good role! How come the brat
pack from SUBURBIA (Steve Zahn, Giovanni Ribisi, Parker Posey, Ajay
Naidu) is all of a sudden selling out. SUBURBIA's one of my favorite
movies for G-d's sake! As you can tell by now, I have gone off topic
in this very personal review of THE MOD SQUAD, but I have finally
figured out what made me sit through it. I ended up feeling sorry not
for any character in the film, but for the entire production itself.
