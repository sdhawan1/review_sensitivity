Back in prehistoric times, somewhere in the seventies, battles raged over
beauty contests. Opponents accused the pageants of objectifying women. They
said that parading the contestants in bathing suits like so many sides of beef
lowered women to "sex objects".
Putting aside the discussion of whether being seen as sex object occasionally
is a necessarily bad thing, the critics scored at least minor victories. The
contests became more focused on talent and poise and less on the swimsuit competition.
Of course it is just a coincidence that the most talented women with the most
poise always turn out to be hot babes.
Especially debatable are the teenage contests that encourage young women to
engage in cut-throat competition with their friends to win the coveted title
of "Miss Porkbelly".
Are the high school girls in Mount Rose, Minnesota eager to become "Miss Teen
Princess America"? Are they willing to do almost anything necessary to win?
Former winner Gladys Leeman (Kirstie Ally) has raised her daughter Becky
(Denise Richards) from birth to win this contest. Conveniently Gladys is the
head of the local pageant committee. Some might say this gives Becky a head
start, but it doesn't matter much. The Leemans are what passes for wealthy in
the small town and always get what they want.
Becky's main competition is Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst), a talented ambitious
girl from the wrong side of town. Her trailer-trash mother Annette (Ellen
Barkin) wants her to win, but only because it would provide Amber a ticket out
of Smallville.
When the contestants start getting knocked off, the competition takes a deadly
turn. Not only are the girls putting Vaseline on their teeth to look good, but
they're keeping a close watch on falling stage lights.
The film is presented in the increasing popular "mockumentary" format. A film
crew is supposedly sent to Mount Rose to do a documentary on the event and we
are watching the result.
While this concept worked well for "Spinal Tap" and others, here it's a bust.
Not for minute do we believe this is a documentary. The production values are
too high, improbable scenes are included and it looks exactly like what it is.
Beauty contests would seem the perfect fodder for comedy. The subject was
treated well in the 1975 "Smile". Holly Hunter was hilarious in the 1989 "Miss Firecracker".
I laughed out loud about four times during this film -- a major accomplishment
for any movie. Some of the lowest common denominator humor is undeniably funny.
But more often, the comedy falls flat. Taking a cue from "Fargo", director
Michael Patrick Jann plays the blandness of Mount Rose's culture for laughs.
They talk with accents, eat a lot of jello salads and hotdishes, collect balls
of twine and brag about being the home of Minnesota's Oldest Living Lutheran
(now deceased). Cigarettes dangle from most mouths. It's entertaining the
first time, but repeated over and over, they lose whatever charm they
originally possessed.
Many of the bits are aimed at easy targets. The hefty brother of one of the
judges is mentally challenged and often runs into windows and loses his pants.
He's even referred to as the "mental retard" several times.
The "slut" bits are mildly amusing at first, but also grow old rapidly. The
white trash jokes wear just as badly.
Annette is burned in an explosion and has a beer can welded to her hand. Amber
practices her tap dancing while applying makeup to stiffs in a mortuary. An
important school function is the Lutheran Sisterhood Gun Club.
Far be it from me to say that there isn't room in the world for politically
incorrect humor. But if it's going to be crass, it had better be funny. Some
of the most hilarious films are decided non-pc and even resort to remarkably
stupid jokes.
"Drop Dead Gorgeous" certainly has those two elements, it's just missing the
comedy most of the time. The real beauty contests are much more hilarious.

     It's tough to knock a funny film for being not nearly as funny as it
could have been -- or thinks it is -- but that's ultimately the problem
with DROP DEAD GORGEOUS.  Using that increasingly-popular device of the
faux documentary, it tells the behind-the-scenes story of a regional
beauty pageant in the small town of Mount Rose, Minnesota.  Town grand
dame Gladys Leeman (Kirstie Alley) is one of the organizers of the local 
Miss Teen Princess America competition, but she also happens to be the
mother of contestant Becky Leeman (Denise Richards).  That gives Becky a
distinct edge, though she faces her toughest challenge from tap-dancing
trailer park ingenue Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst).  Unless, that is, Amber
meets the same sort of untimely end as others who cross the Leemans.
     It would be easy enough to call DROP DEAD GORGEOUS a second-rate 
gloss on Michael Ritchie's SMILE, or a wannabe WAITING FOR GUFFMAN, or a
half-hearted THE POSITIVELY TRUE ADVENTURES OF THE ALLEGED TEXAS 
CHEERLEADER-MURDERING MOM (also, not coincidentally, directed by Michael
Ritchie).  Such criticisms don't do justice to the number of belly laughs
this film provides.  Some are exaggerated, like the behavior of one
judge's mentally handicapped brother (Will Sasso).  Some are subtle, like
the production number that finds pageant contestants smearing themselves
on freshly-painted stepladders.  And some are sharp, like the smoking,
drinking, pregnant teen who says she can't make an event because she's
"like, due, or something."  By the time the talent portion of the
competition rolls around -- complete with dog impressions and monologues
from SOYLENT GREEN -- DROP DEAD GORGEOUS has provided enough humor to
avoid being buried by comparative criticism.
     The thing about those comparitive criticisms is that you'd also be
right.  As scripted by Lona Williams -- herself a former Minnesota beauty
contest participant -- the film takes on too many targets to skewer any of
them with maximum effectiveness.  The peek at pageant contestants finds
only the occasional insight, opting instead for broad caricatures and even
broader gags.  The film's small-town setting is given a similar treatment,
with freakishly outrageous characters (including chief overacting
offenders Alley and Ellen Barkin) undercutting the more spot-on
observations of provincial foibles.  In fact, director Michael Patrick
Jann almost always opts for over-the-top, making the documentary set-up
seem completely inappropriate.  It's impossible to get caught up in DROP
DEAD GORGEOUS's verisimilitude when the action arbitrarily switches to 
rapid-fire, multiple-angle edits the likes of which I've never seen in any
documentary.
     It's that aggravating refusal to look for genuine humor that makes
DROP DEAD GORGEOUS so frustrating.  When it's funny, it's quite
entertaining, but there's always the suspicion that it could have been
hilarious with a bit of care.  Why make the teen-obsessed judge (Matt
Malloy) a nervous, chain-smoking cartoon character patterned after
Martin Short's shyster Nathan Thurm?  Why continue the story for fifteen
minutes after the film's natural climax, including a vomit-spewing journey
to the state finals?  Why give the one recognizably human character (the
wonderful Allison Janney as Amber's surrogate mother) so little to do?
Every joke made in DROP DEAD GORGEOUS made me think of a joke missed;
every raucous chuckle called to mind an even better sly snicker.  It's
like a vaudeville act that will do anything to please the crowd, only it's
a vaudeville act that thinks it's a wicked satire.  You'll laugh, you'll
sigh, you'll think about the better films covering similar subject matter.
This may be one of the least satisfying entertaining films of recent
years.

Don't be surprised if you find yourself wishing the "gorgeous"
girls would just drop dead in this heavy-handed mock-documentary. Set
in Mount Rose, Minnesota, it purports to examine a small-town beauty
pageant. Here in the hallowed American heartland, amidst cow pats and
pork sausage, there's an all-out battle being waged for the sparkling
tiara. Denise Richards plays a spoiled little rich girl whose primary
talent seems to be sucking up to the judges, mouthing banal
platitudes, and dedicating her rendition of "Can't Take My Eyes Off
You" to Jesus Christ. Kirstie Alley plays her scheming mother, a
former winner, who also serves as the pageant's coordinator. The only
real competition comes from a sweet, guileless, tap-dancing trailer
park girl, Kirsten Dunst, who worships Diane Sawyer and wants to
become a television journalist. She's egged on by her chain-smoking,
beer-swilling mom, Ellen Barkin, and wonderfully slutty neighbor,
Alison Janney. Screenwriter Lona Williams and director Michael Patrick
Jann (MTV's "The State") rely on caricatures and revisit too many
snide, crude cliches - from the "You betcha" drawl of "Fargo" to the
"Spinal Tap" hysteria to the condescending "Waiting for Guffman"
buffoonery of "God-fearin' folk." Not that beauty pageants aren't ripe
for satire, but "Smile" (1975) did it so much better - and it didn't
need to travel to the Eating Disorder wing of the local
hospital. Holly Hunter's "The Positively True Adventures of the
Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom" set a standard for such
things that this doesn't even come close to. On the Granger Movie
Gauge of 1 to 10, "Drop Dead Gorgeous" is a tepid, trivial 5. Too bad
Hollywood couldn't have left it alone to develop on its own as a
little independent film called "Dairy Queens."

Once you get used to the "Fargo" accents, "Drop Dead" will prove  amusing
and apt in accomplishing what it sets out to do.
A mock-doc (feigned-documentary), this film spoofs a teen beauty pageant in
Mount Rose, Minnesota. The documentary crew follows contestants and judges
through the days just prior and following the city finals. To push things
over the edge of silliness, someone is knocking off (as in killing)
potential teen winners; hence the exceedingly clever title of the movie. In
fact, this may just be the most appropriately titled movie of the year.
Some outstanding moments:
Contestants sport their "All-American" Head-dressings:
Mt. Rushmore, nuclear power (a mushroom cloud), and finally a large ball of
twine atop the head of an unlikely winner who cries out, "I think I
misunderstood the assignment!" The ironic coupling of religion, arms and
teenage girls in The Lutheran Sisterhood Gun Club. A past queen in all her
Hollywood stardom sells St. Paul pork products. Anorexic reigning queen
lip-sincs Melissa Manchester's "Don't cry out loud" from her wheelchair. And
last but not least, the top contestant tap dances to Industrial Rock music.
Starring Kirsty Alley, Kirsten Dunst, Denise Richards, and Ellen Barkin.
Directed by Michael Patrick Jann. Written by Lona Williams. Produced by
Gavin Polone and Judy Hofflund at New Line. Rated PG-13.
Grade ......................................... B+

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
In the style of Christopher Guest's fantastic Waiting for Guffman, Drop
Dead Gorgeous is a mockumentary about the Sarah Rose Cosmetics American
Teen Princess beauty pageant trials in Mount Rose, Minnesota.  Mount
Rose is the home of the oldest living Lutheran, or so the sign states as
you enter the burg.  But the mayor explains, through a veil of
obscenities, that the elderly coot actually kicked the bucket several
years earlier, and those damn Lutherans just won't take the sign down.
Only in Mount Rose will you come upon a church that uses grape Kool-Aid
for the blood of Christ.  Only in Mount Rose will you hear phrases like
`beautiful as a whore's ass' and  `Jesus Christ on a cross.'  Only in
Mount Rose will you encounter the reigning Teen Princess residing in
`the bone garden'  the anorexia/bulimia wing of the local hospital.
Only in Mount Rose will you discover that the favorite for this year's
crown is the great white (trash) hope Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst,
Dick), who practices her tap dancing while applying the makeup and
styling the hair of the deceased at the local mortuary.  Only in Mount
Rose will you find Amber's chief competition in Becky Leeman (Denise
Richards, Wild Things), a murderously beautiful vixen from the good side
of the tracks, who will stop at nothing to become the President of the
Lutheran Sisterhood Gun Club, not to mention winning the pageant.
In short, the film project is any aspiring documentary filmmaker's
dream, and, more importantly, doesn't involve chasing urban legends
around the woods of Burkittsville, Maryland.
In Amber's corner are her alcoholic mother Annette (Ellen Barkin, The
Fan) and Loretta (Allison Janney, 10 Things I Hate About You), her mom's
slutty best friend.  Early in the film, Annette is nearly killed when
their trailer suspiciously explodes and is left, tragically, with a beer
can seared to her right hand.
Meanwhile, Becky's camp includes pageant coordinator and emcee Gladys
Leeman (Kirstie Alley, For Richer or Poorer), who not only happens to be
Becky's mom, but is also a former pageant winner from several years (and
several pounds) past.  Becky's pop Lester (Sam McMurray, The Mod Squad)
owns a local furniture store and, luckily, can afford to keep Becky and
Gladys in the lifestyle to which they are accustomed.
Among the three pageant judges are John Dough (Matt Malloy, In the
Company of Men), a pharmacist who seems a little too eager to rate the
blossoming young women, and Harold Vilmes (Michael McShane from the
British version of Whose Line is it Anyway?), who runs the local
hardware store with his retarded brother and constant shadow Hank
(William Sasso).
The other pageant contestants are representatives of just about every
clique that I can remember from high school  the artsy actress who
wears black, the lesbian sports freak and the cheerleading sperm
receptacle, among others.  Each is equally hysterical, but can't quite
hold a candle to Lisa Swenson (Brittany Murphy, Clueless and the voice
of LuAnn on King of the Hill) who gives yet another scene-stealing
performance.  Also of note is Gladys' pageant crony Iris Clark (Mindy
Sterling, Austin Powers).
Originally titled Dairy Queens, Gorgeous was directed by Michael Patrick
Jann from the under-viewed but consistently entertaining sketch comedy
show called The State, which ran on MTV several years ago.  The caustic,
crisp script was written by Lona Williams, a producer from The Drew
Carey Show, and the film's music is from Devo alum Mark Mothersbaugh.
Viewers may not know that films with a PG-13 rating are only allowed to
use the dreaded `F' word once, and the filmmakers save it up for a
whopper of a line at the end of the picture.  (1:37 - PG-13 for
irreverent and crude humor, sex-related material and language)

     This is not SPINAL TAP.  And if DROP DEAD GORGEOUS has a singular
flaw, it's that it tries too hard to be SPINAL TAP.  And that's
unfortunate, because as far as spoof documentaries go, DROP DEAD is an
otherwise gorgeous entry.
     GORGEOUS actually began life as a sleepy independent film called
DAIRY QUEENS, but, as is common in Hollywood, the gears began a-shiftin'
in the heads of sundry studio executives, and before you knew it, DAIRY
QUEENS became a big Hollywood movie.
     Sort of.  GORGEOUS keeps a measure of its indie charm by placing
the action in a tiny Minnesota town called Mount Rose, which is hosting
its annual teen beauty pageant, to the delight of the town's residents.
And in the grand tradition of films like WAITING FOR GUFFMAN, the real
story is in the quirky inhabitants of the town, not the main plot line.
     The beauty pageant, in a nutshell, pits rich girl Becky (Richards)
vs. trailer trash Amber (Dunst), while Becky's mom (Alley) presides over
the pageant.  Naturally, cat fights and backstabbing ensue, and it
becomes readily apparent that the fix is in for Becky.
     Well, nothing goes according to plan, and we follow the girls to
the state pageant, and through their personal lives, and for the most
part, DROP DEAD GORGEOUS is drop dead hysterical.
     But there's something missing.  In the rush to invent a clever faux
documentary, the filmmakers have left out much of that indie feel.  Too
much is obviously and blatantly staged for anyone to think for a second
this is real.  Hollywood can never leave well enough alone.  By the time
we get to the third act (the state pageant), the film has gone so far
over the top that it loses its charm.
     Still, I recommend GORGEOUS on the overall strength of its comedy.
But in that little `documentary' text opener, how much I would have
given to see it followed by the words: `Their footage was found buried
in the woods a year later.'
     [As a side note, I have to add that it's been a pleasure watching
Kirsten Dunst grow up on celluloid.  From LITTLE WOMEN to `ER' to
GORGEOUS, Dunst is becoming a real actor.  filmcritic.com offers its
congratulations.]

The accents and exaggerated stupid characters from FARGO meet a mockumentary
type film featuring a black comedy look behind Teen America beauty pageants.
PLOT:
A faux documentary film featuring a glimpse behind the scenes of a small
Minnesota town's teen beauty contestants and their overly competitive
families.
CRITIQUE:
Some people may find stupid, over-the-top, stereotyped characters from a
small town to be extremely funny, and I myself have been known to subscribe
to this group from time to time, but it was obvious from the first frame of
this film that its only source of comedy would come from its idiotic
characters, goofy accents and ignorant statements. For me, that just wasn't
funny! It's unfortunate because the premise of the film seemed ripe for
parody with some funny characters brewing within, but for me, only a few
chuckles trickled out here and there, but mostly I was shaking my head and
thinking "this is just stupid". It didn't  help that most of the main
characters seemed to go in and our their accents from time to time.
Besides its lack of consistent humor, I also found that the film ran a
little too long, had one really exaggerated and unfunny retarded character
who was just embarrassing, and many, many missed opportunities, including a
flat ending. I did enjoy two smaller characters in the film, one being the
father of Denise Richards character and judge#2 with his penchant for "young
girls", but overall, most felt tired. Two characters which were way
underused were Ellen Barkin, who could've been so much more, and Denise
Richards, who appeared to be the star of the film from the look of its
trailer, but actually only played a small part within a diverse cast of
characters.
Overall, the film didn't do it for me, offering very little in real humor
and relying more on the easy, let's make fun of the trailer-trash-folk-type
of comedy. And if you're expecting T&A from Richards, forget about it. Any
which way you look at it, missed opportunities all around.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Kirsten Dunst has gone on record as saying that she will remain a virgin
until she meets the "right guy", and once dated Dustin Hoffman's son. She
also beat out Christina Ricci for roles in INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE (8/10)
and LITTLE WOMEN.
This film is director Michael Patrick Jann's feature debut. This film is
also screenwriter Lona Williams' first produced script. She was once first
runner up in the National Junior Miss competition. She also plays Judge#3 in
this film.
Denise Richards stands 5'6", has been nicknamed "Fluffy Girl", and made her
feature film debut as Gladys in 1993's LOADED WEAPON.
In 1995, Ellen Barkin dated actor David Arquette. She was also married to
actor Gabriel Byrne
This film was originally titled DAIRY QUEENS.

1999, PG-13, 97 minutes [1 hour, 37 minutes]
Starring: Kirsten Dunst (Amber Atkins), Kirstie Alley (Mrs. Gladys Leeman), 
Denise Richards (Becky Leeman), Allison Janney (Loretta); written by Lona 
Williams; produced by Judy Hofflund, Gavin Polone; directed by Michael 
Patrick Jann.
Seen July 27, 1999 at 7:30 p.m. at Crossgates Cinema 18 (Guilderland, NY), 
theater #18, by myself for free (see review for explanation). [Theater 
rating: ***: good sound, picture and seats]
"Drop Dead Gorgeous" was a movie I didn't really want to see. I had sat 
through its trailer dozens of times assuming it was another idiotic comedy 
meant to appeal to teens and those who enjoy lowbrow, b-movie humor (the 
marketing campaign focused only on the slapstick comedy, the film's 
mentally-challenged character and teenage girls shaking their booty). I went 
in fully prepared to be bored and offended and came out pleasantly surprised 
and I am now shocked at how poorly it has performed at the box office. I'll 
still review it anyway.
I was standing outside the cineplex at the local mall looking at the big 
board of titles and times when a woman came up to me and asked if I wanted to 
see a sneak preview of "Runaway Bride" because she had won some passes to it 
through one of those radio contests and she couldn't go. I thought it would 
be a good idea because then I'd be able to review that movie before it was 
released nationally, but when I got in line the manager said the theater was 
overbooked and those who couldn't get in could go see whatever else was 
playing for free. There weren't any other good movies playing until late and 
I had to get up early the next day for work and since "Drop Dead Gorgeous" 
was playing at the time I decided to see it. I heard really bad things from 
some of my fellow Internet critics and actually thought it'd be a good idea 
to see a bad movie because I haven't ripped into a film in a long time.
So I went in and had my watch set to clock the time it would take before I 
found something good to laugh at (hoping I could say "I didn't laugh until 
45:15 into the running time"). Boy was I surprised when big laughs came 
during the film's first few scenes.
An opening title card tells us that a major cosmetics company has sponsored a 
national teen beauty pageant at the local and state level for 50 years and to 
celebrate the anniversary a documentary crew was sent to the small town of 
Mount Rose, Minnesota to show what the pageant means to average high school 
girls, their parents and the communities they live in (they don't say WHO 
sent the film crew). Fortunately for this filming team, Mount Rose is the 
kind of town that only exists in a comedy movie, but that's okay because 
funny is funny.
We start with a shot of the town's welcome sign pointing out the fact it is 
home to "The Oldest Living Lutheran in Minnesota," which is a good indication 
of how this little town takes pride in anything. The joke is extended even 
further when the town's mayor says the sign isn't accurate because that 
person actually died and every year he asks the Shriners to "take down that 
goddamned sign but they never do." Maybe that's a little crude and lowbrow, 
but it probably wasn't what you expected to hear from a small town mayor, 
especially the way the comedy is delivered here.
The entire film is meant to be a real documentary on the town's beauty 
pageant which is a technique rarely used by mainstream comedies, but works 
well here because it allows the townsfolk to talk directly to the camera and 
say what they're feeling and makes them seem a bit more realistic. It also 
works as a regular fiction story in that it's easy to tell what the 
characters actually mean when they speak to the camera and when they're lying.
The first third of the movie is quite funny in its setup and depiction of its 
characters, who are all exactly that - characters. The pageant contestants 
each have their own trait that gives them their comedic hook. There's a girl 
who has a frightening love of dogs, one who wants to teach the world sign 
language through ballet-style dancing, one who thinks "Soylent Green" would 
make a great dramatic monologue, one whose brother is a drag queen in New 
York City and thinks it's the coolest thing, one who was adopted by an Asian 
family and thinks she's Asian, and one who can't stop making out with her 
boyfriend and fulfills the generic slutty blonde role. The two real 
contestants of the film are, not surprisingly, complete opposites, the 
best-looking and the only real names the film has to market.
Kirsten Dunst stars as Amber Atkins, a homely, good-natured and high-spirited 
girl who works part time as a mortician while she dreams of becoming a famous 
journalist like her idol Diane Sawyer. Amber is pretty bright and right away 
she has a lot of appeal thanks to Dunst making her cute and sweet in a 
cartoony way. Amber's nemesis is the rich snob Becky Leeman (Richards), whose 
mother, Mrs. Gladys Leeman (Alley) just happens to be the organizer of the 
pageant and whose father (Sam McMurray) is the wealthiest businessman in town 
(he runs a small furniture store as if it were a cut-throat car dealership). 
If it's easy to tell Amber is our hero, it's even easier to tell Becky and 
her mother are the antagonists who we love to hate.
And so we have this subtle battle between Amber and the Leemans who will stop 
at nothing to ensure Becky will win the pageant even though they have 
obviously rigged it anyway. Many of the jokes and the sub-plots involve 
mysterious actions occurring meant to thwart Amber's rise such as a few 
deaths here and there. That might seem cold and cruel but the comedy never 
comes across as mean-spirited despite these instances. For example, Amber's 
trailer explodes with her mother inside and when we catch up with her at the 
hospital we see she has a beer can singed to her hand!
Yes, that's lowbrow comedy but it works effectively here. But instead of 
giving the film an ugly, connotative atmosphere you'd get with a b-movie that 
uses many of the same jokes, it works just the opposite here to keeps things 
lighthearted and humorous. We're always laughing at the characters, but 
because they're so blatantly over-the-top in every way it doesn't feel bad to 
derive pleasure from it. It's that kind of comedy that you laugh at and 
repeat out loud not knowing whether you're laughing because it's so dumb or 
because it's actually funny.
A few examples of this: one of the judges is named "John Dough" and is 
clearly a pedophile, but one who is quite bad at hiding his secret (if his 
name doesn't already make that clear) and tends to ramble on about how normal 
he is, such as when we see him watching the girls practice and notice that 
he's carrying a camcorder which he claims is for insurance purposes, "in case 
of accidents." There's also a huge mentally-challenged young man who is the 
brother of one of the judges (who isn't much smarter). The two fight with 
each other and it's funny to laugh at the antics the "retard" performs 
because he doesn't know any better, but it's also funny to laugh at the way 
the others react to him because it's so politically incorrect.
There isn't much more to elaborate on the film's plot, which is probably its 
weakest point. It's filled with continuity errors galore and is predictable 
to the extreme, but really, how else could they have done it? It's  similar 
to "Titanic" in that it realizes it's placating to the audience and doesn't 
apologize. You can't possibly take the things as zany and stupid as this 
seriously so don't bother. "Drop Dead Gorgeous" is a comedy meant to be 
laughed at, so go ahead and indulge yourself.

If you could be any tree in the woods, what kind of tree would you be?"
Starring Kirstie Alley, Denise Richards, Ellen Barkin, Kirsten Dunst,
Allison Janney. Rated PG-13.
There has been a trend, in the summer of 1999, of movies that are rude,
crude, irreverent, insulting and hilarious. South Park: Bigger Longer
and Uncut and Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me are good examples
and now Drop Dead Gorgeous joins their ranks. It's a mean-spirited and
often inspired satire of beauty pageant traditions that takes absolutely
no prisoners and draws few boundaries for itself.
Drop Dead Gorgeous is actually a mockumentary: supposedly, a documentary
film crew is sent to film the events surrounding a beauty pageant in the
fictitious town of Mount Rose, Minnesota. There, girls compete for the
title of Mount Rose American Teen Princess -- and it gets ugly. There,
Gladys Leeman (Kirstie Alley), the pageant organizer, is campaigning
like mad to get her daughter, Becky Leeman (Denise Richards) to be the
winner of the pageant. That campaigning just might include killing some
of the other contestants to get them out of the way.
Then there's Amber Atkins -- the "good girl" contestant -- and the local
sentimental favorite. But she gets scared after a few contestans are
apparently killed and her mother's trailer is blown up, fusing a beer
can to her chain-smoking mother's hand. Her Mother (Ellen Barkin) almost
kills Amber herself after she tries to tell her that she wants to quit
the pageant so that she winds up staying in.
This is definitely one of the funnier movies to come along this year,
although much of the humor is mean-spirited and some even sadistic.
Rookie director Michael Patrick Jann stages all of his gags in such a
deadpan (no pun intended) style that it's difficult not to laugh. While
we may not always be proud at what we are laughing at (an anorexic
former pageant winner who just kept dieting after she won?), there's no
denying that Drop Dead Gorgeous is witty and clever.
Denise Richards gives a wonderful performance as the snotty Becky
Leeman; while I'd have to say that her performance was the most
outstanding, I also liked most of the others. Kirstie Alley is terrific
as the scheming pageant overseer and Ellen Barkin gives a funny
performance as Amber's very troubled mother.
This is clever, although admittedly not always very intelligent satire.
It may make fun of everybody it can get it's teeth on, but it's funny
and it's fun to watch. This is the kind of film that appeals to our more
sadistic sides.

Drop Dead Gorgeous is a sick and demented film. The jokes are so crude 
and inappropriate that you wonder whether or not the filmmakers have any 
values whatsoever (They even take cracks at young beauty pageants in the 
wake of the Jonbenet Ramsey scandal). The characters seem to be plastic, 
with no depth, but rather stereotypes guiding their every move. So will 
people hate this nauseating and disgusting outrage? At the very least it 
will cause two parts of the mind to go to war. First there is the 
well-taught, manner-minding, and always polite sub-conscious that your 
mother so valiantly programmed into you. Second you have the immature 
residue that lingers deep in the realms of your mind from your teenage 
days, still occasionally snickering at "retard" jokes. The latter will 
prevail, creating heaps of laughter and putting a smile on your face- no 
matter how undeserved .
If you thought that this summer's other fake documentary was too scary 
for your taste, this film may well fill the void. The crew of Drop Dead 
Gorgeous consists of two men sent to Mount Rose, Minnesota, small town 
USA. Annually, four people get to make "the biggest decisions of their 
lives" when they judge the local beauty pageant. Other than that, things 
are as Fargonian as they come: The accents are heavy and the big cities 
of St. Paul and Minneapolis lie not too far in the distance, but the 
town hardware store ranks far above the Mall of America on the locals' 
lists.
In Mount Rose, there is one family that seems to have all the money, the 
Leemans. Lester (Sam McMurray), the father, owns the local furniture 
store and has a particular hatred of Jews. Gladys (Kirstie Alley), the 
mother, is president of several town committees and, most importantly, 
is a former winner of the beauty pageant. Becky (Denise Richards), the 
daughter, follows in her mother's footsteps and, if Gladys gets her 
way, will be the next winner of the pageant. So just how far will Gladys 
go to get her way? Well, I never said that this movie didn't have a 
higher body count than that other fake documentary.
At the other end of the extreme spectrum lays the Atkins family (for all 
the hilarious diet jokes in the film, the potential humor that could 
come from this last name is passed by). This mother-daughter duo lives 
in a trailer, almost always accompanied by Loretta (Allison Janney), a 
friend. Amber (Kirsten Dunst), the daughter, works two jobs trying to 
support her mother (Ellen Barkin), and hopes to one day leave Mount Rose 
for a better life. Her ticket out: The pageant.
The old rule of the two biggest characters facing off at film's end 
holds true, but only after we meet some of the other pageant players. 
This is where the immature, yet hilarious, jokes pour on: a retarded 
judge, a perverted judge, a girl who speaks sign language and English 
simultaneously, a sex addict, and tons of stereotypical high school 
ditzes.
We are told early in Drop Dead Gorgeous that Mount Rose doesn't have 
any back rooms in its video stores. That comes most ironically as this 
film is a guilty pleasure, to put it lightly. I could draw comparisons 
between this film's pleasures and those of another movie involving an 
outsider entering a town (her name was Debbie, the town was Dallas), but 
this is a family review.
Editor's note: Following last week's "Editor's Note" on the MPAA, 
Moviereviews.org will now make this a regular section. Following all 
full length reviews, a paragraph or more will be added commenting on how 
the MPAA and its president, Jack Valenti, dealt with the film at hand. 
Hopefully this will help expose the many wrongs with that group.
Drop Dead Gorgeous is rated PG-13, meaning that tickets can be sold to 
anyone and a mild parental advisory is issued to all those with kids 
under 13. Before the credits role, the audience is treated to the 
following violations of common decency:
    a.. People being burned alive
    b.. Several acts of pre-meditated violence and murder
    c.. Curse words being flung about freely
    d.. Numerous people vomiting
    e.. A girl dancing in a provocative manner with a statue of Jesus.
    f.. Conversations about breast enlargements
    g.. A general theme of sex and violence
Kirsten Dunst recently appeared in Wag the Dog, a film rated R (No 
children under 17 without a parent or guardian). Drop Dead Gorgeous 
easily has more violence and sexual innuendo than Wag the Dog. I 
didn't count, but I would guess the curse words are a draw between the 
two films. So why the heavier rating for Wag the Dog? I don't know. 
Perhaps Jack Valenti does.

        The Beauty Pageant: an obvious comedic target, yes?  Yet "Drop Dead
Gorgeous" doesn't simply poke fun at the whole superficial, demeaning
affair.  It skewers it.  It incinerates it, smacks it upside the head with
a shovel, shoots it between the eyes, blows it up (not once but twice!),
splatters it with paint and, for its crowning glory, vomits all over it.
        It's the kind of movie in which no one is spared.  The mentally
challenged, bulimic, Asian, fat, lame, Lutheran, hospitalized, adopted,
gay, and Adam West ("TV's Batman") all take it on the chin in the name of
biting black comedy.  It sounds like poor taste, but as poor taste goes
it's remarkably good natured...and unbelievably funny.
        I haven't laughed this hard in a movie since that segment of Jim
Jarmusch's "Night on Earth" in which Giancarlo Esposito struggles to get
across New York in Armin Mueller-Stahl's taxicab.  Come to think of it, I
haven't laughed as *long* as this before--for well over an hour I was
doubled over in pain, my sides cramped from laughing so much.  I was
slapping my knees and roaring with delight.  And the rest of the audience
was slapping and roaring right along with me.
        It's no small admission to say that "Drop Dead Gorgeous" is the
funniest film I have ever seen.
        Is there anything wrong with it?  Yes.  It runs out of steam in the
last 15-20 minutes (but still secures some good belly laughs in the
process).  How could it not?  But that gripe seems inconsequential in light
of all the drop dead gorgeously-realized hysteria that has gone before.
        In the small-town hamlet of Mount Rose, Minnesota ("yah, you
betcha!"), the residents are abuzz.  It's the 50th anniversary of the Miss
Teen Princess America Pageant, sponsored by Sarah Rose Cosmetics, and a
documentary film crew are in town covering the events.  Maitre-d' of the
contest is Gladys Leeman (Kirstie Alley), a former winner with a
win-at-all-costs attitude.  Gladys is convinced that her daughter Becky
(Denise Richards, "Wild Things") will this year walk off with the coveted
tiara.  No one doubts her, since the Leemans are the wealthiest family in
town.  "When one of them goes to the bathroom, it's news."
        If anyone can challenge Becky's claim to the throne, it's Amber
Atkins (a perfect Kirsten Dunst).  Amber lives in a trailer park with her
beer-drinking, chain-smoking mother (Ellen Barkin; fabulous) and works at
the local morgue, doing make-up jobs on the cadavers.  Her talent is tap
dancing and Amber, who has two role models in life (Mom and Diane Sawyer),
"just wants to compete."  Becky is more the "promote world peace" kind of
competitor.
        There are six additional entrants in the pageant and the film is a
casting coup of bright, up-and-coming talent who are asked to endure
humiliating situations.  In spite of performing dog barks, cheerleading
calisthenics, interpretive sign-languaged dance, and heartfelt passages
from "Soylent Green," these young women act flawlessly.
        The dress rehearsals, in-fighting, cringe-inducing choreography,
back stabbing, and interviews with the contestants are all captured by the
film crew as the pageant explodes in ridiculous style.  To spoil any one of
the myriad of jokes would be irresponsible.
        "Drop Dead Gorgeous" is a sophisticated comedy, kind of like what
"Waiting for Guffman" should have been.  Writer Lona Williams (herself a
former Minnesota beauty pageant contestant) and first-time director Michael
Patrick Jann handle things absolutely beautifully and have created a
near-perfect product in so doing; there's subtlety, smarts, and a lot of
sickness going on here.
        Gorgeous isn't quite the word I'd use to describe the film but it
*is* drop dead hilarious.

Drop Dead Gorgeous by John Sylva    Rating: A-
http://members.aol.com/DeWyNGaLe/MoviePED.html
Welcome to Mount Rose, Minnesota. So, you're a teen girl? Make sure to check
out the annual Mount Rose Miss America Teen Princess Pageant while you're here
- It's tradition for young girls. Make sure you've got three things though!
1. Your gun. 2. A bad attitude. 3. A plan to make sure no one else will win.
The ideal human example of what you need to win is the rich, spoiled brat,
Becky Leeman (Denise Richards), whose scheming mother, Gladys (Kirstie Alley),
was winner of the pageant when she was a teen. Becky Leeman is the favorite to
win this year, but has eight competitors, one of which is a serious threat to
her. That would be Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst), a dedicated, hard working teen
who works at the local funeral home, applying makeup to corpses before their
burial. Unlike Becky, who lives in an enormous mansion, Amber lives with mother
Annette and occasionally Annette's friend Loretta (Alison Janney) in a trailer.
A crew has come to Mount Rose to film the contestants, and the pageant, for
their documentary film. Through this concept, we get to meet each contestant,
and learn a little about each one of them, including their talents. As the
pageant date comes closer and closer, the number of contestants becomes lower
and lower, as young girls are mysteriously being killed.
Drop Dead Gorgeous is a hilarious mockumentary, which will go down as one of
the funniest movies of the year, and also the best film about making a
documentary. (The overrated Blair Witch Project would be its only competition.)
The clever screenplay, which is written by first time film writer Lona
Williams, features dialogue which is fast, edgy, and funny. Drop Dead Gorgeous
is the type of film that I will be quoting lines from for years to come, as the
dialogue exchanged among characters is hysterical. Drop Dead Gorgeous' dark
humor may turn many off, but this politically incorrect comedy should go down
as a classic to fans of this summer's South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut,
and 1998's There's Something About Mary.
In a summer full of blockbusters and special effects, Drop Dead Gorgeous is one
of the few that is worth the admission price, and of course it will flop at the
box office, as it made only 1.4 million on opening day, unless positive word of
mouth starts flying around fast about this surprisingly funny comedy.
All of the performances are up to par, especially those of Ellen Barkin's, who
is hysterical as the offbeat mother, and Kirsten Dunst, who makes the best of
the screenplay, which gives her much to do. Dunst's character is not only
funny, practicing her tap dancing gig while applying makeup to the dead, she is
downright realistic as a caring and sensitive contestant who realizes the
pageant is turning into something else - Get out before you die! Dunst, who at
17 has appeared in over ten films, including her brief, but funny performance
in 1997's Wag the Dog, is getting her big break with Drop Dead Gorgeous, as her
performance shows the audience the talented actress they will be seeing in many
films to come over the next few years.
Denise Richards is the ideal snob as she walks around, flashing her faky smile
to everyone, as her desperate mother just continues to route her on. Richards
is making a great career decision with Drop Dead Gorgeous, as she has already
done sci-fi (Starship Troopers) and drama (Wild Things), but is now showing off
her comedic abilities, and this fall in the next James Bond installment, The
World is Not Enough, will be showing off her action skills. Kirstie Alley is
equally perfect as her mother, not for a second showing a bit of kindness
towards the other contestants. Alley is making a career saving decision with
Drop Dead Gorgeous, as her television series "Veronica's Closet" is slowly
losing its popularity, and her last film, 1997's For Richer or Poorer didn't
perform to well at the box office, or with critics.
The entire first hour of the film is particularly strong, but in the last
thirty minutes the film starts to lose its edge, as it becomes a good comedy.
Now for me to say that it becomes good, (from great) is a marvelous compliment
for this underrated, overlooked film. A few guys filming a beauty pageant may
not sound particularly creative, but Drop Dead Gorgeous bursts with originality
and creativity, pulling numerous, consistent gags which had me in hysterics.
The Bottom Line- A clever mockumentary with a great script makes for one of the
summer's best films. The title shouldn't be Drop Dead Gorgeous, it should be
Drop Dead Hilarious.

   While you're still trying to figure out the answer to the
classic philosophic question, "If a tree falls in the forest with
no witnesses, does the tree make a sound?" you can ponder
yet another one.  If a movie billed as a comedy has not a
single laugh, can it still be called a comedy?  This movie is
yet another parody of the type of event that is itself so
asinine it needs no satirist.  "Drop Dead Gorgeous"--so
named to exploit a double meaning (one of which being an
implicit quote from the principal character, "Drop dead,
gorgeous"--this film features vulgarity for its own sake rather
than crudeness in the pursuit of humor.  The inspiration for
the movie is perhaps Michael Ritchie's 1975 production
"Smile," which spotlighted a superior cast including Bruce
Dern, Barbara Feldon and Melanie Griffith centering on
behind-the-scenes activity at a California "Young American
Miss" pageant.  While "Smile" symbolized the emptiness of
American middle-class existence, "Drop Dead Gorgeous"
goes after targets too vulnerable to defend themselves,
including the mentally retarded, the deaf, poor Mexicans,
anorectics, small town rubes and trailer trash.  In taking pot
shots at rural hollowness, director Michael Patrick Jann does
not even opt for the miscarried outrageousness of Harmony
Korine's plotless dud "Gummo"--about poor white trash in a
desolate Ohio town whose citizens get their jollies from
shooting cats and selling the bodies to the local supermarket.
   "Drop Dead Gorgeous" features Kirstie Alley in the role of
Gladys Leeman, the town's richest women, who is emceeing
a teen beauty contest but is hardly impartial.  Her
own daughter, the vacuous Rebecca (Denise Richards), has
been trained by Gladys to push all the right buttons to score
points with the judges.  
  To get a measure of the numbing inauspiciousness of
Alley's performance as an assassin, one need only compare
her dispatch of the hackneyed role with that of Holly
Hunter--who won an Emmy for her portrayal of the obsessed
Houston housewife who plots to kill her daughter's
competitors for spots on the cheerleading squad in Michael
Ritchie's "The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged
Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom."
   Directed like Myles Berkowitz's "20 Dates" as a mock
documentary, scripter Lona Williams's story spotlights Alley's
ineptitude but focuses as well on the two 17-year-olds
considered the leading contestants in a teen beauty pageant
held in a heartland Minnesota town.  The confident Rebecca
Leeman (Denise Richards) is pitted against a perpetual
motion machine, Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst), the
contestants now numbering eight when one of the girls is
mysteriously burned to death in a tractor accident.  Though
the two major contenders are from different sides of the track
in the town of just over 5,000 people, they are equally
ambitious. Ultimately, Amber will conclude the movie in a
scene that recalls Tracy Flick's triumph in "Election."  Director
Jann is himself attempting ineffectually to capitalize on that
film's critical and box office success.
   While vulgarity need not be off-putting and can, in itself, be
the source of considerable humor (witness the hilarious
inventiveness of "South Park" and "American Pie"), in "Drop
Dead Gorgeous" the boorishness is plain obtuse.  Examples:
Amber gleefully dances about the room of a funeral home
while she tackles her evening job as an embalmer.  The teen
queen of 1945 is taped moaning that after she won, she "did
not even get to keep my damn tiara--I had to turn it in for
scraps."  The billboard that announces the town to drivers
has an obsolete picture of its "oldest living Lutheran," but the
mayor groans that "sons of bitches would not even remove
the sign."  Two enormously fat guys--one a judge, the other
his mentally challenged brother--slap each other around for a
while.  A dance instructor teaches the teens their steps while
dangling a cigarette from her lips.  Later, when one of the
other judges, disgusted with the disabled man's behavior,
asks rhetorically, "Why don't you leave him with a sitter," he
gets the answer, "That's not nice--you know the sitter is
dead."  And when Amber's trailer mysteriously catches fire,
her mom, Annette Atkins (Ellen Barkin), is seriously burned,
her can of beer soldered to her hand.  
   One of the questions asked of the contestants by a judge is
"If you were a tree in the forest, what would it be?"  Here's
another one--for the production team: "If you were asked to
turn out a comedy, when do you think you could arrange it?"

     A lot of funny things probably go on backstage at any given beauty
contest, but obviously writer Lona Williams never heard about any of
them. Instead of offering any kind of juicy details -- we all knew about
how contestants put Vaseline on their teeth to brighten their smiles,
thank you -- her screenplay for "Drop Dead Gorgeous" merely trots out a
bunch of cliched characters, saddles them with Minnesota acents and
expects hilarity to follow.
With its conniving mothers and star-struck daughters, "Gorgeous"
begs unflattering comparisons to two other similar and far superior
films, both directed by Michael Ritchie. His outrageously funny "Smile"
stands as the last word on teen pageants, while his "The Positively True
Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom," a 1993 HBO movie starring
Holly Hunter as the kook who went to prison for attempting to hire
killers to ensure her kid made the cheerleading squad, had an edginess
and spark that's nowhere to be found here.
Clumsily directed by Michael Patrick Jann, "Gorgeous" offers a
mock-documentary look at what happens when girls from the opposite sides
of the social scale compete for the title of Sarah Rose Cosmetics
American Teen Princess. Rebecca Leeman (Denise Richards) is a well-to-do
beauty whose dad owns a furniture store, while Amber Atkins (Kirsten
Dunst) works afterschool as a beautician in a funeral home to help pay
the bills. Rebecca's mom Gladys (a tired-looking Kirstie Alley) is
snippy and snobbish; Amber's mom Annette (Ellen Barkin, in yet another
role unworthy of her) is crude and boozy. Williams, from the evidence
onscreen, never met a stereotype she couldn't embrace.
But it's not a crime to use stereotypes in a comedy if you can find
something amusing for them to say, as David E. Kelley did in "Lake
Placid." Williams, however, thinks we should be tickled just by the mere
mention of cow-tipping, lutefisk and Melissa Manchester. At one point,
fire sweeps through the Atkins' trailer and Amber reports all their
clothes "melted together, forming a big polyester meteor in our closet."
Poor people living in trailer parks and wearing polyester -- pretty
witty stuff, this.
In some kind of attempt to top "There's Something About Mary,"
"Gorgeous" also includes a mentally challenged character who bumps into
things and plays with himself in front of the contestants. It also makes
several slaps at Lutherans, with an organization called the Lutheran
Sisterhood Gun Club and a joke about the Lutheran church being holier
the Catholic church because "Lutherans use grape Kool-Aid for the blood
of Christ." To show us how stupid and trashy people are in Minnesota,
Williams has them chew tobacco, smoke incessantly and say "you betcha"
as often as possible.
Lost in this mess are a couple of respectable performances by
Richards and Dunst, the only people in the movie who seem to understand
that playing comedy does not mean you have to shout frequently and
exaggerate every gesture. Dunst, remembered as the creepy child from
"Interview With the Vampire," has turned into a highly likable young
actress, and Richards is spotlighted in one of the film's few funny
scenes, a bizarre moment involving a Frankie Valli song and an effigy of
Jesus Christ. Most of the rest of "Drop Dead Gorgeous" simply falls
flat.

Drop Dead Gorgeous * * * 1/2 (out of * * * * )
Directed by Michael Patrick Jann.
Cast: Kirsten Dunst, Denise Richards, Kirstie Alley, Ellen Barkin, Allison 
Janney, Sam McMurray, Brittany Murphy, Amy Adams, Mindy Sterling, Matt

Rated PG-13 (for violence, profanity, and non-stop offensiveness).
Reviewed July 24, 1999.
"Drop Dead Gorgeous" may be a breakthrough in mainstream comedy. The first 
standard-made faux-documentary to be released wide, the typicals of the film 
are anything but standard, as it manages to grab almost non-stop jokes out of 
the red-hot, fast, and furious screenplay by Lona Williams, many of which are 
more offensive--and hilarious--than, dare I say it, "American Pie" or "South 
Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut." Like 1997's marvelous mockumentary, "Waiting 
for Guffman," "Drop Dead Gorgeous" captures small-town life dead-on, but with 
an obvious satiric edge, and is entertaining from the first frame to the last.
At the outset, we are told that a documentary crew has travelled to the 
sleepy farming town of Mount Rose, Minnesota to make a film about the 
upcoming annual Mount Rose Miss Teen Princess America Pageant. Preparation is 
well underway for the nine contestants, all of which we get to meet through 
the course of the film. The shoo-in to win is stuck-up Becky Leeman (Denise 
Richards), whose wealthy mother, Gladys (Kirstie Alley), is a former Mount 
Rose Pageant winner, and who is the president of this year's festivities. 
Becky's obvious main opponent happens to be Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst), an 
innocent soul who lives in a trailer home with her beer-guzzling, caring 
mother, Annette (Ellen Barkin), and often practices her tap-dancing steps at 
work--as she puts make-up on the corpses at a funeral home. Amber's main 
motive for entering the pageant in the first place is because she sees it as 
her only way of getting out of Mount Rose, and dreams of being the next Diane 
Sawyer. However, being the back-stabber that Becky is, there is no hiding the 
fact that she will stop at nothing to triumph over everyone else, even if 
that means murdering some of the other contestants. Meanwhile, we are told, 
the documentarians are required to act as merely spectators, and cannot get 
involved in the goings-on that are occurring around them.
"Drop Dead Gorgeous," vibrantly directed by Michael Patrick Jann, pulls out 
all the stops to give us one of the most snappy, biting comedies to come out 
in some time, and that the film is rated PG-13 is rather amazing considering 
some of the sure-to-be-controversial story elements. Taking its cue from 
1974's similar teen beauty pageant movie, "Smile," which may have been more 
realistic but is nowhere near as amusing, director Jann and writer Williams 
will do anything for a good, hearty laugh, even if it means going over into 
the bad-taste arena, and it serves up enough fresh, saucy ideas for two 
movies. 
The plot thickens when Amber receives a picture in her school locker of one 
of the recently-deceased ex-contestants, with the words, "You're Next," 
sprawled along the back. Soon after, her trailer home mysteriously explodes 
with her mother inside. Luckily, Annette survives (she luckily landed in a 
flower-bed) and is just sent to the hospital, albeit with a severely burnt 
hand that has a beer can welded to it. Amber understandably begins to fear 
for her own life, but is convinced by her mother and mother's best friend, 
Loretta (Allison Janney), to carry on. The pageant itself is the centerpiece 
of the film, and it is a true show-stopper, with last year's Mount Rose 
princess, currently residing in a wellness home for anorexics, coming 
on-stage in a wheelchair and an IV machine by her side to lip-sync a song. 
Call it sacrilegious, but another hilariously off-kilter scene has one of the 
contestant coming out for the talent section and singing "You're Just Too 
Good to Be True," as she serenades and dances with a dummy of Jesus on the 
cross.
The cast is uniformly excellent across the board, particularly 17-year-old 
Kirsten Dunst, as the sweet Amber, who, no doubt about it, has one of the 
brightest acting futures ahead of her for anyone in her age group. Dunst 
constantly chooses interesting, intelligent roles and does not conform to 
anything she doesn't believe in. She also has proven that she can perform in 
any genre and will sparkle, and here she does just that in one of her few 
comedic roles (although briefly appearing in 1997's comedy satire, "Wag the 
Dog"). As Amber's nemesis, Becky, Denise Richards plays her bitchy role 
perfectly, even though she isn't given nearly as much to do as Dunst. She 
sure can carry a shotgun well, though! Kirstie Alley, like Richards' 
character, is extremely spiteful, but also very funny, especially in the 
final section of the picture, when her character goes right off the deep end. 
Ellen Barkin, as well as the irreplacable queen of quirky supporting roles, 
Allison Janney, add a certain warmth to their scenes, as Amber's loving 
family and confidants ("It was never hid from me," says Amber 
matter-of-factly, "that my dad put work over family. After all, once a carny, 
always a carny."). Also in notable smaller roles is Matt Malloy, as one of 
the slimy judges who is constantly trying to hide from the camera that he has 
a thing for underage girls; Will Sasso ("Mad TV") as another of the judge's 
retarded grown sons; Amy Adams as a good-hearted, if flaky, pageant 
contestant who tells Amber if she dies, to "be sure to cover up the hickeys 
on my neck, and ears, and upper thighs;" and Brittany Murphy, as the upbeat, 
giggly Lisa, another Mount Rose Teen Princess hopeful.
Topped with a memorable, catchy soundtrack, successful documentary-like 
cinematography, by Michael Spiller, and an endless stream of laugh-inducing, 
outrageous dialogue, "Drop Dead Gorgeous" is a huge comic winner, and one of 
the best times at the movies I've had all year. The offensive (to some) 
subject matter is sometimes mean-spirited, but doesn't get so bad as to 
become repugnant, and balancing out the savage comedy is a big, warm heart. 
Amber (who, in her spare time, visits and cares for the current anorexic 
Pageant winner), Annette (who hopes that her daughter will be able to follow 
her dreams and not end up like her in a dead-end existence), and Loretta (who 
doesn't have a true family but acts as a sort of loving surrogate mother for 
Amber) are such likable people, and an endearing combination, that you find 
yourself very much rooting for them, and wondering just why Becky and Gladys 
and the other spoiled sports of Mount Rose couldn't all just get along.

Like the wonderful, and superior, Waiting For Guffman, this
mock documentary exploring what goes on behind the scenes of a beauty
pageant pricks the pretensions and narrow attitudes of small town
America.  First time feature director Michael Patrick Jann uses the
tired fake documentary formula to explore the bitchiness, ruthless
ambition and drive that occurs backstage at a beauty pageant.
However, this satire of what actually happens behind the scenes of
beauty pageants lacks the sharp writing, biting humour, and genuine
wit that shaped Michael Ritchie's under rated Smile (1975), which
explored similar material.
For fifty years the Miss Mount Rose Beauty pageant has been a
highlight of this small rural township in Minnesota.  But this year
seems to bring out the worst in its competitors.  A string of
mysterious fatal accidents knock some of the early competitors out of
the race, even before the judging starts.  And a film crew is there to
capture it all.
In this year's pageant, the competition for first prize ends
up as a two horse race between two girls from different backgrounds.
Becky Leeman (Denise Richards, from Wild Things, and the forthcoming
new Bond film) is the ambitious and fiercely competitive daughter of
Gladys (Kirstie Alley), herself a former winner and now head of the
organising committee for the pageant.  Becky has had everything
virtually handed to her on a silver platter, and hates losing.  Her
main rival is Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst, from Interview With The
Vampire, etc), a "piece of white trash" who lives in a run down
trailer park with her mother (Ellen Barkin), an alcoholic hairdresser.
The differences between these two rivals is explored with the
distinct lack of subtlety that is a hallmark of the film.  The two
younger stars deliver quite engaging performances that lift the film a
notch or two.  They comprehensively outshine the rather tired and
lacklustre performances of veterans Alley and Barkin, neither of whom
seem overly enthusiastic about the material.
There are some genuinely funny moments in this black comedy,
but they are far and few between.  Instead, Jann offers us some
tasteless running gags and a number of gross-out gags that would seem
second rate even to the Farrelly brothers.
Like the recent Election, Drop Dead Gorgeous also offers a
comment on the American ethos of success and winning, whatever the
cost.  Jann's direction lacks focus, although some of the film's barbs
manage to strike home.  Drop Dead Gorgeous also offers a quick,
stereotyped portrait of small town America and its inhabitants, and
little escapes unscathed.  Ultimately, though, is seems that the
filmmakers are mainly retreading familiar territory without offering
anything fresh or original.

"If you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be?" asks the deadly
serious judge.  It's the start of the local contest for Miss Teen
Princess America in Mount Rose, Minnesota (population 5,076).  The
absolutely-confident-of-victory Rebecca Leeman (Denise Richards) whips
out an answer guaranteed to please the judges, who were most likely
handpicked by her mother, Gladys Leeman (Kirstie Alley), a previous
winner.  Becky's tree would have a good, solid Christian trunk and
provide shade for the handicapped.  (There is also something about
providing for world peace and fighting world hunger, I believe.  You can
only write so fast at a screening, and this movie literally bursts with
creative wit.)
As deftly directed by Michael Patrick Jann and brightly scripted by Lona
Williams, DROP DEAD GORGEOUS is a chirpy satire done, ŕ la WAITING FOR
GUFFMAN, as a pseudo-documentary.  The actors play every scene with
complete earnestness, which adds immensely to the comedic effect.  The
biting, sardonic script works on both the verbal and the visual level.
Becky, for example, dances in a costume that has a Mount Rushmore
headdress with her head sandwiched between Teddy Roosevelt and Abraham
Lincoln.  She remarks that only in America could we make an old mountain
handsome by carving on it.
The ensemble casting has eight contestants vying for the local title.
The script and the direction outshine the cast, although all of the
acting is quite good.
With food as big as the vast Minnesota farmland, the locals are a
well-fed lot.  One older contest winner brags in a commercial that she
couldn't have done it without the help of St. Paul Pork Products.  More
recent winners seem to have taken a different attitude toward their food
intake.  Last year's winner, for example, now resides at the Dakota
County Eating Disorders Clinic and has to be wheeled onto the stage this
year by her nurse since she is too weak to walk.  Her secret to winning
included a 400-calorie a day regiment and lots of hard work.
The all-American city where the movie takes place is the home of the
oldest living Lutheran, now deceased.  Gladys tells us that it's no sin
city, as their video stores don't have any back rooms.  Guns are a
different matter.  Among many extracurricular activities, Becky is the
proud Vice President of the Lutheran Sisterhood Gun Club.  The press
kit, which manages to be almost as funny as the movie itself, provides
various definitions for the phrases used in the story.  "God given
talent" is defined to be "synonymous with the size of your gun."  By
such definitions some "talented" person is killing off and otherwise
injuring the contestants.  The script uses these incidents as just the
backdrop upon which to paint the story.
Each of the contestants for the crown and for the right to compete at
the state level has her own hilarious story.  One of the plumper ones,
whose talent is imitating dog snarls, she shares her own tragedy with
us.  Showing us her bitten side, she tells the sad story of the German
Shepherd she had to give away.  It seems that carrying beef jerky in
your pocket while walking a massive canine isn't a particularly wise
idea.
The would-be beauty queens possess a wide variety of talent to dazzle
the judges, none of whom has ever judged a contest before.  Many of
their gifts are quite unusual.  One does wrestling-match cheerleading,
and another performs dramatic readings from SOYLENT GREEN.
Becky's main competition comes from Amber (Kirsten Dunst), who practices
her tap dancing while preparing bodies at the local funeral home.
Unlike Becky and her ostentatiously rich family, Amber lives with her
traditional trailer trash mother (Ellen Barkin).
In order to enhance the documentary feel, the cameraman, interviewer and
soundman frequently are shown as if they accidentally got into the
frame.  There is never any doubt, however, as there is in 20 DATES, that
the story is completely concocted.
So who will win the contest, and how many will make it through to the
final competition?  The picture, which relishes its political
incorrectness, takes us on a fascinating journey to find out.  The only
problem with the movie is that it goes on about 10 minutes after its
natural ending point.  This last part is cute, but a crisper script
would have had a bit more impact.  In movies, especially comedies,
shorter is almost always better.  Still, this is only a minor quibble.
The film, as delivered, is a delightful, biting comedy that sets a
perfect tone and never loses it.
DROP DEAD GORGEOUS runs 1:35.  It is rated PG-13 for sexual situations,
a little violence and some profanity and would be fine for kids around
12 and up.

_Drop_Dead_Gorgeous_, writer Lona Williams and director Michael Patrick
Jann's dark mock documentary details the events leading up to Mount Rose,
Minnesota's American Teen Princess pageant, namely the rivalry between
two leading candidates: rich bitch Becky Leeman (Denise Richards),
daughter of the pageant coordinator and former Teen Princess (Kirstie
Alley); and trailer park good girl Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst), daughter
of a former runner-up (Ellen Barkin).  Williams and Jann's targets are
easy ones--pageants, Minnesotans, small towns--but the film bats a
surprisingly low hit-to-miss ratio, with the truly inspired moments (the
wheelchair-bound, anorexic reigning Teen Princess's wincingly hilarious
musical number) lost in a sea of just plain unfunny ones (Amber's mother
gets a beer can permanently fused to her hand after an explosion).  Also
a big miss is the predictable "mystery" element to the film, which has a
number of contestants meeting untimely eliminations from competition. 
Ultimately, _Drop_Dead_Gorgeous_ exhibits a lot of attitude, but not a
whole lot of smarts.
Dunst has much better luck with the _other_, much more intelligent
satire she is also currently starring in, _Dick_.  In what can be
described as "teenage Romy and Michele take down the president," teen dim
bulbs Betsy (Dunst) and Abigail (Michelle Williams) fall into the good
graces of President Nixon (Dan Hedaya) and the positions of "Official
White House Dog Walkers" after witnessing the Watergate break-in. 
Indeed, it is not the most promising of premises, but director Andrew
Fleming, along with Sheryl Longin, writing collaborator turn it into gold
by deftly weaving fact and fiction into a wholly convincing--and
hilarious--tapestry.  For instance, we learn the "true" origin of Tricky
Dick's famous stance as well as what was on those missing 18 and a half
minutes on Nixon's tapes (nothing criminal, but perhaps something more
embarrassing).  Ironically, it is those clever details that will likely
lead _Dick_ to suffer the same weak box office fate that befell another
savvy satire, last spring's _Election_--it is simply too smart (and, in
this case, too historical) for its targeted teen audience.  (_Dick_ opens
August 4)

Review: Drop Dead Gorgeous
Starring: Kirsten Dunst, Denise Richards, Kirstie Alley, Allison Janney, Ellen Barkin
Directed by Michael Patrick Jann
Well I just don't know what's wrong with this country. Drop Dead
Gorgeous is one of the funnier films I've seen this year. I guess
people get uptight about making fun of retarded people and killing
beauty queens. But all that aside, Drop Dead is dark and hilarious. It
is the ultimate anti-PC picture, an irreverant look at middle America
hicks and their "culture". The film is seen through the eyes of a
documentary film crew as they track the "Sara Rose Miss Teen Princess
America" competition in Mount Rose Minnesota. Becky (Richards) is the
favorite to win the pageant, she is pretty, perky and will cater to
all the anglo standards of womanhood (i.e. Christ worship and hospital
visits.) She also is the daughter of the wealthiest household in the
town of 5,000, a town whose hospital holds an eating disorder
wing.(One of its inhabitants is last year's winner.)  Becky's mother
Gladys (Alley) won 17 years earlier and will do anything to see to it
that Becky wins. The underdog and crowd favorite is Amber (Dunst). Her
mother (Barkin) is more interested in nicotine and beer and tips her
daughter to "get money up front if (the film crew) asks you to take
off your top".
All the girls in the town who even remotely qulify (or have any
interest in qualifying) for the pageant compete for the crown. Each is
their own whacky character. One is an adoptee of a Japanese-American
family who tries desperately to American-ize. Another is envious of
her beloved brother who moved to New York to impersonate Liza, Barbara
and Madonna. And one has an obsession with ceramic horses and carries
with her a large bolt that hit her in the head (if it had hit her
length-wise, she'd have died, lucky it hit her flat.) And then there's
Amber, who works as a makeup artist for a morgue and as a cafeteria
dish-washer. Her undying enthusiasm to be Diane Sawyer brings her into
the competition.
Drop Dead Gorgeous is full of gags, both visual and verbal. Much of
the added humorous components are amplified because of the documentary
approach. The realism of the documentary is totally outweighed by the
goofiness of the situations and characters. Director Jann did a lot of
double takes in an interesting fashion. He'd actually show you a joke
in a wide shot, before the punchline arrived, then go back to it for a
focus and punchline. In other words, if you were a sharp viewer, you
could see a joke coming before it actually got there, in essence
getting two laughs out of the same joke! Something that is rare and
risky is pulled off beautifully here.
Barkin is absolutely perfect as the trailer trash mother to Amber. She
plays most of the film with a beer can melted into her right hand as a
result of a trailer explosion which reeked of foul play. She is truly
a joy to watch as her Minnesotian/Dakotan accent is made funnier by
her little asides. Her best moment is during the actual pageant as she
sits doped up for the pain, she makes faces throughout that are
priceless. Dunst too gives a great performance and shows a real talent
for comedy. Drop Dead Gorgeous certainly deserves a wider audience and
will probably shock a lot of people, both because of its content and
because they probably didn't expect it to be this good.

CrankyCriticŽ movie reviews: Drop Dead Gorgeous
Rated [PG-13], 95 minutes
Starring Kirstie Alley, Ellen Barkin, Kirsten Dunst, Denise Richards
Screenplay by Lona Williams
Directed by Michael Patrick Jann
website: http://www.ddgorgeous.com
We've seen more than an average number of satirical movies this year,
some of which have been extremely sharp-edged and witty, packed with the
kind of black humor that Cranky likes. Somewhere in the middle is Drop
Dead Gorgeous, uses the mockucumentary style made famous in the
groundbreaking This is Spinal Tap and takes aim at a fictional Teen
Beauty pageant. DDG is set in lovely Mount Rose, Minnesota, a
God-fearing town where the good girls see the Sarah Rose American Teen
Princess®© Pageant as a coming of age obligation and
potential ticket out of their dead-end town. The bad girls, for your
information -- pierced, drunk and pregnant social misfits all -- hang
out hang in school bathrooms to smoke their cigarettes and wait for
their water to break.
As the COPS-style documentary crew films the festivities, we meet ten
good girls of St. Rose, all of whom have reasons for being in the
pageant and all of whom know that the fix is in favoring Becky Leeman
(Denise Richards) the daughter of the richest family in town. Her mom
Gladys (Kirstie Ally) won the pageant seventeen years earlier and has
groomed Becky to inherit the tradition. Mom is also the organizer of the
preliminary contest, and has selected a panel of malleable judges. It's
pretty much a done deal. Problem is, there are two talented teens who
actually have a chance of winning on merit alone.
Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst) is the trailer trash girl who serves up
lunch in the high school and carries a second job applying makeup to the
corpses in the city morgue. Not only does she have talent with a brush,
the isolation of the dead zone provides a wonderful arena to practice
her tap dancing talent and dream that she can follow the same career
path as her idol, ex-beauty pageant contestant Diane Sawyer. As the
documentary crew filming this Fiftieth Anniversary pageant documents,
the prime contenders in the pageant and the male contender for Amber's
heart bite the dust in quick, accidental succession. Could this be some
kind of bleak conspiracy? Gee, you think?
Of the over-twenties in the cast, Kirstie Alley does a lovely
Fargo-style accent but Ellen Barkin, as Amber's mom, eclipses almost any
white trash femme role Cranky can recall and graphically demonstrates
how a can of beer can be both best friend and/or the bane of trailer
trash existence. Barkin is almost topped by Allison Janney as her
incredibly horny best friend. Yes, there are men in this flick. The
setting being Minnesota, there must be a town moron, and that role is
hysterically filled by MadTV's Will Sasso, who proves there is life
after Corky and the Juice Pigs.
Of the kidlets, Dunst is by far the star of the show. Her character
innocently battles all odds, and even with the blatant attacks against
her home, her potential boyfriend, her mom and her stage gear, she keeps
a fairly stiff upper lip. Just the kind of character you root for. When
the fix comes down, lets just say the ultimate resolution doesn't mark
the end of the movie. No, Amber doesn't do the All American thing and
grab a twenty aught seven and blow away the cheating bitch who stole
what was rightfully hers. The resolution is even bleaker, blacker and
funnier. Unfortunately, bring the tale to its logical conclusion means
it keeps going long after you're ready for it to be over.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Drop Dead Gorgeous,  he would have
paid...
pay per view range. I can't get enthusiastic enough to reco your
spending the big bucks for a theater ticket. It's territory that has
been mined on teevee before, and is probably where Drop Dead Gorgeous
should be seen even now.
 Parodying the guns and religion mentality (well that's how us Godless
city folk look at rural Minnesota -- Mary Tyler Moore lived in the big
sinful city, don'tcha know) Drop Dead Gorgeous delivers an adequate
satire whose writing is a lot sharper than its direction and production
values let on. Fact of the matter is that Spinal Tap did it first, did
it better, and there have been enough similar teevee movie tales of
dismal doings behind the main curtain that there isn't much new in the
way of parody of the event. The script by Lona Williams allows the
characters to slip in lots of sly gags, most of which strike out like a
Wendy Liebman punchline on top of another punchline. Would that there
were more.
