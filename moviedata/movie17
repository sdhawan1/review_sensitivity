I suppose that the seamless blend of animated cartoon characters and real
live actors on the big screen was a pretty big deal back in 1988, when WHO
FRAMED ROGER RABBIT captured the nation's attention. But nowadays, with the
incredible innovations in computer generated imagery, DVD and the
mind-blowing effects in films like THE MATRIX and THE PHANTOM MENACE, it
takes a little more to get us excited, right? Allrighty-then...how's about
producing yet another remake of an old, cheezy cartoon television series,
but this time, mix in some live-action folks and see how that plays. Sound
like a good idea?
PLOT:
After having been cancelled from television back in the 1960s, TV cartoon
characters Rocky and Bullwinkle are left to dwindle their lives away in
their animated world of Frostbite Falls, until their nefarious counterparts,
Boris, Natasha and Fearless Leader escape, and take a live-action leap into
today's real world. It isn't long before the cartoon two-some are summoned
by a rookie FBI agent in the hopes of squishing Fearless Leader's maniacal
plot to become the president of the United States.
CRITIQUE:
A very cartoony film with a quick pace, may be suited for fans of the old
series, but falls flat within today's comedic standards set by the Simpsons,
with many unfunny goofy puns, easy jokes and childish pranks. Strangely
enough, many of the jokes in this film are geared towards adults with many
play-on-words and literal interpretations, but at the same time, the film is
more than obviously meant for children, with a silly plot, over-the-top bad
guys and oh-so simple humor ("Allow me to be frank with you" - "Oh hullo
Frank, I'm Bullwinkle"). Yeesh! Yet another COPS parody also didn't twirl my
nipples, and neither did half a million Bullwinkle misinterpretations, which
I suppose were meant to be funny, but just left me feeling kind of,
well...bored. I'll admit that I was never much of a fan of the original TV
series on which this film is based (if I was flipping the channels and it
was on, I generally tuned it for a bit, but that was about it), but I reckon
that most kids who will go see this movie, would not have seen it either, so
let's just hope that they "get it". Personally, I wasn't taken by either of
the two leads, be it Rocky or Bullwinkle, and I especially didn't care for
the dim-witted aspect of the Moose. Oh, I get it...he's stupid, so that's
funny!
To be fair, I did hear quite a few people laughing in my audience, but even
then, most of them were adults. I suppose that if you're in "the mood" and
appreciate the "Bullwinkle humor", then you might enjoy this film, which to
its credit, doesn't take itself seriously for a moment, and sure doesn't
pretend to be about anything either. It's a cartoon movie with some
live-action stars intermixed. In the end, the film will either work for you
or not depending on your connection to the humor. The film's first 20
minutes are probably its most ambitious, with an excellent explanation of
how the badly drawn duo from the 60s got to be the better-looking 3D
animation characters in the year 2000. There is also a pretty cool sequence
featuring Bullwinkle literally "surfing the Internet" near the end, but
other than that, the effects did little to impress me. The film is also
filled with plenty of cameos (see below), most of which feature actors whose
best work is long behind them, and also stars a cute Britney Spears wannabee
FBI agent, who I've never heard of before, but from whom I wouldn't mind
hearing again! Robert DeNiro must've taken a little less than a week to film
his scenes, because he's barely in the film, while Alexander and Russo both
perform admirably as the notorious No-Goodniks from Pottsylvania, Boris and
Natasha. But in the end, without much to impress me visually, without much
humor to make me laugh, and without much of a story (granted, the film is a
cartoon, you don't really expect much there), the film didn't do much for
me.
But who knows, others may just enjoy it on their own level as an empty,
frivolous, campy (funny to some), children's cartoon. And for anyone who
wants to tell me to "lighten up", I'd be more than happy to accept your
directive. I'll be the one watching yet another hilarious episode of TV's
"The Simpsons". Now, there's some real humor!
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
This film does manage to spoof a couple of other famous movies, including a
flying scene straight out of SUPERMAN, and the infamous "you talkin' to me"
scene from TAXI DRIVER, interpreted once again, by the man who helped make
those words immortal in the first place, Robert DeNiro.
Several star cameos line this film including Janeane Garofalo, Carl Reiner,
Jonathan Winters (playing three different parts), Whoopie Goldberg, Billy
Crystal, David Alan Grier and John Goodman.
Look for DeNiro's own daughter in this film, Drena DeNiro, in a small part
as a RBTV lackey. She is actually his daughter through adoption. She is
Diahnne Abbott's real daughter from a previous marriage. DeNiro adopted her
when he was married to Abbott from 1976-1988.
Director Des McAnuff was originally a stage director, and the man
responsible for bringing The Who's "Tommy" to Broadway. His first foray into
film directing came in 1998 when he directed COUSIN BETTE starring Jessica
Lange. He also produced last year's critically acclaimed animated feature
THE IRON GIANT.
Rumor has it that "Simpsons" creator Matt Groening inserted the infamous "J"
in Homer J. Simpson's name as an homage to Rocky & Bullwinkle, whose full
names are Rocky J. Squirrel and Bullwinkle J. Moose. Their middle "J" comes
from creator Jay Ward's own name.
So what has the Britney Spears-like actress (aka Piper Perabo) of this film
done besides this, you may ask? Well, actually not much, although she is one
of the stars in that all-girl sexy, momma-jomma film coming out in August,
COYOTE UGLY, so stay tuned!
Executive producer Tiffany Ward is Jay Ward's daughter. Jay Ward is the
creator of the series upon which this film is based, as well as the man
behind the characters in GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE and DUDLEY DO-RIGHT.
June Foray, the original voice behind Rocky, is back as the voice of the
flying squirrel in this film. Australian comedian-mimic Keith Scott voices
both Bullwinkle and the film's omnipresent, wry narrator.
Screenwriter Kenneth Lonergan also co-wrote the DeNiro comedy ANALYZE THIS.

Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.
     THE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE is _not_ a bloated big-screen
vehicle that misses the point of its source material entirely. Indeed, the
opening five minutes represent a surprsingly clever brand of
self-awareness, the kind that promises a brisk and satisfying stroll dose
of cartoon nostalgia. From the outset, it's clear that this is Jay Ward's
Rocky and Bullwinkle, complete with adult references, howlingly awful puns
and still more howlingly awful puns. Could this finally be the kind of
live-action cartoon Hollywood has been trying to make for years, only to
botch the job over and over again?
     Believe me, I wanted to get giddy over THE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY AND
BULLWINKLE, which opens with protagonists Rocket J. Squirrel and
Bullwinkle J. Moose. (voiced by original Rocky June Foray and Keith Scott,
respectively) living tedious animated lives in Frostbite Falls, Minnesota
35 years after the cancellation of their television series. Their
arch-nemeses Boris Badenov, Natasha Fatale and Fearless Leader have been
similarly stuck in re-runs, until Fearless Leader formulates a plan to get
them yanked into the real world. The now-real Leader (Robert DeNiro),
Boris (Jason Alexander) and Natasha (Rene Russo) then develop a scheme for
world domination through stupefyingly bad television, and it appears that
nothing can stand in their way. Unless, that is, wet-behind-the-ears FBI
agent Karen Sympathy (Piper Perabo) can yank a pair of cartoon animals
into reality to save the day.
     The aforementioned prologue gets ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE off to a fast
start, with Keith Scott doing amusing work both as Bullwinkle and 
replacing William Conrad as the narrator. The opening sets up Frostbite 
Falls as an animated ghost town, its economy left in a shambles when the
moose and squirrel's show got the axe; even the narrator has been reduced
to commenting dramatically on events in his home after being forced to
live with his mother. It's a funny idea, as is the idea of Fearless
Leader's plot to entrap a Hollywood producer (Janeane Garofolo) by
offering the movie rights to "Rocky and Bullwinkle." Jay Ward's cartoons
were always a strangely deft mix of smart and silly, which is a fairly
accurate description of THE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE for a few
hundred blissful seconds.
     Then, inevitably and tragically, we leave the hand-drawn world for
something considerably more drab. Whatever twisted force convinces studio
executives that THE FLINTSTONES, 101 DALMATIANS or ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE
have something more to offer us with human actors is in need of immediate
exorcising. There's something about an animated world, even a
crudely-drawn animated world, that changes the rules; Ward could get away
with groaners that would make you want to stuff a sock in a human mouth
that uttered them. It certainly doesn't help that some of the human actors
appear befuddled by the whole enterprise. Rene Russo waits for about half
an hour before she gets to utter a word of dialogue, and still looks like
she's waiting around for the rest of the film. As for newcomer Piper
Perabo, what little comedic timing she may have isn't enhanced by acting
opposite a pair of visual effects. DeNiro has fun with Fearless Leader,
but it's not nearly enough. A self-deprecating gag referring to WHO FRAMED
ROGER RABBIT? doesn't change the fact that ROGER's concept was made for
its format, and vice-versa. Rocky and Bullwinkle are cartoons in a human
world simply because they could be.
     There are more than a few decent gags in playwright Kenneth
Lonergan's script for ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE -- the title of Fearless
Leader's perfectly awful televsion series will set me to giggling for a
few days -- and a lack of bombast that makes it infinitely easier to
swallow. It's also a cheerful film that's perfectly suitable for kids,
even as it offers tidbits for adults. There's just something inescapably,
inherently wrong about turning these characters into CGI wise-crackers who
interact with Whoopi Goldberg, John Goodman and all the other cameo actors
trotted out for our knowing amusement. THE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY AND
BULLWINKLE may be close to the best live-action film that could be made
with these characters, and that's not saying much. It's time for
film-makers to stop fighting a losing battle with dragging 'toons into
mediocre realities. Call it a draw.

Somewhere in the back of my mind, in a rarely visited
location where cartoon characters that I have grown to
love but am now too old to remember, there resides a
flying squirrel and a likably dimwitted moose.  Known
as Rocky and Bullwinkle, their show was a crudely
drawn but lively post-Cold War adventure that pitted
these two against the evil machinations of three
scoundrels named Boris Badinov, Natasha, and their
fearless leader named Fearless Leader.  There was a
charming quirkiness to their episodes, which were
brutally inane and featured sharp puns and rapid-fire
humor.  It possessed a shallowness that was just right
for Saturday morning mindless fare.
It's now three decades later.  Rocky hasn't flown in
years.  Bullwinkle laments about the disappearing
woodlands throughout his home of Frostbite Falls.  And
our three villains are trapped in an endless cycle of
reruns.  But in the world of cartoons, anything is
possible.  Fearless Leader literally reaches out to a
hungry movie executive to ink a movie deal.  Suddenly,
the three of them emerge as flesh-and-blood people
(Jason Alexander as Boris, Renee Russo as Natasha, and
Robert DeNiro as Fearless Leader).  Free of their
two-dimensional cartoon world and from Rocky and
Bullwinkle, they now see an opportunity to hatch their
latest plan to rule the world.
Fearless Leader and his band begin to build a
television cable empire called RBTV (Really Bad
Television).  It will be filled with programs that are
so bad that the viewing audience will be turned into
zombies susceptible to hypnotic suggestion.  The
public will be told go out and vote in Fearless Leader
as the new President in the next election.  This is a
plan worthy of Pinky and the Brain (you know, one is a
genius and the other's insane).
Out to stop them is FBI agent Karen Sympathy (Piper
Perabo) who is a soft, squishy, lovey-dovey,
idealistic kind of gal.  She enlists the help of Rocky
(voiced, as in the original, by June Foray) and
Bullwinkle (voiced by Keith Scott), and together, they
try to save the world.  Their travels are filled with
absurd occurrences and pun-filled banter.  At one
point when the three are being approached by a group
of security guards, Sympathy yells, "we've got to get
out of here," to which Bullwinkle says, "OK, let's go
to a commercial!"  We see signs that point out places
such as the Crimea River, and we pay a visit to
Bullwinkle's alma mater, Wossamotta U.   All of this
silliness is fine up to a certain point, which is
about the first 20 minutes.  However, the novelty soon
wears thin.
Give credit, though, to the live cast members and all
of the cameos who deliver over-the-top acting to lend
to its cartoonish personality.  Especially good is
DeNiro who seemed to be having endless fun as Fearless
Leader.  He speaks with an almost-impenetrable accent
and even takes a turn at parodying the "you looking at
me" line made famous from his role in "Taxi Driver." 
Alas, "Rocky and Bullwinkle" just doesn't give even
the inner child in us enough to sustain an 85-minute
film.  The story just doesn't go anywhere and we start
to wonder if we're watching one of Fearless Leader's
RBTV programs.  There's a scene in this film that
pretty much sums up the film's viewing experience.  At
Wossamotta U., students are protesting during a speech
given by Bullwinkle.  However, his speech is so inane
that students find that they had nothing to object to.
 It's equally loony yet insipid, hollow yet harmless.

The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle (2000)
I don't think you would turn over in your grave if you saw the new 
incarnation of your 1960's cartoon.  The actor Robert DeNiro and a friend of 
his produced The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, and they did a pretty 
good job.  DeNiro took the role of Fearless Leader for himself, and he 
brings it off well.  Why?  Because he does it with a lot of humor and is not 
afraid to send up even himself (in a `You talking to me?' takeoff of his 
Travis Bickle role in Taxi Driver).  Funny stuff
I like that Des McAnuff, the director, makes the humans play second fiddle 
to the animated stars.  The rounded, smooth, balloon-like skin of the 
animated flying squirrel and the bird-brained moose adds a very watchable 
dimension.  You would be glad to hear that June Foray is back as Rock's 
voice, that unique, thinly hoarse touch intact.  And since you can't do the 
moose, Australian Keith Scott is a great second choice; he also does the 
narrator, with a flair just short of the talent of William Conrad.  Anyhoo, 
the `Moose and Skvorl!' were the funniest and noblest characters in the 
piece.
I don't understand.  Why would that Minnie Mogul (Janeane Garofalo) the 
movie producer want to deal with Fearless Leader and his gang anyway?  She 
surely wouldn't do it for the money!  Suddenly Fearless Leader is real 
(played by Bobby DeNiro, I think), and Boris Badenov (Jason Alexander) and 
Natasha Fatale (Rene Russo) are out to turn the television viewers of 
American into mindless zombies!  What a silly idea, losing the ability to 
think because you watch too much television!  Rocky and I were just 
wandering around Frostbite Falls Minnesota, where all the trees were cut 
down and the cartoon population were all out of work, our cartoon 
`messterpiece' canceled back in 1964.  So something really realistic had to 
happen, and sure enough, this nice-looking blond FBI agents (the FBI has a 
lot like her, I'd wager!) named Karen Sympathy (Piper Perabo) magically gets 
Rock and me to appear in Hollywood.  What she wants us to do is get to New 
York City in time to stop Fearless Leader from making his final broadcast, 
in which he plans to zombify the whole country, and get them to vote for him 
for President!  What a ride (car ride, that is) Rock and I have ahead of us 
 although I still can't figure out why we couldn't have gotten ahold or a 
plane or something else.  After all, Boris and Natasha steal a helicopter 
and almost succeed in reducing me and Rock to Internet images with that 
teeny satellite computer thingy.
We'll find out today if America remembers this goofy duo.  Will it be a hit, 
like George of the Jungle, or a miss, like The Adventures of Dudley Doright? 
  (At least we don't have to pay Bredan Fraser's salary again!)  Although I 
wonder about getting really talented actors like Rene Russo and Jason 
Alexander, and then underusing them.  After all, who did you see more of in 
the cartoon  here Fearless Leader gets more lines than Boris and Natasha 
combined!  And what about this side plot in which the agent and our heroes 
go on trial.  It's not a bad punch line with the moose, but the whole arrest 
things drags just a bit, I think.  In a sequel, if we get the box office to 
pitch one, it'll be more action and even more bad puns.  So I brought my own 
kids to the preview, and they loved it.  We saw every age from babies to 
baby boomers in the theater.  I just hope not all theaters keep jacking up 
the prices: our neighborhood multiplex (is that an oxymoron?) raised 
admission to $4.50 for matinees!

 The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle (2000) 1 star out of 4. Starring
Rocket J. Squirrel, Bullwinkle the Moose, Renee Russo, Jason Alexander,
Robert De Niro, Piper Perabo and Randy Quaid. Special guest appearances
by Jonathan Winters, Carl Reiner, Whoopi Goldberg and Janeane Garofalo.
Written by Kenneth Lonergan. Music by Mark Motherrsbaugh. Directed by
Des McAnuff.
 I wish I could report that "The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle" was
a funny as the TV show. Heck, I wish I could report that it was as funny
as "Me, Myself & Irene."
 Unfortunately, "The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle" plays like it
was produced by people who don't have a clue about the TV show.
It's as if they watched a couple of episodes and failed to get the joke.
 Even as a kid, I grasped that "Rocky and His Friends," as the show was
first called, was not your typical children's cartoon show.
It was hip. You could tell that by the puns, the pop culture references
and the sometimes subversive satire that the show was aimed at a more
sophisticated audience.
 Where does "The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle" go wrong? Oh, where
to begin.
 While Bullwinkle traverses the proceedings in his usual endearing
thick-headed oblivion, Rocky is given a severe case of hero angst.
 Because he has been out of commission for 35 years, Rocky doubts his
ability to once again take to the air. Our champion has developed a fear
about flying.
 Rubbish. Rocket J. Squirrel was - and is - the eternal optimist, never
hesitating the right a wrong or battle villainy.
 The film's other drawbacks lie in its plot as well as with Rocky and
Bullwinkle's new, live-action sidekick.
 The storyline has those dastardly villains from Pottsylvania, Boris,
Natasha and Fearless Leader, jumping from their animated selves to the
live action world.
 Fearless Leader concocts a plan to take over the United States by
creating a TV network, RBTV (Real Bad TV), which will show programs so
awful they will zombify viewers so that F.L. can control their minds and
hypnotize them into electing him president.
 The idea would have been a fine one for the 1960s or '70s, but
obviously Fearless Leader did not channel surf or he would have seen
Jerry Springer, WWF wresting or the Home Shopping Network.
 Meanwhile, eager, young, childlike FBI agent Karen Sympathy (Piper
Perabo) recruits Rocky and Bullwinkle from a depressed Frostbite Falls,
and transports them to the real world to thwart Fearless Leader's plot.
 Here is where Kenneth Lonergan's script makes a wrong turn, for instead
of concentrating on Moose, Squirrel, Boris and Natasha, "The Adventures
of Rocky and Bullwinkle" becomes a road movie, with hour dynamic duo -
plus Sympathy - driving cross-country from Los Angeles to New York for
the final confrontation.
 Along the way, Boris and Natasha, trying to `kill Moose and Squirrel,'
but their efforts in the real world are as inept as in cartoon land.
 You know a movie is in trouble when its funniest moments are the
over-the-top, overwrought narration. Even the punlike word play between
Rocky and Bullwinkle lacks some of the luster of the TV series.
 Some of Bullwinkle's puns hit their target, but they are so few and far
between, you can snooze while awaiting them.
 Jason Alexander and Renee Russo are adequate as the live-action Boris
and Natasha, mostly keeping in the character of their cartoon
counterparts. Unfortunately, they are given very little to do. And the
sight of the two sitting in a Jacuzzi, sipping champagne is totally out
of character.
 The novelty of Robert De Niro's performance as Fearless Leader quickly
wears thin. De Niro has one wonderful scene in which he spoofs the most
famous movie line he ever uttered. But, again, it is too little.
 Perabo, as Karen Sympathy, is just terrible. She acts as if she's in a
high school drama club. Every time she's on the screen, you want to
slink down in your seat until she exits.
  "The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle" will have trouble finding an
audience. It is not funny or cartoonish enough for the younger set,
while it is too slow and weak for an older crowd. And the baby boomers
for whom it is aimed, will probably feel disappointment at the manner in
which their childhood idols are handled.
 "The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle" is a major misfire. The only
ones who should be happy are Boris and Natasha. Universal Pictures
finally succeeded where they always failed - they destroyed Moose and
Squirrel.

Pity the poor toons stuck with such two-dimensional, (so-called)
live-action figures in Des McAnuff's THE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY AND
BULLWINKLE.  The toons, namely the ever lovable Rocky and Bullwinkle of
1960's television cartoon fame, make the most of their lines, but it
isn't enough to save the picture from such wooden performances by the
human actors.
The worst of the lot are Jason Alexander and Rene Russo as live-action
versions of cartoon villains Boris and Natasha.  (Why Rocky and
Bullwinkle are animated but their nemeses aren't makes little sense, of
course, even if the movie provides a plot contrivance to explain it.)
Alexander and Russo are as wooden and awkward as Al Gore and Calvin
Coolidge would be as a comedy duo attempting a slapstick routine on
vaudeville.  Alexander and Russo are rarely funny and frequently
embarrassing.  Worst of all, their characters focus the story away from
the squirrel and moose, who are delightful when the movie gives them a
chance.
The most miserable performance however is turned in by Robert De Niro
who plays arch villain Fearless Leader.  He overacts with a vengeance
worthy of Chevy Chase on a bad day.  And since he produced the film one
can only assume that he likes the way it was developed.
The movie has lots of jokes, many of which are aimed at Hollywood
insiders and others which go by so fast that the vast majority of the
audience will miss them entirely.  One sequence involves breaking into
the Green Light machine at Phony Pictures in order to get Rocky and
Bullwinkle out of reruns -- where they earn 3 1/2 cents per paycheck for
residuals -- and back on the air.  Go ahead.  Ask your kids about the
definition of "residuals" and "green lighting."
The names are fun.  The human hero is FBI Agent Karen Sympathy (Piper
Perabo).  Get it?  Care and sympathy.  Don't worry if you didn't.  My
family didn't either until I explained it to them in the car on the way
home.  Most of the movie is like that -- lots of missed opportunities.
For every joke that works, there are dozens of others that miss their
marks.
Other more obvious names are those of the President's army leaders which
include General Store and General Admission.  Town names are cute too.
In the town of Cow Tip, Oklahoma the little theater is currently showing
Love Story 2000.
The dastardly deed this time involves Fearless Leader's RBTV (Really Bad
Television).  Once the master control dial for it has been turned to
"zombification," all of America will be enslaved and will vote on
command for Fearless Leader.  Bullwinkle remarks that even with RBTV,
television is just as good as ever, something that struck a chord with
me after watching a lot of television recently when I was laid up with a
virus.
Most of the film's most effective humorous moments are provided by the
numskull moose.  Bullwinkle, rambling on, decides that two wrongs don't
make a right, but two rights do make a U-turn.
The humans do get one truly funny bit of dialog.  When Boris gets the
"press any key to continue" error message on his killer computer, he
can't get it to fire in time.  "Which one is the 'any' key?" he asks in
a panic.
After one of his many failed attempts at humor, Fearless Leader adds,
parenthetically, "that was just a little joke."  That, however, is the
problem with the entire film.  It is just a little joke.  That they
could make Rocky and Bullwinkle into a mixed animated and live-action
film is obvious.  The question that remains is "Why?"
THE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE runs 1:28.  It is rated PG for
brief mild language and would be acceptable for all ages.
My son Jeffrey, age 11, gave the movie ** 1/2.  He liked the story and
the cartoon figures but thought the action was frequently too stupid.
He made the astute observation that the film's few profanities weren't
needed, and he wasn't sure why they even bothered including them.  The
answer, of course, is that most studios have historically believed that
a G rating is a kiss of death if they are shooting for a wide audience.
Hopefully the enormously successful CHICKEN RUN, rated G, will disabuse
them of that notion forever.

I love The Rocky & Bullwinkle Show as much as anybody else. I even named
my cats Boris and Natasha. But the idea of a full-length film featuring
the flying squirrel and the 400-pound Wossamotta U. graduate brought
chills to my spine. Not good chills, either. See, the whole appeal of
Jay Ward's cartoon series, which ran from late 1959 through 1964, was
that there was just enough Rocky and Bullwinkle to keep you interested.
The half-hour show always started with a brief clip of the duo getting
in some type of cliffhanger-type trouble and ended with them foiling
Boris and Natasha's dastardly plans. In between these two parts were
Fractured Fairy Tales, Peabody's Improbable History and a bunch of other
solid animated entertainment. Rocky and Bullwinkle were just a small
part of the show. So how could it possibly work as an hour-and-a-half
film without the support of Peabody, Dudley Do-Right and Snidely
Whiplash (that's my other cat's name)?
The answer is a short one - it doesn't. The dry humor and silly puns get
really tiring after about twenty minutes, but thankfully R&B features
enough inspired casting and self-mockery to make the film somewhat less
torturous than it could have been. R&B opens with an animated Rocket J.
Squirrel and Bullwinkle J. Moose, who have been living off of puny
residual checks from the show's reruns, which have been airing since the
1964 cancellation. It seems that in the last thirty-six years, poor
Rocky has lost the ability to fly.
Flash from Frostbite Falls to Pottsylvania, the home of Boris Badenov
and Natasha Fatale. Through some bizarre blend of science and nonsense,
the two baddies and their fearless leader (named Fearless Leader) submit
a movie script to a beleaguered movie mogul (named Minnie Mogul and
played by Janeane Garofalo, Mystery Men) and are somehow transformed
from cartoon into reality. Jason Alexander (Seinfeld) plays Boris, Rene
Russo (The Thomas Crown Affair) tackles Natasha, and Fearless actor
Robert De Niro becomes Fearless Leader.
The three hatch a plan as diabolical as ever  taking over every cable
television station with something called RBTV (or `Really Bad
Television'). The broadcast signal of RBTV will hypnotize the entire
country into voting for Mr. Leader in the upcoming Presidential
election, thus ousting current Commander-in-Chief, President Signoff
(James Rebhorn, Snow Falling on Cedars), from office.
Luckily, the FBI is on the case, assigning bumbling, knock-kneed Agent
Karen Sympathy (newcomer Piper Perabo from the upcoming Coyote Ugly) to
entice Rocky and Bullwinkle out of retirement to stop the
mass-hypnotism. The squirrel and moose remain animated, despite the fact
that the three bad guys are now real. Isn't this a big plot hole? Well,
yes, but the whole film doesn't make sense. It knows it doesn't make
sense, and it doesn't care. And that's damn admirable, especially after
something like Gone in 60 Seconds, which was just as illogical but
pushed itself as a serious action film.
Eighty-year-old June Foray still provides Rocky's voice, while Aussie
Keith Scott (who narrated Ward's overrated George of the Jungle film)
handles voices for both Bullwinkle and the film's narration. There's
also a load of cameos, from Carl Reiner, Jonathan Winters and Don
Novello, to Randy Quaid, Billy Crystal, Whoopi Goldberg and Good
Burger's Kel Mitchell and Kenan Thompson. John Goodman, who will play
Perabo's father in Ugly, also has a small role in the film. There isn't
a lot of acting going on here, as most of the talent spends the entire
film reacting to characters that weren't there during filming.
R&B was directed by Des McAnuff, who helmed the abysmal Cousin Bette,
but also was a producer on The Iron Giant. The screenplay was written by
Ken Lonergan (Analyze This) and features a dazzling score by Devo's Mark
Mothersbaugh (Rugrats). Lonergan's script is peppered with a decent
amount of pop culture references (like spoofing DeNiro's famous
monologue from Taxi Driver), and several miss-em-if-you-blink homages
to the original show (like the Wossamotta U. infirmary being called the
`J' Ward).

When I saw that the classic early 60's cartoon "Rocky and Bullwinkle" was 
headed to the big screen with an all-star cast and a mixture of live-action 
and animation, I predicted, "It's either gonna be really, really good or 
really, really bad."  Either the filmmakers would get the distinctive humor 
of the cartoon (a clever mixture of political satire, word play, and 
self-reflexive references) or they wouldn't.  The verdict is in, and they got 
it right.
The movie finds the cartoon players suffering from boredom.  The cancellation 
of their TV series left Rocket J. Squirrel (voice of June Foray, the original 
Rocky) and Bullwinkle J. Moose (voice of Keith Scott) with nothing to do.  
Likewise, their Pottsylvanian nemeses Boris (Jason Alexander), Natasha (Rene 
Russo), and Fearless Leader (Robert De Niro) were crushed (literally) by the 
collapse of the Iron Curtain.  So, the bad guys hatch a plot to conquer the 
live-action world.  With the help of movie producer Minnie Mogul (Janeane 
Garofalo), the evil trio emerges into our world and sets about enslaving 
America with the hypnotic effects of bad television.  FBI Agent Karen 
Sympathy (Piper Perabo) realizes that only her childhood heroes can save the 
day and brings Rocky and Bullwinkle into the real world.  (She also gets the 
deep-voiced Narrator to boot.)  Before they can fight the baddies, our heroes 
have to take a road trip across the country, a trip with several twists, 
turns, and celebrity cameos (including Randy Quaid, Carl Reiner, Jonathan 
Winters, John Goodman, Whoopi Goldberg, Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell, 
David Alan Grier, Don Novello, and Billy Crystal).
The key element in the cartoon series for me was the voice of William Conrad 
as the Narrator who commented with deadpan seriousness about the comical 
goings-on.  In the movie, Keith Scott does a great Conrad imitation and the 
interaction between the Narrator and the characters produces the majority of 
the laughs.  (A favorite moment: the Narrator comments on a bad pun by 
saying, "Even their wordplay had become weak and hackneyed," and Bullwinkle 
responds, "No, it was always like this.")
"The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle" indulges unashamedly in cartoon 
silliness while winking at the audience and sharing the laughter at how silly 
it is.  Everything a critic might blast in the movie, screenwriter Kenneth 
Lonergan attacks with a preemptive strike.  Why don't they fly rather than 
driving across the country.  Bullwinkle:  "But then it wouldn't be a road 
movie!"  Why are the villains live-action and the heroes animated?  Karen:  
"Hey I didn't write the movie!"  When Karen asserts that Rocky and Bullwinkle 
aren't in a cartoon anymore, a safe falls from the sky in the path of her car 
(followed by bundles of dynamite marked with big letters TNT).  
De Niro is probably the last actor I'd expect to see in this movie, but then 
who ever thought Nicholson would do "Batman?"  Being a serious Actor in 
Hollywood (a live-action cartoon in real life) must get tiresome, and there 
must be an urge to just be silly.  De Niro parodied his many serious 
performances as gangsters in last year's "Analyze This."  In "Rocky and 
Bullwinkle," he seems to be having a great time doing a Nazi right out of 
"Hogan's Heroes."  He even gets the chance to parody his "are you talkin' to 
me" scene in "Taxi Driver."
I'm not sure if "Rocky and Bullwinkle" plays as well to kids as it does to 
adults.  My wife and I took two with us, and they were underwhelmed.  (They 
much preferred "Gone in 60 Seconds" and "X-Men.")  Come to think of it, I 
never really liked the cartoon when I was a kid.  But, seeing it again when I 
was old enough to get the in-jokes, I loved it.  And I loved the movie.  It's 
sheer fun that's intelligent and silly at the same time.
Bottom Line:  If you like the cartoon, you'll love the movie.

I remember an old episode of "Dr Katz: Licensed Therapist" where Dr. Katz 
told Ben, "Puns aren't really good or bad, they're just puns." I think "The 
Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle" is just one big argument that puns are, in 
fact, good. 
How this film ever got the greenlight is pretty amazing. It's obviously 
intended to be a "family" film but most little kids these days have probably 
never heard of Rocky and Bullwinkle and most adults who are old enough to 
remember them would probably dismiss the notion of seeing this in theaters 
and instead just wait for video (besides, their kids are probably kicking and 
screaming and dragging them to the "Pokémon" movie). It's a shame because 
anyone who's not seeing this now is really missing out. 
Think of it as a G-rated version of "Austin Powers." There's a lot of wacky 
cartoony humor and puns and play-on-words as well as some really sly jokes 
that are quite the zinging [political] commentaries. The story tells of the 
cartoon villains from the old 1960s TV show (Fearless Leader, Boris & 
Natasha) who make a deal with a Hollywood producer to make a movie and when 
the contract is pulled out of the cartoon world the characters come with it. 
"We're attached to the project" says Fearless Leader (Rober De Niro) who then 
admits it's a bad pun but it works for the sake of the movie. 
And that's the comedy stylings at work here - verbal and physical puns and 
parodies all over the place. It's all tongue-in-cheek, winking-at-the-camera 
comedy and it works very well. Every character's name is like this such as 
our co-star Karen Sympathy (Piper Perabo) who is a rookie FBI agent assigned 
to get Rocky & Bullwinkle out of the cartoon world and into the real one to 
help stop Fearless Leader's devious scheme to hypnotize the world with his 
own TV network that broadcasts shows so bad they turn all viewers into 
mindless zombies. 
See? Isn't that funny, witty comedy? The film makers could have just done 
something more mainstream and predictable and have Fearless Leader do 
something Dr. Evil/James Bond villain-style such as something with hostages 
and blowing up stuff. The fact they chose to use this method for the plot as 
well as jokes upon jokes is pretty uncanny. Of course there's also the common 
"Rocky & Bullwinkle" plot of Boris & Natasha trying to destroy moose and 
squirrel which occupies the first half of the film. Jason Alexander and Rene 
Russo are fantastic as these classic baddies and the script and props really 
enhance the cartoony atmosphere. It's funny, but not silly. 
Now it really wouldn't do the film justice to list just a few examples of the 
jokes and hope that would reflect the entire movie - every one is a little 
different from the last one. Taken out of context they might not work, but 
within the movie it's funny.

THE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE (2000) / **
Directed by Des McAnuff. Screenplay by Ken Lonergan, based on characters
created by Jay Ward. Starring June Foray, Keith Scott, Piper Perabo.
Running time: 100 minutes. Rated PG by the MFCB. Reviewed on July 10th,
2000.
I can remember watching "The Bullwinkle Show" when I was young -- it was 
in syndication by then, of course -- but I can't really say that I was a
big fan. It's hard to recall, but I think I found the primitive animation
somewhat off-putting, and I don't think I really caught on to the brand of
humor espoused by series creator Jay Ward. And Rocky's voice really got on
my nerves.
Nearly two decades later, I find my reviewing the characters' first
feature-length film, "The Adventures Of Rocky & Bullwinkle". Not only are
the title creatures back, but so are their Pottsylvanian arch-nemeses
Boris, Natasha and Fearless Leader. Oh, and the Narrator. Rocky's voice
still bugs me a little, but I guess I've learned to accept it over the
years. If only that was the sole problem I had with this movie!
Unfortunately, "Adventures" has far deeper flaws than this, most of them 
stemming from this simple fact: movies are not just television on a bigger
screen. Although superficially similar, the two media are very different.
Story ideas which work well as an eight-minute cartoon short are often not
quite as successful as a ninety-five-minute big-budget film. But that's
what "Adventures" amounts to -- a movie which just takes a stock TV
plot, dresses it up with cornball "Rocky & Bullwinkle" humor, and does
nothing more to justify its existence. About the only nod to this being a
movie and not a TV episode are cameo appearances by big name stars 
(including Janeane Garofalo, Billy Crystal and Whoopi Goldberg -- as Judge
Cameo, no less). But with the exception of John Goodman, who gets one good
line, these are all gratuitous and boring.
And it's a shame, because "Rocky & Bullwinkle" feels like it could have
been a much better movie. Certainly, it has moments of inspiration. Take
the opening scene, which is done in old-fashioned Ward animation style. We
revisit Frostbite Falls, home of Rocky and Bullwinkle. The town has been
stuck in reruns for the past thirty-five years (Bullwinkle gets a
residuals cheque for three-and-a-half cents) and the downtime has taken
its toll. Buildings have fallen into disrepair, the forest has been
clear-cut, and even the Narrator has been reduced to living with his
mother and narrating the events of his own dull life.
Within minutes, however, this inventive beginning gives way to scenes set
in the Real World, and "Adventures" never quite recovers. There is some
nice wordplay, and some lovely in-jokes (the medical facilities at 
Bullwinkle's alma mater, Wottsamotta U, are housed in "J" Ward). But it is
all trapped in a desperately routine plot, with obvious and prosaic 
moralising and -- most glaringly -- a lot of gags that just aren't funny.
Consider the riff on Robert De Niro's famous "Are you talkin' to me?"
scene from "Taxi Driver": it's so uncomfortably shoehorned into the movie
that watching him endure it made me cringe.
De Niro plays Fearless Leader who, along with Boris (Jason Alexander) and
Natasha (Rene Russo), has connived a way to escape into our world.
Fearless Leader has concocted a scheme to brainwash America using his own
cable network, RBTV (Really Bad Television). The FBI decides that the only
people who can stop the Pottsylvanians are Rocky and Bullwinkle (voiced by
June Foray, returning from the original cartoon, and Keith Scott), so they
send Agent Karen Sympathy (Piper Perabo) to find a way to extract the
animated duo from Frostbite Falls. Soon, the three heroes are en route to
New York City, with Boris and Natasha dogging their every step.
There are enough jokes about the many cliches littering "The Adventures Of 
Rocky & Bullwinkle" that I'm honestly not sure if the movie was written
this way on purpose, or if the jokes were added in afterward when the 
filmmakers realised that their script wasn't quite up to snuff. But 
recognising a problem and actually doing something about it are two
different things, and so although acknowledging some of the movie's less
logical developments (why are Boris, Natasha, and Fearless Leader "real"
but Rocky and Bullwinkle still animated?) results in some laughs, it 
doesn't make up for the movie's much larger problems.
Perhaps the biggest flaw is the character of Karen Sympathy. Newcomer
Perabo has a lot of charisma and does a pretty good job with the material
she's given, but the character's pairing with Rocky and Bullwinkle is
ill-advised at best. From her first appearance onward, there is no doubt
that Karen is a "Rocky & Bullwinkle" fangirl, and while the movie makes
some pretense of her trying to act gruff, the effort is thoroughly
transparent. As a result, the interaction between the three heroes is
mostly bland and uninteresting -- there is little conflict between them,
even of a good-natured variety. Things would have been a lot more dynamic
if Karen had been replaced with a genuinely tough-as-nails agent, like her
FBI superior (who does share a hilarious scene with Bullwinkle).
De Niro, Alexander and Russo do their cartoon-character impressions well,
albeit with little substance. Just count the minutes between Russo's
first appearance and her first line of dialogue not spoken in concert with
Alexander! Foray picks up where she left off with Rocky as if not a day
had passed, and Scott is an effective replacement for both Bullwinkle and
the Narrator (substituting for Bill Scott and William Conrad,
respectively).
But "The Adventures Of Rocky & Bullwinkle" is one of those movies that is
ill-conceived from beginning to end. Kids aren't likely to get a lot of
the jokes, and adults are bound to be bored silly by the storyline. It's
not a terrible film, and it's affable enough that I'm reluctant to give it
a failing grade, but you need to dig awfully hard to find the good stuff.
Sadly, this is yet another in a long line of TV-to-movie disappointments,
seemingly designed to leave you in your seat groaning, "Oh no, not again!"

Rated PG: mild language, slapstick violence.
Starring: Rene Russo, Jason Alexander, Robert De Niro, Randy Quaid, Kel 
Mitchell, Piper Perabo, Kenan Thompson, John Goodman, David Alen Grier, 
Jeaneane Garafalo, Whoopi Goldberg.
Thirty-five years ago, "The Bullwinkle Show" was a big hit on televisions. 
Kids would wake up early just to watch the show. Heck when I was little I 
even used to watch the show alot. Yes Moose and Squirrel was the big thing, 
they were popular, made money had tons of fans and was in the lap of luxury. 
Thirty-five years is however a long time, and since then Rocky and Bullwinkle 
really hasn't been very famous, until the year 2000 when Universal releases a 
$80 million budgeted movie, starring Rocky and Bullwinkle. This isn't however 
the Rocky and Bullwinkle you remember, this time they are in the real world 
in an adventure to stop Fearless Leader from taking over the World.
 The movie starts out telling us how Rocky and Bullwinkle has been living off 
re-runs of the show on TV. Bullwinkle has written a letter to the President 
about getting the tress grown back where they live in cartoon land. When 
Natasha, Boris and Fearless Leader are pulled through a television set by 
Jeanane Garofalo, Fearless Leader sets out to take over the world, by making 
a television station called RBTV (really bad TV) which when patrons will 
watch the shows and turn them into mindless walking zombies. Agent Sympathy 
(Piper Perabo of the upcoming "Coyote Ugly") is sent out to find Rocky and 
Bullwinkle and bring them into the real world, so they can stop Boris, 
Natasha and Fearless Leader.
Agent Sympathy brings the two to the real world, but she has to tell them 
what exactly is going on, while they try to adapt to the fact that there is 
no commercial breaks, and that the people around them are nicely animated. Of 
course the bad Boris and Natasha continue their raid to try to kill Moose and 
Squirrel. Agent Sympathy as to try to stop these two, while trying to get 
Rocky and Bullwinkle to understand that if they don't stop Fearless Leader in 
time, the world will come to an end. 
The movie is outlined by very funny, often hilarious moments that I enjoyed 
enormously. The movie works on many levels and tanks of many levels. The 
levels it works on is that the actors who are portraying their characters are 
fantastic. Rene Russo is the stand out as Natasha Fatale the sexy french 
woman who with her honey Boris Badenov played well by Jason Alexander try to 
get Moose and Squirrel but as usual fail miserably. Jason Alexander is a 
great choice for Boris but sadly he isn't given enough to do, and at times 
seems a bit dull in the role. Robert De Niro is great as  Fearless Leader 
with his accent and high-pitched voice. Perhaps the best performance comes 
from newcomer Piper Perabo who is a talented and beautiful actress capable of 
many things in her future. There are some great cameos by stars like Whoopi 
Goldberg, John Goodman, Jeaneane Garofalo and many more. 
Another plus to the film is the script which is cleverly written if at times 
a bit cliched. Rocky and Bullwinkle are greatly brought out and Bullwinkle is 
given some fantastic lines. The animation of these two are magnificent and 
plus in color and detail. They are brought out in a 3-D type of thing that is 
so great it might have surpassed Roger Rabbit's mix of Live Action and 
Animation, just fantastic and seeing the movie you can tell where the 
80+million budget came from. There are quite a bit of downsides to the film 
however, it seems really cartoonish and even sometimes dumb. There are some 
scenes that are really ridiculous and not even that funny.
I noticed that in a few scenes the cast seemed tired and the same joke was 
told over and over. But even with these flaws I was disappointed with the 
whole movie entirely, but the animation, characters and some of the insights 
of the film are enjoyable, and kids will definately love it. Its a good movie 
overall with flaws but far from being bad, but far from being perfect.

THE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE
Directed by: Des Mcanuff
Written by: Ken Lonergan, Jay Ward (characters)
All right, I'm going to keep this plot summary pretty short because frankly 
there wasn't much of a plot to summarize. I guess that was the one part of 
the movie that was true to the television show. It's the new millenium, and 
Rocky and Bullwinkle are still trapped in reruns after 35 years, lamenting 
the loss of their forest. Meanwhile, Fearless Leader (Robert De Niro), Boris 
(Jason Alexander), and Natasha (Rene Russo) have escaped into the real world 
by signing a contract for a film deal. The film deal doesn't work because 
the producer doesn't like movies about moose. That hardly matters however, 
because Fearless Leader has hatched a plan to take over the United States by 
turning everyone into mindless vegetables through hypnotic television shows 
(not that anyone should notice the difference, someone points out). FBI 
Agent, Karen Sympathy (Piper Perabo), is assigned to stop the notorious trio 
by bringing Rocky and Bullwinkle out of reruns and into the real world. 
Things don't go quite as planned however, because Rocky can't seem to fly 
anymore, and Bullwinkle seems to have grown even dumber (assuming that's 
possible). Nevertheless, the three start a cross country journey to get to 
New York in time to stop Fearless Leader from convincing the entire United 
States to elect him president.
Well, Boris and Natasha may not have been able to stop Moose and Squirrel 
back in the '60s, but Des Mcanuff (who produced the wonderful "The Iron 
Giant") and Ken Lonergan (who wrote the hilarious "Analyze This") managed to 
stop them with this piece of tripe. Moose and Squi- sorry, Rocky and 
Bullwinkle were really quite amusing back in the old television series. The 
episodes were full of clever puns, witty comments about society, and amusing 
slapstick comedy involving Boris, Natasha, or Bullwinkle (okay, so I never 
found Rocky to be very funny). The movie has hackneyed, stupid puns; obvious 
and unfunny social commentary (gee, people are like vegetables when watching 
television - yuck yuck); and slapstick comedy minus the amusement. Does this 
mean the movie is completely humorless? No, it just means that for every 
joke that works, ten don't. This also means that for every scene that works 
(like the courtroom scene, and there is one very funny line involving the 
explanation of where old cartoons go and gain followings), ten don't (the 
car trip to the college, the entire college scene, the ending sequence, and 
at least seven more), and this gets very tiresome after awhile.
"Rocky and Bullwinkle" does boast an amazing array of talent, led by the 
great De Niro himself and supported by Jason Alexander (Seinfeld) and Rene 
Russo ("The Thomas Crown Affair"). The problem is that these three great 
actors look quite embarrassed to be in this movie, and frankly, who can 
blame them? In the film's lead role we have Piper Perabo (who will soon be 
appearing in Jerry Bruckheimer's "Coyote Ugly"). I don't know where this 
girl came from, but she is one of the cutest things I have ever seen (it's 
just a shame she can't act). Keith Scott ("George of the Jungle") has taken 
over duties as Bullwinkle and the always funny narrator, and the change is 
barely noticeable. We are also granted a host of well known actors in 
useless cameos. We get Whoopi Goldberg as a judge, Kel Mitchell and Keenan 
Thompson as college buddies, Randy Quaid as the head of the FBI, John 
Goodman as a state trooper, and so on (Janeane Garolfalo, Carl Reiner, David 
Alan Grier, etc.). The list goes on forever, but all these cameos amount to 
just about nothing because they are all given no screen time. The only two 
who make any sort of impression are John Goodman (because he always makes an 
impression) and Janeane Garofalo (because she gets one of those rare 
semi-amusing scenes). It was actually quite sad to see such a talented cast 
wasted.
"Rocky and Bullwinkle" is guilty of one other massive travesty. One so 
unspeakably terrible I'm loathe to mention it. Sherman and Mr. Peabody 
aren't present anywhere in the movie. I'll give you a minute to let that 
soak in. I have to wonder how Ken Lonergan found a way to fit in so many 
celebrity cameos but didn't remember to stick the most beloved characters 
(in my opinion anyway) from the original television show. Okay, my rant is 
over, or as Mr. Peabody would say, "Quiet you." "Rocky and Bullwinkle" 
features a subdued, barely present soundtrack, which was actually a nice 
change from the recent obnoxiously loud soundtracks I've been hearing. One 
final note: despite the fact that there is more than a decade's difference 
between "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" and "The Adventures of Rocky and 
Bullwinkle", the former features more seamless interaction between the 
animated characters and the real ones. The movie runs only 88 minutes, but 
it felt like it should have ended at 60 or so. I'd recommend it only to 
people who adore animated/live action movies and give it two and a half out 
of five stars.

In the spotty two film history of Jay Wardâs animated television shows making 
their way to the big screen, along comes Rocky and Bullwinkle. The duo is 
probably the most popular of his creations, but these two have something 
George of the Jungle and Dudley Do-Right donât. When the program aired during 
the 1960s, there was always a political aspect to it. Winking, nudging, and 
in conclusion suggesting that a dimwitted moose and above average flying 
squirrel could beat the Russians was never completely through the back door. 
Since the Russian paranoia in the states has subsided, what purpose would the 
creatures serve today? To satirize Hollywood of course! Their mission is 
pretty much the same, but technology has changed everything. Keeping the 
original cheap wordplay intact, this new movie smacks all former cartoon 
characters into '90s reality, a time of influential entertainment, improved 
communication, and an evil villain to bring to justice.
Boris (Jason Alexander) and Natasha (Rene Russo) get pulled out of reruns. 
Their leader, aptly named Fearless Leader (Robert De Niro), also pops up in 
the real world. He comes up with a brilliant scheme. He buys all of the 
television stations in the United States so he can broadcast his own network, 
Really Bad TV, across the nation. After watching just a few short minutes, 
viewers become stupefied and settle into a hypnotic trance. When the majority 
of Americans are under his spell, Fearless Leader will force them to vote for 
him as president. Naturally, the only people that can save the day are Rocky 
and Bullwinkle. They too get pulled out of reruns. Teaming up with FBI agent 
Karen Sympathy (Piper Perabo), Moose and Squirrel travel the countryside to 
stop the evil television station. With Bullwinkleâs mental capacity, Karenâs 
identity issues, and Rocky past his prime the adventure is a rough one.  
The greatest pleasures of this movie are the cameos. Randy Quaid, Janeane 
Garofolo, Carl Reiner, Jonathan Winters, Billy Crystal, John Goodman, and 
Whoopi Goldberg all make appearances.  Piper Perabo fits her character well. 
Jason Alexander and Rene Russo are deliciously evil as Boris and Natasha. The 
chemistry between them is great. Robert De Niro hams it up to hilarious 
extremes, and he even spoofs his famous, âYou talkinâ to me?â? scene from 
Taxi Driver. Keith Scott is satisfactory as the narrator and new Bullwinkle. 
While he doesnât have the blundering Bullwinkle tone of the late Bill Scott, 
his lines are really funny. The wonderful June Foray is still the voice of 
Rocky. 
The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle runs into difficulties in its 
presentation. Boris, Natasha, and Fearless leader are actual people. Rocky 
and Bullwinkle must settle for being awkward computer animated images. Why is 
that? One character raises this question during the movie, but receives no 
answer. Complete animation would mean the loss of already animated and 
excellent human performances. An actual live moose and squirrel would just be 
bizarre. Another problem I always have with Jay Ward movies is the way 
characters interact and converse with the narrator. He's just another 
character rather than being omnipotent. This was amusing in George of the 
Jungle, made Dudley Do-Right worse, and works only occasionally here.
Now Iâm forgetting the context of the story. This is a live action cartoon 
with lots of witty or so bad itâs funny lines. It succeeds at what a movie 
should do, entertain. Even though some of the jokes fall flat, this should be 
an enjoyable time for kids, and a nostalgia trip for baby boomers. Despite 
its many flaws, this is 88 minutes of pure fun.
