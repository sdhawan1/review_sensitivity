A dark comedy from Great Britain about the advertising world. Bruce
Robinson, the creative director and writer of  "Withnail And I," has
come up once again with an original film, which again stars Richard E.
Grant. "How to Get Ahead in Advertising" is a tirade against the phony
world of advertising and the screams denouncing that industry seemed
like sweet music to my ears up to a point, as the message of the film
eventually moved from being funny to becoming shrill and overwhelming,
even to someone like me who was sympathetic to the script. Ad men could
very well be the lowest souls on the food chain on planet Earth, is a
point that doesn't have to be nailed into me before I get it.
Dennis Bagley (Grant) is a creative genius in the advertising field, a
top whiz in a big advertising company, living a very wealthy lifestyle
while residing in a country estate, surrounded with empty friends and a
beautiful wife. He is a flamboyant hustler who gets traumatized because
of a boil on the side of his neck that looks like a man and talks back
to him. The boil becomes his alter ego and can't let him forget who he
is, even when he wants to turn over a new leaf and warn the public about
how advertising is a means of killing the truth.
Bagley can't face his boss Bristol (Wilson), as he is having trouble
coming up with a new ad slogan campaign for a pimple cream and is
getting the new sponsor anxious because he is going past the deadline.
Consumed with stress, Bagley develops a boil on his neck that is
consuming him, and his understanding wife Julia (Ward) becomes afraid
that he is having a breakdown, especially since he runs naked through
the garden having a conversation with the boil.
Rational help is in order, so off he goes to see a shrink (Shrapnel),
who is only too glad to listen to him and his boil. The shrink checks
for the usual causes of dysfunction in modern society: sex, stress and
career. When Bagley rants on that he quit his high paying job because
advertising conspires with Big Brother and is all about greed, the
shrink responds the same way as Bristol did to his resignation, that he
needs to get his problem taken care of and then return to work. The
point being made, is that both the business world and the world of
science are ready to sell almost any product to make a buck, as they
both exist by giving the public what they want. The ad men can only sell
products people are led to believe they need, while shrinks can only get
rid of problems from people who don't want them.
This is a film that rants on throughout, as it starts off very funny and
then moves into  sermonizing about the corrupt industry. It becomes a
story about the talking boil taking over the personality of the man
trapped in all his lies who now is not only guilt-ridden by what evil he
does, but has become an ugly zit, his sense of being is replaced by the
boil who knows only how to sell things. The huckster's motto being: If
you want to sell pimple cream, you have to encourage people to have
pimples. You only want to sell them hope not a cure...which is the way
you make your profit.
The cast play their parts with the earnest intensity and gullibility
required, with Richard Grant showing a lot of energy and a tremendous
ability to verbalize. It's an unusual picture, one worth a look at for
those who don't mind pure nuttiness instead of dramatics and tension in
a story. To enjoy this film, I think one has to empathize with Bagley's
predicament, as when he has a bag (bag for Bagley) over his head and has
been taken over by the boil and is now the outsider in his own body,
with his voice stifled unable to reach the public, and he is bemoaning
about the coming Holocaust that his boil is harbinger of, which makes
for over-the-edge comedy, which is not everyone's cup of tea. One day,
he rants, we will wake up and find that we ruined the rain forest for
hamburgers, and we will find oxygen in short-supply, with Brazilians
fixing the price on oxygen just like the Arabs now do with oil...  . It
sounds far-reaching, a ghastly cry against the excesses of materialism,
or does it?

[Note: the "Cartoon Laws" posted here recently were apparently taken in large
part from "O'Donnell's Laws of Cartoon Motion" in the June 1980 issue of
ESQUIRE magazine, a fact that the original poster didn't mention (and may not
have known--these things tend to travel from person to person).  -Moderator.]
Contains some profanity, minor violence, minor gore, and brief, nonsuggestive
nudity.
Overall rating.....3.5 on the 0-4 scale.
     At the outset, let me confess that I'm in the process of starting
postgraduate studies in Advertising, so perhaps this film is a little bit more
poignant to me than to general audiences.  Nonetheless, I feel that the wit of
Mr. Robinson's latest effort are enough to make this film very attractive to
anyone living in the ad-addicted 20th Century.
     HOW TO GET AHEAD IN ADVERTISING is the tale of Bagley, an advertising whiz
kid who is driven to distraction by his inability to come up with a slogan for
pimple cream.  As Bagley's derangement progresses, we learn that the true
source of his anxiety is a deep-seated misgiving about the ethics of the entire
advertising profession.  The malady that arises causes no end of hilarious
situations (forgive me if I'm too vague, but it's difficult to explicate the
rich humor of the film without giving the plot away).  All I'll say is that the
title is a terrible pun.
     Grant turns in an outstanding performance as the manically panicing
Bagley.  Ward does an acceptable job as his wife, and Wilson delightfully
grates as Bagley's "old boy" boss.  Technically, the film is fairly low-key.
The special effects are good without being attention-drawing or technically
outstanding.  Camera/editing technique is standard fare.  The pace is good
(this one won't put anyone to sleep).  The script is consistently witty, never
slowing down for a second (it even features a brief poke at the Blake fans in
the audience).
