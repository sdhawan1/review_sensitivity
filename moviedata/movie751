        In his first movie since 1987's disappointing SPACEBALLS, Mel
Brooks takes a sympathetic look at America's homeless, a surprisingly sober
subject matter for the usually zany comedian.  However, even with its
solemn theme, LIFE STINKS is still your basic Mel Brooks-comedy, which is
to say that it's abundantly funny and immensely entertaining.
        In addition to writing and directing, Brooks stars as an
egotistical billionaire who wagers that he can live on the streets of L.A.
for 30 days without money and without revealing his true identity.  Brooks
steers the movie mostly towards laughs, but he also gives it heart and
soul, especially when presenting the homeless.
        Leslie Ann Warren, in particular, sparkles as the romantic interest
(a crazy bag lady who's wary of men), bringing a tough grittiness to the
role.  The movie's Achilles' heel: it sometimes gets so ludicrous that you
can't take its serious moments seriously.  With a slightly sharper edge,
Brooks could have carved out some memorable social commentary to sprinkle
on top of his irreverent humor.
