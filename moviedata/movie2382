        Four people are in a room dancing, Charlie's Angels style, fingers
pointed like shooting guns and booties shaking. Heads bob up and down in
time with the pop and fizz funk of the German record playing in the
background.
        Styled like a music video, we cut back and forth between all four of
them swinging in sync with the rhythm and performing their individual
motions with campy grandeur. After three or four minutes of this highly
amusing, sexually charged romp and stomp in the living room, the middle
aged businessman (obviously the leader of the group) abruptly turns off
the record. "All right, that's enough. Everybody to the bedroom!" The
women rush offscreen, giggling and squealing.
        That's what was used as a trailer for Francois Ozon's latest sexual
comedy-thriller. The young Frenchman who directed the superb short film
See the Sea and the puerile "shock-o-rama" feature Sitcom is back with
another foray of men and women who push each other's buttons. Ozon lends
his slightly warped comic perspective to a screenplay adapted from a
theater piece by young, bitter Rainer Werner Fassbinder. 
        Thank goodness Fassbinder never made this movie, since it is filled
with pretentious dialogue which, if taken too seriously, would have been
just painful. Fassbinder's earliest films are all bleak musings on how
terrible the world is. "My soul is filled with such emptiness the likes
of which you have never seen before, and I cannot ever be happy because
my soul is empty, et cetera, et cetera." Humorless misanthropic slogans
and self-loathing for ninety minutes do not make for an enjoying viewing
experience. (He got better with age.)
        However, once Fassbinder's script was pared down by Ozon, some of the
insightful bickering by a couple trapped in a living situation which has
made them articulate and bitter comes to the forefront. This was the
German auteur's greatest skill, the ability to paint characters who
wallow in misery and inflict pain on those they hold closest to their
hearts. Suddenly, every line of dialogue is a mini-apocalypse, such as,
"Why do you wear shoes around the apartment? You're so nosy! I told you
to wear slippers!"
        Older Fassbinder clone Leo (sleek Bernard Giraudeau, very fine) is the
middle aged man who picks up straight, younger Fassbinder clone Franz
(apple cheeked Malik Zidi) one night and gloriously seduces him. First,
they drink. Leo turns on the charm, using flattery and subtle
manipulations to get Franz to confess to having an interest in
homosexual forays. Before long, they're indulging in Franz's fantasy of
a stranger coming to the bed wearing an overcoat. It's sexy, diabolical
and funny, all at once.
        While the dialogue and set-up feel stagy (all interior locations and
talky battles of will) Ozon manages to deftly use bright and gaudy '70s
colors in each room and retro costumes to add visual splendor to each
scene. The seduction scene and forthcoming verbal sparring tends to go
on and on for long stretches into the realm of tedium, the performances
are so compelling and the dialogue so spry and game that you somehow
manage to stick with Water Drops on Burning Rocks.
        After the seduction, we see them six months later in the midst of a
live-in relationship gone to hell. Franz is now Leo's "housewife",
cooking and cleaning and hanging up his coat for him, lighting his
cigarette and scrubbing the floorboards. Leo remains dissatisfied with
everything Franz does, and when it reaches the inevitable point where
Franz wants to pack his bags and go, Leo does a bad job of pretending
that it's their very arguments which keep him happy.
        Ozon's casting in his films remains masterful, arousing genuine pathos
in characters who are either dumb or unsympathetic. While his plots fare
better in the short form (a little goes a long way in See the Sea) and
he recycles visual and story ideas to pad out his ninety minute movie,
he does manage to throw in enough stuff (and two new characters midway
through) to keep it moving. Besides, you always have that nifty dance
number to look forward to.
        Sex, cruelty, fetishism - it may amount to a mere sick confection of a
movie, one which is ultimately insignificant and lightweight, but it's
compulsively watchable if you're game.

Based on a Rainer Werner Fassbinder play, Water Drops on Burning Rocks
is the directorial debut of François Ozon, the reigning bad boy of
French cinema.  The film centers on the relationship between middle-aged
Léopold (Bernard Giraudeau) and twenty-something Franz (Malik Zidi).
Their affair begins torridly, but quickly turns dull and routine, with
Franz basically becoming Léopold's houseboy.
Just a Franz appears to be ready to check out of the relationship, the
situation gets complicated by the arrival of his curvy, sex-starved
ex-fiancée (Ludivine Sagnier), who arrives just before Léopold's
ex-lover  a man who became a woman to please her former boyfriend (Anna
Levine).  Hilarity, tragedy and a bizarre dance number ensue in this
well-executed film debut.
