First of all, let's get one thing straight. This is not the movie you 
think it is going to be. It's not another "Ace Ventura" and it's not 
very much at all what you would expect from Jim Carrey.
Matthew Broderick is Steven Kovacs, a white collar everyman who has just 
moved out from the apartment that he and his girlfriend shared. His 
eviction came at her suggestion following his marriage proposal. Not 
feeling all that great about his life and attempting to set up 
housekeeping, one of his initial orders of business is to order cable. 
His first mistake.
In a situation everyone can sympathize with, Kovacs waits and waits for 
his cable guy to appear. When Carrey finally shows up to deliver the 
electronic babysitter, he seems a bit off, but gives Kovacs free cable 
and the two lonely guys agree to hang out.
Carrey, who says his name is "Ernie Douglas, but my friends call me 
Chip" (ring any bells?), turns out to be a psychopathic emotional 
vampire who latches on to Broderick like a leech. In the Cable Guy's 
mind they have instantaneously become best buds.
The film has more in common with "Single White Female" and other stalker 
movies than it does with "Dumb And Dumber". It is certainly not for the 
kids (The most humorous event was the loud question from the 
four-year-old girl in the row behind me, "Daddy, what=B9s a prostitute?") 
nor is it overflowing with the typical Carrey stupid physical comedy, 
although it does feature some of that. Can you imagine a Carrey film 
that wouldn't?
For some reason unfathomable to me, audiences at most Jim Carrey films 
are rolling in the aisles in laughter. At this one they'll spend more 
time squirming in their seats. While there are a few funny bits, the 
uncomfortable ones are more plentiful.
Why uncomfortable? Probably because we all have had a "friend" that the 
Cable Guy reminds us of. Someone who has more invested in the 
relationship than we do. Someone who would do anything for us, except 
leave us alone. This film shoves the possibilities in our faces. 
Carrey's character takes his position to the extreme: beating up Kovacs' 
girlfriend's date in a restroom, playing "Porno Password" with Kovacs' 
parents, giving Kovacs thousands of dollars worth of video equipment. 
The Cable Guy (we never learn his real name) doesn't have a life so he 
takes over Kovacs'. It's difficult to even write a sentence about him 
without using the word "Kovacs".
Carrey is passable in this role: certainly more of an actor and funnier 
than in his previous attempts. Broderick is always charming, but here he 
seems to concentrate on getting out of Carrey's way. The rest of the 
cast are minor roles that run the range from adequate to almost 
inspired.
There are a few plot problems and some shoddy editing, but it's a 
beginning for Carrey. If, that is, anything could be a beginning for a 
man that makes $20 million.

The Cable Guy (1996) ****1/2 - C:Jim Carrey, Matthew Broderick, George
Segal, Ben Stiller.
The Cable Guy is easily Jim Carrey's best movie ever and the reason is
simple, it's because it's not a Jim Carrey movie. You see, if this had been
an actual Jim Carrey movie, he'd be jumping all over the place with a weird
haircut and would be talking with his butt cheeks.
Ok, so he's not exactly normal in The Cable Guy either. Actually, his
character is quite dark and complex, not the fun-loving silly guy Jim Carrey
fans are used to. This is certain to make his fans upset and rightfully so.
All comedians get tired of doing the same thing over and over again and this
film was just too good of a possibility for Carrey to pass up. I applaud
what he's trying to do with his career with this film by trying to show
people that he can ACTUALLY act. Carrey adds a great amount of depth to his
character in the film, depth that someone like Adam Sandler or Chris Farley
would not be able to do.
The Cable Guy is the newest entry in the "BLANK-from-hell" genre which
includes other films such as Pacific Heights (the tenant from hell), The
Temp (the secretary from hell), and The Crush (the Alicia Silverstone from
hell). Carrey plays the title character, who doesn't use his real name so
instead he uses names from old TV shows. Throughout most of the film he uses
the name of Chip Douglas.
The cable guy comes to install cable for Steven (Broderick), who has just
recently seperated from his girlfriend on a "trial" basis and has moved into
his own place. Steven asks him about "illegal" cable and Carrey agrees to
"juice him up". But, he expects something in return, Steven's friendship.
And he'll do whatever he has to do to get it.
Broderick gets to do what he does best here, which is the normal guy caught
in a strange situation. His character, at first, doesn't really want Chip to
go away, he just wants him to stop acting so weird all the time. His mistake
comes when his girlfriend wants to give him a second chance and he decides
to brush off Chip, telling him "I don't have any room in my life for a new
friend". Chip then proceeds to ruin Steven's life.
Carrey's performance has many levels to it. One minute you're laughing at
him, the next you feel sorry for him, and then you're scared of him. Ben
Stiller's direction is quite good and the film is very well made. Stiller
should have exploited the film's final punchline/message a little more than
he did, but the joke is still funny anyway. Eric Roberts has a very brief
cameo as himself and it too is hilarious. In conclusion, The Cable Guy is
the best thing Carrey could do with his talents at this point in his career
and he should pursue more films like this one.

Directed by: Ben Stiller
Written by: Judd Apatow (uncredited), Lou Holtz Jr.
Cast: Matthew Broderick (Steven Kovacs), Jim Carrey ("Chip Douglas"),  Leslie 
Mann (Robin), Jack Black (Rick), George Segal (Mr Kovacs), Diane Baker (Mrs 
Kovacs).
Produced by:  Columbia Pictures / Licht/Mueller Film Corporation
Running Time: About 90 minutes.
Rating : *** out of *****
Theatres : Just about everywhere.
These are probably the best and worst lines in THE CABLE GUY, and in a
knowing, twisted film-student-with-a-vengeance sort of way, the combined
effort of director Ben Stiller (whom I hereby forgive forever for making
REALITY BITES) and writer Holtz is a dark and magnificently lunatic
mock-celebration of the flickering blue parent generation. OK, it's also
an excessive throw-in-all-the-popular-media-references-you-can type of
smartass caper with more intelligent directing than most of Carrey's
other films (although that isn't saying much), but being the first with
an actual body-functions-joke minimum, this film could very well be
Carrey's first into the comedians-can-act-too spectrum of Hollywood.
Unlike previous Jim Carrey successes like the Ace Ventura movies or DUMB
AND DUMBER, which were no more than empty vehicles for Carrey's manic
personality and a surprisingly inventive number of flatulent jokes, The
Cable Guy not only has a plot that follows to conclusion, more
importantly--gasp!--it has a concept: too much TV is, well, it's just
bad for you.
This is overwhelmingly proved by Chip Douglas (Carrey), the cable guy 
who fixes architext Steven Kovacs up with free cable television 
channels and then, taking Kovacs' unwilling friendship for granted, 
proceeds to mess up his life in a number of ways: he throws mind-splinting 
karaoke parties, wrecks friendly basketball games, stalks Stephen and 
eventually lands him in jail.  As Chip, Carrey is the optimum product of
self-conscious popular media gone deliciously and disturbingly wrong. He 
relates everything to television past and present, assaulting his newly 
appointed *schlemielman* with catchphrase melanges from sixties sitcoms 
and reenacting movie scenes with a screaming, maniacal sense of irrelevence 
that is darkly engaging to us postmodern audiences (or maybe just me), and 
morally unsettling to people like my parents, who would consider Mr Carrey 
to be a product of a satanic cult instead of mere television. 
But then of course, isn't that the point? CABLE GUY is *about* the
dangers of television, if we are to believe the desperation on
Chip-Carrey's face as he dangles from a gigantic satellite above
imminent doom. *Somebody has to kill the babysitter*, he implores,
bringing to mind the kitschy flashback the film provided its audience
earlier about Chip's childhood loneliness, sans siblings and parents,
leading to a life of absorption in front of the TV.
But the moment, like everything in this movie, turns on itself with a
beautiful slow-motion climax that intensifies to blackness, resembling
the same metafictional acknowledgement of media-constructed realities in
the ending of that British bastion of silliness now revered by millions
across the world--Carrey's earlier counterparts--Monty Python's Holy
Grail.
In the end, CABLE GUY is worth watching if only to see Carrey
actually sort of act. Or at least, acknowledge the presence of his cast.
Perhaps this is more to director Stiller's credit, who refuses to allow
the film to degenerate into yet another Carrey showcase. Delightful
surprise guest appearances from Stiller and longtime partner in crime
Janeane Garafalo also keep the enjoyment going when Carrey's
hyperactivity annoys--and make no mistake, he will annoy, though far
less than in previous movies--and Carrey's own performance, subdued as
it is, is near-perfect for the media pastiche (the word no
self-respecting postmodernist would leave home without) that he
represents.
Like Mork (and much like Robin Williams himself), Carrey's comedy evokes
every pose, every gesture, every facial expression, tone and technical
idea ever used in the history of modern media, aggrandized and
fast-forwarded to grotesque proportions to pass for humor. Like Mork,
Carey's Chip Douglas (the name itself, the film reveals, is filched from
"My Three Sons," so Carey's character is literally nameless, never truly
identified, and a macabre inversion of Leone's Man With No Name) merges
real life conversation with commercial snippets and a movie quotes
compendium, and a paranoid self-consciousness that ironically blends
fantasy with real life. "If this were a movie, there would be danger
music," he snarls while playing villain with Stephen's girlfriend, 
singing along *with* the actual soundtrack with knowing vengeance.
It is therefore perhaps the film's self-awareness on the whole that
makes THE CABLE GUY weird, what with its parodic freeze frames and the
vicious mock-reality celebrity trials to name a few of the fun things
Stiller gets the film up to. And Hollywood has never taken to
metadramatics very well.  THE CABLE GUY was generally badly received by
critics and grossed little more than it took to make at the US Box
Office (according to figures taken from the Internet Movie Database).
Still, I recommend this film for its widescreen absurdity, great
performances all round, and its dark vision of our crazy lives. Carry
on, Carrey.
The Flying Inkpot Rating System:
 * Wait for the TV2 broadcast.
 ** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha! 
 *** Pretty good, bring a friend.
 **** Amazing, potent stuff.
 ***** Perfection. See it twice.

        The Cable Guy will get attention for three things: for being the film
that Jim Carrey first got $20 million for, the film that gave Carrey the
chance to ssttrreettcchh, and for being Carrey's first minor box-office
disappointment.  The surprising thing is that it is a very good movie.
It's Carrey's best to date and Broderick's best performance since The
Freshman(a little seen masterpiece with Marlon Brando).
        When he's not watching television, Chip Douglas(Jim Carrey) works as a
free-lance cable guy as a way to meet potential friends(he was fired
from dozens of real companies for stalking customers).  His latest
target is Steven(Matthew Broderick), a man living alone after he was
turned down for marriage to his girlfriend.
         At first, he seems friendly but strange, taking Steven to a huge
satellite dish (where he believes the entire world's cable comes from),
or to a restaurant called Medieval Times, where Steven and Chip joust in
the center ring(watch for Janeane Garfalo in a great bit as a waitress
at the restaurant).  But, after awhile, Steven doesn't need Chip
anymore(Mann has come back).  Chip is deeply hurt by this and sets out
to ruin Steven's life.  He turns Steven's family against him, gets Steve
fired, and gets him tossed in jail for receiving stolen property. 
        Matthew Broderick is the perfect Jim Carrey foil.  His calm, quiet,
sane acting style blends perfectly with Carrey's anything goes method.
They should make another movie together in the near future(How about if
Broderick plays the bad guy in the next Mask picture?).  The rest of the
cast does it's job well, but the movie is simply a showcase for Matt and
Jim.
        One of my problems with Batman Forever(and anyone who's read my VERY
long statement about B.F.; i.e., the reason Joel Schulmacher deserves to
die slowly and then burn in hell for all eternity, knows I have a few)
was that despite Jim Carrey's witty take on Frank Gorshin's Riddler,
Carrey didn't project a sense of menace.  Well, he's solved that problem
pretty well and I actually look forward to him taking on another
psychopath. 
But, Chip is a truly pathetic character; a desperately lonely man who,
because he grew up in front of the television(he learned the facts of
life from "The Facts of Life"), cannot communicate in any normal
fashion.  Everything Chip Douglas knows, he learned from television.
Every piece of advice he gives was from the tube, every joke he heard;
from the tube, in essence, he IS television(no wonder his favorite
restaurant is Medieval Times, its phony atmosphere is just like
something that you'd see on TV).  In the end, Chip's lack of knowledge
of the real world has doomed him to live alone forever.
        He is such a tragic character that we(or at least I) wanted him to
die.  In the end, as he plunges from the cable dish(how perfect: the
device that gave him "life" brings him death), we think that his
suffering is over, that he is at last at peace(of course, Stiller copped
out in letting Carrey live, as if watching him die would be too much for
his young fans).
        Of course, this film is supposed to be a black comedy.  It is very
funny at times.  During the first hour, Carrey's antic are silly, as
usual(his singing of "Somebody to Love", during a karaoke party,  is a
classic).  Even during the final 25 minutes, when Carrey takes on
Broderick atop the dish, there is always a sense of spoof in the
madness,  I am particularly fond of the moment where Carrey mentions
that real life doesn't have good suspense music; after which he starts
humming the same tune on the soundtrack, or when he holds Mann hostage
with... a staple gun.  Best of all is a very funny subplot about a
murder trial on the tube with former child sitcom star Stan Sweet(Ben
Stiller) accused of murdering Sam Sweet(Ben Stiller), after their sitcom
was canceled and they joined a religious cult(Stan claimed repeatedly on
the 911 call that Asians killed his brother, a really nasty swipe at the
Susan Smith case).
        Broderick once again proves he is a master at effective underacting,
and Carrey proves he can play both good and evil.  While the film is
very funny, it was the creepy elements that entertained me. I'll
remember Chip Douglas much longer than I'll remember AceVentura or Lloyd
Christmas.        "B+"

Well, CNN is *wrong* about this movie.1
This "ill-conceived flick" as Carol Buckland calls it not a bad film and the
"stupid pieties" that stick in Richard Schickel throat are much more a
feature than a flaw.  It's apparent this movie is going to struggle with the
misfortune of people just plain not getting it.  
It's evident why not everyone will take to it, but taste is not art, as has
been so eloquently said, and the bad taste some reviewers find in their
mouth may be due more to their dental hygiene than any cinematic deficiencies.
The Cable Guy is a fine film and hits squarely its target as a dark comedy
with a just-kidding wry smile.
Jim Carrey plays a whacked out cable guy named Chip whose desperation for a
friend draws him inexorably to Steven (Matthew Broderick), a likable
architect newly turfed out by his girlfriend after he had the audacity to
propose to her.  While Chip hooks up the cable in Steven's new apartment, he
drops surprisingly sage advice about getting back the girl while at the same
time weaseling into Steven's post hookup life by not taking a polite no for
an answer.
While Steven thus armed makes great strides to reaquire his love's
affections, Chip takes more direct action to eliminate Steve's competition.
As the true nature of Chip's favours dawns on Steven, his sweet fortune
turns sour then to poison when he demands that Chip gets out of his life.
But Chip is already locked into a Fatal Attraction and benevolence turns to
malevolence as Chip seeks revenge to punish Steven's betrayal as a friend.
Chip's plan is executed with the ease and confidence of an evil Ace Ventura
and Steve is fired, thrown in jail and alienated from his family before
making the bone chilling discovery that the life of the woman he loves is in
the hands of his jealously insane "friend".
The film's action climax drives home the grave and revolutionary message
that  tv is bad for you!  And here is where CNN's dear Bucky and so
many others get it wrong.  The ending *is* hammy and implausible but
deliberately so, striking the balance of a hokey B thriller so lame it's
laughable but eery enough to quicken your steps down the dark path to home.
The movie redeems its outlandishness with tongue firmly in cheek but still
teases us with a "just kidding... or am I?" overall mood.
Young children won't take to this film like they did to Ace Ventura: Pet
Detective, and I'm sure more than a few adults will not find it to their
tastes as well.  Carrey's first Ace had me laughing out loud from start to
finish, while his latest work evokes chuckles that only grow as they simmer
in my belly.  A different menu, but good food is still good food.

Review- Many performers don't take chances. They stick with what made 
them famous and decide to continue with that until people find someone 
else who can do the same thing just as good. Well, Jim Carrey takes a 
chance here, albeit a safe one. He's still up to his old antics, but in a 
much darker and odd way. I admire him for that. 
Matthew Broderick stars as a young executive recently separated from his 
wife. One day, his cable goes out. so he calls the cable company. Of 
course, the cable guy arrives late, and at an inopportune time. Broderick 
slips him $50 to get free cable channels. Chip does it for him, and 
thinks hes found a new friend. Broderick humors him at first, but when 
Chip starts to get a little pushy, such as getting a prostitute for him, 
Broderick tries to back out of the friendship.
The rest of the movie deals with Carrey making a living hell out of 
Broderick's life. The movie is quite creative in the situations the 
characters are placed in. A game called Porno Password is played at the 
home of Broderick's parents. In the movies funniest scene, Carrey 
purposely flirts with Broderick while Broderick is in prison and other 
prisoners are watching. There is also amusing happenings at a basketball 
game, and a hilarious jousting battle between the two at Medieval Times.
Ben Stiller has creativity in almost every scene. He paces the film well, 
and gets amusing cameos from Janeane Garofalo and Andy Dick, both alumni 
of his wonderful tv show, The Ben Stiller Show. Broderick plays it 
straight, and does a very good job of it. But the movie belongs to Carrey,
 of course, and he gives his best performance yet. And at the end, 
Stiller wonderfully explains the message of the movie in a very amusing 
sequence. The Cable Guy has a dark, satrirical edge to it that is very 
refreshing, but may not be embraced by most of Carrey's fans. If you're 
looking for Ace Ventura 3, this is the wrong movie. If you're looking for 
an energetic and intelligent black comedy, see this movie.

Starring Jim Carrey, Matthew Broderick, Leslie Mann, and Ben Stiller
Review by Laurence Mixson(venom8@hotmail.com)
A Fully Loaded Entertainment Review - Website Coming in July!
>From Ace Ventura to Truman Burbank, Jim Carrey has run the whole gamut
of comic, yet sympathetic, characters.  1996's The Cable Guy was
supposed to be his big "breakthrough" role from zany humor into darker,
more dramatic acting. As most everyone knows, the results were, well,
less-than-stellar. Not only did the film not do so hot at the box
office, but it was also panned by critics. As far as I know, Gene Siskel
and I are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it.
The first time I saw The Cable Guy, in theatres, I was in Super
Critic-mode, and didn't really like it. However, due to the fact that
HBO shows the movie every single day, I've had time to lean back, relax,
and take in the film. And to my surprise, it grew on me.
The plot is rather simple: Broderick plays a guy named Steven who
befriends his cable guy, played by Carrey, then is stalked by him when
Steven tries to break off the relationship.  See, Steven's been having
some problems with his girlfriend, Robin(Leslie Mann), and he doesn't
think he has any more room in his life for a new friend. Also, some of
the cable guy's antics have been creeping him out.
Carrey, as the cable guy, gives Steven various aliases, which later we
find out are all tv characters: Larry Tate, Chip Douglas, Ricky Ricardo,
etc. He apparently lives in his cable van, and while many critics didn't
enjoy this newer, darker, less-manic performance from Carrey, I thought
it was interesting and rather well-done.
For me, its not the movie as a whole that's enjoyable, but rather
several individual scenes: a karaoke jam at Steven's apartment, a
medieval fight at a theme restaurant, and a bathroom beating(a la Liar,
Liar), just to name a few.  Perhaps the fact that more of Carrey's
humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny.
And if you really want to see something, you've got to hear his version
of Jefferson Airplane's "Somebody to Love", sung at the aformentioned
karaoke jam.
The Cable Guy has its bad spots, like most any movie. I didn't
particularly like  Steven's girlfriend, and I felt that more focus
should have been used on the relationship between Steven and his best
friend. Also, the ending, while having you fooled for a moment, is
rather contrived, and somewhat dissapointing.
Still, I found The Cable Guy to be a worthwhile venture; if you're at
the video store and can't think of anything to rent, I suggest you try
it out. Or if you have HBO, just wait till it comes on(you won't have to
wait long.) Hell, that's what I do every day.

** out of **** (Fair for cable, don't go out of your way).
Director: Ben Stiller, Writers: Lou Holtz, Jr., and Judd Apatow, Cast: Jim Carrey (The 
Cable Guy), Matthew Broderick (Steven Kovacs), Leslie Mann (Robin), Rick (Jack Black), 
George Segal (Steven's Father), Eric Roberts (himself), Jeanne Gorafalo (Serving Wench), 
Andy Dick (Host).
I'll admit it, I'm not a very big Jim Carrey fan. THE MASK was very good, but
that was about the highlight of his career. BATMAN FOREVER was good too, but that had 
nothing to do with him at all. However, I had heard this film was very different
from what he usually does, I decided to watch it when it premiered on HBO last
night and see what all the fuss was about. This was also the movie which earned
Carrey twenty million dollars.
Carrey plays this lispy Cable installer who grew up in front of the television, and
learned everything he knows from TV. It's so bad in fact that he even assumes so many 
aliases of TV characters that we never learn his real name. One day, he arrives at the 
home of Steven Kovacs, an innocent, likable guy played nicely by Matthew Broderick, who 
has just been kicked out of his apartment by his girlfriend, Robin (appealingly played
by Leslie Mann), whom he loves and will do anything to win back, including blow off all 
of his buddies. Anyhow, Carrey juices him up with free cable, and after that latches
onto him like a bee on honey by calling him day and night and showing up wherever he 
goes. He even gives him advice on how to win Robin back. Steven hangs around with him 
for a while, but after the Cable Guy wins Robin back for him, he blows him off, and 
that's when this movie really starts to get weird. The Cable Guy gets poor Steven fired 
from his job, he wrecks his apartment, he gets him arrested, and he even lies about
Steven to Robin and his parents. Talk about fatal friendship, huh?
We gradually learn that the Cable Guy is so desperate for a friend because he
never had any of his own, he was always in front of the television as his Mom
always went out at night and left him with a babysitter. 
Instead of being the usual kooky Carrey comedy, it's a darker comedy for him, which
doesn't really work because he really has no acting ability. This movie proves 
that. He is his goofy self here, but that doesn't work in a comedy like this.
He can't act like a real actor at all, and I hope people realize he can't before
he starts to make dramatic movies and proves that for himself.
Roger Ebert stated this film could've been funnier if it wasn't a story about
how deeply troubled the Cable Guy is. It's not true. The deeply troubled Cable
Guy story has a message behind it: Kids who watch too much TV can't tell the
difference between fantasy and reality when they grow up, which is true for
most kids. But Carrey movies with messages don't work, because he can't be 
serious, and if he tried, he'd screw it up.
Jim Carrey stated you could never figure the Cable Guy out, whether he really needs
a friend or whether he's playing with Steven, which isn't true. I figured him out, he's 
a lonely nut. The one I most felt sorry for was Matthew Broderick, both character and 
actor. Steven Kovacs is a nice guy who loves his girlfriend, and does not need to be 
hounded and terrorized like he is, and Matthew Broderick is a good, talented actor who 
deserves better scripts than this, and better actors to work with than Jim Carrey. He 
does a good job, but an actor of his stature doesn't really belong in this movie,
and I asked myself watching it,"Why's he in this movie? Especially since a guy he's
a much better actor than is getting a lot more money than he is?"
It's fatal flaw is it's dark side. Because it's so dark and convincing, if you're 
not an anti-social loner, you'll become one after you see this movie, and if you 
are, this'll make you proud of it.

CAPSULE: Strangely unfunny Jim Carrey comedy that starts off on an
interesting note, but goes flat-footed in a muddled comic commentary on the
power of the media.
I watched two Jim Carrey movies back to back: one was the hysterical LIAR
LIAR, which I nearly watched from the inside of an oxygen tent from gasping
for air, and the other was the oddball CABLE GUY, which has the hints of a
far better movie inside of it somewhere. Maybe even three or four.
Matthew Broderick stars as a fellow who has broken up with his girlfriend
and is now in a bachelor pad. He calls to get cable TV installed, and the
installer who shows up -- Carrey, predictably -- turns out to be a
hyperthyroid weirdo who insists on insinuating himself in the guy's life. At
first this works -- Carrey's character is strange, but seems to have a weird
grain or three of common sense rattling around in his head somewhere. Or is
it all a sham?
The movie isn't interested in questions like that. It quickly busies itself
with a background subplot about a big-headline "tabloid TV" murder trial,
and we also soon learn that most of the Carrey character's outlook has been
shaped -- mutated? -- by TV. I thought about the splendid BEING THERE, which
started from roughly the same premise, but wasn't nearly as labored or
contrived as this movie. And in this movie, that's just one of many, many
confused and conflicting ingredients.
The single biggest problem is a failure of tone. At first the movie is just
goofy and offbeat, but then it gets dark. Dark and unpleasant, too, which is
not what a comedy needs. The Carrey characters turns out not to be a cable
company employee at all, and then freaks out, goes on a rampage, steals the
girl, etc.... in short, the movie indulges in developments that are just out
of desperation on the part of the screenwriters.
Broderick is fine in his role. Carrey is actually not bad, either, but he
has not been given a character to play, but a gimmick, and a thin one at
that. I was hoping that the movie would define itself quickly and stay with
it -- maybe the cable guy is going to help this fellow get back together
with his girl? maybe something really wonderful and unpredictable would
happen? -- but nothing of the kind turned out.
Even the big climax is wrong, and I'll happily ruin it because there's not
much else to talk about here. The Carrey character winds up falling onto a
microwave satellite dish just as the verdict in the big murder trial is
about to hit the air. The signal goes dead. And in what the filmmakers
probably thought was an intelligent touch, one of the TV viewers reaches for
a book instead. All it said to me was that these people have damned short
attention spans. The rest of the movie is flawed in the same way.

**1/2 (out of 4 = OK)
1996, PG-13, 97 minutes [1 hour, 37 minutes]
[comedy]
starring: Jim Carrey (Chip), Matthew Broderick (Steven), Leslie Mann (Robin),
Jack Black (Rick), produced by Andrew Licht, Jeffrey A. Mueller, Judd Apatow,
written by Lou Holtz Jr., directed by Ben Stiller.
"The Cable Guy" seems to have a schizophrenic personality. I can't tell if
it wants to be a wacky Jim Carrey flick (a la "Dumb And Dumber," "The Mask"),
or just another straight comedy. I think it tries to combine the two, and
even so, it doesn't work well. To make a comedy truly zany, every aspect to
it must be over the top, it cannot be remotely serious.
Jim Carrey may be a comic genius. Most of his humor stems from wild physical
antics, and the fact he can make it seem funny instead of stupid is quite an
accomplishment. Here he stars as Chip, a lonely cable installer who speaks
with a funny lisp. Like many of Carrey's characters, Chip is a human cartoon
of sorts: he says demented (but funny) things, and he does things no normal
person would do. In short, he has a very animated personality. Now all of
this is fine, the problem here is it doesn't keep with the rest of the film.
Matthew Broderick co-stars as Steven, a young businessmen who is on the outs
with his girlfriend and has just moved into a new apartment. Steven is a such
a normal character he seems a bit stiff, especially considering how charming
Broderick can be (i.e. "Ferris Bueller"). When Chip arrives to install the
cable, Steven doesn't seem to notice how silly Chip is, which is the film's
first major mistake. We can clearly see through Chip, it's obvious he's
deranged. Chip forms an almost homosexual passion for Steven, and when a
slight friendship starts between them, it doesn't seem to fit because they
are so different.
The first act contains good, funny gags and other Carrey routines. No story
or plot seems to be forming but it doesn't really matter... at first. By the
second act, a subplot involving Steven's efforts to win back his girlfriend Ro
bin (Mann) starts to become the focal point. But once we realize Carrey is
the only interesting (and funny) element to this movie, it seems irrelevant.
Eventually Steven finds Chip to be overbearing, and when he tries to "break
up" with him we get a slew of events that are more bizarre than funny.
The entire middle section seems non-existent. There had been no real plot
driving the story, so when it becomes a comedic version of "Fatal
Attraction," the transition is not very smooth. It's difficult to tell if
Chip's obsession with Steven is supposed to be plausible (at least for a
comedy). Initially, we were laughing at Carrey's cartoonish antics, but at
least they had a sense of innocence to them. His character becomes so twisted
the bit wears thin and isn't funny.
Comedies are supposed to be fun, but this film takes the bizarre obsession
too seriously. Weirdness can be funny, and this film does make some good use
of that, but the ending is so far out it doesn't make much sense.
I'm not sure what the point of "The Cable Guy" was. It's obviously intended
to be a disposable commercial comedy taking advantage of Carrey's
eccentricity, but the film becomes much stranger than it needs to be, and
thus the comedy suffers.
