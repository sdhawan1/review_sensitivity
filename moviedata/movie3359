        He has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment, raised
and cared for and imprisoned by his domineering mother.  She inspires his
love and his fear, and instills in him a similar love and fear of Jesus.
He has a rudimentary grasp of language, mouthing monosyllables and
repetitions of his mother's phrases.  He is taught that the world outside
is fatally poisonous; his mother dons a gasmask whenever she goes out the
door.  He is 35-years-old in body, but a child in mind and spirit.
        He is the premise for BAD BOY BUBBY, a defiantly original
Australian movie about a man called Bubby (Nicholas Hope) who has spent his
entire life in an awful little apartment, etc., etc.  Then one day his
father (Ralph Cotterill) appears.  His father is a shabby down-at-heels
priest who appears to have permanently misplaced his religion.
Unsurprisingly, he is not thrilled with the way "his" boy has turned out.
He is, however, rather pleased at renewing his acquaintance with the mother
(Claire Benito), and, more to the point, her ample breasts.  Soon they are
copulating on the dingy couch, while Bubby crouches, confused, in the next
room, acutely aware that the mother who had devoted all her attention to
him has a new interest.
        Bubby's relationship to the world may be warped, but it is at least
stable.  The father's arrival disturbs his precarious balance, causing an
Oedipal conflict which ends--Freud would be pleased--in violence and, as a
result, freedom.  Bubby intuits from his father's arrival that the air
outside is breathable: he leaves the apartment, his past, his world,
behind.
        So far, so good.  The first thirty minutes or so of BAD BOY BUBBY,
which bring us to this point, are quite brilliant.  The movie is at its
best when its stays within the constraints of Bubby's hermetic two-room
universe.  It follows through unrelentingly on the implications of its
premise: Bubby is used by his mother for sex, he unwittingly suffocates the
pet cat with cellophane, he is terrifed by the notion that Jesus will beat
him senseless if he sins.  It is grim and savage and appalling, but also
strangely tender--de Heer, having imagined a life as bizarre as Bubby's,
does not exaggerate for comic or grotesqe purposes, but simply empathizes.
He observes what it might be like.
        The intensity of these opening scenes, with their minimalist
mise-en-scene, immerses us in a claustrophobic environment which seems to
be a decayed stratum of our own world, and owes much to David Lynch's
ERASERHEAD, not least the ambient industrial white noise of the soundtrack.
For thirty minutes, the movie maintains the feel and mood of a reality
that does not seem far removed from our own.  Then de Heer lets Bubby out,
brings him into contact with our world, and the film never quite recovers.
        Our unlikely hero finds himself in Port Adelaide, where he wanders
the streets and meets people, where he suffers and learns and survives.
He is seduced by a young woman from a Salvation Army band (how an
anti-social half-wit with no sense of hygiene manages to get laid mere
hours after his escape is not the sort of question the film encourages,
wisely); he is given free pizza by a sympathetic waitress; he insults a
traffic cop and is punched in the stomach; he shares a few beers in the
back of a truck with a rock group; he is imprisoned and raped; he becomes a
translator for mentally handicapped people whose speech is impaired beyond
comprehension; he is loved by a motherly large-breasted nurse (Carmel
Johnson) . . .
        It goes on, by turns inventive, silly, tasteless, endearing, and
sometimes all of these things at once. De Heer never seems to be sure how
Bubby should interface with the real world: the tone shifts, uneasily, from
fable to realism to satire and back again.  The scenes which try to touch
base with a believable version of reality are the weakest; the film is best
understood as a kind of parable, and, indeed, the religious implications of
Bubby's experiences are foregrounded: icons of Jesus on the cross hang from
the mother's walls, Bubby dons a priest's collar stolen from his father, a
church organ-playing atheist lectures him on the necessity of unbelief, the
woman who redeems him is named Angel.  The manifold stresses of our world
do not shatter Bubby's mind, do not fragment him into psychosis; rather,
the world accomodates him, and heals him.
        Although de Heer's touch is at times overbearing, Bubby's salvation
is touching; what seemd at first a harsh lesson in the damaging effects of
the social construction of reality becomes a naďve humanist tale of
improbable hope.  A hapless rock group write a song about Bubby and sing it
for him and so give him the gift of community.  He returns the favour when
he steps on stage one night and becomes their frontman, turning the
fragmented impressions of his experiences into performance art, and turning
the band into a popular draw.  Innocence triumphs.  Bubby becomes a holy
fool, an idiot savant, and graces us with wisdom.  It's a strange turn of
events, but by now we shouldn't be surprised, because BAD BOY BUBBY ain't
like other movies.

BAD BOY BUBBY. 1993, Australia.
Writer/Director:  Rolf de Heer.
Cinematography:  Ian Jones
Music:  Graham Tardiff
Actors:  Nicholas Hope, Claire Benito, Carmel Johnson, Ralph Cotterill.
Running time:  114 mins.
If your sense of humour runs to blow-up dolls with huge breasts and nipples
that flash on and off like Christmas tree lights, then this movie is for
you. Every sequence of  this amazing film pushes the boundaries of bad taste
in just about every direction.  You will be flinching in your seats, as I
did, while laughing out loud at the extraordinary adventures of Bubby as he
undergoes redemption.
Set in Port Adelaide, South Australia this black comedy is certainly worth
seeing. Nicholas Hope portrays the emotionally deprived Bubby, a 35 year old
man who has been kept incarcerated all his life by his slatternly mother.
She uses him for sex and keeps him locked inside with only a cat and
cockroaches for company. Having been convinced that the air outside is
poisonous, he never tries to explore outside their ghastly two-roomed slum.
His father Pop returns, not knowing that Bubby existed, and soon thereafter
Bubby discovers new uses for clingwrap.  Emerging into the outside world,
this man-child sets about finding a life.
The filmmaker Rolf de Heer uses the style of film noir beautifully expanding
it to include disillusionment with society, manipulation of time and an
emphasis on corruption and despair.  It is an honest, raw view of the world
through Bubby's innocent eyes.
9 a.m. Monday morning could never be said to be the best time for a viewing
at a film festival but that's just what happened at the Venice Film Festival
in August 1993.  The applause in the barn-like "Palagalileo" was resounding
at the end of the credits and "Bad Boy Bubby" won the hearts of the audience
and votes of the judges.
Pitted against "Three Colours: Blue" and "Short Cuts",  "Bad Boy Bubby"
made its mark.  It won the Festival's Jury Prize, the Jury Prize for the
Italian Cinemagoers' Association (CIAK), shared the International Film
Critics' Award (FIPRESCI) with "Short Cuts", won a Bronze Plaque from the
International Catholic Organisation for Cinema and Audio-Visuals (OCIC) and
last but not least won a prize from a group of Italian high school students
who were guests at the screenings of the Festival.  
Initially the OCIC jury was divided with one member declaring that the film
was bestial and unethical and had complained to Festival management.  Some
judges were fascinated by its off-beat arresting themes but found it too
ugly according to Peter Malone, Australia's OCIC representative on the
panel.  Fortunately there were some judges who argued that the breaking of
new ground in theme and cinematic style and the fact that we live in a world
of evil needs to be seen in films that mirror this world, won through.  
The jury panel theologians referred to Psalm 130, the De Profundis psalm,
"Out of the depths, I cry to you" in their description of "Bad Boy Bubby".
This was indeed apt. It is a film that takes its audience into the depths of
brutality and the ugliness of human experience yet it reaches out in hope of
finding meaning for the experience.  
Australian film makers have never been backward in coming forward, as we have 
seen and read and Bad Boy Bubby is not a film about froth and bubbles.  This
creative child of writer/director Rolf De Heer.  Previous works of this
graduate from the Australian Film and Television School are "Tail of a
Tiger", a children's film, "Incident at Raven's Gate", a science-fiction
film, and "Dingo", a young man's dreams of emulating his idol Miles Davis.
De Heer has continued to stretch his creative ideas and explore the emotions
of childhood, this time in the emotionally immature, adult body of Bubby.  
Initially we are led to believe that Bubby is an idiot so that the film can
use the fool to bring both comedy and tragedy to its audience but it is the
character Angel who changes our perceptions when she is asked by one of the
handicap carers, "do you think he [Bubby] might be schizo?"
Angel's reply is "I don't think he's anythinghe's just akid."
Bubby's chips in.  "Bubby be a big weird kid.  
Christ kid, you're a weirdo," he says.
This major turning point in the film reinforces the theme of childhood
emotions which De Heer returns to in his films, both those made before and
since "Bad Boy Bubby". The fact that "Bad Boy Bubby" was on the cards
throughout De Heer's career until 1993  when the film came to fruition makes
the theme understandable but continued exploitation wears very thin very
quickly.  It is hoped that De Heer can go beyond  this theme in future films.
When asked, De Heer revealed that the film came from a drifting collation
of ideas' collected over a number of years of observation of people.  The
hard part he said was the organisation into a coherent whole'.  After
viewing the film one could agree.  Some parts are rather fractured and with
a limited knowledge of film-making on board a bold statement that some
scenes could be construed as fillers, bubbles to the surface.  Whether this
is poor editing or structural storyline weakness requires a more
knowledgeable critic.  De Heer did admit that the film was made from the
first draft with the only changes being made as a result of casting and
logistical reasons.  He claimed that this led to the experience being very
fulfilling for him as a writer.  This remains open to opinion.  Perhaps this
student critic has learnt more than she gives herself credit.
With the music of Salvation Army choralists, a blues band, of bagpipes,
violins and church organs throughout the film we finally hear (but don't
see) the entire piece, Handel's "Largo" from "Xerxes" performed by the
Adelaide Symphony Orchestra and conducted by Jose Serebrier  during the last
three scenes of the film completing at the end of the credit roll. 
It is the music that carries the viewer out of the theatre but the story
lingers on in this student's memory to no doubt be recalled time and time
again down the road of life.

     The theme of a person locked away for their entire life, and then
by chance released into the wide world, has been explored fairly often
in the past (BEING THERE and THE ENIGMA OF KASPAR HAUSER spring to
mind), and they generally fall into two categories: either the person
will succeed in the experience, or the world will destroy them.
     But in the low-budget Australian film BAD BOY BUBBY, this is not
really the main issue.  The person who is imprisoned is Bubby, kept
locked up for 35 years by his abusive mother in a filthy basement
flat.  He is, to all intents and purposes, an infant.  Then one day he
seizes his freedom, and escapes into the black night of the industrial
suburbs of Adelaide.  The rest is part adventure, part tragedy, and part
comedy.  It's also very intense, confronting and discomforting.  Bubby
is the target of hatred, charity, loathing and love, and this emotional
roller coaster closely parallels the experience of the audience, who
are subjected to black, ironic humour mixed with images that openly
defy the conventions of commercial cinema.
     And despite the well-worn theme, the film manages to keep you in
your seat.  It doesn't have the usual monotonic form of a mainstream
film (an opening exposition, followed by a steady, direct run to a
clear resolution); instead, it vacillates between joy and despair.
Bubby has good days and bad days; the audience gets to ride up and down
with him.
     And despite his naivete and inability to cope, at no point does
Bubby become pathetic.  In the end, he is resilient, and the audience
sees him grow up very quickly without losing his identity.  This, in
spite of all the cruelty that he experiences and inflicts.
     And the visual imagery in the film is amazing.  It is almost
wholly bleak, dark, and at times positively Hogarthian, with a lot of
attention paid to the texture of dirty skin, the sagging of folds of
fat, the dull fall of artificial light, and the patina of used, worn
surfaces.  It's a visual experience that you can also feel and smell,
and it's both repellent and oddly appealing.  The dark visuals add
directly to the film's black humour; both Bubby and his new-found world
are, in places, very, very funny in their cruelty and stupidity.
     It must be said, though, that not everybody will enjoy this film.
It's probably unconventional enough to discomfort most viewers, and the
first forty minutes are set in a tiny, claustrophobic space, and are
quite difficult to watch at times; plus the film directly addresses the
matter of what is beautiful, and the way that women are used in movies.
(Not in any overt way, mind you; it's just there if you want to look
for it.)  And on the subject of sex, this film has a lot of it, and
it's quite explicit, but the way it operates on the viewer is subtle
and strange.  It isn't simple eroticism.
     There is also the matter of the final resolution, which I found
somewhat disappointing; on the other hand, I think that it was
unavoidable, given where the film was going.  Some of the acting is
also a tad uninspired, possibly because those actors weren't
experienced.
     In summary, this low-budget film is an amazing experience; its
good points overwhelm its flaws, and I can only say that it's
thoroughly watchable, and probably headed for a cult following.
