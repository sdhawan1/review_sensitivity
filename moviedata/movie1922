"When I look back on my childhood, I wonder how my brothers and I 
managed to survive at all" is the first line of Angela's Ashes. As 
people look back on this film they too will wonder how they ever 
survived. The movie's biggest flaw is that the two and a half hour 
duration goes at the rate of a Leslie Nielson death scene. Misery does 
love company and this examination of Irish misery finds plenty of 
company so as not to leave this one aching flaw alone.20
Angela's Ashes must know just how uninteresting it is. There is no other 
explanation for what transpires in the first 30 minutes: three children 
die; the filmmakers resort to this oldest, most melodramatic technique 
not once, but three times. Then, as if the movie realizes that there are 
only so many characters who can pass away, the work ventures away from 
the morbid and tries to find a plot. But there is none to be found; so 
the deaths resume, just at a slower rate. Filling the now-longer gaps is 
Hollywood's second oldest emotional stunt: The Alcoholic Father.
Despite being absent a plot, Angelas Ashes does have a setting: Ireland 
during a time when students could openly ponder "What use is Euclid when 
the Germans are bombing everything in sight?" The production centers 
around a young boy and his family. The mother, Angela (Emily Watson who 
is far too plump for this poverty-stricken role), has no qualms with 
picking coals off the street to warm her often-sick family members. The 
father, Malachy (Robert Carlyle who's acting is quite possibly the only 
good part of the movie, even if it is just a reprisal of his role in the 
acclaimed The Full Monty) thinks otherwise, insisting "We're not 
beggars" and scolding "You have no pride, Angela." In reality, he is the 
one without pride who begs for money not to cloth his family but to 
provide the almighty "pint." On one occasion the narrator, Frank, 
comments of his father "A man who drinks the money for a new baby has 
gone beyond the beyonds." Get the picture? Good. That was 140 minutes in 
one paragraph. (And my editor says I'm not concise enough!)
Those not familiar with the IRA, Oedipus and "The Consumption" might 
struggle with what little this highbrow film has to offer. Those who 
prefer popcorn during their trips to the cinema might struggle with a 
guilt trip. Those fans of Monet might struggle to have any appreciation 
for a re-occurring scenery shot clearly ripped out of one of his 
paintings. Those of the non-anarchist persuasion might struggle with the 
film's anti-debt moral. Those with limited or even normal attention 
spans will struggle with the movie's length. Those that enjoy good films 
will struggle with the overall lack of quality. These struggles are not 
nearly as bad as the poverty depicted in Angela's Ashes, but there still 
is no reason to voluntarily subject yourself to them, much less pay for 
them.

  Ireland is magical place. To tourists, at least, the country is
a verdant paradise whose misty climate yields beautiful
complexions on this earth's most beautiful women. No
wonder, then, that while one out of six Americans is of Irish
descent, more than fifty percent (a rough guess) of its
Hollywood actors might claim the Emerald Isle as their
ancestral homeland.
   But like the azure and gorgeous islands of the Caribbean,
the country is flawed by poverty.  Currently Ireland has a
twenty percent unemployment rate, while most of those lucky
enough to have kissed the Blarney Stone and found jobs are
not about to find themselves ever among the Fortune 500. 
But poverty, in rare instances, can give way to fame and
fortune.  Take Frank McCourt, for example.  He turned his
dirt-poor, abused background in a veritable pig sty into a
cash cow for himself.  His book, "'Tis," is currently the
number one New York Times best-seller and the story of his
earlier days, "Angela's Ashes," made the same list in 1996.
Why so?  After all, most of the world's people are poor--dirt
poor when compared to middle-class Americans--and a fair
number of these destitute folks have risen by their bootstraps. 
So what puts McCourt's books over the top?  I'd say the
writing.  When he learned at the age of 15 that he could
make his words dance--from the time he began writing
threatening letters for a Limerick moneylender--he was on his
way to shucking the bicycle he had been using as a deliverer
of telegrams, squeezed together enough money (literally by
hook and crook), and took off for the United States to escape
his indigence.
   Alan Parker's filmed version follows the highlights of the
1996 autobiography, giving the audience at least a taste of
just about every dramatic occurrence of the volume.  Andrew
Bennett's periodic narration fills us in to details which could
not be effectively dramatized while at the same time giving us
an encounter with McCourt's way with words.  We're on our
way into the life of a man from age five to age fifteen, a life
that is alternately bleak and fun-filled, with incidents both
morose and humorous.  Michael Seresin's camera lens is
bathed in light green not so much to symbolize the lushness
of Ireland but to signify the dreary, rain-soaked misery of the
poor sections of Limerick where most of the story is filmed.
   Young Frank (Joe Breen), the kid whose adorable, freckle-
faced mug is on the ads for the film, did not have to wait long
for tragedy to hit his family.  When he was five years old he
witnessed the deaths of one brother and one sister, attending
a burial ceremony that was financed by the standard church-
sponsored giver of charity in the town.  His family is poor not
so much because of the numbers of brothers and sisters he
has but because Ireland as a whole was suffering from the
bad times of the 1930s and Frank's dad (Robert Carlyle) was
using the meager money he received on the dole to support
the Guinness family.  The McCourts trekked from Brooklyn to Limerick,
perhaps to escape the poverty they faced in the Williamsburg
section, only to land in an Ireland which could not grant them
so much as a lavatory in the hall.  Much is made of the way
the neighbors would use the drainpipe outside the McCourt
shack to pour their slop buckets, which emitted an odor which
one tenant advised would require the use of gas masks
during the warm weather.  The "lobby" of the building was
permanently under water, the three-member welfare board
would show their contempt for the family's pleas in the
presence of scores of other applicants, and all the teachers
save one would take pleasure in slapping the hands of any
boys who did not know that Eamon de Valera and Michael
Collins were the greatest men who ever lived.  
   Frank McCourt's poverty was apparently worse than that of
the other kids in the school.  In one instance he had to wear
shoes so broken-down and glued together that the entire
population of young pupils roared with laughter.  When Frank
would return to his home, life was no better, as the people in
his family on the side of his mother Angela (Emily Watson)
showed their contempt for the Northern Ireland background of
Frank's dad.  
   Home, Church, School and Government failed the
McCourts, though much of the humor in the movie comes
from the confessions that the 10-year-old Frank (Ciaran
Owens) and the 15-year-old boy (Michael Legge) give in
church.  When Frank reaches the mature age of 15 he enjoys
his first pint, has his first brief affair with an older girl afflicted
with consumption, and takes the big step of returning alone to
America while his mother continues prostituting herself to the
building's landlord.  His dad is permanently abroad in
England despite his statement that he wouldn't give that
country "the steam off my piss."
   The difference between this successfully adapted version
of "Angela's Ashes" and other movies that center on
extended progeny like the highly marketed "Magnolia" is that
the former always feels as though it is dealing with real
people suffering real problems while almost everything about
"Magnolia" is contrived.  Watching the film, you gain a greater
appreciation of America, a land which during the 30s and 40s
is glorified by the most scholarly of Frank's teacher as a
Shangri-La.  There is even a mock Statue of Liberty atop one
of the buildings that reminds us of a similar effigy held aloft
on one majestic day in Beijing's Tienanmen Square.  We get
more of a sense of why so many people from so many
foreign lands have come to America's shores, not only for
economic opportunity but for a sense of freedom from the
taunts of people whose races and religions and lifestyles are
different from their own.  Nowhere in the U.S. do we witness
the scandalous friction between Catholics and Protestants
suggested in this film, and presumably even the poorest
people with roofs over their heads have lavatories available
to them.  "Angela's Ashes" is a gem for the sort of audience
that needs no fast-cutting and no contrived conflicts, but a
real story about real people with real problems.  Is this the
sort of film that Hollywood studios like Paramount and
Universal should continue supporting?
Rated R.  Running Time: 145 minutes.  (C) 1999

     I have not read the much-loved memoir by Frank McCourt on which
ANGELA'S ASHES is based, but every indication is that the film re-creates
McCourt's Limerick of the 1930s and 1940s magnificently. Cramped Roden
Lane sits on the banks of an ersatz river of human waste and runoff from
the incessant rains; children scamper through the streets in tattered
clothing and bare feet; typhoid, fleas, consumption and conjunctivitis
plague the young. It's a life of almost inhuman squalor, compounded by the
effects of unemployment and alcoholism. It's the kind of life you might
not believe existed if someone hadn't committed his life story to the
page.
     As a snapshot of existence in this particular time and place, Alan
Parker's adaptation of ANGELA'S ASHES is exemplary. As a compelling story,
it's not half as effective. The events begin in 1935, with Irish
immigrants Malachy (Robert Carlyle) and Angela McCourt (Emily Watson) 
living in New York with their five children, including eldest son Frank
(Joe Breen as a 6-year-old). After the death in infancy of the youngest
girl, the McCourts decide to return to Limerick, home of Angela's family. 
Things are not much better there, as Malachy is rarely able to find work,
and drinks what little money he manages to earn. It is left to Frank to
grow up quickly and help the family, shoveling coal as a young teen
(Ciaran Owens) and becoming a telegram delivery boy as an older teen
(Michael Legge) to help the family and fulfill his dream of returning to
America.
     Biographical stories can be tricky to pull off dramatically, since
it's easy to portray them as a series of stand-alone episodes rather than
part of a thematically consistent story. That's the problem that plagues
ANGELA'S ASHES in Parker's attempt to maintain the integrity of McCourt's
tales. This is a film composed almost entirely of vignettes: Frank's First
Communion, Frank's work on the coal heap, Frank's visit with some
classmates to see his first naked girls, etc. Some of them amuse, and some
of them are touching, but few of them resonate the way it seems they
should. When teenage Frank begins a furtive relationship with a
house-bound consumptive girl, there's the sense we should feel his
emotions as a defining moment in his life. Instead, it plays as just one
more vignette in a life of First Communion, work on the coal heap and
seeing naked girls.
     The one place ANGELA'S ASHES does resonate -- if all too briefly --
is in the portrayal of Frank's father. Malachy is a complex character
whose life is doomed by the combination of his own weakness and his nerve
of being a Northern Irishman living in Limerick; McCourt's story
recognizes the prejudice that keeps Malachy from work, while still
acknowledging how he ruins the few opportunities he does get. Carlyle's
performance, combining a strange pride and sincere intentions with a
pathetic sickness of the soul, is one of the best things about ANGELA'S
ASHES (Emily Watson, by comparison, has little to do but smoke and look
determined). The wrenching moments in which Malachy disappoints his family
-- particularly when Frank tries to balance his disappointment with his
love for his father -- give the film its emotional weight. When Malachy
leaves the narrative, it never quite has as much to say.
     I'm told that McCourt's book uses a first person, present tense
narrative structure, allowing readers to view his experiences through the
eyes of the child he was. I can imagine that device giving his experiences
more immediacy, something to sustain the story beyond mere sympathy for
young Frank's plight. As a film, ANGELA'S ASHES works mostly as a period
record, with production designer Geoffrey Kirkland, costume designer
Consolata Boyle and cinematographer Michael Seresin working their
technical magic on a somber, straightforward script. Too much of it is
admirable without necessarily being engaging, serving as a mere litany of
childhood miseries. Without the father/son angle that had served the film
so well, ANGELA'S ASHES drifts into two and a half hours of variations on
a grim, grimy theme.

Starring Robert Carlyle, Emily Watson, Joe Breen, Ciaran Owens, Michael
Legge. Directed by Alan Parker. Rated R.
Few films in 1999 have divided the critical consensus as sharply as
Alan Parker's adaptation of Frank McCourt's memoir Angela's Ashes. Many
dismissed it as an humorless, sentimentalized, uninteresting version of
the hugely popular novel; others hailed it as a heartfelt, sincere
portrait of the human spirit. I'm somewhere in between, leaning
strongly towards the latter. It's certainly well-made and it never
becomes tedious like some literary adaptations have a tendency to be.
But I have a feeling that Parker filled the movie with pseudo-lyrical
shots of rain falling on the homely streets of Ireland just so it can
have the two-and-a-half hour running time that screams "I'm important!"
McCourt's book of the same name was about him and his family moving
from the US to Ireland in the early 1900's, a time when most people
were desperately trying to get into the US. As he comments, "we were
the only Irishfolk to say goodbye to the Statue of Liberty." In
Ireland, Frank (played by Joe Breen as a small child), his 3 brothers,
his mother Angela (Emily Watson) and his father Malachy (Robert
Carlyle) get financial help from Angela's mother, a stereotypically
strict Catholic who chides her daughter for marrying a Northern
Irishman.
She helps them get a rat-infested apartment and Malachy goes looking
for a job. Positions are scarce and when he does finally find one, he
is unable to hold on to it because of his fondness for drinking.
Meanwhile, Frank goes to an uptight Catholic school, where the
instructors beat students with blunt wooden objects as often as their
heart desires. Two of Frank's brothers soon die, crippled by the
dreadful living conditions and malnutrition. As if the poverty and the
suffering weren't intense enough as it stood, Malachy and Angela have
another baby, worsening the situation further.
I imagine this doesn't sound like much of a plot. That's probably
because it isn't one. These are people. This is their story. Director
Alan Parker (The Commitments) knows how to tell a good story and
Angela's Ashes, despite its relentlessly literary tone remains
interesting. Though the film occasionally indulges too much in its
gloomily picturesque Irish setting, it avoids looking like a glorified
travelogue.
Supplementing Parker's able direction are the engaging, often poignant
performances of the leads, some of them seasoned thespians, others
relative beginners. Carlyle, the charismatic British actor who has
shown astonishing range by hopping from the lead in a rowdy slapstick
comedy to the villain in a James Bond movie and now to sentimental
melodrama, perfectly portrays his rather pathetic character. We
empathize with the guy, but we don't like or admire him. Emily Watson
turns in a heartfelt, sincere supporting performance. It is mostly she
who implants that lump in our throats. Also worthy of mention is little
Joe Breen, whose face graces the film's superb poster. It is Breen's
first feature film and he's extraordinary as young Frank. Not unlike
sudden Oscar darling Haley Joel Osment of The Sixth Sense, you can peer
into the character's soul through Breen's sad eyes.
On the flip side, one thing that could have vastly improved Angela's
Ashes is a more decisive editor. While Gerry Hambling sure makes the
most of the scenery, he and Parker also leave in at least a half an
hour of unnecessary footage. The first half, especially, could have
been trimmed down, bringing the film to a more reasonable running time
and doing our bladders a favor in the process. Things pick up at about
the halfway point, sort of dismissing a lot of the criticisms I
accumulated during the opening hour, but I maintain that the
aggressively deliberate pace Parker and Co. set in the first half was
ludicrously unnecessary.
*Spoiler Warning! Skip next paragraph if in suspense!*
The film's final message is somewhat conflicted, as Frankie, in effect,
leaves his family famished in Ireland while he himself goes back to
America. What, exactly, are we supposed to make of that? His mother
doesn't seem to mind because she wants the best possible future for her
son, as any mother would, but it still seems inconsiderate of him. I
haven't read the book, but I'm sure that McCourt justifies his actions
therein; therefore, I'm suspicious. Another thing that's never made
clear in the movie is the meaning of the title, which, I'm sure, is
also explained in the memoir.
If seen as a film onto itself, rather than an adaptation, Angela's
Ashes stands tall. Despite a few minor setbacks, it is a captivating
story of people forced to live in the trenches by an merciless society
where those of weaker character are shoved to the bottom of the
financial ladder.

Rated on a 4-star scale
Screening venue: Odeon (Liverpool City Centre)
Released in the UK by UIP on 14 January, 1999; certificate 15; 145 minutes; 
countries of origin Ireland/USA; aspect ratio 1.85:1
Directed by Alan Parker; produced by David Brown, Alan Parker, Scott Rudin.
Written by Laura Jones, Alan Parker; based on the memoir by Frank McCourt.
Photographed by Michael Seresin; edited by Gerry Hambling.
At first, things did not look good for Frank McCourt. The eldest of six 
children in a poor Irish family, born in America before his parents made the 
fatal decision to go back to the old country looking for work, he witnessed 
three of his siblings die before he was old enough to take his first 
communion. His family, living in Limerick in the '30s and '40s, had to put up 
with a flooded house next to a communal lavatory, a city plagued by 
tuberculosis and a man of the house with a fondness for the drink. Malachy 
McCourt didn't often have a job, but when he did, the wages were spent on 
Guinness.
And yet Frank did endure, and prevail. He coped with a no-good father, 
lunatic teachers and bouts of conjunctivitis and diptheria; then returned to 
America, got a degree, became a teacher and wrote a pair of best-selling 
autobiographies, "Angela's Ashes" and "'Tis". The movie rights to Frank's 
memoirs were quickly snapped up -- unsurprising, as tales of hardship, 
poverty, misery and escape are just what studios need for their Oscar season 
prestige releases.
The film of "Angela's Ashes" has been directed by Alan Parker, whose credits 
make him seem ideal: "The Commitments" was an Irish film, "Bugsy Malone" was 
filled with wonderful child performances and few big movies are as harsh as 
"Midnight Express" or "Mississippi Burning". Here, however, he doesn't have 
so much as a basic grasp on the material -- this should not be the story of 
Frank McCourt's suffering, but that of his survival, and what should be 
emphasised is the way he maintained his sanity by using gallows humour and 
ambitious dreaming. Instead, the movie shows us a series of miserable 
vignettes, which end with Frank suddenly hopping onto a boat to get away from 
everything.
There is never any rhythm established; Parker has just filmed all the moments 
of the book that took place in Limerick and edited them together in a way 
that keeps jumping ahead but still takes two-and-a-half hours to end. He and 
his co-writer, Laura Jones, should have taken a look at Steven Spielberg's 
brilliant adaptation of "The Color Purple", another rambling, episodic novel 
about growing up in brutal surroundings. It makes clear the main character's 
wish to reunite with her sister, and uses that ever-present desire as the 
backbone of the film, to give some significance to everything else that goes 
on. Here, the scenes in America are over before the opening credits, and 
we're left with no indication that Frank even remembers the place, let alone 
that he yearns to go back there more than anything.
The film stars Emily Watson and Robert Carlyle, but even the acting is off. 
People who are unfamiliar with the source material will still be able to 
detect which lines are direct quotes -- the performers seem to say them in 
respectful inverted commas, after solemn dramatic pauses. There is no life 
here, especially not in the narrator, Andrew Bennett, whose flat, forced, 
monotonous delivery kills every bit of irony and truth the script assigns him.
"Angela's Ashes" is a terrific production, with realistic period detail and 
atmospheric photography. But it bewilders me that this is the film Parker, 
one of the best of all working directors, has been so publicly exerting 
himself over for the past two years. Perhaps he put so much effort into 
worrying about getting it right that he forgot to actually do so. Is it a 
dull waste of time, talent and toil? 'Tis.

Angela's Ashes
Rating (out of five): **1/2
Starring Emily Watson, Robert Carlyle, Joseph Breen, Ciaran Owens, Michael
Legge, Shane Murray-Corcoran, Ronnie Masterson and Pauline McLynn
Directed by Alan Parker
Written by Laura Jones (based on the memoirs of Frank McCourt)

Running 145 minutes
I've never been one to subscribe to any kind of standardized rules for
filmmaking, but one thing I do believe is that every movie should have a
point. Otherwise, it's just a waste of time.
While some movies may exist simply as eye-candy and may not persue any
lofty, artistic objectives, at least they have their sights set on
something - entertainment. What's so frustrating about Alan Parker's latest
film, Angela's Ashes, is that it's void of any narrative aspirations
whatsoever. While it may be full of outstanding performances and skillful
direction, all it really amounts to is two hours and twenty minutes of rain,
sickness, death, rain, and humiliation. Did I mention the rain?
Perhaps all this is supposed to serve as a metaphor for the poverty-stricken
childhood of Frank McCourt, who came of age in the turbulent landscape of
pre-WWII Limerick. One of six children (three of which die before the film's
twenty minute mark) growing up in the Irish slums during the late 1930's,
McCourt did eventually escape from poverty to America, where he wrote the
best-selling memoir upon which the movie is based.
The critical cliché has been to dismiss the film version of Angela's Ashes
for being dry of the apparent wit and livelihood that peppered McCourt's
original memoirs. Having not read his book, I can't jump on that bandwagon,
and thus wish to point out another glaring folly; while the movie is
definitely without any humor or relief, it's also mind-numbing in its
tedium. Really, how many times can one watch an infant die from
malnutrition, only to have their father go out and drink away the family
income? It's depressing, disconcerting, and, above all, totally without
point. I don't need to see the same thing in succession in order to realize
what a horrible childhood McCourt suffered.
Not that I have anything against films dealing with depressing themes; some
of my favorite movies include such classic downers as Last Tango in Paris
and Leaving Las Vegas, as well as the more recent, though equally bleak,
Magnolia. What separates these films from the likes of Angela's Ashes is
their tendency towards emotional catharsis. On the contrary, this film
features the most anticlimactic ending in recent memory.
What disappoints me most about Angela's Ashes is the amount of talent that
went into it, only to come up with something so mediocre. There's no arguing
the skills of actress Emily Watson (who plays the title role of Angela), and
Robert Carlyle (as the imposing drunken father) is emerging as one of the
best character actors around. Indeed, they are both nearly flawless in their
respective roles. With a director as talented as Alan Parker (Angel Heart,
The Commitments) helming the production, you'd think that nothing could
possibly go wrong.
In my eyes, many things did go wrong. But maybe, just maybe, Angela's Ashes
has turned out exactly as the filmmakers intended. In fact, perhaps the
movie did have a point after all - to harbor awards. Before opening day, it
had some of the heaviest Oscar buzz around, no doubt generated by the
subject matter alone. Now that it has opened, however, it has revealed
itself to be a drab, murky bore.

ANGELA'S ASHES opens with the bitterly sad death of a 2-day old baby
girl.  She was to be the first girl in a family with 4 young boys.  Her
death will be far from the last in this true, tragic tale, set mainly in
an inhospitable Ireland in the 1930's and 1940's.
Based on Frank McCourt's Pulitzer Prize winning autobiography, the story
has just enough humorous overtones to make it bearable.  Andrew
Bennett's richly melodious narration injects so much honest humor that
you'll likely view the movie with dry but sympathetic eyes.
"When I look back on my childhood," the narrator tells us, "I wonder how
my brothers and I managed to survive at all.  It was, of course, a
miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while.
Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish
childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood."
The star of the production is poverty itself.  Not the genteel brand we
usually encounter in movies, but an abject poverty so intense that Frank
licks the newspaper that once held his friend's fish and chips.  Frank's
family tears down a wall of their apartment one cold winter in order to
have fuel for the fire.  All 6 members of the McCourt family sleep in
the same bed, which is subject to attack by fleas.  And the kids live in
filth and muck, although the parents manage to stay fairly clean.  This
level of destitution, malnutrition and misery makes typical cinematic
poverty look downright luxurious in comparison.
Poverty's strong supporting cast includes Emily Watson (HILARY AND
JACKIE), as Angela, the mother, and Robert Carlyle (THE FULL MONTY), as
the dad.  In a limited role that offers few opportunities, Watson is
called upon just to endure.  And endure she does with all the
resoluteness she can muster.  Watson does it so well that she will
likely get her third Oscar nomination.
Carlyle is given the juiciest part, as her dipsomaniac husband, who is
unemployed and unemployable.  Even if their latest baby is starving,
there's no food in the house and no coal for the fire, he'll head to the
pub and drink up their last penny.  The most amazing part of his role is
that it's a sympathetic one.  We sympathize with the father's weaknesses
while, at the same time, we hate him for it.  And the bond between Frank
and his dad is genuine and touching.
Picture postcard Ireland makes few guest appearances in the film, which
has more in common with FANTASIA's Sorcerer's Apprentice segment than a
travelogue.  Director Alan Parker (EVITA) shows the country at its
wettest and poorest.  Torrential rains fall constantly on the
dilapidated buildings.  Michael Seresin's fascinating cinematography
looks like the film stock was developed in the streets' dirty rainwater,
which perfectly reflects the mood of the story.  John Williams delivers
a dramatic score that's a bit over the top at times, but fits in with
the dramatic bleakness of the storyline.
As he ages, Frank is played by a succession of actors (Joseph Breen, Joe
Breen, Ciaran Owens and Michael Legge).  Each is so well cast that it's
hard to choose a favorite.  All of them portray Frank's chief trait --
he's a survivor.  No matter how hard it gets, Frank finds a way to cope.
Far from a perfect film, the script by Laura Jones and the director,
tries to pack in too much material and too many incidents.  The director
lets his movie drift when it should be kept more tightly focused, and
the final cut of the film is easily a half hour too long.  Still, it
possesses an impeccable honesty and humanity that speaks to our hearts
and our minds.
ANGELA'S ASHES runs 2:25.  It is rated R for some profanity, nudity,
sexuality and violence and would be fine for most teenagers.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Attempting to adapt Frank McCourt's beloved bestseller Angela's Ashes is
a heck of an undertaking.  I'm not sure that many filmmakers would be
able to pull it off at all, let alone be able to present a decent
finished version to the teeming masses that devoured McCourt's
autobiography.  But Alan Parker and his crew show that they were more
than up to the challenge, and their bleak and haunting film will
certainly satisfy the appetite of Angela's rabid readers.
Like the book, Ashes starts with the impoverished McCourt family living
in a dank, muddy, rain-soaked tenement in New York City.  Unable to make
ends meet in the new world, the family high-tails it back to Limerick,
Ireland, leaving young five-year-old Frank and his family in the rare
position of waving `goodbye' to the Statue of Liberty.  Unfortunately,
Limerick was the only place in the world danker, muddier and rainier
than New York's slums.  In fact, the film depicts the housing in New
York and Limerick almost identically  old, decaying stone structures
threatening to crush the feeble hopes and dreams of anyone that dare
enter.
Frank's parents almost seem like caricatures, with mum Angela (Emily
Watson, Cradle Will Rock) barely able to muster enough energy to keep
spreading her legs and popping out kids, and dad Malachy (Robert
Carlyle, The World is Not Enough), an on-the-dole drunkard that can
neither hold down a job nor win the favor of his in-laws that despise
the fact he's a Protestant from Northern Ireland.  Frank starts out as
the oldest of four boys, but the McCourts gain and lose kids at such an
amazing pace, it's hard to keep track of the exact number at any given
point in the film.  It probably wasn't until the Kennedys burst on to
the scene that a more tragic family existed.
While you've probably seen dirt poor 30s families portrayed in film
before, Ashes kicks it up a couple of notches.  The McCourts are so poor
that they don't have a pot to piss in; they use a bucket.  Their first
floor is constantly underwater, and their neighbor's sewage ran down the
drainpipe outside their ramshackle abode.  Each family member is so
caked in filth and has so much dirt under their fingernails that you'll
want to go home and scrub your fingers raw while sitting in a steaming
hot tub as soon as you get home.
The story follows Frank's life from age five to sixteen, when he
returned to the United States.  In between, he suffered from hunger,
typhoid and conjunctivitis.  Frank is played by three different young
actors (Joseph Breen, Ciaran Owens and Michael Legge) and each does a
fine job looking destitute and downcast.  Watson and Carlyle contribute
to the film's acting pedigree, but the majority of Ashes' magic occurs
behind the camera.
Although Parker hasn't made a film since Evita, he shows that he is
still one of the most talented directors today.  Parker's script, which
he co-wrote with Oscar and Lucinda's Laura Jones, does a good job
incorporating the major points of  McCourt's novel into the film without
keeping it from getting too out of hand.  Cinematographer Michael
Seresin, who worked on Parker's earlier (and considerably darker) films
like Birdy and Angel Heart, and six-time Oscar nominee and longtime
Parker editor Gerry Hambling both do an amazing job at creating a very
realistic Depression era.  If the poignant images don't get to you, John
William's score swells in enough of the right places to all but
guarantee a lump in your throat.
2:25  R for adult language, some mild adult situations and the
realistic portrayal of a dirt-poor family

 The title: Angela's Ashes refers to cigarettes and not cremation.  If
someone had told me this before I had entered the film, I might have
enjoyed it more than I did.  Then again, if someone had told me about
the rest of the film, I might have asked for a final cigarette before
going in to Angela's Ashes.
 Such is the price of not reading your press packet.
 Angela's Ashes is Alan Parker's adaptation of Frank McCourt's
Pulitzer-Prize-Winning book.  Like most Pulitzer-Prize-winners and their
film adaptations, the adjective "long" is a good way to describe the
movie.  Despite having a shorter time than the three-hour Magnolia
(Angela's Ashes clocks in at two-and-a-half), Angela's Ashes feels much
more drawn out.
 Angela's Ashes, unlike most films that never have a resolution, does
not feel like it is going nowhere fast.  It feels like it is going
nowhere very slowly.  Coming out of the theatre, that is the basic
impression that I lifted off of the film.  In the beginning, McCourt
claims that "Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the Irish
miserable childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic
childhood."  The rest of the movie attempts to drill in this point.
 While it is drilling in this point, the film also attempts to tackle
(but never knocks down) such issues as prostitution, alcoholism, and the
Catholic Church.  I saw it, in fact, at a special screening for critics
and Catholic clergy.  The film takes on classically Irish and local
topics, and has its actors adopt a thick Irish accent (as if Emily
Watson and Robert Carlyle didn't have thick enough accents already.).
The script is thick with colloquialisms.
 Despite a wonderful managing of the struggles of making an American
film about the Irish, the film does a terrible mismanaging of its plot.
The film is very unfocused, jumping from topic to topic and never having
a resolution along any lines that the film accentuates.
 To its strong credit, I found that Angela's Ashes is able to push my
emotional buttons.  This is not to say I liked the film.  It is to say
that Emily Watson delivers an outstanding performance, Robert Carlyle
does his usual work (that is, an exceptional job), and Michael Legee
plays Frank McCourt to a tear-jerking (almost) T.  John Williams helps
everyone out with a score that, devoid of which, the film could not have
survived.  Also, a degree of religious humor helps the film's pacing.
 I must admit that this is a film that I believe only Irish Catholics
can enjoy.  It is so regional and so tied in with Catholicism that it
shuns the outsider.  Since I am neither Irish nor Catholic I wouldn't
really know, but the Irish Catholic audience seemed to enjoy it, and
since the film has little else to its credit, that has to be the
explanation.
 It has to be, because without local support and acting and music, the
film can't stand on its own two emaciated legs.

Susan Granger's review of "ANGELA'S ASHES" (Paramount Pictures)
Whereas a novel is written to be appreciated for its language
and literary integrity, a movie is a visual medium. Most often, the
books that make the best films are those with clear narratives and
focused stories. In Angela's Ashes, author Frank McCourt put the
entire story inside the mind of a character and focus solely on that
character's inner world - what he is thinking, feeling,
remembering. While filmmaker Alan Parker has dealt with the Irish
before in The Commitments, he now, working with writer Laura Jones,
meticulously evokes McCourt's saga of poverty, pain, ignorance, and
the death of three children. But their anecdotal screenplay fails to
capture the Irish-American writer's lilting wit and emotional
poetry. The story begins in 1935 in Brooklyn as the titular Angela
(Emily Watson) falls apart when her baby daughter dies, and the
family, consisting of her irresponsible, alcoholic wastrel of a
husband (Robert Carlyle), Frank and his brothers, goes back to
Limerick, Ireland. As McCourt noted in his opening paragraph, that was
a big mistake. Life in the miserable, wet, filthy Roden Lane slum -
painstakingly recreated by production designer Geoffrey Kirkland and
captured by cinematographer Michael Seresin - is awful, and, at
school, Frank's teachers are either religious or nationalistic
fanatics. It isn't until he's a teenager, working as a mailman, that
life begins to hold possibilities, particularly the promise of
returning, alone, to America. Three actors - Joe Breen, Ciaran Owens,
and Michael Legge - play Frank as the resilient boy-to-man who bravely
copes with his dysfunctional family and rises above his terrifying
travails. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, Angela's Ashes is a
respectful but depressing, grim 7, giving one a greater appreciation
of America as the land of hope and promise.

Angela's Ashes (1999) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Emily Watson,
Robert Carlyle, Joe Breen, Ciaran Owens and Michael Legge. Written by
Alan Parker and Laura Jones. Directed by Parker.
 In a strange, almost perverse way, "Angela's Ashes" is a feel-good
movie. You stumble out of the theater after watching two-plus hours
about one family coping with a poverty level that is unimaginable to
most of us, and you want to clasp your hands and whisper a prayer to
whatever deity you worship, thanking him (or her) for whatever bounties
you have.
 Many will find the abject misery displayed in this adaptation of Frank
McCourt's Pulitzer Prize-winning memoir hard to ingest.
 What keeps the movie from being unbearably morose is the bits of humor
displayed throughout the proceedings. Even amidst the most dire of
circumstances - and as long as they are together - the McCourts can
rummage for scraps of happiness.
 Director Alan Parker's adaptation is wet and bleak. Death is a constant
neighbor, hunger a daily playmate, despair a daily companion.
 Set mostly in Limerick, Ireland, in the 1930s and 40s, "Angela's
Ashes" almost revels in the displaying the hardships endured by the
McCourts.
 Children are born, then die.  The local church is no help, neither are
the local charities who would rather judge than assist.
 Part of the problem is simple prejudice. Malachy McCourt (Robert
Carlyle) is a Protestant from Belfast. But his wife, Angela (Emily
Watson) is a Catholic girl from Limerick. In a nation with such
sectarian hatred and religious divisiveness as Ireland, such a union is
scandalous.
 Plus, Malachy is a wastrel. He drinks and cannot hold a job. His only
function is to entertain his children with tall tales and legends from
Irish history.
 The McCourts are a family, as an adult Frank narrates, that do things
backwards. 
 The family leaves the slums of Brooklyn, N.Y., to return to a harsher,
more unforgiving live back in Limerick.
 Parker presents all the wants and hunger and humiliations suffered by
the McCourts with a journalist's objectivity. It would have been so easy
to transform "Angela's Ashes" into a maudlin tear-jerker in which you
could only feel sorry for this pitiful family.
 Yet Parker creates - not a nobility - but an admirable fortitude so
that you feel uncomfortable pitying the McCourts.
 The film's performances are splendid. Watson, with her saintly visage,
seems so soft, yet she is a woman of indomitable strength who goes to
any lengths, makes any sacrifice to keep her family together and a roof
over its head.
 Carlyle is a dreamer, a drunkard, but not really a bad man. He is weak
and overwhelmed, proud and stubborn. Yet he is a loving and caring
father and husband.
 Three young actors portray Frank at various stages and the
transformation from one to the other is seamless. All three - Joe Breen
(Young Frank, age 5 to 8), Ciaran Owens (Middle Frank, age 10 to 13) and
Michael Legge (Older Frank), all display the gaunt, hollow-eyed, gnawing
pangs that constant hunger creates. But they all also show spirit and an
energy that allows Frank to constantly battle back.
 In the beginning, the film's narrator intones the opening of McCourt's
book: `When I look back on my childhood, I wonder how my brothers and I
managed to survive at all. It was ... a miserable childhood; the happy
childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable
childhood is the miserable Irish childhood; and worse yet is the
miserable Irish Catholic childhood.'
 Parker, who adapted McCourt's book with Laura Jones, has been able to
transform misery into near poetry.
 Some of the pieces in "Angela's Ashes" will leave you depressed, some
may sicken and sadden. But - in the end - it will inspire.

ANGELA'S ASHES (director:Alan Parker; screenwriter: from the novel of
Frank McCourt/Laura Jones; cinematography: Michael Seresin; cast: Emily
Watson (Angela), Robert Carlyle (Dad), Joe Breen (Young Frank), Ciaran
Owens (Middle Frank) and Michael Legge (Older Frank), Shane Murray
Corcoran (Young Malachy), Ronnie Masterson (Grandma Sheehan), Eanna
MacLiam (Uncle Pat), Pauline McLynn (Aunt Aggie), Andrew Bennett
(Narrator), 1999)
"Angela's Ashes" follows the McCourt family from Brooklyn, where they
can't fit in, back to Limerick, Ireland. The impoverished Irish family
has gone in the reverse direction of most immigrants. They will also not
feel at home in their new location. Angela, played with some stoic
reserve by Emily Watson, comes from a family that has no use for her
husband Malachy (Robert Carlyle). He has an underwritten part as a
hopeless alcoholic, playing someone who can't get work but endears
himself to the family by telling them stories. He's from Northern
Ireland, thereby he is treated like a foreigner in Limerick. The trouble
with Carlyle's part (not his performance) was that it had no punch to
it, he couldn't make it an interesting role. The stories he told about
the English bringing fleas and the damp to Ireland, didn't evoke the
comedy or sympathy for him that it should have. He just came off as a
deadbeat, someone who cared more about himself than anything else.
The whole point of the film will be a long and trying study in misery
and poverty, as the family will undergo a series of hardships, including
the loss of three young children. The film never gets untracked from its
maudlin attitude. It suffers from the old problem of trying to portray
misery without having a film that can escape from being miserable
itself. The other problem is that the misery seemed unreal, everything
about it seemed so uninvolving and pristine. The film was flat. Its
characters seemed too sanitary for their circumstances, and the family's
plight never seemed to be more than what their outside environment was,
of rainy days, apartments with fading wallpaper, and cramped streets. It
was hard to care about what was happening to them, except the obvious
reaction one gets when seeing a poor household. Their endless plight
seemed no different from the beginning of the film to the end. I have no
idea what I was supposed to get from seeing them being deprived of
comfortable housing, not having enough food to eat, wearing torn
clothes, not having a dependable father, having a Christian brother slam
the church door in Frank's face, the father putting a beer mug on his
young son's coffin, a government and a church  indifferent to the
McCourt's poverty, and for the family not having proper indoor plumbing,
except to say that's too bad. It was the filmmakers job, the director
Alan Parker, along with the screenwriter, Laura Jones, to make me want
to care, but instead, they made me feel too distant to honestly feel
anything.
"Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish
childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood,"
writes Frank McCourt in his account of his miserable Irish Catholic
childhood in the 30s and 40s. And if misery per se were an  interesting
topic, this adaptation of Frank McCourt's book might be too. To make
matters even worse, this is an excrutiatingly long film, over
two-and-a-half-hour running time, and it seemed to go on forever. This
almost solemn film portrayal, with an Irish brogue voiceover throughout
its entirety, explaining every little piece of misery as if were a work
of sublime art, did not work for me.
Young Frank (played successively by Joe Breen, Ciaran Owens and Michael
Legge) is featured from his first confession (the best comic scenes to
come out of the film) to the first shilling he earns to support his
family to his first affair. The film has a bored look about it,
indicating nothing much is going to happen except for a string of gross
events and that Frank, as a survivor, will somehow come through all this
misery.
It almost seems to be a shame not to connect with the family's plight,
but as well-intentioned as this film was and as good as the Pulitzer
Prize winning autobiography was supposed to be (I didn't read it), it
was, nevertheless, made into a conventional film with nothing in it to
really rave about. Most life stories do not make for good dramatics in
films anyway, they seem better suited for the printed page. This one is
no exception.
