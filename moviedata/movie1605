 Director: Claire Denis
 Writer:   Claire Denis, Jean Pol Fargeau, inspired by Herman
Melville's "Billy Budd"
 Cast: Gregoire Colin, Denis Lavant, Michel Subor
   If you want to strip human beings to their essence, situate
your movie in the desert, an area with virtually no civilian
conveniences, and assemble your cast of characters in a
closed space from which they cannot escape.  You'll get your
emotions raw: you'll find out what people are made of.  The
friendly feelings will surface, especially during card games, at
the lone dance hall, and especially in the quiet moments
when you're sharing a restful activity with your compatriots
such as ironing your clothes.  But the demons are bound to
come out, the imps of envy and hatred the most likely
candidates for surfacing.
   This probably accounts for Claire Denis's situating her
tense, incredibly spare 90 minute piece in a remote outpost
of the French Foreign Legion in the little nation of Djibouti on
Africa's Red Sea.  The local inhabitants of the area, largely
Muslim women who show up weekly at the dance floor to
exhibit their supple bodies with gyrating rhythms at the social
hall accompanied by the French men who rotate and revolve
respectably in close proximity.  
   "Beau Travail" has little dialogue and is largely narrated
from the point of view of the leader of the small group of
legionnaires, Sgt. Galoup (Denis Lavant).  Galoup has the
men's affection and loyalty and commands discipline from
this vigorous group who are under the overall command of a
philosophic older man, Bruno Forestier (Michel Subor). 
Director Denis puts the fellows through their weekly paces,
seeing the routine lives of these men guarding their remote
outpost with such macho intensity that you're surprised to
discover that the helmer is a woman.  In one of the most
physical of films, these actors--not stunt men, mind you, but
performers--actually run under a series of barbed wire fences,
climb over hurdles, jump into pits and climb out in the blink of
an eye, do pushups in all varieties including medium-downs
and bouncing on their palms, and practice disarming
attackers with knives.  There's even a strange exercise that
has the men hugging one another and separating, hugging
and separating, and performing amphibian workouts with
guns in tow.  When their bodies are not in frantic motion, they
are ironing their pants, putting perfect creases in their
trousers to symbolize their elegance, and at least one pair of
fellows can play a mean game of chess.
   The conflict arises when Sgt. Lavant becomes increasingly
envious of one of the guys, Gilles Sentain, a tall, well-built,
handsome recruit who is admired by the men and who, in
one instance, becomes a hero when he rescues a flier from a
downed chopper.  Determined to make life miserable for him,
the sergeant contrives a plan that he hopes will lead to the
legionnaire's death.
   The movie is inspired by Herman Melville's "Billy Budd,"
which every junior high kid in America must have had to read
at one time.  "Billy Budd" was about a midshipman who was
a stabilizing influence on the rough crew of a merchant ship. 
When he is taken aboard the "Indomitable," he is popular with
all the officers and crew except John Claggart, the master-at-
arms, who is envious of Billy's almost perfect physique and
personality. But whereas Melville's story was about an
innocent youth trapped in the brutality of fleet regulations or,
perhaps, one who represents truth and beauty trapped by the
wickedness of the world, the crew in which Sentain finds
himself is a well-behaved troupe that needed no particular
stabilizing, making the viewer wonder exactly why the
sergeant hated him so much. Sentain is not overwhelmingly
worshipped by the men, who give their allegiance freely to
the sergeant, and therefore Galoup's behavior is tough to
accept.
   The story takes a back seat, however, to the poetry of the
filmmaking.  "Beau Travail" makes its points with minimal use
of dialogue, allowing the images to convey the Spartan nature
of life in such a remote region, a man's world, and nicely
juxtaposes the scenes of the local women exhibiting their
body moves with the more aggressive and testosterone-
enkindled mobility of the men.

In current day Marseilles, Galoup (Denis Lavant, "Lovers on the Bridge")
goes through the regimen of daily life while contemplating his recent
past as a Chief Master Sargeant of the French Foreign Legion ('From a 
certain point of view, I screwed up, and points of view are important.')
Cowritten (with Jean-Paul Fargeau) and directed by Claire Denis ("Chocolat"),
"Beau Travail" is based on Melville's "Billy Budd," but shifts the focus from
the innocent victim to his tormentor.
"Beau Travail" is a mood piece with limitted dialogue and a relatively
langorous pace.  However, if you can accept the irrational hatred of Galoup
for one of his soldiers, Sentain (Grigoire Colin, "The Dreamlife of Angels"),
and give yourself over to this film, you may find yourself experiencing 
cinematic splendor.
Galoup clearly loves his Legionnaire life, as well as the attention of his 
superior, Commander Bruno Forestier (Michel Subor).  The Commander is
content to use the Djibouti equivalent of marijuana even as he still keeps his
experienced gaze upon Galoup and his praiseworthy group of displaced young men, 
He's also wise enough to warn Galoup about his overreactions to Sentain, a 
young man liked by all.  All is well as Galoup guides his men through their 
daily training, followed by the inevitable laundry and outdoor ironing, 
rewarded by weekends spent at a disco, where the men dance around their
undulating local girlfriends. 
Then a helicopter crashes into the sea during a training exercise and 
Sentain emerges a hero, decorated by their Commander.  Galoup's jealousy
continues to build and he brings his men to camp in a desolate area,
ostensibly to perform road repairs.  Instead Galoup engineers his group's
dynamics until he has a valid complaint against Sentain.  Galoup chooses
to punish Sentain (who ironically was standing up for another soldier
Galoup was punishing too severely and inhumanely) by abandoning him in 
the desert with a compass he knows to be faulty - a death sentence in this
harsh environment.  Forestier is forced to court martial Galoup and we're
brought full circle to where the tale began.
Denis' film features striking imagery (cinematography by Agnes Godard,
film Editing by Nelly Quettier), juxtaposing waves in sand and in sea,
salt encrusted on land (and a found compass).  She glorifies the male 
body like a color film version of Leni Reifenstahl's "Olympiad" with 
bare-chested men crab-crawlinging under obstacles, wire-walking, thrusting
and parrying.  Her images have a gorgeous, crystal clarity which are
superbly set to the music of Benjamin Britten's Billy Budd opera and
original music by Charles Henri de Pierrefeu.
Of her cast, only three men really matter.  Colin is mostly an object of
desire, either stoicly performing his duties or letting a open smile overtake
his features when relaxing with his peers.  Although Lavant narrates the
story, Subor almost acts as the audience's point of view, even when he's not
present.  Bleery from local drugs yet cognizant of everything, he remains
distanced from the action.  In Lavant, Denis has found the lifeforce of her
film.  This actor demands your attention with his pockmarked face and
urgent body language.  Lavant gives a compelling performance, evoking 
audience sympathy even as he acts badly.  When the film ends, we believe
we're about to witness Galoup's suicide, then Denis cuts to him alone in
the disco, where the tightly wound coil of his body literally explodes
in dance as the lyrics "This is the rhythm of the night, this is the rhythm 
of my life" pound out over the dance floor, a powerful release from all
that's been witnessed.

Claire Denis (I Can't Sleep/Nenette and Boni/No Fear, No Die) has
created a cinematic work of great poetry and reverie: a masterpiece. It
is a meditation on men of the French Foreign Legion who live as
outsiders on the edge of civilization, who have been reborn with hope
when becoming part of a romantic military organization, thereby
attaining a certain elegance in their lives. The film is loosely based
on Herman Melville's "Billy Budd," though the scenery is now the
isolation of the African desert instead of the sea. There are many films
that influenced Denis, but the works of Alain Renais, especially his
Muriel, probably influenced her the most. It's a film so visually
stunning and so magnificently palpable in its cinematography and in its
lively camera movements and fascinating narrative speculations, and most
of all, in its lyrical sensuality, that it runs poetically adrift with
its listless hypnotic pace, its sparse dialogue forcing the viewer to
see what is not being said, and by its strange brooding mood it sets, as
it tells in a matter of fact tone a story of hate, alienation and envy
through the eyes of the narrow-minded French Foreign legionnaire who
found freedom in his remorse. Its background shots are just as important
as its story line and its theme, as it helps explore the everyday
boredom the men face, of the trite routines the macho men are under, and
the underlying violence it evokes in them.
Every scene in Beau Travail is filled with a quietness that turns
explosive and rattles the wasteland. The minimally told story is made
all the more powerful by many vivid shots, such as the one of the
emerald water contrasted with the barren desert, or of the distant
mountains which seem to have a language of their own that speaks to us
of things we cannot know, or of the unobtrusive native women in their
colorful dresses that we see in the marketplace or at the disco, who
strike a chord in us with their musical gestures and mocking tones. The
local women are just as much a part of the story as anything else in the
film is, even though they are not directly part of the plot. There are
also the close-ups of the interracial legionnaires living as brothers
who have to reinforce this by ritualistically hugging and separating
from each other in what seems to be weirdly homoerotic embraces, but can
also be viewed as a parody of such romantic notions.
All the legionnaires have secret past lives and can choose any name they
want to be known by (one of the main characters is Michel Subor who
chooses the same name he had in Godard's 1960 Le Petit Soldat, Bruno
Forestier, but this time he is playing a different part). The
legionnaires are willingly giving up everything to be accepted into this
arcane masculine fraternity that lives by a code of military honor.
Beau Travail literally means beautiful work, and this film delivers all
that and more. It seems like it has been ages since I have been so
enthused about a film as I am by this one.
The story is narrated by the evil superior sergeant, in an offscreen
voiceover and in a flashback that begins by him stating his time of
action is over, it is time for him to recall his life, as he
says--`Marseilles, late February. I have a lot of time ahead of me.'
He's a loner, a sort of romantic figure despite his unappealing physical
appearance, who thought of himself as the ideal legionnaire, ex-Chief
Master Sergeant Galoup (Denis Lavant), a career soldier in the French
Foreign Legion, stationed in the Djibouti outpost, which is in East
Africa.
His chosen life, one that he feels most suited for, changes for no
apparent reason when he becomes extremely jealous of an innocent new
recruit who comes under his command, Gilles Sentain (Gregoire Colin).
Galoup reminisces, with the help of the diary he kept, about being
booted out of the Legion for his abuse of the popular and compliant
recruit, someone with no guile who only wanted to be a good soldier.
Galoup is not afraid to openly state how he was driven by the twisted
state of his mind to behave in such a maddening way against such a
selfless and blank individual, someone he found hard to believe really
exists.
He tells of almost idolizing his much older commander, Bruno Forestier,
who has no ideals or ambition, and enjoys to sit around and get high
smoking the local gat. Bruno has grown old and tired of life, and in one
conversation he has with the sergeant, he says "If it wasn't for
fornication and blood we wouldn't be here."
Time seems irrelevant for the soldiers, memories seem to come and go, as
they do their military drills looking at times like Teutonic mythical
gods while half-naked (these scenes provoke, mock and remind us of the
Leni Riefenstahl kitsch art and homoerotic heroes she gave us in both
Triumph of the Will and Olympiad--though Denis's characterizations
seemed all the more potent, purposeful and vital). The men also exercise
by performing tai chi and they learn that the most important thing a
legionnaire must know, is to obey his superior officer. To iron a
perfect crease in their uniform is part of their reason for being in the
Legion, because it makes them look special. The boredom of the day is
broken up by work details, while the nights are reserved for the local
discos, where they dance Western style with the ribald African women and
pretend to have found satisfaction with this fantasy arrangement. Beau
Travail is the memories of such idol pleasures and such a need to fit in
somewhere, even if it is into something that appears as useless as the
Legion, which doesn't seem to have any purpose anymore without the days
of French colonization and the Algerian war. The only thing the men
can't let go of is their dreams. The Legion is their love fantasy, it is
something that can't be understood by anyone but true lovers. Trying to
explain their reason for being, is like explaining why Rimbaud became a
slave trader and gave up poetry.
Sentain heroically rescues a helicopter pilot who crashed at sea and
Forestier respects him for being the kind of soldier needed in the
Legion, one who blindly obeys orders and loves to be a soldier for no
other reason. That Bruno takes a liking to him, makes Galoup become
crazed with envy, as he can't believe that Sentain doesn't have an angle
he is working. The sergeant then finalizes his plans to destroy Sentain
by bringing the legionnaires to a desolate spot in the desert, where he
has them dig in the oppressive heat a road that is not needed, as the
locals watch impassively with disbelief. As in Billy Budd, the person in
charge, in this instance the sergeant, creates a situation out of an
injustice to another to provoke the legionnaire to respond and thereby
manuevers the innocent Sentain to act in a humanitarian way, and when he
does the sergeant is there to snap at him and sucker him into punching
him out as he thereby fulfills his plan by sending Sentain out on the
isolated desert alone with only a compass that doesn't work, as his
punishment. The last we see of Sentain, is that the locals have rescued
the unconscious man in the desert and a local woman is nursing him back
to health, as she is with him on a bus.
When told by the commander his days in the Legion are over, there is a
brilliant final scene of the sergeant's visit to the disco where he
breaks free of the self that imprisons him and dances wildly alone to
the contemporary Western song "Rhythm of the Night." Alone in
Marseilles, he wrestles with the motto he has tattooed on his chest
"Serve the good cause and die," and contemplates suicide.
Claire Denis was brought up in a family where her father was a French
civil servant and lived the early years of her life throughout Africa
and in Djibouti. Her familiarity with the people and their landscape and
their customs, is reflective in the truth captured on the screen. This
is her breakthrough genius film, a film that stands heads and shoulders
over the talented director's other films. There's magic in the mystery
her filmmaking evokes and there's something universal she uncovers in
her search for foreignness (goodness!), which is the reason she took
this project on in the first place, at the urging of French TV. What
adds to the film, is the robust musical score of Benjamin Britten's
Billy Budd oratorio and the choreography staged by one of the actors who
played a legionnaire, Bernardo Montet. All the military exercises were
like watching a ballet, as the entire film had the fresh look of
something so beautiful, that it has to be seen.

Galoup is not in uniform, but he is in funereal black. He's in a night club, 
but with only mirrors for company, which force his sour image at him like 
deliberate mockery. He dances fast, but seems dead, like his body's being 
shaken around. The song lyric playing ceaselessly: "The rhythm of the 
night... this is the rhythm of my life."
His is indeed a dark beat. Galoup is played by Denis Lavant -- he of those 
Stella Artois commercials that have played along with the coming attractions 
at every movie for the last two years -- in a performance of unmoving, 
bitter, canine expression that was probably not difficult to perform but is 
effective nonetheless. He is an empty man -- devastated because of his 
dishonourable discharge from the French Legionnaires, but also lacking in 
soul, and his problems were eating away at him even when he was a commanding 
officer.
Claire Denis's "Beau Travail" documents the process. The final scene, 
described above, feels tragic; the rest of the movie is quite boring. It 
takes place in some African country, where the Legionnaires train for area 
guarding in tortuous heat, and unspoken tensions drive men mad. Galoup seems 
to look at his colleagues and subordinates with a suspicious eye, becoming 
convinced they are mocking or trying to usurp him. Eventually he starts to 
victimise a Russian-born platoon member, setting him unreasonable punishments 
for non-existent offences, and then travelling to a deserted area and leaving 
him for dead.
This could have been a chilling character study of bitter poignancy, because 
the obvious uneventfulness of life in the camp (there is hardly any dialogue 
in the movie, and everyone moves in a slow, mechanical manner) makes Galoup's 
paranoia all the more sad. It feels unintentionally aimless, though, because 
there is a voice-over narration of grand musings that falsely suggests 
there's some higher meaning to it all. Why can't Denis let the story be a 
tragedy about one pathetic man? Why does she suggest that there's a Big 
Intellectual Message? If she's trying to make a general point about how a 
life of army solitude is bound to turn all soldiers insane, then she fails, 
because her depiction of camp life is Galoup's perception, not realism. 
Actual military personnel would not be robotically executing tasks or 
vacantly staring into space; they'd be digging into their duties in between 
joking with each other, playing cards and drinking. Does she know anyone in 
the army? On the basis of "Beau Travail" I doubt it.
The picture's most striking aspect is the homoerotic aura of its training 
scenes, with sweaty, half-naked, muscular men slowly and silently flexing and 
gyrating in the hot sun against a backdrop of dry sand. I wonder if a male 
director would get away with shooting a female cast like that. I'd also like 
to see that movie, if ever it gets made.

Ever hate somebody for being too well liked?  Too beautiful?  Too
respected?  Too perfect?  That's the basic gist of Beau Travail, Claire
Denis' strikingly beautiful film loosely based on Herman Melville's
`Billy Budd.'  I liken the film to fighting world featherweight champion
Prince Naseem ¬ñ you laugh off Travail's near lack of dialogue,
indistinguishable characters, puny running time and paper-thin plot, but
before you know it, you're lying on your back with little birds floating
around your head.
Denis Lavant (Lovers On the Bridge) plays a French Foreign Legion
Sergeant named Galoup.  His men, an interesting blend of black Africans
and white Europeans, inhabit a post in Djibouti on Africa's east coast.
Travail goes out of its way to documents the grueling physical tasks
that the soldiers must routinely participate in while baking under the
blistering hot sun.  Their chores and maneuvers seem incredibly
pointless, often drawing smirks from the villagers that watch in
amazement.
Short, ugly and scarred (think of a French version of Tommy Lee Jones),
Galoup is respected by his men, but he develops an irrational hatred
toward one particular soldier named Sentain (Gr√©goire Colin, The
Dreamlife of Angels).  Galoup can't stand Sentain's popularity with his
fellow soldiers and, especially, the Legion's commanding officer (Michel
Subor).  His sweeping jealousy begins to affect everything in his life,
turning Galoup into an entirely different person.
With Galoup's sparse narration, and the presence of soldiers and
beautiful poetic images, Travail reminded me of The Thin Red Line (and
it's about half that Oscar nominee).  What I found strange was Denis'
(N√©nette et Boni) need to let her camera linger on the soldier's
well-chiseled bodies.  The troops were almost always shirtless, and the
robotic manner at which they approached their tasks made parts of the
film seem like a commercial for The Gap.  This, along with Galoup's
inexplicable envy of Sentain, provided some very strong homoerotic
undertones to Travail.
If anything, Travail is worth a viewing just for its visuals.  The
pristine blue water of the Indian Ocean offsets the drab, rocky
surroundings of Djibouti.  Cinematographer Agnƒçs Godard (N√©nette) does a
fantastic job of capturing the beauty of this particular area of Africa,
as well as the dark brutality of man.
