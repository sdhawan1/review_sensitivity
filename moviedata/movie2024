'The Interview' is a frightening mystery tale about the way the police
conduct a criminal investigation as they try to find the truth. It
builds in intensity for the desperate man being questioned and the
desperate detectives asking the questions. They keep the viewer riveted
to the twists in plot as one's perceptions about the case are subject to
change, in this excellently conceived Australian psychological thriller.
What is the truth can only be surmised by the film's end, but enough is
revealed so that you think you know the answer.
Two detectives, Detective Sergeant John Steele (Tony Martin) and
Detective Senior Constable Wayne Prior (Aaron Jeffery), unnecessarily
break down a suspect's door, tear up his place, and use Gestapo tactics
to rouse him as a suspect in a car theft. The suspect is the nondescript
looking Eddie Rodney Fleming (Hugo Weaving), who has been hassled while
he is napping in his plain one-room apartment.
They interview him formally in the stationhouse while not telling him
what he is charged with and fail to read him his rights. Detective Prior
threatens him, intimidates him, and cusses him out; while the senior
detective who has a history of complaints againsts him, constantly
badgers the suspect in a chillingly calculated way and tries to pin a
series of murders on him. It turns out that the owner of the stolen car
is missing, and the detectives believe that their suspect is the reason
for that. They have very little to go on, as they hold him for 5 hours
of questioning without even feeding him. When the unemployed man on
welfare calls for a solicitor, she tells him not to say anything -- they
will have to either charge you or let you go in a reasonable time.
Because of the way the Australian legal system operates, she can't stay
with him while they are interviewing him. If she did, she could become a
potential witness for the prosecution on a subpoena. This leaves the
very edgy and very talkative suspect alone with the two detectives.
The hidden personal agenda by those in the police department, results in
the internal affairs bureau secretly videotaping the interview because
of Steele's previous use of ruthless but effective methods. They fear
because of his illegal methods of investigating, too many of his cases
are thrown out by the courts. When the detectives finally get the
suspect to confess, he can't shut up and gives them a number of serial
killings he said he did. They, at this time, treat him to a sumptuous
feast. But the bad news is the internal affairs investigators rule that
they can't accept the confession because it was given under duress, and
therefore the suspect is set free.
Though the film might not be startling or flamboyant it is competently
acted, especially by the two main antagonists, Hugo Weaving and Tony
Martin. It is chillingly photographed by Simon Duggan, giving it a
retro-noir film look. The first-rate script has us being sympathetic to
the suspect for being unfairly grilled, but that changes because of the
ethics investigators trying to railroad an instinctively good street
detective and making him their sacrificial lamb. Director Craig Monahan
has co-written the film with his police                    technical
adviser, Gordon Davie. He has created a Kafkaesque atmosphere of
paranoia that turns out to be right on the money. The question we are
left with, is whether a psycho serial killer has been set free because
of this bickering in the police department and the misuse of police
powers. A good lesson for the modern Western world to be facing up to,
as criminal investigation methods by the police are constantly under
scrutiny in democratic countries; or, at least, they should be.

Craig Monahan has come a long way from creating music videos and various
documentaries.  He began writing the script for The Interview over eight
years ago, which was finally furnished off with the help of a couple of
co-writers.  Much like Neil LaBute (responsible for the astounding In
the Company of Men), he has been able to ink more pen and film more
cohesively in his first feature than many directors and writers can
achieve in their careers.  Behind all the sticky multiple twists and
unwinding intrigue, his style of film making seems simple enough to me:
he doesn't really give a toss what we think of his characters or what
they do, just as long as we are manipulated enough into believing two
sides of a story, and that knowledge given to us isn't really given at
all.  It's forced; and once we enter the world of dark, repressive crime
life in Melbourne, there's no turning back.  And nor would we want to.
The two main protagonists are plausible and spiteful enough to ensure an
almost perfect amount of chemistry between the two leads. Tony Martin is
familiar with the tough guy role (with his characters in the long
running drama E-Street and Heartbreak High), playing Detective John
Steel, who interrogates the scared and confused Eddie Fleming (Hugo
Weaving).  Fleming seems innocent enough; and perhaps he his, but when
his apartment door is busted down by Steel and his even-tougher-guy
partner Wayne (Aaron Jeffery), he is placed in a darkened interrogation
room in the Melbourne CBD.  The charge: car theft.  Although Fleming is
at first reluctant to talk, when the subject changes from automobiles to
serial killings, he's all words.  And Steel realizes that his
predicament is far more complex than what he once suspected.
Monahan beckons us to ask the questions that he really loves not to
answer.  Is Fleming telling the truth?  Is he manipulating the situation
to his advantage?  Is he a conniving criminal genius, or an average
no-hoper on the dole?  Much to the film's advantage, he's probably a
little of everything, and reminded me of Kevin Spacey in The Usual
Suspects.  Both are unremarkable little men who end up showing their
sinister-but-maybe-not-sinister colours.
Monahan and his team of writers have pushed aside conventional narration
and replaced it with the art of reveal, where the characters are
diffused bit by bit until we can get a reasonable understanding of their
motives.  This is similar for our comprehension of the plot, which puts
our protagonists in entirely different positions. "I've been from Lord
Mayor to shit carter in less than two hours," Martin states when a
heated conversation eventuates.  And whilst on the subject of Martin -
he's a dynamic actor who gives an equally dynamic performance.  With a
subtle Australian flavor to his speech and a vital presence, Martin
burns into the back of our brains the perfect image of a good cop and
bad cop rolled into one.  Weaver is also good - very good - but some of
his dialogue seems a touch too simplistic at times.
It's a shame that Monahan has thrown away some valuable scenes with the
inclusion of Steel's predictable, uncivil macho man partner Wayne.  He
spoils the atmosphere on many occasions by looking, pure and simply,
stupid.  One scene, when Steel gives him firm advice regarding their
case, all effectiveness of this moment is lost when Wayne spits over the
side of a flight of stairs in his frivolous display of anger.
The Interview is perhaps a little over worked, with the production crew
doing everything possible to seduce us into the world of crime
investigation.  However, it is shot with incredible skill and precision
by Simon Duggan, who balances out the film's long pull-backs with
extreme close ups.  Oscar nominee David Hirschfelder (for Shine) also
adds much to the experience with his eerie and abstruse composition.
In the end, The Interview is an excellent gritty Australian flick, with
only a few flaws.  Although the film's climax is a little too passively
written, this is probably a good thing for Craig Monahan - this
explosive new director is already impressionably brilliant behind the
camera.  If he manages to achieve that same feat with his writing, Craig
might just become the new force in Australian cinema.

The film that took Australia by storm has finally found its way to
American soil.  The Interview swept through the 1998 Australian Film
Institute Awards, winning three major prizes (Best Film, Best Screenplay
and Best Actor) out of the nine nominations it received.  Not bad,
considering it was writer/director Craig Monahan's first film.
The Interview is set in present-day Melbourne, and its first scene is a
real attention-grabber.  41-year-old Eddie Fleming (Hugo Weaving) is
asleep in his apartment, which is littered with old newspapers.  At
around 5 AM, his door is knocked off its hinges by a group of
plainclothes detectives, some of whom beat and handcuff Fleming as the
others begin to trash his pad in search of clues.  Fleming has no idea
why the cops are there, and before he can get his bearings, his pants
are full of piss and he's been dragged off to headquarters for
questioning.
At the police station, the investigation is taken over by Detective
Sergeant John Steele (Tony Martin) and Detective Senior Constable Wayne
Prior (Aaron Jeffrey), who proceed to interrogate Fleming with a `good
cop/bad cop' style of double-team attack.  The problem is that Fleming
still has no idea why he's there, but this doesn't keep Steele and Prior
from thinking they've got the right guy.
Most of The Interview takes place in the claustrophobic interrogation
room, where we slowly learn what crimes the police believe Fleming has
committed.  At first, Steele and Prior give the impression their subject
is suspected of car theft, but thanks to the numerous breaks taken
during their interrogation, we learn that the stolen car is just the tip
of the iceberg.  Fleming is actually the prime suspect in the
disappearance of six people the police believe have been murdered.
Suddenly, in the middle of the interrogation, Fleming throws the
detectives for a loop when he confesses to the murders, describing in
detail how he killed his victims and what he did with their bodies.
Steele and Prior lick their lips in anticipation of closing a
high-profile case, but their superiors aren't sure if Fleming is telling
the truth, or just leading the detectives on a wild-goose chase.
Weaving, who is probably best known in the States as the guy who chased
Keanu in The Matrix, is fantastic (and nearly unrecognizable with
medium-length blond hair), acting more with his eyebrows than most
mainstream stars can pull off with their entire bodies.  Martin also
does a decent job, but Jeffrey adds little to the film except
knuckle-dragging muscle.
The Interview could be a kissing cousin to The Usual Suspects, but
Monahan actually began writing his script in the early 90s, so all
similarities are coincidental.  It's a good film, but, unfortunately, it
still feels like a Suspects rip-off.  But that's still better than
harvesting the carcass of a 70s television show or Saturday Night Live
skit.  Imagine Kafka taking on an episode of Homicide or NYPD Blue, and
you've got a pretty good idea of the kind of film The Interview is.
Terrific cinematography from Simon Duggan (the upcoming Risk) and score
from double Oscar nominee David Hirschfelder (Shine, Elizabeth).
