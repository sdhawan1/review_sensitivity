Written by: Tsui Hark, Koan Hui On, Teddy Chan Tak-Sum, Joe Ma Wai-Ho
Starring: Jet Li Lian-Jie, Lau Ching-Wan, Karen Morris (Mok Man-Wai),
Francoise Yip Fong-Wah,
Ingredients: sci fi darkness, remorseless cyborg-type bad guys,
explosions and flying bullets, Terminator like sequence in a hospital,
heartache for a lost love, and a masked guy who wears a costume like
Kato of the Green Hornet with kung fu to match.
In the opening sequence beleaguered members of Commando Squad 701
narrowly escape annihilation by government troups. A narrator explains
that the members of 701 had undergone brain surgery to make them
impervious to pain and emotionally distant. Having lost their humanity,
the robotic superhumans were trained to be the best assassins in the
world but eventually couldn't be controlled, so the government ordered
them eradicated. Survivors escaped and separated to hide among normal
humans. ( An earlier movie depicting the aforementioned supersoldiers
was Universal Soldier [ 1992 ],' starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and
Dolph Lundgren ). 
A couple years later refugee Black Mask ( Jet Li ), superhuman young
former coach of the 701 team, has assumed a lowly new identity in Hong
Kong as gentle librarian Tsui Chik. His only good friend is another
loner: his chess partner, the hardened straight arrow Police Inspector
Shek ( Lau Ching-Wan ).
When Hong Kong's drug czars are systematically attacked and killed,
Inspector Shek takes the case. Unbeknownst to Shek, the remaining
superhumans of Squad 701 - - including a beautiful former lover of Black
Mask's ( Francoise Yip ) -- have banded together under psycho Commander
Shung to become a criminal gang seeking to take over the Asian drug
trade.
Tsui Chik becomes Black Mask again to protect Shek, and soon the police
and Black Mask find themselves battling attacks by the superhumans.
Smaller battles lead to a final conflict at the criminals' stronghold. 
Some comic relief breaks up the action in the antics of Karen Morris
(Mok Man-Wai) as a lovestruck pampered love interest from the library
who chases both Tsui Chik and Black Mask, not knowing they're the same
man.
Stars:
Beijing born Jet Li was a member of China's national wushu demonstration
team in his early teens and was invited to perform for President Richard
Nixon ( Nixon shocked the world by opening US relations with communist
China ).  Wushu, means martial arts' but since 1958,  it has come to
mean a national ( non-combative ) performance art that combines old
fight forms with gymnastics, Peking Opera, acrobatics, choreography,
dramatic interpretation and sometimes even music.  In movies, the style
involves fast thrusts, grabs, counterthrusts, and acrobatic leaps to
avoid being thrown.  
A prodigy, Li won the Chinese national wushu championships five years in
a row. After a few unnoticed minor film roles, Li hit it big in the
Asian scene with the movie Once Upon a Time in China ( 1991 ),'
directed and produced by Tsui Hark (  the director of Double Team, with
Van Damme and Dennis Rodman  ). Among his fans' favorite movies are
Fist of Legend  ( 1994 )' a remake of a Bruce Lee classic. 
In Black Mask actor Jet Li is reunited with 'Once Upon a Time in China'
director Tsui Hark and Fist of Legend' fight choreographer Yuen
Woo-Ping.
Jackie Chan fans may recognize Black Mask's lost former lover Yueh-lan
from Squad 701 as actress Francoise Yip, who played Jackie Chan's love
interest Nancy, the motorcycle girl from Rumble in the Bronx ( 1995 ).' 
Opinion:
Like The Terminator,' this is a neat action movie that goes for mood,
action, and style more than anything. It feels like an artsy sci fi
piece -- a comic book turned real --  with its mod music and dark
costumes, architectural structures, and action camera angles. The fight
scenes are a mixture of fast hand to hand combat with shootings,
explosions, darkness and flying glass all around -- and are
well-choreographed by veteran action director Yuen Woo-Ping.
Dramatically Jet Li gets solid acting support from Lau Ching Wan, doing
his best to flesh out the character of Tsui Chik's gruff cop buddy Shek. 
The exciting final confrontation between Commander Shung and Black Mask
involves using electrical cables as flailing weapons. The character of
Commander Shung isn't explored much, so in my opinion, the most
climactic scene isn't the final confrontation but rather when Black Mask
reluctantly battles his former lover Yueh-lan, the super soldier woman
of his flashbacks.

After stealing the show from Mel Gibson and company in _Lethal_Weapon 4_,
it was only a matter of time before American distributors started invading
the vault of Jet Li's Hong Kong work.  The first of what is sure to be a
long line of wide American releases is _Black_Mask_, a gritty, hyperstylish
1996 adventure that plugs Li's talents into a superhero yarn.  However, as
fun and exciting as the film often is, it is far from Li's best showcase.
That distinction belongs to _Fist_of_Legend_, an electrifying 1994
reworking of the Bruce Lee vehicle _The_Chinese_Connection_ whose American
distribution (through Quentin Tarantino's Rolling Thunder Pictures) was
scrapped.  However, it is easy to see why _Black_Mask_ ended up as his
first HK effort to widely reach U.S. screens.  It isn't so much that the
film is a diverting entertainment (which it certainly is), but that it is
one of Li's few actioners set in contemporary times.  Most of his
high-flying films, from _Fist_of Legend_ to his starmaking
_Once_Upon_a_Time_in_China_ series, were set in period China--not exactly
inaccessible to Yank audiences considering the amount of action in these
films, but a difficult sell nonetheless.
_Black_Mask_ is much more easily marketable: a dark, extremely violent
comic-book-style adventure where Li plays Tsui, a medically-enhanced
supersoldier who escapes the shady outfit that created him.  He attempts to
live a quiet existence as a pacificist librarian, but soon he jolted back
to action when his former cohorts have taken to killing off all of Hong
Kong's drug lords.  His identity kept a secret under a black mask (hence
the title), Tsui, with the reluctant help of aptly named policeman Rock
(Lau Ching Wan), attempts to set things right.
_Black_Mask_ has much more of a technical sheen than any of Jackie Chan's
fun yet rather crudely produced HK imports.  The English dubbing job is
actually competently done (Li doesn't do his own dialogue, but his stand-in
does an adequate job).  There is some inventive production and costume
design, as well as some often stunning cinematography.  Director Daniel
Lee's strong suit is definitely his visual style, which appears to be
influenced by the frenetic camera techniques of Michael Bay.
While the glossy approach keeps the film never less than visually
stimulating, it also shortchanges the many fight sequences, which, of
course, are what people see Jet Li films for.  Granted, no amount of
MTV-style editing can rob Li's acrobatic martial arts skills of their
electrifying effect, but the quick cuts do dilute it a bit.  One is left in
greater awe when one is actually able to see what Li can and does
do--without any flashy frills.
But until _Fist_of_Legend_ or any of his better showcases--such as
_Once_Upon_a_Time_in_China_, _Fong_Sai-Yuk_, or _The_Tai-Chi_Master_, the
latter which co-stars _Tomorrow_Never_Dies_ scene stealer Michelle Yeoh--is
made available to the masses (those films are all available, though on a
fairly limited basis, on video), _Black_Mask_ nicely gets the job done as
either a showcase for Jet Li's athletic talents or an undemanding blast of
action and mayhem.

Jet Li (of "Lethal Weapon 4" infamy) is the blacksheep of the 701 squad --
an elite military force of medically enhanced super-humans. Seems a few
701's got out of hand so the Hong Kong government decided to nicks the
program ... i.e. terminate these tough guys (and gal). At the film's
opening, Jet escapes alone (or so he thinks). For reasons not revealed to
us, this 701 who can feel no physical or emotional pain becomes a pacifist
and takes a job as a library page.
detective. And you know what happens when superhero's have cops for buddies
... they have a hard time staying pacifistic.
Okay, so the story isn't the strongest -- but did you really think it would
be? Did you care? It's Jet Li looking like Kato and kicking butt! If that's
what you expect, that's what you'll get.
"Black Mask" is a 1996 Hong Kong martial arts flick (rather typical of that
genre as well). It's been dubbed over in English to add that cheesy
late-night TV dimension to it. The squirty blood won't scare anyone
either -- save for the potential dangers of Red Dye #2. But, it's paced
well, Jet kicks a lot of bootie, it has romance, betrayal and a sense of
humor. I had fun and enjoyed (in particular) the relationship between Jet
and the cop; both played their parts respectably well, whether during a
mid-air drop kick or a friendly game of chess.
Starring Jet, Li Karen Mok, Lau Ching Wan, Francoise Yip.
Directed by Daniel Lee.
Screenplay by Tsui Hark, Teddy Chen, Joe Ma.
Produced by Tsui Hark and Released by Artisan Entertainment.
Rated R.

Black Mask can be described with one word: Gratuitous.  The Black Mask is
gratuitous in its use of blood, gratuitous its use of violence, and
gratuitous in its use of the camera.  What isn't gratuitous in the film is
its level of adrenaline.
After a good US introduction with Lethal Weapon 4, it was only a matter of
time before the studio heads in Hollywood started to try to cash in on Jet
Li's previous films.  Jet Li is fast, really fast.  Watching his martial
arts onscreen is a joy because it's not just a matter of enjoying it, but
of trying to keep up with his hands and feet.  Pair Li up with one of the
best martial arts choreographers around, Woo-Ping Yuen (who did the
choreographing for The Matrix), and you should have a hell of a film, right?
Wrong, nothing can save this film from the horrible editing and directing.
And although not many Hong Kong films have a good story, most of them at
least have good characters  not Black Mask.  Put together the bad editing,
directing, and the lack of a good character and the whole movie is nothing
more than repetitive scenes of people beating each other to a bloody pulp.
After the first few action scenes of this it just got boring.  The
repetitiveness of the action was a real downer.  By the end of the film
during the final show down, when the hero goes up against the evil boss, I
was left to look at my watch and wonder when the hero was finally going to
beat the living daylights out of the evil boss and get the movie over with.
Obviously, there was a lot of money put into this film when it was made in
1996.  The production design is tremendously polished, the sets are well
done, the costumes are generally well done, and the level of explosions is
high.  None of this saves the film either.  Maybe there was a lot that was
lost during the transition from being a Hong Kong film to being an English
film -- sometimes horrible cuts are made to films when they make this
transition -- but, I'm not sure if this is true with Black Mask or not.
The one thing that I liked about the film was the creative casting of the
voice talent.  Yes, the lines and the voice acting quality of the dubbing
were terrible, but the actors that the casting director selected were
hilarious.  I'm not sure if it was intentional or not, but the choices were
great.
One has to be a huge Jet Li fan to actually pay to see this film.  I'm
still annoyed that I paid, even at matinee, to see this piece of bad
filmmaking.  A flat, monotonous, and uninteresting film that is all looks
but lacks punch, Black Mask earns the dubious award of being a Skip, Skip,
Skip film.  Skip this film at matinee, Skip this film on video, and
definitely Skip this film if it's being shown at full price.

In Daniel Lee's BLACK MASK, famed Hong Kong martial arts star Jet Li
turns pacifist.
Li's days as a mild mannered librarian named Tsui are numbered.  As soon
as the story's main plot kicks into gear, Li becomes the superhuman
superhero known as Black Mask.  (The plot involves the canonical warring
drug lords, but it is of no consequence.  The story is only a
distraction.  The movie's whole purpose is to revel in obscenely violent
action sequences.)
This movie could be dedicated to those adults who secretly crave
hideously violent video games but wouldn't be caught dead playing one.
With a popcorn box for a joystick they can control the action,
slaughtering one outrageous villain after another.
How many different ways can one human destroy and maim another?  Let us
count the ways.
There's the bomb in a living man's chest so that the bomb squad has to
perform open chest surgery.  Oops, cut the artery, er wire.  Ka'boom!
There's the garden-style sprinkler with enough acid to wipe out an
entire gang with a single swirl.  And there's the 6-year-old girl's legs
mailed to her father in a wooden box.  I'm getting nauseated.  Let's
stop this disgusting enumeration.
The movie works sporadically only as a parody of its own genre.  Even as
a gorefest, it manages to drag frequently.  Perhaps the repetition just
wears out your senses.
To its credit the stunts are impressive.  Too impressive some will
argue.  But, for those of you who thought PULP FICTION was too tame,
this is the picture for you.
BLACK MASK runs 1:30.  The new release in the theaters is done with a
surprisingly credible English dubbing.  The 1996 video has English
subtitles and doesn't have the new soundtrack.  The film contains
massive, strong violence, profanity and sadomasochism.  It is
inappropriately rated R since it is clearly an NC-17 film and should be
treated as such by parents.  (The MPAA remains incredibly liberal about
violence but is very squeamish about nudity.  Which do you think is more
dangerous to today's teens?)  If you're worried about your kids seeing
violent images, this is the quintessential film for them to avoid.

Originally released in 1996, this film was obviously re-released to take
advantage of Jet Li's newfound American fame, after his attention-grabbing
performance in last summer's fourth installment of the LETHAL WEAPON series.
PLOT:
After the government's project 701 to transform certain people into
super-human fighting machines goes awry, one of the 701's has to protect the
rest of the city from the remaining super-warriors, who are all programmed
to fight like nobody's business, withstand bullets, fire and much, much
pain.
CRITIQUE:
How do you rate a movie that has some of the worst dialogue that you've
heard in a film in years, a plot that can only be described as a static
framework in which to insert many action sequences, and some of the best
fighting scenes this side of the crazy kung-fu battles from THE MATRIX
(7.5/10)? (No coincidence either, since Yuen Woo-Ping, is the same man who
choreographed the fighting stunts from both films.) Well, I guess I would
really recommend this movie to all those people who love to see eye-popping
fight sequences, since these are some of the coolest that I've seen in a
while. Most of them are set in fast-motion and incorporate all the creative
wizardry of a Jackie Chan fight, alongside the slickness of newcomer Jet Li,
and a frenetic shooting style via the eye of Daniel Lee. Now, if you like a
lot of action, but also prefer a good story with interesting characters,
that you'll be out of luck with this piece of film.
Also, prepare yourself to appreciate the dubbed voices of obvious phonies,
and the contrived hip-hop/rap soundtrack, which is somehow supposed to make
us feel more comfortable within this Hong-Kong film? I would've preferred a
less intrusive soundtrack myself. I think the wonderfully choreographed
battle sequences alone would entice folks to keep their goggles glued to the
screen. I know mine were whenever an action-packed scene popped up, while
everything else of mine quickly slinkied away whenever the cheesy plot,
melodramatic touches and awful dialogue returned to the proceedings. Check
it out if ONLY for the fight scenes, because they are truly a sight to
behold, but skip it altogether if cool combat scenarios within a crappy plot
and over-the-top enemies don't warm your salsa.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Beijing born Jet Li was a member of China's national Wushu demonstration
team in his early teens and was invited to perform for President Richard
Nixon. He was a Wushu world champion several times, stands 5'6", and was
born on April 26th, 1963.
Jackie Chan fans may recognize this film's lost former lover Yueh-lan as
actress Francoise Yip, who played Jackie Chan's love interest Nancy, the
motorcycle girl from RUMBLE IN THE BRONX.
This film's Hong Kong title is Hak Hap, and it was nominated for Best Action
Choreography, Best Art Direction and Best Costume & Make-Up Design, in the
1997 Hong Kong Film Awards.
