Another driver, a very different kind of taxi.  The latest collaboration of
screenwriter Paul Schrader and director Martin Scorsese inevitably brings to
mind  their first, 1976's "Taxi Driver."  Like cabby Travis Bickle, paramedic
Frank Pierce (Nicolas Cage) cruises New York City on the graveyard shift and
has a front-row seat for all the misery and depravity those mean streets can
offer.  Like Travis, Frank is drawn to a woman he wants to save, and both men
also seek to redeem themselves - Travis through violence, Frank through
healing.
Frank suffers from burnout.  He hasn't saved anyone in months, and the ghost of
a homeless girl (Cynthia Roman) who died because of his mistakes pursues Frank
with accusations.  He has become convinced that his purpose is not to save
lives but to serve as a "grief mop."  Some of the grief he mops early in the
movie belongs to Mary Burke (Patricia Arquette) whose estranged father has
suffered a heart attack.  After Frank restarts Mr. Burke's heart, the old man
is transferred to the hospital, where Mary will be found holding vigil when
Frank returns again and again with other patients.  In Mary, a recovering drug
addict, Frank finds a fellow lost soul.
Frank is partnered with a variety of paramedics whose reactions to the carnage
differ from his:  Larry (John Goodman) seems unconcerned and dreams of starting
his own ambulance service, Marcus (Ving Rhames) puts his faith in Jesus and
calls on Frank to do likewise, and Tom (Tom Sizemore) is a violent bigot who
thrives on blood and pain.  Wandering through it all as pale and dazed as the
living dead, Frank explores various routes in search of his own peace,
including drugs from Mary's dealer (Cliff Curtis) and a destructive rampage
with a baseball bat.  Every night Frank begs his boss to fire him, yet he will
not quit.  His eventual redemption is heavily ironic and raises more questions
than it resolves.
Of the many resurrections of the 1970s in recent years, "Bringing Out the Dead"
is the most welcome.  When Scorsese closed that decade with "Raging Bull" (also
from a Schrader screenplay), he seemed to exhaust the style and themes that had
produced not only "Taxi Driver" but also "Mean Streets" and "Alice Doesn't Live
Here Anymore."  Since then he's successfully explored a wide range of genres
including offbeat comedy ("The King of Comedy" and "After Hours"), gangsters
("GoodFellas" and "Casino"), and period pieces ("The Age of Innocence" and
"Kundun").  Now Scorsese returns to familiar turf with the varied skills of a
seasoned director.  With dizzying cinematography and editing, the filmmakers
successfully depict Frank's interior world.
Frank Pierce is Cage's most challenging role since "Leaving Las Vegas," and he
proves again that he is a substantial actor. "Bringing Out the Dead" is also
the first film real-life spouses Cage and Arquette have made together.  Their
romantic scenes seem touchingly genuine.  The entire cast gives strong
performances from start to finish.  It's especially nice that Rhames is getting
to demonstrate his acting range; too many of his most prominent roles have been
criminals and thugs.
Bottom Line:  Scorsese and Schrader are an unbeatable combination.

Cinematic storytelling often gravitates towards people in professions
that are inherently dramatic and stressful. That is why there are more
movies about police than about engineers. (Although in real life,
police work likely contains longer periods of tedious banality than
how it is portrayed on screen.) This film is about a profession that
is directly connected to disaster without being directly
involved--paramedics.
By definition, the job of a paramedic is frenetic and stressful. They
are always handling life and death situations in the aftermath of
disaster or tragedy. Any mistakes made can result in death, and
lingering guilt.
Frank Pierce (Nicolas Cage) is a veteran New York paramedic on the
verge of burnout. He is lacking an important quality required in his
profession-- detachment. Frank gets too involved with the people he
treats, and pays the price. The story begins with Frank coming to the
aid of an older man, Mr. Burke (Cullen O. Johnson), who suffered a
heart attack. Frank is able to revive him and take him to the
overburdened local hospital, but the man lingers in a suspended state
between life and death. The sympathetic Frank develops a relationship
with the man's daughter, Mary Burke (Patricia Arquette), who
frequently visits him.
Like the drugs that infest the neighborhood, Frank's job is the source
of his highs and his misery. He wants to quit, but never manages to do
so. The lingering state of suspended animation in which Mr. Burke
hovers symbolically represents Frank's state of mind. Although Frank
is effective at his job, he has become too involved and feels that his
best option may be to euthanize his career.
Veteran director Martin Scorcese presents dazzling visual images of
the surreal netherworld of the afterhours in New York City. The high
speed views of the ambulance coursing through the congested streets of
the city are mesmerizing. However, in terms of structuring the story,
the film is not as successful. The subplot of Noel (Marc Anthony), a
confused and unstable young man, is muddled and almost superfluous.
The character of Frank is well developed and well acted, but outside
him and his colorful partners, the other characters are not
compelling.
Recommended. The film is well directed, but unfocused. It dwells upon
its basic themes, and reiterates its ideas.

        I think it's safe to say that Martin Scorsese is mostly known
for his crime dramas although that niche is probably outnumbered by his
other works, including Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The Last Temptation of
Christ, and Kundun. Although, he's been so associated with that type of
film, it's never seemed to stop him from making different types of
films, and this is no exception.
        Although it's a bit uneven, it's extremely pleasing to see
Scorsese take such risks in filmmaking. He really does a lot of daring
things in the film, all the more impressive seeing as how is arguably
the most respected filmmaker working today and that he really need not
take such risks. No, that doesn't sound right. Perhaps that is why he
must be so daring. Or, conversely (and this makes much more sense simply
because it's entirely obvious), he is probably the most respected
filmmaker working today because he does take such risks.
        This film is in the same strain as Taxi Driver, sharing many
thematic elements. In fact, I'd venture to say that the parallels are so
close, it's nearly surprising it doesn't seem like a rehash. Maybe it's
the freshness of the filmmaking, or maybe it's the nearly quarter
century gap between that separates them just enough to really see them
as familiar, yet dissimilar works.
        Scorsese has a knack for picking interesting material and that's
why his direction usually seems even more at ease than it really is.
Here, the source material is a novel about a paramedic, Frank Pierce,
who can no longer deal with what he witnesses on the streets without it
affecting him to the point where he feels entirely responsible and
begins to go insane. The screenplay, by long-time Scorsese associate,
Paul Schrader, maintains a nice balance between objectively observing
Pierce (played by Nicolas Cage) descend into his madness and allowing
the audience to see the situation from a point more subjectively aligned
with Pierce.
        This point is infinitely helped by the strong performance of
Cage, and, to a lesser extent, by his supporting cast. Cage is very
expressive with minimal effort here. He is often very quiet and often
very worked up, but he is always intense and, at least, somewhat
seemingly disturbed. Not once did I think he played over the top (not
something I've been able to say of most of his performances of late) and
not once did I really think he underplayed a thing. The supporting cast
was not quite as strong, but they were close and perhaps the only reason
they weren't just a bit more effective is because they were never really
allowed to express as much. They simply weren't put to the same use as
Cage, and this is a choice that had to be made. Whether it's the best
choice remains to be seen, but it doesn't seem to really harm the film.
John Goodman, Ving Rhames, and Tom Sizemore were all great
characterizations, but they never really became much more than that--
never really characters, that is. The only other real character is Mary
Burke (Patricia Arquette). She could be seen as this film's Iris (Jodie
foster in Taxi Driver), not really a love interest, but more of a rescue
victim (she never really asks for it, but the hero feels the undeniable
urge to help, even against her wishes). While her performance, at first,
seems a bit on the dull side, her importance escalates as the film
moves and she seems to gain from this.
        This is a good solid film, but it is a bit hard to really get
into. I found myself feeling as if I was outside of it for a rather long
time, but once I finally got myself into it (and I'm not even sure how
or when this occurred), it was quite enthralling. Even while I was
feeling outside, it was still quite impressive, even if distanced. I
have a feeling, however, that this will be a film I will be more apt to
enjoy as I see it on other occasions.

Robert Richardson's familiar light filled cinematography showers scenes of
close up intimacy the way they have in many other films but it is
particularly startling in the case of 'Bringing Out the Dead'.  Set in the
early 90's in New York City, Nicolas Cage stars as a paramedic named Frank
Pierce, a man haunted by the people he couldn't save and has a re-occurring
vision of one particular young woman whom he sees while driving in his
ambulance every time he looks at some of the city's derelicts.  Richardson's
photography echoes the notion of spirituality as those who believe in the
spiritual nature of mankind will connect with the striking camera effects
that give way to believing the soul leaves the body at the moment of death.
Cage's performance as the paramedic is brilliant.  Sort of an up tempo
variation on his performance in 'Leaving Las Vegas'.  In that film from 1995
for which Cage won the Best Actor Oscar, he played an alcoholic L.A. writer
who was determined to move to Las Vegas and drink himself to death within 30
days.  In 'Bringing Out the Dead', Cage looks like he did in the above
mentioned film.  Pale, stressed out with bad hair, bags under his eyes and
an overall structure of a man not in good physical health.  Only this time
the characterization that Cage has brought to the screen is frenzied rather
than sedated.  His colleagues in the paramedic business who travel with him
from time to time are Larry (John Goodman), Marcus (Ving Rhames) and Tom
(Tom Sizemore).  All are men of different personalities.  Larry is the
straight shooter, Marcus envisions himself as sort of an evangelical saviour
of those requiring his services and Tom is the foul and nasty individual who
hates his job and acts like a jerk every step of the way.
Director Martin Scorsese has made a relentless and lacerating film and this
film is vintage Scorsese.  It reaps with scenes of hollow urban destitution
like 'Mean Streets', and 'Taxi Driver'.  When Scorsese is on target with his
visuals, he photographs and cuts his films with mesmerizing accuracy.
Scorsese keeps 'Bringing Out the Dead' from being just another NYC story of
grit and keeps a re-occurring theme elevated for the film's entire running
time.  Frank Pierce (Cage) is seen at the beginning of the film responding
to a call where an elderly man has had a heart attack.  Frank befriends his
daughter (Patricia Arquette) and keeps checking on her father's progress
throughout the course of the film.
The film is also like a big screen version of television's 'ER'.  The
emergency room at the hospital has all the characters you would expect to
find in a big city hospital.  There is the stern security guard wearing
sunglasses who is determined to keep order, the head nurse who questions
people as to why the hospital should help people like drug addicts when they
brought these problems on themselves, the head physician who complains that
there is a constant need for space and the repeat patient who is strapped to
a table on wheels in the hallway, going out of his mind because he can't get
his drug fix.
'Bringing Out the Dead' is anything but conventional film making.  Believe
it or not, from all of the problems its characters face as true examples of
human beings, the film has a surprising sense of humour.  Writer Paul
Schrader, whom I have always disliked in most cases and who made the most
depressing film I've ever seen as both writer and director of 1998's
'Affliction', does an excellent job as author of the 'Bringing Out the Dead'
screenplay.  He constructs the film in a manner that grabs your attention
right away from the opening scene and never lets up.  However, a lot of the
credit for this belongs to Joe Connelly, who wrote the novel on which this
film is based.  The only thing that prevents this movie from being a five
star accomplishment is that it is not an entirely new version of events from
either Scorsese, Cage of Schrader.  As good as the film is, it is the
definition of re-invention.  You can see that all involved are doing a
variation on past work and consequently, it just misses being a great film
but is excellent film making but won't bring Scorsese the long awaited Oscar
he deserves and may some day win.

Bringing Out the Dead: night and the city
In movies about surveillance--say, End of Violence, Enemy of the
State--the question quickly becomes Who watches the watchers.
Similarly, with crooked cop shows (Bad Lieutenant, among others), the
question takes the form of Who enforces the law for the enforcers. It makes
sense then that Martin Scorsese's Bringing Out the Dead, a movie about
paramedics, would have as its central question Who saves the 'savers.' But
if it were that simple, it wouldn't be much of a movie, so Scorsese
problematizes it, makes these paramedics hardly worth saving.
These are guys who cruise the streets looking for people to beat up, guys
who, through drinking and driving and a whole host of other infractions,
routinely endanger the safety of the people they're supposed to care about.
All of which is probably supposed to supply us with the generic definition
of a complex character(s): one who both doesn't value human life and fights
tooth and nail for that human life.
Of these 'complex' characters (John Goodman, Ving Rhames, Tom Sizemore),
Frank Pierce (Nicolas Cage) emerges as the most significant, the one most in
need of saving. This simply because he's a junky, addicted to the rush of
saving lives. And it's been so long since he's saved anyone. And, in
addition, he's haunted by the (projected) presence of Rose, a young girl who
died on him, whom he feels especially guilty for not saving. Of course, too,
he tries to ignore her through gin and intravenous cocktails and getting
lost in the job, but nothing works; she remains. And it's slowly pushing him
over the edge. And everyone's dying on him. And he's got an interior
monologue going on just in case we don't pick up on all this.
Enter Mary Burke (Patricia Arquette), someone who, unlike Pierce
and the rest of the paramedics, still has some kindness in her. Brings
people water when they need water. All of which suggests maybe she can save
him. He did resuscitate her cardiac-arrested father with some well-placed
Sinatra music, after all, so she does 'owe' him. Too, though, her father
might have been better off dead, might in fact have wanted to be dead, and
Pierce knows this, and as a result they (Pierce and Burke) just bounce off
each other at odd times through the movie, as if their scenes are really
only there to allow our eyes a rest from all the city
lights constantly streaking by (see: overkill).
Does Pierce get 'saved,' though? It's hard to tell. Or, rather, it's
hard to care, as Bringing out the Dead, while ostensibly 'about' him, is
really more about the paramedic existence as focused through him. All the
whacked-out people, the blood, someone always screaming 'stat' in the
background. With the right editing, Bringing Out the Dead could have even
made a good mock-documentary on HBO. Too, it could have been developed more
in the direction it already leans towards--the vampire genre: all these guys
feeding off the dead and dying, the daylight lasting
about fifteen seconds, all that fun stuff. As it is, though, it's just a
visual ride that goes nowhere. And the bad thing is, look away for five
seconds and it's over. The good thing is you don't really miss it. Or, don't
feel you missed out on anything.

_Bringing_Out_the_Dead_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
There's an interesting movie about a paramedic struggling to come to
grips with a past trauma through a flurry of destructive chemical
indulgences, but Martin Scorsese's _Bringing_Out_the_Dead_ is not the one
I have in mind: it's Scott Ziehl's _Broken_Vessels_, a similarly-themed
low-budget indie that received a very limited theatrical run earlier this
year.  This is not to say that Scorsese's slicker studio effort does not
feature its share of virtues--in fact, there are many--but, to use a
tired cliché, its whole amounts to less than the sum of its often
exceptional parts.
One such part is Nicolas Cage, who plays graveyard shift New York City
paramedic Frank Pierce.   Having already played a drunk to Oscar-winning
effect in _Leaving_Las_Vegas_, Cage breaks no new acting ground as Frank
gradually falls deeper into booze and other substances to shake off his
malaise with the nightly work grind and ease pain over the loss of so
many patients, namely that of a young girl named Rose (Cynthia Roman),
for whose passing he feels especially responsible.  But it's a role he
plays well, and he lends a great deal of sympathy to the role even when
he's at his most obnoxious.
But this adaptation of the Joe Connelly novel shows Frank mostly being
sad and frustrated during three nights of frenzied paramedic activity
that Scorsese stages with flashy, frantic energy.  While these scenes,
punched up with a lot of sped-up motion and other visual tricks,
effectively capture the insanity and intensity of the high-wire living,
it gets redundant when repeated three times over--especially after it
becomes apparent that Frank is paired with paramedic partners in the
order of their portrayer's placement in the credits (first John Goodman,
then Ving Rhames, then Tom Sizemore).
Despite all the chaos and bleeding bodies, the narrative through-line of
Paul Schrader's script is made obvious from the start: Frank must come to
grips with losing Rose (whose face in those of every person his ambulance
passes by) and accept the reality that he cannot save them all.  Leading
him to this ultimate realization is dealing with a dying heart attack
victim (Cullen Oliver Johnson) kept alive only by the occasional electric
shock.  There's no suspense or mystery to the tale; in _Broken_Vessels_,
the main character's secret--and hence his reasons for a lot of his
behavior--is gradually revealed through the course of the film; in
_Bringing_Out_the_Dead_, Frank divulges just about everything in an
opening voiceover.
So it's up to the actors to engage the attention, and they're up to the
task.  All three of Cage's partners hold their own and make their own
unique stamp; best is Rhames, who is quite amusing as a medic who
preaches the gospel.  Two other actors give admirable performances but
are hampered in other areas.  Patricia Arquette is convincingly pained as
Mary, the daughter of the heart attack victim and Frank's eventual object
of affection, but she and Cage are another of those real-life married
couples who don't exactly ignite onscreen.  Salsa sensation and
newly-minted pop star Marc Anthony is hits the right notes as crazy
street person Noel, but he's less a character than a time filler, asking
for water in the hospital, escaping, causing trouble, getting beaten by
Sizemore's character, and then repeating the cycle.
It's too many repetitions--drunken drives in the ambulance seen in
hyperspeed, the heart attack victim flatlining then getting shocked,
Frank seeing Rose's face--that stretches _Bringing_Out_the_Dead_ to its
two-hour running time and ultimately beyond complete effectiveness.  If
the film had been trimmed down, some of the film's dark atmospherics
would have undoubtedly been lost, but it would have been a more tightly
focused and compelling picture.

CrankyCriticŽ movie reviews: Bringing Out The Dead
Rated [R], [110] minutes
Starring Nicolas Cage, Patricia Arquette, John Goodman, Ving Rhames, Tom
Sizemore
Screenplay by Paul Schrader
Based on the novel by Joe Connelly
Directed by Martin Scorsese
website:www.bringingoutthedead.com
As always, we don't compare to Source Material.
Nicolas Cage has so perfected the hang-dog, wasted, puppy-eyed, lost in
his own body look that it would be really, really nice if he did
something else for a change. After five years as an Emergency Medical
Technician, EMT for short, Frank Pierce (Cage) is doing just about
everything he can to get his ass busted off the job. His gig has turned
into an endless rut of cardiac failures and drug overdoses. He can't
remember the last time he saved a call. His sleep isn't restful and he's
haunted by the ghostly face of Rose, a girl he accidentally helped to
kill in the earliest days of his career. Pierce is a man who has hit
bottom so hard, well, we've seen Cage do it before. . .
The only distraction from what has become a mind-numbing, soul
destroying career is Mary (Patricia Arquette), daughter of yet another
cardiac arrest. Mary has got some drug-taking backstory which adds a
couple extra interesting actors of supporting stature -- Marc Antony
plays Noel, a brain damaged street loon, said damage caused by an
enforcer named Tiger, employee of Stress Reduction Specialist (ie. drug
dealer) Cliff Curtis (Cy Coates), a real slick dude -- but she's another
wrecked soul and the start of their "relationship" has all the spark of
a wet match.
Over the course of two plus days of the story, three different partners
comment on Pierce's attraction to Mary and his obvious problems with the
job. Larry's (John Goodman) is the partner who dreams of Captain bars
and "retirement" to a different unit in the suburbs of Long Island; he
faces his shift with utter indifference, to keep the pain away. Marcus
(Ving Rhames, sporting a full head of hair for a change), the brightest
spark in the entire flick, is having the time of his life saving souls
and preaching to the same Souls as a counterpoint to the daily grind of
seeing the destitute, drug addicted, and frail old folk that are the
residents of his route. His stern warning about getting involved with
the daughter of a call follows the more important rule number one, don't
get emotionally attached to the work, ever. Which, of course, is
Pierce's problem. Partner number three, Tom Walls (Tom Sizemore) is in
the game for the blood, regardless of the cause. If he's got to beat up
on some poor shnook, mentally or physically, to get the job done, so be
it.
If you want to make a movie which pushes the limits of acceptable
behavior in favor of moving the story along, it would be greatly helpful
if there was a minimum of material that the audience can connect to, to
help us believe in the character that is at the center of the story. The
supporting characters, from Rhames on down, are the only elements that
bring a feeling of "real-ness" to the story. Nicolas Cage's recurring
hang-dog looks are no substitute for character development. His
character's ups and downs are so arbitrary that it is inconceivable that
any job supervisor would look the other way and allow the man to climb
behind the wheel. Yet, that is exactly what happens as the coming
crackup is pointedly ignored ("I'll fire you tomorrow!") by a captain
who barks like a dog.
Director Martin Scorsese has brought to the screen, I'm guessing,
everything he knows about visual story telling. There are lovely
slow-speed shutter shots where headlights blur into streaks of light;
super-focused overhead shots of the speeding EMS truck and other
visually impressive elements. Problem is, beautiful stuff doesn't
necessarily have soul, and Cage's character is so dead on his feet that
his redemption, when it comes, doesn't bring anything but a sigh of
relief from the audience that the film is finally over. At a relatively
short 110 minutes, the two plus days shown on screen feel like three
months.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Bringing Out The Dead, he would have
paid...
Midweek rental level, solely for Goodman and Rhames and the soundtrack.
Cranky guesses that way too much money was spent on clearing the rights
for songs by the Stones, Bob Marley, The Clash, Joe Jackson and more,
'cuz they intrude with distracting regularity. In a serious story, this
trivial stuff shouldn't draw attention to itself. It does.

Directed by: Martin Scorsese
Written by: Joe Connelly (novel), Paul Schrader
If there is one thing Martin Scoresese's new film, "Bringing out the Dead"
proves, it is that great actors and great directing cannot save a weak script.
Don't get me wrong, Paul Schrader's script does contain quite a few truly
hilarious scenes, and some wonderful characters, but it is marred by long
stretches of boring, useless material. While the previews talk about Nicholas
Cage's character, Frank Pierce, seeing ghosts all around him, this is really
nothing more than a rather pointless subplot.
Frank Pierce is a paramedic in New York city. While once good at this job,
witnessing the suffering and death around him has taken its toll. Now, he
hasn't saved a life in months, and his nights are filled with ghostly images of
a young lady he was unable to save. His three partners, Larry (John Goodman),
Marcus (Ving Rhames), and Tom (Tom Sizemore), each deal with their jobs in
different ways, but aren't able to help Frank with his troubles. The only
person able to bring anything into Frank's life is Mary Burke (Patricia
Arquette), a young lady whos father has suffered a heart attack and is staying
at Frank's hospital.
"Bringing out the Dead" certainly contains moments of shear brilliance. The
greatest example of this can be found in the use of the film's wonderful
soundtrack. Each song completely enhances the scene in which it is played. From
UB40's "Red, Red Wine" being played during a scene in which goldfish lie dying
upon a blood soaked floor, to "You Can't Put Your Arms Around a Memory" playing
while Frank's ambulance flies across the darkened city streets. If only the
music had been able to enhance scenes in which Frank stares out at the ghost of
the girl, Rose (Cynthia Roman) appears at random, for no apparent reason.
The supporting cast is wonderful here, though underused. John Goodman, great in
an almost pointless role, plays a character similar to Frank, though less
haunted. Ving Rhames, in one of his best performances yet (and that's saying
something), plays a much more hopeful man, who believes he is playing an
important role in these peoples' lives. Last but not least, the always
wonderful, if underrated Tom Sizemore plays a man who can't seem to decide if
he wants to help people or hurt them. If these three men had been present a bit
more often, this truly would have helped the film.
Nicholas Cage plays Nicholas Cage to perfection. No, that is not a typo, I
personally believe that Mr. Cage simply plays himself in dozens of different
roles. Always a depressed, moody, dour man who mutters on and on about how he
can't take life any longer. Patricia Arquette fares better as the troubled drug
addict who can't come to terms with how she feels about her dying father. The
scenes between the two are well written and well acted, and the blossoming
romance never feels forced.
>From what I have said so far, it must sound as though my star rating is a
little too harsh. This is not the case, since I found myself falling asleep
during many segments which served no purpose, and which seemed to drag on
forever. The other major fault, as mentioned earlier, is the underuse of the
other three paramedics. While they were on screen, those three actors brought a
spark to the otherwise rather lifeless script. When absent, the film sputtered
and died.
"Bringing out the Dead" runs too long at 120 minutes which could easily have
been chopped down to 100. I reccomend that if you really want to see it, wait
for video, since little should be lost in the transition. I grant it three
stars. One last comment. For those of you who noticed that the title was taken
from "Monty Python and the Holy Grail", there is a brief line in the film
acknowledging this.
* * * * * - One of the greatest movies ever made, see it now.
* * * * - Great flick. Try and catch this one.
* * * - Okay movie, hits and misses.
* * - Pretty bad. See it if you've got nothing better to do.
* - One of the worst movies ever. See it only if you enjoy pain.

In 1976's Taxi Driver, director Martin Scorsese and writer Paul Schrader
examined the sordid and violent street life of New York through the eyes
of the increasingly disgusted and deranged cabbie Travis Bickle,
memorably played by Robert De Niro in his star-making role.
In Bringing Out The Dead, Scorsese and Schrader have teamed up again to
examine a similar theme. Nicholas Cage plays Frank Pierce, a New York
ambulance driver and paramedic. He works in the same awful urban
environment as Travis Bickle, and the New York tourist board cannot be
at all happy with the portrayal of their city there is no sign here of
the dramatic recent repackaging of New York as a safe and friendly city,
and the hospital scenes are more reminiscent of MASH than ER. The grim
setting is matched by Frank's mood. He is on a bad streak. He is
drinking and he has not saved a life for months. One death in
particular, that of a teenage girl, is haunting him, and he sees her
face everywhere he looks.
Scorsese's early work, such as Mean Streets and Taxi Driver, relied for
its power on a documentary approach to depicting a frantic and
overpoweringly scary reality. With Raging Bull, his enduring
masterpiece, he developed a more technically sophisticated approach.
While fellow New Yorker Brian De Palma is an equally good technician (if
we forget such incompetent tripe as Body Double), Scorsese uses his
mastery of the medium to produce movies that convince while they dazzle.
Films such as Goodfellas, for example, drop us in a world of believable
characters whose story we want to follow, regardless of how repulsive
the characters often are. And despite Scorsese's brilliance, and
Schrader's talent as a writer, it is the lack of a compelling story that
spoils Bringing Out The Dead. Frank is screwed up. He meets a girl. He
sorts himself out. That's about it. This lack of a narrative structure
makes the film a bit limp. There are some typically exhilarating
Scorsese sequences, but they seem almost bolted on because the audience
will expect them, not because they are called on by the story. The most
interesting characters are Frank's fellow ambulance drivers played by a
dream team of Hollywood character actors: a laid-back take-it-or-leave-
it John Goodman, a sweet-talking evangelising Ving Rhames, and a violent
manic Tom Sizemore, who inflicts as much pain and injury as he treats.
Although the film has an original score by veteran Elmer Berstein, the
most striking use of music is found in the use of some wonderful tracks
from such bands as The Who and The Clash, but the relevance of these
British bands from the 70s to a story set in 90s New York was lost on
me. This disjointed and inappropriate use of music perhaps contributes
to the feel of a movie that just doesn't work as a whole.
Bringing Out The Dead is a good film, but not a great one, and with a
master such as Scorsese, anything less than great is a let-down.

To me, Nicolas Cage sounds like an ideal choice for the lead role in a
Martin Scorsese film. Despite the rantings that Sean Penn so rudely
expressed, the actor remains a gifted and versatile screen presence.
Ever since the big success of the action-thriller `Face/Off' in 1997,
the Hollywood road has been a rocky one for Mr. Cage. The perpetually
awful assassination thriller `Snake Eyes' was one of 1998's worst films.
`8MM' was a disappointing lost cause. But who better than Scorsese to
match Cage's wit and intensity, which he does in miraculous fashion with
`Bringing out the Dead'.
Cage delivers one of his finest performances as Frank Pierce, a New York
City Emergency Paramedic who is running on fumes from day-to-day. After
five years of the stress-inducing job, Frank basically just staggers
onward, relying on heavy doses of caffeine and booze until his shift
finally ends. He also begins seeing the ghosts of past patients who died
under his care, namely a young girl named Rose, who stares back at him
with pale features at every street corner in New York. Frank desperately
wants to be fired, but his boss needs him to scour the city and help
those in need (`I'll fire you tomorrow...' he promises).
Frank is accompanied by a fresh face every night in the ambulance. The
first is Larry (John Goodman), who always has food on the brain. The
second is Marcus (Ving Rhames), a deeply religious black man who
incorporates the power of Jesus into a regular rescue operation. And
finally, Tom (Tom Sizemore) is a deranged sociopath hungry for blood. I
found it unique how Scorsese used each of these characters for a single
shift with Frank, but they never figured into the actual plot. Each is
merely a colorful presence to help develop Frank's character, because
`Bringing Out the Dead' is predominantly a study of his mind and
detailed personality.
The one character alongside Frank that truly comes into play is Mary
(Patricia Arquette), the daughter of a newly admitted patient who
suffered from a severe heart attack.  Arquette, who recently received
the wounds of Christ in `Stigmata', performs well around real-life
husband Cage. It's unfortunate that, after such intriguing character
trials and tribulations, the relationship between Frank and Mary slips
during a mishandled, ineffective finale. The movie belongs to the
one-two punch of Cage and Scorsese, who were born to collaborate their
efforts in an arrangement similar to `Bringing Out the Dead'.
Although it certainly lacks the grit and hard-edge of something like
`Goodfellas', Scorsese manages to hit a nerve with his latest picture.
The incredible camera-work and photography represent stunning flashes of
brilliance in an otherwise unspectacular conglomeration. Fans will be
pleased to find the director has returned to his abrasive, darkly
humorous roots after somewhat of a departure with 1997's `Kundun'. Does
`Bringing Out the Dead' rival Scorsese's finest work? Only occasionally.
Some of the film feels surprisingly limp, but there is enough energy in
it's interesting material and breathtaking visual appearance to suffice.
Those expecting a grisly, risqué product may be somewhat disheartened at
the fairly straight-arrow approach - but it's still a solid, admirable
effort.
`Bringing Out the Dead' was written by the acclaimed Paul Schrader, who
collaborated with Scorsese on such classics as `Taxi Driver' and `Raging
Bull'. Schrader's script is full of moments - wonderful, sharply defined
moments - that are sorted throughout the remainder of his meandering
screenplay. The exceptional aspects of the film are it's astounding
technical credits and the amazing cast. Goodman and Sizemore are both
electric (well, mainly Sizemore), but it's the phenomenal Ving Rhames
who deserves a second look. Watch the actor's deeply inspired dedication
as he resurrects a gothic band member, and you'll understand why he won
a Golden Globe.
`Bringing Out the Dead' is raw and electrifying often enough to mask
it's certain flaws. Scorsese - and Cage, for that matter - have done
better, but their intentions are certainly admirable.

If there's something Martin Scorsese can always be credited for, it's
getting whatever his subject is portrayed correctly on screen. "GoodFellas"
is considered by many to be the most accurate Mafia film ever made. "Raging
Bull" got inside a boxing ring with striking realism. His 1997 film,
"Kundun," was a meticulously crafted biography of the Dalai Lama. In his
latest film, "Bringing Out the Dead," Scorsese is clearly going for a
somewhat realistic depiction of the life of a New York City paramedic.
Frankly, never having been a paramedic, I don't really know how good it was,
but it was realistic enough for me. Unfortunately, "Bringing Out the Dead"
isn't quite up to par with other Scorsese works. It's mediocre Marty, which
basically means that while it's not the best he can do, it's well above
average when compared to everything else.
Nicolas Cage stars as Frank Pierce, a paramedic who works the night shift in
New York's Hell's Kitchen. Frank hasn't been sleeping well. He hasn't saved
anyone for months, and he is constantly haunted by the spirit of a dead
girl, the one that kicked off his "losing streak." The film opens has Frank
and his partner, Larry (John Goodman), take a call for an old man suffering
from a heart attack in his apartment. The old man seems to be a lost cause,
but shows a faint heartbeat at the last minute. This sudden hopeful case
causes Frank to become enamored of the old man's daughter Mary (Patricia
Arquette), despite his colleagues' warnings not to get involved with
patients. The rest of the film shows three nights Frank spends on the job,
with a new partner on each of the following two nights. Marcus (Ving
Rhames), the second partner, is a religious man who takes each assignment as
an opportunity to turn his patients into believers, while Tom (Tom
Sizemore), the third partner, is a sadistic fellow who enjoys his job only
for the chance it affords him to see blood. Frank, meanwhile, spends each
day looking for some kind of redemption for his previous failure.
If the previous paragraph doesn't sound like much of a plot summary, that's
probably because "Bringing Out the Dead" doesn't have much of a plot to
speak of. That's not necessarily a detriment, mind you. This is clearly a
character-driven flick, concentrating on three days in the life of Frank
Pierce. Scorsese provides plenty of his trademark visual flair, which keeps
the proceedings continually interesting, even while the story slows down. We
see New York City as only Martin Scorsese could film it, with the worst kind
of scum imaginable, and Scorsese films them from all angles, in all shades
of color. It's a kind of acid trip, only legal. Like most of this director's
films, this one is always strangely engrossing, the kind of film you can't
take your eyes off of, even if you don't know why.
Nicolas Cage seems a little too restrained in his role, one that he probably
should have cut loose in. He seems to spend an awful lot of time staring up
into the camera and looking a little too disinterested. Maybe he's been
ruined by appearing in one too many brainless action movies that didn't
exactly demand much from him as a thespian. I really shouldn't knock Cage,
though. This is definitely his best performance since "Leaving Las Vegas,"
and it's loads better than his impression of a sleepwalker in "8mm." After
all, to see a truly disinterested performance, one need look no further than
Cage's co-star in this film. I don't know what somebody slipped into
Patricia Arquette's drink, but it definitely put her to sleep. Granted, she
has an uncanny ability to resonate innocence and warmth, but far too many of
her scenes felt like line-reading, complete with the random pauses of
someone who sounds like she's reading the script for the first time.
Arquette is certainly better than she was in "Stigmata," but that's not
saying much. The real bright spots of the cast are in the supporting parts.
All three of Cage's partners are perfect in their roles. John Goodman is
laconic and tired as Larry, which is exactly what the character calls for.
Ving Rhames is a hoot as the devout Marcus, who spends the early part of the
night flirting with the dispatcher (voiced by Queen Latifah), and then
treats his assignments as a chance to convert patients to Christianity. A
particularly good scene has him tricking a bunch of Goth rockers into
believing that their friend has been healed by divine intervention, when it
was really just an adrenaline shot from Cage. Tom Sizemore is appropriately
over-the-top as the psychotic Tom Walls. The scene where he attacks his
ambulance as Cage takes off work is priceless. Pop singer Marc Anthony does
a surprising turn as a whacked-out junkie, and does it well.
As is to be expected from Scorsese, the film is often exhilarating, with
symbolism to spare. I particularly liked the allegory of the dying man in
the desert, begging for a glass of water. Frank has had people dying on him
for so long that he just wants to save a life because "it's the greatest
high in the world." There is plenty of wry humor to counterbalance the
seriousness, meaning that "Bringing Out the Dead" is almost always
interesting to watch. There's just something wrong with it, however, that
keeps me from proclaiming it a masterpiece along with Scorsese's greatest
films. I think it has to do with a lack of true focus in Paul Schrader's
screenplay, and with the performances of Cage and Arquette. The film isn't
plot-driven, which is fine if you've got an interesting and well-developed
character. After all, "Taxi Driver" didn't have much of a plot, but Travis
Bickle was one of the most dynamic characters in American cinema. Frank
Pierce just isn't very interesting. There isn't half the character
development we saw in "Taxi Driver" or "Raging Bull" (no Robert De Niro
either, interestingly enough), and Cage doesn't help much with his
good-but-not-great performance. Another problem is the surprising lack of
chemistry between Cage and real-life wife Arquette. Where are De Niro and
Jodie Foster when you need them? I wasn't terribly interested in their
relationship until the final scene which, though a beautiful image, had its
power diluted by the draggy early ones.
Scorsese always has a knack for finding wonderful imagery in every film,
which he does in "Bringing Out the Dead." I loved seeing his vision of how
the ghost of the young girl appears to Cage, the aforementioned final shot,
Cage's hallucination about pulling people out of manholes, and countless
other breathtaking images. Even though he does go a bit overboard with this
when he practically turns Cage into a walking light bulb in the penultimate
sequence, it's not in Scorsese's direction that the major problem lies. The
real problem is a surprisingly lackluster screenplay turned out by Paul
Schrader, who scripted many of Scorsese's better films ("Taxi Driver,"
"Raging Bull," "The Last Temptation of Christ"). There is plenty of clever
dialogue and dark comedy, but little story or character development, and I
can't shake the idea that I just saw "Taxi Driver Lite." Despite these
problems, "Bringing Out the Dead" is still a fascinating film. It may not be
up to Scorsese's usual high standards, but would certainly be an impressive
accomplishment for an artist of lower standing. It's mediocre Marty, but
certainly top-level Schumacher.

Of the most chaotic times and places to be, I would
give my vote to the early 1990s in the Hell's Kitchen
district of New York City.  It is a time period when
drug use and the devastation of the AIDS epidemic were
on the rise.  And it is a place where, at night, the
streets seem like a swamp of despair and hopelessness
where even the neighborhood citizens scurry around
like rats.  It is this setting where `Bringing Out the
Dead' takes place.  We are introduced to Frank Pierce
(Nicolas Cage) who is a paramedic, and it is through
his eyes that we see the gloomy world in which he
exists.
Frank works the graveyard shift and every night seems
like a full moon.  All the city's craziness that has
been bottled up is about to erupt.  On top of that,
Frank hasn't had a good night's sleep for days and he
hasn't been able to save any lives in over a month. 
Frank's hands are gifted and his heart is giving.  But
there is only so much that he can do in this time and
place.  The ghosts of those that he could not save
haunt him.  He drifts in and out of a state of
bewildered consciousness.  This is not an easy life. 
`Bringing Out the Dead' shows us three long nights in
the life of Frank as the burned out paramedic.  In the
first night, he's paired up with Larry (John Goodman)
who sees his job as simply a meal ticket.  Save lives,
get paid, and eat.  He's almost too relaxed given the
nature of his job.  On the second night, he is paired
up with the ultra-religious Marcus (Ving Rhames).  He
uses their emergency visits as a way to promote their
healing techniques as miracles.  Finally, his third
partner is Walls (Tom Sizemore), a sadistic person who
feels that it is better to beat up frequent visitors
to the emergency room rather than to transport them
there again and again and again.  Two other characters
factor into Frank's life.  One is Noel (pop star Marc
Anthony), who is one of those frequent visitors.  He
represents every hollowed soul whose life is consumed
with misery and drugs.  The other is the reformed
addict Mary (Patricia Arquette).  In trying to save
Mary from her state of turmoil, Frank may rid himself
of his inner demons.
`Dead' is truly a Director's film.  That is, it does
not succumb to Hollywood's familiar formula of
storytelling.  Scorsese has free reign to make his
kind of picture, and it is a work of directorial
excellence, uncompromising in detail and atmosphere. 
Perhaps its only weakness could be that it lacks the
dramatic arc and the climax that most moviegoers
expect from today's films.  In fact, there is no real
plot, as it relies on individual events.  But this
film is a wonderful exercise in bringing to fruition
the extended limbo in which Frank exists.  Cage does
all the right things that bring out Frank's pain and
despondence.  And all of the supporting characters and
the excellent camera work add vivid color to a world
that many would probably rather be lost and forgotten.
 This is definitely not a feel-good film like `Happy
Texas.'  And this film probably won't gross huge box
office dollars.  But a few Oscar bids are probably in
order, including Best Director for Scorcese. 
`Bringing Out the Dead' is terrific filmmaking from
one of Hollywood's greats.

     The title of Martin Scorsese's new movie (adapted by Paul Schrader
from the bestseller by former paramedic Joe Connelly) reflects the grisly
cry of corpse-collectors in plague-stricken 18th century London: "Bring out
your dead!"  The New York City Scorsese shows us at the end of the 20th
century is gripped by no less deadly a plague; it is a nightmare world
crushed under an epidemic of drugs, violence, and indifference.
Scorsese is perhaps the most revered living American director, admired
by peers and critics for his mastery of the language of film.  And yet he
is a director with a deep and abiding propensity to disappoint.  In
"Bringing Out the Dead" he disappoints again, with a movie that lacks
narrative drive and coherence, but that still manages to pack plenty of
virtuoso filmmaking into its two hours.
At the center of things is Frank Pierce, a paramedic at the end of his
skein, played by Nicolas Cage in a stunned, anguished trance.  Pale of skin
and dark of eye, he looks as if he's been made up for a Tim Burton movie. 
Frank drives an ambulance through the streets of New York accompanied by a
series of partners, listening to emergency radio dispatches broadcast as
Altmanesque asides ("A woman has gone into cardiac arrest because a roach
has crawled in her ear and she can't get it out") and sometimes responding
to them.  
The action (you couldn't call it story) covers three nights in Frank's
disintegrating life.  On the first, he's called to try to revive a man
who's had a heart attack, and manages to get a heartbeat again after the
man's been dead for 20 minutes.  He's ambivalent about this ("I've come to
believe in spirits leaving the body and not wanting to come back"), but
he's been on a losing streak, hasn't saved a life in months, and then
there's the man's daughter (Patricia Arquette), who seems to light some
extinguished fire deep in Frank's spiritual wasteland.  
Arquette is bland, and Cage's mumbling, stumbling performance
(occasionally leavened by bursts of manic energy) is drawn from the actor's
increasingly familiar and finite bag of tricks.  The performances that give
this film life come from his three partners, John Goodman, Tom Sizemore,
and especially Ving Rhames.  There's also a wonderfully sinister velvet
turn from New Zealander Cliff Curtis ("Three Kings") as an upscale drug
dealer, and Mary Beth Hurt is memorable as a tough-talking ER nurse ("I
don't see why we should help you -- did we shove the heroin up your nose?")
Scorsese dazzles with some breathtaking visuals and powerful scenes,
but the movie has an unfocused, rambling feel that reaches several climaxes
of ennui before it plays itself out.

   "This city'll kill ya," says Mary (Patricia Arquette), a
depressed New Yorker who has been clean for years but is
now drifting back into drugs to bury her pain.  Her comment
could be taken metaphorically, but for the people in Martin
Scorsese's new and gritty movie, a film that like all others by
that gifted director relies only minimally on tired formulas, the
suggestion is in fact literally true.  The screenplay, written by
long-term Scorsese collaborator Paul Schrader from a novel
by Joe Connelly, is not the sort that the Big Apple Tourist
Board would promote.  "Bringing Out the Dead," which takes
place in the early 1990s and is situated in the grimy Hell's
Kitchen area of the West 40s (the scene as well of Leonard
Bernstein and Arthur Laurents' musical "West Side Story"),
depicts a city badly in need of a strong mayor and a heavy
dose of moral fiber.  It could, in fact, have served as a
campaign video for Rudy Giuliani, who became its current
resident in Gracie Mansion on a promise to tighten law
enforcement and employ a zero-tolerance policy toward
malefactors.  While "Bringing Out the Dead" bears a strong
Scorsese imprint (in some ways a virtual sequel to his 1976
masterwork "Taxi Driver"), life in the city's lower depths
serves as mere background, however intensive, for an
exploration of its central characters who are each grieving for
a lost opportunity and seek closure in each other's
companionship.  This is also Nicolas Cage's finest
performance since his equally somber role as an alcoholic
determined to drink himself to death in Mike Figgis's
wonderful 1995 film "Leaving Las Vegas."
   This time around, Cage performs in the role of Frank
Pierce, a paramedic who drives an ambulance on the night
shift with three distinctly different partners, and who regrets
that he has not saved a life in many moons.  The movie is
chock full of leathery scenes, many portraying Gorky-like
depths of depravity.   "Bringing Out the Dead"--based
perhaps on the daily rounds made by its novelist, Joe
Connelly, who was himself a paramedic--is likely as not to
make you wonder why people choose high-stress
occupations which for all the strain do not pay princely sums
to their agents.  Scorcese's movie, not for anyone who insists
on a "good story" with a tight plot, takes us a three-day
physical and psychological ride with Frank, with his three
fellow drivers, and with the crew manning the emergency
room of an overburdened New York City hospital
appropriately named Our Lady of Perpetual Mercy. 
   The burnt-out Frank, who openly and self-destructively
challenges his boss (played in a small role by Martin
Scorcese himself), to fire him, patrols the streets of the West
Forties with his quirky partners, radio frequently jumping to
life with emergency assignments.  As Frank occasionally
narrates his story in a voiceover, we follow him as he
responds to a call regarding an old man in cardiac arrest
whose entire family jumps each time Frank administers a
shock from a defibrillator. Other calls, treated more routinely,
include the picking up of a suicidal man; the parking of a
chronic drunk into a wheelchair prior to his transport to the
hospital; and the pursuit of an addicted, violent, and paranoid
man named Noel (Marc Anthony) who regularly cries out for a
cup of water.  The film's one faintly humorous scene takes
place in the crash-pad of a small-time drug seller, a regular
Mr. Cool, who appears to take his customers' problems to
heart and allows them to take much needed rests in his
apartment while the sedative effects of his merchandise kick
in.
   Scorsese also makes points in displaying the idiosyncrasies
of Frank's partners: Larry (John Goodman), a foodaholic who
covers up his problems by overindulging; Marcus (Ving
Rhames), a Christian fundamentalist who treats his job of
bringing back the dead as the work of Jesus; and the sadistic
Walls (Tom Sizemore), a veritable human vampire who
figuratively thirsts for blood and welcomes the cracking of the
ambulance radio that allow him to chase after mauled and
maimed victims of violence.
   Much of "Bringing Out the Dead" is unfortunately routine
and predictable, the stuff of TV hospital dramas and "48
Hours" style documentaries.  By now, most people are at
least vaguely aware of the unending suffering of the poor,
who seek aid in emergency rooms rather than embrace the
services of private physicians.  The druggies, the drunks, and
the crazies are not particularly interesting and we learn
nothing about them that could enlighten us to the sources of
their misery.  
   On the other hand, the growing relationship of Frank and
Mary (Cage and Arquette are married in real life and work
together for the first time), is compelling, particularly because
Scorsese does not push the usual buttons to establish a
romantic bond between them.  Mary has been estranged from
her father for a few years and begs the hospital staff to use
extreme measures to keep him alive.  When that becomes
increasingly unlikely, she turns to Frank, with whom she has
established a tie, and who needs her as well to get over his
repeated contacts with the ghost of an 18-year-old girl whose
life he was unable to save.  To the extent that they succeed
in redeeming each other, the movie is not a downer--contrary
to the opinion of Wall Street Journal critic Joe Morgenstern
who, in a recent commentary on CNN, turned thumbs down
simply because he felt that the film was not sufficiently feel-
good.  "Bringing Out the Dead," then, is a mixed bag--one
whose background noise is unremarkable but whose success
in establishing a compelling connection between Nicolas
Cage and Patricia Arquette is most satisfying.

Martin Scorsese's BRINGING OUT THE DEAD might have been more aptly
titled ACTING LIKE THE DEAD.  The near comatose movie has a few scenes
of black humor that work, but generally the story just drags until the
ending credits finally put the film out of its misery.
In the starring role, Nicolas Cage plays his usual crazy character,
which varies only in the degree of the insanity.  As paramedic Frank
Pierce, Cage is one of a rag-tag group of psychotic ambulance drivers
from Our Lady of Perpetual Mercy.  The drivers beat up patients, wreck
their ambulances, use their own drugs and drink while driving.  The
movie makes their jobs look horrible and their resulting conduct seem a
natural reaction to their environment.
Although part of film has a supernatural component as Frank hears and
sees previous patients who have died and come back to haunt him, this is
no more than a subplot.  Most of the film is an awkward blend of gritty,
New York City realism and over-the-top black comedy.
Overlaid on the scenes are Frank's pretentious musings.  ("Saving
someone's life is like falling in love." and "I was a great relief mop.
It was enough that I just showed up.")  Paul Schrader's meandering
script is based on a Joe Connelly novel.
The story's only completely satisfying sequence has Frank continuing to
try, without any success, to get himself fired.  His boss always
promises to fire him tomorrow, but doesn't.
Gore is everywhere, and Frank's white shirt is usually polka dotted with
blood splatters.  The show makes the patients so despicable that you'll
find yourself secretly hoping for their demise.  The hospital is such a
mad house that you'll feel like arresting the staff and the patients for
disorderly conduct.
As Frank's friend and a daughter of his first patient, Patricia Arquette
gives another in her long string of pathetic performances, her last in
STIGMATA being her worst.  The other members of the supporting cast
include John Goodman, Ving Rhames and Tom Sizemore, as the other
ambulance drivers.  The three manage to rise a little above the
hackneyed level of the scripting.
"It's been bad lately, but it's always bad," Frank says of the condition
in the emergency room.  The same could be said of most of the movie.
Including KUNDEN, Scorsese has now produced two yawners in a row.  Let's
hope he gets back in his groove before his next picture.
BRINGING OUT THE DEAD runs a long 2:00.  It is rated R for gritty
violent content, drug use and language and would be acceptable for
teenagers who are both older and can handle horrific images.

  With a few exceptions, Martin Scorsese has generally been a favorite director
of mine. With such classics like Raging Bull, Goodfellas and my personal
favorite Taxi Driver, I usually am interested in what his latest project will
be. Bringing Out The Dead may not be up to par to Taxi Driver, but it's by far
his best film since Goodfellas, which might be a relief for hard-core Scorsese
fans.
  If you know Scorsese, there's not much of a plot to his films, because he
likes to explore the characters to his films, like in Taxi Driver, which had a
huge impact on critics. In Bringing Out The Dead, his characters aren't
explored that deeply. Cage's character in this film was deeply disturbed. He
wanders the streets of New York in an ambulance with his fellow medics, as they
rescue dying patients. The first stop is with an old man, who we see throughout
the film. When the old man arrives at the hospital, Cage gets acquainted with
the man's daughter (Patricia Arquette). For some reason Cage runs into her
often, as he runs back and forth in his ambulance. When he's out on the streets
he is haunted by patients he couldn't save. It's like ER in hell for Cage, as
he experiences these horrifying moments on a regular basis. 
  You would think that seeing dead patients would spark more interest for the
viewers, but quite frankly that never occurs. The whole film I was waiting for
something more, but unfortunately Schrader never delivered. It's not like
Scorsese to keep the pace steady the full time. I was quite disappointed by the
film's effort. It should have changed direction, or at least had a unique
climax. 
  On the brighter side the acting was the only enlightening feature that kept
the film flowing. Even though the film was displeasing, Nic Cage still managed
to perform his part rather well. If anyone looks like he's been through hell,
it's him. Those depressed eyes, and dreary look really added to the atmosphere
that Scorsese was shooting for.
The other supporting actors added some enjoyable tones as well. John Goodman is
the serious partner, Ving Rhames the religious one, and Tom Sizemore is as
crazy, if not crazier than Cage. Despite Sizemore's hostility towards others, I
couldn't help but be intrigued by what could possibly posses such cruelty
towards injured or sick patients. Pretty disturbing if you ask me.
  Martin Scorsese turns in a typical directing approach. Some noteworthy
remarks I had were the camera angels, as they speed past the ambulance so that
we get the same rush that the characters feel. There's also some twisted side
shots of the ambulance going down a dark alley. He does this a few times, and
it's quite appealing for those interested in technical uses.
  Like Goodfellas, Scorsese continues to put out a rocking soundtrack with
tunes by the R.E.M, The Clash and Van Morrison. You have to applaud at his
choice of music, because oddly enough, these songs fit the film perfectly. He
definitely chooses wisely.
  Although "Bringing Out The Dead" is a let down, fans will enjoy it's attempt.
Some may hate it's never-ending story, but others may like what it has to
offer. Not for people with low attention spans.

BRINGING OUT THE DEAD (R).  
(Touchstone/Paramount/Buena Vista International)
Director: Martin Scorsese
Stars: Nicolas Cage, Patricia Arquette, John Goodman, Ving Rhames, Tom 
Sizemore, Mary Beth Hurt, Marc Anthony, Cliff Curtis, with the voices
of Martin Scorsese and Queen Latifah as dispatchers
Running time: 121 minutes.
Martin Scorsese returns to the mean streets of New York for
this blistering, intense and frenetically paced journey through 56
hours in the life of a traumatised paramedic.  Paramedics are the
emergency response medical teams that nightly race through the
cesspool of a major city in decay, dealing with alcoholics, drug
overdoses, violence, suicide, death and misery, and cleaning up the
human detritus.
Frank Pierce (Nicolas Cage) is a burnt out case, fuelled by a
mixture of booze, pills, adrenaline, and haunted by the ghosts of
those he has been unable to save - in particular, Rosa, a teenage
Puerto Rican girl.  Then he begins a relationship with Mary Burke
(Cage's real life wife Patricia Arquette), the daughter of a heart
attack victim, and briefly glimpses a hope of salvation.  We gain more
insight into Frank's fragile state through the contrast of his three
partners, who all have their own way of dealing with the pressures.
Larry (John Goodman) is an essentially decent man who remains detached
from the carnage he witnesses on a nightly basis.  The fast talking
and deeply religious Marcus (Ving Rhames) uses a sense of humour as a
defence mechanism, while Tom (Tom Sizemore) is a volatile, blunt and
colourful sociopath who loves taking risks.
Taking a break from action hero mode, Cage returns to the type
of intense, flawed every man that he plays so convincingly.  His
drawn, haunted looking face, dishevelled and manic appearance are
perfectly suited to his role here as a man on the brink of a breakdown
and barely able to cope with the pressures of his job.
Bringing Out The Dead is based on the best selling novel
written by Joe Connelly, himself a former paramedic, who spent ten
years with the New York service, and worked on the film as a technical
adviser.  Script writer Paul Schrader (Taxi Driver, etc) brings a
gritty, blackly comic edge to the material, which Scorsese directs
with his typical relentless energy and cinematic flair.  He brings a
frantic quality and uncompromising realism to the film, which is
shaped by his brilliant mix of music, stunning visual verve and deft
use of symbolism.  Veteran cinematographer Robert Richardson creates a
surreal portrait of New York, and his dazzling, dizzy camera races
through the city at breakneck speed.
If you thought the emergency room of a certain television
series was weird, here Scorsese depicts it as anarchic, chaotic and
combustible, giving these scenes a nightmarish quality.  Bringing Out
The Dead is a powerful return to form for Scorsese, one of America's
finest directors.

"Saving someone's life is like being in love. It's the best drug in
the world. You feel like God was in you. And why deny it? Why deny
that for a moment God was you"
"The night started out with a bang. All the elements were in place for
a long weekend: heat, humidity, moonlight. I was good at my job. There
were periods when my hands moved with a speed and skill beyond me. But
during the last year I started to loose that control. Things had
turned bad. I haven't saved anyone in months. I have come to believe
in such things as spirits leaving the body and not wanting to be put
back. I grew up in this neighborhood. I worked here most as a
paramedic and it had more ghosts per square foot than any
other. Rose's ghost was getting closer. I just needed a good night's
sleep and a couple of days off. It was six months since I lost
Rose. Homeless. Asthmatic. 18 years old. I used to block bad calls
out, but she wouldn't let go. And now she came to bare witness for all
of them -- all that have been lost. I've always had nightmares, but
now the ghosts didn't wait for me to sleep. They were part of the job-
the eyes of a corpse, the screams of a loved one. After a while I came
to understand that my role was less about saving lives, but about
bearing witness. It was enough that I simply showed up. Except with
Rose..."  Š Paramount Pictures
It is the early 1990's and New York has not yet undergone its
renaissance of recent years. Sirens screaming and lights flashing, a
New York City ambulance speeds through the night. Its drivers are
paramedics working the graveyard shift -- men who come face-to-face
with the dead and the dying on a daily basis. Burnt out from one too
many nights on the job, they are nearly as broken as the bodies they
haul through the streets. What keeps them going is their caustic sense
of comedy, and an acrid view of a world which seems to have its
surreal epicenter in Manhattan. Frank (Nicolas Cage) is among them. He
has been doing this for 5 years and it is both his salvation and his
doom, his dream and his nightmare. When he saves someone's life
everything inside him glows and he feels as light as a feather. It's
another thing when he looses a patient. And it is those cases that
turn his life into an eternal hell. Tormented by horrible nightmares
and haunted by ghosts of the people that he didn't manage to save, he
reaches the very brink of spiritual collapse and redemption. We follow
him and his colleges during 56 hours of their lives and share the
experience of being a paramedic. Among them is the angry Tom (Tom
Sizemore), the holy Marcus (Ving Rames) and the tiered Larry (John
Goodman).
This is the long awaited comeback of the respected and acclaimed
director Martin Scorsese, and I can assure you that it has been worth
waiting for. Scorsese has always been a controversial director that
created some of the best films Hollywood had to offer over the
years. 'Bringing Out the Dead' doesn't have his most obvious
trademarks, since this is not a mafia-fable, there is no particular
violence or gore, and Robert De Niro is not in it. But artistically
this is certainly 'A Martin Scorsese Film'. There is no particular
story or character development. No melodrama. No climatic ending. This
is reality. There is no question about it. It is 56 hours of a
life. Scorsese, along side with Paul Schrader ('Taxi Driver') creates
incredible characters that are so real, so human and vulnerable that
we connect with them immediately. They live in a world, unknown to
us. A world of eternal night, constant death, blood and
suffering. There are periods of depression, a feeling of
worthlessness, when they are not saving anyone. They feel like
messengers of death. Confused, tormented, haunted, angry, they are all
searching for someone to blame. A way to make their pain go away. All
they feel is a constant longing for peace -- for that long forgotten
feeling of closing the eyes and simply float away. They are not
rescuers. They are not saviors. Their job is simple -- they are
brining out the dead. This is a wildly surreal film. There is a
bizarre feeling of a world within a world. Scorsese unravels his dark
vision and paints a devastating picture of madness, paranoia, fear and
death that form a void, a darkness that swallows you and doesn't let
go.  His film is explosive, expressive, fast paced and haunting. At
times Scorsese is resorting to a pitch dark comedy, without loosing
his point. "Hold this. If you let go, I swear, I won't kill you,"
Frank warns a suicidal character with another unexpected, throwaway
punchline characteristic of all film's dialogue.  But mostly Scorsese
does what he does best -- displaying the pure, na k their
frustrations, by channeling them into something else. Frank and his
friends have all gone mad in their own direction. Larry races from
diner to fast food joint, dreaming of the suburbs. Tom's way is anger,
a murderous rage, a poor attempt to enjoy the blood and death
surrounding him, that somehow compensates for the incredible pain that
he is feeling. Marcus survives by putting his trust and hope in faith,
a belief that all the death, misery and suffering happen according to
God's divine and unknown plan. But none of their coping mechanisms
work for Frank. For him life is just a void, an existence in a never
ending darkness from which there is no escape.
Every performance is so controlled, so perfect, so real that you never
question its authenticity. Nicolas Cage, an actor that has been
accused of being a 'paycheck player', choosing money instead of art,
shows his talent in a soulful and committed performance as the
tortured and half-crazed paramedic. He mixes downcast periods of
gloomy introspection with episodes of wild, lunatic abandon. At times
his bloodshot, tormented eyes portray more sorrow and depth than any
words that he is pronouncing. This is certainly Cage's best
performance since 'Leaving Las Vegas'. Tom Sizemore ('Heat', 'Saving
Private Ryan' ) is equally magnificent. He releases so much energy, so
much emotion and power into his performance that he looks more like a
ticking bomb rather than a person. Ving Rames ('Entrapment' ) gives a
brilliant comic performance as the 'holy medic'. There are times when
before resurrecting someone on the streets he (in a high pitched
voice) asks God's forgiveness for "these sinners". Visually and
technically this film is above perfect. Robert Richardson's
cinematography is rich and inventive, employing some crazy shots as
the camera turns the world upside down. Thelma Schoonmaker binds
Richardson's shots together with her explosive editing, fast motion,
flashing lights and neon glow. The music is provided by Elmer
Bernstein's bizarre, eclectic score and some wisely inserted songs by
Van Morrison and The Clash, among others. When all those elements are
combined, they create an almost carnival atmosphere of light and
shade, speed and violence that really gets under the skin. New York
has never looked so dark before. The streets are empty, lit only by
the pale moon, neon glow and flashing red lights of an ambulance. The
only inhabitants are shadows, filth and dust. In other words, Scorsese
has created a wildly surreal, dark and effectively paranoid motion
picture, which is the director's best work since 'Goodfellas'
(1990). Remember: This is NOT a light, entertaining popcorn-film or a
feel-good movie. It is an incred i tale, which is nothing less than a
powerful and emotionally devastating cinematic experience, created by
the maestro of shadows and light.

     One has to wonder if Martin Scorsese's worldview stops at the New
Jersey state line.
     A shocking disappointment, BRINGING OUT THE DEAD marks Scorsese's
first film since KUNDUN, and his first contemporary movie since CASINO.
So neither of these took place in New York, but Scorsese is so in love
with his hometown, it shows through in all his work.  DEAD actually
begins with the title card, `This film takes place in New York City' (or
something close to that), just so there's no confusion.
     Confusion about where you are?  Impossible.  DEAD is little more
than a series of only-in-NYC horror stories about New York paramedic
Frank Pierce (Cage), a burnt-out ambulance driver who's slowly going
crazy, and who thinks he sees the spirits of the people whose lives he
didn't save.  His partners are all nuts (Goodman, Rhames, and Sizemore 
who together save this picture from the dustbin), and he finds himself
inexplicably attracted to Mary (Arquette), the daughter of a patient
whom he inexplicably revives.
     In fact, inexplicable is an apt word for most of BRINGING OUT THE
DEAD.  Despite a promising concept (get inside the head of a wacked-out
paramedic), it's one blown opportunity after another.  (See PUSHING TIN
for another film with the same problem.)  Instead of good writing, the
story meanders interminably, relying on a hip soundtrack and cute camera
tricks to propel the plot.  Frank's obsession with the deceased Rose is
baffling, yet it drives most of the action.
     BRINGING OUT THE DEAD is based on the novel of the same name, and
indeed, it feels like the novel has been adapted in full for the screen,
with long, dull voice-over monologues, surreal dream sequences, quirky
supporting cast members, and go-nowhere subplots.  This is not an
effective way to make a film.  Scorsese obsessives will love it.  The
rest of the world will not.
     Kudos to Ving Rhames as the best of Cage's partners, a character
best described as John Shaft meets Jimmy Swaggart.  He'll be on my short
list for Best Supporting Actor, even if he did only have five minutes of
screen time.

Martin Scorsese's Bringing out the Dead, staring Nicholas Cage, is an 
edgy and unusual, yet solid, film. The movie, despite the absence of a 
material plot, has strong themes and character development that serve as 
a guide through a two-hour span. Those seeking deep and meaningful 
content similar to the director's Taxi Driver and Goodfellas or 
Cage's Leaving Las Vegas will not be disappointed. But those looking 
for a film that hops on the emergency room bandwagon in wake of hit 
television shows like ER, Chicago Hope and the new Third Watch may find 
this film to be too much of an intellectual challenge and are advised to 
seek their thrills in the popcorn hit Double Jeopardy.
"This film takes place in New York City in the early 90's" read the 
first words across the screen. Those 13 words and the ambulance that 
appears soon after create the film's most important character: the 
city. The audience can gather that the Big Apple is still a crime 
polluted mess in the pre-Giuliani era and that hospitals are an equally 
large issue. Just in case any doubt lingers, the film quickly shows us 
streets lined with prostitutes and hospital hallways lined with 
stretchers. From there emerges the hero, Frank Peirce (Nicholas Cage), 
an ambulance driver who has seen it all. For the next 58 hours (three 
nights, two days) Peirce will experience a variety of extreme measures, 
and the audience looks on in an almost voyeuristic fashion.
Peirce fringes on insanity throughout the film due to the numerous 
people who come into his ambulance pronounced insane and leave it 
pronounced dead. He gets them all, from the drug addicts to the suicidal 
to the "just plain nuts." This makes for an interesting juxtaposition: 
society's insane vs. society's insane workers. And then there are 
the corpses that he sees regularly, making him witness to more last 
moments than the average person's tolerance could possibly allow. Like 
all the other drivers, hebuilds an immunity, but, during these 58 hours, 
that shield is dropped.
Bringing out the Dead is sprinkled with the type of deranged and 
desperately dark humor that you only find amusing somewhere around 3:00 
AM when you are out of caffeine but forced to stay awake. Scorsese 
creates that setting so well that the jokes not only work, but you come 
to rely on their comic relief as a means of surviving the film. 
Highlights include the assorted calls that come through the ambulance 
radio (elderly woman abducted by her cat, etc..) and one scene where 
Peirce and eccentric fellow driver (Ving Rhames) find a supposedly dead 
victim, but stage a dramatically overdone revival for his stoned 
friends.
This summer, another legendary director gave us his look at New York 
City by following a character over a period of a few days. In Eyes Wide 
Shut, Stanley Kubrick portrayed an upper-class, secretive and perverse 
society that seemed to function completely on its own. Scorsese's look 
into paramedics is very similar. The men we meet run the night shift and 
find themselves isolated from society. They know each other, recognize 
their peers' ins and outs and are even accustomed to some of the same 
drug and alcohol calls from people who never learn their lesson and 
revolve in and out of the hospital doors.
Another summer film set in New York City showed the power of using 
contrasting music and scenes. Throughout Summer of Sam, as people would 
be brutally murdered on the streets, bright and uplifting music would 
dominate the moment. In Bringing out the Dead a whole panoply of tracks 
come into play. Stretchers, crying families and bloody scenes are 
accompanied by Van Morrison, R. E. M., The Who, UB40, Martha Reeves & 
The Vandellas and Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue (famous in part for 
another New York film, the Woody Allen classic Manhattan).
Bringing out the Dead is a thought-provoking and powerful film. Like the 
other cerebral movie at a theatre near you, American Beauty, this 
production can look for a prolonged box office run with no leading 
numbers but a positive buzz to give it stable positioning. Early on, 
Peirce tells us "I am good at my job." So is Martin Scorsese.

Martin Scorcese has never been one to avoid seamy subjects.   Like many of 
his other films, "Bringing Out the Dead" depicts some of the clearest 
glances we have seen of the grit and grief of life.  It's also very artfully 
made, replete with gutsy risks you wouldn't think would come from a veteran 
filmmaker.
Nicolas Cage plays New York City - Hell's Kitchen, specifically - paramedic 
Frank Pierce, a man in the advanced stages of burnout.  He doesn't eat much 
of anything, he drinks during his shifts, he tries half-heartedly to get 
fired.  But something gets him out on the dark streets again.
What gives the film its most recognizable structure are the three different 
partners Pierce rides with on three consecutive days.  Each of these 
coworkers deals with the job in eccentric ways;  it's Pierce that seems to 
be failing to cope successfully.  Dark flesh encircles his eyes, which stare 
out the windows of the ambulance like one witnessing an apocalypse.  It's 
clear the setting - early 1990's New York - has affected him for the worse, 
as many of the faces roaming the streets take on the aspect of a spectre, a 
girl who died during Frank's watch.  Because he can't get her off his mind, 
he shows signs of beginning to lose it.
Another unifying aspect is the man revived by Frank and his partner Larry 
(John Goodman).  Mr. Burke had been dead for several moments, but when Frank 
sees the grief caused by the loss, he appears to redouble his efforts.  The 
result, Burke is taken to Our Lady of Perpetual Mercy, the hospital where 
bedlam reigns, and kept aggressively on life support.  After Frank spends 
some time with Burke's daughter Mary (Cage's wife Patricia Arquette), he 
shows sign of an infatuation with her.  Attracted by her vulnerability - 
she's a recovering addict - Frank supports her by being there to listen.  
Will she be a focal point to cure his blurry lifestyle?  Or will the high 
rates of speed at which Frank travels finally cause an accident?
Martin Scorcese's vision of New York is one of the most fascinating takes in 
recent years.  We see it mostly during the night,  the camera going in 
constricting gyres, the traffic as well as the skyline quickening in time 
elapse.  We witness many of the same sordid scenes we saw Travis Bickle 
coursing through in "Taxi Driver," steam rising from manholes, hookers and 
other social desperadoes peopling the periphery.  In a small but powerful 
moment, Larry parks the rig on a pier and catches forty winks, while the 
insomniac Frank stares from his haunted eyes.  Shadows of raindrops on the 
ambulance windows stain Frank's face like drops of ink, or worse, blood.  An 
instant later another call sends the pair screaming off to try to save 
another life.
It's Scorcese's voice we hear as one of the dispatchers, his words crisp and 
witty;  the other  dispatcher is Queen Latifah, a cleverly done piece of 
voice acting done during radio intercourse with Frank's second partner 
Marcus (Ving Rhames).
Acting in the film is outstanding.  Cage has perfected a type of spiritual 
malaise, his voice as monotonous as his expression.  What's amazing is that 
he pulls it off and keeps our interest.  After all Frank Pierce experiences 
in these fateful three days, we are still sympathetic toward his character.
Patricia Arquette is expertly made up to look like a waif with dyed hair, 
often unkempt and always delicate.  She delivers her lines perhaps more 
naturally than any other actor in the piece.  We believe her when she talks 
of her love for her estranged and dying father, and we feel sorry for her 
when she lapses into bad habits.
Ving Rhames as Marcus plays a strange hybrid, a mix of evangelical preacher 
and honey-talking ladies' man, someone out a story by Flannery O'Connor.  
Rhames switches moods as fast as the camera switches scenes, and we are 
spellbound by both.  In one crackhouse scene we see a sequence full of 
tawdriness and redemption, as Rhames takes full advantage of his director's 
predilection for religious imagery.  Look for Irving Rhames as a nominee for 
Supporting Actor.
John Goodman is also solid as support, his Larry a jaded jerk who worries 
only about his next meal.  He's looking forward to applying for captain, so 
he can stay in the business but avoid going out on actual runs.  Goodman 
convinces us without much seeming effort - and this is good because this man 
has a tendency to carry his parts over-the-top.  Tom Sizemore deserves a 
mention as Tom Walls, an unscrupulous paramedic who is not above assaulting 
his clients.  What a remarkable and amoral man he sketches here!  Finally, 
singer Marc Anthony portrays Noel, a repeat visitor to the hellish hospital, 
a friend of Mary Burke's who manages to bring out the best and worst in 
Frank.
Martin Scorcese has set himself up as a chronicler of New York, from the 
days of stuffy conventions ("The Age of Innocence") to the graphic 
unpleasantness of "Dead."  The man deserves a lot of credit for remaining 
fresh and unconventional in his techniques.
The film is only slightly less dark than Cage's Oscar-winning vehicle 
"Leaving Las Vegas."  At 118 minutes, it seems just a bit too long, though 
that results from the loosenesss of plot.  It's a must-see for serious film 
fans, especially ones interested in a most American director.

Go long enough without sleep and you don't just feel tired, you feel like 
you're in another world. Hot and cold take turns to surge through your body 
as you stagger and yawn. You mumble nonsense, speak with great clarity, then 
relapse into mumbling again. Your eyes open and close like frustrated 
curtains as you drift between alertness and snoozing. The self-destructive 
feelings are heightened if you haven't eaten, and are surviving on cigarette 
smoke, or coffee, or booze. Trust me. I have experience in this area.
Frank Pierce, the New York City ambulance driver played by Nicolas Cage in 
"Bringing Out the Dead", lives like this for weeks on end. He sees himself as 
a "grief mop", paid to bear witness to hopeless situations, and it's damaging 
him. He gets through the long days and nights on a diet of whisky, coffee and 
Marlboros, begging his boss to fire him because he hasn't got the energy to 
quit.
The film has been written by Paul Schrader and directed by Martin Scorsese, 
and has been unfairly compared to their 1976 masterpiece "Taxi Driver". Both 
pictures feature angst-ridden insomniac protagonists who look out at the 
urban jungle from uncomfortable driver's seats, and both have dizzying images 
of garish neon light. But "Taxi Driver" was about a sensitive Vietnam vet 
whose terrible experiences were turning him into a psychopath; "Bringing Out 
the Dead" follows an essentially good man who is aware and afraid of his 
impending mental collapse.
Once, of course, Frank was good at his job -- acting with skill and speed, 
relishing the satisfaction of saving peoples' lives. Now he wanders around 
like a zombie, essentially performing a taxi service for corpses and crank 
callers. He feels tormented by the ghosts of those who he failed to save, and 
sometimes hears their voices: Particularly haunting is an asthmatic 18-year 
old girl named Rose, whose death signalled the beginning of Frank's unlucky 
streak.
We follow Frank around for three days, and see him work with three other 
ambulance men: Larry (John Goodman), a family man who dreams of starting his 
own private medical service; Marcus (Ving Rhames), who calls himself a 
Christian but has a mischievous spirit; and Tom (Tom Sizemore), who can only 
be described as a nutcase. Each of these men is distinctively written and 
played, and yet, in some odd way, all three shifts seem the same. Whoever's 
in the ambulance with you, it's just another miserable day on the job.
Most of the characters that are revisited by the screenplay revolve in some 
way around Mary (Patricia Arquette), a recovering drug addict who Frank 
thinks he could fall in love with. Her father is in hospital after a heart 
attack. A crazy guy from her neighbourhood keeps putting himself in dangerous 
situations, and winding up in Frank's vehicle. And her former drug dealer is 
given some attention, too. But none of this stuff really signifies much, 
because "Bringing Out the Dead" is told from Frank's point of view, and is 
about his inability to find meaning in anything.
That's not as bleak as it sounds, because the closing shots leave us with the 
impression that Frank will eventually find some peace in his life. But it is 
exhausting, because to get the point across Schrader and Scorsese have had to 
make a two-hour film in which nothing can be seen to develop after the 
initial set-up.
And yet I recommend "Bringing Out the Dead" as a marvellous atmospheric 
achievement. Like Frank, from the opening moments we're immersed in neon 
light and bumpy automobile movements, and in such techniques as jump cuts, 
dissolves, slow-motion, fast-motion and subjective camera. Scorsese's 
instinct to employ Robert Richardson was a good one -- the cinematographer's 
juxtaposition of extreme brightness and darkness create an overpoweringly 
drowsy mood that brings us into Frank's head. Not that it's a particularly 
nice place to be, as Cage demonstrates with his amazing performance -- 
whenever we glimpse him, he's hollow-eyed, desperate, hunched over, hesitant.
There is much dark humour in this movie, arising from the absurdity of some 
of the patients' predicaments, and the twisted games we see medics engage in 
to pass the time. But it's the harsher images that stick in our minds, 
because Scorsese makes us feel like we're seeing them first-hand. John Lennon 
once sung about "a place where nothing is real... where everything flows". 
I'm sure Frank Pierce would love to go there.

"Bringing Out The Dead" opens with a title card that says "This film
takes place in New York City in the early 1990s" as if it's not evident
in the next 2 hours.  It seems unnecessary, since I doubt anyone will
mistake Scrosese's latest opus as a 2 hour episode of "ER."
It's film about 3 days in the life of Frank Pierce (Nicholas Cage), a
paramedic in Hell's Kitchen. From Martin Scorsese, we have come to
expect only the best, just like Terrence Malick, Stanley Kubrick or
Steven Spielberg.  Who set the bar for these directors?  The answer is
evident when you look at their films from the 70s and 80s. They each
did groundbreaking films that set the bar too high for
themselves. "Raging Bull" and "Taxi Driver" are considered two of the
greatest films of all time.  That's the reason "Dead" disappoints.
The first thing we hear in the film is a voice over from Frank Pierce
in an ambulance with his partner Larry (John Goodman). The opening
makes "Bringing Out The Dead" seem like a continuation of "Taxi
Driver."  There's a voiceover from our protagonist who's seeking
redemption in NY with a late night job in a mobile workplace.  He meets
a woman set to get his life back together.  Behind the scenes we have
Martin Scorsese giving Paul Schrader's (Taxi Driver) screenplay his
Midas touch. With those features, it's inevitable to have a sense of
deja vu.  One of the problems with "Bringing Out The Dead" is it tries
to play out as a dramedy.  The dramatic moments so cliched they seem
amateurish.  And the comedic elements that are present are so good, we
wonder why they're criminally underused.
The film gives Frank Pierce three partners. The first is a compulsive
overeater named Larry, played by John Goodman. Trailers, posters, ads,
none mention his name or character. Why? Maybe because he gives the
second to most lackadaisical performance in the film; it doesn't
require much range or acting chops and his segment is the worst easily
dismissable.  It doesn't have any suspense or the tension we've grown
to expect from Scorsese.
Ving Rhames has always been one of my favorite actors. He has a
slickness, a sly coolness that only he can achieve. Every one of his
roles has been great because of him.  He throws his all into each of
them and this is no exception.  The second act of "Bringing Out The
Dead" is definitely the best.  Rhames injects the film with life as
soon as he ignites on the screen.  His character Marcus is a great
contrast to Frank Pierce.  Marcus is a ladies' man whose ego is as big
as the city he lives in. A man who's also a strong believer in God.
Ving Rhames' performance alone is worth the price of admission or at
least a rental.  "Dead" is hilarious, kinetic, in a word, Scorsese-
esque.
And for its final act, the film concentrates on Cage's love interest
and his third partner, Tom Sizemore.  Tom Walls is a psycho-sociopath
and he's played to a tee by Sizemore. His exit scene is just so
sensationally idiosyncratic that I just have to give Tom his props. His
character turns the film into what it should've been in the first
place, a darkly comedic 2 hour MTV video. When he or Ving Rhames are on
the screen letting it all hang out for everyone to see, I'm watching a
good movie. When they're not on, we're left with Patrcia Arquette.
Arquette gives one of the blandest performances I've seen so far this
year. She drags down "Bringing Out The Dead" so much that it will leave
viewers tempted to leave the theatre. I suggest that they don't because
the film does have its admirable traits that should be seen.

Bringing Out the Dead (1999) 1 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Nicolas Cage,
Patricia Arquette, John Goodman, Ving Rhames and Tom Sizemore. Written by
Paul Schrader. Directed by Martin Scorsese.
 Even a mediocre Martin Scorsese film has some interesting moments.
 And a few are interspersed in "Bringing Out the Dead" another trek down
the wet, dark and dangerous streets of New York.
 Unfortunately, Scorsese has taken us down these streets before, most
notably in "Taxi Driver," to which "Bringing Out the Dead" is a distant
cousin.
 Like that earlier classic, "Bringing Out the Dead" features a protagonist
who also narrates throughout, and who, while not a Travis Bickle-like
psychopath, shows an air of disgust toward the human refuse that floats
around him.
 Frank Pierce, though, does not drive a taxi. His vehicle is an ambulance.
Pierce is an EMS paramedic. He's a burnt-out, hollowed-eye hulk of a man,
who wants to get a good night's sleep as well as chase away the ghosts of
the various people he treated but did not survive.
 The most frequent specter is that of Rose, a young woman whose death
continually haunts Frank. Every face he sees reminds him of Rose. The guilt
weighs him down like an anchor.
 One night, Frank meets Mary Burke (Patricia Arquette), a one-time junkie,
after he takes her father - who has suffered a heart attack - to the
hospital.
 He hopes by saving Mary's father that it will be his first step on the
road to redemption.
 The problem with "Bringing Out the Dead," based on the novel by Joe
Connelly and adapted by the legendary Paul Schrader, is that the story
really doesn't go anywhere.
 Cage gives a one-note performance. He merely stares out the ambulance
window with his hound-dog eyes, wishing he were anywhere but on the job.
 Arquette is no better. She merely mopes about, worrying about her father,
commenting on how she hated the man, but - because of his heart attack -
wants to make things right with him.
 As Frank's various partners, John Goodman, Ving Rhames and Tom Sizemore
are more types than real people. They are interchangeable foils for Frank's
various close encounters with the disenfranchised.
 What keeps the film  from being a total loss is some of the dark humor
Schrader has invested in the script. To keep their sanity, the paramedics
drink, beat on their ambulances, use their own drugs and sometimes beat up
on the people they are paid to save.
 These are men at the breaking point, who deal with human suffering every
day, who use any method they can devise to block out the misery surrounding
them.
 "Bringing Out the Dead" is not as vicious or depressing as "Taxi Driver."
It does offer a ray of hope and redemption. Its New York is more of a
surreal nightmare rather than the hell on earth envisioned by Travis Bickle.
 But in the end, "Bringing Out the Dead" falls flat. It lacks substance and
weight. Scorsese has given us a flashy picture show, nothing more.

Nicholas Cage is Frank Pierce, an ambulance driver in a rough area of New
York City. We follow him during three nights at work. For five years he has
been an ambulance driver, working the night shift, and it is starting to
get to him. Every night he sees the worst of human suffering and
depredation, trying to save the lives of assorted slum-dwellers,
drug-addicts and victims of gang-shootings. Professional detachment is
getting harder and harder to maintain. What makes the job worthwile is the
feeling he gets after saving a life. It makes him feel like God. But now,
he hasn't saved anyone in months, and he's getting to the point where he
tries to avoid calls, so he won't have to face losing another patient. He
is also haunted by the memory of one particular girl that he couldn't save,
and has started to see her face in people around him. A nervous breakdown
seems imminent, and Frank knows it, but he can't seem to get away from the
job. 
Onto the scene comes Mary Burke (Patricia Arquette), whose father is being
kept artificially alive in hospital after being initially kept alive by
Frank. Frank is attracted to her, but he is also troubled as to her father,
who goes into cardiac arrest several times a day - is it right to keep him
artificially alive? 
Every night he is partnered with a different co-worker (John Goodman, Ving
Rhames and Tom Sizemore). They can tell he is on the edge, but they
themselves range from the wildly eccentric to the barking mad. If only he
could save a life again, maybe the ghosts would go away...
The New York of this movie is a bleak place. The streets are lined with
prostitutes and homeless people, the buildings are sometimes practically
ruins and the hospital is overcrowded, underequipped and understaffed. The
gloom is not alleviated by the fact that practically all the scenes take
place at night. It is not a pleasant movie to watch. But, of course, it's
not supposed to be. Nicholas Cage is well suited for the part of the
burnt-out ambulance driver. He is good at displaying Frank's caring for his
patients, and at the same time his general exhaustedness. Other members of
the cast are also good, special mention goes to Cliff Curtis in the role of
a super-cool drug-dealer. 
A possible minus about the film is a certain lack of purpose - there is not
really a clear cut storyline, the whole thing comes across more like a
series of snapshots. Obviously this could be a completely valid way of
making a film - not all films need clear cut storylines - but I think this
films ends up as something a bit undecided. There is a storyline in there,
among all the snapshots, but it can be difficult to see among all the other
things that are going on, and so it can be difficult to find out what
exactly the movie wants to bring across. All in all though, I would say the
end-result is quite good. It is certainly difficult to remain unaffected -
and that is always a good sign in a film.
Who should see this film: People who want to see a good film, and are
prepared not to come out of the cinema smiling. Europeans who want
confirmation of their belief that the USA is, socially, a third-world
country.

On Martin Scorsese's Bringing Out the Dead'
USA, 1999, 188 min. 
Direction: Martin Scorsese
With: Nicolas Cage, Patricia Arquette, John Goodman, Ving Rhames, Tom
Sizemore, Marc Anthony (I)
With  Bringing Out the Dead', Martin Scorsese returns to his native
city New York once again.  The movie features Frank Pierce (Nicolas
Cage), a paramedic working in Gotham's Hell's Kitchen.  "Saving a
life," Frank tells us, "is like falling in love." But Frank has not
saved a life for months. Instead, his waking dreams are haunted by the
image of Rose, a young woman who died while under his care.  When he
finally does succeed in saving the life of a heart patient, the man
needs to be kept alive through repeated shocks with the defibrillator.
With each shock, however, his daughter, Mary (played by Cage's wife
Patricia Arquette) freaks out. To Frank, it is a dilemma representing
many others.  Accompanied by the dead Rose and the living Mary, he
embarks on a three day journey closely reminiscent of Louis-Ferdinand
Céline's novel Journey to the End of the Night', brimming with
dreams, horrors, jokes, hallucinations and revelations.
Core
Hosting such early films as Mean Streets' (1973) and Taxi Driver'
(1976), the city of New York has been a major influence on Scorsese's
movie-making career, as it continues to be with next year's staging of
Gangs of New York' (starring Leonardo DiCaprio). Outside this
autobiographical core, Scorsese's body of work becomes as vastly
versatile as that of Stanley Kubrick, who seems to have lacked such a
core altogether.  But watching Eyes Wide Shut', who would not wish
Scorsese had taken charge of those nightly New York scenes?
Scorsese's empathic understanding of New York is unsurpassed by any
other film maker (with the exception, perhaps, of the incomparable
Woody Allen).  His crack-dealers and hookers, graffiti and garbage are
not the stage props that we are used to seeing in any old action flick
or police show.  In Scorsese's films, they represent a grim and
inescapable reality.  No one can make you feel unsafe in your seat the
way he can.  Scorsese knows at exactly what moment you should cross a
New York street when you see someone coming your way you don't fully
trust.
Of course, a neighborhood like Hell's Kitchen provides the perfect
setting for Scorsese's appropriated Catholic themes of sin, conscience
and redemption.  Frank's co-workers can hardly be distinguished from
the world in which they are taking charge.  Indeed, their indifference
and cynicism serve as a lubricant to make life 'easy'.  In the case of
Ving Rhames' character, the cynicism even transforms into an elated,
but superficial and campy religious posture.  Frank, by contrast, has
not yet resigned himself to a life that would have the better of him.
While he is not too rigid to not mingle with characters of suspicious
reputation, he refuses to have the world decide on him that easy.  It
is a trait that brings him on the verge of physical and mental
devastation, and it seems to be Scorsese's message that one can only
hold on to oneself under compromising circumstances if one is prepared
to make an effort.
Catharsis
However, an effort can be made in different ways.  Over the years,
Scorsese has increasingly shifted the emphasis from an outer to an
inner arena.  In Taxi driver', that archetypical movie, Travis Bickle
(De Niro) sought redemption by confronting the visible world; the
young hooker played by Jodie Foster served merely as a welcome
focusing point for Travis' sense of righteousness, never as the object
of any genuine interest.  In Bringing Out the Dead', written by Paul
Schrader (who also signed for Scorsese's The last temptation of
Christ', Raging Bull' and Casino') this detour is no longer
followed.  Rather, Frank Pierce goes through an inner catharsis, one
that does involve Mary up to a point, but without ever turning into a
love affair, for which neither of them seem to find the time or the
space.  Perhaps their relationship can best be described as an
anti-romance.
To illustrate, Scorsese provided his movie with plenty of Catholic
symbolism.  Starting with the cross on the filmposter - in which the
international Red Cross should not be overlooked - there is the
hospital's name of St Mary's, Patricia Arquette's character's name is
Mary, there are hands that are repeatedly being washed and, to top
everything, there is a man whose side is being pierced.  But the true
modern-day Savior is none other than Frank himself, who not only heals
the sick but also saves souls, as is shown in a dream sequence that
expresses the title of the movie quite explicitly.
Dramatic
With his characters portraying principles rather than themselves,
Scorsese seems to be more interested in themes than in people.  Of
course, the script does not owe its dramatic power to any moral
content, but, rather, to the transformation that this moral conflict
brings about in Frank and Mary.  There is no guarantee as to the
outcome of their purification process, just the certainty that they
have no choice but to go on.  "You promised to fire me," Frank yells
out to his employer, half in jest, half in despair.  "I'll fire you
tomorrow, I promise," the man answers.  In Hell's Kitchen, he doesn't
have much of a choice either.
Although all the ingredients seem to be present, Bringing Out the
Dead' is not as frightening as Taxi Driver' or Cape Fear', nor is it
as violent as Goodfellas' or Casino'.  Fans of those features may be
disappointed by Bringing Out the Dead' and they may say that Scorsese
has begun to repeat himself.  That is hardly the case.  Bringing Out
the Dead' simply comprises another step in a development of which the
end is not yet in sight.  Already, Scorsese's mastery has reached
beyond the mere exotic, be it in form (After Hours') or content
(Kundun').   It has made him examine and question the validity of
moral values (particularly in Cape Fear' and The Last temptation of
Christ'). By using his art as a means of formulating questions, rather
than using answers' to make some kind of art', his importance as a
film director exceeds the realm of the strictly artistic.  His films
contribute to a more sophisticated understanding of this world in
general.  In that sense, Bringing Out the Dead' can be thought of as
a homecoming after a journey that simply could not leave his own New
York untouched.
Besides, the true Scorsese fan still has a lot of good stuff to enjoy.
It must not have been easy to come up with visual solutions within the
limits of an ambulance, but no one knows better how to charge his
shots with meaning and emotional power than this master of
cinematography.  Nicolas Cage, without being superficial, may not have
the power of expression that Robert de Niro has, but his held-back,
serious and seemingly unmoved style of acting fits Franks introvert
personality perfectly.
Finally, the movie's soundtrack brings forth an aspect of movie-making
that usually remains underexposed.  Scorsese, now 57, knows the
repertoire: he plays old and new rockmusic, thus passing the
atmosphere of the hybrid '90s accurately on to the movie.  Meanwhile,
the raw voices of the various performers perfectly express Franks
attempts to elicit something humane from a world that has gone adrift
around him.

Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.
     If the opening minutes of BRINGING OUT THE DEAD start to look very
familiar, you're not alone -- even Martin Scorsese agrees with you. The
story opens "in the early 1990s" with EMS paramedic Frank Pierce (Nicolas
Cage) beginning the first of three consecutive chaotic shifts, and at the
end of his rope. His night shifts cruising the streets of New York City
are filtered through red lights; his voiceover narration, scripted by Paul
Schrader (from Joe Connelly's novel), reveals a soul in turmoil. Fueled
only by alcohol and coffee, haunted by the image of a girl he couldn't
save, Frank is ready to snap. "There's a correlation to TAXI DRIVER, 
there's no doubt," Scorsese comments in the press notes, which admission
can only inspire a sarcastic, "No, really?" For a while, you suspect the
film should be called AMBULANCE DRIVER.
     Scorsese ultimately takes BRINGING OUT THE DEAD somewhere quite
different, which is both a blessing and a disappointment. Much of the film
is spent on the day-to-day -- or, in this case, night-to-night -- life of
the paramedics, and on that level it's often fascinating and brutally
hilarious. Frank's three riding partners provide a variety of perspectives
on the way people respond to the stresses of the occupation. Larry (John
Goodman) remains distant, focused either on his next meal or the private
medical response company he plans to open some day; Marcus (Ving Rhames) 
turns emergency calls into opportunities to do a little of the Lord's
work, notably in a wonderful scene where he a resuscitation in a Goth
nightclub becomes an impromptu tent revival meeting; Tom Walls (Tom
Sizemore) turns into a wild animal ready to beat the hell out of his truck
or a frustrating patient, whichever happens to be at hand. Even the trips
into the Our Lady of Perpetual Mercy emergency room -- a barely-controlled
bedlam that would send even the "ER" cast screaming for the hills -- pound
home the nightmare of the job. When Scorsese and cinematographer Robert
Richardson keep their eyes trained on the kinetic, frenetic world of
Pierce and his cohorts, BRINGING OUT THE DEAD has the darkly comic vibe of
M*A*S*H, providing entertaining (if occasionally unnerving) insight into a
violent world where the only sane response is to go a little insane.
     There is, however, a backbone to this story, if not an exceptionally
strong one. BRINGING OUT THE DEAD is ultimately a redemption tale, in
which Frank longs to escape from the feeling that every call is hopeless,
and that he no longer has the power to save anyone. Much of that story
focuses on his relationship with Mary (Patricia Arquette), a woman whose
father Frank revives after a cardiac arrest. Frank becomes obsessed with
Mary, rescuing her from a relapse into drug use and becoming her personal
liaison on her father's condition. His relationship with Mary should shine
a narrative light into his soul, yet Frank's personal crisis never becomes
nearly as vivid as the world in which he exists. Cage delivers a
performance that is alternately wild-eyed and catatonic, a frustrating
pastiche of previous Cage roles instead of a distinct character of its
own. The moments when Frank isn't on the job, when he's trying to find
some semblance of peace and normalcy, should be BRINGING OUT THE DEAD's
emotional anchor. More often, they leave you wondering when someone's
going to get back in an ambulance so the real action can continue.
     Scorsese and Schrader really miss the mark in the film's final
minutes, when Frank's epiphany becomes a depressingly obvious combination
of Glinda-the-Good-Witch dialogue and purifying white light. It's all well
and good that Scorsese and Shrader claim they've "a little mellower now," 
and that 25 years after TAXI DRIVER they've opted for something a bit less
bleakly pessimistic. The 1999 model Travis Bickle didn't necessarily need
to be an armed sociopath, but his actions still needed to draw us into the
way one man deals with New York's grim underworld. There's plenty of
visual gusto to BRINGING OUT THE DEAD, and there are plenty of wildly
entertaining episodes to keep you watching. It's just hard not to wish for
a personality half as intensely memorable as Bickle to pull it all
together. Whenever Frank's introspections take center stage, you need to
keep rousing yourself to ask, "Are you talkin' to me?"

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
During the first few minutes of Martin Scorsese's Bringing Out the Dead,
you can't help thinking about the director's 1976 masterpiece Taxi
Driver.  The main character narrates the film from his job of driving
through the streets of New York City to music eerily similar to Bernard
Herrmann's Oscar-nominated score.  Although we are told that Dead is set
in the early 1990s, it becomes clear pretty quickly that not much has
changed in New York since 1976.
Nicolas Cage (8mm) stars as Frank Pierce, an Emergency Medical Services
driver from Our Lady of Perpetual Mercy Hospital (or `Misery,' for
short) in Hell's Kitchen.  He's an insomniac and an alcoholic, a man
that has clearly lost his way since failing to save an asthmatic
16-year-old girl six months ago.  Everywhere he turns, Frank sees the
dead teen and hears her ask why he didn't rescue her.  Subsequently,
Frank has lost each of his patients since then and is desperate to find
a soul to save.  He admits that his role is `less about saving lives
than about bearing witness.'  He's probably a blast at parties.
At first, Frank is paired with Larry (John Goodman, The Big Lebowski), a
goofy ox that seems more concerned with his next meal than his next
patient.  After receiving a call from Dispatch (the voice is
Scorsese's), the two lackadaisically trudge up to the top floor of an
apartment building where an elderly man has suffered a severe heart
attack.  The man is clearly dead when they arrive, and Larry uses the
phone to call a doctor in order to get an official pronouncement of
death.  Frank continues to perform lifesaving techniques and is
eventually able to get a pulse.  It is here that Frank meets Mary Burke
(Patricia Arquette, Stigmata), the old man's comely daughter.
Frank and Larry drive the victim to Misery, and as they open its
emergency room doors they reveal an ER from hell.  There are more freaks
there than at a Jeff Foxworthy family reunion.  And it's not just the
cases  a crazy security guard threatens people trying to get help and a
nurse asks people to leave and die in another city.  Misery is on
diversion and refusing new admissions because of a rash of overdoses
resulting from a new street drug called Red Death.  But doctors
reluctantly agree to take the elderly patient from Frank and Larry.
The next night, Frank is paired with Marcus (Ving Rhames, Entrapment), a
religious man that tries in vain to pick up the female dispatcher (the
voice of Queen Latifah).  Marcus has a considerably more upbeat outlook
on life and tells Frank, `Help someone and you help yourself.'  The
problem is that Frank can't find anyone to help and hasn't been able to
for quite a while.  This line also evokes Taxi Driver's Wizard (Peter
Boyle) telling his co-worker Travis Bickle `You get a job. You become
the job.'  Their evening's shift is complete after witnessing the birth
of an Immaculate Conception and a resurrection.
As Frank drives around the depravity of New York's nighttime streets,
more of Taxi Driver's lines come to mind. `Someday a real rain will come
and wipe this scum off the streets.' `I think someone should just take
this city and just flush it down the f'in' toilet.'  And, probably most
fitting for our crazy insomniac, `The days go on and on.  They don't
end.  All my life needed was a sense of someplace to go. I don't believe
that one should devote his life to morbid self-attention; I believe that
one should become a person like other people.'
We slowly learn that Frank isn't much different than the junkies and
wackos he is supposed to be helping.  One schizophrenic man named Noel
(Marc Anthony, Big Night) wants to die but can't muster the courage to
off himself.  Like Noel, Frank wants to be fired from his job, but can't
quite quit on his own and resorts to frequently coming in late and
calling in sick in hopes of getting the boot.  Ultimately, in an ironic
turn, Frank is finally able to help someone, but his services are
rendered in a less-than-routine fashion.  The whole story takes place
over a span of three days.
Although Dead looks more like an Oliver Stone flick, comparisons to Taxi
Driver shouldn't come as a surprise.  Screenwriter Paul Schrader also
worked on Scorsese's Raging Bull and The Last Temptation of Christ in
addition to Taxi Driver.  He adapted this script from the 1998 Joe
Connelly novel of the same name (Connelly was actually a medic for nine
years in New York).  Dead looks great and is brightly lensed by Robert
Richardson (The Horse Whisperer), with Scorsese's regular editor (Thelma
Schoonmaker) and production designer (Dante Ferretti) adding to the
fantastic appearance.  But the film is very uneven and leads Cage and
Arquette are really bad actors.  It seems like Cage is getting all of
the roles that Bruce Willis used to take, as he continues to demonstrate
that his Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas was a big fluke.  I think a movie
about Marcus or psycho ambulance driver Tom Walls (Tom Sizemore, Saving
Private Ryan) would have been more interesting.

It's quite appropriate that world-class filmmaker Martin Scorsese and 
screenwriter Paul Schrader have teamed up once more after their critically 
lauded work in such films as 1976's "Taxi Driver" and 1980's "Raging Bull," 
because "Bringing Out the Dead" is Scorsese's most impressive, dramatically 
sound piece of celluloid in at least the last seven years. Grim, 
unrelentingly downbeat, yet fascinating and thought-provoking, the film is 
one of those rare big-budget efforts that doesn't have a plot hook or a 
flashy storyline to bring in audiences, which is unfortunate. Instead, most 
of the major developments occur within the central character, as he struggles 
to find meaning and resolution in a life that often seems too depressing to 
bear.
Frank Pierce (Nicolas Cage) is a worn-out ambulance driver working the 
graveyard shift on the mean streets of New York City. Night after 
discouraging night, Frank is paired up with a coworker to drive around with, 
picking up calls on their CBs, and traveling to assist people who are either 
fatally ill or hurt, or too far gone down their own paths of destruction to 
be helped. Constantly transporting patients to Our Lady of Perpetual Mercy 
hospital, which is always so jam-packed that many patients are usually left 
unattended, Frank, in narration, tells us about how he can't even remember 
the last time he saved another person's life. A sign that maybe he should 
quit his job before he goes completely crazy, he has begun to see the image 
of Rose, a deceased 18-year-old girl he failed to save, who solemnly asks 
him, "Why did you kill me, Frank?" 
Set over the period of exactly three days on the job, the first night Frank 
is paired up with Larry (John Goodman), an obese, somewhat unhappy 
foodaholic. One of their first calls is to save an older man who has 
collapsed on the floor and gone into cardiac arrest. Acquiring a faint pulse, 
he is taken to the hospital, but with little hope of pulling through. This is 
where he meets Mary Burke (Patricia Arquette), the grown daughter of the man, 
who starts to hang around the hospital, praying her father will survive just 
so she can make amends with him (they haven't spoken in a few years). Over 
the following two nights, in which Frank is paired with the happy-go-lucky, 
preacher-imitating Marcus (Ving Rhames) and the loudmouthed Walls (Tom 
Sizemore), he forms a sort of infatuation with Mary and attempts to get close 
to her. This is not, however, the starting point for a blossoming romance, as 
it becomes clear what Frank and Mary need is each other, but more to come to 
terms with themselves and their own personal demons.
Motion pictures about a person's own redemption have been on the resurgence 
as of late, most recently in the devastatingly profound "American Beauty" and 
the promising, but ultimately uneven "Fight Club," and "Bringing Out the 
Dead" belongs with the former movie in successfully telling the story of a 
man basically at the crossroads of his life who wonders what the point of it 
all is. Films concerning one's redemption is a tricky subject that must be 
told with utmost care and subtlety, so as to not make it cornball, and in 
"Bringing Out the Dead," we are put directly in the life of Frank Pierce, a 
memorably likable creation who may not be as unforgettable or stirring as 
that of Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) in "Taxi Driver," but who could be?
Quick-paced, but still satisfyingly dedicating time to the characters at 
hand, the film is comparable to a rollercoaster ride through the job of an 
ambulance driver, with the camera often moving at a furious, off-kilter rate, 
and the film speed increased so as to parallel the way life passes you by. 
Cinematographer Robert Richardson ably handles the feat, and aiding it along 
is the rock soundtrack that is a strangely appropriate and stylistically 
brilliant. When the camera does stop for a breather, we get elongated, 
important takes that try to capture human nature, none more so than in a 
marvelous scene where Frank and Mary are sitting beside each other in the 
back of an ambulance, played to the enlightening song by 10,000 Maniacs, 
"These Are Days." 
In the crucial role of Frank Pierce, Nicolas Cage has returned to the type of 
challenging roles he was taking in the mid-'90s, such as his Oscar-winning 
work in 1995's "Leaving Las Vegas." Choosing to work with a master such as 
Martin Scorsese (whose voice, along with that of Queen Latifah's, show up in 
cameos) was one of the best career moves Cage could have made, and his Frank 
is a man filled with interior conflict that we learn through his personality 
and ponderous narration. 
As his three main coworkers, John Goodman, Ving Rhames, and Tom Sizemore all 
show up for about a thirty-minute stretch each, and leave lasting impressions 
on the viewer, particularly Goodman, whose character of Larry, we sense, has 
more going on underneath than meets the eye. Additionally, Latino pop singer 
Marc Anthony shows up in a crucial supporting role and is outstanding as 
Noel, a repeat offender who gets himself into trouble on a daily basis, 
stemming from a hard drug he once took that left his mind altered.
The heart and soul of the film lies on Mary Burke, an ex-junkie who has 
straightened her life out in the last year and now wishes to rekindle her 
relationship with her father before he dies. Mary is played by Patricia 
Arquette, Cage's wife and an underrated actress in her own right, who gives a 
powerful, quietly shattering performance that is so much deeper on every 
level than in her other current film, "Stigmata." Arquette and Cage, who are 
working together for the first time, turn out to have a great deal more 
chemistry than expected, and even when you feel as if their relationship may 
not be one with romance, but simply compassion for each other, you find 
yourself desperately hoping for them to get together.
"Bringing Out the Dead" is a highly assured, meditative look on the fragility 
of life, and it also acts as both an intriguing guide into the profession of 
ambulance drivers, as well as the atmosphere within the walls of a hospital, 
which, from secondhand experience, is realistic in almost every one of its 
details. Returning to his New York roots after several years, Scorsese is 
near the top of his game, as he has crafted a truly powerful, delicately 
balanced motion picture of both real poignancy and humor. "Bringing Out the 
Dead" may not have the wide commercial prospects of, let's say, Cage's 
haphazard, but financially successful, 1997 action product, "Con Air," but is 
a remarkably superior creation. It's not too often that a film this 
innovative and emotionally gratifying is made, and it should be embraced.

Twenty-three years after dropping the ultimate ode to loners everywhere onto
the world, TAXI DRIVER (9/10), director Martin Scorsese re-teams with TAXI's
screenwriter, Paul Schrader, to revisit the filth and grime of New York's
city streets. This time, the protagonist is an after hours ambulance
driver/paramedic, who finds himself haunted by patients lost and distraught
over the continued hopelessness of his situation.
PLOT:
A stressed-out ambulance medic finds himself haunted by the ghosts of people
whose lives he was not able to save during his fast-paced graveyard shifts.
The film takes place over a period of 48 hours in which the man essentially
moves from one emergency situation to another.
CRITIQUE:
Think a softer, kinder, less psychotic, and much longer TAXI DRIVER! This
underlying story behind this film is no different than many others that you
have already seen. A man obsessed by the mistakes from his past, feels
guilty and attempts to finds redemption in his present state. Much like TAXI
DRIVER, the man in this case drowns himself in drink, finds little time to
sleep and gets fixated on "saving" a girl. Much unlike TAXI DRIVER, this
film doesn't have much depth, doesn't carry broad political or social
connotations, and does not feature an actor completely engrossed in his
character. Don't get me wrong, I thought Cage did a good job as the
burnt-out, over-worked stressball, but nothing could really compare to
DeNiro's possession of Travis Bickle. But I suppose that's another review
altogether. All in all, I thought this was actually a pretty good movie with
some good performances from the leads, and some even better showings from
supporting characters such as Marc Anthony, Ving Rhames, Tom Sizemore and
the drug dealer, Cliff Curtis.
The story itself is not necessarily overpowering, in fact, it basically just
moves along its path, predictably strolling down certain emotional avenues,
until its final resting spot at the conclusion, which we all foresee early
on. Repetitive it is as well, with the basic story essentially featuring
Cage et buddy flying from one crisis scene to the next. Thankfully for us,
director Martin Scorsese looked waaaay down into his visual bag o' tricks
and came up with many new and unique camera games with which to amuse us
during the film's two hour runtime. A runtime which basically outlasts its
visit by about 20 minutes or so. You can actually feel the last half hour go
by, as opposed to the general rapid pace of the first hour and a half. For
Martin Scorsese fans, this one should be seen if only for its excellent
stylish demonstrations. Cage fans should also check it out as he basically
reverts back to his pre-action star days, a la LEAVING LAS VEGAS (9/10),
when he actually did some interesting work as an actor. But for everyone
else, I can't say that this will be a film that will draw you in with its
meaningful story or original undertones. If you enjoy new ways of shooting
film or creating motion across a movie arc, then you might also want to see
this flick, but overall, I wouldn't recommend it to your "basic movie-going
audience". Scorsese and style fans only! Now don't make me take off my
glasses!!
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Director Martin Scorsese recently got married for the 5th time, a lengthy
laundry list which has included such luminaries as actress/model Isabella
Rossellini and producer of many of Marty's films (including this one),
Barbara DeFina. He also heavily dated actress Illeana Douglas for a few
years. He was once offered the opportunity to direct SCHINDLER'S LIST in the
mid-1980's, but declined because he didn't think that he could make as good
a film as a Jewish director possibly could. Steven Spielberg went on to
direct the film and won the 1993 Oscar for Best Director, an award that
Martin Scorsese has never won.
Writer Paul Schrader has been married to actress Mary Beth Hurt since 1983.
She has a small role in this film as Nurse Contance.
Interesting to note that two famous people take credit for the dispatch
voices which you, along with Cage and his ambulance driving co-hort, hear
during the film's constant calls for emergency action. The male voice is
none other than the director himself, Martin Scorsese, while the female
voice is actor/rapper Queen Latifah.
Actor Marc Anthony, who plays Noel in this film, is actually a very famous
Latin singer, who most recently released his first full-length English
album. He also sings a duet on fellow Latin singer/actor Jennifer Lopez's
debut album.
This is the fourth film collaboration between writer Paul Schrader and
director Martin Scorsese, with TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL, THE LAST
TEMPATATION OF CHRIST, being the previous three.
This film is based on the similarly titled novel by Joe Connelly.

Susan Granger's review of "BRINGING OUT THE DEAD" (Paramount Pictures)
 Martin Scorsese is one of our most respected auteurs but this
hollow melodrama is a major misfire. Marking the fourth collaboration
between Scorsese and writer Paul Schrader, it's an adaptation of Joe
Connelly's novel about the rescues and failures of a New York City
paramedic. Nicolas Cage plays a tormented EMS worker on the graveyard
shift in Hell's Kitchen who, in a week of full moons, is so
sleep-deprived that he wants nothing more than to be fired. Subsisting
on whiskey and cigarettes with an occasional pizza, he's a hyperactive
adrenaline-junkie, spiked by the surreal filth and loathing that
surround him and haunted by the face of an underage girl named Rose
whom he once failed to rescue. One night, this burnt-out wannabe hero
punches life back into the cardiac arrested chest of Mr. Burke, while
striking up a relationship with the man's estranged, ex-junkie
daughter, Patricia Arquette (Cage's real-life wife). As opposed to a
plot, the film consists of aimless, loosely connected episodes
narrated by Cage, working with a series of wacko partners. There's
John Goodman, who's resigned to holding on to his sanity amidst the
blood, pain, and despair; Tom Sizemore, who's heavily into violence
against the parasites of humanity; and Ving Rhames, who fancies
himself infused with the Holy Spirit. The camera technique is tricky,
the pace frantic, and the sound track filled with pop music with a
thumping bass. The eccentric characters say weird things which may
relate to guilt and redemption but that's not too clear. And there's a
crazy "Isn't-this-cool?" attitude when you realize that Scorsese
voices the ambulance dispatcher. But that's it. Nothing more. On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Bringing Out the Dead" is a chaotic,
wretched, frenzied 3. It's so cool, it's stone cold.

BRINGING OUT THE DEAD (director: Martin Scorsese; screenwriter: Paul
Schrader, based on the novel by Joe Connelly; cinematographer: Robert
Richardson; cast: Nicolas Cage (Frank Pierce), Patricia Arquette (Mary
Burke), John Goodman (Larry), Ving Rhames (Marcus), Tom Sizemore (Tom),
Marc Anthony (Noel), Cliff Curtis (Cy Coates), Mary Beth Hurt (Nurse
Constance), Aida Turturro (Nurse Crupp), 1999)
Bringing Out The Dead, in one sense, is a love/hate black comedy about
the relationship the director Martin Scorsese has with his home turf of
NYC in the early 1990s and, in the other sense, it is a psychological
study about those who are trying to save the sick in a dying city when
they can't be sure if they can even save themselves. Frank Pierce (Cage)
is a burnt out paramedic who has gone on one too many missions of mercy,
thinking that he needs just one last save to regain his equilibrium. He
now sees the ghosts of those he couldn't save everywhere he looks. The
conflict inside him revolves around the tremendous high he gets over
saving a life- there is no better feeling, he tells us in a voiceover,
his usual way of conveying to the viewer what he is thinking- and the
low point is from all the depravity and hopelessness and horror he sees
all around him everyday.
His ambulance route is in the neighborhood of his birth, Hell's Kitchen,
though his family moved upstate when he was of high school age, as so
many others have previously done to remove themselves from the besetment
of drugs and despair and crime that has taken over the streets in that
once mostly Irish enclave.
His ambulance buzzes past the unnatural everyday sights of the city: of
hookers working the streets (one of them who is pregnant), children drug
dealers, the homeless, smelly drunks, and a frightening look at how the
have-nots live in a city of morbid neon lights and graffiti hi-riser
buildings. These images become a reminder of what hell might look like.
There is the ghost of one patient that Frank lost recently, a young
homeless woman named Rose, that he keeps seeing over and over again,
causing him to be severely depressed, to suffer from insomnia, to not
eat properly, and to hit the bottle. That he is stressed out, should
come as no surprise, his job might very well be the most stressful one
in the city. So who could blame him if he reports late to work and uses
up all his sick days and can't get fired even though he wants to, all
because the city needs his body out there, and his downfall is not that
uncommon for a job like his, anyway.
Scorsese emphasizes how tormenting this job is, by following the
ambulance driver around for three painful night shifts through the
glittering lights of Manhattan, each night Frank is with a different
partner and with each, there is a different outlook on the job
exhibited. That in a nutshell is the plot of the film, as this is a
story mostly about character development and the unique personalities of
those who choose to work under such trying conditions, and of the
uncertain relationship that develops between two kindred spirits, Mary
and Frank. The audience is taken along for the grim ride and the
entertainment comes from the constant gallows humor of these very
obsessively comedic EMS men, who provide the necessary breaks in the
story for everyone concerned, that is audience and driver alike. Things
are so insane that if you don't laugh, you can succumb to the intensity
of the situation by just watching it. How insane the situation is, is
highlighted from the first radio dispatch heard in the background, where
the call is to help a woman in distress because a roach crawled in her
ear. This is a dark comedy in the real sense of being dark, with the
noir style to the film provided by Scorsese's frequent screenwriter,
Paul Schrader (Taxi Driver/Raging Bull/The Last Temptation of Christ).
The hospital that is on his route, a place of bedlam and futility, is
named Our Lady of Perpetual Mercy, but called by the EMS personnel,
"Misery," and for good reason. This is a place where there aren't enough
beds to handle all the victims from gunshots and heart attacks and bad
drug trips. The doctors work relentlessly on double shifts, and the
atmosphere is frighteningly horrific, with wild screams, patients tied
to their beds so that they wouldn't go on a rampage, and utter chaos in
the lobby, where security guards menacingly try to keep order.
The first call that Frank goes out on, is with Larry (Goodman), his
chatty and obese partner, enamored by fast-food places and concerned
about not eating the same meal twice in one week, who is planning to
soon be in the suburbs running his own private ambulance service.
They respond to a heart attack victim in a walk-up tenement building,
where the victim has been dead for a few minutes and the family is
bewilderedly huddled around their patriarch, hoping for a miracle.
Frank, who is considered to be the best at saving lives, has been
working as a paramedic for the past five years. This could be the rescue
he needs, as he desperately tries to save the old man's life by giving
him CPR and shocks to the heart in order to bring back his patient from
the dead. As a last resort, he puts on a Sinatra album the old man
liked. This seems to give the patient a pulse and the family some hope.
The patient's anxious daughter, the former junkie, Mary Burke (Patricia
Arquette), who is the actual wife of Cage, forms a bond of friendship
instantly with Frank, who will act as a liaison for her to pass on
information about her father from the hospital. They will meet together
for the next three nights in the chaos of the hospital where her father
is just one of many emergencies handled during the night's graveyard
shift, and their ambiguous relationship will center around the reports
Frank gives her on the condition of her father.
Frank feels Mary's pain and wants her love or approval; he desperately
is in need of a woman to comfort him, just like she needs his moral
support-- he looks like a priest to her. We know very little about
Frank's personal life except what little he tells us in the voiceover
about his divorce, but he doesn't tell us why his wife left him, nor do
we see where he lives, or who his friends are, or what his interests are
other than the job, which seems to be his whole life. The few times we
see him out of uniform in civilian clothes, he looks ordinary. In
uniform he looks like a God.
His second partner is the hilarious loud-mouth, Marcus (Ving Rhames),
who is a mixture of playboy, gin drinking rogue and Jesus fanatic, with
a devastating sense of humor. Marcus' hope is that God will see to it
that he gets through the night. Their night out results in them treating
a drug overdosed punk rocker who took a deadly new drug on the scene
called "red poison," and of Marcus speeding recklessly to another call,
which results in the ambulance overturning, leaving them both with minor
injuries and lots of nervous laughter over their narrow escape from
death.
The partners seem to be getting more intense with each night shift, as
the third driver, Tom (Sizemore) points out, that the full moon is out
and it is Saturday, as he gleefully rubs his hands together expecting
plenty of action. Tom is the forceful type; he likes to take matters
into his own hands. On his shift the two most memorable things that
happen are a drug shootout in an apartment building, where one victim is
dying from gunshot wounds and the other is impaled on the terrace gate
(Cliff Curtis), as he jumped from the 16th floor to the 14th to escape
his fate. As a coincidence, he gave Frank some kind of a stress
relieving pill the previous night, which Frank took in a moment of
weakness and desperation, as he followed Mary to this drug pad,
concerned that she couldn't handle the strain any longer of learning
about her father's death, especially when she wasn't able to put a
closure on their stormy relationship by having one last chance to talk
to him (she hasn't even seen her father for the last three years due to
an argument). Her father is someone that Frank actually saved and the
hospital might have been able to keep him alive, but Frank thought he
heard the man's voice telling him he didn't want to live anymore, and so
he failed to give him the necessary shocks to keep him alive. The other
major incident on this shift, was the violent reaction of Tom to the
deranged Noel (Marc Anthony), who is completely wasted on drugs and is
known to the paramedics as a very troubled man. He should have been
placed in a mental institution if this was a civilized city, but who now
wanders the street taking a baseball bat and knocking out car windows
with it. Tom's way of handling him, is to teach him a lesson with a
beating, while Frank's approach is to identify with his insanity and try
to communicate as best he can with him.
It becomes apparent that Frank is going bonkers, while the other drivers
are handling the job much better than he is: they are getting by (Larry
by dreaming of better days to come, Marcus by finding God, and Tom by
taking things into his own hands). It is just Frank who is falling
completely apart, thinking he must save someone in order for him to be
redeemed. He is especially upset because over the last few months
everyone seems to be dying on him. Mary now becomes his only hope. He
must either save her from becoming an addict again or she must save him
from his ghost-like existence. Mary is likened in his eyes to the Virgin
Mary, as the kind of relationship that forms between the two is a
difficult one to apprehend, as they are both caught by their own demons
and are so afraid of love and of not being loved, and they are afraid
that the tenderness they have for others might drain them and leave them
without enough energy for them to save themselves. This all leads up to
the film's final shot, where he becomes like the son in a religious
painting of Christ, resting after a long journey in the arms of the holy
mother, cuddled up next to her in the bright whiteness of a spiritual
light. Could that be his salvation, a spiritual one, the only hope there
is for Frank?
By the time the third night shift ends, the audience is strained and
left overwhelmed by all the noise from the city streets, the background
rock music, the depravity of the hospital, the constant frenetic chatter
of the paramedics, and the need for them to have some artificial way to
get by their shift. Frank's way is through coffee, whiskey, vitamin
shots, and living with ghosts-- and none of them work. This film is
intense all right, and it drags on for much too long a look at the
insane world it envisions, making its way through a grotesque looking
city and a hospital that is likened to a crazy house.
The misery uncovered is catching, like certain diseases are. But is it
worth it? Does the film have something salient to say, as Scorsese seems
more comfortable in these surroundings than he did in the foreign turf
of The Age of Innocence and Kundun, for instance? Is there entertainment
value in this story? That I really don't know, but I do know that it all
seemed too real and that the acting was superb, one couldn't help but
get entangled in the lives of the characters, and there was a rush of
adrenaline emanating from the highs and even the lows experienced. The
Nicolas Cage performance caught the nuances of his character in a
bewitching manner, as in his crazed EMS role, he catches the futility
and desperation he feels gnawing at him from inside and displays an
engaging chemistry with the three drivers and with Patricia Arquette.
Though, her performance seemed to be too coy at times and too
conveniently vulnerable to be totally credible, she nevertheless is the
perfect counterpoint to his tortured being, sharing with him all the
anguish of living, and leaving him with the uncertainty of how she feels
about him romantically. The ambulance drivers more or less drove home
the philosophical points of the film, as they acted out the insanity of
the situation they were in and complemented his mood swings of being
beaten down or hyper, with the sheer madness of their gall and sometimes
perversive attitude toward the job.
The photography was mesmerizing, capturing the hostile living conditions
of the neighborhood and filling the screen at times with the beauty of a
fire show amid the sirens and turbulence of the night, and in the
background, we can see the famous city skyscrapers of the city
shimmering in the night sky, seemingly changing colors.
I'm glad that Scorsese has made a film that asks a lot of questions of
the viewer, questions that take time to answer because they are complex,
and could best be answered by one's experience with matters of life and
death. And from what is mentioned in the story, we learn that there are
spirits that pull you one way or the other, and sometimes the pull is
not to want to live anymore. That should give one something to think
about.
Scorsese has made a technically perfect film and an artistic one, but is
one that is not suited for everyone's taste, since it takes getting used
to the trauma of the story and its appalling inertia; but, the benefits
are immense for those who stick with it. Scorsese is undoubtedly one of
the finest working directors and he knows how to provoke an audience to
feel the pain of someone else, something that is very difficult to
obtain in this medium. This is a very tough film to honestly say that
you thoroughly enjoyed it, but what's more important than that, is how
it lingers with you for a long time after seeing it and how compelling
it is in a meaningful way. This film, I expect, will be better thought
of than most films of the '90s that attempt to focus in on the city
landscape, including all those films that were so entertaining but in
the end were not as nurturing to the soul as this one was.
It is easy to compare this film to his masterpiece, Taxi Driver, and say
that both films were about a dying city, about someone who works by
driving either a taxi or ambulance at night, and about a similar hero
who had a tortured soul that needed redemption, but the former film was
so much better because it had more action in it, more energy, and did
not compromise the story's pessimism. But I found this film to be more
subtle and more optimistic in a spiritual sense, and even its most
pressing fault, that the subject matter hits too close to the miserable
reality of things in the city and makes this a difficult film to sit
through, should not be that deterring to the serious moviegoer. This
film can't help being anything but a disturbing film, one that questions
the degree of contemporary insanity, and it is not necessarily a better
or worse film than the other one, but it is one that has more
psychological layers of complexity to it that needs to be looked at more
carefully.

Starring Nicolas Cage, John Goodman, Patricia Arquette, Ving Rhames,
Tom Sizemore. Rated R.
Martin Scorcese's latest project is his least potent since his first
(Boxcar Bertha, for the uninitiated, was easily his most turgid
endeavor). The ideas are here and so is the cast, but the set-ups in
the script are merely serviceable. Bringing Out the Dead has a lot of
things going for it but is unable to finally bring them all together
into a compelling whole. It's still a decent feature from one of our
most respected auteurs, but one of Scorcese's masterpieces this ain't.
In his most demanding role since Leaving Las Vegas, Nicolas Cage plays
Frank Pierce, who sleeps by day and is an EMS technician by night. His
stressful job has been getting to him lately, to the point where he
begs his boss to fire him. He thinks he is seeing ghosts of people he
couldn't save as he is driving around nighttime New York City. His
partner (John Goodman) thinks he is losing it, and he may not be all
wrong.
Pierce befriends the daughter of a dying man (Patricia Arquette). Her
guilt and despair drive her to enter the drug underworld from which
Frank must save her without descending there himself. It's harder than
it sounds, especially when a mysterious drug-lord persuades him to take
a pill that gives him the best few hours of sleep in his life. This
dilemma only adds to the stress in his life, and we begin to see that
he is on a verge of a breakdown.
The straw that finally breaks the camel's back is Frank's new partner,
Marcus (Ving Rhames). Though his intentions are honorable, Marcus is a
loud-mouthed, irritating guy who gets on Frank's nerves with his
endless Bible-quoting diatribes. Just when he thought his life couldn't
get any more depressing, he gets partnered with this guy. Folks, get
ready to dance.
Nicolas Cage is fantastic as our favorite EMS technician. I'm not even
sure this performance doesn't surpass the one he is best known for:
Leaving Las Vegas. He is perfect in a movie that's far from it. To say
that he is above his material would be a gross understatement. I've
always thought that John Goodman was a very talented actor and his turn
here certainly does not disprove that. He doesn't get as much
screentime as I would have liked to see, but he makes himself known.
Ving Rhames is an actor famous for his onscreen presence even more than
his tremendous acting ability, and he reinforces that. His character is
the film's most memorable aside from Cage's.
One performance I didn't like here was that of Patricia Arquette, who
is rather flat as Pierce's apparent love interest. The character, too,
is a curious one at best. She seems to act as nothing more as a device;
a tool to squeeze as much pathos as humanly possible out of our
protagonist. She is never defined as a person and we are never given
any reason to care about her other than Pierce's attachment to her, and
that's not enough.
Bringing Out the Dead is a reasonably entertaining but very uneven
movie. It brings together a dream team of performance and a set of
priceless individual moments without piecing them all together
convincingly. Scenes work but the movie never gets off the ground
because the story isn't as interesting to us as Scorcese presumes it to
be. I reveled in the script's details without getting involved in, or
particularly enjoying its main storyline.
Look: this isn't a horrible movie by any stretch of the imagination. I
don't think the post 1975 Scorcese could possibly make one. What this
is, however, is a disappointing movie. It's better viewed as a
collection of vignettes rather than as a big whole. It just doesn't
work like that.

It has been more than two decades since the world has witnessed the
frighteningly prophetic "Taxi Driver" and its vision of a hellish New York
courtesy of director Martin Scorsese and writer Paul Schrader. Now Scorsese and
Schrader revisit those same mean streets to tell us they are just as mean and
almost as hellish. "Bringing Out the Dead" is the latest in the sin, guilt,
redemption and paranoia of the gritty side of Scorsese's New York and its
inhabitants, but the approach is less lean and more listless. Still, it is
often strangely compelling.
The almost gaunt-like Nicolas Cage stars as Frank Pierce, an exhausted
ambulance paramedic who mostly works nights. He has not saved a life in months,
and is starting to feel weary and sleepless - he cannot function in this crazed
city anymore (this story is set in pre-Guiliani New York). Frank sees visions
of an asthmatic girl he could not save in the past - he feels he has killed her
and sees her in the faces of others walking the streets. 
Frank is haunted by these visions, and resorts to drinking gin and eating junk
food on the job. He works with three different medics. One is a detached,
overweight slob, Larry (John Goodman), the other is a Motown-Biblical-preaching
individual named Marcus (Ving Rhames) who flirts with dispatchers and is high
on saving lives, and lastly there's a vicious medic, Tom Walls (Tom Sizemore)
who uses a baseball bat on drug dealers and lives on "the blood spilling on the
streets." 
There is one life he almost saves, an elderly man who nearly dies of a heart
attack. The grieving daughter, Mary Burke (Patricia Arquette), an ex-junkie,
seeks consolation from Frank and hopes that her father will stay alive. This is
the kind of news Frank wants to hear - the blood, the loss of lives (including
a stillborn baby), the stench, the homeless are all reducing Frank to the level
of a saint who lost his powers of healing. As Frank explains, "I was a grief
mop." He can't even get fired from his job because he is needed, even in the
midst of failure. 
"Bringing Out the Dead" is based on an autobiographical book by Joseph Connelly
(a former medic), and the film's episodic structure focuses on three hellish
nights in Frank's life. As always, director Martin Scorsese knows these mean
streets all too well and with cinematographer Robert Richardson, they create a
New York of neon lights, red flashing sirens, sordid, shadowy  environments
such as unsanitized underground dwellings, punkish nightclubs, inviting drug
dens, crazed, overcrowded hospital rooms, etc. In other words, this New York is
not so different from the one depicted in Scorsese's finest film, "Taxi
Driver." But whereas one felt that the New York of Travis Bickle's was an
extension of his own paranoia, this New York feels strangely remote and bland,
much like the title character. 
Nicolas Cage turns in a mostly flat, restrained performance, bereft of any
emotion or significance. Sure, his eyes give the impression of being haunted
but there is little to suggest a sense of individuality. Who is Frank Pierce
anyway? Why does he cling to a job in desperation of saving lives when he needs
to save his own? These are all complex questions but Cage's dignified stare in
two hours running time will make the viewer wish Robert De Niro had been cast.
Cage has some loopy moments with Rhames but not enough to make the character
three-dimensional and introspective. 
I liked Patricia Arquette's performance as the frail Mary and her soft-voiced,
angelic presence that seems almost magical in quality  - her performance is
marginally more interesting than Cage's. There is a moment when Scorsese and
editor Thelma Schoonmaker exchange a series of dissolves between Arquette and
Cage that establishes a connection between them. I also like the final image of
Cage's head resting on Arquette's shoulder while a shade of white fills up the
screen in a reverential manner. 
The best performances are by Ving Rhames, John Goodman and Tom Sizemore as the
fellow medics with different takes on what a job like this entails. Goodman is
credibly detached, Rhames is delightfully sweet and uplifting especially when
he fakes raising a punk rocker from the dead, and Sizemore is creepy and
nervously tense giving us goosebumps each time he appears. 
Other honorable mentions must go to real-life singer Marc Anthony as a
Rastafarian drifter who drinks too much water, New Zealander Cliff Curtis as a
suave, smoothly serene drug dealer (recalling Harvey Keitel's lizard-like
smoothness in "Taxi Driver"), Mary Beth Hurt as a stern, honest hospital
worker, Arthur J. Nascarella as Captain Barney, Frank's boss, and Aida Turturro
as a nurse. 
Scorsese also has employed new techniques in film grammar, which are more often
seen in Oliver Stone's films. The fast-motion, stroboscopic, neon-lit sequences
recall "Natural Born Killers," a technique Scorsese has never used before. It
is no accident that the fast and loose cinematographer is Robert Richardson,
who has lensed many of Stone's films. 
There is a lot to admire in "Bringing Out the Dead," but not much to savor. It
is a curiously flat, messy film with more lows than highs. Cage often fails to
bring the movie out of its dead spots. Still, moments like the impaling of the
drug dealer or Rhames's brief interludes with dispatchers and Cage evoke a
power unprecendented in any film seen this year. "Bringing Out the Dead" is the
kind of Scorsese film that makes you want to go and see a truly passionate
Scorsese film that comes from the gut. Here, he feels like he is cavorting in

"Bringing Out The Dead" opens with a title card that says "This film
takes place in New York City in the early 1990s" as if it's not evident
in the next 2 hours.  It seems unnecessary, since I doubt anyone will
mistake Scrosese's latest opus as a 2 hour episode of "ER."
It's film about 3 days in the life of Frank Pierce (Nicholas Cage), a
paramedic in Hell's Kitchen. From Martin Scorsese, we have come to
expect only the best, just like Terrence Malick, Stanley Kubrick or
Steven Spielberg.  Who set the bar for these directors?  The answer is
evident when you look at their films from the 70s and 80s. They each
did groundbreaking films that set the bar too high for
themselves. "Raging Bull" and "Taxi Driver" are considered two of the
greatest films of all time.  That's the reason "Dead" disappoints.
The first thing we hear in the film is a voice over from Frank Pierce
in an ambulance with his partner Larry (John Goodman). The opening
makes "Bringing Out The Dead" seem like a continuation of "Taxi
Driver."  There's a voiceover from our protagonist who's seeking
redemption in NY with a late night job in a mobile workplace.  He meets
a woman set to get his life back together.  Behind the scenes we have
Martin Scorsese giving Paul Schrader's (Taxi Driver) screenplay his
Midas touch. With those features, it's inevitable to have a sense of
deja vu.  One of the problems with "Bringing Out The Dead" is it tries
to play out as a dramedy.  The dramatic moments so cliched they seem
amateurish.  And the comedic elements that are present are so good, we
wonder why they're criminally underused.
The film gives Frank Pierce three partners. The first is a compulsive
overeater named Larry, played by John Goodman. Trailers, posters, ads,
none mention his name or character. Why? Maybe because he gives the
second to most lackadaisical performance in the film; it doesn't
require much range or acting chops and his segment is the worst easily
dismissable.  It doesn't have any suspense or the tension we've grown
to expect from Scorsese.
Ving Rhames has always been one of my favorite actors. He has a
slickness, a sly coolness that only he can achieve. Every one of his
roles has been great because of him.  He throws his all into each of
them and this is no exception.  The second act of "Bringing Out The
Dead" is definitely the best.  Rhames injects the film with life as
soon as he ignites on the screen.  His character Marcus is a great
contrast to Frank Pierce.  Marcus is a ladies' man whose ego is as big
as the city he lives in. A man who's also a strong believer in God.
Ving Rhames' performance alone is worth the price of admission or at
least a rental.  "Dead" is hilarious, kinetic, in a word, Scorsese-
esque.
And for its final act, the film concentrates on Cage's love interest
and his third partner, Tom Sizemore.  Tom Walls is a psycho-sociopath
and he's played to a tee by Sizemore. His exit scene is just so
sensationally idiosyncratic that I just have to give Tom his props. His
character turns the film into what it should've been in the first
place, a darkly comedic 2 hour MTV video. When he or Ving Rhames are on
the screen letting it all hang out for everyone to see, I'm watching a
good movie. When they're not on, we're left with Patrcia Arquette.
Arquette gives one of the blandest performances I've seen so far this
year. She drags down "Bringing Out The Dead" so much that it will leave
viewers tempted to leave the theatre. I suggest that they don't because
the film does have its admirable traits that should be seen.
