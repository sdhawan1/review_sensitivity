     CAPSULE: A series of story lines told at the same time, not all of
which are connected.  Each is vaguely whimsical but nothing
overwhelmingly funny.  If there is a common theme it is class and
wealth.  Not very entertaining and my showing had many people walking
out.  Rating: 4 (0 to 10), low 0 (-4 to +4)
   - Written and directed by Joao Botelho.
   - Multiple stories, some connected, some not.
   - Music from many different style and countries.
   - Priests decide to close church and sell off the statues.  Very
     funny auction of the John the Baptist.  Giving details of John's
     life and John's virtues as selling points.
   - Women with dayglow wigs status symbol.
   - Woman is really unpleasant to her husband than goes back to
     listening to the song she says she loves, "Stand By Your Man."
   - Many lascivious middle-aged men and women.
   - Extended excerpt of all-female production of Shakespeare's "Julius
     Caesar."  Piece about intrigue.  One couple gets rich from son
     playing on the beach and discovering packs of money.
   - Contrasts of people with old money and the newly rich.
   - Sequence of junkmen reading children's stories from books found in
     a landfill.
   - Priests are obnoxious and thrown out of car while hitchhiking.
   - Long sequence of wealthy people eating sardines.  They use white
     gloves and pick up sardines in hands.
   - It is never clear what the film is trying to say and much possible
     whimsy may have been lost in translation.  It is strange.
