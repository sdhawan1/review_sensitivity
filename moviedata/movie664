Making a movie out of a video game is a pretty bad idea.  We've seen
numerous critical and box office failures that began as depthless video
games (how can a video game really have depth?) and resulted in
depthless movies.  Making a movie about a video game -- now that's a
different story.  As technology progresses, video games are getting more
advanced and immersive, and the political and ethical questions
concerning our urge to lose ourselves in virtual reality is in full
swing.
Of course, David Cronenberg's new film, eXistenZ, is the fourth movie
in the last two months (and the third in the last two days) to deal with
an aspect of this theme.  The other films -- The Thirteenth Floor, Open
Your Eyes, and The Matrix -- range from bad to wonderful, but they all
tackle the virtual reality craze from a slightly different angle. 
eXistenZ is the first to do it using video games as its theme, and one
could easily make the argument that Cronenberg's movie is the most
pointedly critical of the bunch.  It's also the most blatantly strange,
and the most sexually perverse.  And while I disagree wholeheartedly
with many of Cronenberg's claims, I found myself entranced and delighted
with just about every scene of his movie.
eXistenZ is the name of a computer game created by Allegra Gellar, an
abrasive character played by the fearless and mesmerizing Jennifer Jason
Leigh (she forfeited her role in Eyes Wide Shut to make this film, which
impresses me).  During the trial run of eXistenZ, an assassin attempts
to assassinate her, and she's taken off by Ted Pikul (Jude Law), her
bodyguard-in-training.  While on the run, they meet with several people
who are anti-video games, and who attempt to kill Allegra and destroy
her game.  Fearing that her game is moribund (the pod which houses the
game seems to have consciousness), she decides she needs to play
eXistenZ with someone friendly -- namely Ted, who has no interest in
doing so.  Naturally, they enter the game, and things unpredictably
progress from there.  
eXistenZ is worthy of Cronenberg's name.  Aesthetically, the movie is
just plain strange.  The extended metaphor between sex and the game is
anything but subtle; the pod I mentioned earlier is organic and pulsates
with orgasmic pleasure whenever it's used.  Players jack in to the pod
by using a phallic umbilical cord inserted into a suggestive bio-port in
the spine (you must be fitted with a bio-port in order to play the
games).  And though I found the sexual imagery to be in fairly bad
taste, I had no problem soaking it up with silent satisfaction.  The
movie looks just right, with bland colors and appropriately perfunctory
sets.  Howard Shore's musical score is superb, using deep stringed
instruments the way they're meant to be used.  And I love that the film
is set in the vague future; it gives the story a degree of dreadful
believability.
The film is artistically advanced, and Cronenberg does a splendid job
of creating a world that really feels like a video game.  I have more
than passing knowledge of the history of video games (I was once a
zombie at the mercy of my Nintendo), and so I was right at home in the
world of eXistenZ.  There are details in this game world that could have
only been inserted by someone familiar with the way games work -- the
arbitrary nature of the plots, the one-note characterizations, the way
key figures in the story loop mindlessly when they're not being spoken
to.  When it focuses on these elements, the film is really quite funny. 
I love the scene in the Chinese restaurant, in which our heroes are
forced to compose a bone gun out of mutated amphibian parts, shortly
before shooting the Chinese waiter for plot-progressing reasons.  The
film also features an array of wonderful actors, including Leigh, Law,
Ian Holm, Willem Dafoe, Christopher Eccleston, and Sarah Polley.
eXistenZ is most compelling and also most frustrating on a thematic
level.  The basic idea is nothing particularly new -- we've all heard
the argument that the closer we get to virtual reality, the further we
get from true reality.  Then there's the question, "What is reality,
anyway?"  Cronenberg isn't interested in these over-explored ideas.  He
just wants to show us what happens when people become incredibly
obsessed with a life that isn't theirs.  But I was mildly disappointed
with the end of the film, for it creates more questions than it answers,
and Cronenberg doesn't drop enough hints throughout the film for us to
figure out what really happens.  And I was annoyed with the insinuation
that video games lead to mindless violence.  A few months ago, when the
media found time to drool over the massacre in Littleton, Colorado, I
found myself enraged at the screenshots of Doom (a popular and violent
video game) and the implication that playing games like this makes you
shoot real people.  
I digress.  Even though the ending isn't quite satisfactory,
Cronenberg's eXistenZ is an artistic success and an
intelligently-constructed argument against virtual reality.  As we
approach the end of the millenium, we're going to be seeing a lot more
movies like this one -- films that inspire paranoia and breed neurosis. 
But this whole "Is it real or not?" genre is starting to grow on me. 
Perhaps we'll be spared the displeasure of more films based on video
games; instead, we'll be subjected to movies about video game
programmers who can't tell if they're in the real world or the virtual
world.  If these movies turn out to be as fun and imaginative as
eXistenZ, I won't have any problem buying in to them.

Running Time approximately 1hr 40mins
The movie starts with a rather se7en-ish opening sequence, rather cool and
sets the mood for things to come. The story propels the audience into a
neo-reality; somewhat very close to conscious reality but laced with weird
tinges of blue and red. eXisTenZ is actually the name of a new
virtual-reality game. Supposedly, VR games are highly popular as is
considered a legal-drug in this neo-reality. **** (Leigh) is the ultimate
game creator and introduces her ultimate game-experience in the form of
eXisTenZ. Players are required to have bio-ports embedded in their spine,
which plugs to a game-pod in order to enjoy the immersive experience.
During a secretive beta-testing-cum-teaser meeting for this new game, an
assassination attempt on *** life occurs and she runs off with fellow
bodyguard *** (Law). *** is more of a realists than anything else, afraid
that he'll lose reality if he begin to play these games but *** requires his
help to immerse together with her into eXisTenZ to check if the program is
still functioning properly after the assassination attempt. As they soon
discover, they are transported between realities within eXisTenZ  uncovering
more than they initially expected.
eXisTenZ has all the Cronenberg-gore that is expected of him. Even so, this
film is no-where near his cult classics such as Videodrome or Scanners. Not
even half as suspenseful as the commercially successful The Fly. eXisTenz
can probably be looked upon as his 90's version of Videodrome, even so, it
is a poor follow-up. While in most of his famed films, his penchant for gore
always hit the right note with theme of the film and plot. In eXisTenz, the
gory sequences are no more attached to spirit of the film and seem to be an
act of over-indulgence than anything else.
Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law, both commendable actors, looked aloof and
miss-directed throughout the entire film. The scripting and acting barely
pulls the film out of the B-grade category. It was obvious that Cronenberg
worked on a really tight-budget and it seems that he handled that pretty
well in the production design and values created for this film (the opening
sequence, though, probably formed a considerable portion of the budget!)
which is actually quite good.
eXisTenZ is too predictable and cliched in these times. 10 years ago, it
would have been another classic for Cronenberg. Cronenberg fans however,
(those people who enjoy seeing friends getting queasy over mutilation on
film) should not give this film a miss as some form of appreciation can
still be offered by you.

Susan Granger's review of "eXistenZ" (Dimension Films, a division of Miramax)
The title, "eXistenZ," is the name of a virtual reality video
game in this psychologically disturbing sci-fi horror tale. Like
"Naked Lunch," "The Fly," "Crash" and other David Cronenberg films,
it's ghoulish, grisly and grotesque, filled with slimy, squishy,
repugnant creatures and cryptic sexual imagery. Jennifer Jason Leigh
stars as Allegra Geller, the supposedly brilliant designer of the
world's most awesome and challenging games. Accusing her of being a
"goddess" and "demoness," an enemy of reality, various people are
attempting to assassinate her, using a gristle gun, defined as "A
pistol made of bone and gristle, almost like the half-decayed body of
a small mammal, whose snout is the barrel and whose rigid hind leg is
the trigger. Instead of bullets, the gun shoots human teeth." So she
retreats to a throbbing fantasy world by stroking a "game pod," a
fleshy lump with various indentations and nipples, that is attached to
a "bioport" that is surgically inserted in game players' spines and
connected by an umbilical cord. She is accompanied on this wild
journey by a bland, bewildered companion, played by Jude Law, and her
most memorable trippy encounter is with Willem Dafoe, as a demented
mechanic. Allegedly, David Cronenberg was inspired by the plight of
Salman Rushdie when he concocted the exaggerated "writer in jeopardy"
premise and asked his actors to read philosophy of Sartre, Camus,
Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche to get into the mood of the picture. But
much the same satiric concept was already explored in "Strange Days"
(1995) and the final, eerie, macabre plot twist is painfully
obvious. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "eXistenZ" is an
artsy, absurdly weird 5. At one point, Jude Law says, "I find this
disgusting but I can't help myself." Me, too.

Running Time: 1 hour 37 minutes
eXistenZ is a classic case of good idea, bad execution. The film opens with
an preview of a new computer game called 'eXistenZ', where players are
hooked up to the game via wires that go into their spinal column. However,
during the demonstration, the creator of the game, Allegra Geller (Leigh) is
shot at by an extremist anti-games terrorist group. Geller, along with P.R
manager Ted Pikul (Law), flee, and are soon on the road together. They both
eventually hook up into the game to make sure it's still working, and we
join their adventures in the 'lifelike' world of eXistenZ.
eXistenZ has the potential to be an enjoyable action sci-fi romp which also
plays with the audiences mind. However, this being an Cronenberg movie, any
life the movie may have had is drowned in a message-filled mess. There's
little tension, and the only entertainment the film brings come from the
over the top violence that occasionally punctuates the movie. It's a shame,
as there are some great ideas, including guns made from body parts and some
eerie imagery. But the plot is static, and not much happens until the last
30 minutes were we finally enter the game eXistenZ.
The cast don't help the film much. Jennifer Jason Leigh, although usually an
talented actress, seems bored with the film, and doesn't appear to do much.
She mutters most of her lines, and appears to have no interest in what she's
doing. She does look attractive, however. Jude Law is nothing but
irritating: his wide eyed, 'where the hell am I' look does nothing but
grate. Having two lead actors who don't appear to be interested in their
roles doesn't help the film move along. The supporting cast have more fun:
Willem Dafoe is fun as ever as an garage owner, and Ian Holm puts on a
ridiculous accent as an game pod 'surgeon.' Fortunately, they are only
'supporting' actors, and barely feature in the movie. But generally, the
cast do little to make the movie fun.
Cronenberg himself has problems with the film. Even with all these great
gadgets and gizmos, Cronenberg seems more content _really_ fleshing out
boring characters to the point of irritation. The game pods and organic
guns, potentially fun gadgets that could be used much in the film, are sadly
underused. Even the game eXistenZ isn't the most entertaining computer game
in the world: it's certainly no Quake II. Cronenbergs direction only seems
to work when dealing with the strange and gross, a reason why the The Fly
worked so well. Again, in eXistenZ only the gross bits work: there's an
disgusting scene in a Chinese restaurant, for example, that really works,
and anything involving implantation or organic guns usually puts some life
into the film. Other than that, the script, also by Cronenberg, warbles on,
leading to an outrageously obvious conclusion and an hugely ambiguous ending
that irritates beyond belief.
eXistenZ is terribly disappointing. Cronenberg had a potential winner, but
it's just done so badly. The material desperately cries out 'action movie!'
and is not suited to character study at all. There's very little meaning,
and little to grab the attention. eXistenZ could well be the longest 90
minutes of your life, and unless you worship Cronenberg, eXistenZ is worth
waiting for home video.

     Well, Cronenberg is back, and after a couple of misfires like
CRASH, M. BUTTERFLY, and well, pretty much the last ten years of his
oeuvre, he's got a solid flick with EXISTENZ.  In fact, I'd say it's his
best work since 1983's VIDEODROME.
     The story is straight outta modern/near-future pop culture: Using a
"bioport," you can jack your body and mind into an immersive game
world--a world served up by a handheld bio-engineered creature called a
"game pod" that is essentially a blood-pulsing Nintendo.  There are no
computers in the film: just the mutated organisms that are Cronenberg's
trademark.  And oh does he put them to good use.
     Leigh is Allegra, not an allergy medication, but rather the
designer of the hottest games on the planet. And eXistenZ stands to be
her masterpiece.  The object of the game-as is the case with all games
that become the centerpiece of movies--is to learn the object of the
game.  And in this instance, it turns out that some anti-game "Realists"
are on Allegra's tail, so she has to head inside eXistenZ to ensure
everything's kosher, with helpful Jude Law as a sidekick.
     Or so we are led to believe.  EXISTENZ the movie quickly becomes a
game within a game within a game within etc....  Not only are we unsure
of what's real and what isn't, neither are the characters. 
Unfortunately, this conceit kinda gives away the whole film, making it
overly simplistic and cliched for what I'd expect from Cronenberg. 
Frankly, THE MATRIX did it better.
     Still, EXISTENZ is a good ride.  But eat before you come.  The
meals on display here are for presentation only.

David Cronenberg presents us with another strange tale crawling out of his
impressively twisted head. It is one of many science fiction films, released
during the last year of this millenium, that tackles issues that will play
an important role in our future.
The story unfolds in a near future, where the line between reality and
virtual reality blurs. The world of the future is an unfriendly place, where
the scared inhabitants are "hiding" in virtual reality fantasy games to
escape the uncertainty of the real world. Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason
Leigh), the leading game designer in the world, is testing her new virtual
reality game, eXistenZ with a focus group. As they begin, she is attacked by
a fanatic assassin employing a bizarre organic gun. She flees with a young
marketing trainee, Ted Pikul (Jude Law), who is suddenly assigned as her
bodyguard. Unfortunately, her pod, an organic gaming device that contains
the only copy of the eXistenZ game program, is damaged. To inspect it, she
talks Ted into accepting a gameport in his own body so he can play the game
with her. The events leading up to this, and the resulting game lead the
pair on a strange adventure in a world where individuality doesn't exist, as
the "players" are forced to perform as characters in an unknown plot. Here
the reality and their actions are impossible to determine from either their
own or the game's perspective.
I don't intend to reveal more of the film's premise, which is structured as
a computer game, with "tasks" that the characters must complete to win the
game.
Released after "The Matrix" and "Dark City", "eXistenZ" has some
similarities and parallels that connect it to these films. However,
"eXistenZ" is moving in a different direction, with a premise of its own. A
combination of dazzling special effects, brilliantly coordinated action
sequences and an intelligent and sophisticated plot, made "The Matrix" a
rare and entertaining science fiction experience, with some dark and
frightening ideas hidden under its sparkling facade. "eXistenZ" has a
completely different atmosphere, resembling "Dark City" , which is darker,
more serious and less entertaining. "eXistenZ" has the opportunities and
potential, but the enormous possibilities are never quite explored.
After the engaging beginning, it starts to falter.  While I was watching the
film, many left the theatre during the first hour. And indeed, "eXistenZ"
seemed as a complete failure: the actors seemed unreal, the plot and
dialogue silly, unfinished relationships and unexplained events followed one
after another. But the last fifteen minutes lifted the film on a complete
different level, explaining all past events, the silly dialogue and the
unreal performances within a few scenes. And jet the film fails on several
issues. Probably the best written character in the story is a game designer,
who would rather spend the rest of her life in a virtual world, than face
real life. This is a great possibility to create a magnificent character,
and Jennifer Jason Leigh stretches Cronenberg's script to the limits, but
fails because the advantages of virtual reality in comparison to the real
world are never shown. eXistenZ is not a world of which you might dream
about in your fantasies. It is not a world worth sacrificing your life for.
It's a cold, dark place where the "players" are forced to interrelate with
unreal characters, eat mutated creatures and even murder against their own
will. It doesn't look like a place worth even thinking about.
David Cronenberg has been the creator of "The Fly", "Videodrome" and "The
Dead Zone" , so it's not so hard to guess that "eXistenZ" is a violent and
gory film. Besides the regular murders of innocent people, the audiences can
enjoy an autopsy of a two-headed mutated amfibium. Scenes like that have
become a trademark for Cronenberg and it seems that he can't make a film
without flowing blood and foul creatures. The way I see it, this is the
film's crucial failure. It is impossible for Cronenbergto create a beautiful
world where time, space and problems of our everyday life do not exist; a
place of blooming blossoms, green forests and clear waters; a place really
worth sacrificing your life for. Because of its lack of three
dimensionality, the film looses most of its possibilities, but stays afloat
because of some interesting scenes, amusing performances (especially by
Willem Dafoe ) and one interesting and important thought, depicted in many
different ways throughout the movie. During the film, the audience is as
confused as the characters: detached from their everyday existence and no
longer able to see the difference between the real world and the alternative
reality that they have created.
"The Matrix", despite of its many dark and disturbing thoughts, ends with a
light at the end of the tunnel. "eXistenZ" does not. It is a one time
experience, ending in blood, gore and madness - a rather frightening
forecast for tomorrow.

It is the near future.  Allegra Gellar (Lewis) is the world's
greatest designer of virtual reality games.  During a playtest of
her masterpiece "eXistenZ", a botched assassination takes place. 
Unable to trust anyone, she flees with a makeshift bodyguard Ted
Pikul (Law).  Attempting to retrieve the only copy of her damaged
game, Allegra and Pikul enter the scenario as the divisions
between game and reality blur.
In order not to spoil the film, this review must by necessity be
brief and somewhat elliptical.
"eXistenZ" (pronounced ex-is-TENZ, as in existential) divides me
like few films have before.  On one hand there are some nice
twists and turns in it.  On the other the blurring of dream and
reality (be it actual dreams, virtual reality or hallucinations)
has been done similarly many times before.  (To name but a few
examples: "The Game", "Brazil", "The Stuntman", "Naked Lunch".) 
On one hand, "eXistenZ" is sometimes very funny and lively.  On
the other it contains some horrible acting and implausible plot. 
It's a movie I enjoy more in retrospect than in actually seeing
it.
It is the first half-hour of this film that will probably make or
break the viewer's opinion.  The actors drag themselves lumpishly
through the preliminaries to establish the plot.  Lewis, taking a
break from playing nyphomaniac imbeciles, mumbles an explaination
of why her game is so good.  Law sports a North American accent
so phony and an expression so wooden that he seems to have
wandered in from the set of "Night of the Living Dead".  Soon
they are on the run and Law is whining, "I Want To Know What is
Going On", capital letters and all.  But then he confesses, "I
have a fear of having my body penetrated surgically".  And only
in a Cronenberg film would you find anyone with a phobia so
specific.  Probably because he watched "Dead Ringers", poor
fellow.  But then Willem Dafoe shows up, playing a man (uh) a man
with bad teeth, who gives the Law the surgical penetration he's
been looking for.
Then we are introduced to the actual game and about now things
start to get interesting.  Players "plug in" by inserting fleshy
cables into "bioports", cavities in their spine.  Naturally,
sticking the jack into your bioport is a metaphor for sex.  But
this is a Cronenberg film and everything is a metaphor for sex. 
Except for sex itself, which is a metaphor for death.
The game play will give any veteran roleplayer or text adventure
addict a few laughs.  Our protagonists are lead by the nose
through a ridiculous plot, forced into certain actions, and at
one point struggle to extract information from a dopey non-player
character.  (This evoked strong memories of typing, "examine
item, get item, pickup item, retrieve item, grab item," to get
the reply, "You can't do that.")
The plot of the movie itself is mysterious and defies any
consistent explanation.  There is a viewpoint that allows one to
explain away the hideous acting and loo pholes as intentional
artifacts of the director.  But the acting is still poor and the
plot still nonsensical.  But if you can get by that (and it's a
big if), "eXistenZ" will provide a few amusing gags and twists
and probably leave a grin on your face.  [***/good] and a good
party you don't remember most of on the Sid and Nancy scale.

eXistenZ (**** out of ****)
Starring Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jude Law, Ian Holm
Directed By David Cronenberg
Mirimax/Dimension Films, Rated R, 1999
Running Time: 1 Hour 38 Minutes
Part One of "The Strangest Movies Ever Made" Series at www.mediajunkies.com
[LIGHT SPOILERS, nothing you shouldn't read]
eXistenZ has been called "a gooey Matrix", and while this is a correct
description in some ways, in others it is completely off. The only
thing the two films have in common is the idea of a virtual reality
that is indistinguishable from normal, "real" reality. A major
difference is that "The Matrix" has a base reality that is obviously
the true reality, while eXistenZ does the impossible and makes us
accept the most bizarre reality ever as true. And oh what a reality it
is. David Cronenberg has shown us before that he knows how to create
strange movies (Naked Lunch, Crash), but this one is one of the
strangest. Maybe it's because of how the mundane is mixed with the
bizarre. Technology is organic, but only some of it. Cars are
normal. Gas stations are the same. Cell phones are glowing bug like
appendages. You jack into a virtual reality game using a quivering
pink gooey animal like apparatus (referred to simply as a "pod").
High technology has been replaced with organic creatures, and it
provides a truly surreal setting for the characters.
A famous game designer, Allegra Geller (a fine looking Jennifer Jason
Leigh), flees a demonstration of her latest game, eXistenZ, after an
assassination attempt. She is on the run (from who, I'm still not
sure), and has to save her pod by playing her game with "someone
friendly". That someone friendly is her dubious companion and security
guard, Ted Pikul (Jude Law). Unfortunately he is lacking a fundamental
requirement for playing, a bioport. Sort of a hole in your spine (ok,
exactly like a hole in your spine), a bioport allows you to plug the
vaguely entrail-looking wires from the pod into you, allowing you to
play the game. Luckily a bioport can be installed easily (they install
them in malls), so off they go to get one. After a crazy series of
events at the local country gas station, they are able to plug in and
play eXistenZ.
The plot itself is a surreal melding of conspiracies, reality
distortion, Chinese restaurants, and multi appendaged amphibian things
("It's a sign of the times"). But the plot, while cohesive in it's own
creepy way is secondary to just trying to figure out what the hell is
going on in this universe.  Cronenberg just slaps this weird
organic-tech world into the viewers lap, and it's up to you to figure
out how all these things work. And that's the true joy of this film,
entering the vaguely nightmarish world in which eXistenZ takes place.
You learn a little bit piece by piece (oh, they make pods out of
those), and it's just enough to get you to accept the world that is
presented to you.
There are all kinds of twists and turns as the characters wander
around, including a fantastic scene in a Chinese restaurant that will
leave you trying to assemble something out of your Moo Goo Gai Pan for
months afterwards.  Also the bioports are occasionally used for things
other than porting into eXistenZ , the specifics of which I will leave
for you to discover. There's lots of little things that set off the
weird-o-meter, like the little tiny pods that you can buy in the video
game store, the two headed amphibian creature, and why that guy at the
gas station's name appears to be "Gas". It all adds up to a supremely
far out trip, and given the choice I think I would rather live in The
Matrix's virtual world... oh wait, I already do.

Hollywood always seems to release movies that are similar to each other 
back-to-back or near back-to-back.  Take for instance the mad-bomber phase 
when Hollywood released both Speed (good) and Blown Away (bad) 
together.  Or when the animated bugs took the screen with A Bug's Life 
(good) and Antz (good also).  Well, in 1999 there was a phase when 
Hollywood decided to release two movies about alternate or externally 
generated realities together.  The first was a hit, and I loved it, it was 
The Matrix.  The second I skipped and waited for DVD and that was 
eXistenZ.  I finally got to see eXistenZ on DVD, am I glad I waited.
eXistenZ is the name of a virtual reality game developed over some five 
years by the world's most famous and best game developer, Allegra Gellar 
(Jennifer Jason Leigh).  After an attempt on her life, she is on the run 
and is being protected by a PR geek named Ted Pikul (Jude Law).  In order 
to save her game, she has to go into it and play  why she has to play the 
game in order to save it, I don't know and I don't remember the movie tell 
me either.  So, she and Ted Pikul enter eXistenZ to play the game and save it.
Unlike most virtual reality or alternative reality movies, eXistenZ takes a 
different approach to "jacking in."  Instead of the standard fare of 
plugging into a computer, eXistenZ resides on an organic thing  it's hard 
to describe, but, in the movie it looks like a melted rubber mask from some 
monster movie that moves and makes little noises that you might expect out 
of a doll.  The organic pod is plugged into the game player via a bio-port 
located at the bottom of the players back and it gets plugged directly into 
the player's spine.  All of this is good and fine, it's actually pretty 
innovative.
What's not to like about this movie?  Well, to start off, I think director 
David Cronenberg has some sort of fetish with alien flesh or raw 
carcass.  I was disgusted by most of the movie (not to mention I lost my 
appetite when I watched the Chinese restaurant sequence).  Cronenbery just 
piles on the flesh, bones, and carcass throughout the movie and it reaches 
a point where I just said to myself, "Aw, this is complete crap."
It doesn't help that the script is completely predictable.  The idea behind 
the script is standard fare when it comes to stories about alternate 
realities.  It is much like The Matrix's in that it leads the viewers 
through some alternate realities and then leaves the viewer to wonder what 
reality the characters are really in.  Are they still in some alternate 
reality?  Or are they in the "real" world"?  Well, although both eXistenZ 
and The Matrix are predictable in that sense, at least The Matrix had some 
intriguing ideas behind it (albeit a little stupid like the 
humans-as-batteries idea) and it had some kick-ass action sequences to 
boot.  eXistenZ had neither.  The movie is about carcass about flesh.  It's 
about two people wandering through something that at any given point if 
they were killed, I wouldn't give a damn.  The story is so thin that I 
wondered halfway through the movie what the point of them playing the game 
was  and like I said before, that was never explained.
The main actors Jude Law and Jennifer Jason Leigh wander through the movie 
like their characters.  Maybe they were just doing it for the extra cash, I 
can only hope they were.  Especially for Jude Law who gave such a wonderful 
performance in another sci-fi film Gattaca, it was disappointing to see him 
in such schlock as eXistenZ.  Leigh does what she can with her part, which 
is a part that has no excitement, no real character.
I've never been a fan of eXistenZ writer/director David Cronenberg and 
eXistenZ does not help to move me into his fan club either.  Cronenberg is 
one of those auteur directors who love to do things differently, which I 
have nothing against.  Some of the best directors go against the grain of 
Hollywood and make some of the best and most innovative films.  But, 
Cronenberg seems to try way too hard at it.  He tries to be way too 
different.  Maybe he's making the film for himself, I don't know, but 
eXistenZ was not entertaining at all.  It was predictable and 
disgusting.  I wonder how Cronenberg got the green light on this project.
So, was there anything that I did like about this movie?  Yes, only one 
thing.  That was the haunting score by Howard Shore (The Game).  Howard 
composes a wonderful score that is wasted on a terrible movie.
Skip eXistenZ, save an hour and a half of your time.  This film is just 
garbage that's not worth watching.  If you want an alternative-reality film 
fix, then go rent The Matrix.  Or if you want a film that will screw with 
your head about a different reality then go rent an older film named 
Jacob's Ladder.  eXistenZ is like a lot of the mutant animals in the film, 
an ugly mutated version of something that could have been beautiful.  Skip 
eXistenZ.

Wow.  eXistenZ, directed and written by David Cronenberg, was certainly a
surprise film for me.  This film just proves that trailers and hype don't mean
anything with a movie, because the cast was somewhat unfamiliar with me, and
the strange trailers were not too great, and I had hardly heard anything about
this little known film.  In eXistenZ, Jennifer Jason Leigh stars as famed
computer programmer Allegra Geller, who has just completed her latest game,
entitled eXistenZ.  Allegra's games are much different from anything that we
have out today, such as Nintendo 64 or PC games.  In Allegra's games, you are
put into virtual reality.  In order to participate in one of her games, you
must have a bio-port hole, which is a small hole inserted into your lower back.
 To get inside the state of the art game, an object called a pod must have its
cables inserted to your bio-port hole.
Allegra is very excited about eXistenZ.  At the premiere of the program, an
attempt to assassinate her takes place, which also damages the eXistenZ
program.  In fear that it is destroyed, Allegra must enter the program with
another person to see if everything is working properly.  A man named Ted Pikul
(Jude Law) becomes that person after he takes care of Allegra after she was
shot in the shoulder.  The two enter the program, and experience something they
never have before.  The program of eXistenZ puts you in a completely virtual
world, but it seems very realistic.  You do not know what the point of the game
is until you reach the end of the game.  From here, eXistenZ turns into one of
the most interesting and fun movies I have ever experienced, making my mind
become extremely involved with the content of the film.
The plot, much like the less superior film The Matrix, is twisted a little more
than in The Matrix.  It is much more fun, and it actually makes a lot more
sense than The Matrix ever did to me.  It is explained a lot better, and
certainly a lot more interestingly.  Although I loved The Matrix, eXistenZ is
just one step further than it in many ways.  What added the most to eXistenZ
was the extraordinary, well-done, surprising ending.  The film overall is just
a whole lot of fun, doing everything that was necessary to get you caught up in
it in just a ninety seven minute running time.  David Cronenberg certainly made
the best possible use of this time as he could.
This is the first movie that I have seen starring Jennifer Jason Leigh in, and
now I would like to see more of her performances.  She is great in eXistenZ,
making you believe every scene she is in.  Jude Law, whom I have only seen in
1997's Gattaca, was just as good in this as he was the 1997 overlooked film
with Uma Thurman.  Jude Law and Jennifer Jason Leigh are marvelous on screen
together, helping to create the reality of eXistenZ.  There are many supporting
performances which added to the film, including ones by Ian Holm, who played
Kiri, a man who helped fix the eXistenZ program pod, Willem Dafoe, who played
Gas, an evil character in the game, Sarah Polley, who played Merle, and Don
McKellar who played Yevgeny Nourish, another rarely seen character.  These
performances didn't have room to expand or go anywhere, but that's ok.  The
central focus was on Ted and Allegra, and that's what is the important here.
Special effects play an important part in the film.  Strange creatures, called
mutated reptiles, are very realistically done, and were very creative looking. 
The special effects aren't all pleasant in eXistenZ though.  Many disturbing
images are about in the film, making me shift in my seat or cover my eyes. 
That just goes to show how well done they were though!  The special effects,
put together with the acting and plot, make for an original, wild ride through
what games could be like in the coming years.  Could this become a true story
in the future?  Only time will tell.
The Bottom Line- I wish more movies were in existence like eXistenZ.

     While there is much in "eXistenZ" that harkens back to VIDEODROME,
the film is new and fresh.  It is a big night for Antenna Research, a
leading virtual-reality game company.  They are ready to start the
last round of tests for their new reality-bending game eXistenZ.  They
do not want to say what makes eXistenZ so different,  but it is a
distinct step beyond other virtual reality games that also tap directly
into the nervous system through jacks in the base of the spine.
eXistenZ is something of a breakthrough.  It is so new that the demo of
eXistenZ will be done by the inventor of eXistenZ, the queen of game
designers Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh).  But something is
wrong.  The competition has gotten an agent into the crowd and he
nearly assassinates Geller with a strange handgun made of living
matter.  Ted Pikul (Jude Law), who is providing security, takes Allegra
to safety at a local motel.  But Allegra has to test her eXistenZ
gamepod, containing the only complete version of the game.  (It is
worth in the tens of millions of dollars and she keeps the only copy in
her pocket.  Right.)  That means she needs a playing partner.  But Ted
does not have the jack at the base of his spine and is less than
anxious to get one.  Luckily there is a local gas station attendant
(deliciously played by Willem Defoe) who installs jacks as a sideline.
And for Ted a strange new world is about to open.
     David Cronenberg makes some of the most bizarre films of any
popular filmmaker. What is remarkable is that the more his films get
strange the more he crosses over to a mainstream audience.  It was not
enough that he had the weird alien medical instruments that he had in
DEAD RINGERS, here he takes things a step further and makes all the
machinery of the games, the game pods and the connecting cables, out of
organic material.  One does not so much flip a switch as massage and
caress it.  Connections are not made by cables but by umbilical cords.
Cronenberg comes dangerously close to alienating his viewer by
disgusting him.  But ingeniously he keeps the tone just light and
freakily witty enough that the viewer happily goes along for the ride.
But the wit is never so over the top to turn the "eXistenZ" into a
farce.  When I saw the film the audience seemed to be enjoying the film
immensely.  Cronenberg's problems are not with his audience but with
his financial backers.  Reportedly the major studios that could have
financed "eXistenZ" found the plot to be "too non-linear."  They were
absolutely right that as the plot goes skin-diving through layers of
reality things do get a bit complex, but that is much of the fun of the
film.  The non-linearity works for the film, not against it.
     Early in her career I found Jennifer Jason Leigh's roles to be an
irritating combination of ingenue and counter-culture.  She was sort of
the Homecoming Queen with a gun from Julie Brown's song.  But as her
collection of offbeat characters increases I am beginning to appreciate
what an accomplished character actress she has become.  Here she gives
a well-balanced performance that is generally perfect for the
Cronenberg material.  Jude Law of GATTACA and MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF
GOOD AND EVIL plays the understandably bewildered protagonist pulled
into the worlds of reality switching and being implanted with strange
impulses.  Along for the ride are Ian Holm with a thick accent.  Also
present is Don McKellar, the actor who seems to be as ubiquitous in
Canadian film these days as Denholm Elliot was at one time in British
film.
     "eXistenZ" is nearly as complex as the current THE MATRIX, but it
has real characters and a plot involving three-dimensional people with
motivations rather than with martial arts skills.  For the right
audience the film is a kick.  I rate the film an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale
and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.

eXistenZ (director: David Cronenberg; cast: Jennifer Jason Leigh
(Allegra Geller), Jude Law (Ted Pikul), Ian Holm (Kiri Vinokur), Don
McKellar (Yevgeny Nourish), Sarah Polley (Merle),Willem Dafoe (Gas),
Callum Keith Rennie (Hugo Carlaw), Kris Lemche (Noel Dichter), 1999)
This escapist movie is sponsored in part by Sega, influenced in part by
the death threat on Indian author Salmun Rushdie, and it sure feels like
a '60s bad acid trip ala video game that the twelve game players in the
film are into. The battle that takes place is between the dreaded
realists and the creative ones. The film takes on the theme of fighting
censorship and finding out who the real you is.William Burroughs
influenced Cronenberg with the idea that what you create as an artist
becomes a living thing, it goes out into the world and has a life of its
own but is still connected to you.
Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is the creator of the newest and
most innovative virtual reality game, eXistenZ. It is pronounced with
philosophical pretensions as "eggs is tense." As the game starts, she is
attacked by a realist with a gristle gun, that is made of mammal flesh
and bones, and shoots human teeth instead of bullets. The security guard
Ted Pikul (Jude) is really a marketing trainee from the company that
sponsors the 38 million dollar game, who comes to her rescue and they
flee, prepared to trust no one from now on but only to take pleasure in
the game they are in.
A game is only a game. And two heads are better than one. These could be
some slogans for a game that has no explanation or purpose for its
existence. You get to know about it only when you play it.
To play the game, means you have to penetrate the body by means of bio
ports, which are  openings in the spine. They must be lubricated before
being penetrated with ersatz umbilical cords being connected to
"metaflesh game pods." That's a fleshy lump with several nipples,
and it's meant to be stroked by game players. You see the obvious
allusions to sex in the game's foreplay.
All this game stuff is really not that interesting to see. The two stars
are only mildly diverting, arousing no particular warm feelings for
their plight. Their aim is to provide suspense and a dark sense of
humor, which they do on occasion. But they fail in achieving any depth
in their characters; therefore, they are seen only as being the game
figures they are portraying.
The main supporting cast includes Willem DaFoe as Gas and Ian Holm as
Kiri. Both in minor roles. Gas operates a gas station (natch) where the
fleeing couple stop to get Ted a bio port he needs to be in the game;
his new pod will also help Allegra repair the pod she had damaged during
the attack on her.
Dafoe, who claims to have had his life saved by Allegra's game, must
take credit for having the funniest line in the movie. It comes about
when Ted asks, "Why do you still run a gas station?" He replies, "Only
on the most pathetic level of reality."
Kiri is a game character who talks with a thick European accent. As a
scientist living in a remote sking village, he will operate on Allegra's
diseased pod, which is a result of Gas trying to ruin her pod for a
rival game company... For Allegra, her pod is vital, as it holds the
only formula to the game in it.
The film sinks downhill from here on. It becomes about squishy "mutated
amphibians" and double-crosses by rival game company spies, and realists
who feel threatened by the escapists. The characters act out who they
are in the game, until they can't tell if they are playing a game or if
what is happening to them is real. Most of the action scenes take place
in a trout farm and a Chinese restaurant. But much of the story just
didn't add up and the virtual reality didn't look so hot, either.
The only thing left to be accomplished was a surprise ending, and that
comes as sure as a heart attack. The only thing is, that the surprise
ending really came too late too save the film, and if you thought about
it, it didn't make sense, unless you believe that the two best game
players were ironically the one's who were really anti-gamers; that is,
inspite of their negative energy they were still able to excel in the
game.
After a belated assassination when the game is supposedly over, the film
ends on this conversation between the two game winners, Allegra and Ted:
As Ted asks, "Are we still in the game?" He said, "Tell me the truth,
are we still in the game?"
Cronenberg needs more than ideas for his next film, he needs a good
script and actors who are more suited for their roles.The biggest
mistake was in the casting of Jude Law as a romantic hero. He didn't
have the charisma to pull off his part...This virtual reality story left
me thinking that it could have been done with more fluidity and feeling.

Existenz is yet another example of David Cronenberg divided against
himself. His films tend to depict the actions of an altered human
consciousness in which he would dearly like to participate, coupled
with the price of that consciousness, which is normally paid for in
blood. One thinks back to Naked Lunch, where for William Lee writing
is equated with killing his wife over and over; Seth Brundle in The
Fly, where his "improvements" ultimately result in his loss of
humanity and death; and the participants in Crash who seem marked for
death after being introduced to the sexual euphoria in dangerous
driving. Cronenberg is forever torn between the transformation of
humans into other beings, all the while planning on the moment when he
can hit the ejector seat and leave his fated company to die or
disperse into silence and solitude.
This time his dual citizenship in the country of his special little
people is represented by a marketing man (Jude Law) who is torn from
the very fabric of reality itself in the course of doing his job.
Doing security at a test-marketing session for the new virtual reality
game Existenz (hence the title), the little man finds himself
defending the game's inventor, Allegra Gellar (Jennifer Jason Leigh)
from a pack of terrorists called "realists" who wish to destroy the
very idea of virtual reality. Fleeing from an attempted massacre by a
realist with a flesh and blood gun- which shoots human teeth- he is
thrust into the arms of the virtual reality program of which he is
very wary. As he says in the film's forthrightly Freudian manner, "I
don't like the idea of things penetrating..." 
While the film remains centred on the travail of Leigh's character,
the audience is stuck with the know-nothing Law as entry point to this
strange new world of besieged falsehood and militant reality. Running
with his widely-acknowledged debt to the interview he conducted with
Salman Rushdie, we are presented with a fiction perceived as so
dangerous that extremists will kill those who propagate it. This means
that those on the side of the fiction must find a safe haven- no easy
feat with a huge price on Leigh's head. The plot thickens when her
"game pod"- a curvy, feminine device with two nipples and a central
valley- is shorted out by an improperly-installed spinal jack on Law;
the two must first find someone to repair the organically based game
pod, and then jack into it in order to ensure the game's safety.
Giving away any more of the plot of this multi-layered extravaganza
wouldn't be cricket. But rest assured that there are gender issues to
be dealt with here, as there always are in Cronenberg. As stated
earlier, Law's character hasn't been fitted for a spinal jack because
fears the act of "penetration" to be performed on him, thus confirming
a certain amount of feminization of the part of the VR user.
Cronenberg's oeuvre has long been concerned with the feminization of
participants in technology, from the giant metallic telepod-as-womb in
The Fly to the hallucinated vagina on James Woods in Videodrome to the
long scars that the car-sex enthusiasts in Crash fetishize. In an
article by an author whose name escapes me now, Cronenberg was accused
of envying the female capacity for reproduction, and thus explored the
possibility of feminization through penetration (The critters in
Shivers, for example) or the construction of wombs (gynecology in Dead
Ringers, the telepods in The Fly, Woods' vagina-like opening in
Videodrome). Cronenberg is obsessed with creating special people who
can transcend gender through artificial means, making the gender
divide almost invisible. 
But what is also recurrent is Cronenberg's waffling over the
significance of his special people. On the one hand, he seems
fascinated by their increased powers and sheer difference- the fact
that they are other, enhanced beings than mere humans; on the other
hand, this difference gets to be dangerous. While he would seem to be
on the side of the pro-game contingent here, his camera style and
second-person entry point through law would seem to indicate a sense
of disconnection from his own creations, as if he had opened Pandora's
box and then denied the whole thing. The fascination we have with the
characters is filtered through Cronenberg's fascination and repulsion,
resulting in an arms-length aesthetic practice in which the characters
and situations are observed rather than identified with. This isn't
some Brechtian agenda of Cronenberg's- it's emotional cold feet, a
bizarre act of disavowal which ends up trivializing the films'
explosive subject matter into a series of theorems to be examined but
never engaged with. This unwillingness to go the other way is best
summed up by Videodrome's New Flesh convert blowing his brains out,
but never suggesting the utopian vision on the other side that the
film has been hinting at.
The intellectual double-standard is here coupled with an aesthetic
aridity that is all too familiar to those who have followed
Cronenberg's career. What calls for an extravaganza of sensory
overload in the world of the VR simulation is visually lacking, full
of unused spaces and God's-eye camera angles. While you are invited to
watch through the surrogate of Law, watching is all that you'll do;
your participation is limited to being directed by Leigh and watching
in horror at the consequences of a variety of pre-chosen actions
dicatated by the Existenz game. Ultimately there's not much freedom in
Cronenberg's world. There is a definite feeling of futility of any of
the actions of the characters in the film, as dependant as they are on
other people (beings?) pulling the strings on the shifting landscapes
of the mind. The results, while nominally engrossing, are ultimately
unfeeling and hollow at heart.

As a Canadian and fellow countryman of director David Cronenberg's, I have
always appreciated his visionary style of movie making with all the subtlety
of a violent storm.  Cronenberg rips into the very body of science fiction
and horror and then stands back and  holds its beating heart in his hand.  I
admire his approach to the material and the films where he has served as
both director and author or co-author of the screenplays are among his best
work.  Cronenberg's vision is comparable to that of a mad scientist.  His
work is always layered with the unorthodox and sinister sides of the human
soul and by this description I mean it as the highest possible compliment
because after all, his intention is to scare movie audiences into a frenzy
and although his films often have a sickening side to them, that's just in
his nature to show it that way.
Cronenberg began his career making short films in 1966 with a little number
entitled 'Transfer'.  Not only did he serve as the film's writer, director,
and producer, but he photographed and edited the project himself.  He first
gained a major following with his 1975 effort 'Shivers' and made 'Rabid'
(1977), 'Fast Company' and 'The Brood', both in 1979 before the film that
really would solidify him as a major film maker, 'Scanners' (1981) which was
about a form of mental telepathy that could pressurize and explode human
heads.  That film is his most cult like and chilling statement and he would
tackle Hollywood productions with 'The Dead Zone' (1983), and 'The Fly'
(1986), which won an Oscar for its incredible make-up.  Cronenberg's last
four films before 'eXistenZ', 'Dead Ringers' (1988), 'Naked Lunch' (1991),
'M Butterfly' (1993) and 'Crash' (1996) all show his ability to get better
with age and his maturity as a film maker remains intact.  'Naked Lunch' was
thought to be a story impossible to film, based on the literary work of
William S. Burroughs, and while I didn't like the film, I could see its art
which was brought to new heights by the incredibly droning and dream like
dialogue Cronenberg injected into the film.  'eXistenZ' is certainly made
with the Cronenberg stamp placed on it and the film is a perfect way to
usher in the new millennium as it plays on our fears and intimidating
feelings about technology.
Jennifer Jason Leigh is Allegra Geller, a designer of virtual reality games
who wants to test her latest invention on a focus group gathered one
evening, and they see her as a god who has designed some of the best games
ever made.  A member of the security team named Ted Pikul (Jude Law) fails
to protect her at the meeting and she's shot and pursued by her competitors
who want her dead for their own agenda.
The game is called eXistenZ and it's played by plugging into a human being's
bio port which is on the lower back and is sort of like an electrical outlet
inserted through the area to put a hole in the spine where all data connects
and draws the user into a virtual reality game where it is impossible to
tell reality from all the rest.  Allegra and Ted flee the shooting scene and
stop on a country road to assess their situation and Allegra persuades Ted
to have a bio port installed on his body and it's done at a small,
by-the-road service station by a character named Gas (Willem Dafoe).
Apparently, having a bio port installed is as easy as having your ears
pierced and we assume that this film is set many years in the future because
real life technology like this hasn't even been invented yet.  Let alone the
fact that a patent on such an idea would be very hard to get.
And that's where 'eXistenZ' really picks up and runs with the ball as it is
an original idea done with all the wet gore you would expect from a David
Cronenberg film.  It's suspenseful, darkly lit, but is really for die hard
Cronenberg fans who will enjoy it best.  The chemistry works well between
Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law and other interesting performances in the
film come from Don McKellar, Ian Holm and Callum Keith Rennie with a cameo
by Sarah Polley.  The only thing missing is a cameo by Cronenberg himself in
some small way which would have been a nice touch.  The film's subject
matter is a metaphor for drug use, sexual escapades and violent frustrations
and Cronenberg's the sole author of the film's screenplay and calls his own
shots all the way.
Not only is the film a story about virtual reality but that's exactly the
way the film plays before an incredible twist comes near the end of its
appropriate running time of 97 minutes.  Not too short and not too long is
the way a film like this should be made.  By making it appeal to our
attention span which would probably hold up as long as if we really were
playing a game.

Writer and director David Cronenberg enjoys pushing the edge of the
envelope.  Some of his movies, like CRASH about people who stage auto
accidents for sexual arousal, are stylish misses, and others, like
EXISTENZ about a virtual reality game made solely of biological
components, are mesmerizing.
The story opens with a focus group about to try the new game,
"eXistenZ," from world renowned "game pod goddess" Allegra Geller.
Allegra, who dresses in a short shirt and wears spike heals, is played
with confidence and intelligence by Jennifer Jason Leigh from GEORGIA.
The company introducing the game has the building under such tight
control that metal detectors screen all entrants.  This does not help
Allegra, however, when she is wounded by a would-be assassin.  He
carries an organic gun that fires human teeth, which renders the metal
detector useless.  The rest of the movie has her and her $28 million
dollar game pod on the run.
Along as her bodyguard in her flight is GATTACA's Jude Law as Ted Pikul.
Ted, as Allegra is upset to discover, doesn't even carry a weapon since
he's actually just a marketing intern at the company and not in security
at all.
The techo future they live in looks a lot like 1950's tacky, complete
with cheap motels and old gas stations run by grease monkeys.  About the
only changes are that people don't bother actually doing the physical
things, like skiing, that they used to do before the advent of powerful
virtual reality systems.
The story's success stems from the concept of the system itself and from
the intricate world built around it.  The game pod looks like some
bodily organs covered with a rubbery outer substance.  To connect to the
game pod you must have a bioport.  A bioport is "just" a hole in your
spine in which you attach an umbilical cord-like device that runs to the
game pod.  Just like we have places in the mall to do ear piercing, they
have licensed establishments to puncture your spine.  (As you might
guess, this being a Cronenberg film, one of the few sexual scenes will
involve a tongue and a bioport.)
Allegra talks a very reluctant Ted into going into her game with her.
Willem Dafoe, as an extra greasy grease monkey named Gas, is called upon
to install a quick and dirty bioport on Ted.  Ted doesn't like this idea
at all.  "I have this phobia about having my body penetrated
surgically," he tells Allegra.  "You know what I mean?" Actually, she
doesn't, since living in a game world for her is more natural than
existing in the real world.
If you're squeamish about gore and goo, EXISTENZ probably isn't the film
for you.  The pods, which contain nothing but biological parts, are
frequently sliced open and operated on as blood flies everywhere.  The
movie becomes a crazy mixed up world like a "Twilight Zone" episode
about a game show on the "Surgery Channel."  There are wild jokes about
how the characters in the game have underwritten roles and are played
with bad accents by poorly cast actors.  The film, with its steel-gray
blue cinematography and its creepy music, never fails to hold your
attention.
Poor Ted finds Allegra's game almost impenetrable, complaining that in
the game "the rules are indecipherable and possibly non-existent."  This
is all true and is what makes the movie so fascinating to observe.
"There is some weird reality effect happening here," Allegra says.  "I'm
not sure if I get it."  And the story is such a mind trip that most of
the audience will be equally and pleasantly confused as well.
"What are you doing," Allegra asks during the game when Ted crunches
into some gross-looking food at a Chinese restaurant near the trout farm
where they work.  "I don't know," he says honestly.  "I find this
disgusting, but I can't help myself."  My sentiments exactly.  And could
you please bring on the next course.
EXISTENZ runs a fast 1:37.  It is rated R for violence, gore, profanity
and sexuality and would be fine for teenagers.

Virtual reality is a concept that is beginning to lose its luster partly
because no one seems to have the imagination or the stamina to explore it.
After enduring endless ordeals like "Lawnmower Man" and "The Matrix," one can
savor the lurid, fascinating, uneven "eXistenZ," the latest from the twisted
mind of David Cronenberg, who helmed mind and body experiments like "Crash,"
"Videodrome" and "The Naked Lunch." 
"eXistenZ" stars Jennifer Jason Leigh as Allegra, a twisted, sexy computer
designer whose latest creation is a game called eXistenZ, a virtual reality
game where a bio-port is connected to the spine, and resembles a fleshy game
pod made of amphibious organs and brain matter. The game begins, but this is
not a world of razzle-dazzle computer pyrotechnics or laser beams or kung-fu
fights. Instead, you experience a world where trout farms exist, guns made of
chicken bones and fire human teeth, people walk and act like zombies, and
Chinese waiters serve you two-headed amphibians. To make matters worse, Allegra
enters her own game with a seemingly incompetent market trainee (Jude Law), who
has not been accommodated with a bio-port. 
"eXistenZ" never makes clear when it is a game or when we are seeing reality,
although I am sure that in our reality, two-headed amphibians who seemed to
have wandered in from Jurassic Park are non-existent. Nevertheless,
Cronenberg's idea is to show that a faux reality may not be far from our own -
our feelings and emotions dictate our fantasies, and some are more dangerous
than others. If only he pushed further with this concept as Wim Wenders did
with the dreamlike, humanistic "Until the End of the World," a parable about
the danger of being addicted to visual images. Cronenberg wallows in grisly,
fleshy details and sudden bursts of violence - the most impressive is the
shooting of a Chinese waiter, which shows that the Jude Law character may be
taking the concept of the game's "free will" too far. 
The actors follow the command of Cronenberg's universe, and no one ever
overacts even in the game. Jennifer Jason Leigh is indeed one of my favorite
actresses of all time - a quixotic wonder with her expressive eyes, sexual
demeanor, and wavy-like patterns in her blonde curls. She is the perfect
Cronenberg heroine, and we side with her and hope she can survive her own
destructive game. Jude Law reminds me of Rufus Selwell in "Dark City" - he
handles his role with aplomb and subtle smirks directed towards the whole
ridiculous show. I also enjoyed the tense, rat-like Ian Holm as the designer of
the pods - it is a real kick to watch this actor repairing a bloody pod. 
"eXistenZ" still has Cronenberg's continuing clinical obsession with flesh and
bodily fluids - it affected me to watch these slimy appendages being applied to
our semi-heroes in agony, as if they couldn't get enough. This is decidedly not
meant for the "Matrix" action crowd. Thus, "eXistenZ" disturbs and intrigues,
but it never is truly profound or provocative.

"Videodrome" and "Dead Ringers" director David Cronenberg is really 
getting on my neRvZ. As a follow-up to "Crash," his 1996 endurance test 
about people who get sexually aroused by car wrecks, he offers "eXistenZ,
" a grisly, uninspired tale about virtual reality run amok. Once again, 
Cronenberg operates on the assumption that if you fill the screen with 
enough creepy imagery, people will overlook leaden pacing, flat 
characters and a tired, obvious "question reality" storyline with a final 
"twist" so obvious that it's almost laughable. 
The basic theme of "eXistenZ" was explored more effectively in 1995's 
"Strange Days," and with far less goo. Cronenberg throws so much blood 
and guts into this film that at times I felt like I was watching the 
Surgery Channel on a TV placed in a tank full of bait. I wish he would 
just take a job in a slaughterhouse and get this fetish out of his system 
once and for all. 
Cronenberg also uses another of his favorite attention-getting devices, 
grisly sexual imagery. To play eXistenZ (pronounced EGGs-iz-TENZ), 
participants must have "bio ports" drilled into their lower backs to 
allow an organic cord to plug the "metaflesh game pod" directly into the 
spinal column. In addition to showing us the vaguely phallus-shaped cords 
being plugged into the "bio-ports," we're also treated to a shot of one 
character inserting a finger into a freshly drilled "port" hole and 
another of a character licking one of the openings. Golly (nudge, nudge, 
wink, wink), what could David possibly be alluding to with these images? 
One thing's for sure: I would never let this guy date my sister.
The gore-porn motif might be acceptable were it serving a novel story, 
but after an intriguing beginning, the film goes nowhere, and takes what 
feels like forever to get there. It starts at a test session for eXistenZ.
 Volunteers meet Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh), inventor of the 
new virtual reality game, and prepare to try out her creation. Suddenly, 
an audience member leaps forward, shouting revolutionary slogans while 
trying to assassinate Allegra with a gun that looks as if it were 
assembled from Thanksgiving turkey leftovers. Ted Pikul (Jude Law), a 
company lackey and virtual reality virgin, rescues Allegra and the pair 
take flight. Unsure whom to trust, Allegra cuts off contact with everyone 
except Ted, enlisting his help to repair the prototype game pod that was 
damaged in the attack. With great misgivings, Ted agrees to be fitted 
with a "bio port" and the couple sets off on a virtual reality recovery 
mission.
Unfortunately, Cronenberg's virtual worlds are considerably less 
interesting than the real one. Allegra and Ted spend a great portion of 
the film encountering cryptic figures in a trout farm and a Chinese 
restaurant. Everyone chases each other around while brandishing organic 
guns that shoot teeth, Allegra rubs things a lot and bonds with a two-
headed sort-of salamander and, when not fighting or making out, the 
couple wonders whether they've reached reality or just another level of 
the game. Trust me, this description reads more exciting that it plays 
out onscreen.
Although only 97 minutes long, "eXistenZ" plods terribly before stumbling 
to its trite conclusion. Along the way, a great cast is wasted. Wonderful 
actors like Willem Dafoe, Ian Holm and Sarah Polley are given throwaway 
parts and Jude Law is saddled with a terminally bland role. Remember the 
moment in "The Matrix" when Keanu Reeves says "Whoa?" Law's character 
basically stays at that level of emotional development for the entire 
movie. Only Jennifer Jason Leigh, as the shy adventurer, plays a fully-
fleshed out human being. She's good, but not good enough to salvage this 
production. 
"eXistenZ" has some redeeming qualities. The score is good and the 
opening scene features some nice moments. Satiric jabs at marketing and 
consumerism are scattered, too infrequently, throughout the story, and 
there is a dandy sequence where several game users critique their own 
virtual characters. But "eXistenZ" is smothered by lousy pacing and an 
awful "been-there, done-that" feeling. Cautionary tales about virtual 
reality have already been covered quite nicely, David Lynch handled 
weirdness more stylishly in any given episode of "Twin Peaks," and 
Cronenberg's gross-out visuals and freaky sexuality are old news. 
Hopefully, before making his next movie, Cronenberg will review "The Dead 
Zone" or "The Fly" and remember how well he can handle the horror genre. 
Or, better yet, maybe he'll take a walk on a sunny day and try to capture 
its essence on film. For the King of Ick, what an accomplishment that 
would be.

Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.
     David Cronenberg's eXistenZ may be as thematically dense a film as
we'll see all year.  It touches on the nature of reality, and the ways we
seek to escape it and embrace it at the same time.  It addresses issues of
violence in the media, as well as the nature of constructing a work of
fiction.  It's a cautionary tale, and a caution against excessive caution.
It's a social satire, and even a self-satire.  It's also, ultimately, a
sinkhole for narrative and characterization.  Cronenberg has created an
emotionally weightless intellectual exercise that's fun to parse but
little fun to watch.
     eXistenZ begins with what amounts to a preview screening for a new
cutting edge virtual reality game called eXistenZ, designed by reclusive
gaming genius Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh).  Before she can begin
the first demonstration, however, Allegra is the target of an
assassination attempt by a radical anti-virtual reality terrorist.
Accompanied by Ted Pikul (Jude Law), the game company's marketing intern,
as her impromptu bodyguard, Allegra heads into the countryside to see if
her eXistenZ prototype game module -- damaged in the assassination attempt
-- can be saved.  The only way to test that, of course, is to play the
game, leading Allegra and Ted to discover a world almost too similar to
the "real world" to tell the difference.
     If you know your Cronenberg (VIDEODROME, THE FLY, CRASH) at all, you
know that you're entering a decidedly freaky realm.  The world of eXistenZ
includes pseudo-organic game pods that plug into the users' spines through
a "bio-port" and a big umbilical cord; it features a pistol made of flesh
and bone that fires human teeth (all the better to escape detection).
Those who got off on the head-trippy kinkiness of CRASH will find
themselves quite comfortable with a film in which characters get frisky
with the holes in each other's backs, and where a meal in a Chinese
restaurant consists of mutant amphibians sucked right off the skeleton.
     Those same viewers may also find themselves wrapped up in
deconstructing Cronenberg's various messages.  The design of the game pods
-- which none-too-subtly resemble a compilation of erogenous zones --
turns into a poke at the masturbatory nature of video games, while
Allegra's writhing response to "plugging in" adds drug addiction to the
metaphorical layering.  The story treats us to characters who commit
violence in the real world while thinking they're still in a game world
-- a creepy, timely commentary on the influence of pop culture violence --
then takes a swipe at the actions of the neo-Luddite anti-game faction.
Perhaps most amusingly, eXistenZ plays with how characters behave in a
fictional world, extending by implication to the plot-advancing
conventions in film itself.  There's enough sub-text in eXistenZ to keep a
viewer well-occupied for its 97 minutes.
     If only Cronenberg had bothered to bring along any actual text to
flesh out that subtext.  eXistenZ plays out like a scholarly analysis of
itself, a cinematic Cliff's Notes for a novel that doesn't actually exist.
Leigh and Law are as purely functional in their roles as their characters
are in their game-roles, and while Cronenberg may find that little
meta-joke amusing, for a viewer it's merely distracting.  By the time the
plot of eXistenZ starts folding in on itself (leading to a revelation
that's not at all revelatory if you've been paying attention), you may
find yourself wondering why you should care about any of it.  Cronenberg
is as stylistically distinctive a film-maker as we have in this
cookie-cutter era, but he's locked himself into a rut of message-filled
visions with no human connection.  eXistenZ plays out like a hallucinatory
letter to the editor.

rated R
starring Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jude Law, Willem Dafoe, Ian Holm, Don
McKellar, Callum Keith
Rennie, Sarah Polley, Christopher Eccleston, Willem Dafoe
written and directed by David Cronenberg
I find it a bit ironic that while THE MATRIX is racking in huge
numbers at the box office, David Cronenberg's similar, astonishing
EXISTENZ can't even crack the top 10. But even if EXISTENZ disappears
into obscurity, it is not a film that I will easily forget.
To give away too much of EXISTENZ' plot would be a sin, but I will
provide for you the initial setup. Jennifer Jason Leigh makes her big
screen return, after a 2-year hiatus(does anyone remember A THOUSAND
ACRES? I didn't think so), as Allegra Geller, who, sometime in the
near future, is the world's most distinguished virtual reality game
designer. A group of people have been gathered into a room to test her
newest adventure, called eXistenZ. The meeting turns into chaos, and
Allegra is forced to flee with her bodyguard(Jude Law).
The game of eXistenZ is not the normal virtual reality game that you
would find in stores today. In eXistenZ, you are living the game, and
at times your mind begins to lose grasp on the difference between the
game and reality. THE MATRIX made a similar point in a more
complicated way, that sometimes the lines of reality are
blurred. EXISTENZ ends up playing like an indie version of THE MATRIX
that spends more time on smarts than on violence.
While EXISTENZ is not as showy as THE MATRIX, its ending is much more
thought-provoking.  1999 is turning out to be the year that sci/fi
makes its big return. I am definitely not a sci/fi buff, but with
EXISTENZ and THE MATRIX being released even before the new STAR WARS,
this year looks to be the year of science-fiction.
EXISTENZ not only marks the return of Jennifer Jason Leigh, but it is
also the first film that David Cronenberg has made since 1996's erotic
car crash thriller(?) CRASH. The Canadian filmmaker is known for his
unique visual sense, and his ability to create new worlds.  EXISTENZ
is one of his very best films. Also, Ian Holm and Sarah Polley(both of
THE SWEET HEREAFTER) have small roles, proving that when you put those
two in a movie together, good things happen. EXISTENZ is not a perfect
film, but it will be remembered by me as one of the year's best.

 With violent video games currently under scrutiny in light of the
tragedy in Colorado, writer-director David Cronenberg's "eXistenZ" has
probably taken on a timeliness its author could never have anticipated.
But teetering on the cutting edge is hardly an unfamiliar position for
Cronenberg, whose 1982 shocker "Videodrome" prophetically warned about
the desensitization of viewers fed a steady diet of violent or
pornographic films, and whose 1986 remake of "The Fly" is often read as
an allegory about the AIDS crisis.
 "eXistenZ," which is almost lightweight in comparison to other
Cronenberg creations, spins a genuinely jolting yarn about world-famous
game designer Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh), whose latest
breakthrough is a kill-or-be-killed program that's downloaded directly
into the body through a port in the base of the player's spine. Even the
controllers look like flattened-out, misshapen breasts. The problem with
the new technology is that it's too realistic, too convincing. Allegra
and her partner (Jude Law) finally get so swept up in what's going on
they can't tell if they're in the real world or the virtual world.
Through some clever twists, Cronenberg eventually succeeds in making the
audience feel as disoriented as Allegra, uncertain of what to believe at
any given time.
 Leigh, who couldn't underplay a part if she tried, envisions Allegra as
a kind of electronic junkie who shivers and writhes in ecstacy as she
plugs into the electronic drug she's created; to further underscore the
connection, the wires that link her to the source look uncannily like
umbilical cords. The rallying cry of Cronenberg's characters in
"Videodrome" was "Long live the new flesh!", but almost two decades
later the taut and tricky "eXistenZ" argues that sometimes progress can
take us to places we might have been better off avoiding altogether.

   While I was watching David Cronenberg's latest sci-fi-
horror tale I got to thinking about a character in Georg
Buchner's expressionistic drama "Woyzeck."  The title person
in that play is a stupid soldier trying to make sense out of life,
a man who is exploited by his girl friend and his superior
officers.  One day, while he is cutting the hair of his
commanding officer, the captain surprises Woyzeck by
expressing envy of him.  "You don't know what it's like to be
in the shoes of an intelligent person," he complains.  I have
to think about ways to spend the long waking hours of my
days.  I'm frightfully bored."  The captain's assumption,
however questionable, is that folks of lesser intelligence are
like, say, cats.  They can spend time alone without reading,
without watching TV, and they seem not to get weary of life. 
Most of us human beings, though--particularly those with jobs
that do not greatly challenge us--have to dream up ways to
occupy ourselves constructively in order to make time pass
quickly.  The great paradox of life is that the faster time goes
by, the better use you are making of your existence.  And the
key to this nirvana is to become wholly involved in what
you're doing.
   What do you do to become wholly involved?  If you're
lucky, you have exciting work that allows you to begin at 9,
spend what seems like an hour on the job, and, poof: it's 5
o'clock.  There are other means of becoming absorbed,
immersed, engrossed.  Reading.  Theater.  Inspiring
relationships with other people, both physical and intellectual.
Movies.  Interactive computing.  And now, with the approach
of the millennium, newer and better amusements involving
virtual reality.  You hook up to a gadget and are plunged into
a world of illusion not unlike your dreams.  In the near future,
you may plug the cord not into the wall but into yourself in
order to become totally a part of this dreamworld.  Like Alice
in Wonderland you submerge deeper and deeper into a hole
into a strange land.  Do this enough and you will have
increasing difficulty separating your real life from your
illusions.  This brings us to "eXistenZ," an illusory adventure
that takes twelve of Cronenberg's characters away from their
everyday routines and plunges them together into a kind of
acid trip.  
   In the plot, volunteers have agreed to become guinea pigs
for a beta testing of a game called eXistenZ, created by
Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh)--who is considered the
world's foremost designer of games of virtual reality.  We
learn early on that Allegra, like so many compulsive computer
nerds, is a shy person who likes to surrender her real self to
her "game character," in which she can say and do whatever
comes to mind.  Two players are in every scene, Allegra and
Ted Pikul (Jude Law), the latter a reluctant and equally shy
fellow who acts as Allegra's security guard and is not at all
eager to participate in eXistenZ.  He fears the pain of having
a hole drilled into his spine for the insertion of an umbilical
cord to which a "pod" is attached and has doubts about
abdicating control to his game character.  During their
adventures together in what becomes a Cronenbergian
nightmare, Ted and Allegra are pursued by a group of
terrorists whose goal is to destroy the makers of "satanic"
games, and because of the presence of moles, they are
unsure who their friends are and whom they should avoid.  Is
Gas (Willem Dafoe), a friend or foe?  He seems the former,
as he is able to repair a defective pod and hook up the two
principals.  What about Kiri Vinokur (Ian Holm), a scientist
who is experimenting with eerie-looking creatures, one of
which resembles a beating heart on which he is operating?  
   The most frightening scene occurs in a Chinese restaurant
to which Allegra and Ted have repaired following a half day
of work in a trout-processing plant.  Allegra suspects that the
waiter, a particularly friendly guy who recommends bass but
who brings them the day's special, is a terrorist bent on
destorying her games.  When she orders Ted to shoot the
server with a gun he puts together comically from the
creatures that make up the dish, Ted hesitates before
blowing the man away.
   The principal gimmick of the movie is that neither we nor
the players know when they are in the game or when they
have returned to reality.  At one point Ted calls a time out,
plunging Allegra and him from the restaurant to a bed in a ski
lodge.  Is the lodge part of the game or are they back in their
real lives?
   The object of this allegorical fable is obviously enough to
warn us partly about the dangers of technology in general but
specifically about the hazards of spending too much time
playing computer games.  To get a life, Cronenberg only
indirectly suggests, we should spend more time nurturing
human relationships--not by e-mailing or instant-
messengering cyberfriends but by getting in touch with them,
flesh to flesh, and solving the Big Problem "what shall we do
with all the time the time on our hands" by fostering
friendships.  Any attempt to give in to shyness and give
ourselves over to the glitter of mechanical substitutes will
further our neuroses and lead to the mayhem to which Ted
and Allegra become privy.
   This is a worthy theme to tackle, and Cronenberg seizes
the day with the style which has become his trademark from
movies like "The Fly," "The Dead Zone," and especially
"Videodrome"--sleazy sets, slimy creatures, Frankenstein-
style machinery, Kafkaesque ambiance, and in this case a
dazzlingly eerie soundtrack that does much to further
suspense and anticipation.  Though the movie is involving
enough, what is unusual is that the opening one-third--the
part that takes place apparently before the virtual reality
game has begun--is more absorbing that the balance.  If the
great Canadian director has made the realistic segment the
most arresting portion of the film, has he succeeded as in the
past in portraying the intensity of mutated existence? 
Unfortunately, while "eXistenZ" is far superior to some of his
relative failures like "Naked Lunch," we cannot put this movie
in the same class as his model study of human frailty and
decay, "The Fly," nor is Jude Law in any way as compelling a
performer as the great Jeff Goldblum.  But Jennifer Jason
Leigh, who in the past loved to play the absolute cynic with
curled lip and gutteral voice, has never looked and sounded
sexier.  Though early reviews warned us about shocking
bodily flowerings, there is nothing in this film that is scarier
than a plate of mildly mutated lobster and crabs nor is a hole
drilled in the spine to which a cord is inserted a particularly
hair-raising image.
   Let's hope in any case that Cronenberg does not succeed 
in having his warning taken too seriously by the audience. If
he does, look for a precipitous fall-off of the weekly movie
audience as people stop passing time gazing at the big
screen and instead visit one another to cultivate their human
relationships.

David Cronenberg's latest biotechnical carny show aims its sights squarely 
at Internet addicts and video-game junkies.  While the idea of people so 
dissociated from reality that they spend all their 'quality time' within an 
artificial environment has rapidly become overworked, Cronenberg still 
manages to come up with something that looks new.  Jennifer Jason Leigh 
plays a designer of ultra-sophisiticated virtual reality games (virtual 
actuality??), worshiped by players everywhere as if she were Lana Croft 
incarnate.  But you can't be this good at something and not expect to draw 
attention, so Leigh finds herself fleeing industrial assassins and 'reality 
activists' intent on sabotaging her latest multi-million dollar project.  
She and fellow fugitive Jude Law hardwire  themselves into the alternate 
universe of this game - 'eXistenZ' - as part of a routine diagnostic.  Soon 
they find more than they bargained for:  they discover  another new and 
sophisticated game within eXistenZ which, as players, they must once again 
plug themselves into, and....you get the picture.  By this time, walls of 
reality have truly dissolved.
The opening of eXistenZ indicates a computer-game version of Cronenberg's 
VIDEODROME - as a director he is well-known for his provocative recurring 
themes (mutation, the bonding of flesh and technology, surgery, hospitals, 
bodies in revolt) and it initially appears that we're about to get a more 
considered reworking of his earlier films.  It's the same, but different: 
firstly, the cyberspace setting is new territory for Cronenberg, but 
secondly (and more noticeably) his approach is considerably lighter.  
eXistenZ is the funniest thing he has ever put on screen - I would have 
never expected to see an audience having such an openly good time with a one 
of his films until now!  Of course, the humor of eXistenZ is pretty skewed - 
those familiar with the director's work will realize that they're laughing 
at the same gooey, organic gross-outs that he used to unsettle everyone with 
in his other movies.  One man buys a copy of a you-be-the-victim car 
accident game and we're instantly reminded of the director's previous CRASH, 
and the furore about the violent automobile games released in its wake.  
Even the cry "Death to enemies of reality" seems to be a lampoon of previous 
rantings about 'the new flesh' .  And if the line "Trust no one!", delivered 
in all seriousness, isn't a poke at the X-FILES, I don't know what is.  Even 
Leigh and Law try to loosen up and enjoy the game, even though Law figures 
there is something sick and wrong about it all (for this is Cronenberg 
country, after all, and cyberspace is not a spotless, computer-generated 
playing platform but a decayed, visceral fug).
And then of course there's all that sex, even though the characters never 
actually get down to having any.  eXistenZ oozes sex continuously, with one 
hilarious metaphor after another thrown up on screen with abandon.  Given 
Cronenberg's past history of equating sex with disease and death, this film 
must surely be seen as a kind of personal liberation.

For all its awe-inspiring gee-wizardry, the common perception of virtual
reality remains as that of a rather cold, technical concept.  As seen in
reality and as depicted in the movies, VR enables one to do things one
would never otherwise be able to, but it pretty much boils down to doing
next to nothing: just lying still, with cumbersome gear strapped onto the
eyes and different places on the body.
Leave it to writer-director David Cronenberg to turn conventional
perception on its ear.  His latest film, _eXistenZ_, is indeed part of
the recent crop of VR-themed thrillers, but Cronenberg's take on the
concept is truly unlike anything ever seen.  _eXistenZ_ takes its name
from a virtual reality system created by Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason
Leigh), a world-famous game designer.  The virtual world explored in
eXistenZ--and, in turn, _eXistenZ_--is nothing particularly new or
visually spectacular: more or less, it's a duplication of the actual
world, except with seamless, if abrupt, shifts in time and place. 
Neither is Cronenberg's plot terribly ambitious.  Fundamentally, the
story simply has Allegra and her makeshift bodyguard Ted Pikul (Jude Law,
sporting a flawless Canadian accent) on the run from assassins who want
to see "the demoness Allegra" dead.  Eventually, the two retreat into
eXistenZ, a world that may actually be more "real" than the one they live
in.
Cronenberg's main concern, however, is not so much in the intentionally
video-game-thin story, but in the finer details, most notably in the
nature of the eXistenZ system itself.  There is no heavy headgear,
gloves, wires, or the like; in their place is a soft, kidney-shaped
GamePod, connected to an UmbyCord, which is exactly as it sounds: long,
thick, and fleshy.  It would be tempting to call the eXistenZ system
"biomechanical," but there's nothing "mechanical" or electronic about it;
the GamePod appears to be a natural living organism in itself, undulating
and gurgling as if it had a mind of its own.  Further blurring the line
between nature and technology is the GamePod's power source: the human
nervous system.  The UmbyCord is plugged into a BioPort, which is a hole
drilled into a player's lower back, tapping directly into the spinal
column.
Making the human body part of the equipment not only adds a certain
creepiness, but also a dimension of perverse eroticism.  Before being
inserted, both the tip of the UmbyCord and the BioPort must be moistened,
and when the BioPort is penetrated by the UmbyCord--or anything else, for
that matter--it gets visibly stimulated.  Mere connection does not mean
entrance into eXistenZ; one must also stroke the moist, nipple-like knobs
on the GamePod.  This sensual caressing of the GamePod goes on as one is
in the game.
The blatantly sexual overtones are just one bizarre detail of
Cronenberg's fascinating, if unsettling, vision.  There is a great deal
of gore in _eXistenZ_, most of all in Allegra and Ted's game, where
mutant amphibians figure prominently--or, rather, their remains.  Their
dead bodies are gruesomely mined for their innards, which are used to
build GamePods in a slaughterhouse called a Trout Farm; they also turn up
on the unappetizing menu of a Chinese restaurant.  The slimy stickiness
could easily be pegged as cheap sensationalism, but it plays an integral
and sometimes surprising part in Cronenberg's larger picture.
Playing a weaker part in that larger picture is the story, which, while
superficially engaging, never adds up to much.  I won't give away its
conclusion, which was met with some boos at my audience, but it
essentially reveals _eXistenZ_ as one big tease--which, I believe, is the
point.  What matters to Cronenberg is the imaginative trip on which his
film takes its audience and the eerie feeling of unease it leaves with
them at the end.  In that sense, _eXistenZ_, like its namesake, is one
big game, but it is definitely one worth playing--or, rather, one to be
played _by_.

Plot: An assassination attempt is made on celebrity virtual reality games 
designer Allegra Geller as she premieres her new VR game eXistenZ in a  
church. She flees, accompanied by her appointed security aide, Antenna 
Research corporate intern Ted Pikul. Attempting to introduce the VR neophyte 
Ted to her work, she has him implanted with one of the spinal bio-ports into 
which the organic consoles plug. But once inside eXistenZ, they are drawn 
into a disturbing game between two rival factions that are seeking to gain 
control of the game where they are no longer sure what is real and what is 
illusion.
If 1998's big theme was asteroid collision and tv-turned-reality movies and 
1997's was volcano disaster movies and 1996's was big budget alien invasion 
films, then this year's trend is shaping up to be Virtual Reality movies - 
what with The Matrix', eXistenZ' and the upcoming The Thirteenth Floor'.
eXistenZ' is the second of the year's VR movies. Although jumping on the 
Virtual Reality trend, or any type of bandwagon, is never exactly something 
you could accuse Canadian director David Cronenberg of doing. Cronenberg is 
probably one of the most unique and original voices in the sf/horror genre. 
His body of work - which ranges from Stereo' (1969), Crimes of the Future' 
(1970), Shivers' aka They Came from Within/The Parasite Murders' (1974), 
Rabid' (1976), The Brood' (1979), Fast Company' (1979), Scanners' 
(1981), Videodrome' (1983), The Dead Zone' (1983), The Fly' (1986), Dead 
Ringers' (1988), Naked Lunch' (1991), M. Butterfly' (1993) and Crash' 
(1996) (with all bar Fast Company' and M. Butterfly' being sf-horror 
works) - is something that rings with a voice of startling originality. 
Throughout Cronenberg's work runs a fascination with bodily horrors - he 
could be accused of being the first Manichean horror film-maker. Cronenberg 
regularly crafts striking metaphoric images - be it a woman's body being 
taken over by a vampiric organ under her armpit in Rabid'; psychological 
repressions manifesting themselves in flesh form in The Brood' or the 
scientist slowly melding into a fly in The Fly'. But, unlike any classic 
horror film, the process of mutation, indeed the mad scientists themselves, 
in Cronenberg's oeuvre, are rarely processes of horror in any established 
sense - they are ones that seem to be welcomed as transformational 
experiences by the victims. In The Fly', for example, the protagonist 
welcomes his transformation with an eager scientific fascination; in 
Videodrome' and Crash' we see people integrating with tv's and cars in 
ways that offer perverse new combinations of humanity and technology.
eXistenZ' is Cronenberg's most overtly commercial film in more than a 
decade. From Dead Ringers' onward Cronenberg has determinedly pushed 
boundaries in terms of sheer perversity while having left behind any easy 
pigeonholing as a genre director. His adaptations of Naked Lunch', William 
S. Burroughs' surreal and plotless ramble through drugs and homosexuality, 
and Crash', J.G. Ballard's work of auto'-eroticism, have been 
controversial to the say the least, being dogged by jittery financiers and 
distributors, while his mainstream adaptation of M. Butterfly' was a 
commercial flop. During this time Cronenberg's career was on such shaky 
financial ground he was been forced to make ends meet by working as an actor 
in films like Nightbreed' (1990), To Die For' (1995), Extreme Measures' 
(1996) and Last Night' (1998).
Amid the dross that is being churned out on in the name of Virtual Reality 
cinema, one looks with interest to see what Cronenberg's peculiarly carnal 
fascinations would bring to the subject. His fascination with bio-technology 
immediately starts to creep in. Instead of keyboards people manipulate 
consoles that look like sheep's bladders which are attached via an 
intestine-like cable to a puckered orifice in the spinal column. Naturally 
being Cronenberg, the spinal bio-port orifice is played up for maximum 
sexual imagery with people seen tonguing and fingering it. Meanwhile 
assassains wield guns that are made out of human bone and tissue, in order 
to get past metal detectors, and which fire teeth. The start of the film 
with the assassination attempt, the flight and the encounter with Willem 
Dafoe (in an amusing cameo that in any lesser budgeted film should be 
mandatorily played by Brad Dourif) is engrossing. It is all aided by a 
marvellously brooding and oppressive score from regular Cronenberg 
collaborator Howard Shore.
The first entry into VR doesn't come until nearly 30 minutes into the film 
and is well led up to. But thereafter the film sorts of falls apart. In fact 
for the high standards that one expected of Cronenberg, the script falls 
into some of the more disappointingly hackneyed cliches that has dogged the 
VR film. Like engaging in the series of perpetual flips where people are 
wondering if the game is over yet and what is assumed to be reality is 
intruded in upon - Total Recall' (1990) (a disappointing treatment of the 
VR theme which incidentally was originally to have been made by Cronenberg) 
did these types of flips with far greater dexterity than Cronenberg does 
here. There's a labyrinthine (and never entirely clear) plot (reminiscent of 
the 1993 tv mini-series Wild Palms') involving two different factions 
trying to, for reasons obscure, gain control of the VR game. As one of the 
character's eventually says "There are too many twists going on to follow." 
Indeed the rules of the VR game eXistenZ' are never spelt out. Nor does 
what happen ever seem particularly game-like - Cronenberg seems to have 
taken a leaf from the book of David Lynch in having people standing about 
muttering surreal non-sequitirs in arch deadpan. The VR sequences are not 
without their amusements - like when the two leads find themselves 
controlled by character development and being forced into a gratuitous love 
scene. But when the film ends on what has rapidly become the VR equivalent 
of the old "It was all a dream" twist ending, one wants to yell at 
Cronenberg at the corniness of the device.
eXistenZ' feels like Cronenberg's least personal and most routine film 
since his adaptation of Stephen King's The Dead Zone'. It feels less like a 
Cronenberg film than like a film in which a by-the-numbers VR plot has had a 
handful of Cronenbergian imagery grafted onto it. And when one looks for the 
characteristically perverse Cronenbergian flourishes, the imagery seems 
conspicuously lacking in any of the vividity of scenes in past Cronenberg 
films - like Samantha Eggar's brood of external foetuses in The Brood'; the 
wonderfully queasy image in Videodrome' of James Woods tentatively poking a 
gun inside the hole in his stomach then losing it; or in Crash' of James 
Spader having sex wherein he treats the wound in Rosanna Arquette's leg as a 
substitute vagina. Even the most vivid image of the organic gun here seems 
to be one that Cronenberg has cannibalized from the image of the literal 
hand-gun' fusion in Videodrome'.

First there was Tron, the movie and the videogame. Next came The Last
Starfighter, where life was a videogame, more or less. Soon enough cyberpunk
reigned and Johnny Mnemonic was born into the neuroscape of virtual reality;
not long after, virtual reality gave birth itself, and Russell Crowe got to
play the 'perfect' killer in the aptly-named Virtuosity. But of course
people have been slipping between dimensions and realities and timeframes
and worlds since Rod Serling. However, nine times out of ten it's just a
gimmick, and any of that good old Twilight Zone paranoia ('is this really
real?') is scuttled in favor of effects. But now David Cronenberg is taking
a graphic stab at the whole thing, and he brings nothing to the table if not
a fundamental--and contagious--distrust of reality.
His eXistenZ is set either in some alternate world or the near future. For
purposes of the movie, it doesn't really matter. Suffice it to say that it's
a reality where a two-headed frog / salamander / lizard is a 'sign of the
times.' Too, everyone walks around with 'bioports,' little jacks in the
lower spine which get umbilically attached to gamepods, which are themselves
made of metaflesh and seem to have gender. And everyone's addicted to the
games these gamepods allow, to the point that society has become
factionalized over them, has split into the 'realists' and the
'antirealists.' The realists like to space out and play games; the
antirealists don't. eXistenZ is the story of their ongoing skirmish.
But of course, too, it's more: these 'games' you can jack into aren't just
Pac-Man or Galaga with fancy joysticks, but are indistinguishable from real
life. As one of the characters says, "You have to play to figure out why
you're playing," or even if you're playing. Add to that the fact that,
within the game, you can jack into another game--thus going deeper and
deeper--and pretty soon you wonder if where you started in the first place
was really real or not. This is what world-famed game-designer / artist
Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and her impromptu bodyguard Ted (Jude
Law) have to deal with, claw their way out of, etc.
It all starts when someone sneaks a 'bio' gun into a video-game marketing
seminar and shoots Allegra with a human tooth. Sounds crazy yes, but then
you should see the gun (as this is Cronenberg, too, there's no shortage of
pistols pulled from strange places). So, on the run now, Allegra and Ted,
naturally, jack into the game--ostensibly to check it out, but really just
to give all the bad guys a chance to run them ragged in virtual reality.
It's pretty cool for awhile, and, to Cronenberg's credit as a writer,
everytime it begins to flatten out he ups the (regression-)ante just a
little more, either by having causality cross the reality-boundary (per Lost
Highway, which has a very similar, impenetrable logic) or having identities
shift, per Total Recall (or, more specifically, another Philip K. Dick
work--Maze of Death, which eXistenZ pretty much is). Or, talking 'straight'
movies, Fincher's The Game, another case where the main character's never
quite sure what's real. In The Game, however, Fincher eventually makes the
world safe again, by putting a stop to all the regression, reestablishing a
consensual baseline. Not so with eXistenZ. This is Cronenberg, after all.
Just because it only takes 97 minutes to wrap things up, don't be fooled
into thinking it's safe. In a movie where you can build a sidearm from
dinner scraps, everything's dangerous.

Freakish, out there science fiction films seem to be a trend. While some of
these movies are good (The Matrix), there are also ones that have their
downsides (The Thirteen Floor). Released around the same time, eXistenZ (that's
pronounced X-SEH-STENZ) is the most unique of all. Alternate universes have
never been more interesting. The movie does such a good job of blending reality
with a game that the line is almost impossible to trace. Get ready for a wild
ride, worthy of several multiple viewings.
Allegra Gellar (Leigh whose wardrobe is less then spectacular) is the world's
greatest game designer. During a test for her new game eXistenZ, something does
horribly wrong, an assassin shoots her and her game pod. She flees with
security guard Ted Pikul (Law) and the two go into hiding. Ted hasn't had the
operation for a bioport, a small hole in your back that you fit the game pod's
chord into. They need to get him one so that Allegra can play eXistenZ with
him, and make sure the only copy of her precious creation wasn't damaged by the
aforementioned assassin. They are transported into the game with new
identities, constantly going in and out of reality and the imaginary. In the
game, they begin working at a game pod manufacturing plant, Ted chops up
various parts of lizards for the pods, and Allegra is a scientist who assembles
them. This is just the beginning of a wild chase through multiple realities,
true identities, and one horrific game called eXistenZ.
This movie really packs a punch. Everything in the movie looks great (except
for Jennifer's horrific hair) and multiple dimension travel is made somewhat
believable. The performances are above what is expected for a science fiction
film. Jude Law is an excellent actor who is good in this movie despite it's
strange premise. He's really showing quite an acting range. Poor Jennifer Jason
Leigh, she can't do much in this movie, and her performance is the main letdown
of the film. Willem DaFoe and Sarah Polley also make impressions in small
roles. The sexual innuendo is interesting too. The gaming pods can't quite be
described in words, think of them as squirming pink things that look like
tumors. Also notice how the umbilical like chords reach into the backs of the
game players. This has to be one of the weirdest films to come along in a while
and it's limited theatrical release makes it a must rent video. I urge you to
rent this great film, that asks the question...

David Cronenberg takes a little time off before his official designation as
president of the 1999 Cannes Film Festival, and presents us with another
strange tale crawling out of his impressively twisted head. Shot in his
hometown of Toronto, David tosses in a little more Canadian content by the
way of Sarah Polley, and delivers his possibly over-saturated version of
alternate realities into the cinematic community. Think THE GAME (8.5/10)
meeting STRANGE DAYS (8.5/10) in a dark, creepy alley.
PLOT:
Futuristic virtual reality game super-creator Alegra Geller, runs into
opposition from people who call themselves "realists", who not appreciate
the propagation of her makeshift universe games, including her latest and
greatest one, called eXistenZ. Joined by her "bodyguard", Alegra runs
through her own game and her characters, in the hopes of escaping her
enemies.
CRITIQUE:
Dark, moody, interesting science-fiction melange of creative plot twists,
solid actors, an inventive and fresh premise despite my initial "been there,
seen that" resentment, and a truckload of gory, icky sequences accompanied
hand in hand by disgusting, yet overdone, squishy noises. This film managed
to keep me interested in its development, despite several moments of "are
they still in the game?" frustrations, and stamped a vote onto my approval
with a fun and appropriate conclusion. This movie is definitely not for
everyone. It's pretty graphic in its depiction of several skin-crawly
scenes, but does convince in its depiction of the futuristic world, and
their maneuverability within. Consider yourself in a game where everyone
else is programmed to react to what you do or say, and without any
cognizance of your own mission, and you might just get the gist of this
flick's foundation.
Be warned, this movie does not have much action in it, despite what the
electro-music-fooled trailer might have you believe, but it does put forth
an intriguing prophesy of our future, and deliver enough indirect
explanations to satisfy my peeked curiosity. And while most of the actors
were fine in their roles (I especially dig on Willem Dafoe in his most
psycho roles, and this one is pretty sweet), they aren't really the focus of
this story. The game of eXistenZ, the power of its creation and the
claustrophobic feel of the film make it a touch better than any other
play-by-numbers virtual reality trip. If you're any kind of a squeamish
person, or looking for the Kung-Fu and special-effect action a la THE MATRIX
(7.5/10), skip this sucker altogether, it is not for you. If, on the other
hand, you like dark and creepy films that play with your head and move along
at an even pace with twists and turns here and there, check this puppy out.
Just remember to check your back for port drillings before you leave the
theatre. You never know how real eXistenZ can be.

Virtual Reality is a hot film topic these days, and with his latest film
eXistenZ, writer-director David Cronenberg gives his take on the
subject.  While not a film for the squeamish (not many of his films
are), eXistenZ proves to be an  intriguing examination on the nature of
reality.
The film begins with a spelling lesson.  The title is "eXistenZ", not
"Existenz". This is explained to a marketing group which will be the
first to test the so-titled virtual reality game.  As an extra bonus,
the game's famous and reclusive designer, Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason
Leigh), will lead the test herself.
Allegra is reclusive for a good reason.  A group of "realists", who
oppose the concepts of virtual reality, have marked her for death.  No
place is safe, and soon Allegra is on the run with her "protector", a
trainee named Ted Pikul (Jude Law).
And that is when things truly start to get strange.  Allegra and Ted
decide to play eXistenZ themselves, looking for damaged code.  But, as
they continue to play, the lines between reality and virtual reality
begin to blur.  What is real and what is just a game?
Not content with the wires and electronics that typically come to mind
when one thinks of virtual reality, Cronenberg envisions a future of
computing composed entirely of organic technology.  Instead of cabling,
machines use umbilical cords.  Instead of keyboards, unidentifiable
organs.  Even the guns of the future are made of bone and gristle.  It
ain't pretty, but its certainly innovative.
The film certainly has attracted an outstanding supporting cast. Ian
Holm, Willem Dafoe, Christopher Eccleston and Sarah Polley are a few of
those who drift in and out of Allegra and Ted's experiences. Even though
their characters never amount to much, the cast  give their all and make
their roles fun, if not deep.
eXistenZ is well thought out...to a point.  At the end of the film,
everything finally seems to click together and make a cohesive whole.
Yet, at the end things are vaguely unsatisfying. Many of the characters
throughout seem like flimsy constructs, but on the other hand, that's
what some of them are supposed to be.  Still, a movie that gives so much
effort shouldn't feel this substanceless.
Fetishistic and disgusting at times, complicated yet lightweight at
others, eXistenZ is an unusual film to be sure, but one that is mostly
worth the trip.

Starring Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jude Law, Ian Holm, Willem Dafoe. Rated R.
It's odd how movies tend come in pairs or in threes. Last year we had two
asteroid movies and two computer animated movies about bugs open at about the
same time, and many Hollywood analysts have commented on the strangeness of
the situation. In 1999, we are lucky enough to receive three -- count 'em --
three movies about virtual reality and video games of the mind. The first of
the group was The Matrix, an exquisite, exciting thriller that still sticks
with me almost a month after I first saw it. In May, Roland Emmerich,
director of the abysmal Independence Day and Godzilla will produce The
Thirteenth Floor which seems very similar to The Matrix.
But even without having seen The Thirteenth Floor I can tell you right now
that the weirdest of the bunch is far and away David Cronenberg's eXistenZ
(pronounced sort of like "existence" but with the accent on the last
syllable), a genuinely odd, sexually charged meditation on distortion of our
perceptions, video games' increasing tendency to try and imitate reality as
well as -- perhaps -- the fear of sex. It is a movie that exists in almost a
dreamlike state, eminently watchable but too bizarre to really involve its
audience personally. That is not a criticism, but only a statement.
Allegra Geller, a hot young game designer is ready to try out her new virtual
reality game "eXistenZ," but not all goes as planned. Shouting out the
kitschy slogan "Death to the Demon Allegra Geller," a visitor attacks with a
gun made of flesh and bone. Fortunately, Geller and a guy named Ted (Jude
Law) are able to escape and hide out.
The game controllers called fleshpods are likewise made of flesh -- they're
living things. And to make sure that her game pod still works and that her
game is safe inside it, Geller decides to play a round with Ted.
Even though that doesn't sound like much of a plot, it is and you'll
understand why if you see this meticulously structured, deeply layered
vision. Canadian director David Cronenberg, who made last year's
controversially shallow Crash is out to frighten us in eXistenZ, with
fittingly gory, convincing effects as well as spooky ideas running throughout
the film.
Jennifer Jason Leigh gives an energetic performance as Allegra and the
charismatic Jude Law plays the opposite of his self-confident Gattaca
character in eXistenZ. Law's Ted is a video game virgin who is forced to
learn fast to perhaps save himself and Allegra. Ian Holm has a terrific
supporting role in the game -- he does a mean accent, even though I don't
know what accent that was supposed to be.
eXistenZ is curiously alluring. Despite the occasionally repulsive gore, the
movie's slow, steady pace and offbeat rhythm are almost hypnotic. David
Cronenberg did a very good job of making me interested in the plot while
keeping me slightly detached, at an observing distance, if you will, thus
letting the story work as an allegory more than a horror film or a thriller.
Cronenberg's deftness behind the camera, attractive performances from the
leads as well as a few subtle, hidden universal themes make eXistenZ a
keeper. And if he doesn't go back to the likes of Crash, David Cronenberg is
a keeper too. Š1999 Eugene Novikov
