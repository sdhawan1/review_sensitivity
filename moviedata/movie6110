Review:  Many, many fans of Japanese animation, consider AKIRA, an animated
adaption of the comic-book of the same title, at the time, to be one of the
finest animated films to come from the land of the Rising Sun.  Strangely,
however, it took me more than two viewings for me to get the message
surrounding this movie.
The story of how I saw the film begins in the summer of 1995, when I was 13
years old.  At the time, I was very interested in products that had come from
Japan.  I had owned a couple of videogame soundtracks, and was very fond of
Kitaro.  I was interested what Japnaese film scores was like.  That was when I
brought the soundtrack album to AKIRA.  It was arguably one of the most
impressive soundtracks I have ever heard.  Its mixture of synthesizer samples,
vocal chanting, and percussive instruments made it an experience unlike any
I've heard.  I was interested in seeing the film.
A few days later, I rented the movie from Palmer Video (This was a bad mistake
on my part, as my parents, at the time, did NOT permit me to watch movies
restricted for a mature audience, unless I had their approval.  In addition,
the video cover had NO warning that it was NOT FOR KIDS.)  I had no idea how
extremely dark (and violent) AKIRA was, nor was I really much of an Anime fan
(The only Anime I had seen, up until watching AKIRA, were THE BRAVE FROG, and
WINDARIA.  Okay, I also saw THE TRANSFORMERS:  THE MOVIE as well, and I guess
LITTLE NEMO:  ADVENTURES IN SLUMBERLAND can be counted as some other examples. 
I had also seen SECRET OF THE SEAL, SWAN LAKE, PUSS N BOOTS, SECRET OF THE
SEAL, and THE WIZARD OF OZ.  Years later, after AKIRA, around 1998, I saw the
FINAL FANTASY Anime, and after that, the fabulous ***** KIKI'S DELIVERY
SERVICE, and I had become somewhat involved in this totally different genre of
animation since then.  I know this seems like a bore, but I thought that you
probably might wanna know that about me).
So why was I both baffled and sick to my stomach after watching AKIRA?
Well, for starters, the storyline is SO complicated, I literally had to check
every source available to understand it.  However, from a visit to the AKIRA
ONLY website online, I was able to read (and download here) the storyline for
AKIRA.  It takes a strong mind to truly understand what is going on if you
don't have a clue what the storyline is, or even read the comic book which this
film is based on.  In addition, AKIRA is jampacked  and I really do mean
JAMPACKED  with an extreme amount of violence (as you will probably tell from
reading the synopsis of the film)
So, if you're one of those people who saw the film and was baffled by the
storyline, feel free to read on.  If you are not, be careful, because the
following *does* contain some spoilers (a thing I tend to give with my
reviews).  Don't say I didn't warn you
That said, this is how the story goes, as written by Matthew Zell for the 1989
Capricorn Anime Guide (Note that I've downloaded this article from the AKIRA
ONLY website, made a few changes, and added in some extra comments, for a more
entertaining, or perhaps gruesome, reading experience.):
The film opens with a helicopter shot of Tokyo, on July 16, 1988.  Flash
forward to 2019, after World War III (something I hope we never have), where
Tokyo had been completely destroyed.  Neo-Tokyo is constructed around the
remains of Tokyo  a crater which was caused by (presumably) the dropping of a
destructive bomb.
Next, we meet the story's protagonist, Kaneda, and his friends, a bunch of
juvenile delinquents.  They are bikers locked in a violent battle between a
rival group of bikers, called the clowns.  As they ride off into the night to
continue their battle (one of the most exciting scenes in the film), a man
holding what looks like a 100-year-old child attempts, unsuccessfully, to elude
the police.  When the man is shot and killed, the child, named Takashi, screams
and shatters the buildings around him.  The child escapes in the confusion
while Kay and Ryu, the dead man's friends, watch in amazement.  The Colonel
sets out with Masaru, another of these strange children, to find Takashi. 
While rioting crowds are subdued by the police with tear gas, Kaneda's rumble
continues. Tetsuo takes the lead and, after disposing of his opponents, nearly
has a collision with Takashi.  Tetsuo's bike suddenly explodes.  First Kaneda,
then the Colonel arrive.  Takashi and Tetsuo are taken while the rest of the
bikers are arrested.   
While Kaneda and his friends are being processed, he notices Kay's picture in
a book of wanted criminals.  After his interview, Kaneda spots Kay, who has yet
to be processed, in the hallway.  He manages to convince the officer to let him
take her with him.  Kaneda is beginnning to introduce himself when Kay spots
Ryu, who has also been arrested.  She eludes Kaneda so she can help her friend
escape.   
While analyzing him, the army doctors discover that Tetsuo's mind is
psychically active.  The Colonel orders Tetsuo to be held and taught to develop
his power.
We then discover that Kaneda and his friends are now attending some sort of
juvenile school.  In this sequence, we see a teacher punching each of the
bikers as he yells `Shut up!' at each of them.  Afterwords, the bikers shout
some really PROFANE insults towards the teacher, which I won't even bother to
go into detail about.  (Upon viewing this sequence to my mother, along with the
scene where the doctors are examining Tetsuo, she found it to be really
disturbing.  I can't say I blame her.)  After that, Kaneda and his friends are
joined by their girlfriends.  Tetsuo's girlfriend, Kaori, asks where her
boyfriend is, but Kaneda can only tell her that the army took him.
Later that night, Tetsuo escapes and meets Kaori, and they talk about going
someplace far away.  Apparently, Tetsuo has had enough of the torture he's
going through at the hospital, and so, next day, he and Kaori steal Kaneda's
bike and go for a ride.  They are spotted by the Clowns and pursued.  Tetsuo
and Kaori are both caught and tortured (This sequence involves Kaori getting
her front shirt ripped off where we see her front breasts.  Why did they have
to include this brief, but short, sexual attack in this scene?  It's pointless,
and it doesn't really do much of anything to tell the story, much less explain
what's going on.) but fortunately, Kaneda and his friends show up before
anything happens.  They capture one of the bikers, and Tetsuo beats him to
death.  Kaneda tries to stop his friend before he kills the guy.  Tetsuo whirls
on him and demands to know why Kaneda didn't help him escape from the hospital.
 It is here that we start to see a change in Tetsuo, as he screams out at
Kaneda and his friends, `You think I'm a loser!  It's not my fault I was
smaller!  Well there will come a day when I'll show all of you!  Don't you
forget it!'  Suddenly, upon hearing a voice say `Akira!', Tetsuo suffers from a
strange fit, and as a result we see some more grotesque images here; one of
which involves bloody guts of some sort spilling out of Tetsuo's chest(!). 
During all this, Tetsuo says, in bitter agony, `I'VE GOT AKIRA!!!'.  The army
shows up and carries him off again.
Later Kaneda sees Ryu and Kay after they have performed an act of terrorism.
He follows and helps Kay elude her army pursuers.   
While Tetsuo suffers nightmares in the hospital, yet another one of these
strange children meets the Colonel.  The girl, Kyoko, says she had a dream in
which she forsaw that Akira will awaken very soon.  This prompts the general to
pay a visit to Akira, who is frozen at 5 degrees Kelvin.
Kay takes Kaneda back to her hideout.  Kaneda is still going through his
`come-on' lines.  Ryu arrives and locks Kaneda up, believing him to be an army
spy.  They go into one of the other rooms where Ryu receives forged ID cards
which will allow them to pass the hospital security.  They are planning to
break into the hospital and kidnap another of the children.  Meanwhile, Kaneda
is caught while trying to escape and Ryu accuses him of spying on their
meeting.
Ryu meets with his boss, who is a member of the ruling council.  While they
discuss the planned attack, they observe a group of young people involved in a
religious ceremony worshipping Akira.
Later, at the council meeting, the Colonel meets with the other members, a
bunch of petty politicians, who tell him that he is spending too much money. 
They have funded the Akira Project for four years and there have been no
Results.  The Colonel tells them that he is already at his minimum expenditure
and warns of the dire consequences if they cut any further.  The council
ignores him, and he storms out.   
While Kaneda, Kay, and her group infitrate the hospital, Tetsuo's head begins
throbbing again.  He is assaulted by a series of illusions created by the
Children for the purpose of heightening his emotional distress and thereby
bringing forth his psychic powers.  (This sequence, which is probably the most
bizarre, involves cuddly stuffed animals - a teddy bear, a rag doll, and a
plush car - come to life and eventually mutate into larger versions, and what
follows after that I wouldn't dare mention it.) During this nightmarish
sequence, Tetsuo cuts his foot and the gruesomeness of the scene breaks the
children's concentration.  Tetsuo, who at this point has gone crazy, wants to
find the Children.  Suddenly, he knows how to find them.  While Tetsuo makes
his way to Room A, Kay and her friends are attacked in the sewers.  With help,
she and Kaneda steal one of the floating platforms and set off the find the
children.   
Tetsuo battles his way to Room A, while Kyoko tells Kaneda, through Kay, the
location of Room A.  Takashi and Masaru engage Tetsuo in an indecisive psychic
combat when the Colonel appears.  Tetsuo's head begins pounding again, and the
doctor tells him that if he would just cooperate, they could fix it.  Tetsuo
doesn't believe him. Kyoko tells Tetsuo that the most powerful of them, Akira,
had the same problem, but he found peace at last.  Tetsuo demands to know where
Akira is, and begins tearing the place apart to find him.  Kaneda arrives and
tells Tetsuo that he's come to rescue him (`Well, don't just stand there like a
dunce!  Hurry, come on, we've gotta get outta here!').  Tetsuo, resentful of
Kaneda's usually bad treatment (and they're supposed to be best friends!),
laughs at him (His laughter, at this point, is evil and crazy.  It must
probably be a part of the `powers' that he has acquired from his time at the
hospital) and tells Kaneda, `I don't think I'll be needing your help anymore,
if that's all right with you!  As a matter of fact, you might be needing MY
help!  When ya need a hand, just CALL, old buddy!'  He then confronts Kyoko and
pulls Akira's location, under the Olympic Stadium, from her mind.  He then
teleports himself out of the hospital.  (`Is this another one of my powers?'
Tetsuo asks, laughing hysterically, as he flies out the window.)
The Colonel sets out to deal with the menace when he is confronted by a
government agent.  He informs the Colonel that the council had decided to strip
him of command and have him arrested.  The Colonel resists and realizes he will
have to subdue the government so that he can deal with the crisis.
Tetsuo finds his way back to the usual hangout and asks the bartender for
`capsules', whatever that is. He then kills the bartender since he has no money
to pay for the drugs.  We don't actually see this happen, but we see the
results of it after Kaneda's friends, Yamagata and Kai, arrive at the bar, and
discover the destruction that Tetsuo caused. The drugs have had almost no
effect on him. Yamagata makes the mistake of offending Tetsuo, and crushed by a
refrigerator (and presumably killed by Tetsuo afterwards).
Imprisoned in the Hospital's detention area, Kay tries to explain to Kaneda
what little she knows of Akira and his awesome power.  Kyoko unlocks the cell
door and the pair escape.  (It also here that we get to see Kaneda quetsioning
Kay about her relationship with Ryo, and, like most of the characters in this
film, she shows a surly attitude about it.  Not that I blame her, though.)
Kaneda runs into Kai, who tells him what Tetsuo has done.  Kaneda takes
Yamagata's bike and smashes it, vowing revenge (He also says the B word as he
does so).  Takashi shows up and kidnaps Kay.  Kyoko warns Kaneda that the
consequences will be dire if Tetsuo isn't stopped.  Says Kaneda as he is about
to ride off on his bike to confront Tetsuo:  `I don't wanna keep the (No, I'm
not gonna say it) waiting!'
Meanwhile, Ryo's boss is trying to make his escape before the army can find
him. Ryu shows up and the panic-crazed councilman guns him down.  (We later see
the councilman die from choking on some pills that he takes while trying to
escape down an alley.) 
Tetsuo makes his way to the stadium, demolishing everything in its path.  Not
even the tanks from the army can stop him  the first one that fires ends up
creating a crater in the ground.  The doctor, who monitors Tetsuo's psychic
output, realizes that Tetsuo has become as powerful as Akira himself.  Tetsuo
arrives at Akira's cryogenic chamber and is confronted by Kay, who is being
controlled by the three Children.  She tells him that the power they have must
never be used, or a catastrophe will result.  Tetsuo, who finds all this to be
`utter stupidity!' attacks, and he and Kay have a terrible fight.  Tetsuo
prevails, only to discover that all that remains of Akira are some containers
filled with a print of his nervous system.   
Kaneda arrives, and they have a very nasty confrontation (via laser guns),
which culminates with Tetsuo's left arm completely amputated.  (The results of
this on the screen are REALLY bloody - I literally looked away from the screen
during this part!)  Later on, some sort of satellite from outer space
transports Tetsuo up and we see him get a bionic mechanical arm as a
replacement.  Later, Tetsuo sets himself up with the containers in the Olympic
Stadium.  Kaori enters looking for Tetsuo, and finds him writhing in pain. As
Tetsuo begins to loose control of his new arm (This is yet another
nightmarishly gruesome scene:  wires from Tetsuo's arm stretch out and
literally begin to crawl across the ground.), the Colonel arrives.  He tells
Tetsuo that his only hope for freedom from the intense pain is to return to the
hospital.  Tetsuo refuses and attacks first the Colonel, then Kaneda when he
arrives.
Then comes the moment where Tetsuo completely loses all control of his powers
and they go completely arwy, setting up yet another gory scene:  Tetsuo's body
literally mutates into a very gory, very large, and very grotesque mess.  His
voice, no longer sounding human, calls out for help to his friends, who of
course, can do nothing to help him.  In trying to reach out to Kaori, she gets
caught in his horribly mutated body and gets crushed to death.  `KAORI'S PAIN
IS INSIDE ME!!!' he screams.  Kaneda also gets caught, and he tries to get him
to stop, but Tetsuo is beyond controlling himself:  `MY BODY WON'T LISTEN TO
POWERS!!  KANEDA ESCAPE!!!!'  And he throws Kaneda out of the mess that his
body has become.
(Out of the many scenes in AKIRA, this one is the most horrifying  and
sickening  of them all.  However, there is a point that this scene is trying
to make:  we are not only horrified -and filled with pain- at Tetsuo's
transformation, first on the inside, then the outside as well, but we also feel
sorry for him  after all, this wasn't his fault.  Come to think of it, I can
relate to this kind of struggle, as I had a decision I had to make on whether
or not I was going to be a part of the real world, or stay forever enclosed in
my nutshell.)
During all this, the three Children appear and kneel before what remains of
Akira, calling for his help.  Suddenly, the bottles containing Akira burst open
and Akira regenerates himself.  (I was really quite surprised, and shocked to
discover that he is a `kid' like the Children.  I thought he'd be something
terrifying.  But then, we already have enough terrifying scenes like this.) 
His full power bursts forth, recreating the phenomenon that demolished Tokyo 38
years ago, giving Tetsuo the only peace he can ever know.
Kyoko teleports the Colonel to safety, but Kaneda is caught in the explosion. 
The Children sacrifice themselves to save him, as well as the whole world and
all of Neo-Tokyo.  Inside the explosion, Kaneda experiences several flashes of
Tetsuo's life:  Riding down the highway in Kaneda's wake, the strange
experiment that gave four ordinary children psychic ablities, and the first
time he met Kaneda.  This sequence culminates not only with Neo-Tokyo being
destroyed (well, not totally), but with Kaneda finding himself on a mound of
rubble in the middle of the wreckage, making peace with what remains of Tetsuo
 a bright dot of light  and reuniting with Kay and Kai.  We also see that the
colonel has survived the terrible apocalypse, having taken cover (along with
Kay and Kai) underneath the tunnel.  The apocaylpse is over, and as the sun
comes out through the clouds, Kaneda and his friends return to Neo-Tokyo.
We are then, at this point, supposed to realize that this is not an end, but a
beginning, as we hear the Children's voices:  `Someday, we will be.  It has
already begun.'
In a place that is no place (where we get some visuals that will leave one's
mouth hanging wide open), a voice is heard:  `I am Tetsuo.'
If the above has you baffled, and sick, I apologize, but that's what happens
throughout AKIRA.  What happens in the film is not terribly well explained, and
it will take only a strong mind (and stomach) to sit through two hours of
confusion and violence.  It was not until recently, when I viewed the film
again at the age of 18, on May 13, 2000, that I managed to acquire both and sit
through this film.  This time around, though, I wasn't as disturbed as I was
when I first viewed it five years ago.  I guess it takes time in order to do
certain things that you weren't able to do back then.
What struck me most about the film was the way it was trying to convey a
message, in spite of its gritty atmosphere.  Director Katsuhiro Ohtomo, who
wrote the original comic book, attempts to show us that humanity can be used
for both good and evil purposes.  But does he succeed in conveying what he
wants us to feel, or does he just deliver eyepopping visuals with an unclear
story?  I'm feeling like he succeeded in doing both.  While the storyline does
have a point, and the characters somewhat interesting (Like most Japanese
animated films, the characters here are not all bad or all good, but, well,
human.  The only real villain could be the powers that cause Tetsuo to go mad,
since it results with his presumed death at the end.), it is somewhat difficult
to follow along.  People who have never read the original comic (me included)
may be baffled by some of the parts of the film that are a little more unclear.
 (The ending and the concept involving Akira had me CONFUSED, if you want an
example.)  I guess part of the problem has to be that Ohtomo was trying to
squeeze 1256 pages of his graphic novel into a 124 minute movie.  This causes
the overall result of the film's storyline to be a cacophony of confusion,
despite supporting a strong message and complicated characters.
Incidentally, the critics found the storyline to be too confusing as well. 
However, they also found the animation to be an impressive achievement. 
There's no doubt about it that the animation is nothing short of spectacular. 
Most of the animated films from Japan I had seen before AKIRA had beautiful
colors, but there were not anywhere as fast - or grisly - as this.  The action
scenes are very breathtaking and masterfully executed.  In fact, I recently
found out from my cousin that the animators doubled the frame rate per second
of most animated films to make such scenes possible.  It really shows here. 
Unfortunately, when the film begins to get violent  and bloody  we get to see
plenty of it, and it almost makes us difficult for us to remember that this is
just a cartoon.  That is what occasionally makes watching AKIRA a painful task.
The result of the spectacular visuals is the time and effort (and money) spent
on the making of AKIRA.  Katsuhiro Ohtomo and his animation staff spent Ľ1.1
billion to make AKIRA, which, at the time, was quite a lot of money considering
how much it usually costs to produce an animated film in Japan.  (However, some
other Japanese animated films such as WINGS OF HONNEAMISE and PRINCESS MONONOKE
have cost a lot more than this.)  The work made into making AKIRA was worth it,
because the film was a big box office hit in Japan.  Unfortunately, I have no
data on how much it grossed in that country.
AKIRA was dubbed into English by Streamline Pictures (a company which got a
really bad name with its English dubs on Japanese animated films) and released
in the US around 1990.  The film grossed only $439,162 in its limited US
release, but it managed to become a best-seller on video.  Strangely, the
English dub affected my entertainment value of the film a little the second
time I saw it (even though I got used to it by the last half hour of the film).
 The problem isn't the translation from Japanese to English (It is a difficult
language to translate; believe me, I wasn't so successful on some attempts to
translate some CDs I imported from Japan), but by the acting.  The actors,
which the exception of some, sound like they don't have experience on matching
their words in synch wth the lip movement.  In addition, it almost sounds like
they aren't very experienced at acting.  I don't usually have a problem with
most dubs, unlike most Anime fans, but surprisingly this one bothered me a
little bit more than most.  However, like I said before, I got accustomed to it
as the film reach its last couple of minutes.
To sum it up, AKIRA is ABSOLUTELY NOT FOR CHILDREN.  It's dark plot and very
grisly visuals will scare them away and undoubtedly give them nightmares for
weeks.  The target audience for AKIRA is one that can stand to overlook its
violent images and see a gem beneath the grit.  But is it really necessary to
successfully achieve such feelings?  I personally don't like movies with
violence, but because I'm older, I at least was able to handle the grisly
images better than I did when I was 15.  However, I have failed to understand
just why violent movies appeal to such a wide audience.  Still, the animation
was dazzling enough for me to give it a passing grade, as you can probably
judge from the rating above.

CAPSULE: Quite possibly the best animated film ever made. A feast for, as
well as an attack on, the senses and the intellect.
Words don't convey the total and monolithic impact that AKIRA has on the
average viewer. With praise to Roger Ebert for the use of the term, it's an
out-of-body experience in the best possible way. It may also be the best
animated film yet produced.
On the factual level, AKIRA is an animated film that has been adapted from a
best-selling Japanese comic, or manga, by Otomo Katsuhiro. Otomo's comic ran
for several thousand pages and has been reprinted in several phonebook-sized
volumes, in both English and Japanese. With some condensation and sweat, it
has been rewritten (by Otomo and others) to fit into a
slightly-over-two-hour-long movie. The adaptation has worked in the vein of
all the best film adaptations: it stands apart from the original and
succeeds on its own merits.
AKIRA takes place in a Tokyo some decades into the future, after a holocaust
of some kind devastated the city. Wiping the map clean and rebuilding anew
has not helped anything: the city is a den of crime and foulness, with kids
running amuck on motorcycles and riots erupting periodically on
streetcorners. During a rumble, one of the gangs runs into a bizarre little
character -- a boy with the face and body of a wizened old man, and with an
expression of perpetual terror -- who is promptly whisked away by the
military. In the ensuing scuffle, one of the kids -- the "runt of the
litter", Tetsuo -- is injured and carted off. Kaneda, the gang leader and
Tetsuo's lifelong confidant, tries to piece together what's going on. He
finds a lot, which I am loathe to reveal here to avoid ruining the film's
many astonishing detours.
The film's dense plotting makes a second or even third viewing more or less
mandatory. Like BLADE RUNNER or NATURAL BORN KILLERS, the sensory overload
is so absolute the first time, it's almost impossible to take the story
directly: there's paranormal powers, government conspiracies, uprisings,
youth in revolt, and a titanic climax that takes place in a half-finished
Olympic stadium. It's almost too much, but on the other hand, *not* telling
a story like this with total sensory overload would have been criminal, and
the animation in the movie is technically unparalleled at showing us, in
synapse-snapping detail, the violent parameters of the world Kaneda and his
buddies are stuck in.
AKIRA is violent, and it's tempting to make obvious comparisons to Hong Kong
action movies, but it doesn't have the exhilarating and intimate
orchestration of a John Woo film. It works on a different level -- it's
armageddon. And it's also strong enough in its own right -- in the way it
deploys and tells its story -- that comparing it to an HK flick would be
redundant. What's also startling is how direct and visceral it is: five
minutes in, we're not responding to the movie as a bunch of painted cels.
We're inside it; it's an environment. Many people, myself included, find
themselves remembering some of the most striking moments not as animation
but as a kind of hyper-reality.
The fact that the movie is animated and not live action is a critical one.
TriStar at one point optioned the film and considered a live-action remake,
but that betrayed the whole point: the project would have cost an
unspeakable amount of money, and would not have had the same effect in some
ways. Animation is about showing us things that are made all the more
graphically theatrical by BEING animation. We're invited to let our own
imagination fuse with the imagination of the creators; it's more demanding
and in some ways more rewarding. As animation, the film is magical. As live
action, it would have been concrete and therefore ridiculous.
A lot of people have complained that AKIRA's biggest flaw is its thin (or
even inept) characterization. There's a case for that: the general, for
instance, is not required to do much more than grind his teeth and snarl,
and many of the supporting characters aren't given a lot to do. But the
details of Kaneda and Tetsuo's relationship are brought out excellently, in
both obvious and subtle ways -- and since this is the true heart of the
movie, it does a good job of carrying the rest of the movie's sometimes
heavy weight. What the movie does best of all is present an experience. The
last hour and a half of the movie are something like riding a motorcycle at
top speed along the crumbling rim of a volcano, staring down all the while,
feeling closer to the abyss than just about any other movie has been able to
bring us.
Watching AKIRA is fast becoming something akin to a rite of passage in some
circles -- an initiation into what the future might recognize as truly
classic from this era. A list of such things might include STAR WARS, BLADE
RUNNER, and maybe TITANIC. I'd submit AKIRA for that list as well, without
blinking.

The mother of all manga (Japanese animation) films.  If you don't like
this sampling of the genre, then quit now - there aren't many that
come better, or at least bigger, than this.  AKIRA is the manga that
all others, for better or worse, are measured by (its popularity in
the West has helped this enormously).  As with others of its type, the
plot of AKIRA - which I won't even try to capsulize here - is
secondary to the visual action. Story is set 30 years after World War
III, which nominally makes it science fiction, and its convincing
portrayal of a high-gloss dystopia (a mix of BLADE RUNNER and
CLOCKWORK ORANGE) does stamp a strong SF feel onto the first half
hour.  Eventually this gives way to the personal torment and wholesale
destruction conventional of manga, and the SF element is consumed by
the quasi-religious ascension that appears to be the only logical
'out' that films of this type can conclude with.
At the time of production AKIRA was the most expensive animated film
produced in Japan, and it may well still hold that record.  It was
obviously a labor of love for writer/co-director Katsuhiro Otomo, who
also wrote the graphic novels on which it was based.  His meticulous
attention to detail (especially noteworthy are the finely-rendered
backgrounds and enormous palette of colors) shows that he approached
the task of animating his book as if he were making it as a
live-action film - the drawings were so finely rendered that frames
were drawn for 70mm film.  He also departed from the conventional
techniques of other Japanese studios by pre-recording the dialogue
before animating the characters.  Otomo and animation director Takashi
Nakamura use such 'live' camera techniques as slow motion,
focus-pulling, dollying, and tracking; infuse the soundtrack with a
rich variety of background/foreground noise; and revel in simulating
the effects of smoke, water, fire, wind, and speed.  Most impressive
is the way light sources (and their resulting shadows) are used,
especially when they 'flare' into the lens.  In fact, it's almost too
much of a good thing.  AKIRA is so consistently brilliant in its
execution that it's hard to keep appreciating just how good it is. 
There are the inevitable dull spots - it's over two hours, after all -
and some of the action sequences are never-ending, but it does manage
to pull through at the end to deliver a huge-scale climax.  If the
finale doesn't seem as impressive as the opening ten minutes (which,
like the rest of the film, deserve to be seen on the big screen for
real impact) its only because we've seen enough of it already.
I like AKIRA more than other films of its ilk (see ten minutes of
LEGEND OF THE OVERFIEND and you've seen the whole movie) but it's
distracting to see the characters speaking in American accents, and it
gets on my nerves hearing the characters screaming each others names
continuously.  There are also too many lantern-jawed Pekingese-nosed
he-men running around for my liking. Scenes of mass
destruction/carnage aren't as disturbing as the moments of more
personal one-on-one violence (we've seen Tokyo trashed on film too
many times to get upset about it now), which makes it distinctly
unsuitable for children.  Not that they'd be able to keep up with the
plot anyway, but then again, who can?  This also may be the only
cartoon with product placement - unless a new trend now catches on.

     I feel like I should place a mountain of disclaimers before publishing a
review of the latest imported, dubbed Japanese animated film, AKIRA.  First,
I've been reading the serialized, translated manga that the film is based on,
published by Epic Comics.  The story is considerably different -- it *has* to
be, considering the story is hundreds of pages long in the manga, and has to be
compressed and changed to fit into a couple of hours running time.  Secondly, I
like the way the manga story has been done so far; and while most people seeing
the movie will be viewing it with a fresh mind, I was critically comparing it
to it's printed incarnation.
     That said, I can recommend AKIRA, the film, only on its technical merits.
It is fantastic, heart-pounding animation, giving you the kind of intense
experience you find in ALIENS or DIE HARD.  Until you a) start thinking about
what's going on, or b) get to the conclusion, which is some sort of mishmash
about man, the environment, the universe and (maybe) God.  At any rate, it's
not very well explained.
     The story deals with Tokyo in the early 21st Century.  A conflict in 1991
(I believe) destroyed almost all of Tokyo, and since then the city has been
rebuilding itself.  However, underneath the newly-constructed Olympic stadium,
a secret project with a dual purpose is taking place.  One part of the project
is to examine, and attempt to induce, advanced mental powers in humans.  The
other part is to imprison someone -- or something -- called Akira.  Into this
situation stumbles two groups of people: a group of anti-government rebels
(headed by Ryo and Kay), and a bunch of J.D. bikers, headed by Kaneda, and
also his younger friend, Tetsuo.  The escape of one of the mental psi-subjects
involves these two groups together, along with covert government forces headed
by The Colonel.  These characters become intertwined in a plot to either
release, contain, or exploit the force known as Akira.
     Katsuhiro Otomo, the man who wrote and drew the manga AKIRA, also wrote
and supervised the film.  Some of the stories best parts are kept in (the
semi-comic, semi-romantic relationship between Kaneda and Kay, for instance).
Where the film really falls down is the nebulous reasons behind, and
explanation of, what exactly AKIRA is, how he got to be that way, and what
happens at the end of the film.  The manga explains things (at least, so far)
as it goes along with sufficient clarity, but the film tends to give some great
other-worldly effects and let it go at that; just because Kubrick got away with
it in 2001 doesn't give everyone else Carte Blanche to use the "Rorschach test"
ending as a fit conclusion for a science-fiction movie.  It could be poor
dubbing at fault, but I suspect that the story from the manga was simply too
involved to fit within the confines of a two-point-five hour film.
     The animation, however, is spectacular (and rather grisly; having a weak
stomach for this kind of thing, I found myself a little queasy leaving the
theater; how my fellow netters could think of Wendy's was beyond me.), but for
those who aren't anime aficionados, I wouldn't recommend it.

     AKIRA may be the best and most well told example of Japanese
animation ever.  AKIRA, based on the graphic novel and comic book
series by Katsuhiro Otomo has all the elements of great story and is at
or should be at the top of its film genre.
     Tetsuo is a young man whom is just trying to be one of the
guys.  But, thirty years in the future, after a global nuclear war is
what the earth has suffered.  And as a result:  Tokyo blown to
smithereens by a powerful psychic force known as Akira.  Now, Tokyo has
been rebuilt and renamed Neo-Tokyo.  Two rival biker gangs control the
city and Tetsuo just happens to be on the winning team until he runs
into a child on his motorcycle and he turns into a Tetsuo-on-a-stick.
     Suddenly, Tetsuo and his buddies are surrounded by lights,
sirens, and the military.  The strange boy, along with Tetsuo, are
taken away to a special hospital where they are trying to find the
secrets to this Akira force.
     Meanwhile, Tetsuo's fellow gang members have been arrested and
are being interrogated by the police and military who have joined
forces to battle against the rebellion of the citizens of Neo-Tokyo.
     Back at the hospital, it seems that Tetsuo is showing the same
patterns as the Akira patterns, and that could spell the destruction of
Neo-Tokyo if these 'patterns' are not kept under control.  Tetsuo soon
escapes from the hospital and steals his friend's, Kanada, bike, only
to be met up with the rival gang, The Clowns.
     Tetsuo's girlfriend is raped and beaten while Tetsuo is about
to watch Kanada's bike go up in flames, which ironically compares
Tetsuo's friend's bike to his girlfriend.  The outcome: a Tim the Tool
Man Taylor 'machines are better then women' quote that leads to Kanada
and the rest of the gang coming to the rescue.  The scene soon fades to
a violent beating of one of the clowns by Tetsuo and then the Akira
patterns kicking in with Tetsuo having delusions.  Soon, the military
comes and frisks Tetsuo away to the hospital for a second time.
     Well, a lot of side tracking goes on and on ... and on, but mark
my words: "Every cel of animation in this film is important."  It *is*
the most detailed and thought out script of Japanese animation ever
made.  It joins the ranks of such greats as RANMA 1/2, DOMINION, the
"Bubblegum" series and the American HEAVY METAL animated feature film.
     Now, back to the story.  Tetsuo soon finds himself with amazing
powers.  He also finds that he is not the only one that possesses these
extraterrestrial powers.  It seems that the boy he hit with his
motorcycle is part of the family that he is joining quickly.  Tetsuo
must make a decision.  One that is imperative to the survival of
Neo-Tokyo: Will he join the family and tame his powers or will he be a
cocky half-assed twit and defiantly destroy Neo-Tokyo?  I think that
Tetsuo has death, Destruction, and not to mention revenge on his mind.
     Everyone in Neo-Tokyo is in either panic or glorification.  Some
know of Tetsuo's powers and abilities.  Others think that Tetsuo is
"the Great" Akira.  One question lingers in his head: What is this
Akira?  The other psychics are pushing him to the edge, pounding his
brain with challenges the Akira still has more power.  And, as a power
hungry bastard, Tetsuo goes to find the one that is more powerful.
Tetsuo loses it, and all is surrounded by a blinding white light.  You
know the rest.
     Not very often does a motion picture, animated or not touch you
in a way that you gape at every movement, or word that comes from
this.  AKIRA grips you, and takes you, literally, thirty years in the
future and shows you that like the medieval stories of wizards and
warriors, dragons and knights still is there.  Its LAWNMOWER MAN times
10.
     One of the best things about this that other movies in the comic
genre failed to do was have the person who knows the story, characters,
and other tid bits behind the cameras.  BATMAN and THE CROW (not that
THE CROW was bad) could have been more fluent with their present and
complete storylines if the creator and illustrator of the comic books
and graphic novels were behind it.  Think what it would be like if Bob
Kane, directed the BATMAN motion picture?  Sleep on it.

*** (out of 4 = good)
1987, not rated, 124 minutes [2 hours, 4 minutes]
[animated - science fiction]
Starring the voices of: Jimmy Flanders (Tetsuo), Drew Thomas (Kenada),
Barbara Larsen (Kaye), produced by Ryohei Suzuki, Shunzo Kato, written by
Katsuhiro Otomo, Izo Hashimoto, directed by Katsuhiro Otomo.
The Japanese probably have the wildest imaginations and the greatest spirit
for action and adventure. They see animation in a much different manner than
we do, and "Akira" is proof positive of that.
The story takes place in the far future, in post-Apocolyptic "Neo-Tokyo."
Stories that take place in these settings tend to have the same atmosphere:
crime out of control; corrupt government; revolutions: and/or science and
technology worshipped as gods. This film takes a bit of all of these aspects
and mixes them together so we get a good sense of an abstract reality and an
intense reality.
We meet our main characters, a motorcycle gang of high school-aged boys, but
they are not villains, in fact, they are quite likable. Immediately the film
jumps into a high speed action sequence, which is probably the best scene in
the movie. The animators pull no punches in depicting the graphic violence
that takes place, such as: decapitation; a man being shot by hundreds of
rounds; blood and gore; and total mass destruction. Perhaps what's most
fascinating is the graphicness to it, because we don't get to see this stuff
in America.
The first half is a mad romp through Neo-Tokyo, defining the setting and
introducing the main characters. Kenada (Thomas), the leader of the gang, is
a wisecracking delinquent but is adorable. He and his gang are searching for
their friend Tetsuo (Flanders) who was taken away by the military in a
previous scene.
The story drops hints of some kind of background, through a military Colonel
and a scientist (who looks like Albert Einstein), who bicker with politicians
over the violent society they live in and why it came to be like this. There
is some sort of secret government project called Akira that could change the
world and give tremendous power to its beholder, and this element will later
play a key role. 
Meanwhile, Tetsuo realizes he has special powers, and is told by other
"gifted children" who they are and where they came from. Eastern ideology
plays a major role in defining these powers, we might consider it pure
fantasy but I'm sure the Japanese hold some validity to the concept.
There's really no single plot driving the film, it's basically a dizzying
journey through many characters and storylines that are loosely connected.
The film is story oriented, but it is the characterization and the
spectacular action sequences that make it good.
Still, "Akira" is interesting because we never know what's going to happen
next. Just watching the animation and the fact that it has a pretty
intricate, detailed story makes it all worthwhile.

Neo-Tokyo is about to explode.  Adapted from the mega-popular biweekly
Japanese comic strip, Katsuhiro Otomoto's Akira pares down the epic
graphic novel into two hours of purely visceral animated carnage.  What
lacks in coherence is made up for by brutal energy, starting off with a
blood soaked shooting, mutant kids on the run, a kick-ass motorcycle
chase straight from Mad Max, and a riveting electronica score.  Hop on
your bike!  Let's go!
Set in an apocalyptic Blade Runner city in 2019, young cyberpunk Kaneda
and his pint-sized bullethead amigo Tetsuo encounter a dangerous
telekinetic child (after kicking the shit of a rival bike gang).  Before
you can say "makeshift plot," a band of government scientists and army
helicopters are chasing our young heroes through the city before "Akira"
is unleashed.  The chase doesn't disappoint, leading to a monster-movie
climax where one of the central characters transforms into a gigantic
jelly-beast, smashing the city to pieces.  Many, many people die. 
Hundreds.  Maybe thousands.  It's beautiful, man!
The old ultraviolence achieves poetic splendor with top-notch
animation.  Painted in a wide array of futurama colors, it's a neon
glitter-dream come to life.  When heads start exploding like melons,
bright red splotches are highlighted against screaming white backdrops. 
The details are impeccable, with crowd scenes playing out as
mini-masterpieces of character design.
Die-hard Akira fans will be pleased by the digital remastering of the
print, now being projected digitally in some theaters.  For a
15-year-old slice of anime, Akira is still looking mighty sleek.  Yeah,
the dubbing is still fairly inept, but who's watching this movie for the
great dialogue?  (Okay, fine -- I liked it too when Kei says, "Amoebas
don't make motorcycles and atomic bombs!"  Just don't give me a bad
attitude, pops.  They've cut the juiciest camp translations in the
re-release.)
Akira is the rare animated film where the nonsensical plot actually
doesn't make much of a difference.  The action is staged fluidly and the
tone is pure pop opera.  It's Godzilla meets Rebel Without a Cause. 
While the manga fan base tends to overrate the film to a fault, Akira
will appropriately smash you in all the right places.
Director: Katsuhiro Otomoto
