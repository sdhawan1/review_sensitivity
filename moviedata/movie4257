STARRING:   Freddie Prinze Jr., Matthew Lillard, David Warner,
                Ginny Holder, Tche'ky Karyo, Saffron Burrows
DIRECTOR:   Chris Roberts
WRITER:     Kevin Droney (based on the computer game)
RATED:      PG-13
RELEASED:   1999
        Few computer games have ascended to the rank of "cultural
icon," but "Wing Commander" is one that has.  Released by Origin
Systems almost a decade ago (yes, it really has been that long),
the game, a self-professed "space combat flight simulator," featured
state-of-the-art graphics, terrific replay value, and frantic (not to
mention addictive!) arcade action.  I was one of the many who got
hooked, rushing home after work each day so I could resume my quest
to save the universe from the evil Kilrathi.  "Wing Commander" (and
eventually "Wing Commander II") dominated my life for several months;
I gained proficiency in blowing up alien spacecraft even as my social
calendar evaporated before my uncaring eyes.
        But all things must pass, and eventually the game was replaced
by newer challenges on my hard drive.  At least four sequels (and
possibly more) have appeared since the glory days of "Wing Commander
II" ("Wing Commander III," "Wing Commander IV," "Wing Commander
Academy," and "Wing Commander: Privateer"), but I never played any of
them.  Indeed, I rarely play video games at all these days: I spend
most of my life working in front of computers, and the last thing I
want to do is spend even more time in front of one for relaxation
purposes.  But I've nonetheless retained an affection for the games
of by-gone years, and when I heard that a big-screen adaptation of
"Wing Commander" was headed for theaters, I was delighted.
        The plot of 20th Century Fox's movie follows that of
Origin's computer game fairly closely: it's 500 years in the future,
and Earth is at war with a fierce alien race called the Kilrathi, who
in the game looked like big tigers, but here resemble nothing so much
as Hans Moleman's head grafted onto Arnold Schwarzenegger's body.  The
Kilrathi have stolen a device called a NavCom from an Earth-owned
asteroid base, and this is bad news indeed for our planet: the NavCom
will allow the Kilrathi to discover the jump coordinates they need to
bombard our homeworld.
        A group of hot young space pilots may be the only thing
that can stop the attack.  Operating from a battered starship
called the Tiger's Claw, this group, headed by Jeanette "Angel"
Devereaux (Saffron Burrows), their wing commander, is determined
to do anything they can to thwart the aliens' plan.  The fighters
include Chris Blair (Freddie Prinze Jr.), who lives with discrimi-
nation every day of his life; the aptly-named Todd "Maniac"
Marshall (Matthew Lillard), who's an overconfident show-off but
an excellent pilot; and Rosie Forbes (Ginny Holder), a young black
woman eager to prove that Maniac isn't the only daredevil on the
ship.
        "Wing Commander's" opening credits are spectacular, mixing
audio clips from famous space-related speeches (Kennedy's vow to put
a man on the moon by the end of the '60s, etc.) with a visual montage
of star-charts and nebulas.  As the credits continue, other
fictitious but real-sounding news bulletins are heard, such as the
first broadcast from the Mars colony, the declaration of war on the
Kilrathi, etc.  I loved the effect; it got me interested in the story
right away, lending a sense of historical weight to the events even
though they're fictional.
        Unfortunately, it's also the extent of the movie's cleverness.
For the rest of its duration, "Wing Commander" runs strictly on auto-
pilot, giving us a bunch of largely interchangeable characters
who fly around in spaceships and shoot things.  (Imagine how the
Death Star battle in "Star Wars" would've been if Luke Skywalker had
called in sick that day.)  The movie never even bothers to tell us
why we're at war with the Kilrathi-- merely because they're there,
I expect.  (In all fairness, the game was equally vague on this
point.)  This was one of the big disappointments from me: I was
hoping to get a better glimpse at the culture of a formidable space
foe, but the movie paints them as targets, not adversaries.
        "Wing Commander" flings exposition at the audience as though
we were in elementary school.  Lacking any creative way to integrate
information seamlessly into the story, the film has the characters
speak at great length about things they should already know.  An
example: early in the film, some of our key characters find them-
selves being drawn towards what appears to be black hole.  As they
work frantically to free themselves, someone asks what will happen
if they are unable to break free.  The reply: "We're all gonna be
sucked into space, one molecule at a time."  Shouldn't a crew of
veteran space explorers already know this sort of thing?  Should
they waste valuable time talking about it?
        But that's tame compared to the movie's biggest blunder.
The Blair character is descended from a race called The Pilgrims,
who are despised and mistrusted by every other race.  In a laughable
scene, Blair visits his captain to ask why everyone despises his
heritage.  The captain, bless his heart, then proceeds to explain
the history of Blair's own race to him!  This would be comparable
to a black man going up to a white man during the '50s and asking
why those guys in the white hoods and robes are mean to him!  ("Well,
Billy, a long time ago there was a thing called slavery...")  I burst
into muffled laughter at the thought that the Blair character
wouldn't know the history of his own race, when apparently EVERY
OTHER CHARACTER IN THE MOVIE is well aware of it.  You'll be pleased
to know that I successful restrained an urge to hurl popcorn at the
screen.
        Character interaction is handled with as little dialogue
as possible, causing many of the protagonists to come across as
nothing more than walking plot points.  Commander Gerald (Jurgen
Prochnow), for example, makes an anti-Pilgrim slur in virtually
every single line of his dialogue.  Every time he appeared on the
screen, the movie basically halted for a moment while Gerald spewed
forth a flood of racist comments.  Angel, so interesting in the
computer game, never really feels real here: I didn't buy the way
she handled a particular crisis late in the film involving Maniac,
nor did I appreciate the formulaic relationship between her and
Blair, which certainly didn't exist in the game and feels tacked on
here, possibly as a result of a market study which indicated that
the film needed another love story.  Matthew Lillard's portrayal of
Maniac is a bright point, however: Lillard has played lunatics in
three films now ("Scream" and "She's All That" are the other two);
he's comfortable depicting psychopaths, and is getting better with
practice.  I liked his interactions with the Rosie character: their
constant "I'm better than you are" competitions are amusing and
oddly sweet, culminating in the film's best bit of dialogue:
        The movie isn't consistently entertaining, but it has a
pulse.  Largely hollow characters and a frequently disappointing
script are somewhat balanced by the movie's visual effects (the
combat scenes actually feel more like ballet than typical action
sequences).  Parts of the film are undeniably fun, but overall,
"Wing Commander" is rather like watching someone else play your
favorite video game for two hours-- you keep wishing they'd leave,
so you could have a turn.

"If you just let yourself be drawn into the picture, you wouldn't have to
laugh." So said a viewer of "Wing Commander" to his giggling friend.
Apparently, the former had been drawn in and the later, moved to laughter.
That one statement pretty much sums up the audience's reaction to "Wing
Commander." Half the audience seemed taken in by riding the spaceships
through their seas of glory, while the other half chuckled in waves of muse
at the corny/cliche dialogue and plot developments.
I must admit, I'm fine with a mild amount of "the hokey" (I can even like
it!). So after voluntarily clicking out plausibility sensors in my mind's
eye, I was among those enjoying the ride. It wasn't until about
three-quarters of the way through that the following dialogue exchange
tickled me into becoming a member of the now exuberantly tickled sector of
the crowd:
"You'll be court martialled!" Commander Angel threatens lt. Blair (Prinze
Jr.). His response, "Oh, like I care..."
Is a synopsis really necessary? It's a space flick based on the video
game -- in the vein of "Starship Troupers", maybe "Star Trek", "Battlestar
Galactica" (if you're old enough). No footage is shot on a planet, most is
on a huge battle cruiser, with occasional dog-fighting jet-like crafts
mixing it up between the stars. We follow the good guys the entire film,
Freddie being the only Earthling (and in only one scene) that faces the
aliens eye to eye.
Though stretching probability, I did enjoy the spacecraft / U-boat motif.
The battle cruisers float in space like submarines -- firing missiles at
each other. A major character, Tarrent, is a captain Ahab re-incarnation,
navigating with medieval style maps. Not completely consistent with this mix
in time, but nonetheless fun, the jet-like crafts cut through the vacuum of
space making "air-like" sounds shooting at each other with virtual Gatlin
guns.
I also had a good laugh when a chunk of wreckage was shoved off the the
runway of the cruiser -- it dropped like a rock (but where? and why was
there gravity to make it fall?)
Back to the review: I think kids will love this picture ... kids from about
6 to 14. And to tell the truth -- I enjoyed myself, half the time drawn into
the film, half the time laughing at it.
Cast: Jürgen Prochnow, Freddie Prinze (jr.), Mathew Lillard, Tchéky Karyo,
Ginny Holder, David Suchet, Saffron Burrows and others.

The next time you go to a store that rents or sells video games, take a
look at some of the titles.  A lot of them are based on popular film
titles (Mission: Impossible and GoldenEye) or television shows (South
Park and Beavis & Butt-Head), but when was the last time you said, `Hey,
they oughta make this game into a movie'?  And when was the last time
that a film based on a video game was watchable, let alone good?
Remember Double Dragon and Super Mario Brothers?  How about Mortal
Kombat and its legendary sequel Mortal Kombat: Annihilation?  Granted,
the makers of these movies probably didn't dust off the ol' mantle in
anticipation of winning multiple Academy Awards.  Aside from MK's
soundtrack, they're all pretty much a waste of money, time and film.
Wing Commander (1/2 *) follows in the great tradition of game-to-screen
failures and is actually not better than a sharp stick in the eye.
That's right  I would actually prefer to lose the power of sight in one
of my eyes than see a film this wretched.  Its story is deplorable and
acting third-rate, but it has the common courtesy to keep its running
time under 100 minutes.  100 mind-numbing minutes.  100 minutes that I
would like to have back.
Commander is set in the year 2654 during an intense war between Earth
people and these cat-like people called Kilrathi.  As the film opens,
the Kilrathi have just destroyed a big Earth spaceship and have sent a
huge fleet to wipe out our planet.  And they can arrive in our solar
system very quickly because they have stolen something called Pegasus
Navicom A.I. that tells them which black holes to fly into in order to
save time.
Luckily, us Earthlings have two hothead fighter pilots on our side.
Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Matthew Lillard (both of She's All That fame)
deliver a secret message that's been entrusted to them by the Admiral,
then join a rag-tag squadron of other fighter pilots.  Then they fly
around and blow stuff up and save the world  nay, the universe.  And
that's pretty much it.  There is very little air combat, practically no
decent special effects, and you barely get a glimpse of the kooky
Kilrathi soldiers.  So, that leaves you with Prinze, who is a horrible
actor, and Lillard, who is downright ugly.  That's an equation that
doesn't equal big fun regardless of what galaxy you're from.
Writer/Director Chris Roberts, who has no feature film experience but
created these characters for the second and third installments of the
popular PC game, should not only be strung up by his thumbs but should
also be beaten about the head and shoulders with a blunt object until
his face resembles red pudding.
Like my old Aunt Pearl used to say, `If you don't stand for something,
you'll go for anything.'  Of course, that doesn't have anything to do
with Wing Commander, but every once in a while she would poop her pants
and smell up the house.  I would rather clean up her rancid feces than
see this film again.  Consider yourself warned.
1:38  PG-13 for adult language, some sexual content and adult
situations

_Wing_Commander_ (PG-13) no stars (out of ****)
Last week, the sad announcement was made that the hilarious,
bad-movie-skewering cult TV hit _Mystery_Science_Theater_3000_ was ending
its run after its forthcoming tenth season.  That announcement is even
sadder by the release of _Wing_Commander_, the latest entry in the dubious
"based on a video game" film genre--my, what a field day Mike Nelson and
his robot pals would have had with this prime piece of sci-fi schlock.
Based on the popular computer game of the same name--and directed by no
less than the game's creator, Chris Roberts--_Wing_Commander_ takes place
during a war between humans and the evil Kilrathi alien race in the year
2564.  But that's actually more plot details than anyone really needs.
Essentially, the film is about a bunch of guys in spaceships trying to
shoot down and/or blow up enemy ships.  But someone forgot to tell Roberts
that.
I doubt I have read a more pretentious statement than one Roberts gives in
the press notes: "_Wing_Commander_ is a hard-core war movie set in space.
In some ways, it has more in common with _Midway_ and
_The_Battle_of_Britain_ than with a science-fiction film....  I wanted to
make a film about people under the incredible tension of battle."  It's
more about actors under the incredible tension of poor writing, direction,
and all other facets of filmmaking.  Stars Freddie Prinze, Jr., Matthew
Lillard, and Saffron Burrows (the latter being the "wing commander" of the
title) are all atrocious, but the fact that they've all done acceptable
work in other films (yes, even Prinze) puts them at less blame than Roberts.
The story that he and scripter Kevin Droney have come up with is a messy
mish-mash of elements of _Star_Wars_ (Prinze's metaphysically-gifted
character must save the day with The Force, more or less), _Star_Trek_ (the
gibberish-speaking Kilrathi look like papier-mache mutations of the Klingon
race), and bad soap opera, which manifests itself in the form of cornball
"emotional" scenes and even more painful dialogue.  Among other things,
lines such as "My adult life I've taken crap because I'm part Pilgrim!" and
"He's a good guy, Angel.  There's no reason to hate him" left the preview
audience overcome with laughter.  (And, no, hearing the lines in context
does _not_ help.)
Movies like _Wing_Commander_ make me continue to question the logic of the
whole video-game-to-film practice.  After all, isn't the idea of
interactivity what makes a video game popular in the first place?  Wouldn't
anyone rather sit at home playing the game than pay eight bucks to watch
some dreary feature-length commercial, which is essentially what these poor
excuses for films are?  Then again, in terms of _Wing_Commander_, I'd
rather do just about anything than sit through it another time.
To think that we could have actually been spared the agony that is
_Wing_Commander_: the film had been languishing on Fox's shelf until the
inexplicable success of a certain movie called _She's_All_That_ brought
some luster to Prinze and Lillard's names.  Just another reason to thank
the general moviegoing public for their exquisite taste.

WING COMMANDER by DeWyNGaLe    Rating: F
A few months before the release of Star Wars Episode 1, The Phantom Menace,
20th Century Fox decides to release another space film, that is a complete rip
off of Star Wars.  What is the point of this?  I do not know, but I wish it
hadn't been done, considering Wing Commander is definitely the year's worst
film so far.  To attract people to this horrible movie, they attached the full
trailer for The Phantom Menace.  Wing Commander will draw large crowds, because
this is the only film where you can find The Phantom Menace full trailer
attached at this time.  The trailer for The Phantom Menace was certainly the
best part of the movie experience I had tonight. 
Many people do not know that Wing Commander is based on a Star Wars computer
game.  I found this very interesting, considering this fact almost says that
Wing Commander is a Star Wars movie.  It is nowhere near the level of the Star
Wars films though.  Freddie Prinze Jr. stars in the film as Christopher Blair. 
Wing Commander was a huge mistake for Freddie.  This was definitely his worst
performance to date.  After January's She's All That, I actually saw a good
actor in Freddie, but now all those visions have been crushed. (For now
anyway.)  Christopher Blair is a pilot who is a part of the battle to stop the
Kilrathi, a group that is trying to destroy the earth.  Blair's parents also
fought in the space battles, and also died there.  His parents were pilgrims,
so many people disrespect him because of this.  Blair is under the command of
"Angel", played by Saffron Burrows, and he is friends with another pilot, Todd
"Maniac Marshall", played by Matthew Lillard.  Matthew Lillard seems to play
the same role in every movie, and he does in this one too.  His character as
Stu in 1996's Scream (A+), was a great one, but now, it seems like that same
role is being played again, only in a space movie.  The three are just a small
part of a large group trying to stop the Kilrathi before they take over earth. 
This plot is very flimsy, and doesn't give a whole lot to work with at all. 
This explains why Wing Commander drags on, seeming like there is no point to
any of the events that are going on.
The acting is horrible in Wing Commander.  Many lines seem out of place, and
are completely meaningless.  The acting and dialogue was so terrible, I even
found myself laughing at it.  The other things which are very bad about Wing
Commander are the special effects and the music.  The special effects are very
unrealistic.  When looking at two ships flying side by side, it is simple to
tell they are hanging and a blue screen is behind them.  The explosions look
very unrealistic as well.  A ship will be blown up, but there will only be fire
present four about one half of a second.  This is very unrealistic.  Music
pretty much accompanies the film the entire time.  The music also felt like
video game music, and it was very corny and annoying sounding.   
After we are given the plot, the film repeats itself for another hour, without
any plot twists, interesting scenes, or anything important to the film.  Blair
is forced to make jumps over other planets, and he must also fight against the
Kilrathi aircraft.  For the entire length of the movie, it takes place in
space.  It is truly like you are in a video game, because you are just watching
people shoot at each other in ships for a long, extended period of time.  It's
not much fun to watch at all.  If I wanted to watch people shoot at each other
in ships, I would go watch Star Wars at home.  At least Star Wars pays
attention to people, myth, feelings, and has some real plot to it.
The Bottom Line- Bring on The Phantom Menace 20th Century Fox!

Computer games don't translate well into feature films - just
check out Mortal Kombat, Streetfighter, Super Mario Brothers and Judge
Dredd for proof.  Now you can add to this inauspicious list Wing
Commander, a dull and cliché-ridden futuristic space adventure that
makes The Phantom Menace seem like Citizen Kane by comparison.
Set some 500 years in the future, Wing Commander is a science
fiction adventure aimed squarely at undemanding teenage audiences.
The plot deals with a Confederation attempt to stop an attack on Earth
launched by the hostile slug-like Kilrathi.  Apparently the Kilrathi
have gained access to a navigation device that will enable them to
launch a surprise attack on the earth.  Sent to counter this threat
are two rookie pilots straight out of military academy and the
Diligent, a decrepit old trade vessel piloted by the enigmatic Paladin
(Tcheky Karyo, from Bad Boys, etc).
The aptly named Maniac (Matthew Lillard, from Scream, etc) is
full of bravado but little actual combat experience.  Christopher
Blair (Freddie Prinze jr, from She's All That, etc) carries a vital
coded message about the planned invasion.  Although his father was a
legendary hero, Blair is not entirely trusted by Confederation
commanders because of his mixed heritage.  Their flight commander is
Deveraux (Saffron Burrows, from Circle Of Friends and the upcoming
shark thriller Deep Blue Sea, etc), a tough-as-nails woman who has
forgotten her humanity.
Chris Roberts, who conceived and developed the series of
computer games on which the film is based, makes his feature film
debut as a director, but his handling of the material is less than
emphatic.  The special effects are good, but the action sequences lack
genuine excitement.  One of the key sequences, in which our heroes
hide from an enemy fleet that is tracking them by radar, resembles
those old W.W.II submarine movies of yesteryear, a comparison that is
enhanced through the stolid presence of Jurgen Prochnow (Das Boot,
etc).
The seemingly hurriedly written script has enough holes to
sink a black hole.  The hunky youthful cast will certainly appeal to
the target audience, even if their enthusiastic, but shallow,
performances lack conviction.  The international supporting cast of
veterans (Prochnow, Karyo, David Warner and David Suchet) deliver
dour, wooden performances that suggest they are uncomfortable acting
with the computer generated special effects.  They also seem to be
having second thoughts about their involvement with this clichéd
and unexciting adventure.
Unfortunately, this is one wing commander that fails to take off!

     Wrong-o.  I've never played the game aside from a 30-minute tour,
and now I wish I hadn't seen the movie, either.
     Come now, you say, it can't be that bad!  Wasn't WING COMMANDER a
highly-lauded, critically-acclaimed video game?  Maybe the STAR WARS of
the PC?  Sure.  But when you rid yourself of everything but the title
and the setting (redux: Humans at war with Kilrathi, an evil alien race
that look like walking walnuts with beards), you'll find you're high and
dry.
     How bad is WING COMMANDER?  Bad.  *Really* bad.  Throughout most of
the film, my advance-screening theater was filled with the merry sounds
of laughter.  Alas, there are no (intentional) jokes on film. 
(Disclaimer: Said laughter does not count those who had fallen asleep.) 
Not only does the plot stink, but WING COMMANDER has some of the worst
dialogue this side of SHOWGIRLS.
     The marketing ploy behind WING COMMANDER is obvious, and I'll
outline the sad history for you so you can get a sense for it....  20th
Century Fox nabs rights to successful video game for crossover hit
(MORTAL KOMBAT, the movie, was hugely successful)-maybe even a
franchise!  But isn't Mark Hamill getting old?  Replace him with some
young, unknown studs and draw the teen crowd!  It'll be cheap!  Uh-oh...
movie's done and it *is* cheap... in every way imaginable.  Shelve the
movie.  Fast-forward a few years... uh-oh again! - Prinze and Lillard
are, surprise, big stars!  Release movie with big ad campaign, touting
the newly idolized heroes.  Teens go nuts!  Score!

The guy who left the (near empty) theatre ahead of me described Wing
Commander in the simplest of all manners, `Boy, did that suck.'  I try not
to write reviews that use the word `suck' because it's not too
`professional,' but, in this case, I have to: Boy, did this movie suck.
Being in my early to mid-twenties, I have the fortune of playing all five
of the Wing Commander games.  So, I was looking forward to this movie.  The
movie is directed by Wing Commander game creator Chris Roberts and the
script is based on his story.  The problem is that Roberts has never done a
major motion picture before.  The difference between shooting the
cut-scenes between shoot em up segments in a game and shooting a major
motion picture is tremendous.  And lets just say that with the movie Wing
Commander the exciting shoot em up portion of the series is dearly missed.
 Without the shoot em up portions of the game we're left with a
meandering, uninspired, and boring movie that leeches from ever sci-fi film
known to man.
The film focuses on the main character of the game, Christopher (Freddie
Prinze Jr.) Blair, who is some sort of hybrid human that can navigate
through space using his gift (can you say `The Force?')  There is an evil
race of cat-like beings headed straight for Earth to annihilate the human
race and the only people who can save Earth are onboard the Tiger Claw, a
space carrier that Blair is assigned to.  That's the whole story of the
film.  Fill in the amazingly large gaps of time with sub-standard dialogue,
boring one-dimensional characters, cliched love stories, and
video-game-like space dogfights and you have two hours of pure space-hell.
The script by Kevin Droney is absolutely horrible and should've been
ejected into deep space long before it got green lighted to be shot.
Roberts who showed that he knew a little about how to direct a small screen
film does what he can with the script.  Though, his directing skills still
need a bit of work, especially in coercing good performances out of the
cast.  The whole cast gives bland performances.  And who can blame them
given the material they're working with.  I guess everyone needs a paycheck
between good films.
There were lots of holes in the film that stuck out, but there are two that
I want to point out.  When attacked, both the humans and the Kilrathi seem
to forget that they're in deep space where things can move on three axes.
When the carriers are torpedoed, the captains of the respective ships yell,
`Hard to port!'  Hey, captains, how about `Pull up and hard to port!' or
`Dive and hard to port!'  The second thing are the weapons.  It's so many
hundred of years in the future, man has flown to the deepest portions of
space, and these ships are still shooting machine guns with bullets?  Where
are the energy weapons?  Where are the lasers?
Sometimes with special effects driven movies, like Wing Commander, I can at
least recommend renting the film on video to see the special effects.
Godzilla is an example one of these types of films, horrible script, but
pretty good special effects.  It's too bad that Wing Commander is not only
deficient in the story arena but also in the special effects arena.
Originally slated for release straight-to-video, Wing Commander might have
been enjoyable as a rental, but on the big screen?  It's a waste of money.
I'm sorry I shelled out money and spent time sitting through this movie.
Creator/Director Chris Roberts makes a cameo appearance late in the film as
a search and rescue pilot; it's too bad there's nothing Roberts could have
done to rescue this piece of space debris.  Skip, skip, skip Wing Commander.

Directed by Chris Roberts.
Cast: Freddie Prinze Jr., Matthew Lillard, Saffron Burrows, Ginny 
Holden, Tcheky Karyo, Jurgen Prochnow, David Suchet, David Warner.
1999 - 105 minutes.
Rated PG-13 (for sexual situations, mild violence, and profanity).
Reviewed March 14, 1999.
Well now I've seen everything. "Wing Commander," based on the popular 
video game and directed by the game's creator, Chris Roberts, makes 
1994's "Street Fighter" and, dare I say it, 1997's "Mortal Kombat: 
Annihilation," look good in comparison. The only thing I'd like to say 
is that I so very much wish the late Ed Wood (director of "Glen or 
Glenda" and "Plan 9 From Outer Space," both widely considered two of the 
worst films of all time) were alive today. After viewing "Wing 
Commander," even his immediate reaction would be, "what complete and 
utter garbage!"
Although I suffered through the entire 105-minute running time of "Wing 
Commader," I couldn't tell you what it was about if you paid me, and 
it's not because I wasn't paying attention, either. Instead of reading 
someone else's review and then trying to reword their synopsis of the 
story, I'm going to instead tell you what I did understand. Set during 
the 27th-century, there's this big space ship thingy in space with a big 
crew, which gets even bigger when a few new recruits board on, including 
two young men, Blair (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and Maniac (Matthew Lillard). 
Every once in a while they go out in their own little space fliers and 
shoot other space thingys and blow them up. Blair is smitten with the 
wing commander of the crew (whatever that means), Deveraux (Saffron 
Burrows), even though she is a tough and stern little cookie who mostly 
ignores or hollers at him. Blair is also having some problems since 
people judge him because he's part-pilgrim ("My father was a pilgrim!"). 
Later, another crew member tells Blair, "there's nothing wrong with 
being a pilgrim." Meanwhile, Maniac likes the smart and sassy black crew 
member, Rosie (Ginny Holden), who is so sex-crazed and horny she gets 
off on flying space crafts and then blowing up in them! So, anyway, near 
the end, the crew has to fight the bad Kilrathis, people dressed up in 
clunky cat costumes with retractible Freddy Krueger claws who basically 
stand still in their spaceship and talk in "Kilrathian." At the end, a 
couple of the people we've grown to...well, grown to feel nothing for, 
get into danger and their lives are put at stake. They mostly pull 
through though and in the end, I wasn't sure what I had just sat and 
watched. 
"Wing Commander" is such a mind-numbing, awful, embarrassing, idiotic, 
corny, ludicrous, laughable, superficial, just plain bad, movie that I 
almost couldn't believe my own eyes or ears most of the time. How could 
20th-Century Fox, the movie's studio, have the nerve to even release 
this...this...I can't even think of a word awful enough to criticize it 
with. Although they, no doubt, decided to release it wide after both 
Prinze Jr. and Lillard had huge success with the box-office hit "She's 
All That," "Wing Commander" is going to hurt their careers rather than 
help them, since I now relize that they both had absolutely no excuse to 
make this movie. Heck, Prinze Jr. would have been better off making, "I 
Still Think I Know, But Refresh My Memory About Twenty-Five Summers Ago" 
than this depressing "product," which might have been pretty funny if I 
hadn't been so sorry for the people involved in its making. Of course, 
they did get what they deserved since they obviously forgot to read the 
screenplay (if there even was one) prior to signing on. As for Saffron 
Burrows, how in the world could she go from the sweet, realistic 1995 
Irish film, "Circle of Friends," to this? 
There's honestly not much else to say about "Wing Commander." I saw some 
Halloween cat costumes, some cheesy effects, and some stick people 
arguing about the nobility of being pilgrims. Several times while 
watching it, I clenched my eyes shut praying to fall asleep, but then I 
fought against it because I knew I'd have a little fun tearing the movie 
apart in my review if I stuck with it. When someone like Ed Wood, who 
loved all films, good or bad, would have laughed this movie off the 
screen, you know you're in trouble. Even Akiva Goldsman (the much-hated 
hack screenwriter who destroyed the "Batman" film series) would brush 
this waste of film space off as "rubbish." Roger Ebert once compared, in 
his review for 1996's "Mad Dog Time," the film to watching a blank 
screen for the same period of time. I'll go one step further and say 
that staring at a blank screen would be at least fifty times more 
entertaining and visually stimulating than all of "Wing Commander" 
combined.

WING COMMANDER
Reviewed by Jamie Peck
The movie, then, is a missed opportunity for director Chris Roberts, who 
created the original, groundbreaking PC incarnation of "Wing Commander" 
back in 1990. How an interactive brainchild so revered could end up such 
a cinematic pile of junk under the helm of the same guy is a 
head-scratcher. "Wing Commander"'s story, credited to Roberts and 
screenwriter Kevin Droney, is clueless chaos melding incoherent 
narrative and unoriginal ideas. It rips off the finest films of its 
genre, Top Gun and, in one scene, even those spiffy "stereoscopic 
freeze" Gap commercials. 
Set in 2654, "Wing Commander" stars Freddie Prinze Jr. as a daredevil 
cosmos cowboy who hopes to be a great fighter pilot like his father 
before him. Along the way, he plays kissy-face with his stoic superior 
(Saffron Burrows) at the new galaxy hangout where he's posted, comes to 
terms with bigots who resent him for his "Pilgrim" heritage (don't ask), 
and goes on a top-secret mission involving the "jump coordinates" (what, 
no Death Star plans?) of a nasty alien race known as the Kilrathi. Or 
something like that. Given the immensely confusing activity, it's hard 
to tell. 
On the other hand, what's easy to see is that "Wing Commander" is a big 
old mess. The lame dialogue strains, filled with such original lines as 
"Don't you die on me!", "Battle stations!" and repeated (and frequently 
unanswered) calls for a "Medic!" Action sequences fizzle. The character 
conflict garners unintentional giggles. The sole source of suspense here 
is what these Kilrathi creeps look like, as they're kept out of view 
until the concluding 15 minutes. Imagine bearded Siamese cats crossed 
with something from a 50s Roger Corman cheapie and you've got a good 
idea. 
Little but techno-babble happens for an hour, and then it's as if "Wing 
Commander" tries to do too much at once; when it appears as though the 
movie's about to show signs of a pulse, it instead provides a hilarious 
touch of human drama culminating with a use for a bulldozer that has 
probably never been seen in this kind of space camp before. Matthew 
Lillard, featured prominently in said sequence, is cast as Prinze's 
hotshot partner, and though the two are fine young actors - recently 
paired in the hit "She's All That" - they're fighting more than 
otherworldly evil here. 
Rumor has it that "Wing Commander" was slated as a later-in-the-year 
release, bumped up to capitalize off this hot casting coup as well as 
the premiere of the new "Star Wars: Episode I" trailer. But in my 
audience, there were no females present to make goo-goo eyes at Prinze 
or Lillard, and many a member exited after the much-ballyhooed sneak 
peek. Since most cineplexes won't be granting refunds to the latter 
contingency, "Commander" might rake in some dough, but be warned: The 
high wears off as soon as the coming attraction gives way to the feature 
presentation.

Chris Roberts's WING COMMANDER is a cinematic black hole that's liable
to suck your brains out as you attempt to decipher its impenetrable
story.  First-time director Roberts, who "directs" the movie based on
his video game, clearly seems to be working in the wrong medium and
doesn't have much of a clue as to how to stage a motion picture.  Writer
Kevin Droney, who also adapted MORTAL COMBAT for the big screen, creates
a movie so confusing you need a manual to be able to follow it.
You can score the movie as you watch it.  Give yourself 100 points every
time you figure anything out.  And give yourself double if you care.
Don't feel bad if you find you can't make a single point as that will be
a common score.
Basically we have some young warriors (Freddie Prinze Jr., Matthew
Lillard and Saffron Burrows) and some veterans (Jürgen Prochnow, Tchéky
Karyo and David Suchet) who are part of a space armada.  Their motto is
"if you die, you never existed."  As they prepare for battle, the troops
spend their time arguing over the relative merits of estrogen vs.
testosterone as being the most important ingredient for a fighter.
The "special" effects in the movie are only a small cut above the old
Buck Rogers's serials.  The fighters look like three-inch pieces of old
metal with Bunsen burners for propellants.
You do have to give the actors credit for keeping a straight face
through it all, no matter how inane the dialog.  (One of David Suchet's
lines, for example, is "Come on, this is sterile conjecture.")
My son, who is a fairly savvy and generally quiet moviegoer, whispered
to me about a dozen times during the movie to see if I could figure out
what was happening.  Each time I answered him honestly, "I have no
idea."
As I was forced to endure this stupefyingly dull film, I began to
develop various theories about it.  Perhaps, the speech was encrypted,
and our theater didn't have the right decoder module.  I tried watching
the actors' mouths move since another theory of mine was that the movie
was originally in a foreign language, and the problem was a bad English
dubbing.
"Emotion gets in the way," the Wing Commander advises her troops.  Well,
the movie doesn't have to worry about emotion.  There isn't a single
character in it that creates one scintilla of interest or sympathy.
Don't see the movie; rent the video game instead.  No video game
imaginable could be this terminally boring.
WING COMMANDER runs 1:40.  It is rated PG-13 for sci-fi violence,
profanity, sexuality and sexual innuendo and would be acceptable for
kids around 10 and up.
My son Jeffrey, almost 10, said he couldn't understand most of the movie
since it was confusing and didn't make any sense.  He hated it until the
ending, which he thought was okay, so he raised his rating from 1/2 to *
1/2.  His friend Nickolas, almost 10, said he liked the film because of
the action and gave the movie ****.  He said he understood it because he
had played the video game.

Just ask anyone who's seen Super Mario Brothers, the Movie, making
worthy film adaptations of computer games is a difficult business.  Most
computer games are light on plot and characterization to provide maximum
interactivity.  Film adaptations strip away that interactivity, and
leave very little in its place. Such is the case with Wing Commander, a
Star Wars wannabe that makes even Super Mario start to look good...
The plot of the Wing Commander movie tackles the Kilrathi war, which was
the subject of the first three Wing Commander computer games. The
Kilrathi are an evil alien race, bent to conquer the galaxy.  In the
games, they were furry and tigerlike...here they're more like shell-free
turtles, but it doesn't really matter.  They're never given more
definition than "the enemy", so they could be microscopic guinea pigs,
for all it matters.
The Kilrathi have stolen a key piece of Terran technology which is,
essentially, a map to Earth.  The foolish Earthlings have pooled their
entire starfleet in the farthest corner of the galaxy, and their fleet
will arrive to defend earth a mere two hours too late. There's only one
hope for the future of Earth:  a lone carrier, the T.C.S. Tiger's Claw,
can attempt to delay the entire Kilrathi battle fleet at a key
navigational jump point, or die trying.
The Tiger's Claw's orders are relayed by two rookie pilots, Blair
(Freddie Prinze Jr.) and Maniac (Matthew Lillard), and one mysterious
pilot (Tcheky Karyo).  Blair has a peculiar cross to bear (literally).
His mother was a "pilgrim", an advanced race of human beings who
eschewed humanity to take to the stars.  Normal humans, including most
of the crew of the Tiger's Claw, don't really care for his presence.
However, that doesn't stop him from striking up a relationship with his
wing commander, "Angel" Devereaux (Saffron Burrows).
Those familiar with the computer game series will know that it has
always been highly cinematic in its presentation.  It's no surprise,
then, that it was chosen for a movie adaptation.  What is surprising,
however, is how horrible this adaptation has turned out.
Rather than present a rousing space-bound action adventure, the
filmmakers instead chose to present Wing Commander as a WWII war film.
An entire sequence is even cribbed from Das Boot as the Tiger's Claw
plays submarine, beached in an asteroid crater while a Kilrathi
"destroyer" pings up above.  They've even enlisted Jurgen Prochnow to
play the worried commander of the ship.  The film would have been better
off without obviously drawing the comparison to a much better piece of
cinema.
Despite several attempts, Wing Commander is never able to create a sense
of tension or even consequence in any of its battle sequences.  Even the
computer game's battles seemed of more import than these glossy FX
compilations. Virtually every battle is extremely lopsided, with the
heroes slaughtering every Kilrathi ship in sight, while suffering nearly
no casualties themselves.  When they do, the tragedy is horridly
overplayed.
Freddie Prinze Jr. is a mostly featureless and dull hero, making you
long for the fine thespian stylings of Mark Hamill (who played the role
in the computer games). He's certainly not helped by the film's inane
script, which constantly feeds him pointless dialogue.  But even in his
silent moments, his wooden acting is composed primarily of a slack face
and mooning eyes.  At least co-star Matthew Lillard attempts to add some
energy to his role, even if he is playing the same "wild-and-crazy" bit
that he's done in all his prior films.
The special effects of Wing Commander aren't.  The opening shows
promise, but quickly the monotonous space battles prove to be a dark and
murky jumble of flashing lights and bland shadows.  But the outer space
special effects positively shine when compared with the puppetry of the
Kilrathi, who look like rejects from Dr. Who.
There was a brief time when Wing Commander was nearly destined to go
direct-to-video. That may have been a more fitting place, though I would
recommend avoiding this cosmic accident even in the video bargain bins.

There are many things that weâve learned from computers. There are also many
ways in which computers are helping people live their lives today. E-mail,
instant messages, and 3-D heavy games are now a part of everyday life for most
people in the country. Game designers have come out with some pretty classic
games such as Starcraft, Warcraft, EverQuest, and Wing Commander in the past
couple of years. While Starcraft might make a good movie, Wing Commander
doesnât. The only thing I can come up with is that 20th Century Fox must have
gotten together and said, âWe have a lot of computers. So letâs make a
movie based off of a computer game, include bad computer generated effects, and
make the characters have the dimension of their PC game counterparts.â?
Thatâs the only thing I can possibly think of that they must have been
thinking because this film is easily one of the worst movies of the year.
Christopher Blair (Prinze Jr.) has an encrypted CD with information pertaining
to the destruction of a ship by the evil Kilrahti, an alien race that wasnât
to be dominant of the entire galaxy. Kilrathi are strange looking wolf-type
creatures who walk around in rooms with lots of fog and speak in techno font
subtitles. When Blair and his friend Todd Marshall (Matthew Lillard, who once
again proves that he cannot act) get assigned to help beat the Kilrathi, they
become a fighter on the ship.
So a bunch of space stuff that doesnât really have any significance happens,
and then more of it happens, and then more until we really donât care much
about whatâs happening on screen. Most of the shots are of bad computer
created ships leaving, taking off, and firing, always hitting their target.
Then for some reason, Freddie has to leave his girl behind when she has to
eject from her space plane. This of course is right before he has to make the
jump that determines what happens in the end of the movie. (You will ask
yourself why he has to do this, you will also ask yourself why you ever wanted
to see this movie.) So he's up there in space worried and wondering whether his
love will be dead or alive when he comes home. I know, I just gave away what
happens in the end, but trust me, you wonât care.
The film contains horrible acting by everyone, there isn't one single
exception, none, zero, nada. This isnât to say itâs entirely the castâs
fault, Matthew Lillard is giving some pretty bad lines, and Freddie Prinze
doesnât have much to do. I think that I found the most compelling and
interesting character to be Mr. Obutu, (Hugh Quarshie) an African-American ship
navigator person, and thatâs only because of his name. The effects arenât
very good at all, and the action scenes donât build any suspense, so we
donât really care about the characters. Besides, the script is filled with so
many stereotypes (the captain who doesnât believe everyone else, the
good-hearted bad girl) that you know whatâs going to happen from about the 35
minute point. If you love the game you will be EXTREMELY disappointed. Heck, if
you saw it in the theaters, at least the new Star Wars trailer was shown before
it. That might make the experience a bit less painful. But if you consider
renting it on video, (what the heck is wrong with you?!) I seriously recommend
that you seek help because Wing Commander gets 1/2 a *.
