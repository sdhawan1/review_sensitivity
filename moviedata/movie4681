Reflecting on "Bedazzled," a lively comedy about the
Devil who seeks to possess the soul of a pathetic
loser, one sinful thought remains in my mind.  If Hell
means having to spend an eternity with Elizabeth
Hurley (who portrays the fiery demon), then use that
pitchfork and point me the way.   With her pouty lips,
irresistible British accent, and wild display of haute
couture, Hurley crackles with naughtiness and fills
your mind with temptation.  It's practically
impossible to turn this Beelzu-babe down.
Her next target is Elliot (Brendan Fraser), a tech
support geek who is clumsy, awkward, and just too
eager to please.  To aptly picture him, you would have
to remember a Saturday Night Live skit featuring
"Steve the Copy Guy" who effortlessly irritated his
co-workers with his unpolished social skills.  Eugene,
thus, is loathed and feared by his co-workers, who do
their best to stay out of his way.  Yet, beyond his
annoying mannerisms, he's a lovable oaf.  He wishes
that he could get closer to Allison (Frances
O'Connor), a co-worker with whom he is infatuated but
who has never taken notice of him.  However, the odds
of him getting together with her are about the same as
a snowball's chance in Hell.  "Dear God," he prays. 
"I would give anything to have that girl in my life." 
Guess who then shows up?
She makes an offer that is too hard to refuse.  "Seven
utterly fabulous wishes for one piddling little soul."
 There's even an escape clause.  If Elliot's wish
doesn't go exactly the way he likes, he need only
'beep' her (one guess as to what the three-digit
number is) and he gets to start over.
The remainder of the film consists of Elliot's various
fantasies that incorporate his personal desire to have
enormous amounts of wealth, power, fame and Allison's
love.  But when he makes sweeping statements such as
"I want to be very, very powerful and very, very rich
and married to Allison", he'll soon learn that the
Devil is in the details.  For example, (and we've seen
this several times in the trailers), he is granted his
wish, but finds out that he's a Columbian drug lord
and that Allison, while married to him, has her eyes
on someone else.  Apparently, the Devil is just as
eager to skew his fantasies as she is to possess his
soul.  His other wishes also end up with some strange
but funny twist that short-circuits his new life. 
Soon, Elliot wishes that he had never made that deal.
Given the mischievous nature of the Devil, "Bedazzled"
has many amusing moments.  A lot of the credit goes to
Fraser who turns in a great comic performance.  He
ably assumes various personas.  His funniest segment
is when he wishes that he could be the most sensitive
man in the world.   Allison becomes so frustrated with
him that she practically urges him to take advantage
of her.
Hurley also heightens the humor quotient, especially
in the transitional scenes when Fraser waits to start
his next wish after bailing out of the previous one. 
It's clear that she's having a good time with it all. 
Yet, while the filmmakers work hard at creating funny
scenes, they conspicuously avoid developing the
allegorical underpinnings between good and evil that
could have added more heft to this story.  But that
would be playing with fire.  What they've got works,
so you can easily accept it for the pleasant little
comedy that it is.

A remake of the 1967 comedy starring Dudley Moore and Racquel Welsh
(growl!!), this movie takes some of the basic elements from the original,
and brings them to age with Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley in the lead.
Haven't we all wished that we could be someone else every now and then?
Well, the lead character in this film gets seven wishes from the devil to
become whoever he wants to be. In return, all he has to do is give her his
soul (surprise, the devil is a woman...hehe). Now that's not asking too
much, is it? I wish...I could be a great movie! Poof.
PLOT:
A dweeby guy with a secret woodie for a co-worker decides to trade his soul
to the devil in return for seven wishes. As time goes by, the man realizes
that the gorgeous physical manifestation of Satan, isn't exactly playing
fair, and tries to improve upon his wishes every time.
CRITIQUE:
An underwhelming remake featuring yet another great comedic turn by Brendan
Fraser, a perfect sexy hot tamale role for Elizabeth Hurley, but ultimately
too much like a sketch comedy show, rather than a movie. Very little oomph!
The idea of this film is in itself, actually quite ambitious. To allow this
guy to have seven wishes, with him transforming into a Columbian drug lord,
a 7-foot tall basketball player, an ultra-sensitive guy and so forth, but
something seemed to be missing along the way. There were some funny scenes,
some so-so scenes and other tired ones. The whole thing felt sort of pieced
together from a good idea but a not so humorous script. Don't get me wrong,
I laughed here and there, Brendan Fraser was tops as usual in a Murphy-esque
type of role, with him portraying various different characters out of one,
but there were no laugh-out loud scenes and the ending of the film was just
flat. Looking back, it was one of those movies that's sort of "okay" as you
watch it, but entirely forgettable afterwards. It also got predictable
pretty early on, as much of the film's development could be guessed by the
end of the character's first "wish".
I really liked a couple of the situations that Brendan was placed in,
especially the extra-sensitive guy routine, which was really well done and
quite funny, and the whole basketball sequence, which was also very
well-handled, both effects-wise and the humor. Others could have been
funnier such as the Columbian drug lord scenario, which felt more like a
"one-joke" pony. But then there was the luscious Elizabeth Hurley, who kept
me in the game for quite some time. Looking better and better from scene to
scene, featured in various delectable costumes as every boy's fantasy (pant,
pant), Hurley managed to juice all that she could out of her devilish
character. I thought the devil was just a little "too nice" in my opinion,
especially in the end, but then again, the film itself isn't exactly based
in airtight reality. Overall, I would say that it's a safe, easy-going,
fantasy puffball with fun performances from the leads, but definitely less
than what its premise sets it up to be. I was hoping for more.

Director Harold Ramis (ANALYZE THIS and GROUNDHOG DAY) has remade the 
1967 film BEDAZZLED, starring Dudley Moore, and, in short, it's a hoot.  
In fact it is so successfully funny and sweet that it almost makes you 
thankful for Hollywood's much maligned tendency to remake old films 
rather than risk creating completely new ones.  Almost.
When we meet Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser in another charmingly 
hilarious performance), he is the cubical clown.  An obnoxious office 
worker, he is the type who causes his coworkers to hide when they see 
him coming.  A born loser, he is a little boy who doesn't have a clue 
how to grow up.  He may have the sexual and romantic desires of an 
adult, but he has the social skills of the most unpopular kid in seventh 
grade.
Right now he is pining for Allison, preciously played by Frances 
O'Connor (MANSFIELD PARK), a woman who has the natural good looks of a 
shampoo model.  Allison works for the same company that he does, and a 
few years ago he even said something to her about the weather when he 
saw her in the lobby.  "Dear God, I would give anything to have that 
girl in my life," he says to himself after getting a polite brush off 
from her when he runs into her at a nightclub.
God doesn't answer, but the other side does, in the strikingly beautiful 
person of Elizabeth Hurley, as The Devil.  Hurley is playful, witty, 
erotic, conniving and perfect as the Princess of Darkness.  It is by far 
and away the best thing that she has ever done.
As you can guess, wishes become a dangerous thing for Elliot.  The 
Devil, literally dumping a tome of a contract on him that only the IRS 
could love ("I, Elliot Richards, hereafter called The Damned, ..."), 
makes him a simple bargain.  He can have any seven wishes he wants in 
return for his soul.
These seven wishes form seven wholly contained and wildly funny 
episodes.  The interludes between wishes are equally humorous as The 
Devil wreaks small incidents of chaos and destruction on the populace as 
a way to pass the time until she collects Elliot's soul.  
The Devil tries to explain to Elliot what a miserable job she has.  
"It's not easy being the Barbra Streisand of evil, you know," she 
confides in him, who isn't particularly sympathetic as she is making his 
life, well, hell.  She delights in letting him hang himself by not 
specifying enough of the fine print on his wishes.  When he asks to be 
married and rich, for example, he doesn't think to specify how faithful 
his wife will be or the origin of his newfound wealth.  
The Devil and Elliot's costumes and makeup are more than worth the price 
of admission.  When we first glimpse Beelzebub, she is in a killer of a 
tight fitting red dress with maximum cleavage.  Other outfits include a 
meter maid in hot pants and a mini-skirted teacher that would be every 
high school boy's fantasy.  Elliot's look ranges from that of a model 
for the cover of a bodice-ripper novel to the world's dumbest and 
largest jock.  His various teeth alone are such a source of mirth that 
they should be worth some kind of special Oscar consideration.
The movie does a great job of getting all of the details right.  
Elliot's first wish, for example, is his simplest, but watch how much 
comedic gold they mine from the way The Devil even cons Elliot out of 
his own money.
Larry Gelbart, Harold Ramis and Peter Tolan's script, based on the 1967 
version by Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, is full of great lines.  It has 
Elliot, depending on his current wish, sounding pompously pretentious, 
idiotically inarticulate or saccharinely sentimental.  ("Do you need 
comforting on any level?" a nerdy Elliot with little teeth and short 
curly, red hair inquires of Allison, which freaks her out.  "Have I said 
or done anything to make you feel less good about you?")
Rather than becoming repetitive and eventually sagging, the comedy 
builds energy as it goes.  It has more big laughs than I could count, 
with the Devil, who gets a bit less screen time, getting just as many as 
Elliot.  Actually just the costumes and other visuals were enough for 
many of the laughs.  The movie even finds a satisfying small twist to 
wrap it up.  BEDAZZLED is a good-spirited comedy that entertains us 
every minute from the opening credits to the last scene.  It's a real 
charmer.
BEDAZZLED runs a fast 1:33.  The film is in English as well as Spanish 
and Russian with English subtitles.  It is rated PG-13 for sex-related 
humor, language and some drug content and would be acceptable for kids 
around 11 and up.

"Bedazzled" should have been a corker of a movie. A loose remake of the
well-regarded 1967 comedy written by and starring Peter Cook and Dudley
Moore, the story of a love struck loser who sells his soul in exchange
for seven wishes is serviceable enough. Leading man Brendan Fraser has a
good track record with comedy and Elizabeth Hurley certainly has the
physical assets necessary to make a sultry Devil. As if all that wasn't
enough, the director of the production is Harold Ramis, the man behind
"Caddyshack," "Groundhog Day" and "Analyze This."
"Bedazzled" should have been a corker, but the results are only
moderately amusing. Fraser is overly cartoonish, as are most of the
supporting players, and the love story is too superficial to be
involving. Overall, the film plays like an expensive episode of a TV
sketch comedy series.
The problems begin with a sloppy script by Larry Gelbart ("M*A*S*H"),
Ramis and Peter Tolan. Their story revolves around Elliot Richards
(Fraser), a computer tech-support worker with godawful social skills.
Mocked and shunned by his co-workers, Elliot pines for Alison (Frances
O'Connor), a beautiful fellow employee he has worshipped from afar.
After blowing an encounter with her at a nightspot, he says aloud that
he would "give anything" to have the woman.
Enter Lucifer, in the form of Elizabeth Hurley. In exchange for his
soul, she offers him seven wishes. Elliot leaps at the chance, only to
discover that Beelzebub has no intentions of giving him a smooth ride.
Elliot wishes he was rich, powerful and married to Alison. In a flash,
he gets his wish, only to learn that he is a rich, powerful Colombian
drug lord with enemies everywhere. Alison is indeed his wife, but she
detests him.
And so goes the game, as Elliot keeps trying to make the perfect wish,
while Satan continues to find some flaw in his wording that will allow
her to make his life a nightmare.
This type of story has been done a million times, but even the most worn
idea can work if the writers are sufficiently inventive. In "Groundhog
Day," Ramis took a similar set-up, which gave the hero multiple chances
to win the heart of a woman, and crafted a comedy that was as sweet and
touching as it was funny. He did so by allowing his protagonist to grow
from a one-note wiseass into a rounded human being and by allowing the
romance to grow from superficial attraction to something far more
substantial.
Don't look for any growth here. Elliot remains a buffoon throughout the
film, until the closing moments, when Ramis and company whack him upside
the head with an unconvincing epiphany. In the romance department, don't
expect anything deeper than "I want her. Let's cast another spell."
There was a moral to "Groundhog Day," one that was appreciated because
we saw it lived out on the screen. The moral in "Bedazzled" is so
slapped on that the filmmakers actually feel the need to have a
character state it aloud.
As for the comedy, where "Groundhog Day" moved from physical shtick to
subtler humor, "Bedazzled" sticks with slapstick and sight gags. The
story trudges from one sketch to another, a la "Saturday Night Live,"
with varying degrees of success. Expect everything from dick jokes to a
short, but sweet Abe Lincoln routine. The worst is a dated Dennis Rodman
bit, while the best is a cute piece of business, nicked from the
original film, involving Satan and a row of parking meters.
The lead actors add to the film's troubles. As Elliot the nerd, Brendan
Fraser overplays his part. In the "Superman" movies, Christopher Reeve
made a great Man of Steel, but a lousy Clark Kent, burying his character
in a load of facial twitches and excessive stammering. Fraser does the
same thing, turning Elliot from an insecure guy to a grating dork
caricature. As with Reeve, Fraser fails to realize that, when it comes
to self-conscious males, less is more.
Meanwhile, Elizabeth Hurley is content to coo her way through the film,
changing costumes frequently, to the delight of the guys in the row
behind me. While most of her outfits are red designer devil wear, her
sexiest moment comes during a classroom scene, where she sports the
adult version of the classic Catholic schoolgirl outfit. Hurley's acting
is competent at best, though she does get to coolly informs Elliot,
"Yes, there's a God and, yes, he's a man. Most men think they're God 
this one just happens to be right."
Despite the occasionally solid one-liners, Hurley's performance lacks
bite, which is the main failing of "Bedazzled." If talented filmmakers
take on themes as familiar as this, it should be because they have
designed a bracing new approach to the material. When they put their own
movie on cruise control, you wonder why they bothered with the project
at all. Or more to the point, why should we?

At the risk of making a throwaway pun, "Bedazzled," directed by Harold Ramis 
(1993's "Groundhog Day"), is a devilishly enjoyable and savvy comedy that 
ends of packing quite a heavier punch by its conclusion than could have ever 
been expected. A loose remake of the 1967 Dudley Moore-starrer of the same 
name, the film is one of those rare cases in which the movie completely 
blindsides you, both because of its vast improvement over the unextraordinary 
theatrical trailer, and because of the unextraordinary trailer, which wisely 
does not even hint at how utterly imaginative and clever the proceedings are. 
Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser) is a gawky computer consultant who is a 
genuinely nice guy that, nevertheless, is the type of eager-to-please person 
most people try to avoid having to confront in a conversation. Amid his 
odd-man-out treatment, his one true love is Alison Gardner (Frances 
O'Connor), a fetching coworker of Elliot's for three years who doesn't even 
know he exists. After a failed attempt to strike up a conversation with 
Alison at a bar, Elliot is distracted by a sultry, alluringly sexy woman 
(Elizabeth Hurley) who informs him that she is the Devil incarnate, and has 
come to grant him seven wishes in exchange for his soul. Following a round of 
persuasion tactics, the Devil convinces Elliot to sign the contract and wish 
away. But there's only one hitch: in her dastardly plan, with every wish he 
makes, the Devil wickedly misconstrues things so that they not work out for 
him.
One of the genuine pleasures of "Bedazzled" is in not only seeing where each 
of Elliot's wishes takes him, but how the Devil conditions each wish to only 
turn out negatively for him. Aside from the tiresome, overlong first 
vignette, in which he wishes to be rich, powerful, and married to Alison, 
only to become a Colombian drug lord under attack whose wife despises him, 
the movie is unadulterated fun from beginning to end, even when it appears to 
be nothing more than harmless fluff. 
Had "Bedazzled" stayed on its predictable main course from beginning to end, 
the picture would be admirable, but hardly memorable. However, the 
screenplay, by Larry Gelbart, Harold Ramis, and Peter Tolan, is a rare comedy 
straight out of mainstream Hollywood that is actually ambitious in both its 
ideas and snappy writing, and concludes with several emotionally rewarding 
scenes that do not completely abandon their humorous roots, but clearly and 
wisely hold a valid moral, like any useful fairy tale. 
In a multilayered role that, once and for all, ties up all doubts about his 
clear talent as a performer, Brendan Fraser (1999's "Dudley Do-Right") not 
only carries the film as the lovable, insecure Elliot, but also is given the 
chance to jump into the part and become (among others) a well-loved 7 1/2' 
pro basketball player, a highly intelligent and fashionable gay man, and the 
world's most emotionally sensitive guy. After a string of forgettable 
characters (including the aforementioned "Dudley Do-Right" and 1999's "The 
Mummy"), Fraser is back with a movie that fully exposes how very good he can 
be.
In what is inarguably the best performance I've seen her give, to date, 
Elizabeth Hurley singlehandedly steals the show as the "Princess of 
Darkness." Clearly exhibiting that she's having a fun time, Hurley digs into 
the tricky role with great relish, being both very funny and, at times, 
surprisingly threatening. What is so impressive about the writing is the way 
the movie dabbles in slapstick every now and again, but despite its fantastic 
nature, seems to be planted firmly in reality when dealing with the 
characters. Hurley's Lucifer could have easily been written as an evil, 
one-dimensional type, but she isn't; it is clear that she likes Elliot and 
maybe even grows to care about his well-being, but is, nonetheless, stuck 
going against his yearning for happiness due to her decidedly high title as 
king (or is it queen?) of the underworld.
Throughout the just-right 92-minute running time, "Bedazzled" is whimsical 
and reasonably lighthearted, but because Elliot has, indeed, sold his soul to 
Satan, the viewer is understandable to wonder how exactly the movie could 
conclude with a happy ending. Without giving any details away, director 
Harold Ramis finds the perfect climactic approach, striking a satisfying 
chord and holding it until the end credits. It's not every week that you see 
a movie that surpasses all expectations (no matter how high or low they may 
be) to become a first-rate film worth seeing by all, but "Bedazzled" does 
just that. It's a wonderfully original and entertaining comedy--the rarest of 
breeds.

 We all want to be loved and respected, but how far are we
willing to go to achieve that? Tech-support nerd Elliot Richards
(Brendan Fraser) is a sad, lonely man in search of popularity. Plus,
he's totally besotted by a co-worker (Frances O'Connor), so when he
sighs, "I'd give anything to have that girl in my life," it seems like
an open invitation to sell his immortal soul to the Devil (Elizabeth
Hurley) in exchange for seven wishes. But the Princess of Darkness has
a great sense of mischief. When he asks to be rich and powerful, he
becomes a Colombian drug lord. When he wants to be a star NBA player,
he's more Dennis Rodman than Michael Jordan. He's equally dismayed as
a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and as President of the United States
(Abraham Lincoln going to the Ford Theater). Versatile Brendan
Fraser's dexterous physical transformations into these characters are
impressive; as the various incarnations of the woman he desires,
Australian actress Frances O'Connor's dialects are on-target; and
sophisticated supermodel Elizabeth Hurley embodies a wickedly witty,
lusty Lucifer, saucily dressed as titillating male fantasies (nurse,
cheerleader, cop, French maid, etc.).  Orlando Jones, Miriam Shor,
Paul Adelstein and Toby Huss lend strong support. But, beneath the
glossy hi-jinks, the screenplay by Larry Gelbart, Harold Ramis & Peter
Tolan, based on a story by Peter Cook (which was made into a 1967
movie with Dudley Moore), is little more than an amusing series of
comedy sketches. While director Harold Ramis knows how to milk a gag
'till it's dry, this is no "Caddyshack" or "Animal House." On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Bedazzled" is a sinfully silly 6 as
the pathetic hero's dreams become nightmares - and stay for the
closing credits.

     I think you can learn a lot about somebody by just knowing what
comedies he finds funny.  Within my top three funniest comedies is
the 1967 BEDAZZLED, a film directed by Stanley Donen, but most of
the humor and creativity came from the erudite British comedy team
of Peter Cook and Dudley Moore who with this film were at the top of
their form.  The humor of that film could be lampooning Christopher
Marlowe's play DOCTOR FAUSTUS (the inspiration for BEDAZZLED) one
moment and then be drolly slapstick the next.  And perhaps the
moment after that it would be presenting some profound insight on
the Bible and religion.  Being so eclectic and literate, the
original is a film that gracefully shows its age but never dates.
It is a comedy that does not need to be remade for modern audiences.
If anything, it needs to be annotated.  Remaking it is a project
that is hazardous from the first.
     In the remake Elliot Richardson (played by Brendan Fraser)
works on a computer help desk.  Most of the people in his office
would apparently prefer solitary confinement to having to deal with
him.  Elliot has a not so secret crush on the demure Allison
(Frances O'Connor) who has worked in the same office for four years
and never even noticed the obnoxious Elliot was there.  Elliot runs
into Allison in a bar and tries to make small talk only to be
snubbed.  But wait, the evening is not over.  There is an absolutely
stunning woman in the bar who seems more than a little interested in
Elliot.  Elliot is skeptical, but no, it turns out she is not a
hooker.  She is something a little bit worse.  She is the Devil
(Elizabeth Hurley) in human form.  And she has a deal for Elliot.
She will give him seven wishes in return for his soul.  With each
wish Elliot can become somebody else.  He can specify what he will
be like, what other people will be like, anything that comes into
his head.  And with each wish, of course, the Devil finds some nasty
way to live up to the letter of the wish but to completely subvert
the spirit.  After all, isn't that what the Devil does?
     First, what was done well about this film?  Some of the jokes
are fairly clever and some (only some) of those are original.  I did
find myself laughing at this film.  The credit sequence gives you a
Devil's eye view of the world and the people in it with little tags
to tell you their deep secrets.  That is a clever idea.  The premise
of the multiple wishes and how the Devil is tricky is done almost as
well as in the earlier film.  With each wish Elliot's appearance
changes to fit the wish and at least some of his appearances are
quite funny.  The Devil's general mischief is not as inspired as it
is in the first film, but several of the jokes are funny.  If the
first film did not exist, this would be at least a clever,
watchable, and enjoyable comedy.
     The problem is that there are places where this film is almost
as good as the original, but many other places where it in no way
comes close.  Almost all of the banter based on the classics of
literature and religion are gone.  In the original the holes in the
main character's wishes made subtle philosophical points.  There is
little such intelligence in this screenplay.  What this film does
offer that the first film did not is some machine guns, a short
chase involving a helicopter, and a large traffic accident, all
fairly common and by now boring stuff.  The ending of the original
was hardly brilliant, but the remake simplifies it and dumbs it down
so that it is maudlin and really betrays the spirit of the film.
     Brendan Fraser's best work was in the serious dramas SCHOOL
TIES and GODS AND MONSTERS, but through practice he is becoming an
accomplished comic actor.  He manages a tour de force playing
several externally different characterizations, reminding one of
Alec Guinness in KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS.  The film's replacement
of the lackluster Peter Cook with the seductive Elizabeth Hurley as
the Devil may be slightly an improvement, but the lackluster was
part of the joke.  One feels that if the Devil could look any way
he/she wanted to, that the choice would be to look like Hurley.
Frances O'Connor needs to do little but be demure and attractive,
and she does little more in her role.  It is interesting that
English-born women were chosen as the two stars of this remake of an
English comedy.
     For me, this attempt was as misguided as would be an attempt to
remake CITIZEN KANE.  The result could have been worse, I suppose,
but naturally my recommendation would be to see the original rather
than the remake.  Still this version gets 5 on the 0 to 10 scale and
a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.

     There truly is nothing quite like a Brendan Fraser movie, is
there?  Encino Man, Dudley Do-Right, Mrs. Winterbourne... these are the
films that a generation uses to mark the passage of time.
     It's nigh time we added another sparkling gem to the 30-picture
oeuvre that is The Brendan Fraser Experience... and that gem is
Bedazzled, a limp remake of a 1967 Dudley Moore vehicle -- a Dudley
Moore vehicle which was also co-written by Dudley Moore.  Just so you
know we're working with some stellar raw material here.
     The high concept of Bedazzled gives us Elizabeth Hurley as the
devil (Peter Cook played him in the original), who gives Fraser's
über-nerd Elliot seven wishes in exchange for his soul.  Hurley makes a
surprisingly believable Satan.  Up close, her angular features and
hollow gaze make her as frightening as she is gorgeous, not to mention
the annoying bouncy walk that makes you dizzy to watch and a wardrobe
change factor that clocks in at once every six minutes.
     Elliot dreams up every wish he can think of to try to make his
office crush Allison (Frances O'Connor) fall for him.  Soon he's a
Columbian drug lord, then a basketball star, then an effete socialite. 
But naturally, that darned devil somehow makes it all go wrong!  Elliot
needs to watch more episodes of Bewitched! to learn the dangers of
wishing improperly.
     As each wish turns out worse than the last, we are offered the
chance to laugh at the wacky antics on display before us.  Look, Elliot
can suddenly speak Spanish!  Look, Elliot suddenly speaks like a moron! 
Look, Elliot is suddenly very smart!  Of course, you may choose not to
laugh at many of these scenes if you wish.  I know I didn't.
     Bedazzled drags its one-joke scenes through far too many
poorly-timed comic moments, with each of its hokey-jokey sequences going
on for far longer than is humanly funny (notably one scene about Elliot
having been given a small willy becomes truly painful).  Of course, I
guess this is unavoidable if you're simply trying to pad out 90 minutes
of screen time with something.
     To try and spice things up, director Harold Ramis inserts the
supporting cast of Elliot's co-workers into each vignette, where they
reappear as new characters.  Wow, inventive!  Then there are numerous
and utterly bizarre "comedy" moments, complete non-sequiturs to the
film, which are used as interludes between each "wish" sequence.  Mostly
this consists of Hurley's devil causing traffic accidents, etc.  You
know, just for kicks.
     And what's with Frances O'Connor as the romantic lead?  O'Connor,
best known (okay, solely known) for starring in the recent Mansfield
Park, with her jutting forehead and wallflower stage presence, makes for
a love interest about as exciting as a wet brick.  Jeez, why not have
Hurley and Fraser get it on?  I guess we'd bust through PG-13 with
something like that.
     Aside from a few juvenile giggles, there's not much in Bedazzled
worth mentioning.  The movie is so limp it is all but forgotten on the
ride home.  So what was I saying?

Harold Ramis's movies are often difficult to review because they're just so 
good and solid it's hard to pick up on a particular aspect or niche and write 
around. "Bedazzled" is a good example of this. It's a straight comedy about a 
loser who sells his soul to the devil for some wishes but nothing goes as 
planned and hilarity ensues. It's certainly nothing genius but it is funny 
and entertaining. 
Brendan Fraser stars as Elliot Richards, a geeky dork who works as a tech 
support operator at a computer company. Elliot is the kind of guy who's in a 
deep state of loser denial: he tries to fit in with the other guys in the 
office by talking in outdated slang and constantly fake smiling and laughing 
but they all politely reject him. One of the first scenes shows him talking 
to an African-American co-worker asking him if he wants to play basketball 
after work and says, "Make sure you tell me the right time to be 
there because last time when I showed up you guys were all leaving." 
You can pretty much get the grasp of Fraser's character in just the first few 
scenes. Everyone knows someone like this so you're not just laughing at the 
character being funny in a comedy, you're laughing because you've seen this 
type of person do the type of things he does. You roll your eyes and you 
can't help but laugh at him being a goof. And thankfully Ramis doesn't resort 
to a lot of slapstick and sight gags (a la Kramer on "Seinfeld"), he just 
gives Elliot a lot of good lines and Fraser does a good job in playing the 
character. 
Of course whenever you have a nerd you have to have a bombshell for him to 
secretly be in love with. Frances O'Connor plays that character, a pretty 
brunette named Alison who is surprised when Elliot approaches her in a bar 
trying to make casual conversation and of course politely rejects him. 
Enter Elizabeth Hurley as the devil who knows how desperate Elliot and he'd 
be an easy target for a soul exchange. I think this is the first movie where 
the devil comes in the form of a woman and a hot chick at that. Hurley is as 
sexy as the role requires her to be. She oozes attraction and doesn't have to 
try very hard to persuade Elliot to trade his soul for seven wishes. It's 
predictable of course but it's not forced or trite - kind of cartoony but 
with a naughty adult appeal. 
And so Elliot proceeds to make his wishes, each involves a major lifestyle 
change that he thinks would be the key to getting Alison. 
I think a rule of movies, or pretty much any medium of fiction, is that if 
you make a wish to a wish granter you'll get it but there will be a price to 
pay for it. Edgar Allen Poe's "The Monkey's Paw" is a classic example of this 
and "Bedazzled" works in much the same way. Elliot wishes to be rich and 
powerful and married to Alison so the devil turns him into a Colombian drug 
lord whose wife is cheating on him. Technically he got his wish. 
That's how all the wishes Elliot makes turn out. He gets what he wishes for 
but they're all fulfilled as literally as he asked for them. There's a scene 
where Elliot wishes he could be the most sensitive guy in the world because 
he knows women want that in men, but even that backfires on him. That scene 
takes place on a beach and every time Elliot turns to look at the sunset he 
weeps and it drives Alison crazy. 
What "Bedazzled" secretly has going for it is the satire at work during every 
wish sequence. The sensitivity wish is a great example of this. Another is 
when Elliot becomes a pro basketball player and we see the announcers talking 
about how he's broken every record Michael Jordan and Wilt Chamberlain ever 
set. After the game he's interviewed by a reporter saying jargon so inane 
it's hilarious. He can't answer any question flat-out, he just says, "It was 
a team effort... you gotta give 110%... you can't give up." Meanwhile sweat 
is pouring down his face so hard it soaks the reporter. 
The film maintains balance by not making the surprises too ridiculous - 
they're fluffy and iconic enough to work in a mainstream movie. You know, the 
kind of stuff that might happen in a Jim Carrey flick only without the 
gross-out factor. Fraser is able to effectively hold his own in every 
outrageous scenario and still keep Elliot in character. The film utilizes the 
supporting characters in a "Wizard Of Oz" way where they are all play roles 
within each wish scenario. Orlando Jones (the 7-Up guy) is the best of them, 
however, the others are a little weak (think of a sub-par "Saturday Night 
Live" sketch). 
The ending's a nice breath of fresh air. Sure it's as standard as they come 
but it's not corny or sappy or anything so annoying as most comedies tend to 
rely on for effect. 
All in all "Bedazzled" works because it's put together well and doesn't try 
to be anything it's not. It has potential to be an innovative satire but 
works fine as a plain old "ha ha" comedy.

The heavy message and soul-searing images in BAMBOOZLED took a lot out
of me, so I looked forward to seeing a light comedy afterwards.  And
BEDAZZLED was about as light as it tolerably gets.
The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
BEDAZZLED, a remake of the 1967 Faustian romantic comedy starring Dudley
Moore as the hapless soul willing to sell his soul to Peter Cook's
Devil, stars Brendan Fraser as Elliot Richards (aka The Hapless Soul)
and Elizabeth Hurley as The Devil.
Poor dorky Elliot is a computer consultant living the stereotypical geek
life; he tries too hard to get people to like him, his co-workers
(including a restrained Orlando Jones as Dan) don't want to hang out
with him, and the girl of his dreams, Allison (Frances O'Connor), barely
knows he's alive.  When Elliot wishes aloud that he'd do anything to
have Allison in his life, The Devil appears - to see if "anything"
includes Elliot's soul, in exchange for seven "be careful what you wish
for" wishes.
Naturally - you guessed it - Wackiness Ensues.
The Upshot:
You've heard me say it before: remakes generally grind my gizzards.
This one, though, didn't seem to bother me as much, for some reason.
Elizabeth Hurley is no Peter Cook; likewise, Brendan Fraser can't touch
the Comedy Stylings of Dudley Moore.  But Fraser and Hurley worked
reasonably well together, the ObPuns weren't too obviously painful [The
"DV8" Club.  Ha.] and the supporting players were given enough to do
(especially in the basketball wish segment) to not totally make one
wonder why they were given individual names (instead of "Elliot's Friend
One, Two, and Three").  And though the movie petered out once the
"...and what did we learn?" phase kicked into high gear, the fun of
watching dorky Elliot come back even more wacky as the butt uuuuugly
Sensitive Guy, was worth suffering through the obvious Lesson we were
meant to learn about Being Happy With Ourselves.
[Why yes, that was the shortest review I've done to date.  What else is
there to say?  "I laughed, I didn't cry, I didn't want to run away and
join the circus"?  It was a fun way to waste 93 minutes.  It's not
exactly brain surgery, y'know].
The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
I must've gotten too much of whatever The Devil gave to Elliot to make
him so emotionally sensitive.  Can't figure out why else I'd notice the
opening credit labels "she" placed on the jumping African ("Bad Credit")
or the old Black diner patron ("Tips 5%").  I'm sure it was just an
after-effect of having been Awakened by BAMBOOZLED not long before
watching this movie.  Besides, the BF in BEDAZZLED can't be all that
bad, considering who "God" wound up being...
Bammer's Bottom Line:
A cute remake that is neither earthshakingly funny nor overly
sacrilegious (to the original, that is), BEDAZZLED provided enough
laughs to make it worth seeing once.  Though unless you're a glutton for
punishment like me (having seen four new movies over two days), you
might want to put it off for the matinee.
BEDAZZLED (rating: flashing yellowlight):
But now I miss Dudley Moore and Peter Cook that much more.

   We all know the expression, "Be careful what you wish for:
you may get it," but something doesn't sound quite right
about that.  How could we possibly not want what we want? 
Harold Ramis comes along with a dynamic visual accounting
in the updating of the 1967 film with the same name, but this
"Bedazzled" follows only the bare bones of the Dudley
Moore/Peter Cook movie.  Add some eye-popping special
effects, proceed at a relentlessly fast pace, and lay on sight
gags that work far more often than not, and you've got a
picture that will entertain the eggheads in the audience as
much as the popcorn crowd.  With Elizabeth Hurley, suited up
by costumer Deena Appel and making ferocious love to Bill
Pope's camera as the most attractive Devil ever, "Bedazzled"
is a surefire comedy hit that allows her and Brendan Fraser
to strut their stuff in diverse comic characterizations.
  Now then.  How does one mess up the seven wishes that
Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser) is allowed to make once he
has summoned up The Devil (Elizabeth Hurley)?  Simple. 
Instead of wishing to replace his nerdish self as a geekie
technical troubleshooter at a computer firm with the guise of
a handsome, well-rounded, hard-working and lovable fellow,
he aspires instead for abstracts characteristics: smartest man
alive; best athlete; most sensitive guy; VIP; richest and most
powerful dude in the world.  What's wrong with those
attributes?  Simply that they are extremes, and each time he
is fitted out by the Devil with a feature he wants, he goes so
far with that trait that he subverts what he truly desires.
   While the Faust of the classic story by Goethe wishes for
youth and the love of the woman of his dreams to replace his
dry and dusty scholarly properties, Elliot already has youth.
The trouble is that he is unable to do anything with the very
trait for which Faust sold his soul to Mephistopheles.  He
hasn't the social graces, the intelligence, the money, or the
influence that could charm Alison (Frances O'Connor) with
whom he has worked for four years--though Alison cannot
even recall ever seeing the lonely guy before.  Wishing for
great riches, the Devil turns Elliot into a Colombian drug lord
who runs into trouble with his customers.  For athetic
prowess, he trumps even Michael Jordan but comes up short
in another department.  As a VIP he barely escapes
assassination and as a brainy author, he talks too much to
the woman he meets and aches for.
   This is just the bare bones of a series of delightful visual
gags.  Not a single skit falters as the jokes come on more
consistently than Stanley Donen turned out at the helm of the
1967 version of the movie.  Fraser, a favorite of the 20-
something market, has already compiled an impressive
resume in movies like "The Mummy," "George of the Jungle"
and the superior "Gods and Monsters," and here struts his
stuff with the long hair of a Colombian drug kingpin whose
money, power, and status as the husband of the lovely Alison
do not lead to happiness; in the freckled face of the sensitive
guy who could cry at a beautiful sunset; as the well-dressed,
sophisticated denizen of parties for the cognoscenti; and
more.  
   Fraser's chemistry with the lovely Elizabeth Hurley is
striking, even convincing us that the young man has a special
spot in the Devil's heart that makes her feel sorry enough for
him to do one good, gratuitous deed to sew up the story. 
And the Australian performer, Frances O'Connor establishes
herself as one who is not to be overwhelmed by the star
power of Fraser and Hurley as she throws herself into the
diverse roles as a would-be partner to Elliot.
   Rick Heinrichs' production design looks expensive,
imprinting on us a vision of a traditional hell populated with all
the characters that had done Elliot wrong including his co-
workers--who are played adeptly by Miriam Shor, Orland
Jones, Paul Adelstein, and Toby Huss.  To my eyes, the best
scene in the 93-minute story, however, does not involve
Fraser's presence at all.  The Devil, who shows up from time
to time doing her own thing when she is not serving Elliot,
takes the role of a 9th-grade teacher whose board is filled
with algebraic equations, some commentary on the history of
wars, and a homework assignment.  Erasing each in turn--
"you'll never use this [algebra]," "what's over is over," and "no
homework"--she evokes more cheers from her blazer-
costumed students than a squad of cheerleaders could elicit
at touchdown time.

The Devil made him do it, and the Devil's a gorgeous she in a revealing
red dress. "Bedazzled" is a story about a desperate computer geek who
signs away his immortal soul in exchange for seven wishes, which all
center around him getting a girl from his workplace he has fallen in
love with, but who doesn't even notice him.
Before Hollywood got a hold of this theme, literature did. Writers such
as Christopher Marlowe, in his 16th century book on Faust and Goethe,
writing about Faust in the 18th century, used this theme. However,
"Bedazzled" is a remake of a more vulgar source for the Faust legend,
Stanley Donen's 1967 very funny satire, which starred (and was written
by) Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. This "Bedazzled" provides some
lighthearted fun with the theme, but is not quite as wicked and not as
funny. It allows the main character to learn the folly of getting what
you wish for, as in the process of seeing all his wishes fizzle out
after he gets them, he smartens up and learns to tone down his obnoxious
behavior and relax by being himself, therefore becoming a much wiser
person. It almost seemed ridiculously out of place to hear him become so
virtuous from this experience, a humanitarian who realizes that he can't
sell his soul because he never owned it.
The action takes place in modern San Francisco. Brendan Fraser is Elliot
Richards, a loser with a nerdy smile, who is a computer tech-support
worker whose fellow workers find him intolerable and make a considerable
effort to find ways of not being with him. The Devil comes by way of the
very sexy and witty Elizabeth Hurley, who tempts him with a chance to
get his workplace Alison (Frances O'Connor), if he just signs the
contract. Hurley gives this film its purpose and sense of tart humor,
but even her role seems punchless and absurd. Though, it is hard to
understand why the geek wasn't more tuned into her and used one of the
seven wishes granted to bag her instead of the rather ordinary Frances.
Frances O'Connor does an adequate job in a role that mainly requires her
to be desirable in many different ways. She has a sweet smile and shows
she can display a nifty tantrum, but compared to Hurley's beauty and
wit, she comes off second best in both categories and would not have
been my first wish. Besides, the Devil owns a trendy nightspot and
drives the stylishly expensive Lamborghini Diablo, and seems to have her
pulse on what's happening in town.
All seven wishes are played out as comedy sketches, with some being
terrible, filled with stereotype gags and dull-witted humor, such as the
one where he becomes the witty author who is well-equipped but learns
that he is gay; some of them do have some spark, like the dumb giant
N.B.A. basketball player with the tiny private part, and the one with
the Colombian drug lord who is married to Alison, but she hates him and
disses him for one of his underlings. Fraser draws great comedy from his
ever-changing facial expressions as he learns he can speak Spanish, and
the best of these is, when he becomes the most sensitive man in the
world who loses Alison to a beach jock, as she can't take his
sensitivity anymore as he cries at how beautiful the sunset is; while
others were too thinly sketched and drew no laughs, such as when he is
President Lincoln.
The film uses the same actors who play Fraser's unfriendly co- workers
as comic characters in all the wish sketches, which adds a feeling of
continuity, but it is played as if this material was more suited for a
revue than a film.
What this film lacked was a real sense of outrageousness, it seemed more
like a benign TV comedy hour program than a satire that goes for
something devilish. It painted too clean a picture of everyone. Every
wish seemed reduntant and doomed to failure because Fraser didn't know
how to be specific when he made his wishes. I think Harold Ramis could
have come up with funnier and less obvious skits, there was a lot to
play around with here that wasn't even attempted. The film went mostly
for the physical humor of Brendan Fraser, who is no Buster Keaton and
can't carry an entire film with his comic antics. The viewer watched him
transform himself cleverly in each skit, but the film wasn't funny
enough for it to sparkle that way, except in a few instances. I think
when you make a remake, it should clearly be better than the other
version or else it seems to me, there is no reason to make a remake.

If I didn't know it was a remake, I'd swear Bedazzled was modeled after
two of the annual `Treehouse of Horror' episodes of The Simpsons.  One
involved Homer getting four wishes from a magical Moroccan monkey's paw,
and in the other Homer sold his soul to the Devil Flanders for a donut.
But Bedazzled IS a remake.  The original, a 1967 film written by and
starring Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, was about a hapless fry cook that
unsuccessfully tried to off himself because he couldn't work up the
nerve to ask out a pretty waitress.  In pops the Devil, who offers the
loser seven wishes, each of which revolve around the seven deadly sins
(Raquel Welch played Lust).
The new version isn't quite as dark.  The main character isn't suicidal,
and the deadly sins are completely omitted.  But the biggest change to
the original is the fact that the Devil is played by a scantily clad
supermodel.  The result is a light, entertaining film that is probably
the best family comedy to be released in several months.
After the clever opening credits, where anonymous citizens are literally
labeled `bad tipper,' `horny,' and `cheats on taxes,' we are introduced
to Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser, The Mummy), a customer service rep
for a San Francisco-based computer company called Synedyne.  Elliot is
essentially a grown-up version of Jason Biggs' Paul Tannek from Loser.
He's despised by the co-workers he thinks are his friends and longs to
be with a Synedyne employee named Allison (Frances O'Connor, Mansfield
Park), who is way out of Elliot's league.
One evening in a bar, Elliot's `friends' talk him into approaching
Allison, who, of course, blows him off.  Exasperated, Elliot says that
he would do anything to win her affection, at which point the Devil
(Estee Lauder scab Elizabeth Hurley, Edtv) appears and offers to make
all of his dreams come true via seven wishes.  Elliot is skeptical, but
he eventually begins making wishes, all of which turn out horribly
wrong.
Admirably, the trailers for Bedazzled show only Elliot's first wish, in
which he requests to be rich and powerful, but becomes a Columbian drug
lord.  In each of the wish sequences, which incorporate Elliot's
co-workers Wizard of Oz-style, Fraser gets to play a completely
different character, some of which don't resemble the actor at all.  His
performance is just as good as Eddie Murphy in The Nutty Professor
films.
The beauty of the film becomes watching Elliot wish for the wrong thing
over and over again, while everybody knows that he should have asked to
be a sexually ambiguous magician, because that's the only sure-fire way
to land hot babes.  Elliot never even figures out how to drag out his
wishes to ask for more things, unlike Homer, who covered himself by
being very specific.
`I wish for a turkey sandwich on rye bread with lettuce and mustard.
And  AND I don't want any zombie turkeys, I don't want to turn into a
turkey myself, and I don't want any other weird surprises  you got it?'
Bedazzled was directed by Harold Ramis (Analyze This), who co-adapted
the script with Larry Gelbart (Tootsie) and Peter Tolan (Analyze This).
The film's ending is very flat and doesn't show enough of Elliot's
character growth.  Hurley is at her least annoying and her least dressed
(the former probably has some effect on the latter).  O'Connor is good,
but looks disturbingly like Mariah Carey in several scenes.

Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser) is a socially inept guy who alienates
those around him with his overbearing manner, constantly failing when he
tries to be hip. He's also had a years-long crush on a co-worker, Alison
Gardner (Frances O'Connor), but she barely knows he even exists. Desperate,
he asks God to help him. Instead, a knockout, gorgeous woman (Elizabeth
Hurley), claiming to be the Devil, offers him a deal - seven wishes in
exchange for his mortal soul, in director Harold Ramis's update of the 1967
flick, "Bedazzled."
It has been many years since I saw the original "Bedazzled" with Dudley
Moore as Faust and Peter Cook in the Mephistophelean role. The inherent
silliness of the earlier movie - at one point, Moore bounces on a
trampoline while dressed as a nun - didn't appeal to me. I had hopes that
the modern update would be an improvement, especially with the likable
Brenda Fraser taking on the Faustian role.
The new "Bedazzled" may not garner any awards or attention for its actors
at the end of the year, but it is still a fun little flick that is easy on
the head and, with Hurley as a sexy Devil, easy on the eyes, too. It's also
a good showcase for the comedy and acting talents of Fraser. I liked the
young actor from the very beginning when he appeared as a caveman thrust
into modern times in "Encino Man," He also held his own, in a serious perf,
opposite Ian McKellar in the marvelous 1998 movie, "Gods and Monsters."
Here, in "Bedazzled," Fraser gets the chance to play a variety of
characters, all as Elliot, as he takes on a new lifestyle with each of his
wishes.
Wishes, let me say, are handled a little differently here than one would
traditionally expect. To me, one wish would be for one thing - money or
fame or power, whatever. In "Bedazzled," wishes are actually packages. One
wish, by Elliot, is for marriage, money and power. Another is to be
brilliant, articulate, sophisticated and charming. It's not such a bad deal
if you ever get your own seven wishes. Elliot, though, has to deal with the
Devil's interpretation of what a wish actually means and suffers the
consequences of her mischief.
I can forgive the Hollywoodization of the wish thing, mainly because it
gives Fraser the chance to play a variety of different roles, putting a
unique spin on each. Best of all is when Elliot gets his first wish and
unknowingly ends up as a Colombian drug lord - this sequence provides the
film's best belly laugh as our hero realizes that he can speak Spanish
fluently. As each wish goes awry, Elliot experiences different lives in his
quest for Alison, who is the focus of all his wishes. He asks to be the
most emotionally sensitive guy in the world, but puts Alison off with his
constant crying at the beauty of the sunset. He asks to be a famous
basketball star, but is disappointed when his "equipment" is lacking. When
he wishes to be smart, the Devil puts a twist on the request and makes him
gay, too. With each failed wish, Elliot becomes more and more desperate and
gets arrested at a church when he demands to talk to God.
Rife within this amusing little tale is a bunch of practical messages that
eventually have an impact on Elliot. Morals like: be careful of what you
wish for, you might just get it; and, you can't get what you want out of
life just by wishing, are peppered through the film. The biggest impact on
Elliot, though, comes from a chance meeting with an enigmatic guy in jail
who tells Elliot that he can't sell his soul because it is not his to sell.
His soul, the stranger tells him, belongs to God. His advice is to "open
your heart and open your mind. You'll get it." These few words of wisdom
give Elliot the impetus to confront the Devil and, in the end, redeem
himself. Elliot changes from the overbearing, insecure doofus from the
beginning to become a wiser, selfless individual in the end.
Elizabeth Hurley has a damn (pun intended) good time as the Prince, let's
make that Princess, of Darkness who sees her role as a perpetual thorn in
God's side. She takes enormous pleasure as she screws up Elliot's wishes
for her own amusement. She also gets to change from one devilishly sexy
costume to another, drive a Lamborghini Diablo and corrupt a classroom full
of pubescent boys. Hurley doesn't do a lot of thesping here, but enjoys
herself nonetheless. Frances O'Connor, as the love interest and object of
Elliot's desire doesn't get much of a chance to stretch as she has to play
opposite Fraser's broadly comedic perf.
Techs, as expected in a Harold Ramis film, are first rate. Academy Award
winning production designer Rick Heinrichs ("Sleepy Hollow") provides
varied and imaginative sets, including a vision of Hell as designed by our
she Devil in her nightclub, DV8. We get two glimpses, over the course of
the film, into this demonic world. The first time we enter, things appear
pretty benign, but, as Elliot comes more and more under the Devil's
influence, our next journey into the Miltonesque Underworld takes on a
bizarre, satanic tone.
The camera work, provided by veteran lenser Bill Pope, perfectly suits the
action. Special visual F/X are ably handled by four-time Oscar winner
Richard Edlund - one sequence, near the end, has Elliot thrust down into
the fiery inferno of Hell and confronted by a giant version of the Devil.
The F/X are matter-of-fact and don't draw the viewer's attention away from
the comedy and action, even when a 7'6" Elliot comes onto the scene. Notice
