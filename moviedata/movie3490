If you are not a literature person, skip this film.  And if you don't care
about what freedom meant at the time when prohibition went beyond your doors
to tell you everything from behavior, to belief, then skip this film.
This film is about the anarchy of mind and body, which releases all tensions
and ideas, into an area of free thinking, and creative mind/body exercises
which in this case, became what today is considered literature.  Anais Nin
does not have her name in history of literature, as well placed as Henry
Miller's does, but her ability to chronicle the life of those around her,
and describe her own personal experiences, sexual, sensual, or otherwise,
set her apart, as a writer who could easily rival the seasoned material of
someone like LAWRENCE DURRELL ( the ALEXANDRIA QUARTET ) and D. L. LAWRENCE,
whose work we have read in school.  And more than likely, her position is
not established because she is a woman, in a world of publishers and artists
that was, and still is, ruled by men whose intent still may be questioned.
This is not a film about Henry Miller, June and Anais.  This is a film which
spends its time lovingly exploring that which becomes the writer's muse, and
as such, it is an excellent, and truly beautiful piece of work.
Henry Miller was depressed with the state of the affairs of art and
literature in New York, in the twenties and thirties, and decided to move to
Paris, to join a group of many writers and artists, and near the hot
cultural center which produced some of the most important and influential
artists of this century.  It was the SURREALISTS under the manifesto
published by Andre Bresson, who decided that art should be free of all
constraints, which gave us the likes of Salvador Dali, Luis Bunuel, Jean
Cocteau, and later the  generation of Jean Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, Jean
Genet, Samuel Beckett,
and too many others to mention.  And it was in the many sidewalk cafes and
the many nights of sharing ideas, and visions, where many met, and entwined
their life's work into a sweet mesh of creativity, which still burns
brightly today.
In Paris, Henry Miller met Anais Nin, a happily married society woman, who
had a penchant for diary writings.  Henry enticed her to create a bit of
erotic literature.  Their affairs became one of true erotic adventures,
which added a different dimension to Anais' life and marriage, while also
helping Henry forget the ghosts of a failed marriage, and a failed writer,
which he considered himself to be until the fifties, when his writings begun
to be noticed full scale.
Phillip Kaufman's film of this period, and its development on two literary
persons, really expresses the best and the worst of the scene.  The best was
the excitement of the affairs, and the resulting little short story, or set
of lines in the diary.   The worst was that there wasn't a place where these
things could be published.  The happy medium was that it could be read out
loud and enjoyed in a sidewalk cafe, and not be torn down to shreds by a
literary critic, before it was helped by another writer.
Personally, I have never been a great fan of Henry Miller.  But he is a very
clever, and well thought out writer, who happens to know what he is writing
about.  In other words he is not lost in his ideas, and his works are not a
set of organized ideas and thoughts.  His works are the lives of many, and
their anatomical ways in every sense.   Anais Nin, I have just recently
read, and while it is nice, it has not aged well.  Victorian Literature, and
its indecent companion pornographic genre, had tested the erotic space, but
had not affected anything new.  Anais Nin did, by interjecting the erotic
feeling of thought behind the actual happening in a descriptive mode which
has a sleepy side to it, if not a dreamy sensuality to it.  Next to much
unpolished garbage in film, television and literature today, it is excellent
stuff.  By itself, it pales a little, and has a sort of eighteen year old
diary feel to it.  The film does too.  Compared to the blatantly distasteful
stuff one sees in Madonna these days, Anais Nin is fabulous, in that the
women and men in her works are not toys, they have feelings, and they live
those feelings, from Henry, to June, to any lover that Anais spends her time
with.  Madonna's expressions are that of a lack of appreciation for a good
person, and a desire to hurt, or protect the hurt person, who no longer
looks for redemption on self, but by preying on others weaknesses.
THIS IS A MAGNIFICENT FILM.
THERE AREN'T VERY MANY FILMS THAT DEPICT THE HIGHS AND LOWS OF A CREATIVE
ARTIST, AND HOW THEY FUNCTION.

     This is the movie that forced the MPAA to create a new rating.
Maybe I'm just getting old, but I can't figure out *why*!  There is a
fair amount nudity in the movie, but the sex scenes are generally not
all that erotic.
     HENRY & JUNE is supposed to be the true story of Anais Nin & Henry
Miller, both famous writers.  The "June" in the title is Miller's wife,
June, a woman whose very picture alters the lives of characters in this
movie.  Perhaps it's the sort of movie that if you're a fan of either
writer, it works on the level of providing lots of background.  Since
I'm not, I didn't like the movie as much as I expected to.
     It really doesn't have much of a plot.  The movie follows Anais &
her husband Hugo, sort of '30s French yuppies, as they drift from place
to place and discuss that Anais will probably have an affair with an
older man.  Enter Henry Miller.  The relationships between Anais, Hugo,
and Henry are quite complicated.  Anais wants Henry, both as a fellow
writer and as a person who clearly enjoys sexual experimentation.  Henry
wants sex wherever he can get it, but he's very cautious around Anais.
Hugo pretty much ignores the situation, though it's clear he knows more
about it than Anais thinks he does.
     The performances are okay, but not much to write home about.  The
actress portraying Anais Nin is particularly good (a new, young Spanish
actress, playing Anais with a wonderful French accent).  The French
accents clash with the strong Brooklynese of both Fred Ward (playing
Henry Miller) and Uma Thurman (playing June).  With the exception of
Anais, the characters were in desperate need of charisma transplants to
pull this film off.  Kaufman has cast his movies very successfully in the
past, and I'm not sure why he didn't succeed this time (though Alec
Baldwin was originally supposed to have played Miller).
     The photography in this movie is lovely.  The point of view in this
movie wanders---many scenes are shot in mirrors, so it's a little
disconcerting at times.  The distinctions between dreams and reality are
not very well defined, which made reality a little difficult to follow.
The dialogue is fine, but the plot is *very* slow-going, and would have
benefited by a little tightening.  There are some good scenes, and
whenever June confronts someone, you know she often speaks the truth.
There are also a few lovely observations during the course of the movie
about sex and desire, and these observations are often quite subtle.
     On the whole, I can only give this movie a 6 on the Chuck scale.
The movie promises a lot but fails to deliver.  If you want to see a
truly erotic movie, go back and rent THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING.
Kaufman did it right that time....
     While I don't think there are particular spoilers in this movie, I
suppose I ought to warn you just in case...
     Perhaps the main reasons for the new rating relate more to the
treatment of morality in the movie.  There is quite a bit of nudity in
the movie, both in a long parade of under-costumed art students, and in
several scenes in a brothel.  When Hugo tells Anais he'll do anything
sexual for her, she takes him to a brothel and they watch female
prostitutes perform sexually for each other.  When the prostitutes ask
them to join in, they decline.  While the lesbian aspect of the film has
been discussed quite a bit, the most explicit material is in the
afore-mentioned scene in the brothel.  And it really wasn't all that
erotic---the scene in LIGHTNESS when one woman photographs the other
was much more charged.
     While Anais spends most of the movie lusting after June, it's clear
nothing ever would have worked out between them.  Anais is a cultured
European, and June is a Brooklyn taxi dancer.  Anais is generally very
controlled, and June is just explosive.  June is portrayed as an
unbelievably manipulative bitch in this movie.  Henry is a somewhat
softer version of June, but he has the ability to be an artist,
something that June, even though she supports him, just doesn't
understand.

[Moderator's note:  This arrived in French.  With Mark's help, I determined
that this is in fact a review.  However, neither of us are up to translating
this, so in French it runs.  Spelling, punctuation, and word choice are exactly
as I received them.]
     Voila le dernier film de Philip Kaufman: Henry et June, ou
l'histoire de la liaison litero-erotico-amoureuse de Henry Miller, Anais
Nin et June Miller a Paris vers 1932.
     Philip Kaufman semble se passioner pour les histoires
erotico-intellectuelles europeenes.  Apres "l'insoutenable legerete de
l'etre", le voici qui nous delivre "Henri et June".  D'abord une
observation: il aime donner aux petites brunes qu'on va decouvrir sous
toutes les coutures durant le film un fort accent francais, au point de
la lourdeur dans la version anglaise.  
    Tout cela pour dire que ce film est lourd.  Mais tres lourd.  Bien
que les prises de vue soient techniquement de bonne qualite, et le fil
du scenario (adapte des memoires d'Anais Nin) bien structure', les
dialogues, surtout ceux amoureux, sont d'une platitude a faire peur.  Ca
m'a rappele Emanuelle; un des films les plus niais que j'ai vu.  Pour
sur, c'est pas du Chanderlos de Laclos ni du Maupassant.
     La volonte du realisateur a faire apparaitre Henri Miller comme un
artiste "en recherche", lui attribue en fait le comportement d'un porc
au travers du film; en fait, il parle comme un porc, bouffe comme un
porc, baise comme un porc, et se conduit comme un porc.  C'est lourd et
traine dans le cliche boueux.
     Mais, finalement, le point le plus remarquable dans ce film est
cette mysterieuse image du Paris et de la France populaire des annees 30
qui nous est revelee.  Le pot-au-feu dans la cuisine, le soufflet au
fromage, la madeleine de Proust, les reveillons populo, les gentils
pick-pockets, des putes et des bordels, les flics a velo (ils ont eu
l'outrage de remplacer leur kepi par une casquette !!), il manque
presque les poules dans la cuisine, et le tableau serait complet.
     Ahlala, l'inconscient americain nous offre la description du lieu
de perdition ou` les intellectuels americains allaient se perdre dans le
vice au moment de la prohibition en Amerique.  Quel pandemonium !!  Ca
copule meme dans les rues pendant le bizutage des beaux-arts!  Philip
Kaufman ne devrait pas se laisser aller ainsi dans la carte postale.

Director: Philip Kaufman
Writers: Philip and Rose Kaufman (based on the diaries of Anais Nin)
Starring: Maria de Medeiros, Fred Ward, Uma Thurman, Richard E. Grant,
Kevin Spacey
I've never read the literature of either Henry Miller or Anais Nin, but
after watching this film, I wouldn't mind it.  Judging from this film,
their works seem like they'd be highly sexual, and very liberating.  As
a film, it is both of these, and incredibly hypnotic and unbelievably
surreal.  Yes, it has its flaws, but its direction makes up for all of
that.
Starting off with the hypnotic and affecting beginning to Stravinsky's
"Rite of the Spring," we get to see the world from the eyes of neither
Henry or June, but rather someone who knew them both intimately, writer
Anais Nin (as in "The Diary of..."), who is played by the round-faced
Maria de Medeiros (who would go on to play Fabienne in "Pulp Fiction"). 
In the beginning, she discusses her discovery of sex thorugh literature
and pictures, then is kissed by her therapist.  Thus begins a
surreal-as-hell film that is not only highly sexually arousing and
liberating, but also the first film to ever be rated NC-17.
Anias (pronounced An-ay-iss) lives in France with her banker husband,
Hugo (Richard E. Grant, equipped with a fake American accent, which
makes him sound robotic and like he's been dubbed as if he's in some
porn movie), who is kind of boring (I think "exciting banker" is an
oxymoron), but nevertheless loves his wife, and is working his butt off
so she can write.  One day, he brings home two writers to see Anais,
since she's written an essay in defense of D.H. Lawrence (one of the
first writers to write about sex): -- (a younger Kevin Spacey), a
bizarre kinda guy who's very horny, and is constantly bitching about his
ideas and works being ripped off by others; and Henry Miller (Fred
Ward), who was one of the primary writers of the 20th century, famous
for his book "Tropic of Cancer," which he writes during the tenure of
the film.
Anais is fascinated by Henry (who pronounces her name "An-iss"
throughout the film), and soon begins hanging out with him.  Henry is
incredibly promiscuous, viewing sex as a part of life, so who cares who
he sleeps with?  He's obsessed with a woman who just happens to be his
wife - June (a young Uma Thurman) - who's picture, which in front of his
desk, features her doing a kind of Malcolm MacDowell "Clockwork Orange"
look which sends shivers down anyone's spine, and is one of the most
arousing things I've seen (no, she's not naked in it).
Anais, who's sex life is near boring (Hugo occasioanally works up the
strength to boink her), starts a free relationship with Henry, who
sexually liberates her, and she also finds herself attracted totally to
June, all the while being attracted to Henry also.  She often compares
herself to both of them at different times, but seems to be the enzyme
to fuel their anger towards eachother.  Thus begins a melodramatic
little subplot between the three of them (who never end up in a menage a
trois, sorry guys).
The story, which was based on Anais Nin's diaries, is true, but is told
in one hell of a surrealistic fashion.  Characters wander in an out of
the storyline, sometimes showing up for no real reason (example: Kevin
Spacey, who shows up to complain here and there, but doesn't have any
real necessity to the plot).  And Anais's relationship with her husband
is never really explained in full.  He starts off boring, then catches
up with her, then disappears till the final scene.
There are scenes which are so bizarre that they're creepy (examples: a
dream sequence where Anais dreams of having sex with June, but then
feels her, um, penis; and a trip to a brothel where Anais and Hugo pay
to watch two girls do it, which is shot through a mirror).  And there
are several truly disturbing shots, as well as a lot of sex.  And not
just sex, but there's a lot of sex talk and eroticism throughout the
film.
The direction is the best part of the film.  Phillip Kauffman (who also
directed "The Unbearable Lightness of Being") makes every scene filled
with the perfect amount of atmosphere needed, and makes the sex in the
film actually erotic.  The cinematography is gorgeously done (it was
nominated for an Oscar), and the film maintains that surrealistic
approach throughout.  It's one of the most truly hypnotic films I've
ever seen.
The acting is not great, but is nevertheless very good.  Maria de
Medeiros does a fantastic job creating the complex Anais, showing that
kind of frailty that makes her likable and interesting.  Uma Thurman has
a very small part (although quite major to the story and characters),
but creates one of the truly sexy characters I've ever seen.  And she's
never even naked in the film (although I saw the side of one of her
breasts).  Her look, her voice (which is deep and with a Brooklyn
accent), and her just overall grace is one of the most erotic things
I've ever seen.  Kevin Spacey, although having a very small part, is
quite the little scene stealer, making his bizarre part comical and
welcome whenever he shows up and for whatever reason.
Fred Ward, however, steals the film with his flamboyant performance as
Henry.  He grunts most of his words, kind of like a brute, but possesses
a lot of depth in his performance, nailing a lot of the complexity that
is Henry Miller.  I read that Alex Baldwin was supposed to play Henry. 
Well, Alec's a good actor and all, but he's not right for this role. 
Ward is wonderful in the role, and it sure seems like it was his only
truly great role.  So far.
So, anyway, does this film deserve the NC-17 rating, or was it just a
bit of promtion to get people to actually see a lavishly produced piece
of arty porn?  Well, yes, it's damn near porn, but no, it's not
excessive like porn - more like tasteful and actually erotic porn. 
Whether or not it good have slipped in at an R rating is questionable
though.  I mean, it's telling the story of Henry Miller, for Christ's
sake.  Anyone who knows anything about "Tropic of Cancer" has to know
that it's a book about sexual liberation.  There's not a ton of sex in
it, and when it is, it's not excessive (although there's a couple lesbo
scenes), but just for what it's presenting...well, I guess it needed an
NC-17 rating.  Yes, content wise, it couldn't have, but it just seems
right that way.
Yes, it has its problems, like any film that dares to talk about sex in
such a frank manner, but it's a truly hypnotic film which resonates
eroticism, which is what it was trying to do.  So while it didn't do a
lot for the NC-17 rating and commerciability thereof, it certainly
achieves what the actual film was trying to do.  Well, in my book, it
did.

OVERVIEW:
     A look at the relationship, erotic and literary, between Anais Nin,
Henry Miller, and their respective spouses Hugo and June.
REVIEW:
     I'm sure by now we're all familiar with the hype surrounding the
recent release of HENRY AND JUNE, the first film to receive the MPAA's
newly minted NC-17 rating (which Tom Shales of NPR tells us stands for
"Not in Cincinnati, or a 17 mile radius thereof").  It's been banned in
some cities, and been called "an erotic masterpiece" in others.  So
what's the film like?
     Well, first and foremost to my eye, it's a Philip Kaufman film
(director of THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING).  Every scene positively
drips atmosphere.  Everyone smokes, some gracefully.  Kaufman has
populated Nin's Paris with a remarkable collection of hookers, thiefs,
and (bizarrely) wandering street magicians, who stiffen and relax ropes,
make stolen wallets become doves, and other strange things that really
have no bearing on anything, as far as I can tell.  There are romantic
fogs, poetic rainstorms, and dramatic thunder-and-lightning scenes.
Kaufman's feel runs through the entire film; his thumbprint is on every
scene.
     Second, of course, it's about Nin and Miller, two writers of erotic
literature, and players in the erotic lifestyle.
     In the first instance, as an atmosphere film, it succeeds.  The
film lays it on a bit thick for my tastes, and the elements of drama
lurch a little too much into the arena of melodrama, I think.  But the
atmosphere is maintained, and the film is beautiful to look at.
     And as a display of acting talents, it's excellent.  Fred Ward
certainly makes the most of his role, as does Maria de Madeiros.  Uma
Thurman made me actively dislike her and feel uncomfortable when she was
on screen, quite a contrast to my reactions to her previous roles in
BARON MUNCHAUSEN and DANGEROUS LIAISONS.  The only character who seems
weak is Hugo, and it is difficult to say whether this is the fault of a
very weak character, or poor acting, although I am inclined to think it
is the former.  Certainly as his is played, Hugo is a boring, obtuse
nerd of a man, not what I would call a plum role.
     Finally we come to the story.  As a story, this film is somewhat
uneven.  This is not what you would call a classic conflict/resolution
drama; it is more the story of Anais Nin's coming of age, and Henry
Miller (and his wife June) was the catalyst for that coming of age.
While I found her story interesting, it was certainly less than
fascinating for me, and I left the theatre feeling somewhat unfulfilled.
How did this relationship change her life?  How did it change Henry
Miller's life?  What happened to the two marriages?  The film remains
mute on these subjects, and left me somewhat frustrated.
     As for the erotic elements, they have been overadvertised as far as
I can see.  There are certainly a lot of breasts and buttocks shown on
the screen, and a number of fairly graphic (but certainly far from
hardcore) lovemaking scenes, but none of them really struck me as
erotic.  Most of the sex in this film struck me as more animalistic and
desperate than erotic.  Unless you find raw rut erotic, you probably
won't find this film very erotic.  There are those that might argue that
what we saw wasn't "raw rut," but it certainly looked that way to me.
     Overall, an interesting film that was worth seeing.  I think you
absolutely have to suspend your disbelief, and if you can, you will
enjoy this movie.  If you can't, the atmosphere and melodrama might get
in your way.  Certainly not an erotic masterpiece, but also far from
being a dog.  I give it a 6.

     This is the first NC17 movie, a fact which will no doubt put you in
good stead in some future trivia game.  The movie is considered too much
for kids, but too good not to be rated and given entree to the world's
multiplexes.
     The most "unconventional" thing about HENRY & JUNE is the lavish
scenes of sex between women.  As a gay man, I have to say that I grew a
trifle restive at so much of it, even if the photography was uniformly
excellent and the actors attractive and interesting people.  All I'm
saying is that the sex, the eroticism is not, for me, the reason to see
HENRY & JUNE.
     Acting, script, character development -- these are the reasons to
see HENRY & JUNE.  The three principals -- Fred Ward as Henry Miller,
Uma Thurman (DANGEROUS LIAISONS) as his wife June, and Maria de Madeiros
as Anais Nin -- give magnificently complex performances.  Of the three,
Madeiros is the most attractive, but Thurman is the most interesting.
June is in many ways the focus of the film since both Miller and Nin not
only sleep with her (as well as each other) but write books about her.
     Nin is the narrative focus of the film, which is about, inter alia,
her relationships with the title characters; she is in every scene; she
is the narrator; it is through her eyes and her diaries that we see the
world.  And Madeiros is wonderfully right.  She looks like Nin, small,
strong, huge-eyed, unblinking, all-seeing, very private, very open.
     Fred Ward's Miller is less successful only by comparison.  Miller
is portrayed very much as a traditional man, blind to who the women in
his life were except insofar as they were extensions of himself.  As a
man, he is limited in what he can see, feel, or think.  These things, I
think, are how Nin sees him, regardless of how he was.
     But always I come back to Thurman's June: whore, muse, patrona,
con-woman, strong, intensely afraid of death.  Obsessed with finding a
great writer who could portray her as she felt she was; always
disappointed, angry, loving, ungrateful, impossible, manipulating,
independent, clinging.  It is as complete a a portrait of a human being
as I have ever seen on film and a stunning achievement for the actor.

     Take these comments with a grain of salt.  Films about people's sex and
love lives somehow just do not appeal to me, even from excellent filmmakers
such as Woody Allen or Philip Kaufman.  I rate them much lower than other
people seem to.  Not that sex itself cannot be interesting, but even a Woody
Allen agonizing over why he cannot bed Diane Keaton is for me the formula
for a total yawner.  Philip Kaufman's last film, THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF
BEING, while much in this genre, did have enough substance besides the
sexual maneuvering that it held my interest.  His current HENRY AND JUNE is
a long film, but not nearly as long as it seems.  In spite of the title, the
film is mostly about Anais Nin and her early 1930s affair with Henry Miller.
The film is based on the account in her memoir of the same title.  She makes
herself out to be small and in some ways strong, but in most ways she is
fragile.  She is not entirely satisfied by her banker husband Hugo and is
attracted to virile American writer Henry Miller.  Awakened by his presence,
she proceeds in her frail, sensitive way to have sex with everyone in reach
but the housemaid and perhaps the dog (though the dog wasn't talking).  She
also has a stimulating intellectual relationship with Miller, who is
straight-laced enough to limit his sexual partners to only the members of
the opposite sex within reach.  When one of them is not making love, he or
she is agonizing, writing books, or riding bicycles.
     Most of the story is told in Nin's voice, which is an acquired taste
like candied violets.  The camera adopts a soft focus to mirror her writing
style.  One set, apparently near the house where much of the action happens,
is a long walkway next to a wall in night and fog.  It looks very much like
an impressionist painting.  I was hoping we would see it in the daytime or
at least without fog, but we never do.  I remember no other fog in the film
and it is there apparently mostly for effect.
     Kaufman underscores that most of what we are seeing is from Nin's point
of view by having one sequence be a flashback narrated by Miller.  The soft
focus is banished and the prose changes to a hard-boiled Raymond Chandler
style.  Even in Nin's style Fred War may be trying to affect Miller's
character but it comes out like Humphrey Bogart.  Maria de Medeiros' Nin is
a dictionary illustration for "demure" and often also for "naked."  Kaufman
has created a tremendous number of nude positions for couples in which the
parts that would be most busy are out of sight, perhaps trying for an R
rating, or perhaps affecting Anais Nin's point of view.  (Of course, the
film got first an X rating and then inaugurated the NC-17 rating.)  "June"
refers, incidentally, to Miller's wife, played by Uma Thurman, who usually
is not around.
     The film is constantly melodramatic, with deep people feeling deep
emotions which we are told about cheaply and superficially.  You know you're
in trouble when characters start voicing lines like, "Does she think she can
love anything in you I haven't loved?"  Even if these are real people, these
people aren't real.  My rating: -1 on the -4 to +4 scale.  It might have
been lower but for the peculiar background created of Paris in the 1930s.
