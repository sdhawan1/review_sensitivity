Listen, I am going to admit right up front that I am not a big fan of
animation films, and wasn't a particularly over-enthused admirer of the
first part of this Pixar duo of film, but gosh darned if I wasn't bowled
over like the rest of those over and under grown kids in the theatre tonite!
PLOT:
Woody the cowboy is stolen from Andy his owner, and it is up to Buzz
Lightyear and the rest of those nutty toy friends of his to save his wooden
ass. During his abduction, Woody meets a few of his older friends from his
days as a TV star and is suddenly faced with the tough decision of remaining
with them and preserving his legacy forever, or returning to his rightful
owner, who is bound to get rid of him any year now.
CRITIQUE:
A rollickin' great lil' fun adventure for newborns, children, kids,
teenagers, young adults, parents, grandpas and grandmas alike. It doesn't
take much for one to enjoy themselves with this movie. It's got fantastic
effects, a fun story, likeable characters, an upbeat soundtrack, a decent
runtime and toys, toys and more toys. And what an adventure they get into
here. Indiana Jones could take lessons from some of these cartoon munchkins.
>From its opening scene, which is one of the cooler action animated sequences
that I have ever seen on film, to the last twenty minutes of the movie which
just rattle from one humdingin' close call after another. This film has got
everything that its original had and more, including one really cute new toy
named Jessie. Va-va-voom! What an adorably cute doll! They even toss in a
decent "touching" scene for effect. Pretty cool. Now folks, please don't get
me wrong here.
This film is not a revolution of the medium of film. I mean, honestly
speaking, the animation isn't a thousand times better than the original or
anything, but does remain quite spectacular on the big screen. But if you
happen to be reading this review a few years after the film's original
release, you may just scoff at my enthusiasm since the leaps and bounds
which continue to be made in this burgeoning industry seem to leave much of
their own ancestry flying in the wind. Buuuuut, at this point in time, I can
honestly say that this film was a positively enjoyable treat. In fact, the
first film seems more like a "set-up" for this one, a sketchpad used to
clarify the actual creation of this complete animated "movie". In fact, most
of this film takes place on the "outside" of the room in which the human
being characters have become eerily lifelike. I can't wait until they start
creating computer-generated pictures starring human characters in
extraordinary situations...wow, things are really gonna be nuts! All in all,
kudos to everyone associated with this exciting new-age cartoon adventure
sure to satisfy all lighthearted people looking for a good time.
Of course, the biggest handshake should be reserved for the genius who
actually thought to come up with an idea for a cartoon film based on the
actual merchandise of the film (i.e. the toys)!! Wow, now what kind of
merchandising exposure do you think we could get with this one, boss?!?
Yikes, laughing all the way to the toy bank, eh fellas?
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Various references to other films pepper this flick with at least three
blatant homages including the one right off the top playing the theme to
2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. There is also a pretty cool photocopied shot of the
dinosaur running after a jeep, as seen through the side-view mirror, a la
JURASSIC PARK and one of the funniest moments of the film for me, which was
a beautiful tip of the hat to the STAR WARS trilogy, involved Buzz' final
confrontation with Zurg. I won't say any more.
A couple of new celebrity voices have joined the fray in this film including
the always adorable Joan Cusack as the ever adorable Jessie and Kelsey
Grammer as Stinky Pete the Prospector. And let's not forget Newman! That's
Wayne Knight as the voice of Al McWhiggin, the evil antique toy collector.
Brrrrrr.
Director John Lasseter was also the man behind Pixar's first original
computer generated film called LUXO JR. in 1986. That film involved a
smaller, younger lamp bouncing around after a ball, while the older lamp
looked after it. That short "lamp" film was obviously very special to the
people at Pixar, since they've made it part of their visual logo before each
of their films. In 1996, Lasseter received a Special Achievement Award at
the Academy Awards, for the development and inspired application of
techniques that have made possible the first feature-length
computer-animated film. He also directed TOY STORY and A BUG'S LIFE.

TOY STORY 2 (G).  
(Disney/Pixar/Buena Vista International
Director: John Lasseter
Stars: voices of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Kelsey Grammar,
Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Wayne
Knight, Annie Potts, Jonathan Harris, John Morris, Laurie Metcalf,
Estelle Harris, R Lee Ermey, Jodi Benson, Joe Ranft, Andrew Stanton,
Jeff Pidgeon
Running time: 92 minutes.
The Phantom Menace may have been the most eagerly anticipated,
and most over-hyped, sequel of the year, but Toy Story 2 is
undoubtedly the best!  This wonderfully entertaining animated tale
from the Disney and Pixar studios is a rarity amongst sequels in that
it is every bit as good as the original.  Director John Lasseter (Toy
Story, A Bug's Life, etc) knows how to entertain audiences, and Toy
Story 2 is fast, funny, endlessly inventive, and won't disappoint.
Toy Story 2 again explores themes of friendship, innocence,
and also further develops the premise that the primary role of toys is
to bring happiness to children, even though their owners will
eventually outgrow them and move on to other interests.  Since the
original movie four years ago, the technology has evolved even
further, and the state of the art computer generated animation here is
superb.  This is especially evident with its almost lifelike depiction
of some of the human characters.  Whereas the original Toy Story
mainly explored what went on in children's bedrooms when no-one was
around, this clever sequel takes the characters in new directions,
while still maintaining its freshness and originality.  Woody, Buzz
Lightyear and the rest of the familiar toys return, as do the talented
voice cast.  Not having to waste time introducing audiences to these
familiar characters, Toy Story 2 leaps straight into the action.
While his young master Andy is away at camp, Woody (Tom Hanks,
reprising his role) accidentally ends up in a garage sale.  He is
kidnapped by Al (voiced by Wayne Knight), a greedy toy retailer, who
recognises the intrinsic value of a Woody doll in good condition.  Al
has all the other collectible toy figures dating from the '50's, when
Woody was the star of a popular kids' show on television.  They are
now rare collectors' items, and Al stands to make big money for
selling a complete set to a Japanese toy museum.
In Al's office Woody meets his former co-stars, including the
tomboyish cowgirl Jessie (voiced by Joan Cusack), his horse Bullseye,
and the prickly prospector (voiced by Frasier's Kelsey Grammer), who
are looking forward to becoming part of a permanent collection after
years of neglect in storage.  Woody faces a dilemma when he is torn
between loyalty to his old friends and his master Andy and the
concerns of his two new friends.
Meanwhile, Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen again) leads some of his
fellow toys on a daring mission into the dangerous outside world in an
attempt to rescue Woody before Andy returns from camp.  In a toy store
he encounters a new and improved, but hopelessly naive, version of
himself, which brings another dimension to the action.
The writing is again very clever, and takes a number of well
aimed shots at the crass commercialism and cynical exploitation
practised by the toy manufacturers.  The script is peppered with
plenty of clever in-jokes.  While younger children will enjoy the
antics of the toys and the sense of adventure, the broad humour and
universal themes will appeal to audiences of all ages.  Unlike many
sequels, Toy Story 2 actually leaves audiences wanting more!

     Previously destined for a straight-to-video release, the TOYS are
back in the long-awaited sequel to 1995's massively successful TOY
STORY.
     Thank God!  Almost as good as the original, TOY STORY 2 is an
unabashed crowd-pleaser to children and adults.  With enough
(non-offensive) adult humor and plenty of good-natured kid stuff, this
film had our tiny audience in stitches from start to finish.
     TOY STORY 2 picks up right where the original left off.  With Andy
(Morris) off to `Cowboy Camp,' Mom (Metcalf) decides to throw a yard
sale, and Woody ends up being stolen by the evil toy magnate Al
(Knight), owner of Al's Toy Barn.  Turns out Woody (Hanks) is a relic
from a 1950's TV show, and he completes an extremely valuable collection
which is set to be shipped off to a museum in Japan.
     Held prisoner, Woody runs into the rest of the cast of `Woody's
Roundup'--his horse Bullseye, prospector Stinky Pete (Grammer), and
spunky cowgirl Jessie (Cusack).  Turns out they're okay with the Japan
trip, and soon, Woody starts to like the idea of moving overseas to be
idolized forever.  But it's Buzz Lightyear (Allen), to the rescue!  With
the aid of the usual gang of followers from the original, a massive
mission to save Woody is launched.
     A huge chunk of TOY STORY 2's humor is derived from clever
referential jokes to the original, so be sure you've seen it first.
Also, the story is tons of fun, but--and believe me, I feel weird about
typing these words--it also lacks the depth of the first film.  As
messages go, the original TOY STORY's themes of blind acceptance were
more powerful.
     Still, Hanks and Allen are incredibly fun, but it's Cusack's Jessie
that steals the show with as the over-the-top cowgirl.  Overall, TOY
STORY 2 is simply a whole lot of good, clean fun.  And there ain't
nothing wrong with that.

A copy of thsi review can be found at 
http://www.moviereviews.org/toy_story_2.htm
Toy Story 2 is the perfect film to carry the Disney torch into the next 
century. Good old Walt's studio became synonymous with heartwarming and 
purely innocent children's fare during the last 75 years. Branches from 
the Mouse House like Touchstone and Miramax adapted to adult genres as 
well, making stirring and suspenseful dramas. This product of the Magic 
Kingdom isn't too lowbrow for adults nor highbrow for children; Toy 
Story 2 is the perfect family film and the happiest of all compromises.
"Back in 1995, retailers did not order enough toys to meet demand." Tour 
Guide Barbie speaks a truth that almost all of us remember vividly. 
(That was after Power Rangers and before Tickle Me Elmo.) It is no 
coincidence that this movie is opening twenty four hours before the 
year's biggest retail shopping day.
The original tale of the toys was a phenomenon. So was the original 
Austin Powers. Remember what happened when that sequel rolled around a 
few months back? It made more money in its first weekend than the first 
Austin Powers did in its entire theatrical run. And with Pokemon quickly 
fading after a huge opening, Toy Story 2 can expect enormous box office 
numbers, enhanced by retailers' ability to learn from their previous 
mistakes.
Woody (voice of Tom Hanks), Buzz (voice of Tim Allen) and the rest of 
the gang are all back for their next great adventure. This time around, 
the villain isn't the little boy next store, it is the big man with the 
toy store. Al (voice of Wayne Knight) spots Woody at a yard sale and 
realizes that our former hero is the missing piece to a very valuable 
collection. Soon Woody is abducted and living with the rest of the 
Roundup Gang, a series of dolls from an old television show that was 
canceled after its first week. Our new hero, Buzz Lightyear, jumps to 
the rescue explaining "Woody once risked his life for me. I couldn't 
call myself a friend if I weren't willing to do the same." He is joined 
by Mr. Potato Head (voice of Don Rickles), Slinky Dog (voice of Jim 
Varney, Rex the dinosaur (voice of Wallace Shawn) and Hamm the piggy 
bank (voice of John Ratzenberger). Their mission entails a venture 
across town and should they make an error the consequences are obvious: 
"ham sandwich with fries and a hot dog" plus a couple of toys for the 
not-so-happy meal.
Pixar, the animation company behind this feat, starts the movie with a 
short film. In the immediate wake of Pikachu's Vacation, a rather 
unfortunate opening piece from Pokemon: The First Movie (of course, 
everything in that movie is rather unfortunate), comparisons must be 
drawn. Toy Story 2's opening is a cute and very short sequence involving 
two lamps and two balls. It is introduced at Pixar's first film from 
1986 (most kids in the audience will likely group that year and the 
stone age next to each other). Pikachu's Vacation is an original piece 
that drags on for some 20 minutes and is absolutely indecipherable. 
Needless to say that quantity isn't quality.
Toy Story 2 also thrives off of sheer eye candy. The animation is so 
real that you often wonder if it really is animation or some sort of 
Roger Rabbit-like combination of cartoons and people. This is best 
highlighted by the ending sequence which takes place at (Caution: 
SPOILER ahead) an airport and a mid-feature scene with a major highway.
The gang is back and better than ever, there is no question about it. 
Buzz Lightyear says it best, this film is headed "to infinity and 
beyond!"

Magnificent, super fantastic, rich, wonderful, full,
stop-what-your-doing-and-go-see-it appeal.
Where can I start? Voices? Terrific. How about visuals and art direction?
Superb. Action? Comedy? Fun? Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay, then screenplay and story
line? Better than the original "Toy Story." A mere ounce of this carefully
refined script could fuel a rocketship to infinity and beyond!
What are you doing this weekend? Don't worry about that new opera in town,
take a pass on the blues band at the local bar, blow off the Sunday night
game, duck out of your best buddy's big bash -- go see this film. Kids or no
kids, date or no date, heck -- go alone!
Oh, so you didn't see "Toy Story" (a mishap easily corrected). Relax, take
the week to rent it. Go see "Toy Story 2" next week or the one following --
don't worry, it won't be blasting off the screen anytime too soon. This is a
sequel after all, although it could still be enjoyed as a stand alone,
knowledge of the pre-story can only make this excellent production that much
more endearing.
And what a production it is! When 100% of the visual imagery is computer
generated, the director has millisecond control over ever edit, every cut,
every action sequence -- director John Lasseter takes full advantage. A
stream of star-burst colors blend animated characters with a kaleidoscopic
of voices, rock solid scripting and pinpoint direction. It's fun, uproarious
and plainly a great treat you shouldn't deny yourself. Forget the kids, take
two hours and go see it!

So how do toys cross the road?  I'm not saying, but the mayhem that they
cause when crossing in TOY STORY 2 is likely to send your audience into
a laughing pandemonium as it did ours.
The boys are back in town in TOY STORY 2, and so are the girls.
Especially good are Joan Cusack in a new starring role as the tough, but
melancholic, Jessie the Cowgirl and Jodi Benson (Ariel from THE LITTLE
MERMAID) in a new featured part as Barbie.  Part of the charm of the
sequel is that we already know and love the characters.  The additional
casting just adds icing to an already scrumptious cake.
The story opens in outer space as Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) battles his
new nemesis, Emperor Zurg (Ken Michroney).  The whole point of the
opening seems to be to let the crew at Pixar Animation Studios dazzle us
with their technical prowess.  If that was indeed their goal, they
succeeded handsomely.  The visual and sound effects are incredible.
Look out George Lucas, a bunch of toys are after your space franchise.
This elaborate opening diversion, which the plot manages to make fit
into the context of a simple story about Andy (John Morris) and his
toys, soon gives way to more familiar surroundings.  Pixar uses its ever
increasing technological sophistication to enhance the settings this
time but without changing them.  The toys perform marvelous feats, as
when the Etch-a-Sketch shows off his ability to morph into a kid's
version of a photocopier.
The story, which doesn't quite measure up to the original in the number
of memorable lines, does excel in the quality of the physical comedy
with the aforementioned road crossing being its pičce de résistance.
The screenplay isn't afraid to introduce drama, sadness and moral
dilemmas into a G-rated comedy for all ages.
Woody (Tom Hanks) is "shelved" when his arm gets partially pulled off.
"I'm sorry, honey, but you know toys don't last forever," Andy's mother
(Laurie Metcalf) tells him.  It's a sad fact of life in the toy kingdom
that all of them are subject to be taken to the dreaded yard sale.  It
is at such a sale, where Woody has gone on a rescue mission, that he is
stolen by an unscrupulous toy collector named Al (Wayne Knight).
Al takes Woody to his apartment, where others toys including Jessie, The
Prospector named Stinky Pete (Kelsey Grammer) and a horse named Bullseye
(David Ogden Stiers) live a miserable existence.  The claustrophobic
Jessie hates the dark box in which they are stored in order to maintain
their pristine condition.  She's a spunky cowgirl who likes the sun and
the freedom it represents.
Woody turns out to be their salvation, but only if he agrees to abandon
Andy and come with them instead.  This story makes this much more
touching and complicated than it might seem.
Meanwhile, the ever valiant and brave Buzz leads his rag-tag band of
warriors, including Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Slinky Dog (Jim
Varney), Rex (Wallace Shawn) and Hamm (John Ratzenberger), on a mission
to rescue Woody, their friend and leader.  Crossing almost 2 dozen
treacherous blocks, they make their way to Al's toy store.
Once inside the store, they meet the Barbies.  When Tour Guide Barbie
gets in the toy car next to Mr. Potato Head, he has to keep reminding
himself, "I'm a married spud."
Most studios would be proud to have a success every now and then, but
Pixar, with three wonderful films (TOY STORY, A BUGS LIFE and now TOY
STORY 2), is certainly batting a thousand.  Given the dearth of laudable
kids' movies, Pixar deserves a huge pat on the back by parents and
moviegoers everywhere for giving us such extremely enjoyable G-rated
entertainment.
TOY STORY 2 runs about 1:30.  It is rated G and would be fine for all
ages, including adults with no children whatsoever
At the screening I attended were almost all of my son's fifth grade
class, and I heard nothing but **** ratings from them afterwards.  My
son, Jeffrey, loved the film, mentioning how many hilarious lines there
were.  His friend Alan said he loved it because it was so funny.  His
friend Nickolas said he thought it was great and that he liked it 100%.

 Toy Story 2 (1999) 4 stars out of 4. Featuring the voices of Tom Hanks,
Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Kelsey Grammer, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, Annie
Potts, Jim Varney and John Ratzenberger.
 If you want to treat the kids and yourself to an early holiday gift, I
strongly urge you to see "Toy Story 2," a warm and wonderful sequel that
will keep you laughing from the outset.
 Some movies make you feel good from the get-go, hugging you until the
closing credits quit rolling. "Toy Story 2" is one of those movies.
 "Toy Story 2" is, on a basic level, a fable about the relationship between
toys and children - and the transient nature of that unique partnership.
 The main plot of "Toy Story 2" deals with the kidnapping of Woody by a
dishonest toy collector and his rescue by his former rival Buzz Lightyear
and a group of Andy's other toys.
 Andy has gone off to cowboy camp, but Woody - who usually goes with Andy -
had to be left behind because his arm is ripped. Trying to save one of
Andy's old, abandoned toys, Woody accidentally winds up in a yard sale from
which he is stolen.
 A witty script, filled with pop culture references to the James Bond
villain, Oddjob, "Jurassic Park" and "Star Wars," ensures that "Toy Story
2" will be just as enjoyable to adults as it is to the kids.
 The technicians at Pixar have again used computer animation to bring to
life a lively group of toys, and you soon forget how they were created.
Subconsciously, you know they are not human, but on the screen they appear
as real and you or I.
 And what a collection. Besides Woody and Buzz, returning characters
include Mr. Potato Head, Rex the dinosaur, Slinky Dog and Hamm the pig.
 The movie is filled with funny lines. As Mr. Potato Head prepares to
venture forth with his comrades in search of Woody, Mrs. Potato Head tells
him she has packed an extra pair of feet and his mean eyes.
 Of course, it's the talented voices that make these characters so
charming. Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, Don Rickles as
Mr. Potato Head, Wallace Shawn as Rex, Jim Varney as Slinky Dog and John
Ratzenberger as Hamm are joined by the heavenly Joan Cusack as Jessie the
cowgirl and Kelsey Grammer as Stinky Pete the prospector.
 You see, after being kidnapped, Woody discovers that he is a cultural
icon, a star of his own kiddie TV show back in the 1950s. He was joined on
the show by Jessie and Stinky Pete.
 With the addition of Woody, the evil toy collector now has a complete set
of Woody memorabilia and plans to sell it all to a toy museum in Tokyo.
 Woody doesn't want immortality. He wants to return to Andy, despite the
protests of Jessie - who was cruelly discarded when her own grew up - and
Stinky Pete, who is still wrapped because he was never removed from his box.
 One of the film's finest sequences occurs when Woody's would-be rescuers
invade a toy store. There, Buzz meets an updated model of himself (the new
Buzz has a utility belt), the toys are aided by a flight attendant Barbie
and Buzz comes face-to-face with his mortal enemy, the evil Emperor Zurg.
 Everything, naturally, works out for the best. But "Toy Story 2" is such a
fun ride that I cannot help but rhapsodize about it. The movie is one of
the top films of the year, a must-see, can't-miss, family excursion kind of
event.
 It can be argued that like "Bride of Frankenstein," "Godfather II,"
"Aliens" and "Terminator 2," "Toy Story 2" is a sequel that surpasses the
original.
 A wonderful, tuneful score by Randy Newman, a laugh-filled script,
out-of-this-world effects and some very talented voices and technicians
have created a world we will want to visit again and again.

  Good-bye Pokemon, hello Toy Story. The toys are back in town and more
entertaining than ever. With the addition of new characters, and a more
involving story, children and adults are sure to love this animated classic.
  In this sequel, Woody is abducted by a toy dealer named Al (Voice of Wayne
Knight) who is obsessed with the Roundup gang, and is dying to sell them to
Tokyo for a huge price. The Roundup gang includes Jessie The Cowgirl (Joan
Cusack), Stinky Pete the Prospector (Kelsey Grammer), Bullseye the horse and
Woody (Tom Hanks) himself. Now Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and a few of Andy's
other toys are out to rescue Woody. Unfortunately for Buzz and the gang, they
must face a number of dangers on the way, such as crossing the street.
  What's so good about Pixar's films are that they are so imaginative. They
take the audience into another world, and make it charming and highly
enjoyable. I've never had so much fun with animation films until Pixar came
into view. They're an absolute delight.
  Enough of my jabbering and on with the film! There are a number of reasons,
why the sequel is superior to the original. For one, we now know the
characters, so no introduction needs to be made for them, that is if you've
seen "Toy Story." It's a necessity to be comfortable with your characters, so
you know what to expect, much like James Bond or any other film that has made
sequels. There also was some incredibly hilarious homage's to Star Wars and
Jurassic Park, that will keep you smiling. Even the animation is sharper this
time around. The opening sequence is dazzling and is breathtaking to watch, as
well as many other new technical breakthroughs. It's like something out of a
dream.
  The characters are as lovable as ever. Rex (Wallace Shawn) is still my
favorite character. As you know, he attempts to be a frightening dinosaur in
the first one, but in this one he only wants to be a hero. Thankfully the
little dinosaur gets his wish. Hamm (John Ratzenberger), SlinkyDog (Jim Varney)
and the always charming Mr. Potato Head, who now has a Mrs. Potato Head are
their usual rowdy selves. Rounding out the crew are a number of new toys.
Jessie The Cowgirl, Stinky Pete and Bullseye. None of these characters really
stand out except Bullseye. Although he says nothing, his constant licking and
smiling will undoubtedly give audiences a pleasurable time.
  The only thing missing in this sequel, is Randy Newman's music. Instead we
must suffer with 2 minutes of Sarah Maclachlan trying to sing. Aside from that
minor complaint, Toy Story 2 is very refreshing. I'm glad that animated
features aren't overstuffed, and disappointing like these big budget films that
are out now. Disney is simply the best when it comes to making family fun.
  There's nothing left to say except go see it. It's about time we get a
fulfilling movie, that will dazzle our minds and give children something other
to do than talk about Pokemon. In the words of Billy Crystal "It's Absolutely
Marvelous."
  By the way, there's a trailer for the next Pixar film called Dinosaurs. This
could be the most spectacular achievement yet. Worth seeing Toy Story 2 just
for that.

The third computer generated animated film from Pixar, "Toy Story 2" can be 
regarded with ease as one of those very rare sequels that actually improves 
upon its predecessor. Watching the original, in its entirety, for the first 
time since its theatrical release in November of 1995, and then going to see 
the sequel two hours later, it is abundantly clear that "Toy Story 2" is 
richer and more awe-inspiring in the animation department, has a stronger, 
appreciatively non-preachy message to make about the act of growing up, and, 
most importantly, is at least twice as imaginative. Sure, there are a 
sampling of corny jokes (as in the first one) to satisfy the children in the 
audience, but also like the original, it is a film that has a snappy pace, 
clever writing, and is condescending to neither kids nor adult viewers. Those 
attributes are, at least, something I doubt you could find in the new 
"Pokemon" movie. 
Picking up a couple years after its precursor, this immensely entertaining 
sequel reintroduces all of the old toys that are owned by the young boy named 
Andy, most notably Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), a cowboy, and Buzz Lightyear 
(Tim Allen), a space explorer. Now all friends, the gang of toys, which also 
include Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Slinky the Dog (Jim Varney), Hamm the 
Piggy Bank (John Ratzenberger) and Rex the Dinosaur (Wallace Shawn), find 
their worst fear come true when, through a chain of unfortunate events, Woody 
is stolen at a yard sale by spiteful toy owner Al (Wayne Knight). While Buzz 
Lightyear and a select few of the other toys set out to rescue Woody, Woody 
himself discovers why Al wanted him so badly: he unknowingly used to be the 
star of a popular television show, and is the one missing character in the 
collection. Meeting and becoming quick friends with the other toys from the 
show, cowgirl and confidante Jessie (Joan Cusack), a horse named Bullseye, 
and the old paternal figure called The Prospector (Kelsey Grammer), Woody 
begins to have second thoughts about going back to Andy because he believes 
he might have finally found his rightful place in the world of toys.  
What is so utterly delightful about "Toy Story 2" is that it never once 
rehashes the original, instead consistently coming up with sensationally 
innovative new ideas and branching the story off into many enlivening 
directions. Due to this, it dodges the usual fate of becoming an unnecessary 
sequel because, for once, Walt Disney Pictures does not seem to be aiming for 
a quick buck, as they have patently directed all of their efforts into making 
an exemplary continuation of a recent beloved family film.
While the 1995 picture grew a little frustrating because of the majority of 
the action taking place in bedrooms, "Toy Story 2" is akin to the also 
superior 1993 sequel "Addams Family Values," in that it takes the characters 
into a much-needed outside setting. Opening in Andy's bedroom, then going 
into the city, through a toy store, and culminating at an airport (with pit 
stops in between), the film is a grand achievement and another step forward 
in the world of animation, appearing more sharp and detailed than even 
Pixar's last film, 1998's "A Bug's Life." Never short of being colorful and 
visually extravagant, certain shots are so very impressive that they almost 
look like live-action, while the human characters also appear slightly more 
real than their artificial representations in the original.
Staying true to the memorable toy characters he previously created, director 
John Lasseter does not try to miraculously alter the personalities of Woody, 
Buzz, or the rest of the ensemble, but simply continues their evolvement as 
regular people. By doing this, Lasseter also has introduced several fresh 
characters, including Mrs. Potato Head, The Prospector, Bullseye, Tour Guide 
Barbie, and the most effective, Jessie. Marvelously voiced by Joan Cusack, 
Jessie is one of the most well-written and realistically portrayed modern 
animated characters in some time. In an unusually touching and meaningful 
flashback for a family movie, we watch how Jessie's life has lead up to this 
moment. She used to have an owner, a loving girl who was her best friend, but 
as the years went by, the girl turned into a young woman, the places where 
her toys used to be changed into posters and make-up, Jessie stopped being 
played with, and finally, ended up being thrown away. "You never forget your 
owner," Jessie tearfully says, "but they forget you." This line is so 
powerful and stirring because it is completely true, and even if toys aren't 
actually alive in real life, its connotation remains wholeheartedly valid.
For every minor instance where something doesn't work (in a throwaway ode to 
the first "Star Wars" trilogy, Buzz Lightyear discovers his arch nemesis, 
Zurg, is actually his father), there are no less than twenty other things 
that do. The climax, for example, is ingeniously set at a busy airport, and 
stands as one of the most exciting action set-pieces this whole year. Joyous 
and lighthearted, "Toy Story 2" is ideal family entertainment, and the most 
satisfying Disney movie since 1991's "Beauty and the Beast."

Q:  I've heard that "Toy Story 2" is better than the original.  Is this 
true?
A:  "Better" is relative.  The first edition did the work of establishing 
the characters, and the score was more solid.  "2" takes risks like adding 
new characters and sending nearly the whole cast on the road to rescue 
Woody.  The sequel has more action scenes, probably because Hollywood 
believes we viewers will surely be satisfied by more action.  On the whole, 
it's a very impressive film, and I wouldn't think an Oscar nomination would 
be far-fetched.
Q:  What was your favorite part?
A:  The animation never fails to amaze me.  I think the pioneers of cartoons 
would be fascinated by this technology.  Sometimes it's like seeing an 
exhibit of photorealist paintings:  you have to keep reminding yourself 
these images have been created!  I also like all the material put in for 
Boomers.  My wife was particularly impressed by the detail given to the old 
"Woody's Roundup" show - lunchboxes and record players and novelty toys, 
everything resembling kid stuff from 40 years ago.  So hype is not new.  My 
11 year-old daughter liked Woody's sidekick Jessie, the strong-willed 
cowgirl voiced by Joan Cusack.  And both my children liked the "Star Wars" 
and "Jurassic Park" allusions.  (When Mr. Potato Head - voiced by Don 
Rickles - threw his hat, I wasn't the only one to think "Oddjob.")
Q:  So what's the plot, basically?
A:  While he's rescuing a rubber penguin named "Wheezy" from a yard sale, 
Woody (Tom Hanks) accidentally ends up in the hands of a toy collector and 
dealer.  This slimy character, Al (voiced ably by Wayne Knight), actually 
steals Woody, after Andy's mom pulls the sheriff doll from the sale.  To sum 
up, the main plot consists of the main characters Buzz Lightyear (Tim 
Allen), Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Rex (Wallace Shawn) and Rickles as the 
potato, trying to locate and retrieve Woody.  The complications include 
Woody's discovery that he's a classic doll from the Howdy Doody era, worth 
much money to a toy museum in Japan, which is willing to pay the wily Al 
generously.  His reunion with Jessie, a sister-like pal, Bullseye the loyal 
and fleet horse, and Stinky Pete the Prospector (Kelsey Grammer) is 
intriguing, especially the grainy segments of the television show featuring 
the marionette-like dolls doing routines as simple as the ones Andy does 
with his dolls.  At one point Woody can't decide whether 'tis nobler to wear 
out in the hands of a loving child, or be preserved with his old-time 
buddies behind museum glass.
Q:  How about the non-animation aspects of the movie?
A:  The script is better written than many live-action movie scripts.  The 
dialogue is snappy and quirky, developing the characters easily.  It's a 
very kid-friendly film, a fact welcome in these days when most offerings in 
a mutiplex are R ratings.  There are probably fewer jokes per minute in this 
film, but as I've said, a little more action.  The music is still strong, 
but the two reprises of "You've Got a Friend" (one by Robert Goulet as 
Wheezy!) suggest the original movie has the edge in score.  Camera - or 
computer - angles are inventive and consistently clever, using the best 
options of the medium.
Q:  Tom Hanks or Tim Allen?
A:  Again, relative.  Whoever you like.  They are both so well cast!  Hanks' 
Woody seems natural with virtually any character he encounters;  there's a 
charming scene in which he puts Andy's real puppy through a series of 
tricks, and rubs the dog's belly until its leg waves in scratching.  Tim 
Allen is expert at Buzz's bravado;  the spaceman realizes he's a toy, and 
it's hilarious when he meets another Buzz doll, with the same voice, who has 
not been informed of the truth.
Q:  Here's an important question.  Will you buy the video?
A:  A sure thing.  It will be a great one to watch again and again, 
especially if you have kids.  It's as good as any Disney except, perhaps, 
"Beauty and the Beast."  John Lasseter and his co-directors have put scads 
of care and work into this production, and the jokes and cultural references 
alone are enough to qualify it as a classic.  Recommended for all ages, this 
movie is a sure bet to entertain parents and kids out for a nice afternoon, 
teens on a group date, or seniors, who will love a cameo by Geri of the 
chess cartoon "Geri's Game."

Well, do YOU really care whether or not David Schwimmer gets the girl? I sure 
don't, and yet that's about as challenging an issue as you'll find in most 
movies intended for grown-ups. No wonder kids are so sharp -- they have 
movies like "Toy Story 2" to fire their imaginations. The film's central 
dilemma, albeit one that has to be faced by a cowboy doll, is a complex 
question of loyalty that requires careful diplomacy to solve. This is not 
just 85 minutes of mindless cartoon action, but a work that could conceivably 
be shown to an ethics class, as stimulus for group discussion.
Or to a drama class, a parody-writing class, a nursery class... "Toy Story 2" 
is wonderful universal entertainment, a worthy sequel to "Toy Story" (1995), 
which was the first ever feature film created entirely through computer 
animation. It's not quite as good, but I didn't expect it to be -- the 
original was one of the most involving movies ever made. But it is even more 
ambitious, and delights us in different ways.
Less of this film's appeal lies in discovering its world; it assumes 
familiarity with the first movie, where we were introduced to the toys in the 
bedroom of a kid named Andy. Whenever humans were out of sight, the toys came 
to life, and made sure their domain was running smoothly. They've really got 
their work cut out for them this time; the stakes are now much higher than a 
fight for Andy's affections.
It all starts with greedy toy merchant Al (Wayne Knight) stealing cowboy doll 
Woody (Tom Hanks) from Andy's house. Woody, it seems, was the star of a hit 
puppet show on television in the 1950s, the merchandise of which has been 
like gold dust ever since the programme was cancelled. A toy museum in Japan 
is prepared to pay Al millions of dollars for the complete set of "Woody's 
Roundup" action figures, which he now has.
Surely the other toys must save Woody before Andy gets back from summer camp! 
Space-ranger Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) takes charge of this mission, 
bringing along the motley crew of pig-shaped money bank Hamm (John 
Ratzenberger), dinosaur model Rex (Wallace Shawn), Slinky Dog (Jim Varney) 
and Mr Potato Head (Don Rickles). This is a grand adventure, and also leads 
us to Woody's aforementioned dilemma.
You see, Woody would love to return to Andy; the kid and the toy rely on and 
enjoy each other. But if he leaves the "Woody's Roundup" characters, who have 
all been abandoned by their owners, they will not be bought by the museum and 
will be put back in storage, which is as close to hell as toys can go. Who 
needs him the most? Is it worth going back to Andy, when one day the boy will 
grow up and forget about him? Is living in a museum a tolerable 
self-sacrifice?
These are questions worth caring about, for characters you just gotta love. 
Some have criticised "Toy Story 2" as a marketing tool to sell a bunch of 
toys; even if that were true, it would be okay, because these are beautiful 
toys. They may have been created on computers, but they still have energy, 
perfect comic timing and an astonishingly natural sense of irony. I once saw 
a short film from the same animation team, PIXAR, which contained nothing but 
two jumping lamps -- and somehow the geniuses made even these faceless 
objects convey emotion. 
With so much revolutionary technology involved, I really think it says 
something that the most awesome things about the "Toy Story" movies are 
elements of plot and character. The screenplay provides obvious heroes with 
simple goals, but still never settles into formula; and so we never know how 
much more of the story is left to unfold, we get lost in individual moments 
and the time flies by.
"Toy Story 2" deserves to be analysed with more depth and elaboration than 
this. But my strongest memory of the film is simply the laughter of myself, 
my companions and the rest of the audience. It is a pure, innocent, visceral 
delight -- good fun for adults, and nothing short of a gift for children all 
over the world.

Featuring the voice talents of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack,
Kelsey Grammer, Wayne Knight. Rated G.
Toy Story 2 is the family film to end all family films (sans The Lion
King, which is untouchable). It's a profound masterpiece of wit and
truth that should exhilirate kids and non-snobbish adults (read: those
who don't mind being touched by messages a ten-year-old can grasp)
alike. It's wholesome entertainment, alright -- the best example of it
in years -- but it doesn't take the form of a preachy diatribe like so
many "lesson movies" have over the years, instead, the filmmakers
devote their efforts to giving us a rollicking good time. We got it.
Produced by the enormously successful Pixar Disney division, this is
the sequel (duh) to the (almost) equally terrific 1995 hit Toy Story.
While the two certainly have some plot similarities, I was impressed at
just how different this was; like the best sequels, it expands on the
concept of the original rather than merely retreading it. It involves a
rescue mission, just like the first one, but this time, we go to
Infinity and Beyond. You see, Woody (voice of Tom Hanks has been stolen
by "Big Al" (Wayne Knight) because apparently, Woody is a valuable
doll. In fact a long time ago, Woody even had his own tv show, he just
didn't know it. Now, he and three companion toys are to be sent away
for display in a museum.
It's up to Buzz Lightyear and his pals to rescue Woody from Big Al's
materialistic grasp, and for that, they must journey 19 blocks (!) and
seek out "Big Al's Toy Barn," a Toys R' Us-ish plaything megastore.
This leads to a genius scene in the toy store itself, with a Buzz
impostor, a Barbie tourguide and, of course, a Darth Vader-style
supervillain. It's not long before they realize that the place where
woody is hidden is actually across the street in Big Al's office and go
there -- only to be followed by Buzz Lightyear's arch nemesis.
Meanwhile, Woody faces a spectacularly profound moral dilemma: should
he stay with his new friends and go to the museum, where he will
probably be marveled at forever or should he try to go back to Andy
who, in all likelyhood, will get over his affection for him and throw
him away before long? This has more substance than most "adult" movies
can even hope for -- certainly more thoughtful and complex than some of
this year's "deep" movies, like Fight Club or The Insider -- and it is
developed beautifully, not letting a single opportunity go to waste.
Gracefully, it speaks to children about faith, loyalty, decision
making, abandonment and more in one fell swoop. It talks to them on
their level, without condescending, simplifying or spelling anything
out; it respects their intelligence and ours. Ergo, adults can
appreciate it even more than their kids.
Pixar's computer animation, though it has lost some of its novelty
since the breakthrough of the original Toy Story, is still rapidly
developing, and Toy Story 2 takes it to new heights. After Antz and A
Bug's Life took the computer graphics so close to reality that we
thought it couldn't get any richer, this new flick takes it yet another
step further. The characters are so real that they're surreal, as if
we're in a parallel universe rather than a cartoon. It's a marvelous
experience, akin to being given a peek of a new world we've never seen
before and may never see again.
Besides being profound, Toy Story 2 is exceptionally witty, with adult-
oriented jabs at Star Wars, Barbie, tv remote controls, et al. It's a
nice reversal from 1999's earlier Disney animated feature Tarzan, which
had almost nothing to engage adults. This recalls the wonderful
Hercules, which threw more mature gags at the audience (the "Grecian
Express" credit card?) fast enough to make my head spin.
Is "masterpiece" too strong a word for Toy Story 2? Is it appropriate
to use that moniker for a family movie? My answers are no and yes. See
the movie and come up with your own but don't dismiss it because it's a
cartoon.

     There is no finer comic filmmaker working today than John Lasseter. 
No one better understands how to choreograph an elaborate sight gag; no
one better nails the timing of comic dialogue. He mixes the wild visual
sensibility of the Coen brothers, the anarchic pack-the-margins madness of
the Zucker brothers, and the sly wit/broad buffoonery tag team of the Marx
Brothers. Combine these elements with a genuine warmth and love of
character, and you have one of the closest things we have to a pop culture
genius in American cinema circa 1999.
     Incidentally, John Lasseter directs computer-generated films. If you
think that qualification renders such praise moot, shame on you for your
short-sightedness. Movies just don't get much more blissfully, 
intelligently entertaining than TOY STORY and A BUG'S LIFE, and I didn't
think it would be possible for a sequel to approach TOY STORY's heights of 
savvy family filmmaking. Once again, Lasseter has broadened my thinking.
His plaything creations soar again in a story that finds Woody (voice of
Tom Hanks) kidnapped from a yard sale by unscrupulous toy store owner and
collector Al McWhiggin (Wayne Knight). It turns out Woody is a toy
connected to a popular 1950s kiddie television series, and the last item
Big Al needs to complete a set including Woody's gal pal Jessie (Joan
Cusack) and Prospector Stinky Pete (Kelsey Grammer). A future behind glass
in a Tokyo museum awaits Woody unless Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and
company can rescue him.
     When you're dealing with a film like TOY STORY 2, it's easy to spend
far too much time talking about the technology and the referrential gags.
Yes, the technology has improved by orders of magnitude even over the
original TOY STORY, making human characters like Al an even more seamless
part of the film, and making possible some dizzying, dazzling action
sequences. And yes, you could spend multiple viewings of TOY STORY 2
looking for the inside jokes: Tour Guide Barbie (Jodi Benson) admonishing
passengers bilingually a la Disneyland to "remain seated please" in a toy
car; high-speed channel surfing including Pixar shorts like TIN TOY and
LUXO JR.; a toy repair expert (Jonathan Harris) whose face recycles the
star of the Oscar-winning short GERI'S GAME; genial pokes at TRON,
JURASSIC PARK and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. It's a film that easily could
have cruised on its cutting edge, its hipness and the good will of
familiar faces.
     Lasseter and his writers, fortunately, appear incapable of cruising.
TOY STORY soared not because it was revolutionary, but because it was a
marvelously told film story -- a more human story than 90% of all films
actually involving humans. That human touch continues here, from the 
splendid continuing voice characterizations of Woody and Buzz by Tom Hanks
and Tim Allen, to Jessie's mournful recollection of how long it has been
since a child played with her and loved her. The kidnap/rescue structure
of TOY STORY 2 may seem familiar, but this film may actually be a bit more
resonant than the original. Leave it to Lasseter to turn a family film
into a meditation on love: Behind the pure entertainment, there's a story
about broken hearts and the risks of potentially transient relationships.
     And in front of those themes, there's pure entertainment. The
snippets from old episodes of "Woody's Roundup" are a hiliarious homage to
Howdy Doody; the toys' adventure crossing an intersection while hiding 
beneath orange traffic cones approaches Buster Keaton brilliance. It's
true that TOY STORY 2 is somewhat busier than the original, with a few too
many characters to keep up with. Some of the additional story elements
-- like Buzz encountering a naive, fresh-out-of-the-box version of himself
in the toy store -- are fun but occasionally distracting. This may not be
the instant classic TOY STORY was, but it's too close to quibble. There is
so much here that's delightful in so many ways, you begin to realize what
movies are supposed to be, yet so rarely are: transporting experiences.
I'm sure many filmmakers would love the absolute control over their movie
universe -- every blink, every blade of grass -- that John Lasseter has
over his. I'm equally sure most of them wouldn't have a clue what to do
with it. A computer, as the cliche goes, is just a tool. It takes a
visionary like John Lasseter to turn it into a magic wand.

Yee-haw!  The long-awaited sequel featuring Cowboy
Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) and Buzz Lightyear (voiced
by Tim Allen) has finally arrived.  And, if there is
any movie to see this holiday season, this is it!
When the first Toy Story came to the big screen.  It
was a fabulous achievement in both Disney storytelling
and computer-animation.  We fell in love with not only
Woody and Buzz, but the supporting cast of toys that
included a piggy bank, Mr. Potato Head, green army
men, and other playthings from the pre-Atari era. 
These toys stimulated the child's imagination in every
way that TS2 will stimulate yours.
The underlying story is about friendship and
sacrifice.  Woody learns the frailty of his existence
when during playtime with his owner, his arm is
accidentally damaged.  He is exiled away on the top
shelf where he learns the fate of a toy that had not
been seen in quite some time.  It's Weezy, a squeaking
penguin whose squeaker no longer works.  Weezy will be
heading for the dreaded garage sale.  Woody attempts
to save him.  This beginning sequence is important to
the concept of Toy Story.  Toys do have a life of
their own, and the happiness that they experience is
dependent on the love that the owner gives, much like
a pet.  Toys feel, they long for affection, and they
watch out for one another.  
In trying to save Weezy, Woody winds up as an item in
the garage sale.  A shopper recognizes Woody as a rare
collector's item.  His name is Big Al (voiced by Wayne
Knight) and he quickly snatches this rare find and
drives off.  Buzz and his crew of toys must get Woody
back. Using the unique mapping abilities of
Etch-a-Sketch, they embark on a dangerous search and
rescue mission across town.  To cross a street for
example, they hide underneath orange traffic cones,
which force oncoming cars to swerve left and right
through the ad hoc construction zone.
Meanwhile, Woody learns why he was of such interest to
Big Al.  Woody is one of an ensemble of toys called
the Roundup Gang.  The other members of the gang
include Cowgirl Jessie (voiced by Joan Cusack), Stinky
Pete (voiced by Kelsey Grammer), and a horse named
Bullseye.  He is further amazed to learn that his
popularity stemmed from an old black and white
television puppet show.  A Japanese museum wants to
collect the entire ensemble.  Without Woody, the
others are worthless and would be locked away forever.
 It's a fate that no toy ever wants to experience. 
Jessie pleads with Woody to stay recalling her
experience as a toy once loved but then discarded once
her owner grew up.  Stinky Pete, still in its original
box, laments the fact that nobody would ever love a
doll the way he looks.  Their concerns touch Woody,
for he knows that it may just be a matter of time
before Andy forgets about him, especially with his
damaged arm.  But Buzz tells Woody that it's better to
be loved for a little while than to be locked away
behind a glass partition in some museum.
Like the first Toy Story, TS2 uses the same
state-of-the-art computer animation.  There is
enormous attention to details, and the film goes much
further than being just a Sunday school lesson about
friends.  Terrific shots of humor abound throughout
the film, and for the older set, there is also a great
deal of action, as the fate of Woody becomes unclear. 
Will Buzz be able to convince him to return?  Will Big
Al get his way and ship him off to Japan.  The
20-minute finale is nothing less than spectacular.  I
was thoroughly impressed with the skillfulness of the
animation, the pace of the story, and the ability of
the writers to remind us that toys are as magical as
our own childhood.  Far better than the original, TS2
should be atop your movie wishlist.

   Nothing's permanent on this Earth of ours, not even life. 
Love is transitory.  If fifty percent of American marriages now
end in divorce as couples outgrow each other, think of how
many kids separate permanently from their toys when they
get tired of them or when the playthings are inevitably
outgrown.  We'd not be surprised to learn that close to one
hundred percent of our miniature trinkets and gadgets wind
up in the trash bin or in the yard sales--torn, raggedly,
misused and tired--the feelings of our little friends obviously
hurt beyond repair.  In the vivid imaginations of scripters
Andrew Stanton, Rita Hsiao, Doug Chamberlin and Chris
Webb, human tykes are not the only ones who may be bereft
when their usually inanimate pets are broken.  The soldiers,
sky-walkers, doggies, piggies and miscellaneous other once-
sturdy pals are emotionally crushed as well.  What's more,
never do these buddies become indifferent to their caretakers
as their stewards so often become to them.
   "Toy Story 2" is a homage to the immeasurable charms of
the eponymous critters, a testimony to the impermanence of
inanimate things which have given us alternately selfish and
sentimental human beings so much gladness during our most
wonderful years.  Featuring the ultimate in 3-dimensional,
Pixar animation, director John Lasseter's tale of
homesickness and bonding cuts neatly across audience
barriers of age, race, social class to provide a heartwarming
portrait of the chums we've all enjoyed or are savoring still,
whether the rag dolls of financially strapped kids or the
computerized zappers of the rich and famous.  Utilizing the
voices of such greats as Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Kelsey
Grammer and Joan Cusack to get into the heads of the
characters, director Lasseter--whose job has been made easy
by a large team of crack designers--unfolds a story whose
plot is as absorbing as the animation is colorful and vivid.
Anyone who has ever felt guilty when leaving a beloved dog
home alone while heading off to work or school now has
reason to feel even more contrite, however. You see, the
slinky-dogs and other trinkets that line the shelves of the little
ones have lives of their own.  They miss you when you're
gone.  But happily, they have their own little pals to enjoy
while their owners are engaged in less important matters than
playing.  We know that now that we've seen this frenetically-
paced yarn, an often bust-out-laughing tale of toys and tykes.
   The story opens as little Andy heads off to camp, leaving
cowboy Woody (Tim Hanks) behind under his mom's care. 
When Woody is kidnapped by a greedy collector (Wayne
Knight), more interested in investments than in art, he learns
that he is part of a set whose value has dramatically
increased when he is added to the combo.  While Woody's
pals back home led by Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) head out to
the collector's business to rescue him, Woody discovers that
he was once a 1950's TV star in the role of a puppet (think
Howdy Doody) and that he had been part of a family that
includes a horse named Bullseye, a prospector named Stinky
Pete (Kelsey Grammer), and a cowgirl that seems to run
through her role on speed, Jessie (Joan Cusack).  Woody is
given a guilt trip that more than matches his journey to the
collector's store.  His rediscovered family tell him that if he
deserts the brood, they will be placed in boxes, stored away
indefinitely in the dark.  How will the cowboy solve the
dilemma?  If he stays, he will betray his beloved owner,
Andy.  If he goes back home, he will abandon his own
extended family.  While Buzz has his own, more visceral
friction with his arch enemy, Emperor Zurg (Andrew Stanton),
Woody is faced with a crisis of conscience that could take 15
years of couchwork to resolve.
   Parents of exceptionally sensitive kids could be concerned
that their own young-uns could wind up afflicted with guilt
over the toys they once discarded.  There is probably little to
fear, though, as the little ones who will delight in the
unaffected performances of these figures (just about all
adorable except for Stinky Pete who is bitter because he has
never been bought and unwrapped) will simply eat up the
luminous landscape of this wonderfully realized film.  Oddly
enough, the movie was at first intended for direct-to-video
release, but once the producers got over that silly notion they
made sure that considerable attention to every technical
detail was put into the happy story.
Rated G.  Running Time: 85 minutes.  (C) 1999

Susan Granger's review of "TOY STORY 2" (Walt Disney Pictures)
   Among our many blessings this Thanksgiving, let us be
thankful for the astonishing, fun-filled Toy Story 2, the best
animated comedy sequel ever made. This magical, incredibly inventive
mix of action and humor continues, right where it left off, with the
gang ready to play in Andy's bedroom. Only, when Andy goes off to
Cowboy Camp, Woody gets left behind and is kidnapped by the greedy
owner of Al's Toy Barn. It seems Woody's a highly valuable collectible
from a 1950s TV show called Woody's Roundup. At Al's place, Woody
meets another family from his illustrious past - Jessie, the cowgirl;
Bullseye, the horse; and Stinky Pete, the Prospector. But, back in
Andy's house, Buzz Lightyear has recruited Mr. Potato Head, Slinky
Dog, Rex and Hamm for a rescue mission. Can his pals find Woody before
Andy comes home? And, will Woody want to come back to Andy's bedroom
now that he's discovered he's a prized museum piece?
  The original Toy Story was an international sensation, the
third highest grossing animated film of all time - behind The Lion
King and Aladdin.  Originally planned as a direct-to-video release,
this adventurous sequel reunites the same creative team, including
Pixar's John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton, along with Tom Hanks, Tim
Allen, Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger and
Annie Potts. New voices are Wayne Knight, Kelsey Grammer and Joan
Cusack, plus Little Mermaid Jodi Benson as Barbie. Composer Randy
Newman's "You've Got a Friend in Me" is reprised, along with new songs
"Woody's Roundup" and "When She Loved Me," sung by Sarah McLachlan On
the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, Toy Story 2 is another knockout
10. Don't miss it - or, as Buzz Lightyear would say: "To infinity and
beyond!"

There has always been a constant battle over whether sequels really have the
potential to become great films that surpass their originals. While not a
sequel, (it was actually a prequel if you wish to get literal), Star Wars -
Episode I: The Phantom Menace didn't even come close to its three originals.
There was no heart, no substance, and no real meaning to anything that went on
in the movie. Not to mention the acting was horrendous. Austin Powers: The Spy
Who Shagged Me wasn't very good either. It was full of bathroom humor and
extremely stupid gags that were unfunny and distasteful. I think that we should
both agree never to mention I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. But every
once in a while a movie comes along that is not only better than the original,
it surpasses the original film tremendously. The last film that comes to mind
to do this was Scream 2, and the same type of thing has been introduced in Toy
Story 2. In the first movie, they were doing a trial and error picture, seeing
if the audience and the general public would like what the movie had to offer.
Once they learned that they did, the sequel contained even more of the original
material, and a couple of new surprises. When talking about Toy Story 2, the
only word I can come up with is, "Wow!" This is one of the best movies of the
year, is beautifully animated, and (Gasp!) will be enjoyed by all members of
the family. 
Woody is trying to save a dust-filled toy named Wheezy from being sold at the
family garage sale. He accidentally gets stuck in a 25 cents box and is found
by a vintage toy collector who steals him to complete his vintage cowboy
collection. It turns out that Woody used to have his own show in the 1950s. He
was extremely popular and had a numerous amount of merchandise made with his
picture on it. "Iâm a yo-yo! I used to be a yo-yo!" Woody exclaims. But there
is bad news, the entire collection of Woody's Round-Up toys are being sent to a
toy museum in Japan, and Woody doesn't want to leave his home.
So itâs up to Buzz, Rex, Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, and Slinky to venture across
town and find him so that he can return home before Andy gets back from his
vacation. They meet various challenges on the way, including Barbie dolls, a
dangerous highway crossing, and a visit to the Al's Toy Barn. Will they get to
Woody on time? Or will he be lost overseas forever?
The geniuses at Pixar have done it again. The animation in the film is
breathtaking. Each frame is brightly colored and vibrant, each new scene
creates a realistic looking setting, and the facial expressions on the toys and
people are amazing. There are plenty of hidden jokes and gags from previous
Pixar productions. Watchful viewers will notice A Bug's Life calendar in Andy's
room, as well as Bug Life toys in the Al's Toy Barn scene. If you've seen A
Bug's Life, or like animation, will be quick to notice that the man who fixes
up Woody is the same man who played chess with himself in the animated short
Geri's Game. Geri's Game was screened last year before A Bug's Life. The script
helps the film greatly, it never ventures far from its original formula, and is
chock full of all of the zany characters that you love. You'll get to see a lot
more of the supporting characters too. Much unlike last year's Babe: Pig in the
City, even when the characters go out for a big adventure, they never lose
their loving heart. Extreme laughter is to be found around the theater from
grandparent to teenager, which is one of the things that makes the film so
special. It's an extremely rare thing to find a film that the entire family can
watch (and all enjoy) together. So go and see Toy Story 2 (which is breaking
box office records) now, you'll love it. This great sequel (I'm ready for a
third one!) gets *** 1/2 stars.
The Young-Uns: The film contains just one slightly frightening scene involving
a fight between two characters. Good Age: 2 & Up

Grade:  B+
When Andy leaves for cowboy camp, his mother holds a yard sale and scrounges in
his room for old toys.  One of these toys is Wheezy, a penguin with a broken
squeaker.  Woody (Tom Hanks) saddles up Andy's dog and rides out into the yard
to rescue Wheezy.  Woody succeeds in his mission, but doesn't make it back to
the house before Al, the unscrupulous owner of Al's Toy Barn, recognizes Woody
as a rare collector's item and steals him.
Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) leads Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Mr. Potato Head (Don
Rickles), Slinky Dog (Jim Varney), and Rex (Wallace Shawn) into the city to
find their friend.  Meanwhile Woody discovers the reason he was kidnapped.  Al
has collected every piece of merchandising from the 1950's TV puppet show
"Woody's Round-up" except for a Woody doll.  Now that the collection is
complete, Al plans to sell Woody and his Round-up Gang-Bullseye the horse,
Jessie the cowgirl (Joan Cusack), and Stinky Pete the old prospector (Kelsey
Grammer)-to a toy museum in Japan.  The Gang is happy about the move; they've
been in storage for years waiting for Woody.  If Woody doesn't go with them,
they'll be closed up in a dark box again, possibly forever.  Trying to convince
him to stay with them, Jessie tells Woody how she was abandoned when her owner
grew up, and Woody realizes that his days as a beloved toy are numbered.
While Woody ponders whether to go to Japan or to go home to Andy, Buzz and the
boys invade Al's Toy Barn, where the Buzz we know is replaced by another Buzz
who doesn't know he's a toy.  The new Buzz generates the movie's biggest laughs
as he leads the other toys in an assault on "Zurg's fortress" (i.e., Al's
apartment building).
The original "Toy Story" won me over because its central themes reflected a
grown-up sensibility rather than the usual
this-is-what-we-think-kids-want-to-hear.  While most kids' movies take the
position that every person is special and has an extraordinary destiny to
fulfill, in "Toy Story" Buzz discovered that he wasn't special, that he was
just like everyone else.  Buzz sank into a suicidal depression, but Woody
showed Buzz that being a toy was worthwhile because a toy is loved and a toy
makes a child happy.  In other words, it's okay to be ordinary if you have love
and a purpose in your life.  Most of us probably come to the same conclusion
when we realize that we're not space rangers and we're never going to be.
"Toy Story 2" addresses the question raised by the conclusion drawn by the
first movie.  Woody is forced to recognize that Andy will grow up and forget
him and that he will likely be discarded, abandoned, or sealed up in a dark box
in the attic.  This is another big grown-up theme:  everything ends.  The theme
is introduced early in the movie when Woody's arm is torn and Andy places him
on a shelf rather than taking him to cowboy camp.  On the shelf, Woody meets
Wheezy, who's dusty, broken, and forgotten.  The other toys are shocked that
Woody has been "shelved," and they worry that Woody's ride out to the 25-cent
box at the yard sale is a suicide attempt.  After he's stolen, Woody has to
decide between a long life in a display case and an uncertain future with Andy
and his pals.
Of course, in spite of the heavy themes "Toy Story 2" explores, it's also very
funny.  Most of the laughs come from the toys' assault on Al's Toy Barn and on
the apartment building.  The brief substitution of a new, still delusional Buzz
was a welcome surprise; I'd wondered how a sequel could be as funny as the
original without the pompous attitude Buzz displayed in the original.
Most of the vocal performances are first-rate.  Tom Hanks stands out for the
level of enthusiasm he puts into his work.  However, one voice-over also stands
out as horribly miscast.  Kelsey Grammer sounds nothing like an old prospector.
 Although he does a lot of voice-over work in commercials and on "The Simpsons"
(as Sideshow Bob), Grammer only makes slight variations on his own voice.  He
doesn't have the range to pull off a role like Stinky Pete.
The animation is even better than in the first.  Especially impressive were the
textures of the figures.  We can now see the difference between flesh and
plastic; in the first movie the people looked just like the toys, but now human
skin looks soft and has a slight bluish tint.  We can also see that Bo Peep is
porcelain.  As you can tell from the long-winded phrasing common in the
merchandising -- "Disney and Pixar's 'Toy Story 2'" -- this is Pixar's coming
out party.  To celebrate they appended their first project, a hilarious short
about two desklamps and a rubber ball, to the beginning of the movie.  They
made the short in 1986, which is incredible when one considers the relatively
primitive level of computer technology available then.
On the downside, "Toy Story 2" follows the formula of the original so closely
that the sequel comes off a bit stale, and some sections tend to drag. 
Overall, though, I had a great time and found "Story 2" to be a worthy
successor to the first "Toy Story."
Bottom Line:  This one really is fun for the whole family!

     Woody, Buzz Lightyear, and the whole gang of TOY STORY are back in
a sequel that has all the sophisticated special effects and a more
complex story.  The adventure is a little more extravagant.  But even
more important the toys face concerns that will be even more resonant
with the adults in the audience than with the children who would appear
to be the target audience.
     The second TOY STORY opus opens with a space-opera fantasy
featuring that commander of the limitless ether, Buzz Lightyear (voiced
by Tim Allen).  It seems at first out of context but serves stretch the
capabilities of Pixar and to introduce Buzz Lightyear's video game
enemy, the Emperor Zurg.  This sequence soon leads us to a familiar
bedroom where toy owner Andy is headed for Cowboy Camp and planning to
take with him Woody (Tom Hanks).  But it is not to be.  A last minute
injury leaves Woody sidelined on the shelf with an arm nearly coming
off.  Andy's mother makes matters even worse for Woody by reminding
Andy that toys don't last forever.  This stokes Woody's fears of
abandonment.  In fact, a yard sale that very day is planned to remove a
friend from the toys' midst, a penguin squeeze toy.  Woody saves the
penguin only by venturing into the yard sale.  There he is recognized
by a local sleazy toy collector and toy store owner as a valuable
collector's item.  Woody it seems was modeled on a popular cowboy TV
marionette from the 1950s.  Woody in stolen in order to complete a set
for the collector.  Woody it seems has a family he has never known
about--a girlfriend, sidekick, and horse.  They are now a complete set
and can come out of storage and make people happy.  But to do that,
Woody can never return to Andy.  Somebody has to lose.  Children's
films often have characters choose between good and bad, but rarely
between one good cause and another one.
     There are certainly films made with scripts a lot worse than the
first TOY STORY film, but TOY STORY 2 is a much more satisfying script.
This is actually surprising since seven different people worked on the
story and script.  That generally is a very bad sign.  But the script
manages to have some resonance without losing a good sense of humor
including several laugh-out-loud jokes.  There are multiple film
allusions including a very funny one to JURASSIC PARK.  The makers have
recognized that Bo-Peep, the only female toy of the first film, left a
lot to be desired in character complexity.  Jessie (Joan Cusack) as the
toy based on Woody's TV girlfriend has her own agenda.
     Pixar's main stock and trade is, of course, computer animation.
So an important question is how does this film look?  Much of the
animation technique will be familiar from the original TOY STORY.  That
does not break new ground.  Andy looks no more real than he did in the
last film.  That could be attributed to continuity.  But this film adds
two new human characters: Bad guy Al McWhiggin and the Cleaner.  The
Cleaner has just a cameo and looks to be the title character from
Pixar's Academy Award winning short "Geri's Game."  McWhiggin is
overweight, middle-aged, and balding.  He appears to be their most
realistic looking human figure to date.  They also have a nice
dachshund puppy.  Generally Pixar keeps the number of characters with
physically soft surfaces to a minimum as they are probably much harder
to animate.  (Notice that their early character Luxo is make of rigid
pieces.  The bugs of A BUG'S LIFE had shells.)  Attention to detail is
particularly nice.  Apparently their layout artist is usually good and
often excellent.  Note touches abound like that after McWhiggin has
eaten cheese puffs his fingers appear yellow orange.
     Just as the classic BLACK BEAUTY has at its heart the tragic and
cruel ways that insensitive humanity treats horses, TOY STORY 2 shows
that a toy's life is a bleak affair.  While the first TOY STORY saw a
toy's life as being played with or being boringly left on the shelf,
the new film hits at some fairly disturbing material having toy society
echo some of the worst of human society.  Old friendships can be broken
up at the whim of the owner or the owner's parents.  A moment of
careless play leaves Woody without the use of one of his arms.  This
leaves Woody haunted by the fear of what will happen when he is broken
or Andy gets too old to play with him.  There is ahead for him the
oblivion of being dropped into the wastebasket.  But some toys have
even worse things to fear.  Jessie and Stinky Pete have recent memories
of the living oblivion of being in storage in a dark closet.  Stinky
Pete has never even been out of the tight confines of his original
wrapping.  Hiding within the charming children's film is a very dark
and bleak look at the life of toys and disturbing shadows of the human
condition.
     If there is a problem with the new story it is flaws in its logic.
If there is a Prime Directive for living toys it has to be this: Leave
no physical evidence that living toys have been present.  Without
giving details, let me say that the script blatantly violates that
directive.  The humans would realize at the end of this film that
something is going on that is more than meets the eye.  Also this
episode creates questions that it needed to answer.  If Woody were a
character from a 1950s TV show, that would mean that the toy must have
been made in the 1950s.  Woody would have a great deal of previous
life, probably with another owner.  Does he remember this previous
life?  How did a 45 year old toy get into Andy's collection?  The
ending of the film is telegraphed by the logic of what Pixar would and
would not be likely to do with the series.
     TOY STORY 2 is an excellent example of a sequel that is more worth
seeing than the original film.  It most certainly is not a disguised
remake as sequels too often are.  I rate it an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale
and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.

I won't be coy; I'll just say it straight: I loved this movie.  If you
hang on my every word, then the rest of this review can wait till later;
hie thee to your local cineplex pronto, bucko.  And be sure to watch the
kids in the front aisle.  If, like I was before I went to see "Toy Story
2", you're in need of a good dose of cheer, the kids in the front aisle
will bring as much of that as watching the movie itself will.  Trust
Bammer on that one.
Ah, you're still here.  Alrighty then; I guess I should earn my keep by
actually reviewing this flick...
The Story (WARNING: some spoilers contained below):
As the taglines so playfully pun, "the Toys are back in town": the old
familiar faces (and voices) that many of us grew up with--even if "grew up
with" started with the original "Toy Story"--come back to the big screen. 
Our old pals Andy (Morris) and his "living" Toys, cowboy Woody (Hanks),
astronaunt Buzz Lightyear (Allen), Mr. Potato Head (Rickles), Slinky Dog
(Varney), dinosaur Rex (Shawn), Hamm the piggy bank (Ratzenberger), Green
Army Men Sergeant (Ermey)  and Woody's lady, Bo Peep (Potts, complete with
Peep's Sheep), make a return appearance; they're joined by cowgirl Jessie
(Cusack), Stinky Pete The Prospector (Grammer), Bullseye the horse
(Stiers), Mrs. Potato Head (Harris), Tour Guide Barbie (Benson), and
probably the Father of the beanie-baby craze, Al The Toy
Collector/"Chicken Man" (Knight), in a tale that combines humor,
nostalgia, amazing computer animation, and even a Lesson or two, for kids
of all ages [yep, even for us 36-year-old Chicks].  
[STRONGER WARNING: the next paragraph definitely contains detailed movie
plotline information; if you do not wish to be "spoiled" whatsoever, skip
to "The Upshot"].
Lest you think that cast was too large to fit in a 100-minute movie, wait
till you hear the plotline: in a rapid-fire turn of events, Andy shelves
Woody after accidently "breaking" Woody's arm; Woody's shelf-mate, Wheezer
the not-squeaking penguin (which, unless I'm mistaken, is either modelled
after the Linux penguin, or is a character from a rather famous film
short...but I'm digressing again) is destined for the one event Toys hate:
the yard sale!  Woody accidently winds up in the "for sale" bin, from
which Toy-Collector Al--realizing that Woody might actually be a
collector's item--steals him.  This turns out to be a joyous occasion for
Jessie and The Prospector, who belong to Woody's "family"--but not for his
pals Buzz and company, who, remembering Woody's heroic rescue of Buzz in
the original "Toy Story", set off to do some derring-do of their own.  But
will Woody want to leave his new-found family, to go back to Andy, who may
have grown too old to play with dolls?  Hmmm... [end SPOILERS]
The Upshot:
I've taken the chance that some folks [who, obviously, will have forgotten
their Reading Is Fundamental lessons] will be upset at the audacity of my
giving so much of the movie away in the paragraph immediately
above--because it begins to address a subtle, yet very important aspect of
"Toy Story 2": it's more than just a "kiddie movie".  The attention to
detail alone separates it from your average animated cartoon, even those
that are as heavily computer-generated (TV's "ReBoot" comes quickly to
mind--RIP).  But there's something more going on here, something that I'll
address a little later.
For now, what's on the surface is delightful as-is.  
The original "Toy Story" wowed us (especially us techies) with its very
real-looking computer animation; I know I'm not the only one that had to
look more than a few times, before realizing that Andy and the other
Humans, weren't real.  Still, though there are some moments where you'd
swear they blended live-action with animation (check out Al's nose hairs
when he's passed out on the couch after his Cheesy Poofs attack), the
animation seems less precise in this movie than it was in its
predecessor's.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, though; where TS1
built the whole world of Toys and Humans as an introduction to the skill
of the technicians, if not the writers and voices, TS2 has a much deeper
tale.  I found myself wowed by the Pretty Pictures less often; here,
instead, I saw the characters.
And what a great bunch of characters there were!  Without going into
"spoilage" territory, I'll just say that the large cast was served well
enough, with no one character really hogging (oops, sorry Hamm!) the
spotlight the way Hanks' "Woody" and Allen's "Buzz" did last go-round;
and, again with an eye on detail, storylines that took place in TS1 are
built-upon in TS2.  But who would've thought that Mr. Potato Head would
be...[careful, Bammer; the kids might be reading]...would have a chance to
play "house" with his wife?  And remember the puppy Andy got in the first
flick?  Mmmhmm.  If I had to choose a weak spot, I'd go with Rex, who
bordered on whiny; even some of the kids in my group, started rolling
their eyes (on the other hand, my eyes got a workout when Jessie started
in with the Obligatory Disney Song--though after she was done, I was okay
about it because the song moved the story along in a somewhat necessary
fashion).  Though I can't truly recall Stiers (Major Winchester,
"M*A*S*H*") vocalizing Bullseye much, Grammer's take on Stinky Pete
reminded me exactly why I enjoy the TV show "Frasier" so much (would that
my favorite actor on that show, David Hyde Pierce, have been cast in TS2
as he was in my previously-favorite animated flick, "A Bug's Tale".  Alas,
it was not to be).  
By the time the movie was over, I wanted to run home and hug my "Curious
George" non-collector dolls.  Next time I see this movie--and believe me,
there'll be a next time, if only so I can catch everything I missed in
trying to take review notes--I think I'll bring old Curious with me.
The HUMAN Factor:
Frequent readers of my reviews know what is normally written in this
space; but something about this movie compelled me to take a different
tack this time.  Perhaps it's because I'm at a sensitive point in my life,
with a seriously ill family member in the hospital, and other stressors
that I won't bore my readers with--but there was something very
deep-reaching in this movie for me.  Between the concepts brought forth
about family, about friendship and obligations, about the silliness of
mere collecting of "treasure" and disposing of "junk" we no longer care
about, I came away from the movie with an appreciation of things I'd not
really given much thought to since I was a wee one, but that kids take the
greatest delight in.  Especially after seeing Jacob dancing his cute self
into a tizzy in front of the screen when the credits were rolling, to the
big-band-beat of Tom Scott's sax and Robert Goulet's singing "You've Got A
Friend In Me".
4-year-old Jacob, who I'd never met until today, made me grin so hard in
watching him dance, that I asked his parents if I could "interview" him
and his 11-year-old sister Jessica for my review.  I asked them both if
they liked the movie (yes, they both did), who their favorite characters
were (Buzz and Woody for Jessica, Buzz for Jacob; notably, their mom and I
both liked Bullseye the horse, best.  Hmmm.), and if they learned anything
from the movie.  Jessica couldn't really pinpoint anything, though she
politely agreed with my prompts; Jacob, on the other hand, was so hyper
after his delightful dance that he wouldn't stay still long enough for our
"interview", and when he calmed down for a minute, the adult in me seemed
to make him a bit less open than he was during his dance.  Which is,
basically, The Point I'm making: kids seem to have an understanding of the
sheer fun of Fun, fun for its own sake, that adults like me are simply
amazed at in watching it on a screen for an hour-and-a-half.  For me, the
layers that were behind the story in "Toy Story 2", though at first glance
they seemed to be simplistic "morals", made the story all the more deep. 
To Jacob, Buzz was cool, the music had a great beat, and he had a huge
space in which to run amuck for a few minutes.  And the funny thing is, we
were both "right".
Hey, call me a sentimental fool if you will, but some people pay Big Bucks
in therapy to gain that kind of insight; I figure that $7.50 (including a
box of popcorn--and lots of soul-cleansing laughs) ain't a bad tradeoff.
Bammer's Bottom Line:
I could feel the pull of the folks behind "Toy Story 2" wanting to impart
The Moral Of The Story to the audience, right near the end; by the last
scene, even my rediscovered inner-peace was starting to roil a wee bit. 
But it was a minor roil, and Jacob's Dance got me back into the smooth
groove.  So forget the gimmicky toy tie-ins (but hey, Tour Guide Barbie
had me rollin', and Mr. Potato Head's reaction...well, see it for
yourself); if you can't picture yourself going to a kiddie movie, go for
the gee-whiz animation, the inside jokes ("Father!")--look, if you just
need a reason, go because Bammer said so, 'kay? 
"Toy Story 2" (rating: greenlight) 
I dare all the bah-humbugers out there to go pick up their favorite
non-commercial toy and remember what it was like to be a kid.  I dare
ya...I double dare ya...I double dog dare ya!  Ah, heck, just go see this
movie!

Toy Story 2, featuring the voices of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Jim
Varney, John Ratzenberger, Annie Potts, Wallace Shawn, Joan Cusack, Kelsey
Grammer, Wayne Knight and Laurie Metcalf.  Directed by John Lasseter.  1999.
   Disney has always had a stranglehold on the motion picture animated
industry.  Even in a year with a varied amount of animated movies, including
the satrical South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut and the critically acclaimed
Iron Giant, Disney still ruled with another hit in Tarzan.  Disney decided to
throw out another animated feature for 1999, and it is Toy Story 2, engineered
by the geniuses at Pixar, who brought us the revolutionary original, Toy Story
and the clever sophomore effort, A Bug's Life.  Where these two have very minor
flaws, Pixar fixed every one of them in Toy Story 2, which is most likely the
best of the bunch.
   The original Toy Story was a clever movie, but more importantly, it was
revolutionary for being the first major motion picture that was animated
through computer generation.  Movie audiences were enthralled by this, and
despite being a very clever film, Toy Story was overshadowed by its own
benchmark-setting.  A Bug's Life tried to show that Pixar could not only
animate, but make a good film as well.  However, the addition of flowing
backgrounds and more lifelike settings still overshadowed the actual film. 
With Toy Story 2, however, Pixar is able to generate the best graphics yet, but
more importantly, it is overshadowed by a very clever and funny film.
   In Toy Story 2, all of the major players are back, with the addition of a
few others.  Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are back, and impeccable yet again, as
Woody and Buzz Lightyear, respectively.  The rest of the casted voices are
wonderful as well.  Don Rickles (Mr. Potato Head), Jim Varney (Slinky Dog),
John Ratzenberger (Hamm), Annie Potts (Bo Peep) and Wallace Shawn (Rex) are
back from the original, and do yet another wonderful job, plus there are even
more stars providing their vocals for the film.  Joan Cusack (Jessie the
Cowgirl), Wayne Knight (Al the Toy Collector) and Kelsey Grammer (The
Prospector) stand out from this ensemble.  Just like all Disney animated films,
the voice acting is dead on and is one of the most underrated aspects of
Disney's animated features.
   The premise for Toy Story 2 is very simple and easy for children to
understand.  Woody, while saving fellow toy Wheezy, gets caught in a Yard Sale.
 When Al the Toy Collector tries to buy him, Andy's Mom refuses.  However, Al
takes him anyway.  The toys see this, and Buzz, Hamm, Rex and Mr. Potato Head
set out to save Woody.  Woody gets taken back by Al to meet up with some other
toys, Jessie the Cowgirl, the Prospector and Bullseye.  Woody finds out he used
to be the star of a wildly popular children's TV show.  The movie than
chronicles the toys attempt to save Woody and Woody's realization that all toys
do not last forever.
   Unlike a lot of children's films, especially The Adventures of Elmo in
Grouchland, Toy Story 2 does not try to teach a sentimental lesson.  There are
some underlying issues, like friendship and the life span of a toy, but in the
end, Toy Story 2 just tries to entertain us and does a terrific job of it.  The
script is very clever and despite being aimed towards children, adults will
have no choice but to laugh at this wonderful film.
   The original Toy Story was revolutionary, but was not always consistently
funny.  Toy Story 2, on the other hand, is funny and witty throughout all of
the one hour and twenty-five minutes.  For one stretch of the film, Buzz, Hamm,
Rex and Mr. Potato Head are in Al's Toy Store and this is arguably the best
stretch of the film as the quartet interacts with a whole new set of toys,
including Barbie, Rock 'Em-Sock 'Em Robots and the new and improved Buzz
Lightyear.  As said before, the film will appeal to adults, as well as
children, and Pixar accomplishes this without keeping the kids in the dark. 
For instance, one scene has Rex chasing his pals who are driving in a car.  To
the children, it just looks like a silly scene.  To the older audience members,
it is a very clever spoof of Jurassic Park, as Mr. Potato Head checks his
rear-view mirror to see the on-charging dinosaud, just like Jurassic Park.
   In the end, Toy Story 2 cannot help but let you leave with a smile on your
face.  Instead of suscepting to the sequel curse and using stupid humor, Toy
Story 2 improves upon the original and will have you talking about it for days
on end.  The tagline for Toy Story 2 is "The Toys are Back in Town" and if we
are lucky, they will make a few more visits before packing it in for good.

This is one of the most funny and entertaining comedies of the year and it
just happens to be animated. There are some great voice over commentaries
from Hollywood's most famous celebrities, some fabulous animation and a
compelling story. This is the best we've seen from Disney since "Beauty and
the Beast" (1996).
This film begins an unspecified time following the happily-ever-after
conclusion to Toy Story. In the aftermath of their earlier adventures, Buzz
(voice of Tim Allen) and Woody (voice of Tom Hanks) are now fast friends and
all the toys live in perfect harmony, content with their "lives". One day,
Andy broke Woody's arm off, while playing with him. Woody is now officially
discarged and worthless, left with his
nightmares, where he lies in a trash can with the other discards.
Later Andy's mother decides to have a yard sale, and she collects a few old
toys
from her son's room. Since one of these discards is a member of the moving
toy gang, Woody goes to the rescue, leaving the safety of the house for the
uncertainty of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back. Although his
mission is successful, he is placed in a serious predicament when a toy
collector
named Al (voice of Wayne Knight) spies Woody while hunting through the wares
available at the sale. The cowboy toy represents the final collectible
needed to complete his collection of merchandise from the old TV series,
"Woody's Roundup." If he can acquire Woody, Al can ship everything to a toy
museum in Japan for a huge profit. So, after Andy's mother refuses to sell
the wooden cowboy, Al steals him, and it's up to the other toys, led by
Buzz, to go into the city to save their friend. And so,  Buzz, Rex (voice of
Wallace Shawn), Hamm (voice of John Ratzenberger), Mr. Potatohead (voice of
Don Rickles), and Slinky (voice of Jim Varney), go out on a dangerous
journey to rescue their friend, they find themselves confronting things like
busy streets and other Buzz Lightyear toys. There are car chases, gun fights
and finally the confrontation between Buzz and his Nemesis (who, by the way,
resembles Darth Vader). Meanwhile, Woody learns that he was once a TV
celebrity and has a family - a cowgirl named Jessie (voice of Joan Cusack),
a horse named Bullseye, and a father figure called the Prospector (voice of
Kelsey Grammar). They offer him another life, as a celebrity -- a toy in a
museum in Japan. He is now forced to choose between being loved intensively
by Andy for a little while (before he grows up) and be forgotten, or be
admired by children for generations. The problem is, if Woody escapes from
Al's clutches and returns home, they will end up back in the lonely darkness
of storage.
A real effort is made in the technical department. The animation is rich and
colorful, with lots of wonderful details. The "cinematography" is also
extremely improved since Toy Story; there are a lot of complicated swings,
turns and close-ups that really make an impression. Lighting and filters are
used to create a mood (as in a surprisingly emotional moment - Jessie's
remembrance of her days when she was a beloved toy) The film contains a lot
of in-side jokes (such as the one about videogames), and entertaining
parodies on "Jurassic Park" and "Star Wars". The film ends with the "failed
takes", the kind of scenes that we are used to see after comedy shows on TV.
These outtakes are some of the funniest scenes in the film. But what in the
end makes "Toy Story 2" a memorable experience is not the jokes, its
multiple parodies or marvelous animation. It is its heart and emotions --
the story about the meaning of friendship, love and even life itself. It is
not difficult to predict that "Toy Story 2" would be a huge economical
success, but its artistic achievement was unexpected. Unexpected because the
first film wasn't much more than a demonstration of special effects. But
mostly it was unexpected because Disney hasn't produced anything spectacular
in years and is constantly surpassed by companies such as DreamWorks and
Warner Brs. But here the director has changed the atmosphere of the film,
making it more accessible and interesting for persons older that 9 years.
This is a big step-away from the ancient laws of Disney-animation. Off
course, this is not "Antz" , it is not as intelligent; this is not a
landmark and no masterpiece, but I promise that you'll find it as funny and
enjoyable as I have. Whether this is the best animated film of the year, I
dare not say. My choice would probably be "The Iron Giant", but (along side
with "American Pie" ) this is the comedy of the year.
I almost lost my hopes for Disney, but "Toy Story 2" proves that Disney
hasn't lost their ability to entertain.

When Disney announced the production of a direct-to-video sequel to
Pixar's smash 1995 computer-animated feature _Toy_Story_, my expectations
weren't exactly set soaring.  The subsequent announcement that the
project was going so well that the Mouse decided to give it a big-screen
release didn't instill any new faith.  After all, this was Disney, who
never passed up an opportunity to soil the memory of a beloved animated
feature with a truly atrocious, completely unnecessary sequel.  Ever see
_The_Lion_King_II:_Simba's_Pride_?  Or the even more blasphemous
_Beauty_and_the_Beast:_The_Enchanted_Christmas_?  Consider yourself
incredibly lucky if you haven't.
So it was that greater of a shock--and an extremely pleasurable one at
that--to discover that _Toy_Story_2_ not only equals, but bests the
classic original film.  I had thought that the first _Toy_Story_ had
completely exhausted all the ideas for its cast of toy characters.  After
all, by film's end, the film's clever conceit that astronaut action
figure Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) believed he was an actual
Space Ranger was resolved, and he and rival for owner Andy's affections,
pull-string cowboy Woody (Tom Hanks) had mended fences.  Having done all
that with an Oscar-nominated blend of all-ages humor and grown-up
intelligence, where else could director John Lasseter go with the story?
As it turns out, many different--and more complex--places.  On one
level, _Toy_Story_2_ is a witty knock on the ever-growing toy collecting
market, where adults buy toys and never open them, keeping them for an
investment rather than their intended use as a child's plaything.  Woody
is stolen by a toy collector/toy store owner named Al (Wayne Knight) for
a hefty profit.  As it turns out, Woody is the main item in an old toy
line tied to a western-themed puppet television series called
_Woody's_Roundup_, and he reunites with the other members of his TV
family--cowgirl Jessie (Joan Cusack), horse Bullseye, and old prospector
Stinky Pete (Kelsey Grammer)--in Al's office.
Screenwriters Andrew Stanton, Rita Hsiao, Doug Chamberlin, and Chris
Webb also have deeper interests in mind.  Al, of course, intends to sell
the now-complete _Woody's_Roundup_ collection, an idea that Woody balks
at--he just wants to go home to Andy and his friends--but Jessie
wholeheartedly embraces.  Jessie, it is revealed, once had an owner, but
the owner abandoned her once she grew up.  Determined to not be
heartbroken again, Jessie wants to be loved and paid attention to
forever, even if it's from passing admirers looking through a glass case.
 This surprising crisis-of-existence theme--what's a toy to do once its
owner inevitably abandons it?--sounds a bit heady for a film with largely
kid appeal, but it's a tribute to the terrific writing that it's made
easily understandable for the young 'uns as well as the adults.  The
stunning example is the beautiful scene where Jessie tells her story
through the heartbreaking Randy Newman-penned, Sarah McLachlan-sung
ballad "When She Loved Me" (a lock for a Best Original Song Oscar nod
next year).
Despite all the richness of theme and emotion in _Toy_Story_2_, Lasseter
and co-director Lee Unkrich never forget what the film mainly is: a comic
adventure.  And there is plenty of comedy and adventure as Woody's toy
friends, led by Buzz, attempt a daring rescue of Woody from Al's toy
store.  That means a number of hilarious encounters with other toys,
including a perky Barbie (Jodi Benson, best known as Ariel from
_The_Little_Mermaid_) and, in a very clever touch, a fresh-from-the-box
Buzz Lightyear--who indeed believes himself to be a Space Ranger.
Augmenting all the fun of _Toy_Story_2_ is the amazing computer
animation.  A lot of advances have been made in the field since the
original film's release in 1995, and the visuals in the new film are
absolutely stunning--not to mention increasingly realistic.  Al's
skintone and hairy arms are remarkably lifelike, and Andy's dog is just
thisshy of looking exactly like the real thing.  What impressed me the
most, however, were the textures: the paint on metal surfaces, the
imperfect consistency of the human's (namely Al's) skin, the gravelly
road surface.  The detail is even more jawdropping when the film is seen
at one of the handful of theatres showing the film in crystalline DLP
all-digital projection.
It goes without saying that things work out for the best by the end of
_Toy_Story_2_, but this is one happy ending not without a tinge of the
bittersweet; Andy will eventually grow up, and all of his toys will find
themselves without a place to go.  But if there is a central moral to
_Toy_Story_2_, it's the old reliable "seize the day," and movie audiences
would best take that to heart and seize the opportunity to see one of the
brightest cinematic accomplishments to hit the silver screen this year.

Starring the voices of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Wayne Knight, Joan Cusack, Kelsey
Grammer, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Jim Varney, Don Rickles, Annie
Potts, Laurie Metcalf, John Morris and R Lee Ermey,
Prior to the showing of "Toy Story 2", a Pixar short from 1986 appears on the
big screen as an extra for coming to the theater. It is a very simple, basic
clip of two lamps playing with, and eventually popping, a plastic ball. The
short displays the origins of this outstanding computer generated genre and it
shows, after viewing "Toy Story 2", how far Pixar has progressed nearly 15
years later. The short is very satisfying even though it is a very ordinary
premise and because it was made the way it was made, it gives the feeling that
it was an experiment for something big in the future; A test to see if this
kind of animation is possible and is lasting. The viewing of the latest Pixar
flick proves that it is certainly lasting and, with the film's outstanding box
office success, it is certainly dominating.
"Toy Story 2" is a visual masterpiece. Every scene is wonderfully detailed from
a young boy's room, to an airport, to a vast toy store. The remarkable
detailing makes the film fun to watch and it gives the overwhelmingly
satisfying feeling that you must explore every image to really appreciate how
much hard work was put into it. What makes this sequel even more outstanding of
an accomplishment is that it remains as enjoyable as the original even though
the basic plot outline is exactly identical. Both films follow one character as
they struggle to identify who they are and where they belong. Also both films
follow a group of toys trying to rescue this troubled character from danger.
The overall message from this incredible series is that friendship lasts
forever, no matter how badly it is endangered. "Toy Story 2" starts out very
fast and from this point keeps you interested and vigilant. The opening scene
gives the adventures of Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) when he must face off, in a
pretend video game, against the evil Zurg, his arch nemesis. The action
presented here is very similar to the classic beginnings of "Raiders of the
Lost Arc" and, even more recently, "The Matrix" which leave a lasting
impression on the viewer throughout the whole movie. The opening scene of "Toy
Story 2" is definitely pleasing but it does not leave a lasting impression
because the action never stops after the video game. Immediately after, there
are a number of toys searching for Woody's (Tom Hanks) cowboy hat in a very
upbeat mood. The action never dies down, it just keeps coming at you from all
different directions. The animation helps this interminable action because it
creates a limitless atmosphere where anything can happen. 
"Toy Story 2" tells one story in the wild adventures of being a toy. Woody,
Andy's favorite toy, is stolen by a greedy toy store owner (Wayne Knight)
because Woody is supposedly a valuable antique during the pre-Sputnik days. It
is up to Buzz Lightyear and company to try to help Woody return safely home.
Every actor providing their unique voices in "Toy Story 2" seem to be having
fun. This is a good thing because "Toy Story 2" is trying to be a fun movie and
only a fun movie. Every character from the original reprises their role here
with the same playful animosity as before. The new characters added, such as
Jessie the cowgirl (Joan Cusack) and The Prospector (Kelsey Grammar) from
Woody's past, fit right in with the original cast. The most notable newcomers,
however, are two "Seinfeld" veterans, Estelle Harris and Wayne Knight. Both
fantastically bring their loud obnoxious characteristics into their
intentionally obnoxious roles. 
The only dull moment in "Toy Story 2" is an unnecessary musical number about
Jessie's past. It just seemed out of place from the quickly paced format of the
rest of the movie. However, this song was only a couple minutes long so it did
not hold the film back for too long. Another small irritation was the title of
the film. "Toy Story 2" is the easy way out of titling a sequel. I find it hard
to believe these imaginative geniuses could not think of a replacement title.
These are small complaints against a big movie. "Toy Story 2" is a great amount
of fun for all ages. Multiple viewings do not hurt the enjoyment of this movie
because you will discover new tributes to other movies such as "Star Wars",
"Jurassic Park", and the other Disney/Pixar film "A Bug's Life". This one
should not be missed.

If someone states as a Golden Rule that sequels are never as good as the
originals, the automatic response is usually "The Godfather Part II",
with references to The Empire Strikes Back, Star Trek II: The Wrath of
Khan, and Bride of Frankenstein held in reserve. Superior sequels are
pretty rare, but Toy Story 2 is perhaps the best example there is. For
while Toy Story 2 can't possibly carry the impact of its predecessor, it
is a better movie all round.
In the toys' second screen adventure, Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks)
discovers he is no ordinary cowboy toy but is a valuable collectible.
Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) has now recovered from his delusion that he
really is an intergalactic superhero but is still pretty heroic as he
and Woody's other friends try to rescue the cash cowboy from an evil
toy store owner trying to toynap Woody to complete his collection of
cowboy toys and sell him to a museum. 
Co-director John Lasseter, whose company Pixar made the Toy Story films,
has always been an animator who happened to use technology, rather than
a techno-nut dabbling at animation. This means that propeller-head gee-
whizzery never gets in the way of the requirements of traditional story-
telling - character and plot are everything, and instead of showing us
how clever they are, Lasseter and co-director Ash Brannon properly
concentrate on thrilling us and making us laugh. There have nevertheless
been significant technical advances in rendering software and sheer
computing brute strength over the last four years, and the level of
textural detail and naturalistic movement on show here is amazing.
Toy Story 2 was originally planned to have an undignified straight-to-
video release - the traditional route for animation feature sequels -
but the suits at Disney and Pixar decided it might be worth a shot at a
theatrical release. After the film's eighty-million-dollar opening
weekend, they were probably pretty pleased with themselves.
Although sometimes a bit syrupy, Toy Story 2 is very impressive
technically and, much more important, it's great fun. (8/10)

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Pixar's follow-up to 1995's hugely successful Toy Story is another
whopping cinematic victory, guaranteed to garner critical raves and
still make money hand-over-fist while packing theaters through this
holiday season.  The original, the third-highest-grossing animated film
ever (behind The Lion King and Aladdin) and the first full-length
computer-generated movie, made almost $200 million during its theatrical
run, catching Hollywood a bit off-guard.  This sequel even pokes fun at
the fact that unaware toy stores didn't stock enough of the film's
action figures the first time around.
For the few people that haven't seen the first film, it focused on a
group of toys owned by a six-year-old tyke named Andy Davis (voiced by
John Morris).  His favorite toy, a cowboy doll named Woody (Tom Hanks,
You've Got Mail), faced his greatest fear when Andy received a shiny new
Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen, Home Improvement) doll for his birthday.  A
jealous Woody hatched a plan to get rid of his cocky rival, but it
backfired, leaving the cowboy and his toy cohorts to perform a daring
rescue mission to return Buzz to their master.
Here, Woody, Buzz and the other toys all get along nicely, even playing
with Andy's dog, Buster, whom he received as a Christmas gift in Toy
Story's final scene.  As the film opens, we learn that Andy is about to
leave for Cowboy Camp and plans to take his trusty pal Woody along.  But
right before they leave, Woody's arm is partially torn, which not only
results in Andy leaving him behind, but also in his mother (Laurie
Metcalf, The Norm Show) relegating the damaged toy to a dusty shelf.
The ledge appears to be a home to toys that Andy has either grown out of
or has broken.
Long story short, Woody is taken by an unscrupulous toy collector (Wayne
Knight, Seinfeld), courtesy of Mrs. Davis' yard sale.  The graying,
balding pudge named Al recognizes Woody as a rare toy in near perfect
condition and plans to sell his find to a Japanese museum along with
three other figures he has previously collected from the `Woody's
Roundup' set - Jessie the Cowgirl (Joan Cusack, Arlington Road), Stinky
Pete the prospector (Kelsey Grammer, Frasier), and Bullseye the horse
(David Ogden Stiers, Two Guys, a Girl & a Pizza Place).
Having no idea that he was so valuable, a pragmatic Woody is faced with
the inevitable fact that Andy is growing older and will, at some point,
stop playing with toys.  He has to decide whether to go back to Andy and
the other toys, or lead a boring life of virtual immortality from a
glass case.  Plus, Woody has to factor in the guilt aspect  if he
ditches Jessie, Pete and Bullseye, they'll end up packed away in storage
boxes indefinitely, until Al can find another Woody-clone to complete
his sale.
Like the original film, Toy Story 2 is visually stunning, with CG images
so true-to-life that you can easily forget that you aren't watching a
live-action movie.  It features better and more realistic action
sequences than most films.  And like its predecessors (Toy Story and A
Bug's Life), this sequel seems to offer more jokes for adults than kids,
spoofing Jurassic Park and Star Wars, among others. In fact, I'm not
even sure that kids will grasp the whole concept of collecting old toys,
or appreciate Al's videotapes of the hokey 50s television show that
featured Woody and his pals.
Created by the same team of writers and directors that made both Toy
Story and A Bug's Life, this new film seems to be filled with more
emotional moments than either of its predecessors.  The conflict Woody
feels is more real than what we're used to seeing in films, and there is
also an oddly effective Sarah MacLachlan song (her second weepy number
this month after Anywhere But Here) about Jessie's former owner ditching
the cowgirl for a life of makeup and boys.  Again, this will likely be
more effective for adults than children.  And, after Pokémon, is that
such a bad thing?

1999 has been a stellar year for animation, bringing viewers the
exhilarating and heart warming adventure, "The Iron Giant," Disney's
kinetic version of "Tarzan," the outrageous "South Park: Bigger,
Longer and Uncut" and the American release of the Japanese epic,
"Princess Mononoke." To cap off this surfeit of riches, we now have
"Toy Story 2," a terrific sequel to the smash 1995 story about the
private lives of toys.
The original "Toy Story" initially drew a great deal of attention for
being the first totally computer animated film, then became an instant
classic because it was a marvel of warm, clever storytelling. "Toy
Story 2" does its parent proud, delivering 92 minutes of smart, zippy
entertainment. The characters are even better defined than in the
original, the action is fast and furious and there are loads of laughs
in this remarkably inventive movie.
Director John Lasseter and his associates at Pixar clearly understand
what makes for a winning sequel. They touch on treasured moments from
the original without repeating them, and allow the characters to grow,
while retaining the qualities that made us love them in the first
place. "Toy Story 2" is that rarest of birds; a sequel as good as (and
some will argue, better than) the original.
As with the first film, the story is deceptively simple. While young
Andy is away at camp, his cherished cowboy doll Woody (Tom Hanks) gets
stolen by a toy collector (Wayne Knight, nicely portraying the greedy
mindset of those who hoard toys for their investment potential). A
rescue team is quickly organized and action figure Buzz Lightyear (Tim
Allen), Rex the dinosaur (Wallace Shawn), Hamm the piggy bank (John
Ratzenberger), Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), and Slinky Dog (Jim
Varney) hit the city streets to save their friend.
While stashed away, Woody learns of his illustrious history and has a
crisis of conscience. Seems he was a TV celebrity in the '50s,
starring in a "Howdy Doody" style puppet show, and has an extended
family from the glory days: spunky cowgirl Jessie (Joan Cusack),
Bullseye the horse, and Stinky Pete the Prospector (Kelsey
Grammar). Jesse pleads with Woody to stay; explaining that if he
escapes, she will be put back into storage, the purgatory for
neglected toys.
The story contains an amazing number of riotous set pieces, none of
which I will reveal here. Suffice to say that everything satisfying
from the original returns with clever twists, and the new additions to
the family of toys are most welcome.
In this cavalcade of delights, I have only two minor
criticisms. First, both films would have been better served by keeping
the human characters offscreen (as the adults were handled in the
various "Peanuts" TV shows). While great strides have been made in
computer animation, they still can't create convincing humans and the
presence of partially realized people is distracting. Second, as with
Pixar's "A Bug's Life," the latter portion of "Toy Story 2" gets a
little busy. In their quest to satisfy the audience, the filmmakers
try a bit too hard and the pace becomes needlessly frenetic. The folks
at Pixar need to realize that they are working with magic here and
with magic, simplicity is the key.
I want to stress that these are minor quibbles. "Toy Story 2" is a
triumph, blending bright, eye-popping animation, exceptional work from
its voice talent and wildly imaginative writing (peppered with
hilarious pop culture references) to create one of the best films of
the year. Those who dismiss the movie as "kid's stuff" are doing
themselves a disservice. Like the original, "Toy Story 2" is a
treasure for everyone.

       I suppose an argument could be made that Toy Story is one of
       those films that didn't need a sequel. Beloved by kids and
       their parents, respected equally by mainstream America and
       geekish movie buffs, that first movie remains a landmark of
       recent history, the one that burst open the possibilities of
       computer animation and demonstrated through wild invention
       and giddy chutzpah just how complacent the Disney animation
       machine had become in cranking out fluffy razzle-dazzle
       entertainment full of formula storytelling and banal
       songwriting.
       As someone who doesn't believe sequels are necessarily a bad
       thing (granted, they usually are a bad thing, but that's
       because they're made for the wrong reasons), I had to wonder
       what in the world they were thinking. Fortunately, Disney
       claimed to have been so knocked-out by early animation tests
       that they let Pixar go full-speed ahead with a theatrical
       sequel. Lucky thing, too -- like the first movie, this one is
       a joy to behold on the big screen, and technically, it
       improves on its predecessor on just about every level. (From
       a business standpoint, the end credits show that the new
       creations are copyrighted by Pixar, while the previous film's
       elements are shared between Pixar and Disney, a sign of the
       production house's new cachet in Hollywood.)
       Visually, the main shortcoming of this fully
       computer-generated movie is that human figures are still
       rendered relatively poorly, making them look a little creepy.
       Fortunately, that eerie unreality fits in perfectly with the
       perspective of the movie, where the secret world of toys is
       more immediate, and arguably more attractive, than the world
       of the humans who surround them.
       Sheriff Woody (voiced by a note-perfect Tom Hanks), the
       longtime favorite among Andy's toys who was challenged in the
       previous go-round by the arrival of flashy-new-thing action
       figure Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), suffers an injury early in
       the film, when Andy tugs too hard on his arm and pulls a seam
       apart, revealing the stuffing inside. This accident catalyzes
       some uneasieness among the toys, who know too well that a
       broken toy is often a forgotten toy, and a forgotten toy is
       one that loses its reason for existence.
       That this film manages to turn a box marked "25 cents" into a
       symbol of doom, or to make its screed against the retention
       of collectible toys by wrongheaded profiteers fuel for a
       metaphysical dilemma, is a testament to its skill at
       metaphor, seamlessly translating the hopes and fears of our
       real world into that of the toys. Operating on this level of
       abstraction, Toy Story 2 tackles some mighty heavy issues
       without once preaching or veering into pretentiousness. (The
       worst I can say is that Randy Newman seems to have reserved
       his sappiest lyric in years for Sarah McLachlan, who stops
       the movie cold by singing it at just about the halfway mark.)
       Sometimes I think Toy Story 2 tries too hard. There's
       somewhat less of the seat-of-the-pants loopiness that
       energized the first film, allowing it to surprise and excite
       on a near-constant basis, and more philosophizing about toys,
       collectors, the nature of happiness and the meaning of life.
       While that leads to fewer bellylaughs, it does make way for
       more elaborate humor and an uncommonly ambitious reflexivity
       that asks the toys to consider their own status as
       commodities that move in and out of fashion. (Just don't ask
       why Andy's favorite toy is based on a TV series that was
       canceled in 1957.)
       Where else in mainstream movies do you get such an awesome
       moment as the one where Buzz arrives at Al's Toy Barn to find
       it stocked to the gills with his doppelgangers, Buzz
       Lightyear action figures? Forget the self-congratulatory
       science fiction of The Matrix -- this is a fundamental
       mind-bender for Buzz, and the audience shares his humility
       and wonderment at the sight. Here, as in the roughly
       concurrent scene where Woody watches tapes of the Howdy
       Doodyish children's TV show that originated his character, we
       see our protagonists come face-to-face with God.

In a Hollywood culture that tries again and again to (in William
Goldman's words) to recapture past magic, Toy Story 2 was, perhaps,
inevitable.  Few movies have been as magical, as original, as
groundbreaking as the first Toy Story.  The sheer technical wizardry of
John Lasseter and the Pixar team, the sterling voice talent, the
inimitable Randy Newman soundtrack, the charm of the characters and the
sheer ingenuity of the story combined to create a truly astonishing
piece of work.
And, of course, Toy Story was a truly profitable piece of work, all but
guaranteeing a sequel.  And as a sequel, Toy Story 2 labors under some
disadvantages.  The first Toy Story sent a high standard for technical
excellence that the sequel must equal or better.  The audience would
expect to see new things, meaning that much more of the story would have
to take place outside of Andy's room.  New characters would have to
appear, including a new villain.  The Buzz Lightyear character -- whose
grandiose, deluded personality was so central to the first movie --
would have to be reexamined.  The friendship between Buzz and Woody the
Cowboy would have to be as interesting as their rivalry was.  And so
forth.
Toy Story 2 tries very hard to overcome these disadvantages and
generally succeds.  On a technical level, the movie is an overwhelming
success.  The "sets" (for want of a better word) are nothing short of
spectacular, especially in the final action sequences.  Trees spread in
green canopies, with every leaf digitally rendered.  A scene where Woody
must navigate a minefield of cheese doodles shows every doodle in
astonishing detail.  One scene, where the toys use a remote control to
click through an infinity of cable channels, practically begs for close
frame-by-frame analysis.  The wizards at Pixar have done it again.
As far as the characterization goes, Toy Story is fortunate to have a
large ensemble cast of familiar voice talent that needs little
introduction.  (The first Toy Story had a wide range of toys doing many
different things; the sequel has fewer toys doing more things, which
more or less evens out.)  Even the villains are familiar, with Wayne
Knight voicing the geeky toy collector, and Kelsey Grammer reprising his
Sideshow Bob role from "The Simpsons".  The only real new character is
Joan Cusack as a spunky cowgirl with a heart of gold -- who has the
movie's heartrending moment, complete with the superlative voice of
Sarah
McLachlan.singing "When She Loved Me".  (Which should finally get Randy
Newman an Oscar, by the way, and it's about time, too.)
Tom Hanks has the lead role of Woody the Cowboy, and it's hard enough
imagining anyone doing a better job.  Hanks has taken so many serious
roles lately that having him play a role that reminds of the comic,
childish side he sow famously showcased in Big is a real treat.  (Hanks
even gets to sing "You've Got A Friend in Me" from the first movie.)
Tim Allen has the less showy role this time, but the story allows him to
relapse into the old Buzz Lightyear persona from time to time, which is
a hoot.
The problem with Toy Story 2, however, is that it doesn't have the same
interplay between Hanks and Allen that was the source for much of the
humor in the original movie.  To compensate, Toy Story 2 is packed
instead with references and allusions to other movies.  Sometimes this
works.  The Jurassic Park reference is a scream, and there's a combined
reference to The Empire Strikes Back and Field of Dreams that's very
funny.  Sometimes it doesn't work.  The whole last half of the movie, at
times, plays like a retread of the first two Die Hard movies.  Overall,
the pop-culture references are neat, and they serve to keep parents
interested (in much the same way that Robin WIlliams did in Aladdin).
But the constant gags seem to indicate a lack of trust in the Toy Story
source material, and a lack of originality in the storytelling.
The ultimate question with Toy Story 2, I suppose, is whether it
succeeds in its mission to recapture the past magic of the orginal.  It
succeeds spectacularly on the technical side -- a a credit to Team Pixar
and their technological bag of tricks.  However, the story of Toy Story
2 isn't as strong (though it has its compensations).  Toy Story 2 isn't
a great, groundbreaking picture by any means, but it does its best to
cultivate the ground broken by Toy Story, and that is enough.

"Toy Story 2" is a masterpiece on every level - on its own terms, it is one of
the finest films I have ever seen. Crafted with tender care by Disney
subsidiary Pixar (who also brought us the original "Toy Story" and last year's
"A Bug's Life"), the film personifies great family entertainment, appealing to
kids, teens, and adults alike. Unlike so many lesser films that try to throw in
mild double entendres and in-jokes to keep the over thirteen set in the crowd
awake, however, "Toy Story 2" communicates exclusively to children, all of
them, including the one locked up in even the most hardened adult. It fits the
old "It's great for kids from ages one to one hundred" cliché' like a glove. I
loved this movie - it's so clean, so beautiful, so full of heart and child-like
wonder. There is something simultaneously cute, funny, haunting, and sad about
seeing the world through the eyes of a toy - and the angle is exploited
beautifully. 
The film was a lot different than I expected. It's been quite a while since
I've seen the original "Toy Story," and I remember little about it beyond that
I liked it quite a bit. After almost literal universal acclaim (it is one of
the few films to get a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes' tatometer), I expected quite a
bit from its sequel, thinking it would simultaneously juggle humor and themes
for kids and adults respectively. It ended up being even better than I thought
it would be, although in a very different way. Instead of appealing to me as an
adult (or, in my case, a teenager), it brought me down to the level of a child.
I rarely see such strong feelings of joy, wonder, and sweet innocence projected
on the screen, and I couldn't help but get caught up in it. For ninety brief
but wonderful minutes, my age changed from fifteen to five.
The story is something of a retread of the original, but it doesn't really
matter. Woody (voice of Tom Hanks) is stolen by evil toy store owner Al
McWhiggin (voice of Wayne Night) while trying to save a comrade from being
purchased during a family garage sale. He is brought back to Al's apartment,
and finds himself as the centerpiece of a "Woody's Roundup" memorabilia
collection. "Woody's Roundup," as it turns out, was an old black and white
television series in which Woody's persona was the star. Al is planning to sell
his collection to a Japanese toy museum, but they won't take it without a Woody
doll. Now that he has one, he plans to proceed and make a killing.
Woody doesn't like the idea, of course, and immediately makes plans to escape.
He is hindered, however, by Jessie (voice of Joan Cusack) and Stinky Pete
(voice of Kelsey Grammer), two other members of the collection that have stayed
in storage for years waiting for Woody. They don't want to spend any longer
packed up in a box, and do everything in their power to convince him to stay.
In the meantime, Buzz Lightyear (voice of Tim Allen), with the help of Mr.
Potato Head (voice of Don Rickles), Rex (voice of Wallace Shawn), Hamm (voice
of John Ratzenberger), and Slinky Dog (voice of Jim Varney) launches a rescue
mission. 
Woody does his best to explain to his new friends why he has to leave; his
owner, Andy (voice of John Morris) needs him. They're always together, and
Woody couldn't live with himself if seperated from his best friend. In one of
the most beautiful and powerful sequences that I have ever seen, Jessie tells
the story of her owner growing up and letting her go for big-girl things like
makeup and boys. The story is told in a (for once seamlessly integrated) song
that details their special relationship. Jessie's owner took her everywhere,
did everything with her - she was the girl's constant companion, her confidant.
As the girl grows older, she stars to lose interest and ultimately sticks
Jessie under her bed. After years of waiting, Jessie, thinking that their
constant companionship is about to resume, is retrieved by her owner, driven by
a tire swing that they used to play on years ago, and given to Good Will. The
sequence is brilliant, executed with genuineness, subtlety, and grace. It
almost moved me to tears.
This brings Woody to the realization that Andy will soon grow old and give him
up ("Do you actually think that Andy will take you to college, on his
honeymoon?!" asks Jessie). Woody is infuriated at first, and initially refuses
to return home when Buzz and company come for him. After much soul-searching,
he changes his mind, deciding that, even though he won't be with Andy after he
grows up, he wouldn't miss the experience of watching him for anything in the
world. What a sweet, wonderful, powerful film.

         Looking back over the dozens of movie sequels released in the
past 15 years, you'll find an extraordinarily high ratio of junk to
quality, as well as a lot of pictures which never should have been made
in the first place. Was there really an audience out there demanding
"The Karate Kid 4," "Species 2," "The Cannonball Run II," "Porky's
Revenge" or "Return to the Blue Lagoon"? If so, you couldn't prove it by
the box office receipts on any of these fiascoes.
 But it's safe to say a fair amount of the moviegoing public
will be interested in the further adventures of Woody the cowboy doll
and Buzz Lightyear, the stoic and slightly pompous action figure, the
characters who enchanted audiences of all ages in "Toy Story" four years
ago. Happily, "Toy Story 2" is a truly worthwhile follow-up, a
technically dazzling movie which delivers on both the action and comedy
fronts, yet still doesn't lose sight of its heart.
 Hollywood has two schools of sequels: the ones which are merely
louder, flashier repetitions of bits that worked before (for instance,
the wholly unnecessary "Lethal Weapon 4"); or the second installments
which try to probe the darker sides of the characters (as in "Babe: Pig
in the City" or the ultra-downbeat "Back to the Future, Part 2"). But
director John Lasseter has seen to it "Toy Story 2" doesn't fall into
either category. You need not have seen the original to enjoy this
adventure, although if you saw this one first, you would probably be
inspired to rush to the video store to grab a copy of the first movie.
 All the familiar voices of "Toy Story" are back, including Tom
Hanks as Woody (who's faced with a daunting moral dilemma this time
around), Tim Allen as Buzz, Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, John
Ratzenberger as Ham the piggy bank, Jim Varney as the Slinky Dog and
Annie Potts -- too briefly -- as the saucy Bo Peep. They're joined by
new additions Joan Cusack as Jessie the Yodelin' Cowgirl and Kelsey
Grammer as a prospector doll with the unenviable name of Stinky Pete.
You couldn't ask for a brighter array of vocal talent, and the
screenplay gives them a surplus of good lines to deliver.
 Picking up a couple of years after the original left off, "2"
finds Woody in the hands of unscrupulous toy dealer Al (Wayne Knight)
after a mix-up at a yard sale. The tireless Buzz leads Rex, Hamm, Slinky
Dog and Potato Head -- who has packed his "angry eyes" just in case he
needs them -- on a journey to Al's Toy Barn megastore, but that turns
out to be just the beginning of a wild and woolly yarn that manages to
address some bittersweet truths about friendship, sacrifice and growing
up, while still providing a steady stream of jokes and exciting moments.
         "Toy Story 2" prominently features some hilarious parodies
(including an opening sequence with Buzz which brilliantly blends
together "2001: A Space Odyssey," "Star Wars," "Tron" and "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind") and sassy asides, such as when Tour Guide
Barbie (Jodi Benson), while showing off the aisles of Al's Toy Barn to
guests, notes of the Buzz Lightyear figures on the shelves "back in
1995, short-sighted retailers did not order enough to meet demand."
 Like its predecessor, "Toy Story 2" builds to a series of
increasingly tense climaxes, only pausing along the way to welcome back
those sycophantic Martian dolls who've now stopped worshipping "the
claw" and have found instead an unlikely new deity. There's a surprising
amount of suspense in the movie's last 15 minutes, which is so
splendidly handled it should have viewers young and old teetering on the
edges of their seats. A friend recently told me he considers "Toy Story
2" to be "The Godfather, Part 2" of animated movies; he may very well be
right. James Sanford

Metcalf, John Morris.
In 1995 a 30m dollar Disney CGI animated movie came out, and blew away
movie-goers everywhere. That little movie became a huge movie which grossed
little less than 200m, that movie was "Toy Story". Now four years later, Disney
blesses us with another adventure of the toys in Andy's room. This time around
the budget is three times as big and the adventure is twice as it was before.
Of course we all fell in love with the toys in the first; Woody the cowboy,
Buzz the spaceman, Rex the dinosaur, Slinky the slinkydog , Mr. Potato Head,
and Ham the piggy bank. Well in "Toy Story 2" all the toys return and are
delightful as ever that puts a smile on our face and makes our stomachs hurt
from laughing so hard.
"Toy Story 2" starts out with Buzz fighting Zurg, the evil emperor of course we
then see Rex playing the video game, and Buzz trying to give him tips to win.
We are then in Andy's room a regular boy with high hopes and lots of toys.
Woody (Voiced by Tim Allen) is Andy's favorite toy whom Andy plays with the
most. Of course he plays with his other toys, Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), Rex
(Wallace Shawn), Slinkydog (Jim Varney) , Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) and Ham
(John Ratzenberger). Woody is prepared to go to cowboy camp with Andy but
before they get ready to go, Andy accidentally rips Woody's arm and Andy's mom
(Laurie Metcalf) puts him on the shelve to all the toys dismay. Woody realizes
that he is now shelved and will never be seen again. Meanwhile Andy's mom is
having a yard sale and selling old toys, Woody finds one of the toys they
thought they would never find again and tries to rescue him from the box. He
jumps in and gets him to the house thanks to the help from Buster the dog, but
Woody falls and is picked up by Al (Wayne Knight). Andy's mom tells him that
Woody is not for sale, but he steals him and takes him to his house.
There Woody meets three other toys, Jesse (Joan Cusack) a cowgirl, Bullseye a
very shy and funny horse and The Prospector (Kelsey Grammar). They tell Woody
that the reason he was kidnapped was because he was part of an old black and
white TV show to which would make him worth a lot of moolah today. If Al has
the whole set he could sell them and make a lot of money. The other toys come
to Woody's rescue and try and get him back to Andy before Andy gets home, but
realize Woody may not want to come home, leading to a finale that leaves you
breathless both because of the amazing eye candy and because of the amazing DTS
(Digital Surround Sound). 
I would have to definitely say that "Toy Story 2" may have surpassed it's
predessecor in many ways: Its three times as funny, had more adventure, a great
plotline and new great characters. Don't get me wrong though, I thought the
first was a terrific movie, but in that rare sequel thing "Toy Story 2" may be
better. This time around you knew everything about the characters therefore
they went right into the plot in the first fifteen minutes. There was never a
dull moment, a dumb moment or a slow moment. The movie constantly went on and
really never stopped. At times I laughed so hard that my side and stomach were
killing me. The animations was terrific and actually almost looked better than
the original. This time we have a lot more people and a lot more toys.
Some of the greatest moments include Woody trying to get his arm, Buzz and the
toys trying to get across the street, and Buzz and the toys visiting the Barbie
section. In fact every sequence in this movie was great. I think also that kids
and adults alike will love this movie. There is nothing offensive and it's very
good-natured with a few embedded messages to kids. There is of course like the
first humor that will hit kids hard, and humor that will fly over the kids
heads. Parents however will not dislike or find this humor anyway offensive.
It is safe to say "Toy Story 2" is Disney's newest masterpiece and offers to
much stuff in 83 minutes, that this review cannot even begin to tell how good
it is. The thing you have to do is see it yourself. One thing is if you haven't
seen the original I wouldn't suggest seeing this because of the fact that there
is a lot of stuff going back to the first, as well as some homages to classic
films such as "Star Wars" and "Jurassic Park". From the opening titles to the
end titles everyone in the theatre I was with was having a good time and we all
walked out of there with a huge smile on our faces with our sides hurting.
The thing "Toy Story 2" proves is that like "The Lion King 2: Simba's Price"
Disney can make sequels that are just as good if not better than the originals.
Unlike "Return of Jafar" and "Aladdin and The King of Thieves" "Toy Story 2" is
a smart, clever, hilarious and fun-filled animated movie that may be the best
since "The Little Mermaid". In other words "Toy Story 2" is outstanding,
fantastic, incredible, awesome and an instant classic. Cheers to Disney and
lets hope "Toy Story 3" isn't that far away.

Most sequels don't do what they're supposed to do like "Toy Story 2" does.
Far too many of them end up re-hashing the original and adding very little.
Is it any wonder that most sequels fail to live up to their predecessors?
Thankfully, "Toy Story 2" is a wonderful exception. I can't remember the
last time I saw a sequel as consistently fun and inventive as this one. It's
yet another sign that Pixar, the acclaimed animation studio behind "Toy
Story" and "A Bug's Life," is still at the top of its game.
Woody and Buzz are back in the sequel to the 1995 hit "Toy Story," and
things have changed a bit since the last one ended. Woody (voiced by Tom
Hanks) is preparing to leave with his owner Andy for cowboy camp. In his
absence, he has assigned Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), now comfortable in his
role as a toy, to take charge. Unfortunately, Woody's trip is ruined when he
is accidentally put into the family garage sale, and is stolen by an
over-zealous toy collector (Wayne Knight). Off to save him are Buzz and
members of the old "toy gang," including Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Rex
the nervous dinosaur (Wallace Shawn), Hamm the piggy bank (John
Ratzenberger), and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney). While in captivity, Woody makes
a startling discovery: he is actually part of a collection of toys based on
a 1950's children's show entitled "Woody's Roundup." He meets the show's
other characters, which include Jesse (Joan Cusack), his cowgirl sidekick,
the wise old Prospector (Kelsey Grammer), and Bullseye, his trusty horse.
They have all been anxiously awaiting Woody's arrival, as once their set is
completed, they will be sold to a Japanese toy museum, and finally escape
storage forever. This means Woody now faces a difficult choice. With his
friends coming to rescue him, does he go with them and spend a few more
years with Andy, or does he go to Japan and be immortalized forever?
As in the original film, "Toy Story 2" contains first-rate animation, and
Pixar Studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work
they did there. Reportedly, the film was originally slated for a
direct-to-video release, but after seeing the improvements that had been
made, Disney rightly decided to release it into theaters. The film is well
worth seeing on the big screen. The colors are bright, the textures sharp,
and even the human characters look more "human." The animation is
consistently seamless, with the action fast and furious and the facial
expressions believable. There are so many impressive sequences that I'd find
it impossible to list them here, but I was particularly wowed by a scene
where Buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to Al'
s Toy Barn, the store owned by Woody's captor. Pixar's rendition of the
family dog is also nicely done, with fur so realistic you almost feel you
could reach out and touch it.
The voice work is also perfectly complementary, and as with the first movie,
does much to help further character development. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen
again disappear into their roles as Woody and Buzz, making you forget who is
doing the voice. It was Woody and Buzz up there, not Tom and Tim. All the
cast members from the original reprise their roles, and each is excellent.
Several new voices have been added, with Joan Cusack, Kelsey Grammer, and
Wayne Knight doing fine work. "Toy Story 2" is strong in characterization,
and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie. Woody faces
difficult choices, while Buzz is confronted with a new Buzz who hasn't yet
realized his status as a toy, forcing him to see what he used to be like.
The new characters are also developed quite well, especially Jesse, who
narrates a Sarah McLachlan-aided flashback illustrating how she was loved,
then forgotten by her owner. It may be computer-animated, and it may have
sappy music, but it's downright touching.
The script, despite having a story and screenplay each credited to four
different writers, is endlessly clever and inventive, especially considering
that it's a sequel. The reason "Toy Story 2" works where other movie sequels
fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the original's success by
re-doing the same story and using the same characters. Not this one. We get
character change, new characters, and new issues brought up. "Toy Story 2"
is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself. There
is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here. The humor
is sharp and witty, with something to amuse both kids and adults. There are
funny asides to films such as "Star Wars" and "Jurassic Park," among others,
new takes on classic toys like Barbie and Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots, and
appearances from other Pixar efforts "A Bug's Life" and the 1997 short "Geri
's Game." (Geri himself makes an appearance as a toy repairman who fixes
Woody's broken arm.) The action is fast and furious, and the chases (in the
street, in a toy store, in an elevator, on a baggage carousel, and in an
airplane) keep getting bigger and better. "Toy Story 2" never grows
stagnant, because there is always something new to hold your interest. The
more you pay attention to it, the more rewarding it is.
It's rare to see a film like "Toy Story 2" come along, because it's the kind
of film that's almost impossible to dislike. It's created purely to
entertain, and though I enjoy a thought-provoking drama as much as the next
person, it's nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what
movies first tried to do: send us out with a smile. It's a fair bet that the
whole family will have smiles on their collective faces after seeing "Toy
Story 2." It's the rare sequel that manages to expand on, and live up to,
the original.

DIRECTOR:  John Lasseter (co-directed by Ash Brannon & Lee Unkrich)
WRITTEN BY:  John Lasseter, Peter Docter, Ash Brannon, Andrew Stanton
Way back in 1995 (just slightly more recent than the Dark Ages in
computer-graphics terms), Pixar Animation Studios unveiled the first Toy
Story.  It was a technological and visual wonder, the first-ever
completely computer animated feature film.  More importantly to
distributor Disney, it became the third-highest grossing animated movie
ever.  Four years later, we have George Lucas pioneering the idea of
"Synthespians" with a certain floppy-eared pariah.  Fortunately, we also
have Toy Story 2, that rarest of sequels that outranks the original in
every way (except, of course, originality, but in this case that's no
big deal.)
This time, Buzz Lightyear has to lead his owner Andy's other toys on a
danger-fraught adventure to rescue the old cowboy doll Woody, who has
inadvertently fallen into the greedy clutches of a toy collector.  The
plot thickens when Woody meets the other members of his 'complete set'
(including a felt horse, a feisty cowgirl, and Stinky Pete, a grizzled
old prospector still mint in the box) in the collector's office and
realizes he's a valuable part of toy history.  Woody has to choose
either his owner and friends, or a permanent place of honor in a
Japanese museum with his new family.
While the resolution of this dilemma may be somewhat more obvious to
older audience members than kids, getting there is no less fun.  The
movie is liberally sprinkled with clever in-jokes (the chess-playing
geezer from Pixar's Oscar-winning short 'Geri's Game' shows up in a
cameo), referential gags (post-Sputnik 'space toys' are derided, and the
riffs on Star Wars happen early and often), and hilarious one-liners
that will fly right over the heads of the sprogs while getting big
laughs from their parents.  Better still, Disney's recent trend away
from musical numbers has left Toy Story 2 with only two:  a lovely but
depressing Sarah McLachlan tear-jerker and a rehash of Randy Newman's
"You've Got A Friend In Me" from the first film.  In both cases, the
songs become critical plot points instead of momentum-killing
distractions.  Obviously, the computer graphics are much improved (check
out the trees and the family dog's highly realistic coat), but the truly
remarkable achievement is that after a while, you stop noticing them and
focus instead on the characters.  Much of the first film's look-at-me
graphic wizardry has evolved into more stylish and effective imagery.
Like the French impressionists they subtly mention in the film, Pixar's
army of programmers, animators, and renderers may one day be regarded as
the first and finest examples of a new kind of artist.
One quickly gets the sense watching this movie that Lasseter and his
gang have never stopped playing with their toys.  In their world, a toy
doesn't come to life until a child plays with it.  Collectors, with
their glass displays and hermetically sealed imaginations, are the
enemy.  In the real world of eBay bidding wars and Pokemon extortion,
that's a fine message indeed, and Toy Story 2 delivers it with matchless
creativity and invention.  It'll make you wonder whether all those toys
you loved as a kid miss you as much as you miss them.

Review:  `To infinity and beyond!!'
In 1995, Disney released a Pixar computer animated production, TOY STORY, a
***** film that went on to gross over $192 million domestically, and earn a
special Academy Award for director John Lasseter.  Three years later, Pixar
released A BUG'S LIFE, which pushed the limits of computer animation even
further, and it grossed over $140 million domestically.  Now, just in time for
TOY STORY's fourth anniversary (Happy anniversary!), Disney has released
Pixar's latest productionTOY STORY 2!  This is a big step up for Disney,
especially since all their sequels have gone straight-to-video.  This was a
money making way since their first sequel, THE RESCUERS DOWN UNDER, did only
modest business at the box office.  Never before has Disney released another
animated film sequel theatrically, until now.  Speaking of which, this
production was originally intended to be a direct-to-home-video production, but
since the opening scenes turned out so spectacular, that they recreated a
theatrical feature for the sequel.
Those opening scenes are one of the first things that might make you think,
`Hmmmm, this sequel is pretty good!'  But they're more than `pretty good'. 
They are outrageously funny and exciting.  In these scenes, one Buzz Lightyear,
a space ranger in the Gamma Quadrant, fighting his way on the planet of his
evil rival, Emperor Zurg, blasting enemies with his laser, dodging booby traps,
and plucking out batteries (they are Zurg's power source).  But then, he
confronts the evil emperor himself (who, by the way, is a howlingly funny
parody of Darth Vader), only to get blasted to smithereens (PS:  It all turns
out to be a video game).
Then, we find ourselves in Andy's room, where we meet all our familiar pals
from the original TOY STORY:  Slinky the loyal dog, the cantankerous Mr. Potato
Head (softened up, this time around, by the presence of a Mrs. Potato Head he
got his wish from the first `story'), the insecure Rex (no need to mention
he's a dinosaur), love struck Bo Peep, and of course, the ever-lovable (and
hilarious) pull-string cowboy doll, Woody.
After Andy accidentally rips Woody's arm, he is forced to leave him on the
shelf while he heads away to summer, er, cowboy, camp.  Woody befriends Wheezy,
a tiny, lovable penguin with a broken squeaker, who gets chosen to be in a Yard
Sale Andy's mom recently puts up.  Woody assaults a rescue mission (with the
aid of another lovable character, Andy's recently bought pet dog, Buster), and
in doing so, accidentally falls into the clutches of one Al McWiggin.  This
greedy, fat guy (who is nicknamed Chicken Man) intends to sell Woody to a
museum in Japan.
Anyway, Buzz Lightyear rallies up Potato Head, Rex, Hamm, and Slinky, and they
set off to rescue Woody from Al's Toy Barn.
Meanwhile, Woody meets up with three other valuable collectibles, Jessie, a
cowgirl who has an attitude about human owners (her owner outgrew and ditched
her in a donation box, we later on discover), a endearingly loyal horse,
Bullseye, and the Prospector (aka Stinky Pete).  These collectibles are
actually characters of an early TV show WOODY'S ROUNDUP, which stars (you
guessed it).  They have been anticipating Woody, who will finally be able to
help make them famous at the museum (or else they'll be put back into storage).
 And they want Woody to go, whether or not he likes it.
Should Woody take the next plane flight to Japan, and be admired (if not
loved) by millions of children, or should he return home with his old friends
and accept the fact that one day Andy might outgrow him?
If you think I'm going to give you the answer, you are absolutely, positively,
100% incorrect.  You have to see the movie in order to find out.  And I do
mean, you HAVE to see it.  There's a lot to catch your eye, including the as
always dazzling 3-D computer animation from Pixar.  Yet one cannot help but
guess that the animation is also a step up from the recent A BUG'S LIFE.  It
is.  TOY STORY and A BUG'S LIFE's animation seemed somewhat experimental in
comparison to this.  Everything is 100% realistically rendered (even though
some of the humans look somewhat like action figures, but I'm not complaining),
from Andy's playroom to Al's Toy Barn, to a climactic finale at an airport.
The scenes are very masterfully executed, with a lot of quick cuts and stunts
here and there.  It's so exciting, in fact, that it almost feels like you're on
a roller coaster ride and that makes TOY STORY 2 all the more entertaining. 
There's a lot of breathtaking, and suspenseful action scenes, when the toys run
across the street disguised as cones dodging cars (and causing traffic
accidents), driving carsthe goofy way (a toy one, and THEN a REAL one No, I'm
not kidding!  They really do!), running up an air vent system, climbing,
battling, and almost falling, up an elevator shaft, through an airport conveyer
belt (which looks more labyrinthe than it has to, but that makes it more
exciting), and even jumping off airplanes.  Whew!  With a lot of action scenes
like that, one can tell that director John Lasseter and his colleagues have
been taking lessons from Japanese animation master Hayao Miyazaki (creator of
***** films such as KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE, MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, CASTLE IN THE
SKY, and even the recently released PRINCESS MONONOKE).  Incidentally, they do.
 I read in an article that whenever Lasseter and his colleagues feel stumped,
they pop in a laser disc of one of his filmsand they get inspiration from it. 
(Miyazaki would be pleased to hear that. ^_^)
And the film, like TOY STORY and A BUG'S LIFE, is JAM-packed with humor. 
There are a lot of funny one-liners from the characters (`Are you gonna turn me
into a mashed potato?'  `I'll pack your angry eyes, just in case') that fail
miserably to get old fast.  In addition, there is an EXTREMELY funny STAR WARS
parody at the beginning, and it seems to continue throughout the film,
particularly when Buzz Lightyear (well, another Buzz who thinks he's real, that
is) and Emperor Zurg have their duel in which Buzz discovers Zurg is (you
guessed it) his father.  Later on, we see them playing catch, as if they were
really attached to each other.  There's something funny and sweet about that. 
And the action scenes are also funny, particularly from the doings of the toys,
and how they handle certain situations.
What's important about a sequel, however, are two things.  First, it must be
something original, not just a sorry remake of the film that preceded it.  With
Pixar, you can tell that these guys know what makes a good film.  The story is
not rehashed from the original, it's different and equally enjoyable.  And even
though there are a couple of references to the original (Buzz asking the toys
`Did Woody give up when Sid had me strapped to a rocket?'  `Did Woody give up
when you guys [the toys] threw him out of that moving truck?', and later on him
telling Woody `You are a TOY!'), the overall level of the story completely
avoids being a remake of the original.
Another thing that is important is a thing that is required with all films. 
They have to have heart.  Pixar is definitely not afraid to have any of that in
any of their films.  The heart here is the message about how comforting toys
can be to kids.  When Jessie recalls the good old days with her former owner,
Emily, and their fun activities together (playing, swinging, and rolling around
in leaves), we are filled with feelings of what it's like to be a kid, and how
nice it is to have toys to comfort you.  When Emily starts to spend more time
with her friends and less time with Jessie, we feel, just as she does,
neglected, but we also are aware that this same thing happens in real life. 
Kids outgrow toys.  And what is real love anyway?  Being watched at from a
glass bottle by millions of kids, or being with someone who really loves you? 
This is something to think about.
With the return of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and all the other actors who gave
life to the characters in the original TOY STORY, one expects nothing less than
enthusiasm and excellence.  These expectations are more than completely
fulfilledthey surpass them.  The cast hams it up (no offense, Miss Piggy) as
if they've never grown tired of their characters, as if they're, well, playing
with toys.  And the new additions to the cast (Joan Cusack as Jessie, Kelsley
Grammer as Prospector, Andrew Stanton as Emperor Zurg) carry on the same
tradition.
Pixar films have always had popular composer Randy Newman score their films,
and Newman returns once again to deliver another excellent score.  His scores
for TOY STORY and A BUG'S LIFE were experimental since he hadn't, back then,
done any music for any animated film, traditional cel, or computer rendered. 
The score for TOY STORY 2 is his crowning achievement in these kind of scores,
with a lot of really exciting, funny, and altogether enjoyable passages.  He
also provides the songs for the film.  TOY STORY 2, like Pixar's other films,
are not musicals, even though they do have `songs'.  Singing here on the
soundtrack is not Newman himself at all (One of my only gripes about the film;
what is wrong with Newman singing?  I think he's a terrific singer, and my
family thinks so, too.) but Sarah McLachlan, who helps a weakly composed but
effectively written number, `When She Loved Me', Riders in the Sky, who
contribute to an ingeniously created theme for WOODY'S ROUNDUP, and Robert
Goulet, who contributes to a jazzed up arrangement of `You've Got A Friend In
Me' (One of the finest songs Newman has ever written).
If there was anything that I could complain about the film (aside from Newman
not singing), it probably would be the Prospector.  I mentioned before that
he's actually Stinky Pete, right?  Not that I intend to give away any
surprises, but later on, he turns out to be, well, a real Stinker.  It seems
somewhat curious that Pixar decided to turn who appears to be one of the nicest
characters in the film into a baddie at the end.  But then, how did the
television set in Al's office come on when Woody attempted to retrieve his arm?
 Well, on the other hand, sometimes a real villain can be a person who acts as
a friend, but turns out to be far from it in the end.  Rather interesting.
Such criticisms, however, do not at all take away from my recommendation of
TOY STORY 2.  I recommend it very highly (as you can judge from my rating),
since it is so much fun to watch from start to finish.
Footnote:  There are a couple of inside references from A BUG'S LIFE in the
form of action figures and familiar images.  Be sure to keep an eye out for
them.

Story by John Lasseter, Peter Docter, Ash Brannon, and Andrew Stanton. 
Screenplay by Andrew Stanton, Rita Hsiao, Doug Chamberlain, and Chris 
Webb. 
Directed by Colin Brady, Ash Brannon, John Lasseter, and Lee Unkrich. 
Featuring the voice talents of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Jim 
Varney, John Ratzenberger, Annie Potts, and Kelsey Grammer. 
Rated G (suitable for all audiences; a few surprising sexual jokes will 
fly over young children). 
Synopsis: Space toy Buzz Lightyear leads "the boys" -- Mr. Potato Head, 
Slinky Dog, Rex, and Hamm -- into the big city to save fellow toy Woody 
from a rare toy dealer.  During their adventure, Buzz Lightyear 
inadvertantly frees another Buzz Lightyear toy and his archnemesis 
Emperor Zurg, while the rest of the boys face temptation from Barbie 
dolls. 
Comments: I'm not sure what impressed me more when I saw TOY STORY 2 on 
Thanksgiving Day.  I saw it at the new "Cobblestone Square 20", a 20 
screen multiplex with "stadium seating".  It was not the first time I 
had seen a film in a setting like this, but it was still a very nice 
experience.  TOY STORY 2, easily the best animated feature for all 
audiences in recent memory, made for very entertaining holiday fare for 
young and old, but the movie was almost overshadowed by a lengthy 
trailer for another computer-animated flick called DINOSAURS slated for 
a May 2000 release.  The trailer featured stunning images of dinasaurs 
roaming a prehistoric landscape, and judging the packed theater's 
reactions to it, this film is going to have a lot of pre-release 
interest. 
The movie at hand, however, is TOY STORY 2, and it is very, very good.  
This is a sequel to the 1995 hit TOY STORY, and, unlike many sequels, 
this is an equal to (and in terms of animation, the superior of) the 
original.  Releasing this gem during the holiday season was a very good 
idea.  The entire family can enjoy this film.  The children at the 
theater seemed to get a kick out of watching toys come to life when no 
human is looking at them, and they laughed at their visual gags and 
slapstick antics.  Adults seemed to appreciate the humor that was 
addressed to them.  This included quips about car manuals and traffic 
cones, and a blatant sexual arousal joke at the end of the film.  
Science fiction fans, like myself, absolutely loved the opening 
sequence.  In it, Rex plays a Buz Lightyear video game, and the game 
parodies several old SF movies, including STAR TREK 2 and 2001. 
The animation, produced by Pixar Animation Studios and Disney, is 
absolutely top-notch.  It is very rich and catches the audience's eyes 
from start to finish.  A huge pool of comic talent provide the voices of 
the toys.  These include multiple Academy Award winner Tom Hanks, HOME 
IMPROVEMENT's Tim Allen, CHEERS' John Ratzenberger, FRASIER's Kelsey 
Grammer, SEINFELD's Estelle Harris, and Don Rickles.  The cast is solid 
and entertaining. 
Some films, like comedies, transfer to the small screen without any 
significant loss.  A movie like TOY STORY 2, however, should be seen on 
the big screen.  One gets a better sense of the superior animation of a 
film like this only if he sees it at a theater.  Definately check this 
one out!

Walt Disney has dominated the Thanksgiving movie season for many a year,
but since 1995, the prime justification for this has been their
collaboration with Pixar animation studios. The merging of Disney and
Pixar brought us the original `Toy Story', a computer-generated marvel
that wowed children and parents alike with it's astounding visual style
and instantly lovable characters. This last year, `A Bug's Life' was
released to a similar amount of prosperity at the Thanksgiving box
office. It seemed as if Disney and Pixar could never miss the target,
and the thoroughly delightful `Toy Story 2' is additional proof of that
fact.
I truly cannot imagine a more quality family film than `Toy Story 2'.
It's an endlessly imaginative visual feast, brimming with colorful
humor, endearing characters and offering a wonderful surprise around
each new corner. Director John Lasseter has crafted yet another visual
phenomenon, but it's also an emotionally fulfilling experience, guided
by a sure-footed approach that layers on the adventurous satisfaction.
For viewers of all ages (including adults with no child accompaniment),
it could be the most enjoyable cinematic experience of the entire year.
Lasseter opens with space ranger Buzz Lightyear (voice of Tim Allen)
battling the evil Emperor Zurg on a distant planet. This sequence is,
alone, worth the price of an evening admission. Meanwhile, cowboy Woody
(Tom Hanks) and the remainder of the toy gang are preparing for an
upcoming yard sale. During a rescue mission, Woody is abducted by a
deranged toy dealer (Wayne Knight) who recognizes the cowboy doll as a
rare collector's item. He stumbles upon surprising information about his
past: part of an ancient 50's television show called Woody's Round-up',
he rode a horse named Bullseye, romanced a pretty cowgirl named Jessie
(Joan Cusack) and was mentored by the wise old Prospector (Kelsey
Grammer). With the entire Woody's Round-up' gang in his collection, Al
the toy dealer realizes the set could be worth a pretty penny.
At time same, Buzz and company are organizing a search party to find
their beloved cowboy friend. Yes, all those lovable characters from the
original `Toy Story' have made a triumphant return: the irritable Mr.
Potato Head (Don Rickles), Hamm the piggy bank (John Ratzenberger), the
cowardly dinosaur Rex (Wallace Shawn), and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney)
himself. As they travel across the city searching for Woody, it seems as
if each new visual setpiece is more amazing than the last. Just one
example is when the toy squadron attempts to cross a busy street,
shielded only by pylons to divert the oncoming traffic. `Toy Story 2' is
easily the most visually exciting movie of 1999; the human characters,
especially, are animated with an amazing level of delicate detail. They
look real, people.
This sequel is definitely on par with the original `Toy Story', and, in
several aspects, it surpasses it. No one in the audience should be
detached from the storyline for one minute. The humor is both clever and
thoughtful, as Lasseter directs with wonderful motion that had me
completely involved from the get-go. All of the actors are remarkable
with their voice-overs, particularly Hanks, Allen and Wallace Shawn -
who is all-too perfect for the voice of Rex and delivers laughs at a
rapid-fire pace. And, with an agreement made with Mattel, Barbie has a
cameo appearance in a toy store.
Family entertainment of this caliber is very hard to come by nowadays. I
applaud `Toy Story 2' for it's ability to present a mature and effective
story, and to generate so much excitement that is derived from
friendship and morals instead of conventional violence. I am certainly
past the age of watching movies about talking dolls, but this quality
feature is one of the year's best films. Here is one excited moviegoer
hoping that the collaboration of Disney and Pixar continues for years to
come. After all, no one is ever too old to play with toys.
