 ABERDEEN (director/writer: Hans Petter Moland; screenwriter: Kristin
 Amundsen; cinematographer: Philip Řgaard; editor: Sofie Hesselberg;
 cast: Lena Headey (Kaisa), Stellan Skarsgard (Tomas), Charlotte
 Rampling (Helen), Ian Hart (Clive); Runtime: 106; Norsk/Freeway;
 2000-Norway/UK)
A road film about trying to reach somewhere. This human interest drama
is one big metaphor about a strained father and daughter relationship.
They are trying to find themselves while on the road. The keen dynamics
between the down-and-out alcoholic father, Tomas (Stellan Skarsgard),
and his cocaine-snorting but successful lawyer daughter, Kaisa (Lena
Headey), gives this universal theme (father-daughter relationship) a
fresh look. This intense story about a dysfunctional family is powerful
but bleak, and is directed with a fierce honesty by Norwegian director
Hans Petter Moland ("Zero Kelvin"/"The Last Lieutenant").
Kaisa's mother (Rampling) is dying of cancer in a hospital in Aberdeen
and after not being close with her daughter for a number of years, calls
her in London and asks her to take her alcoholic father, living on a rig
in Oslo, to visit her. Kaisa is an ambitious lawyer who wears
high-powered business suits, is not afraid of having sex to help her
career, and is smart enough to know how to play office politics as good
as a man does. She has just received an office promotion and is having
sex with a stranger (the kind of relationship she prefers) when she
receives the unwelcome call from her mother. When her parents, who never
married, split-up, she went to live with her oil worker father in
Norway. She blames him for her now being so cold-hearted and scared to
face herself, telling him she lost her virginity as a kid while he was
away; and, that he never was a proper parent to her. What she has
learned best from him, is that you can't trust men.
Her drunk father is an unpleasant travelling companion. They can't get
on a flight because he's drunk, so they hop a ferry to Great Britain and
then try to make their way to Aberdeen by rental car. But she gets a
flat tire and there's no spare. To her rescue comes lorry driver Clive
(Ian Hart). He's attracted to her, but finds her relationship with her
dad to be" strange but nice." Dad likes him, telling her he's a nice guy
and wonders why she's not attracted to him. When dad is too drunk to
resume the journey and has to spend a night in jail, she sleeps with the
self-effacing Clive. He perceptively picks up what's her problem with
men, that she's afraid of a real relationship with someone she likes
because she's afraid of getting hurt. He, therefore, becomes their
guardian angel for the rest of the trip and offers them some common
sense advice. But he's in emotional depths beyond what he can imagine,
and feels he has become part of their nightmare when he has to rescue
the father from a mugging and stop the same rowdy thugs from pummeling
Kaisa.
It's a film that avoids cliches for its answers, has plenty of energy,
and an intelligent script to go along with the brilliant performances by
both Lena Headey and Stellan Skarsgard. My favorite line in the film is
when the self-pitying drunken father tries to explain himself by saying:
"I'm outdated. It is unfashionable to have a mind of your own."
"Aberdeen" is thematically similar to Mike Figgis's "Leaving Las Vegas,"
except there the end of the journey was most important, here it is the
journey itself that counts the most.

   Truck drivers pick up people however weird-looking
because they presumably know what it's like to be stranded
on a desolate highway, front tire blown out.  Of course they're
looking for some conversation as well on their lonely treks
across great expanses of road.  Some time after a driver
named Clive (Ian Hart--who for my money looks a
lot like a  Donald O'Connor from "Singin' in the Rain") gives a
lift to an older man with a young woman on a European
highway, he concludes that they are "strange but nice." 
That's about best way to describe the father-daughter
combination of Tomas (Stellan Skarsgard) and Kaisa (Lena
Headey) in "Aberdeen," Hans Petter Moland's road movie that
combines a delayed coming of age drama with the possibility
of family redemption.  Often theatrical as though to show off
the considerable talent of its essentially four-person cast,
"Aberdeen" will remind moviegoers of Mike Figgis's "Leaving
Las Vegas" with fragments of such drug-or-drink related films
as "Trainspotting" (because of the Scottish influence),
"Requiem for a Dream," and even the great classic with
Welsh-born Ray Milland, Billy Wilder's unrelenting story of
alcoholism, "The Lost Weekend."  If "Aberdeen" breaks no
new ground--unlike the film that introduced Mr. Skarsgard to a
world audience, "Breaking the Waves"--there's some mighty
powerful acting at work here.  Sparks fly.
   When we see a flashback of Kaisa's relationship with her
dad when she was about ten years old, jumping into his arms
as he arrives home from work in their rural Scottish town, we
can understand how she had the motivation to become a
lawyer.  What is not clear at first, given the disposition of
psychologists to say that a woman's relationship with men is
dependent on her connection with her dad, is why she seems
to prefer sex with a bevy of men whose names she cannot
remember to a steady alliance with a good guy. But that
insight comes soon enough, when her mother (Charlotte
Rampling), now dying of cancer in Aberdeen's St. Ruth's
Infirmary, asks her London-based daughter to pick up Tomas
from his workplace on a rig on Norway (shades of "Breaking
the Waves"!).  What she finds is an out-of-work man broken
down by alcoholism and, in a role reversal more commonly
found when aging parents are afflicted with ailments like
Alzheimer's, the child becomes mother to the man.  
   Director Moland ("Zero Kelvin," "The Last Lieutenant") takes
us on a ride from London to Norway to Scotland which
inevitably means trouble for the booze-addicted dad and her
cocaine-snorting daughter.  One blown tire and the odd
couple sign on to a truck ride with Clive who is surprisingly
adept at straightening them out and who himself is plunged
into an adventure he never could have imagined.
   "Aberdeen" recalls elements in the relationship between
characters played by Nicolas Cage and Elizabeth Shue in
another downer, "Leaving Las Vegas," though Ms. Headey's
character is a lot freer with her language and Mr. Skarsgard
not quite ready to do himself in like the unhappy fellow who
makes what he considers his final trip to Nevada.  As we
soak in Philip Ogaard's lensing of some less-than-touristic
areas of Scotland and Norway, we see the three folks in a
truck act out a great drama in their lives, with Lena Headey
giving Stellan Skarsgard more than suitable histrionics as a
successful lawyer who resorts to various antics including
physical violence against a group of muggers.  She looks
darn good even when cut, bruised and bandaged while
Skarsgard is terrific, speaking fluent English with a thoroughly
American accent.
Not Rated.  Running time: 106 minutes.  (C)2001,

Lena Headey gives what could be one of the year's brightest breakthrough
performances in Aberdeen, a weakly written, poorly paced film that has
yet to find an American distributor despite being somewhat of a hit on
the festival circuit.  It's a confusing road-trip flick, but Headey's
terrific outing is more than enough to hold the mess together.
Headey (Gossip) plays Kaisa, a successful employee in one of London's
biggest law firms and, as the film opens, the guest of honor at a party
congratulating her on a recent promotion.  She's also a bit promiscuous,
preferring anonymous sexual encounters to establishing any type of
relationship with men.  Kaisa is in bed with another of her one-night
stands when her mother, Helen (Charlotte Rampling, The Wings of the
Dove), calls with a rather bizarre request.
It turns out that Tomas (Stellan Skarsgĺrd, Dancer in the Dark), Kaisa's
estranged, alcoholic father, has agreed to check himself into a detox
program in Aberdeen.  Helen wants Kaisa to trek to Norway and escort
Tomas from his Norwegian oil rig to Scotland, which the family once
called home. She agrees after learning the incentive for completing the
mission is Tomas' classic sports car that Kaisa has yearned for since
she was a child.
Of course, like any road-trip film, things don't always go too smoothly.
When Kaisa finally makes it to Norway, she finds a drunk, disheveled
Tomas who knows nothing about the Aberdeen detox plan (Helen has a
mysterious ulterior motive).  They butt heads, and it becomes clear that
Kaisa must act as a parent to her infantile father, who repays her in
vomit.  We learn through flashbacks that the two were once close, but
Tomas abandoned Kaisa and her mother at a time when she needed a father
figure the most.
The journey Kaisa and Tomas take is a little hard to follow.  There were
a couple of moments in which I had no idea where Kaisa and Tomas were,
or where they were supposed to be heading.  Aberdeen's story, co-written
by Kristin Amundsen, Lars Bill Lundholm and the film's director, Hans
Petter Moland, doesn't really offer anything new to the road-trip genre
and, as a result, the film drags in several segments.
On the plus side, the acting in Aberdeen is first-rate.  Skarsgĺrd and
Spring Forward's Ian Hart (he plays a trucker who gets involved in Kaisa
and Tomas' journey) turn in typically strong performances, but Headey
steals the show as the long-legged vixen with more character flaws than
a politician on the take (think of a taller, thinner Heather Langenkamp
with a Scottish accent).  She's beautiful, confident and totally damaged
all at once (and the accent doesn't hurt, either).
Viewers may notice a similarity between Aberdeen and Lars von Trier's
Breaking the Waves.  Both films were helmed by Scandinavian directors
and featured both a young English actress portraying a Scot (Emily
Watson in Waves), and Skarsgĺrd playing a hard-drinking oil rig worker.

Call it a road trip for the walking wounded.  Stellan Skarsgĺrd plays
such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that it's difficult to spend
nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly, boozed-out presence.  Yet
this ever-reliable Swedish actor adds depth and significance to the
otherwise plodding and forgettable Aberdeen, a sentimental and painfully
mundane European drama.
Playwright August Strindberg built his career on families and
relationships paralyzed by secrets, unable to express their longings
until the hour is far too late.  That's an accurate reflection of what
Aberdeen strives for, focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father,
Tomas (Skarsgĺrd) and his alienated, openly hostile yuppie daughter,
Kaisa (Lena Headey, Gossip).  They haven't spoken in years, and wouldn't
even be making the long trip from Norway to Aberdeen, Scotland by
automobile if it weren't for Kaisa's mother (Charlotte Rampling, Under
the Sand) rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer.
In a soap opera twist, mother has only a few days to live.  (Only in the
movies, right?)  Too blitzed to even step foot on a plane, Tomas hits
the open road with Kaisa.  Loathing each other all the while, they make
periodic stops for Tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out --
whenever he isn't muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be. 
Despite his sloshed viewpoint, Tomas recognizes that the apple hasn't
fallen very far from the tree.  Kaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting
coke, sabotages her personal relationships through indifference, and is
unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper.  Ain't they a pair?
Unable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the one-note
and repetitively bitchy dialogue, screenwriters Kristin Amundsen and
Hans Petter Moland fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events
forward -- lost money, roving street hooligans looking for drunks to
kick around, nosy cops, and flat tires all figure into the schematic and
convenient narrative.  By the time they reach the hospital, it's time to
unveil the Secrets From A Dark Past that are not only simplistic devices
that trivialize the father-daughter conflict, they're also the mainstays
of many a bad Strindberg wannabe.  This revelation exists purely for its
own sake.  Aberdeen doesn't know where else to go.
Weak, unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of Kaisa.  If Lena
Headey were a stronger actress, perhaps Aberdeen could have been able to
coast on the performances and moody, haunting cinematography (rendering
Norway into its own pastoral ghost world -- the reference to a certain
superior American indie flick intentional).  Headey's too busy acting,
using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of
insouciance.  If she were paying any attention to Skarsgĺrd, maybe she'd
figure out that doing less can reveal so much more.
It's worthwhile to compare Aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001,
Jonathan Nossiter's captivating Signs & Wonders.  It's not just because
Skarsgĺrd and Rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films
(they're not bound by ceremonial wedlock in Aberdeen).  The differences
in the way their characters were presented is significant.  In Aberdeen,
Rampling is a luminous diva, preening and static in her hospital bed. 
Despite Skarsgĺrd's solid performance as Tomas, his pathetic drunk is
never given much of a chance to emote anything besides catatonic
sorrow.  There's genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during
their understated confrontations in Signs & Wonders, allowing them to
suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and
years of stifled curiosity.
Nossiter's film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition
to delving into the Americanization of Greece and the use of mysticism
as an illusion to deflect pain.  If Signs & Wonders sometimes feels
overloaded with ideas, at least it's willing to stretch beyond what
we've come to expect from traditional drama.  Aberdeen is never half so
ambitious, content to sleepwalk through the rhythms and timing of other
movies.  When did character driven stories stop paying attention to the
complexities of real life?  The depressing answer can be found in
Lawrence Kasdan's trite but occasionally useful Grand Canyon, where
Steve Martin's Hollywood mogul pronounces, "All of life's riddles are
answered in the movies!"  Even foreign films are taking that advice to
heart.
