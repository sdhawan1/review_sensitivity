THE ORIGINAL KINGS OF COMEDY (2000) / * 1/2
Directed by Spike Lee. Starring Steve Harvey, DL Hughley, Cedric the
Entertainer, Bernie Mac. Running time: 115 minutes. Rated AA for mature
subject matter and coarse language by the MFCB. Reviewed on September
12th, 2000.
That's a cliche, to be sure, but it's also true. Much of it comes from the
fact that the act of killing is reasonably straightforward, whereas making
people laugh is considerably more elusive. And, by extension, it's because
while being dead is a pretty objective state (certain metaphysical 
concerns notwithstanding), being funny is a lot more personal and
subjective. What I find absolutely uproarious might be stupid or silly or
just plain boring to somebody else. Sense of humour is as individual as we
are.
As such, I will not really attempt to assess how funny "The Original Kings
Of Comedy" is. I will merely indicate that I didn't find it at all 
amusing. Certainly, there were moments which elicited a few chuckles, but
I spent most of the film's nearly two-hour duration sitting in my seat
slack-jawed, wondering what I was missing. Because not only does the
audience in the movie clearly love the act (it'd be a curious concert film
otherwise!) but many others at the screening I attended got a kick out of
it too. So the humour in the picture clearly has an appeal -- just not for
me.
All that said, though, there are aspects of "The Original Kings Of Comedy"
which are candidates for discussion and which are not quite so subjective
as the quality (or lack thereof) of its humour. It is in many ways a very
flawed undertaking and while those who appreciate its brand of comedy may
be able to overlook this, it makes the experience all the more intolerable
for those who do not.
"The Original Kings Of Comedy" is spliced together by director Spike Lee 
from two performances in Charlotte, on February 26th and 27th of this
year. The show consists of four respected (if not exactly famous) black
comedians plying their trade. DL Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer, and 
Bernie Mac are presented in single individual segments running about 
thirty minutes each. Introducing each act is Steve Harvey, which is to
basically say that Harvey gets three separate ten-minute blocks of stage
time to put on his act instead of an unbroken half hour like the others.
The picture is also peppered with brief behind-the-scenes clips which add
little to the proceedings as a whole.
The film's major problem is the sheer lack of variety amongst the four
comedians, virtually all of whose humour runs along similar lines. All
four indulge in lots of "black people versus white people" commentary
(which is often hilarious, but gets really tedious on its umpteenth
iteration in the span of two hours). All four stay confined to very 
broad-based topics, largely eschewing any political or intellectual
commentary. And all of them lace their monologues with an endless litany
of profanity. Whereas the best comedians know to use swearing to punctuate
their punchlines, here it is often used in place of one: a much lower
brand of humour for sure.
Further, there is little insight offered through the jokes. There is a lot
of racial content, but it mostly consists of potshots at Caucasians and/or
African-Americans. Certainly, we are afforded only the barest of glimpses
into what it is like to be a black man in America. These comedians are
happy to talk about the world around them, but reveal precious little
about themselves in the process. Most of the comedy is of sitcom variety,
and while this is fine in half-hour doses on prime time television, it
feels like an opportunity wasted in a major motion picture.
The comedian who comes closest to achieving some sort of relevance with
his segment is Bernie Mac, who discusses the effects of his sister's drug
habit on his family (he is now sharing custody of her three children with
his brother-in-law). Unfortunately, Mac couches this portion of his 
monologue in exceedingly unpleasant jokes, constantly referring to his six
year-old nephew as a "faggot" and talking about physically beating his own
child. Mac's brand of humor is extremely edgy, maybe too much so; it makes
for an uncomfortable performance which straddles the line between comedy
and cruelty and, perhaps, goes a little too far.
Mac's half hour also illustrates the restrictions imposed by recording
the film in a live environment. Mac has a thick accent (as does Cedric, to
a lesser extent), and I found that the concert's sound facilities --
obviously a poor comparison with anything that would be taped in a studio
-- often distorted his words to the point of unintelligibility. Lee is
also occasionally forced to choose some rather poor camera angles, though
in general he does a good job of setting things up to capture the 
performers at the best possible angles.
Of the four comedians, I found Harvey's material the best. This may have
been aided by the fact that, alone amongst the quartet, his screentime
is split up, so that he does not overstay his welcome. Intriguingly,
Harvey's best material comes when he is adlibbing to the audience. For
example, when a Rastafarian-looking man in the front row tells him that
he's doing computer technology education, Harvey retorts that the last two
words that come to his mind when he looks at the man are "technology"...
or "education". He also has a few amusing rehearsed skits, like one about
black people on the "Titanic".
But good gags like this are few and far between. I found "The Original
Kings Of Comedy" to be an unpleasant morass, a sterile waste of a long two
hours. Maybe my sense of humour just isn't geared in the right way. Maybe
I'm not the demographic that the "Kings" are appealing to. I guess much
the same reaction would be had if Newfoundland's comedy troupe Buddy
Wassisname and the Other Fellers were dropped off in the South Bronx to do
a show. If you understand the reference, I expect you'll see the point. If
you don't understand the reference... well, maybe that makes the point,
too.

_The_Original_Kings_of_Comedy_ (R) *** (out of ****)
        Normal film review rules don't necessarily apply to
_The_Original_Kings_of_Comedy_.  Despite being "a Spike Lee Joint," this
film of the popular stand-up comedy tour featuring Steve Harvey, D.L.
Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer, and Bernie Mac is completely devoid of
his trademark razzle dazzle; Lee shoots the concert as matter-of-factly
as an HBO comedy special.   While not making for the most visually
inventive of cinema, the straightforward approach puts in proper focus
the film's appeal: four talented guys simply being very funny.
        Anyone familiar with the stand-up shows from which most of the
four first gained notice--BET's _Comicview_ and HBO's
_Def_Comedy_Jam_--knows that in being funny, these guys are also rather
profane.  Audiences whose only previous experience with Harvey and Cedric
is their work on the former's eponymous WB sitcom, or with Hughley on his
ABC-to-UPN transplant _The_Hughleys_, are in for a shock--the stars of
these family-skewed shows toss off four-letter words with the best
(worst?) of them.  Prudes may find the amount of profanity ridiculously
excessive, but it's an integral part of the comedians' verbal arsenal. 
Shock value isn't so much the intent as a side effect; the words are used
to punctuate and underscore their ideas and observations, many of which
revolve around the differences between blacks and whites.
        While that inevitably leads to overlap between the four's
routines--and a certain feeling of repetition--each performer carves out
their own distinct personality.  Harvey serves as emcee, and he's the
smooth romantic, the highlight of his sets (he does a bit between each
act) being a tribute to '70s old school soul that includes a hilarious,
on-target rip on rap/hip-hop concerts.  Hughley is the energetic live
wire, closing out his routine with jabs at random audience members. 
Cedric is the most laid-back--and most impressively coordinated; his
dance moves got both the filmed and live audiences going.
        Mac's aggressive closing set is at once the most incendiary and
the most truthful.  His routine could share the title of the central
manifesto in _Jerry_Maguire_, "The Things We Think and Do Not Say";
nothing and no one is safe as Mac talks about wanting to beat sense into
naughty children and launches into an extended bit involving stuttering. 
Much of his material could easily offend, but a lot of it comes within a
disarmingly honest context, such as the jokes involving his nieces and
nephew, the custody of whom was taken away from his drug-addicted sister
and given to him.  Of course, the comedic meat of the jokes derives from
his creative embellishment, but there is the ring of hard truth in the
jokes' foundation.
        In an attempt to break the stage-and-crowd visual monotony, Lee
sometimes cuts away from the performance to some moments away from the
performance arena.  Not a bad idea, per se, but these segments, such as a
rather pointless one where the four play poker, are largely dull lulls
that make the audience too aware of the film's 120-minute running time.
        But most of 120 minutes are devoted to what audiences buy a
ticket to see: Steve Harvey, D.L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer, and
Bernie Mac doing their thing.  They don't disappoint--and, in turn,
neither does _The_Original_Kings_of_Comedy_.

Well-directed, very funny in several spots, topical without being offensive, 
THE ORIGINAL KINGS OF COMEDY shows off the routines of four leading African 
American comedians  Steve Harvey, D.L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer, and 
Bernie Mac.  This performance of the  `Kings of Comedy' tour was filmed at 
the Charlotte Coliseum by director Spike Lee.
Steve Harvey works well in his role of comedian and master of ceremonies.  
His function effectively divides his routine into several spots, each 
several minutes long;  Harvey provides very flattering introductions for 
Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer and Mac.
Harvey also seems to be very good-natured in his approach to comedy.  
Although he is not above being arch and downright earthy, Harvey enjoys 
himself immensely and frequently laughs at his own jokes.  Just the 
spectacle of his imitating a black person aboard the Titanic is hilarious!
D.L. Hughley also does a very enjoyable routine.  Like all of his 
colleagues, Hughley addresses racial issues, but never handles them 
offensively: his jibes at white people in the audience are fun-loving and 
accurate.
Cedric the Entertainer is perhaps the most energetic among the performers.  
His crazy dances, imitations, and footwork are funny because of their topics 
as well as their incongruity: such antics from a round bear of a man in a 
sweater, gold chain and fedora are indeed amusing.
Bernie Mac was hard to read.  In sequences filmed outside, in what seemed to 
be a playground, he is well-spoken and clear.  Yet in his routine, Mac 
speaks in a fast-paced jumble, often hard to comprehend.  Is this part of 
his act  a persona designed to reflect both his jokes and culture  or is 
it a result of his hard-edged pace?  In any case, Mac used the most 
profanity in his routine, frequently overusing obscenities for their own 
sake.  Although I found his methods to be the least likable of the four 
stand-up masters, Bernie Mac does tell a very good visual joke.
Spike Lee is smart not to intrude upon the acts of the four stars.  Lee 
employs occasional montages  women from the audience posing for the camera, 
the comedians goofing around on a playground and backstage  and these brief 
sequences lend nice variation to the stage acts.  On the whole the direction 
is smooth, the editing tight.  The stage decoration is also tasteful and 
appropriate, the backdrop a jewel-studded crown, with satiny shapes adorning 
the curtains.
I would recommend this film mainly for its target audience, African 
Americans above age 16.  But its flavor extends certainly to all races, as 
most of the topics and interests are universal.  Though I did not get actual 
belly laughs from any of the content, the routines kept me laughing 
steadily.

Let's get one thing straight, from jump: if one is to speak of kings of
comedy - especially filmed concert-comedy, and most especially in terms
of originality - any exclusion of the name Richard Pryor, immediately
calls ones sanity into question.  Not to mention the magnitude of ones
cajones.  So, are Misters Harvey, Hughley, Entertainer [yes, I know],
and Mac heirs to Pryor's crown, or just mere pretenders to the throne?
The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Named after the long-running comedy tour that began in 1997 and ended on
the same stage in 2000, THE ORIGINAL KINGS OF COMEDY was filmed at the
Charlotte Coliseum on February 26th and 27th, 2000, and features
stand-up comedians and actors Steve Harvey, D.L. Hughley, Cedric The
Entertainer, and Bernie Mac.  The four men are shown not only on-stage,
but also in short behind-the-scenes bits that give the audience a brief
look at what motivates These Four Kings to do what they do best.  Look
and listen closely, and you might find that what you see on-stage, is
not necessarily what you'd get in Real Life...
The Upshot:
I think Pryor can breathe easy [hmmm...all things considered: no pun
intended].  This foursome is good, no doubt, but it'll take a lot more
than their approximately 30 minutes of stage time each, to wipe away any
memories of RICHARD PRYOR: LIVE ON THE SUNSET STRIP from my mind.
That said, past the "trash-talk" title of this Spike Lee joint, the four
"Kings" comedians do fit the bill for an audience that is used to their
brand of comedy - and, let's face it: that audience consists mostly of
cultural Blacks, and Whites who are Down.  Not to say that any of the
four were purposefully exclusionary - they weren't.  It's just that I'd
be very surprised to hear that Mr. And Mrs. Mainstreet were as laid out
throughout most of this concert, as many of the members of my (mixed
ages and races) viewing audience were at times.
[Hmmm...maybe I've gotten off to a bad start here.  Mr. And Mrs.
Mainstreet, feel free to go see the "Kangs" (as Steve Harvey jokingly
said the "country-ass" audience referred to them).  You can be Down too.
Anyway...]
Each of the four comics have had successes in similar venues: Harvey
hosts IT'S SHOWTIME AT THE APOLLO and is the star of THE STEVE HARVEY
SHOW TV series; Hughley was the original host of BET's COMIC VIEW (back
when it was funny) and like Harvey, is also star of a self-titled TV
series (THE HUGHLEYS); Cedric The Entertainer was the host of the second
year of COMIC VIEW (back when it was still funny, though well on the way
to becoming the unfunny joke that it is today) and co-stars on THE STEVE
HARVEY SHOW; and Bernie Mac, along with his ongoing role on MOESHA, has
appeared in movies like LIFE and ABOVE THE RIM.  But in this comedy
concert, it was their skills as veteran stand-up comedians, that came
into play.  With varying degrees of success.
Those "varying degrees" were strange, considering that each of the four
had very similar routines - granted, spiced with their own personal
flava.  If you kept track, you'd note that each of them touched on Old
School ways, on male/female relationships, and on the
ObWhiteAudienceMembers and how "we're different...but really, we're the
same", amongst other similar topics.  Of course, such is the Stuff of
comedy, especially the comedy of My People.  The way some of the
comedians were better at that Stuff than others, though, put me in mind
of IROC car races: since the vehicles are similarly equipped, the winner
is determined solely on his or her driving skills.  And in this case,
Steve Harvey - playing concert host while doing his own schtick - won
the Kings' Race Of Champions.
Harvey, a self-proclaimed "country boy" [though all of the Kings were
Country, dag!] had both the Charlotte and the theater audience right in
the palm of his hand.  He worked the crowd like a master (to say that he
reminded me of Johnny Carson in this, is a compliment), and almost
everything out of Harvey's mouth, was flat-out funny.  D.L Hughley, who
followed Harvey, wasn't as "on" as I've seen him in the past.  I've
never heard this particular routine of his before, but it sounded too
familiar; too...tired.  I found myself wishing he'd do his brilliant
"Come Back With Me" nostalgia "tour" (which reminds me: I need to find
that tape...).
Up next was the always-stylish Cedric The Entertainer, and while he
couldn't quite top Harvey, he also pumped up both audiences.  I know
*I'd* pay for a recording of "Peanut Butter...No Jam".  Closing the bill
- in my opinion, a mistake - was Bernie Mac.  The thought that kept
coming to me while watching Mac was, "what the hell is he so mad
about?".  The second thought was, "...and why should I care?".  Not a
good thing when you're supposed to be laughing at the jokes.  True, I
snickered now and then, but Mac never took off for me.  And neither did
the relatively flat ending.
Unless I miss my guess, Spike Lee should take blame for that virtual
thud.  That, the ineffectiveness of too many of the background bits [why
not spend some time telling us about the tour itself?  Or why such
talented men aren't making hand-over-fist like buttcheek-spreaders like
Jim Carrey?  Why'd you short-change the off-stage bits, Spike?], and
especially the terrible editing job done on this film.   And can you get
less impersonal than to keep showing the auto-tracking camera moving
back and forth across the stage?  The cold feeling of the shots almost
negated the energy that Harvey & Company generated.  Still, Lee deserves
props if only for bringing this concert to a wide audience.  After all,
when's the last time you saw a comedy concert released theatrically?
Taken on its own merits, THE ORIGINAL KINGS OF COMEDY was a successful
comedy concert; more successful in some parts (any time Steve Harvey was
on-stage) than in others (Bernie Mac's show-closing routine, Spike Lee's
filming, the poor editing, and the "off" feeling some of the non-concert
bits), but overall, a good show to watch.  But it does beg two related
questions: one, why a theatrical release? (possible answer: not
everybody gets HBO?); and two, why MTV Films?
The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
Thank you, Brother Spike, for providing me with the grindstone for
today's Black Factor Axe.
"How's that?", you say?  Well, I'll tell ya: it has been said that Lee
chose MTV Films over BET as a vehicle for producing "Kings" primarily
because, in a word, BET is notoriously cheap toward its performers
(something to the effect of Lee wanting to be paid in something other
than "sodas and subs").  Say what you want about the guy, but in this
case, I say, more power to ya, Spike.
Ahhh, BET: home of the wannabe-a-goldtooth-gangsta video manual, the
return of the minstrel show (aka, the latter years of COMIC VIEW), and
the never-ending infomercial.  BET: the Graveyard for any and every old
Black TV show - as long as it was a comedy (and usually, a lame one).
BET: The Hoochie Network.  Yes, Brother Spike was right on the money, in
more ways than one.  And if Lee's word ain't good enough for you, check
out the comic strip THE BOONDOCKS by Aaron McGruder (available online at
http://www.boondocks.net/).  McGruder's strip frequently provides
pointed - and funny - commentary on the sad state of BET.  Bammer sez
check it out.
Now, don't get me wrong; BET owner Robert Johnson knows how the game is
played in the capitalistic society known as Corporate America.  We can
bitchnmoan until the cows come home, but at the end of the day, Johnson
uses BET to line his pockets with dough.  And maybe that's as it should
be; after all, Johnson is really no different than the owners of any
other television network, who are also out to line their pockets with
dough, and produce pablum just as unpalatable as anything on BET.  But
one thing is certain: given Johnson's bottom line, the history of BET to
this point, and how We sometimes view anything Black-related, We delude
Ourselves when We think that BET is *anything* deeper than what the name
implies: a television network that (purports that it) provides
entertainment either primarily for, or about, Blacks.
Still..."Black Entertainment Television", my melanin-enhanced behind.
With a notable few exceptions (Tavis Smiley, TEEN SUMMIT, BOBBY JONES
GOSPEL, and maybe one or two more), it's been a LONNNNNNNG time since I
was Entertained by anything on BET.  As always, Your Mileage May Vary.
Bammer's Bottom Line:
"Kings"?  Hmmm...more like Clown Princes (and Bernie Mac, more a
Squire).  Still, the foursome did well, with Steve Harvey conducting the
How To Work An Audience clinic of a lifetime.  I have no idea whathell
was up with Spike Lee's poor filming and editing, though.  This joint
looked downright ugly.
THE ORIGINAL KINGS OF COMEDY (rating: greenlight):
But though his illness may have left Richard Pryor long past his stage
performing time, King Richard is *not* yet dead.  Long live the King...

"Everybody knows what's going to happen," says comedian Steve Harvey 
about the long film TITANIC.  So, "bring on the water," he says is what 
most black folks think.  He also says that no black band would be so 
dumb as to continue playing as the ship goes down.  Instead, they'd be 
trying to float the furniture for lifeboats and blow on their 
handkerchiefs for sails -- anything that might work.
Harvey is the king of the kings in THE ORIGINAL KINGS OF COMEDY, a 
documentary by famed director Spike Lee.  Besides doing his own comedy 
routine, Harvey host three other black comics (Cedric the Entertainer, 
D.L. Hughley and Bernie Mac), all known mainly for their television 
work.  
During a long tour around the United States, they are filmed at their 
stop in Charlotte, North Carolina.  The concert audience was 98% black, 
whereas our movie audience was widely mixed.  The surprise was that 
humor directed at a black audience turns out to have a strong resonance 
with all races.  Our audience members were in stitches throughout.  Part 
of this could be explained by the non-racial humor.  Church, for 
example, was so demanding and exhausting while he was growing up, Harvey 
says, that he thought hell sounded a lot easier.  He then ticked off all 
of the services he was required to attend by his very religious mother.  
The devil certainly would have required less.
Other jokes have to do with poverty, such as dealing with a bill 
collector when you can't pay.  ("'When should I expect payment,' the 
bill collector wanted to know.  'You pick the date and then we'll both 
be surprised.'")
Other bits of humor illustrate the differences in racial experiences.  
Anorexia may be a common problem with white girls, but, in a black 
household, it can only mean that the father has lost his job.  And 
bungee jumping.  No way would a black engage in that.  It's way too much 
like lynching.
The humor is foul-mouthed and quite raunchy, but it comes across as 
remarkably sweet, nevertheless.  Perhaps, it is because the comedians 
are so good-spirited and frank.  One of my favorites has Harvey 
bemoaning the lack of "old school music."  As the audience literally 
dances in the aisles, he plays some of this music.  He contrasts the old 
school's homages to love with hip-hop's obsession with violence.  His 
final putdown concerns the numbers of microphones.  The Temptations, he 
said, shared a single mike, whereas the rappers each have their own mike 
and still are unintelligible.
Lee has the camera panning the audience to give the movie some of the 
electric energy and fast-paced spontaneity that the members viewing the 
concert live must have felt.  Less successful are his sequences filmed 
off stage, before and during the concert.  These scenes feel staged and 
awkward.
The movie attempts racial humor that most people would avoid with the 
proverbial ten-foot pole.  (There won't ever be a black president 
because he couldn't deal with a 7 trillion dollar national debt, laughs 
Cedric the Entertainer.  "Tell 'em, I ain't got it.  Ask 'em if they'd 
take a post-dated check," he says is what a black president would say.)
But there is also celebration of black achievement.  Since Tiger Woods 
has made it in golf, the other sports are soon to be similarly 
conquered.  What will be their secret in downhill skiing?  They'll 
eschew skis and just wear "church shoes."
THE ORIGINAL KINGS OF COMEDY runs 1:57.  It is rated R for language and 
sex related humor and would be fine for older teenagers.

Stand-up comedy isn't as simple as a comedian standing on a stage with a 
microphone trying to get the audience to laugh. It's now an interactive 
almost physical game with the audience so that their participation can 
overshadow the comedian's material. When you go to see "The Original Kings of 
Comedy" in a cinema your audience will probably act a lot like the one in the 
movie, except that the comedian can't hear them and this will make or break 
the experience for you. 
Live comedy now seems to be the outlet for which performers and audiences can 
go to for straight-up blatant jokes about really risque subject matters and 
jokes that can't be delivered in a fictional medium. Comedians today have to 
be as in-your-face and outrageous as possible to work a crowd, especially a 
concert hall crowd. And with black comedians in front of a predominately 
black audience it's bonding experience. It's very emotional and unrestricted 
like a black church is, but here instead of everyone praising God they're 
laughing at themselves via the comedians' hardcore material (it's the 
forbidden fruit of the modern age). The material and the performance isn't 
insulting (at least not intentionally), it's a method that uses humility as a 
character builder. You have to be able to laugh at yourself. I'm sure God has 
a sense of humor but I doubt He would approve of the material here. 
The movie is basically a filmed concert of the same title starring four black 
comedians who are rising stars in Hollywood: Steve Harvey, D.L. Hughley, 
Cedric "The Entertainer" and Bernie Mac. The film opens with some 
behind-the-scenes documentary-style of the four talking about the show and 
themselves and how they relate to each other. There's also little vignettes 
between performers showing the four talking directly to the camera although 
they don't really say much they just kind of ramble. There isn't much point 
to these because they aren't quite that funny, they just seem like 
time-filler. 
As for the show itself it's quite funny. Harvey is the opening comedian and 
the emcee of the show and gets the most screen time. He is the most 
interactive with the audience and really gets to the heart of the crowd by 
pointing out some people making jokes about them. At one point he even gets 
the jacket of an audience member and spoofs him after he leaves his seat. 
Harvey's actual material discusses characteristics of being an 
African-American and makes a lot of really funny jokes about topics that 
would be depressing. 
D.L. Hughley is next and seems to have the shortest set. His material is 
mostly personal but it's stuff you can relate to, well, sex stuff that is. He 
also works the crowd very well by picking people out and making fun of them. 
He's not being mean because he's so aloof and over-the-top you can't take it 
seriously (although I wouldn't want to be one of the people he points at). 
Cedric "The Entertainer" is third and probably has the funniest and most 
lighthearted material ("light" compared to the three others'). Most of his 
set deals with the differences between blacks and whites in America. He's 
successfully able to break down subjects that are pretty serious and make 
them funny such as the subconscious desire for confrontation and hostility 
blacks have and whites don't (his words not mine!). His bit on why black men 
don't play hockey is great although I would have liked more. 
Closing the show is Bernie Mac, the most vulgar and outrageous of the four. 
His material is just as funny as the others but a little disturbing. He raps 
about what it's like to be a parent of young black children today and how 
black parents have a tendency to be totally honest and crude with their kids. 
He also talks about how black parents aren't at all afraid to smack their 
kids around when they need discipline ("If you're old enough to talk back 
you're old enough to get hit" is his rationale). Still, it's a bit disturbing 
at how much the audience relates to and laughs along with his bits about 
being mean to kids and other people. There's a whole book worth of 
conservative commentary to write just about Mac's material alone but I'm not 
going to even bother with it. 
I guess what it all comes down to is that "The Original Kings of Comedy" is 
clearly aimed at the African-American demographic and makes no apologies for 
it. If you're white (like me), you WON'T be able to relate to the material as 
well and thus not laugh as hard and/or be insulted. But don't take it 
personally, everything here is done in relatively good spirits and isn't 
meant to provoke anyone (if it were the audience would probably boo the 
comedians for every other joke). It's not surprising Spike Lee directed and 
produced this film - it says a lot of the same social commentaries as his 
other films, only this time it's right to your face and there's nothing 
subtle about it.

This Steve Harvey-hosted comedy concert flick props up D.L. Hughley, Cedric
the Entertainer and Bernie Mac on a Charlotte, NC stage. (BTW, It's directed
and produced by Spike Lee at Four Acres and a Mule.)
Shot on videotape, the image quality suffers (the center wide shot blurring
these comics faceless). Still as the humor heats up, it's easy to forget
about this technical shortcoming.
Director Spike Lee, on the up and up, cuts up these stand-up cut-ups nicely
with backstage and "just hangin'" shots of the quick to quip quartet.
The first half of the film coasts with no big laughs, but Cedric's
appearance on the stage steps up the pace and the funnies. Then Bernie Mac's
aggressive almost terrorist humor will be sure to get you rolling - unless
you're a PC person. Mac is so "in your face," perhaps when TV/Cable finally
overcomes their fear of him, he'll have his own show called "The Bernie Mac
Attack."
Oddly enough, the topical nature of these four occasionally overlaps.
Especially noticeable the subject of "old school music" vs. hip-hop rap
culture and the phenomenon regarding events in which white people die in
masses, but black people never do. Highlights include: Hughley's observation
on while white people are always looking for something exciting to do ...
black people find regular things exciting enough ... like "pulling out my
wallet without getting shot forty one times," Harvey's impersonation of
rappers, Cedric's re-write of "Redemption Song," And Mac's school bus ride.
Sex and cussing are repeated motifs. In fact, the film ends on Mac's "MF"
injected monologue (which by the way, isn't as funny as the school bus bit).
But despite the obscenities, a small segment on the "old tunes" being all
about "love" gives the entire piece an overall warm heart.

 The Original Kings of Comedy (2000) 3 stars out of 4. Starring Steve
Harvey, D.L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer and Bernie Mac. Directed by
Spike Lee. Rated R.
 "The Original Kings of Comedy "is a raw, funny concert film
spotlighting four of the funniest black comedians on the circuit today -
Steve Harvey, D.L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer and Bernie Mac.
 This is an interesting experience, not so much for the four gentlemen
named above, who all are very fine comedians. No, it is more for the
cultural significance of this venture.
 It is interesting to compare this concert film with Richard Pryor's
groundbreaking 1979 `Live in Concert' movie.
 My, how times have changed. The language is still as biting as it was
20-plus years ago. In fact, Bernie Mac delivers an entire riff on the
word `motherf ...,' explaining why black people like to use it so much.
 But the anger of Pryor's time concerning the gap between blacks and
whites  has subsided, replaced by a bemused indulgence as if the
Caucasian race was a beat behind and not quick enough to get the joke.
 That is not to say that this quartet of well-dressed funnymen don't do
a number on the foibles of blacks.
 Harvey, for instance, begins by spoofing the hit film "Titanic,"
ridiculing the concept of the band staying on board and playing until
the ship sinks. Black musicians, he says, would have dropped their
instruments, grabbed the nearest piece of furniture for ballast and dove
in.
 Harvey then berates rap music, explaining his love for the `old school'
- as he calls the sounds of the soul groups of the 60s and 70s. He
doesn't like going to rap concerts because it's too much work, he
explains.
The singers always are barking out orders: clap yo' hands, get on your
feet, feel the groove.
 All poor Harvey wants to do is sit back and enjoy the music.
 This is the tenor of the routines by the talented foursome.
 Watching the comedians interact with the audience brings to mind a
church service. The fervor and love in which the Charlotte, N.C., crowd
embraces these men is akin to a clergyman-congregation relationship.
 Director Spike Lee intercuts several audience reaction shots, and as
you watch, you feel as if he is more interested in the byplay between
performer and customer than in the actual comedic routines.
 And he probably is. After all, Harvey, Hughley, Cedric and Bernie Mac
are not doing anything differently than they've done on various comedy
specials on HBO, Showtime or some other cable network.
 It's not the comedy that is the main focus, but the cultural
phenomenon. The audience inspires the comedians, urging them on,
applauding, shouting encouragement and agreement, recognizing and
laughing at themselves in the various descriptions of black life
spotlighted by the standups.
 Cedric regales the crowd with his explanation of why there isn't a
black president, going on to explain how a black leader would handle a
billion-dollar deficit, and the audience explodes.
 Unfortunately, "The Original Kings of Comedy" will probably have a
limited appeal. I saw it with a mostly black preview audience, who
howled, stomped and clapped, enjoying themselves immensely.
 I would urge others to take a chance. You may surprise yourself and
laugh along with the rest of us.

Bring It On (2000) 1 1/2 stars out of 4.. Starring Kirsten Dunst, Eliza
Dushku, Jesse Bradford and Gabrielle Union. Written by Jessica
Bendinger. Directed by Peyton Reed. Rated PG-13.
 Probably the one saving grace of "Bring It On" is its sincerity.
 After all, this is a story about cheerleaders - usually a target of
cinematic ridicule - and their struggles to make it to the national
championships in Orlando, Fla.
 Admittedly, the plot isn't "War and Peace." This is just a silly,
formulaic movie with stock characters who are pretty to ogle.
 The photography is well lit, the film's score is bouncy and the cast
plays it straight. It avoids the pitfalls of tackiness and sexism.
 The story centers around the Rancho Carne High School cheerleading
squad in San Diego. The squad has won the national championship five
consecutive years. Now, under the leadership of newly appointed captain
Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst), the Toros squad will shoot for title
No. 6.
 But Torrence makes a disturbing discovery. The squad's routines had
been stolen from the Clovers, a hip-hop squad from East Compton, by the
Toros' former captain.
 Thus Torrance must create enough confidence in herself and her squad's
abilities to devise all new routines to carry them to the championship.
 Meanwhile Isis (Gabrielle Union), the driven captain of the Clovers,
must concoct a way for her squad to raise money to attend the nationals
so they can gain the recognition they so richly deserve.
 "Bring It On" does have a certain innocent charm to it, despite its
PG-13 rating. The sexual innuendo is limited to the cheerleading
routines.
 The movie's main flaw is that most of the characters, especially the
Toros girls, are types.
 But this is not the fault of the performers, but of writer Jessica
Bendinger.
 Dunst, who made a startling film debut in "Interview With the Vampire,"
and since then has gone on to do fine work in such films as "Little
Women," "Drop Dead Gorgeous" and the made-for-cable drama "Devil's
Arithmetic," is smart, honest and inventive as Torrance.
 the school has no gymnastics program. Dushku, best known for her role
as Faith in WB's "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," plays Torrance's new best
friend who opens her eyes to the Toros' former captain's perfidy.
 Acting honors, though, go to Union as the tough, self-sufficient Isis
who fights to bring her squad to the nationals.
 "Bring It On" is very lightweight fare. Honestly, who takes
cheerleading - or cheerleaders - seriously. The good folks at Universal,
though, in trying to emphasize the importance of cheerleading enclosed a
fact sheet in the press kit that includes a list of famous people who
were cheerleaders. Among the names, Madonna, Kathie Lee Gifford, Donna
Rice, Alicia Silverstone, Meryl Streep, Paula Adbul, Halle Berry and
Sheryl Crow.
 Come on, studio folks. It's only a movie - loud, colorful, but
feathery, with limited appeal for those who believe cheerleading is the
alpha and omega of their existence.
