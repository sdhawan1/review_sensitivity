A "B+" for surprisingly solid acting and dialogue. But since the plot line
is a road we've traveled countless times before, there's no unpredictable
twists to jerk the film out of the clutches of mediocrity.
Teen next door neighbors, Nicole and Chase, feign a loving high school
couple in order to attract the real objects of their hearts affection -- you
know, through jealousy. But the scam may backfire -- could they accidentally
fall for each other? Ya think? Of course the whole thing climaxes (though
that's a strong word) at the Centennial dance (a teen flick prom
substitute).
The most interesting parts of the story get lost: Chase is a sub-culture,
anti-conformist who delights (along with two buds) in making fun of the
preppy crowd. Nicole is deep into the "in" crowd. Their coupling puts Chase
into Dockers and tames his wild head of hair. Says his ex, "Did you fall in
love or just fall into the Gap?" How he reacts to his new "prep" pals is
very interesting. However, only once he brings Nicole into his culture --
her reactions there are rich as well. Unfortunately, all of this gets run
over by the steamroller of a predictable plot. It is only the solid
performances, direction, dialogue and editing that keep the film from
flat-lining.
But I'm an old fart, perhaps the unknowing teen will be waiting on the edge
of her seat to see if Chase and Nicole "really really" work out.

Every other week of late brings another generic teen comedy to our local
movie theaters.  With interchangeable plot points and photogenic young
actors, most of them share the same remarkable blandness.  This week's
entry is John Schultz's DRIVE ME CRAZY.  Lamer than most, it does manage
to rise above the worst of the genre, flicks such as the unbearable
JAWBREAKER.
In my generation it was silly surfer movies that the studios put out by
the dozens in order to attract those lucrative teen audiences, flush
with cash and ready to spring for lots of refreshments at the concession
stand.  The latest slew of teen movies is no worse than the old surfer
ones and no better.  Think of them all as representative of a class of
movies that are the cinematic equivalent of elevator music.  They pass
the time and rarely offend.
DRIVE ME CRAZY takes place at a high school about to celebrate its
centennial year, which means -- are you sitting down? -- the movie will
end in a -- surprise! -- big prom.  There have been so many proms this
year that one feels underdressed in the theater without a tux or a prom
dress.
The story concerns two next-door neighbors, Nicole (Melissa Joan Hart)
and Chase (Adrian Grenier), who used to share the same tree house when
they were little.  Now seniors, they don't like each other anymore.
When Nicole isn't asked to the prom as planned by the school's hottest
jock, she asks the disheveled Chase to help her out.  If he'll go with
her, she suggests she'll treat him to some sex as a reward.  To make it
look genuine, he'll have to get cleaned up, and they'll have to act like
they're an item.
Think they'll end up falling in love for real?  Well, duh!
And will there be several scenes of underage drinking and binging?  Of
course.  This movie tries to make it seem more harmless by having one
kid, Dave (Mark Webber) be the school's designated driver.  He provides
free taxi service to all of those too drunk to drive.  Poor Dave gets
ridiculed for taking such a demeaning job.  Being considered a loser,
Dave, you can be sure, will eventually be fixed up by the script with a
gorgeous girl as his compensation.
The completely predictable and uneventful story ends with a small twist
that would have provided a good starting point for a more substantial
comedy.  But it might have demanded some intelligence on the part of the
viewers, something Rob Thomas's significantly underdeveloped script
avoids like the plague.
This much can be said.  Even if their acting in this movie isn't much,
Hart and Grenier seem to be having a good time.  Too bad the same can't
be said of most of the audience.
DRIVE ME CRAZY runs 1:34.  It is rated PG-13 for teen alcohol and drug
use and for language.  It would be acceptable for most teenagers.

Drive Me Crazy (1999) by John Sylva    Rating: C+
http://twowebmasters.cjb.net (OPENING NOVEMBER 16th!)
1999 has definitely set a new record.  For the first quarter of the year, a
teen film was released almost every week, the majority of them ending in a prom
sequence. During the summer, only one or two were released, and it appeared
that Hollywood had moved on.  Well, in the tradition of Arnold Schwarzenegger's
annoying yet classic line, "I'll be back," the teen genre is back for the fall,
but hopefully not for long.  Director John Schultz brings us Drive Me Crazy, an
ordinary teen film, with the ordinary premise, and the ordinary soundtrack,
which includes tracks by teen favorites, the Backstreet Boys and Britney
Spears.  
Drive Me Crazy is yet another film that teens will flock to, because they know
in movies such as this one, the character's worlds are perfect- they have
thousands of dollars for clothes, their dances are fancier than the Academy
Awards, and they are completely happy and satisfied with their life- they will
be able to escape their non-perfect lives, and become the perfect characters in
the film for an hour and a half.  Films like Drive Me Crazy are for teens only,
as their portrayal of high school and teen life is just a metaphor, but those
who attend these films want to so they can live that metaphor.
The premise of Drive Me Crazy (which is derived from the novel How I Created My
Perfect Prom Date by Todd Strasser) sounds like the opposite of last winter's
fun teen comedy, She's All That.  In She's All That, a guy gives a girl a
make-over as a bet to make the dorkiest girl in the school into a prom queen,
and in Drive Me Crazy, the girl is making over the guy.  You could call this
one, He's All That, eh?  Melissa Joan Hart stars as Nicole Maris, popular,
peppy student at Timothy Zonin High School, who is eagerly awaiting the
Centennial Dance, a dance celebrating the 100th anniversary of the school.  In
her perfect plan, basketball star Brad (Gabriel Carpenter) is going to ask her
to the event of a lifetime, and they will have the night of their lives- but
who does he ask?  A cheerleader who he accidentally falls on while playing in a
basketball game.  
At the same time, class clown Chase Hammond (Adrian Grenier) has been dumped by
his goth girlfriend Dulcie (Ali Larter).  One night after returning from a
party, he gets a call from his next door neighbor, who happens to be the now
dateless Nicole, who proposes that they go to the Centennial together, and
convince everyone that they're an item, but she has to "clean him up" first. 
Chase agrees, and he gets a new wardrobe from Nicole, changes his way of life,
and now hangs with the "in" crowd, along with Nicole.  Will their agreement
turn into something more?  It's a feel good teen movie, what do you honestly
think?
Melissa Joan Hart and Adrien Grenier give surprisingly strong performances as
their desperate characters who start falling for each other in this
predictable, cliche, yet entertaining film.  Hart, who will hopefully break
into mainstream film after her role here, has had a more than respectable
career- she starred in the cult Nickelodeon show "Clarissa Explains It All"
from 1991-1994, is currently starring in the popular show, "Sabrina: The
Teenage Witch," and had a minor, yet hilarious role in the underrated 1998 teen
party film, Can't Hardly Wait.  Drive Me Crazy is Hart's first leading actress
credit, and she handles herself quite nicely, for a teeny-bopper movie.  Hart
effectively expresses every day teen emotions with the same sort of Scream-ish,
Dawson's Creek-ish edge that makes films such as this one so entertaining. 
After seeing Drive Me Crazy, the question arises- Can Hart act outside of the
teen genre?  So far, my answer would be no, as at the age of 23, she hasn't
shown any extreme talent.  If Hart wants any sort of career past the age of 25,
she needs to get off her current television show.  Now.
Drive Me Crazy packs on the usual situations, jokes, and characters that the
majority of today's teen films do.  It follows the same formula the majority of
the teen films do- Boy meets girl, they fall in love, they get in a fight, and
then comes the always predictable conclusion.  Rob Thomas' fun, yet flawed
script, suffers only two major flaws that make the film less entertaining than
most teen films- an overly exaggerated character that goes around stealing her
friend's boyfriends, and the parents of the our two main teens are constantly
questioning if their children are on drugs, and don't pay attention to them
excluding their rude accusations.  Although flawed, the script has positive
morals galore, and makes for an enchanting, inspiring film for teens.
The Bottom Line: In the tradition of 80's films like the classic, Sixteen
Candles, Drive Me Crazy is a hip, yet mediocre film, and for teens ONLY.

Occasionally an adolescent romantic comedy will unexpectedly
break out of the mould and cleverly subvert the formula (Clueless,
Election, etc).  Drive Me Crazy, on the other hand, steers an
unadventurous course through a succession of clichés that will be
immediately obvious to audiences who sat through last year's
procession of bland, formulaic teen comedies.  Drive Me Crazy shares
numerous thematic and plot similarities with films such as She's All
That, 10 Things I Hate About You and even Never Been Kissed.
While tracing the tricky path of adolescent love, Drive Me
Crazy also explores the bitchy politics of high school.  Drive Me
Crazy offers up yet another exploration of the hierarchy of high
school, from the jocks to the geeks, the elite in-crowd to the
outcasts who desperately want to be accepted, from the cool to the
uncool.  There is also plenty of jealous plotting and subterfuge that
inevitably comes to a head during the climactic school dance.  This
clueless comedy has been written by Rob Thomas, one of the writers on
popular teen soap Dawson's Creek, but it is rather superficial stuff
that lacks any real insight or freshness.
Nicole (played with some charm but a lack of real charisma by
Melissa Joan Hart, better known as TV's teenage witch Sabrina) and
Chase (Adrian Grenier) have lived next door to each other all their
lives, but their childhood friendship has cooled.  When Nicole tries
to make Brad, the hunky but vapid school basketball champ, jealous,
she enlists Chase's help.  She pretends that she and Chase are an
item.  Chase is initially willing to go along with the scheme because
he has just been dumped by his shrewish girl friend, and hopes to make
her jealous as well.  Nicole gives Chase a make over and introduces
him into the school's elite, which gradually alienates him from his
friends.
But sparks fly, and the pair discover that there is a
chemistry between them, which leads to further complications.  Drive
Me Crazy essentially follows a paint by numbers scenario, and most
audiences will be able to predict the outcome of this tangled web of
adolescent lust and romance well before the climax.  John Schultz, who
gave us the moderately interesting Bandwagon last year, directs this
material in surprisingly lacklustre fashion.
This innocuous and decidedly lightweight comedy will certainly
appeal to its target audience, but adult audiences will probably find
that it drives them to distraction.

Cast: Melissa Joan Hart, Adrien Grenier, Stephen Collins, Faye Grant 
Written by: Rob Thomas 
Based on the novel "How I Created My Perfect Prom Date" written by: Todd
Strasser 
Directed by: John Schultz 
Running Time: 91 minutes 
The Law of Crowd Pleasing Romantic Movies states that the two leads
must end up together by film's end.  If you're not familiar with this
law, then maybe you've seen the trailer for this film which SHOWS that
the two leads are together by film's end.  Now if you're a regular
reader of mine, you've heard me say this countless times: You know how
Drive Me Crazy is going to end, but is the journey to get to that
ending worth it?  No, it definitely is not.
Melissa Joan Hart (from ABC's "Sabrina, the Teenage Witch") likes a
hunky stud on the basketball team.  Adrien Grenier is her grungy
neighbor who's just broken up with his activist girlfriend.
Apparently he wants to make his ex-girlfriend jealous enough to take
him back, and she wants someone to take her to the big year end dance.
So the two pretend to date for some reason, but only after Hart gives
Grenier a bath to turn him into a hunky stud.  Will Grenier like his
new popularity and turn on his friends?  Will this crazy scheme work?
Do I care?
The teen comedy resurgence of late has been surprisingly good in terms
of comedy.  What makes movies like Can't Hardly Wait and 10 Things I
Hate About You work (and to a lesser extent, She's All That and Never
Been Kissed)is because the writers of those films seem to realize that
high school is a joke and write their scripts accordingly. I don't
know what the writer's intention was with Drive Me Crazy.  There was
some smart comedy in those films to make the obvious endings worth
getting to.  Here there's nothing... just teens whining about who's
going to take them to the big dance.  Do me a favor kids, go get a job
or something... just shut the hell up.
In all honesty, the best part of this film is the end credits.  Now
normally when I say that it's followed with the joke "...because the
movie is finally over."  In this case though the end credits really
are the most entertaining part of the film.  After the obligatory
second playing of Britney Spears' titular song, there's a quick
commercial jingle for a burger joint the kids in the film hang out in
and a brief rendition of the school song for their high school.
Nothing great, but more entertaining than anything in the 90 minutes
which preceded them.
Sci-fi fans take note: there are brief appearances from Stephen
Collins (Star Trek:The Motion Picture) and Faye Grant (the TV
miniseries "V" and "V:The Final Battle").  [PG-13]

IN SHORT: A teen dateflick, and not a bad bit of story either.
Anybody want to talk Generation Gap? Cranky walked in to the sneak of
Drive Me Crazy, thinking it's title was copped from a Fine Young
Cannibals song back around '86 but, no, it turns out it's from a Britney
Spears song. Oh God, I feel so old. Even worse when it's pointed out
that one of the parental units in this flick graduated from High School
the year before I did. If I had followed my breeder instincts, I could
be lugging my teenkids to the screening (and they, of course, would want
me hiding in the back so they could disavow all knowledge of my
actions). I didn't, so I'm stuck with my fingers in the popcorn while
the kidlets cackle all around me.
And cackle they did. Other aged reviewers were muttering "two weeks and
it's on video" which may be true, but the story is solid and better
written than a lot of the stuff we sit through, and there are enough
demographically targeted jokes (ie. things I didn't get) that Drive Me
Crazy will probably find its proper audience.
Rather than centering around the prom, and all its associated angst and
anxiety, the big party for the students of Timothy Zonin High is the
school's Centennial Celebration. Pretty and popular and on the
Organizing Committee is perky Nicole Maris (Melissa Joan Hart) who, for
all her good points, is still waiting for basketball star Brad (Gabriel
Carpenter) to ask her out. Next door neighbor Chase Hammond (Adrian
Grenier), formerly Nicole's pal and now just the guy next door, prefers
to hang out with the intellectual crowd at the local college coffee bar.
A spat with lust of his life Dulcie (Ali Larter) which coincidentally
hits about the time that Brad asks a rival school's cheerleader to the
Ball, pairs our kidlets in a scheme to win back the perceived loves of
their lives.
Nicole transforms Chase from a Geek to a GapKid, to the horror of his
net-surfin', eGamer friends. She, in turn, learns a true lesson about
the real nature of love. Both of them, to their horror, discover that
parental units have love lives too (in this case played out by Faye
Grant and Stephen Collins as Nicole's divorced parents and William
Converse-Roberts as Chase's widowed dad). There's a full span of kidlet
types filling in the gaps, and all the acting is professional and to the
point. The target is kids. The soundtrack is for kids and the kids
around me munched their popcorn and candy and went home happy. Game
over.
Parents out there who e-mail me about sex and language in these
teenflicks need not worry. There's no nudity and the language isn't any
worse than it was when we were in high school two decades back.
<sigh>
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Drive Me Crazy, he would have
paid...
It's a dateflick for the teens. Painless but way out of the market for
us old fogeys.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Coinciding with the controversial appearance of its star's near-nude
turns on the covers of Maxim and Bikini, Drive Me Crazy literally drove
me crazy with a horrible, formula-driven script and a lead performance
that was even worse.  It's the tried-and-true story of a guy and girl
that pretend to be in love in order to regain the affection of their
exes, only to end up falling for each other.  Oh, Christ  I hope that
didn't ruin the ending for you.  The name was changed from Next to You,
presumably to include the smash hit `Crazy' from the saline-assisted
teen pop star Britney Spears.
The girl is Nicole Maris (Melissa Joan Hart, Sabrina the Teenage Witch),
the peppy, popular (read: annoying) senior responsible for organizing
Timothy Zonin High School's Centennial events.  Nicole lives with her
single mom (Faye Grant, V) and has little contact with the father that
ran out on them (Stephen Collins, 7th Heaven).  She also contributes the
school's news broadcast  called Time Zone  each morning at the
beginning of the day.  Nicole's biggest problem in life is that she is
seriously crushing on TZ's star basketball player, Brad (Gabriel
Carpenter).  But don't worry  he asks her to the big Centennial dance.
The guy is Chase Hammond (Adrian Grenier, The Adventures of Sebastian
Cole), the dark, brooding senior that thinks popularity is superfluous,
referring to most students as `sheep.'  He lives with his widower pop
(William Converse, Kiss the Girls) and dates a gothy vamp named Dulcie
(Ali Larter, Varsity Blues).  A practical joker, Chase put orange dye in
the school's sprinkler system and roared with laughter as the brightly
dressed TZ `sheep' were doused with colored water.  In his defense,
orange is the school's color, and he was just being spirited.
Long story short, Brad dumps Nicole for a cheerleader from a rival
school, while Chase is dumped by Dulcie because he doesn't want to talk
all the time (and I thought goth chicks were above that).  The dumpees
band together to get their respective exes jealous.  She gives him a
mall make-over and takes him to basketball games, while he drags her to
a club called The Pit to ponder stuff.  They both fit in to their new
roles way too easily, especially Chase, who in no time is cheering `GO!
FIGHT!  WIN!' at a school basketball game.  I thought they might have
been chanting ` GO FRIGHTWIG!' which would have been an interesting arc
in the film.
Two points of interest in the film include the appearance of punk
rockers The Donnas (as The Electro-Cutes, covering `Keep On Lovin' You,'
no less) and a nifty video segment that a nerdy AV kid sneaks onto the
Time Zone broadcast.  There is also an interesting angle to the picture,
in that Nicole and Chase are neighbors and former treehouse-mates that
saw their friendship dissolve during middle school and the onset of
popularity's importance.  She remembers his mom dying, but was too cool
to offer condolences at the time.
Drive Me Crazy is based on Todd Strasser's novel titled `How I Created
My Perfect Prom Date' and adapted for the screen by Cookie's Fortune
hack Rob Thomas.  The nicest thing I can say about Hart's performance is
that she does not have a face that was made for the big screen.
Possibly radio, but not FM.  She struggles to be merely adequate in her
role, while the adorably talented Grenier is so painfully above this
crappy material, it actually makes the movie much less enjoyable.  And
that is really saying something.
1:35 - PG-13 for teen alcohol consumption and drug use, and for mild
adult language

If 1999 should go down in movie history for anything, it shouldn't be for the 
eagerly-awaited release of "Star Wars, Episode 1: The Phantom Menace" 
because, let's face it, people didn't seem to care about the film after they 
had seen how mediocre it really was. And although one of the year's few true 
masterpieces, it shouldn't be for Stanley Kubrick final motion picture, "Eyes 
Wide Shut," because it was overhyped and generally disappointed the average 
moviegoer expecting a sex-filled romp instead of the slow, contemplative 
"art" film it really was. No, what 1999 should be known for is the full-blown 
explosion of that timeless genre known as the "teen" movie. As is the case, 
not all were very good (the vapid "She's All That," the empty "Varsity 
Blues"), but some turned out to be the best since John Hughes, circa the 
mid-1980's ("The Breakfast Club," "Sixteen Candles," "Pretty in Pink"), such 
as the brilliant satire, "Election," the smart "10 Things I Hate About You," 
the instant teen classic, "American Pie," and the slick "Cruel Intentions." 
All were released this past Spring or Summer, so John Schultz's "Drive Me 
Crazy," a sort of "She's All That" reversal, at least holds the distinction 
of being the sole "teen" movie of the Fall. 
Based on the book, "How I Created My Perfect Prom Date," by Todd Strasser, 
the film version is in limbo between the successful "teen" movies, and the 
not-so-successful. On its side is an occasionally adept screenplay and two 
likable characters that are more appealing than the story they have been 
stranded in. On the other side of the spectrum, "Drive Me Crazy" faithfully 
follows the same stringent formula that most of these movies have, and it is 
instantly forgettable due to its own stubborn banality, and the inability to 
have many distinguishable qualities among the large crop of similar films.
The premise goes like this: Nicole Maris (Melissa Joan Hart), one of the most 
popular seniors at Timothy Zonin High School, is in the middle of preparing 
the big Centennial Dance, the 100-year anniversary of the school. She has her 
close eye on the star of the basketball team, Brad (Gabriel Carpenter), but 
when he falls for someone else, Nicole finds herself dateless for the dance. 
That's where her next-door neighbor and fellow classmate, Chase Hammond 
(Adrian Grenier), comes into the picture. A rebellious slacker type, Chase 
and Nicole used to be best friends until they hit middle school and drifted 
apart into their differing cliques, but now Nicole wants his help, and since 
his own girlfriend, Dulcie (Ali Larter), has just dumped him, he accepts. 
Buying him a whole new, stylish wardrobe, Chase starts to hang out with 
Nicole at school functions and her group of friends, and to his own surprise, 
he begins to enjoy it, including the company of Nicole. In the process, 
however, Chase seems to little-by-little forget about his old group of 
buddies, who are left waiting in the wings. Complications ensue, some truths 
will be spoken, the Centennial Dance arrives at the climax, and no awards 
will be given out to those who can guess how everything is sure to turn out.
If Chase had been paid by Nicole, "Drive Me Crazy" would almost be a carbon 
copy of 1987's "Can't Buy Me Love," a more-sappy, but also more satisfying, 
"teen" picture. Without that added gimmick, however, the storyline is easier 
to swallow and graciously spares us a lot of melodramatic speeches that 
plagued "Can't Buy Me Love." 
In her very first starring role in a feature film, Melissa Joan Hart (TV's 
"Sabrina, The Teenage Witch") is one of the most engaging and fresh young 
actresses to appear in any of this year's "teen" movies, second to only the 
wonderful Julia Stiles in "10 Things I Hate About You." Beautiful in a 
non-Hollywood type of way, Hart is refreshingly not pencil-thin, has lots of 
freckles on her face, and her more normal physical appearance only helps the 
film so that you can easily identify with her, much like Jason Biggs did for 
"American Pie." Not only that, but Hart really is a fine actress that 
definitely has an acting future ahead of her, as she never mugs for the 
camera or uses exaggerated body language to express her emotions. 
Adrian Grenier, last seen in the independent "coming-of-age" film, "The 
Adventures of Sebastian Cole," is well-cast to play off of Hart, and together 
they have a certain amount of winning chemistry. Better yet, in his scenes in 
which he is apart from Hart, Grenier is natural and instinctive, so good he 
very rarely ever appears to be acting much at all.
If there is one aspect of "Drive Me Crazy" that screenwriter Rob Thomas gets 
exactly right, it is in his view of teenagers, and the relationships between 
the different cliques in school. The popular group are pleasingly not looked 
upon as easy stereotypes, and are seldom portrayed as the one-dimensional bad 
guys that so many films of this ilk fall victim to (paging "She's All That"). 
For the most part, a few of the supporting performances should be pin-pointed 
for the way they are able to create added levels to their characters, 
particularly Mark Webber, as one of Chase's friends who is carrying on a 
relationship via the internet with a mystery person from the school, and Keri 
Lynn Pratt, as Dee-Vine, a fellow classmate who got her nickname before she 
lost 40 lbs. Pratt, especially, is one of the most charming performers I've 
come across in many-a-moons, and her character is both instantly appealing 
and even poignant in one of the best scenes in the film, in which she is 
verbally assaulted and put down because of her past weight problem.  
The film is also often visually impressive, signalling unusually high 
production values for a clearly low-budget effort. A quiet, effective 
sequence between Nicole and her estranged father (Stephen Collins) is 
absolutely stunning, as it takes place on a hot-air ballon, high above the 
gorgeous green landscape. Several of the song choices, on the other hand, are 
far too teenybopperish, including Britney Spears' tune that the film was even 
named after. If anything, Spears' relation to the picture should aid the 
picture financially. Tellingly, my friend and I, both in our first year of 
college, instantly felt like elder statesmen once we set foot in the theater, 
overrun with middle school girls who giddily sang along to Spears and The 
Backstreet Boys, one of which went as far as to use hand motions as she 
belted out the songs!
"Drive Me Crazy" is enjoyable on a minor level, and nothing more. It is fun 
to watch simply for Hart and Grenier, but its one fatal flaw is its own 
needlessly generic nature. Aside from a couple scenes in which the film deals 
with domestic issues within families, and the way kids sometimes drift apart 
the older they get, the film is little more than adequate, not a total 
washout, but nothing that hasn't been recycled a thousand times before, and 
done more ambitiously.

Traffic advisory: plan alternate box office route to bypass DRIVE ME
CRAZY and gridlock of crazed teens.  At the screening I attended, it
would have been easier to find a share of internet IPO stock than an
open seat (I doubt the stingiest broker you know could be more ruthless
than the giddy girls saving seats for their friends).  If this romantic
comedy is successful, chalk up another victory for marketing and another
loss for pop culture.
A more appropriate title for DRIVE ME CRAZY would be `Highway Through
Nebraska'  the plot is flat, has no turns, and is completely devoid of
scenery.  At least this boring ride only lasts 90 minutes.  In this
rehashed tale of teen angst, next door neighbors Nicole Maris (Melissa
Joan Hart  CAN'T HARDLY WAIT, `Sabrina, the Teenage Witch,' `Clarissa
Explains It All') and Chase Hammond (Adrian Grenier  CELEBRITY, THE
ADVENTURE OF SEBASTION COLE) are neighbors with almost nothing in
common.  She's `in,' he's in the alternative crowd.  When the star of
the basketball team snubs her affection and he gets dumped, they find
common ground in a plot to scam everyone into thinking they are an
item.  If the plan works, they hope their ex-loves will come crawling
back.  Hmmm, care to take a wild guess what happens?
Chase Hammond did a fair job with his role, though the performances as a
whole were barely lukewarm.  Susan May Pratt's depiction of Nicole's
backstabbing friend provides a mild respite from DRIVE's many pitfalls,
including a soundtrack starring The Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears.
If you want to relive the adolescent experience of feeling trapped in a
situation you think will never end, DRIVE ME CRAZY can take you there.
Unfortunately, this is a result of the film's painfully slow and obvious
development, awkward performances, and completely unoriginal script.
Even Clarissa can't explain how a movie this bad made it to the screen.

The business in which I work is a nasty one.  It is one of politics and of
policies.  Of embargoes and emissaries.  Mostly, however, it is genres and
grading.  When grading a film, a thought brought into the forefront of your
mind is "should I do this on a curve?"  With a genre such as "the teen flick",
something so hack that is seems to conspire towards making critics unhappy,
grading on a curve would make an F an A.  Since there is such a dearth of
great teen flicks, and since the ones that up the curve are few and far
between, I do not grade teen flicks on a curve.  If I were, however, Drive Me
Crazy would still get an "F"
A note to the people in Hollywood: if you are seeking to devise a movie based
on a soundtrack, please be a little less obvious about it.  Use said song to
hype the movie but please don't share the title.  That's just stupid.  The
movies in which popular artist's songs share the name (or share the refrain,
in this case) of the movie are ones that rank right down their with using
"based on a true story" as a tag line (see Patch Adams).  They just don't fly
for me.
Also on the marketing, please put it in the sub-genre that it deserves.  In
this case, Drive Me Crazy was advertised as a teen comedy and ended up being
an oxy-moron: a teen drama.  The drama level in this is akin to watching a
marathon of the worst episodes of "Days of Our Lives."  It isn't worth the
price of the ticket.
The story of Drive Me Crazy is that of ultra-hip girl Nicole Maris (Melissa
Joan Hart), who's would-be boyfriend goes for someone else instead. 
Distraught over this, she goes to next door neighbor Chase Hammond (Adrian
Grenier), who was actually dumped by his girlfriend.  The implied proposition:
go to the centennial dance with me and I'll sleep with you.
I don't care if angry parents email me about encouraging amoral behavior in
teens until New York goes to sleep, but this is the implication in the movie. 
Of course, being Hollywood this is never out-and-out stated, but it is heavily
implied.  The fact that it refuses to paint teens as innocents (like most
PG-13 teen movies do) is Drive Me Crazy's only endearing quality.
Basically, the story goes along in an East-meets-West mentality as beatnik
Chase and socialite Nicole mix, mingle, fall in love, and rehash their days in
junior high.  The all predictably live happily ever after.  The end.

_Drive_Me_Crazy_ (PG-13) * (out of ****)
As the press notes are so eager to announce, _Drive_Me_Crazy_ takes its
title from "(You Drive Me) Crazy," the latest hit single by teen pop
phenomenon Britney Spears.  Since Fox went so far out of its way to
retitle the film for the tune (the original name was the more fitting but
Britney-inspiration-lacking _Next_to_You_), I will go through each of
this teen comedy's painfully pedestrian plot paces as it relates to the
song.
"Baby, I'm so into you/You got that something/What can I do?"  In-crowd
high school girl Nicole (Melissa Joan Hart) pines for star basketball
stud Brad (Gabriel Carpenter).  Similarly, her next-door neighbor (hence
the film's original title), outcast bad boy Chase (Adrian Grenier) is so
into his girlfriend Dulcie (Ali Larter).
"Baby, you spin me around/The earth is moving/But I can't feel the
ground."  Brad withdraws his invitation to Nicole to a big dance after he
falls for a cheerleader.  As coincidence would have it, around the same
time, Dulcie gives Chase the heave-ho.  Determined to win back their
respective paramours, Nicole and Chase--now made over into a clean-cut
popular guy--pretend to be a couple in order to incite jealousy in their
exes.
"Every time you look at me/My heart is jumpin'/It's easy to see/You
drive me crazy/I just can't sleep/I'm so excited/I'm in too deep/Oh oh
oh, crazy/But it feels all right/Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all
night."  Of course, Nicole and Chase find that their false attraction has
become real; as the song goes, in one scene, Chase, lost in thought about
Nicole, stays up an entire night.  With this easily foreseen turn of
events comes the major flaw of the screenplay by Rob Thomas.  The way
these mismatched couple movies are supposed to work is that once the
"ugly duckling" is made over, the other person falls for him/her--by
seeing through the slick veneer and taking a liking to his/her "true
self."  In this film, Nicole takes a liking to Chase once he starts
acting like the in-crowd and gradually erases all trace of his original
personality.  So much for not judging a book by its cover.
The film is not helped by Hart's accordingly shallow performance, which
never once convinces that there's anything more to Nicole than her
popular girl image.  Even more ruinous is the complete lack of chemistry
between her and Grenier, and Thomas and director John Schultz come up
with nothing else to hold the audience's attention; certainly not the
routine subplots, including nice guy Dave (Mark Webber)'s cyber romance
and the scheming of Nicole's so-called best-friend Alicia (Susan May
Pratt).  _Drive_Me_Crazy_ feels like another lackluster youth entry into
the new fall TV season, a point driven home by one touch that is amusing
for all the wrong reasons: there are a number of basketball scenes in the
film, and it's hard not to notice that on Brad's team and all the others
they play, every single player is Caucasian.
I was expecting _Drive_Me_Crazy_ to follow the same tactic that
_Dangerous_Minds_ used with its featured hit single, "Gangsta's
Paradise"--that is, milk it to death and then some, exploiting the
theatre's Dolby Digital sound system whenever possible to remind patrons
exactly what brought them into the theatre.  But it didn't; in fact, it
got to the point where I was actually _waiting_ for the song to blare on
the soundtrack.  (For the record, it is played for a brief moment
mid-film and then in its entirety during the end credits--the latter
instance inspiring some teenybopper girls in the audience to sing along
and dance in their seats.)   The fact that I was waiting for a Britney
Spears song to play speaks volumes about how incredibly boring this film
is.
