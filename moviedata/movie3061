     David Mamet originally came to the public's attention by
writing stories of hucksters and con men and corporate crime.  He
wrote stories like his mysterious play "The Water Engine," HOUSE OF
GAMES, and the Runyonesque THINGS CHANGE.  The man is a writer and a
director, and he wrote about crime as a personal interest.  Now he
has written a film about con men he really knows.  His STATE AND
MAIN in a large part about a con man a director and a nearly honest
and innocent writer coming to conflict over an adaptation of the
writer's play.  Mamet has sprinkled in a number of other characters
from film-making but he has written about things close to his own
experience.  The result is a sort of madcap comedy in which Mamet
the director gets to argue with Mamet the writer in the middle of
the chaos of making a film.
     Mamet gives us a view of the film-making process as being one
large, crazy circus.  The film the film company has come to town to
shoot is THE OLD MILL.  They had already been ready to film it in
New Hampshire and had a great mill set they actually built, but
something happened and, well, now they are filming in Waterford,
Vermont, instead.  Waterford was chosen because of its classic old
mill.  Unfortunately, they are not going to be able to use the mill
because, well, something else happened.  Now they are madly trying
to make things fit.
     At the center of the chaos, and few films make the film-making
process such a storm of chaos, is Walt Price (played by William H.
Macy) the Machiavellian director who will do absolutely whatever is
necessary to have a film all shot when the storm dies down.  Part
con man, part genius he jumps from one crisis to the next in
seconds, frequently changing his personality to fit the
circumstance.  The writer, Joseph Turner White (at last a starring
role for Philip Seymour Hoffman), would like to have Price's film be
at least reminiscent of the script he had written for it and the
play it was based on.  Meanwhile White finds himself attracted to
Ann Black (Mamet regular Rebecca Pidgeon), a townie who had read his
play and actually seems to understand it better than he does
himself.
     Meanwhile in the background the other cast and crew members are
adding to the confusion.  Adding to the confusion is a lead actress
(Sarah Jessica Parker) who has found religion and refuses to shoot
her nude scene and a heartthrob lead actor (Alec Baldwin) with a
predilection for strong drink and under-age girls.  Add to the mix a
totally unscrupulous producer (David Paymer) with a goal to save
money wherever he can and nearly as clever at getting what he wants
as Price is.  But the film has a large cast and several stories are
working themselves out at the same time.
     As is frequently the case, Mamet has carefully crafted a script
with a plethora of clever touches.  The film being made is based on
a play of pretentious claptrap, yet most of the themes of that play
are exemplified, and probably better, in the film STATE AND MAIN
itself.  The issues that the play is about are also the issues that
the filmmakers have to face.  Several of the decisions about the
film being made seem to be mirrored in the outer film.  Mamet
demonstrates a flair for one-liners that few of his previous films
have demonstrated.  The film is a treasure chest of running gags and
self-referential jokes.  Mamet's dialog is well-delivered if not
entirely realistic and believable.
     STATE AND MAIN covers territory previously covered by films
about shooting films like DAY FOR NIGHT and LIVING IN OBLIVION and
to a lessor extent films about the industry like THE BIG PICTURE and
THE PLAYER.  Still the script is one of the better ones of the pack.
I rate it 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the -4 to +4
scale.  And trust me on this one: you want to stay through the end
credits.
     Now I have done it.  I am going to get a bunch of people
writing me saying they walked out on the credits and asking what
they missed.  Do not read the following until you have seen the
film.  Here are jokes in the credits rotated 13 letters (rot13):

In a present that will be hard to top, STATE AND MAIN, by 
writer/director David Mamet (THE WINSLOW BOY), is a wonderful gift to 
moviegoers that comes to theaters this Christmas.  Possessing some of 
the same charm of an early Mamet film, the whimsical THINGS CHANGE from 
1988, STATE AND MAIN is a screwball comedy and good-spirited satire 
about filmmaking in small town America.
With such a great ensemble cast, it's hard to identify the story's star.  
To the extent that the film has one, it is Academy Award winner William 
H. Macy (FARGO) as the director of the film, THE OLD MILL, about to 
begin shooting in the tiny hamlet of Waterford, Vermont.  (The film 
company is broke after being run out of a small town in New Hampshire 
for unspecified reasons.)  Macy with his big blue eyes that are so deep 
that you could swim in them is at once delicately vulnerable and tough 
as nails.  His motto, as inscribed on his lucky pillow, is "Shoot first.  
Ask questions afterward."  Walt is a master at stroking his stars' 
massive egos, but he is willing to throw tantrums if necessary to get 
the movie made.
The male lead in Walt's film, Bob Berringer, played with charismatic 
wickedness by Alec Baldwin, has a predilection for 14-year-old girls, 
which has gotten him into trouble before.  "Everybody needs a hobby", 
Bob says smilingly of his illegal activities.  Walt, who always tries to 
please his cast, tells his assistant to get Bob half of a 28-year-old 
woman.  Walt tries to tell everyone what they want to hear.  "That's not 
a lie," he retorts when being caught in one.  "That's a gift for 
fantasy."
When Bob sets his eyes on a local girl named Carla (Julia Stiles), Carla 
hints at being under-aged, knowing his preferences.  Her exact age 
remains a bit of a mystery.  The story, in fact, takes great pleasure in 
throwing all manner of little mini-dramas and mysteries at us, leaving 
us to guess which will be dead ends and which will turn out to be 
significant.
Walt and his neophyte screenwriter, Joseph 'Joe' Turner White (Philip 
Seymour Hoffman), have problems aplenty, not the least of which is that; 
after choosing Waterford for its old mill, they find out that the mill 
burned down during a series of mysterious fires in 1960.  (Ah, those 
mysteries.)  Another problem is that the female lead, Claire (Sarah 
Jessica Parker from the "Sex in the City" television series), has found 
religion and is no longer willing to appear topless as clearly specified 
in her $3M contract.  Actually, she is willing for an extra $800,000 to 
bare her breasts.  This is all terribly ironic since her breasts have 
been on the screen so often that viewers "can draw them from memory" 
claims Walt and others.
Joe falls in love with Annie (Rebecca Pidgeon), the owner of the local 
bookstore.  Annie is fond of quoting lines that he has forgotten from 
Joe's own plays -- "If you weren't down, how would you know when you 
were up" -- in order to cheer him up and to inspire him.
Hearing of the trouble on the set, the film's take-no-prisoners 
producer, Marty (David Paymer), shows up to straighten everyone out.  
Putting his arms around Walt, Marty is heard to say off-screen, "Did you 
see the grosses for Gandhi 2?"  Marty brings Walt a very profitable 
product placement idea from a dot.com company.  Of course, getting a 
computer into a movie set in 1895 might prove difficult for someone less 
resourceful than Marty.
All of the crew are heavy cell phone users, but this is done cutely and 
not irritatingly as it was in HANGING UP.  After the latter film, I 
thought that I never wanted to see a cell phone in a movie ever again.
I've just barely scratched the surface of this story.  In a tour de 
force effort on Mamet's part, he manages to craft an enormous number of 
fully developed characters, all of whom win our hearts, even if most do 
have their faults.  His talent is never better seen than in the clever 
way in which he wraps up all of the story's loose ends.  STATE AND MAIN 
is the kind of big-hearted movie that's worth seeing again and again.
STATE AND MAIN runs a brisk 1:30.  It is rated R for language and brief 
sexual images but is considerably milder than most recent PG-13 movies.  
Although it is the parents' judgment, I would see no problem taking kids 
as young as 11.  In fact, I'd be happy to let my son, who is 11, see it.

Probably not the best title for a movie about the behind the scenes
shenanigans of a Hollywood picture filming in a small Vermont town, but with
gifted writer/director David Mamet at the helm, who am I to question
cinematic decisions? I was one of the lucky few to check out the premiere of
this film at the Montreal Film Festival and even got a picture with Mamet
himself (A gentleman who was nice enough to wait patiently as I fumbled
through my duffelbag looking for my camera...doh!). The only question that
remained to be answered was to which one of Mamet's previous comedies this
picture most related: would it be WAG THE DOG, the comedy hit or WE'RE NO
ANGELS, the comedy disaster. Let's find out...
PLOT:
A Hollywood production crew comes to a small town to film a movie starring a
very popular actor and a whining starlet. The process becomes more difficult
as the script constantly has to be re-written, the star has his eye on a
local teen girl and the starlet refuses to do the topless scene that she
agreed to do in her contract. It isn't long before the small town values
begin affecting some of its visitors and the Hollywood phoniness affects
everyone.
CRITIQUE:
I enjoy watching movies that deal with Hollywood and its behind the scenes
goings-on, and this one was no different. It certainly didn't blow me away
with any of its humor, but it was a nice, light comedy filled with several
interesting characters, a few really funny lines and an infectious
easy-going score. In fact, the clever lines alone were an easy step up from
any typical Hollywood tart romp, but on the whole, it still rode in a little
under my Mamet expectation meter. I had hoped for a lot more "bite"! The
film ran a little too long for its own good and spent too much time on a
relationship between a couple of the characters, who really weren't half as
funny or interesting as anyone else in the movie. For me, two of the
funniest personalities in the film were Alec Baldwin, who played the aloof,
conceited yet charming star to a tee (nice to have you back, Alec!), and
David Paymer, who must've channeled the spirit of Joel Silver for his role
as the arrogant, no holds barred producer. These two guys had some really
hilarious lines in the movie and obviously loved the roles that they were
playing.
I also liked the director in this movie inhabited perfectly by William H.
Macy and all of his backdoor phoniness, but I didn't think that there was
enough time spent with these three characters. Mamet decided to focus more
on the screenwriter and his dilemma in this story, and despite being a
writer myself, I didn't particularly care much for his predicament. The
greater point of the film was predictable early on, so I would have rather
they focused more on all of the characters, rather than just the one. But
that's honestly just a minor quirk in an overall decent film which should
definitely be seen by all who enjoy the behind the scenes game of Hollywood.
It reminded me a lot of MUMFORD and LIVING IN OBLIVION, with it being much
funnier than the former but not as funny as the latter. In the end, I don't
think this film is gonna blow anybody's socks off, but it certainly is a
nice change from all the poop-joke movies that've been shot our way of late.
It's small, it's cute, it's David Mamet-lite.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Actress Rebecca Pidgeon has been married to writer/director David Mamet
since 1991. She has starred in his last four directing gigs including this
film, CATASTROPHE (TV), THE WINSLOW BOY and THE SPANISH PRISONER. They have
one daughter together.
David Mamet won the Pulitzer prize in drama for GLENGARY GLEN ROSS. He was
co-writer of RONIN under the pseudonym Richard Weisz.
Alec Baldwin is also the executive producer on this project.
This is actor William H. Macy's fifth film collaboration with director David
Mamet.
This film was filmed entirely in Massachusetts. The small town used in the
film is Manchester, Mass.

Films about filmmaking always seem to play well with critics, and State
and Main isn't likely to be any different (for some reason, most critics
think they're in The Business).  David Mamet's (The Winslow Boy) seventh
directorial effort is a scathing, drop-dead hysterical look at the
out-of-touch insincerity of Hollywood and its uncanny ability to corrupt
everything it touches.
Main is set in tiny Waterford, Vermont, where the crew for a film called
`The Old Mill' has recently relocated after being kicked out of a
similar town in New Hampshire.  The film, which is supposed to be about
the search for purity set in the twilight of the 19th century, has
chosen Waterford not only for its sleepy, picturesque
porch-swing/white-picket-fence community, but also because the town is
home to two structures integral to the picture's plot  a mill and an
old firehouse.
Taking place in the week leading up the filming of `The Old Mill,' Main
features characters so real, so flawed and, for the most part, so
instantly dislikeable, it's hard not to find yourself immediately
wrapped up in their antics.  William H. Macy plays Walt Price, the
film's director, whose motto ("Shoot first  ask questions afterward')
is embroidered on a lucky pillow that he drags to each shoot.  Marty
Rossen (David Paymer, Bounce) is his producer, and the two men form an
intimidating pair with an aggressive manner surpassed only by their
ability to kiss the asses of their stars and trample the feelings of
pretty much everybody else.
The production of `The Old Mill' has plenty of hilarious stumbling
blocks to overcome before it begins principal photography.  The process
of casting extras for the film is at a standstill because of a local
play to which most of Waterford's citizens have already committed.  The
male lead (Alec Baldwin, Thomas and the Magic Railroad) has a thing for
underage girls and begins sniffing around a nubile young Waterford
native (Julia Stiles, Hamlet) as soon as he arrives in the small town.
The female star (Sarah Jessica Parker, Sex and the City) is balking at
her nude scene, despite the fact that it is clearly specified in her
contract.
On the more innocent side of things is Joseph Turner White (Philip
Seymour Hoffman, Almost Famous), the film's naďve
playwright-turned-screenwriter who is baffled by the behind-the-scenes
goings-on, not to mention the last-minute rewrites Price and Rossen
demand he make, even though they would completely change his original
script.  He meets a local bookseller (Rebecca Pidgeon  Mamet's
real-life wife), who becomes White's confidante and guiding light of
veracity.  Charles Durning (Everybody Loves Raymond) and Patti LuPone
(Summer of Sam) play Waterford's Mayor and his wife, who want only to
host an elaborate dinner party for the cast and crew of the film.
Throw in a big pothole on Waterford's Main Street, a local attorney with
political ambitions (What Lies Beneath screenwriter Clark Gregg), a
witty product-placement debate and a strange local catchphrase that the
filmies adopt as their own, and you'll start to wonder how Mamet was
able to pack all of this into a 90-minute film.  Heck, I was sad when it
ended, wishing it could continue for at least another 90.  The
writer/director's trademark hypnotically rhythmic salvos will do that
kind of thing to you.  The carefully written dialogue makes Main so much
more than just a classier, feature-film version of the short-lived
television show Action.
Another thing you can expect from a Mamet film is incredible acting
performances, and Main doesn't disappoint in that category, either.
Several actors could be in the hunt for Oscar nominations, especially
Hoffman, who plays his most normal (and most romantic) role to date as
the beleaguered screenwriter.  Main reminded me of the Mamet-penned Wag
the Dog, which also dealt with unscrupulous film folk and their
behind-the-scene shenanigans.  My only complaint (other than the short
running time) is a story thread involving the stained glass window of
Waterford's firehouse that goes unresolved.
If Kevin Bacon would only appear in one of Mamet's films, it would make
playing `The Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon' a lot easier.  With Main, Mamet
seems to borrow a majority of his cast from the regulars that turn up in
Paul Thomas Anderson's films.  Anderson, in turn, seems to do his
casting from the roster of acting talent involved in films made by the
Coen brothers.  Hoffman and Macy were both in Anderson's Magnolia and
the Coens' The Big Lebowski.  Ricky Jay and Gregg were also in Magnolia,
as well as Mamet's The Spanish Prisoner.  And Durning is in the Coens'
upcoming O Brother, Where Art Thou?, in addition to the film version of
Mamet's play, Lakeboat.

A Hollywood film crew invades the small town of Waterford, Vermont for its 
authenticity of an old-fashioned small American town where everyone knows 
each other's names, the firehouse is the same one used 100 years ago, and 
they have an old water mill. Problems arise when the screenwriter is called 
in to makes changes to the script on the fly because the old town is missing 
a few key landmarks and the starring actress doesn't want to do the nude 
scene. The film is also going over budget and the starring actor could be in 
big trouble with the law due to his craving for teenage girls. 
Writer/director David Mamet tells this story in the style of a classic stage 
play or musical, a la "Our Town" or "The Music Man." He keeps the atmosphere 
satirical which allows the comedy to work quite well. And yes, this is a 
comedy, but a thinking man's comedy where the jokes are derived from witty, 
biting jabs at Hollywood. You've seen this stuff before such as in "The 
Player" or "Bowfinger," or on quite a few sitcoms but Mamet's approach is a 
little different to keep it original, fresh and unpredictable so that when 
the story suddenly shifts or a wacky jokes pops up out of nowhere you're 
genuinely surprised. 
Sometimes Mamet's mannerisms can be really annoying, especially if you're 
familiar with his work. If you're not, it includes characters repeating 
themselves; slowly-paced scenes and unnecessary foul language. 
Rebecca Pidgeon plays essentially the same character she did in "The Spanish 
Prisoner" - an eccentric smart woman with a penchant for detail who likes to 
force herself onto others. She doesn't talk like a real person and when she 
dumps her fiancee for the screenwriter whom she's only known for a few days 
it comes across as quite lame and forced. 
"State And Main" also has its moments of unbridled zaniness that reminds you 
of something on "Frasier." Although most of the comedy is original the jokes 
that are predictable are REALLY predictable. 
It's nice to see Mamet lighten up a bit, relatively speaking. This being 
something of a throwaway, insignificant story it's still a heck of a lot 
better than if some Hollywood clown tried to write and direct it their way. 
"State And Main" has a well-written screenplay of nuances and detail that's 
never gratuitous. Everything has a reason for being put in the place that it 
is. What's more, it even makes good use of the film-within-the-film's 
supposedly Oscar-caliber theme about getting a second chance. The actual film 
isn't quite THAT good, but it is a refreshing and satisfying change of pace 
that anyone would be bettered by seeing it.

Hollywood invades small town New England when a film production company, 
led by producer Walt Price (William H. Macy), comes to Waterford, Vermont 
to shoot the film, "The Old Mill." The problem is the town's old mill 
burned to the ground three decades ago and that's just the beginning of the 
troubles in a movie about making a movie, David Mamet's "State and Main." 
Playwright/screenwriter/director Mamet has created celebrated and 
controversial tales from "Glengarry Glen Ross" to "Oleana" to "The Winslow 
Boy." Mamet, the writer, has produced an eclectic body of work that often 
delves deeply into the human psyche. With "State and Main," the helmer 
takes on a fast paced comedy in a movie about making a movie in small town 
America. In this one, though, the talented Mamet stumbles. 
When the production team for "The Old Mill" lays siege to the unsuspecting 
Vermont town, it is with a checkered past. A scandal forced the entire 
production crew to be turned out of their previous location in a New 
Hampshire town because of a propensity for young girls by the film's star, 
Bob Barringer (Alec Baldwin). Now, ensconced in their new location, with 
only days to go before principal photography starts and no budget left, 
Walt Price has multiple disasters to contend with. As mentioned before, the 
mill that is the focal point of "The Old Mill" is gone. Barringer's 
co-star, Claire Wellesley (Sarah Jessica Parker), refuses to do her 
contracted nude scene unless she gets a bunch more money. The film's 
lunatic cinematographer wants to destroy a stained glass landmark so he can 
"get the shot." Finally, playwright turned screenwriter Joseph Turner White 
(Philip Seymour Hoffman) is suffering from a monumental case of writer's 
block. 
And these are just some of the problems that must be faced. White falls for 
the pretty fiancée of a local politician while struggling with his changing 
career. Bob Barringer gets in trouble, again, with a local teen girl (Julia 
Stiles), forcing a cover-up to avoid getting everyone tossed out of town. 
And, a replacement still has to be found for the damned Old Mill! 
All of this is fun stuff from the pen of a talented writer and it probably 
looked really good on paper. Especially with the large, talented ensemble 
cast available to breathe life into their characters. Unfortunately, the 
execution of these amusing ideas falls flat with too much going on with too 
many characters. There is also a problem with who is the "bad guy" here. Is 
it the intrusive strangers from Hollywood? Or, is it the town folk who do 
everything they can to take advantage of the bucks that the production crew 
brings to thew town? As the lines of definition blur between the outsiders 
and the residents, the people of Waterford take on the same greedy air as 
the folks from Tinseltown. 
The lack of distinction between the outsiders and insiders is complicated 
by the choice of some of the principle actors. Philip Seymour Hoffman has 
impressed me, considerably, in his past performances - see him as Freddie 
in "The Talented Mr. Ripley" as a marvelous example of his acting ability. 
But, as the sensitive, angst-ridden, romantic figure? It is just not the 
Hoffman's cup of tea. Mamet seems to be using the actor as his own alter 
ego in the film. Sarah Jessica Parker, as the movie star to whom modesty 
has just become an issue in her career, is little more than a pampered 
prima donna that usually gets her way. Alec Baldwin simply has nowhere to 
take his self-center matinee idol. 
There are some good roles coming out of "State and Main," though. William 
H. Macy, one of the finest character actors in the business, plays the 
cocky producer to perfection. He, and David Paymer as the film's 
high-powered "money man," put a good spin on portraying filmmakers used to 
having their way on location. They plead, threaten and pout to get their 
ways with their crew and the town's people. Their perfs only make up a 
portion of the movie and it's not enough. 
Tech credits are adequate, but nothing remarkable. 
I have come to look forward to most of David Mamet's films and, usually, am 
not disappointed. There are exceptions, though, and "State and Main" is 
one. For a movie about making a movie, there isn't enough movie-making 
stuff to the story. I give it a C.

After getting unceremoniously thrown out of the state of New Hampshire,
the Hollywood cast and crew of "The Old Mill" descend upon Waterford, Vermont,
largely on the merits of its authentic old mill and firehouse.  Screenwriter
Joseph Turner White (Philip Seymour Hoffman) will face a crisis of conscience
when he's asked to lie about witnessing the presence of an underage local in 
star Bob Barrenger's (Alec Baldwin) car at an accident at "State and
Main."
Writer/director David Mamet takes a pot shot at Hollywood corruption with
his latest, "State and Main."  While his screenplay features many pithy
lines (usually coming from the director/producer due of William H. Macy
and David Paymer), "State and Main" plays pretty flat.
Director Walt Price (Mamet vet Macy) arrives with his signature cross stitched
pillow ('Shoot first, ask questions later') and sets up camp.  His 
and producer Marty Rossen's attitude is obviously condescending to the 
locals, who themselves are soon retaliating by filling Evian bottles with
tap water.  Soon they discover that the local, hoped for titular, old mill
burned down years ago, their ever randy star is fooling around with the
local deli guy's underage daughter (Julia Stiles, "Hamlet"), their female star,
Claire Wellesley (Sarah Jessica Parker) is balking at nudity even though it's
covered by her contract and the locals are all tied up in a local stage 
production and unavailable as extras.
The central focus of the story, though, is Mamet standin, screenwriter
Joseph Turner White (Philip Seymour Hoffman), adapting his own play for the
big screen for the first time.  He meets local bookshop owner Ann Black
(Rebecca Pidgeon, "The Winslow Boy" and Mamet's wife) who tries to keep him
on a true course as he navigates the ways of Tinseltown while an innocent
romance blooms.
Even as Mamet provides clever dialogue ('Everybody makes their own fun.  If
you don't make it, it's entertainment.'  'You believed that?  It's so biased!
So's our electoral process, but we still vote.') and situations (placing
a computer product placement in a film set in 1895), his film never takes
wing and flies.  His oddly assembled cast runs the gamut from Macy, delivering
his lines as if he were on stage instead of in a film, Seymour Hoffman,
miscast as a naive romantic lead, and Alec Baldwin, convincing as a pampered
star with a fixation on nubile young girls.  Macy and Paymer enjoy repartee,
but Hoffman and Pidgeon never really connect.  A subplot where Mayor George
Bailey (Charles Durning as the "It's a Wonderful Life" namesake) cowtows
to the Hollywood celebrities in order to score a society dinner for his wife
Sherry (Patti LuPone), so rife with comic possiblities, is just about
abandoned.  No effort is made to make the film-within-a-film appear the least
bit interesting.
Technically the film is adequate.  Overall, "State and Main" has the appearance
of a film that was a lot more fun to make than it is to sit through.

   When writers satirize people and institutions, they do not
necessarily despise what they are sending up.  Though Ben
Jonson took serious jabs at humanity in "Volpone" calling
human beings jackals and worse, some parodists can barely
hide their affection for their targets.  Take David Mamet for
example.  In 1989 he had his "Speed-the-Plow" staged on
Broadway starring Joe Mantegna, Ron Silver and Madonna in
what looked like a devasting skewer of Hollywood, but the
hilarity of the script gave away his fondness for things L.A.  In
"State and Main," a milder sendup of the movie business,
Mamet mellows in Preston Sturges territory, lampooning
politics, the advertising business, sex and
hero-worship--particularly the ways that the movie industry
manipulates the objects of his barely hidden affection.
   Preston Sturges's "The Great McGinty" and "Sullivan's
Travels" which propelled that writer-director into a meteoric, if
brief, success, might be the very films that inspired Mamet
this time around.  "The Great McGinty," released in 1940,
deals with a bum who is manipulated into the governor's chair
by a crooked political machine but who blows it all when he
decides to become honest.  "Sullivan's Travels," released a
year later, deals with a "fluff" director who decides to do a
serious film by researching the subject in the real world. 
   In "State and Main" by comparison, Walt Price (played by
Mamet regular William H. Macy), is intent on directing a
serious piece by photographing on location in small-town
America, only to find that the company affects the residents
of the sleepy village more than the burg impacts on the
filmmaker.  Sending up both Hollywood and hamlet, "State
and Main" gains its unusually quiet and lovable humor by
focussing on oddball relationships between bizarre members
of his crew and idiosyncratic denizens of Waterford, Vermont
(actually Manchester, Massachusetts).  Handsome leading
man Bob Barrenger (Alec Baldwin) gets into hot water yet
again by his penchant for 14-year-olds (in this case for Carla
Taylor, played by Julia Stiles). The leading lady, Claire
Wellesley (Sarah Jessica Parker), decides at the last moment
that she will not bare her breasts despite her contractual
agreement to do so.  Producer Marty Rosen (David Paymer)
is pitted against an avaricious politician, Doug MacKenzie
(Clark Gregg).  Best of all, a stuttering scripter, Joseph
Turner White (Philip Seymour Hoffman) enjoys an eccentric
romance with a whimsical bookstore owner, Ann (Rebecca
Pidgeon).
   Virtually missing this time around is David Mamet's bent for
clipped speech, which he utilized to our great pleasure in
"House of Games" and even more powerfully in his best
work, "Glengarry Glen Ross."  Also bypassed is the writer-
director's typical harshness, putting "State and Main" more in
line with the ambiance of Mamet's Chekhov adaptation,
"Vanya on 42nd St" than with the rueful attack on political
correctness, "Olenna."  But the prolific 53-year-old writer's
current offering is a welcome respite from his usual cynicism. 
When he tempts a grasping, anti-Semitic politician with a
bribe, or invites an odd couple (the writer and the bookseller)
to enjoy a spontaneous romance; when he displays the ways
that a whole town can be amiably corrupted by the allure of
celebrities; and when in a Capra-esque homage, he gives a
man the choice of being honest at the risk of his career or
bearing false witness with the hope of a blockbuster calling--
he allows us to explore human folly with grins and chuckles
instead of knives and cudgels.  
   The remarkable Philip Seymour Hoffman is the show
stealer, giving a nuanced impersonation of a man whose
difficulty with spontaneous communication belies his genius
with a typewriter.  His liaison with the town's amateur
theatrics director (played with lovable technique by Ms.
Pidgeon) is a romance of the authentic sort we do not often
get to see on the screen.  The one line that draws belly
laughs from the audience--a jab at the American electoral
process--is so current, so precisely out of today's headlines
about the Gore-Bush battles--that we could swear that Mamet
had just injected that dialogue into this congenial film.

     In order to see one of 2000's real treasures, most of you are going
to have to wait until January of 2001, when the masterful State and Main
comes to a theater near you.
     State and Main, written and directed by David Mamet (The Spanish
Prisoner, The Winslow Boy, House of Games), follows a Hollywood film
crew into the sleepy town of Waterford, Vermont, for the shooting of a
would-be blockbuster.  William H. Macy plays the director -- part
ballbuster, part smooth-talker -- who comes to Waterford after the
production kicked out of another lost-in-the-past New England locale.
     Waterford is perfect for the period piece, and the crew descends on
the village, upending the status quo, even turning geriatrics into movie
star wannabes.  Among the crew are David Paymer as the crazed producer
who wants to score some cash for a product placement for "Bazoomer.com"
despite the town's 1896 setting.  (Note to enterprising cybersquatters:
Mamet owns the domain already.  I checked.)  The excellent Phillip
Seymour Hoffman plays the stammering screenwriter, ironically unable to
find his own words much of the time.  Star and starlet are played by
Alec Baldwin and Sarah Jessica Parker, both in over-the-top roles that
nail the Hollywood ego trip perfectly.
     Notable townfolk include Julia Stiles as a barely pubescent
teenager infatuated with Baldwin and determined to bed him (and which
doesn't take much).  Charles Durning plays the pushover, starstruck
mayor to perfection, Patti LuPone his overbearing wife.  And Rebecca
Pidgeon -- aka Mrs. Mamet -- has a gem of a star turn as the
wise-beyond-her-years, local bookstore owner trying to organize an
amateur theater group -- who all abandon her when the film crew comes to
town.
     This story's been done before -- in fact, it's been done to death
-- but never with such flair and pulling off such a perfect skewering of
Hollywood.  (In fact, Mamet has been over roughly this same ground
recently with Wag the Dog.)  Hilarious from start to finish, State and
Main has so few lulls and so many memorable parts that it's hard not to
be hungry for more after it's over.  (Best line: "It's not a lie, it's a
gift for fiction.")
     Mamet juggles various intertwining plots (Parker doesn't want to do
a nude scene, Baldwin wrecks his car with the girl inside, etc. etc.)
with perfect aplomb.  The best story line also happens to include the
two best actors in the picture -- Hoffman and Pidgeon -- who find
themselves in the most peculiar -- and believable -- romance I think
I've ever seen on screen or off.
     State and Main also stays light thanks to Mamet's backing away from
his trademark clipped cadence, at least a little bit -- this dialogue is
so good it transcends just about anything you could do to it.  At the
same time, the movie is full of depth, nuance, and themes-within-themes,
courtesy of its movie-within-a-movie structure.
     I'm giving State and Main an early line for at least four Oscars
(including one for Hoffman's performance), not to mention my nod for
best picture of the year-to-date.  I hope this gem can get the buzz
going.  Go you Huskies!

     In Waterford, Vermont, the town doctor strolls down Main Street,
following up with his patients as they pass by. The residents exchange
expressions of support for the high school football team, and the clothing
store leaves racks untended on the sidewalk. The mayor is even named
George Bailey. George for-the-love-of-IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE Bailey. Yes,
indeed, Waterford is the quintessence of wholesome small-town America, God
bless us every one.
     Oh, and there was a string of suspicious fires back in the 1960s,
probably set by a deranged teenager.
     Somewhere between Frank Capra and David Lynch (by way of Woody Allen)
lies the world of David Mamet's STATE AND MAIN, a movie industry satire
that's not really a movie industry satire in its unique, sweetly cynical
way. The concept finds a Hollywood film crew searching for the ideal
backwater New England town for a location shoot. Director Walt Price
(William H. Macy) believes he has found his spot in Waterford, until
things start getting shaky. A key location is inconveniently absent,
leading man Bob Barrenger (Alec Baldwin) is once again indulging his taste
for underage girls and leading lady Claire Wellesley (Sarah Jessica
Parker) is balking at doing her nude scene. Meanwhile, the film's rookie
screenwriter Joseph Turner White (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is struggling
with his artistic conscience and his re-writes as he falls for local
bookseller Annie White (Rebecca Pidgeon).
     In a more conventional film, STATE AND MAIN would have turned into a
broad fish-out-of-water farce about clashes between the worldly and the
homespun. Mamet chooses to keep those two worlds largely distinct from a
narrative standpoint, juxtaposing the film's behind-the-scenes chaos with
the reactions of the townspeople to the crew's presence. Most of the more
straightforward humor comes from the pre-production, with good
self-deprecating work by Baldwin and Parker and hilarious work by David
Paymer as the film's cutthroat producer. Then there is Macy, whose
director takes on a different personality for every person he deals with
depending on how much power he wields over them. As both writer and
director, Mamet keeps masterful control over when information is revealed,
adding layers of humor at unexpected moments. In their clockwork
construction and delightful aura of self-importance, those movie scenes
are the stuff of great comedy.
     But STATE AND MAIN actually works best as something more than a
simple razzing of movie folk. The real object of Mamet's ridicule is the
whole idea of "purity" over which Black obsessess in his script. Waterford
is no idealized hamlet away from the hustle and bustle of Hollywood. It's
a town with dark secrets, ready to sell its soul for a chance to be part
of that hustle and bustle. The townies at the diner trade their local
paper for Variety, the mayor's wife (Patti LuPone) tears up her historic
home to host a dinner for the film crew, and the community theater actors
drop their local production for a chance to be an extra in the movie.
Mamet takes the myth of pop culture as corruptor of ordinary, decent
Americans and shows ordinary, decent Americans in our tabloid- and
WWF-obsessed "average American" world plenty ready to be corrupted if
given an excuse, thank you very much.
     That may sound like a terribly dark perspective, but STATE AND MAIN
is actually a bit more optimistic. The budding romance between Black and
White is not just significant in the metaphorical obviousness of their
names, but in showing how tough it is to maintain a moral center in any
environment. It's also, unfortunately, a seriously weak link. It's nice to
see an actor like Hoffman get a shot at a romantic lead, but there's
something missing from his character to make him a solid center. And while
Pidgeon is getting better on screen all the time, she still slips into the
most jarring examples of clipped Mamet-speak. STATE AND MAIN hits its own
giant pothole like the one the town continues to ignore, but unlike in the
film, it never gets big enough to cause a wreck. Mamet's script is too
sharp, the performances too strong, and the message too cleverly
insinuated. Good comedy is rare; good comedy with something to say is even
rarer. Welcome to Waterford, a little slice of America the way it used to
be -- and the way it really is.

STATE AND MAIN *** 1/2 . Written and directed by David Mamet. 
Photography, Oliver Stapleton. Editing, Barbar Tulliver. Production 
design, Gemma Jackson. Producer Sarah Green. Music, Theodore Shapiro. 
Cast: Alec Baldwin, Charles Durning , Clark Gregg, Philip Seymour 
Hoffman, Patti LuPone, William H. Macy, Sarah Jessica Parker, David 
Paymer, Rebecca Pidgeon, Julia Stiles. A Fine Line release. 102 
minutes. R (language, allusions to sex)
The so-talented Rebecca Pidgeon is in real life Mrs. David Mamet. I 
saw her last in her husband's excellent remale of "The Winslow Boy." 
Here she plays Ann, a smalltown bookseller, the leader of the 
dramatic society, and the fiancee of obnoxious lawyer and local 
politico Doug MacKenzie (Clark Gregg). There's no true love between 
the two, but then really small towns have really small opportunities. 
Soon that man will be evinced by a quiet, lovely affair between Ann 
and visiting scriptwriter Joseph Turner White (Philip Seymour 
Hoffman.) The new relationship--like most of the other aspects of the 
movie--is a gem of originality, as is Ann's charming wisdom. Quietly, 
without pretentiousness or sententiousness, she speaks pearls. One of 
them goes: "You make your own fun. Otherwise, it's entertainment."
Triple threat playwright, screenwriter and director David Mamet must 
be having the time of his life by making his own fun here by 
satirizing out and out the making and makers of movies. Director Walt 
Price (William Macy) has been looking for locations to shoot the 
late-19th century opus "The Old Mill." He had found the ideal place 
and mill in New Hampshire, but circumstances obliged the movie crew 
to run away. The replacement is Waterford, Vermont, a spot as 
colorful in sights and denizens as any invented by Hollywood. (Even 
the rain looks like movie-rain.)
Walt is everything you didn't want to know about a name director and 
about films -- if you want to keep your illusions about the 
practitioners of the Seventh Art.  Both in turns and simultaneously 
he is imperious, rude, demanding, cajoling, foul-mouthed, clever, 
imaginative, impossible, inventive, Napoleonic and Machiavellian. His 
declining star Bob Barrenger (Alec Baldwin) has a pronounced taste 
for young, school-age girls --which inevitably leads to troubles. 
First-time screenwriter Joe White is sweet, insecure and lost without 
his manual typewriter which disappeared between New Hampshire and 
Vermont. He finds in smart, tolerant Ann a rod, a staff, a muse and 
an object of his affections.
Claire, the projected film's female lead, has mega-problems, to which 
she adds a refusal to bare her breasts on-camera. This has something 
to do with her "purity," though an additional $800.000 would change 
her mind. The casting of Sarah Jessica Parker is inspired given her 
roles in TV's "Sex in the City."
Marty Rossen, the shyster lawyer who is the film's producer, is never 
short of arguments and ploys. He's the kind of beast who would do 
anything to get what he wants -- in fact he is like the classic 
definition of "chutzpah" where a man who killed his father and mother 
throws himself at the mercy of the Court "because I'm an orphan."
Add  mid-teenager Carla (Julia Stiles, who must have been 18 when the 
movie was shot).  She helps her dad with food services at the hotel 
where everybody is staying. In a clever twist, she seduces seducer 
Bob --and everything concerning the making of "The Old Mill"'s comes 
to a halt, while other developments stress venality, including lawyer 
MacKenzie's. By sheer coincidence some echoes of the year 2000's 
stolen Presidential election add some serious weight to the politics 
of the situation.
(By the way, the Old Mill of Waterford turns out to having been 
torched in 1960 by, probably, a destructive schoolboy.)
The film may be a series of catastrophes but they are all presented 
so juicily, amusingly, hilariously, winningly and wittily that they 
five the movie its several "raisons d'etre."  Details are splendidly 
sketched out. Characters and  situations are all different from one 
another while movie cliches are given freshness and originality.  .
The cast and team of both "State and Main" and "The Old Mill" are 
rather small but do wonders thanks to Mamet's quick, sharp (or 
obtuse-on-purpose) dialogue. He handles language like a 
prestidigitator, directs with ease. Many of the stars have been in 
Mamet films:  Macy, Paymer, Pidgeon, LuPone.
Non sequiturs or absurd logic enrich the text. Inventiveness reigns: 
at the hotel, the traffic in people, rooms, doors opening or closing 
is coordinated like a Georges Feydeau farce. In the hotel's cafe, two 
regular, chorus-like old-timers read Variety and talk technically of 
inflated movie profits. The whole production feels like a renaissance 
of older, classic screwball comedies --but not of slapstick pics.
Macy and Paymer repeat the old joke about naming people Associate 
Producer instead of paying them, yet the gag is always fresh. Paymer 
wants to ammortize expenses by bringing in product placement in the 
film, computer advertising ... in 1895, that is. Sure enough, by the 
end, some of the "inner" movie's shots shows an ad for a livery 
stable, and beneath it, one for Bazoomer computers.
Of course, we never find out what "The Old Mill" is about.
Do not stand up and leave the theater while end-credits are rolling. 
The humor continues until the lights go up.

STATE AND MAIN ** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (bill@filmfreakcentral.net)
starring Alec Baldwin, Charles Durning, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy
written and directed by David Mamet
I've always found it odd that movies about moviemaking tend to come from 
young directors, who haven't any perspective on the profession yet. To 
point the camera back at Hollywood at all is an exercise in 
self-indulgence, but the results are generally more satisfying when it's an 
old hand behind that camera. (Every year at the Toronto International Film 
Festival, I must sit through two or three debut films that are about the 
biz, and none of them ever hold a candle to Robert Altman's career abstract 
The Player.) Playwright, script doctor and highbrow filmmaker David Mamet 
skewers the pre-production stage of big-budget features in his latest 
motion picture State and Main, and while it's more insightful than most of 
its kin about the screenwriter's place in the food chain (no surprise 
there), I can't help but think its last line, "Cue the dead horse," should 
have been the first, because Mamet beats one from the get-go.
The setting for this screwball-ish comedy is a Vermont hamlet in which "The 
Old Mill" will soon be shot--though not before the project is renamed: 
turns out the town's old mill, the very reason they set up shop there, 
burned down decades ago. (Like many of State and Main's ironies, this plot 
development hopes we were born yesterday; that the film's title setting 
would be overlooked during the initial location scout is maddeningly 
illogical.) The start date is also threatened by one star's (Alec Baldwin) 
paedophilic fling and another's (Sarah Jessica Parker) refusal to perform a 
nude scene; in the meantime, a local woman (Rebecca Pidgeon) becomes muse 
to the insecure screenwriter (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a theatre vet. 
Pidgeon, Mamet's wife, vacillates between robotic and just plain terrible, 
as always--she has the glassy-eyed stare of someone being fed her lines 
off-screen. Aside from nepotism, Mamet is guilty of leaving several story 
strands flapping in the breeze, and I can't believe that his years of 
experience with such ripe targets as Brian DePalma amounted to this. In the 
end, State and Main so much resembles the cinema-obsessed work regularly 
generated by naive film school graduates that it might be more prudent to 
call it brilliant parody. (--- For more first-run, DVD, and

Things can get somewhat bizarre when a cynical
director, Walt Price (William H. Macy), experiences
increasing frustration as the deadline to finish his
movie approaches but all of his key personnel can't
seem to jell.  Top writer, Joseph White (Phillip
Seymour Hoffman), is suffering from a bout of writer's
block.  Lead actress, Claire Wellesley (Sarah Jessica
Parker) has major doubts about her nude scenes. 
Meanwhile, lead actor, Bob Barringer (Alec Baldwin),
invariably halts production because he has a yen for
teenage girls which leads to trouble with the law. 
"Everybody has to have a hobby," he tries to explain. 
His indiscretion has forced the movie company to
relocate to a sleepy Vermont town to finish shooting
their project.  But wherever they go, havoc continues
to ensue.
"State and Main" is a sharp satire about the
moviemaking business and some of the strange politics
and happenings that goes on offscreen.  Some of what
happens is the happy result of being in the world of
show biz.  Some of what happens is the diplomacy that
must be exercised by the director to pamper the
actors, soothe the townsfolk who are afraid of the
encroachment of Hollywood power, and save the company
from financial and public devastation.  Meanwhile,
some of what happens becomes fodder for tabloids.
This film's story touches upon all three of these
themes with the most enjoyable being that of the
writer who unexpectedly falls in love with one of the
townsfolk, Ann Black (Rebecca Pidgeon).  With similar
backgrounds, they are like kindred spirits to one
another.  Unfortunately, she is already engaged to an
ambitious politician who is very uneasy with the movie
company's presence.
The darkest sequence involves Bob Barringer and his
latest object of desire, Carla (Julia Stiles).  He may
have a weakness for young, beautiful girls, but the
odd thing is that she is just as saucy as he is weak. 
Inevitably, scandal rears its ugly head, and the first
one to jump at exposing any wrongdoing is the
aforementioned politician.
Of course, all of these crises must be handled
appropriately by the director.  With emotions ranging
from gentle coddling to unbridled hysteria, the
beleaguered Walt Price does what he can to ensure that
the production moves forward.  He'll do and say just
about anything to, for example, keep his lead actress
happy even though she protests the nude scene; coax
the easily wounded writer into massive rewrites; and
persuade prosecutors to look the other way.  "It's a
gift for fiction," he says.  And, when his actions are
not enough, the producer (David Paymer) jumps in to
verbally brawl with and intimidate anyone who
jeopardizes the production.
This is an amiable comedy about big time people in a
small town setting that showcases uniformly good
performances from its ensemble cast.  In particular,
Macy does a fine job at anchoring the film as he tries
desperately to keep the escalating production woes
from spinning out of control.  And while there is lots
of silliness in its satire, the subplot between the
writer and bookstore owner (amusingly named White and
Black) is also engaging and endearing.  You'll find
lots to like grin about in small town America, and in
particular, in a place called "State and Main."

 State and Main (2001).  2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring William H. Macy,
Alec Baldwin, Sarah Jessica Parker, Philip Seymour Hoffman, David
Paymer, Rebecca Pidgeon, Charles Durning, Patti Lupone and Clark Gregg.
Written and directed by David Mamet. Rated R.
 Previously when dealing with the movies, most notably in Hurlyburly,
David Mamet has used his pen as a scalpel to satirically slice the
industry. But in his latest venture, State and Main, the playwright is
content with using his writing instrument as a feather merely to tickle
the industry.
 The premise is simplicity itself. A movie company, after losing its New
Hampshire location, settles upon the sleepy little town of Waterford,
Vt., to film The Old Mill. Waterford seems perfect; it has a firehouse
and an old mill ó at least according to a brochure about the town.
 Unfortunately, after settling on Waterford and making all the
arrangements needed to film, director Walt Price (William H. Macy) and
his production crew discover that the brochure is a bit out of date ó
the mill was destroyed during a rash of suspicious fires back in 1960.
 So, first-time screenwriter Joe White (Philip Seymour Hoffman),  a
promising young playwright, must revamp his script while at the same
time searching for a manual typewriter to replace his, which was lost in
transit from New Hampshire.
How the film company solves its various dilemmas and interacts with the
easy-going New Englanders of Waterford is the gist of Mametís
screenplay.
 State and Main, which Mamet also directed, is a gentle comedy. Mametís
jabs at Hollywood are more like love taps. The movie is funny, but not
biting.
 But what a cast. Beside Macy and Hoffman, the film stars Alec Baldwin
and Sarah Jessica Parker as Bob Barrenger and Claire Wellesley, the
stars of The Old Mill; David Paymer as the filmís trouble-shooting
producer; Charles Durning as Waterfordís mayor; Patti Lupone as his
snobbish wife; Rebecca Pidgeon as Waterfordís bookstore owner and
community theater director; and Julia Stiles as a teen-age groupie out
to exploit Bobís predilection for young girls.
 State and Main just meanders along. And that is the filmís problem.
Itís comic, but not frantic; the laughs are there, but they lack a big
payoff.
 Even the satire lacks spark. It's of the obvious type, mostly
consisting of the ěsophisticatedî Hollywood folk not able to comprehend
the rustic style of their hosts.
 State and Main has its moments, but you seem to have to wait for them.
 The one nice aspect of Mametís story is seeing Hoffman playing a
romantic figure. The love affair that develops between the idealistic
writer and practical community theater director is sweet. Hoffman and
Pidgeon make a lovely couple.
 But the others all seem to be playing types: Macy as the profane
director who wonít let anything or anyone stop him from making his
movie; Baldwin as the self-centered leading man; Parker as the airhead
bimbo with artistic aspirations; Paymer as the ruthless money man. They
all are caricatures.
 State and Main is a rather tame outing. Itís enjoyable, but nothing
that will make a lasting impression.

This briskly-paced dry comedy portrays the daily trials and tribulations 
of a film crew as they field obstacle after obstacle in Smalltown, 
America. The most blaring predicament - how to write the old mill out of 
a script entitled "The Old Mill?" 
"Why did we have to leave New Hampshire?" the bumbling writer asks the 
producer who is never at a loss for a quick fix answer or "associate 
producer" credit with which to patronize a discouraged contributor. 
There's the actress refusing to expose herself after recently finding 
God, the writer who can't create without a manual typewriter, the male 
lead actor with a fetish for underage girls and the local townsfolk 
spinning a love story or two into the mix. 
Cute, cozy and wryly funny; the film, feeling of "Northern Exposure" is 
slightly too TV. This is a small drawback, especially in the face of a 
thumping bustling pace that the filmmakers maintain from beginning to 
end. The only other shortcoming (and again a small one) lies in the 
casting. Populated by many interesting characters, the writer eventually 
becomes the focal person. Though, Philip Seymour Hoffman, performs fine, 
he simply doesn't elicit the compassion of the audience. Other actors 
who may have been better suited for the role include: Will Smith, Ben 
Stiller, Owen Wilson.

Remember what I said last year [man, has it been that long already?]
about that horrid waste of actors and celluloid, SUPERNOVA?  Well, raise
that notion to the nth degree, and you'll know the Pain I felt in
watching the disaster called STATE AND MAIN.
The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
The cast and crew of the late 19-century period piece, "The Old Mill",
look for a new location in which to film their flick; it seems like the
antics of its horny star, Bob Barrenger (Alec Baldwin), led to the
production leaving its first location set in New Hampshire, in a bit of
a hurry.  This causes big problems for the movie's put-upon director,
Walt Price (William H. Macy), who has to clean up behind Bob again when
Bob casts his eyes upon Carla (Julia Stiles), a local teenager who lives
in the movie's new location - Waterford, Vermont.
But Bob's big and little heads are just the tip of Walt's problems; he
also has to contend with a cantankerous producer, Marty Rossen (David
Paymer); the town's Mayor (Charles Durning) and his wife (Patti LuPone);
Bob's leading lady Claire Wellesley (Sarah Jessica Parker), who chickens
out of a key scene after she overhears Walt's assistant, Tommy (Jim
Frangione); and Joseph Turner White (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a somewhat
naive writer who falls for local playwright Annie Black (Rebecca
Pidgeon), much to the chagrin of Annie's politician fiance and movie
hater, Doug Mackenzie (Clark Gregg).
[This is supposed to be the part where I say "And, Wackiness Ensues" -
but there's this Truth In Advertising thingy...]
The Upshot:
January, movie-wise, is starting to look like That Time Of The Month for
Hollywood.  That's the only explanation I can think of why films like
last January's "Stupornova" and this year's STATE AND MAIN, would abuse
such talented casts as they both did, with the wretchedness that spilled
forth from their reels.
The wretchedness of STATE AND MAIN upsets me mightily [couldn't tell,
could ya?  I Mask so well.], because I've been dying to see this cast in
what *should* have been a Witty Comedy.  Instead, I got to witness a
train wreck, saved only by a charming, unknown (to me, anyway) actress
by the name of Rebecca Pidgeon (Annie), a few great lines (especially
the final, mumbled bit by Alec Baldwin), and a fairly decent end scene:
alas, all a day late and a dollar short.  Hell, way before the halfway
mark, I was looking for a blunt instrument to throw at the screen...
The most painful waste of all for me was that William H. Macy - the
actor I'd most love to thank for his brilliance to date - got
suckered...uh, convinced...to participate in this film.  But I reckon I
shouldn't be too harsh.  "State" didn't earn my complete wrath, as
witnessed by my not giving it a full redlight, because, taken
individually, the performances weren't really all that bad.  Macy, who
seemingly got the lion's share of the movie's lines, worked hard at his
craft; were he an unknown, auditioning for a one-man play, I'd certainly
cast him on the strength of his performance here.  Similarly, David
Paymer (strangely cast against type as an in-your-face producer), and
Philip Seymour Hoffman - two actors I also look forward to watching -
bit deep into their juicy roles.
Thankfully, Alec Baldwin and Sarah Jessica Parker were reduced to
second-string parts (ironic, since the movie-within-a-movie had them
playing the stars of the show they were filming), and Charles Durning
(Mayor Bailey) wasn't called on to play the Wacky Backwoods Politician
again (c.f. O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? for the latest in a long line of
his irritating Wacky Backwoods Politician roles).  And, except for a few
hokey bits, writer/director David Mamet pretty much laid off the Wise
Local Yokels routine; I guess this was A Good Thing, though not hearing
much of a Vermont dialect in the locals' speech, left something to be
desired.
No, the individual parts were fairly harmless; it's when they were made
into a whole, that STATE AND MAIN became unbearable to watch.  It seemed
full of aborted plotlines [uh, did somebody forget about Uberto and the
window?], devoid of anything remotely Funny [did I laugh once? I can't
remember], and wrapped itself up with one of the most ludicrous payoffs
I've ever seen in a movie (ironic, again, because the final scene was
the best part of the flick for me.  Probably because I was so anxious
for it to end).  And nothing was more egregious than that godawful
background music.  I swear, I could feel the bile rise in my gullet
everytime I heard that ugly melody start up.  No, I take that back.  It
never had a chance to "start up": it seemed to drone on endlessly
throughout the movie, driving me mad with every note.
Ooh, I said I wouldn't be Harsh, didn't I?  My bad.  Uh...did I mention
that I liked Rebecca Pidgeon?
Bammer's Bottom Line:
Was STATE AND MAIN supposed to be a cautionary tale about the
soullessness of show business folk? or the importance of being Pure and
True? or a statement about second chances?  Sorry, I was too busy
praying for an end to the Pain to notice.  Or care.  Mr. Macy, I Weep
for you.  You deserve much, much better.
STATE AND MAIN (rating: flashing redlight):
STATE AND MAIN served as a tedious reminder of why I don't really give a
rats ass about the Lifestyles Of The Sick And Shameless (Hollywood
edition).

An enjoyable, witty Hollywood satire from director-writer David Mamet,
who presents a sharp comedy that rails against his own acting community,
but says they're no different than any small community in America. If
you love snappy dialogue, characters who are insightful, and a healthy
sprinkling of sheer playfulness you will find this film an old-fashioned
delight, much like the sophisticated comedies of Preston Sturgess.
It pretends to give you the dirt only an insider would know on how a
Hollywood film is being made, as the film company just left a New
Hampshire town because things went scandalously wrong there, as the
movie within a movie's star, Bob Barrenger (Alec Baldwin), got into
trouble because of his hobby, being attracted to teenage girls. The film
company ends up in some sleepy, small New England town called Waterford,
Vermont, which they selected because the outdated brochure they
possessed said it had an old mill. The old mill is the focal point of
the story they are adapting to film, called "The Old Mill."
The fast-paced comedy, starts off with a calamity, the town's old mill
burnt down in 1960, and the film will continue with a series of
calamities, one after another, and each adding to the fun and the
absurdity of the filming stuation, as the difficulties of shooting a
film set in the 19th century with some cunningly pampered Hollywood
stars and locals who are either starstruck or are equally as avaricious
as the stars, puts pressure on the company heads to finish the film. To
make matters worst, they have run out of money to increase the budget
and can't afford to build the needed old mill from scratch or try for
another town with a mill, as they are obligated to finish the film on
schedule.
The film company is led by the manipulatively crude director Walt
(Wally) Price (William H. Macy), whose temperament swings from being
callously humorous to those he considers unimportant to him --  to being
diplomatic to the point of being obsequious in handling his stars, as he
coyly tries to get them to do what he wants.
He must deal with his neurotically insecure first-time script writer,
Joseph Turner White (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who can only work on his
manual typewriter, which is lost in transit, and who has to be coddled
by Wally to rewrite the script to be without an old mill, which leaves
the depressed writer ruminating about what to do. Wally, of course, has
a ready answer for any of Joe's doubts about changing the story, as he
denies that he lies about the film's new theme: "It's not a lie. It's a
gift for fiction."
Claire Wellesley (Sarah Jessica Parker) is the film's glamorous and
petulant co-star who suddenly refuses to show her tits, even though, as
the producer, Marty Rossen (David Paymer) states, the nation could "draw
them from memory." Only for $800,000 more on her contract will she do
the honors, even though her original contract calls for her to do a nude
scene. It's Marty's job to come up with the money or figure some way to
get out of that problem and all the other problems that emerge during
the filming. The bare tit problem gets solved in the rewrite, as Joseph
now declares that the film is about purity and that she won't have to
bare her breasts to the camera but only to Bob, whom she occassionally
boffs, anyway.
The mayor (Charles Durning) of the town is starstruck as is his grasping
wife (LuPone), as he gives the film crew all the permits and cooperation
they need to make the film, and only asks that the director and the
stars come to their elaborate dinner, wishing to use the showbiz folks
for their own social gain. Due to a mix up in dates, the Hollywood
people stiff them, much to the anger of the mayor and his shrewish wife,
who are dressed in Scottish kilts awaiting the guests who never arrive.
Carla (Stiles) is the attractive delivery girl in her father's
restaurant that caters to the film crew, who catches Bob's lustful
attention, and it becomes a question of which one seduced the other
first. A major plot line of the story follows the coverup attempts after
Bob's car flips over on a Main St. pothole and hits the town's traffic
light leaving himself and his underaged date Carla slightly injured,
leading to questions about whether he should be charged with statuatory
rape or if the only witness to the accident, Joe, will be principled
enough to tell the truth or not.
Ann (Pidgeon-Mamet's wife) is the local bookstore owner who is engaged
to an ambitious lightweight politician (Clark Gregg), but who
unexpectedly breaks off the engagement as she goes after Joseph Turner
White. She helps Joe with his rewrite and a sweet romance blossoms
amidst all the hypocrisy surrounding them, including how suddenly she
falls for Joe and Dumps the politico. The rejected suitor recovers from
his rejection to bribe the Hollywood people over Bob's sexual
indiscretion, as he charges Bob with statuatory rape.
There is a running gag throughout the film from two stoic Yankees, with
lines that are pure Mamet delights, as these two old-time Vermonters who
are nonplussed by all the fuss in town over the Hollywood people have a
dialogue that goes like this: Woodchuck #1: "It takes all kinds."
Woodchuck #2: "That's what it takes? I always wondered what it took."
The greatness in the film, is that it was hysterically funny and it kept
me laughing for the entire film, but it also was insightful, picking up
on the Hollywood phoniness and taking it for a nice ride through rural
America. The film felt more stagy than cinematic, more apish of
Hollywood's cynicism than not, but that's OK, it still had some bite to
it by way of some crisp dialogue and from some well-timed comedy
routines. Standing out from this fine ensemble cast was David Paymer,
who was priceless as the unscrupulous Jewish stereotype of a Hollywood
figure, portraying asmarmy producer-lawyer (perhaps only a witty Jewish
director such as Mamet can get away with such a vile character depiction
without being called to the carpet for it). Philip Seymour Hoffman, who
never fails to give a great performance, is here asked to carry the
film's theme of whether he can carry out a convenient lie to save his
Hollywood career or is he just an old-fashioned guy who can't lie worth
a damn. William H. Macy nearly had me rolling in the aisle with his
quick-witted delivery and nonstop diatribes. While Alex Baldwin played
the languid lothario part to perfection.
