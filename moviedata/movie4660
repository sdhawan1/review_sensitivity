        Dustin Hoffman is undoubtedly one of the best actors of the 
past thirty years, but even the best stars appear in mediocre films at 
times. I'd compare Hoffman's role in this movie to Al Pacino in CITY 
HALL. His performance is decent even though he's relegated to a 
supporting role and the movie is mostly boring. Another similarity 
between the two films is that both focus on a young man who looks up 
to the veteran actor as an idol. Pacino was the mayor that the deputy 
mayor (John Cusack) looked up to in CITY HALL and Hoffman is the 
mob lord that Billy Bathgate (Loren Dean) idolizes.
        Bathgate realizes that, in Great Depression America, his only 
real chance for monetary success is in the organized crime game, 
which he enters after Dutch Schultz (Hoffman) notices him juggling 
four balls at once (and, yes, he is fully clothed at the time). Suddenly 
he's able to give out dollar bills to his friends and family, with the 
admonition to, "Go out and buy yourself something nice." BILLY 
BATHGATE is about as cliche-ridden as a movie in this genre can be. I 
was waiting for the phrase "dirty copper" to come into play somewhere 
along the line.
        The plot has Schultz distracted by his upcoming court trial for 
tax evasion. Bathgate has to look after the mobster's girlfriend (Nicole 
Kidman) in the meantime. Kidman plays a married woman who is just 
coming out of an affair with a double-crossing mobster (Bruce Willis) 
who's now making love to the ocean floor. Bathgate becomes her third 
extramarital conquest, after he teaches her the secret of juggling balls. 
This time, that does have a sexual connotation. To put it another way, 
it's Prohibition but he's slipping her a longneck anyway.
        BILLY BATHGATE was a box office bomb for a reason. It's 
just not a good movie. Besides being poorly paced and thinly plotted, 
the ending still doesn't resolve much. You're almost as surprised to see 
the credits roll as you are relieved that the movie's over. Even big stars 
make mistakes sometimes. It's just too bad these three didn't learn 
their lesson after BILLY BATHGATE. Hoffman went on to do the 
bland HERO, Kidman starred in the boring Irish epic FAR AND 
AWAY and Willis, well, does the name HUDSON HAWK ring a 
bell?

     "Organized" crime was not so organized in the 1920s and early 1930s.
Individual gangs built on bootlegging, prostitution, gambling, or other
rackets fought each other for turf.  Meyer Lansky forged a single government
over the major gangs to organize them and to minimize inter-gang warfare.
The birth of this syndicate was the death of the last wild gangster.  And it
was not the FBI or the police who killed him; it is generally assumed to
have been fellow gangsters terrified because this loose cannon had just
effectively declared war on the United States government.  In his fiery
temper, Dutch Schultz had announced that he was going to kill government
prosecutor Thomas E. Dewey.  The new syndicate was trying to bring order.
The last thing it wanted was a war with the United States government
packaged and delivered by the likes of Dutch Schultz.  So Schultz died and
true organized crime was born.  E. L. Doctorow's novel BILLY BATHGATE tells
the story of a  young Irish-American rising in Schultz's organization at the
same time Schultz's star started descending.  Tom Stoppard wrote the
screenplay for a film adaptation directed by Robert Benton.
     The structure of BILLY BATHGATE's plot parallels that of GOODFELLAS.
The story begins with one horrendous crime, flashes back to how things got
to this state, and then continues from there into the future.  Billy (played
by Loren Dean) is on hand to see Schultz (played by Dustin Hoffman)
murdering Bo Weinberg (played by Bruce Willis).  It is a long ritual
involving a tugboat, a tub of cement, and Drew Preston (play by Nicole
Kidman), who is Bo's unreliable girlfriend.  From there we return to how a
teenage Billy, awestruck at Schultz's power and wealth, first accidentally
impresses Schultz, then intentionally does it, then connives his way into
Schultz's organization.  Bathgate begins as mascot and errand boy to the
Schultz organization and uses his new-found wealth to impress his girlfriend
and his mother, the latter drained from a sweatshop job that pays in a week
what Billy spends on one lunch.
     There are problems with the script that might also be virtues.  This is
not a rock 'em, sock 'em, UNTOUCHABLES sort of film.  There are scenes with
action, but there are not many.  There is little to race your pulse.  There
is not even much dramatic tension.  The film is more concerned with
questions such as whether Schultz really is exceptional or whether he is
just an ordinary man.  There is a little bit of inter-gang rivalry, a bit of
Billy's risking his life from or for his boss.  But Billy's scams are small
and short.  Like RAGTIME, this is not an adventure film; it is an
opportunity to put the viewer in a well-realized historical setting so that
the viewer can appreciate the situation.  In some cases advancing Billy's
story frustratingly takes us away from Schultz's story.  There is also a
little sex in Billy's story, giving us some visual candy to appease us that
we are not seeing Schultz's story.
     One problem with the dramatic tension is that Hoffman does not do angry
and psychotic very well.  Sometimes putting someone mild in a vicious role
works extremely well.  A case in point might be Alan Arkin in WAIT UNTIL
DARK.  However, the decision to have the driving power of a film to be the
force of Dustin Hoffman's anger is questionable.
     "Sorry, Mr. Hoffman, we're looking for someone meaner."
     "We're looking for someone angrier."
     Hoffman kicks the casting director in the bedoobees.
     Henry Fonda also was convincing in nice-guy roles but had problems with
heavies.  Hoffman is not terrible in the role, but he is only okay and much
more could have been hope for.
     Next we come to the question of historical accuracy.  Here, too, the
film is flawed, but not terribly.  There were some points that were indeed
quite accurate.  Arthur Flegenheimer did indeed borrow the name Dutch
Schultz from another hood.  And he was indeed very even-tempered until it
came to the question of money.  If Schultz thought you were cheating him out
of even small money, your life was not worth much.  "Legs" Diamond and
Vincent "Mad Dog" Coll each died from Schultz's rages over money and they
were by no means alone.  But the film did not go far enough.  It showed
Dutch Schultz as a fancy dresser.  Schultz was too much of a skinflint ever
to dress nicely.  Lucky Luciano said, "Dutch was the cheapest guy I ever
knew.  The guy had a couple of million bucks and he dressed like a pig."
The film shows Bo Weinberg being an independent hood murdered before the
upstate New York trial.  In actual fact, Weinberg worked for Schultz.  He
had little faith that Schultz would win the upstate New York trial and let
Luciano move in on Schultz's rackets while Schultz was pretending to be a
good citizen for the trial.  Another inaccuracy is in the spoiler section
following this review.
     As a minor aside, incidentally, we see a little of Stephen Hill playing
Otto Berman--known as Abbadabba Berman.  He was a mathematician who worked
out a method to increase the numbers racket take by 10%.  He would find out
what numbers had been least played.  From there he figured how much he had
to bet in racetrack pari-mutuel machines to make the low-played numbers come
up winners.  That part was perfectly legal.  The pari-mutuel machine bets
would lose, but the right numbers would come up and Schultz would pay out
less.  The "Abbadabba" nickname was a magic word (corrupted from
"Abracadabra"?) indicating that Berman was the magician of the numbers
racket.
     Overall this is not a perfect portrait of Dutch Schultz and the people
around him, and it could use a bit more action, but it is watchable and
enjoyable.  My rating is a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.

     The attack on the Palace Chop House could have been better researched.
Charlie "The Bug" Workman (I'm not making this up!) did the hit.  To make
sure he was not surprised by someone coming out of the restroom, he went
there first and shot the heavy-set man washing his hands.  He then burst out
of the john with a .38 in each hand and gunned down the three men at
Schultz's table.  Bug then realized the man in the john was Schultz and went
back in to rifle Schultz's pockets.  This is quite different from the scene
in the film.  Also, Schultz appears dead in the film.  Actually, Schultz
raved for about two days before dying.  I occasionally get mail from people
whose response to having inaccuracies pointed out is "What does it matter?"
That is never an easy question to answer.  In truth, historical accuracy is
its own reward.  It only matters if it matters.  To me it matters.
