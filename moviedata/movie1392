There are few respectable filmmakers in the world that would take on the
difficult challenge of creating a children's movie.  I don't mean those
hack directors who just sit behind the camera and yell "action" and
"print," but those few who take on the challenge of writing, directing,
producing, and even editing a successful film for the underage masses. 
Creating a fantasy world with non-abrasive violence, imaginative sets
and props, and engaging characters to follow is a tough process.  With
Spy Kids, Robert Rodriguez proves that his handling of adult fare
extends to kids' stuff, too.
My favorite films are from my childhood -- Flash Gordon, Willy Wonka &
the Chocolate Factory, Mary Poppins, the Muppets movies, Pee-Wee's Big
Adventure, and The Never-Ending Story -- and they all presented an
impossible world made real only by the power of imagination.  Spy Kids
ranks up there with the best children's films by creating implausible
scenarios made from martial arts stunts, gee-whiz spy gadgets, robots
built entirely of huge thumbs, a holodeck-like room filled with rolling
clouds and stretches of golden sands, and providing total escapism for
both kids and adults.
The story is simple and straightforward, and it zips along like a
sunburned child on a Slip & Slide.  Two kids, Juni (Daryl Sabara) and
Carmen (Alexa Vega), find out their parents (Antonio Banderas and Carla
Gugino) are real-life spies after they are captured by the diabolic
Floop (Alan Cumming), a man with a strange Sid and Marty Krofft-style
puppet show filled with enough goodwill to make Stuart Smalley envious. 
Floop's diabolic scheme is to build an army of robotic "spy kids"
powered by an artificial intelligence brain invented by Gregorio
(Banderas) in his past as a spy.
After their parents' abduction, the kids are thrown into a whirlwind
adventure of flying through the air with jet packs, setting Teri
Hatcher's hair on fire, fighting robots with electro-shock gumballs,
accessing databases with computerized sunglasses, and learning to
believe that your dreams can come true.
Imagination is the greatest asset of Spy Kids.  Rodriguez, who
previously worked as a comic strip artist UT-Austin's The Daily Texan
(as did our Editor in Chief, Christopher Null), deploys that creativity
throughout the production of Spy Kids, showing off sharp directing,
amazing set designs, inventive spy gadgetry, great acting from his cast,
and a fast-paced script that is action-packed and hilarious from the
first frame to the last.  The most memorable piece of the film is the
amazing mix of digital animation and costume designs that bring to the
life the beauty of Floop's TV show -- a magic world that's a crazy cross
between Teletubbies, Reading Rainbow, and Romper Room.
The standout performance of the film belongs to Alan Cumming -- the
multitalented stage and screen actor seen in such films as Company Man,
Titus, Get Carter, and GoldenEye.  His portrayal of Floop as the
misunderstand artist/genius/villain is a wonderful combination of Judy
Garland, Pee-Wee Herman, and Willy Wonka.  The image of Floop sitting on
a cloud in his virtual world, pondering the errors of his ways, is both
beautiful and subtly tragic.
Spy Kids is one of the best kids' films to grace the silver screen in
the last decade.  Altogether, it's a sharp and witty, action-packed film
that will entertain the kid and adult in all of us.

Directed by Robert Rodriguez.
Cast: Alexa Vega, Daryl Sabara, Carla Gugino, Antonio Banderas, Alan Cumming,

2001 - 86 minutes
Rated PG (for mild violence).
Reviewed by Dustin Putman, April 4, 2001.
For someone who has directed a blood-drenched $5,000 indie about a mariachi 
with a gun disguised as a guitar holder (1993's "El Mariachi"), a ghastly, 
foul-mouthed vampire epic (1996's "From Dusk Till Dawn"), and a high 
school-set horror movie about alien teachers (1998's "The Faculty"), it would 
seem like an odd choice for director Robert Rodriguez to next choose a family 
film, but that is what he has done. Then again, as he has proven thus far in 
his career, Rodriguez is completely disinterested in following a conventional 
filmmaking pattern, instead making any given movie in any genre that he feels 
like.
"Spy Kids" is a fun-filled, if slight, children's variation on James Bond, 
with two child protagonists, lots of action, spiffy special effects, and an 
overabundance of neat gadgets. There are no life-threateniong weapons to be 
found here, nor is there any graphic violence, proving that it is possible to 
make a quality action movie that the entire family will be able to enjoy 
equally.
Carmen (Alexa Vega) and Juni (Daryl Sabara) are siblings who live in peace 
and happiness with their parents, Gregorio (Antonio Banderas) and Ingrid 
Cortez (Carla Gugino). As Ingrid spins fascinating bedtime stories night 
after night about star-crossed lovers who originally were international spies 
on opposing sides, until they married and settled down, Carmen and Juni have 
no idea that the tales are actually about their own mother and father. 
Gregorio and Ingrid love their children, but after years of downtime, they 
thirst for their old jobs as spies, and quickly go off on an assignment. Not 
being as quick-witted as they once were, they are quickly captured by Fegan 
Floop (Alan Cumming), a dastardly children's show host who is planning to 
take over the world by creating robotic replicas of every child in existence. 
When Fegan's evil henchmen, including two played by Teri Hatcher (1996's "2 
Days in the Valley") and Robert Patrick ("The Faculty"), come looking for the 
Cortez offsprings, it is up to Juni and Carmen to go on the run, all the 
while setting off to rescue their parents.
While far from perfect, "Spy Kids" is an intermittently dynamite 
entertainment that, sure enough, manages to be exciting, with hair-raising 
stunts and plenty of non-violent fight scenes that have no danger of 
offending anyone. The visual effects are creative and mostly believable, 
particularly for the picture's relatively low $30-million budget, as they 
include underwater and aerial chases, a place called the Virtual Room that 
puts the characters into different settings that only appear to be there, and 
floors that drop out like jigsaw puzzles.
In transporting a James Bond thriller into a family movie, the screenplay, 
also by Robert Rodriguez, is imaginative and light-hearted, as he also throws 
in a few odes to his previous movies, including a very funny slow-motion shot 
of Carmen and Juni coolly walking down the aisle of a department store, 
equipped with sunglasses and long, draping clothing. I could have most 
definitely done without, however, some of the throwaway puns and jokey 
dialogue that are supposed to be clever and humorous, but come off as overly 
juvenile, even for a film targeted at the kiddies. These moments of corniness 
are thankfully brief and not abundant in number, so it is easy to ignore them 
and move your mind towards the next scene.
Directing children has to be a challenge for any director, especially if they 
are aiming for realism, and Alexa Vega (1999's "The Deep End of the Ocean") 
and newcomer Daryl Sabara are up to the challenge. Both succeed at dodging 
the ever-dreaded unctuous-factor, and interact like true siblings--ones who 
love each other, help each other out when things get rough, but are also apt 
to argue and feud. Pure performance-wise, Vega is a step above Sabara, as she 
is a really talented find, while Sabara still has a large amount to learn 
regarding subtlety. 
The adults play second banana throughout to the kids, with Carla Gugino 
(1998's "Snake Eyes") and Antonio Banderas (1999's "Play It to the Bone") 
underused, but effective, as the kidnapped parents, and Alan Cumming (2000's 
"Get Carter") a standout as the allegedly villainous Fegan Floop, who may or 
may not be slowly growing a conscious heart. Added amusement comes from a 
surprise cameo in the final scene featuring a big, "A"-list actor who has 
worked with Rodriguez in the past.
At a blink-and-you'll-miss-it 86 minutes, "Spy Kids" is needlessly brief, and 
could have benefitted from a little more development and a stronger third 
act, which comes off as anticlimactic. The fact that the movie is so 
fast-paced, no doubt, also contributes to the feeling that it is about twenty 
minutes too short. Flawed or not, "Spy Kids" is one of those rare breeds--a 
live-action family film that relies on intelligence and adventure to tell its 
story, rather than flatulence and doggy-do-do jokes.

Spy Kids  * * * out of * * * *
Starring: Carla Gugino, Antonio Banderas, Alex Vega, Daryl, Sabara, Alan 
Cumming, Teri Hatcher, Cheech Marin, Danny Trejo, Mike Judge, Tony Shalhoub.
Directed by: Robert Rodriguez         
Rated: PG (mild violence)
After the genuinely repellent "family" comedy "See Spot Run"...I was starting 
to think that the good family movie genre was out. Alas "Spy Kids" opens and 
goes against all I just said, but it is the best family movie to come out in 
long time, and is the best time I had at the theaters so far this year. The 
young actors prove themselves worthwhile, and the adult actors are just as 
great.
Surprisingly from the man who directed violent movies such as "Desperado" and 
"From Dusk Till Dawn" there is barely any violence let alone blood or gore in 
this movie. Robert Rodriguez wrote, directed and produced this tale about two 
young kids Carmen and Juni Cortez who find out their parents (Carla Gugino, 
and Antonio Banderas) are international spies and have been kidnapped by an 
evil kids show host, who wants to take over the world. Of course the kids 
must take the action upon themselves and save their parents by using the 
nifty gadgets, spy equipment etc. 
In the end the film is a rewarding experience worthy of multi viewings, and 
your kids and even yourself will find yourself loving this film. Young Alex 
Vega and Daryl Sabara (sister and brother characters) play Carmen and Juni 
Cortez, the two seem to be real life friends as they work great together and 
have a good onscreen chemistry. Carla Gugino (Snake Eyes) and Antonio 
Banderas (Desperado, Assassins) play the parents of the kids, and also have a 
surprising amount of strong chemistry between the two.
As for the supporting cast Alan Cumming (Spice World, and the current Josie 
and the Pussycats) plays the scheming bad guy and is a very good actor. He 
seems to be having fun as the bad guy, and some surprising information is 
given about him in the end. Teri Hatcher has a small role, and in her role 
she is deliciously diabolical and funny as well. Some other great cameos 
include many people from Rodriguez's earlier movies.
Rodriguez's cleverly written and witty script is that of a great one. His 
dialogue is snappy and comes quickly out of the actors/actresses's mouth. His 
plot is very easy for younger people to understand and follow, and has no 
sex, scatological humor, bloody/violence or even cussing. Only a mild amount 
of violence occurs in the film, and it's much nice to see this than some man 
falling out of a window with his pants off into dog poop.
"Spy Kids" is one of the funniest movies I've seen so far in the year 2001, 
and is the best kids movie so far. See it with your entire family, and even 
those who aren't fans of kiddy movies you might find yourself having a lot of 
fun with this one. A winner.

In SPY KIDS, two kids, following in the footsteps of their parents, get 
a MISSION IMPOSSIBLE assignment into a WILLIE WONKA land.  Writer and 
director Robert Rodriguez, whose unlikely background is in R-rated films 
such as THE FACULTY and DESPERATO, makes an impressive jump into a 
barely PG-rated world.  An intelligent picture that doesn't talk down to 
the kids or the adults, SPY KIDS is that rare film that can wear the 
badge of "family fare" with pride.  It's also imaginative, well cast and 
quite funny.
Just before they become parents, Gregorio and Ingrid Cortez, played with 
humorous bravado and just a hint of sensuality by Antonio Banderas and 
Carla Gugino, have to give up their day jobs as secret agents.  Now 
telecommuting as espionage consultants, they're itching to get another 
save-the-world field assignment from the OSS.  But, when they do, all 
they can think of are the kids, 12-year-old Carmen (Alexa Vega) and 
8-year-old Juni (Daryl Sabara), who are at home under the watchful eye 
of "Uncle" Felix (Cheech Marin).  
Carmen is a confident charmer, who makes a great role model for young 
girls.  A spunky hero, she says what goes for the story's only 
profanity.  "Oh shiiiiitake mushroom!" she exclaims once when things go 
really bad.  And Juni, who conquers fears so intense that they used to 
cause warts, shows how a youngster can summon the courage within him to 
rise to the challenges of a treacherous situation.
The kids, who bicker like typical siblings, are sure that their parents' 
lives are dull and boring.  "What are you talking about?" Carmen asks 
her Uncle Felix when the literal "Red Alert" warnings going off in their 
house force him to tell them the truth about their parents' profession.  
"My parents can't be spies.  They're not cool enough."  (Let that be a 
warning to children everywhere.  Your parents may be hiding some amazing 
talents that you know nothing about.)
The fun starts when the movie begins to show off its large array of 
futuristic gadgets that would make James Bond envious. These goodies 
range from electrostatic gum that stuns better than Mace to acid crayons 
for cutting through jail bars.  An evil Willie Wonka-like character 
named Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming) kidnaps the parents.  Floop, who has a 
popular kids' TV show featuring humorously grotesque figures called 
Fooglies, is assisted by a sappily subservient Tony Shalhoub as Minion.
Among the many humorous characters, none are better than the bad guys 
known as the Thumb-Thumbs.  Their torsos have large thumbs where the 
head, arms and legs should be.  These clumsy oafs are, well, all thumbs.  
Writer and director Rodriguez, however, has the steady hands of a 
surgeon as he assembles a richly complex film that is a treat for the 
eyes, the mind and the funny bone of those young and old, as my son and 
my mother can attest. 
SPY KIDS runs 1:30.  It is rated PG for action sequences and would be 
acceptable for all ages, as our packed multigenerational audience amply 
demonstrated.
My son Jeffrey, age 12, loved the picture, giving it *** 1/2.  He found 
it funny, interesting and very creative.  He particularly liked the way 
that whole plot was constructed.

To tell you the truth, "Spy Kids" was not what I had
originally intended to review.  I actually bought a
ticket to see a more sophisticated spy thriller called
"The Tailor of Panama."  There were still about 15
minutes before that film was to begin, so I decided to
sneak into an adjacent theatre to kill some time.  I
didn't expect to stay too long because the idea of
watching a pre-teen brother and sister team lurch
their way through a mission to save the world seemed
like an agonizing idea.  Surprisingly, the first 15
minutes established a fair amount of pace and showed
the promise of entertainment and imagination.  And
before I knew it, I had actually stayed and watched
the whole movie.  Thinking back, I'm glad that I did.
It certainly wasn't the acting that fueled this story.
 Since the target audience consists primarily of
pre-teens, this film feels more like a revved up
bedtime story with cartoonish characters rather than a
polished thriller.  After all, the heroes are a
12-year-old girl named Carmen (Alexa Vega) and her
younger brother Juni (Daryl Sabara).  Both possess a
spunky likableness without the saccharine demeanor of
that kid from the "Home Alone" films.
Meanwhile, the villain, Fegan Floop (Alan Cummings),
is a popular children's television show host.  He
resides in a magnificent palace whose interior seems
to be lifted from the blueprints of Willie Wonka's
Chocolate Factory.  There, he carries out his
diabolical plan and controls his army of clumsy
minions who are literally all thumbs.  But no matter
what you think of pre-teen spies and fanciful
villains, you'll find this overall movie watching
experience enjoyable.
Gregorio (Antonio Banderas) and Ingrid (Carla Gugino)
Cortez are former super-secret agents.  Now wed, they
have retired to raise their children, Carmen and Juni.
 They have never told their children about their past,
hoping to put that life behind them.  But they are
called back into action when fellow operatives start
disappearing and Fegan Floop and his minions
areuhfingered.  But years of inactivity result in
their quick capture.  With their parents now
prisoners, it's up to Carmen and Juni to save them and
the world. 
For much of the movie, its pretty straightforward as
the kids use is a bevy of wildly inventive gizmos to
make their way towards Floop's stronghold while
dodging his various henchman.  Yet the film is
unexpectedly flashy in its use of quick edits, giving
this James Bond-for-kids film grown-up hipness.  There
are many amusing moments as well, such as the
inevitable bickering between the siblings and the
general state of ineptness of Floop's minions.  It
also exhibited a continued spirit of imagination,
featuring special effects that made this film seem
more expensive than its reported price tag of $35
million.
"Spy Kids" is a fine family film.  It not only
provides 90 minutes of entertainment, but it also
effectively forwards the notion of family, teamwork,
brotherhood, and the importance of children.  Like
Gregorio and Ingrid who worked hard to successfully
balance their family life with their lives as agents,
the film also works hard to find the right balance
between an easy-to-digest film for kids and an
entertaining film for adults.  This mission is
adequately accomplished.  "Spy Kids" nicely combines
fantasy and fluff with several laughs and several
valuable lessons.

One of the best things about my job is that, every so often, a film
still catches me by surprise. "Spy Kids" certainly did. An adventure
story aimed primarily at children, the movie is smart, zippy fun. The
production neither panders nor talks down to its audience. The brother
and sister at the center of the tale are believable, likable kids and
their parents are  get ready for this  intelligent, capable and
loving. Bathroom humor is kept to a minimum and the numerous well-staged
action scenes avoid excessive violence. What a relief it is to be able
to review an all-ages film on its artistic merits and not its ethics.
Consider the other PG rated "family friendly" movie in theaters now.
"See Spot Run" has a mother going out of town, leaving her son with an
idiot neighbor. Body function humor abounds, including a slapstick bit
that has the adult male lead repeatedly falling in dog poop. What really
disturbs me are the jokes that bookend the film. The story begins with a
police dog capturing a mobster and biting off one of his testicles in
the process. At the hospital, the doctors explain that they replaced the
testicle with a metal ball and joke that the victim is lucky the dog
didn't bit off the other one, because two metal replacement balls would
clack together. Of course, the movie ends with the dog biting off the
remaining testicle and shows prisoners laughing at the criminal as he
clacks past their cells. Somebody clue me in  when did genital
mutilation become funny?
"Spy Kids" is a welcome antidote to the repellent "See Spot Run," using
imagination instead of cruelty and crudeness. Carmen (Alexa Vega) and
her younger brother Juni (Daryl Sabara) live in a beautiful seaside home
with their parents, Gregorio (Antonio Banderas) and Ingrid Cortez (Carla
Gugino). Mom and Dad are a sultry couple devoted to their children. What
the kids don't know is that they are also former spies. Once agents from
different countries assigned to "erase" each other, they instead fell in
love, married and retired to raise a family.
Needless to say, they get drawn back to the business. Shortly into their
first joint mission, they are captured and end up in the headquarters of
Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming), a foppish hybrid of Willy Wonka and Pee Wee
Herman who hosts Juni's favorite TV show. But there is evil behind the
scenes, as inventors prepare an army of robots disguised as children.
Papa Gregorio has the device necessary to radically increase the
efficiency of the creatures and the bad guys will stop at nothing to get
it from him.
Back at home, "Uncle" Felix (Cheech Marin) shows up to reveal Mom and
Dad's secret to the kids. After a brief respite at a safe house filled
with enough cool gadgets for a dozen Sharper Image stores, Carmen and
Juni set off to find their parents and save the world, zooming through
the sea in a submarine pod that looks like a goldfish, while a slew of
wicked people (including Teri Hatcher) chase them.
During the course of their adventures, they get to use jet packs,
electroshock bubblegum and super-computer sunglasses. They watch as
secret agents are transformed into bizarre creatures with Silly Putty
faces and used as background characters on Floop's TV show. They deal
with guards that have huge thumbs where their arms, legs and heads would
normally be (Why are the guards so ineffective? Because they're all
thumbs!) They move from one colorful locale to another, including a
nifty virtual reality room reminiscent of the holodeck from "Star Trek."
The storyline is silly and convoluted, but even at its most dense, it is
easier to follow than either "Mission: Impossible" movie.
Director Robert Rodriguez ("From Dusk to Dawn") maintains a frenetic
pace, with the whole film clocking in at a mere 86 minutes. A bit less
action and a little more character development would have been nice, but
he does provide enough quiet moments for viewers to become fully
invested in the family. Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara make an agreeable
brother and sister team, squabbling the way kids do, but coming together
when it counts. Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino are even better as the
parents; they quickly establish and maintain a great lusty chemistry
while keeping their tongues properly in cheek during the action scenes.
Even the usually irritating Alan Cumming has some nice moments  a
virtual cloud-backed chat between his character and Juni is one of the
best segments in the film.
Had Rodriguez added a few more scenes like that, I would have enjoyed
the film more (and I definitely could have lived without the glaring
product placement for a certain Mc-ubiquitous company). Regardless, "Spy
Kids" is a hoot, offering fun for adults and children alike. And just
think, they managed to do it without sacrificing a single testicle.

Leave it to Robert Rodriguez to make a high-octane kiddie pic largely set in
Mexico and full of music straight from his Hollywood calling card, El
Mariachi.  If I had seen Spy Kids as a child, it would have blown my mind,
and it's easy to envision the sequel-ready blockbuster-to-be becoming a Star
Wars for today's grammar school crowd.
Kids is about a brother and sister who, unbeknownst to them, are the
offspring of two of the world's top secret agents.  The film opens with
mother Ingrid (Carla Gugino, Snake Eyes) telling young Carmen (Alexa Vega)
and Juni (Daryl Sabara) a bedtime story called "The Two Spies Who Fell in
Love."  The story, of course, is a non-fictional account of how she and
husband Gregorio (Antonio Banderas, Play It To the Bone) met, fell in love
and decided to trade in a life of espionage for parenting.  They've been out
of the spy game for years but still maintain old contacts and keep up on the
latest international terrorist news.
Meanwhile, the star of a children's Teletubby-ish TV show is threatening to
wreak havoc on the world (what would a spy film be without a guy like
this?).  It seems that Floop (Alan Cumming, Get Carter), the star of
"Floop's Fooglies," has been capturing spies and turning them into mutants
for his show.  His goal, apparently, is to create a race of atomic
super-robots that he will use to do his bidding.  Floop has a sidekick named
Minion (Tony Shalhoub, Galaxy Quest) who is the real brains of the
operation - a Sideshow Bob, if you will, to Floop's Krusty the Clown.
The catch is that Floop and Minion need an intelligence prototype created by
Gregorio to complete their dastardly creations.  They kidnap Gregorio and
Ingrid, leaving the two kids to rescue their parents, and the world.  Carmen
and Juni get to play with all kinds of cool gadgets and modes of
transportation that, frankly, put the recent James Bond films to shame. They
also engage in typical sibling battles with each other while they battle
Floop's henchmen and cronies.
The special effects in Kids range from really cheesy to quite staggering (at
least for a kids' film; we're not talking The Matrix here). Rodriguez has a
reputation of making expensive-looking films for peanuts, and he doesn't
disappoint here.  Kids cost $36 million, but it looks like two or three
times that amount was used.  To keep costs down, Rodriguez, as usual, wore
many hats on the set, serving as producer, editor, director, writer, sound
mixer and visual supervisor.  Vega and Sabara helped out by insisting they
perform most of their own stunts.
The casting here is pretty decent, with Vega the only real standout.  There
are a bunch of actors that contribute tiny parts (Teri Hatcher, Robert
Patrick), including some veterans of Rodriguez's other films (Cheech Marin,
Danny Trejo) and one superstar cameo from the director's From Dusk Till
Dawn.  Kelly Preston was originally cast in Gugino's role but backed out
because she had just given birth to an evil little Scientologist
Kids reminded me a lot of Cloak & Dagger, a similar kid-oriented spy caper
from the early '80s that starred a hot-off-E.T. Henry Thomas.  Like Dagger,
this film doesn't dumb down the action for really young kids and, as a
result, makes the picture a lot more enjoyable for older kids and adults.

Susan Granger's review of "SPY KIDS" (Dimension Films/Miramax)
            The family that spies together, stays together. That's the homespun philosophy behind this fantasy that pairs two "retired" spies with their unsuspecting children in a rousing adventure. It all begins with the Cortez kids,  8 year-old Juni (Daryl Sabara) and 12 year-old Carmen (Alexa Vega), listening to their favorite bedtime story, "The Two Spies Who Fell In Love," which reveals, through flashbacks, how their parents (Carla Gugino, Antonio Banderas) met and married. The Cortezes are now "consultants" but eagerly jump back into action when former associates mysteriously disappear. But their past still mystifies their squabbling siblings who protest, "Our parents can't be secret agents. They're not cool enough!" However, after a hasty trip down a hidden passageway to an escape pod that becomes a submarine, not only are Carmen and Juni convinced, but they're propelling the action, rescuing their parents from the evil clutches of Fegan Floop, a TV kiddie-show host (Al!
an Cumming, resembling Pee-Wee Herman), and his Floogle army of robotic children and Gumby-like "thumb-thumbs." Innovative, imaginative film-maker Roberto Rodriguez ("Desperado,""From Dusk Till Dawn") creates empowered junior James Bonds, wide-eyed with delight at their wacky, Willie Wonka-like gadgetry, while fostering pride in Hispanic culture. Teri Hatcher, Tony Shaloub and Cheech Marin head the supporting cast  - with a quirky George Clooney cameo and groovy music. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, the PG-rated "Spy Kids" is a fast-paced, family-friendly 7. You can bet your electroshock bubble gum that, given the proper marketing, this could develop into a formidable franchise.
