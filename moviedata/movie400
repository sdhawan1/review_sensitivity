Charles Bronson doing comedy? Well, I've hardly
seen any of his movies, just heard of action or
westerns where he's a tough guy with a gun.
The western genre is not my favorite, since many
of them lack originality. It's the same old thing
in most of them: an outlaw, a sheriff and a bank
or farm to fight about and a twist of love. Some
manage to stand out though, like this one. Graham
Dorsey and his gang is on the way to rob a bank
in a small western town and stays at the isolated
house of a young widow, Amanda, to steal a horse.
While the others stay on, Dorsey stays at the
house with the beautiful woman. They very quickly
fall in love with each other (if you buy that a
woman would fall in love with a man who first tried
to rape her). They spend a few wonderful hours
together. Afraid of getting caught, Dorsey leaves
Amanda. On the road to the town, he quickly changes
clothes with a travelling salesman, then escapes
with the salesman's goods. The salesman, wearing
Dorsey's clothes, is killed by the posse. Believing
that he is dead, Amanda and a ghost writer writes
a tearjerker about their few hours together which
becomes a success. The story is not completly true,
she has rather refined the story to make it sell better.
It's a quite nice little movie, not overlong or
filled with clich√©s. The only thing I found disturbing
was Amanda's reaction when Dorsey returned. Who
could anyone not recognize Bronson if they had met
him once. Amanda, played by Bronson's wife Ireland
is a good actress too. That she was forty when the
film was made is hard to believe, she looks more
like twentyfive.
