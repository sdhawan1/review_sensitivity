On a dark afternoon, a young man named Katadreuffe is just sworn in as a
lawyer.  The way he chooses to celebrate this achievement is to visit his
enemy, a court bailiff named Dreverhaven and slam a knife on his desk.
Later we see Katadreuffe leaving the building covered with blood.  Soon
we learn that Dreverhaven was stabbed to death with the very same knife,
and the new lawyer is arrested on suspicion of murder.  This provides a
setup for him to unfold his life story through the police interrogation.  
Set in the 1920's Rotterdam, "Character" is a good-looking piece of
melodrama from the first-time director Mike van Diem.  It follows
Katadreuffe's life, out of wedlock from a one-night stand between the
brooding and stony bailiff Dreverhaven and his housekeeper Joba.  She
refuses his marriage proposal and raises her son alone.  He grows up with
strong resentment for his father, and Dreverhaven's action does not help
to improve this relationship either.  He sets numerous obstacles in his
son's road to success, only to watch him jump through the hurdles one
after another by the young man's stubborn and persistant effort.  The
tension between father and son continues to escalate to the point that
it finally ends with a knife.  
The weakness and the appeal of "Character" is its unrestrained passion
displayed among the three members of the family, especially between
Dreverhaven and Katadreuffe.  Hate mixed with love flying and spilling all
over the place, it is easy to be affected, yet hard to completely
understand these characters' motivation and minds.  The most
puzzling and contradictory person is Deverhaven. He appears to
be a ruthless, terrifying man who throws poor people out of their homes
into the streets.  He seems to enjoy making life difficult for his own
son.  On the other hand, he has his reasons -- he believes building
one's character requires hardship and endurance.  Ironically, it all works
very well for his son.  He does not disgard Joba when she is pregnant,
even though he has forced her.  Instead he kept asking her "When is our
wedding?"  He is clearly tired of living, and makes attempts to get
himself killed only to fail.  One can only speculate his degeration to
such a sad existence since the movie refuses to give us any clue about
why.  He is the mysterious father figure that no one understands.  Jan
Decleir has a truly chilling presence on screen as a heavy, intimidating
figure of power, authority and ruthlessness that the mere sight of him in
that black coat and hat can inflict instant fear in the hearts of the poor
and of his own son.  He doesn't have many words, but always casts a shadow
everywhere in the film.  
If the father is intimidating, the mother is no more approachable.  She
seems to enjoy being the only person in the world to drive the mighty
Deverhaven crazy.  She ignores the boy's emotional needs forever.  She
hardly even says a word.  Years later, when her son asks why she did not
marry when his father proposed to her, she is still a stone wall.  She is
so cold and distant that it is almost inhuman.  Again no explanation is
provided and she remains mysterious until she takes all her secrets into
the grave.  
With dysfunctional parents like these, it is no wonder that Katadreufe is
emotionally messed up.  He is a passionate child, with no one to turn to.
He turns out to be unable to release himself from the extreme desire to
piss off his father, or perhaps subconsciously to please him and meet his
expectations.  As stubborn and proud as his parents are, he fights his way
up in a small law firm from the lowest level.  By a faint light, we fancy
the same kind of self-torturing hard struggle in a young Deverhaven years
ago, and the same kind of disillusion when he gets everything he had
wanted, yet realizes that he has lost any chance to find love and a
healthy normal life.  The line between love and hate is blurred.  When his
mother is so indifferent to him, we suspect that even the harsh treatment
from his father is welcome deep down in Katadreuffe's mind -- at least he
gives a damn about him, even if it's mean-spirited.  
Compared to this really dysfunctional family, the movie provides a couple
of rather interesting supporting roles.  Lorna Te George is Katadreuffe's
office coworker who is let down by his failure to express his love for her
(because of whatever demon he has).  De Gankelaar is K.'s boss and mentor
who tries to substitute for a sensible and loving father to him.  He has a
protruding jaw that reminds me of Billy Bob Thornton's Karl Childers in
"Sling Blade", with a warm and understated tenderness.  K.'s only friend
Jan, his mother tenant, is a fun-loving young man and a communist.  These
are K.'s only chance to escape his family and connect to a normal
emotional world, but his blood and destiny pulls him back to his dark
father.  
As a directorial debut, Mike van Diem displays a great deal of confidence
and sophistication in his work.  The tension and passions are pushed to
the highest level, because he never tries to hold it back.  Such approach
often leads to something completely over-the-top, but the nice
performances by the entire cast have prevented it.  Instead, we are
affected by them rather than feeling silly or disbelief. He also shows a
very sure hand in the movement of camera and the transitions between two
scenes.  It's a good thing that van Diem refuses to explain everything to
us including what's on the characters' minds, but some crucial points
become too vague for the audience to identify with or understand.  Another
problem is that the tone throughout the movie is so decidedly and
stubbornly dark and suffocating, that it becomes rather humorless and a
bit too heavy from time to time.  
If the direction is not quite over-the-top, unfortunately the music is.
Always ready to increase the sense of fear, rage, hatred, pain, etc. etc.,
it is just too much.  I feel that the music tries too hard to tell the
story that it loses its effect after a while, as if it was trying to
scream at the audience to tell them how they should feel.  
The things I enjoy the most about this film are the cinematography and
production design.  Filmed in Poland to replicate the scenery of an old
Rotterdam, it is full of symbolic tall and dark buildings that cast
shadows of terror upon one's heart.  The cinematography is truly gorgeous
and breath-taking.  With most scenes shot in the rain, at night, in the
shadows of the houses and under cloudy skies, it effectively creates the
moody world of despair and melancholy.  It is a perfect example of
beautiful camera work becoming a central element of the movie.  It is
simply wonderful to look at.  
Overall, I find it a quite handsomely done piece of work.  I have to
admit that I enjoy watching such bold effort to throw passions at the
audience without holding back.  Grade: B+.

ps. I was rather disappointed to find out that someone beat me at pointing
out the fact that "Character" and "Star Wars" have strong similarities.

Character starts with a scene that makes no sense. A young man drives a
knife into the desk of an older man, tells him that he's become a lawyer
and walks away. Who is this kid? Why is he so pissed off? And who is the
old guy and why does he just sit there so emotionlessly? Don't worry 
you'll find out all of the answers because the film is told in
flashback.
The young man is Katadreuffe (Van Huet). Arrested for the murder of the
elder gent, Katadreuffe tells his life story to the Rotterdam cops. I
have a feeling that in real life, the cops wouldn't so much want to hear
about your whole life, but this is just pretend, so I digress.
Katadreuffe explains that the old guy is really his father, a powerful
but super-frigid bailiff named Dreverhaven (Decleir). He was born out of
a one-time affair between Dreverhaven and his equally stoney
housekeeper, who decides to raise the baby on her own. Dreverhaven asks
to marry her, but she moves out and even refuses his monthly offer of
cash for over a year.
Raised in both squalor and total silence, young Katadreuffe is
constantly bullied by the other children, who call his mother a whore.
Whore is apparently the same in every language, a fact that makes me
warm inside. Anyway, he turns to his only source of stress release and
education, an English encyclopedia set (complete only through the letter
"T") found hidden away under the stairs. You just know it won't be long
before he starts yanking on his bootstraps.
After an unsuccessful venture as a cigar-store owner, Katadreuffe is
forced into bankruptcy and, as a result, into the town law firm. He
begins to clerk there and finds out that his debt is not owed to the
bank, but to Dreverhaven. Thus sets the catalyst for the competition and
eventual showdown between father and son.
Fedja Van Huet plays Katadreuffe with a touch of Rufus Sewell's
wide-eyed Dark City gaze and a dash of Robert Downey, Jr's Chaplin. The
Dreverhaven character is easily one of the most diabolical and menacing
of recent memory. Even the name conjures images of Keyser Soyze's past.
Set in the early 20's, Character looks and feels like a cross between
Metropolitan and The Hudsucker Proxy, presenting Rotterdam as the most
abysmal place on earth (at least since The Winter Guest). It won the
Academy Award for Best Foreign Film and, get this  actually  deserved
it!

CHARACTER  (director: Mike van Diem; cast: Fedja van Huet
(Katadreuffe),  Jan Decleir (Dreverhaven), Betty Shuurman (Joba
Katadreuffe), Victor Low (De Gankelaar), Tamar van den Dop (Lorna te
George), Hans Kesting (Jan Maan), 1997- Netherlands)
The somber experiences of a Dutch boy growing up during the 1930s in
Rotterdam and raised by a house maid mother who refuses her employer's
offer of marriage after he impregnates her after one time of lust.This
dark story is a tale of revenge and hatred for these three characters,
as they try to come to terms with each other. It is told in flashback,
with a voice-over.
The boy (Fedja) succeeds and becomes a lawyer despite all the obstacles
of a father's hatred, a mother's coldness and silence; and, his poverty
and illegitimate birthright. In the opening scene, we are left with the
impression that Fedja knifed his father to death. The police grill him
and, thusly, his life story unfolds. We learn of the boy's character:
how he is ruled by hatred for his father, making his life focus
singularly on succeeding at any cost, even giving up his one chance for
happiness by not courting the lovely bookkeeper (Tamar), who works in
his office. We never get to fully understand his mother's (Betty)
character, except that she is an enormously proud person, and shows
great strength in raising her son without any help. She does not hate
him, yet she displays no affection for him except to protect him with
her motherly instincts from the dangers of the outside world, a world
she has shut herself off from. She takes in a border, a young communist
(Jan), who lends some humanity to her rigid life. We don't know why, but
she never has another man after her marriage refusal.
The father is the most feared bailiff in town, collecting debts and
throwing people out of their homes when they fall behind in their
payments. His character is shown by his motto: "The law is without
compassion." His bravery is a result of his death wish, is the opinion
of those who know him best. He is a man deeply tormented by troubling
thoughts of demonic proportions, a character molded out of the Old
Testament.
Fedja tries desperately to escape from his karma, but can't. The lawyer
who hires him (Victor), believes in him and tries to show him some
humanity, becoming his mentor and counsel in his bankruptcy hearings.
But even he can't penetrate Fedja's severe emotional problems. The crux
of the film is about the battle of wills between father and son, and how
hatred reduces the family to have no future. The father is devastated by
Betty's refusal to accept his marriage proposal. The mother has given up
on life and has nothing more to give. And Fedja's pursuit of his goal,
has left him in a hopeless situation, with no chance for securing love
or happiness.
Tremendous emotional energy is brought to the screen by an excellent
story and exceptionally fine performances.This a dark film, and it is
grimly shot , reflecting this dire mood. What is troubling about the
film, is that no alternative way out of this dilemma was explored. In
any case, it is better this way than the usual sentimental Hollywood
rags to riches treatment of such a story.This film is more in the spirit
of reading someone like Dickens, with strong oedipal emotions added to
the bleakness of the story, as it is adapted from a novel by Ferdinand
Bordewijk .

   Stories abound about adolescent men who rebel against
their fathers in search of freedom.  "Character" deals with
such a rebellion, but with a difference: the young man on
whom the story centers has a dad who does not live with him,
seems to want nothing to do with him, and by rights should be
just about the last person a kid would want to free himself
from.  As the tale develops, however, we see that geography
notwithstanding, the stolid father is very much involved in the
lives of his boy and the lad's mother though he had not spent
a single day with either from the time the kid was born.
   What gives "Character" its claim to award-winning status (it
won the Oscar for best foreign language movie of 1997) is
only partly its gripping narrative.  Set in Rotterdam and filmed
by Rogier Stoffers, virtually the entire picture, directed by Mike
van Diem, is shrouded in shadow, symbolic of the despairing
mood of all of its principal male characters.  Taking place in
the 1920s, it exhibits a Netherlands populace ground down by
unemployment and becoming increasingly sympathetic to the
entreaties of the Communist Party--which urges the working
class to demonstrate and even burn down the factories of the
hated propertied classes.  Told in flashback, "Character"
opens on a violent confrontation between Katadreuffe (Fedja
Van Huet) and his larger-than-life father, Dreverhaven (Jan
Decleir) in a large loft-like office occupied by the older man,
who is entering figures in a ledger.  In the film's most
theatrical scene, the young man strides briskly to his father's
desk and almost literally flies at him, determined to do the old
man great injury.  When Dreverhaven is found dead of a knife
wound to the stomach, Katadreuffe is hauled away by the
police to a bleak cell where he is questioned by three
interrogators and proceeds to unfold the story of life with
father.
   From what we have seen so far, it appears clear enough
that the young man has murdered his father, but his crime
comes across to the audience as justified by circumstances. 
We learn that some twenty years earlier, Dreverhaven
seduced his housekeeper, Joba (Betty Schuurman), in a one-
night-stand that led to Katadreuff's birth.  Joba had left the
man's employ shortly after becoming pregnant and, like a nun
in the strictest orders, seems to have taken a vow of silence. 
Indifferent to her young son, she encourages him to earn his
own living and leave her house.  While many children brought
up in such Dickensian circumstances of poverty and neglect
might choose the road of drugs and crime, Katadreuffe
became determined to succeed in business but not without
trying: he sacrifices the possibility of a loving relationship with
the beautiful Lorna te George (Tamar van den Dop) in favor
of hard study in his endeavor to rise as high as he can in a
prestigious Rotterdam law firm.  Requiring a loan to pursue
his studies, he unwittingly accepts credit from a bank owned
by his emotionally remote father, who uses his position as
creditor to destroy the young man.
    "Karakter," as the movie is spelled in the original Dutch,
gets its title from the notion of the narrator (Katadreuffe) that
his character and that of his mother are quite different. 
Budgeted at three million dollars--a high figure by Dutch
standards--Mike Van Diem's movie, based on a novel by F.
Bordewijk, evokes the ways in which serious Dutch films, and
perhaps sober European films in general, differ from those
constructed by Hollywood studios.  As bleak as George
Sluizer's 1988 movie "The Vanishing"--which ends with the
burial alive of a man and his girlfriend but was remade by the
Americans with a more upbeat ending--"Character" is as bleak
a description of a father-son relationship as has been
portrayed on any screen.  What is particularly absorbing,
though, are the film's nuances.  Though at first view the brutal
Dreverhaven represents unmitigated evil, evicting his non-
rent-paying tenants by the busload and pressing bankruptcy
claims in the courts, he turns out to be a man with a
conscience under his fascist-like exterior.  He does not
dismiss his former housekeeper, Joba, as an insignificant
victim of his lust, but has a more puzzling set of feelings
toward her.  Even more engaging is the intricacy of his
dealings with his son: the movie veers toward an unexpected
twist in its concluding scenes, which stagger the imagination.  
   Van Diem unfolds the film with a succession of visceral
scenes, highlighted by one in which Dreverhaven, who
emerges from his bed naked to inquire about a communist-
inspired riot taking place outside his home, is stoned, kicked
and reviled by the unwashed masses.  As heavy as the movie
gets, Van Diem does not ignore the opportunity to inject some
humor into the piece, the fun represented by the kindly but
prognathic man who becomes Katadreuffe's mentor, and with
the possibility of romance evoked by the lovely Tamar van
den Dop as Katadreuff's co-worker, Lorna te George.
   Van Diem has a good feel for the period, permeating the
film with the automobiles of the twenties and extracting
examples of the cultural norms of the era.  Particularly
amusing is the custom of co-workers calling each other by
their last names even after months of familiarity.

Many films feature strange and convoluted family relations, but few
show them with the emotional strength and visual presentation of Mike
van Diem's Character.  This is the first picture I've seen of the five
that were nominated for Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film
this year; I can't say that this one is better than the others, but I am
certainly not disappointed with its winning of the award.  This is a
strong, bold film, powered by superb central performances from Fedja Van
Huet and Jan Decleir, and by some of the most striking imagery to come
out of any film in the last year.
Character, which takes place in the Netherlands around the 1930s,
revolves around young Katadreuffe (Van Huet), a young man who, at the
beginning of the picture, is seen confronting an aging man who has
apparently worked against him his entire life.  The story then jumps
ahead of time; the older man is dead, and Katadreuffe is being
interrogated by police officers.  The young man then tells his story,
beginning with his birth.  It turns out that the older man, Dreverhaven
(Decleir), is Katadreuffe's father.  Katadreuffe goes on to explain his
life story to the police officers.  
He speaks of his mother, Joba (Betty Schuurman), with whom he did not
get along.  He explains his failed efforts to begin his own business,
and his love for reading the few books he had at his disposal.  When he
is old enough, he goes to work at a law firm, and a lawyer named De
Gankelaar (Victor Low) takes Katadreuffe under his wing.  Katadreuffe is
forced to borrow a large sum of money at one point, and it turns out
that the bank from which he takes the loan is his father's bank.  From
that point on, the two men clash with animosity, and Katadreuffe does
everything that he can to beat his father.
Character tells a deep and immersive story of a complex father/son
relationship, but, on the surface, it's a fascinating and absorbing
film, always interesting to look at and effective as entertainment.  Van
Diem, who also co-wrote, does a fantastic job with direction, and keeps
the pacing swift and smooth throughout the picture.  The production
design, by Rikke Jelier, is interestingly colorless and fantastically
dark; the city streets and building interiors have such an authentic
feel to them that I never once questioned the on-screen image.  Rogier
Stoffers' cinematography is agitated and fascinating to watch; also
splendid is the heavy musical score by Paleis van Boem, full of thick
stringed instruments that fit the mood of the film perfectly.
The acting from the two leading men is superb.  Van Huet is a striking
presence, and plays this character with depth and complexity.  
Katadreuffe is an interesting person to begin with -- dignified,
determined, and extremely intelligent.  Van Huet conveys all of this and
more, layering the performance in brilliant subtleties and nuances
(watch how his demeanor changes in numerous ways depending on his
situation).  Decleir is equally good, but in different ways.  I
sometimes criticize a film for having a one-note villain (I shouldn't
refer to this man as a "villain," actually), but there's more to this
performance than is outwardly noticeable.  He seems like a bad man, but
what he actually does for his son warrants much consideration.  
There is so much to admire about the smooth and complete way that Van
Diem has brought this subject to the screen.  The film relies a lot on
plot and story, but without bogging down the characters in contrivances
and Things that Make you Think Twice.  I like how the story is
character-driven, but still features many interesting turns throughout. 
And, even though the film is inherently sad and has several tragic
moments, Van Diem never sentimentalizes the material.
But there's something profound at the center of Character.  The title
itself explains a lot of what the film is about -- are Dreverhaven's
intentions deeper than they first appear?  I think that they are. 
Viewers must remember that this is a man who has tried hard to be an
influence in his son's life.  He is a stern man -- perhaps he's just
plain mean -- but Van Diem is too smart to make this a character whose
intentions are clear.  Character is a film that never goes beyond its
boundaries -- it's a slick, entertaining, and honest picture about a
relationship so strange that it actually qualifies as realistic.

"Character," this year's Oscar-winner for Best Foriegn-Language Film, could
almost be the Dutch answer to "Les Miserables." It can't be sheer
coincidence that loaves of stolen bread are what set in motion the tragic
power struggle between Jacob Katadreuffe (Fedja van Huet), an ambitious law
officer worker, and his secret father, a merciless court bailiff named A.B.
Dreverhaven (Jan Decleir).
Twenty years earlier, Dreverhaven seduced his housekeeper Joba (Betty
Shuurman), an eerily silent young woman, and the one-time tryst resulted in
Joba's pregnancy. Though Dreverhaven offered both marriage and money, Joba
coldly refused to have any further contact with him, choosing to weather the
insults of her neighbors rather than wed a man so callous he evicts
destitute people -- even the sick -- from his properties without a second
thought.
Jacob grows up trying his best to keep his distance from Dreverhaven, only
to be drawn directly into his father's power when he unknowingly borrows a
sizable amount of money from Dreverhaven's bank. That major mistake will
come back to haunt the youth again and again as he tries to build a decent
life for himself in depressed 1920s Rotterdam. It seems every time Jacob is
on the verge of getting ahead, Dreverhaven turns up to knock him back down.
Adapted by screenwriter-director Mike Van Diem from the 1938 Dutch novel of
the same name by Ferdinand Bordewijk, "Character" is relentlessly grim, two
hours spent with a handful of miserable, monochromatic people, all of whom
are either unable or unwilling to reach out to one another.
That said, the movie is also extremely well-made, with much attention paid
to period detail and, since the actors are often non-verbal, to the
subtleties of its performances. First-time director Van Diem has bathed the
picture in a gorgeous gloss that complements the script's melodramatic
aspects; rain, shadows, fog and murky streetlights are all used to great
effect.
Jacob's fight to get out from under Dreverhaven's thumb is compelling, but
many viewers will find themselves wishing Van Diem had spent a bit more time
with some of the less angst-ridden figures in the story, such as Lorna Te
George (Tamar van den Dop), the co-worker who catches Jacob's eye, or Joba's
boarder, a fledgling Communist named Jan Maan (Hans Kesting) who resents his
snobby family. Though "Character" is fine for what it is, a little levity
would have made the gloomy atmosphere slightly less oppressive.

     CHARACTER, the winner of the 1998 Oscar for Best Foreign Language 
Film, is a fine motion picture about the relationships within a 
dysfunctional family in the Netherlands during the 1930s.  Even though 
the movie is set three-quarters of a century after Charles Dickens 
penned his final novel, CHARACTER has the feel of something written by 
the beloved Victorian author, with perhaps a little Franz Kafka mixed in 
for good measure.  
     The film tells the story of Katadreuffe (Fedja Van Huet), a young 
man who has made his mark in the world despite the conspiracy of 
numerous, diverse forces to keep him suppressed.  As a child, he wasn't 
an orphan, but he might as well have been.  His unmarried mother, Joba 
(Betty Schuurman), is a harsh, unloving woman who rarely speaks to her 
son.  His father, Dreverhaven (Jan Decleir), is the city's most detested 
bailiff, whose motto is "the law without compassion."  After being 
rejected by Joba, Dreverhaven wants nothing to do with his son, and 
works actively to place obstacles in his path.  The struggle between 
Katadreuffe and Dreverhaven turns into a personal war of attrition.  
This fuels Katadreuffe's single-minded goal to rise through the legal 
system, but costs him a chance at true happiness.
     Through his entire life, Katadreuffe is impelled by a need to 
escape from the shame of his birth and upbringing.  He uses 
Dreverhaven's contempt as a catalyst to push himself harder.  Dr. De 
Gankelaar (Victor Low), a lawyer who represents Katadreuffe in a 
bankruptcy hearing, sees great potential in the young man, and takes him 
on as an assistant.  From there, using money borrowed from Dreverhaven's 
bank, Katadreuffe applies himself exclusively to his studies in law.  
Unfortunately, his lack of social experience causes him to miss the 
subtle signs of attraction being exhibited by a co-worker (Tamar van den 
Dop), thereby ruining his lone opportunity at a happy marriage.
     Although Katadreuffe is CHARACTER's protagonist, the most 
fascinating individual in the film is Dreverhaven, who is played with a 
combination of malice and world-weariness by veteran actor Jan Decleir 
(ANTONIA'S LINE).  Dreverhaven's motives are far more complex than those 
of a typical villain.  Underneath his cold, harsh exterior, he is 
tortured by inner demons and permanently scarred by the sting of his 
rejected marriage proposal.  His feelings towards his son are unclear -- 
a mixture of shame, anger, bitterness, and, curiously, perhaps even 
pride.  He claims that his financial assault is designed to strengthen 
Katadreuffe's character ("I'll strangle him for nine-tenths, and the 
last tenth will make him strong," he states at one point), but it's 
really an attempt to assert control and prove his superiority.  Despite 
all of his money and his respected position in society, Dreverhaven is 
filled with self-loathing and a disgust with the odious process of 
living.  He risks his life frequently, causing many to wonder whether 
he's brave or seeking his own death.
     Dickensian elements abound, from the travails of the poverty-
stricken masses to the struggles of an (almost) orphan.  Director Mike 
van Diem has crafted the look of Rotterdam in the 1930s to resemble 
London of a century earlier (just replace the motor cars with horses-
and-buggies).  Politics play a small-but-important role in the film as 
Katadreuffe enjoys a brief flirtation with the communist movement, which 
stands in direct opposition to Dreverhaven and all that he stands for.  
Ultimately, everything comes down to the relationship between 
Katadreuffe and Dreverhaven, and the manner in which their constant 
power struggle shapes their futures.
     Actually, as it turns out, Dreverhaven doesn't have a future.  The 
film, which is structured as a series of flashbacks, starts with 
Katadreuffe being brought in for questioning by the police after 
Dreverhaven has been found murdered.  Unfortunately, this approach 
allows director Mike van Diem to employ one of my least-liked narrative 
techniques -- the voice-over.  And, as is almost always the case with 
this device, it is overused. 
     While CHARACTER tells an interesting story with well-developed 
characters, its Academy Awards victory is somewhat irksome, since I 
found it to be inferior to fellow nominee, BEYOND SILENCE.  Since both 
films are destined to receive some sort of distribution, viewers will be 
able to decide for themselves which is the better movie.  However, 
regardless of which one you prefer, one thing is certainly clear:  
CHARACTER and BEYOND SILENCE offer the kind of emotional depth and 
resonance that has become rare in Hollywood productions.

either leave them up or you leave them down."
