       Don't get me wrong -- I tend to appreciate Besson's naive,
       unashamedly romantic worldview, an artsy European sensibility
       gone thoroughly Hollywood. His 1994 Leon is exciting and
       absurdly moving, thanks mainly to the interplay between Jean
       Reno and a young Natalie Portman, and 1997's The Fifth
       Element is a goofy paean to love, L-U-V, that's even more of
       a hoot on repeated viewings. But his Joan of Arc is a mess,
       despite some stirring battle scenes and the mostly knockout
       presence of a close-cropped Milla Jovovich as the maiden
       herself.
       Jovovich, Besson's own personal muse through the making of
       his last two films (though they've since separated), is
       magnetic and energetic enough to play a credible Joan (as
       long as you believe Joan was not just a warrior, but also a
       fabulous, supermodel-level babe). And Besson remains a
       servicable action film director, though not an especially
       facile one. Leading her army against the seemingly
       impenetrable fortresses of the English, Joan's struggle
       against great odds is undeniably stirring, and Besson helps
       you understand how the French could believe, fervently, that
       God is on her side.
       Besson's big mistake, I think, is trying to dramatize the
       interior life of his subject. Yes, Joan had visions -- but I
       guarantee that whatever image a sympathetic audience conjures
       in its collective mind will be more compelling than the
       blue-eyed Christ figure on display in Besson's hallucinatory
       dream sequences. The whole conceit turns into a disaster
       right about the time Dustin Hoffman (billed as "The
       Conscience") shows up, spouting platitudes and sending poor
       Milla running around her cell, babbling like Ally McBeal.
       That's kind of a shame, since she does quite well up to that
       point, charging into battle with a banshee wail that suggests
       the eruption of a sublimated bloodthirstiness. That darkly
       attractive aspect of her character -- that she's as likely a
       charismatic madwoman as the vessel of the lord -- is more or
       less betrayed by the final reels, in which The Conscience
       browbeats her over the killing she's overseen and Joan starts
       to look like little more than a very confused young lady
       who's about to take a fall.
       Theatrical aspect ratio: 2.35:1

        This is the third Besson film I have seen. While I liked The
Professional very much, I pretty much loathed The Fifth
Element. Besson definitely has something recognizable that runs through
his films, but I wouldn't call it auteuristic. I'd call it
self-indulgence.
        It would be easy to say that many great filmmakers are
self-indulgent, but I'd be inclined to disagree. Fellini comes to
mind. His is a very a personal cinema, but it isn't marked by
self-indulgence because, while extremely personal in nature, he still
made his films for the audience. He communicated his own personal
feelings and view through his style, and when it worked,
which seems to have been the usual case, it was quite rewarding.
        Besson, on the other hand, seems to make his films mostly for
himself. It's as if he can't really decipher what an audience
will take from any given scene. There just always seem to be things in
his films that don't belong there or in any other film. It's as
if it makes sense in his head, but nowhere else, perhaps. The best/worst
example of this is The Fifth Element. This film just
makes very little sense. Nothing fits together and it becomes a series
of ludicrous images meant to be some sort of grand
tapestry-- ultimately, only mismatched and predictably silly episodes.
        While The Fifth Element is near-masturbatory, The Messenger
merely borders on delusions of grandeur. It endlessly
tries to reposition itself to look at Jeanne in some way that should
reveal her in a new light, but this only tends to be a hindrance
as it becomes increasingly hard for the audience to take on any sort of
alliance or alignment. While I think it is a great idea to try
and examine Joan of Arc from different perspectives, it just isn't done
right here. Usually, the best portraits do not lay judgment
on their subjects, but present them as they were or are. This movie
could have been Lawrence of Arabia, offering Joan as an
enigma and trying to find the hidden motive, but never once alleging to
truly know it and leaving the audience to make the final
assumption. That's involvement and that's connection for the audience.
Any of that in The Messenger really is not due to
anything or anyone other than Milla Jovavich playing Joan herself.
        While the purpose of the writing and direction seems to be
lacking, not knowing even whether it should try to judge the
subject, but, rather, seeming to make an assumption then pull away
haphazardly, unsure of what to do next, Jovavich seems
quite sure of herself. She establishes herself in her role and plays the
whole thing with great consistency. She constantly seems
obsessed and never backs down from that. The power of her performance
comes from the way she plays the obsession.
Sometimes it merely seems to be a driving force, and other times it
seems to be something that could pull her apart. She seems
to be the only one who really makes the subject her own, unafraid of
offending anyone with the way she portrays her
characters, while the rest of the production seems to float somewhere
above the decision or inclination to do the same.
        All this is not to say that the film is horrible. There are
indeed some good things within it, such as the wonderfully shot
battle sequences. They look amazing and really pull you in, only
faltering when they try to focus in on individuals. This is
because the only true character in the film is Joan. All supporting
characters are more like vague and useless charicatures,
mostly ridiculous. So, when the battle scenes begin to focus on these
characters, it just seems silly and uselessly orchestrated
and calculated. Still, this happens few enough times that the battle
scenes are still quite stunning, and, along with the very strong
performance of Jovavich, the film becomes much more watchable than it
would have been without.

MESSENGER: THE STORY OF JOAN OF ARC
RATING: 6 /10 --> Barely recommendable

Director Luc Besson decided to give the lead role of Joan of Arc to a lesser
known actress named Milla Jovovich, a woman probably best known for her part
in Besson's own ode to science-fiction called THE FIFTH ELEMENT. A balsy
move on his part, especially when you consider the big budget of this movie,
but one which we could all respect, considering the director's obvious
support for unproven talent. Oops, did I say "obvious support for unproven
talent"...I meant, obvious support for his wife! They were a married couple
during the filming of this movie, but separated soon thereafter. Oh
well...on to the review.
PLOT:
Young, religious, carefree French girl turns into a confident, focused young
adult who feels the hand of God leading her into battle with the English in
the early 1400s. After confronting the soon-to-be King of France with her
visions from above, he allows her to fight his war and reap the rewards
thereof. Soon thereafter, Joan is left to waddle with the voices inside her
head whose divinity suddenly come into question.
CRITIQUE:
Stylish, overlong, uneven, ambitious battle drama features some excellent
fight sequences, good performances by all involved (except Dustin Hoffman as
Dustin Hoffman in a robe) and a lagging third act which essentially turns
the story of a heroine fighting the battle of the good, into a psychological
drama about whether or not Joan was just cooky! This film starts off slow
with Besson spending too much time on Joan's revelations, while drowning us
with his usual panache for the stylish shots. Unlike others, I personally
didn't mind the modernization of this tale and actually started enjoying
myself once Joan led her willing army into battle. I was however torn
between how I should feel about Joan as Besson presents her to us as a
strong-minded, confident, fighter woman while allowing his lead actress to
portray her as a constantly teary-eyed, confused, schitzo with a supposed
plan. I wanted to feel for her, but eventually, I just lost any compassion
for her within all the confusion of her character.
Mrs. JoBlo disagreed with me and wholeheartedly enjoyed this film. She
thought the character of Joan was shown in all her strengths and weaknesses,
lending a stronger credibility to her persona. I did not see that. I wished
that Besson would have stuck to one story line in this picture, instead of
forcing us to withstand his own interpretation of what might've happened, in
that, Joan might just have been a psychologically disturbed woman with a
penchant for the grandiose. The film basically just ran too long for me with
the last act dragging the whole show to a standstill. Were they just voices
in her head? Will they allow her to confess her sins? Whatever. Seemed like
another movie altogether. I think I'm being harder on this picture because I
truly was enjoying its middle half with a female heroine strong enough in
her will to kick any Hollywood bullcrap action star in the balls and walk
away with her head up high. Jovovich also played her part very well,
considering the struggles within herself that Besson's script needed her to
portray. I personally would rather not have seen so much of her schitzo
side, which I believed to take away from the film's momentum, and would have
cut about thirty minutes from its length, but all in all, some cool battle
scenes, a hip but confusing lead character, great direction and just too
much esoteric psycho-babbling.
Some may like it for its battles and dislike its conscience-grinding
moments, others may like its head games and dislike its fight scenes. If
you're lucky, you'll like them both, but if you're not lucky, well...this
movie just ain't for you.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Director Luc Besson's formative years were spent following his parents,
scuba diving instructors, around the world. His early life was entirely
aquatic, which explains his 1988 film LE GRAND BLEU, dedicated to the deep
blue sea. Word on the street is that he wrote the draft scripts for that
film and THE FIFTH ELEMENT during his days in high school. Ironically, he
planned on becoming a marine biologist specializing in dolphins until a
diving accident at the age of seventeen rendered him unable to dive any
longer. He then got into film, and the rest as they say, is history.
Milla Jovovich's middle name is Natasha. She was born in Kiev, Ukraine and
started modeling when she was only nine years old. She is also a singer and
was married and divorced at the age of eighteen to actor Shawn Andrews, her
co-star in 1993's DAZED AND CONFUSED.
Actress Faye Dunaway was married to Peter Wolf, member of the J. Geils Band,
from 1975 to 1979.
Co-screenwriter Andrew Birkin also plays a role in this film as Talbot.

_The_Messenger:_The_Story_of_Joan_of_Arc_ (R) ** (out of ****)
Although the exact reasons for their estrangement have not been made
public (aside from the catch-all "irreconcilable differences"), after
seeing _The_Messenger_, I can only conclude that Milla Jovovich's
woefully unconvincing performance as the title character was a prominent
reason for director/soon-to-be-ex-husband Luc Besson's split with her. 
Joan of Arc, the legendary teen who guided the French army in their war
against England after hearing a message from God, is the role of a
lifetime for any young actress, calling on its portrayer to run the full
gamut of emotions: spiritual euphoria, steely determination and strength,
and ultimately great sadness.  The role calls for great range, and
Jovovich proves to not have any.  She wears the same look throughout the
entire film: eyes bulged, nostrils flaring, teeth gritted--the latter,
that is, when she's not shrieking at the top of her lungs.  Jovovich is
at her best when asked to use her modeling skills to serve as a blank
presence, as in her previous collaboration with Besson,
_The_Fifth_Element_; and what is in my opinion her defining role--the
slutty French exchange student who stole all of Kelly Bundy's boyfriends
on an episode of _Married..._with_Children_.  Required to do more as she
is in _The_Messenger_, Jovovich is clearly at her worst.
So when Joan meets her end tied to a burning stake, there is no sense of
tragic loss, only one of relief.  But that's clearly Jovovich's fault and
not that of Besson (though he must be blamed for casting with his
crotch), who works overtime to give the film a larger-than-life epic
quality that his heroine lacks.  He actually succeeds in part,
particularly in the visual department; his sometimes-surreal imagery is
divinely haunting.  He also gets some decent work from Jovovich's acting
support; John Malkovich and Faye Dunaway are creepy and creepier,
respectively, as the dauphin of France and his scheming mother-in-law. 
However, Besson makes other questionable choices, such as bringing Joan's
conscience to life in the final act in the form of... Dustin Hoffman. 
His distracting presence undercuts any dramatic momentum and tension
Besson could ever hope to build, with or without Jovovich in the lead.

JOAN OF ARC (M).  
(Columbia Tristar/Gaumont)
Director: Luc Besson
Stars: Milla Jovovich, John Malkovich, Faye Dunaway, Dustin Hoffman, Rab 
Affleck, Vincent Cassel, Tchecky Karyo, Pascal Greggory, Richard Ridings,
Desmond Harrington, Timothy West, Carl McCrystal
Running time: 158 minutes.
Joan of Arc was the illiterate peasant girl who, in the 15th
century, believed that God told her how to defeat the all-conquering
English army and restore Charles II to the throne.  She united the
dishevelled French army and routed the English at the siege of
Orleans.  But later she was denounced as a witch and burnt at the
stake.  Some five hundred years later she was canonised by the
Vatican, although her life is still the subject of much speculation
and controversy.
It's a story that has been told on screen many times before,
most recently in the earnest television miniseries, starring Leelee
Sobieski and Peter O'Toole.  However French director Luc Besson (La
Femme Nikita, The Professional, etc) gives this familiar story a
suitably epic treatment in this bold and bloody retelling of the
legend.  Besson has spared little expense in bringing the story to the
screen.  The costumes, the lavish production design, and the authentic
looking Czech locations all bring the era to life beautifully.
Thierry Arbogast's cinematography is also superb.
Although visually quite splendid, the initial sequences, which
deal with Joan's early visions, are a little clumsily handled.
However, Besson soon comes into his own with his assured direction of
the film's bloody and brutal battle sequences.  With Braveheart, Mel
Gibson established a new standard for medieval battle scenes.  Besson
enthusiastically follows that example with his spectacular centre
piece, the bloody siege of Orleans, which occupies much of the film's
150 minutes.  Besson efficiently captures the carnage and confusion of
battle, and he takes his cameras right into the thick of the
confusion.
But he also explores in some detail the fascinating politics
of church and state that ultimately decided Joan's fate.  Having
decided that she had outlived her usefulness, they both conspired to
rid themselves of the troublesome and charismatic Joan.
Milla Jovovich (The Fifth Element, etc) is superb as the
complex Joan, and she handles both the physical elements and the more
cerebral and emotional elements of the role effectively.  She is
especially good in portraying the difficulty Joan had in reconciling
her bloody actions as a fierce warrior with her deep religious
convictions.  Faye Dunaway is also great as Charles II's scheming
mother-in-law, who was also obviously the power behind the French
throne.  Dustin Hoffman makes the most of a small role as Joan's
conscience, while John Malkovich makes a nicely pragmatic Charles II.
Andrew Birkin's script often smacks of trite American
cliches and rather 20th century sounding dialogue.  While this may
offend the purists, it is nonetheless a wonderfully effective way of
bringing this 500 year old legend alive and making Joan's struggle
seem relevant for contemporary audiences.

   The latest food fight between France and England appears
to be about the quality of beef, but look below the surface
and you may find the talk of boycotts and vengeance to be
little more than an excuse to communicate hostility.  I suspect
that the folks in these two neighboring countries don't like
one another very much.  Given the length of European
memories, who could blame them?  The two formerly great
powers have been at each other's throats a number of times
during the past millennium dating back at least to the 14th
century when they fought the so-called Hundred Years' War. 
Who today sides with the French in that disaster?  Among
others, Luc Besson is one--naturally--and he directs "The
Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc" with a decidedly
Francophile bent.  The English are portrayed as a bunch of
sadists with caricatured features, full of obscene speech and
reckless taunts, in one case even engaging in a mind-
boggling act of necrophilism.
   Though not the first version of the epic story of the teen-
aged heroine who inspired her people to victory against the
invaders, Besson's "Joan" has a distinctly 1990s flair,
pandering to the MTV generation with swiftly-edited
flashbacks and surreal visions, abandoning poetic pretensions
in favor of a simple, rustic dialogue.  To his inestimable
credit, however, Besson--whose contributions to cinema
include the dazzling "La femme Nikita" (about yet another
sort of puckish French heroine)--avoids the excesses of Baz
Luhrmann's "Romeo and Juliet," an all-out kowtow to teens
and 20-somethings.  By genuflecting to modernity in language
and cinematography within moderation, Besson bestows on
us the most audience-friendly and humorous of cinema and
TV's productions about the legendary French fighter.  If Milla
Jovovich, who dominates the 140-minute film, looks older
than the nineteen-year-old she plays, that flaw can be easily
overlooked when we consider that her passionate
performance is nuanced enough to give us pause.  After
viewing "The Messenger," we wonder whether one of French
history's greatest persons, who was made a saint half a
millennium after her noble needs, may have been not so
much a devout visionary but an out-and-out lunatic, even a
schizophrenic--her disabilities actually contributing to her
heroism.
   Photographed in the Czech Republic and in the Loire
Valley region of France, Besson's rendition of the familiar tale
selectively runs through aspects of Joan's life that every
schoolchild used to know by heart.  At the time of Joan's birth
in Domeremy 1412 or thereabouts, the French and the
English were in the midst of a Hundred Years' War.  While
English invaders were harassing French soldiers, the region
now known as France was undergoing a civil war of its own,
the province of Burgundy actually fighting on the English side. 
Charles VII is intent on holding on to the territory under his
command and on being crowned king by the Church in the
traditional manner, in the city of Rheims--now under English
control.  Nothing short of a miracle appears able to liberate
Rheims from the invader, and Joan is to supply that marvel.  
   When Joan as a young girl witnesses the burning of her
village by the English and the rape-murder of her beloved
sister by a crazed English soldier, she is bent on vengeance
against all the enemy and, devout though she may be is
unable to forgive or to turn the other cheek.  Five years after
the trauma, Joan (Milla Jovovich) is determined to raise an
army under her command, but to do so she needs to
convince Charles, the Dauphin (John Malkovich), to turn his
army over to her command.  By this time, Joan has become
known throughout her world as the woman who hears the
voice of God commanding her to throw the invaders out. 
Convincing Charles of her mandate, she gets the army, fights
fiercely in vigorously photographed battles, but at the very
point at which Paris is within her grasp, she is sold out by the
now crowned King Charles VII--who is tired of her ravings
and eager to end hostilities against the English by diplomatic
compromise.  What happens to Joan after that is the stuff of
legend or chronicle, depending on your feelings about the
accuracy of the historical record.
   Though Milla Jovovich looks older and more sophisticated
than the illiterate 19-year-old peasant, she performs her role
well, with an acting range that goes from off-the-wall
dementia to testosterone-flamed semi-lunacy.  Jovovich, not 
a well-known performer except to those who remember her
from Spike Lee's "He Got Game" and Luc Besson's "The
Fifth Element," seems to have captured Joan's fire and, for
all we know, her outrageous visions that in a person of lesser
scope would be dismissed as schizoid ravings.  John
Malkovich at Charles VII provides much of the comic relief as
the man who would be king even if the coronation results in a
sell-out of his adjunct.  Being John Malkovich, he is
alternately coy, befuddled, weak-willed and amusing.  I
suspect, though, that audience judgments about this latest
"Joan" will depend on its tolerance, nay its enthusiasm or
lack of same, for Besson's determined modernization. 
Though the MTV-like flashbacks lack variety and the images
of God appearing first as rays of light piercing fast-moving
clouds, then as an actual, human Jesus caressing His
messenger, may strike some as kitsch, I found myself
sponging up the director's conceits throughout.  My view is
this: if in the 15th century, the characters in the armies would
appear all-too-human, their language filled with the local
slang and colloquialisms, why not translate those signs into
the current vernacular--even utilizing expressions as
obnoxious as this century's favorite filler, "y'know"?  If the
armies react to the burning arrows and speeding horses with
wide-eyed, caricatured wonder, why not come right out and
show the battle-weary troops with all their exaggerated
gestures and tics?
   The redesign works best in three scenes.  In one, a
bloodthirsty, barbaric English soldier, impatient with his
squirming rape victim, plunges a sword through her middle
and proceeds to rape the lifeless body to the amazed stares
of his slightly less brutal compatriots.  In another, Joan is
severely wounded by an arrow fired at close range as she is
ascending the fortress walls of the English.  She falls twenty-
five feet into the hands of her fellow soldiers in much the way
a modern-day purveyor of weekend "trust" seminars would
allow herself to plop limply and happily into the waiting arms
of her pals-in-therapy.  An extended scene between the
imprisoned Joan and her Conscience (Dustin Hoffman) allows
the viewers to raise doubts in their own minds about the
validity of Joan's visions and her motivations.
   When Aristophanes penned the play "Lysistrata" some two
and one-half millennia ago--a comedy about how the Greek
women locked their husbands out of their bedrooms until the
men lay down their arms--he hinted that wars and violence
are the exclusive province of the testosterone-bearers.  If
true, credit Joan as an exception.  If women must
occasionally lead the men into the fray, the cause, though,
would have to be just, the women convinced of its rightness.
Luc Besson adds to this contention with a film that does not
have the grandeur, the poetry, the range of "Lawrence of
Arabia" but makes up for its shortcomings by being eminently
user-friendly.

For moviegoers who think that the problem with today's cinema is its
reliance on subtlety and its lack of gore, Luc Besson (THE FIFTH
ELEMENT) has made just the movie for them, THE MESSENGER: THE STORY OF
JOAN OF ARC, a movie so over the top that it could become a campy cult
classic.
Shortly after the film opens, an 8-year-old Joan of Arc (Jane
Valentine), who later becomes famous for hearing voices, leading armies
and getting burned at the stake, witnesses the brutal murder and rape of
her older sister Catherine.  In 8MM, Joel Schumacher was criticized for
making a sleazy movie about a search for a snuff film.  Besson starts
his movie by showing a snuff scene.
Catherine is attacked by an animalistic English soldier with prominently
bad teeth.  (Poor dental health is so conspicuously featured in the
movie that you half expect a toothpaste product placement.)  After
pinning her to the door with his body, the soldier stabs her with his
sword and rapes her as she dies.  The camera switches frequently to
Joan's perspective, hidden behind the door that her sister is being
raped against.  Thus our horror is intensified by observing the rape
through the sister's eyes.  To dramatically underscore the point that
the English soldiers are like animals, we witness them before the rape
pouring stew on the top of the dirty table so they can then eat off of
it like dogs.
Soon afterwards in the movie, Joan sneaks into a church at night.  Like
a bad horror movie, Besson has the interior lit by huge flashes of
lightning.  As loud thunder crashes, Joan breaks into the box on the
altar where the communion chalice is kept.  Guzzling the wine until the
blood of Christ drips all over her face, chin and throat, she
accomplishes her mission of being at one with God.
Milla Jovovich (THE FIFTH ELEMENT) plays the 19-year-old Joan of Arc as
an escaped mental patient with an orgasmic intensity.  Her performance,
which at first seems quite impressive, quickly becomes tediously
repetitive.  A beady-eyed John Malkovich is the duplicitous Dauphin,
whom Joan helps become Charles VII.  Looking like she suffers from gas,
Faye Dunaway plays Charles's sourpuss mother, Yolande D'Aragon.
Most of the movie consists of confusing battle scenes of hand-to-hand
combat.  Frantically edited to match Joan's spastic energy, the scenes
are so full of gore that the MPAA should now retire the NC-17 rating.
If they can give this movie an R, which they did, then there is no point
any longer in pretending that the NC-17 rating even exists.  Besides the
despicable opening scene of a murder to enhance one's rape pleasure,
there are plenty of decapitations with blood spewing everywhere, severed
arms and general random acts of horrific depravity.  Joan does save one
man from getting his skull crushed by one of her soldiers who wants to
steal his teeth.
Besson shares the writing credits, if not exactly the honors, with
Andrew Birkin, the author of such gems as KING DAVID.  Among the
laughably bad lines is one uttered by The Conscience (Dustin Hoffman no
less).  "When does the pain end and the pleasure begin?" he asks Joan.
For THE MESSENGER's audience, it is as soon as the ending credits begin
to roll.
THE MESSENGER: THE STORY OF JOAN OF ARC runs one hundred and forty one
long minutes, but who's counting?  It is incorrectly rated R for strong
graphic battles, a rape and language.  It should be considered NC-17 and
would be inappropriate for anyone less than a high school senior.
Sadly, there was an 8-year-old next to me and other kids even younger in
our audience.  What are these parents thinking?

Retelling the classic story of Joan of Arc has been a popular trend this
year. Earlier this May, Leelee Sobieski played the passionate title role
in the top-rated miniseries that debuted on CBS. And now, director Luc
Besson has delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage
girl supposedly sent by God to rescue France from the clutches of their
enemies. Starring Milla Jovovich, who is predominantly unconvincing as
the heavenly messenger accused of being a witch, `The Messenger: The
Story of Joan of Arc' is a disjointed and overblown historical
re-enactment that prevails merely as a bloated mistreatment of the
famous legend.
Besson (who's previous work includes the hyperactive sci-fi `The Fifth
Element') perhaps entrusted a bit too much faith in ex-wife Jovovich,
because in `The Messenger', the actress
is drowning in a pool of her own inexperience. At first, when reports
were indicating that Jovovich had been chosen for such a demanding role,
I was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry a film of
such a caliber. After seeing the rousing trailer, my
hesitant optimism suddenly skyrocketed - Milla Jovovich looked superb.
With the hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance, `The Messenger'
looked like a timeless epic in the making.
A timeless epic it is not. Besson is hesitant to abandon his unique and
flashy style, and the
story behind `The Messenger' is not entirely suited to his demands. On
the shoulders of
Besson's choppy and unexciting direction, the film dissipates into an
uninspiring
hodgepodge of poorly executed battle sequences and bizarre imagery.
There is no human exploration into the character of Joan (or Jeanne).
Jovovich merely rambles on about the
power of God when we have little or no insight into her visionary
objective. Jovivich's unsatisfying portrayal only helps lead to the
realization that Besson sees Jeanne as a piece
of spiritual cardboard. She is just another special effect in this
continuous visual feast.
Jovovich does have a few isolated moments of sheer power, but mainly,
she looks lost. Quite frankly, I don't know of any actress who could
successfully navigate her way through `The Messenger' without a major
fumble. The script is chock-full of laughable dialogue and unfortunate
comedy, as Jeanne confronts the uncrowned King Charles VII (John
Malkovich) and informs him of her heavenly intentions. Faye Dunaway
plays Charles' overbearing mother-in-law, and Dustin Hoffman appears
over two-hours into the story as a character dubbed The Conscience'.
All three actors juggle limited screen time, although Malkovich is
uncharacteristically awful.
The battle scenes are extremely bloody, but with the presence of such
jittery camera work, they capture none of the excitement or finesse of
something like `Braveheart'. There's a particularly graphic and
unsettling scene early on, when Jeanne (as a young girl) watches in
horror from a closet as her older sister is murdered and then savagely
raped by a bloodthirsty English soldier. Even his fellow troopers are
petrified.
`The Messenger' is also strictly a 90's update on the classic story.
Almost too 90's, it seems. There's gratuitous use of the f-word and a
barrage of slang terms like `she's nuts!' sprinkled throughout the
screenplay. I was half-expecting Jeanne to invite her homeys to come
chill in her crib, but it never happened. There's also the familiar
presence of bizarre Besson humor, but none of it comes even remotely
close to functioning properly. It seems terribly misplaced, but in a
catastrophe as jumbled and disjointed as `The Messenger', almost
everything does.
The musical score by Erric Serra is spectacular, and the set and
production designs are continuously impressive. If it was visual
excellence that Besson was striving for, then he achieves his goal. But
the only time the dramatics come alive in `The Messenger' is during the
closing trial, in which Jeanne is found guilty and burned at the stake.
During these moments, the historical relevance and dramatic purpose of
Joan of Arc reaches the audience, albeit in a faint stream of light that
provokes little power or meaning. It's just too delayed for Besson to
revive his lifeless interpretation, in which he is always concerned with
the wrong aspects.
`The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc' is an unlikely and unwelcome
historical addition to the Hollywood shelf. Anyone searching for an
entertaining epic is going to be painfully slapped with an overblown and
confusing film. Despite my original hopefulness, Milla Jovovich is not
going to have to worry about thanking the Academy.

The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc
The story of Joan of Arc is an often told one. Why? That was the question this
movie seemed to keep asking me. Why is this story such a popular one when it
deals with such heavy themes as Jesus, war, and death? During and after I
viewed The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc I got very depressed. The movie
was neither enjoyable nor good, even in the historical epic sense. I think it's
unfair that Columbia did not pass out doses of Prozac for free with each
rental. While this movie is forgettable in an instant, it would really help
someone heal emotionally from this awful film going experience.
Joan (Jovovich) is a peasant girl who has been very religious her entire life.
At a young age she begins to receive messages from whom she believes to be God.
Only later is his message clear. Convinced God wants her to save France from
England during the Hundred Years War, she proceeds to the capitol to ask
Charles the Dauphin (Malkovich) for an army. She tells him he will soon become
king of France. So Charles gives her an army that days later goes into battle
under her command. Soon after this battle, Charles does gets crowned king, and
doesn't need Joan anymore. She's later captured by the Burgundians who put her
to trial in England. Then a new character appears, The Conscience. Dustin
Hoffman is Joan's conscience who gets her convinced that her actions derive
from madness and not from God. If you paid any attention at all in history
class, you can guess how the movie ends.
I'm never a fan of really gritty films and this is certainly one of the them.
The violence is outrageously graphic and it's supposed to show the pain and
suffering of the armymen. The film succeeds brilliantly at this. The whole
movie is a violent, depressing, lifeless, and unoriginal lump. It is however
one that does a good job of not seeming that long. Modern war movies are
traditionally long and this is no exception. The time seemed to fly by until
the seventy minute mark when the film came to a grinding halt for me. Several
times I thought of turning it off, but I hanged onto the hope that it might get
a bit better. I was wrong. Laughably bad acting is present everywhere. Milla
Jovovich cannot act and is best suited to her smaller, more flashy, less line
role in Besson's great last film The Fifth Element. John Malkovich (Is he the
same actor who was so good as himself in Being John Malkovich?) is surprisingly
horrid, Faye Dunaway does nothing but show off medieval headpieces, and Dustin
Hoffman is unforgivable. While the text at the beginning of the film is way too
small to read on a television screen, if I could have read it, I wished it
would have said the following warning:
Save yourself! Save yourself! Jump off a building! Run your nails down a
blackboard! Hit yourself over the head with a frying pan! Do anything to get
away from this movie!

     With "The Messenger", Luc Besson fulfills the promise he showed in
"The Fifth Element".  That one was confused and pretty bad.  This one is
truly awful.
     Begin with little 8-year-old Joan (Jan Valentine), after her umpteenth
confession of the day, dancing through fields of flowers like a miniature
Julie Andrews on the road to Oz, flinging her arms wide and chortling "It's
wonderful!"  Throw in "Koyaanisqatsi"-esque churning clouds and weird
"Paul-is-dead"-ish backwards music on the soundtrack to show that the day
is taking an ominous turn, and then home to find the town pillaged by the
villainous English, and her sister raped and murdered (not in that order)
before her eyes.
     Then things really get bad.
     Enter Milla Jovovich (the "big bada-boom" girl from husband Besson's
"Fifth Element") as 19-year-old Joan.  She's learned to ride a horse and
wield a sword, and heard enough voices and made enough waves in her part of
France to convince the sniveling Dauphin (John Malkovich) to grant her an
audience, although we have no idea why except that his mother-in-law (Faye
Dunaway, so refreshed with her puffy lips and taut skin that she looks like
she's standing in a wind tunnel) puts him up to it.  Half of France,
including the part he needs for his coronation, is in the hands of the
barbarian English, and he'll try anything once.  
     If the Dauphin seems a bit genetically flawed, Joan is a full-bore nut
case.  She's so wild-eyed and hysterical you're afraid she'll have a stroke
before the English can burn her.   She finds the Dauphin in a cute game of
hide-and-seek and he gives her an army.  The generals take to her with
surprisingly little resistance, and soon they're all hacking and hewing
away at the English, and for most of the rest of the movie her face is
drenched in blood.  She's impervious to pain -- "How are you, Joan?" one of
her officers asks during a battle.  "Me?  I'm fine.  Why do you ask?" 
"There's an arrow in your leg."  "Oh."
     If only we were so impervious to pain.  By the time she's been
betrayed by the Dauphin and captured by the English, visited in her cell by
her Conscience in the form of a spectral Dustin Hoffman (sounding like his
previous assignment was in the Bronx), been through a few trials and more
betrayals, the two-hour mark is a distant memory, and you're feeling as
though you're at Zozobra*, waiting with diminishing patience for the main
event.
*Zozobra is an annual end-of-summer event at Fiesta in Santa Fe, NM, which
involves, after endless preliminary carryings-on, the burning of a giant
effigy of Old Man Gloom.

Sinner or Saint?  Heretic or Savior?  The history
surrounding Joan of Arc has been subject to plenty of
interpretation by scholars over the last 5 centuries. 
And, it was only 500 years after her death that the
Vatican finally canonized her.  Why might have it
taken so long?  I would suspect that their was much
discussion on both sides as to whether Joan indeed was
a messenger from God or just a poor peasant girl with
delusional visions, incredible amounts of courage, and
tremendous luck.  This movie doesn't advocate either
side, and that was one of the problems with `The
Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc,' a somewhat flat
depiction of one of history's most enigmatic icons.
Joan, pronounced `Junne' (played by Milla Jovovich),
has received hints throughout her young life that
portends to a future that no 19 year-old girl could
ever be prepared to handle.  These hints include
various visions and even a sword that she finds while
frolicking through the countryside.  Junne believes
that God is trying to give her a message.  She must
free France from her enemies (based on a historical
occurrence when England was supposed to annex France
through a treaty).  She visits Charles, dauphin of
France (John Malkovich), to tell him of her divine
role, and is given an army with which to cleanse the
French countryside of English troops.  Charles and his
advisors may be skeptical of her baseless claims,
which really has to be taken on faith, but any kind of
victory would garner him support among the masses as
he prepares to accept his crown.  Meanwhile, Junne,
who is only a messenger, has a strange effect on the
French army.  Their strength seems greater while their
morale increases, believing that God is on their side.
 Against all odds, they score unlikely but critical
victories in the war.  Junne is regarded a hero. 
Charles' popularity soars.  All of this takes place in
the first half of the movie, and for the most part, I
am more or less satisfied with how the movie has
unfolded. 
Director Luc Besson is true to form in bringing to
life a 15th century world when miracles in France were
sorely needed.  You may recall Besson's eye-popping
`Fifth Element', and here, his visualizations are
equally impressive.  Take note of the sheer pageantry
of Charles' coronation.  I was also impressed with the
medieval warfare, meticulously presented from the
inner workings of a catapult to the various defenses
(such as cauldrons of boiling oil) that the attacking
French must navigate.  The siege of an enemy tower is
the highlight of the film.  Melee is depicted
graphically with arrows piercing bodies and flails
crushing heads to a bloody pulp.
But the 150-minute movie wanes in the second act as
attention turns towards Junne's inner demons.  Now
King, Charles withdraws his support for Junne.  She is
eventually captured and tried for heresy.  While
awaiting trial, she is visited by another vision (who
looks like Dustin Hoffman).  He asks her to explain
her actions, which seem so contradictory to all of His
commandments.  Junne is naturally confused about her
current state, and the vision tries to help Junne
discover her own answers.
Besson is ambitious in his portrayal of Joan of Arc. 
Jovavich would have been more likeable if she wasn't
screaming at the top of her lungs throughout the film.
 Of course, it's hard to hear a 19-year old girl when
there are thousands fighting around you.  The film's
strength is in its visuals.  But dramatically, the
movie couldn't generate the power and seemed fearful
in committing one way or another to her cause. 
Perhaps God motivated her.  Perhaps vengeance did. 
Sinner or Saint?  Heretic or Savior?  Perhaps only God
will ever know.

STARRING:         Milla Jovovich, John Malkovich, Faye Dunaway, Dustin
Hoffman
WRITTEN BY:       Luc Besson, Andrew Birkin
RATED:            R for strong graphic battles, a rape, and some language.
SCRIPTURE
REFERENCES:       1 John 4:1, Ephesians 3:2-5, Proverbs 13:17
For a movie with such deep religious and spiritual undertones, it is
surprising to find THE MESSENGER: THE STORY OF JOAN OF ARC such an ungodly
mess.
In the early to mid 1400's, there was little in the way of spiritual
light to be found shining from the heart of a man or woman.  The church
was a dismally dark and oppressive place. France was involved in "The
Hundred Years War" against England.  There was no strong political
leadership in the country.  Morale was low, there being little hope for
the future.  It was within this setting that a young French girl began
hearing "voices" and seeing "visions."
Convinced that these were messages from God, she brazenly demanded to see
the dauphin in order to deliver the message directly to him.  The message:
If he would give her an army to command, she would deliver to him the
crown.  He does... And she does.  Then, once seated on the throne, he
abandons her to her English captors.
Director Luc Besson (THE FIFTH ELEMENT) may have co-wrote the script but
he never appeared to have a proper handle on the material.  The
inconsistencies of the cast, the confusing blur of the violent battle
scenes, the inappropriate musical score, and the lack of a vibrant life
force at the center of the film adds up to a largely disappointing end
product which is oftentimes unintentionally laughable.
His biggest miscue was to cast his wife, Milla Jovovich (THE FIFTH
ELEMENT) in the title role.  Ms. Jovovich, looks spectacular as Joan, clad
in battle armor, astride a similarly protected horse.  If looks were
enough to fully convey a character, she would have been brilliant.  Since
it isn't, she tried (and failed) to act the part.  Her Joan is unbalanced,
"inspiring" the troops merely by screaming stridently and waving her
banner or sword over her head like a woman possessed.
John Malkovich (BEING JOHN MALKOVICH) fares a bit better as the dauphin,
who Joan would see on the throne as Charles VII.  An easily manipulated
man, his weakness of character foreshadows the betrayal of Joan which
would lead to her death.
Faye Dunaway (THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR) gives a strong performance in
minimal screen time as the dauphin's mother-in-law and chief advisor.  The
army under Joan's command are comprised of comical figures, more stooges
than soldiers.  The one exception would be Tcheky Karyo (LA FEMME NIKITA)
as Dunois, the man who was leading the attack prior to Joan's arrival.
Trying to plan a systematic campaign, he sees his leadership authority
negated by Joan's insistence on following her "visions."
Dustin Hoffman (SPHERE) has a small inhuman role as Joan's conscience
which begins speaking to her while awaiting trial.  Dressed like cloaked
monk, he leads her to doubt herself and her "revelations."  As well she
should.
Scriptures do speak of revelation.  God, via His gift of holy spirit, is
able to communicate to men.  Three of the nine manifestations of holy
spirit listed in 1 Corinthians 12 deal with receiving revelation.  They
are:  word of knowledge, word of wisdom, and discerning of spirits.  Even
the scriptures themselves are a result of God giving revelation to His
"holy men... who spake as they were moved by holy spirit (i.e. by
revelation.)"
"Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are
of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world."  1 John
4:1 [KJV]
Joan's end, (being burned at the stake at the age of 19), the frenzy (mob
rule) and blood lust her inspiration wrought, and the death, pain, or
suffering which followed her campaign all point to a devilish influence
rather than a godly one.
While her conviction and intense believing remains an admirable quality,
she was, as others have been before and since, misled by the spiritual
master of deception.  As a messenger, she was quite effective.  She was
just confused as to whose message she was carrying.

 The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Ark (1999) 1/2 star out of 4. Starring
Milla Jovovich, John Malkovich, Faye Dunaway and Dustin Hoffman. Directed
by Luc Besson.
 "The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc" seems to run longer than the 100
Years War.
 At nearly two hours and 45 minutes, this intermitable misfire is
unfocused, idiotic and slow. Its biggest sin however is boredom.
 How anyone can make a dull movie about the life of Joan of Arc is beyond me.
 Yet director Luc Besson, who is guilty of co-authoring the screenplay with
Andrew Birkin, has transformed the very symbol of his native country from
one of inspiration to one of exasperation.
 As portrayed by the little-talented Milla Jovovich - who at the time
production commenced was married to Besson - Joan couldn't induce water to
boil let alone lead an army. Jovovich's Joan screams, shouts, rages and
bullies and tells continually tells everyone within earshot that she's not
making any decisions on her own, but merely passing on messages from God.
 Jovovich lacks any ethereal quality. She offers no hint of divine
inspiration.
 She's just an angry teen-ager with a big mouth who convinces people to
follow her because, she says, it's the will of God.
 This movie is a weak sister, one for which you will need the patience of a
saint to endure.
 And I despise period movies in which actors use modern idioms. When one
character said of Joan, "She's nuts," I just about walked out of the
theater.
 The battle scenes are fragmented, shot in that quick-cut style in which it
is difficult to tell who is doing what to whom. (A tip: The British troops
wear low, rounded helmets, the French helmets are more vertical and
pointed.)
 A superior supporting cast that includes John Malkovich as the sniveling
dauphin, Faye Dunaway as his conniving mother-in-law and Dustin Hoffman as
The Inquisitor, cannot breathe any life into this celluloid corpse.
 Timing is everything, and I sat through this movie two days after seeing
Carl Theodore Dreyer's 1928 restored classic, "The Passion of Joan of Arc."
Even with having to read translated subtitles, this movie emanated more
heart and soul in one 10-minute stretch than Besson's feature could muster
in all of its 160-plus minutes.
 If the historical Joan of Arc was anything like Jovovich's recreation than
it is a wonder the French are not speaking English and drinking tea today.
 The message of "The Messenger." Don't waste your time. After seeing this
movie, you may want to burn Besson at the stake.

MPAA: Rated R for strong graphic battles, a rape and some language.
Runtime: France:160
An energetic, visually stunning, but intellectually hollow recreation
of the mysterious life of Jeanne D'Arc.
In history Jeanne D'Arc is lost in an ocean of mystery and
controversy, which creates the perfect launching pad for talented and
creative directors, who can basically alter the story as they
wish. She came in a time where people desperately needed a saint. A
hero that could rescue them for misery and deliver peace and
happiness. Director/writer Luc Besson ('Nikita', 'Leon') portrays his
version of the peasant girl who commanded the armies of France and was
burned at the stake for witchcraft. Besson tries to recreate the
person behind the legend. He tries not to show her as a saint or a
villain. He shows her as a human being. In a time where blood was
almost pouring from the sky, and the air smelled of rotten flesh, it
is hard to keep your sanity. The only support and hope is in God. At
the age of 13, Jeanne (Milla Jovovich ) watches her own sister
murdered and raped by the English soldiers. This terrible event makes
a lasting impact on Jeanne's mind. God is no longer her support. He
has become her obsession. She starts seeing visions and signs that
command her to raise an army and free France from the siege of the
English tyranny. With the help of the wise Yolande D'Aragon (Faye
Dunaway ) and Charles VII (John Malcovich), whose grand royal
ambitions and life are at stake, Jeanne raises an army and marches
towards the English walls. After this the film stays mostly on the
battlefield, where Besson demonstrates his ability to direct amazing
action sequences, only occasionally resorting to a calmer tempo. The
movie is filled with dreamy, symbolic images of pure artistic
craftsmanship, that create a surreal and occasionally paranoiac
atmosphere. The film is lost in time and space, hysterically jumping
back and forth in Jeanne's thoughts, imagination and
conscience. Besson's visual style permits the audience to enter the
medieval age, feel the smell of fresh blood and the adrenaline pumping
in your body in the heat of battle.
But the film is far from being flawless. The script needs a lot of
polishing. Except for Jeanne, there are no real characters. And
although a grand star cast is assembled, their characters are nothing
more than props, not more alive than the costumes that they are
wearing. As for the Maiden of Lorraine herself, she is portrayed as a
simple girl, too small for her divine task. In the latter part of the
film, we see her as hysterical, confused and on the brink of madness,
with her past purity and innocence for ever lost. Jovovich handles the
part with more panache than one might expect. But though her screen
time is incredible excessive, both Malcovich ('Being John Malcovich')
and Dunaway ('Titus') surpass her rather overacted and simply
unprofessional performance. And even Hoffman manages to breathe some
life into his dreadfully small part. Besides casting Jovovich,
Besson's only mistake is his extreme sense of patriotism that in the
end ruins his so gloriously crafted painting. There are some viscously
evil Englishmen that murder, pillage and betray with a smile on their
faces. And some incredibly brave and noble Frenchmen, represented by
the "three musketeers" of this story -- the brave Gilles de Rais
(Vincent Cassel), the wise Aulon (Desmond Harrington) and the strong
La Hire (Richard Ridings). Though all those actor perform well, their
characters are nothing more than symbols -- banners that proclaim the
glory of France. And thus, there is no sense of realism in this
film. 'The Messenger' has muscles instead of brains. There is some
relief in the end, where Besson lays down his armor and starts
thinking. Dustin Hoffman's appearance helps and the film ends
elegantly and surprisingly effective with a climax worthy of
praise. Jeanne's character is unlocked, but whether God was in the
picture or not, is never quite explained. Was she a confused peasant
girl driven by her own hunger for revenge? Or was she truly a
messenger of God? The film poses as many questions as answers and
nothing is completely obvious. Bess o Messenger' is nothing more than
a fairly good film. It is not much that you remember of it after you
leave the theater. Maybe the sound, the dreamy sequences, but
certainly not the dialogue. It is an elegant and adrenaline pumping
history lesson for the MTV-generation, that although presents some
interesting material, works better when it's on the battlefield.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Luc Besson's (The Fifth Element) well-intentioned but severely uneven
story of the Maid of Orleans brazenly portrays its heroine as more of a
delusional schizophrenic teen than a saint.  But who's to say that she
wasn't really mental?  Maybe we're just used to seeing Joan portrayed as
a dignified, righteous woman that will do anything for her King and for
her God.  Crazy or not, The Messenger is still a major disappointment
from a director as accomplished as Besson.
The story takes place during the Hundred Years' War in fifteenth century
France, where the young Joan is an illiterate peasant girl that
occasionally hears the voice of God.  She constantly seeks the
confessional at her church with such ferocity she seems like an early
sufferer of obsessive-compulsive disorder.  On her way back from
confession one day, she finds a sword while rolling around in a field of
flowers and believes it to be a gift from the heavens.  Joan arrives
home to find English soldiers burning her village to the ground and
looks on in horror as a soldier kills and rapes (in that order) her
older sister.
Years later, seventeen-year-old Joan (Milla Jovovich, He Got Game) is
received by The Dauphin (John Malkovich, Being John Malkovich), the man
who would be King if the country weren't being controlled by the
English.  In one of the film's better scenes, Joan must find The Dauphin
in a room full of people despite not knowing what he looks like.  When
she passes this test, The Dauphin agrees to give Joan an army to fight
the English, who here are portrayed as obscene barbarians with bad
teeth.  Remember, Besson is a Frenchie.
While the graphic battle scenes are cool, you can't help thinking how
they pale in comparison to Braveheart, especially every time you see
blood splashed on the camera.  On her white horse, Joan's voice seems
too squeaky to command an army, yelling horribly clichéd lines to incite
her troops to battle.  Despite her foolish and hasty lack of war
tactics, Joan manages to win huge battles in both Orleans and Loire.
She even earns a victory in one battle just by telling the English to go
home.
About ninety minutes into the film, The Dauphin is crowned King Charles
VII and, having attained his lifelong goal, loses interest in Joan's
pursuit of a free France.  A little over one year later, Joan is
captured in Compiegne by the Burgundians and later sold to the English,
where they try her as a witch and a heretic in an attempt to discredit
Charles VII.  Joan's incarceration causes her to become delusional, even
dreaming up a big-nosed conscience (Dustin Hoffman, Wag the Dog) that
tells her, "You didn't see what was; you saw what you wanted to see."
This is when the film starts to get interesting, but it's way too late.
Say what you will about Jovovich's clumsy performance, she is pretty
believable as an insanely fervent girl.  An established actress would
have been too distracting, especially when crazy Joan hacks off her long
tresses to fit in with her male soldier counterparts.  The result is the
second Matt Damon-esque haircut on an actress this month (see Hilary
Swank in Boys Don't Cry for the other).  Even though Jovovich seems all
wrong, try thinking of a better actress that could pass for a teenager.
And LeeLee Sobieski doesn't count.
As The Dauphin/Charles VII, Malkovich once again shows that he has
become a parody of himself, while Faye Dunaway's (The Thomas Crown
Affair) performance as Yolande D'Aragon is devalued by a distracting
purple vein that runs down the middle of her forehead.  Besson's visual,
MTV-style direction certainly makes the earlier parts of the film more
watchable, but the usually reliable director (La Femme Nikita, The
Professional, The Fifth Element) falls flat here.  All of the really
stylistic images are given away in the trailer.  But give him credit for
trying to represent Saint Joan's religious visions as a figment of her
imagination.  Maybe those wacky Dogma protestors are picketing the wrong
film.
2:35 - R for extremely graphic violence, intense battle scenes, rape and
adult language.  Oh, and the whole burning at the stake thing, too.

THE MESSENGER: THE STORY OF JOAN OF ARC
Milla J., stick to the singing career.
Luc Besson, imaginative mind behind such notable works of art such as
The Professional, La Femme Nikita, and The Big Blue, has created such a
memorable mess of things with his newest release, The Messenger.  A car
crash of a movie headed straight for the Days of Heaven territory.
Joan of Arc, one of the most pinnacle figures of French history, has
been reduced to a crazy chick with a God complex unseen since Alec
Baldwin in Malice.  Luc, put down the Braveheart script and try to write
something interested and not convoluted like bad matinee popcorn that
sticks in a person's teeth. Also, the last thing I need in a movie is
Faye Dunaway doing her Mommie Dearest impression for the 56th time.
I wanted to understand the complexity of Joan of Arc's character - her
trepidation in confirming her personal beliefs, her fears of battle and
violence, her faith in God and country, her ability to stay so DAMN
ravishing during battle - I really do.  I DO!  But I just can't.  I just
didn't want to after the first fifteen minutes. Besson's inability of
winding together a cohesive plot structure and creating emotional
connection to the main characters is the main cause for the downfall of
the film.  When Joan is faced with the dilemmas of conviction and
execution of her leadership role, I am wondering what time I can get
home to watch the hockey highlights.
On the positive side, the cinematography is amazing, the set and costume
designs are impressive beyond words, and the battle scenes are notable
but unfocused.  One bright star in the cloudy sky is Tcheky Karyo, star
of La Femme Nikita and GoldenEye, who provides concrete battle ideals
that mesh together with Joan's abstract leadership ideals.  At least
Besson can rescue him from such films as Wing Commander.
Where are you Jean Reno, when we need you the most?

Luc Besson, possibly best known to American audiences for "The Fifth Element",
has an extraordinary visual imagination. While most audience members didn't
seem to care for the plot of his last film, it can hardly be denied that "The
Fifth Element" looked absolutely gorgeous. Here in "The Messenger" we get more
of these amazing visuals, but the story seems to be struggling to keep up.
Most know the story of Joan of Arc, but I will attempt a brief summary here.
Joan (Milla Jovovich) is a young French girl who witnessed horrors when her
village was destroyed by the invading English. Since then she has believed
herself a messenger of god, capable of freeing France from the English. The
interesting thing is, the people of France believe in her. In order to drive
the English out, she requires an army. She begs the dauphin, Charles VII (John
Malkovich) for one. At the head of this force, she begins an assult upon the
English held city of Rheims. Successful, the French drive the English out and
begin talks for peace. As Joan is unwilling to talk, Charles turns her over to
the English to stand trial.
This film can be divided easily into three parts. The first, and possibly
worst, involves Joan as a young girl discovering who she is (or believes she
is, depending on your point of view). During this, we are treated to grotesque
scenes such as her sister being murdered and then raped (note the order of
these events) by English troops. This third of the film is either quite dull or
disgusting at all times. It only begins to pick up the pace once John Malkovich
appears on screen. Even with a character as underwritten as that of King
Charles, Malkovich is a delight to watch.
The second segment of the movie is by far the most interesting, featuring
Joan's retaking of Rheims. It should be noted here, that Milla Jovovich turns
in a fine performance as a woman who appears insane at times and enlightened at
others.Perhaps what makes this portion of the film so interesting is the
presence of several supporting characters in Joan's army. In particular,
Richard Ridings (perhaps best known for a brief role in Highlander: The Series)
is hilarious as her oafish protector, La Hire. The battle sequences themselves
are intriguingly shot in a quick cutting fashion which conveys the chaos of the
battles, while still showing how the supporting characters fare.
The final sequence, while not nearly as interesting as the second is still
rather interesting, particularly due to the inclusion of Dustin Hoffman as
Joan's conscience. This segment focuses upon Charles's betrayl of Joan to the
English, and her trial at the hands of the English church. Joan's conscience
follows her about as she restlessly paces her cell, and makes everyone question
whether she truly is who she claims to be, or merely a lunatic. Some of these
scenes are truly hilarious, particularly one in which Hoffman offers possible
reasons for why Joan would find a sword lying in a field. Despite this, the
trial itself is quite dull, particularly since we all know how it is going to
end.
Perhaps the largest problem with this film, is the excessively lengthy runtime
of 140 minutes. The film simply runs out of steam after 100, and the first 45
or so seem utterly wasted. I can't quite recommend "The Messenger" in theatres,
but I would recommend you attempt to catch it on video if only for the amazing
visuals and the performances by Jovovich, Malkovich and Hoffman. I give "The
Messenger" three stars.

The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc (1999)

Rated R.
The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc is an intelligent film with
intelligent ideas. It has a more-than-workable script and a first-rate
cast. Its problems lie in its tone and execution. Director Luc Besson
(the n is silent), whose last film was the visually stunning The Fifth
Element doesn't quite realize this project's potential. His rampant use
of humor is often inappropriate and while it may generate a laugh, it
also serves to spoil the mood. There are limits to everything.
The two-and-a-half hour film stumbles out of the starting line, opening
with a map of Europe accompanied by a historical summary in the form of
titles which race across the screen at a jaw-droppingly fast pace,
leaving most of the audience in the dust (but worry not: if you want to
know some of the history behind the movie, simply read the next
paragraph; contrarily if you do not want to know what happens, skip the
next three). The film goes on to tell the still controversial story of
Joan of Arc, the teenager who led France to victory over England in the
13th century, claiming to be a messenger from God.
Around the turn of the (13th) century, France and England signed a
treaty providing that upon the death of France's ruler, France shall
become part of England's kingdom. The kings of both countries die
within months of each other, leaving France in the hands of the new
king of England, who is only a few months old at the time. France's
Dauphin (played here by John Malkovich) has no intention of giving up
his country to an infant and puts up a hell of a defense against the
formidable British military.
Enter Joan of Arc. This spunky 19 year-old believes that she is
receiving messages directly from the Big Kahuna himself. She thinks God
is telling her to lead the French army to victory against the British
to save the French Empire and make a king out of the Dauphin. The
Dauphin, eager to please the masses and ready to jump at any chance to
put a crown on his head, gives her the army. Joan takes control and
gets some stunning victories, one of which she obtains merely by
telling the British to "go home."
France is free and the Dauphin is king, but the story is far from over.
Her tales of messages from God rise suspicions of witchcraft on her
part, turning her saga into the best-known witchcraft trial ever sans
Salem. The last act of the film covers this in detail, and it is by far
the best The Messenger has to offer; the most powerful and compelling
part of the movie is its last.
Imagine, if you will, an intense battle scene. The sets are elaborate,
the action is frenetic, the music is blaring, the audience is really
into it. Everyone is excited. All of a sudden, a guy's head gets
chopped off and we see the headless body still standing upright, with
blood copiously spurting out of where the head was supposed to be. This
elicits groans and laughs from the audience. The mood is ruined, the
excitement is diffused. This is The Messenger's main ailment. Besson
ruins important scenes by playing them to comic effect. I have no
problem with dark humor in an epic film like this one but it has to be
done right and in places where it fits. What this film does is like
mixing oil and water; instead of blending seamlessly, the humor and the
action interfere with each other, making for an uneven confection.
The 24-year-old Milla Jovovich (The Fifth Element) plays the title
character with gusto but little grace which, I suppose, was the
intention. Jovovich is a relatively unknown actress and casting her was
a good idea; Joan is a controversial character and should not be
interfered with by an actress with an established personality. The
supporting cast is dynamite. John Malkovich provides some of the
appropriate comic relief in the movie as does Dustin Hoffman whose
character is significant and whose role I will not reveal for the sake
of preserving some of the film's non-historical surprises.
The Messenger is decidedly not a blockbuster. It has the gall not to
portray Joan as a hero, suggesting, more than anything else, that she
was indeed insane. This came as a pleasant surprise: here is a big-
budget movie that takes a big risk, straying from the crowd-pleasing
notion of heroism and woman-saves-the-world feminism. It works by
defying that expectation, by proposing a stand on an issue rather than
merely telling a version of the story.
In the midst of all this, Besson does not forget to thoroughly
modernize the tale, inserting generous amounts of '90s imagery and
employing a version of the ever-popular MTV filmmaking style, though
not settling into it as much as the stylistically similar Stigmata did
earlier this year. I can't well imagine The Messenger working without
all that imagery; it fits the story like a glove. As far as I'm
concerned, MTV itself is the spawn of Satan, but it sure does do
wonders for some films.
Most of what works in The Messenger is contained in its last 3rd and
what comes before it struck me as hastily put together. It's as if the
script wants to perfunctorily rush through the formalities and get to
the points it wants to make as painlessly as humanly possible. The
result is an extremely uneven first hour and a half. But the film's
terrific finale is enough, I think, to warrant a trip to the multiplex.

"The Messenger" is a great movie that doesn't know when to quit. So in an
effort to enhance your viewing pleasure allow me to deliver this message,
"Leave the theater when Joan is captured."
I know that's a bold thing to say about a bold film that is thick with
vitality and blood-curdling drama. Directed with great care from a rather
slow paced introduction to a catapulting climax; this "mini-epic" is
definitely a surging "A" grade at this point. But there's forty-five more
minutes of film that unravel from the reel like Joan's spirit from her
tortured ribcage.
But allow me to praise for a while. Forget Joan of Arc, I believe in Milla
Jovovich! I would follow her into battle! Her tremblingly honest portrayal
of God's own peasant woman divinely sent to unify the French armies against
the invading British of the 1400's will have you reaching for your mighty
daggers against your personal demons (no undue insult meant to our current
British neighbors). Milla is magnificent and the cinematography grand! (And
I don't usually get excited about costume period pieces.) One inspired woman
charms the allegiance of even hard core warrior leaders leaving them, as
well as us, dumbfounded.
Hungry, yet oddly hypnotized by Joan's faith, the French soldiers rush the
British fortress. Joan, twelve feet up the wall, takes an arrow to the upper
torso. Cut to British archer POV (point of view). We've just shot an arrow
into the legendary Joan of Arc, her mysteriously innocent (despite the chain
mail and steel sword) blue eyes peer deep into ours ... with shock, no ...
pity, pity for us. Then in slow motion she falls backward from the ladder
into the mass of French warriors who stop dodging gnashing hatchets in order
to catch her. It's the kind of silver screen moment that movie-goers live
for! I loved it!
That's why it's personally difficult not to ignore the imperfections that
mar this near masterpiece. The biggest of which is the aforementioned
needlessly lengthy resolution that serves only to deconstruct the film's
main character. Second, is the under use of John Malkovich as the king of
France who is so wonderfully overwhelmed by Joan's nervously potent proem.
Yet, his character too, is also deconstructed (this time without due
process) into a rather cold immature puppet. I may have been convinced, were
I given glimpses of his internal struggle with the question on everyone's
tongues, "Is this Joan really set ablaze by the voice of the one God, or is
she just a loon?" A tormented Malkovich at battle with himself cut
intermittently into Joan's grizzly battle scenes, would have served this
bold picture well.
Still, an extremely strong "B+" with performances, direction and cinema
moments that will burn themselves at the stake into your memory.

Itâs so tempting to make fun of this movie.  Luc Besson (âLa
Femme Nikita,â? âThe Fifth Elementâ?) insisted on casting his
girlfriend in the title role over the objections of the original
director, who was fired from the project.  Milla Jovovich
herself, model / pop singer / actress, seems like a classic case
of celebrity over-reaching. She is probably best known in the
U.S. for lisping her way through those Feria Hair Color
commercials on TV and for her role in âThe Fifth Element,â? a
Bruce Willis sci-fi spoof where she played an alien. (She kept
saying âMulti-passâ?; I think it was about her only line in
English in that movie.)  Milla is drop-dead gorgeous: she looks
like sheâs about six feet tall and weighs maybe seventy-five
pounds, so she must be as dumb as a post, and the idea of her
taking on a role as complex as that of the legendary, enigmatic
Jeanne DâArc has got to be some kind of joke.
Well, surprise of surprises.  I went to this movie to make fun of
it and ended up liking it. A lot.  It captivated me right from the
beginning and just kept getting better all the way through to the
end.  Besson presents a modern interpretation of Jeanne, a
Jeanne driven more by psychological damage than by religious
inspiration.  She has visions and hears voices all right, but
thatâs because sheâs clearly schizophrenic.  They begin when
sheâs a little girl.  The local priest is light-heartedly chiding
young Jeanne about her twice-daily visits to the confessional
when she tells him about her visions.  Sheâs both compulsive
and she has hallucinations, setting off alarm bells in a modern
audience.  
This medieval priest doesnât know what to make of her.
Heâs not alone; neither does the Dauphin Charles (Malkovich),
who would be King of France but for the occupying English
forces.  Exiled to the provincial backwater of Chinon, heâs a
man grasping at straws.  When Jeanne arrives claiming to be
on a mission from God to drive out the English and have him
crowned King, and she passes a little test he has devised for
her, he gives her an army to go relieve the besieged city of
Orleans.  He figures he has little enough to lose.
This is all very improbable.  If it werenât real history, it would
be downright unbelievable.
What this seventeen year old peasant girl accomplished is well
documented.  How she managed to do it is fertile ground for
speculation.  Countless historians and novelists have tried, and
there are nearly as many different Jeanne DâArcs as there are
writers about her. (Even Mark Twain had a go at it.)  Luc
Bessonâs Jeanne, schizophrenic and manic-depressive, is very
persuasive during her manic episodes, which are many.  Her
visions are utterly real to her and her manic energy is both
refreshing and inspiring to the Dauphinâs dispirited followers. 
Gallows humor prevails among the professional soldiers in
command of the hopeless defense of Orleans: they gave
themselves up for dead months ago.  Almost as soon as Jeanne
arrives, she begins screaming hysterically at them because they
wonât listen to her.  With a collective Gallic shrug, they
acquiesce.  They suspect sheâs kind of crazy, but as soldiers
they know that leading a frontal assault against heavily
defended enemy positions, being a little crazy is a good thing. 
Jeanne is ignorant of the methods of warfare, and her tactics
are unorthodox to the point of being comical. The English are
soon laughing out of the other side of their necks though.  Are
her successes just beginnerâs luck? On this point as well as
many others, this film is deliberately ambiguous. 
Jay Carr, film critic for The Boston Globe, stated flatly in his
review that Jovovich canât act.  Well, it sure looks like acting
to me.  The character walks a fine line between being very
peculiar indeed and being deranged, and she has to hold the
audienceâs sympathy while doing it.  In one key scene, Jeanne
is wounded by an arrow.  Itâs unclear whether itâs in her
shoulder or her chest (thereâs that ambiguity again.) Sheâs
carried off the battlefield and surrounded by the Dauphinâs
captains, who are terrified that sheâll die.  Impatient of the
arrival of a physician, she yanks the arrow out herself, like a
particularly stoical John Wayne.  But then she starts to cry,
because it hurts, and sheâs scared.  Jovovich jumps between
these different modes like a switch being flipped, making
Jeanne a fascinating, puzzling yet somehow coherent character. 
Standing  in a cold rain outside the city walls, shivering in a
splendid suit of armor while her attack on Paris fizzles around
her, sheâs noble and pathetic, absurd and absurdly courageous
all at once.   Maybe Jovovich would be lousy doing Jane
Austen, but sheâs perfect in this role, where sheâs bouncing off
walls, being three things at once.
Besson brings a thoroughly modern sensibility to his
interpretation of Jeanneâs story.  There is no attempt to make
the dialogue sound fifteenth-century, and the charactersâ
motives never seem quaint.  In terms of character, there are
even similarities between â The Messengerâ? and his âLa
Femme Nikita.â? Yet he sticks closely to the historical record. 
He uses visual symbolism to effectively blur the line between
reality and hallucination, without getting cute about it.  His
quick edits have the same effect, and have the added benefit of
keeping the narrative from becoming too seamless and
self-assured, something that would undercut the ambiguity.
(These quick edits that have been derided as âMTV-like,â? as if
montage was something invented by American television!) 
The battle scenes do for medieval warfare what âSaving
Private Ryanâ? did for the landing at Omaha Beach, and are
almost worthy of Akira Kurosawa.  Lastly, âThe Messengerâ?
isnât without humor; it even has some Pythonesque bits.
Donât let the negative reviews keep you from seeing this
movie.  It wonât be the same experience on video.

MPAA: Rated R for strong graphic battles, a rape and some language.
Runtime: France:160
An energetic, visually stunning, but intellectually hollow recreation
of the mysterious life of Jeanne D'Arc.
In history Jeanne D'Arc is lost in an ocean of mystery and
controversy, which creates the perfect launching pad for talented and
creative directors, who can basically alter the story as they
wish. She came in a time where people desperately needed a saint. A
hero that could rescue them for misery and deliver peace and
happiness. Director/writer Luc Besson ('Nikita', 'Leon') portrays his
version of the peasant girl who commanded the armies of France and was
burned at the stake for witchcraft. Besson tries to recreate the
person behind the legend. He tries not to show her as a saint or a
villain. He shows her as a human being. In a time where blood was
almost pouring from the sky, and the air smelled of rotten flesh, it
is hard to keep your sanity. The only support and hope is in God. At
the age of 13, Jeanne (Milla Jovovich ) watches her own sister
murdered and raped by the English soldiers. This terrible event makes
a lasting impact on Jeanne's mind. God is no longer her support. He
has become her obsession. She starts seeing visions and signs that
command her to raise an army and free France from the siege of the
English tyranny. With the help of the wise Yolande D'Aragon (Faye
Dunaway ) and Charles VII (John Malcovich), whose grand royal
ambitions and life are at stake, Jeanne raises an army and marches
towards the English walls. After this the film stays mostly on the
battlefield, where Besson demonstrates his ability to direct amazing
action sequences, only occasionally resorting to a calmer tempo. The
movie is filled with dreamy, symbolic images of pure artistic
craftsmanship, that create a surreal and occasionally paranoiac
atmosphere. The film is lost in time and space, hysterically jumping
back and forth in Jeanne's thoughts, imagination and
conscience. Besson's visual style permits the audience to enter the
medieval age, feel the smell of fresh blood and the adrenaline pumping
in your body in the heat of battle.
But the film is far from being flawless. The script needs a lot of
polishing. Except for Jeanne, there are no real characters. And
although a grand star cast is assembled, their characters are nothing
more than props, not more alive than the costumes that they are
wearing. As for the Maiden of Lorraine herself, she is portrayed as a
simple girl, too small for her divine task. In the latter part of the
film, we see her as hysterical, confused and on the brink of madness,
with her past purity and innocence for ever lost. Jovovich handles the
part with more panache than one might expect. But though her screen
time is incredible excessive, both Malcovich ('Being John Malcovich')
and Dunaway ('Titus') surpass her rather overacted and simply
unprofessional performance. And even Hoffman manages to breathe some
life into his dreadfully small part. Besides casting Jovovich,
Besson's only mistake is his extreme sense of patriotism that in the
end ruins his so gloriously crafted painting. There are some viscously
evil Englishmen that murder, pillage and betray with a smile on their
faces. And some incredibly brave and noble Frenchmen, represented by
the "three musketeers" of this story -- the brave Gilles de Rais
(Vincent Cassel), the wise Aulon (Desmond Harrington) and the strong
La Hire (Richard Ridings). Though all those actor perform well, their
characters are nothing more than symbols -- banners that proclaim the
glory of France. And thus, there is no sense of realism in this
film. 'The Messenger' has muscles instead of brains. There is some
relief in the end, where Besson lays down his armor and starts
thinking. Dustin Hoffman's appearance helps and the film ends
elegantly and surprisingly effective with a climax worthy of
praise. Jeanne's character is unlocked, but whether God was in the
picture or not, is never quite explained. Was she a confused peasant
girl driven by her own hunger for revenge? Or was she truly a
messenger of God? The film poses as many questions as answers and
nothing is completely obvious. Bess o Messenger' is nothing more than
a fairly good film. It is not much that you remember of it after you
leave the theater. Maybe the sound, the dreamy sequences, but
certainly not the dialogue. It is an elegant and adrenaline pumping
history lesson for the MTV-generation, that although presents some
interesting material, works better when it's on the battlefield.
