A few days before I saw "Fire" (in December 1997) I watched on TV's "60
Minutes" or one of its clones a report on certain women - generally happily
married  loving mothers- who, one day, discover that they are lesbians.
In the bigger picture are women who are not, but become lesbians by
necessity, to find affection and happiness long denied to them. This is
what "Fire" is all about. It  focuses  on Indian women and is the third
feature by writer-director Deepa Mehta. She was born in Amritsar (India),
graduated in philosophy from the University of New Delhi, and emigrated to
Canada in 1973.
"Fire"  looks at a New Delhi family that is middle-class by Indian
standards, dysfunctional by western standards but normal by many Indian
traditional standards, and in the process of changing, by any standards.
The aged mother, Biji, has been paralyzed and made mute by a stroke. Her
middle-aged son Ashok owns a video store and a fast food place that is at
street  level in a house where the living quarters are upstairs. Ashok's
younger brother, the westernized (in superficial ways and for the wrong
reasons) Jatin, helps in the store. He often sells porno videos to
schoolchildren. Ashok's wife Radha is played by a beautiful superstar of
Indian movies. Then there's Mundu, the servant who shares in the cooking,
cleaning and Biji-sitting.
A fourth member recently added to the family is the young,
drop-dead-gorgeous Sita, Jatin's bride. In the clever, subject-setting
opening scene at the Taj Mahal, we see that the marriage was arranged.
Jatin's senior brother had told him something like "At your age, one should
be married" and that was that. Conform to tradition at any human cost.
Jatin doesn't give a hoot for Sita. He loves his Chinese mistress Julie, an
entrepreneurial hairdresser who won't marry him.  Sita is in for a
miserable life.
She makes friends with Radha who is unhappy because she cannot have
children. The doctors' explanation was "No eggs," which sounds like a
grocery sign in World War II rationing. In Radha's male-dominated,
traditional society, infertility is bad news both socially and as a
deprivation of joy. Rhada's sadness is expressed in discreet ways.
Sita, who quickly learns of her husband's paramour, submits to deflowering
many days after her wedding. The scene, like the rest of the movie, is
discreet yet it feels like a rape. It's a matter of time until the lovely
and simpatico sisters-in-law kiss, then  progress (with utter film tact) to
a stronger relationship. (The movie is big on the eroticism of foot
massages).
The "affair" comes at no surprise. Both women are widows, not mere
sports-widows as in North America, but love-widows. They do not "come out"
but are brought together the way some affection-seeking, lonely boys and
girls do in same-gender schools.
Radha has the additional misery of a husband who is thoughtful and decent,
but who is a kind of mystic, and the prize pupil of a swami who may or may
not be a phony.  I couldn't help singing to myself "Swami, how I love you,
how I love you, my dear old Swami." Ashok wants to reach a certain
spiritual level by submitting to temptations and resisting them. To resist
the lure of sex, he periodically calls his wife to his bed -and does
nothing. They have not had sex for 13 years, which may be fine for him but
not for Radha.
Ashok may be a good man, but when Radha starts flying with her own wings
and he tells her the habitual "Come to the bedroom. I have to test myself,"
the shocking reply is "not tonight." Later he states that "Desire gives
pain" and she counters "Without desire, life is not worth living."  The
sisters-in-law agree that men want to get pleasure but don't think of
giving it. It's the new India's voice.
When Jatin learns of the two women's relationship, he goes into a smug
forgive-and-forget speech, adds "but I won't stop seeing Julie," and
launches into praises of Julie's looks.  He tells Sita that she has two
choices: divorce him and suffer the inevitable troubles of divorcees, or
have a child. "What do you think?"
"I think you are a pompous fool." Jati is turned on by this new
independence of his "firecracker" wife.
The developments of the movie are connected rather heavily to symbolic
flashbacks to Sita's childhood ; to a day of fast by wives, so that their
husbands might live long (ironically, both women comply); to also ironical
interludes, one a dream that seems to mock standard Indian films, the other
a play of Lord/God Rama and his wife Sita's trial by fire, to show her
purity. Concludes Rama:" You are pure --but I still have to send you in
exile."
Small episodes, some subtle, others not, contribute to making this film a
feminist manifesto. At the premiere in the International Film Festival of
India, a man told the filmmaker "I'm going to shoot you, madam." The movie
shocked many middle-aged males, yet according to Ms. Mehta, the "scandal"
was not lesbianism but the feared independence of women. She adds that
overall, women, young men and old men were enthusiastic about "Fire."
There is even brutally direct criticism of other aspects of India, by a
Chinese immigrant who, during a meal with Jatin in a fancy restaurant,
deplores having chosen India instead of Canada or Australia.
The film has an excellent score but some problems with its photography.
Though much praised in some quarters, the camerawork suffers from what may
be excessive purism. Probably bent on imparting a realistic look to a
suffocating environment, it went to the extremes of avoiding reflectors and
extra lights, with the result that some scenes are unnecessarily dark or
murky.
This serious movie is dotted with comic relief, notably by the servant
Mundu. Watching porno videos, he delivers a hilarious onanistic scene. He
answers a  milkman who told him "You look weak these days," with "Perhaps
because you keep watering down your milk." But it is also the same Mundu
who, dismissed for obscene behavior but terribly anxious to retain his job
(no mean problem in India), spills the beans to his boss. This catalyzes
the film's wrap-up with a too neatly symbolic twist and unclear
non-closure.
The rhythm could have used more vigor, not to satisfy our western love of
speed, but to save time for more development of characters, even though the
statements of the movie about the old and the evolving India come through
very clearly.
The language spoken is "Hinglish" -- that colorful English adapted to India
and to local colloquialisms -- simply because it is the main language
spoken by people of a status and background similar to the movie's
personae.

     On one hand are duties, obligations, and traditions.  On the other 
are needs, desires, and freedom.  Wars between these two antagonistic 
camps have been fought through the ages across many societies.  The 
battleground in Deepa Mehta's FIRE is modern-day New Delhi, where the 
role of the woman in being re-defined.  No longer do wives submit 
without question to the whims of their husbands, and this shift is 
causing tremors throughout the entire Indian culture.  FIRE shows the 
causes and effects of one such tiny reverberation.
     Sita (Nandita Das) is a romantic, and that is her undoing.  When 
marrying the handsome Jalin (Jaaved Jaaferi), she envisions a bright 
future, but instead finds a barren wasteland.  Her new husband has no 
interest in her.  His desire is for his Chinese mistress; his marriage 
to Sita serves one purpose:  to placate his family, who want him to have 
children.  Sita is not the only lonely woman in the household, however.  
Her sister-in-law, Radha (Shabana Azmi), is married to Jalin's older 
brother, Ashok (Kulbushan Kharbanda) Â– a man whose religious fanaticism 
has caused him to take a vow of celibacy.  Duty, not love, is what he 
demands from his wife.  In this environment, it is only natural that 
Sita and Radha become fast friends, and, in time, much more than that.  
But their love is not without its share of painful obstacles.  As Sita 
states, "In our language, no word exists for what we are to each other." 
     FIRE is less a story of lesbian love than it is a statement of 
female emancipation.  This is the tale of two vital, beautiful women 
breaking their cultural obstacles and being reborn through the passion 
they express for each other.  Their relationship is forbidden, but it by 
giving into their feelings that they find the strength to defy their 
husbands and turn their backs on tradition.
     Nevertheless, the film would not be as successful if the romance 
didn't work on an emotional level.  Mehta has created a pair of 
memorable characters who are easy to empathize with, and who 
gratifyingly are never transformed from flesh-and-blood individuals into 
mere symbols.  It also helps that the roles are acted with feeling and 
ability.  Both of the female leads, Shabana Azmi and Nandita Das, are 
capable performers who develop a genuine rapport with each other.  
Kulbushan Kharbanda is excellent at playing a pompous icon of self-
righteousness and Jaaved Jaaferi is equally detestable as the 
philandering newlywed.
     In addition to being emotionally and intellectually satisfying, 
FIRE is a treat for the eyes.  Mehta and cinematographer Giles Nuttgens 
have crafted a beautiful-looking film, rich with bright colors and 
silhouetted eroticism.  The sex scenes are photographed discreetly (only 
one breast is briefly glimpsed) with an eye for sensuality.  Mehta's 
approach to this aspect of the movie is indicative of the care and 
effort that she has invested in the entire production.

     Newlywed Sita has her dreams, and, modest though they may be, she
doesn't seem likely to fulfill them.  Trapped in a loveless, arranged
marriage in which her husband keeps only his mistress's picture in his
wallet, she sees little hope for happiness.
     Sita tells her new sister-in-law Radha of her wish of someday
seeing the ocean.  Radha, stuck in a 13-year-old marriage with her
husband who took a vow of celibacy when she proved infertile, tells
Sita wistfully, "I wanted to see the ocean once, but..."  And her voice
trails off into a dream-like state until she interrupts herself to
discuss more mundane subjects.
     FIRE, director Deepa Mehta's film of Indian middle-class passions
and constraints, stars the lovely actresses Nandita Das as Sita and
Shabana Azmi as Radha.  Their simplistic tale of woe will elicit your
compassion, but the thin story wanes by the second half, leaving little
to remember except for A.R. Rehman's mystical Indian music and Aradhana
Seth's magical, urban sets of neon-lit storefronts.
     Sita's husband Jatin, played debonairly but coldly by Jaaved
Jaaffery, wishes the arranged marriage had never happened.  He has a
Chinese mistress with whom he spends most of his evenings and his
money.
     Sita and Jatin live with Jatin's brother Ashok (Kulbhushan
Kharbanda), his wife Radha, and their aged mother Biji (Kushal Rekhi),
who after a major stroke does "no talking but much listening."  In the
most shocking scene in the film, their servant Mundu (Ranjit Chowdhry)
has solo sex within a few yards of Biji, treating her like a piece of
furniture.  Actually, all of the men in the story ignore the women
unless they want something like their next meal.  And while Sita fasts
in a religious ceremony to give her husband long life, her husband
wiles away the evening eating delicacies at an expensive restaurant
with his mistress.
     Eventually, the women turn to each other's arms as their only hope
of solace.  ("There is no word in our language to describe what we are
and what we feel for each other," Radha tells Sita.)  Their lesbian
affair is filmed by cinematographer Giles Nuttgens in a beautiful haze.
In contrast, the film's heterosexual liaisons are made to look harsh
and brutal, which in this story they are.
     Although the acting is pleasant enough, the script by the director
suffers from a paucity of ideas.  His characters are handsomely
outlined but never adequately filled in.
     After a strange ending with an ambiguous and confusing message,
the ending credits roll.  The lasting impression of the film is not of
people but of images.
     FIRE runs 1:41.  It is in English and is not rated but would be R
for sex, brief nudity, and mature themes.  It would be acceptable for
teenagers only if they are older and mature.  Although it is a handsome
film, there is not enough compelling content for me to be to be able to
recommend it.  I give it **.
