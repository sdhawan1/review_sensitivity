The Bone Collector: calcium deficient
It used to be enough just to have a serial killer on-screen, but then all
the movies had a serial killer, meaning that if a movie wanted to
distinguish itself, its serial killer had to be unique. And uniqueness
translates easily into eccentric. Norman Bates wearing-your-mother's-dress
type stuff. Or, later, Buffalo Bill, making his dress from human skin,
preening in front of the mirror, etc. But then that too got old, ubiquitous,
overdone. Meaning that that eccentricity by which a movie distinguishes
itself had to be displaced elsewhere, spread around some; the detective had
to become the eccentric one, now. And there are endless variations on this,
the most popular perhaps being the Eyes of Laura Mars approach, where the
killer has some vaguely telepathic access to the killings, which turn out to
be mundane. Another variation is the one used in The Bone Collector, where
the burden of eccentricity (the movie's 'draw') is again placed on the
detective, but that eccentricity is physical this time: Lincoln Rhymes
(Denzel Washington, Fallen) is quadriplegic, which is to say not what we
expect a homicide detective to be.
Not that the perp in The Bone Collector is run of the mill, either, though.
Hardly. He's (yes, spoiler, 'he') more akin to the game-players of Copycat
or Se7en, which is to say The Bone Collector continues the tradition of
partially inverting the cat-and-mouse dynamic, via making the killer both
the prey and the one doing the toying. Or, conversely, the killer toys with
his victims and is turn toyed with by the detective. Either way, it
satisfies the need we have in drama to dress the familiar up so it's
difficult to recognize. What's particularly nice about The Bone Collector,
though, is what Lincoln Rhyme's quadriplegia brings to the table: shades of
Cyrano de Bergerac. At times it's practically Roxanne, with Officer Donaghy
(Angelina Jolie) in the field, Rhyme's willing puppet, 'seducing' the killer
out for him.
Too, however, The Bone Collector also has what's practically a requirement
for every cop show: the buddy dynamic. All the predictable little
hostilities and age/culture/race/ethnicity differences etc which are
evidently a necessary ingredient for successful crime-fighting. Even here,
though, The Bone Collector alters things just slightly, by making the
reluctant partner not the older one--Rhymes, whose looming euthanasia plans
are very similar to a certain Sergeant Murtough's similarly imminent
retirement plans--but the younger one, Officer Donaghy. The older officer is
actually the eager one here, which we haven't seen before, even when the
dynamic is used in another genre. Think Unforgiven, the eager young (non-)
killer and the aging, reluctant one.
As for the rest of The Bone Collector, it's conventional, with all the
profiling and forensic insight and gore the genre demands. Se7en type stuff,
without all the Fincher coloring and Fincher sounds and Fincher magic. As
far as genre goes, it even has Michael Rooker (Henry, the original serial
killer) hopping in and out of things, offering all the mandatory
interdepartmental resistance any good detective needs as motivation. And
don't forget Ed O'Niell, in the detective role he's been honing for some
time now (Ford Fairlane, Disorganized Crime, Spanish Prisoner), to good
effect.
Up to this point, The Bone Collector's been an excellent movie. But then. As
has to happen, the serial killer turns his attention to his pursuers, the
detectives, a shift in gaze which The Bone Collector as a movie imitates,
similarly taking its eyes from the prize. Which is to say it loses it. It is
conventional in the way it loses it, at least: the same way Laura Mars does,
by having the perp be mundane (-ly motivated). It doesn't help that we could
identify him so early on, either. In spite of all this, though, The Bone
Collector--in the last few frames--still has the chance of pulling the whole
thing off, but then it takes the easy way out, doesn't tie the narrative
together in the way, say, Se7en does, but instead goes for the Hollywood
ending. Which yes, in this case (quadriplegia, euthanasia . . .) is
definitely the socially responsible way out, but still. Do we really want a
serial killer movie to be safe? Not really. If The Bone Collector would have
just followed through, it could have passed itself off as a serious movie.
As is, though, it's just typical fare.

Susan Granger's review of "THE BONE COLLECTOR" (Universal Pictures)
This is yet another urban thriller about a sadistic serial
killer. Denzel Washington plays a bedridden, suicidal, quadriplegic
forensics expert and best-selling author who teams up with a former
fashion model-turned-rookie cop, Angelina Jolie, to capture an
imaginative murderer with a penchant for cryptic clues. And each
killing is uniquely horrific, just like in "Seven." Inexplicably, the
NYPD uses Washington's SoHo loft as a base of operations while Jolie
acts as his eyes and ears, exploring the grisly crime scenes,
describing them to him, and following his instructions
precisely. "You've got to saw her hands off at the wrist line! I've
got to have those cuffs for prints!" he barks into her cell phone from
his motorized bed. As his devoted nurse, Queen Latifah imbues the role
with a special sassy quality, while the stereotypical supporting
characters include Ed O'Neill, Mike McGlone, Luis Guzman, and Michael
Rooker as Washington's former boss. Utilizing Jeremy Iacone's
cliche-ridden, uneven screenplay, adapted from the novel by Jeffrey
Deaver, director Philip Noyce ("Clear and Present Danger," "Patriot
Games") cleverly keeps the cinematic tension taut as the hapless
victims are buried alive, scalded by steam or devoured by rats. But
the final confrontation between the immobilized Washington - using
"one finger, two shoulders, and a head" - and the deranged killer is
utterly preposterous. Angelina Jolie is woefully unconvincing,
particularly when she's crying, and her pouting lips have been so
puffed up with some kind of silicone concoction that they look
ludicrous.  On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The Bone
Collector" is a dopey, diabolical 6. It's basically a grisly, gruesome
whodunnit.

DIRECTED BY: Phillip Noyce
WRITTEN BY: Jeremy Iacone, based on the book by Jeffery Deaver
CAST: Denzel Washington, Angelina Joilie, Queen Latifah, Ed O'Neill
MPAA: Rated R for strong violent content including grisly images, and for language.
Runtime: USA:118
After David Fincher's "Se7en" (1997), there have been several attempts to create a film similar in story and impact, but without any success. "Fallen" (1998), "Resurrection" (1998) and "Kiss the Girls" (1998) are some.  The latest is 'The Bone Collector' (1999!), which is like most of its predecessors a failure. The directors of these films have all tried to copy every aspect of Fincher's work: a dark detective story, lots of violence, a gritty atmosphere and impressive cast. But though they all shot during night, had the most inventive murderers and murders (that successfully got them the necessary R-rating) they were unable to produce the most important, that what you can not copy -- talent. 
The plot is a collection of stereotypes beginning with the brilliant policeman, philosopher and writer Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) who, under the investigation broke his spine and lies now at home, where he is taken care of the good nurse (Queen Latifah) and friend (Gary Swanson ). He and the rest of the inhabitants of New York city are oblivious of the psycho-killer that realms the streets, picking up his victims in a cab and murdering them using the most ancient methods. One of these innocent victim's body is found by Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Joilie), who has handled the episode with such professionalism that it catches Rhyme's attention. The police, led by 'Bundy''s Ed O'Neill (I) is helpless and it is up to Rhyme and his young apprentice to catch the killer.. 
The story is filled with mysterious leads, bizarre puzzles and devastating events, but who cares? It just isn't interesting. It doesn't have any drive to it. There is nothing that this movie can boast of. It approaches familiar themes and enters explored territories, but it doesn't have neither the intensity and dark philosophy of "Se7en" or the sophistication of "Silence of the Lambs". I think it's time for the directors to realize that there has to be a point, at least some intelligence in the story, besides the murders, chases and darkness. Apparently that element was forgotten. None of the performances are worthy of notice, the cinematography is a poor copy of Darius Khondji    (Seven), the editing is average, the music a cliche. In fact the whole film feels like a clone, an unsuccessful mutation of all the psycho-thrillers that we've seen before. Joilie and Washington are unable to look as a potential couple, unable to generate tension, yet alone drive the story forward. !
The other actors act as they are just waiting for their paychecks. The sets are dark, but unreal. And the whole film looks staged, pointless and even phony at times. Even the awaited ending is a disappointment. This is the classic example of an artistic failure, but it certainly doesn't mean that it's completely unwatchable. It is a film for a rainy day and two free hours when you do not know what to do. And then you just may insert this cassette into your VCR, press PLAY and let Washington and Joilie guide you on a pointless, but occasionally enjoyable ride through the dark streets of New York.

THE BONE COLLECTOR (M).  
(Universal/Columbia Tristar)
Director: Phillip Noyce
Stars: Denzel Washington, Angelina Jolie, Ed O'Neill, Queen Latifah, Mike 
McGlone, Michael Rooker, 
Luiz Guzman, Leland Orser, John Benjamin Hickey, Bobby Cannavale
Running time: 118 minutes.
There is something inherently fascinating about serial killers
and exploring the pathology behind these psychopaths that continues to
intrigue writers and film makers, and, ultimately, audiences.  Seven
and Silence Of The Lambs are probably the pinnacle of this genre.
Based on the novel by Jeffrey Deaver, a best selling author who
specialises in thrillers about psychotic killers and forensic
evidence, The Bone Collector is a solid and generally well made
thriller that follows in their footsteps.
Although not quite in the same league, The Bone Collector
still crams in enough creepy moments and shocks to satisfy fans of
this sort of stuff.  If nothing else, it may scare you away from
catching a taxi late at night!  However, the film is ultimately let
down by a rather disappointing conclusion.
The opening credit sequence immediately recalls Seven, while
it also effectively establishes the back-story in much the same
fashion employed by Aussie director Jon Hewitt in the recent Redball.
With a deliberate nod in the direction of Rear Window, the
film introduces us to an unusual hero in Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel
Washington), a once brilliant forensic investigator left a bed-ridden
quadriplegic.  Much of the novel dealt with Rhyme's depressed nature
and his suicidal tendencies, but the film version moves away from this
psychologically darker territory.  Although physically infirm, Rhyme
is asked by a former colleague (Ed O'Neill) to put his skills to use
in tracking down a vicious new serial killer.  This mysterious killer
prowls New York in a taxi cab, executes his victims in rather gruesome
fashion, and leaves the scene littered with clues that point towards
his next crime.
A crucial element of Rhyme's investigative team is Amelia
Donaghy (Angelina Jolie, recently seen in Pushing Tin, etc), a rookie
cop who demonstrates a flair for forensic science.  She becomes his
eyes, ears and legs, gathering evidence which he interprets with the
help of some state of the art equipment in his apartment.  This
unusual pair race against time to uncover the identity of the killer
as the body count and the tension slowly mounts.
Ex-patriate director Phillip Noyce makes great mainstream
Hollywood action films (Clear And Present Danger, Patriot Games, etc),
and he handles this formulaic thriller competently enough.  In true
Hitchcock fashion, he throws in a few clever, but contrived, red
herrings and some artful pieces of misdirection, particularly as the
film nears its climax.  Like David Fincher in Seven, Noyce
deliberately downplays some of the more graphic moments.  But he shows
us just enough of the sadistic killer's handiwork to let our
imaginations switch to overdrive, which adds to the gritty suspense.
Much of the film takes place in claustrophobic settings, dirty
subterranean tunnels and long abandoned, decrepit buildings, and Dean
Semler's suitably dark and gloomy perfectly matches the mood of this
chilling thriller.
The role of Rhyme is seemingly tailor made for former Superman
star Christopher Reeve, but that is a piece of (type?)casting that is
too obvious, even for Hollywood.  To his credit, Noyce has gone for
something less predictable.  Washington brings plenty of dignity and
charisma to a role that is physically challenging because of its very
nature.  Jolie (actor Jon Voight's daughter) has an intelligent, sexy,
engaging and appealing screen presence, and her performance here
confirms her status as a star of the future.  The gradually developing
relationship between the pair brings an understated air of sexual
tension to proceedings, and the rapport that develops between the pair
cries out for a sequel.

The Montreal Film Festival is where I happened to catch the premiere of this
film last night. I got kinda lucky because producer Martin Bregman, director
Phillip Noyce, and the main man himself, Denzel Washington sat in the crowd
alongside the rest of us. I got even luckier when it turned out that the
film was not just another rehashed serial killer thriller, but a rather
effective moody/creepy murder mystery, starring a couple of New York City
forensics experts.
PLOT:
An expert in the field of crime scene forensics suddenly becomes a
paraplegic after a horrible on-the-job accident. Four years later, a serial
killer is on the loose, and our top cop suddenly develops a high interest in
the mysterious case. Seeing that he cannot go to the crime scenes himself,
he recruits the help of a young forensics hopeful, enter Angelina Jolie.
Together, they attempt to piece together all of the clues in the puzzle,
which once resolved, will nab them a killer.
CRITIQUE:
Fantastic style, this film spices itself up with some great shots, unique
points-of-view angles, an effective chilling mood, and some excellent
performances put forth by Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie. I must admit
that ever since the plethora of "serial killer" films that came flying out
after the great success of SEVEN (9/10), I have become harsher and harsher
in respect to my criticism of these movies. This film passed my test with
flying colors, because it managed to pull me into its game of thrills, with
an interesting mystery, some pretty gruesome murder scenes, an engaging
score and a nice build-up. Originality in the film's actual premise might
not be its strong suit (A serial killer is on the loose...leaving plenty of
cryptic clues...let's find him!), but the chemistry between Jolie and
Washington make this film much more interesting and captivating to watch.
I also enjoyed a couple of the sidebar performances by Queen Latifah (Don't
laugh, she's pretty good in it) and Ed O'Neill (Al Bundy to some of you), in
particular. I could have done without Michael Rooker playing the badass cop
role. Michael should really start looking into stretching his talent across
some characters which aren't bordering on the psychotic. Another thing that
I didn't fully appreciate about this film, was the fact that the killer
would purposely leave clues at each of the crime scenes. This function was
to allow his pursuants a better "chance" of identifying the person, but only
if they pieced together a bunch of far-fetched parts of a grand puzzle,
which in my opinion, seemed a little extravagant. Having said that, this
minor detriment to my enjoyment of the story didn't really seem to bother me
as much as I thought it would. And for that, I praise the director's unique
vision, the actors' wonderful performances, and the film's creepy feel,
which in combination allowed for an entertaining film to unfold. And despite
the obvious commonality to Hitchcock's REAR WINDOW (Both protagonists are
incapacitated during the entire film), I did find myself feeling like I was
watching a 90s version of a Hitchcock movie at times.
If you love murder mysteries, you will most likely love this movie,
especially if you don't mind gory crime scenes, gruesome details about
horrendous murders, and loved SEVEN and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. And watch for
this one very cool camera shot which begins on the downtown streets of New
York, and pulls back real quick and up and into the room where Denzel spends
all of his time in this film. Very slick!
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Did you know that Denzel Washington played Dr. Chandler on NBC's TV medical
series "St-Elsewhere" for about six years beginning in 1982?? I sure didn't!
He has four children with his wife of close to twenty years, Pauletta. He
has also learned to develop a much tighter private life, after he uttered a
few regrettable words during a 1993 TV interview with Barbara Walters,
"Being a star and all of that, temptation is all around, it's all around,
you know, and I haven't been perfect. I'll be quite candid about it."
Angelina Jolie's full name is Angelina Jolie Voight. She is the daughter of
famed actor Jon Voight. "Jolie" means "pretty" in French. Angelina has also
appeared in several music videos, including such artists as Meatloaf, Lenny
Kravitz, Antonello Venditti and The Lemonheads
Queen Latifah's real name is Dana Owens. She was born in Newark, New Jersey,
and also has a musical career as a rapper. Her older brother Lance Owens,
who was a police officer, died in an accident on the motorcycle that Queen
Latifah had bought for him as a present. She still wears the motorcycle key
around her neck.
Actor Michael Rooker studied the Japanese martial art of Akido before ever
establishing himself in Chicago theatre.
Director Phillip Noyce makes a small cameo appearance in this film. Watch
for him standing inside the library when Angelina Jolie's character makes
her trip there. He is standing upright and reading a book. Tall drink of
water, he is. He is originally from Australia.
And if you didn't think this film reminded you of SEVEN enough, director
Noyce has also brought a member of that cast along for this ride as well.
Actor Leland Orser, who plays the "crazed man in the massage parlour" in the
earlier film, returns as a good buddy of Denzel's in this film.
Actor Ed O'Neill is best known for his years of service as the idiot father
in the popular FOX sitcom, "Married with Children". What less people know
about him is that he once tried out, but was cut by the NFL's Pittsburgh
Steelers. He also made his uncredited feature film debut in the 1972
classic, DELIVERANCE, starring Angelina Jolie's dad, Jon Voight. Ed played
the "highway patrolman".
Producer Martin Bregman has produced five of Al Pacino's movies including
SERPICO, DOG DAY AFTERNOON, SCARFACE, SEA OF LOVE and CARLITO'S WAY.
The original music in this film comes from two sources: Craig Armstrong, who
has composed music for a few other films, and Mitsou, a Quebec-based pop
singer, who receives her first movie composing credit with this film.
This film is based on the novel by the same title, written by Jeffrey
Deaver.
This film was shot in both Montreal, Canada and New York, New York.

     Call me crazy, but I'm dead certain I saw the Transamerica Pyramid
(in San Francisco) in the opening scene of THE BONE COLLECTOR, which is
otherwise set in New York.  In fact, this film, about a cab driver who
kidnaps and murders his victims, might have been better suited to a S.F.
setting, where a cab driver recently kidnapped and murdered his victim.
     THE BONE COLLECTOR presents us with the strange case of Lincoln
Rhyme (Washington) a crack NYPD forensics officer and prolific crime
author.  Enter young protégé Amelia (Jolie), when Rhyme is busted, er,
paralyzed on the job.  Immobilized in his apartment, rookie Amelia is
sent out to be Lincoln's eyes and ears when our murderous cabbie goes on
a killing spree, carefully leaving clues for the cops.
     So is THE BONE COLLECTOR something we'd really call art?  As a
moody and visceral experience, it isn't bad.  Mind you, I'm not going to
have any nightmares tonight, but COLLECTOR has its moments.  Not that
I'm giving those points for originality: A hodgepodge of THE SILENCE OF
THE LAMBS and COPYCAT, THE BONE COLLECTOR is as derivative as they come.
     What about the spook factor?  As a thriller, THE BONE COLLECTOR
rarely rises above a moderate level of anxiety.  A few tense scenes are
driven by sudden audio tricks and spooky music, but rarely is it driven
by the plot, and rarer still does anything come of all the hubbub.
     Figuring out whodunit is an exercise in futility, too.  I was sure
the trailer gave it away, but no: A ridiculous and unforgivable climax
is tacked on to the picture.  Plus there's the obligatory denouement and
awkward attraction scenes (which are particularly bizarre given that
Rhyme is paralyzed from the neck down).
     Ultimately, THE BONE COLLECTOR is not a bad film, and it's better
than some of the tepid thrillers like DOUBLE JEOPARDY we've seen this
year.  Crime story fans will enjoy the picture.  And those who don't
like crime stories will be fascinated the entire two hours just by
staring at Angelina Jolie's enormous, oversized lips.

I must make a confession right off the bat: this review will be partially
tainted by my bias against thrillers. I don't know what I was thinking
when I decided to review this movie; as strong a Short Black Chick as I
am, I have an extremely weak stomach--and "The Bone Collector" sorely
tested me. Sad to say, I failed the test; not only did I get physically
ill, I cried at the end--and not because this flick was a tear-jerker (it
wasn't, by any stretch of the imagination). All this to say, you must take
my rating with the grain of salt that this most def wasn't a Bammer Flick
to begin with. However, I temper that statement by saying that, genre
elements aside, there are other factors in this movie that I was able to
be as objective as possible about, so don't discount what you're about to
read below just because I needed some Serious Therapy after watching
"Bone".
The Story (WARNING: some spoilers contained below):
Link Rhyme (Washington) was a Top-Notch NYPD Forensics cop and true-crimes
writer, a Criminologist in the true sense of the term, until his career
(and almost life) is cut short when a huge beam falls on him during a
crime scene investigation. Paralyzed almost completely ("except for one
finger, my shoulders, my head, and my mind"), he is still able to use his
sharp mind and remain on the active duty roster, even from his
hi-teched-out apartment--but he fears the seizures he experiences will
leave him in a vegetative state. He makes a pact with Dr. Lehman (Hickey),
against the wishes of his health care worker, Thelma (Latifah), to
disconnect the health monitors that Richard Thompson (Orser) installed, if
that ever happens.
Meanwhile, on the other side of town...Officer Amelia Donaghy (Jolie)
discovers a gruesome crime scene, which she valiantly protects by stepping
in front of a moving train to stop it from disturbing the evidence.
Catching wind of her balls-y actions, Rhyme enlists her reluctant help,
along with Top-Notch police chemist Eddie Ortiz (Guzman) and Det. Paulie
Sellitto (Ed O'Neill), to stop a sadistic serial killer in his
tracks--much to the dismay of ObAsshole Capt. Howard Cheney (Rooker). But
who is the killer, and why is he committing such gruesome murders?
The Upshot: 
After watching "Bone", I know the "who". It's the "why" that makes me
shake my head with wonder at the lengths movie-makers will go through to
try to "entertain" their audience; or more bluntly, to get the duckets
rollin' in.
Oh, it started evenly enough. If you're into that sorta thing, the gory
thriller aspects were, literally, right out of the book; "Freddie Kruger"
and pals ain't got nuthin' on this crew. I Felt Amelia's Pain when she
said she couldn't handle dealing with the gore the killer left behind, but
had to; I wanted to bolt from the theater many times myself, but I made
the commitment to do this review, and (with my husband's help) forced
myself to look at the screen through my disgust at the nastiness involved.
But my disgust at the plot holes...well, that's a different story (I'll
come back to this in a moment).
For the most part, the actors were adequate, if not good, in their roles.
As foine as Washington is (and more to the point, as good an actor as he
is), he was restrained in this role, out of the necessity of having to act
the part of a totally paralyzed cop. All the gadgets and gizmos in the
room couldn't help him bring more...oompf...to this role; it makes me
wonder how a real quadriplegic actor would've handled it. Still, he wasn't
bad, per se, and during the next-to-last scene (the one that caused my
tension-related cry), he was quite good in what must have been a difficult
part for him to play (oh yeah; my co-reviewer--my husband, Bear--wanted me
to mention the sense of humor Denzel displayed, specifically when he joked
about Jolie's character being in trouble for "molesting the handicapped".
This, of course, must be seen in context to be fully understood). Jolie
was, I think, the better of the two leads; subtly beautiful (I was struck
by the way she looked good without trying to), more akin to "Homicide's"
Kay Howard than Renee Shepard [that one's for you, Jhim], I found her
believable in her role as a Street Cop With Skeletons. Guzman is one of
those great character actors who you always notice, but can never remember
his name. His easy sense of humor and firm grasp of his role made his
character stand out from the background, as did (surprisingly) O'Neill's
Sellitto, and mah gurl Queen Latifah (in Yet Another Role as an aide; but
that seems to be her speed, so I won't sweat it). And the camera work,
hilited in the rain-falling-down shots, as well as a brilliant, MTV-esque
sequence that moved with lightning speed from a street scene up to Rhyme's
apartment, was quite effective (though they went to the rain well once too
many times).
The shortcuts that were taken by the writer and director, though, were
what turned me off, almost as much as the nature of the film itself.
Though Rooker has a history of playing the ObligatoryAsshole, there was no
sense of backstory to show why his assholiness was so assholy, here;
surely, movie writers, there must be one New York Police Captain who isn't
"a living monument to ineptitude", eh? These kind of characters, stoopid
without cause, are just too through. And before I forget, what's up with
having those characters jump into a New York river on "November 9th" (as
the writer, for ghod knows what reason, had Thelma point out)--only to
come out basically dry, and more to the point, not suffer from at least
minor hypothermia? Man, I hate it when the strings show like that.
But the biggest crime comes in the form of the killer himself, the
"motivation" given as the reason he did what he did, and as the movie went
on, the "aha's" to the clues the killer left. It felt as if two writers
worked on this movie: one that handled the killer and Rooker characters,
another that took care of everything else. And the final insult was the
pasted-on final scene that DID NOT FIT the flow of the rest of the movie;
there was an audible "huh?" in the theater. There was one good though
about it, though: it shook the chill that pervaded my body during the
scene that preceded it, right off me.
The "Black Factor"    [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
In my review of "The Best Man", I spoke of "color indifference", the
mindset that, specific cultural issues aside, many experiences are
universal, and don't require an actor of a specific ethnicity to play a
given role (the Whitney Houston TV version of "Cinderella" was a good
example of this; it had actors of multiple ethnicities play roles that
made some people blink--especially with Brandy as Cinderella and
Bernadette Peters as her stepmother). Color-indifferent casting, though
still rare, is happening more often with big-name stars cast in what were
written originally as "White" roles. Washington, here in "Bone", as well
as Morgan Freeman in "Kiss The Girls" and "ER's" Eriq LaSalle's "Lucas
Davenport" from the "Prey" series, have been beneficiaries of such
color-indifferent casting; whatever the motivation behind this, I only
hope it's not just a passing fad.
Bammer's Bottom Line:
If gory thrillers with no real sense of direction, stock characters that
fit the Bad Guy mold to a T, and plot twists that aren't so twisty, are
your Thing, you'll probably be one of the millions that'll make this flick
the Next Big Movie of this week (or so says my husband, anyway; and I
think he's as right as the stylistic rain that kept falling, very
noticeably, throughout "Bone"). For me, though, the sheen on the surface
didn't hide the hollowness within. And be forewarned: you might want to
take a barf bag.

DIRECTED BY: Phillip Noyce
WRITTEN BY: Jeremy Iacone, based on the book by Jeffery Deaver

MPAA: Rated R for strong violent content including grisly images, and for language.
Runtime: USA:118
After David Fincher's "Se7en" (1997), there have been several attempts
to create a film similar in story and impact, but without any
success. "Fallen" (1998), "Resurrection" (1998) and "Kiss the Girls"
(1998) are some.  The latest is 'The Bone Collector' (1999!), which is
like most of its predecessors a failure. The directors of these films
have all tried to copy every aspect of Fincher's work: a dark
detective story, lots of violence, a gritty atmosphere and impressive
cast. But though they all shot during night, had the most inventive
murderers and murders (that successfully got them the necessary
R-rating) they were unable to produce the most important, that what
you can not copy -- talent.
The plot is a collection of stereotypes beginning with the brilliant
policeman, philosopher and writer Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington)
who, under the investigation broke his spine and lies now at home,
where he is taken care of the good nurse (Queen Latifah) and friend
(Gary Swanson ). He and the rest of the inhabitants of New York city
are oblivious of the psycho-killer that realms the streets, picking up
his victims in a cab and murdering them using the most ancient
methods. One of these innocent victim's body is found by Amelia
Donaghy (Angelina Joilie), who has handled the episode with such
professionalism that it catches Rhyme's attention. The police, led by
'Bundy''s Ed O'Neill (I) is helpless and it is up to Rhyme and his
young apprentice to catch the killer..
The story is filled with mysterious leads, bizarre puzzles and
devastating events, but who cares? It just isn't interesting. It
doesn't have any drive to it. There is nothing that this movie can
boast of. It approaches familiar themes and enters explored
territories, but it doesn't have neither the intensity and dark
philosophy of "Se7en" or the sophistication of "Silence of the
Lambs". I think it's time for the directors to realize that there has
to be a point, at least some intelligence in the story, besides the
murders, chases and darkness. Apparently that element was
forgotten. None of the performances are worthy of notice, the
cinematography is a poor copy of Darius Khondji (Seven), the editing
is average, the music a cliche. In fact the whole film feels like a
clone, an unsuccessful mutation of all the psycho-thrillers that we've
seen before. Joilie and Washington are unable to look as a potential
couple, unable to generate tension, yet alone drive the story
forward. The other actors act as they are just waiting for their
paychecks. The sets are dark, but unreal. And the whole film looks
staged, pointless and even phony at times. Even the awaited ending is
a disappointment. This is the classic example of an artistic failure,
but it certainly doesn't mean that it's completely unwatchable. It is
a film for a rainy day and two free hours when you do not know what to
do. And then you just may insert this cassette into your VCR, press
PLAY and let Washington and Joilie guide you on a pointless, but
occasionally enjoyable ride through the dark streets of New York.

Cranky CriticŽ movie reviews: The Bone Collector
Rated  [R], 118 minutes
Starring Denzel Washington, Angelina Jolie,
Queen Latifah, Luis  Guzman, Michael Rooker and Ed O'Neill
Screenplay by Jeremy Iacone
Based on the book by Jeffery Deaver
Directed by Philip Noyce
website: www.thebonecollector.com
The Bone Collector falls into the realm of Thriller, rather than the
slice n' dice generic horrorflick we've gotten used to over the last
bunch of years. In it, Denzel Washington stars as Lincoln Rhyme, a
quadriplegic police detective who has lost the will to live and Angelina
Jolie as Amelia Donaghy, the able bodied cop who finds herself
unwillingly doing all the leg work that he cannot.
Does that sound like a movie pitch line, or what? Of course it does. But
with an A-list name above the credits, you expect more than special
effects, and Denzel Washington is too smart an actor, and too
intelligent a human being -- we've met him. The dude's cool -- to
cheaply exploit a disabled character. Washington told us in his StarTalk that, as an
actor "I realized what a challenge it could be; we didn't even know,
going in, if it would work, playing a guy that doesn't move, could only
move one finger, and was essentially a talking head. The question is:
How do you make that interesting?"
You leave it to the writer, in this case Jeremy Iacone adapting the
novel by Jeffery Deaver, to come up with something interesting and
compelling. If the supporting cast is too small, you make the murders
especially gruesome and the mystery they present especially twisted. In
this case that means someone is roaming the New York City streets,
kidnapping the innocent and carving em up right down to the bone. It
isn't the cutting that kills the victims, it's what happens to them
afterwards 'cuz the killer is far too creative a sadistic sumbitch for
that. Small clues left at the scene, things that only an expert forensic
cop like Washington's Rhyme would understand, are deliberately left
behind. Rhyme, who has finally found a doctor willing to help him pull
the plug, finds the challenge of putting this puzzle together enough to
spark the police brain inside his head back to life. Jolie's character,
who has an instinctive feel for forensics work, is essentially ordered
into the story. Rhyme still commands a full range of police support --
Ed O'Neill as his former partner; Luis Guzman as a high tech
criminologist; Michael Rooker as the police commander adversary who has
problems with a cripple running `his officers' all around the City --
and has enough insurance to cover a full time medical aide (Queen
Latifah, who is especially good). As the murders get increasingly, um,
disgusting, Donaghy finds that her cop instincts are exactly what the
guy in the bed told here they were. Real good.
The Bone Collector gets gory but thankfully director Philip Noyce allows
most of the truly gruesome stuff to happen offscreen. That doesn't make
seeing the results any easier, but the flick never degenerates into a
standard slice n' dice. If that's what turns you were hoping for, you
are in need of serious mental help.
Those of you that have read the history page have probably figured out
that Cranky was paralyzed for a while -- I was wide awake for the very
brief time when my status went from para to quadriplegic and there's
nothing more terrifying than that. Long time readers also know that I'll
nail any flick that screws with the medical aspects of spinal injuries.
There's nothing to nail in this flick. The details are all there, if
you're looking for them but they're all subjugated to the murder-mystery
story, which is pretty damn good. Unlike most adaptations, what made it
from the print page to the screen holds together pretty well.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to The Bone Collector, he would have
paid...
Hmm... dateflick level for a gory murder mystery. Must be something
about the chemistry between Washington and Jolie that makes it a couples
flick. Tipping you to the one thing that didn't work for me would spoil
the ending so I'll warn those who take pleasure in using their
brainpower to try to second guess the ending not to, 'cuz when you shoot
your mouth off that you figured it out, someone'll hit you.

Imagine a story about a master sleuth, cut down in his prime left in a
state of immobility. He is called upon to help in the investigation of
a series of murders so vicious that the even the police are baffled.
Now add to that mix a young rookie cop, called upon by the paralyzed
investigator to assist him on the case. That simple little plot line
sounds like an intriguing idea for a thriller. Don't be fooled. 'The
Bone Collector' is one of the most maddeningly intelligence stifling
films since 1998's 'Lost In Space'. What makes the film even more
aggravating is the utter waste of a talented cast and crew.
Denzel Washington stars as Lincoln Rhyme, a quadriplegic former
Forensics specialist. Unable to move other than his eyes, his mouth
and one finger (no ventilators or catheters here?!), he wants to end
his life. His injury also causes seizures which may result in brain
death. His character is shown laying in his deluxe apartment (which
could house a small business, I didn't know cops were paid that much
in NYC), watching a peregrine falcon roosting on his window sill. The
bird seems to be an ally, watching over the detective; giving him the
strength to carry on.
When a powerful New York City businessman is found murdered, rookie
officer Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) is first to arrive on the
scene. Using a disposable camera she, documents the crime scene before
evidence is washed away by the rain. She discovers additional evidence
one the train tracks and single handedly stops the on-coming train
before it can destroy the clues. This exercise in examination and care
brings her to the attention of Rhyme, who has been called back into
service by his friends on the force, to the chagrin of Capt. Howard
Cheney (Michael Rooker). Urging Officer Donaghy to be his eyes on the
crime scene, an unusual partnership is started.
We are introduced to the killer almost immediately in the form of a
shadowy cab driver who has a toy monkey hanging from his rear view
mirror. One of the clues left at the murder scene (and at each murder
scene) is a small bone fragment, always in the most preposterously
difficult location, but always found. All of the clues are discovered,
including a series of small pieces of paper no bigger than a corner of
a postage stamp. All of these clues lead Officer Donaghy to the
discovery of a true crime book published in the early 1920's called
"The Bone Collector". The crimes being committed are exact duplicates
of the crimes detailed in the book, but no motive can be deduced. That
is until the maddeningly contrived and ridiculous ending, where Ryhme
is confronted by the serial killer who goes to great lengths to
explain his reasoning for the murders and why Ryhme was his primary
victim all along.
Now, to be certain; 'The Bone Collector' does have a grand amount of
atmosphere. The Cinematography by Dean Semler creates a New York so
seedy and forbidding as to possibly kill that states tourist industry
for the next decade. But the plotting of the film and the entire set
up is so convoluted and contrived that it plays like an accident. A
fine example is when searching an old bookstore, Officer Donaghy finds
the "Bone Collector" novel in the first place she looks, on the top
shelve four feet above her, in the second row, buried under several
other books. Now while the character's deductive powers are supposed
to be brilliant, this is taking it too far.
Also.. and this is a spoiler (so do not read this if you do intend to
see the film).
When the killer finally attacks Rhyme in his apartment, he takes so
long to explain his motives that Rhyme is able to finally regain
movement in his hand, enough so that he can operate his hospital bed
to collapse onto the villains hand. At that point, Rhyme is also able
to move his neck enough to deliver the final blow (which does not yet
end the attack). And of course, this just prolongs the climax long
enough for Officer Donaghy to save the day.
The film is so maddening, in that here you have some of the best
talent in film making working on a project so by the numbers, that it
becomes almost absurd. The clues are all pointless, they are set ups
that lead the police in the opposite direction of where they should be
looking. If this were a real example of NYPD investigative resources,
that the crime rates would be astronomical. Mayor Gulliani  should sue
Universal for defamation of local.
Director Philip Noyce (whose credits include the marvelously deft
"Dead Calm" and amusing Zatoichi remake "Blind Fury"), works with a
sure hand. He manages to draw such earnest performances from his
actors, that one could almost (almost), forget the plot contrivances
here. Unfortunately, the script by Jeremy Iocone is loaded with every
possible variation of the serial killer genre, that the film becomes a
template of scenes that never really coalesce into a whole film.
The performances are all very earnest. Angelina Jolie shines as
Officer Donaghy. Her growing maturity and revulsion at her work is
both honest and believable. Ditto Denzel Washington, who manages to
make us accept his physical condition as well as his desire for death.
The chemistry between these two stars is palpable, but unfortunately
even that is dissipated by the inclusion of a scene wherein Officer
Donaghy strokes Rhymes one good finger. That scene is so riff with
unsubtle sexual overtones that it's juvenile.
"The Bone Collector" is one film that should have been better. It
tries hard to be a variation of the film "Se7en", but only succeeds in
being a morbid and grotesque remake of a Umberto Lenzi giallo film. A
disappointing and ultimately disastrous film.

As action/suspense movies go, this is one that ranks above average. But,
make no mistake about it -- it isn't quite in the same league with movies
like Seven or Silence Of The Lambs. Although, it does try very hard to get
there. Including generous use of grisly, but not overly gratuitous, scenes
featuring butchered dead bodies.
Denzel Washington plays Lincoln Rhyme, a police forensic specialist who had
suffered a spinal injury several years before which left him a quadriplegic.
Rhyme now only has movement from his neck up, and limited movement in his
little finger. But even though he is no longer able to go into the field, he
still has the best investigative mind around and is called upon frequently
by the New York Police Department in serious cases. This is one of those
cases. A serial killer called The Bone Collector is posing as a cab driver
and kidnapping people. He then brutally kills them and leaves little clues
with the butchered bodies, taunting the police to put the pieces together
and find him before he kills again. Angelina Jolie plays a young officer who
finds one of The Bone Collector's victims and impresses Rhyme with her
natural ability in forensics. So much so, that he shanghais the reluctant
woman into joining him on the investigation. She is to serve as his eyes and
ears in the field while he talks her through the investigation from his bed.
No surprise that the investigation takes her to some of the deepest recesses
of New York city on her mission to stop the killer before he strikes again.
First, let me say that Phillip Noyce did an excellent job of directing The
Bone Collector. Like the movie that this is most easily compared to, Seven,
much of the action takes place in dimly lit areas. Unlike Seven, which
seemed to take place in a perpetual rainstorm, it is abandoned subway
tunnels and decaying buildings that give The Bone Collector it's feel of
impending death. A great soundtrack also helps to darken the mood
considerably.
Washington may have given his best performance ever in this film. It is
truly a credit to his abilities that he plays such an integral and
interesting part in this movie based solely on his facial expressions and
tone of voice. But as good as Washington is, this is Angelina Jolie's movie.
This is really Jolie's first major starring role and she carries the movie
beautifully. The fact that she is one of the most beautiful women in
Hollywood doesn't hurt either. Am I the only one that thinks she has the
most amazing lips ever? Washington and Jolie also have a great deal of help
from the supporting cast. Michael Rooker (Cliffhanger) is Jolie's nemesis,
the head of the police forensics department, and plays up the character's
arrogance to the hilt. Queen Latifah also does a solid job in her fairly
small role as Rhyme's personal aid. The two biggest surprises would have to
be Ed O'Neill and Luis Guzman. O'Neill plays the lead detective on the case
and gives a performance that I never would have expected from the man best
known as Al Bundy. But the biggest treat was Guzman as Eddie, an NYPD
forensic technician. He had some of the best one-liners in the film and
stole just about every scene that he was in. My only complaint with him was
that he didn't get more screen time.
The comparisons between this film and Seven are inevitable, and very
understandable. But The Bone Collector is more than able to stand on its own
besides the obvious similarities. If I had one major complaint, it would be
the film's ending. Without giving anything away, I thought the choice of the
killer was a bit weak, and the ending was just a bit too formula for an
otherwise clever movie. I haven't read the novel by Jeffery Deaver upon
which this movie is based, but I have read the sequel, The Coffin Dancer.
Knowing how clever that book was, I wouldn't be at all surprised to find
that The Bone Collector lost a little something in the translation from the
page to the big screen.
Regardless of its flaws, The Bone Collector is still a great movie. The
story is entertaining, albeit a bit gory in places, and the directing is
superb. But the best reason to check out this movie is for the cast. All the
performances are bang on and Jolie shows why she is an actress to watch in
the coming years.

  During the greedy 1980s the word "mentor" became the
most fashionable term in the American lexicon.  Mentors are
people who "adopt" young, rising workers, show them the
ropes, and ease their way into the fast track of steady
promotions.  "The Bone Collector" is about such a person,
unusual in that he is frightfully handicapped, but there is no
greed or economic motivation involved in his relationship with
the younger member.  This is a buddy movie, a police drama,
a revenge fantasy and even a romance between two folks
who--in the typical Hollywood formula--have bones to pick
with each other in the early part but collect nothing but good
will as their affiliation deepens.  A watchable movie despite
its lack of originality, "The Bone Collector" takes off from the
classic "Seven," David Fincher's portrait of a serial killer who
wallows in the depths of human depravity, deliberately leaving
clues around his murders to taunt the police.  While Phillip
Noyce, its director, exploits the appeal of one of Hollywood's
handsomest, Denzel Washington, the picture often look like a
showcase for the seductive Angelina Jolie--who has yet to
prove that she can act--though New York Times critic
Stephen Holden cites her "sensuous lips and eyes that burn
with a soft, melting fire" and calls her the most alluring of the
young Hollywood stars.
   The Martin Bregman production taken from Jeffrey
Deaver's novel and a screenplay by Jeremy Iacone has been
cited by some as a picture for strong stomachs only and for
masochists.  Even Roger Ebert downgraded the production
for what he considers the excessive gore.  While not
exceptionally violent, some scenes do present a challenge for
the sensitive eyes.  We see in mid-range the face of a New
York University student who had been bloodied and left tied
up in a subterranean hell for the rats to devour.  We see as
well the corpse of a middle-aged woman, similarly handcuffed
to a pipe, who has been executed by a long burst of steam. 
In one instance, an older man is found drowned at the pier
but his young granddaughter is rescued, which seems to
prove that commercial movies can dispense with the old but
are fearful of letting the audience believe a vulnerable little
girl with a life ahead of her should be left for dead.
   The story opens on a policewoman assigned to counsel
youths, Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie), who happens upon
a man whose hand is showing through the gravel in which he
is buried, a finger amputated with his wife's wedding band on
the stub.  This signals us that the killer is mocking the police
by deliberately leaving a clue and that we are bound to find
similar victims of a serial killer.  The most frightening images,
however, are not of the bloodied, beaten and ravaged victims
of this sick personality but the sight of various passengers
getting into the killer's taxicab only to be locked in, blocked
by impenetrable glass from exiting the vehicle.
   Much of the drama takes place in the spacious apartment
of Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington), a forensic expert with
the police department who, four years previous, was
paralyzed by a falling beam.  He now has a intricate array of
machinery to direct forensics and a full-time nurse, Thelma
(Queen Latifah), to care for him and administer oxygen when
he undergoes seizures.  Since Rhyme has no feeling except
in one finger, he is suicidal, particularly fearing the one big
seizure that will leave him a vegetable.  Though he has made
arrangements with a friendly doctor for a "final transition," the
case involving this serial killer awakens his interest in life.  He
is particularly fond of Officer Donaghy, and pushes her
against her will into pursuing the case.
   The plot is loaded with absurdities, but that's the name of
the game with commercial murder mysteries.  The audience,
like Officer Rhyme, tries to figure out who the killer is, but
unfortunately--in the picture's major flaw--the perp is no one
you could possibly expect.  He is like "a temp, in for the day,"
as Roger Ebert says, a psychotic individual bent on revenge
whose clues would not likely be of use to any with less
prescience than the two New York cops who decipher them--
with the aid of wild coincidences such as one that occurs in a
store stocking old, turn-of-the-century books.
   New York looks great.  The skyscrapers framed at night
are majestic, enough to bring in any tourists who might
otherwise have been scared away by yet another picture
about that (formerly) high-crime city.  The studio shots, which
serve as the subterranean hells of sewer systems and an
unused subway station, are something out of Dante.  We can
even overlook the outrageous coincidences and out-of-the-
blue killer as typical contrivances of commercial murder
mysteries, because "The Bone Collector" is gripping and Ms.
Jolie, for all her tentativeness in the acting department, is
pleasant on the eyes.

The Bone Collector  Dir: Phillip Noyce. Starring Denzel Washington, Angelina
Jolie, Queen Latifah, Ed OâNeill and Michael Rooker.
The pitch: A quadriplegic NYC homicide detective helps his protĂŠgĂŠ track
down a brilliant serial killer obsessed with true crime.
After a solid first hour of chilling suspense, this high-concept thriller
unravels completely in the final, disappointing reel. The killerâs identity
may come out of the blue, but the rationale for the killings is so
preposterous, so dependent on nearly impossible coincidences, that we just
donât believe it.
Washington plays the immobilized detective who feels suicidal four years
after a freak accident left him paralyzed below the neck, save for just
enough movement in his left index finger to allow manipulation of a computer
trackball. His computer, television monitor and telephone are all voice
activated, which is crucial to the climax. Before the accident, Washingtonâs
character was a renowned detective specializing in analysis of forensic
evidence. Confined to a motorized bed, forced to gulp oxygen from a straw
strapped to his headrest, now he only wants to die. The role is daunting â`
Washington is limited to facial expressions and changes in the tone of his
voice. His nurse, the motherly Latifah, refuses to give up on her patient,
even though he wants âto check out of this life.â?
Jolie is a novice cop who comes upon a grisly crime scene: a
multimillionaire developer buried under tons of gravel near a railroad line.
Only his hands are exposed, fingers frozen with rigor mortis as though
clutching at the air. The dead manâs wife is still missing, a captive of a
serial killer who leaves maddeningly obscure clues as to his whereabouts and
motives.
Washingtonâs friend and fellow detective, OâNeill, assigns Jolie to the
case, which is a helluva promotion for a street cop. But OâNeill has his
reasons. Jolie can be Washingtonâs surrogate at the crime scene. And he can
communicate with her via two-way radio as they try to catch the killer. It
gives Washington a reason to live.
The killerâs methods are markedly gruesome. Some victims are flayed to the
bone. One is boiled alive by steam jetting from an exhaust pipe (even in
shadow, these scenes are grisly and graphic). With Washingtonâs deductive
skills, Jolie is able to draw closer to the psychopath, despite the
interference of a territorial police captain (Rooker) â` one of those
needlessly stupid characters whose purpose is to get in the way of the
heroes just so they can prove him wrong, again and again. Rooker and the
film deserve better than this old screenwriterâs crutch.
Then again, so does the climax, which hinges on a ridiculous number of
circumstances coming together with precision timing. Not in New York City,
baby. The movie backs itself into a corner, since a confrontation between
the immobile Washington and the killer is inevitable. But how to show these
two in a battle of wits, a fight to the death, without stretching
plausibility to the breaking point? Itâs a question the filmmakers should
have answered before shooting the picture and tacking on a coda that even
Frank Capra would have found corny.

Reviewed by Dustin Putman, November 5, 1999.
Around this time two years ago, the public was blessed (or cursed) with "Kiss 
the Girls," one of the most ludicrous and dull films in the Serial Killer 
genre this decade. Beating it out for that shameful title is Phillip Noyce's 
"The Bone Collector," which bears more than a passing similarity with the 
former. Both star a highly regarded actor (Morgan Freeman, Denzel Washington) 
who sets out to stop the killer, as well as a resourceful, young woman 
(Ashley Judd, Angelina Jolie) who is forced, in one way or another, to take 
matters into her own hands.  Both films are so illogically plotted that you 
eventually give up attempting to care about the characters and situations, 
while the climax relies on that annoying standby, the Talking Killer cliche, 
in which the culprit's identity is revealed and instead of doing off with the 
main characters right away, conveniently chats with them until someone shows 
up to stop him from acting out his dirty deeds. One of the things that made 
1995's "Se7en" one of the most disturbing, memorable films in the genre in 
the last few years is because it took the conventions and stood them on their 
head, never going for what was to be expected by a mainstream audience. Just 
the thought of the frighteningly devastating conclusion still has the power 
to bring chills up my spine, while the thought of the culmination in "The 
Bone Collector" just makes me want to close my eyes and shake my head in 
disbelief.
After an enthralling opening credits sequence that owes most of its 
effectiveness to the subtly creepy music score by Craig Armstrong, things go 
downhill--fast. Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) is one of New York City's 
leading forensic cops until he becomes almost fully paralyzed in a freak 
accident on a crime scene. Forced to spend the rest of his life in a bed, 
Lincoln is cared for by his sassy, dedicated nurse Thelma (Queen Latifah), 
but doesn't see much reason for living anymore. When a grisly homicide is 
documented by model-turned-novice-cop Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie), 
Lincoln is so impressed with her skills that he asks her to take over the 
case, despite her area not being forensics. Amelia reluctantly agrees, but 
soon has built a close rapport with Lincoln, who constantly is pushing her to 
do things she doesn't want to do, but that he knows will make her a better 
person in her profession. Meanwhile, the body count gradually builds up, with 
the killer posing as a taxi driver who, instead of taking his customers to 
their preferred destinations, drives them to their deaths.
"The Bone Collector" is a film that so closely follows the blueprint for the 
generic Serial Killer movie, you question its reason for being made at all. 
Offering no originality (unlike 1995's "Copycat"), no realism (unlike 1990's 
"Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"), no intelligence (unlike 1991's "The 
Silence of the Lambs"), no surprises (unlike "Se7en"), and not one character 
we get to know well enough to care about (unlike all of the above), the film 
is a lifeless product that is tiresomely directed by Noyce (who helmed such 
strong films as 1992's "Patriot Games" and 1994's "Clear and Present 
Danger"). Noyce's heart doesn't seem to be in his latest picture, nor does 
screenwriter Jeremy Iacone's, and no wonder. More than anything, "The Bone 
Collector" is the latest in a never-ending parade of movies that extract the 
feeling of "been there, done that" in the viewer. 
What can you say to Denzel Washington other than, "you got what was coming to 
you." Appearing in the far superior 1998 Serial Killer movie "Fallen," 
Washington apparently saw a reason in being in another the following year, 
and he was bound to stumble on a rotten apple sooner or later. Washington is 
a dynamic performer, but has nothing to do here, literally and figuratively. 
Since his character of Lincoln is paralyzed, he spends 99% of his screen time 
lying in a bed, without being able to move anything but his head, shoulders, 
and one finger. A challenge for any actor, to be sure, but Washington comes 
off as nothing more than a distraction to the storyline at hand, and he isn't 
given enough worthwhile material to rise above being merely an afterthought.
One of the most exciting young actresses to appear in the last couple years, 
Angelina Jolie was a standout in last year's touching "Playing by Heart," and 
a scene-stealer in last spring's "Pushing Tin," but her luck has momentarily 
run out with this deadly project. For one, the stunning Jolie should have 
fired her makeup person and hair stylist because she looks downright ragged 
here, and her performance seems rather muted and cold. Try as she might, 
Jolie is miscast in the role and isn't able to pull it off, unlike Ashley 
Judd in "Kiss the Girls," who was the one saving grace.
In the only notable supporting role, Queen Latifah is sorely wasted to the 
point where I am tempted to hunt down the filmmakers and slap them for 
throwing her surprising talents away. Thelma is the sole character I liked, 
and yet this is due completely to Latifah's bright presence, as her character 
is one-dimensional and stale. Ed O'Neill (TV's "Married...With Children"), 
Mike McGlone (1996's "She's All That"), and Leland Orser (1998's "Very Bad 
Things") all show up and make zero impression, while Michael Rooker, as shady 
Capt. Howard Cheney, is literally pointless in every way, giving off brooding 
looks at every turn just so we will think he is the killer. Sorry, folks, but 
the first rule in this type of film is that the character who is most 
obviously the killer is invariably just a red herring.
There is nary a sign of freshness in the whole overlong 118 minutes it took 
for "The Bone Collector" to reach its end. Someone who sees a lot of movies 
usually hopes, or at least should, that a film headed for oblivion will make 
a sudden U-turn and either get better or become more entertaining (even if it 
is on the "so-bad-it's-good" level). Not this time. The lack of enthusiasm 
for this misguided project shines through in every performance and in 
director Noyce's unsatisfying direction, and, therefore, it never has the 
ability to involve you, or make you give one iota about the proceedings. "The 
Bone Collector" is strictly cut-and-paste filmmaking, and it doesn't even do 
a respectable job at that, either.

Yes, it's thrilling, suspenseful and at times even bone-chilling. One
woman's scream becomes a crying siren of emergency vehicles rushing to save
her from being boiled alive. That's an effective scene change. In fact, "The
Bone Collector" is a pretty good movie right up to the end where it makes a
clean break into not being a very good movie -- fractured, as it were, in
several places.
The on and off Denzel, is more on in this movie than off while Jolie is
simply radiant. Denzel plays a paralyzed homicide investigator for whom the
rookie cop Jolie becomes the eyes, ears and body. There's a killer loose,
he's leaving all kinds of TV movie clues for Denzel to decode. The
production, direction and acting work as a team to keep this film alive and
kicking; unfortunately the poorly scripted climax overwhelms them all with
stale anti-drama and ultimately leaves the picture itself somewhat hog-tied
and whimpering.

Written by: Jeffery Deaver (novel), Jeremy Iacone
A dark city, a constant downpour, a serial killer who the cops can't catch, and
a brilliant detective who is the only one capable of finding him. With a tried
and true formula like this, how could a film possibly go wrong? By being
utterly, ridiculously implausible. Another example of how fine acting from the
leads can't save a script this unbelievable.
Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) was once a brilliant detective, but a falling
pipe crushed his spine and his will to live. Despite support from his friends,
Thelma (Queen Latifah) and fellow detective Paulie (Ed O'Neill), he has decided
to end his life before his injury escalates and he becomes a vegetable.
However, Paulie wants his help on one more case, which involves a killer taxi
driver who is leaving clues for the police. Lincoln agrees, but only if young
officer Amelia (Angelina Jolie) will be his eyes and ears by filming crime
scenes and reporting to him.
As I said, the acting here is really quite good, particularly from Denzel
Washington. It's remarkable what a performance he can deliver, despite being
able to move only his head and one finger. Angelina Jolie delivers an adequate
performance, but seems rather miscast. As always, it's a pleasure to see Ed
O'Neill in a film. Being known almost entirely for his role as Al Bundy on
"Married With Children", it's good to see the talented actor trying his hand at
something new. Michael Rooker (Cliffhanger, Tombstone) makes an appearance as
the useless Captain Cheney, whos character seems present only to hassle the
investigators and irritate the audience.
Speaking of implausibilities, how long do you believe a train takes to stop?
Quite a long time, at any rate. According to "The Bone Collector", it takes
maybe 20 yards to come to a complete stop. The scene involves Amelia just
having found a body and a clue which lies on the train tracks. She stands in
front of the train, yelling for it to stop and waving her arms back and forth.
The clue is a piece of paper held down by a bolt. This could very easily have
been moved off the tracks, but this wouldn't have been nearly as tense a scene
I suppose.
Another nice, impossible scene involves Amelia searching for a book which will
reveal the identity of the killer, according to Lincoln. The first store she
looks for this rare book in happens to have it, and she discovers its location
by reaching to the top of a shelf and pulling a pile of books down. The novel
in question lands right on top, turned towards her. As for the identity of the
killer, I guessed it as soon as he appeared on screen; but when his identity is
truly revealed, it comes completely out of left field, so don't even try to
guess his motives.
"The Bone Collector" runs a little too long at 118 minutes. I'd recommend it
only for die-hard fans of either the genre, or Denzel Washington. Even if you
fall under one of these categories, I'd still suggest waiting for video.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Phillip Noyce's (The Saint) adaptation of Jeffrey Deaver's bestseller is
a clunky effort that could have been much better under a decent
director's care.  Denzel Washington stars as a decorated cop that became
paralyzed in the line of duty.  Bedridden, he tries to catch a serial
killer using an inexperienced female officer as his vessel to catch the
murderer in this sloppy whodunit.
Washington (The Siege) plays Lincoln Rhyme, who is not only a successful
New York City police officer but the author of several true-crime books
as well.  The film opens with Rhyme bravely trying to rescue a trapped
citizen, only to be hit with a falling hunk of metal that nearly cuts
him in half.  Four years later, Rhyme is still technically a member of
the police force, although he can move only his head, one shoulder and,
for some reason, the index finger of his right hand, which he uses to
operate several computers and televisions while he is confined to his
bed.  He also has seizures with increasing frequency and is terrified
that a big one could leave him like a vegetable.  Apparently he hasn't
seen himself act lately.
Meanwhile, the killer is a cabbie and each fare is a potential victim.
We see him pick up a ritzy white couple at the airport.  They want to go
to 5th Avenue, but instead he takes them into a desolate neighborhood
while they desperately try to escape from the backseat.  Couldn't they
call for help?  I'm thinking that the odds of picking up New Yorkers
without a cell phone are staggering, as is the likelihood of the
existence of that perfectly straight road he sped down with no lights,
stop signs, traffic or pedestrians.
The man's body is discovered by Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie, Pushing
Tin), a child-model-turned-beat-cop that plans to be transferred to the
less-exciting Youth Services Division.  The evidence she finds - white
powder, a newspaper clipping, a large bolt and a page number torn from a
book  are taken to Rhyme, where he is able to quickly determine the
exact time and place of the murderer's next act.  Unlikely?  You bet.
This is explained away by having Rhyme well-versed in the history of the
city.  Right.  And monkeys might fly out of my butt.
While confined to bed, Rhyme sends Donaghy to each crime scene as they
try to gain ground on the killer.  He instructs her in what evidence to
look for, relying on her eyes and ears as he tries to avoid having
control of the investigation wrestled away by Captain Howard Cheney
(Michael Rooker, The Replacement Killers).  At one point, Cheney is kept
at bay by Rhyme's live-in nurse Thelma (Queen Latifah, Living out
Loud).  Nurse Latifah is actually the acting high-point of Collector.
Washington is better than he has been lately, which isn't saying much.
I hear he's very good in The Hurricane, which arrives in theaters in
January, but I'll believe it when I see it.  Jolie isn't bad in her
role, but her attractiveness is almost distracting.  Other than her, the
other highlights are the dazzling overhead shots of New York City.  The
bland cast of co-stars include Ed O'Neill (Married with Children), Luis
Guzmán (OZ), Leland Orser (Very Bad Things) and Mike McGlone (She's the
One).  I'm sure the book was much better.
Comparisons to Silence of the Lambs will be inevitable, as the
experienced but immobile Washington guides the still-wet-behind-the-ears
Jolie to the murderer.  Instead, Collector seems more like See No Evil,
Hear No Evil, where a blind guy (Richard Pryor) and a deaf guy (Gene
Wilder) try to solve a murder.  Collector will likely be compared to
Se7en as well, but its staged murder scenes are not nearly as disturbing
as David Fincher's serial-killer benchmark.  Neither of these films
offered a red herring as poorly as in Collector.
1:58 - R for strong violent content including grisly images, and for
language

Less than 5 minutes into THE BONE COLLECTOR, the movie already has you
laughing at the stupidity of one of the two leads. Not a good omen.
Ex-fashion model turned street cop, Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) goes
alone -- no partner and no backup -- into a remote and dangerous area to
investigate what will prove to be a heinous crime scene. (Jolie is
convincing as an ex-fashion model but badly miscast as a cop.)  After
locating a mutilated corpse, Donaghy notices a small stack of evidence
on the nearby train tracks. When she sees an Amtrak locomotive barreling
down the tracks, she doesn't just scoop up the evidence. Oh no, that
would be too easy and not dramatic enough. Instead, she stands on the
tracks and hopes she can stop a speeding train that is coming right at
her. Trains like these take a long distance to come to a halt, but this
one stops just a few feet short of killing her and messing up her
evidence.
Denzel Washington plays a quadriplegic homicide detective named Lincoln
Rhyme, whose skills rival those of the great Sherlock Holmes. As we
first meet Rhyme, he's arranging for a doctor to kill him since he's
worried that he will become a vegetable. This arrangement is put on hold
when he's asked to help in solving the aforementioned case. The "perp"
(as in the perpetrator of the murder) turns out to be a serial killer
who loves leaving very obscure clues about his next victim.
Sound like David Fincher's SEVEN? With its gruesome crimes, THE BONE
COLLECTOR does possess many similarities -- the quality of the writing
and direction, however, not being part of them. THE BONE COLLECTOR,
directed by Phillip Noyce (THE SAINT) and scripted by Jeremy Iacone, is
a preposterous and predictable movie that insults the viewers'
intelligence every chance it gets. Only viewers who fall asleep will not
be able to guess who the last attempted victim will be.
In one of my favorites of the film's numerous improbabilities, Officer
Donaghy's boyfriend breaks up with her because of his therapist's
advice. With Angelina Jolie's looks, how many men would take that
advice? Most would quickly get rid of the therapist instead.
The director's staging is infuriating with his blend of overly clever
and clichéd plot devices. In order to illustrate how much Rhyme misses
the loss of his freedom, a peregrine falcon is shown in frequent
close-ups on the ledge of his apartment. The bird gets to flap his wings
and fly away. Rhyme doesn't have that same mobility, as we are
constantly reminded.
Rhyme decides that only Donaghy, a relative rookie, will do to be his
hands and eyes for the big investigation. He doesn't want some seasoned
veteran. Does this make any sense at all? Of course not.
Another ludicrous part of the story has a stuffed-shirt police boss,
Capt. Cheney (Michael Rooker), shut down Rhyme's entire investigation
just so that Capt. Cheney can save all the glory for himself.
Scene after scene is filled with abundant good luck. When Rhyme decides
that they need to locate a very old book, of which they don't even know
the title, the first bookstore that Donaghy goes to has it. Even better
than that, when she reaches up and accidentally pulls down a large batch
of books from the top shelf, on the top of the stack turns out to be
exactly the one she needs. Talking about a needle in the haystack!
The shamelessly manipulative story even falls back on the old child
endangerment episode for some cheap thrills. A sweet and innocent little
girl and her elderly grandfather are taken off so the killer can arrange
for them to die a miserable death.
So who is the killer? Don't waste your time guessing. The movie is one
of those infuriating ones in which the solution to the mystery comes
completely out of left field.
Denzel Washington, who has demonstrated his considerable talents in many
wonderful films (including MALCOLM X and HE GOT GAME), has sometimes
even been able to save some mediocre ones. FALLEN, for example, would
have been just a run-of-the-mill supernatural thriller without
Washington's efforts in it. No matter how hard he tries, however, even
Washington isn't able to save THE BONE COLLECTOR from its hackneyed
script and its ridiculous direction.
THE BONE COLLECTOR runs a long 1:58. It is rated R for strong violent
content, including grisly images, and for language. The film would be
acceptable for teenagers only if they are older and mature.

Rated on a 4-star scale; Screening venue - Odeon (Bromborough); Released in 
the UK by UIP on 14 January, 1999; certificate 15; 118 minutes; country of 
origin USA; aspect ratio 2.35:1
Directed by Phillip Noyce; produced by Martin Bregman, Michael Bregman, Louis 
A Stroller.
Written by Jeremy Iacone; based on the novel by Jeffery Deaver.
Photographed by Dean Semler; edited by William Hoy.
I arrived just in time, and got into the screening of "The Bone Collector" 
just as the lights were going down. I rushed to a good seat, settled in and 
quickly got comfortable -- the opening montage was pieced together in a 
luxurious, soothing way. It took me a minute to realise that the images it 
contained were depictions of horrific murders.
Nauseating brutality has become commonplace in Hollywood. Gone are the days 
when filmmakers expected us to be shocked by such releases as "The Silence of 
the Lambs", "Seven" or "Copycat" -- gather the kids round, folks, because 
savage slaughter is now considered fit material for any popcorn movie.
This one has the premise, pacing and structure of a cheap paperback thriller, 
but it's hard to dismiss it as disposable trash entertainment -- the 
big-budget production shows off glossy photography, pristine locations and a 
big star, Denzel Washington, in the lead role. Washington plays Lincoln 
Rhyme, a forensics expert who was paralysed from the neck down by a falling 
object at a crime scene. Rhyme once had the energy to write twelve 
criminology textbooks; now he's resigned to making defeatist sarcastic 
remarks about everything under the sun, and begging his doctor to inject him 
with something lethal.
Rhyme's former cop colleagues come to him for help: A serial killer is 
deliberately leaving clues, but nobody can decipher them. Our hero does, of 
course, initially object but eventually agree to assist in piecing together 
this puzzle, on the condition that he can work with Amelia Donaghy (Angelina 
Jolie), the young detective who gathered the initial scraps of evidence. He 
likes her attention to detail.
The movie's method is straightforward: Lots of policemen sit around Rhyme's 
apartment and figure out what the killer's latest hints mean; squad cars are 
rushed to the expected crime scenes, and arrive just too late; Rhyme uses a 
walkie-talkie to guide Amelia on how to collect the evidence. She does a lot 
of grimacing at the disgusting situations, and I don't blame her, since she 
has to get stuck into the aftermath of mutilation, flaying, boiling and 
drowning. One guy has bits of his flesh cut out, and is torn apart by rats 
attracted to the blood.
There are preposterous patches throughout all this -- in one scene, for 
example, Amelia is instructed to cut off a victim's hands, to preserve 
physical evidence the killer might have left on them. I am not the first 
person to notice that, using this logic, the corpse might as well be 
decapitated, in case anyone needs to check dental records. This is nothing 
compared to the closing fifteen minutes, in which all dimensions of all 
developments are so absurd that I could write essays on them. Just as 
annoying is the director's overuse of creepy hand-held point-of-view shots, 
which appear in every scene.
The quality of the human presence varies. Ed O'Neill's small role shows he 
could be a good character actor; Washington is forceful and passionate, but 
with subtle undertones of weariness that convince us he really is a cripple, 
rather than an actor lying down and waving his head a lot. Jolie, however, 
who is a good actress, has little to do but stand across from these guys 
while looking tough and responding to their questions.
Conventional and petty criticisms aside, what really disturbs me about this 
flick is how casually it deals with grisly horrors. Today I saw Spike Lee's 
"Summer of Sam", which depicts serial killing with potent realism. Sadly, the 
nonchalant tone of "The Bone Collector" is a clearer reflection of the way 
modern thrillers are headed. I'm glad I do not eat in the cinema -- 
entertainers don't want us to munch on our snacks anymore; they want us to 
puke them up.

`The Bone Collector' is a grisly serial killer retread that aspires to
reach the grotesquely unnerving high that `Seven' achieved with such a
controversial note in 1995. Filled with scalded, dismembered and
rat-covered carcasses, it's not a movie you want to experience right
after dinner. And while there are notable flashes of style and an
effectively dank mood that wafts over the proceedings like a dark cloud,
`The Bone Collector' dissipates into a movie that's more muddled than
frightening.
Study a block of Swiss cheese for awhile and you'll understand the basic
plot structure of `The Bone Collector'. The filmmakers are up to their
elbows in flaws, but they also possess the skill to craft a decent
movie. Early on, we dismiss the plot holes and try and absorb the
impressive style that director Phillip Noyce (`Patriot Games') has
injected. As time passes, however, we lose the ultimate grip on the
storyline. There's no effective movement after the opening half-hour;
the movie is strung together in a rather lethargic fashion by gory
shocks and mysterious clues. While it hits the occasional note of
interest, even perhaps fascination, `The Bone Collector' is a
disappointing effort.
What a good, solid actor Denzel Washington is. In everything from his
Oscar-winning performance in `Glory' to the terrorist thriller `The
Siege', Washington is simply superb. Playing paraplegic police detective
Lincoln Rhyme, the actor once again derives humor and sensitivity from a
character that would be lost at sea without his light touch. Granted,
the performances are not the problem  with `The Bone Collector'.  What
is? The constant utilization of preposterous plot mechanisms and the
lack of a solid spine-tingling mystery is a good place to start.
Detective Rhyme, bed-ridden ever since a near-fatal accident in the line
of duty, is called upon for his intellect to study the evidence in a
gruesome homicide. The killer drives a taxi, and when he picks up a
passenger, it's basically common knowledge that they're not going to
make it to their final destination. Yes, it's another one of those icky
serial killer movies.
After she shows some expertise at a crime scene, Rhyme enlists the help
of patrol officer Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) in the detailed case.
Investigating the aftermath of a bloody murder, Rhyme leads Donaghy
through the darkly lit innards of the New York City sewer system, hoping
to locate evidence and examine the nature of the killing. From the bed
in his apartment, Rhyme can do little more than bark orders toward his
young trainee. Working together, they could solve the identity of the
serial killer - even if the audience has figured it out a great deal
ahead of time.
That's my central grievance with the film. The elusive murderer in `The
Bone Collector' leaves clues behind that are merely genre clichés, and
he continuously manages to elude the entire police force despite their
best efforts. Is the killer incredibly brilliant, or is the police force
incredibly stupid?? The answer is a little of both. Despite such an
unwelcome number of plot holes, the film is darkly effective with it's
establishment of mood and slickly entertaining with it's presentation of
the facts. All of this... until the ill-conceived finale, which reveals
the identity of the murderer in a hammy and unbelievable fashion. It
feels like a cop-out ending that only exists in a cheap `Scream'
knockoff, where the killer reveals his motive in a strictly
connect-the-dots fashion to accommodate the audience. Even Washington
loses concentration, biting his lower lip in an expression that seems to
convey: `Damn. Who wrote this into the script?'
To be fair, both Washington and Jolie are excellent. The remainder of
the cast straddles the line between solid and obvious, with the
exception of Queen Latifah, who delivers a well-rounded performance as
Rhyme's bedside nurse. Michael Rooker plays the disgruntled Captain
Cheney, who wears a dastardly scowl and serves no purpose other than
creating conflict with the lead characters.
It's got certain promise, but `The Bone Collector' has an overbearing
tendency to lose focus. I would recommend `Seven' for a truly
frightening, gut-wrenching experience on a gloomy night. This average
entry is strictly for genre fanatics.

BONE COLLECTOR, THE (director: Phillip Noyce; screenwriters: Jeremy
Iacone/ based on the book by Jeffery Deaver; cinematographer: Deam
Semler; editor: William Hoy; cast: Denzel Washington (Lincoln Rhyme),
Angelina Jolie (Amelia Donaghy), Queen Latifah (Thelma), Michael Rooker
(Capt. Howard Cheney), Mike McGlone (Det. Kenny Solomon), Luis Guzman
(Eddie Ortiz), Leland Orser (Richard Thompson), John Benjamin Hickey
(Dr. Barry Lehman), Ed O'Neill (Det. Paulie Sellitto); Runtime: 118;
Universal Pictures; 1999)
A mild thriller that has the glossy atmospheric look of a riveting
horror film but not the impactful story to pull off this foolish
sadistic killer tale in a reasonable manner, which results in one of the
stupidest endings imaginable. It is a film that is done in the genre's
formula mold, laying on all those mindless gory contrivances that horror
fans have seen before, it is also a tale that has more holes in it than
a New York City junkie.
For entertainment value, the movie forces the audience to look at how
the police collect gruesome evidence at a crime scene, as an
inexperienced policewoman, the former model, Amelia Donaghy (Angelina
Jolie), assists a quadriplegic author and brilliant forensic expert,
Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington), in tracking down a serial killer who
leaves arcane clues for them, as they are led around to New York City's
underground sites, such as turn-of-the-century slaughterhouses and
discarded subway stations. Her job is to be the first at the crime scene
to insure that the evidence isn't trampled by the incompetent police and
the 'pig' who is the police captain (Rooker). She talks with Rhyme by
cell phone, as he leads her through the procedures of collectiving the
evidence at the crime scene, with her bravely going into the dark
passages to locate the victims, where the only light is from her
flashlight.
The catch to this detective film being, that Rhyme can't get out of bed,
that he controls his breathing tube, computer and TV from one click of
his remote-control mouse, yet you know by the conclusion he will get the
demented killer by outsmarting him. She is around to do all the physical
work at the crime scene and to supply the film with a contrasting
character who has a similar emotional problem: both are heroic and have
to overcome something in the past that is blocking them -- in her case,
the memory of her policeman father's suicide.
There is a twinkling of romance in their eyes, but he can't do anything
about it because of his physical condition. The climactic romantic scene
has Amelia caressing his index finger -- which goes for love in this
film. Four years ago, while working a police case, he became crippled
after a beam fell atop him while going down a shaft. He now suffers from
seizures, has a full-time nurse (Latifah) taking care of him, and is
concerned that any of these seizures could reduce him to a vegetable, in
which case he plans to end his life rather than to live that way. We see
him in close-up shots showing off his pearly white teeth while profusely
smiling, acting petulant, displaying a genius for uncovering clues,
while she looks at him with bouts of stubborness in between bouts of
idylic sensual joy. The best part of the movie was the chemistry between
the two. It's just too bad that the film was so manipulative,
dull-witted, spewing bad dialogue as easily as steam that oozes out of a
broken steam pipe, as the whole venture just seemed absurd.
The first murder victim is Mr. Rubin. His hand was found sticking out
from the ground by the train tracks, as the beat cop Amelia was the
first to arrive at the crime scene and did such a marvelous job
collecting evidence, that her reward is to work with the master
criminologist Rhyme, who works out of his home. The second victim is
Mrs. Rubin, who was found later in a different location, scalded to
death while in handcuffs.
When Amelia meets Rhyme for the first time, she says in a self-effacing
manner that she learned what to do at the crime scene by reading his
forensic text while at the Police Academy. Not wanting to be pulled from
her new promotion to work with juveniles on a desk job, she tells him
she wants out. He tells her some dribble about destiny, that destiny is
what you make it -- if it's a gift you have for forensics, don't blow
it. This dialogue is B movie material stuff, and that the stars talk
this talk throughout the film, is a credit to them that they do it with
straight faces. Their faces have star quality written all over it and
even though this role doesn't determine if she can act or not, it does
show that her face, like his, shines like a star, as the movie camera is
very kind to the two of them.
The killer is disguised as a taxi driver, who picks up his victims at
the airport or Grand Central Terminal, locks them in his car and speeds
off into the thin air. There are a series of these killings besides the
Rubins: an N.Y.U. student gets picked up for his cab ride to heaven and
gets devoured by rats, and a father and daughter also go for a deadly
taxi ride, but this time Amelia is getting good at reading the clues,
and she gets to save the girl submerged in the East River before it is
too late.
The film builds up to its hokey conclusion by firstly misleading the
audience who the killer is, then it has the killer confront and attack
Rhyme in a campy way, even biting him like a vampire in the neck. Its
appeal might be that it is so absurd, so lacking in tension and quality
filmmaking, that one might be lulled into its state of languor and
accept it for what it is: another horror movie in a long line of such
films that should be a staple at the drive-in or as a movie rental for
insomniacs who choose not to rent porno to get their cheap thrills.

There has been films in the recent past that have changed us forever. In
example 'Silence of the Lambs' is a classic or the movies, Seven scared up
box-office records and grossed 100m+. Now we have another thriller, one which
by the trailers looked like a scary and great thriller that actually turned out
to be a slow-moving character plotted thriller with holes galore and good
acting. It suffers mostly from it's lack of intensity and trying to make it's
characters stick out more than anything and at times you wonder why even care
about the killer? We have these such strong characters there really is no use
for those other people. Sadly you can't help but compare this
so-called-thriller to 'Kiss The Girls' which has so many strong likenesses that
it may as well be called Kiss The Girls 2: The Bone Collector. 
The plot is very intruiging however: A cop (Denzel Washington) Lincoln Rhyme is
a homicide detective that does forensics on crime scenes. When trying to
investigate the murder of a police officer he is struck by a large piece of
something and crippled. After a series of murders start Amelia Donaghy is
called in to help with the investigation a regular street cop she is, Lincoln
must have her go to the scenes of the crimes and try and figure out what is
happening and what is going on. The killer is a clever one and leaves many
puzzle pieces to say at his crime scenes for the police to figure out what he
is doing. Amelia and Lincoln team up Amelia psychically, Lincoln by radio in
his bed and try to stop this killer before someone else dies....or before they
do.
Even it's clever idea of a movie cannot seem to get it through in this tired,
formulic and muddled thriller that seems more like a piece of trash than it
does of an original or entertaining movie. It does have some high points, it's
homicide scenes are well produced and the setting is also well done. The acting
in the movie isn't terribly above average but Angelina Jolie seems to save it
from being a total bust. The script is well-written with tons of shadowing that
you find out is there at the end naturally in a mystery like this. However
sometimes we see something and are left still after the credits role wondering
what that was or what it had to do with the story.
Some problems with this movie include the fact that all the good parts are in
the trailer for the movie itself which leaves it open to disappointment. The
plot itself is good but at times unbelievable and the movie itself becomes too
conventional and predictable and by the first hour I already guessed the
killer. The ending is another bad thing which to me goes way to fast and isn't
even really that suspenseful. Some of the acting in the movie is pencil thin
with miscasts galore. Michael Rooker as an annoying cop did a great job but was
severely miscast. Second of all I don't think Denzel Washington did what he
could with his role and was a little stale. Ed O'Neil and Angelina Jolie
probably gave the best performances in this two hour movie.
Sadly the film makers on this movie wasted Queen Latifah and it took itself way
too seriously. The Bone Collector disappointed me, from it's good plot line
that was wasted in the process to the ending that is confused, to the boring
parts that seem to go on and on and on. The Bone Collector isn't a horrible
movie, it isn't a good movie, it's just an OK movie that could have been so
much better had it added more suspense and some original ideas. There are
cliches galore along with predictability that you know was or is going to
happen. When you see The Bone Collector I suggest not to be too hyped up. Then
again that's just my opinion.

 The Bone Collector (1999) 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Denzel
Washington, Angelina Jolie, Queen Latifah, Michael Rooker and Luis Guzman.
Directed by Phillip Noyce.
 In "The Bone Collector," the murder mystery is ludicrious, the killer is a
wimp and the finale is preposterous.
 Simple: Denzel Washington and a strong supporting cast.
 Washington plays Lincoln Rhyme, a legendary NYPD forensics expert, now
bed-ridden after a near fatal accident that cost him the use of his arms
and legs.
 Rhyme is a man afraid. His mind works like a precision timepiece, but his
body is failing him. Seizures are growing more violent and any day one
could put him into a permanent vegetative state.
 Rhyme's only wish is to end life on his terms, with dignity.
 But then Rhyme's is given a reason to continue. A series of grisly murders
are being perpetrated by an unknown killer who is leaving cryptic clues at
the crime scenes. The only person who can interpret them is Rhyme.
 The best sequences of "The Bone Collector", directed by Phillip Noyce
("Patriot Games," "Clear and Present Danger") are those set in Rhyme's
apartment where his former forensics team sets up shop to be his arms and
legs.
 Added to this group is Angela Donaghy (Angelina Jolie), a street-smart cop
who comes to Rhyme's attention after she stops a train to prevent it from
rumbling over a crime scene.
 Rhyme believes Donaghy has a natural-born gift for forensics and she
becomes his eyes at the various crime scenes.
 The interplay between Denzel Washington's Rhyme, Jolie's Donaghy and the
various members of the team, most notably character actor Luis Guzman
("Boogie Nights," HBO's "Oz") and Queen Latifah as Rhyme's compassionate
nurse, is the spine of "The Bone Collector."
 Where the movie, based on a best-selling novel by Jeffrey Deaver and
adapted by Jeremy Iacone, is weakest is in dealing with the killings.
 In retrospect they are too intricate, too thorough to have been carried
out by the character finally revealed to be the mad killer. His motivations
are implausible and his final confrontation with Rhyme borders on the
improbable.
 "The Bone Collector" even falls back on the hoariest of cliches, the
villainous explanation. That is when the bad guy has the hero in his
clutches and all he has to do is shoot him. But, no, the villain gloats and
begins giving a long spiel about how smart he is, how he manipulated the
hero and why our hero is reponsible for our killer's murderous rampage.
 Of course, all this does is allow one or more of the hero's compatriots to
arrive on the scene in the nick of time to save him.
 You'd think this device had been used in enough films that the villain
would know better.
 Another inexcusable cliche is the arrogant, self-important, inept police
superior who thinks he is smarter than the hero. Here, he is played by
Michael Rooker, a fine character actor reduced to a shouting, stomping
stereotype.
 Despite these shortcomings, "The Bone Collector" is an enjoyable, albiet
gruesome, excursion. It's a funhouse experience that will offer some goose
bumps.
Washington and Jolie create sparks, and both give potent performances.
 Washington, especially, confined to a bed portrays a man who wants to live
- or die - by his own precepts.
 Just ignore the flimsy finale and savor the first 100 minutes. "The Bone
Collector" won't disappoint.

Written by: Jeffery Deaver (novel), Jeremy Iacone
A dark city, a constant downpour, a serial killer who the cops can't catch, and
a brilliant detective who is the only one capable of finding him. With a tried
and true formula like this, how could a film possibly go wrong? By being
utterly, ridiculously implausible. Another example of how fine acting from the
leads can't save a script this unbelievable.
Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) was once a brilliant detective, but a falling
pipe crushed his spine and his will to live. Despite support from his friends,
Thelma (Queen Latifah) and fellow detective Paulie (Ed O'Neill), he has decided
to end his life before his injury escalates and he becomes a vegetable.
However, Paulie wants his help on one more case, which involves a killer taxi
driver who is leaving clues for the police. Lincoln agrees, but only if young
officer Amelia (Angelina Jolie) will be his eyes and ears by filming crime
scenes and reporting to him.
As I said, the acting here is really quite good, particularly from Denzel
Washington. It's remarkable what a performance he can deliver, despite being
able to move only his head and one finger. Angelina Jolie delivers an adequate
performance, but seems rather miscast. As always, it's a pleasure to see Ed
O'Neill in a film. Being known almost entirely for his role as Al Bundy on
"Married With Children", it's good to see the talented actor trying his hand at
something new. Michael Rooker (Cliffhanger, Tombstone) makes an appearance as
the useless Captain Cheney, whos character seems present only to hassle the
investigators and irritate the audience.
Speaking of implausibilities, how long do you believe a train takes to stop?
Quite a long time, at any rate. According to "The Bone Collector", it takes
maybe 20 yards to come to a complete stop. The scene involves Amelia just
having found a body and a clue which lies on the train tracks. She stands in
front of the train, yelling for it to stop and waving her arms back and forth.
The clue is a piece of paper held down by a bolt. This could very easily have
been moved off the tracks, but this wouldn't have been nearly as tense a scene
I suppose.
Another nice, impossible scene involves Amelia searching for a book which will
reveal the identity of the killer, according to Lincoln. The first store she
looks for this rare book in happens to have it, and she discovers its location
by reaching to the top of a shelf and pulling a pile of books down. The novel
in question lands right on top, turned towards her. As for the identity of the
killer, I guessed it as soon as he appeared on screen; but when his identity is
truly revealed, it comes completely out of left field, so don't even try to
guess his motives.
"The Bone Collector" runs a little too long at 118 minutes. I'd recommend it
only for die-hard fans of either the genre, or Denzel Washington. Even if you
fall under one of these categories, I'd still suggest waiting for video.
