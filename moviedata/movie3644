George A. Romero, the writer/director credited with ushering in the
modern horror film era with 1968's Night of the Living Dead, brings his
latest film to Rochester this Saturday as part of the Dryden Theater's
continuous `Visiting Filmmaker' series. Bruiser, full of Romero's
trademark humor and lower-than-low budget for acting talent, is an
interesting but gimmicky parable that is more remarkable for its
similarity to two recent films than anything else.
Jason Flemyng (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels) plays Henry
Creedlow, an employee of a men's magazine called `Bruiser.' Despite
having a somewhat successful career, a hot wife and a giant, newly
constructed home, Henry is Joe Vanilla  one of those guys you never
notice because he doesn't have a smidgen of character (kind of like the
straight white guys on the last few seasons of The Real World). He's
practically invisible and lacks the backbone to stand up to anybody who
gets in his face or questions his opinions.
And, like anyone who lets people wipe their feet on his back, Henry's
life is full of people who take advantage of him. His wife, Janine,
(Nina Garbiras, The $treet) is unfaithful and keeps her thumb on Henry's
money. His best friend Jimmy (Andrew Tarbet) is a financial advisor who
is robbing Henry blind. Even his housekeeper gets in on the action,
pilfering money from Henry's wallet when she thinks he isn't looking.
And, worst of all, his bigoted, ass-grabbing, cock-waggling boss (Peter
Stormare, Chocolat) belittles Henry in front of his colleagues and seems
a little too familiar with Janine.
We can tell Henry is close to some kind of breaking point from his
homicidal/suicidal fantasies (the highlight of the film) that begin with
his repetitive morning bathroom and workout ritual (like American
Psycho). Waking up to discover his face has become white and featureless
is the last straw, and you know what that means, don't you? No more Mr.
Nice Guy.
Henry spends the rest of the film righting all of the wrongs that he
feels have, literally, stolen his identity. Like Kevin Bacon in Hollow
Man, Henry dons a hat, sunglasses and flesh-colored makeup to walk the
streets unnoticed, leading to the big masquerade party finale, which is
as anticlimactic as most of the film's revenge killings. As an added
bonus, The Misfits play three songs, including one called `Bruiser,'
written for this film, at the over-the-top party climax.
Speaking of over-the-top, that's just what Stormare is in his role. His
accent seems to change from Russian to Irish from line to line, no doubt
distracted by the stress of chewing up the scenery every time the camera
focuses on him. When he gets his at the end, it's a huge letdown,
considering how despicable the character was. Other disappointments
include the failure to use a dangerous table saw as an implement of
destruction, and the fact that Janine's annoying poodle doesn't meet the
grisly fate it deserves.
Other than Stormare and Garbiras, who gets naked a bunch of times, the
rest of the actors are as bland as Henry's character is supposed to be.
But Romero fans will likely be hooting and hollering from the opening
scene, right through the odd cover of A-Ha's `Take on Me' that plays
during the closing credits.
