        Louis (Antoine Hubert) an eight-year-old Parisian boy is
taken by his pregnant mother (who has been deserted by her
husband) to her old girlfriend in the country in Brittany where
the friend can watch her son for the 3 weeks it will probably take
before her new child is born.
        The boy is very reluctant to be left with strangers but he
has no choice.  Along comes Martine (Vanessa Guedj) a 10 1/2-
year-old bombshell of a country girl to take him in hand and
explain everything a young boy should know.  "Like to see a girl's
wee wee?" she asks. "Oui, oui," he replies . . . or should have.
She takes him to a hayloft where they watch her nude sister and
fiance roll in the hay.  "Why does her sister do it?" Louis
wonders, as he listens to her moaning which he interprets as pain?
        As in MY LIFE AS A DOG, AU REVOIR LES ENFANTS,
and HOPE AND GLORY, and many many more, this movie is
 about children growing up, learning about life and having to deal 
with it as each new wonder arises, with the director telling the true
 story as he remembers it.
        Le Grand Chemin will enchant you. Every word the young girl
utters is outrageously funny; her every action (from lifting up her
dress to expose herself to the back of a priest, to her climbing
the church roof to urinate down the drain so that the gargoyle's
mouth spouts the urine onto a passing nun) is hilarious.
        The French, like the italians,  deal with their religion,
nuns, priests, church, God, heaven with humor.   Unlike in the
U.S., they feel that a priest is only a human doing his best in
his chosen field and not an angel sent by a mysterious God.  They
are more up tight about violence than they are about sex.
  Directed by Jean-Louis Hubert, the real-life father of Antoine.
