Rated R (excessive violence, language), 110 minutes, 2000. Dimension. Neve
Campbell, Courtney Cox Arquette, David Arquette, Parker Posey, Patrick Dempsey,
Jenny McCarthy, Scott Foley, Liev Schreiber. Directed by Wes Craven.
There was a lot riding on this movie. Everyone even moderately interested in
the "Scream" series was dying to know how it would end. What would be the
"final act"? This is the end of an era for them, a movie which has kept them up
nights searching for clues on the Internet, talking and tossing around rumors
with their equally enthused buddies, and, for kids under 17, those elaborate
plots consisting of buying a ticket to one movie and hopping into "Scream"
while narrowly escaping those menacing ushers who are only a year or two older
than themselves. No need to worry; "Scream 3" is endlessly inventive and
entertaining, a fine epilogue to the series that made Kevin Williamson a
household name, reinvented the horror genre, and continued in the
self-referential, post-modern tradition of Quentin and co.
So, how does the story go? As opposed to what some fanatical Internet sites
would have you believe, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), now all-grown-up and
constantly dealing with her pass in the constantly tormented sector of her
psyche, is not living in Hollywood fulfilling her dream to become an actress,
but rather in upstate California, living, understandably, alone in the confines
of fences and vast security systems. She works at home as a crisis center
affiliate over the phone. But thatâs not where the movie starts off. Instead,
in a tactic that reminded me of the somewhat similar, and conceptually
horrifying, sequence in "Eye For An Eye" (1995), Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber),
now a big star, drives home to his girlfriend in traffic when the killer calls,
demands the location of Sidneyâs home, and, when he doesnât get it,
threatens the life of Cottonâs girlfriend Christine, and Cotton canât do
anything to stop him. The rest of the sequence is particularly clever, setting
up a constant throughout the picture: the killer has a high-tech electronic
voice-changer that tops that of the first two. Not only does he sound
unmistakably like talented voice-over artist Roger Jackson (ha, ha), he can now
easily duplicate the voices of the lead characters, including Sidney, and the
returned Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox Arquette) and Dewey Riley (David
Arquette).
At the same time, Stab 3, the third film-within-a-film based around the
characters and events of Woodsboro and Windsor College, has taken a less
authentic approach this time around in Return To Woodsboro; whereas the account
of the first two films was true, the franchise within "Scream" has now become
totally fictional. Nevertheless, we learn, Cotton made an appearance in the
movie which is now in production, as himself to be killed off in the first
scene. So, it seems that the real killer is offing our heroes in the order in
which they bite it in the movieâ'either the actor portraying them, or the real
thing. Sometimes both. Clever, indeed. But, who goes next? No one knows. Three
different scripts were penned, weâre told, to keep the true finale off the
Internet (a nod to the "Scream" 2 fiasco a few years back) and no one knows for
sure which one the killer read.
Still, all the while Sidney stays concealed in her home, only visiting dad for
the first half-hour of the film, while also having horrifying visions of her
mother, which takes us back a bit to Sidneyâs fear of becoming what her
mother wasâ'or, at least, what her mother was secretly. When Sidney finally
ventures out to Hollywood as the murders become more prevalent, sheâs chased
onto the set of Stab 3, wandering through "Woodsboro," written and directed as
an odd, surreal, nightmare indeed, this is one of "Scream 3"âs finest
moments.
Okay, over the years, Iâll admit that Iâve become quite the "Scream" fan.
No, I donât have the Ghostface costume or the directorâs cut laserdisc, but
I often find myself compelled to pop in the DVD of either member of the
preceding duo, and can get quite caught up in the dramatic element of these
films (yes, I said "dramatic element"), sometimes debating with family and
friends the possibilities and endless theories that have become
quintessentially affiliated with "Scream".
Throughout the film, though, I noticed a much more subtle approach than the
other two films. Granted that thereâs stabbin-a-plenty going on throughout,
but thereâs considerably less blood, less gore. Honestly, I like this
approach. Itâs more classical, more rebellious, constantly demonstrating the
capable direction of Wes Craven. He knows when to hold back and at the same
time makes the movie ooze with energy, illustrating the delicate poise flowing
from his years of experience. Some critics have noted that "Scream 3" seems to
take itself more seriously this time; maybe so, or maybe screenwriter Ehren
Kruger (Arlington Road), who took over after Williamson had scheduling
conflicts, saw an opportunity for true ironyâ'maybe even a little bit of
satireâ'if the film worked in a few more clichĂŠs.
What puts a damper on this otherwise exceptional and creative film, Iâm
afraid, is the ending, or, rather, the identity of the killer. It does the job,
I guess, accomplishes what it should, bringing the three films full circle, but
upon my first viewing it seemed rather dissatisfying because it appears a
little too contrived, too arbitrary; after a second viewing, which I endeavored
upon due to this recurring disapprobation, the killerâs identity still seems
a little too random, but his motivation came across more sound this time
around, and the eventual conclusion was ultimately more satisfying.
All in all, "Scream 3" does not fall victim to the most lamented principle of a
trilogy: it is not the worst of the films. As a trilogy, "Scream" was a lot of
fun; refreshing, humorous, offbeat. Almost sad to see it go. But then, it does
seem best to quit while youâre ahead, and "Scream 3" does a fine job of
providing closure to its characters. For now, "Scream" holds the title as the
finest series of horror films to be committed to celluloid. Not too shabby.

I know of very few horror trilogies. The "Evil Dead" is the only example I can
think of, though the last entry, "Army of Darkness," was less than stellar. The
nearly parodic original "Scream" certainly never gave the impression that a
sequel was necessary, or a trilogy. Yet "Scream 3" is here, and the surprise is
that it is not bad - a decent if pale reminder of the previous two entries. 
This time, the nearly traumatized heroine Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is
living in a secluded area outside L.A., which makes sense considering she has
escaped the wrath of a ghostface killer in two movies. She has now changed her
name, and works as a woman's crisis operator! She also has visions of her dead
mother walking in the wooded area outside her house (if you recall, Sidney's
mother was killed by her boyfriend in the original). 
But the nightmare is not over as we witness the making of "Stab 3: Return to
Woodsboro," a Hollywood production with a novice film director Roman Bridger
(Scott Foley) at the helm. The ingratiating Parker Posey plays Gale Weathers,
the bitchy reporter. Courteney Cox Arquette returns of course as the real Gale,
seeing her life once again depicted in a movie (as evidenced by the outstanding
success of the first "Stab" film shown in "Scream 2.") I hope this all makes
sense. But somebody is offing all the cast members of the latest production,
and it is up to Gale and witty returnee David Arquette as the bumbling former
cop Dewey, now technical advisor for "Stab 3", to solve the crime and determine
who is the new killer with the cape and Edward Munch mask. Whoever it is has a
fixation on poor Sidney and her dead mother. 
"Scream 3" is the sequel-within-the-sequel parody that almost takes its idea
and turns it on its head, as "Scream 2" did. Unfortunately, the script by
writer Ehren Kruger ("Arlington Road") eschews some of the clever wit and puns
of the first two films, concentrating instead on slicing and dicing methods of
cruelty. In other words, "Scream 3" almost becomes the generic slasher movie
that these movies made a mockery out of in the first place. Frankly, Sidney and
their pals have forgotten how to play by the rules they were so proudly an
authority on. Never run up the stairs as opposed to outside the house and never
say the name of the person you are looking for since they are most likely dead.
Oh, and please never go inside a dark basement and for God's sakes, use a cell
phone when you really need it in a moment of crisis. 
Despite a number of false scares (some did make me jump) and red herrings,
"Scream 3" is fairly okay, at least far superior to "Urban Legend" or "I Know
What You Did Last Summer." There is enough tension throughout and some good
performances, particularly Neve Campbell. She has matured since the original
film, and shows ample strength and humanity - never has a heroine seemed so
sympathetic in any of these slasher flicks. I also enjoyed watching the
Arquettes mingle and throw verbal asides - my favorite is when Gale asks Dewey
about Sidney's phone number and if he has it in his memory. He thinks for a
moment, and then she shouts, "Phone memory!" Independent film starlet Parker
Posey is the big star of the film and she is tremendously fun to watch,
delivering all her lines with ironic gusto. I also enjoyed the scenes where she
spars with Courteney Cox as they investigate the murders and question various
suspects. I did not enjoy the unimaginative, by-the-numbers scenes with Jenny
McCarthy as an actress (are we cringing yet?), Patrick Dempsey as a cop (!) and
Lance Henriksen as a Roger Corman-type producer. The supporting actors playing
the supporting actors of the sequel-within-the-sequel are bland and
forgettable. 
"Scream 3" is a fitting conclusion to a popular movie series that spawned so
many horrible copycats in its wake. From director Wes Craven, who can make
these movies in his sleep, it is markedly better than most other rip-offs. If
only screenwriter Kevin Williamson returned to write this one, it would have
been a real scream, baby.

Scream 3 -- the final cut: slash and learn
The third installment of any horror movie franchise is itself something of a
zombie--a dead thing being forced to walk around, a re-animated corpse, just
shuffling through the motions of life, pretending that the story which
drives it is still vital, isn't just the first installment in a different
setting, with a different cast and better effects. All the same, though,
that third installment can't veer too far from what made the original
successful. It is a franchise by now, after all; there has to recognizable
features, characteristic 'franchise' traits. So it is with Wes Craven's
Scream 3. Here we have Kevin Williamson's glib hip characters, all too aware
of how intertextual their ongoing predicament is yet unable to get out of
it, either. Next there's the trademark Ghostface slasher, who doesn't lumber
around like Jason or change shapes like Freddy, but instead skulks about at
high-speed, gets kicked a lot (a touch of verisimilitude for the doubters),
and--most importantly--doesn't reveal his or her identity until the final
frames, Scooby-Doo style. Thus everyone's a suspect, just as in Scream and
Scream 2 , which fosters a tense, skeptical environment lightened time and
again with comedy. Just when you think you know who the killer is, bam, that
person dies gruesomely, someone makes a good joke about it, and then you're
moving on, trying to deduce Ghostface's identity by elimination, if nothing
else.
This is Sidney's (Nev Campbell) predicament: having to figure out who
Ghostface is. Unlike the first two installments, though, this time she isn't
in a sexually-charged, socio-academic setting, surrounding by friends who
don't yet know they're fodder. Now she's done the Laurie Strode shtick, and
isolated herself--insulated herself--taken an outpost in the woods, where
she can see the bad guys coming from a long ways off (she hopes). The bad
thing is, though, Ghostface saw H2O too, and is doing the Michael Myers
thing, tracking her down, killing people to extract her location.
Specifically, killing all the people involved with the making of "Stab 3,"
the movie-within-the movie which acts as commentary upon Scream 3 itself.
Which is nice, yes, but too, familiar territory for Wes Craven. This is how
he tried to inject new life into the Nightmare series (New Nightmare), after
all, and, though it wasn't quite effective there, it does work here, if for
no other reason than that it allows the Scream-formula to play itself out
element by element, using as its excuse that it's modeled on the movie, and
the movie itself was modeled on that initial event--which, for us, was the
original Scream. Too, having all these sound-stages within sound-stages
allows for some serious walk-ons: Parker Posey, Jenny McCarthy, Lance
Henrikson, Patrick Dempsey, Carrie Fisher, Patrick Warburton (Seinfeld's
Puddy), and, last but not least, Kevin Smith's Silent Bob and Jay. Add to
this the usual suspects--'survivors' Courteney Cox, David Arquette, and Nev
Campbell (as the heroin/e the horror audience is addicted to)--and Scream 3
has quite a retinue, each more killable than the last.
The big question with it, though, is does it still have enough juice, is it
as powerful as the first installment? Because we all know that second, while
decent, kind of lost it at the end, or, rather, when everyone was unmasked,
it became apparent that we couldn't really have guessed it. Which insures
the ending will be a surprise, yes, but does so with obfuscation instead of
misdirection. And misdirection is what made the original Scream so good.
Too, in talking about the third as compared to the first two, you have to
take into account that to both be as original as the original and still
remain 'faithful' to the original is a near-impossible task. That first
Scream fundamentally changed commercial horror, by introducing some
genre-awareness, and that same genre-awareness is what carried the second as
well. All that meta-talk about the conventions of the sequel. Scream 3
continues the tradition, even resuscitating Randy (Jamie Kennedy) on
videotape long enough for him to explain the trilogy they're in, how, as the
trailer says, all bets are off.
And he's rights--the rules of the first two no longer hold. Scream 3 even
goes so far as to hint at the 'real' supernatural (Sid's dead mom), which is
perhaps it's one weak point. Well, one of two. The other is that, though you
can't say for certain who Ghostface is going to be this time, you can
nevertheless intuit who it's going to be in relation to the main characters,
which is as specific as I can be without spilling many beans. That Scream 3
can still have still have beans to spill this late in the game is something
of a feat, though, especially when it's kept itself to a minimum of
contrivance. Most horror-series are just going through the motions by the
third installment, troping around, playing the zombie, which is to say
acting tired. Scream 3, however, shows few signs of fatigue. Maybe even a
little reinvigoration, of all things, in the face of claims that, with the
advent (success) of Blair Witch and Sixth Sense, the tennybopper slasher pic
has run its course, is now making way for more mature horror, more cerebral
horror, horror which reintroduces the supernatural which Scream and Phantoms
disallowed. Lest we forget, though, horror is fundamentally about being
young and scared, the 'safe' thrill of it all. However, if the naysayers are
right, and Scream 3 is the last of its kind for a while, then the slasher
pic couldn't have had a better send-off. Or, rather, send-up, which may have
been Williamson's goal all along: by wearing the generic conventions on its
sleeve throughout the trilogy, the Scream franchise pretty much insured
that--even without Blair Witch and Sixth Sense--it would be the last of its
kind. Any other teenybopper slasher pic which doesn't acknowledge those
conventions and then do something with them will quite simply pale in
comparison (e.g., I Know What You Did Last Summer, etc), be an insult to the
audience of Randys Scream's cultured, who are already three steps ahead and
grinning wide.

Directed by Wes Craven. Screenplay by Kevin Williamson and Ehren Kruger. 
Starring David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox Arquette. Running  
time: 116 minutes. Rated R. Reviewed on February 27th, 2000.
By the mid-Nineties, the slasher movie was all but dead, the heyday of 
the "Friday the Thirteenth" and "Nightmare on Elm Street" franchises just 
a distant memory. Then, in 1996, came "Scream". Perhaps not since "Star 
Wars" has a single film so revolutionized a genre. "Scream" was not just 
funny and scary and inventive, did not just boast an eager young cast. It 
exuded a hip self-awareness which both poked fun at and paid homage to 
its bloody legacy.
"Scream" was followed by a slew of imitators, including a sequel of its 
own. But in addition to some questionable casting choices, "Scream 2" 
(1997) failed by falling into some of the very pitfalls it laughed at, 
hewing too closely to the original.
Now comes "Scream 3", the (allegedly) last of the trilogy. This time 
around, series creator Kevin Williamson decided to draft only a story 
outline, handing script duties over to Ehren Kruger. Fortunately, my 
qualms about how this would affect the film's quality proved unfounded. 
While this final "Scream" doesn't match the original for ingenuity and 
suspense, it is better than "Scream 2", and is a good film in its own right.
In the fictional reality of the "Scream" series, the events of the first 
two films -- the serial killings perpetrated by madmen masquerading as 
"Ghostface" -- have been depicted in a pair of horror movies titled "Stab". 
Despite the lack of further Ghostface murders to latch onto, production 
is under way on the third "Stab" installment. Amongst the cast is 
Jennifer Jolie (Parker Posey), portraying reporter Gale Weathers. Not so 
ironically, Jennifer's boyfriend and bodyguard is Dewey Riley (David 
Arquette), the "real" Gale Weathers' former lover and a survivor of the 
previous murder sprees.
Start-up on "Stab 3", however, has the (unintended?) side effect of 
inciting a new series of Ghostface slayings, and this time the victims 
are "Stab" castmembers. The film is shut down -- to the dismay of hot 
young director Roman Bridger (Scott Foley) -- but the body count 
continues to rise. At a loss, police detective Mark Kincaid (Patrick 
Dempsey) asks the real Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox Arquette) to come to 
Hollywood to assist him. But it soon becomes clear that Ghostface's real 
target is once again Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), living in isolation 
somewhere in California. At the same time, Sidney begins having 
disturbing dreams about her mother Maureen (Linda McCree), the very first 
Ghostface victim.
"Scream 3" shares many similarities with its predecessors, from the 
opening "shock murder" to the utter impossibility of actually guessing  
who Ghostface is this time around. As such, it would be easy to write it 
off as just another clone of the original, and nothing more. But unlike 
"Scream 2", "Scream 3" does things a little differently. In particular, 
Williamson and Kruger take advantage of the Hollywood setting to comment 
not just on the nature of "trilogies" (perhaps realizing that there 
simply isn't much to say: movie trilogies are rare, and horror trilogies 
rarer still) but on thriller filmmaking in general.
The movie is also peppered with cameos which are as hilarious as they are 
unexpected. There are a number of clever in-jokes for the observant: the 
"Stab" actors, for example, are named after the current crop of young  
stars, like Freddie Prinze and Angelina Jolie. And some of the unpopular 
decisions of the previous movies are addressed, as with "Stab" actor 
Tyson Fox (Deon Richmond), whose character Ricky is an intentionally 
transparent replacement for Randy (Jamie Kennedy), killed off in the 
second "Scream"/"Stab" installment.
Returning stars Campbell, Arquette and Cox slip back into their roles 
comfortably. Unlike the first two movies, though, it is the latter pair 
who take the spotlight for much of "Scream 3". They do so ably, hamstrung 
only by a break-up at the start of the film which is never properly 
motivated and comes across as a very obvious plot device. Like any movie 
dominated by young actors, the rest of the cast is uneven. Posey does a 
great job aping Gale Weathers (and hence Cox) and Jenny McCarthy, as 
Sarah Darling, seems to have fun sending up her own public image. But 
Scott Foley is wooden as Roman, seemingly able to sustain only a single 
emotion per scene, and Emily Mortimer, who plays acting ingenue Angelina
Tyler, never really finds her groove.
As usual, "Scream 3" builds up the suspense deftly, weaving the mystery 
of Maureen Prescott's past with the usual Ghostface murders. The deaths 
are, for the most part, satisfactorily inventive (one sequence involving 
a fax machine is particularly fun) and the identities of some victims are 
sure to come as a surprise. It is unfortunate, though, that the movie 
doesn't abide by its own criticism of the genre and repeatedly dumbs 
down its characters to ensure they are in a position to be attacked. This 
is particularly galling when "Scream" veterans like Dewey and Gale start 
splitting up needlessly.
But these things are, in some ways, to be expected; while it would be 
nice to see a horror film rise above such cliches, it is hard to fault 
"Scream 3" for staying true to its roots. More disappointing is the 
movie's "surprise ending", which is not much of a surprise at all to 
anyone with a working knowledge of common literary twists. Indeed, after 
guessing the direction in which "Scream 3" was heading, I found myself 
hoping that I would be completely blindsided, as with the ingenious 
revelation of the second murderer in "Scream".
Alas, it was not to be: the movie ends in a manner which is neither 
without merit nor entirely satisfactory. Walking out of the theatre, I 
found myself pleased with the decision to make this the last "Scream". 
The trilogy has been good (sometimes even great), but I think it has 
played itself out. It's time for the Ghostface costume to go on the shelf 
next to Jason's hockey mask and Freddie's clawed glove, and the screaming 
to end once and for all.

Starring-Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox Arquette, David Arquette,
Patrick Dempsey, Parker Posey, Scott Foley and Jenny McCarthy
Director-Wes Craven
Canadian Rating-14A
Released by Miramax Films - 02/00
All legacies have to end at some point. In the case of `Scream', the
most popular horror movie franchise of all time, I was praying the final
chapter would permit the series to wrap up on a positive note and that
dignity would be maintained. Horror sequels are hazardous waters to be
treading into, and although director Wes Craven was able to pull it off
marvelously with the cheeky follow-up `Scream 2', I was fearing that
`Scream 3' would adhere to the tiredness of formula and that the series
would expire with a sour departure. But, in this particularly rare
instance, all's well that ends well.
The first positive sign in `Scream 3' is that all the primary characters
who survived the original films have returned. The familiar faces of
bloodbaths' past certainly help to establish the cushion-padded comfort
zone that makes this entry so enjoyable. Let's begin with Sidney
Prescott (Neve Campbell), the innocent victim-girl who has been through
dilapidated hell ever since her boyfriend celebrated the one-year
anniversary of her mother's death by going on a knifing rampage. Sid has
left the town of Woodsboro (the original site of the killings) and
changed her name to live incognito. Meanwhile, over in Hollywood,
production on `Stab 3 - Return to Woodsboro' has just commenced. Our
beloved Dewey Riley (David Arquette) has retired from police work and
accepted a job as technical consultant on the film, while level-headed
news-hound Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox Arquette) hosts a second-rate
`Entertainment Tonight' rip-off called `Total Entertainment' and paws
around the set of the latest `Stab' installment, searching for a decent
scoop without authorization. Liev Schreiber also reprises his role as
the wrongly convicted Cotton Weary, having finally found stardom on his
own television program `100% Cotton'.
Enter Ghostface, the masked murderer with a motive. The actors in `Stab
3' begin getting systematically slaughtered in the same order their
characters die in the movie. Unfortunately, to avoid leaks onto the
Internet, three different endings were devised for the film.... meaning
the next victim could depend on which version of the script the killer
read. Everyone is in possible jeopardy - from hot young screen sensation
Jennifer Jolie (Parker Posey), who plays the film version of Gale
Weathers, to Sarah Darling (Jenny McCarthy), who portrays a
fictionalized character named Candy and is probably intended to increase
the audience of adolescent males for `Stab 3'. Of course, everyone is a
suspect. Additional characters include the snoopy Detective Kincaid
(Patrick Dempsey), the millionaire Roger Corman-esque producer John
Milton (Lance Henriksen) and the up-and-coming music video director
Roman Bridger (Scott Foley), who takes the reins of the latest `Stab'
project.
Speaking of taking the reins, screenwriter Ehren Kruger (`Arlington
Road') has inherited the daunting task of replacing the uncanny wit of
former scribe Kevin Williamson in `Scream 3'. This is no easy chore, but
to his credit, Kruger's script contains an ample amount of crisp,
effectively staged frights and character development that remains loyal
to his predecessor. Some of the plot movements are clever and
surprisingly acute. In the department of murder sequences, Kruger
delivers a few real humdingers (one involving a fax machine, another
with a rack of Ghostface costumes and a set of rubber props). But most
of it's just the same old drill: the killer chases down an anorexic
victim, through dark corridors or steep stairwells, and plunges a knife
into their back repeatedly with swift precision. After the tense,
well-executed (but somewhat unexceptional) opening murder sequence, it
becomes gratingly obvious that `Scream 3' will settle for a simple
interpretation of Williamson's work. Fortunately, Kruger is a better
interpreter than most. And whenever the screenplay hits a rough patch,
Wes Craven's nimble direction is there to rescue it. I was frightened by
the film, and all of the creepy atmosphere and unexpected jolts are
courtesy of Mr. Craven's veteran expertise in the field of horror
movies.
`Scream 3' is more generic and conventional than the first two films,
but it has enough tricks up its sleeve to compensate. Cameos abound,
including an appearance by ill-fated `Scream'-er Randy Meeks (Jamie
Kennedy), who appears briefly on a videocassette to explain the Rules of
a Trilogy for our survivors. The scene is so subtly effective and clever
that it makes you wish Randy would return from beyond the grave for an
elongated period of quick-witted comic relief. Luckily, the living cast
members perform just fine. Campbell has never been more convincing as
the sullen `why me, Mr. Ghostface?' victim Sidney. The newlywed
Arquettes don't create the spark they captured in `Scream' and `Scream
2' (no, they have good chemistry - the script doesn't give them much
romantic interaction), but both continue to build their memorable
characters. David, in particular, is phenomenal as the lovable doofus
Dewey. It's the role of his career, and the actor capitalizes on all of
his chances to elevate the character to new heights. Indie queen Parker
Posey (who made a mainstream jump into `You've Got Mail' in 1998) is
wonderfully peppery in her spot-on impression of Gale Weathers, and
Patrick Warbuton (from `Seinfeld') has his moments as her protective lug
of a bodyguard. A few one-liners echo Williamson's self-aware touch,
including a particularly dim-witted character refusing to take a shower
because she's seen `Vertigo'.
The original `Scream' was not a landmark achievement among horror films,
but due largely to it's cleverly caustic screenplay about teens who know
the clichés of the genre, it developed into an unexpected phenomenon.
`Scream 2' was accepted on a more positive note by critics, although
audiences seemed relatively mixed. The third (and reportedly final)
chapter will not disappoint fans of the series. `Scream 3' delivers the
nail-biting goods in such a manner that teeny bopper thrill-seekers will
have trouble arguing. The overwhelming sense of closure during the
climax is a token of gratitude toward all us fans who have been
anticipating this film. Kruger finishes the cycle effectively, tying
certain events back to the original in a fashion that, while not without
plot holes, is more than satisfying. Sure, `Scream 3' occasionally
becomes the movie the first two films were lampooning, but it's executed
with style and compassion.
The audience at my screening seemed to be enjoying the film. They
laughed and they screamed, even if the formula was getting a bit stale.
Sure, the final half-hour, set inside a mansion with trapdoors and
secret passageways, is a bit frenetic. A large portion of the supporting
cast is obviously expendable. And yes, the whodunit is somewhat
underwhelming..... I was expecting a more startling surprise. It may be
the least of the trilogy, but I still had a hell of a time at `Scream
3'. I'll now rest easier knowing that the `Scream' series has been given
a proper burial.

Get excited everybody, we finally got ourselves a really good movie in the
year 2000! It only took a little over a month but SCREAM 3 has arrived,
tagged to a solid storyline, bloodstained action, a great cast, slick
dialogue, an unpredictable ending and cameos all around. If you liked 1 & 2,
you'll scream for numero 3!
PLOT:
Poor l'il Sydney has moved to L.A. and isolated herself from the outside
world. In the meantime, the third movie based on her life, called STAB 3, is
being filmed in and around the Hollywood lots. It isn't until the actual
cast members of the film start getting killed in real life, that Sydney
decides that it's time to come back out into the world and face up to her
past...and a nutjob who goes by the name of ghostface!
CRITIQUE:
The end of this trilogy is a solid hit on all counts with plenty of
suspense, intrigue, bloody murders, big boobies and cool in-jokes to satisfy
any SCREAM fan who had been patiently tolerating all of the lame-brain
wannabees over the past few years. This one kept me and my buddy guessing
about the killer the whole way through, and with typical Craven pinnache,
everyone in the cast seemed to be a suspect at some point or another. Of
course, I won't spoil it for you, but suffice it to say that I was satisfied
with the conclusion, and certainly didn't guess it before it was revealed.
It was definitely a much better finale than the lame one that the sequel had
tossed our way a few years back. The cast in this film was another thumb up,
with everyone involved doing their share to make this film as authentic as
any other. This time around, most of the story seemed to center around the
Cox and Arquette characters, and both actors came through on their
respective counts. In fact, Arquette and Parker Posey are both excellent in
this film, with each one coming up just enough laughs to keep things light
between killings. Jenny McCarthy also clocked in a decent performance
alongside her boobs who delivered their lines perfectly while demonstrating
great versatility and range.
The twists and turns in the film were also well handled and intelligently
written, and will likely leave the proverbial scary movie "that doesn't make
any sense" complaints outside the theater. The big opening scene is just
that...a big opening scene, which lives up to its predecessors and delivers
the bloody goods as always. Overall, I guess I am also kind of glad that
this will be the final one because it is a very good movie, and I would
rather remember this trilogy as just that, instead of it turning into a
tired ol' parody of itself over and over and over again. In fact, that's
probably the only thing that I did hold against this film, and that is the
fact that despite it being an original tale set among actual Hollywood
soundstages, the overall framework of the movie is basically the same.
Ghostface wants to kill Sydney...ghostface kills others who get in the
way...now let's guess who ghostface is. Thankfully, they ended the trilogy
on a real high note with this winner.
And contrary to some initial reports, the violence in this film is still all
there, in fact, I got the impression that this installment had an even
higher body count than either one of its previous incarnations...but don't
quote me on that. The pacing was also solid with a little setup, some
action, some blood, some background story, more action, more murders and so
on and so forth. Pretty neat if you dig that kind of shtuff. The one thing
that is for sure is that you definitely have to be a fan of the first two
movies to truly enjoy this one. In fact, I would suggest re-watching them
both before checking this one out, cause this is definitely a continuation
of the story, and many references to the previous films abound. All in all,
this scary movie is the perfect bookend to the successful trilogy that
jumpstarted the teen horror genre back in the late 90s. It's packed with
murders, humor, suspense, cheap scares, pretty girls, hip dialogue and a
legitimately surprise ending. Sound like something you'd like? Well what are
you waiting for then...get out there and scream your ass off! And what is
your favorite scary movie??
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Okay, so we all know by now that the girl who once appeared in Bruce
Springsteen's 1984 "Dancing in the Dark" video, Courteney Cox, married
SCREAM co-star David Arquette in June of 1999. But did you know that one of
David's earliest big screen roles was as "Benny" in the original BUFFY THE
VAMPIRE SLAYER movie, and that Courteney dated the original BATMAN, Michael
Keaton, for about six years? Courteney is also infamous for having been the
first person to say the word "period" on American TV (it was a Tampax
commercial), and David leads the band Ear 2000, whose single "The Race"
appeared on the SCREAM 2 soundtrack, and whose next single "Click Click"
appears on this film's soundtrack.
Neve Campbell recently admitted to having suffered a "nervous breakdown" at
the tender age of 14, which resulted in complete hairloss. Intensive
acupuncture grew it back.
When actor Patrick Dempsey got married in 1987, he was 21 years old. His
bride was 48.
Jenny McCarthy was Playboy Playmate of the year in 1994. In 1998, she had
her breast implants removed.
Remember when the producer of this film, Kevin Williamson, was the
screenwriting "toast of the town"?
Well, the latest kid on the block is the writer of this flick, Ehren Kruger.
He was the man behind the pen for last year's ARLINGTON ROAD (7/10) and he
also wrote the upcoming Ben Affleck thriller, REINDEER GAMES.
Two of the working titles for this film were SCREAM 3: GHOSTFACE KILLER and
the simpler GHOSTFACE.

Rule number 1: Forget everything about what you think you know. Forget
everything about the past. Because you will discover things that will
make you question your sanity. Rule number 2: Anyone, even the main
character can die! Rule number 3: The killer is bigger, smarter,
meaner and more powerful than you can ever imagine. Prepare yourself
for the most frightening scary movie you have ever seen - your life!
Not many survived 'Scream 2'. Those who have, are now returning to
chance their fate once again in 'Scream 3'. Among them: Gale (the
cynical journalist), Dewie (the good-hearted cop) and of course Sydney
- the innocent victim that bravely vanquishes all her enemies. The
bloody unpleasantness of the past is almost forgotten and everyone is
moving on with their lives. Well, that is everyone - except Sydney,
who lives a solitary life somewhere in the mountains. Meanwhile, in
Hollywood, the producers are wrapping up their latest film (based on a
'true' story by Gale) - 'Stab 3'. Everything is swell, until the cast
members start dying one by one. And so the remaining cast and
survivors must stand together against an invisible enemy that can
mimic all voices...
Tiered of Ws Craven's slashers? Calm yourself, because this is the
final chapter. Just think of it as a final scream. 'Scream 3' gives
Craven the opportunity to play with trilogies. He is almost
successful. The first installment was an entertaining combination. It
was self ironic and at the same time incredibly intense and at times
even frightening. The second one was a total flop that is not worth
mentioning. His latest addition feels like 'Scream 1' with a knife in
its back. It starts fresh and frightening, with amusing irony and
humor, but both the story and suspense die in slow motion, until the
last breath of originality fades away completely. Craven begins well,
and the first half of the film is wonderful. There are surprises,
mysteries and discoveries in every scene. There are some incredibly
amusing guest appearances, such as Jay and Silent Bob (from 'Dogma')
and Geena Davies (Princess Laya from 'Star Wars'). There is a certain
sense of unpredictability. Who will die first? Why? Who is the
mysterious killer(s)? And what is the mysterious darkness in Sydney's
mystical past? Craven is filling the screen with his trademarks, his
light, energetic style, that makes his films incredibly interesting,
almost legendary. Unfortunately it all has to end, and it happens all
too quickly. Already after 50 minutes the film starts to falter. And
by the finale you will discover that Craven has created the exactly
same thing that he tried to parodize. It is unfortunate, because the
opportunities are there. But Craven is too occupied with his famous
original scenes of suspense, that he completely forgets about story
development. So, after the killer is presented in all his mystery, the
characters are inserted into the story and three people have died, the
film turns off the irony and resorts to being simply an entertaining
slasher. The film is as frightening as the first, maybe even more. It
has a much more surrealistic feel to it, as the audience is
experiencing Sydney's paranoiac hallucinations of her past. You can't
trust them. 
'Scream 3' is probably the most professional of 'Scream'-films. It
plays on a much higher technical and visual level than its
'ancestors', which makes it hard to resist Craven's playful
thriller. And though it's not a perfect film that anyone will remember
after a week, it is a worthy, graceful (and hopefully final) addition
to the 'Scream Trilogy'. It is not quite an adrenaline rush, but it
certainly is an elegant, mystic and engaging thriller that will
provide enough thrills, laughs and screams for one evening.

In my review of "The Spy Who Shagged Me," I postulated an unbreakable law of
film physics:  Every time a sequel is as good as or better than the previous
film in the series, it is followed by a third movie that is a bore.  The cause
is probably complacency; a studio sighs with relief when Part 2 lives up to
expectations and figures Part 3 is a sure thing.  "Scream 3" provides the
latest proof of this rule.
In Los Angeles production has begun on "Stab 3:  Return to Woodsboro," the most
recent installment in the series of movies inspired by the murders surrounding
Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell).  However, life soon starts imitating art, and
"Stab" cast members turn up stabbed.  Smelling yet another book deal, Gale
Weathers (Courteney Cox Arquette) comes to the set to investigate and finds her
ex-boyfriend Dewey Riley (David Arquette) acting as a technical consultant and
getting chummy with Jennifer (Parker Posey), the actress playing Gale in "Stab
3."  Elsewhere, our heroine Sidney is living in hiding under an assumed name .
. . until she gets a phone call from a familiar evil voice.
The late Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) makes a surprise guest appearance via
video to explain the rules of a trilogy.  He notes the third chapter in a
trilogy has an overabundance of exposition and a huge backstory to contend
with.  Indeed, "Scream 3" tries to link its murders back to the one that
started it all, the murder of Sidney's mother Maureen before the beginning of
the original "Scream." At the scene of each murder in "Scream 3," the killer
leaves a photo of Sidney's mother Maureen as a teenager in Hollywood and even
includes a note claiming to be her real killer.  To find out who the killer is,
our intrepid investigators have to uncover what happened during Maureen's
missing years when she was a starlet appearing in low-budget horror films. 
(Even with that little information, you can probably already guess what the
killer's relationship to Sidney is).
Unlike its predecessors, "Scream 3" doesn't have the guts to even suggest that
the central characters might be the killer.  The characters we do suspect are
all undeveloped, so that by the end we don't even care who the killer is.  The
jaded detective (Patrick Dempsey)?  The kinky producer (Lance Henriksen)?  The
driven young director (Scott Foley)?  The ingenue (Emily Mortimer)?  The
character who turns out to be the killer seems to be selected at random.  Wes
Craven supposedly filmed three different endings to keep the real one a secret,
so it's quite possible the one in the final cut was randomly chosen.  
The series' trademark references to other horror films have become trite and
obvious.  Possibly it's the absence of screenwriter Kevin Williamson, who
penned the first two, or maybe it's that the hip ironic stance eventually
consumes itself and a series that parodies film cliches eventually becomes a
cliche.  I groaned as an attack on Sidney from the first "Scream" was repeated
moment-for-moment in the Hollywood set of her home.  At some point, referencing
becomes just a means to cover up a poverty of new ideas.
"Scream 3" also continues the tradition of having an eclectic set of cameos and
familiar faces in small roles.  Look for Jenny McCarthy, Carrie Fisher, Patrick
Warburton (Puddy from "Seinfeld"), Roger Corman, and Jason Mewes and Kevin
Smith (as Jay and Silent Bob) to walk through at some point.  All these bit
players put forth more effort than the series' returning stars, who are
probably saving their energy for the long post-"Scream" job search.
Another prediction I made in a previous review has come to pass:  more movies
are copying "The Blair Witch Project"'s web strategy.  "Scream 3" has three
official websites that (wink, wink) pretend that the events of the movie are
real and provide additional backstory information not covered in the movie. 
The Sunrise Studios site (scream3.com) has trailers for other Sunrise releases
as well as the "latest 'Stab 3' news."  There's also a Gail Weathers official
site (galeweathers.com) and a Sunrise Sucks site that has more "Stab" scandals
the studio wants to cover up (sunrisesucks.com).
Craven and company promise that this is the last installment in the "Scream"
series.  While I hope that's true, I don't hold out much hope-horror movie
series are even harder to kill than their monsters.  There's a "Halloween H2K"
in the works, even though Michael Myers was beheaded in "H20," and a "Freddy
vs. Jason" has been talked about for awhile, despite the fact that both
characters were "killed off."  There's bound to be a "Scream 4" someday, even
if it starts over with a new set of movie-star wannabes.
Bottom Line:  They should have called this one "Yawn."

   Liev Schreiber, a survivor of the two opening films of the
"Scream" trilogy, introduces us to the final episode of Wes
Craven's series of slice-and-dice films in the only engrossing
minutes of this closure-rendering offering.  When you realize
that this talented performer has been starring as the title
character of William Shakespeare's "Hamlet" at New York's
Public Theatre, you may think: "Scream 3" is about as
comprehensible to the average Joe as "Hamlet" would be to
a guy who had never heard of Shakespeare or read any of
his plays.  In a convoluted plot that might make a modicum of
sense to those who have seen its pair of predecessors,
"Scream 3" posits a killer whose identity--disclosed in the
movie's penultimate scene as a wholly arbitrary choice that
no one in the audience would have guessed--has been
Miramax Films' reason for banning online reviewers in most
of the country from advance screenings.  To quote co-
producer Marianne Maddalena as recorded in an issue of the
San Jose Mercury, ``I can tell you this was no publicity ploy,''
insists Maddalena. ``We're afraid of the power of the Internet.
That's where Miramax's fear comes from. They were just
trying to keep the ending a surprise. They didn't want to spoil
it for the fans.''  A big thumbs-up to Maddalena for her
honesty.  But since the munchkin could have been virtually
anyone in the cast, what difference would it make if people
knew the identity in advance? (Besides, what would have
prevented an Internet critic from seeing the movie at its
commercial opening on February 4 at 11 a.m. and posting a
revelatory review by 3 p.m. before the vast majority of
weekend moviegoers went to their favorite theaters?)
   Horrormeister Wes Craven seems to have run out of
chilling ideas and should have quit while he was ahead.  His
1996 opener to the triple-play combo, which begins after the
mother of Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is murdered,
highlights an obsessed murderer who slaughters teens in a
small city, all of whom were known by the slain mom. 
Craven parlayed his knack for portraying well-drawn
characters into "Scream 2," which opens during Sidney's
college days as the movie "Stab"--based on the string of
murders shown in "Scream"--is to be released.  The killings
continue with the usual shish-ke-bobbing of victims and the
customary winks and nods and self-referential material. 
"Scream 3" locates in Hollywood.
   One bright concept of "Scream 3" is that while the first
two victims die in the same order that they are wasted in the
movie within the movie, "Stab 3," the killer keeps the cast on
their collective toes because no one can be sure of who the
third victim would be.  Again, the Internet comes into play, as
art follows life: Just as Miramax kept most online critics out of
the screening rooms, "Stab 3" is so coy about revealing the
killer's name to any cybergeeks who might disclose the info
on the 'net that the writer made up three separate versions. 
The murderer could have read any one of those three.
  Many of the same characters are back in the final episode,
with Neve Campbell in a more understated role as the central
object of the killer's fantasies.  She plays the girl most likely
to be killed for reasons known only to the assassin--until the
moment of truth near the conclusion of the film.  The
mustachioed David Arquette returns in the role of the
vulnerable cop, Dewey, while Courteney Cox Arquette
performs as Gale Weathers, the object of his affection.
(Dewey should see either a psychoanalyst or an optometrist.)
Some others serve as suspects in the minds of the audience,
including Lance Henriksen as aging movie producer John
Milton, Scott Foley as the young director Roman, and
Patrick Dempsey as the hirsute detective Mark Kincaid, who
flirtatiously and unsuccessfully petitions Sidney to call him 
by his first name.  
   The banal and redundant plot is not improved much by the
silly dialogue, but writer Ehren Kruger dazzles with just one
snappy one-liner.  Carrie Fisher as Bianca complains that
she was considered for the role of Princess Leia in the
original "Star Wars," but that the role went to Carrie Fisher
(the one who slept with George Lucas).  
   Despite the word on the grapevine that this movie would
break from the usual conventions of the genre, the obligatory
false alarms still scare the cast far more than the audience
and the good guys are at risk of failure just at the point of
nailing the killer (and the killer at the point of nailing the good
guys) because they talk too much instead of checking on
whether their intended victims are really dead.  For the most
part, the characters are unlikable, generic, and bland despite
their occasional off-the-wall acting--at which Parker Posey
excels.
   Don't be too disillusioned.  Try to see Parker Posey in the
indies for which she was created such as "House of Yes,"
"Suburbia," and "The Daytrippers;" Liev Schreiber (easily the
most interesting performer in "Scream 3") in "A Walk on the
Moon;" and David Arquette in one of the real gems of 1998
that nobody saw, "The Alarmist."
Rated R.  Running Time: 116 minutes.  (C) 2000

(This review makes a conscious attempt to avoid spoiling any surprises
contained within the film.)
One of the best jokes of Scream 2 was that the "movie" version of the "real"
events of the previous film was a typical, exploitational slasher flick.  It
served as a subtle reminder of the level this genre usually plays out at: a
stupid naked girl takes a shower and gets cut up.  The first two installments
in the Scream trilogy distinguished themselves as funny, smart and tense
thrillers.  Now the final (they swear) Scream has opened in theaters and while
it doesn't match the quality of the first two it still works as a slickly
crafted piece of entertainment, and plays out at a level far above the vast
majority of its genre predecessors.
The series has always done a nice job of developing its key characters as more
than one dimensional victims, survivors or potential killers.  The returning
characters have varied, believable, reactions to the infamous events of the
first two films.
Heroine Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is now a paranoid prisoner in her
isolated home, working over the phone as a women's crisis councilor.  Bitchy
tabloid reporter Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox Arquette) has risen to anchor
level on an entertainment news show (just missing out on a job with 60 Minutes
II).  Sweet natured Dewey Riley (David Arquette) has relocated and found a new
girlfriend, both logical representations of his true feelings.  Cotton Weary
(Liev Schreiber), who at one point was wrongly imprisoned for the murder of
Sidney's mother, now has his own talk show: 100% Cotton.
Production has begun on "Stab 3," the latest in those successful exploitation
films mentioned earlier.  When members of the cast start turning up dead it
becomes obvious there's another killer on the loose.
Around for the ride to arouse suspicions and increase the body count are
Jennifer Jolie (Parker Posey) who is playing Gale in the film and has her
bitchy persona nailed, flaky ingenue Angelina Tyler (Emily Mortimer) who won a
nation wide talent search for the new Sidney, rising heartthrob Tom Prinze
(Matt Keesler) who improbably landed the role of Dewey, aging starlet Sarah
Darling (Jenny McCarthy) dissatisfied with her lack of screen time and
abundance of on screen nudity, and wisecracking Tyson (Deon Richmond) searching
for a way to stand out from the singer/actors who he competes for roles with.
There's also the young hot shot music video director Roman Bridger (Scott
Foley) making his feature helming debut, an aging, hack, producer John Milton
(Lance Henrickson), and local detective Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey) assigned to
the case.
Among the large ensemble there are two notable standouts.  Posey's caustic line
delivery and offbeat screen personality make her character one of the best of
the series.  This is some of Posey's best work yet, and certainly her best in a
mainstream film.  Her chemistry with Cox is priceless, as she constantly finds
new ways to show up her "real life" counterpart.  As the series' heroine
Campbell has continued her blossoming as a genuine talent and she carries this
film with the greatest of ease.
McCarthy, Foley and Schreiber all have nice moments while Kelly Rutherford and
Patrick Warburton bring everything required for their brief roles.  There are
several surprise cameos, some work (a veteran producer/director and a teenaged
actress are both very well cast) and some don't.  Arquette and off-screen wife
Cox have their best moments opposite Posey.  They play their characters well
but don't expose any previously unseen layers.
This is likely due in part to the notably underwhelming script from Ehren
Kruger.  The first two films helped make a star of screenwriter Kevin
Williamson (nearly unheard of for a writer) but he returns for this film only
with producer and story credit.  His absence is often felt, such as in an early
dialogue scene between four "Stab 3" cast members.  A lot of the material feels
more like one of the Scream rip-offs than the real deal.
Still, the film meets the basic requirement of any good thriller: a memorably
tense sequence or two.  Scream 3's stand out is a freaky visit Sidney makes to
an on set replica of the house that originally set the stage for much of
Scream's bloodshed.  As with any other good installment of a series, the film
has a lot of fun in referencing what has come before it.  There's also an
increased degree of psychological torture, as the killer plays mind games with
Sidney involving her dead mother.
Just as Scream 2 was filled with self reflexive material about sequels, Scream
3 involves discussion of film trilogies.  Unfortunately, promises made here
only serve to make the climax even less interesting.  Instead of wrapping
things up in a clever, or at least believable, way the revelations of final
scenes are simply random.  However the very last scene ends the series on an
appropriate tone (if still failing to shut the door on any further
installments).
The talents of the cast and crew work to keep the film at a level entertaining
enough for series fans and anyone who can handle a film where most of the cast
will end up brutally murdered. Director Craven can turn out this stuff in his
sleep now.  The technical credits are polished with the production design
especially standing out.  Major exception is Marco Beltrami's often irritating
and intrusive score.

In general, I've always hated the horror genre.  I do
not like films where the primary engine of
entertainment involves the spillage of gallons of
blood and where characters are brainless morons who
more or less deserve to meet the fate of having a
knife plunged through their backs.  But I found a new
respect for the genre when I saw the first `Scream.' 
It was an inventive whodunit/slasher flick that was
unexpectedly clever and truly frightening (and made my
Top 10 for that year).  `Scream 2' also managed to
establish a nice pace and a fair amount of tension. 
Alas, `Scream 3' is succumbing to what all horror
sequels begin to suffer.  And that's a lack of
creativity.
`Scream 3' takes place in Hollywood where filming of
`Stab 3: Return to Woodsboro' is underway.  Woodsboro,
as you may recall, is the sleepy town where the
stabbings first took place.  A new series of murders
begins to unfold.  The victims are cast members of
`Stab 3' and at each murder scene the killer points
out that Sidney Prescott (recurring heroine Neve
Campbell) will be an eventual victim.  Also reprising
their roles are David Arquette as the meek Dewey Riley
and Courtney Cox Arquette as the self-absorbed,
story-hungry reporter, Gale Weathers.  Dewey is a
technical advisor on the set of `Stab 3' having lived
through the Woodsboro events himself.  Gale shows up
after having heard about the murders.
As with the first two `Scream' movies, a couple of
trademark elements are carried forth to this
installment.  The first element is the explanation of
the rules of the game, and this is my favorite scene. 
Delivered posthumously on videotape by Randy Meeks
(Jamie Kennedy), a victim back in Woodsboro, he
explains that Sidney is caught up in a trilogy.
Secrets will be uncovered and in the end and only
Sidney or the killer will survive (I'm hoping that
he's also telling us that there won't be a Scream 4').
 The Whodunit element is also a fun aspect.  The
audience continually tries to guess whom the killer
is.  Is it the police detective who seems to have an
obsession with the Woodsboro murders?  Is it a
low-life producer who seems to be hiding something? 
Is it one of the `Stab 3' cast members taking their
role too seriously?  Just when you think you know who
it might be, you'll discover that you were wrong. 
And, of course, there's the multitude of `BOO!'
moments.  Dark buildings, creaking doors, spooky music
and that all-too-haunting ghost mask can just be
unsettling at times. 
These are the elements that made the `Scream' movies
hip and witty.  But `Scream 3' has lost a little of
its edge.  And it's not really the fault of the
scriptwriter or any of the cast members.  This film
just suffers from a been-there-done-that' kind of
feeling.  Even the looks on the actors' faces seem a
bit tired and worn.  Another problem was that the
characters were not as lovable as the ones from the
other `Scream' movies.  When they died (like Randy), I
cared.  Here, a couple of annoying characters
derserved to be stabbed.   Also, the killer who
finally reveals him/herself is totally arbitrary,
resulting in a very weak payoff, unlike the first two
installments.  `Scream' is still levels above than the
odious `I Know What You Did Last Summer' series.  And
I give director/creator Wes Craven a lot of credit for
reinventing the horror genre.  However, it's time to
put this baby to rest.

Miramax "disinvited" on-line media from press screenings of Scream 3.
They ostensibly feared that folks like me would write spoiler-filled
reviews and post them prior to the film's February 4th release
date-unsound reasoning. You see, 'net critics established enough to be
on any sort of VIP list are professionals-Miramax surely knows the
difference between a member of The On-Line Film Critics Society (OFCS)
and the type of fanboy who posts spy reports at Ain't It Cool News. No,
the mini major' was afraid we'd let a bigger cat out of the bag than
whodunit, that Scream 3 is a dismal conclusion to the beloved (by this
writer, at least) franchise.
Something smells rotten in the state of California right from the
get-go: Cotton Weary (Liev Schrieber), the former lover and would-be
killer of Maureen Prescott, Sidney's mother, is juggling phone calls in
his luxury car. (Once considered a danger to society, Weary now hosts
his own talk show, "100% Cotton", a clever, if dated, jab at American
pop culture.) Of course, a new Ghostface dials him up, and, with
memories of Scream's unbearably suspenseful prologue in mind, we
immediately wonder, Where is the killer? The backseat? The next car?
Thrilling prospects, to be sure, but actually, Ghostface is at the Weary
residence, waiting for Cotton's girlfriend (Kelly Rutheford) to
finishing showering. What's missing from this sequence, and indeed
Scream 3's remaining frights (most disappointingly, the moment when an
ingenue is forced to hide in a wardrobe room filled with Ghostface
costumes, one of which might spring to life), is an elaborate and
attenuated payoff.
Our other surviving regulars have become estranged. Sidney (Campbell) is
living a paranoid existence of electronic gates and password-protected
locks, while Dewey (Arquette) acts as technical advisor on the second
sequel to Scream 2's movie-within-a-movie, "Stab 3", and Gale Weathers
(Cox Arquette) headlines a gossipy news program. Murder reunites them,
as knife-wielding Ghostface stalks the set of "Stab 3", imitating its
sadistic screenplay-and his/her/their own personal draft climaxes with
Sidney's death.
The appeal of Ghostface's villainy is that he/she/they could be your
boyfriend, your classmate, your next door neighbour...or a combination
of people. Scream was the first of its kind: a slasher mystery, with the
guessing game not only entailing who will be next, but also who is/are
the perpetrator(s) and what is/are his/her/their motive. Ironic
self-reflection aside, parts one and two stand out in a crowd that
includes umpteen Friday the 13th and Halloween flicks because there's at
last articulate human beings behind the iconic costume. With Scream 3,
the novelty of Ghostface's ever-mutating identity has worn off some, but
the character remains conceptually potent.
Conceptually. The execution of Ghostface's master plan this time around
is creaky, because screenwriter Ehren Kruger has invented a new
mythology for the world of Sidney Prescott far afield from what we'd
come to understand in Scream and Scream 2. The movie gets in the silly
habit of saying "All bets are off!" in reference to the "rules" of a
trilogy's third act, but there's a difference between rule breaking and
cheating. With the departure of Kevin Williamson, who authored the
previous Screams as well as a tidy outline for Scream 3 (that, for
reasons incomprehensible to me, was ignored, save the notion of "Stab
3"), Kruger needed to be reined in tighter, and by Wes Craven.
Craven's direction of Scream 3 is lazy in most respects. How else to
explain the Jay and Silent Bob cameo (the slacker duo of Kevin Smith
movies), akin to seeing Mickey Mouse pop up in Mulan and more
distracting than funny. It pains me to write this, but Scream 3's comedy
is generally laughless, with the exception of well-timed performances by
Josh Pais (as a police detective possessed of the same personality he
had as a persnickety teacher in Craven's Music of the Heart), Jamie
Kennedy (resurrecting film geek Randy for the sendoff he was denied in
Scream 2), and Parker Posey (through sheer force of will as a
B-actress).
The visuals are much weaker in part three, as well-the occasional
sweeping gesture of Peter Deming's camera is a pale imitation of the
stalking Steadicam Craven gave us twice before. (Aside: in the wake of
Columbine, Craven toned down the violence significantly for Scream 3-why
the sanctimony, when  Scream and Scream 2 are still readily available on
video store shelves?) Finally, Marco Beltrami's music cues the suspense
too blatantly-do you recall the tense chase at the college radio station
in Scream 2? It's mostly silent. Sting notes are a whole lot more
effective if they spring from nowhere; here, they act as the crescendos
of an incessantly nerve-jangling score.
I look at Scream 3 as coming from an alternative universe, the same
place that birthed The Godfather Part III and Superman III-woefully out
of synch with its prequels, Scream 3 is a nightmare instead of
nightmarish, and will likely put the horror genre back in mothballs. The
film unintentionally follows the unspoken rule of a trilogy to a T:
part three must disappoint'.

I'm assuming that anyone who has read this far is familiar with the
series, so I'll keep the plot description to a minimum. Set mostly in
Hollywood, "Scream 3" continues the movie-within-a-movie conceit, as
production of "Stab 3" comes screeching to a halt when a killer, dressed
in the familiar ghost mask and black cowl, appears on the scene. In
short order, all of our old favorite characters, along with a host of
new ones, are scrambling to stay alive and unmask Ghost Face once and
for all.
The character dynamics have significantly changed along the way. Where
central target Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) was once the focal point
of the action, she now plays second banana to Deputy Dewey Riley and
cutthroat TV tabloid reporter Gale Weathers, played by the recently
married David Arquette and Courteney Cox Arquette. Although "Scream 2"
ended with Dewey and Gale as honey-bunnies, this storyline has the
couple estranged again, thereby allowing the Tom and Roseanne of the
21st century to bicker a lot before their relationship heats up again.
While Dewey and Gale play junior detective on the "Stab 3" set, Sidney
is holed up far, far away in a high-security mountain cabin, counseling
abused women via a series of high-security phone lines. When she learns
of Ghost Face's Tinseltown Tour 2000, she leaves her sanctuary and
reluctantly heads for Los Angeles (incidentally, reluctantly is the only
way anyone should ever head for Los Angeles).
Fine. The veterans are in place, newcomers are running around all over
the set and the killer is slashing away. So what are we dealing with
here? Kevin Williamson, who became white hot thanks to his dandy script
for the original "Scream," was too busy to write the finale (he
reportedly was trying to salvage his wretched TV series, the aptly named
"Wasteland"), leaving flavor-of-the-month Ehren Kruger ("Arlington
Road," "Reindeer Games") to fill in, with mixed results.
One of the high points is his pairing of Gale Weathers with Jennifer
Jolie (Parker Posey), the actress playing Gale in "Stab 3." The
combination of a hyperactive, manipulative reporter and a ditzy starlet
determined to copy her every move is inspired, and Posey is a riot. The
only thing that hampers their scenes is the alarming physical appearance
of Courteney Cox Arquette. With her increasingly gaunt features (please,
somebody feed this woman!) and godawful Cleopatra-with-hacked-bangs
hairdo, she looks scarier than Ghost Face.
While going lighter on the pop culture references than Williamson,
Kruger does get in some good ones. In addition to the pointed
one-liners, check the closing credits for the character names of the
"Stab 3" players, which can be taken as a nod, or a swipe, at a gaggle
of popular young actors.
Director Wes Craven has some fine moments as well. His composition work
is exceptional, particularly in a haunting shot where Sidney emerges
from a studio hallway and the camera slowly pulls away as she finds
herself on a movie set recreating a street scene straight out of her
personal nightmares. Throughout the film, Craven uses lights and darks
masterfully, and his positioning of music to heighten tension is far
more effective than in most films of the genre.
Had he only paid as much attention to the script. In climatic scenes,
Sidney, Dewey and Gale abandon the very survival rules their characters
supposedly learned in the first two films. Even more damaging to "Scream
3" is the simple passage of time. Since the series burst on the scene in
1996, other artists have upped the humor-meets-horror ante. On any given
week, shows like the outstanding "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" mix chills
and giggles as adroitly as anything in "Scream," while creating
characters with considerably more substance. Regardless, though "Scream
3" represents a franchise running on fumes, there's still enough gas in
this old buggy for a moderately entertaining final ride.

As _Scream_ was still raking in the dough at the box office in early
1997, its first sequel was rushed into production, seeing the inside of
moviehouses by December of that year.  Despite its quickie slasher sequel
nature, _Scream_2_ hardly felt like a rush job; it had all the genuine
scares and--crucially--the sharp, self-effacing wit that distinguished
the original film.  Conversely, a little over two years separate the
release of _S2_ and the arrival of the horror franchise's third and final
installment, but despite the longer lead time, _Scream_3_ feels like it
was sloppily slapped together--a pale, watered-down shadow of what had
been a clever and highly enjoyable franchise.
The drop in quality is undoubtedly a result of the absence of writer
Kevin Williamson, whose funny and genuinely scary scripts for the first
two films were every bit as, if not more, responsible for their success
as the taut direction of Wes Craven, who is back on board for _S3_. 
Craven has had enough triumphs in the genre to justify his reputation as
a master of horror, but his rather uneven body of work
(_Vampire_in_Brooklyn_, anyone?) proves that his filmmaking skill cannot
overcome a lacking script--and that's exactly what new _Scream_writer
Ehren Kruger has provided _Scream_3_.
The diminished luster of this go-round is suggested the film's opening. 
Like the first two films, the Hollywood-set _S3_ begins with a killing. 
Following in the footsteps of name brand actresses Drew Barrymore and
Jada Pinkett Smith as the sacrificial starlet?  Kelly Rutherford, best
known as doormat ex-hooker Megan during the forgettable final seasons of
_Melrose_Place_.  Her character's murder is but the first to be linked
with the production of _Stab_3:_Return_to_Woodsboro_, the latest
installment of the horror series inspired by the events that took place
in the first two _Scream_s.  Of course, the murder springs
ever-inquisitive TV news reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox Arquette),
whose books inspired the first two _Stab_ movies, into action. 
Naturally, her investigation leads to a run-in and reluctant reteaming
with ex-flame (yes, they once again broke up between films) and former
Woodsboro police deputy Dewey Riley (David Arquette)--who, as it happens,
is working on _Stab_3_ as a technical consultant.
So where does this leave our long-suffering heroine, Sidney Prescott
(Neve Campbell)?  Contrary to what had been reported by some media
outlets, _S3_ does _not_ have Sidney settled in Tinseltown and actively
pursuing a career in acting; instead, she is quite understandably living
in quiet seclusion in Northern California, working out of her home under
a false name as a phone-in crisis counselor.  It goes without saying that
the ghost-masked killer's antics eventually force Sidney down to SoCal
and the scenes of the crimes, but what is surprising is how long she is
left on the sidelines.  With so little given to do, it's almost
understandable that Campbell phones in her performance.
Campbell isn't the only _Scream_3_ principal who appears less than
interested.  The newlywed Arquettes' performances also have a been-there,
done-that air about them; their characters' increased time in the
spotlight does not equate with fresh directions for them.  (I take that
back--vain glamourpuss Gale's new wrinkle is her inexplicably dowdy
appearance.)  Then again, Kruger fails to take the _Scream_ franchise
itself in any new directions.  Although the hyper-reflexive,
inside-Hollywood premise opens up even more possibilities for
self-parody, the satirical in-jokes disappear within a half hour.  (The
mid-film exception is the brief return, by way of videotape, of film geek
and _S2_ victim Randy Meeks, played with usual--and sorely missed--spark
by Jamie Kennedy.)  For the most part--aside from a laugh or two provided
by Parker Posey, quite amusing as the bitchy actress who plays Gale in
the _Stab_ films--_Scream_3_, while never boring, isn't all that funny,
nor is it all that scary.  No "suspense" scene comes close to touching
the first _Scream_'s stunner of an opening or _Scream_2_'s nailbiting car
escape scene.  It's quite telling that the one scene in _Scream_3_ that
is remotely spooky is the only one that survived from Williamson's
original outline for the film: Sidney wanders onto the _Stab_3_ set, and
she is confronted with the spitting image of her former home--which, in
turn, brings to mind all the ghosts of her past.
To be fair, Craven's work here feels watered down itself.  In an
apparent reaction to the Columbine murders, the violence and gore is
significantly toned down; there's nothing in _S3_ that comes close to the
bloodbath that closed the first film.  While the amount of blood is not
necessarily proportional to the amount of excitement generated, in
putting a damper on the violence, Craven seems to have also put a damper
on his reckless, anything-for-a-scare abandon.  He appears to be walking
on eggshells throughout the entire film, making extra sure that he
doesn't so much as nudge the envelope.  With Craven always holding
himself in check, it's little wonder that many of the intended shocks
don't.
During the course of _Scream_3_, it is mentioned more than once that in
the final act of a trilogy, all bets are off.  The suggestion is that all
the previously set rules will be broken, and that any surprising twist
and turn is possible.  _Scream_3_ indeed boasts a big twist, but the
dismaying turn has nothing to do with the story: the film turns the
franchise into the type of conventional slasher saga that the first two
films so effectively lampooned.

 Normally, as a critic, we are exempt from the cost of seeing a movie.
Normally, we get in for absolute zero when we attend a press screener of
a film.  However, since Dimension, for what appear to be highly
mysterious (and controversial) reasons, cancelled the screener of Scream
3 I had to pay.
 I saw this film in a theatre with about 700 other people, and the place
was full to overflowing.  Watching Scream 3 was reminiscent of watching
a full-blown cult screening of The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  People
were dressed in full Mr. Ghost Face regalia (albeit without the knife),
and the audience clapped, cheered, jeered, and chanted at practically
every moment of the film.
 To imagine the theatre I was in, imagine the theatre in the first ten
minutes of Scream 2, remove the homicide, and multiply by ten.
 In a lot of ways, seeing the movie in such a setting is probably for
the best: I would have felt like such a silly ass loudly rooting for the
killer in front of the rest of Cleveland's press contingent.  My
generation was raised on slasher flicks: they're our genre and our
domain, and seeing Scream 3 with people of my generation was a
refreshing switch from eating Thai food at the Ceder Lee cinemas with
the rest of the critics.
 Of course, it wasn't just the overwhelmingly `this is campy, and I like
it'-atmosphere that made me enjoy the film Scream 3 wasn't half-bad
either.
 Seeing as Dimension has already handed down their edict up on high from
the Greenwich Village thrones of Bob and Harvey Weinstein that no one
shall tell the details of Scream 3, and since I don't want them to have
an excuse to bar the Internet critics from their next
the-NSA-couldn't-break-this project, I will not tell you much.  What I
will tell you is this.
 Mr. Ghost Face is at it again.  I obviously won't tell you who Mr.
Ghost Face is, only that he has had a few upgrades.  One, he can imitate
people's voices (this is revealed within the first scene), and two, this
guy packs a second knife (not revealed until later, but I thought you
should know).  This time he's killing the cast of Stab 3 in the order in
which they die in the movie.
 Only one problem.  Stab 3 and Scream 3 have comparable security levels,
so Stab 3 has multiple drafts of the script so that no one quite knows
who is going to be next.  Of course, Mr. Ghost Face is going after
whoever is left from the original cast (by now we have whittled it down
to Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Liev Schreiber, and Neve Campbell)
while he is at it.
 By far the campiest of the Scream trilogy, Scream 3 is undeniably fun.
It isn't even structured so that it is guilty pleasure.  It is
structured so that it is following the rules of a sequel, not a trilogy,
and thus everything is much more elaborately planned.  The pace is
quicker, the jokes are funnier, the IQ of the movie drops by at least 20
points.
 Scream 3 chooses as the target of its insults not the horror genre but
the Hollywood system.  Stab 3's cast is wonderfully postmodern (each
person corresponds to a member of the surviving original cast), but
plays its insults to actors, actresses, directors, and producers instead
of to serial killers, shower scenes, axe murderers, and chesty victims.
 Ehren Kruger is able to step into the voice of Kevin Williamson without
missing a beat, but is sadly not quite able to pull off a script without
plot holes.  The biggest thing that Scream 3 has going against it is the
plethora of plot holes that exist in this film.
 In the end of Scream 3, when all is said and done, you are left with
the feeling that you have just roasted marshmallows, made out in a
drive-in, skinny-dipped in the lake, and done all of the other things
that are both incredibly youthful and asking for it should you happen to
find yourself in a serial-killer situation.  The film is youthful.  The
film is Gen-X.  But above all, it's fun, and it doesn't ever pretend to
be anything more.

In "Scream", director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson created a film 
which was a brilliant blend of horror and self mocking comedy. In "Scream 2", 
the same writer, director team made a film which, while not quite as 
enjoyable as the first, blended the two genres as it joyfully poked fun at 
sequels. With "Scream 3", Wes Craven was given the chance to have fun with 
trilogies. The problem is, Williamson wasn't on board this time and was 
replaced by Ehren Kruger ("Arlington Road"). Williamson is sorely missed. 
While all the old characters are back, Sidney (Neve Campbell), Dopey Dewey 
(David Arquette), and Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) don't seem to be having 
too much fun anymore. The truth of the matter is, I can't blame them. The 
Scream films have turned into the exact thing they were trying to satirize.
The ghost masked killer is back, and he/she is desperately seeking Sidney 
(sorry, couldn't help myself). However, Sidney has gone into hiding out in 
the woods, fearful of yet another killer coming after her. Meanwhile, Stab 3, 
the movie in a movie of the Woodsburough murders, is being filmed. The film's 
cast is becoming worried that the killer may start after them rather than of 
their real life counterparts. Dewey and Gale team up with homicide detective, 
Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey), and attempt to find the killer before he strikes 
again (and again, and again). Tossed into the mix are Stab 3's director, 
Roman Bridger (Scott Foley), the film's producer, John Milton (Lance 
Henriksen), Stab's entire cast, and, somehow, Sidney's dead mother, Maureen 
(I believe played by Priscilla Pointer).
One of the trademarks of the Scream films has been to kill two characters off 
at the very beginning of the film. I personally believe this is a bad idea. 
This makes for an incredibly predictable first ten minutes or so. In "Scream 
2" we may have received this predictable intro, but at least the remainder of 
the film was somewhat surprising. In "Scream 3", an easily forseen film 
follows this intro. One of the other major failings in "Scream 3", as opposed 
to the previous two films, is the lack of any real humor. We all might 
chuckle at Dewey's stupidity at times, but it's not the same. The reason is 
obvious, and for those of you that haven't seen "Scream 2", I advise you not 
to read this next sentence. With the departure of Randy (Jamie Kennedy), all 
the humor has been sapped out of the film. We are no longer granted hilarious 
little monologues about the faults of horror movies or, at times, of movies 
in general.
Despite all this, "Scream 3" does have its moments. Randy does make a brief 
appearance of sorts, which is quite amusing, but promises things the movie 
fails to deliver. Also, watch for a cameo by two characters from another film 
series which comes completely out of left field. It's also nice to see Dewey 
and Gale again, as the two will occasionally indulge in some very funny 
dialogue. However, Sidney has rather worn out her welcome. She's no longer 
the strong character that she was in the previous two films. She now hides 
away from her troubles half the time, and simply appears tired of the entire 
situation the other half (who can blame her?).
I suppose I could go on listing faults all day, but what exactly is the 
point? Nearly every teenager on the planet is going to see this film, despite 
what I say. Perhaps they'll see something in it that I didn't. One more thing 
I simply must note: indie film favorite, Parker Posey ("Coneheads", "The 
House of Yes") is absolutely wasted in the role of the actress playing Gale 
Weathers in Stab 3. Parker is a delightful actress, but she is allowed to do 
nothing here other than follow Gale about, making idiotic and annoying 
comments about how she would have done things differently. "Scream 3" runs 
far too long at 116 minutes. I don't think you'll be able to sleep because 
someone is constantly screaming (imagine that) throughout the film. I'd 
recommend it to fans of really cheesy "b" horror films, but to no one else. I 
give it a generous two and a half out of five stars.

The character Neve Campbell plays in "Scream 3" has been so badly shaken in 
the first two movies that she now lives in Monterey with a reclusive 
anonymous lifestyle. When she finally drives to California to join in with 
the rest of the action, she's quieter, thoughtful and more authoritative. 
Watching this makes us realise what great potential Campbell has for 
performing in serious drama. I kept fantasising about writing a great 
screenplay for her, to showcase her captivating presence and win her 
international acclaim.
It's not just time for Neve to move on, though, but everyone involved. When 
the original "Scream" was released in 1996, it was a stunning comic idea -- a 
film with the structure of a slasher pic in which the characters knew all the 
clichés and had self-referential conversations about them. Unfortunately, the 
idea was copied, and quickly became a cliché in itself. Now almost every 
American movie starring kids under 20 is filled with smug, cynical allusions 
to pop culture that just make us groan and yawn.
Given that its options are limited and it's the third trek over the same 
ground, "Scream 3" does a pretty good job of engaging us. The filmmakers have 
announced that it's the last in the series, and while I'm not about to 
complain, at least their latest work is watchable. It comes up with a pretty 
ingenious way of generating more jokes, in fact, by setting its story in 
Hollywood, and featuring the production of a movie called "Stab 3". A horror 
movie, wouldn't you know it, based on characters from the first two "Scream" 
pictures.
This gives the director, Wes Craven, and his screenwriter, Ehren Kruger, the 
freedom to blur the line between what's going on in the 'reality' of the 
story and the world of movies. The plot involves another mystery about who is 
perpetrating a murderous rampage, and at this point in the trilogy we've been 
introduced to so many characters with so many conflicting personality traits 
that there is indeed a fair amount of suspense about the identity of the 
killer. In the end, Craven and Kruger come up with an unpredictable and 
arbitrary solution, but hey, at least we're not bored, as we were in "Scream 
2". That sequel made a bad mistake in thinking it was a real horror movie, 
and ditching the humour.
"Scream 3" is generally easy to watch, with colourful, sexy visuals, and 
although its form of parody is becoming old hat, there is enough successful 
ironic chatter to get us giggling. As I've suggested, it's better than 
"Scream 2". But somehow it doesn't work well enough to recommend. The idea 
has been stretched too far. They should have made one movie, and called it 
quits.
My biggest concern is that a lot of the violence is excessive for a 
lighthearted flick. Every time a knife is pulled out, for example, there is a 
disgusting metallic 'zing!' on the sound track, and a bright gleam on the 
screen. People get slaughtered in cruel, not amusing, ways. Unnecessary. Sick.

"Scream 3" Review
by Fontaine Lien
(Obviously, you shouldn't read this if you don't want to know whodunit.)
You gotta give Wes Craven, Kevin Williamson and co. credit for coming
up with the supposed end to a trilogy that was, while definitely not
as ingenious and surprising as the first installment, satisfying and
unexpectedly GOOD for a sequel.  Yes, when it comes to the end of a
trilogy, all bets are off, and the biggest anomaly of "Scream 3" is
perhaps that it, well, didn't suck.
If seen purely as a stand-alone film, "Scream 3" leaves much to be
desired; but as the movie keeps telling us over and over again, it's
not meant to be seen as just another movie.  It's the conclusion to a
trilogy.  It's "Scream" . . . its third time over.  It would be unfair
to judge the film without keeping this fact in mind.  Already, when
"Scream 2" appeared in theaters, many fans and critics felt the
haunting effects of the Munch mask diminish.  The sequel seemed to
develop its story much the same way the original had.  The same goes
for "Scream 3": the formula that went from "Scream" to "Scream 2"
appears again (although in hindsight, "Scream 2" was much more
formulaic); the upside?  Much of the first two films' tongue-in-cheek
humor, in jokes, and genuine slasher fun was retained.  I'm glad that
this is the last; I'm surprised the writers were able to stretch the
original plot so far and give it a completely new twist.  They're
testing the limits here.  Another sequel, and I'm afraid they'll reach
the boundaries of our willingness to suspend disbelief.
Once again, the setting is set in a movie inside a movie, much like
"Scream 2." Hmmm, I wonder if the set "Sunrise Studios" used for "Stab
3" was reconstructed from the original "Scream" set?  Lots of the fun
comes from the jokes and in jokes about Hollywood (Jennifer Aniston,
anyone?), and much of the intrigue comes from, yep, the unreality
within reality.  Munch (henceforward my term for the masked and
identity as yet unrevealed killer) and Sidney (Neve Campbell)
reconstruct the chase from "Scream"; it's reality, but at the same
time it isn't -- Sidney opens a door only to find herself in the
middle of the air.  It's not Woodsboro, but Hollywood Woodsboro.  The
Scream movies have always been as much about parodying and paying
tribute to the industry, especially the horror film genre, as they
were about scaring us.  Think of "Scream 3" as the biggest laugh of
them all.  "Scream" threw in a movie geek and self- conscious
references to the genre; "Scream 2" put cinema and "reality" side by
side; "Scream 3" takes all these elements, juxtaposes, superimposes,
and turns things completely around on us.  In the end, the killer
doesn't have superhuman powers after all as the rules predict; in the
Wes Craven tradition he is a member of the family gone awry, a bad
seed.  Roman (Scott Foley) wanted to direct his life's own movie, but
he was unconscious that it was but a mockery of modern horror films,
where villains never survive.  I must admit, they kept me guessing on
this one.  Was it Sid who, finally driven to the edge of insanity,
went on a killing spree in a fit of schizophrenic madness?  Was it
Sid's father?  Was it Detective Kincaid, with a morbid fascination for
Hollywood?  Or was it Milton, the man who knew the most about Maureen
Prescott's mysterious past?  I liked the element of unpredictability
in the trilogy's final installment, even if at the end my reaction was
equal amazement and incredulity.
I liked how Craven kept doing what he did best in the previous films:
keeping things scary while adding a dash of Hollywood make believe
here and there.  I was amused by the guest appearances: Lance "Frank
Black" Henriksen unwisely cast as a sleazy Hollywood producer (come on
guys, the man exudes authority and intelligence), Carrie Fisher, chick
from "Now and Again" and "Welcome to the Dollhouse," and Jamie Kennedy
as our beloved video store film expert Randy.  Campbell, Arquette,
and, well, Arquette all return as our favorite heroes, while Scott
Foley plays a decidedly un-Noel like character with surprising
success.  The actors who portrayed the actors in "Stab 3" were also
smart in playing the characters as caricatures of, well, themselves.
I loved the frantic pace of the chases, even though we pretty much
know the formula already: dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, Sidney saves
the day.  Craven's direction kept things interesting.  No, the Munch
mask isn't as scary anymore, but it was well compensated by atmosphere
(empty sets, replicas of murder scenes), direction, and movement.  And
even though we could tell to a certain degree that some characters
were doomed, the when and how kept us in suspense.
As I've said, I think this is the limit the writers can go without
making things look ludicrous.  They'll be hard-pressed to come up with
something that'll explain THIS next time.  The killer was a bit TOO
superhuman this time.  Even with the two of em in "Scream" the killer
couldn't get from point A to point B so quickly and effortlessly.  I
also could have done without the hokey "come to mother" ghost scares.
So as much as I love being scared, I say let's keep the case closed on
Sidney Prescott.
* What's up with that trailer, "Ready to Rumble"?  Rose McGowan as David
Arquette's love interest?  Sorry, but I still think of them as brother
and sister after "Scream." Ew.
* Seems they can't get enough of that ubiquitous Nick Cave song.

In 1996, screenwriter Kevin Williamson and director Wes Craven created 
"Scream," a low-budget slasher film that revitalized the horror genre, due to 
its innovative approach of having the characters be "in-the-know" about the 
conventions of movies concerning killers hacking away at nubile victims, so 
when a psycho really does begin to dispatch of the teenage residents in the 
town, they know how they should handle it. But even more than that, "Scream" 
was the very first horror movie in a long time that was actually smart, 
scary, and genuinely suspenseful, a twist on the "stalk-and-slash" films from 
the late-'70s/early-'80s. The $14-million picture ultimately went on to gross 
$103-million, a whopping number that is virtually unheard of for this type of 
movie. 
But lightning struck twice, as "Scream 2," with most of the same cast and 
crew, was released exactly one year later, in 1997, and set new box-office 
records on opening weekend. The $25-million sequel ended its cume at 
$101-million, but while making virtually the same amount as its predecessor, 
the film left audiences divided, with some saying it was actually superior, 
while leaving others a little disappointed. My opinion fits somewhere in the 
middle--while "Scream 2" didn't even come close to the level of ingenuity 
that the first one had set, and was more than a little sloppy, looking as if 
it had hurriedly been thrown together (with 11 months, 3 weeks separating 
their releases, it was), it still had enough of its token wit and intensity 
to be a satisfying venture. 
Over two more years have passed, but the (supposed) final film in the 
financially and creatively successful trilogy, "Scream 3," has arrived, and 
to say it was well worth the wait would be an understatement. Despite the 
disappearance of Williamson in the screenplay credit (Ehren Kruger was handed 
the writing reins), Craven has remained faithful as the top-notch filmmaker 
of the series, as have ongoing stars Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox Arquette, 
David Arquette, and Liev Schreiber. And, in its own way, "Scream 3" is a 
groundbreaking motion picture itself--a second sequel that has somehow 
accomplished the daunting task of being every bit as fresh and thoroughly 
gratifying as the now-classic film that started it all. The hanging story 
threads from the previous ones are brought to the forefront, as the natural 
evolution of the characters, as well as the series itself, skillfully comes 
around full circle.
It has been several years since the bloodbath that occurred at Windsor 
College, and Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) now lives in a secluded, rural, 
Californian home, working from her house as a crisis hotline counselor under 
a false name. Unable to lead a regular life anymore, and plagued with 
nightmares of her deceased mother, Maureen, Sidney is distraught to find that 
one of the people from her past has been murdered (seen in the token opening 
death scene) in Hollywood, where "Stab 3: Return to Woodsboro" is well 
underway in its production on a studio backlot. Determined cutthroat news 
reporter Gale Weathers, who now hosts a television show called "Total 
Entertainment" after her brief gig on "60 Minutes II" fell through, is 
contacted by Detective Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey) to join him in his 
investigation of the multiple murders. Illegally getting onto the set of the 
film, Gale has a surprise run-in with Dewey Riley (David Arquette), recently 
retired from the police force due to his handicap, and currently an advisor 
for the movie. Although they briefly had a relationship with each other after 
the goings-on in Part 2, their varied personalities have since broken them 
up, but it is obvious the spark between them is still very much alive.
One of the elements that is so ingenious in "Scream 3," however, is in its 
movie-within-a-movie approach (there is a stunning, showstopping sequence in 
which Sidney finds her way to the sets from the production, which are the 
spitting image of real places in her hometown of Woodsboro), and in the way 
the mystery killer--once again dressed in that spooky Ghostface 
costume--kills off the characters, which is by the order in which they are 
whacked in "Stab 3." Adding confusion to the mix, (1) three different 
versions of the screenplay were created, in order to throw off Internet fans, 
but it is unclear which one the killer has gotten ahold of; and (2) with the 
real Gale, Sidney, and Dewey, as well as their three actor counterparts, in 
Hollywood together, will the killer want to get rid of the real people, the 
performers portraying them, or both?
Whereas any old second sequel to a slasher franchise would be more than 
showing its age by now, "Scream 3" is that rare case in which it is not 
merely here to cash in on the big bucks, but was all along planned as a 
trilogy. One could possibly question if this is actually true, or just an 
excuse by the filmmakers once the original struck paydirt, but "Scream 3" 
does a fabulous job of wrapping things up and filling in the missing pieces, 
all the while delivering what fans have grown accustomed to--scares, snappy 
dialogue, believable characters, and some sort of unique spin on the 
otherwise cliched formula. While "Scream 2" was the most straightforward of 
the series, in terms of its violence and occasionally messy plot 
developments, "Scream 3," like its 1996 precursor, is a multi-layered 
funhouse of chills that does a more-than-sufficient job of keeping the 
surprising twists coming, and the final unveiling of the killer is not only 
unanticipated, but the details for his/her motive come off as more plausible 
than they have any right to be.
Aside from the aforementioned scene where Sidney stumbles upon the movie sets 
and, subsequently, is chased by the killer as she relives her past, there is 
a clearly innovative and exciting sequence coming every ten to fifteen 
minutes. The 35-minute climax, set in an eerie mansion, complete with secret 
passageways and dark corridors, is literally non-stop in its intensity, and 
in the perverse fun Craven, Kruger, and the gang are obviously having. 
Moreover, the in-jokes about moviemaking and Hollywood are occasionally 
satirical and often biting, with a few people turning up in enjoyable cameos. 
Neve Campbell, fresh-faced and well-cast in "Scream," has done nothing but 
develop into an even more talented actress with clear star qualities within 
the last three-and-a-half years. Wisely choosing to downplay the sullen 
Sidney from the middle chapter, her character is now a young woman stuck in a 
rut in her life, filled with understandable paranoia that she can never be 
safe until she has completely disappeared from the rest of the world. The 
progression Sidney goes through is both touching and truthful, and Campbell 
is able to surpass her performances in both of the other pictures.
Courteney Cox Arquette, now married to co-star David Arquette, are both up to 
par with their consistently entertaining turns as Gale and Dewey. Of the 
three central characters in the series, it is Gale who has gone through the 
most changes. Starting off as a fairly heartless wench in "Scream," Gale was 
still very much ruthless in "Scream 2," but her sweet relationship with Dewey 
humanized her character into a slightly warmer individual. In the latest 
addition, Gale has finally learned there is more to life than just getting a 
juicy story, and helping out the police in the investigation of the 
increasing death toll, and rekindling her romance with Dewey, are now the two 
things most important to her.
A wide array of new faces are introduced, as usual, and the actors all have 
great fun. The highlight is easily Parker Posey, as Jennifer Jolie, a vapid, 
relatively ditzy actress who has been cast in the Gale Weathers role, and 
takes pride in portraying the character even better than Gale herself. Posey 
is a comic delight, as usual, and she single-handedly steals almost all of 
the scenes she is in. Relatedly, there is a very funny rapport that develops 
between Jennifer and Gale, who are stuck together like glue through the 
second half. When it is Gale who is to die next in the script, Jennifer 
figures that if they are always side-by-side, the killer will just attack 
Gale and leave her alone.
Also in a memorable appearance is Jenny McCarthy, as Sarah Darling, an aging 
35-year-old starlet tired of always being cast as teenagers and especially 
angered that her character in "Stab 3" only appears in two scenes and then is 
killed off (Guess which real actress appears in only two scenes in "Scream 3" 
and is killed off?). Rounding out the cast is Patrick Dempsey, nice to see 
after a sizable absence from the spotlight, as Detective Kincaid; Scott 
Foley, big-headed and appropriately pretentious, as "Stab 3" director Roman 
Bridger; Emily Mortimer as Angelina Tyler (Sidney in "Stab 3"); the 
always-beguiling Matt Keeslar as Tom Prinze (Dewey in "Stab 3"); and Lance 
Henriksen as Sunrise Studios producer John Milton (who may or may not have 
known Maureen Prescott years before). Also showing up is Liev Schreiber, the 
fourth returnee from the other "Scream" movies, as Cotton Weary.
In the director's chair, Wes Craven has somehow been able to keep the energy 
level as high as possible in "Scream 3," as if it was the first movie he has 
directed in the series. This being his third go-round, in retrospect, may 
actually be nothing but a positive thing, as Craven has treaded similar 
horror territory so many times in the past that he could do it in his sleep. 
What cannot be denied is that Craven is a master at setting up absorbing 
horror set-pieces, and no matter what, is constantly adding a stylish flare 
to the proceedings. 
With the wholeheartedly satisfying conclusion of "Scream 3," perhaps the most 
widely popular horror movie series of all time has come to a close. The way 
each of the surviving characters' lives receive closure is an excellent 
touch, and the final few shots are filled with subtle, yet remarkable power. 
Who would have guessed that the ending of a film called "Scream 3" could be 
so poignant? Certainly not I, but it is. Now how's that for an unexpected 
twist?

Starring Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox Arquette , David Arquette, Parker Posey,
Emily Mortimer, Jenny McCarthy, Patrick Dempsey, Scott Foley, Deon Richmond,
Lance Henriksen, Matt Keeslar, Patrick Warburton, and Liev Schreiber.
Back in 1996, director Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson teamed up
to create the witty and original Scream, a scary movie that simultaneously
derided the cliches of other scary movies. Four years later, a third Scream has
been released, except this time without the wit, originality, or Williamson.
What once was at the top of its class now has become what it was so good at
mocking: a pointless, violent slasher-flick. The surviving members of the first
two films find themselves being stalked again in the middle of Hollywood, where
Stab 3 is being shot, a fictional sequel to the Woodsboro Murders.  But the
question is who's committing the crimes and why?
There is no doubt that Scream 3 is a truly scary film, the numerous scenes in
which the ghost-faced killer stabs his (or her!) innocent victims were all very
intense and well paced. To be honest, this certainly is one of the scariest
movies of the 1990'sbut was the aim to just make a scary movie or to prove a
point in the process? Unlike the original Scream, and more like the second
Scream, the movie only completes half of its goal. The humor, ardently
attempted, just does not work (maybe because the previous movies killed off the
funniest characters or maybe because new screenwriter Ehren Kruger just isn't a
funny guy, we will never know). Some potentially clever cameos and a number of
entertainment references were not completely developed and most of the jokes
were just flat-out unfunny. The best part of the film is when Randy (Jamie
Kennedy), who unfortunately does not survive the second film, leaves on
videotape, the rules of a trilogy. This brief ten- minute section only reminds
us how great the first film was at using other movies' clichés to tell its own
jokes. Randy mentions more movies and stereotypes in his small appearance then
the rest of the characters in the whole film combined.  
Another fault in the script is the disastrous last ten minutes, which nearly
ruin the whole movie. I spent the whole time trying to figure out who the
killer was by carefully observing facial expressions and discovering hidden
clues, only to find out that there is absolutely zero evidence and an
unconvincing motive for this random "surprise" of a killer. They could have
picked anyone else and I would have been satisfied, anyone at all.  The
discovery of the person behind the ghost-faced mask also leaves numerous plot
holes that are never answered. Scream 3, supposedly the act in the trilogy that
answers any questions and fixes any mistakes, left me more confused than any of
the past films. 
Remember when Scream was about a couple of guys hanging around a video store,
with nothing to do except talk about the movies? It was so simple, yet so
perfect.

The "Scream" series comes to a close (hopefully) with this installment not 
really starring Neve Campbell.
Courtney Cox and David Arquette are the real stars here as the story takes 
them to Hollywood where a
killer is dressed up in that same black costume murdering people, only this 
time he follows a movie script. 
The premise offers a lot of possibilities but the execution of the story is 
mediocre. What's supposed to be
funny and satirical is only good for the occasional gaffaw but not too many 
belly laughs or sly zingers the
original "Scream" offered. In fact it's not really accurate to classify this 
film as a horror, there's really
nothing scary about it. It's more of a lame action/thriller since there 
doesn't seem to be anything remotely
supernatural. 
Teenyboppers will love it, but the rest of us will just have to accept the 
fact this franchise ran out of steam
fast.

Yawn.  Wes Craven's SCREAM series, famous for spoofing the teen slasher
genre, has now with SCREAM 3 completely degenerated into the type of
movie that the series was setup to spoof.  Without a creative idea in
sight, Ehren Kruger's script falls back on tired, blood-splattered
gorefest clichés.  Written at the level of a lame sitcom, the movie
produces barely a chuckle.
Set against the backdrop of the production of a fictional movie called
STAB 3, the plot has few surprising twists.  Basically the cast gets
hacked to death, one by one, until few people are left standing.  The
film has a large cast with talent to burn, including David Arquette,
Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, Patrick Dempsey, Scott Foley, Lance
Henriksen, Matthew Keeslar, Jenny McCarthy and Emily Mortimer.
None of these show any spark in their acting, save indie queen Parker
Posey, who plays her usual character of a smart-mouthed woman with an
attitude.  By actually trying, she steals every scene in which she
appears.  Likewise, cameos, including those of Carrie Fisher and Liev
Schreiber, are much more interesting than the rest of the blandly boring
picture.
"Break the rules!" Gale (Courteney Cox) advises at one point in the
story.  "Stop at nothing!  Be ready to have the world hate you!"  The
speech obviously refers to the SCREAM series itself.  It's too bad that
SCREAM 3 never takes its own advice.  Remarkably devoid of edge, the
movie just spends two hours running out the clock.
The studio only permitted print critics to see this film in advance.
Online film critics had their invitations canceled at the last minute.
(Since all of the print media have Web sites, the differentiation is
obviously silly.)  The fear was that we might reveal the film's ending a
whole day or two in advance of the film's opening.
As a protest, I am going to reveal the conclusion right here and now:
Frogs.  Yes, that's right.  The movie ends with a shower of biblical
proportions as thousands of frogs rain down from the heavens, falling on
the characters' heads.  Okay, so maybe it doesn't end quite that way,
but you'll wish it did.  The only scary part in the movie is that it
clearly opens the door for a SCREAM 4.  Please nooooo!
SCREAM runs 1:56.  The film is rated R for strong horror violence and
language and would be acceptable for most teenagers.

http://www.moviereviews.org/scream_3.htm ---
The best part of Scream 3 is Jenny McCarthy in a ditsy
Hollywood-actress role that is humorous to both the uneducated
movie-going rookie and the seasoned Hitchcock fan (there are
references to his work throughout the film that the trained eye should
have a relatively easy time catching). Then, within 15 minutes of the
movie starting she.d'oh! It's okay though, because the second best
part of the movie is good old Liev Schreiber. Then, before the opening
credits even get started his character.d'oh! The third best thing?
Well, I'll have to think about it.
Obviously, the film is a teenage slasher flick. Not only do respected
actors and attractive Playmates get butchered, but a head roles, a
fire engulfs and some other victims have their last supper Benihana
style. The production, which actually prides itself in being and
spoofing a cliche-filled horror flick also uses flickering candle
light, bullet-proof vests, nightmares and, who could forget, a finale
in the dark.
Those of you not already acquainted with Scream and Scream 2 will
likely find little more than confusion in the third and final
installment which neglects to thoroughly lay out its
background. Basically, a third Stab movie is being made based on our
protagonist, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and the rest of the
gang's frightening adventures a few years back. Someone involved in
making the movie decides it is time to butcher Sidney and Co., but,
for artistic reasons of course, chooses to do it in the order that
they are terminated in the script. From there, it is all chaos,
scream, blood and (a?)  masked murderer. Confused? Then you either
need to take a couple of trips to Blockbuster or, more wisely, forget
that this movie even exists.
Since the film does enjoy its status as a popcorn horror flick, many
jokes are cracked at the genre. Just as in Scream 2, the rules of
engagement are explained by an expert on sequels and trilogies- never
mind that he died in the last movie. Hardcore fans of the Scream trio
anticipate this scene as some sort of a holy grail. That is all fine
and good, but, unlike in the previous works, our expert proves to be
wrong.
Horror junkies who are familiar with Hitchcock will find some nicely
tucked away jokes throughout Scream 3. Similarly, those familiar with
the underground success of Silent Bob and Jay will be pleasantly
surprised to see them cameo even though Kevin Smith isn't involved
with this movie.
Although the aforementioned cinema tidbits are stashed away throughout
the work, don't expect to find any deep meaning or social commentary
in your excavations. The movie does attempt to touch on family ties
and the psychology of a homicidal maniac, but things get just about as
deep as the knife in Jenny McCarthy's throat.
The movie also has some more minor faults that hardly help its case. A
fine example is when star Courtney Cox's hair grows about 16 inches in
three minutes. It is also interesting that obvious victims are always
abandoned by their bodyguards or the police right before they either
answer a scary phone call or meet their destiny.
The third best thing? Hmm. I got it! The establishing shot of the
movie: the famous Hollywood sign. Maybe that is some sort of
foreshadowing.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
There are two well-known film trilogies: The Godfather and the original
Star Wars series.  In both of these examples, the first installments
were fluke, out-of-left-field success stories that actually got better
with the second film before grinding to a halt with a lesser-acclaimed
third and final picture.  By the way, there are no spoilers here, so
don't be afraid to keep reading.
Forget all of that when it comes to Scream.  The only reason I bring it
up is irony - the Scream series called The Godfather, Part II the only
sequel that was better than the original.  Also, there was that scene
where the video store clerk and the convenience store employee decide
that The Empire Strikes Back was the best of the Star Wars films  wait;
that was Clerks.  It's tough to keep this stuff straight, especially
when Jay, Silent Bob and Princess Leia all have cameos in Scream 3.
While Scream 3 lacks the obvious bite of creator Kevin Williamson's
acidic pen, it's still better than the second film.  What is sacrificed
in terms of witty banter and keen pop culture references is made up for,
pound-for-pound, in genuine fright.  The film should keep most of the
audience on the edge of their seats, with hands intermittently clutching
chests, covering eyes and, if you're the type to try to figure out the
ending, scratching heads.  Scream 3 offers enough red herrings to gag
Hitchcock.  Hey, even Hitch gets a mention in the film, with one
particularly dimwitted character refusing to take a shower because she's
`seen Vertigo.'
The story for Scream 3 is set up around the production of Stab 3: Return
to Woodsboro, the third film in a series that has starred Tori Spelling,
Heather Graham, Luke Wilson and David Schwimmer (although he's never
seen; just referred to).  The whole idea of the movie within the movie
was pretty cool the first time but seemed in danger of being ground into
the dirt here (and what happened to Stab 2, anyway?).  But it's actually
handled pretty well, thanks to some good casting and scene settings.
Imagine the poor sap that wanders into the Sunrise Studios dark prop
room, where there's dozens of those creepy masks, flowing black robes
and pointy knives.
After the well-done opening murder scene, we begin to see the performers
in Stab 3 bumped off in the order their characters die in the script.
At the same time, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell, Three to Tango) starts
to have visions of her dead mother Maureen, which ties in nicely with
the murders because the killer is leaving old photographs of Mrs.
Prescott at each of the slaughter scenes.
Sidney, now a crisis counselor, has moved away from Woodsboro to
distance herself from the murders (and movies about the murders).  Other
holdovers from the first two films include talk-show host Cotton Weary
(Liev Schreiber, The Hurricane), cutthroat journalist Gale Weathers
(Courteney Cox-Arquette, Friends) and Deputy Dwight "Dewey" Riley (David
Arquette, Never Been Kissed), who is a creative consultant for Stab 3.
Oh, and there's also Roger L. Jackson, who has provided that scary phone
voice for all three pictures.
Dewey, Gale and Sidney are reunited on the Stab 3 set after two murders
shut down the production.  Before long, the killer is slashing at all of
them like OJ after a particularly bad round of golf.  They notice
similarities between reality and the Scream 3 script, but nobody knows
how the fictitious film ends because three finales were written to keep
the real one off the Internet.  Everything comes to a head in a mansion
owned by Stab producer John Milton (Lance Henriksen, Millennium), where
our three heroes run around like Scooby, Shaggy and Velma.
The best parts of Scream 3 are when the characters meet the people who
are playing them in Stab 3, especially Gale and Jennifer Jolie (Parker
Posey, The House of Yes), who does a dead-on impersonation of the
aggressive reporter.  Both skinny brunettes are perfect two-dimensional
bookends for Deputy Dewey, the object of both women's desire.  The
denouement is a little improbable, but it's a pretty effective ending
for what is supposed to be the last film in the series.  When Williamson
abandoned the script for Scream 3 to make bad television shows
(Wasteland), Ehren Kruger (Arlington Road) was brought on board, which
would explain the better-than-average conclusion.

Running time: 117 minutes.
        The problem with most long running horror series is that they
inevitably have a habit of outstaying their welcome.  Friday The 13th,
Halloween, and Nightmare On Elm Street, etc, quickly deteriorated once
they started producing increasingly ludicrous sequels that moved
further and further away from the original in both flavour and intent.
On the other hand, true movie trilogies seem to fare better.  Star
Wars, the Indiana Jones and Jack Ryan series, and, to a lesser extent,
The Godfather saga maintained the integrity and standards of the
original.
        Similarly, Scream 3, the third instalment in this popular
horror series that revitalised the teen slasher genre, sticks to its
established formula.  Despite the familiarity of the plotting and a
singular lack of originality, though, Scream 3 will not disappoint
fans.
        Scream 3 is set in Hollywood, where a studio, fascinated by
the gruesome Woodsboro slayings, is filming Stab 3, a sequel that
continues the film-within-a-film that opened Scream 2.  But this
triggers off a new killing spree in which the familiar masked psycho
begins killing off the cast in the order that their characters die in
the movie.  The recent low budget Australian teen slasher film Cut
shares a few superficial similarities and may have stolen some of its
thunder, but Scream 3 is still a vastly superior film.
        The brutal murders reunite tenacious reporter Gale Weathers
(Courtney Cox Arquette) and Dewie Riley (David Arquette), who is
working as a technical advisor on the movie.  The key to the killings
again seems to be feisty Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), who has
disappeared into seclusion and now works as a telephone counsellor
from the anonymity of her safe house.  In probing the new series of
murders, the three raise disturbing questions about the past and the
real identity of the Woodsboro killer, long thought to have been
killed.
        While the regular stars merely go through the motions, Scream
3 introduces us to some new protagonists, who become victims or
suspects.  Mark Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey) is a handsome, film literate
homicide detective, the perfect man to help investigate a series of
murders surrounding a movie set, or so one would assume.  And indie
queen Parker Posey is an absolute delight as Jennifer Jolie, the
actress portraying Gale on screen, who throws herself into the role of
playing real life investigative reporter with annoying gusto.
        Scream 3 has not suffered greatly with the departure of
original writer Kevin Williamson, as it manages to retain much of the
same flavour.  The film supposedly plays around with the conventions
of film sequels, and also adds a new dimension to the
film-within-a-film concept.  Scream 3 also manages to generate some
suspense as to which of our three heroes may not survive.  However,
the writing is not as sharp and there is a greater emphasis on gore
here.  Scream 3 also abounds with clever red herrings and artful
misdirection, as well as some spectacular and bloody deaths.
        Ehren Kruger (who wrote the superb paranoid conspiracy
thriller Arlington Road) ups the body count, but still manages to
punctuate the grisly slayings with lashings of humour, dubious film
lore and heaps of sly in-jokes.  Cameo appearances by famed '60's
director and producer Roger Corman, Silent Bob and Jay (aka Kevin
Smith and Jason Mewes) and Carrie Fisher add to the irreverent flavour
of the whole thing.
        Veteran director Wes Craven knows the rhythms and pacing of
the horror genre, and he directs this familiar material with
assurance, deftly punctuating the gore with judiciously timed shocks
and laughs.  Hopefully, though, Craven et al will now quit the Scream
series while they are still ahead.

 Oh, yes. We're in Hollywood, on the set of "Stab 3," an another sequel
in the saga of the Woodsboro murders.
 Before that, though, we are on a Los Angeles freeway where a boyhood
friend of slasher victim Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) gets a strange
phone call.
 Rushing home he enters his apartment and ...
 Welcome to Wes Craven's "Scream 3." And like the first two movies in
the series, this one is mixes an awareness of the slasher movie genre
with audience expectations. But by now the formula is a bit stale, so
the audience is - if not ahead - at least able to keep pace with Craven
and screenwriter Ehren Kruger.
 OK, so back to the lot of Sunrise Pictures, where a replica of Sidney's
house stands on a closed set and a cast of two-dimensional types sit
around complaining about the script and their parts.
 Of course, now the cast members begin to get bumped off so ...
 Enter the famous newswoman Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox Arquette, as she
now bills herself)  to get the scoop. And who better, since she was a
player in alll the previous action and even wrote a book about it.
 Also on hand is Dewey (David Arquette), the film's technical adviser
and Gale's former boyfriend, who still carries a torch.
        Ain't love grand. What better to reunite two former lovers than a good
serial killing spree.
        As for Sidney, she is holed up somewhere with enough security locks to
keep out the CIA. But the ghost-masked killer learns where she is, so
she flees her isolation, heads for L.A., hooks up with Gale and Dewey
and we're off to the races.
        At about 1 hour and 50 minutes, "Scream 3" drags. There is too much
exposition, the pace is uneven and the rationalization for everything
two complex. There are too many characters, too many red herrings and
the finale is a disappointment.
        But what the heck. The movie will make money because those who were
fascinated by "Scream" and "Scream 2" won't be able to resist this
outing.
        Craven offers some good scary moments and a few goosebumps, but it
seems so formulated, so rote. It lacks a freshness. The movie has a deja
vu, haven't we been here before, feel.
        The cast just goes through its motions, no one stands out and no one
does anything special. "Scream 3" is just more of the same old, same old
        Even cameos by Roger Corman, Carrie Fisher and Kevin Smith as Silent
Bob and Jason Mewes as his motor-mouthed pal from "Dogma" cannot enliven
the plodding proceedings.
 It is time to retire this worn out series. Come on, Wes. Put the knives
and ghost masks away and keep them locked up. Move on. "Scream 3" is
like the party guest who stayed too long and wore out his welcome.

     In the production notes for SCREAM 3, there is a heading titled
"Rules of a Trilogy" which reads: "Chapter One sets the rules. Chapter Two
bends the rules. But in the finale, forget the rules." That's as succinct
a summation as any for why, as this particular trilogy draws to a close,
it feels one chapter too long. SCREAM revived the moribund slasher movie
genre by mining both laughs and scares from horror film conventions. 
SCREAM 2 kept the pace by turning the satire towards horror sequels, and
even the first SCREAM. SCREAM 3, it turns out, does forget the rules. It
forgets that a film based on scary parody of scary movie cliches had
better be scary or funny, but not cliched.
     A few more years have passed since the events in SCREAM 2 as we are
re-introduced to our gang of survivors. Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is
living in seclusion, working from home as a counselor on a crisis hotline. 
Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox Arquette) anchors an "Entertainment
Tonight"-type program after flopping on "60 Minutes II." Cotton Weary
(Liev Schreiber) has become a popular T.V. talk show host and cameo actor
in STAB 3, the latest film based on the Woodsboro murders, on which Dewey
Riley (David Arquette) is working as a consultant. When cast members of
STAB 3 begin turning up dead, accompanied by photos of Sidney's mother as
a young woman, Sidney is drawn out of hiding to find out why. It seems
someone connected to the film is creating his/her own murderous rewrites
on the fly. Or perhaps it's someone investigating the murders. Or perhaps
Sidney's mother herself has returned from beyond the grave.
     The tortuous path to unmasking the killer(s) has, of course, become
one of the series' trademarks -- and, for my money, the most annoying. 
There are suspects a-plenty -- homicide Det. Kincaide (Patrick Dempsey); 
STAB 3 cast members including Jennifer (Parker Posey) and Angelina (Emily
Mortimer); none-too-subtly-named producer John Milton (Lance Henriksen);
director Roman Bridger (Scott Foley) -- in a non-stop parade of hints,
motives and opportunities. Director Wes Craven and screenwriter Ehren
Kruger (stepping in for creator Kevin Williamson) get so focused on
whodunnit, in fact, that they rarely give any juice to what the person
whodunnit is doing. There are a couple of tense moments, including
effective use of a one-way mirror and the surprising perils of a movie
set, but there's nothing to match the nerve-wracking Drew Barrymore
sequence in SCREAM or the crawl across the killer in SCREAM 2. As a
chiller, it's fairly uninspired chase-n-shriek stuff.
     The humor doesn't fare much better, drifting away from commentary on
movies to linger on commentary on movie-making. Kruger tosses off some
solid gags, but they tend to be of the industry-jokey variety (including a
few cute but unnecessary cameos). He even misses some obvious 
opportunities, letting characters split up in a big spooky house with nary
an ironic observation and making everyone too stupid to draw connections
when the killer uses an electronic device to mimic voices. It becomes too
easy to see SCREAM 3 as a step towards exactly the kind of formulaic
horror film the series originally skewered. Even when the humor works, it
feels too easy -- and too played -- to take shots at the people who make
the movies than to take shots at the movies themselves. Kruger opts to
chuckle at career-obsessed directors, bimbo starlets who don't know
VERTIGO from PSYCHO and genre film actors getting absurdly Method about
creating their "characters."
     The height of irony is that you can see that kind of deadly earnest
acting going on in SCREAM 3. The primary offender is Campbell, who looks
as though she could only be dragged back to the set after being promised
Sidney would grow as a character. She does her damndest to make sure we
all understand how haunted she is, as though anyone could possibly care
about the deep psychological underpinnings of Sidney Prescott. It's one
thing for a character to make a reference to the developments in the
GODFATHER trilogy; it's another for Campbell to pretend she's playing
Michael Corleone. SCREAM 3 is a purely functional shocker, but it takes
all the wrong things seriously and plays all the wrong things for laughs.
Craven and company have forgotten the rules, all right. They've even
forgotten why the series was worth a third installment in the first place.

SCREAM 3 (2000) by JOHN SYLVA , associate of OFCS (www.ofcs.org)
It's sure been a rocky road to the third and final chapter in quite possibly
the most talked about and celebrated slasher series in history.  In May of
1999, Kevin Williamson, breakthrough writer of the first two "Scream" films,
dropped out of the project to finish his directorial debut, "Teaching Mrs.
Tingle" (Which was slammed by critics, and struggled to reach 10 million
domestically), leaving writing duties to relative newcomer Ehren Kruger
(Arlington Road).  The question everyone on everyone's mind:  How can the third
film live up to its predecessors when the man responsible for the edge of the
series is gone?  Well, after seeing "Scream 3," it's obvious that it can't
entirely; But Kruger certainly gives it a shot, ending up making a film that is
more of a loner than part of a series.
Our reigning heroine, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) has gone into hiding
after the turn of events at the southern Ohio Windsor College, and works for
California Woman's Crisis Counseling in her solitary home in the hills of
Monterey.  Down in Hollywood, production on "Stab 3: Return to Woodsboro," a
fictional account inspired by the characters of the first two "Scream" films
has begun, under the direction of Roman Bridger (Scott Foley) at Sunrise
Studios.  As filming begins, so does the body count, as it's apparent this
killer doesn't want "Stab 3" to finish production.  Along for the ride are the
ambitious reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox Arquette) and goofy cop Dewey
Riley (David Arquette), both returning from the previous two films, along with
Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber), once convicted killer of Sidney's mother,
Jennifer Jolie (Parker Posey), over the top actress who portrays Gale Weathers
in "Stab 3," Detective Mark Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey), who is assigned to
investigate the murders, Sarah Darling (Jenny McCarthy), a spunky actress who
is unhappy with her role in "Stab 3," Angelina Tyler (Emily Mortimer), a
suspicious and downright weird woman playing Sidney in "Stab 3," Steven Stone
(Patrick Warburton), Jennifer Jolie's bodyguard, Tyson Fox (Deon Richmond),
struggling African American actor, and John Milton (Lance Henriksen), producer
of "Stab 3" who seems to know a little too much about Sidney, and her mother.
The large ensemble cast is one of diversity and talent, with everyone handling
their share of the work, even if its one scene, with ease. The current "Scream
Queen," Neve Campbell, handles her character with care and emotion, as she has
in the past as well.  Sidney has always been the one character that the
audience can relate to and sympathize for, because her character has always had
an overwhelming amount of authenticity to it.  Once labeled the "indie queen,"
Parker Posey is hilarious and sharp as her well-written character.  Posey gives
a performance that is meant to mock today's mainstream actresses that usually
star in films like this one; She's a complete riot.  Courteney Cox Arquette and
husband David Arquette both fit their character's shoes as well as they did in
the previous two films.
Wes Craven, who has helmed all three films, directs "Scream 3" with
intelligence and care.  Craven certainly knows how to stage good jump scenes,
but his ability to cause suspense in the viewer seems to be vanishing. 
Craven's direction is accompanied perfectly by Marco Beltrami's slick, powerful
score that at times is a bit overwhelming, but the score lives up to his
previous work in the "Scream" films.  The cinematography is rather dull this
time around, unlike the eerie and bold photography seen in the previous two
films.
"Scream 3" is a completely different film than one would expect; It's campy,
fun, light, and rather predictable; What the "Scream" films are not known for. 
"Scream 3" is more of an excellent spin-off of the first two rather than a part
of the series.  Kruger's script holds hardly any suspense, many characters flat
as cardboard, but he tops it all off with an amazing and poignant ending that
couldn't have been more perfect.  The premise of "Scream 3" is something to
scream about all in its own, but it's too bad that aside from Jennifer Jolie,
none of the actors or crew on "Stab 3" are around long enough for us to get to
know them before they meet their bloody death.  By the time all is said and
done, there is a body count so large, it's difficult to even remember who bit
the dust.  (Unlike the first two films, where the characters were individuals,
characters who seemed like real people.)
It may not completely be a "Scream" movie, but on its own merit, "Scream 3" is
one witty and rewarding ride.  The pacing is brisk and the dialogue is snappy;
This is where the film totally lives up to its expectations.  But what "Scream
3" has that the previous two don't is a certain level of campiness, one at
which you're laughing more than you're screaming, jumping more than you're
screaming.  I was reminded of the 1985 classic "Clue" at many moments, as the
character's reactions to one's death are more entertaining than the death
itself.  The last 30 minutes of "Scream 3" are a complete riot- Unbelievable,
superb, and tense fun.  The idea of whether or not this is a "Scream" film
completely slips your mind by the time it reaches its conclusion, as although
it's hardly suspenseful or unpredictable, "Scream 3" is without a doubt the
most entertaining of the three.  It'd certainly be interesting to see what
Williamson would have done with the final chapter; Whether or not he'd try and
match the previous films' atmosphere or take the road of being an individual,
as Kruger did.  Either way, "Scream 3" is a satisfying and fun film.  Hands
down to a fine conclusion to an even finer trilogy.  We can all breathe a sigh
of relief now. The most shocking, fresh, and unpredictable slasher series of
all time is complete.
The Bottom Line: Some diehard "Scream" fans may be disappointed, but all in
all, "Scream 3" is a guaranteed good time.  As the first two "Scream" films,
"Scream 3" is destined to become a cult classic.

Scream 3, starring Neve Cambell, Courtney Cox Arquette and David Arquette. With
Liev Schreiber and Carrie Fisher. Rated R for violence, gore and profanity.
Directed by Wes Craven. 2000.
   Well, it's been a little adventure... watching the Scream flicks evolve and
generate it's stir over the course of the past five-or-so years.  Overall, as a
moviegoing experience, it was satisfying.  Scream brought back an entire genre,
and to a new generation.  Bringing forth both the good (The Faculty), the bad
(Urban Legend) and the ugly (I Still Know What You Did Last Summer). Along with
some loose ends in between. Though, not one exceeded the influence or even
entertainment value of it's predecessor
   The first was an excellent movie.  It had a dark satirization of the horror
genre that many a moviegoer appreciated very much.  Taking stabs at not only
the over-the-top content, but also some hilarious irony towards pop culture as
two characters discuss their relationship in relation to film ratings; "Could
you settle for a PG-13 relationship?"
   The problem with the second, the one I liked the least, was it seemed to
take itself more seriously than the others.  It was trying too hard and seemed
to get lost and become, as itself, part of the genre which it was formerly
poking fun at.  The ending was less than appealing, and the characters were
extremely flat in most cases.  But, it had it's moments also.
   As for the third (and supposedly final) sequel... aside from it's shockingly
disappointing ending and the fact that they kill off the best actor (not
necessarily character) during the opening, it was fairly better than decent. 
It provided some humor, although more in the form of slapstick, as opposed to
satire.
   Scream 3 is flawed, very much so. But, generally, an ending in a film of
this type can literally make or break the film.  And in this case, while not
breaking fully in half, it fractures in nonetheless. And I'm still in awe at
how completely gutless and amateurish the ending was.  Everything is wrapped up
in a "neat little package" and everyone (who's still alive) lives oh so happily
ever after.  C'mon, dare to be interesting. Ehren Kruger, who also wrote
Arlington Road (for which he won the prestigious Nicholl Screenwriting
fellowship award for acheivment in screenwriting) and the soon-coming Reindeer
Games with Ben Affleck and Gary Sinise, writes, and while Williamson, the
original writer of the first two, is no brilliant mind, we loose the series'
style (even knowing I disliked the second).
   Kevin Williamson's scripts seem like they were written on a plane trip from
Hollywood to Los Angeles, but they are always engrossing.  A good waste of
time, in most cases.  Though, to my surprise, Williamson supposedly nominated
Kruger for the job, and while he won praise and did win a very prestigious
award for achievements in screenwriting for Road, I feel, well, disappointed at
the simplicity of the picture,
   As for Williamson's works, The Faculty is merely a reminiscent of a typical
50's drive-in horror flick, Teaching Mrs. Tingle was pretty enjoyable even
though definitively "campy," and the Scream series has a heavy cult following
now.  He can write a good reminiscent of a certain genre.  I'm pretty sure he
could have improved the ending.  Even if as a cheap surprise ending (i.e.: I
Still Know What You Did Last Summer).
   Scream 3, at times, does break back into the satire of the original.  Not
too often does it, but when it does, it does so well.  Direct comedy towards
trilogies, stereotypes-of, etc., though not as impressively as it had in the
original.
   In general, I'd recommend it.  For a good time.  If you're going there for
any other reason you'll be disappointed.  Very typical and nothing
extraordinarily new or groundbreaking appears.  Rather predictable and
tolerably cheesy, as well as consisting of some seemingly forced performances. 
But I'd rather see this over the second any day. It's worth the money,
regardless of the flaws (which come plentiful). My advice: wait for video, get
all three and stay up 'til three in the morning watching them.

         Back in 1996, Wes Craven's Scream single-handedly revived the
teen slasher genre, launched the career of screenwriter Kevin
Williamson and spotlighted young TV actors like Neve Campbell, Liev
Schreiber, Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich, Sarah Michelle Geller and
Rebecca Gayheart. As it evolved into two sequels, it even spawned an
off-screen romance - Courteney Cox met David Arquette while making
Scream, got engaged after Scream 2, and they are now married for
Scream 3.  This final version of the trilogy, written by Ehren Kruger
(Arlington Road), finds tortured Sidney (Neve Campbell) hiding out in
the California hills, even as intrepid TV reporter Gail Weathers
(Courteney Cox Arquette) tries to track her down. Meanwhile, there's a
movie-within-a-movie, as the real-life survivors of the Woodsboro
massacre become technical advisors on Stab 3, a low-budget
horror-movie-in-the-making. That's how dorky ex-cop Dewey Riley (David
Arquette) finds himself dating Jennifer Jolie (Parker Posey), the
actress who is playing Gail. Sound confusing? Just wait. There's an
obsessive detective (Patrick Dempsey), a flaky director (Scott Foley),
and a producer-with-a-past (Lance Hendrickson) - all of whom become
suspects in multiple murders. It's deja vu all over again. Problem is:
it's difficult to sustain the excitement over three years so, by now,
the concept feels a bit flat, formulaic, even stale. And the scariest
part is glimpsing Star Wars' Carrie Fisher, whom age has not been kind
to since playing Princess Leia. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
Scream 3 is a silly, shrieking 6. And get ready for a parody. Miramax
will slay you with Scary Movie on March 31.
