Plot: In the afterlife a group of workers deal with an assortment of 
newly arrived dead. Each of the new arrivals has one week in which to 
select their single favourite memory so that the afterlife workers might 
reconstruct and then videotape it and the arrivals can then pass on and 
inhabit that memory. But many of the arrivals have some difficulty 
choosing a memory.
This marvellous little Japanese film has a quiet effectiveness that kind 
of creeps up on you afterwards. The whole film comes with a sublime 
simplicity to it. It's vision of the afterlife is conducted with a 
wonderful minimalism - this entire afterlife takes place not in Grecian 
palaces in the sky or even the grandiose visions of classical artwork 
come to three-dimensional life as in the recent What Dreams May Come', 
but rather in what looks like a disused schoolhouse. There is almost 
nothing to the film other than a series of vignettes with various people 
standing about being interviewed - and almost despite which, the film 
manages to be an absolute delight.
The interview scenes are conducted with an endearing sense of humour - 
the old lady who says nothing and simply looks out the window, the 
teenage girl who wants her trip to Disneyland recreated, the young punk 
who immediately announces he is refusing to choose anything. Director 
Hirokazu has a genuine affection for the banality and foibles of the 
people's lives and the film manages to paint each of its subjects with 
considerable amusement yet also a quiet dignity.
Unlike What Dreams May Come', After Life' makes no pretense to any 
profound insights into the afterlife or human spiritual condition. But 
the two films, each in their own way, both manage to offer unique and 
thoughtful humanist revisions of classical afterlife imagery . Although 
quite the opposite of What Dreams', After Life's  vision of the 
hereafter comes with an enchanting banality, one where the afterlife 
volunteers have as many clues as to why they are as anybody else does. 
The latter quarter of the film is highly amusing when it comes to the 
recreation of each person's memory and in the sheer mundanity of the 
afterlife volunteers' attempts to get the details right - not having the 
right plane for one memory scenario and having to saw the wing off the 
plane they do have and then send pieces of cotton wool past on wires to 
represent clouds; or a tram scenario being revealed as a mockup being 
rocked by two of the volunteers. Quite a charming film.

     CAPSULE: The recently dead must each choose the most memorable
moment of their lives to have them filmed.  Once this process is
complete they can continue on to heaven.  The film combines documentary
footage with interviews with dramatic storytelling.  A little slow at
times, but worthwhile over all.  Rating: 6 (0 to 10), high +1 (-4 to
+4)
   - Directed by Hirokazu Kore-Eda.
   - When one dies, according to the premise of this film, each person
     must choose the best moment of his life to have it recreated on
     film, then to live it for eternity.  One gets a week complete with
     advisors to get this accomplished.  This is the story of one week
     in this odd purgatory.
   - The building used for this purpose seems to be some sort of old
     school building.  It is one much in needing of a repainting.
     There is a staff of advisors, many with their own problems, trying
     to help the dead in their task by counseling them on what moment
     to choose and then helping them to get it filmed.
   - Much of the film is real documentary footage of people choosing
     and talking about the most significant moment in their lives.
     Actors hired for the film and when possible they talked about
     moments from their lives.  Only the actors who had scripted key
     moments were those who were needed for the story.  This use of
     interview material reminiscent of some Aardman animated films.
   - Not clear why the moments chosen by the dead had to be filmed by
     them except that the director had the facilities.  Only one or two
     moments are seen being filmed.

   Much as we like to push such questions to the fringes of
our minds, we can't help thinking about what happens to
us after we die.  Is there a heaven and is there a hell?  If so,
would the latter be a more interesting place to spend eternity,
as some revisionists half-jokingly claim?  No one put the
inquiry in better literary form than Shakespeare, whose
suicidal Hamlet chose to live after fearing what would happen
"when we have shuffled our this mortal coil."  No wonder,
then, that directors and screenwriters have let their
imaginations run freely as they've conjured up comedies and
dramas about life after death, the splashy American entry,
"What Dreams May Come" being the latest commercial
venture into that crowded field.
   Films about the afterlife are a natural for the cinema, the
most visually kinetic of the art forms and so well suited to
flights of fancy.  What, then, got into the head of Kore-Eda
Hirokazu in his second directorial feature, "After Life," which
has to be about the most static film ever made about the
subject?  What a rejection of the most basic concept of film,
the principal factor that separates it from books.  Film is a
visual medium.  Don't tell me; show me.  Talking heads are
more suited to the stage and even in the legitimate theater,
directors typically exploit technology to bring the page to life.
Hirokazu makes the same mistake as had Mike Nichols in
choosing the inert "The Designated Mourner" as his first
acting vehicle.
   What is particularly surprising is the near-hysteria that
greeted the introduction of the film at various festivals,
evoking sell-out crowds and rave reviews online critics like
David Dalgleish, who called this "a masterpiece...warm,
intimate, direct" and Richard Scheib, who decided at the
Vancouver International Film Festival last year that this is a
"marvelous little Japanese film...that kind of creeps up on
you."  De gustibus non disputandem est, as they say, or in
other words, thank goodness critics' opinions on any given
movie run the gamut of else a lot of writers would have to
look for jobs.
   Director Kore-Eda Hirokazu was induced to make this film
by his grandfather's senility.  As he states in the production
notes, the poor old man suffered from Alzheimer's disease,
gradually forgetting even that he had eaten (he requested a
dinner just after completing a meal), could not find his way
home, and failed to recognize the people of his family or
even himself.  "I now understand," thought Hirokazu, "How
critical memories are to our identity."  
   "After Life" focuses on the importance of memory by
presenting an allegory about people who have just died and
are at a half-way house between earth and heaven.  There is
nothing elaborate about the space: a dilapidated building that
resembles a New York City public high school houses a
mostly young staff who interview a barrage of the newly
deceased each Monday, giving them three days to make a
decision.  They are told that heaven does not exist as any of
them now believe the place to be, but that a substitute is
currently available.  Each of the clients is to think of his or
her single fondest memory.  That is the recollection that will
be filmed, and then the subject could repeat the episode for
eternity. There's more.  All the client's other remembrances
will be deleted as easily as this computer can expunge this
entire review, as though Alzheimer's has claimed all the bad
memories and guilt trips.  Sound good?  Not to the Western
mind, perhaps.  We--at least in America--believe that variety
is the spice of life and that anything, even the most enjoyable
experience, can become like a hell woven from Jean-Paul
Sartre's "No Exit" if reproduced day in, day out.  Think of the
Malcolm McDowell's character in "Clockwork Orange" having
to listen to the glory of Beethoven's Ninth once, twice, thrice,
ad infinitum.
   Those who are enamored of this film will probably point to
the humor and poignancy of the newly dead who are being
interviewed by the staff.  One old lady, asked to conjure up
her favorite memory, simply stares out of the window or lines
up figurines on the table.  A young punk who died at the age
of 21 defiantly refuses to make a choice.  A girl of about the
same age recalls her trip to Disneyland and the kindness of a
friend who gave her a couple of pancakes when she did not
have the money to buy her own breakfast.  A disreputable-
looking man of late-middle age talks only about sex,
confirming what so women believe that this is the only thing
that men think about.  Of all the patrons, the most involving is
one 70-year-old fellow who, like several others, has had a life
so banal that he can barely think of a single memory he'd like
to preserve for all time.  He has to go through quite a few
videotapes which had recorded his life, one tape to a year,
and even then has difficulty eliciting a single, truly
pleasurable moment in three-score and ten years.
   Online critic David Dalgleish reports that he was
immeasurably moved by an interview with an elderly woman
who recalls a dance she attended to a song called "The Red
Shoes."  A young girl stands in for her and performed a brief
recital which, Dalgleish insists, "move me, inexplicably, to
tears."  Did we see the same film?
   Hirokazu's principal claim to imaginative fame is that he
interweaves a film with the looks of a documentary into a
fictionalized, allegorical drama, using real people he recruited
from such places as nursing homes along with professional
actors.  The film does possess tenderness and gentle humor,
but while the fable would make for a fine piece of literature,
on the screen it lacks the very life claimed by its title.

     One of the most endearing and enduring subgenres of cinema is the
peek behind the curtain to a glimpse of the Great Beyond.  The way we
choose to imagine the hereafter tells us a few things about ourselves,
and for the most part we seem to prefer a prosaic, familiar feel to
it.  For a Crossing the Bar Film Festival at home, check the video
store for some of the following: "Green Pastures" (1936), "Our Town"
(1940), "Here Comes Mr.  Jordan" (1941) -- remade as "Heaven Can Wait"
(1978), "Stairway to Heaven" (1946), "Truly, Madly, Deeply" (1990),
"Defending Your Life" (1991)...the list goes on and on, and most of
them are wonderful.
Which brings us to the latest, a Japanese film called, in
Japanese, "Wandafuru Raifu" ("Wonderful Life") and released here as
"After Life".  Writer-director Kore-eda's set-up here is a processing
station at which the newly-dead are politely interviewed by young
bureaucrats sitting at desks in a dingy office building, and asked to
think of one memory that they would like to take with them into
eternity.  Once they have chosen, all other memories of their lives
will be erased.  The memory is then recreated by the staff on film,
using props and makeshift sets that resemble the resources of a very
down-at-the-heels summer stock company.  Everything about this
production is simple and bare-bones, and this leaves room for the
complexity to express itself in the film's ideas.
How do you settle on the one memory?  It's a hell of a choice,
and after watching this movie's wonderful characters grin and scratch
their heads and wrack their brains to come up with the right choice,
you'll find yourself playing the game for the rest of the evening on
your own.

     Hirokazu Koreeda's AFTER LIFE is a film that stirs the imagination
instantly -- which is fortunate, because the overflow of good will has to
carry through an ill-conceived conclusion.  The provocative premise
combines the post-mortem bureaucracy of DEFENDING YOUR LIFE with a
conversation from CITY SLICKERS about the best days of one's life.  In a
sort of celestial way-station, the recently departed are asked to identify
the best memory of their lives, the moment in which they were happiest and
most content.  After interviews with case workers, those memories are
turned into films, which will accompany the deceased as their sole memory
into the next world.
     The first half of AFTER LIFE sticks close to the interviews, drawn by
Koreeda from real conversations (in fact, several of the interviewees are
non-professionals relating actual events from their own lives).  The
memories about which they speak are intriguing enough in their own right
-- some with tales about childhood innocence, others with accounts of
adult adventures -- to spark reflections by viewers about their own
favored recollections.  More intriguing still is AFTER LIFE's exploration
of the nature of memory as a combination of things as they were and things
as we wish they could have been.  One woman, a former prostitute, recalls
a blissful encounter with a man in a hotel, until she reluctantly
acknowledges that the man never showed up.  Even the conceit of creating a
film version of an imperfect memory -- rather than using the archived
videotapes of people's lives available to the case workers -- emphasizes
the power of filtered, romanticized remembrance.
     For over an hour, AFTER LIFE delights with reflections on what we
remember and how we remember it, letting the steady stream of interviews
flow over the loose narrative structure.  Then, out of freaking nowhere,
Koreeda decides AFTER LIFE needs to be about someone in particular.  The
focus shifts from the scope of human experience to one case worker,
Mochizuki (Arata), working with one recent arrival, 70-year-old Mr.
Watanabe (Taketoshi Naito).  In the course of helping Watanabe -- who
considers his life so mundane that there's not a moment worth remembering
-- Mochizuki struggles with unresolved issues from his own life.  There's
also Mochizuki's apprentice/assistant Shiori (Erika Oda), who has romantic
feelings for Mochizuki and wanders wistfully through the streets of Tokyo
taking snapshots.  After spending most of the film as effective supporting
players, the Rosencrantzes and Guildensterns of AFTER LIFE cold-cock this
"Hamlet" and make it all about them.
     There's nothing inherently wrong with a movie about the longings of
otherworldly guides, unless you count the fact that it's already been done
a few times.  But AFTER LIFE shouldn't have been one of those movies,
since it already had so much going for it as meditation on transcendent
life experiences.  There's a strange appeal to the production's
heaven-as-low-budget-independent-film-set look, and plenty more appeal to
the tales of the deceased.  It's hard not to suspect that AFTER LIFE would
have made an extraordinary documentary, since Koreeda's steady,
concentrated medium shots of the characters describing their memories are 
so effective.  Maybe then Koreeda wouldn't have been tempted to leave the
strengths of his film -- which are plenty strong -- for the supernatural
melodrama of long-lost loves.  In my memory, this one will linger as a
good film that could have been great.

"I would like you to choose the most important memory of your life."
Starring Abe Sadao, Ishido Natsuo, Oda Erika, Terajima Susumu, Naito 
Takashi
Written & Directed by Kore-eda Hirokazu
Cinematography by Yamazaki Yutaka and Sukita Masayoshi
It begins with a great hook.  Several men and a woman gather in a 
room, discussing their workload for the week to come.  Each is 
assigned several cases--people, presumably patients, maybe in a 
hospital, maybe in a mental institution.  But the workers discussing 
their cases wear ordinary clothes, and the building seems more school 
than hospital.  The people--patients, if that is what they are--are 
greeted in a reception room, and then directed to the person handling 
their "case."  Everyone is amiable and courteous.  The "case workers" 
lead their "patients" to a private room, sit them down at a desk, face 
them squarely.  They then inform them that they are dead, and in a few 
days they will pass on to another realm, beyond self-awareness.
So begins the second fiction feature by Japanese director Kore-eda 
Hirokazu, whose previous work, MABOROSI, was one of this decade's more 
impressive debuts.  But that movie, sublime as it was, is surpassed in 
all regards by AFTER LIFE.  MABOROSI was a strikingly beautiful film, 
but austere and formal: it required patience.  To appreciate it, you 
had to bear with it.  AFTER LIFE requires no such act of faith: it is 
warm, intimate, direct, and it is a masterpiece.
The building, then, is neither hospital nor school nor institute: it 
is limbo, the doorway to heaven, the threshold of nirvana, any or all 
of the above.  The men and the woman are not case workers, they are 
advisors, they will guide the dead on their final voyage.  Their task 
is simple enough to describe, but difficult to perform: they must help 
the dead choose a single memory, their most cherished memory, and when 
they have done so, they will pass on to a place where they will dwell 
in that memory forever, forgetting all else.  In a splendidly 
conceived literalization of this task--and a self-reflexive comment on 
the task that AFTER LIFE itself undertakes--the guides also have to 
stage a reenactment of each chosen memory, which will be filmed for 
posterity.  (This leads, amongst other things, to a clever scene 
staged like a pre-production meeting, in which they discuss how to 
recreate individual memories: clouds rushing by the cockpit of an 
airplane in flight; cherry blossom falling like snow.)
The dead--who look, talk, and act as they were just before they 
died--ask the kind of questions we might ask.  There is no heaven and 
hell?  No, there isn't.  Can they choose a dream instead of a memory, 
or a vision of the future instead of a recollection of the past?  No, 
they can't.  Once they have established the parameters, they begin to 
pan the rivers of memory, sifting the rocks and the sand and the mud, 
looking for the precious glint of gold, the single instant that sums 
up who they were.  The process is as much self-definition as 
recollection.  Much of this part of the film is done in "talking head" 
documentary-style interviews: the camera, fixed, faces the characters 
head-on, and lets them talk.  Nothing else is needed: listening to 
their reminiscences, feeling their emotions as they try to capture the 
essence of themselves in a single moment, provides all the drama and 
passion we could want.
There is an authenticity about these reminiscences that goes beyond 
fiction, beyond acting, that seems to capture something raw and true.  
I was not surprised to learn, after I had seen the film, that many of 
the cast members are non-professionals, real people recalling real 
lives.  They were selected from over five hundred interviewees, found 
more or less at random, in nursing homes and parks and temples in 
Tokyo.  What these people have done in this film is remarkable.  It is 
not acting, but its opposite: they have stripped away pretense and 
artifice, and bared their souls.
We learn much about them, but as they talk to their advisors, we also 
start to learn about the advisors, too.  There are many quiet 
revelations, each fitting perfectly into the overall scheme of the 
film.  We are treated to the details of the advisor's jobs, the 
logistics involved in the mock-up recreations, the formalities that 
provide a send-off for these people as they pass into easeful 
self-less sleep.  Some details are left deliberately obscure--we never 
learn how anyone died, we never learn the boundaries of this spiritual 
halfway house--but we eventually find out who the guides are, and why 
they do what they do.  The more I think about it, the more profound 
and reassuring that revelation seems.
The same can be said for the whole movie, but one sequence in 
particular affected me beyond all reason.  An older woman--who I am 
convinced is one of the non-professionals, remembering genuine lived 
experience--is describing her chosen memory.  She recalls dancing as a 
young girl to a song called "The Red Shoes."  As she talks, details 
return to her: the dance steps, her red dress, a gesture made with her 
handkerchief. There is nothing in my own experience that connects me 
with these things.  She is a woman; I am a man.  I have never been to 
her homeland; she, probably, has never been to mine.  I have never 
heard a song called "The Red Shoes," and I don't like dancing.
Yet this scene, this simple, unpoetic remembrance, moved me, 
inexplicably, to tears.  I can count on one hand the number of times I 
have felt so choked up by a single scene in a movie.  The only thing 
that this woman and I have in common is our humanity.  One of AFTER 
LIFE's many lessons is that, in the end, that is enough.  We are all 
bound by our mortality, and it is that bond which makes it bearable.

Imagine, right now, where you sit reading this article...you die, pack it
in, kick the bucket, pass on. You immediately arrive in your old (now quite
abandoned) high school building. There, some patient filmmaker explains that
you'll have three days to pick one memory from your life. One memory they'll
film. One memory with which to spend eternity. All other recollections lost.
Which fine moment would you pick? Could you pick?
Shot on 16mm "After Life" already has the film school feel. Add to that
documentary style interviews with a mix of actors and real people trying to
think of that one golden memory worth re-living for the rest of their lives
(post-mortemly speaking). The batch of recently deceased spend the next
three days reminiscing and choosing. A fellow with a poor memory is supplied
71 video tapes (one for each year of his life) with which to review and
ultimately, from which to select an event for recreation. After the third
day, set design begins. Then construction and finally filming. It's a
wonderfully interesting concept with some genuinely charming moments. But it
drags a bit after the initial interviews. The film could easily have been
ten to twenty minutes shorter (more than a few cuts are twice as long as
necessary). At times, I ached for a fast forward button.
Sweetly and gently crafted "After Life" asks a grand question to those newly
dead. Perhaps they could have improved their lot of "special events" had
they been asked while still alive. This may be "After Life's" greatest
gift -- all who view it are still alive (though a few may be sleeping).
Starring Takashi Mochizuki and Shiori Satonakia.
Written and Directed by Hirokazu Kore-Eda.
Produced by Shiho Sato at TV Man Union/Engine.
No Rating.
