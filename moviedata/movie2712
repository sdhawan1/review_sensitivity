Every now and then, a film proves to be much better
than its story.  This is the case for "Heaven Knows,
Mr. Allison", which should be a laughable attempt
to combine unlikely romance and war-time heroism.
Instead, the lead characters are both sympathetic
and compelling.  Much credit goes to the well-cast
leads, Robert Mitchum and Deborah Kerr, and to
John Huston, who directed and co-wrote the script.
The story is set in 1944.  Mitchum is an orphan
and drifter who has finally found a home with
the Marines.  Kerr is a nun-to-be who is one
month away from taking her final vows.  A convoluted
plot contrivance (it takes ten minutes for the
leads to explain it) places both of them alone
together on a remote Pacific island (perhaps its
"The Blue Lagoon"), where, predictably, Mitchum
begins wooing Kerr.  Kerr, who is dependant upon
Mitchum for her survival, is torn between her two
saviors: God and Mitchum.
Their would-be relationship is endangered by the
Japanese, who alternate between occupying and
abandoning the island.  Mitchum steals food from
and sabotages the Japanese, while Kerr hides from
them in a remarkably well-lit cave.  Just when
the settlers (Kerr and Mitchum) are surrounded
by the Indians (the Japanese), the cavalry (the
U.S. Air Force and Navy) comes to the rescue.
But again, the film is much better than the
cynical plot summary would indicate.  Thanks
to the script and performances, Kerr and Mitchum
come across as two ordinary souls developing
a friendship through adversity, rather than
two formula characters in a calculated marketing
attempt to attract both male and female audiences
to the theater.
Deborah Kerr received an Oscar nomination for
Best Actress. The Huston/John Lee Mahin
screenplay (based on the Charles Shaw novel)
was also nominated.
