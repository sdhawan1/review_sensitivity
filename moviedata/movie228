      In the early scenes of AN AFFAIR OF LOVE, two characters appear in
documentary-style interview vignettes. In separate one-on-one interviews,
an off-camera voice prods an unnamed woman (Nathalie Baye) and man (Sergi
Lopez) for information about a relationship that is now clearly some time
in the past. As the interviews are cross-cut with scenes from their actual
meetings, the two voices turn into something akin to a spoken-word version
of "I Remember It Well." They met on-line, she says; they met through a
personals ad in a magazine, he says. They exchanged photos, he says; not
so, says she. Their first sexual encounter was satisfying, she claims with
a smile; a bit disappointing, he recalls. Ah, yes  they remember it well.
     The hazy recollections and unreliable perceptions could have been
played as little more than an amusing conceit, but in AN AFFAIR OF LOVE,
they form the backbone for one of the most stunningly rendered
sort-of-love stories in recent years. A few things do become more-or-less
clear as the story unfolds, despite the differing retrospective accounts. 
The man and woman initially come together to fulfill a mutual, somewhat
unusual sexual fantasy, one that is never explicitly defined. Though the
encounter is initially meant to be a one-time, purely physical event, they
agree to meet again, and again, until they contemplate a more "normal" 
sexual encounter. Eventually, each begins to feel that the relationship
has more potential, even though they do not know each other's name, or
occupation, or anything that, as the woman describes, makes up "what we
normally call our lives."
     It doesn't take a Francophone to recognize that the French title UNE
LIAISON PORNOGRAPHIQUE doesn't exactly translate to AN AFFAIR OF LOVE. 
Indeed, Fine Line Films' American title proves not only to be an obvious
bow to marketing concerns, but a patently absurd take on the development
of the relationship. What begins as a pornographic liaison does mutate,
but it does not mutate into a love affair. AN AFFAIR OF LOVE is a
meditation on what happens to people when they find themselves in a
relationship where they feel no pressure to do what they think they should
do, because the rules have been discarded from the outset. The man and
woman's growing affection builds to a climax that has been telegraphed by
the framing structure -- we know they don't end up together -- yet packs a
wallop because it's not about whether they will end up together. In fact,
the scene is brilliant because it works on two levels: as a tragedy of a
relationship that didn't have to end, and as evidence that neither one
knew the other in any substantial way.
     By all rights, AN AFFAIR OF LOVE should never have worked as anything
more than an intellectual exercise, with a little sex thrown in for spice. 
The characters are defined exclusively within the context of their 
arm's-length relationship, leaving huge chunks of their lives unexplored. 
Yet they still emerge as fascinating and complex people, thanks to a
subtle script by Philippe Blasband and two remarkable performances. Baye
and Lopez play off each other masterfully -- hinting at emotions beneath
the surface, capturing awkward moments with a sensitivity that almost
forces you to look away. Fonteyne pulls it all together with an unfailing
visual sense, and a rhythm that pulls this 77-minute film together without
an ounce of flab.
     The only time AN AFFAIR OF LOVE feels remotely strained in its
presentation involves an episode where the lovers have an encounter with
an estranged elderly couple. It's an unnecessarily obvious counterpoint to
the fantasy world in which they live, one that spells out what any viewer
should understand: that the relationship being explored has nothing to do
with the reality of a life together. Fonteyne says more when he's saying
less, as he does when he leaves his camera at a distance outside the hotel
room door when the lovers are engaged in their mysterious fantasy 
activity. It is the one moment where the two characters come together in
their story; they both respect the privacy and intimacy of the reason they
came together in the first place. The irony of Fine Line's title is that
it plays to the distorted memories of the characters who, over time, have

 AN AFFAIR OF LOVE (UNE LIAISON PORNOGRAPHIQUE) (director: Frederic
 Fonteyne; screenwriter: Philippe Blasband; cinematographer: Virginie
 Saint-Martin; editor: Chantal Hymans; cast: Nathalie Baye (Elle-Her),
 Sergi Lopez (Lui-Him), Jacques Viala (Interviewer); Runtime: 78; Fine
 Line Features; 2000)
This is a French romantic story about two strangers living out their
fantasy in a Paris hotel
on Thursdays for a period of six months. A sensuous woman, Nathalie
Baye, in her forties, meets a man online for a casual sex affair, so
that she can fulfill her sexual fantasy. Sergi Lopez, also someone who
is fortysomething, but according to his version, he responded to a
personal ad in a girlie magazine and sent a letter with his photo, which
resulted in the two meeting in a bar. In this minimalist tale, the two
are interviewed separately by an unseen Jacques Viala, who could never
get either one of them to reveal their fantasy, and what's more, they
sometimes had different impressions about the affair.
Interestingly, this is a very steamy story, but the sex is not
explicit...as the film is more than anything else a love story, about
two nameless souls, not knowing anything about each other's lives, but
through sex falling in love...yet unable in their six month relationship
to find a way to make a declaration of love that sticks.
The story is narrated by the two, through the interviewer's offscreen
questions to them about their relationship. Which starts with their
first date, as each is visibly nervous, but they proceed to the hotel
across the street and have their first sexual encounter behind closed
doors. All the viewer finds out about it, is that it went OK and they
will be meeting again next week. We also see that they are both
sensitive, intelligent and respectable people.
The only time we see them have sex, is when they decide to do it
"normally," with the only twist that she's on top of him. This normal
sex excites them more than the fantasy she advertised for does, and it
is also emotionally unwinding for them, as it brings them closer
together than they imagined this relationship would be able to do. It
was a great bedroom lovemaking scene, which was intimately done with
both humor and passion.
But the viewer, unable to know more than the little he sees about them,
can only guess at what draws them so close. The story played more like a
gimmick than a real love affair, because after their initial encounters,
it seemed rather strange that these intelligent people wouldn't be
curious to know more about each other, especially since they were
developing a certain bond together.
Yet, on the other hand, the reason this film worked so well, was the
illuminated performance by Baye, who was 50 at the time of the film, but
looks much younger and has such a touching quality about her, that she
is simply ravishing. There was a great chemistry between her and the
introspective, quietly handsome Spanish actor, Lopez. And if you add to
that the mature script by French novelist and playwright Philippe
Blasband and the classy way Frederic Fonteyne directed, it is easy to
see why the film was so enthralling. What you get is an affair that
turns out to be in surprisingly good taste, but without satisfying the
more mundane matters in a relationship. It was as if this was a sex lab
experiment, an ideal couple was being tested to see if a purely sexual
encounter could spark a more intimate relationship. If the film moved
off its experimental mode and let us see the couple act away from the
controlled ground rule conditions, this might have been an even much
better film.
The film was originally titled "Une Liaison Pornographique." It won for
Best Film at Venice.

My first thought was, "Oh God, another one of those pretentious foreign
art house sex films."  The opening shot features one of those busy
Parisian streets, the locals hustling by in a blur of slow motion.  This
city tells a thousand stories, my friends, and An Affair of Love is one
of them.
As if to add insult to injury, our first actual scenes are of the woman
(Nathalie Baye, Day For Night) and man (Sergi López) after the affair,
being interviewed by some off-screen voice.  It's very When Harry Met
Sally, only with the added layer of being French lovers talking about
their passionate encounters.  Hoo boy, this is gonna be a long road,
isn't it?
We learn that the woman placed an ad in a magazine.  Of all the
potential candidates, this man seemed the most interesting.  He's
handsome in a boyish sort of way, seemingly affable if slightly dorky. 
She's a little older than he is, more world-wise, more open to
experience and experiment.  They don't tell each other their names,
ages, professions, where they live.  It was meant to be nothing
personal.
After the round of interview footage, Affair goes back in time to their
first encounter at a cafe.  She's already booked a room.  Through a
series of nervous false starts, they make it through a halting
conversation.  At the hotel, it seems an eternity for the desk clerk to
ring up the man's credit card, then they take the long walk up the
stairs and down the hallway, through the bright red door.
It suddenly dawned on me that perhaps half an hour had gone by in the
blink of an eye.  I was utterly enthralled by every small nuance of this
encounter, every beat of silence.
Nathalie Baye's face is lined with age.  Perhaps she's in her mid-40s,
but very fit for a woman who might have mothered children.  Her eyes
flicker and dance, but she's not the type to give much away.  Bright,
courteous, sexually open - she's interesting even though we know very
little about her.  All we can tell, as the man freely admits, is that
she's a real woman.  In today's age where attractive girls are all
models and pin-ups, this film finds beauty in the normal lady walking
down the street.
Sergi López makes for a nice foil.  He's a little tubby and hairy, but
he doesn't take himself too seriously.  He has friendly, soft eyes, and
a mouth which is quick to smile.  At the first meeting, he's perhaps a
little more nervous than she.  He does order a cognac to brace himself.
Their first sexual encounter, which is built up to so vividly, remains
behind closed doors.  Maybe that's as it should be.  For a film about
sex, there isn't very much of it shown during the film.  In a way, this
makes it all the sweeter as we watch them during their second meeting at
the cafe.  Once more we don't see their amour.  After the hotel, that
second time, the man works up the courage to ask her to dinner later
that night.
On they go, never learning where the other lives.  They keep much as a
mystery from each other, but reveal enough to keep us interested.  Maybe
that's the nature of affairs, especially sexual ones.  The secrets.
The film runs a little over ninety minutes.  It's never dull.  I could
have done without the frequent voice-overs, which run over scenes where
I might have preferred to hear the naturalistic dialogue between the
lovers.  I'm also no big fan of self-conscious "interview" footage,
which only served to make me wonder how the documentarian tracked them
down.  These faults, while glaring, are forgiven because the rest of the
film feels so alluring, so sexy and smart.  They meet, they talk, they
make love and, slowly, grow closer.
There are many scenes where they talk frankly about sex.  As for the
actual onscreen lovemaking, it is kept to a minimum, but there's a
startling scene midway which has them in bed slowly working their way
toward orgasm.  This is not the sex of Hollywood gloss, or even of art
house decadence, or even of pornography.
Sex in American films is either a marathon, a farce, a music video, or a
tragedy.  An Affair of Love is all of the above, only less
self-important.  It's insubstantial, but that's pretty much the point. 
They only had what they had and the rest is in their memories.  So it is
for the viewer, too.  Maybe it's only worth a rental, but that's more
than what you'd expect walking in.

A woman (Nathalie Baye, "The Return of Martin Guerre") and a man
(Sergi Lopez, "Western") meet in a cafe.  After some nervous introductory
chitchat, they leave for a hotel where the woman has already reserved a
room.  This first successful meeting, a response to the woman's ad to act 
out a sexual fantasy, leads to regular weekly engagements, and maybe
something unexpected in "An Affair of Love."
This French language film by Belgian director Frederic Fonteyne
(screenplay by Philippe Blasband) is a compelling and unusual look at
both human interaction and the nature of love.  Fonteyne's protogonists
never learn each other's name, address or phone number and are almost 
exclusively only seen in a Parisian cafe, the hotel, and separately in 
interview sessions.
The documentary style interviews show she and he sometime later, both
looking different than they do in the flashbacks.  She recalls that they
met online and offered each other descriptions.  He says he responded to
her ad (he's kept the magazine as a souvenir) and they exchanged photographs.
She believes they met once or twice a week for 3-4 months while he says
they met weekly for half a year.  They both remember the emotional aspects
of their relationship, however, even more than the sex which presumably was
the only basis for their relationship.
Speaking of sex, for a film who's original title is "A Pornographic Affair,"
there's not a lot of sex shown in the film.  Usually, we're left behind
their hotel room door.  Significantly, the sex scenes which are shown, are
really love scenes.  The couple, who both refuse to divulge just what
the fantasy that was being acted upon was, decide to 'make love.'  "You mean
the missionary position?" he asks, startled and clearly pleased.
The couple reach a critical point when an old man collapses in the hallway
outside their hotel room.  He begs them not to contact his wife, whom he
hates.  They accompany the man to the hospital, then listen to his wife
(contacted by hospital authorities) grieve the loss of a man she knew
detested her.  For the first time, the outside world intrudes and it's
with the heavy subjects of marriage and death.
Fonteyne and his photographer, Virginie Saint-Martin, keep things intimate.
The color of the outside world leans to blues and grays, while the hotel
interior is a vibrant, sexy red.  Baye and Lopez are marvelously real 
together - their chemistry is deep.
"An Affair of Love" is a bittersweet small film where love is found by
dispensing with sexual courtship.

AN AFFAIR OF LOVE (Une Liaison Pornographique)
   Since French pictures features more talk, generally, than
those of other nationalities, it sure helps to know the
language.  Subtitles are functional, of course, but subtleties
are lost.  To prove this (unscientifically) I noted which
members of the audience seated around me at the French
Institute Alliance Francais were speaking the language taught
by the institute and which were conversing in plain old
English.  The former group laughed quite a bit more
throughout the brief, 80 minutes "An Affair of Love," a picture
which had formerly been entitled "A Pornographic Affair." 
When one of the officials of FIAF spoke briefly to introduce
the picture, she said, "This is not a pornographic film," the
sophisticated audience uttered an ironic "awwww."  Though
the movie centers on sex, this could be the least
pornographic film you're likely to see this year, almost to such
an extent that if just one scene were cut, a PG-13 rating
would be in order.
   First shown in the U.S. at the New Directors/New Films
festival at New York's Museum of Modern Art, the picture has
a history.  At the Venice Film Festival, Nathalie Baye won
best actress for her performance--which proves only that one
does not have to come on like a raging bull, Hollywood style,
to achieve a dramatic performance.  While her
accomplishment here has real merit in that the slightest tic or
movement of the eye or nervous gesture communicates
books about her feelings, the picture itself is pretentious.  Ms.
Baye and Sergi Lopez, who perform in the roles of "Her" and
"Him" respectively, do a lot more behind closed doors than
the Belgian-born director Frederic Fonteyne shows us, but
boy can they chatter.
   Executed in the format of a he-said-she-said
mockumentary, the story gets its impetus from an listing that
a woman (Nathalie Baye) places asking for a man who can
fill a sexual fantasy of hers.  A man (Barcelona-born Sergi
Lopez) answers the ad, counting on a one-night stand.  They
meet in a cafe, talk for bit with inevitable nervousness, and
head for a hotel around the corner which she had booked in
advance.  The doors close and we in the audience see
nothing.  We never do learn of the fantasy and in a closing
interview, the man tells the interrogator that even if he were
tortured, he would not reveal what the fantasy was.  Why? 
Who knows?  Who cares?  By the time the film ends, we
know as much about these characters as they learn about
each other during the months in which they meet every
Thursday--which is to say very little.  We never learn where
they live because she repeatedly refuses to accept a lift from
her Romeo.  We never learn their names.  We know only that
at one point, when they decide to have sex the "normal" way
(and we do see them going at it but discreetly, with the
woman finding an excuse to cover both completely with a
sheet), she decides that she loves him.  What happens after
she makes this confession is so odd that the audience can
scarcely help concluding that the whole darn episode is
affected.
   One online critic from Dublin with a more positive view tells
his readers "the honesty of the writing, as it takes the two
characters through a range of recognisable emotions and
personal foibles which consistently ring true, is matched by
the openness and honesty of the central performances."  If
this is an honest relationship, give me deviousness.  A
woman confesses her love and a man more or less goes
along, and you'd think that they'd introduce themselves. 
Such a conclusion is apparently not arty enough for scripter
Philippe Blasband in the Iranian-born writer's second feature
film done in collaboration with director Fonteyne.
Rated R.  Running time: 80 minutes.  (C) 2000 by

Titles for films serve a variety of purposes from grabbing the attention 
of potential viewers to giving them an expectation of what the movie 
will be like.  (Sometimes, of course, filmmakers confuse the public by 
devising ironic titles like HAPPINESS.)
The aptly named AN AFFAIR OF LOVE was originally called UNE LIAISON 
PORNOGRAPHIQUE (A PORNOGRAPHIC AFFAIR) when it was released in France.  
Both titles are true to the story, but A PORNOGRAPHIC AFFAIR is very 
misleading.  Those people who go expecting graphic sex will be quite 
disappointed, and those avoiding it because they think it is a porn 
movie will be deprived of seeing an extremely wise and interesting movie 
about adult relationships.  The story has more in common with MY DINNER 
WITH ANDRÉ than BASIC INSTINCT.
The movie starts with an off-screen interviewer (Jacques Viala) talking 
independently with "him" (Sergi López) and "her" (Nathalie Baye) about 
the relationship that they once had with each other.  (The two lead 
characters are known only by pronouns.  We know that they are both 
single but know little more about them.)  They have slightly different 
memories of their affair's frequency and duration.  Although from the 
beginning we know the story's arc, writer Philippe Blasband finds 
involving and sometimes surprising ways to get there.  Blasband comes up 
with an especially satisfying way to cause the affair to begin to 
unravel.    
Their affair starts with her putting an ad in a sexual magazine for a 
man to have a purely physical affair, a.k.a., a pornographic affair, 
with her.  He answers the ad, and they go to a hotel room which she has 
booked in advance.  They both call what they have their "fantasy."  What 
exactly this constitutes we'll never know for we are mainly confined to 
hanging around the hallway with the maid after they lock themselves in 
their room.  This leaves us to concentrate on the non-sexual part of 
their union.
Both actors accomplish more with subtle facial movements than through 
their dialog.  Well cast, the two middle-age actors are reasonably 
attractive but neither is beautiful.  The chemistry between them, which 
we witness usually as they have drinks at a bar near the hotel, is more 
genuine that 20 such would-be romances in traditional Hollywood films.  
Their relationship moves from a business associate-like politeness to 
genuine love, but the road is anything but smooth, especially since they 
agree to divulge nothing of their private lives to each other, not even 
their names.  
One of the most satisfying parts of the film occurs when they finally 
let us into their bedroom to watch them engage in sex, albeit not their 
fantasy act.  Most cinematic sex has naked model-quality individuals 
engaging in something that approximates auditions for World Wrestling 
Federation membership.  In contrast, director Frédéric Fonteyne has his 
actors truly making love, not sport.  A minor quibble would be their 
constant use of sheets to cover themselves.  A little more openness 
would have been appropriate.
What exactly was this fantasy of theirs, the interviewer demands to 
know.  He will say nothing.  She will only say that "it was an act of 
love."  And love is precisely what AN AFFAIR OF LOVE is about -- as well 
as the importance of good human communication, friendship, intimacy and 
even marriage.  It's a wonderfully touching film with a big and slightly 
bittersweet heart.  
AN AFFAIR OF LOVE runs an amazingly fast 1:20.  The film is in French 
with English subtitles.  It is rated R for some strong sexual content 
and would be acceptable for older teenagers.
