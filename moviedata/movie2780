   Some of my fellow critics wear other hats as interviewers. 
In addition to writing their pungent reviews, they take their
places either at roundtables or one-on-one's to chat with the
celebrities and then post their impressions on their web sites
or print media or radio programs.  Whenever they ask me
why I don't add such conferences to my scibbles, I answer
that the stars come out at night: when you see them across a
table under hotel lighting they lose their luster. They look
almost like normal, everyday people.  I want to look up to
them while they are larger than life on the big screen.  One of
my concerned colleagues followed up with an observation
that got me thinking: "What if an actor came to your interview
completely in character, make-up and all, and talked with you
as though he or she were still the person played in the
movie?"  Yep.  I'd welcome that.
   This is the very concept worked on successfully by E. Elias
Merhige in his "Shadow of the Vampire," a shocking, funny
work, wholly original in so many aspects of its execution. 
Avoiding the deadly dull talking-heads documentary style
while at the same time evoking the spirit of a great director,
"Shadow of the Vampire" is a largely fictionalized,
expressionistic portrait of F.W. Murnau, whose 1922 picture
"Nosferatu" became the model for all succeeding movies on
the Dracula theme. That was the picture that made Bela
Lugosi a far better-known name than Max Schreck, whose
toothy performance is the archetype.  Using an
unrecognizable Willem Dafoe in the role of the obscure
German actor Max Schreck and Steppenwolf-stepped
performer John Malkovich as F.W. Murnau, Merhige captures
the essence of an obsessed helmer pitted both with and
against a person who in real life may be no different from the
role he performs.  We see the "Nosferatu" movie in black and
white through the lens of Murnau's camera, shifting to color
when Merhige highlights the off-camera activities of the cast.
   The seven-feet-tall homosexual Murnau (who died in
a car accident en route from L.A. to Monterey at the age of
42) may not really resemble John Malkovich, who in this pix
is dolled up with yet another of the many rugs that a studio
cosmetics team pastes on the spirited actor's bald pate.  But
Willem Dafoe does an uncanny, off-the-wall, splendid
performance as Count Orlock--the name which Murnau gives
to the bloodsucker because Bram Stoker's estate had refused
him permission to make a movie from Stoker's novel,
"Dracula."  Murnau's "Nosferatu," the world's first vampire
movie, was distinguished as well by being shot on location
rather than wholly in studios--that latter being the more typical
method used by the German expressionist school of film
makers.
   Filmed in Luxembourg, "Shadow of the Vampire" deals with
the shooting of the film "Nosferatu" on location in Eastern
Europe.  Murnau has assembled a cast of performers and a
support crew who only some time into the shooting are
introduced to the title character played by the unknown Max
Schreck.  Who is this guy Schreck?  Schreck is an eccentric
person (to say the least), a figure with longer fingernails than
any U.S. parlor today would dare paste onto a fashionable
woman's fingers.  He frequently clicks the nails together,
particularly when he is entertaining obsessive thoughts about
the attractive and full-of-herself actress Greta Schroeder
(Catherine McCormack).  From time to time his eyes bulge,
accenting his amazingly long parrot-nose.  In both looks and
actions, he spooks everyone around him.  Murnau explains to
the crew that Schreck is a method actor who remains in
character at all times.  This becomes apparent to the most
thickheaded member of the cast when Schreck catches a bat
with his bare hands and devours the creature in seconds. 
During the daylight hours, he remains in a coffin.
   While the production notes reveal the secret of the bizarre
performer's identity, Merhige, using a clever script by Steven
Katz, would do well to conceal the man's singularity from the
audience.  Let the viewers guess whether the bald, pointy-
headed weirdo is in fact this obscure Max Schreck (who on
the stage was associated with Max Reinhardt's Berlin
company), or whether he is in fact undead, a creature who
has unlived a lonely and tortured existence for centuries.
   Merhige's direction of John Malkovich is fine, though
Malkovich does not take on the accent that would be
expected from the Bielefeld-born Friedrich Wilhelm Plumpe
Murnau.  Malkovich does convey the obsessiveness of the
director, whose camera was like his third eye--regularly
rolling, capturing details that are not in the "Nosferatu" script
even more eagerly than those which belong to the story he is
helming.  We do not, however, sense the fear that Murnau
must have borne whenever he believes that his count is not
really an actor's portrayal but an actual vampire determined
to make corpses of his crew.  Willem Dafoe, however, gives
an Oscar-worthy imitation of a vampire (?) portraying Max
Schreck who is portraying a vampire.  Dafoe seems to come
out of the twenties (whether we refer to the 1920s or the
1520s is up to the viewers to figure out).  The entire
expressionistic stylization emerges from his vividly ugly
features as he gives objective expression to inner experience
in the true mode of the German school.  "Shadow of the
Vampire" could well be considered the most compelling
vampire movie made since 1922. Imagine doing an interview
with an actor who not only stays in character but who actually
IS the character he portrays!  
Rated R.  Running time: 89 minutes.  (C) 2000 by

SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE  **1/2 (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (bill@filmfreakcentral.net)
starring John Malkovich, Willem Dafoe, Catherine McCormack, Eddie Izzard
screenplay by Steven Katz
directed by E. Elias Merhige
They certainly dressed the part, in those days. John Malkovich's reading of 
the eminent German filmmaker F.W. Murnau declares: "We are scientists 
engaged in the creation of memory." On set, before the lamps are fired up, 
Murnau and his crew don tinted goggles, looking as if they're about to 
commence atomic testing.
This was standard practice during cinema's formative years, when it took an 
intense amount of light to satisfactorily expose an image. (It was not 
uncommon for those who didn't take precautions to go blind later in life.) 
But Malkovich/Murnau is not describing costumes; he's probably, in fact, 
speaking for the makers of the gothic comedy in which he appears as a 
central figure, Shadow of the Vampire. Director E. Elias Merhige, working 
from a screenplay by Steven Katz, forges a new memoir of Nosferatu, 
Murnau's take on Bram Stoker's Dracula that was rumoured to star a real 
vampire.
Said quote defends the existence of Shadow of the Vampire with mock 
pretension, and it recognizes the outlandish notion that someone might 
accept Merhige's movie at face value, just as Gladiator has probably 
inspired audience members everywhere to query "Maximus" at their favourite 
search engines. And for the duration that Merhige and Katz have tongues 
planted firmly in cheek, their efforts are generously funny, even if some 
of the humour seems anachronistic (there are big laughs at the expense of 
writers and students of the Stanislavsky Method, both of which can be found 
in any send-up of modern Hollywood). Take Willem Dafoe, unrecognizable 
beneath thick latex as Max Schreck, the bloodsucking lead in Murnau's 
production. The uniquely charming actor, one of the few to not embarrass 
himself in portraying Jesus Christ, isn't only asked to deliver jokes in a 
Transylvania 6-5000 accent: his Schreck spoofs the archetypal tragic 
vampyr--Dafoe is playing a mostly cranky, forgetful old man whose major 
affliction is an empty stomach.
Merhige also subverts Weimar-era artistic types with a general tweaking of 
Murnau's clan. Shadow of the Vampire depicts an egotistical helmer who 
doles out information to his peers on a need-to-know basis, a diva starlet 
(Catherine McCormack) with more, but no less insincere, respect for the 
theatre, an alcoholic, Aryan flyboy cameraman (Cary Elwes, channelling 
Klaus Kinski?), and so on. There is the implication, not made strongly 
enough, that Schreck is the most harmless vampire of them all, and even the 
suggestion is indicative of Shadow of the Vampire's reductionist leanings. 
The characters are more behaviourally than conceptually effective--thank 
goodness for the unvaryingly fine performances. I'd love to join the 
critical community in their unanimous adoration of the film, but it occurs 
to me the film's premise has one note and strikes it half-heartedly.
While Merhige nails the nuances of a fascinating period in twentieth 
century history (save a passage of dialogue that equates Murnau's greatness 
with Eisenstein's, who wasn't known at the time of Nosferatu)--the 
painstaking recreation of Murnau's hand-cranked footage is particularly 
arresting--I sympathized a bit too dearly with Schreck, who desires flesh; 
I yearned for something more fleshed-out than this bizarro sitcom. 
Additionally, Shadow of the Vampire is faced with the dilemma of having to 
end, and this is when faux self-importance gives way to something blurrier. 
A witty, not-scathing-enough satire turns nasty and alienatingly 
moralistic. The gifted Merhige should have listened to the advice of many a 
scientist before him: "Back to the drawing board." (--- For more first-run,

In this age of digital filmmaking, Shadow of the Vampire is a love
letter to the beautiful mechanism of a motion picture camera.  There's
something both tactile and mysterious about images created on a thin
sliver of film guided through a series of loops and pins.  The final
product is run through another instrument with wheels and sprockets, the
projector.  As the movie flickers across a silver screen, it's not too
much of a stretch imagining the director whispering, "I gave you life."
That's the implied joke throughout Shadow of the Vampire, the strange
and fanciful projection of what might have occurred during production of
that classic 1922 German horror film, Nosferatu - A Symphony of Terror.
This silent film was plagued with financial troubles, crew member
disappearances and deaths, and the constant threat of being sued by Bram
Stoker's widow for ripping off Dracula after failing to secure the
rights.  Given the scant amount of reliable historical information,
screenwriter Steven Katz takes some enormous liberties, playfully
delving into the surreal and supernatural.
At a brisk 93 minutes, Shadow of the Vampire is light on its feet.  Have
patience through the incredibly long and pretentious opening credits,
complete with music that can best be described as "eerie and
foreboding."
Obsessed with realism, director F.W. Murnau (John Malkovich) drags his
small production unit to the outskirts of rural Germany to shoot
Nosferatu in an authentic location.  His real coup is casting the
elusive Max Schreck, a method actor who will appear on set only at
night, and only in full costume and makeup.
Having had no real experience before Murnau started shooting Nosferatu,
Shadow of a Vampire plays with the notion that Schreck's creature-actor
suddenly popped into existence: Art creates life, or a monster.  In a
role this Wooster Group-trained actor has been preparing for all his
life, Willem Dafoe plays the vampire with a mixture of childlike tics
and grand gestures.  Academy voters take note, his Schreck is both diva
and curious child.  Almost every scene he's in would make a fine Oscar
clip.
The cast and crew raise a collective eyebrow at Schreck's bizarre
technique but are undeniably impressed when he makes his first memorable
appearance from the shadows.  In the nights that follow, members of the
crew begin to fall into a deep sickness.  While Murnau frets over his
financial troubles, Schreck begins to take bites out of his fellow
actors.  Murnau, caring only for the completion of his picture, offers
petty threats to Schreck such as, "You shall have no close-ups!  None!" 
In response, Schreck only waves his talons and sneers through his two
fanged front teeth.  Feh.
Shadow's director, E. Elias Merhige, uses Murnau's visual approach as
inspiration.  The train montage, set against a blood red sunset, is a
particularly brilliant juxtaposition of canted low angles and mystical
landscapes.  There is frequent use of stock footage (from the Murnau
film), but more often Merhige recreates the black-and-white silent film
instead.  As Murnau's actors carry on with their sweeping gestures, the
director rambles on with elaborate and colorful directions.  ("You have
had a very nice sleep, Gustav!  How about a nice stretch?  That's good
-- now read your letter.  Laugh at the silly superstitions of the
locals!")
Not surprisingly, the monster Schreck is more sympathetic than its
creator Murnau.  The director is so callous he mutters, "We have
achieved pathos," after filming a functionary scene involving the
heroine petting her cat.  John Malkovich, who recently discovered the
joy of acting again after several years of bored stock mannerisms, is
appropriately glib and nasty throughout.
How about a round of applause for casting director Carl Proctor, who has
filled out the supporting cast with terrific character actors?  Strong
impressions are made by Udo Kier as the harried producer, Cary Elwes as
the square jawed cameraman, and scene stealing Eddie Izzard as
Nosferatu's foppish romantic lead.  The art direction by Chris Bradley
also deserves special mention for capturing the German expressionist
"look" of Murnau's films without going over-the-top into caricature.
The final scene may divide audiences, but the movie really doesn't have
much of a point without it, a sudden and unexpected delve into the
fantastic, followed by an abrupt cut to black which nails the coffin
shut.  Playful and anachronistic, it's an appropriate fate for the
characters of Murnau and Schreck.  Without blowing the surprise, it's
safe to say that Shadow of the Vampire references the old mantra: "It's
only a movie."

PLOT:
Based on some actual events and a healthy dose of make-believe, this story
takes a behind-the-scenes look at director F.W. Murnau's making of
NOSFERATU. With all of the cast and crew on board, the director brings in an
unknown to play the lead vampire. The man in question likes to remain in
character at all times, and ultimately draws fear from others on the set.
The question now becomes, is he really a vampire or just a method actor
"becoming" the part?
CRITIQUE:
A film that is sure to appeal to the art-house crowds more than the mass
audiences, this film gives us a super-creepy performance by Willem Dafoe,
some very cool atmosphere, a unique style of direction and an okay story. I
wasn't bowled over by this story because it was difficult for me to come to
grips with the whole reality vs fantasy elements of this movie. I mean, the
film is obviously based on real people, a real movie and a real movie
production, but many of its elements are purely fantasy-based and made up,
so I was sorta left scratching my head at certain points (if you see someone
grab a bat and devour it right in front of you, wouldn't you "kinda" think
that he "might" be a vampire?). I guess I would have rather seen the whole
film made completely as a fantasy or an ED WOOD type scenario, in which all
of the actual events are portrayed, but this point didn't really spoil my
viewing. In fact, I quite enjoyed the movie as a whole, loved the way
Merhige shot the actual scenes in color and then transformed them into black
and white when the "film within the film" began to shoot, and appreciated
the dark and mysterious mood of it all. But I guess that I might've been
expecting a little too much in the first place.
Critic or not, I am but a person, and that definitely happens sometimes,
especially when you've heard about a movie for such a long time, and
anticipate it so. This is the kind of movie that I, or anyone else for that
matter, will likely enjoy more on video or DVD. It's slow-paced and doesn't
really follow any conventional arc of a story, feeling much more like a
documentary based on the possible events of a film production, rather than
an actual film created to entertain. In fact, the film is original in that
sense, since it rarely possesses any real thrills, suspense, romance, humor
or action, but does still manage to keep you interested throughout (well, at
least it did me). I definitely don't think this film will work for everyone,
and it certainly won't work for anyone looking for a horror type of movie,
or a slasher with blood, etc... In fact, this movie barely sheds one drop of
any blood. It's really much more about the ambiguous nature of the lead
character and the full extent that the director is willing to go in order to
get his film made. Does that sound interesting to you? If yes, check the
movie out. If you're not really interested in that aspect of the film, and
don't particularly care to see one of the most bizarre portrayals of a "man"
on screen in the past few years, that would be Willem Dafoe, I'd say skip it
altogether.
I liked it and I certainly look forward to catching it again on DVD real
soon. And if the Academy doesn't toss Dafoe a nomination for this memorable
role, it will all but assure the fact that they're filled with a bunch of
dodos (since we all expect them to diss Christian Bale as well).

     In his twilight years, sitting around the old actors' home, Willem 
Dafoe is not going to have to complain "I never got to really go over 
the top."  As Max Schreck, the ghoulish actor who created the 
unforgettable vampire in  F.W. Murnau's silent classic Nosferatu (1922), 
Dafoe pulls out all the stops, and he does it with a cackling, 
irresistible glee that goes straight for the jugular. 
     Shadow of the Vampire is writer Steven Katz and director E. Elias 
Merhige's riff on the making of Nosferatu, the first vampire movie and 
still the creepiest.  You get a bit of a history lesson with the price 
of admission; up to a point the movie draws on the facts of that 
landmark production.  Murnau was denied permission to adapt Bram 
Stoker's Dracula by the author's widow, a problem he solved by changing 
the title and rechristening his vampire Count Orlok.  Murnau also 
revolutionized movie-making by taking his camera out of the studio and 
going on location.  The names of the cast and crew are faithfully 
observed, as is the look of the period, down to the actors' makeup and 
the dusters and goggles worn by Murnau and his henchmen.
    And then there's Schreck, and here the filmmakers let the dogs of 
their imaginations run free.  Murnau's background was with the great Max 
Reinhardt's Berlin Staatstheater, and so was Schreck's, as far as we 
know.  In Shadow, Murnau (John Malkovich) tells his company that the 
actor he has hired to play Count Orlok is from Reinhardt's theater, but 
this guy is from Berlin the way the Coneheads were from France.  He's a 
disciple of Stanislavsky, Murnau says to explain why the actor is not 
around for the studio scenes; Schreck has traveled ahead to the Czech 
location to steep himself in the atmosphere, and he will only be seen in 
makeup and character.  (The name Schreck translates as "fear" or 
"horror".) 
     There's some self-consciousness to the exposition in the early 
scenes, which often happens when the filmmakers have a menu of 
information to serve.  But there are also generous helpings of clever 
writing and some marvelously atmospheric visual schemes, with the good 
easily outweighing the awkward.  There is also sound philosophy.  When 
the producer complains that the locals who will fill the background 
roles don't know how to act, Murnau replies "They don't need to act; 
they need to be."  And "We are scientists engaged in the creation of 
memory, but our memories will neither blur nor fade" is an observation 
that carries a twist of pathos now that so many early films have 
deteriorated beyond repair. 
      Shadow is more delicious fun than classic horror.  It's an 
allegory of the filmmaking process, but it doesn't let anything so 
abstract get in the way of its entertainment.  Merhige and Katz seize 
hold of their idea and drive it with clear-eyed relish from start to 
finish.

The legend of Max Schreck is ... well, legendary.  The unknown actor
virtually came from nowhere to land the role of the vampire in the
classic 1922 film Nosferatu.  According to myth, Schreck wasn't just
pretending to be a bloodsucker  he actually was one of the undead.  The
new film Shadow of the Vampire brings the legend of Schreck to the big
screen over 70 years after the creepy actor put his unique stamp on what
many consider to be the greatest portrayal of a vampire ever.
But how successful can a film be with no A-list stars, a mediocre
actor-turned-producer (Nicolas Cage), a no-name director, a first-time
screenwriter, a miniscule running time (most of which seem to be burned
during the opening credits) and the presence of Udo Kier?  The answer is
`moderately."  Vampire is a sloppy mess of a film, really corny, and a
lot of fun to watch.  It also boasts what should be a lock for a Best
Supporting Actor nomination at next year's Academy Awards in Willem
Dafoe, who plays the spindly Schreck to eerie perfection.  Kudos should
also be given to the people responsible for transforming Dafoe into
Schreck.
John Malkovich (Being John Malkovich) plays Nosferatu director F.W.
Murnau, who wanted to make a film based on Bram Stoker's `Dracula,' but
Stoker's wife Florence refused to give him permission.  Murnau created
his own vampire character in Nosferatu, swapping Count Dracula for Count
Orlock.  His film, which was silent, followed a simple story involving a
German real estate agent (played here by Eddie Izzard, Velvet Goldmine)
and his fiancée (Catherine McCormack, Dangerous Beauty) who meet up with
a potential client in Orlock (Dafoe, American Psycho).
In Vampire, Schreck is presented to the cast and crew of Nosferatu as
one of the craft's first method actors.  Murnau explains that Schreck
will only appear in full costume and makeup, and, because of his kooky
requirements, insists they only shoot at night.  You don't see
Shreck/Orlock until nearly 30 minutes into the film, which, given the
running time here, is a significant portion of the movie.  But when he
finally emerges from the shadows, it's quite startling.  Where most
screen portrayals of vampires have opted for creating a brooding
lady-killer character, Vampire instead shows Schreck/Orlock as a bald,
overgrown rat with impossibly long fingernails and gimpy little arms
that hang above his chest like a bat.
Vampire mainly shows the trouble Murnau had keeping the bloodthirsty
Schreck in line during the filming of Nosferatu.  When the
cinematographer dies of a mysterious ailment (and two tiny puncture
wounds in his neck), Murnau is forced to depart the set to find another
cameraman, which leaves Schreck unsupervised with the rest of the film
crew.  In order to keep Schreck from wreaking total havoc on the set,
Murnau promises to `give' the morphine-addicted female lead to Schreck
once the filming is completed, provided he behaves himself.  The finale
is as madcap as you would expect from a success-hungry director, a
hophead and a vampire pretending to be an actor pretending to be a
vampire.
While most of the Vampire seems haphazardly slapped onto film, it does
do a great job recreating the look and feel of a silent film with the
use of title cards and the shift from black-and-white to color stock.
The story, which was written by debut screenwriter Steven Katz (he
penned part one of HBO's From the Earth to the Moon), is unnecessarily
messy for a film this length.  Vampire was directed by E. Elias Merhige,
whose only previous film credit was the 1991 horror flick, Begotten.  An
interesting note  Max Schreck is the name of the villain in Batman
Returns (played by Christopher Walken).

"Shadow of the Vampire" has such an inventive, original idea that I am almost 
willing to recommend it based on its premise. Unfortunately, like most great 
ideas, it does not fully exploit it for all its worth, and seems to skim past 
some missed opportunities resulting in a fairly bland movie that may please 
some movie buffs, yet will mostly annoy everyone else. 
"Shadow of the Vampire" is a fictional behind-the-scenes look at the making 
of one of the greatest, most realistic vampire films ever made, "Nosferatu," 
which was released back in 1922. John Malkovich stars as F.W. Murnau, the 
madly eccentric, madly obsessed film director of "Nosferatu," itself based on 
the famed Bram Stoker novel though changes were made to avoid being sued by 
Stoker's widow. As the film begins, Murnau has just completed studio shots 
for his latest endeavor ("Thank God, an end to this artifice!"), and is ready 
to shoot outdoor night shots in the countryside and on an island to capture 
the necessary realism for the tale. All they need is a vampire and Murnau has 
found one, an actor named Max Schreck (Willem Dafoe) who lives in an 
abandoned monastery. Murnau claims the actor studied under Stanislavsky from 
the Max Reindhardt troupe. The crew is afraid of this gauntlike, bald 
creature who fits the role all too well, and needs no makeup! Gradually, we 
discover that Schreck is not an actor at all, he is a real vampire and has 
his eye on the lead actress Greta Schroeder (Catherine McCormack), who will 
have herself sacrificed to the vampire in the final scene of the script!
Murnau knows Schreck is a vampire and their unusual contract stipulates that 
Schreck continue his feeding habits until after the shoot (a bottle of blood 
and small animals are used as alternative food items). Naturally, Schreck is 
too hungry for blood and ends up devouring not only bats but the neck of a 
cinematographer. He also has the desperate need to acquire the neck of Greta. 
The contract is unheeded but it doesn't seem to matter - Murnau has become so 
obsessed with his opus that he hardly cares about anyone and appears as 
monstrous as the creature himself. 
The pacing is off in "Shadow of the Vampire" as the transitions between 
scenes seem choppy at best. This makes the overall film rather monotonous 
until Dafoe shows up, and he brings the film out of its drunken stupor with 
his vibrantly alive performance. It is still not enough as the visual style 
of the film seems unimaginative with grainy colors and several darkly lit 
scenes. Some of the black-and-white scenes of the actual filming of the 
film-within-the-film are wonderful yet brief. 
As written by newcomer Steven Katz, "Shadow of the Vampire" has scant 
evidence of insight into Murnau's crew members and Murnau's private life - we 
just see that he is a morphine addict who envisions cinema as "everlasting 
life." Malkovich mostly yells  but there is not much more to his performance 
(his intoxicatingly emotional final scene is exceptionally well done). It 
also doesn't help that the film makes a case for the similarity between 
vampires and filmmakers - they are out to sell their souls to bring life into 
their own encapsulated world, or as Murnau exclaims, "It does not exist 
unless it is in the lens." I just don't see the overall connection as being 
fully realized as it should have been. 
The rest of the cast is perfunctory at best. Eddie Izzard as the Jonathan 
Harker character barely has much screen time and mysteriously disappears from 
the film. Catherine McCormack has a few breathtaking moments as Greta and we 
understand that her character chooses the theatre over cinema, but that is 
it. Cary Elwes is unmemorable as the substitute cinematographer (he also 
appeared in Coppola's "Dracula"), and Udo Kier (a former Warhol regular) 
merely glides by the screen as the financially obsessed producer. Kier does 
have a funny scene where he describes having once seen someone pull ectoplasm 
out of their mouth. 
That leaves Dafoe who gives a tour-de-force performance as the enigmatic 
Schreck. He gyrates, frowns, smiles, has arch-like eyebrows, long 
fingernails, and a general frailty that lends sympathy to the "rat-like 
bastard," as Murnau excitedly claims while shooting a scene. Dafoe projects 
such a chilling, eerie demeanor that you can't help but be both frightened 
and fascinated by him. It is such a superb performance that one must see it 
just to believe it. The film, though, is a mere shadowy reflection of what 
made "Nosferatu" the silent classic it is today.

Is E. Elias Merhige's SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE a vampire movie, or is it a 
movie about a vampire movie or is it a spoof of a vampire movie?  Yes.  
And the film, which stars John Malkovich as director F.W. Murnau and an 
unrecognizable Willem Dafoe as "actor" Max Schreck, who "plays" the 
vampire Count Orlock, is deliciously funny as it takes itself quite 
seriously.  The clever script by first-time screen writer Steven Katz 
manages to eschew gore and rely instead on a wickedly humorous 
relationship between Murnau and the vampire, with whom Murnau has made a 
Faustian bargain.
In 1921 in Eastern Europe, Murnau is making a movie called NOSFERATU, 
starring a real vampire, who is given the stage name of Max Schreck.  
Not telling his crew the truth, Murnau, a lab jacket wearing director 
whom the crew refers to as Herr Doctor, explains that Schreck is such an 
intense method actor that he wears no make-up, works only at night and 
is to be called only by his character's name of Count Orlock.    
The director approaches the movie as if he were a blend of Sir Isaac 
Newton and Cecil B. DeMille.  "We are scientifically engaged in the 
creation of memory," he lectures those around him.  After Murnau enlists 
local peasants for supporting roles, his producer, Albin Grau (Udo 
Kier), complains that they can't act, but the director sets him 
straight.  "They don't need to act," Murnau barks at him.  "They need to 
be."
Actors in silent movies were forced to use exaggerated gestures in order 
to compensate for the absence of language.  Dafoe, in a performance 
worthy of Oscar consideration, has a blast chewing up the scenery in the 
silent movie-within-the-movie in which he spends a large portion of his 
screen time.  With knobby, pencil-like fingers, long, gray fingernails, 
dog-eaten ears and a bald head like a small meteorite, Dafoe looks so 
funny that you're ready to laugh before he even moves or speaks.
As the crew becomes suspicious, the producer confronts the director, 
demanding to know more about their lead actor.  On location for his 
first scene, the count emerges from a stone hole as the camera rolls.  
"Where did you find him really," the producer insists.  "In that hole," 
the director replies, matter-of-factly.
The best part of the film is the bombastic chemistry between vampire and 
director.  "I'd like some make-up," the count squeaks before filming 
starts.  "Well, you don't get any!" his director chides him as a parent 
would a bad boy.  In another, Murnau gets angry at his star for eating 
important members of the crew, which means that the production company 
has to bear the cost of replacing them.  "Why don't you eat the script 
girl?" Murnau suggests, since she is more expendable.  "The script 
girl," the count says, pausing to think, "I'll eat her later."   
Since in real life F.W. Murnau was a famous director who did indeed make 
a film called NOSFERATU, perhaps SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE is more than a 
mere comedy.  Maybe it all happened just this way.  As they say, fact is 
stranger than fiction.
SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE runs a fast 1:32.  It is rated R for some 
sexuality, drug content, violence and language and would be acceptable 
for teenagers.

It's the early 1920s and German silent filmmaker F.W. Murnau is about to
make the world's first vampire movie. His script is ready and he's
assembled a top-notch cast and crew willing to follow him on an eerie
location shoot in Eastern Europe. What they don't know is that, in order
to make his production as realistic as possible, Murnau has done
something quite unusual. For the crucial lead role in the horror epic,
he's hired a real vampire.
"Shadow of the Vampire" takes a skewed look at the making of the seminal
film, "Nosferatu," and the determination of the legendary director
behind it. While the movie fumbles when trying to make grand statements
about the creative process, it works very well as a straightforward
black comedy and homage to early cinema.
"Nosferatu" seems a natural for fanciful speculation. Details are
sketchy on the life of F.W. Murnau, who made 22 films before dying in a
car wreck at the age of 42 (according to Kenneth Anger's "Hollywood
Babylon," the driver of the car was an underage Filipino lad that Murnau
was "servicing" when the Packard leapt off the road). Murnau based his
most well-known film on Bram Stoker's "Dracula," but had to change the
character names due to legal problems with Stoker's estate. So Count
Dracula became Count Orlock, a feral thing light years from the elegant
Prince of Darkness that became a cinema standard a decade later. Orlock
was played by Max Schreck, once described as "an actor of little
distinction." Virtually nothing is known about the man.
Screenwriter Steven Katz found the mystery captivating. "About 10 or 11
years ago I became very interested in 'Nosferatu,'" he said. "I
especially liked the fact that the film looks incredibly realistic  to
the point that you almost think you are watching an old documentary
about a vampire. I then got the idea of what would happen if the actor
playing the vampire in the film was really a vampire. As it happens,
Schreck is the German word for shriek or fright  it seemed a little too
pat. I started to do some research on Murnau and I saw this amazing
picture of him filming  all his crew were wearing lab coats and
goggles. From that I got the idea of Murnau really treating the whole
thing as a documentary, as a scientific project."
Enter "Shadow of the Vampire" director E. Elias Merhige, who dutifully
outfits his "filmmakers" in lab coats and goggles while recreating the
look of "Nosferatu." The story is as simple as the conceit is ingenious,
following the production of the film, with Murnau explaining to his cast
that Schreck is a fiercely dedicated method actor, trained by
Stanislavsky himself, who will only appear in full make-up, at night,
while remaining in character. In fact, Murnau has cut a deal with his
vampire star; if he behaves until the film is completed, he will be
rewarded with the leading lady's neck. Schreck can't manage to control
himself, of course, leading to horror and gallows humor as Murnau
struggles to finish his opus before his star finishes the cast and crew.
None of this could work without the right actors and "Shadow of the
Vampire" boasts a fine group, led by John Malkovich as Murnau and Willem
Dafoe as Schreck. Actually, the teaming of Malkovich and Dafoe, two
phenomenally talented, but decidedly creepy performers, is a scary
notion all by itself. Had Merhige also hired Steve Buscemi and
Christopher Walken, he could have made a horror film without a script
simply by outfitting the four men in black and saying, "Okay boys,
mingle."
Malkovich is at his reptilian best as the perfectionist director, but is
burdened by having to recite lines intended to make a statement about
creative obsession, stilted lines like "If it isn't in the frame, it
doesn't exist." Dafoe, on the other hand, gets to deliver one juicy
sentence after another in the role of a lifetime. He finds the perfect
pitch for Schreck, playing the character broadly without ever going over
the top. In one wonderful scene, he explains that the romance of the
Dracula novel saddens him, because real vampires, by nature, end up
detached from mankind. "Can he even remember how to buy bread?" Schreck
muses. "How to select wine and cheese?" At that moment, the monster
becomes more human than anyone else in the story, which highlights the
weakness of the film.
Despite a tendency to confuse glibness with substance, "Shadow of the
Vampire" is still a treat, courtesy of its clever premise, rich music
and cinematography, and an enthusiastic cast gleefully overdoing their
German accents. Fans of "Nosferatu" can rejoice. Thanks to the
extraordinary efforts of Willem Dafoe, Max Schreck lives.

Summary: r.a.m.r. #28092
Keywords: author=polenz
A quasi docudrama/quasi horror movie about the making of a classic vampire 
movie, "Nosferatu" in Germany in the 1920s. John Malkovich plays an obsessive 
director who goes for as much detail as you could possibly get out of dreary, 
grainy black and white film and no sound. Willem Dafoe plays Max Schreck, an 
"actor" playing the role of the Dracula character who isn't wearing making 
and isn't method acting - he really is a vampire! The story shows how Schreck 
is a lonely old man who just happens to fit the mold of the vampire cliche we 
know today. He scares the bejesus out of the cast and has a taste for human 
blood while Malkovich films him for authenticity purposes. You're supposed to 
wonder who's the bigger nut - the vampire pretending to be an actor playing 
the role of a vampire or the director for exploiting him. This is obviously 
meant to be a thinking man's horror film since the scariness is derived from 
these strange men's behavior but it never really comes across that way. 
The art direction and production design give a totally realistic, authentic 
look of the heydays of B&W silent movies and the equipment and sets the film 
crews had to work with at the time. When the scenes of the movie within the 
movie are shot the frame closes to a 3:2 ratio with a very grainy, dreary 
picture - the exact opposite of digital remastering. It's a poetic homage to 
the past and a gutsy technique to use in this day and age. Malkovich and 
Dafoe also give excellent performances but as good as they are, they can't 
carry the movie entirely by themselves. 
I'm a big appreciator of ambiguity and the concept that true terror is based 
on what our five senses can't pick up on. "Shadow Of The Vampire" is meant to 
appeal to our sixth sense so that we're frightened by the fact a REAL vampire 
is playing the role of one in a movie and does things a real vampire would 
do. Yes, Dafoe is excellent in his role but he's not scary or disturbing, 
he's just weird. Maybe I'm just cynical because I'm used to more mainstream 
fare, but this movie only has a few good moments and isn't great throughout. 
There's not enough characterization of the supporting cast, there's a lot of 
details missing from the main plot, the suspenseful sequences are a little 
trite and the ending is forgettable. 
The running time is only 85 minutes or so - that tells you a lot right there. 
For a docudrama to work you need to spend a lot more time with the characters 
- get to know them personally and intimately. We never do that with this 
troupe. Everyone's just kind of a tool to make the plot payoff. Throughout 
"Shadow Of The Vampire" there's many many hints of personal drama and inner 
demons to the characters but the screenplay can't balance the story with 
characterization. One minute we're on the set of the movie, the next it's 
some personal subplot that never comes to fruitation and doesn't have a lot 
of significance overall. 
This is one of those movies where you know exactly what the filmmakers were 
trying to do and you still don't enjoy it. A mediocre product but a good 
effort nevertheless. 
RATING: ** (out of **** = fair/below average)

Directed by E Elias Merhige. Screenplay by Steven Katz. Starring John
Malkovich, Willem Dafoe, Cary Elwes. Running time: 90 minutes. Rated AA by
the MFCB. Reviewed on April 8th, 2001.
Though it may seem hard to believe, movies have now been around for more 
than a century. One of the interesting phenomena accompanying this 
venerability is that the dawn of film history has begun to pass into 
modern mythology; names like Valentino and Griffiths seem as ancient and 
as far removed from the present day as Abraham Lincoln and Queen Victoria. 
As a result, cinema's early years have become fair game for speculative 
fiction: stories that wonder "what if" things had been just a little 
different.
"Shadow Of The Vampire" is just such a movie, depicting the making of the 
1922 German classic "Nosferatu", one of the earliest and most renowned 
horror pictures. Although "Nosferatu" does not quite date from the start 
of the film era, its mystique was amplified when the estate of Bram Stoker 
successfully sued its makers, claiming (quite rightly) that "Nosferatu" 
was a thinly-veiled reworking of Stoker's seminal novel "Dracula". An
effort was then made to purge all extant prints of "Nosferatu", and while 
some copies have (fortunately) survived, it has helped give the movie a 
legend all its own.
Even without it, "Nosferatu" would still be an ideal subject for this kind 
of film. It is, after all, a vampire movie made in the very Eastern 
European locales where vampire myths first arose. It features a rivetting, 
convincing performance by Max Schreck as the bloodsucking Count Orlok (or 
Orlock, a spelling disparity given sly reference -- one I can only assume 
was intentional -- by the makers of "Shadow"). And so effective was the 
make-up transforming Schreck into the baleful Orlok that it stands up even 
by today's standards.
In "Shadow", then, writer Steven Katz asks the obvious question: what if 
Max Schreck really was a vampire -- or, more specifically, "a vampire 
playing an actor playing a vampire"?
To explore the notion, Katz focusses on director FW Murnau (played by John 
Malkovich), who is painted here as a zealous, almost fanatical artist. 
Katz's point is clear: the medium of film can be every bit as 
life-draining as a vampire, and the director's fangs are far more deadly 
than those of any creature of the night. Murnau stalks about his sets and 
locations, often clad in dark glasses, looking every bit as fearsome as 
his star. For Murnau, there is nothing more important than the realisation 
of his vision. He will take any measures necessary to ensure that 
"Nosferatu" is completed, even making a deal with the devil; and, for all 
intents and purposes, he has.
In the fictional reality of "Shadow Of The Vampire", Murnau has sought out 
a genuine vampire (Willem Dafoe) living in the wilds of Hungary. Murnau 
christens him "Max Schreck" and pretends he is an old acting acquaintance. 
He explains Schreck's idiosyncrasies and bizarre appearance by claiming 
that Schreck is a consummate performer who totally immerses himself in his 
role, to the extent of not even removing his "costume". Schreck, 
meanwhile, has his own motivations, and soon begins to prey upon the cast 
and crew of "Nosferatu", putting not just the production at risk, but also 
the lives of all those involved.
Malkovich is terrific as the obsessed Murnau, but it is Dafoe who steals 
the show. His realisation of the vampire is unforgettable, neatly 
capturing the essence of the real Schreck's performance and extending it 
naturally to flesh out a full character. Dafoe completely eschews the 
suave modern vampires of Anne Rice and Joss Whedon; his Schreck is barely 
removed from vermin, constantly clicking his enormous claws and thinking 
of little more than his hunger. It would be an oversight not to also 
mention the work of make-up designer Pauline Fowler and her team. They 
have done a phenomenal job recreating the original "Nosferatu" design and,
moreover, making Schreck seem like a real, (un)living creature.
Under the guidance of director E Elias Merhige, "Shadow" successfully 
transports us back to the 1920s. This is particularly evident in Merhige's 
use of clips from "Nosferatu" itself. Rather than contrasting with 
Merhige's own footage, this material fits into "Shadow" seamlessly. And 
while "Shadow" is ultimately a dark comedy, Merhige does not let this 
interfere with the fearful, oppressive atmosphere he crafts: the two 
aspects of the picture work together to impact the viewer instead of 
diminishing each other.
Consider, for example, a terrific sequence in which Schreck joins other 
crewmembers who are drinking around a fire. The crew, still believing that 
Schreck is merely an actor who has immersed himself in his vampire 
"character", asks his opinion of "Dracula". Schreck responds that he views 
the novel as a tragedy, and cites the seemingly innocuous scene where 
Dracula prepares his dining room for Harker's arrival. Schreck views this 
with sadness because he sees it as a reminder of all that Dracula (and, by 
extension, himself) has forgotten in the centuries since he lost his 
humanity. And then, if this weren't bizarre enough, he grabs a bat out of 
the air and feasts upon it. Should we laugh? Should we be frightened? 
Merhige successfully inspires both emotions, no mean feat to be sure.
It is unfortunate, then, that "Shadow" gradually loses its way as the 
movie progresses. Like a particularly grotesque "Saturday Night Live" 
sketch, Katz and Merhige seem to run out of ideas of where to take their 
premise next. As a result, the film's final reel feels distinctly 
fragmented, with ideas and new characters (such as Cary Elwes' 
cinematographer, introduced when Schreck feeds on his predecessor) coming 
seemingly at random.
The ending is particularly disappointing, its unrelenting savagery 
delivering a poor climax to an original and intelligent concept. It also 
represents a major deviation from established movie history. The best 
speculative fiction leaves us with the lingering suspicion that maybe, 
just maybe, such events really could have taken place. "Shadow Of The 
Vampire" just makes us glad that they didn't.

In 1921, the great German film director F.W. Murnau shot "Nosferatu"
with his singular star Max Schreck as Count Orlok.  So little is known
about Schreck, that screenwriter Steven Katz and director E. Elias Merhige
("Begotten") suggest the fantastical - what if Schreck really *was* a
vampire - in their new film "Shadow of the Vampire."
F.W. Murnau was a fascinating man.  A seven foot tall homosexual, he
was a true artist, covering theater, writing, music as well as film.
The young Alfred Hitchcock journeyed from London to Germany to learn from
him.  Murnau died in a Hollywood car crash shrouded in mystery at the peak 
of his career.  He had helped create and epitomized the German Expressionism
movement in film.
Merhige professes to wanting to delve into the director, the method actor,
the camera itself as vampire with "Shadow of a Vampire," but that seems just
a hairsbreadth away from the 'camera and audience as voyeur' theme which has
been explored by the likes of Hitchcock and William Powell ("Peeping Tom").
Not only does he not provide any new insights with his vampiric filmmaking
study, he gives us a one dimensional Murnau (John Malkovich).
The film opens with a title card (credit to Merhige for recreating the
silent film) informing us that "Nosferatu" is being shot in 1921.  The
drug addicted diva Greta Schroeder (Catherine McCormack, "Braveheart")
is petulant about leaving the stage sets for Murnau's remote locations
(he advises her to make a sacrifice for her art, ahem).
The troupe, including Udo Kier ("Andy Warhol's Dracula") as producer Albin
Grau, Eddie Izzard ("Mystery Men") as actor Gustav von Wangenheim and
Ronan Vibert as cinematographer Wolfgang Muller arrive in the spooky
Transylvanian setting and commence shooting ('Albin, a native has wandered
into my frame!' shouts Murnau).  Schreck is staying in character and out of
sight, Murnau tells the cast and crew, even as we see an offering of a small
caged animal taken by inhuman hands.
Schreck (Willem Dafoe) finally makes his appearance as the cameras roll in
the dead of night, scaring Gustav silly.  Soon Schreck is upon Wolfgang, who
disappears with little explanation.  Murnau's pact with the undead is brought
to light when he admonishes his star for taking a bite of the cameraman.
Murnau wants Schreck to wait until the end of the film, where he's promised
he'll have Greta as Murnau's payment for his 'acting.'
The cast is wildly uneven.  John Malkovich is miscast as Murnau (although
the script doesn't serve Murnau well either).  Malkovich simply acts obsessed
with a ludricous German accent.  Dafoe has garnered a lot of attention (and
Oscar buzz) as Schreck.  His performance is certainly entertaining, never
more so than when he plucks a bat out of the air and devours it.  Yet it's
a performance built out of superb makeup and  a stable of ticks, such as the 
clicking of his overly long, yellow nails or the gutteral grunts Kinski used 
in Herzog's "Nosferatu" remake.  He doesn't find his character's voice, which 
should be unsettling but isn't.  
Catherine McCormack is surprisingly effective as the spoiled morphine hound
Greta Schroder.  She captures the decadence of 1920's Germany.  Udo Kier is
restrained and able as Albin which he easily could have played for camp.
Cary Elwes arrives at the film's midpoint as replacement cinematographer
(and drug supplier/user) Fritz Wagner, reprising his overly theatrical
turns from "The Princess Bride" (where the technique worked) and "Coppola's
Dracula" (where it didn't).  Here, it's one more crazy patchwork in the quilt.
Katz' script, with Merhige's changes, plays more like Murnau's "Faust"
than "Nosferatu."  Murnau is simply an obsessive filmmaker willing to sell
his soul to get his vision on film.  He's used as a device, a conceit, not
a true character.  Humor is well utilizied - Merhige got his licks in by 
having Schreck proclaim, hungrily, that perhaps the writer was no longer 
necessary.
Technically the film is good, aping the silent look of "Nosferatu" when
not recreating it.  However, why, why, why does Merhige choose to accompany
his camera POV of the recreations with sound produced to recall the era - 
this was a silent film!  Overtures from "The Flying Dutchman" and "Tristan
and Isolde" are apt accompaniments to the visuals.  (Herzog again - Merhige
stages a scene of a ship set being built that strongly recalls an image
Herzog used in "Aguirre, the Wrath of God.")
This film keeps getting compared to "Gods and Monsters," probably because
they're both about homosexual directors who made early monster flicks.
"Gods and Monsters" painted a beautiful and complex portrait of James
Whale.  "Shadow of the Vampire" tells me practically nothing about Murnau.

"Shadow of the Vampire" features a typically earnest performance by John
Malkovich as the great German Expressionist filmmaker Friedrich Wilhelm
Murnau, spitting lines like "I will finish this picture!" and "You can eat
Greta *after* your death scene!" with unequivocal abandon.  And it features
a wonderfully creepy, nuanced performance by Willem Dafoe as Max Schreck,
the mysterious vampire-like star of Murnau's gothic masterpiece, "Nosferatu."
But there's not much else to E. Elias Merhige's slow-moving tale about the
making of Murnau's 1922 film.
The focus, of course, is on Dafoe, who looks terrific--and acts
terrifically--under all that makeup.  As Count Orlock (Bram Stoker's estate
refused Murnau the rights to film Stoker's "Dracula" so he simply changed
the name) he outdoes Jim Carrey in "How the Grinch Stole Christmas."
Needless to say Dafoe's performance is more introspective, although he does
roll his eyes a lot in keeping with the over-the-top acting style of the
times.
Credit, too, must be given to Dafoe's startling makeup design.  Ann
Buchanan makes Dafoe a very convincing-looking Schreck, from the little
tufts of white hair behind his pixie-like ears to his long, skeletal
fingers, which look like a cross between Freddy Krueger's razor-sharp
appendages and those of the face hugger from "Alien"--wizened and
white-knuckled with fingernails as long as a toll collector's on the Jersey
turnpike.
Like "Gods and Monsters," a 1998 film that chronicled the making of James
Whale's "Frankenstein," "Shadow of the Vampire" is a thoughtful,
contemplative film that attempts to inject new blood into the machinations
of a cinematic auteur.  Unlike Bill Condon's film, however, we do get some
insight into the mind of a man who conjured up truly horrific
visions--Murnau was a fanatic and an obsessive, one who defied his producer
(here played by the great Udo Kier), worked excessively, hounded his
actors, kept secrets, and left everything to chance, all tempered by daily
doses of laudanum.  Unfortunately, the shaggy dog core of the film is that
Schreck wasn't exactly acting when he sucked the blood of his leading lady
(we're tipped off in an opening title board that refers to "Nosferatu" as
one of the most *realistic* vampire films ever made).  This puts a bit of a
shaky spin on an otherwise "serious" treatment.
Under Merhige's workmanlike direction, "Shadow of the Vampire" is murky
and meditative while revisiting the kind of murky vampire lore we've seen a
thousand times before.  Malkovich, surprisingly, doesn't even attempt a
German accent!  (Cary Elwes, as a replacement cinematographer, does, and
it's to his discredit.)  The opening credits sequence is so long and
puzzling--it's not obvious what we're supposed to be looking at--that it
sets a bad tone for the rest of the picture.
Co-produced by Nicolas Cage of all people, "Shadow of the Vampire" is
still worth catching if, for nothing else, Dafoe's fine contributions.
It's an OscarŽ-caliber performance that, sadly, will no doubt be dismissed
along with the notion that this film is just another vampire picture.

 Shadow of the Vampire (2000) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring John
Malkovich, Willem Dafoe, Catherine McCormack, Eddie Izzard, Cary Elwes
and Udo Kier. Written by Steven Katz. Directed by E. Elias Merhige.
Rated R.
 The conceit of Shadow of the Vampire is intriguing: Legendary German
film director W.R. Murnau hires an actual vampire to star in his
production of Nosferatu, but passes him off to his film company as Max
Schreck, a method actor who lives the role of the evil bloodsucker.
 Writer Steven Katz and director E. Elias Merhige have used the filming
of Murnauís 1922 groundbreaking horror film to examine the obsession of
the artist and the magic of filmmaking.
 Murnau (John Malkovich) is passionate about truth in his movies, and he
has decided to film the most horrific feature ever made.
 Undeterred by the refusal of the rights to Dracula by Bram Stokerís
widow, Murnau carries on, changing the name of his vampire and moving
the setting to Bremen, Germany, instead of London.
 Always the perfectionist, Murnau takes his crew and cast on location to
shoot. There the fun begins as Schreck ó lured into the role by Murnau's
promise that at the end of filming he may dine on the movie's leading
lady ó begins feeding off cast and crew much to Murnauís displeasure.
 It is not the lives he's concerned about, itís the loss of valuable
people he needs to complete his project. Plus Schreck had promised
Murnau he would control his blood lust until the last frame was filmed.
 Malkovich is fun to watch as Murnau. Wide-eyed, obsessive, his focus is
solely on making his movie. When Schreck kills his cameraman, Murnau
berates him for jeopardizing the project. The death of the
cinematographer has put the film behind schedule because Murnau must
take time off to hire a replacement.
 Willem Dafoe gives a tour-de-force performance as Schreck.
Unrecognizable under heavy makeup, Dafoe gives rein to the theatrics one
would expect from a hammy vampire seeking his own brand of immortality.
 Dafoe also manages to bring a bit of humanity to his monster as, in one
scene, he explains to the filmís producer and writer the loneliness of
having lived for centuries. We know he is speaking from the heart, they
applaud his passion for staying in character and method acting.
 Dafoe is flamboyant, comical and mesmerizing as Schreck. He dismisses
Murnauís protests with a casual wave of his hand and continues on his
own course, knowing that Murnau is too maniacal, too hungry for glory to
shut down the production.
Others in the cast include Eddie Izzard as Gustav, the male lead in
Nosferatu who is simultaneously afraid of and in awe of Schreck;
Catherine McCormack as the prime donna leading lady who is the unknowing
object of Schreckís desire; Udo Kier as Murnauís exasperated producer;
and Gary Elwes as the world-weary cinematographer.
 At 93 minutes, Shadow of the Vampire speeds along to its apocalyptic
conclusion. Murnau gets his picture, but at a dear price. As for Schreck
ó well, youíll have to buy a ticket for that answer.
 Shadow of the Vampire is a most entertaining feature, filled with
satire, humor and some horror. The cinematography captures the bleak
landscape of Murnauís tableau, while the black-and-white scenes seen
through Murnauís camera as he films his Nosferatu recreate the stylistic
manner of the original production.
 This is a movie that is a film buffís delight. It is witty, intelligent
and unusual ó a most gratifying experience.
