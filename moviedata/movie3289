"Gunga Din" is an action film and comedy that is set in
late 19th century India.  A film that was so costly to
make that it nearly bankrupted RKO, the production
values are high and the cast is very good.  However,
quality is sacrificed for entertainment, and "Gunga Din"
misses the mark.
"Gunga Din" is based on a Rudyard Kipling poem.  Still,
the plot is very similar to "The Lives of a Bengal Lancer"
from 1935.  Three British soldiers (Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen,
and Douglas Fairbanks Jr) are captured by an Indian
army that opposes British rule.  Grant is impish and
excitable, Fairbanks is torn between male bonding and
Joan Fontaine, and McLaglen plays mother to an elephant.
Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe) is an Indian waterboy that serves
the British army and dreams of becoming a British soldier.
So that our sympathies are clearly with the British, the
rebel Indians are depicted as belonging to a fanatical
religious cult that promotes mass murder.  The battle
between the Indian and British forces that ends the film
is predictable and unconvincing.
Cary Grant was a great comic actor, and his performance
in "Gunga Din" generates some laughs.  But his wide-eyed
character has all the maturity of a twelve-year-old.
As in the superior "Lives of a Bengal Lancer", the three
British soldiers are kept alive by their captors for
little apparent reason, and strain credibility in their
success at escaping and sabotaging the rebel forces.
My favorite film about the British adventure in India
is "Wee Willie Winkie", a Shirley Temple vehicle from 1938
that was directed by John Ford.  Like "Gunga Din", it
co-starred McLaglen and was based on a work by Kipling.
