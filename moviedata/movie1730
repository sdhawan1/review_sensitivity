Okay, I admit.  I had high expectations.  My friend Jody saw it twice
already, and she said she'd see it with me again, and not just because
of Pierce Brosnan's most excellent behind.  I was disappointed (geez,
that just seems to be my way of life lately after "Star Wars Episode
I: The Phantom Menace" and "Blair Witch Project"), but I'm happy to
say not overly so.  I was only bored for a few minutes, and I thought
Rene Russo's breasts showed up on screen just a *tad* too often.
Another problem I had was with Pierce Brosnan's Thomas Crown.  Sure,
he's rich, suave, handsome, intelligent, and whatnot (heck, I think
Mr.  Crown the finance geek secretly fantasizes about being James
Bond), but I'd like to see more of his motives.  Sure, there was
foreshadowing: he'd take on a bet of 100,000 dollars without so much
as a batting an eyelash; he'd ruin a boat just for thrills.  But when
I ask myself why on earth a millionaire like him would go to such
lengths to steal a painting only to return it, I can't come up with a
satisfactory answer.  Other than creative license.  I probably would
have enjoyed Crown's slick maneuvers a lot more if that one thought
hadn't kept bugging me.
I also how he could've fallen in love with a woman like Catherine
Banning (played by Rene "I'm forty but I've still got a nice body"
Russo) so quickly.  I mean it's not like it's a case of opposites
attract.  It didn't feel right.  Banning seemed just a little too
smug, just a little too self-assured.  I suppose Russo's nose had
something to do with that impression, but who am I to judge on
someone's appearance?  I didn't like it and I can't come up with a
legitimate reason why.  However I did like how Russo gradually showed
us the fragile feminine Banning under the tough act she puts up.  When
Crown "returns" the painting to the museum, we see some priceless
moments in the surveillance room as Banning tries to hide joy then
disappointment at Crown's escape.
"The Thomas Crown Affair" was like a sightseeing tour of the New York
area with our brilliant and attractive fourty-something stars.  The
scenery and cinematography were just breathtaking, and the score added
a lot of class.  It's tempting to label the film as all style and no
substance, because there *is* too much socializing and contrived
romance and too little action, but when one thinks about it: Well, the
word "affair" *does* have two meanings.  I'm just glad that our two
lovebirds stayed in love (proving that, hey, even rich spoiled bored
people can find true love) and we all found a tiny moral lesson (as
Dennis Leary's Michael did) along the way.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
What do you get for the man that has everything?  Apparently a mindless
remake.  John McTiernan's (Die Hard) version of the 1968 film starring
Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway falls short of actual amusement and is
even occasionally excruciating  save the brilliant ending that easily
one-ups its predecessor.  Leonard Maltin called the original `perfect
non-think entertainment,' and the remake offers more of the same.
Pierce Brosnan (Tomorrow Never Dies) plays Thomas Crown, an art-loving
multimillionaire who spends his time plotting the perfect heist.  Like
the original, most of the film's first half-hour is devoted to the theft
of a valuable painting from a museum (originally just over $2 million,
but here a $100 million Monet). Catherine Banning (Rene Russo, Lethal
Weapon 4) is an insurance agent for the museum and, together with NYPD
detective Michael McCann (Denis Leary, True Crime), immediately suspects
Crown and tries to mount her case against him.  The trouble is that
somewhere along the line, Banning mounts more than her case.
Casting-wise, the suave and debonair Brosnan is a much better choice
than McQueen, but Russo is downright horrible in Dunaway's role.  She
looks awful and acts even worse.  Leary seems lost as the cop and the
film could have used more of his sarcastic spunk.  The score never
really seemed to fit the picture, and viewers will have a hard time
connecting with any of the characters.  Those responsible for the
updated script include Leslie Dixon (the abominable That Old Feeling)
and Kurt Wimmer (Sphere).  Of other note, viewers should now know to be
wary of any film that prominently displays a bowler hat (remember The
Avengers?).
Alan Trustman's original screenplay (he also wrote the superior McQueen
vehicle Bullitt) may have seemed invigorating in 1968, but today seems
as stale as a cardboard pizza with felt pepperoni  especially since we
all recently suffered through a very similar cat-and-mouse chase in
Entrapment.  The original, directed by Norman Jewison (Moonstruck), was
shot by the legendary Haskell Wexler (Limbo) and included the use of
what I like to call Brady Bunch windows  several smaller multi-image
screens that make up the entire frame.  Also look for Dunaway, who plays
Crown's shrink in the updated version.  (1:55 - R for nudity, some
sexuality and language)

SCRIPTURE
REFERENCES:    Proverbs 13:7, Revelation 3:17, Ecclesiastes 5:10
THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR is an attractive, stylishly-made remake of an
attractive, stylishly-made 1968 film which starred Steve McQueen and Faye
Dunaway.  Both films feature a playful but intelligent cat and mouse game
between the two leads.
In the remake, Pierce Brosnan (TOMORROW NEVER DIES) is cast as the title
character originated by Mr. McQueen.  Thomas Crown is a multi-billionaire
for whom $100,000 is merely pocket change to be squandered on an
impossible golf bet.  The high stakes of the "shark-infested" corporate
waters in which he swims has lost its challenge.  He has bested every
business opponent he has come across.  There is no more excitement in his
life.  No more heights of which to climb.  So what is a man to do?  Of
course!  Risk everything by turning to a life of crime.  He's not in it
for the money.  He just wants (needs?) the adrenaline rush.
After cleverly pulling off an art museum heist where he absconds with a
million dollar Monet, he crosses paths with Catherine Banning (Rene Russo,
TIN CUP), a smart and sexy insurance investigator who immediately senses
that Crown is her culprit.  Not being confined to police procedures, legal
niceties, or for that matter, common sense, Banning seductively confronts
Crown with the fact that she knows that he stole the painting.
As the two main characters begin to weave an intricate dance... Setting
traps, springing traps, avoiding traps... They become inexplicably drawn,
both physically and emotionally to one another.  Trust and honesty become
major stumbling blocks to them as they each consider the possibility of
entering into a romantic relationship with their opponent.
Mr. Bronsan's cool 007-like demeanor works well for this "man who has
everything."  He plays Crown as someone who has clearly become accustomed,
even bored, with the finer things of life.  That he does so without
turning in a boring performance is noteworthy.
Ms. Russo's character is a bit more enigmatic.  Banning's investigation
seems to be more intuitive than anything else, having as she does a
special prescient ability to somehow sense the truth.  By allowing herself
to get emotionally attached to Crown, her judgment begins to break down,
rendering her helpless to get a read on his true intentions.
Denis Leary (SUICIDE KINGS) does a fine job in his supporting role of
police detective Michael McCann who, from the onset, is obviously
outmatched by both Crown and Banning.  Faye Dunaway, who played the female
lead in the original film, is given a extraneous and meaningless role as
Crown's therapist.
Director John McTiernan (DIE HARD) has crafted a polished and
entertaining romantic suspense thriller.  Like the original (which won an
Academy Award for Best Song by composer Michel Legrand), the remake boasts
a wonderful score, this time by composer Bill Conti.
The biggest difference between the two versions may be most noticeable in
our modern day tolerance of more sexually explicit scenes.  "The Kiss," as
it was come to be known, between Mr. McQueen and Ms. Dunaway has been
replaced by an extended nude coupling of Mr. Bronson and Ms. Russo.
Personally, I look back fondly on the days when filmmakers could
communicate the physical desire of their characters without taking the
clothes off their performers.
Of course, it should be noted that Thomas Crown, with all his billions,
was still fundamentally empty and lost.  His money did not buy him the
peace of heart which he desired.  His life, despite his wealth, became
meaningless and dull, which is why he foolishly began breaking the law by
stealing precious artwork from museums.
Financial wealth is never the culmination of our dreams.  It is not the
answer to our prayers.  It is not the final goal of a godly man or woman.
There are riches that will satisfy but they won't be found in a bank
balance.  Spiritual riches are found in one's heart.

I've never seen the acclaimed 1968 Norman Jewison caper romance, "The Thomas 
Crown Affair," which top-lined Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway, and after 
viewing this highly stylized 1999 remake, let's just say I'm not exactly 
dying to rent it anytime soon. Old-fashioned, cliched, and considerably 
uninvolving, the only aspect of the film that even remotely distinguishes it 
from a mainstream '60s movie is the repeated exploitation of actress Rene 
Russo's breasts. Don't get me wrong; at 45-years-old, she still looks 
stunning, but when a film's story stops dead in its tracks simply to show 
somebody nude for no apparent reason, you basically can sense that you're in 
for the long haul.
When a famous Monet painting turns up missing at the Metropolitan Museum of 
Art in New York City, Insurance Investigator Catherine Banning (Rene Russo) 
is sent in to find the thief and retrieve the priceless work of art, with the 
help of city investigator Michael McCann (Denis Leary). Ever notice how 
sleek, catchy names like Catherine Banning and Michael McCann only exist 
within the world of the cinema? Oh, how easy it is to get sidetracked. 
Anyway, all evidence points directly towards billionaire playboy Thomas Crown 
(Pierce Brosnan), so when Catherine begins snooping around and going out on 
dates with him to seek out any information she can get, and to blatantly 
steal his house keys right out of his pocket(!), imagine her utter shock when 
she discovers that she is madly, hopelessly, deeply falling for him. Sex 
ensues. So do some possible double-crosses. And so does a lingering getaway 
to a secluded Caribbean island where Catherine lets it all hang out and she 
and Thomas walk around in their birthday suits, and then go back to bed for 
another roll in the hay. Yes, you heard that right. And yes, it's as tedious 
as it sounds. 
After a seemingly endless prologue which introduces us to Thomas Crown, a man 
who "has it all," except an interesting personality, and features the 
intricate theft of the Monet, edited at the pace of a legless 100-year-old, 
Rene Russo enters the scene and breathes some much-needed life to the film. 
Beautiful, sassy, and likable, Russo has returned after a long absence to a 
lead role in an adult studio picture; It's just too bad it couldn't have been 
a film in which the screenplay (ineptly penned by Leslie Dixon and Kurt 
Wimmer) was thrown away and extensively rewritten with at least an ounce of 
wit and flair. If there is one thing director John McTiernan does right with 
this remake, it is that, once she enters the picture at around the 15-minute 
mark, Russo instantly becomes the human focus of the story. Unfortunately, at 
the one-hour mark, McTiernan throws the romance into high gear, but in the 
process, concocts a series of unintentionally funny, totally unnecessary sex 
scenes, and drops Catherine's IQ score by several points.
Tugging Russo's dignity down even more is her pairing with Pierce Brosnan, a 
great-looking actor who nonetheless is as dull as a piece of chopped wood. 
For the film to ultimately work, one of the most essential components is an 
actor that is able to pull off Thomas Crown's intriguing qualities and 
effortless allure. While Brosnan seems to have fun in his James Bond movies, 
and therefore, is able to pull off that world-famous role, he is more or less 
vapid here. I don't know; maybe it's because he knew the script was severely 
flawed, as was the lackluster directing, and didn't have his heart into it 
because of this. At any rate, it's decidedly better to make the best of what 
you've got, rather than choose to play it dull. Just look at Russo; she has 
fun even when she's flashing the audience every couple minutes. 
A desperate act if I've ever seen one, the original's Faye Dunaway makes a 
recurring, throwaway cameo as Thomas' psychiatrist, but the role is so 
thankless and wasteful that you are left wondering just what the point was. 
The scenes between the two stick out like a sore thumb in the context of the 
rest of the film, and there is no payoff to be had. Is McTiernan's purpose to 
give an "in the know" wink to those who remember the original? If so, then 
why not at least incorporate Dunaway somewhere in the confines of the story 
being told, instead of adding an extra, half-witted subplot that takes up 
even more precious minutes of the already-overlong running time.
There was another caper romance that came out this past April called 
"Entrapment," and it is the film that "The Thomas Crown Affair" only wishes 
it could be. "Entrapment" was filled with suspenseful and exciting sequences, 
and presented us with a relationship that played like more than just an 
afterthought. And if that's not enough, the two stars of the picture were 
Sean Connery and the radiant Catherine Zeta-Jones, who really set the romance 
on fire with heated chemistry and unavoidable passion. In contrast, you never 
for once believe that Rene Russo and Pierce Brosnan are in love. When their 
inevitable sex scene finally rolls around, their internal frame-of-mind 
practically shouts out, "Hey, I'm cashing a paycheck here!"

CrankyCriticŽ movie reviews: The Thomas  Crown Affair
Rated  [R], 114 minutes
Starring Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo;
Denis Leary, Ben Gazarra and Faye Dunaway
Screenplay by Leslie Dixon & Kurt Wimmer
Based on the original story by Alan R. Trustman
Directed by John McTiernan
website: http://www.mgm.com/thethomascrownaffair
IN SHORT: Watching rich folks is a tedious chore.
As always, no comparison is made to the Source Material, a 1968 film
written by Alan R. Trustman and starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway.
You may remember Cranky griping about concept over execution in the
discussions over another movie. Well, The Thomas Crown Affair is
lovingly executed, but there's so little story content in relation to
scenes of how the richest of the rich live, as we watch the passionate
but romance-less game being played by the main characters, that you
could easily duck out to refill the popcorn and soda and not miss a darn
thing. You could do that several times and add a bathroom break, too.
So, while Cranky sat in his chair watching the lovely exotic scenery
that those who own their own jets can jet off to when Manhattan gets
them down, he got creative. Here now, the background of The Thomas Crown
Affair.
She's a poor girl from Ohio. He's a poor boy from Scotland.
She got wealthy. He got grand stinking rich. Like Billions.
She likes to chase. He likes the challenge.
She's tempting. He's a temptation.
He steals valuable art. She gets it back for the insurance company.
He has woman troubles. She has no man. A match made in Heaven, eh?
He's Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan), who buys and sells companies before
lunch. An ex-boxer who has put so many competitors to the canvas that
life isn't thrilling anymore gets his kicks ripping off art galleries.
She's Catherine Banning (Rene Russo), who stands to make a cool $5
millions if she can find the Monet painting (she's sure) he's purloined
in an audacious attack on the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
It's a brilliantly conceived attack, punctuated by an annoying
techno-flavored underscore by Bill Conti. Director John McTiernan 's
languid direction stretches the thing out way too long for my taste. And
we're just getting started.
McTiernan, who directed Die Hard, offers up long luxuriating cinematic
passages designed to set a mood of elegance and a rich texture on a
cinematic canvas. As Crown and Banning do their little dance, are they
flirting or are they manipulating each other and if so, is it into bed
or into the clink, the only member of their manage a trois to enjoy the
chase is Crown's shrink, played with an amusing grin, by Faye Dunaway.
Crown's inability to let women get close enough to him, and his attempts
to deal with it (he says he can get a woman to trust him, but never the
other way around) is a running theme. Also in the middle, is Denis Leary
as the New York Police Detective in charge of the investigation, who may
or may not care about the sins of the rich. It's something you may want
to debate when this is done.
He knows he stole the painting. She knows he stole the painting and is
more than willing to break the law to get it back. When all is said and
done, Crown wants Banning. Banning wants the painting almost as much as
she wants Crown. When he offers to prove his feelings by returning the
painting to the museum, hanging it in the same spot it was stolen from,
will she bust him or will she join him as a fugitive, living the high
life on an island in the sun. The shame is that when this final gimmick
comes down, it's a brilliant scene. A scattering of applause greeted it
in the preview Cranky sat in. There are a couple of surprises held to
the very end, but by then, it's too late. The leisurely pace and padding
kill this sucker dead.
Watching two rich people that are so cold to the world try to fire up an
almost-middle-aged passion leads to much nudity, but no sense of spark
between the pair. There is more life and spark in the very brief scenes
with Faye Dunaway to put Rene Russo's performance to shame. Brosnan is
doing a cold Remington Steele. The disappointment is such that I may hit
the video store to see what worked about this story the first time out.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to The Thomas Crown Affair, he would
have paid...

Hollywood is a hotbed of ideas these days. Financial ones.
Having decided to marshal its resources on fewer films, the studio
executives are hard at work searching for lucrative approaches. The
safest path to riches? Remakes. Or so they seem to think.
After all, what's easier than remaking a movie that audiences have liked
before? Start calling agents. Get yourself some bankable stars and a big
name director, and start planning the marketing campaign.
As crass as this approach is, it does produce some modestly entertaining
films, THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR, directed by DIE HARD's John McTiernan,
being one.  Pierce Brosnan (the current James Bond) and Rene Russo (TIN
CUP) replace Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway, who starred in the
original. Although this is not particularly inspired casting, neither is
a bad choice.
As suave billionaire Thomas Crown, Pierce Brosnan looks dashingly
handsome, no surprise there. Crown is a kleptomaniac for the fun of it.
He's the type who bets $100,000 on a single golf stroke. He wagers not
because he thinks he'll make the putt but because he just enjoys the
thrill of the gamble. He's also a playboy who draws women to him like
flies to honey. With Brosnan's looks and charm, this is probably the
easiest part of the story to believe.
The performance by the usually reliable Rene Russo is another matter
entirely. This version of the movie focuses on the romantic aspects of
the relationship between the rich thief and his insurance investigating
nemesis, Catherine Banning (Russo). Russo, who has used her sexuality as
a sideline in other films, is asked to make it a key part of this
character.
Perhaps because action director McTiernan is unable to give her proper
guidance or perhaps because of her harsh, heavy make-up, Russo delivers
a performance that's sometimes funny, but too often stiff. The low
points of the film are when she takes her clothes off. Trying without
much success to recreate Elizabeth Shue's whiskey scene in LEAVING LAS
VEGAS, Russo ends up appearing awkward, as if she'd never made love
before.
The setup for the movie has a Trojan horse full of burglars delivered to
what is clearly the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. (The press
kit claims that it wasn't meant to be any real museum. Sure.) The crime
goes awry, but between mergers and acquisitions, rich businessman Crown
manages to steal a $100,000,000 painting anyway.
As the tough, by-the-book Detective Michael McCann, Denis Leary gives
the funniest performance in the movie. When a tony insurance
investigator (Banning) invades his turf, the detective is not pleased,
especially when she uses effective but illegal and unethical techniques
in going after Crown. "Do you have any idea how many flesh-eating
lawyers this guy is going to have?" he asks her in frustration. The
negative chemistry between the two is delicious. "So, are the laws of
the United States completely unknown to you?" he asks her rhetorically.
As soon as Banning tells Crown that she knows he did it, the movie
becomes a cat-and-mouse game. The script at its best finds especially
clever ways for Crown to trick Banning and the cops and for her to
discover his secrets. At its worst, as in the bizarre character of
Crown's psychiatrist (Faye Dunaway), the movie becomes ridiculous. "Oh
dear, Peter Pan decides to grow up and finds there's no place to land,"
his psychiatrist chides him in a typically asinine line. This subplot is
a needless distraction in a film that needs more focus and energy. For
work of a director known for his proclivity to blow things up, the movie
moves at a remarkably languid pace.
Even if you can guess parts of the ending, the exact way the story gets
resolved is a genuine treat. Full of inventiveness and audience pleasing
twists, the story ends on an especially satisfying high note.
THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR runs 1:51. It is rated R for sex, nudity and
language. If the few nude scenes had been deleted, which would have been
a decided improvement, the movie would have been rated PG-13 and
appropriate for kids 10 and up. As it is, the movie would be fine for
those 15 and up.

Susan Granger's review of "THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR" (M.G.M.)
Pierce Brosnan doesn't even attempt to be Steve McQueen in this
re-make of Norman Jewison's "The Thomas Crown Affair" (1968).
Brosnan's bored billionaire playboy, the proverbial man who has
everything, is quite different. He's suave, cool and polished, yet
eager for a challenge, even an emotional distraction, as he tells his
psychiatrist, played by Faye Dunaway (not so coincidentally, the
co-star of the original version). The dapper Mr. Crown has just pulled
off an extraordinary theft of a $100 million Monet from New York's
Metropolitan Museum of Art. But an insurance investigator - that's
Rene Russo - knows he did it, and she's equally sleek, elegant and
provocative.  They cleverly taunt, torment, and tease each other
relentlessly - to the delight of the audience and chagrin of the
Manhattan detective (Denis Leary) assigned to the case. The issue, of
course, is trust - and neither of them does.  The intelligent, if
occasionally implausible screenplay by Leslie Dixon and Kurt Wimmer,
based on Alan R. Trustman's story, and the taut direction by John
McTiernan focuses far less on the caper aspect and concentrates,
instead, on the sexy, romantic entanglement that develops. Not that
there aren't surprises. In fact, the intriguing plot twists and turns
so much that you're bound to surprised more than once. It's too bad,
however, that more time wasn't spent on developing the edgy,
intriguing characters. They're too shallow, too glossy and
superficial. Sting performs the Oscar-winning song, "The Windmills of
Your Mind" by Michel Legrand, and Bill Conti's score is excellent. On
the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The Thomas Crown Affair" is a
sharp, stylish, slick 7. It's fanciful good fun.

John McTiernan's "The Thomas Crown Affair" is a predictable, overly familiar
remake of the Steve
McQueen/Faye Dunaway romance caper. Pierce Brosnan is Thomas Crown, a
billionaire who also
lies to steal fine art. When a valuable piece is missing from the New York
Museum of Modern Art,
ins urance bounty hunter Katherine(Rene Russo) must investigate Crown, and
ends up falling into a
passionate love affair with the man whom she knows is guilty. The plot
sounds a lot like
"Entrapment", with Sean Connery, but the acting in "Thomas Crown" is better.
Pierce Brosnan has
always annoyed me, playing the same role over and over, but this is that
role and he does fine with it.
Rene Russo is back on screen and looking better than ever; she also hasn't
lost her tough-girl act,
which is fine with me. However, this film is lacking a good script as well
as anything fresh or new, so
as a result it's not much fun. Also, while some elements of "The Thomas
Crown Affair" are
well-made, John McTiernan("Die Hard") pays little attention to details, so
the film should have gone
through one more edit. Where "The Thomas Crown Affair" should be slick and
smooth, it's glib and
rough. You're better off sticking with the original.

_The_Thomas_Crown_Affair_ (R) *** (out of ****)
The original version of _The_Thomas_Crown_Affair_, released in 1968, is
an ideal project to be remade.  The sleek Norman Jewison-directed, Steve
McQueen-Faye Dunaway-starring caper is an entertaining film, but
certainly not a great one, leaving a sizable margin for improvement.  The
1999 version, directed by John McTiernan and starring Pierce Brosnan and
Rene Russo, isn't that much better a film than its predecessor, for its
inspired updates simply make it an enjoyable romantic romp in its own
right.
The most dramatic alteration is the central act of theft pulled off by
bored billionaire Thomas Crown (Brosnan) is an art heist, not a bank
robbery, and the film is better for it.  An art museum proves to be a
vastly more interesting setting than a bank, leaving a lot more room for
creativity in the caper scene.  (Jewison obviously strained to keep
things visually interesting in his film, employing a busy split-screen
technique that appears terribly dated through contemporary eyes.)  After
pulling off a clever and oh-so-slick scheme, Thomas comes away from the
museum with a Monet valued at $100 million--and with chic insurance
investigator Catherine Banning (Russo) hot on his tail.
And when I say "hot," I mean hot: Catherine may indeed be interested in
recovering that painting, but she's much more interested in Thomas
himself, whose suave, carefree ways arouse--and, in many ways,
mirror--her.  The dangerous affair they eventually fall into makes for
the heart of both this and the 1968 film, and it is in this area that the
newer film makes a stronger case.  Despite the palpable electricity
between McQueen and Dunaway, the original's romance felt rushed and
therefore somewhat forced; here, screenwriter Leslie Dixon (who shares
screenplay credit with Kurt Wimmer, who, in a unique arrangement, handled
only the action scenes) fleshes out the love story, showing how their
basic desire develops into real affection.
That said, the updated romance _does_ have more than its share of
sizzle--and how could it not when it pairs two of the most attractive
magnetic stars (and both north of 40, no less) in film today?  Brosnan's
presence may seem cool to the point of freezing for some, but that's the
key to his allure--his debonair detachment, which is a strong fit for
Thomas.  The stunning Russo, however, is all fire.  A veteran of
adventure films, Russo has finally found a role that enables her to blend
her popular brand of vulnerable machisma with a strong dose of natural
feminine wiles, and she obviously relishes the chance to vamp it up.
This is no clearer than in the centerpiece seduction scene, where Thomas
and Catherine's attraction erupts to a boil during a torrid dance.  (In a
nice touch, the song they dance to is an uptempo rendition of the
original film's Oscar-winning theme song, "The Windmills of Your
Mind"--which also recurs as the couple's instrumental love theme.)  The
scene smolders--and how could it not, especially with Russo shimmying in
a slinky see-through dress?--but it doesn't hold a candle to its classic
counterpart in the original film, where Thomas and Catherine engage in
the steamiest chess game ever committed to film.  While the new scene is
all about sex--and how--what's missing is the added dimension of
intellectual seduction that took place as the two ever-so-erotically
matched wits on the chess board.
McTiernan, of course, has made his name as a crack action director
(anyone _not_ remember _Die_Hard_?), so naturally this remake features a
more elaborate action climax.  What is surprising, though, is that the
complexity comes not in the amount of pyrotechnics--there aren't any--but
in the imagination and smarts behind it.  I won't give anything away, but
the clever machinations are more exciting than any big explosion could
ever be.
_The_Thomas_Crown_Affair_ may be a bit too laid-back and older-skewing
to be a blockbuster hit, but it gives the summer something it has been
sorely lacking: a strong sense of class, which is more than welcome in
this season of crass.

 The Thomas Crown Affair (1999) 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Pierce
Brosnan and Rene Russo.
 "The Thomas Crown Affair" is a fun, fluffy caper film. And it is fitting
that the movie is about theft, because Rene Russo steals this romantic
drama from nominal star Pierce Brosnan.
 The film is a remake of a 1968 feature that starred Steve McQueen and Faye
Dunaway. The plot has been updated. In this version, multimillionaire
Thomas Crown steals valuable paintings instead of robbing banks.
 And, as in the original, Russo is the top-notch insurance investigator who
is out to prove Crown is the master thief.
 Much has changed in 30 years. The sexual tension that existed between
McQueen and Dunaway could not be consummated on screen as it is here.
 "The Thomas Crown Affair" is a movie about trust. As Crown's
blunt-speaking shrink (Dunaway in a sparkling but small part) continually
hammers at him, he is a man afraid to trust, to let others into his life.
 The crux of this movie lies in the ability of Brosnan's Crown and Russo's
Catherine Banning to learn to trust each other, even as they play their
cat-and-mouse game.
 Russo is so strong, so sexy - and she is not shy about showing her
attributes - so smart that she overpowers whoever she is on screen with,
especially Brosnan. As an actor, he is one of those men who relies more on
his looks - a raised eyebrow, a set jaw - than his thespian abilities to
carry a role.
 That is why he is so good as James Bond. Brosnan looks good in a tux or
three-piece suit, holding a drink in his hand and making quips. He just
can't emote worth a damn.
 And that is the movie's sore point, because Russo is so strong, so
confident, it is difficult to understand what she sees in the almost-wooden
Crown.
 Brosnan's Crown steals the paintings not for profit, but for the fun of it
- for kicks. It's a sign that he is alive. It keeps him alert, functioning.
 He knows that she knows that he stole the painting and she knows that he
knows she knows he is the thief. But none of that matters. It is the sexual
sparks between these two protagonists that propel this movie. You are more
interested in them than in the mechanics of the theft and the investigation
that follows.
 "The Thomas Crown Affair" is a pleasant experience, like eating out at a
fine middle-class restaurant. It's nothing special, but it is satisfying.

THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR (M).  
(MGM/UIP)
Director: John McTiernan
Stars: Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo, Denis Leary, Frankie Faison, Faye 
Dunaway, Ben Gazzara, Fritz Weaver, Charles Keating, Mark Margolis,
Michael Lombard
Running time: 114 minutes.
This stylish, sexy remake of The Thomas Crown Affair is
something of a pet project for star Pierce Brosnan, who also produced
the film.  The 1968 original was a largely unremarkable movie, made
more memorable by the suave and cool Steve McQueen at his charismatic
best, and director Norman Jewison's then revolutionary use of
split-screen techniques during a climactic heist scene.  This slick
caper thriller is a fairly conventional film from director John
McTiernan (the original Die Hard, Predator, etc), who has previously
displayed an affinity for cinematic pyrotechnics and spectacular
action sequences.  McTiernan retains enough familiar elements to
satisfy older audiences who remember the original, while cleverly
updating the story for the more cynical and technologically advanced
'90's.
There are some sly nods to the original, especially through
the token presence of Faye Dunaway, wasted in a largely irrelevant
role as Crown's psychiatrist, and a bland reprise of the Oscar winning
song Windmills Of My Mind.  However, McTiernan suffuses this new
version with enough new touches to make it seem fresh for audiences
unfamiliar with the original.
In between Bond assignments, Brosnan comfortably steps into
McQueen's shoes as Thomas Crown, the rich but bored millionaire who
steals for kicks.  In the 1968 original, Crown robbed banks, but here
he steals paintings.  When a priceless Monet is lifted from an art
gallery during an elaborately staged but bungled robbery, beautiful
and resourceful female insurance investigator Catherine Banning (Rene
Russo in the Faye Dunaway role) suspects Crown.  She doggedly pursues
Crown and gets up close and personal with him in the hopes of trapping
him.  The intriguing cat and mouse game between Crown and Banning adds
to the suspense of the film.
McTiernan and script writers Leslie Dixon (Outrageous Fortune,
etc) and Kurt Wimmer stick to the tried and true formula of similar
thrillers (To Catch A Thief, the recent Entrapment, etc), placing the
tempestuous relationship between the two protagonists at the centre of
the film.  This new version of The Thomas Crown Affair has a more
sentimental outlook than the original.
The film also has a deliberately raunchy edge, with generous
dollops of sex and nudity.  There is an obvious sexual chemistry
between the two stars, and McTiernan is clever enough to exploit this
to enhance a plot that otherwise looks rather tired and formulaic.
The two stars definitely prove that there is life after forty!
Reunited with his Nomads director, Brosnan brings charm, sex
appeal and a dangerous edge to his engaging performance as the suave
thief.  Russo (the Lethal Weapon series, etc) stamps her sexy and
seductive presence on her role, and she fairly sizzles across the
screen.
Denis Leary has a droll and sarcastic presence as the
beleaguered New York detective assigned to the case, and adds some
humour to proceedings.

The Thomas Crown Affair, a remake of the 1968 Steve McQueen romance of
the same name, is a glossy star vehicle with an attractive surface but
an empty shell. While you will probably enjoy the star chemistry, the
film lacks a certain urgency. And those expecting present 007 Pierce
Brosnan to be dodging explosions and attempting death-defying stunts
should look elsewhere. This remake follows a more laid-back and
conventional pace, but it still can be fun.
Brosnan plays a wealthy art lover named Thomas Crown who steals
expensive paintings because, well, he likes to. His latest heist has
aroused some suspicion. After an ingeniously crafted caper in a museum
involving a group of hired goons and a decoy helicopter, the insurance
company sends in a representative by the name of Catherine Banning (Rene
Russo) to investigate. Banning, with a striking fashion sense and a very
floppy hairdo, manages to piece together the heist in a few brief
moments of scanning the video surveillance. But the identity of the
(very bright) burglar is still unanswered.
Working with detective Michael McCann (Denis Leary), Banning works fast.
She attends a party uninvited, wearing a very revealing dress, and gets
to know Mr. Crown a little better. She knows this debonair businessman
is the thief, but she can't find the evidence to prove it. The chemistry
between Brosnan and Russo in this film is not a noticeable strong point.
They work well enough on an individual basis, but don't create enough
believable sparks together to make their relationship click properly.
Pierce Brosnan perhaps wasn't the best actor to take over for Steve
McQueen, because he's lacking more than a few striking attributes that
the latter was known for. But his performance is slick enough to hide
these drawbacks. Russo's role, also maybe better suited to a different
actress, is still the stronger one. She has never looked better. Perhaps
casting wasn't the most persuasive part of The Thomas Crown Affair, but
the actors are in top form.
The 2nd act of this film struggles valiantly to hold the viewer's
attention. The director is John McTiernan, who is far more accustomed to
helming big-budget action films (he was behind the camera for Die Hard
and Predator). Perhaps it's his direction, but most of The Thomas Crown
Affair feels somewhat stiff. The actors and scenery are pretty, the
set-up is well staged, but there is little push behind the initial
story. Everything seems to meander along slowly until the last fifteen
minutes, which contain just enough clever twists and turns to keep us
interested. If there had been more focus on this sneaky little fun, the
majority of the plot could have moved smoother (the opposite goes for
Entrapment, which was fun and exciting but rarely stopped to establish
character details).
The presence of Denis Leary as the bickering detective helps. Leary is a
gifted comic actor who adds some zest to the story, although I did want
more from his character. There's also Faye Dunaway, the original
insurance investigator in the 1968 version, playing Crown's psychiatrist
and having fun doing so. Inserting Dunaway in more than just a brief
cameo appearance was another wise move. Little additions like this one
can prove very effective when carefully scattered throughout a movie.
An action film this ain't. The Thomas Crown Affair is more like a
long-shot romance with a detailed back story to support it. It has a
tendency to be very entertaining, but the lack of a real 2nd act nearly
sinks it. The actors are charming, but can't scrounge up enough sparks
to keep the momentum flowing. This film has a great opening, a memorable
finale, but what's left in-between leaves something to be desired.

        When I first heard that Rene Russo appears topless in "The Thomas
Crown Affair," I lost a lot of respect for the actress I had first noticed
and admired in 1993's "In the Line of Fire."  Surely you take your top off
first and then you get your big break in Hollywood, Rene, not the other way
around?  But no, "these scenes are in keeping with the storyline and don't
seem cheap or in any way gratuitous" I had been told.  Yeah, right.  Well
surprise surprise, that critic was right on the money and my respect for
Rene is restored!  The two sequences in question are a very steamy sex
scene with Pierce Brosnan, and an almost throwaway shot of Rene lounging on
the beach sans halter.  Perfectly reasonable, perfectly natural you say.
And that sex scene, while pretty darned hot, is one of the most
delightfully playful I've seen.  Self-conscious it is not.  Yet in "The
Thomas Crown Affair," Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo are at their glamorous,
sexiest best even with their clothes well and truly on (and boy do they
wear some stellar-looking duds).  For example, there's a super sexy gliding
sequence that'll put butterflies in your stomach: none of that
joystick-between-the-legs innuendo here.  Well, maybe just a bit...  Pierce
plays a hyper-rich tycoon type with a penchant for Monets (and perhaps a
little petty larceny too) and Rene's an insurance investigator out to nail
him.  Pierce plays it absolutely straight, without 007's knowing wink, and
that makes him one sexy devil, and Rene has this extremely cute character
trait of always nibbling on something (yeah yeah, sometimes it's Pierce),
and that makes her moreish.  Denis Leary, in an effective piece of casting,
plays the cop with the thankless task of trying to keep everything--and
everyone--in perspective and he, Leary, is very good.  In fact, it's all
very good--this is a smart, sophisticated, and if I didn't say it already,
SEXY caper film classily directed by John McTiernan ("Die Hard," "The Hunt
for Red October").  Oh yes, and Faye Dunaway (who co-starred with Steve
McQueen in the original film) has a small part as Pierce's shrink.  The
song that everybody remembers from the 1968 version, "The Windmills of Your
Mind," is here given the jazz-fusion treatment during a window
shopping/falling-in-love montage and also provides a smoky, end-credits
closeout by Muzak's own Sting.  Were it not for the fact that it's such a
bubblegum flick on the surface, despite its stunning ode-to-Dada
denouement, then "The Thomas Crown Affair" might rightly have been regarded
as one of the best films of 1999.

"Can a woman trust you?"
"As long as her interests don't run too contrary to my own."
Starring Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo, Denis Leary. Rated R.
The Thomas Crown Affair is a film so well-made technically that it lures
you into thinking that it's actually good cinematically. It's not. But
the movie moves so smoothly that we almost don't notice the fact that it
expects us to believe things that are impossible -- not just implausible
-- impossible. Ridiculous performances and the masqueraded shallowness
of the center relationship might also fly by the less discriminating
viewer. It's like a lemon automobile with a shiny coat of paint.
Besides making the classic actioner Die Hard, director John McTiernan is
also responsible for Last Action Hero, one of the biggest flops in
history. This is his second movie since that humiliating occasion and
even if it isn't very good, he certainly redeems himself as a director
(working on an assumption that he ever needed redemption, which quite
arguable).
In a James Bond-ish performance (surprised?), Pierce Brosnan plays
Thomas Crown, a limitlessly wealthy "finance geek", as one of the
characters naively puts it, to whom there is more than meets the eye.
He's thrill-seeker extraordinaire and a world-class thief; a man to whom
the process of stealing a difficult-to-snatch object is worth infinitely
more than actually possessing it. When he illicitly gets ahold of a
Monet original worth $100 million he gets more than he bargained for:
Catherine Banning (Rene Russo), a clever insurance agent responsible for
retrieving the painting if she can.
Crown loves a good challenge so he indirectly admits to her that it was
he who took the beloved Monet and gets her to date him (why? how?). They
sleep together (hello?) and fall in love (why? how? when?) and that puts
dear Catherine into a dilemma: does she run away with Crown or does she
turn him in?
Aside from the numerous logical contradictions, especially associated
with the admittedly clever climax, the first major flaw that struck me
was the supported notion that Thomas Crown can correctly guess what
everyone around him is going to do. McTiernan's intention seems to be to
define him as an enigma: but this is a full-fledged romance and such
definition is wholly inappropriate. As such, Crown rarely feels human to
us and thus doesn't seem capable of falling in love. If the filmmakers
wanted the romance to work they should have made Thomas Crown a real
person.
Rene Russo's laughable performance doesn't help the situation any.
Constantly leering, comically self-confident, her character suffers from
a similar ailment as Brosnan's except in her case it's the performer's
fault. She's more of a femme fatale than a human being; a superhero
rather than a woman (Inspector Gadget could have used her presence).
Rene Russo is another factor that keeps the romance from ever going
anywhere. It has a fancy coating but it remains shallow and impersonal;
we see two people falling in love but get no insight into their
relationship.
Despite all of the above, The Thomas Crown Affair remains a moderately
entertaining, engaging movie. It's very well-directed and wonderfully
filmed. It also benefits from what is probably the year's best score:
intricate and beautiful, it not only adds excitement to scenes that very
much need it but it also pulls off the feat of flawlessly and
unintrusively supplementing the action even in scenes where suspense,
which a film's score is predominantly and sometimes exclusively used to
emphasize, takes the back seat to another prevalent emotion.
I can't recommend The Thomas Crown Affair, but I can't say I strongly
disliked it either. It's a film by someone who knows how to make films
and does it well. Unfortunately it's deeply flawed (although the flaws
don't come to you until after the movie) and I can't, with a clear
conscience suggest that you see it over some of the far better movies
this summer. But if your debating whether to see, say, Inspector Gadget
or The Thomas Crown Affair, leap for those Thomas tickets or be sorry.

The Thomas Crown Affair cannot escape. There will be a countless amount of
people that will compare it to the old original and say, wow, that was so much
better. There will also be people that compare to it the recent Entrapment and
say, wow, it's so much better than that stupid. insepid piece of trash. And
that's where The Thomas Crown Affair falls, right about in the middle. While
much more plausible and slick than Entrapment, it fails to have that classic
crime caper feel the original had.
The rich Thomas Crown (Brosnan who's character is basically Bond without the
gunfire) enjoys the breathtaking thrill of stealing. He steals a $100 million
dollar Monet in a very slick and sophisticated way, using a method of
distraction. But Catherine, (Russo who can still strut her stuff) an insurance
investigator, knows he did it. She begins to investigate the case and finds
herself falling in love.
So begins an erotic game of cat and mouse. The bond between Catherine and
Brosnan begins to form and her love for him goes beyond getting the back the
painting. While the chemistry is good, I really didn't think that most of this
stuff could have happened, but this is a highly-styleized (I really hope that
is an actual word and that I spelled it correctly) Hollywood film, so you won't
notice anyway. 
Add in some stunning clothing and you've got The Thomas Crown Affair. Much like
Entrapment, but with more sex (also, a wonderful thing, the two main characters
are actually each other's age!) and romance. It's also a bit slow and features
an annoying Denis Leary character, and topless scenes. But it's still not as
good as the original. But I still think that you would like this fun
crime/romance story that gets *** stars
The Young-Uns: This film contains two sex scenes and three scenes where Rene
Russo appears topless. While none of them are explicit, I'd say the good age is
around 13 or 14.

The only thing worse than a bad sequel is a bad remake.  Bad remakes are
worse because they lower the integrity of the original film somewhat and
if anyone ever tries to remake 'Citizen Kane', 'The Godfather' or 'Star
Wars' they will certainly fail.  A remake of the 1968 film 'The Thomas
Crown Affair' directed by Norman Jewison probably sounded like a good
idea at the time but who knew things could go so wrong.
The original starred Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway and this remake is
with Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo.  Brosnan is a corporate big shot
named Thomas Crown in New York City who has a passion for antique
paintings.  He also likes to steal them.  Not for the cash but for the
sheer pleasure of having them hang in his home.  His latest fancy is a
painting worth one hundred million dollars.  After scooping it up, he
becomes the prime suspect of an investigation headed by an insurance
investigator named Catherine Banning (Rene Russo) and she works with the
NYC police department who, at first, refuse to believe he is a suspect
in the crime.
'The Thomas Crown Affair' takes a familiar path into the silly and
downright unbelievable as it makes Crown the only intelligent man in the
film and Russo is the only other person in the film with similar
intelligence.  All the other characters in the film, the police, the
museum security and anyone else involved in the case are made to look
like bumbling idiots who can't do anything right.  To further bother the
frequent movie goer, the film has Banning falling for the man she's
supposed to be investigating.  Whether or not a remake should
incorporate things found in the original is beside the point.  
I have always found John McTiernan to be a director better suited to
action films than anything else.  Having done the first and third
installments in the 'Die Hard' trilogy along with 'Predator' made
McTiernan a formidable director of action.  He is not suited for
dialogue layered pictures where interaction and sub text are needed. 
His films become shallow in this regard.  McTiernan tries to inject a
little antic he used in 'Die Hard'.  There's a scene in 'The Thomas
Crown Affair' where he has Brosnan use those little explosive hockey
puck devices that explode and create lots of smoke that develop a
diversion to the scene.  
One thing that really bothered me about 'The Thomas Crown Affair' was
the downright staging of the whole thing.  Getting actors to say their
lines in a convincing way is not easy and it's made even more
complicated by the fact that it doesn't help to mumble.  Have you ever
seen those programs about "The Making Of" a certain film where you see
the actors on the set talking between takes --- either to each other or
to the audience and there is a lot of noise around that drowns out what
they're saying so it isn't totally clear?  That's a large part of this
film and many of the scenes look as if they've been done with only a
couple of takes.  
Pierce Brosnan is one of those actors who's only tailor made for a
certain role and his latest attempts at portraying 007 James Bond have
been good ones but his attempts at anything else have been mediocre at
best.  Rene Russo has also been bitten somewhat by the stereotype bug. 
After turns in two 'Lethal Weapon' films and a stint as a secret service
agent in 'In the Line of Fire' in 1993, not to mention starring opposite
a primate in 'Buddy' have given her few qualifications to star in a
remake of a classic motion picture.  Maybe she and Brosnan should do a
sequel to 'The Blue Lagoon'.  It couldn't be much worse than this film.

Starring Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo, Denis Leary, Faye Dunnaway
As Reviewed by MovieKritic2000 (James Brundage)
 Rene Russo finally did it.  She finally gave up her antiquated morals and
her idiotic ideals.  She finally buckled under the pressure of the Hollywood
system. Gentlemen, she finally signed a nudity clause.
 Before multiple slanders such as "sexist pig" go through your mind, please
remember that I am only trying to look on the bright side.  You see, Rene
Russo signing a nudity clause is about the only good aspect in The Thomas
Crown Affair.
 I think a rule is being drafted that anyone that played James Bond gets to
play an anti-bond character in a thief movie.  First we had Sean Connery in
the highly entertaining, highly well plotted (also from a shlock director)
Entrapment.  Now we have Pierce Brosnan in the not entertaining, not well
plotted, from a completely shlock director (John McTiernan, whose other
movie being released in August, The 13th Warrior, has been delayed for over
a year) in The Thomas Crown Affair.
 Seeing as nudity clauses seem to be the only thing the film has going for
it, the movie exploits them at every opportunity.  It is a rare event that I
call a movie exploitative, but, whenever a movie has absolutely no reason to
show someone's breasts yet continues to do so, it is clear that it is highly
aware that it has no other cards in its hand.
 The mediocre cards that The Thomas Crown Affair also contains are a nice
Jazz soundtrack, and a beginning and ending robbery scene that, were the
rest of the movie the same, would make something good.  It plays all three
of them too quick, having each scene last a few seconds.  In between this,
we have the pseudo sex appeal of Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo, which,
despite an R-rating, don't hold a candle to the sex appeal that Sean Connery
and Catherine Zeta-Jones so expertly held over their captive audiences.
 The reason I address sex appeal and other unintelligent matters in this
review, rather than going on my normal intellectual diatribe, is because The
Thomas Crown Affair has so little in the way of plot that it is barely worth
mentioning.  It tries to be both a romance and a crime movie, fails at being
both, and follows the formula boy-steals-Monet, girl-tries-to-get-boy,
boy-sleeps-with-girl, incredible-jealousy-and-mindgames-ensue, and
everything turns out happily ever after at the end.
 As you can see, when The Thomas Crown Affair is broken down to its bare
essentials, it does not offer much.  What it offers instead is the meager
compensation of Rene Russo and Pierce Brosnan going at it like rabbits.
 In short, a perfect example of Hollywood exploitation.
 Soapbox aside, the movie is so utterly weak that it cannot maintain
anyone's interest for more than a few minutes.  Because they are simply
relying on sex appeal, which Rene Russo lost in my mind after her femme
fatale performance in Get Shorty, the actors do not draw you into their
characters.  There is not one iota of emotion for them, not one bit that
makes you care about how the movie ends.
 Pierce Brosnan may very well use his Brit accent to make the girls slobber
over him, and it may very well succeed, but my optimism, my idealism as a
critic is that the audience has at least some intelligence left and will not
just be duped by a nice ass.
 Please don't disappoint me and see this film based solely on its very
cheap, plastic surgery enhanced, assets.

     There are plenty of strange, ironic and otherwise inexplicable things
about Hollywood filmmaking in the 1990s, but among the more puzzling is
the way it treats "star power."  In the glory days of the studio system,
Hollywood packaged stars together in whatever material was available at
the time, always conscious of the fact that audiences would come out to
see certain actors do little more than model wardrobe.  The game has
changed today, but only in the marketing.  Plenty of films exist primarily
to be glossy star packages, but the studios treat that fact as a dirty
little secret.  In these post-modern, indie-hip cinematic times of ours,
it has become unfashionable to admit that sometimes we just like to see
attractive people doing attractive things.
     That's the only explanation for THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR, a star
package so overwhelmingly glossy you may need to shield your eyes from the
glare.  Pierce Brosnan (who, not coincidentally, also produced the film)
stars as the title character, an impossibly wealthy New York mergers and
acquisitions magnate with few worlds left to conquer.  Always on the
lookout for a new thrill, Crown decides to dabble in art theft, arranging
an elaborate decoy so he can snatch a seminal Impressionist masterpiece
from the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Hot on his trail comes Catherine
Banning (Rene Russo), a sort of mercenary insurance investigator
determined to find the thief.  When she decides Crown is her man, she
begins a cat-and-mouse game in which the only question is who will seduce
whom first.
     THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR follows in the fine tradition of the original
1968 version, which itself existed largely as a star vehicle for Steve
McQueen and Faye Dunaway.  The scenery, from the nightspots of the
Manhattan jet set to the tropical islands to which that set jets, is
lovingly photographed.  Director John McTiernan steps back from DIE
HARD-style pacing to establish a moderate, almost jazzy tempo for the
too-cool characters and situations.  The stars, meanwhile, spend nearly
two hours looking fabulous.  Brosnan, who probably emerged from the womb
in a freshly pressed tuxedo, squints in a manly fashion; Russo, attempting
to do for women's underwear what Clark Gable did for T-shirts, does the
little black dress thing with slinky appeal.  They banter, they undress
each other with their eyes, they undress each other with their hands.
Teflon should only be this slick.
     Plenty of viewers will undoubtedly find themselves carried away by
this fantasia for beautiful people.  I might even have been among them if
THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR hadn't grown so angst-y and redundant.  Throughout
the film, we see snippets of Crown visiting a therapist (Dunaway, in the
obligatory cameo-from-the-original), working out his commitment and trust
issues.  It's an early signal that the film is going to play the "sure,
they're beautiful people, but they've got feelings too" card.  It's
entertaining enough to watch as Crown and Banning circle each other, each
one thinking he or she is the manipulator rather than the manipulatee.
Things get considerably more awkward as Banning waffles in her feelings
for Crown with every alternate scene.  Russo plays the final half hour
with such overwrought gravity that you'd think her decision whether or not
to turn Crown in made her Hamlet to his Polonius. 
     I find myself in an awkward position as I criticize THE THOMAS CROWN
AFFAIR, because ultimately I fault it for trying to work in some subtext.
Plenty of films could use a healthy injection of subtext, mind you -- or
the vaugest hint of a text, even -- but this film isn't one of them.  It
fairly screams out to be treated as a caper, with Crown and Banning 
spending their time trying to out-think each other rather than out-emote
each other.  THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR appears to be old-school melodrama, 
the tale of a woman who can't help falling for a guy she knows is bad for
her, and somehow hopes to convert through the intensity of her love.
There's just too much earnestness to the way they play it.  By trying to
play a 1940s story with 1990s emotional realism, the filmmakers miss the
fantasy we're looking for when we watch two movie stars together in a
movie that, ultimately, is about two movie stars together.

THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR
(Metro Goldwyn Mayer, 1999/MPAA Rated R)
Written by Alan Trustman (story)
Peter Doyle, Leslie Dixon & Kurt Wimmer (screenplay)
based on the original screenplay by Alan R. Trustman
Directed by John McTiernan
reviewed by Anthony Bruce Gilpin
GRADE: *** (three of a possible four stars)
REVIEWER'S PROLOGUE--The preview screening of `The Thomas Crown Affair'
contained two types of filmgoers: the ones old enough to remember the
original 1968 film starring Steve McQueen and a very young Faye Dunaway, and
those young enough to not be aware that there is another version. Two women
of the latter demographic sat behind me shortly before the film began. `Wake
me when Pierce takes his shirt off,' one of them quipped.
******************************
     Those of you who are interested in seeing Pierce Brosnan without a
shirt will find a lot to like about `The Thomas Crown Affair.' Those
interested in seeing Rene Russo wearing far less will find even greater
rewards in this remake of the 1968 romantic thriller.
     But director John McTiernan serves up more than just celebrity skin.
`The Thomas Crown Affair' is a sleek, clever update on the story of the
playful gentleman criminal and the beautiful, relentless investigator he
toys with. The film combines a taut, witty,  script,  competent acting,  and
enough action and technical wizardry to remind you that McTiernan directed
`Die Hard.'
     As a bonus, `The Thomas Crown Affair' is sexier than `Eyes Wide Shut,'
without being nearly as bloated and self-important. This film is
entertaining enough to stand on its own, and  will satisfy fans of the
original as well.
     The basics are the same as before: Thomas Crown (Brosnan) is a tycoon
who makes money far too easily to find fulfillment from it. A 1990s guy,
Crown sees a psychiatrist (a cameo by original `Thomas Crown' star Faye
Dunaway) to discuss what's missing in his life.
     The Jet Set and the art of the deal bore Crown, so he amuses himself by
masterminding a daring daylight museum heist, getting away with a $100
million painting, leaving not a clue behind.
     Well, almost. Catherine Banning (Russo), an insurance investigator
working on commission, teams up with the baffled police detectives (Denis
Leary and Frankie R. Faison) and quickly fingers Crown as the prime suspect.
The problem is, they have no evidence.
     More interested in recovering the painting than with nailing the thief,
Catherine enters Crown's world, engaging him in a sexy game of cat and
mouse. Her strategy is to be frank about her intentions, and allow Crown's
arrogance to trip him up. Neither of them planned on falling in love.
     In the end, Crown offers himself as a sacrifice to love. The question
is, will Catherine accept the sacrifice, or the love?
     In the original film, Thomas Crown robbed banks. The shift to the art
world was a good choice; it provides room for a lot of cultural subtext, and
enhances the idea that a life of crime is only a hobby to Crown.
     Any remake of `The Thomas Crown Affair' has a great hurdle to clear:
the chess scene in the original, leading Steve McQueen and the young Faye
Dunaway into what was, arguably, the greatest kiss ever filmed. The Kiss, in
which director Norman Jewison whipped the camera around McQueen and Dunaway
in a dizzying spin, was a classic moment that filmmakers have been ripping
off for 30 years.
     John McTiernan gave The Kiss its due, and put his own mark on it.
Instead of a solitary chess game in a darkened room, Brosnan and Russo share
a steamy dance at a society gala, kissing in the middle of a crowd.
      If `The Thomas Crown Affair' had been made in the 1940s, it might have
starred Cary Grant. Like Grant, Pierce Brosnan has often been dismissed as a
pretty boy with modest acting talent. The truth is that Brosnan is a much
better actor than Grant ever was. As Thomas Crown, Brosnan gives an
intelligent, nuance performance of a driven man who has nothing in life save
his petty amusements.
     Rene Russo's performance proves that she can do extended sex scenes,
and romp nude on a beach in Martinique for a significant portion of the film
and still impress you with her *acting.*
     If anything, this film may be too sexy for its own good. The nudity is
a bit more than is necessary to make the storyteller's point. In addition,
Faye Dunaway's psychiatrist smirks and ridicules at her patient too much,
and seems out of place in the life of a man defined by his arrogant
self-confidence.  And without giving anything away, the final caper is
clever, but unlikely.
     Perhaps the greatest baggage the new film has to deal with is the
original film's Oscar-winning song, `The Windmills of Your Mind.' Alan and
Marilyn Bergman's lyric, with its vaguely psychedelic imagery, is clearly a
product of the 1960s, and could have instantly dated the new film. But music
director Bill Conti skillfully blends Michel Legrand's music with his own,
producing a lush, textured and contemporary score. Be sure to stay until the
closing credits for Sting's new vocal performance of `Windmills.'
     Even considering minor complaints, `The Thomas Crown Affair'  is a
better-than-average summer film for adults.

THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR, THE (director: John McTiernan; screenwriters:
Leslie Dixon/Kurt Wimmer/story by Alan R. Trustman; cinematographer: Tom
Priestley; editor: John Wright; cast: Pierce Brosnan (Thomas Crown),
Rene Russo (Catherine Banning), Denis Leary (Michael McCann), Ben
Gazzara (Andrew Wallace), Esther Canadas (Mystery Woman), Frankie Faison
(Paretti), Fritz Weaver (John Reynolds), Charles Keating (Golchan), Mark
Margolis (Knutzhorn), Faye Dunaway (Psychiatrist); Runtime: 110; 1999)
An updated version from the '60s one, remade with a fresher theme that
is fit for the '90s. The caper is also more fun to watch, has much more
splash to its story line, and is better looking than the original. In
many ways it's a better overall film than the Steve McQueen one, but
retains the same trashy disposable entertainment value. No one will
mistake this middle brow venture for an art film. This version features
an art heist instead of a bank.
The caper is done in a sophisticated manner by an elegant businessman of
a giant financial empire, his motives are derived from his arrogance.
Supposedly, the billionaire is missing two things in his life: a Monet
and a wife. The question becomes which one will he next acquire.
The location has been switched from Boston to New York City, and the
main action takes place in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which was
actually the New York Public Library (the Met frowned on the idea of
having a film showing its security system being penetrated). As an added
connection to the older version, Faye Dunaway who played Rene Russo's
part as the insurance investigator, Catherine Banning, in the original,
now plays the psychiatrist to Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan).
The film looked so glossy and flew by at such an easygoing pace, that it
was an enjoyable guilty pleasure, a delicious Hollywood film for those
looking for escapism and a romance that portends to be steamy and
intimate, but is really glib and only superficially satisfying. It's
more like a James Bond film in its banal idea of what love and adventure
is, as the film rolls out the big-ticket items to impress the viewer. It
shows the things an extremely wealthy man might be into doing, such as
flying his own private airplane, owning a villa on a tropical island,
dating beautiful women, wearing expensive designer clothes (Pierce can't
wear a tux, his contract with the James Bond people stipulates he can
only be properly dressed in a tux in the Bond pics), dining at upscale
restaurants, acquiring an expensive art collection, and playing golf
games where there are wagers of a $100,000 a shot. There is no end to
the bounty of materialism in this film.
The bold robbery of the museum is done with style, as Eastern European
thiefs are smuggled into the museum in a Trojan Horse, but are repelled
when they unknowingly are double-crossed by Thomas Crown. Somehow the
Monet worth $100 million gets stolen, anyhow. The police, led by
detective Michael McCann (Leary), are clueless, but along comes the
stylishly dressed insurance investigator, Catherine (Renee), who
immediately shows the police that she is smarter than they are and puts
them on the trail of Thomas Crown, someone thought to be above reproach.
All they need is to get the proof he did it.
In the closing scene, he steals another valuable picture hanging near
the Monet for Catherine's sake, but he also puts the Monet back in its
place in the museum. It was an ingenious scene, where many impersonators
of a Magritte painting, who are dressed in imitation of the picture, as
inconspicuous businessmen in dark suits and bowler hats, carrying
briefcases, make it difficult for the police to keep tabs on them all.
In the meantime, Thomas has enough time to outfox the police's trap and
accomplish his misdeed.
The film is more about the chessgame of love and trust between the
handsome thief and the beauty who, at first, wants only to catch him and
get her five percent reward. The big question becomes which will each
choose, stolen art or questionable love. The detective is the good guy
who falls for the good looking dame but is not in the high roller
category to pull her in. Renee is the one who gets angry that she has
actually fallen in love with the dapper playboy, not sure if he really
loves her and will just break her heart. Pierce is the picture of
coolness, not giving away his moves until the game is over.
It's a fantasy film fantasizing how good it would be to have so much
money that you can do anything you wanted. The emptiness of those
pleasures rival the film's empty look at romance and adventure, and
should give one pause to think how disappointing it sometimes might be
to get what one wishes for. This is an easy film to take it as it is! It
is a well-crafted star vehicle, whose stars have a good chemistry
together, and there is a bonus--it comes with gorgeous location shots
and lots of plot twists.

**1/2 (out of 4) THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR is a caper movie - the kind of
light crime drama where sophisticated, clever thieves try to pull off
the perfect crime. As capers go, it's smart and well-oiled. The crime
story works wonderfully. The movie only fails when the plot wanders, and
unfortunately, at the end.
This remake of the 1968 movie stars Pierce Brosnan as Thomas Crown:
billionaire, hard-core businessman and art-lover. Rene Russo plays
Catherine, an insurance investigator hired to look into the theft of a
Monet painting from a New York art museum. Catherine quickly deduces
that Crown is the thief. Now she just needs some evidence.
Crown knows how to keep clean during the investigation, which draws it
out longer. Each time they meet, they fall deeper in love. The
protracted investigation becomes a coy game of power, sex, trust,
leverage and love.
Catherine collaborates with Michael (Denis Leary), the NYPD detective
assigned to the case. Michael's law-abiding infatuation throws
Catherine's options into clear contrast. She can choose a rich,
handsome, mature crook or a poor, plain, childish cop.
Catherine and Thomas do make love, and their scenes are pretty steamy.
Both leads are good-looking, mature adults. It was nice to see two
well-matched minds going at each other with their bodies. It draws
attention to how adolescent and male-centric movie sex tends to be.
But good looks and chemistry aside, neither Brosnan nor Russo gives an
outstanding performance. Brosnan manages to be different from 007 only
in subtle ways. Russo was better, but she played her part a little too
broadly.
For most of the movie, the remake improves on the original. The capers
are more elaborate and more smoothly portrayed. The temptations of
wealth are more real. Even the song WINDMILLS OF YOUR MIND is integrated
better. The whole picture just seems to work better than the first
movie.
I won't give it away, but if you're not sure, skip the next paragraph.
The first movie ended in a certain way. It could have just as easily
ended one other way. The new version of the film finds a third way which
is a little too pat. It doesn't entirely compromise the characters'
integrity or the plot's believability, but it does stretch them both too
far.
But those problems aren't all that big and shouldn't detract from
enjoying the film. The interactions between the main characters are
well-thought-out and the intricate set-ups for the crimes, following the
tradition of all good caper movies, are fun to watch.

     Ah, the perils of being a billionaire these days.  Million dollar
mergers, on-site tailors, gourmet meals every night... and the thrill of
stealing priceless works of art just to see if you can get away with it.
     If you can relate to this heady premise, you'll love THE THOMAS
CROWN AFFAIR.  A loose remake of the 1968 THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR, this
version pits Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo against each other in a game
of cat-and-cat.  Brosnan is Thomas Crown, an uber-wealthy NYC tycoon
with an art fetish.  Russo is Catherine Banning, a semi-rogue insurance
investigator who instantly pegs Crown as the thief when the local Monet
goes missing.
     Crown and Catherine then begin the dance of
you-like-me-don't-you-I-thought-so that the too too rich obviously play
every night.  I don't think it's giving away too much to say there's a
scene in which Russo writhes naked while being doused in gin.
     While Brosnan carries this picture entirely on his shoulders (in
fact, I've never seen Brosnan in anything that wasn't fairly good at
least), it's Russo that weighs down this AFFAIR to an extreme.  From the
get-go, it's obvious that Crown has all the cards over Catherine, and
Brosnan's prowess as an actor similarly leaves Russo in the dust.  And
while Russo's hairstyles have obviously been the subject of much
forethought, she always has on too much makeup and just doesn't look the
part of the femme fatale with her enormous, square jaw.  That the entire
movie is shot in extreme close-up doesn't help matters.
     Russo and a tacky Hollywood ending aside, THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR
is a fun and lively thriller with hardly an explosion to wow you.  And
while the asinine ENTRAPMENT visited this exact same premise earlier
this year, and I mean the *exact* same premise, discerning viewers are
bound to appreciate the intelligence with which this film has been
crafted.

   What do you give to the man who has everything?  A
plane?  A horse and some land to play polo?  Women?  An
executive job in a bank?  An exquisite home?  We're not
on the same page: he HAS everything.  What is the guy 
missing in life: Excitement?  You got it.  Flying his own
aircraft, tallying goals, and scoring with women just do not do
it for him. He needs to challenge the establishment.  Burgling
an art museum would be right on the money.  
   When Norman Jewison filmed the original version of "The
Thomas Crown Affair" in 1968 he cast the perfect man in the
title role.  In his private life Steve McQueen, then 36 years
old, was to accumulate 55 cars, 5 planes, and 200
motorcycles as one of the highest-paid actors of the sixties
and seventies, and yet--as his first wife tells us in her book
"My Husband, My Friend," he was abusive and
self-destructive.  McQueen came out of a miserable
background and all the celebrity and money and toys didn't
do it for him either.  (McQueen died at the age of 50 while
undergoing surgery for chest cancer in Mexico.)
   "The Thomas Crown Affair," which was filmed three
decades ago with a plethora of new techniques including the
overuse of split-screen procedures, is such a gem that one
wonders why we need a new version.  Does the current
rendering, which replaces McQueen with Pierre Brosnan and
the 28-year-old Faye Dunaway with the 45-year-old Rene
Russo justify a new entry?  Hardly.  The plot calls for a
steamy, conflicted relationship between a burgler and the
insurance agent who is tracking him down.  Renee Russo is
not appealing enough for the role. She's no Faye Dunaway--
and this has little to do with age, because Ms. Dunaway is
again in the story albeit in a small role of psychiatrist
and looks a lot better and has more pizzazz than the current
star.  As for Pierre Brosnan, he's strikingly handsome, but
he's plastic and no match for Steve McQueen.  Mel Gibson
would have been the man for the role.
   The plot itself is an intriguing one, a cat-and-mouse game
between the friendliest of adversaries.  Director
John McTiernan is dealing metaphorically with two neighborly
people playing a game of chess who are wary an distrustful
of each other because high stakes are involved.  The title
character, Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) is a
multimillionaire who buys and sells properties and owns the
very Manhattan building in which he conducts his affairs. 
Though he golfs on Saturday mornings (thinking nothing of
placing a $100,000 bet on a single shot), plays regularly on
his yacht and flies a plane, he needs some excitement in life-
-which he gets by stealing art works valued in the tens of
millions.  (In the 1968 version, Crown is a bank robber.) 
After engineering an almost inconceivable burglary of a
Monet painting from the Metropolitan Museum of Art--a deed
that would be the envy of Peter Ustinov's character in Jules
Dassin's "Topkapi"--he attracts the attention of a high-
powered insurance investigator, Catherine Banning (Rene
Russo), who somehow senses that Crown is the culprit.
   Implausibly, Crown admits early on that he is the pirate as
the two begin to date and to fall in love with each other.  As
Crown escorts Catherine for a spin in his plane, a sail on his
boat, and even a quick weekend in his Martinique villa,
Crown dares his friendly foe to catch him.  Ultimately a
showdown approaches.  Catherine faces a conflict: will she
flee (perhaps to Brazil) with this clever thief or will she betray
him--turn him over with evidence to Detective Michael
McCann (Denis Leary) and collect her $10 million reward
from the insurance company?
   Director McTiernan seems confused about the time period
of the story.  While "The Thomas Crown Affair" has been
updated to the present from its original 1968 setting, Russo
bursts on the screen not in a business suit as befits a highly
placed insurance investigator but in a glamorous sixties-style
attire.  Though she is in motion throughout, she changes
outfits with such frequency that she gives the impression
she's modeling rather than pursuing a keen, albeit not
dangerous, criminal.  Pierce Brosnan is the biggest problem,
however.  He is so wooden--a trait that perhaps makes him
qualified to play the cool, emotionless 007--that he challenges
his audience to believe she could engender feelings in him
that would have him risk everything to win her over.  Steve
McQueen, by contrast, displayed a more manly appearance
as the original Crown while Faye Dunaway, just 28 years old
at the time, put herself across as both a genuinely
professional investigator and a more alluring and more
conflicted co-conspirator.  
   The colors are lush, images hugging the wide screen that
appropriately captures the joys of great wealth--the private
golf course, a yacht that appears to own the sea, an island
that comes across as the private domain of this one man. 
But will anyone believe he'd risk losing everything for a
woman as bland as Catherine, or that Catherine would throw
her career overboard for plastic man?

Synopsis: 
In the opening of this romance the air conditioning in an art museum
mysteriously malfunctions, and the scorching summer temperature soars high
enough to blank the infrared cameras. Soon a priceless Monet painting is
discovered missing. Catherine (Rene Russo), a lady insurance investigator
wearing a scarf, suspects the manipulative businessman and compulsive
gambler Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) is the culprit. The trouble is, Crown
looks great in a sweater and he owns a beautiful boat. Will Catherine fall
in love, or will she bring Crown to justice?
Opinion:
If I were the cops, I would have nailed Crown by simply fingerprinting the
picture frame which Crown carelessly discarded at the crime scene. But
aside from that, there was potential in this movie that never materialized.
Crown was a man so thirsty for challenge he was getting self-destructive.
And he might meet his equal in an attractive female adversary. The same
went for ace investigator Catherine. She could possibly match wits with
Crown and romance him the same time. And if the sparks didnt fly from the
two lovers one-upping each other there was the added possibility of
romantic competition in the form of Catherines gutsy and hones cop coworker. 
Alas, after the first 20 minutes it was obvious Catherine didnt like the
cop and didnt have the brains to match Crown. So the other two thirds of
this movie was like watching a card game where one guy has all the cards
and everyone else has nothing. The challenge evaporates. Catherine is
reduced to cackling or crying, and everyone stands around waiting to fold.
Pierce Brosnan fans get to see him at his good-looking best, but personally
I think the movie and the romance would have been spicier and sexier had
the protagonists been evenly matched.

`Thomas Crown'  An Affair to Remember
The summer is getting crueler everyday.  As temperatures and humidity
rise, it becomes tougher to find relief from the hot weather.  Perhaps,
our only salvation may be the local Cineplex where we can recline in a
nice chair in a comfortably air conditioned theatre.  But what is there
to see?  I don't want to be mesmerized by swirling special effects.  I
don't want to be sitting on the edge of my seat as fear courses through
my body.  I don't want to watch a comedy.  Just give me an
old-fashioned story that's clever and stylish.  Just give me a film
where the strength of the characters is what carries the film.  Just
give me a film that satisfies from beginning to end.  Just give me `The
Thomas Crown Affair.'
Cool, slick and fun to watch are how I would characterize this remake
of the 1968 classic (then-starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway). 
Here, we see the ever-suave Pierce Brosnan playing the
millionaire/thief and the formidable Renee Russo as his adversary. 
Thomas Crown has got to be every woman's (and probably a lot of men's)
fantasy.  He's rich, handsome, and put the class' in classic. 
Impeccably dressed and a shrewd businessman, he knows what he wants and
has the means to get it.  What can his money not buy?  The answer is a
priceless Monet painting that he so adores, which hangs at the heavily
guarded museum.  An elaborately engineered and extremely clever heist
is pulled.  The improbable theft brings Catherine Banning (Russo) to
town.  She works for the agency that insures the irreplaceable art
piece.  And if she can locate it, she'll be rewarded with a $5 million
finder's fee.  It doesn't take too long before she is convinced that
Crown is her man.
Crown is no wimp.  He teases her, charms her, and practically dares her
to find the painting.  Banning is up to the task.  She receives some
help from the local police detective (a surprisingly terrific Dennis
Leary), but for the most part, she employs her own brand of sex appeal
and smarts to get the job done.  Banning makes it very evident that she
is quite confident in her abilities (and not just her investigative
abilities).  You'll see her at a formal party dancing in a sheer black
dress that shows that she doesn't favor any sort of undergarments.  And
she'll sunbathe in the nude without even thinking twice.  Indeed,
Banning is sexy, smart, and strong.  It's refreshing to see such a
strong female character.
The screenwriters do a fine job of creating two wonderfully competitive
characters, both of whom do what they can to stay one step of the other
person.  Both Brosnan and Russo have amazing screen presence.  The
balance of power swings back and forth like a pendulum, but the movie
hums along as both Crown and Banning take immense satisfaction in the
chase.  An attraction develops and both find themselves faced with the
ultimate challenge.  Both want the Monet.  Both want to keep each
other.  But you can't win one without losing the other.  Handsome to
look at and fun to watch, `The Thomas Crown Affair' is the perfect
summer escape.

Thomas Crown is a man who has everything, but still finds his life
unfulfilling. Although possessing nearly unlimited funds (witness his
impulsive $100,000 bet on one hole of golf simply because it
eradicates his boredom for a few fleeting seconds), Crown (Pierce
Brosnan) lacks the ability to enjoy the simplest pleasures. Even
though his house is staffed with a large live-in crew (including his
lawyer!), he finds himself drowning in a pool of loneliness. 
He does have one hobby, however: planning the perfect crime. More for
a lack of something to do than any real desire to own it, Crown
manages to liberate an invaluable Monet from his favorite art museum. 
Crown's ploy is eventually discovered by Catherine Banning (a
remarkably annoying Rene Russo), an insurance agent in charge of
locating the missing painting, who spends most of the film trying to
decide whether to capture the hero or hop into bed with him. You know,
I think I saw this movie once already this year, only it was called
Entrapment and was a heck of a lot better the first time. 
The Thomas Crown Affair is a remake of the 1968 film of the same name,
which I never saw, but I'm sure it's better than the present
incarnation, simply because people remember it fondly. This version
lacks any discernible entertainment value. Speeches are delivered
without passion, actions are undertaken without urgency, and the
story's most interesting subplot (Crown's theft of the painting and
the repercussions of this action) are cheerfully jettisoned in favor
of a formula romance so stale and unconvincing that it probably
wouldn't have seemed fresh no matter what year the movie was released.
There's a lot of tension and excitement during the opening and closing
scenes, when the crime is at the forefront of the plot, but we sure
have to wade through a swamp of sentamentality inbetween these
bookending sequences. 
But the one thing that hurts the film, that moves it from "mediocre"
to "painful," is its leading lady. As portrayed by Rene Russo, the
character of Catherine Banning is an unsympathetic Gillian
Anderson-wannabe, so confident in her sexuality that she forgets to
display a single redeeming characteristic throughout the course of the
entire movie. She just expects her (if I may speak frankly) very
limited sex appeal to carry her through the events in the story. Russo
is a poor choice for the part: she has neither the dynamic
personality, oozing sexuality, or magnetic screen presence required to
make Banning convincing and likeable. It's not so much that she's a
bad actress, but she's definitely miscast here. Imagine Kathy Bates in
the Catherine Zeta-Jones role from The Mask of Zorro, and you'll
understand what I mean. 
Pierce Brosnan, on the other hand, fares somewhat better. With his
rugged good looks and intense gaze, Brosnan demonstrates the same sort
of charisma he's shown in the James Bond franchise: you may not like
him, but it's hard not to watch whatever he's doing. 
Unfortunately, that's hardly enough to make this movie terribly
memorable.  The film invites us to ponder what we'd do if we had
everything. The execution of "The Thomas Crown Affair" leaves little
doubt in my mind: I'd find a more interesting person to fall in love
with, cut the last ten minutes of deadwood from my story, and spend
less time straying from fascinating crime scenes into a mundane
romance that no one cares about.

         "The Thomas Crown Affair" (1968) was one of those
self-consciously "mod" caper films Hollywood cranked out by the dozens
in the late 1960s, this one starring Steve McQueen as Thomas Crown, a
millionaire who masterminded robberies simply for the thrill of it and
Faye Dunaway as a chic insurance investigator who falls under his spell
while trying to bust him. In its day, the movie's multi-screen imagery
and anti-Establishment theme ("it's me against the system," Crown says
as a rationale for his behavior) struck a chord with young moviegoers,
but it's remembered today, if at all, only for its Oscar-winning theme
song "The Windmills of Your Mind" and for a suggestive chess match
played out by McQueen and Dunaway, a scene mercilessly parodied in
"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me."
 The chess game has been left out of the new "Thomas Crown
Affair," but that doesn't mean stars Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo don't
find plenty of opportunities to fool around. This "Crown," a smarter and
more exciting film than the original, is essentially a two-hour excuse
to get this beautiful couple into one compromising position after
another, usually with some sort of glamorous party or exotic beach
serving as a background. Those viewers who've felt a bit cheated by such
recent squeaky-clean romances as "Runaway Bride" may be intrigued to
hear "Crown" also features some of the most physically challenging
trysts in years. Its R-rating is well-deserved.
 "Crown" also represents a big step forward for Brosnan, whose
non-James Bond screen appearances ("The Mirror Has Two Faces," "The
Lawnmower Man," etc.) have not
exactly established him as a genuine movie star. Here, he demonstrates
his light comic touch and more than holds his own against the
smouldering Russo. They're a pair to reckon with.
 The screenplay by Leslie Dixon and Kurt Wimmer changes the bank
robbery of the first film into an art heist, a crime that better suits
the ever-suave Crown (Brosnan). Investigator Catherine Banning (Russo)
deduces the enigmatic billionaire must have something to do with the
theft -- after all, he once wrecked a $100,000 sailboat just because "he
liked the splash" -- and she follows his trail straight into his arms,
where she learns they have a good deal in common.
 They're both from modest backgrounds, they both enjoy the good
life and both have trouble maintaining long-term relationships. Over
dinner one night she asks him, "is it more fun getting it than keeping
it?" and it's not hard to tell she's asking about more than just the
stolen painting.
 "Crown" shrewdly plays on the time-honored working woman's fantasy of
having it all, as Catherine ends up jetting off to Martinique and having
a passionate fling while still getting her job done. Of course in a
situation like this reality must sooner or later enter the picture, and
when it does our heroine must decide whether she's going to bed her man
or bust him.
 Given that director John McTiernan's resume includes such
now-classic thrillers as "Die Hard" and "The Hunt For Red October," it's
a given the picture's action sequences are smoothly executed. But
McTiernan also knows how to downshift for the quieter scenes, and he
even gets a surprisingly sincere performance out of Denis Leary, who
plays Catherine's somewhat sympathetic partner in crime-fighting.
 "This is an elegant crime done by an elegant person," Catherine
declares at one point. That verdict applies to the movie as well. James
