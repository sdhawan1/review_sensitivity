PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Errol Morris' work is unmistakable.  The celebrated documentary
filmmaker blends familiar music, extreme close-ups and slow-motion shots
that fluctuate between polished color and rich black-and-white as Morris
focuses his lens on slightly deranged yet exceptionally passionate
subjects.  In Mr. Death, Morris (Fast, Cheap and Out of Control) selects
a Massachusetts engineer to plunk down in front of his camera.
Of course Fred Leuchter, Jr. isn't your average engineer from New
England.  He's an expert in the construction of execution equipment.
Leuchter is all for the death penalty, but is sickened by torturous
executions caused by antiquated equipment that could potentially result
in unnecessary grief for both the prisoner and any witnesses present at
the execution.  He's helped build a better electric chair for the
Tennessee State Prison, created a lethal injection system for New
Jersey, and designed a new helmet for the North Carolina electric chair
(the previous model was still younger than Jesse Helms).
It's easy to get wrapped up in Leuchter's enthusiasm for his
profession.  He takes his work very seriously, a fact that becomes
evident as he describes the delicately emotional relationship between
prison guards and death-row inmates.  And it only takes Leuchter about
sixty seconds to sum up this connection, compared to the three-plus-hour
message delivered by the unwieldy film The Green Mile.  It's this kind
of efficiency that drove the chain-smoking caffeine addict to the top of
his game.
But a steady diet of coffee and cigarettes can also warp your
sensibility, as exhibited when Mr. Death switches focus from Leuchter's
work background to a criminal trial in Toronto during the late 80s.
Revisionist Historian Ernst Zundel, accused of publishing false
statements (a crime in Canada) concerning the denial of the Holocaust,
contracted Leuchter to examine forensic evidence from the eastern
European concentration camps and gas chambers to prove his innocence.
Despite the fact that Zundel was a well-known neo-Nazi and the publisher
of a book called "The Hitler We Loved and Why,' Leuchter eagerly jumps
at the opportunity to step into the limelight, figuring that the trial
could be the crowning achievement of his career.  What he doesn't expect
is vocational execution, hence the lengthy title of the film.
Morris is in top form here, once again taking subject matter that I
would equate with watching paint peel and turning it into an
almost-riveting ninety-minute film.  His ability to lay out the story of
his subject is second-to-none and  thanks to cinematographer Robert
Richardson (Snow Falling on Cedars)  also beautifully photographed.
Morris effectively splits the film in halves, with the first
establishing Leuchter as a harmless nerd and the second showing that
evil can illuminate from the most unexpected sources.
1:30  PG-13 for mild adult language and a scene depicting the execution
of an elephant

Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter, Jr.
Fred A. Leuchter Jr., a man who improved the electric chair, gallows, and the 
lethal injection machine in the 1980s, should not expect his research to 
concern a large audience. After all, only those receiving capital punishment 
would ever get to experience his work. So maybe Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall 
of Fred A. Leuchter, Jr. is supposed to educate its audience about his 
progress in the field. We certainly learn more about the before and after of 
the electrocution process than most will ever need to know. Leuchter is so 
straightforward when he explains why two shocks of electricity must be used, 
or lists everything that could go wrong with a hanging that his graphic 
statements are never short of sickening. He is dismayed there is no interest 
in making executions more humane. Looking for any way possible to increase 
awareness of his research, Leuchter agreed to travel to Poland to investigate 
sites thought to have been gas chambers during the Holocaust for Ernst 
Zundel. Zundel published a pamphlet claiming the Holocaust was a hoax, and 
was brought to court in Canada for printing something he knew was false. 
After some rather amateurish investigation, Fred believes there was no way 
any type of gas chamber could have existed. One gets an even better sense of 
this disturbing man as the film goes on from interviews with his wife and 
others.
This is probably one of the closest attempts to making a documentary horror 
film ever. Fred A. Leuchter Jr. is one of the most interesting subjects to 
come along in a while. When he drones on (sounding amazingly like Woody 
Allen) about why a lethal injection machine is totally different from an 
electric chair he sent chills down my spine. Even scarier is the thought that 
this man is an actual person. His odd appearance, Austin Powers yellow teeth, 
and bizarre coffee addiction makes him even creepier. Errol Morris has an 
exciting visual style that is defined, but never glossy. The movie is always 
attention grabbing for its entire ninety-one minute running time.  
Mr. Death certainly raises questions of free speech. Regardless how many Jews 
disappeared from the planet, Zundel’s trial does raise questions that could 
perhaps be relevant to other cases or situations. Queries also arise about 
the accuracy of Fred’s research. Not only is seeing him illegally rummaging 
through piles of rubble surrounding Holocaust ruins disrespectful, it is 
downright frightening. In one interview the scientist who tested Leuchter’s 
samples of walls and soil from Poland for traces of cyanide reveals he 
probably did the tests wrong. Since cyanide only leaves traces about the size 
of a tenth of a human hair, it is uncertain whether or not the negative 
results are accurate. Looking into his eyes as he admits to probably 
performing the wrong procedures is daunting. These scientific errors could 
happen to you.
This is not an entirely great film, but certainly a unique one that looks at 
death and persons who do not believe in the Holocaust with care and a sense 
of fairness. This is a rare documentary because it examines both sides of the 
issue. Take a journey with Fred A. Leuchter Jr. and you will be disturbed and 
entertained in a way different to anything you’ve experienced before.

MR. DEATH: THE RISE AND FALL OF FRED A. LEUCHTER, JR. (director/writer:
Errol Morris; cinematographer: Peter Donohue; editor: Karen Schmeer;
cast: David Irving, Fred A. Leuchter Jr., James Roth, Shelly Shapiro,
Suzanne Tabasky, Robert Jan Van Pelt, Ernst Zündel, 1999)
Errol Morris's unorthodox documentary is about the son of a
Massachusetts prison superintendent of transportation who grew up in the
prison atmosphere and later on went into the business of upgrading
traditional Death Row equipment, and as his reputation grew among prison
personnel because of his technical skills, so did the amount of business
he procured from the different states all over the country, all with
supposedly antiquated and insufficient killing systems. What makes Fred
A. Leuchter, Jr. a most challenging subject for the documentary
filmmaker: is that the story tries to explore a kind of evil that is
hard to put one's finger on, being that Leuchter is not necessarily an
evil person, but someone whom it is hard to put a label on, yet the
causes that he advances because of his vanity- is evil. His bad
notoriety comes about only when he backs a neo-Nazi group and thereby
forsakes his reputation.
Errol Morris knows what he is after in this film and mines it out of his
resourceful subject. He has found a peculiar kind of individualist in
Leuchter, someone who blindly thinks he knows what the truth is, who
trusts that he couldn't be wrong if he believes something, thereby
shutting off any other means of hearing the truth but through his own
vanity. This hubris is a trait he shares with many idealogues, to a
certain degree. But it is this mania that Leuchter has, that won't be
shaken out of him, that makes him such a compelling study, someone who
appears to be a sincere and mild-mannered man, but despite those
characteristics, he turns out to be a most obstinate fellow, someone who
is driven by his own egomania, willing to fight to his death for what he
believes in.
He is a self-taught engineer by training, who found himself motivated by
his sense of compassion for the need for more efficient and "humane"
execution devices to be invented. He is a tiny, mousy, and loquacious
man, someone who compulsively can't stop talking about what he does for
a living, which lends a dismal sense of perverse comedy for half the
film until his unchecked demeanor began to grate on me and he became
overbearing. He is a lonely and sad soul, someone who craves acceptance,
who is limited only by his lack of insight. It is not hard to think of
him as a twerp, whose expertise in executions seems to be real enough
but who otherwise is a strangely enigmatic man, someone whom it is not
possible to really penetrate. He is someone who disturbingly can't think
straight about things that most any child would have little trouble
with, such as knowing the difference between what is right and wrong.
Who he is, can only be answered by what he does for a living. He is
someone who improved the functioning of the modern electric chair, gave
America a better electric chair helmet, built gas chambers in a more
efficient manner, improved the techniques of the lethal injection by
cutting down on human error, and built a better gallows for hangings by
making a better trapdoor. In other words, like the Nazis who gave
Germany more technical efficiency, he is the perfect imitation of them
in spirit. Yet, he is someone who isn't even aware that he might be a
Nazi, he has so desensitized himself of any sense of moral consciousness
and responsibility for his actions. The filmmaker allows him to be
viewed as he sees himself and how those who were involved with him see
him, and the consensus is, that he is someone who craves the limelight -
even if this attention results in the loss of his career.
I think that he had to know when he joined forces with a neo-Nazi group
what he was doing and what kind of risky political stand he was taking,
and that he would be considered part of that hate group of Holocaust
deniers, that there could be no way he could continue to maintain that
he is not an anti-Semite and be believed. Certainly not by Holocaust
survivors, who are used in the film to tell what they think of him. To
think otherwise, that he is just an innocent fool, would be to deny what
is the obvious. Yet, he is presented as someone who was naively
influenced by the limelight to do what he did and was not motivated by a
political agenda.
Earl Morris makes documentaries about as good as anyone ever has,
tackling subjects that others would shy away from (this being his
seventh feature- some others are-Gates of Heaven/Fast, Cheap & Out of
Control/The Thin Blue Line). His works are not mere biographies or
Hollywood driven achievement celluloids, but poetics of the cinema that
sing to our inner sense of being, that make us think about the life of
the person on film in a way that we most likely wouldn't have thought
about them if we had not seen what Morris saw and presented us with. His
subjects are about those who are considered eccentric because they are
not clones, or clichés, or anything but unique individuals whose
behavior is dictated by their very unusual personal obsessions, no
matter what society might think of the strange path they have taken.
This film is no exception and like the director's other works, it's a
visual testament to the human spirit, warts and all.
Fred Leuchter Jr. is one of those ordinary looking people who is so
driven by complexly different forces in him, that his tale is wracked
with wonderment at how someone could be both a technical genius and such
a damn fool. In an odd way, because of his individualism, he is even
appealing, which makes this a very scary film--as ultimately, it is
about how evil flourishes if it goes unanswered.
The career of Leuchter caught fire when there was a need for the
consultant services he provided the prisons, as not many other
engineers, for mainly moral reasons, wanted to be involved with the
instruments of death. Also, he got most of the prison contracts because
he offered prison officials good prices for his work. Prison officials
didn't quite understand their equipment, which in most cases either was
built by inmates or electricians who didn't have the know-how. In most
prisons, the correct amount of currency it took to kill a prisoner
without making the execution into a torture, was not common knowledge.
As a result, he was esteemed in the community of penal corrections for
his contributions in improving the efficiently of their instruments for
capital punishment, that is, until everything came crashing down on him.
Leuchter is disarming when he is talking with love about the equipment
he put together and how well it works, and how compassionate he is for
those being executed, wishing only for them to have a good execution. He
faces the camera with the crooked smile of a child who doesn't want you
to think badly of him, even if you already know he has put his hand in
the cookie jar and stolen the goods.
His downfall comes, when he is invited by a neo-Nazi group to give them
scientific proof that the gas chambers weren't part of the Holocaust. He
is to be an expert witness at a trial of one of the hate groups'
propagandists, Ernst Zündel, who is on trial for violating Canada's law
forbidding Holocaust denial and for spreading lies that can incite
racial hatred, and by his writing of the Holocaust revisionist pamphlet
entitled "Did Six Million Really Die?" He and his anti-Semite cronies
enlist Leuchter to go to the concentration camps in Poland and gather
evidence that the Holocaust didn't take place and for him to do their
bidding for them to make their group look legitimate in the scientific
community. For anyone in their right mind to believe such garbage, is
beyond comprehension. For anyone to have done what Leuchter did and not
be an anti-Semite himself is, in my opinion, very unlikely. But in the
case of this very strange man, the viewers have a chance to decide for
themselves what Leuchter is all about, after hearing him say he has not
backed the neo-Nazi group because he is a bigot, but he did so because
he believed they were scientifically right in denying the Holocaust.
As a result of the trial, Zundel is found guilty and Leuchter's forensic
reports are found to be unscientific and inaccurate, filled with a
multitude of things he never even evaluated and that the ones he
evaluated were tested in the wrong way. The Dutch concentration camp
historian, Robert Jan Van Pelt, is the real champion of truth in this
film, as he goes into detail how ludicrous Leuchter's so-called research
was and how evil it was for him to go into a place like Auschwitz and
into a crematorium like the infamous number two, where 500,000 Holocaust
victims died, and then have the gall to say that there was no gas
chambers there, when it is evident he didn't know how to test for
cyanide, being that it can only be tested from samples taken on the
surface of the stones, since the gas can't penetrate further. Leuchter's
tests were diluted too much by going into the depths of the walls, where
it would be impossible to find traces of the gas. The historian also
points out how Leuchter never checked the camp records which clearly
showed documentations of gas chambers and ventilation systems.
Leuchter became not just a witness at the trial for neo-Nazis, which is
bad enough, but he also went on the lecture circuit for these Holocaust
denial revisionist groups, enjoying the neo-Nazi groups' affection and
applause. His waitress wife didn't appreciate that he took her for her
honeymoon to the concentration camps and she divorced him soon after
their marriage. The prisons stopped hiring him, which he blames on
Jewish groups putting the pressure on them. He also complains of being
brought up on charges of falsifying his credentials by the state of
Massachusetts. He is pictured as a man who is now walking on a lonely
trail, as Van Pelt says, "a fool who has stepped in the Holy of Holies."
He's an earnest man, if nothing else, who says he drinks forty cups of
coffee and smokes six packs of cigarettes a day. But he is as
recalcitrant today as he was at the trial, failing to admit that he was
wrong, even after it was conclusively shown that he had no clue how to
test for cyanide and his refusal to understand that the concentration
camps had undergone repeated changes since the days of the Holocaust,
which had made his unauthorized tests of chopping up bricks
inconclusive. All he could say as a rejoinder to his accusers, is that
the execution by cyanide is too impractical a method of genocide: "Why
didn't the Nazis just shoot them all?" The answer is simple, the Nazis
lost track of what it was like to be a human being, and they were
determined to use science to carry out their genocide in an impersonal
way. To answer their critics that they were brutes, the Nazis did what
he is doing now, spread the Big Lie that the Holocaust never took place.
This documentary offers one of the most pertinent looks at two highly
charged emotional subjects: capital punishment and the Holocaust, which
makes for a devastating comparison. What's also worth noting, is how
acceptable and rational Leuchter is until the moment the neo-Nazis take
hold of him. That should give one some food for thought about the
American penal system and how it is used to punish offenders. A highly
recommended film.

   Hitler promulgated the Big Lie technique in his rambling
autobiography, "Mein Kampf."  Tell a flagrant lie often
enough--making sure it's a whopper (because people would
not believe a small fib)--and people will accept it.  One of the
biggest lies of the 20th century is that the Holocaust never
happened.  Despite mountains of evidence--documentation,
testimony of thousands of survivors, interviews with people
on all sides of World War 2 including talks with the population
of the areas surrounding the smoke-filled crematoria--a
relatively small but influential cabal of revisionists insists that
the Holocaust is a myth.  Never mind that six million Jews
disappeared from the face of the earth.  Take a fact that
people today would rather not admit, simply deny it, and poof:
you have a coterie of followers.  These adherents are not just
neo-Nazis: Holocaust deniers include bubbleheads and naifs
as well.  An engineer from Malden, Massachusetts, one Fred
A. Leuchter, could not be called a bubblehead, but this
mousy guy who before 1988 had never traveled abroad--
ostensibly eager for attention, celebrity status, and gullible to
boot--became one of America's leading spokesmen for the
Big Lie.  Though insisting to this day that he is in no way
anti-Semitic (very likely true), he was determined to prove
that the structures built by the Nazis in Poland to eliminate
Jews and "undesirables" simply were not gas chambers. 
What, then happened to the millions who perished in the
camps?  Leuchter does not go into this.  His aim was simply
to prove via forensic evidence that the stones that formed the
basis of the chambers were never touched by poisonous
gases.
   If Leuchter did nothing but get his infamous report
published in a dozen or so languages, he would be an
interesting enough subject for a documentary.  But Leuchter
is in other ways quite an unusual fellow, one whose
contributions require an ace documentarian to elicit.  Simply
getting the man to talk freely and articulately for the cameras-
-as could interviewers like Fred Wiseman and Claude
Lanzmann--would itself be daunting.  But Errol Morris, who
filmed this fascinating journey of discovery, was the man for
the job.  To his credit, Morris has given us such films as "The
Thin Blue Line," a 1988 blockbuster which proved that a
hitchhiker did not kill a Dallas policeman in 1976--and that the
lowlife who fingered him (and who wound up on Death Row
for a subsequent murder) did.  That remarkable documentary,
which employed a score by Philip Glass, led to the reopening
of the case.  The defendant was cleared.  Morris's most
complex documentary, however, "A Brief History of Time,"
dealt with the work of physicist Stephen Hawking, while his
least accessible film, "Fast Cheap & Out of Control" looks at
the lives of four totally different men and tries to meld the
quartet (unsuccessfully, I thought), into an examination of the
nature of existence itself.
   Why, then, did Morris choose Leuchter as his subject this
year?  Leuchter would have been the ideal subject for the
long defunct TV series, "What's My Line."  Arlene Francis
herself would not have guessed his profession.  As an
engineer interested in making executions more humane and
dignified for both the executees (as he calls them) and for
their guards, he was called in as a consultant by several
states to look over their death machines and to suggest
changes.  We see him in the modern, antiseptic Tennessee
death house, where he explains the methodology of the
electric chair and discusses the changes he proposed to
make a shocking death more merciful.  We learn that the
executioner delivers two shocks: one a brief jolt that cooks
the guy's nervous system and renders him all but dead. The
second jolt, lasting a minute of so, finishes him off.  The
trouble with some of these executions, Leuchter reminds us,
is that in some cases excessive electricity cooks the killer so
that his eyeballs fly across the room and, as in one Florida
case, his head could catch fire.  Leuchter's skill in designing
better straps and helmets for the Tennessee hot seat gave
him an immediate contract in another state to re-build its gas
chamber.  Leuchter's career was on a roll.  Until...
   ...until a neo-Nazi, Ernst Zundel, published a tract in
Canada "Did 6 Million Really Die?" which argued that the
Holocaust was nothing but hate propaganda.  Put on trial for
violating Canada's law forbidding Holocaust denial (a form of
hate), Zundel convinced Leuchter to go to Auschwitz to
attempt to prove that the gas chambers simply did not exist. 
When Leuchter visited the buildings in the infamous Polish
town--taking his new wife Carolyn with him as their
"honeymoon" as well as a cinematographer and translator--he
secretly and illegally scraped samples of the stone walls to
take home with him.  Delivering the pulverized samples to a
Massachusetts lab, he received a report that there was no
trace of cyanide in the specimens.  Assuring his public both
in his writings and in a flurry of conferences before largely
sympathetic groups that traces of cyanide would have
remained on the stones forever, he failed to report that by
breaking his specimens into parts no more than 1/10,000 of
the original stones, he watered down the segments to such
an extent that no gas could possibly be present.
   Thinking that his finding would enhance his career, he was
dismayed when he lost all his contracts with the death
houses and when even his wife left him for good.  
   Documentaries usually aim for variety by presenting a large
number of talking heads, the documentarian interviewing
each and switching back and forth to give the viewer the
impression of diversity.  In this case--while some interviews
are held with Jewish groups, with a scientist in the
Massachusetts lab, with the neo-Nazi who interested
Leuchter in the journey to Poland--Morris concentrates almost
exclusively on Leuchter himself.  This guy, deluded as he is,
"wearing blinders" as others described him, and easily
influenced by heinous anti-Semites, is strangely difficult to
dislike.  Though somewhat mousy behind his thick glasses
and small stature, Leuchter--who admits to drinking 40 cups
of coffee going through six packs of cigarettes  a day--is
difficult to detest.  He is articulate through his pronounced
New England accent but never resorts to throat-clearers like
"you know," "like," "uh," and other disturbing mannerisms that
could make the typical audience for a documentary bolt for
the doors.  He seems to prove something we liberal arts
students back in college always said about the engineering
students: that while they actually build things, we could think. 
Leuchter, for all his training, comes across lacking in
Education with a capital E.  In a sense he is like the Nazis
themselves--highly efficient in what they did but absolutely,
disastrously psychotically wrongheaded in their mission.  Just
as Hitler destroyed his own country while trying to bring it to
his perverted idea of greatness, so Leuchter destroyed his
career and even his social life.  Now bereft of jobs, family
and friends, he seems to have difficulty even selling the lethal
injection machine he designed and half completed when the
state canceled his contract and threw the gadget at him to
keep.  This powerful and perversely humorous film, however,
has the opposite consequence for Errol Morris, who comes
out as one of the country's premier documentarians with yet
another compelling film on his resume.

     We're going to have to create a new designation for Errol Morris,
because "documentary filmmaker" just doesn't seem to cut it. Yes, Morris'
subjects have all been real-life people in films like THE THIN BLUE LINE,
A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME and FAST, CHEAP & OUT OF CONTROL. He has also
opted to up the ante for what a non-fiction film can be, staging visually
compelling vignettes or using re-creations to impose his artistic vision
on the story he's trying to tell. It's no wonder Morris' films have
consistently been overlooked by the more tradition-bound documentarians of
the Motion Picture Academy. Call him a maker of non-fiction films if you
must ... or simply a director.
     With MR. DEATH: THE RISE AND FALL OF FRED A. LEUCHTER, JR., Errol
Morris has given us another reason to toss out the term "documentary
filmmaker" -- as striking as the film is, it sometimes feels a bit thin on
background detail. Morris' latest subject is another man with a unique
obsessive interest: Fred A. Leuchter, Jr., a Massachusetts-based execution
technology enthusiast. After becoming aware of the horrendous quality of
most capital punishment equipment, Leuchter became an expert in designing
more effectvie and humane electric chairs, lethal injection machines and
gas chambers for states' prison systems. His expertise in this field led
him down a life-changing road when he was asked to be a witness in the
defense of Ernst Zundel, a revisionist historian charged in Canada with
disseminating propaganda denying the truth of the Holocaust. After
visiting the ruins of the Nazi camps at Auschwitz, Birkenau and Majdanek,
Leuchter concludes that they could not have included gas chambers. While
his "Leuchter Report" was not admitted at the trial, it has become one of
the most widely disseminated pieces of "evidence" for those who claim
there was no Holocaust.
     Leuchter's involvement in the 1988 Zundel trial begins a downward
spiral in his career, as states terminate contracts and Holocaust
remembrance groups assail the science in his report (chemist James Roth,
who performed the "Leuchter Report" tests, supports the contention that
Leuchter's tests were miserably designed). While activists argue that
Leuchter's work for revisionist groups marks him an anti-Semite, Morris
paints a slightly different picture. Leuchter becomes a vivid character in
the film, a "mouse of a man" (in Zundel's words) with a Boston Brahmin
accent and an unshakeable conviction that he is right. He comes off as a
unique sort of egotist, a man so used to playing God in his manufacture of
instruments of death that infallibility becomes part of his self-image.
     It would be a helpful bit of information in the formation of that
picture for us to know that Leuchter's academic background had nothing to
do with engineering or chemistry, but was in fact in history. Though
Leuchter does discuss a move by the state of Massachusetts to prosecute
him as an unlicensed engineer late in the film, his background would seem
to be much more important than the casual inclusion Morris gives it. In
fact, MR. DEATH leaves much about Leuchter only peripherally explored: his
relationship with his wife of only a few months (who speaks but does not
appear on screen); his reactions to the fame/infamy inspired by the
"Leuchter Report;" his strangely superstitious response to a mysterious
image in a photo of one of his electric chairs. Morris lets Leuchter talk
about himself for a very long time, but he doesn't probe. In this case,
the approach leaves holes in the story.
     That doesn't make MR. DEATH a failure as a film. Indeed, a
less-than-perfect Errol Morris documentary is still infinitely more
watchable than most conventional documentaries. Some viewers may find his
stylized renderings of his subject -- Leuchter the coffee addict
reflected in a cup of coffee; Leuchter filmed between flashing electrodes
like a modern Dr. Frankenstein -- distracting or inappropriate. Others
will find them part of Morris' ongoing reinvention of the form. It is
surprising, however, that this may be the first Morris' documentary that's
more interesting as a cinematic experience than it is as a learning
experience. As a documentarian, Morris is a singular artist. In Fred
Leuchter, he's left an enigmatic unfinished portrait.

of ****)
Errol Morris cements his reputation as the premier contemporary
documentary filmmaker with this fascinating look at Fred Leuchter, a
Massachusetts engineer whose specialty is tending to execution equipment.
 What begins an oddly endearing account of an odd man and his odd
occupation becomes gradually darker--and even more absorbing--as
Leuchter, being an "expert" on gas chambers and the like, is recruited by
Holocaust denier Ernst Zündel to travel to Auschwitz and conduct a
forensic analysis the "presumed" gas chambers.  His report--in which he
effectively "proves" that the Holocaust never happened--becomes a
cornerstone of Holocaust deniers' beliefs while most others, in
particular Jewish activists, are repulsed by his actions.
Morris leaves no doubt in the audience's mind that Leuchter is wrong; as
a counter to his claims, he interviews a number of experts on the
Holocaust and science who completely debunk Leuchter's "findings" by
covering every way his research went wrong.  But instead of taking the
easy approach of labeling Leuchter as being an evil person and exploring
just how bad he is, Morris is more interested in showing how a normal
person can fall into the trap of doing and believing in such morally
questionable things.  One does not necessarily like Leuchter by the end
of _Mr._Death_, but one is able to at least somewhat understand him and
why he thinks the way he does--a deeper step that makes the film as
exceptional as it is.  (opens December 29)

"Executions 'R Us" could read the business card of Fred A. Leuchter Jr.,
the engrossing subject of Errol Morris's latest documentary, MR. DEATH:
THE RISE AND FALL OF FRED A.  LEUCHTER JR.
Morris (FAST, CHEAP, AND OUT OF CONTROL) has an incredible gift for
finding unusual subjects that is exceeded only by his talent for
mesmerizing filmmaking.  His camerawork choices are both beautiful and
insightful.  And he manages to find humor without ever resorting to
cheap shots and to make the potentially repugnant absolutely riveting.
In a film with two distinct but seamless parts, Morris presents us with
the life of engineer Leuchter.  Since his father worked at a prison, the
young Leuchter visited him at work and became friends with the inmates.
Through this he developed an interest in prisons, specifically
executions.  "I was very concerned about the humanitarian aspects of
death by torture," Leuchter explains.
Before Leuchter came along, electric chairs were generally built by
inmates or electricians, not based on any blueprint or design but on
seeing a picture of some other state's old electric chair.  This led to
some pretty horrific executions when the chair did not serve its
intended purpose of putting a person to death as quickly and as
painlessly as possible.
"I am a proponent of capital punishment," Leuchter tell us.  "I am not a
proponent of capital torture." A weird guy, described as "a mouse of a
man," he drinks 40 cups of coffee and smokes 6 packs of cigarettes every
day.  He is as sincere as he is delusional about the limits of his
expertise.
With his big geeky glasses with thick lenses, he'd fit right in as a
Silicon Valley engineer, the type who thinks he knows everything since
he's had success in one area.  After becoming well known for his high
quality electric chairs, other states start asking him to build their
death machines, even if they involve poison gas, hanging or lethal
injection -- all areas about which Leuchter knows almost nothing, which
he initially finds amusing.  The fame quickly goes to his head, and he
gets a deluded sense of his scientific abilities
The second half of the picture concerns his downfall, when he is asked
to testify at a Canadian trial of a Holocaust denier.  During a
surreptitious visit to Auschwitz, he makes a few ill-conceived
experiments and declares that no one died there from poison gas.  The
movie is at it's most convincing when it easily disproves Leuchter's
disproof of the annihilation of the Jews.
Going from very modest fame and fortune to oblivion, he is not able to
get his reputation back.  His descent proves more rapid than his ascent.
"He wasn't putting his name on the line because he had no name," one man
explains about Leuchter's trial testimony.  "He came from nowhere and he
went back to nowhere."
Morris's gripping film tells a fascinating story of a little man who let
his accomplishments inflate his ego until it burst.
MR. DEATH: THE RISE AND FALL OF FRED A. LEUCHTER JR. runs a fast 1:31.
It is rated PG-13 for mature themes and would be fine for teenagers.

   Hitler promulgated the Big Lie technique in his rambling
autobiography, "Mein Kampf."  Tell a flagrant lie often
enough--making sure it's a whopper (because people would
not believe a small fib)--and people will accept it.  One of the
biggest lies of the 20th century is that the Holocaust never
happened.  Despite mountains of evidence--documentation,
testimony of thousands of survivors, interviews with people
on all sides of World War 2 including talks with the population
of the areas surrounding the smoke-filled crematoria--a
relatively small but influential cabal of revisionists insists that
the Holocaust is a myth.  Never mind that six million Jews
disappeared from the face of the earth.  Take a fact that
people today would rather not admit, simply deny it, and poof:
you have a coterie of followers.  These adherents are not just
neo-Nazis: Holocaust deniers include bubbleheads and naifs
as well.  An engineer from Malden, Massachusetts, one Fred
A. Leuchter, could not be called a bubblehead, but this
mousy guy who before 1988 had never traveled abroad--
ostensibly eager for attention, celebrity status, and gullible to
boot--became one of America's leading spokesmen for the
Big Lie.  Though insisting to this day that he is in no way
anti-Semitic (very likely true), he was determined to prove
that the structures built by the Nazis in Poland to eliminate
Jews and "undesirables" simply were not gas chambers. 
What, then happened to the millions who perished in the
camps?  Leuchter does not go into this.  His aim was simply
to prove via forensic evidence that the stones that formed the
basis of the chambers were never touched by poisonous
gases.
   If Leuchter did nothing but get his infamous report
published in a dozen or so languages, he would be an
interesting enough subject for a documentary.  But Leuchter
is in other ways quite an unusual fellow, one whose
contributions require an ace documentarian to elicit.  Simply
getting the man to talk freely and articulately for the cameras-
-as could interviewers like Fred Wiseman and Claude
Lanzmann--would itself be daunting.  But Errol Morris, who
filmed this fascinating journey of discovery, was the man for
the job.  To his credit, Morris has given us such films as "The
Thin Blue Line," a 1988 blockbuster which proved that a
hitchhiker did not kill a Dallas policeman in 1976--and that the
lowlife who fingered him (and who wound up on Death Row
for a subsequent murder) did.  That remarkable documentary,
which employed a score by Philip Glass, led to the reopening
of the case.  The defendant was cleared.  Morris's most
complex documentary, however, "A Brief History of Time,"
dealt with the work of physicist Stephen Hawking, while his
least accessible film, "Fast Cheap & Out of Control" looks at
the lives of four totally different men and tries to meld the
quartet (unsuccessfully, I thought), into an examination of the
nature of existence itself.
   Why, then, did Morris choose Leuchter as his subject this
year?  Leuchter would have been the ideal subject for the
long defunct TV series, "What's My Line."  Arlene Francis
herself would not have guessed his profession.  As an
engineer interested in making executions more humane and
dignified for both the executees (as he calls them) and for
their guards, he was called in as a consultant by several
states to look over their death machines and to suggest
changes.  We see him in the modern, antiseptic Tennessee
death house, where he explains the methodology of the
electric chair and discusses the changes he proposed to
make a shocking death more merciful.  We learn that the
executioner delivers two shocks: one a brief jolt that cooks
the guy's nervous system and renders him all but dead. The
second jolt, lasting a minute of so, finishes him off.  The
trouble with some of these executions, Leuchter reminds us,
is that in some cases excessive electricity cooks the killer so
that his eyeballs fly across the room and, as in one Florida
case, his head could catch fire.  Leuchter's skill in designing
better straps and helmets for the Tennessee hot seat gave
him an immediate contract in another state to re-build its gas
chamber.  Leuchter's career was on a roll.  Until...
   ...until a neo-Nazi, Ernst Zundel, published a tract in
Canada "Did 6 Million Really Die?" which argued that the
Holocaust was nothing but hate propaganda.  Put on trial for
violating Canada's law forbidding Holocaust denial (a form of
hate), Zundel convinced Leuchter to go to Auschwitz to
attempt to prove that the gas chambers simply did not exist. 
When Leuchter visited the buildings in the infamous Polish
town--taking his new wife Carolyn with him as their
"honeymoon" as well as a cinematographer and translator--he
secretly and illegally scraped samples of the stone walls to
take home with him.  Delivering the pulverized samples to a
Massachusetts lab, he received a report that there was no
trace of cyanide in the specimens.  Assuring his public both
in his writings and in a flurry of conferences before largely
sympathetic groups that traces of cyanide would have
remained on the stones forever, he failed to report that by
breaking his specimens into parts no more than 1/10,000 of
the original stones, he watered down the segments to such
an extent that no gas could possibly be present.
   Thinking that his finding would enhance his career, he was
dismayed when he lost all his contracts with the death
houses and when even his wife left him for good.  
   Documentaries usually aim for variety by presenting a large
number of talking heads, the documentarian interviewing
each and switching back and forth to give the viewer the
impression of diversity.  In this case--while some interviews
are held with Jewish groups, with a scientist in the
Massachusetts lab, with the neo-Nazi who interested
Leuchter in the journey to Poland--Morris concentrates almost
exclusively on Leuchter himself.  This guy, deluded as he is,
"wearing blinders" as others described him, and easily
influenced by heinous anti-Semites, is strangely difficult to
dislike.  Though somewhat mousy behind his thick glasses
and small stature, Leuchter--who admits to drinking 40 cups
of coffee going through six packs of cigarettes  a day--is
difficult to detest.  He is articulate through his pronounced
New England accent but never resorts to throat-clearers like
"you know," "like," "uh," and other disturbing mannerisms that
could make the typical audience for a documentary bolt for
the doors.  He seems to prove something we liberal arts
students back in college always said about the engineering
students: that while they actually build things, we could think. 
Leuchter, for all his training, comes across lacking in
Education with a capital E.  In a sense he is like the Nazis
themselves--highly efficient in what they did but absolutely,
disastrously psychotically wrongheaded in their mission.  Just
as Hitler destroyed his own country while trying to bring it to
his perverted idea of greatness, so Leuchter destroyed his
career and even his social life.  Now bereft of jobs, family
and friends, he seems to have difficulty even selling the lethal
injection machine he designed and half completed when the
state canceled his contract and threw the gadget at him to
keep.  This powerful and perversely humorous film, however,
has the opposite consequence for Errol Morris, who comes
out as one of the country's premier documentarians with yet
another compelling film on his resume.

Errol Morris, critically acclaimed director of the 1997 documentary
FAST, CHEAP AND OUT OF CONTROL, vaults to new heights with MR. DEATH.
This film, an examination of the life and work of controversial
execution equipment designer and revisionist historian Fred A. Leuchter,
Jr., is sure to draw audiences out of their malaise, stunning even the
more jaded minds among us.
Don't let the film's cheesy dissuade you.  Following this sideshow of
horror-lab special effects we are plunged quickly into a non-stop
exploration of the weirdness that is Leuchter's life and mind.  Morris
follows the trail of Leuchter's madness with appalling lucidity,
revealing in a surprising and frightening way what most of us could have
guessed to begin with: This Leuchter guy is seriously messed up.
Virtually raised within the American penal system by a father who worked
within prison walls, Leuchter seems to have come somewhat naturally into
his profession; designing and maintaining execution equipment for state
penitentiaries, in spite of his lack of credentials.  After a moderately
successful career making electric chairs and designing gas chambers and
gallows, Leuchter came to the attention of neo-Nazi and revisionist
historian Ernst Zundel, who was facing criminal charges in Germany for
publishing his `theory' that the holocaust never happened.
Morris's interviews are surprisingly congenial, drawing the subjects
into a carefree banter that gives them more than enough rope with which
to hang themselves.  Zundel speaks to the camera as though it were his
mensch.  Leuchter seems completely at ease, sometimes jovial.  Part of
this effect may be due to Morris's new interviewing machine, called the
Interrotron, which is responsible for creating eye contact between the
subject and the interviewer.  This was the first time Morris had used
the device, and the results are startling.
Combine the irony of these interviews with Leuchter's reenactments and
reels of creepy stock footage of his trip to Auschwitz and Birkenau, not
to mention a haunting clip of Thomas Edison electrocuting an elephant,
and you've got one compelling and disturbing documentary.  While this
film isn't for the feeble-minded or weak-hearted, it is a valuable
addition to the cultural landscape.  Aside from a few dragging minutes
toward the end of the piece, Morris has given us a fresh look at a
dismal subject and I, for one, feel bettered by the experience.

When examining controversial subjects, discussions often diverge into
the emotional dimensions of the topics involved. This makes it
difficult to present a story based around a charged issue, because
there is the temptation to delve into the more sensational aspects.
With this film, veteran documentary filmmaker Errol Morris examines an
individual connected with two grave subjects, capital punishment and
the Holocaust.
The film begins by showing the main character, Fred Leuchter, sitting
inside a metal cage that is rising towards a Van De Graaff generator.
The artificial lightning repeatedly strikes strikes the cage,
symbolizing the controversy surrounding Leuchter. Then the narrative
slowly explores Leuchter's background, mostly in first person. He
immediately strikes the viewer as an odd character, with his mousy
appearance and whiny voice with a thick Boston accent. Morris' films
usually focus on individuals with odd or amusing interests and
passions, and this film is no different.
Leuchter has been associated with death and execution all his life.
His father worked at a prison, and growing up in that environment gave
Fred and interest in capital punishment. He taught himself the repair
and design of electric chairs. Eventually his interest branched out
into other forms of execution equipment, and he grew from a
self-taught technician to an engineer with a successful business. Few
people work in his field, so Leuchter established himself and designed
electric chairs, gas chambers, and gallows for the penal system for
several states.
Through this point in the story, Leuchter is an interesting character,
but hardly a controversial one. In fact, he even appears
compassionate. He is driven by the desire to make execution efficient
and humane. His primary concern is for the safety and dignity of both
the the executioner and the condemned. Although the tone of the
subject is morbid, there are numerous instances of odd humor based on
the quirkiness of Leuchter's character, like his claim to drink 40
cups of coffee a day.
The film then proceeds to examine the source of Leuchter's infamy--his
role supporting Holocaust denial. There are few topics as charged as
the mass slaughter of Jews that took place in Nazi Germany during the
middle of the Twentieth Century. It is a tragedy of such immense scope
that today it symbolically represents the lowest depths of evil to
which modern man can sink. However, there still remain a small
minority of Nazi sympathizers who dispute that the Holocaust actually
happened. Their claims of distorted pro-semitic propaganda are not
usually taken seriously, and the historical fact of its occurance is
not an open topic for objective analysis. When one particular
Holocaust denier seeks to scientifically examine whether the Holocaust
actually occurred, he is unable to find anyone who is willing to even
consider the question, except Fred Leuchter.
Unlike most people involved in this inquiry, Leuchter has no political
agenda. He is willing to keep an open mind and use forensic evidence
to determine whether six million individuals could have been killed by
the Nazi regime. Leuchter feels that as an expert on execution
methodology, he can determine whether the facilities proportedly used
for the mass killings were actually used. Leuchter travels to the
remains of a death camp and surreptitiously takes samples of the site.
He meticulously documents his research, including ample videotaping of
his activities. The viewer sees the diminutive, unassertive man
crawling through all parts of the historical site with a hammer and
chisel, chipping off pieces of the buildings so he can have them
tested for cyanide residue.
After he returns home, he has the samples analyzed and finds that
there is no basis, according to his knowledge of execution procedures,
to say that mass killings could have taken place. He publishes a paper
detailing this finding, and the infamous "Leuchter Report" completely
alters his life. It is obvious to the viewer that Leuchter has made a
Faustian bargain. He overestimated his knowledge of the scientific
basis of his testing. He took on an important study as an expert in
the field that boosted his ego, but it makes him more enemies than
friends. Eventually, Leuchter is shown in his present situation where
his wife has left him, he has become unemployable, and his only
admirers are people that no one takes seriously. He is merely a pawn
in a larger political game, but it is a role he entered voluntarily,
without assessing the consequences.
Unlike the majority of Holocaust deniers, Leuchter come across as
pitiable rather than evil. Most are anti-semitic radicals who believe
the Holocaust was an exaggeration, and are looking for proof to
support that belief. Leuchter, on the other hand, approaches the topic
from a completely objective perspective. He makes no assumptions, and
uses his expert knowledge to extract scientific evidence that either
support or contradict historical Holocaust claims. Ultimately the film
paints him as a pathetic victim of his own ego. Although he is an
expert on constructing execution machines, he is not qualified to be
an investigator of historical events. Interviews with other experts
reveal the fatal flaws with Leuchter's approach and methods. Being in
the middle of such heated controversy, most observers are split into
two groups, the fringe radicals who support him and believe his
conclusions, and the majority who denounce him as a tool for hatred.
Morris' film carefully avoids judgments and allows the viewers to see
the man clearly and allows the alternate assessment, that he is simply
a naive, pitiful fool who allowed his ego to drag him into his own
ruin.
The style of the film is different than what is typically seen in
documentaries in that actual footage is mixed with dramatizations.
These dramatizations are done for viseral effect. For example, there
is plenty of footage of Leuchter rummaging through the ruins of
Auchwitz, but there is also footage of Leuchter re-enacting those
actions in a studio, as an eerily backlit silhouette. By using
contrived scenes such as these, Morris is not augmenting the factual
basis of the narrative, but he is accentuating the imagery in order to
build mood. It is a bold style for a documentarian, and a technique
that Morris has perfected.
Highly recommended. The film deals with difficult and sensitive
subject matter, and although it is mostly free of disturbing imagery,
the topics discussed may be disturbing to sensitive viewers. That same
dimension makes it a powerful and thought provoking exploration of an
individual. Director Errol Morris skillfully navigates the narrative
through many charged subjects, but consistently keeps the focus on the
examination of the central character. He is brought to life and
objectively displayed for the audience to dissect and examine for
themselves.
