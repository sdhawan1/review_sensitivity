This is the story of the British attempt to conquer Tibet in order to
invade China, and although they had superior technology and treachery on
their side, how they were defeated by the honest, simple Tibetans.
Although on the surface it has its heart in the right place, the film
feels like Chinese propaganda in defense of their occupation of Tibet
and is so relentlessly corny and unconvincing that the last half was
pure torture.  All the voices are badly dubbed (in Mandarin and
English), lending even more of a feeling of falseness to the film.  The
only pluses are some impressive scenery and Ning Jing as the chieftain's
daughter (a self-proclaimed goddess), who is beautiful, capricious and
beguiling.
Evaluation:  Run Away or show it at an MST3K party.
