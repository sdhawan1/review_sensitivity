Which Way to the Front? (1970) ** out of ***** - Cast: Jerry Lewis, John
Wood, George Takei. Written by: Dick Miller. Directed by: Jerry Lewis.
Running time: 96 minutes.
Very "hit and miss" comedy from Lewis, as with most of his films. This time
Jerry plays the richest man in the world, and one day decides to try and
enlist in the army to help fight in World War II. He is denied. Not
accepting that, he and a small group of others who also were denied entrance
into the army create their own army to fight the Nazis. From that point on
the plot is absolutely all over the place, from training the men to trying
to assassinate Hitler.
The film does have some laughs, mainly whenever Jerry breaks into his
trademark "Lewis-speak" language of babble and doubletalk. Other moments
seem uncomfortable. For example, is Hitler really a great comedic character?
I didn't think so. The opening credits (which don't begin until at least 20
minutes into the film) begin with "Jerry Lewis as Which Way to the Front?".
Jerry Lewis "as"? Hmmmm, at this point I don't know if Jerry meant that as a
joke or not.
Lewis didn't act in another film which was actually released until 1981's
"Hardly Working". [PG]
