Paul Verhoeven, the Dutch auteur who dragged his violent, sexually aggressive 
aesthetic into American film, has never been what I'd consider a thoughtful 
director (though some of his films, notably STARSHIP TROOPERS, have been 
lauded as artistic achievements), but he is the kind of Hollywood film maker 
who's managed to, no matter what the budget, make his films distinctive and 
even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on 
which he toils. STARSHIP TROOPERS was essentially a B-monster movie remake of 
his enthralling Dutch War film SOLDIER OF ORANGE (a great film that's nearly 
impossible to find on video, yet SHOWGIRLS is everywhere), in which he cast a 
troop of stunningly attractive mannequins; the square jawed Casper Van Dien 
and Denise Richards (who may actually be 45% silicone), in what feels like an 
American propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage. It's 
not a completely successful film, but as a 
failure it's certainly an interesting (and mostly entertaining) one.
My favorite Verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores; 
SPETTERS, a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the 
sub-culture of drag racing and the aforementioned SOLDIER OF ORANGE (haven't 
yet gotten around to seeing THE 4th MAN or TURKISH DELIGHT). I believe his 
best Hollywood film to be ROBOCOP, a bleak super-hero satire with a robotic 
hero that's as touching as Schwarzenegger's in T2. That movie was violent but 
not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent Verhoeven pics. Its 
violence seemed to be there for a purpose, namely to create an atmosphere of 
unpredictable dread, not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience. 
There's a jaw-dropping scene within the first ten minutes of ROBOCOP wherein 
the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him. He tortures the officer 
by taking glee in his victim's every fearful tic. It's a startling moment of 
barbaric, maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that 
could be designated as splatter punk-noir.
In HOLLOW MAN Kevin Bacon brutally slays a dog because it just won't shut up, 
he impales a co-worker, drowns another and so on. But why? His character is 
introduced as a smug genius, the kind who's always impeccably dressed and 
races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the 
world to hear, sort of like a scheming uber villain from DALLAS or MELROSE 
PLACE, though once the character becomes invisible, this film has him pull a 
180 shift into a psychotic movie monster. The kind who just won't die. HOLLOW 
MAN's protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist Linda 
(Elizabeth Shue, acting as if she were Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm) and her 
lover, a hunk of beef scientist played by Josh Brolin who's saddled with the 
film's worst lines ("I've lost cohesion again!"). They're a typical Aaron 
Spelling couple, good-looking but as vacant as George W. Bush's Republican 
National Convention speech (i.e. Bush referring to Clinton; "…so much 
promise…but to what end? To what end?"-- this actually got applause! Suddenly 
Warren Beatty doesn't look so absurd). The rest of the film's characters are 
all well past thirty, though act like annoying high school party animals 
insulting one and other with a series of strained one-liners; Is it just me 
or have labored insults become Big Budget Hollywood's new character 
developing technique? Ahh, what a cynical time we live in…
As the picture opens we meet Cain (Kevin Bacon), an egocentric scientist 
working with the crew of 
aforementioned irritating scientists on a Top Secret (so Top Secret the 
government has only provided them with a dilapidated warehouse in which to 
perform their extensive experimentation's) project with the goal to make 
invisibility a possibility (for what purpose is never hinted at). They've 
performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary 
causing Caine, in a twist worthy of the film's 1950's Late Show origins, to 
impulsively experiment on himself. Caine neglects to let the Pentagon in on 
his plans and somehow gets two of his co-workers to lie for him so the rest 
of the crew will think the Pentagon gave the go ahead. Our mad scientist is 
turned invisible (after several FX-heavy complications), then he inexplicably 
(it's hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more 
savage creatures, but this is never explored, and if that was the case why 
the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on a human?) begins 
raping, assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases, always with a lame 
wisecrack ready a la Freddy Krueger.
It grows abundantly clear with each new release that it's Verhoeven's films 
that have become hollow. Like the rest, this one is cold, heartless, and full 
of contempt for humanity, but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of 
wit, insight and makes no statement other than "audiences will pay for 
anything these days". It's an affront to anyone looking for something 
stimulating on an intellectual level, or even those hoping to spend a 
Saturday night with a fun, thrill-a-minute ride. Verhoeven has instead served 
up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason 
to care.
The previews make HOLLOW MAN look like an irresistible flick. How can one not 
have a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art FX to illustrate an 
invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self? A couple weeks ago, 
after seeing the trailer, a bunch of friends and I got into a long discussion 
of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible 
individual indulging in their newfound ability. HOLLOW MAN looked like the 
first film to do so and whoa, in a serious manner to boot. But oh yeah, it is 
directed by Paul Verhoven not Atom Egoyan or Peter Greenway. Verhoeven 
delivers the sleazy "goods", but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing 
manner, here it just feels icky and uncomfortable. The director keeps his 
camera trained at his nubile actresses, caressing their breasts with his lens 
all while faux-PSYCHO music strains in the background. It's plainly obvious 
that Verhoeven isn't exploring voyeurism (like in the classic PEEPING TOM) 
but exploiting it and not even doing that very well. It's funny that with all 
the technology $90 million can get you Verhoven is stuck at trying to figure 
out how to show a woman's naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand.
Most vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet 
another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain 
can pop up for more attacks. In fact it's largely irrelevant that Bacon is 
invisible since, by the end, most of his potential victims don infer-red 
glasses that track his body heat. As in every Mad Slasher film we get the 
killers POV (a scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses 
triggered unpleasant memories of SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE), and lots of scenes 
where people are unknowingly stalked.
The film only provides one moment that I found genuinely creepy. It happens 
when a lab assistant (Kim Dickens, who looks like she stepped out of Playboy) 
in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible Bacon, suddenly pauses. "Are 
you looking at me?", she queries, obviously haunted. It's a little moment in 
a big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effects set to a 
plot that should have run its course by 1982 (the apex of the Mad Slasher 
craze). Those special effects are so stunning they alone keep this from being 
as bad as URBAN LEGEND or I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. And they're 
the only reason to check out HOLLOW MAN, preferably as a mid-week bargain 
rental. You've been warned. But you probably won't listen, will you? Tis' a 
pity…

 Hollow Man (2000) 1/2 star out of 4. Starring Kevin Bacon, Elisabeth
Shue, Josh Brolin, Kim Dickens, Greg Grunberg, Joey Slotnick,  Mary
Randle and William Devane. Screenplay by Andrew W. Marlowe. Story by
Gary Scott Thompson and Andrew W. Marlowe. Music by Jerry Goldsmith.
Directed by Paul Verhoeven. Rated R.
 "Hollow Man" is as empty as its name implies.
 This cynical updating of "The Invisible Man" is turgid and
preposterous.
 From the outset, director Paul Verhoeven sets a nasty tone by showing
the  gruesome demise of a lab rat.
 Things merely go downhill from that memorable moment.
 Kevin Bacon stars as hot-shot young scientist Sebastian Caine who has
been working on a top-secret Pentagon-funded project to turn people
invisible.
 So far, his experiments have worked on animals, but now comes the time
to test it on humans.
So Caine, who is an obnoxious, self-centered and selfish genius,
nominates himself as the test subject.
 And, being the brilliant scientist he is, the first thing he does when
he fades out is to go around scaring women and making sexual advances.
 In other words, director Verhoeven merely is content to tap into the
adolescent fantasies experienced by every 16-year-old who pondered the
advantages of invisibility.
 It's sick, disgusting and shameless, but what else can you expect from
the man who brought the world Showgirls.
 At the outset, it is obvious that Bacon is a few cards short of a full
deck, so why do his colleagues, whom seem to have more sense, allow him
to inject himself? Simple, to move the plot - if you want to label it as
such - along.
 Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin play Bacon's main assistants. She, of
course, is his former lover, giving him another reason to go bonkers
when he discovers that she is now carrying on with Brolin.
 You think of any mad scientist-invisible man cliché, and Verhoeven is
shameless enough to exploit it.
 The movie is not helped by an overwrought and bombastic cacophony of
music, cobbled together by Jerry Goldsmith, who has done much better
work in his career.
 "Hollow Man's" only positive is its eye-popping special effects, which
are stunning in their anatomical grossness.
 Unlike the Universal "Invisible Man" films of the 1930s and '40s,
people just don't fade away to nothing in Verhoeven's world. They
disappear bit by bit, and every vein, artery and organ is put on
display.
 "Hollow Man" is a travesty, a sick and twisted vehicle unworthy of the
talents of such fine performers as Bacon and Shue.
 Bacon has a lot of fun hamming it up (sorry, I couldn't resist), which
is probably the only reason he took on the role.
 Otherwise, this is one science fiction movie that could go straight to
"Mystery Science Theatre 3000," if it was still airing.

Directed by: Paul Verhoeven
Written by: Gary Scott Thompson, Andrew W. Malowe
Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) is a brilliant research scientist working on a 
project for the military. He and his six person team are searching for the 
secret to invisibility. The team consists of his ex-lover, Dr. Linda Foster 
(Elizabeth Shue), her current lover, Dr. Matt Kensington (Josh Brolin), a 
veterinarian (Kim Dickens), a computer expert (Joey Slotnick), and two 
assistants (Mary Jo Randle, Greg Grunberg). While causing test animals to 
attain invisibility hasn't proven difficult, bringing them back to normal 
has. after almost two weeks of tirelessly searching for a "cure", Sebastian 
finds it and decides it is time to move on to the next phase of the project 
- human experimentation. Offering himself up as a guinea pig, Sebastian 
undergoes the procedure and finds the experience exhilarating. The only 
problem is, the cure that worked for the animals doesn't work for humans. 
While the team works tirelessly to return Sebastian to normal, Sebastian 
slowly loses his sanity as the power invisibility grants him becomes more 
and more enticing.
For those of you out there who don't know this, Plato once wrote a theory on 
what would happen to a person who was granted invisibility. I think these 
writings were, in some small way, part of the inspiration for Gary Thompson 
and Andrew Marlowes' script. Plato theorized that a person who was invisible 
could do anything they wanted to, and therefore their morals would vanish. 
The first half of "Hollow Man" attempts to delve into this idea, and almost 
succeeds. If the film had been a character study about the effects of such a 
power on a person's morals and beliefs, it could have been quite fascinating 
(it would have needed a different director than Paul "Starship Troopers" 
Verhoeven however). Instead, the part of the film focusing on Sebastian 
losing his sanity is rushed through and Verhoeven turns the movie into a 
typical monster/slasher film. I've decided a new law should be implemented 
in Hollywood: All films will cost half what they do now, and will have a 
maximum running time of one hour. That's because it seems most Hollywood 
writers can only keep a good plot going for an hour before transforming an 
otherwise interesting film into a shapeless mass of cliches.
Kevin Bacon, while by no means a bad actor, is not someone I would call a 
great talent. He has given a few very good performances ("Stir of Echoes" 
and "Apollo 13" spring to mind), but he's given a few truly horrendous ones 
as well ("The River Wild" anyone?). His performance in "Hollow Man" falls 
squarely in the middle. While he does a decent job playing a man losing his 
sanity (I think "Stir of Echoes" gave him some practice), his scenes where 
he is given a chance to display this talent are few and far between. Much 
more often are the scenes where he gets to act like a deranged lunatic, and 
he gleefully overacts in these scenes. The biggest problem with Bacon's part 
isn't actually his fault. The problem is that Sebastian never comes off as 
particularly sane to begin with, so when he begins losing his mind we're 
really not too surprised. The majority of his supporting cast has very 
little screen time, with only Elizabeth Shue ("Palmetto") and Josh Brolin 
("Mimic") given any time to develop. Of course, the writers' idea of 
developing a character seems to be to make that character have a past love 
life or a past rivalry with another character. Shue and Brolin are required 
to give slight performances, and they do so beautifully. Watch for William 
Devane ("Payback") in a very small part as Sebastian's boss.
Let's face it, the main reason everyone's going to see this movie is because 
the trailers promised two things: some great looking special effects, and a 
few good scares. On the first count, "Hollow Man" succeeds admirably. The 
special effects are just about guaranteed a nomination at this year's 
Oscars. Everything from watching a person turn invisible one layer of skin 
at a time to seeing a person's hand being bitten into by an invisible ape is 
masterfully crafted. Unfortunately these effects are completely wasted, and 
as a result become tiresome after a short while. As for the scares, I can 
honestly say I didn't jump once, no matter how many startle effects 
Verhoeven threw at me. I think the reason none of the startle effects worked 
is because Verhoeven only used them when the audience was anticipating them. 
If he'd thrown a few at us during scenes when we weren't sitting there, 
counting down the seconds till the next time Sebastian was going to leap out 
of the shadows, they might have been fairly effective.
The most painful thing in the entire film must be the last half hour. Up 
till this point things have been bad, but I could at least tolerate it 
because I could tell a really interesting story was just aching to break 
free. In the last half hour the writers throw out everything they had done 
up till that point and turned the film into a straight out slasher movie, 
complete with a villain who simply will not die no matter what you do to him 
(in this case electrocution, fire, being beaten to a bloody pulp, etc.). We 
also get those two most irritating of all cliches, characters calling out 
someone's name even when it's obvious who is really there, and a group 
splitting up so they can be picked off one by one. The dialogue up till the 
last half hour was at least tolerable if not good, but it falls flat on its 
face and becomes downright painful during that excruciating segment of the 
film. The score composed by Jerry Goldsmith ("LA Confidential") for "Hollow 
Man" isn't quite appropriate to the film; though that's probably not his 
fault. While it should have been low and creepy, Verhoeven decides on loud 
and obnoxious instead (a disturbing trend in Hollywood these days). At one 
point Sebastian says "You don't make history by following the rules, you 
make it by seizing the moment." I wish Verhoeven and company had followed 
this advice. "Hollow Man" runs far too long at 114 minutes. I recommend it 
to fans of "special effects over story" movies and give it two and a half 
out of five stars.

Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.
     HOLLOW MAN follows in the fine tradition of James Whale's 1933
version of THE INVISIBLE MAN, in which Claude Rains loses his mind and
goes on a murderous rampage. There is, however, a more realistic element
to Paul Verhoeven's contemporary version of the tale: This invisible man
tests his power by going around feeling up women. We understand this
instinctively to be realistic because it's in the DNA of every
heterosexual adolescent male to define invisibility as the power to walk
into the girls' locker room with impunity. Hell yes we'd engage in a
little mischief if no one could see us; even the best of us might find it
hard to resist the temptation. Power corrupts, and so on and so forth.
     HOLLOW MAN could have been a provocative examination of what that
temptation would do to one of the best of us. Instead, its invisible man
is Dr. Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon), an egomaniacal jerk heading a
government research project into rendering people invisible, a process
that proves much easier than rendering them visible again. After a
breakthrough leads to the apparent discovery of a method for reversing the
process on test animals, Caine decides to test the invisibility serum on
himself, against the protests of his colleagues Linda McKay (Elisabeth
Shue) and Matthew Kensington (Josh Brolin). The invisibility serum works
on Caine, but the reversal serum is not so successful, stranding Caine in
his invisible state. And Caine begins to discover that he kinda likes the
freedom it grants him to do virtually anything.
     A bunch of techno-babble sets up the notion that the subjects of
Caine's serum are "out of phase with the visible universe" blah blah blah,
and disappear from the outside in, one layer at a time. And make no
mistake about it, it's one heck of a nifty visual trick (actually
introduced in reverse when a test ape gradually turns from skeleton into
layers of musculature). In fact, HOLLOW MAN is awash in nifty visual
tricks cleverly implemented: the thermal view of a full frontal Bacon; a
scene of Caine vomiting up invisible food in silent answer to that age-old
question; Bacon's ghostly visage appearing in water, smoke and a tossed
bag of blood. As effects-heavy thrillers go, this one at least makes every
moment of technological gee-whizzery genuinely worth a gee-whiz.
     What it lacks, in essence, is anything that can be called a story. 
There's a vacant spot in the center of the film even before Caine 
vanishes, because there's nothing remotely sympathetic about him from the
outset. While we can still see him, he's an obnoxious sort who makes
off-color jokes and mocks the vivisection of his lab animals. Once we
can't see him, he's the same guy, only now with the ability to render his
obnoxiousness more directly on others. There's no character arc to
Sebastian Caine; HOLLOW MAN merely presents the fairly self-evident answer
to the question, "What would happen if you granted omnipotence to a cruel,
self-absorbed bastard with a God complex?" The script doesn't even give a
character arc to its ostensible protagonist, Shue's Dr. McKay. Perhaps she
too could have been tempted, or learned something about scientific hubris. 
But no one learns anything in HOLLOW MAN, except to stay out of the way of
an invisible sociopath. Ultimately, it's nothing but a technically
proficient mad slasher movie.
     Make that a fairly diverting, technically proficient mad slasher
movie, at least during its high-energy third act. HOLLOW MAN is giddily
gruesome from the outset -- engineered by Verhoeven, the king of giddy
gruesomeness -- but it really goes wild once Caine traps his research team
in their underground facility. The film turns from a gloss on Cronenberg's
THE FLY to a gloss on both ALIEN and ALIENS (though I actually enjoyed the
nod to WESTWORLD, with Josh Brolin following in Papa James' footsteps in a
cat-and-mouse game involving thermal perception). The final 20 minutes
becomes a frantic and generally entertaining hack-n-slash through the
supporting cast members, leading up to an appropriately ridiculous climax. 
It's too bad Verhoeven and screenwriter Andrew W. Marlowe weren't 
interested in putting some meat on HOLLOW MAN's bones. Even with all its
visceral appeal, it could have been so much more interesting to watch the
story of the guy who wants to walk into the girls' locker room with
impunity, instead of the guy who wants to walk into the girls' locker room
and blow it up.

DIRECTED BY: Martin Scorsese
WRITTEN BY: Andrew W. Marlowe, vaguelly based upon a novel by H.G. Wells
CAST: Elisabeth Shue, Kevin Bacon, Josh Brolin, Kim Dickens, Greg Grunberg
MPAA: Rated R for strong violence, language and some sexuality/nudity.
Runtime: USA:112
This is an adaptation of H. G. Wells' acclaimed novel 'The Invisible
Man' . The actors are Kevin Beacon and Elizabeth Shue. The director is
Paul Verhoven. That, plus a quick demonstration of the amazing special
effects in the trailer, should be enough to lure us into the
theatre. The problem is to keep us there. I can't imagine anyone who
would like to see this movie a second time.
Working on a top secret military project, Sebastian Caine (Kevin
Beacon) -- an eccentric genius, that calls himself "God", has
discovered the secret to invisibility. The first two faces are
completed. Now, it is time for "the next logical step" -- human. Caine
volunteers for this risky experiment. But when he is made invisible,
something goes wrong. While his ex-girlfriend Linda (Elisabeth Shue)
desperately tries to find something to return him to normal, he learns
that invisibility is more of a prison than a superpower. But that's
not the bad thing -- an unexpected side-effect of the drug sends him
careening into paranoid megalomania. He is naturally given a couple of
modest superpowers, just enough for him to survive immolation from a
flame thrower and an explosion of about a quart of
nitroglycerine. Soon every sense of decency is forgotten. The little
intelligence that was left disappears as Verhoven looses control and
the film turns into an Alien-rip-off, where Caine is walking like a
half finished Terminator, spooking, scaring and killing everybody.
Though it's based on a novel called 'The Invisible Man', the title has
been ironically changed to 'Hollow Man' that sums up the film very
nicely. This is a very silly production. Laughable,
actually. Apparently Verhoven's imagination doesn't stretch too
far. For him the only worthwhile reason to become invisible is so you
can case the girls' locker room undetected. It is this primitive
schoolboy mentality that eventually kills the movie. Being invisible,
gives you the opportunity to be who you are, to do what you want
without being influenced by society. In many ways it gives you an
illusion of having a life without consequences. The nature of man and
his place in society is what the novel is truly about. All that, the
depth and true horror of the book is gone and only special effects
make you remain in your seat. Caine does use his power voyeuristically
in Hollow Man. But since this is a modernization, in other words a
dehumanization, he doesn't stop there. He becomes a rapist. And then,
of course, a murderer.
You'll start wondering why such actors as Beacon and Shue found
themselves in such film in the first place. Shue's talent is barely
seen, Josh Brolin is underused and the rest of the cast suffer mostly
for the lack of talent. Kevin Beacon is the only one that performs
gracefully. His face is not seen for the most part of the film, and
the only way he exists is as a disembodied voice. There are times when
his presence actually saves the film from being completely
embarrassing.
In the end the effects are the only reason to see this film in the
first place. Being probably the best technical achievement since
"Jurassic Park", they are absolutely amazing. We observe the layers of
skin, muscle, tissue, and bone being peeled away as a body is slowly
rendered invisible. We see a beating heart, inflating lungs, and veins
pulsing with newly-pumped blood. There are a couple of inventive shots
with smoke, fire, air and water, but are a few scenes like that worth
attending a movie for? What is truly disturbing is that with a great
book, talented actors and a grand budget, this could have been so much
more. Pretty much like Jan De Bont ("Twister", "Haunting"), Paul
Verhoven has never made anything extraordinary. He was responsible for
several good films ("Basic Instinct" and "Starship Troopers)" and some
incredibly bad films ("Showgirls", "Total Recall"), but he has never
made anything that was great. In a way "Hollow Man" fits perfectly in
this collection. It's not better or worse than Verhoven's average
film. He proves once again that he is incapable of handling more
complex issues. And so, instead of depth and chills, Verhoven inserts
some of his trademarks: stupid dialogue, and lot's of dull action with
blood and naked bodies. He even throws in some of the worst of film
clichés - the slowly advancing fireball, the villain who comes
back from the dead, etc, etc. - and tops the whole thing off with
one of the most ridiculous endings of the year (you'll be screaming
"NOOOOO!" and attempt to run towards the exit in slow motion). And all
we can ask is why? The answer is simple. Though Hollywood is a movie
producing machine, the business of moviemaking has to be about
something more than money. It has to be about telling stories, not
marketing them. It has to be about transporting us to a different
place, to dazzle us with magic and cleverness. To make us care, to
make us think and feel. Verhoven has obviously missed that point and
this film is a proof of that. It's all flesh and bones, but no soul.
a void where its imagination should be.

Don't you hate it when a movie has a great premise and looks like it could be 
something fresh and exciting it turns out to be just another [insert genre 
here] flick? 
That's what happens with "Hollow Man" - it's a story that involves the 
discovery of a chemical that turns living things invisible. This would 
seemingly be a good method to explore human psychology, especially of 
voyeurism and insecurity. It might also be a study of the basic human fear of 
that which we can't see scares us. But what do we actually get with this 
movie - a terribly generic sci-fi/horror thriller about a man who who's just 
a big baby and has to have his way all the time. 
Kevin Bacon stars as Dr. Sebastian Caine - a scientist working on the 
invisibility project for the pentagon in a secret underground lab. He is 
surrounded of course by his ex-girlfriend Linda McKay (Elizabeth Shue) who 
has dumped him for fellow scientist Matt Kensington (Josh Brolin). Caine 
never gets his way and when he does turn himself invisible he does explore, 
uh, his "inner perversions." But for some reason he goes nuts and starts 
killing everybody. 
What makes the film so flawed is not just the fact Caine snaps for no 
justifiable reason, it's that there's no backstory to the any of 
the characters so no one in the film has any real motivation. This is 
compounded by a screenplay which does nothing to further the story for the 
majority of the movie (it's mostly the scientists sitting around in the lab). 
The topper is the ending which is so over-the-top with one classic slasher 
horror cliche after another it's laughable. It's a movie about an invisible 
man and what do we end up with - fistfights and shootouts and explosions and 
elevators crashing?!?! If we wanted to see that we would have rented a "Die 
Hard" video. 
I think Paul Verhoeven just likes to use special effects at the expense of a 
workable screenplay.

     If Hollywood's makers of summer films can be said to show any
creativity and imagination--admittedly a difficult point of view to
defend--it is in how they manage to takes such a variety of film
premises and turn them into standard borrowed endings.  It is truly
remarkable how many different films build to cliches like the
sympathetic underdogs winning the big game.  The other standard
ending, which if you think about it is only a variation on the first
one, is the sympathetic heroes in a confined space facing and
defeating something that wants to kill, perhaps already has, but
cannot itself be killed.  We saw it in IT! THE TERROR FROM BEYOND
SPACE, ALIEN, ALIENS, HALLOWEEN, and who knows how many more films.
Of the eight films playing currently at my local multiplex three
have unkillable killer endings.  One of them is HOLLOW MAN which
begins as a revisiting of concepts from H. G. Wells's THE INVISIBLE
MAN but in the end is just two people being chased by a perfectly
visible monster and killing him several times only to have him keep
on coming.  The once-respectable Paul Verhoeven should have rejected
the script as inferior, but instead let it be just another step in
his decline.  Besides its striking lack of originality HOLLOW MAN
wastes some of the most interesting convention of the Invisible Man.
     Most invisible man films are all based on H. G. Wells's novel
THE INVISIBLE MAN.  That novel is itself a reframing of the story of
Gyges, which today we remember best through its reference in Plato's
REPUBLIC.  Gyges, a shepherd who comes into possession of a ring of
invisibility, uses it unscrupulously to make himself king.  In the
dialog of THE REPUBLIC Glaucon suggests that god-like power, like
that of Gyges, of necessity corrupts.  These stories look at the
power an invisible man has and frequently examine whether that power
really does necessarily corrupt the person who has that power.  One
important aspect is that he can be virtually anywhere unseen, using
his power in clever ways.  But since this film places the invisible
man in an inescapable deep lab complex (with the exception of one
short sequence) most of the imaginative power of the concept is
thrown away.  There is just too much haste to get to the secure
territory of cliches and ultra-familiar plotting.
     Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) heads up a super secret
government project.  With his ingenious process he already can make
animals invisible.  Ironically his most difficult problem is making
them visible again.  (Perhaps this is also an idea borrowed from
Wells.  As the novel begins Griffin has already made himself
invisible and struggles to find the way back to visibility.  The old
Universal Invisible Man series stretches this quest over multiple
films.)  For Sebastian's discoveries he expects to win a Nobel
Prize.  (Why does every cinematic mad scientist who can grow a
three-foot-long blood-sucking garden slug think that is what they
give Nobel prizes for?)  The military is ready to cut his funding
for lack of usable results so Sebastian decides to experiment on
himself.  He already is a bit of a jerk, will the power that
invisibility gives him exaggerate his character flaws into madness?
Was this plot built from a kit or what?
     This is a film that could have risen to the level of mediocre,
but blows it in the cliched final reel.  Sure, there is a tradition
in films that the hero and the villain survive hazards and
situations that really should have killed them.  The final sequences
of this film go beyond any reasonable suspension of disbelief.  The
writers confuse the concepts of "invisible" and "invincible."
Sebastian goes through a gauntlet that should have reduced him to
the consistency of tapioca pudding, made even worse by him running
around without the protection of clothing, but he keeps on fighting.
The heroes themselves survive treatment only a little gentler.
     The script by Andrew W. Marlowe seems oblivious to the most
basic technical issues about invisibility.  H. G. Wells gave more
thought to the technical questions of invisibility than went into
this film.  This film uses Star-Trek-style double-talk physics to
explain the invisibility in the first place, something like a
"quantum phase shift," but then apparently is going to use chemical
and biological means to bring the guy back.  At one point Sebastian
eats a Twinkie and it is immediately invisible.  Wells knew better.
Sebastian is totally invisible and yet his eyes are apparently still
focusing.  Again Wells knew better.  Even the opportunities for
prurient voyeurism, while absent from Wells, have been handled
considerably better elsewhere.  Jerry Goldsmith probably saw little
effort on the part of the filmmakers to exercise much imagination
and followed suit with what is one of his least memorable scores.
     Not to be totally negative and to give the film its due, the
special effects are uniformly dazzling.  The original series used a
few simple effects that were not entirely convincing.  Most notably
I believe they filmed in a black room an actor with clothing over a
black velvet suit that totally covered him.  Only the clothing shows
and it gives them an image they could lay on top of another shot.
The computer has changed a very great deal.  The visuals here are
flawless and delightful.  Also as is ironically if frequently the
case, even a very bad horror film can have a very good first scene.
(MARS ATTACKS is a prime example.  Most of what is good in that film
is in the pre-credit sequence.) The horror potential of concept of
an invisible predator has never been captured on film so well as in
the first scene of HOLLOW MAN.  That makes it all the more
disappointing how the filmmakers so badly blew the rest of the film.
     For the same budget this film could have brought the invisible
man film into the modern age.  Instead if will hopefully quickly
sink from sight.  I rate this a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a -1 on
the -4 to +4 scale.

In the opening moments of "Hollow Man," a rat scurries across the floor,
then hesitates as it hears ominous growling sounds. Suddenly, the
twitching rodent is hoisted into the air by an unseen force and we watch
as something takes a huge chunk out of the hovering animal's body. The
scene is lurid, technically stunning and quite viscous, perfectly
setting the tone for what is to follow.
"Hollow Man," a thriller about an invisible maniac, is a fascinating
piece of work despite its flat, obvious script; thanks to top-notch
special effects and the skewed perspective of director Paul Verhoeven,
the Dutch filmmaker who brought the world "Robocop," "Total Recall,"
"Basic Instinct," "Showgirls" and "Starship Troopers." Verhoeven is to
directing what Spinal Tap is to rock and roll, enthusiastically turning
the control knob up to 11 while assaulting viewers with heavy-handed
bursts of sex and violence. As with most Verhoeven films, "Hollow Man"
is simultaneously campy and creepy. This is a guilty pleasure with the
accent on guilty. After the closing credits, I felt an intense need to
wash my hands.
Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a cocky, but brilliant scientist
trying to perfect an invisibility formula for his backers at the
Pentagon. SPOILER ALERT: THE FOLLOWING REVEALS BASIC PLOT POINTS. After
a successful experiment with a gorilla, Caine decides to skip protocol
and try the process on a human being, using himself as the guinea pig.
Without the knowledge of government liaison Dr. Arthur Kramer (William
Devane), Caine convinces his teammates  ex-girlfriend Linda McCay
(Elisabeth Shue), stud muffin Matt Kensington (Josh Brolin) and
casualties-waiting-to-happen Sarah Kennedy (Kim Dickens), Carter Abbey
(Greg Grunberg), Frank Chase (Joey Slotnick) and Janice Walton (Mary
Randle)  to strap him to the table and inject the serum into his veins.
Within seconds, Caine is writhing in agony as he slowly begins to
disappear, a layer at a time, in a spectacular visual sequence. His skin
fades first, followed by muscles, internal organs and finally his
skeleton. After recovering from the trauma, Caine joins his comrades in
celebrating their success, but their giddiness turns to dread when
attempts to return him to visibility utterly fail.
While his fellow scientists struggle to find a restoration formula,
Caine's behavior takes a drastic downward turn. He begins indulging his
secret urges; copping a feel from a sleeping female teammate and spying
on Linda in the sack. When he makes a trip to the apartment of a
voluptuous neighbor, things take a violent, deeply disturbing turn.
Whether the serum or his own megalomaniacal tendencies trigger the
change is uncertain, but his crew must face the fact that their leader
has gone crazy, and their lives may be forfeit if they can't find a way
to stop him. END SPOILER ALERT.
Story-wise, "Hollow Man" is just a formula horror flick. In fact, Andrew
Marlowe's screenplay fumbles obvious opportunities by mostly confining
Caine to the group compound instead of unleashing him on the public.
Character development is sketchy at best; the supporting players are
one-note and Caine merely slides from being a relatively sophisticated
creep to becoming a much more dangerous one.
While the press notes for the film feature impressive quotes about the
corrupting nature of power, the movie never addresses them. Make no
mistake, "Hollow Man" is simply an exercise in special effects and
grisly cheap thrills. But the special effects are knockouts and it's
fascinating to watch Paul Verhoeven (to paraphrase Monty Burns from "The
Simpsons") wallow in his own directorial crapulence.
Verhoeven grew up in occupied Holland during World War II and witnessed
the ravages of war from a child's point of view. During a recent
interview, he acknowledged (almost grudgingly) that there is goodness in
the human spirit, but made it clear that his interest lies in the dark
side of souls.
Boy howdy! Verhoeven movies are veritable orgies of violence and sex,
with glossy settings and superhuman characters that treat the death of
loved ones lightly (when a scientist's body falls out of a locker, her
friends shriek in surprise, but display no sadness whatsoever) and
handle grave wounds with remarkable ease (one character sticks her
fingers deeply into the stomach wound of a colleague, announces "It
didn't cut any organs," and patches him up with duct tape (!!); then the
pair continue their very strenuous adventures).
It would be easy to mock or dismiss Verhoeven for the cheesy overkill.
In fact, I've done so before, particularly with "Showgirls" and
"Starship Troopers." But this time, I kept thinking of that little boy
in Holland, forced by German troops to look at piles of dead bodies on
the streets. All grown up, he copes with the memories by creating
violent films where sexy, extraordinarily powerful humans fight operatic
battles against the forces of evil. My interpretation could be wrong, of
course, but it sure makes comic book gore-porn like "Hollow Man" a lot
more interesting.
As reporters gathered in Los Angeles to interview the cast and crew of
the invisible man thriller, "Hollow Man," the topic repeatedly drifted
from the spectacular special effects in the movie to the mindset and
behavior of its director, Paul Verhoeven. The 62-year-old Dutch
filmmaker, best known to American audiences for "Robocop," "Total
Recall," "Basic Instinct," "Showgirls" and "Starship Troopers," is
dismissed by detractors as a temperamental auteur preoccupied with
juvenile displays of lurid sex and graphic violence.
But Verhoeven enjoys a fiercely devoted fan base as well and has
received many positive notices from critics, although some are
admittedly of the backhanded quality. For example, Andrew O'Hehir of
Salon Magazine recently comparing the director favorably to Alfred
Hitchcock, stating "Like Hitchcock, Verhoeven is an ice-veined European
expatriate whose sleek filmmaking style cannot conceal the fact that
he's not in control of his own obsessions. For both directors, male
sexual anxiety is at the center of their aesthetic universe, and both
have been accused of hating women."
"Hollow Man" star Elisabeth Shue went into the film aware of Verhoeven's
reputation, but left the set impressed. "I had a great experience with
him," she told me. "He was very supportive of me. He's very demanding
and I think some people misinterpret that side of him. But for me, he
was demanding in a way that made me feel challenged to do really good
work. He's very passionate and I respect that he cares a lot about the
films he's done. I would much rather deal with somebody who was mad
about their film than somebody who could care less."
Kevin Bacon, the Hollow Man himself, said of Verhoeven, "He has a
mercurial kind of personality, he explodes at any minute. He's
incredibly passionate. He has a tremendous kind of single-mindedness
when it comes to the execution of this movie, to getting the job done.
Being a director is a consumptive kind of job ands it requires an
amazing amount of focus, which he has. But the people who work with him
work with him a lot. The crew, for instance, has done picture after
picture with him. He is devoted to them and they are just as devoted to
him. Throughout the process, we eventually were able to establish the
relationship I like to have with a director, where they respect my
opinion about things, about character. I loved working with him."
When Paul Verhoeven finally entered the room for his interview, the
energy was palpable. With scraggy white hair and a pleasantly weathered
face, he speaks in a thick accent; cordial, but commanding. Verhoeven is
quite comfortable holding court, with his booming voice punching every
sentence.
The first thing we had to do was clear up an earlier conversation. While
promoting "Starship Troopers" with phone interviews three years ago,
Verhoeven had insisted to me that the wildly over-the-top feature was
absolutely not a satire. It was simply a war movie set in outer space.
The only satire was in the film's news broadcasts and propaganda ads, he
told me at the time. Now, he wanted to amend his remarks.
"I think there was a misunderstanding," he said. "What I meant was that
during the war scenes I am not commenting on it in any, let's say,
ironic or satirical way. I'm just basically showing them as they are;
they are shot like real war scenes. It's just because of the context,
and the juxtaposition with other stuff, and the structure of the movie,
that you start to feel the idea was to put you into the war in a
realistic way and then be subversive, to show to you that you were,
basically, an idiot and a fool to cooperate. That was the idea. I pull
you in and then ask yourself 'Am I an idiot? What is this society and
why did I participate in this? Why did I go along with these people?'"
Fair enough. But why do his films always seem to end up dealing with man
at his most grim, with death and destruction everywhere? He answered
fast, obviously having dealt with this question many times before. "Am I
fascinated with showing the dark side? I would say so. In American
culture, there is always a tendency to look on the positive side, which
is great, but I'm not sure that's the full truth. I think there are a
lot of things hidden under the surface in this country, in any country,
and sometimes it breaks to the surface. The shadow is there. We all have
to deal with the shadow in everybody. How strong and how dominant that
will be, probably that's a character thing or an environmental thing.
But I've always been interested in that aspect of humanity because you
see it displayed in the universe or on Earth in such a brutal way.
Especially in the century we just left  I think 70 million people got
killed, you know? More than anything you could ever imagine."
Verhoeven spent several minutes rambling on about the brutality of
nature, often referring to an article he had read about two galaxies
colliding with each other, and the indescribable destruction that must
result from such an occurrence. He seemed simultaneously horrified and
thrilled while describing the cataclysm. Eventually, his fever pitch
softened and he dropped from the nether reaches of space to his own
childhood. There was no hint of self-pity as he spoke. He simply got a
little quieter.
"I grew up in occupied Holland," he said, "and I saw there were a lot
of people got killed by bombing, or resisters that were shot on the
streets by Germans. I was about seven when the war stopped. When I was
five, six, seven, we lived in the Hague and were constantly bombed
there, not by the Germans, but by the English. Our house was about a
mile from the rocket launching pads, where they launched the B-1's and
B-2's to England, and the English and Americans were constantly bombing
that area. The area around us, with the exception of the street we lived
on and a couple of others, were completely destroyed. I remember the
flames and the people being killed. And the Germans  one evening I
remember walking with my father and suddenly we were held by Germans and
they said 'You cannot walk there, you have to walk here and look at
something.' And we walked there and saw 20 people they had taken out of
prison and shot. They put them against the wall and shot them and made
sure that everyone going home passed them. Dead bodies there, yeah, I
remember all that. So you may be more optimistic than I am."
Ladies and gentlemen, meet Paul Verhoeven.

Rated: R for graphic violence and gore, language, nudity and some sexual 
content.
Starring: Elizabeth Shue, Kevin Bacon, Josh Brolin, Kim Dickens, Greg 
Grunberg, Mary Jo Randle, William DeVane.
Horror films are always a favorite of mine. I will admit I've never really 
seen an invisible man thriller, except the tepid spoof "Memoirs of an 
Invisible Man" which Chevy Chase, which really wasn't all that good. Anyway 
when I heard of Hollow Man, I thought wow hopefully this will be a genuinely 
scary movie, with a great cast, great writing, and some great scares. So I 
went into the movie expecting all these things, and surprisingly the movie 
lived well up to my expectations even though I sometimes had doubts about it. 
"Hollow Man" is a very scary, gory, well-acted, even erotic horror story.
The story is about Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) who is the head of a secret 
lab, where they try to make animals invisible, and it works. Sebastian is 
however tired of testing on animals, and without permission from the 
pentigon, to which is funding all this, he decides to have his crew made up 
of Linda Foster (Elizabeth Shue), his ex flame, Matt Kensington (Josh Brolin) 
her boyfriend, and the rest of the scientists, Frank, Sarah, Carter and 
Janice. They inject him with the fluid that makes him invisible, but after 
being invisible for a while, Sebastian starts to go a little crazy, and goes 
out and does some bad stuff.
Linda now threatens to tell the pentagon about what has happened, which 
really makes Sebastian mad, and he goes a little crazy ending up in a 
exciting, very intense climax that left me more than satisfying. One warning 
about watching this film is that the gore in this movie is over-the-top in a 
good way. There is a copius amount of gore in the film, along with some very 
graphic violence, one shocking scene of violence almost made me sick, however 
do not let the violence get in the way of you seeing this movie. It really is 
surprisingly a good horror movie, with a great cast and great special effects.
For the cast, Kevin Bacon heads the cast as Sebastian Caine, and does a very 
good job in the lead role. He is very scary as a villian, and around 1/4 of 
the film it is only his voice. Sometimes however it is what you can't see 
that scares you the most, and "Hollow Man" is no exception. There are some 
genuinely scary moments in the film, and I was surprised at how much I was 
really absorbed into the film. Elizabeth Shue plays Linda Carter, and as 
always clocks in another great performence. She brings out her character very 
well, and adds yet another good performance to her record. To round off the 
cast Josh Brolin does a great performance as well, but seems a bit held back 
in his role. The supporting roles by Kim Dickens, Greg Grunberg, Mary Jo 
Randle, and Joey Slotnik, adds some depth to the movie and completes the cast 
very nicely.
The special effects are jaw-droppingly good. Sometimes I was so intruiged by 
the film that I lost interest in thinking they were special effects, and 
thought they were real, which at times scared me. The one complaint I may 
have had about the movie is that fact that the violence might turn off alot 
of viewers, which sadly might kill some of the box office. Hopefully all you 
reading this who don't like violence will still give the film a chance and 
have fun with it. Paul Verhoeven's direction is nice as well and the pricey 
$85m dollar budget really shines in the end. One more complaint is that they 
bill William DeVane as a major character, when he is in only two small 
scenes, but oh well you take what you can.
In the end however "Hollow Man" delivers the goods: it's extremely intense, 
smart and sometimes clever thriller, that tends to dive towards the slasher 
genre, but quickly goes back to its horror routes. The dialogue is a bit 
cliched, and over-ridden, but everything else in the film is top-notch. It's 
one hell of a summer ride!

     Paul Verhoeven's latest homage to Big Acting and overdirection is
light on the naked chicks and heavy on the violence, because, as it
turns out, being invisible makes you insane and clearly Mad With Power. 
And the chicks just get in the way of that.
     I guess I'm getting ahead of myself.  The Invisible Man gets a
millennial upgrade to Hollow Man, when a team of government-contracted
scientists led by Kevin Bacon's Sebastian Cole figures out how to "phase
shift" (ahem) a person to become completely invisible.  As we are told
during one briefing, the phase shifting is the easy part (of course). 
It's undoing the process and making someone visible again that's tricky.
     When Cole successfully un-phase shifts a gorilla, he figures, what
the hay, he'll try it on himself.  All goes well until, oopsy, the
un-shifting doesn't work on humans!  As Cole simmers as an invisible man
trying to figure out how to revisible-ize, stuck at the lab -- located,
quite naturally, in a pit dug hundreds of feet into the earth and with
only one exit -- he starts to go crazy.
     To be honest, even the most bored observer will see that Cole was
crazy to begin with, and it comes as no surprise when he starts offing
his staff, who are threatening to tattle about the illegal/unethical
human trial to their Pentagon benefactors.  Most notable among them is
Linda (Elisabeth Shue), an ex-girlfriend who's now having a fling with
another researcher named Matt (Josh Brolin)....  Two guys out of four on
staff?  Linda must be the trampiest medical professional on film to
date.
     For good and for bad, Verhoeven avoids the ambition of grandiose
movies like Starship Troopers, and Hollow Man ends up taking place
mostly in the budget-friendly underground cave -- just like any number
of "trapped on a ship" sea monster movies, only with no water and an
invisible monster.
     To say that Kevin Bacon is a ham in this film would be insulting to
pigs.  (Insert your own "bacon" joke here.)  While Shue makes a more
credible scientist here than she did in The Saint, it's still a stretch
to see her in a role that isn't either a prostitute or a babysitter.
     But ultimately, Hollow Man is simply a paean to some dazzling
special effects, the sophistication of which I don't think I've ever
seen -- mind-bending in their complexity, blood curdling in their
goriness, and almost unthinkable in their realism.  There's
water-covered invisible man, burning invisible man, and blood-spattered
invisible man.  The capper of course is the phase shift process, one of
the more gruesome events ever put to film, and not merely because of the
prominence of Bacon's skin-stripped male member.  Of course, never mind
the ersatz scientific holes (mainly, if you un-phase shift from the
inside-out, why do you phase shift from the outside-in? -- the serum
still starts in your veins and works through the body that way).
     Whatever.  Hollow Man is disturbing enough to be fun, and utterly
dumb enough to not get in the way of the former.  Just like that other
Verhoeven classic.  You know:  Showgirls.

Directed by Paul Verhoeven. Screenplay by Andrew W Marlowe from a story by
Gary Scott Thompson and Marlowe. Starring Kevin Bacon, Elisabeth Shue,
Josh Brolin. Running time: 112 minutes. Rated R for extreme violence and
offensive language throughout by the MFCB. Reviewed on August 7th, 2000.
What would you do if you could turn invisible? The possibilities are
virtually limitless. There are the cheap, visceral thrills, such as 
sneaking into changing rooms and dormitories. There are more noble
pursuits, like acting as a genuine force for good in your community.
Perhaps you could offer your services to the government as a crack
espionage agent. Well, if the makers of "Hollow Man" are to believed,
you'd probably take a page from any generic slasher movie of the past
twenty-five years and start hunting down your friends in gory, if not
particularly imaginative, ways. Uh huh.
Inspired by, though not really similar to, HG Wells' novel "The Invisible
Man", "Hollow Man" is about a team of scientists trying to create an
invisibility formula (here it's described as "going out of quantum synch"
with the universe, but of course that's just the technobabble 
explanation). The project head is Dr Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon), an
arrogant genius with more than a slight streak of megalomania. His
assistants include ex-girlfriend Linda (Elisabeth Shue) and Matt (Josh 
Brolin), who are sleeping together behind Sebastian's back.
In fact, the team has already figured out how to make people become
invisible -- the problem lies in trying to reverse the effects. In a flash
of inspiration one night, Sebastian thinks he figures it out, and indeed
their test gorilla Isabelle is successfully made visible again. Without
informing his superiors, Sebastian decides to proceed to the next stage of
the experiment and test both serums on a human subject: himself. But
although he becomes invisible without undue difficulty, the antidote
proves to be useless on humans, and Sebastian is trapped in his
phantomlike state. Soon, the tantalising possibilities invisibility offers
become too much for Sebastian, and he begins to succumb to his base
desires.
"Hollow Man" falls short in all moviemaking fundamentals: plot,
characterisation, atmosphere. Even Paul Verhoeven's directorial flair, 
striking in "Total Recall" ten years ago, is absent here, as the director
continues the downward spiral most recently evident in the tedious
"Starship Troopers". I find it appalling that a movie can take such a
great, multifaceted concept -- invisibility -- and hogtie itself to a
standard old slasher storyline. And "Hollow Man" isn't even a particularly
good slasher film, because we're not so much as afforded an interesting
death sequence. Sebastian's murderous rampage, when it finally comes, is
without tension, excitement, or invention. It's just an invisible guy
killing people, as if that single gimmick would somehow enliven the entire
film. There's no effort to create any suspense, or to really shock the
viewer; it just feels like the filmmakers are going through the motions,
and rather feebly at that.
Personally, I'm more interested in special effects where I can see
something, rather than those where I can't. Sure, a good job is done to
achieve the appearance (as it were) of invisibility, and I'm sure it took
a lot of hard work, but the gosh-wow factor is exhausted pretty quickly.
The same goes for the scenes where Sebastian suddenly becomes
semi-visible, when he is immersed in water or smoke or whatever. The first
such sequence is appealing; the concept gets tired soon thereafter. 
Indeed, the only effects which really left an impression on me were the
scenes where the invisibility formula and its antidote are employed --
first on a gorilla, then on Sebastian. Instead of taking effect all at
once, the serums work layer by layer, giving us a view of the inner
workings of the bodies like an anatomy textbook brought to life.
Beyond this, there is little to recommend "Hollow Man". Kevin Bacon does a
reasonable job in a role in which his voicework is paramount. But 
Sebastian Caine is a desperately uninteresting character. We are robbed of
the chance to investigate whether or not it is invisibility which has
affected his mind, because he's clearly on the edge even before the
experiment. A far more interesting approach to have taken would have
been to give us a less unscrupulous character and really delve into the
temptations he experiences. Sebastian is already such a bastard that his
swift decision to abandon his already loose morals comes as little
surprise. I realise that "Hollow Man" is, first and foremost, a thriller,
and I am not suggesting that it should have been bogged down in ethical
posturing. But I think a more clever movie could have balanced its
protagonist's inner turmoil with the requisite action scenes.
To make matters worse, the screenplay by Andrew W Marlowe (from a story
co-conceived with Gary Scott Thompson) doesn't even come up with
interesting things for the invisible Sebastian to do. Indeed, of all the
scenes involving Sebastian's abuse of his power, the only one that's at
all intriguing is the very first one, where he molests a co-worker (Kim
Dickens), with her being only barely aware of it. There is a definite
eroticism to this scene, not the least because of the conflict previously
established between the two characters. But it's all downhill from there
-- we subsequently get another excuse for partial nudity, and then it's
slasher time. That such a fantastic premise is so thoroughly wasted is the
surest sign of the sheer creative bankruptcy of the movie.
Amongst the supporting cast, Shue and Brolin try gamely to play the
heroes, but neither of their characters have much personality to speak of.
The film's engagement in a bit of role reversal, casting Shue as the more
proactive of the pair, is but a minor triumph. Most of the other
characters are simply there to act as cannon fodder, although Dickens and
Joey Slotnick make the most of their small roles. No fair guessing who
survives and who doesn't, though. In order to surprised on that point,
there would have to be some imagination behind the movie. On the set of
"Hollow Man",  it seems that bodies weren't the only things made to
vanish.

In an age when computers and visual effects are cinematically at the top of 
their games, it's curious that a film hasn't been made sooner about a 
psychotic invisible man. Sure, there was 1992's big-budget fiasco, "Memoirs 
of an Invisible Man," starring Chevy Chase, but that was a black comedy, 
rather than a thriller that truly delves into the mind of a slightly unhinged 
human subject who has decided to become invisible. The possibilities for what 
could be done with this idea are seemingly endless, and "Hollow Man," 
directed by hit-or-miss director Paul Verhoeven (1992's "Basic Instinct," 
1997's "Starship Troopers"), has taken advantage of this novel approach, 
offering up the type of state-of-the-art special effects that have never been 
seen on the big screen before. While problematic in more ways than one, the 
picture also holds the distinction of actually working as a spooky horror 
picture, albeit one that is particularly more gruesome and violent than most.
Slick hotshot Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) is a self-titled genius, the head 
of an exclusive research team being financed by the Pentagon who has 
discovered the DNA formula with the ability to render animals invisible. 
Following experimentations that claim bringing the animals back to visibility 
are successful and relatively harmless, it is time for a human to become the 
next test subject, and Sebastian is determined to be that man.
Without authorization from the Pentagon and aided by fellow researchers Linda 
McKay (Elisabeth Shue), Sebastian's ex-lover; Linda's current flame, Matthew 
Kensington (Josh Brolin); veterinarian and animal specialist Sarah Kennedy 
(Kim Dickens); and assistants Carter Abbey (Greg Grunberg), Frank Chase (Joey 
Slotnick), and Janice Walton (Mary Randle), Sebastian injects himself with 
the invisibility serum, and although a rocky journey, the next quantum step 
works, leaving him exactly like the animals they had previously tested. 
When bringing Sebastian back proves to be more difficult than all involved 
had expected, leaving him temporarily trapped in a world where no one can see 
him, he gradually begins to grow stir-crazy stuck in the underground lab, and 
begins to realize that he now has the ability to do anything, criminal or 
not, and could get away with it. Not helping matters is the discovery that 
Linda, whom he hasn't gotten over yet, is romantically involved with Matthew.
For the opening hour, "Hollow Man" is almost exclusively a psychological 
drama, and it isn't until Sebastian finally snaps that the proceedings turn 
ghastly. Whereas the biggest chunk of the film deals with the provocative 
question, "What would you do if no one could see you?," and gains notable 
mileage out of such a thought-provoking notion, the movie finally switches 
gears and, by the final thirty minutes, has become a gory slasher movie, 
where the central figures are knocked off one at a time until only two 
characters remain to fight for their lives against the killer.
The sudden switch in genres and tones is cause for both disappointment and 
celebration. On one hand, by the time the climax has arrived, director 
Verhoeven and screenwriter Andrew W. Marlowe have abandoned the innovative 
psychological subject matter that had been brought up, instead aiming for 
shocks, scares, and bloody death scenes. Verhoeven and Marlowe both could 
have undoubtedly thought of a more intellectually sound way to conclude the 
story, something that would have followed through more closely to what had 
come before, but scientific accuracy apparently was not on their agenda. 
Relatedly, when the murders arrive, the basic story is more or less forgotten 
about, in place of an "Alien/Friday the 13th" clone.
Despite what it may sound like, becoming a basic slasher film isn't 
necessarily a negative thing, however. The final thirty minutes are easily 
the most entertaining and tautly paced, and manage to even be a little 
frightening, a trait that is rare these days. The ingenious twist on the 
stalk-and-slash motions it goes through is that the menace can only be seen 
while wearing special goggles, or when something touches him, like water or 
steam. One particular sequence, set inside an elevator shaft, is especially 
nerve-wracking, and stands as proof that Verhoeven is a true filmmaking 
craftsman. 
The visual effects in "Hollow Man," by Sony Pictures Imageworks Inc., are the 
true stars of the show, as they are rarely ever anything less than awesomely 
convincing. The process in which someone or something becomes invisible is 
superbly realized, as the skin is first stripped away, followed by the vital 
organs, and then the skeletal system. The computer-generated effects, which 
are another step forward in motion picture technology, makes everything that 
is happening believable, and therefore, more threatening.
Elisabeth Shue, who hasn't found much success following her Oscar-winning 
role in 1995's "Leaving Las Vegas," is effective and strong-willed as the 
heroine, a sort of Sigourney Weaver for the '00s. If any human actor steals 
the film away from the effects, it is Shue. Kevin Bacon, as Sebastian, is 
also very good, and easily has the most difficult role, as he must show 
emotions from only the sound of his voice (he is invisible for 3/4 of the 
movie). It is also nice to see the talented Josh Brolin (1998's "Nightwatch") 
here, as he is an almost constantly underrated thesp who deserves more 
recognition, and will hopefully get it with such a showy studio film here. 
Outstanding in a supporting part is Kim Dickens (1998's "Zero Effect"), who, 
with every appearance, is able to form a three-dimensional character, even 
when it isn't on the written page. Dickens is one of the most promising young 
actresses working today, and like Brolin, merits further exposure.
On the whole, "Hollow Man" stands as a tricky balancing act between deeper, 
existential ideas and a cliched monster movie. While Verhoeven's last film, 
"Starship Troopers" was merely dumb and overly campy, his "Hollow Man" plays 
things fairly straight, and it is a stronger film because of this. Because 
the characters are deadly serious throughout the horrific goings-on, the 
viewer grows all the more involved. "Hollow Man" could have possibly 
graduated to being a great, subtle thriller, but that isn't the movie 
Verhoeven made. Instead, what we have is a bloody, gripping, gruesome, 
big-budget, popcorn-munching horror movie--and it works. Scientific logic, be 
damned!

HOLLOW MAN (director: Paul Verhoeven; screenwriters: based on a story by
Gary Scott Thompson and Mr. Marlowe/Andrew W. Marlowe wrote the script;
cinematographer: Jost Vacano; editor: Mark Goldblatt; cast: Elisabeth
Shue (Linda McKay), Kevin Bacon (Sebastian Caine), Josh Brolin (Matthew
Kensington), Kim Dickens (Sarah Kennedy), Greg Grunberg (Carter Abbey),
Joey Slotnick (Frank Chase), Mary Randle (Janice Walton), William Devane
(Dr. Kramer); Runtime: 112; Columbia Pictures; 2000)
The hollow man is a deranged, egotistical genius scientist, Dr.
Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon), in this witty sci-fi film that compares
favorably with Jimmy Whale's 1933 classic "The Invisible Man" for its
inventive use of ideas, until the film falls into a pyrotechnical
ending, forgoing ideas in favor of becoming a slasher movie about a
scientist going amok and smashing all his creations, his jealous mind
becoming crazed, as he attacks his research team, feeling that they
betrayed him and their work because they were worried solely about their
careers. But until then, it just seemed like a very entertaining pop
culture film, whose satire comes about in comic-strip form, as it tweaks
the side of sensibility in favor of perversity. But then again, it is
quite possible that the film is so polemic and so full of contempt for
society, that its theme revolves around the scientists surviving in a
wasteland anyway they can (maybe a referral to T.S. Eliot's poetical
work"The Hollow Man"). For Verhoeven, it is imperative that one must do
whatever it takes to get by in such a cold and unromantic world. If that
is the case and I suspect it is, then this film becomes a more sublime
work than I thought at first, chewing off more than what can be seen.
Its ideas do not completely vanish in flames by the film's end but just
smolder, even though the film never veers from being nihilistic.
The Dutch-born Paul Verhoeven (Starship Troopers/Total
Recall/Showgirls/Basic Instinct), a director I never thought much of
before as being subtle, thoroughly hating his fascistic parody, Starship
Troopers, and being only mildly accepting of his other sleazy films,
directed this thriller with an eye to his staple signature as an auteur
-- of misanthropy and lurid erotic behavior combined with mindbending
special-effects.
Inside the top-secret lab site in Washington, D.C., we see a rat in a
steel cage being devoured by an invisible creature as it goes for some
water while monitored by computers amid a dazzling display of high-tech
machines, in a dark and claustrophobic setting. The invisible creature
that gobbled it up and swallowed it, turns out to be a gorilla named
Isabelle the Pentagon-financed  research team uses as their subject for
a project on invisibilty.
Sebastian is the brains and team leader of this research team, one in
which he hand-picked. We first see him at home by his computer trying to
work out a configuration problem he was stuck on for the last eleven
months. Meeting with failure on the computer imaging, he looks out at
the apartment window across from his to peep at a beautiful woman
undress down to her bra and panties before she shuts the blinds. These
two failures in one evening bring the genius around to eating a Twinkie,
remembering that Da Vinci tried to never sleep, as he wanted his mind to
always remain active. With that in mind, he suddenly comes up with a
solution to the Isabelle invisible puzzle, and he calls his attractive
ex-girlfriend Linda (Shue) with the good news. She's in bed with her new
boyfriend, Matthew (Brolin), whom he doesn't know about. These two are
the star players on his team, though neither one has the magical genius
quality that Sebastian has, but they are nicer human beings than the one
whose hubris is so out of whack that he considers himself to be God. The
lab technicians on the team are Carter (Grunberg), Janice (Randle), and
Frank (Slotnick), each deferring to their project boss in a different
way, with Carter the less openly hostile to the boss than the other two,
even admiring him for driving a silver Porsche convertible and acting
just as hip as a rock star. The veterinarian of the group is the feisty
Sarah (Dickens), who is more concerned with the well-being of the
animals in these experiments than she is with the scientific
conclusions.
The team preps the gorilla for phase two of their research and finds
that they can make the gorilla invisible. The special effects are truly
stunning, as we watch the gorilla become invisible, as her body when it
changes looks like one of those see-through bodies in an anatomy
textbook. We next see Sebastian, Linda, and Matthew meeting with their
project director Dr. Kramer (Devane) and the Pentagon generals to report
their findings. But Sebastian throws the other two scientists a monkey
wrench, as he fails to tell the committee the positive results of the
experiment. Outside the meeting he explains to the other two, that if he
told Kramer what they discovered the experiment would be taken over by
the Pentagon and he wouldn't be running the show anymore.
He tells them that they'll move on to phase three on their own, that
he'll be the subject of the experiment, injecting himself with the aqua
blue serum that will make him invisible. But once injected with the
formula, a snag develops when Sebastian can't return from being
invisible. The research team is more petrified that their careers will
be ruined by this illegal research than if Sebastian will be OK, while
Sebastian seems to become more of an asshole than before and does the
adolescent thing an invisible male might do, he enters his neighbor's
apartment to stare at her naked breasts and then sexually attacks her,
he also spies on Linda in bed with Matthew and goes ape over what he
sees.
For the last 30 minutes or so of the film, the depraved Sebastian traps
his research team in their underground facility, and the film goes giddy
with gore and becomes a bloody slasher film of the research team getting
knocked off one by one, until it is Linda and Matthew as the only one's
left to send the evil scientist, who thinks he's God, to hell.
I might not have had much use for the creepy Sebastian, but I understood
his human defects: his selfish motivations and his sexual curiosity, as
annoying as those faults may be, at least it is something that was
explored by the director in his invisible man theme, something other
filmmakers of invisible men films haven't done, giving fire to the role
Kevin Bacon so ably played. I also found Elisabeth Shue to be alluring,
offering beauty and vulnerability, a sense of feminine instinctiveness,
intelligence and of endeavor, in a film that caught an hypnotic sense of
cynicism and ran with it. The remaining cast members looked as if they
would be part of a research team and filled the film with the proper
atmosphere needed. This is not a slasher film per se but it could be, it
had all the gore required for a movie appealing to teens looking for a
film with a quick mindless thrill. I found it to be most like a pop
culture treat ala Hollywood, adding its own brand of vitriolic delights
to the sci-fi/horror genre, which has spawned many films with much the
same tendencies, such as "Aliens " and "The Fly (86)," but none with the
same erotic tendencies and magnificent special effects. This one's a
visual delight, much more intense and sleazier than the other recent
similar films of this type, but one that can only push the pop culture
button so far, because what does it all mean seems to be lost in the
hollowness of the story itself.

   One of my earliest memories was of my asking my mother
a philosophic question at the age of three.  "Mommy," I said,
mouth open with awe, "Does God see me now?"  "Of course
He does," my mother said, which led to my follow up, "Does
He watch me when I'm sleeping?"  "He does that too," was
the answer, predictably enough, though I don't think I'd have
made a fascinating subject doing that.  Finally, with a tremor
in my voice, "Mommy, does God see me when I'm in the
bathroom?"  "He can do that too," was the reply I fully
expected, at which point I vowed that I'd always be a good
boy, because who knows what could happen when I even
entertained an evil thought?
   Look at this from an inverted viewpoint.  What would you
be like if you had this Divine power to see others at any
time that you wished, and others would not be able to see
you in return?  Would you be a cherubic person, wishing
everyone the best, helping out when you could do so without
being observed?  Could be.  But recall the famous saying of
Lord Acton: Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts
absolutely.  So, then.  If you had this absolute power, what
would you really do?  In his envelope-pushing movie, Paul
Verhoeven, veteran of such classic entertainments as
"Showgirls," goes with the views of writers Gary Scott
Thompson and Andrew W. Marlowe ("Air Force One"), and
decides that a person with the power of invisibility would be
corrupt.  He would do evil.  He would be the Devil.  
   Here, then, is a powerful theme to explore.  If you expect
Verhoeven to knock out an intellectual exercise on the nature
of absolute power, you'd be sadly mistaken, and if you try to
judge "Hollow Man" by literary standards, you'd be looking at
the movie the wrong way.  Forget literary standards.  Leave
that arena to the book critics.  Remember that movies,
particularly commercial movies, emphasize movement, action,
dream-like states, and assess this tale by cinematic
standards.  Why?  Because so far as the story line goes, the
sci-fi/horror yarn is by the numbers.  You know who's going
to die and who will live to tell the tale.  You know that the
villain is going to make the usual mistake in the end of talking
too much instead of killing quickly.  Though Plato talked
about the nature of morality (do we abstain from evil
because of our conscience, or because we don't want to go
to jail) and Christopher Marlowe in 1616 asked the Devil to
"so charme me here/That I may walke invisible to all,/doe
what ere I please, unseen by any,") you won't find gems of
literary wit in the movie itself.
   However!  For special effects Verhoeven trots out some
stuff that allegedly was not do-able as recently as last year,
and would have been considered way beyond the powers of
filmmakers the likes of horrormeister James Whale, whose
1933 "The Invisible Man" was then considered about as far
as movie makers would ever go.  (That classic, which made
Claude Rains a household name, was of a mad scientist who
makes himself invisible and wreaks havoc on the natives of
his British country village.)  "Hollow Man" is more like
Lambert Hilyer's 1936 film "The Invisible Ray," showing
scientist Boris Karloff contracting radiation that slowly
deteriorates his mind, except that in this case, power, not
radiation, plays dangerous tricks on the subject's reason.
   The story line is simple enough.  Laboratory scientists
Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon), Matt Kensington (Josh
Brolin), Sarah (Kim Dickens), Carter Abby (Greg Grunberg),
Janice (Mary Jo Randle) and Linda Foster (Elizabeth Shue)
are working on a Pentagon-funded project to create
invisibility--a technique that would have obvious benefits for
American defense.  Having successfully knocked out human
visibility on a gorilla and restored the beast to perceptible
form, Sebastian and his ex-sweetheart Linda decide to
override protocol and experiment with a human being--without
the permission of Pentagon bigwig Dr. Arthur Kramer (William
Devane).  
   When project boss Sebastian volunteers as guinea
pig, he injects himself with an irradiated serum that
triumphantly turns him invisible, but alas, the scientists are
unable to bring him back.  He can be seen only when he
sheathes himself with a special gel or when immersed in
water or blanketed with steam or through special tinted
glasses that the research team members possess.  Guess
what?  Sebastian doesn't care.  Fortified with some of the
power of God Himself to wander about unnoticed, he can be
voyeur, he can mess with people, he can even injure and kill
them with impunity.  Lord Acton was right.  Add to the mix
that Sebastian is already enraged that his former girl friend,
Linda is now romantically tied to fellow scientist Matt
Kensington and you have a Devil's broth to stir up for the
remainder of the picture's 110 minutes.  As Sebastian drives
away from the lab to ponder the evil ways he will use the
power, he begins by scaring a couple of kids in an adjoining
car.  They look at his gel-sheathed face and see a
hollowed-out area where the eyes should be.  They scream
for their mommy.  And this is just the beginning of
Sebastian's descent into madness.
   The most electrifying special effect is the animation given
to what is known in encyclopedias and on some computer
software as The Illustrated Man, a glossy and impressive
display of our internal matter, from top to bottom: bones,
veins, arteries, organs.  Leonardo da Vinci had to cut down
hanged criminals and dissect them in his lab to find out what
went on internally.  Centuries passed by before William
Harvey told us how blood circulates.  But now, photographer
Jost Vacano plays doctor by seemingly taking his camera
close up to the tortured body of Sebastian Caine, writhing in
pain as he slowly deconstructs.  The skin gives way to this
internal view as we look at what our biology teacher told us is
just a couple of bucks worth of chemicals.  We see well
beyond what an MRI can show the most experienced
radiologist, and what's more the movement of these body
parts is made even scarier by Jerry Goldsmith's loud and
pulsating original score of tension-building discordant music.
   "Stir of Echoes" veteran Kevin Bacon plays the flip side of 
his role in the David Koepp production just months
ago, in which he was a man who, under hypnosis, could see
what others could not.  He makes as fine a villain here as he
made a good-guy father in Jay Russell's sentimental "My Dog
Skip," but because the script is not this movie's high point, he
cannot bring out much three-dimensionality from Elizabeth
Shue as Nicolas Cage did in the wonderful "Leaving Las
Vegas."  Since Sebastian is a heroic scientist at the start of
the movie, volunteering to risk his life by being the first
guinea pig for the experiment, Verhoeven wants us to ponder
to what degree we continue to root for him even as he
plummets into the madness of absolute power.  "Hollow Man"
shines cinematically with blockbusting effects.  But
considering the philosophers and writers quoted in the
production notes--Christopher Marlowe and Plato, and I
suppose we could throw in Dostoevski and Shakespeare and
just about anyone who pondered the role of conscience and
morality--much more could have been made of the narrative.
Rated R.  Running Time: 110 minutes.  (C) 2000

HOLLOW MAN isn't your father's INVISIBLE MAN.  From audacious director 
Paul Verhoeven (STARSHIP TROOPERS, BASIC INSTINCT and SHOWGIRLS), HOLLOW 
MAN is erotic, fascinating, imaginative, gory and, yes, a bit scary.  
Starring Kevin Bacon as a bold bastard of a scientist named Sebastian 
Caine, the movie also stars Elisabeth Shue as Linda Foster, Sebastian's 
coworker and ex-flame, and Josh Brolin as Matt Kensington, their 
coworker and Linda's current squeeze.  Sebastian still pines for Linda 
and doesn't initially know about her relationship with Matt.  The 
sexually charged script by Andrew W. Marlowe (AIR FORCE ONE) uses this 
romantic triangle as a key subplot.
Deep underground in a top-secret military lab, Sebastian leads a team of 
crack scientists who have learned how to make animals invisible and 
bring them back to visibility, with the latter transformation being the 
hardest.  Sebastian decides that, like Jonas Salk, he will himself be 
the first human guinea pig for his drug.
The movie's special effects are amazing.  Graphic and gory, they show 
animals and a human going in and out of visibility.  Basically the 
process starts with the skin disappearing.  The reversal begins with the 
veins appearing.  Medical schools would pay big money for this.  Try as 
you may, you will not be able to look away, just like you have to see 
car accidents even if you know you should cast your eyes away.
The script is as humorous as it is inventive.  Sebastian, for example, 
tells a great ribald joke involving Superman and Wonder Woman.  Women, 
however, may have trouble sleeping or being alone after seeing the film.  
The movie plays up to men's secret voyeuristic desires -- Want to see 
that gorgeous woman next door?  Just slip in unannounced and unseen. -- 
so men may find the film more exciting than troubling.  
Bacon is creepy and cocky.  He plays the type of character you love to 
hate.  "You don't make history by following the rules", Sebastian, who 
likes to refer to himself as God, tells Linda.  "You make it by seizing 
the moment."
Shue is almost as sexy as she was in her Oscar-nominated part in LEAVING 
LAS VEGAS, and she even shows that she can be a credible action hero in 
the Sigourney Weaver mold.  She is clearly an actress who should be cast 
more often.
The film's opening sequence of an innocent mouse being eaten alive by an 
invisible predator serves notice of what is coming up.  If you were 
expecting some innocuous and cute invisible man movie, you are warned 
that this isn't it and that you should quickly head for the exit.
For those who stay the movie is great fun.  The film even thumbs its 
nose at the MPAA rating board.  Knowing that the MPAA will allow frontal 
nudity in an R film so long as it's not male nudity, the director shows 
Bacon's penis flapping as he walks.  But it is done with a thermal image 
so that it can  be argued that it wasn't really shown at all.  
"What would you do if you knew you couldn't be seen?" Sebastian asks.  
An intriguing question which HOLLOW MAN explores in some obvious but 
thought-provoking ways.  As though he has a devil and an angel on his 
shoulders, Sebastian argues with himself.  "Don't even think about it," 
he says about something that he knows he shouldn't do.  But then he 
adds, "Who's going to know?" 
Only in the end, when the film dissolves into a cross between ALIENS and 
a typical slasher flick, does it ever let us down some.  But in the 
film's defense, it never takes itself too seriously, so that even the 
concluding segment is enjoyable.  The real difference is that the ending 
doesn't have quite the freshness of the rest of the picture.  
HOLLOW MAN runs 1:45.  It is rated R for strong violence, gore, 
language, nudity and sexuality and would be acceptable for older 
teenagers.

        What would you do if no one could see you?  Well, if you're a super
smart bio-molecular research scientist working for the military, you'd
grope a co-worker and rough-up your neighbor from across the street.
        That's right.  Of all the non-criminal possibilities brought about
by rendering oneself invisible, in "Hollow Man" Kevin Bacon's character
opts to commit sex crimes.  Er, it's Kevin Bacon who plays the super smart
military bio-molecular research scientist?  Something sounds horribly wrong
already.  But this is a Paul Verhoeven film, and the sleazepin director of
such open-crotch classics as "Basic Instinct" and the infamous "Showgirls"
never lets a little credibility get in the way of his voyeuristic
tendencies which, when you come right down to it, is all this film is about.
        "Hollow Man" features a string of hapless, C-list actors (among
them Bacon, Elisabeth Shue, Josh Brolin, and Kim Dickens) in a grade-Z plot
with a lot of special effects that, frankly, don't look much better than
those used in the 1933 version of "The Invisible Man."  Oh Bacon glistens
when he gets wet all right and looks like a rather fatty side of cheap
flank steak when he's attempting reentry but otherwise it's lots of
"thermal" shots and inanimate objects (Elisabeth Shue included) bobbing
around without any visible signs of support.
        Since invisibility, once achieved, isn't much of an effect (the
actors spend half their time conversing with nobody and the other half of
their time talking to each other--it amounts to much of a muchness), the
director elects to wardrobe all of his female protagonists in
loosely-buttoned sweaters so that the minute Bacon's character gets
invisible he can head straight for them.  It's as if that fascinating
concept--what would you do if no one could see you?--is simply a Verhoeven
ploy to show some skin.
        As a horror film, "Hollow Man" is unsophisticated and disturbing
(in its intent, not its achievements) and not worth your time or your
hard-earned dollars.  It's minor Verhoeven--and even that's not saying
much--and boy is it hollow.

This summer offering from director Paul Verhoeven (STARSHIP TROOPERS, 
ROBOCOP) is a science fiction thriller that blends an old story with very 
new special effects.  At its best, HOLLOW MAN highlights all of the unsavory 
implications of invisibility; at its worst, it panders to some of the baser 
requirements of modern movie-goers.
H.G. Wells' novel THE INVISIBLE MAN is invoked continuously in HOLLOW MAN.  
The story is by Gary Scott Thompson, the screenplay by Thompson and Andrew 
W. Marlowe.  But Wellsian influence is what really drives the story.  What 
happens when a scientific genius (in this update it's Sebastian Caine, 
played by Kevin Bacon) creates the means by which to make himself invisible? 
  Caine goes through the whole routine, only what he's after is cracking the 
key to becoming visible again.  When his team of brilliant assistants helps 
him bring back to visibility a large primate (gorilla), Caine volunteers 
himself as the first human to be injected with the top-secret serum that 
will make him unseen.
Thinking back to Wells' story, viewers will remember Claude Rains' character 
going crazy after becoming invisible.  Caine does the same.  In fact, the 
filmmakers add a good deal of foreshadowing to get us to believe Caine is 
capable of doing what he does in the final acts of the story.  One problem 
is that Caine is somewhat of a creep to begin with: he has been jilted by 
his right-hand colleague Linda Foster (Elisabeth Shue), and he flashes 
several signs of jealousy when he learns she has another man.  So we don't 
really feel close to Caine at any time.  Here's a paradox  viewers would be 
struck by the tragedy of the grotesque downfall of a man they admired, but 
perhaps for the purposes of modern thrillers, it is better to despise the 
fallen hero from the start.  Of course when Caine discovers the identity of 
Dr. Foster's new lover, he slides even more deeply into a dark envy followed 
by a plummet into psychotic behavior.
Here's the rub.  Watching, I was bothered not so much by my lack of empathy 
for Caine  it is easier, after all, to hate a non-human bogeyman, which the 
insane scientist clearly becomes, by turns ghost-like and grotesque.  What 
struck me was the pattern the story follows: think of any hard-to-kill 
monster from the last twenty years of cinema.  HOLLOW MAN could be traced 
even to one film, Ridley Scott's ALIEN, with Caine as the critter and Shue 
as Ripley.  I'm afraid not even the slick effects can offset the sour taste 
of derivative storyline.
One thing that could have added comic relief to HOLLOW MAN is more harmless 
pranks.  Couldn't Caine have cavorted around out in the world like Rains did 
when he terrorized the townspeople?  Here we witness simple terrorizing and 
worse.  (This does not include little touches on the hair and Caine's moving 
around Foster's can of Coca-Cola.)  The last word is that the film's outlook 
on humanity is bleak: one of the researchers announces early, assuming a 
God-like voice, that the project is doomed, the scientists cursed tampering 
with Creation.
The story does do a nice job of exposing the implications of invisibility, 
though.  The characters on Caine's team display constant paranoia and 
finally, dread.  This invisible fiend even has an advantage over a housefly, 
which cannot see the hand about to squash it.
The coolest aspect of the film is the effects, which receive at least equal 
billing with the human stars.  But here's a question posed by contemporary 
bio-ethicists everywhere: `Just because we can, does that mean we should?'  
Just because effects far-outdistance the reality of the effects of movies 
years ago, it doesn't mean the movies are any better.  Plainly, the film 
relies too heavily on computer-assisted magic.
The acting is as good as the story permits it to be.  Kevin Bacon is one of 
our finest actors, but he should probably talk with Tom Hanks about gaining 
a knack for spotting just the right script.  Bacon is capable of showing 
more humanity than he is allowed to show here.  Caine seems an egomaniacal, 
brooding jerk.  Elisabeth Shue (whose name appears first at film's start, by 
the way) is very capable here, too, though she has to repeat too many times 
that there were reasons she broke up with Caine  what they are is a 
mystery, however.
In the theater I was reminded that American viewers get what they want.  No 
lecture here, but for my tastes, HOLLOW MAN shows too much violence, and 
even exhibits partially nude women being abused by Caine.  Sure, the ending 
is pleasing if typical, but ultimately it's the kind of film that does not 
make you feel very good over spending the time to watch it.

Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) is a thrill jock genius leading a team of
scientists on a U.S. government project to create invisibility.  While
he's been successful, he's having trouble cracking 'reversion,' or the
ability to make the invisible visible again.  A middle-of-the-night idea
results in the reappearance of the team's transparent ape, but Sebastian
isn't ready to tell his bosses about his success until he's tested the
process on a human subject - himself - in director Paul Verhoeven's 
"Hollow Man."
While "Hollow Man" features some truly eye-popping special effects, its
lack of character and story development make it one of the most disappointing
of Verhoeven's ("Starship Troopers") career.  The film opens with a pow
as we see a lab rat going through its paces.  Suddenly, it's clenched by
something unseen, which proceeds to rip its head off, outlining the 
suspended jaw of a gorilla in blood.  This incident is never referred to
within the film, yet is one of the only portents that invisibility may
breed disturbing side effects.
Caine is quickly established as rather arrogant, a young Turk whose genius
causes others to give his behavior leeway.  Very efficiently, it's established 
that his right-hand staffer, Linda (Elizabeth Shue, "Leaving Las Vegas") is a 
former lover who Caine would like to have back.  She's hiding the identity
of her current lover Matt (Josh Brolin, "The Mod Squad") from Sebastian
because Matt's another high level staffer on Sebastian's team.  More 
workplace complexity is embodied in Sarah (Kim Dickens, "The Zero Effect"),
the compassionate veterinarian who clashes with Sebastian's sensibilities
(he jokes - or is he? - about vivisecting the ape which almost died from the
shock of being brought back to visibility).
Once Sebastian's invisible, the whole group becomes uneasy in their
subterranean complex.  Janice (Mary Jo Randle) keeps her thermal goggles on 
while in the ladies room.  Sarah awakens with too many of her buttons undone 
and gets tense.  When Sebastian's reversal fails (his skeletal and muscular
structures begin to rebuild, then fade back away), a fleshtone mask and
gloves are made for him to give him appearance while the group works the
problem.  This disguise also allows Caine to leave the complex, where
he's soon wrecks havoc with the power of his invisibility (although a
long-rumored rape scene is cut perfuntorily and never referred to again).  
Linda ultimately decides to come clean with their funders, but Caine turns the 
tables by murdering the project head and locking the entire team into the 
underground bunker.
Kudos to Kevin Bacon for putting up with the grueling labor required to
blank himself out for the camera - he was required to wear three different
body suits (complete with colored full eye contacts) in order to 'appear'
when hit with water/liquids, steam, smoke, etc.  However his leap from
arrogant jerk to murderous maniac doesn't allow him to do much in the way
of acting.  Shue should stay away from scientest roles as demonstrated by
"The Saint."  While she's not required to wear knee socks with a lab coat
in this film, she is required to run from mark to mark proclaiming each
subsequent victim's death before going into Sigourney-Weaver-in-"Alien"-mode.
Brolin's OK as the second banana who touches off Caine's rage while the 
remaining cast are simply dead meat.
The effects are pretty neat, but I was always aware I was watching computer
generation - the scaling back and subsequent rebuilding of the human body
from the inside out looked like 3D modelling conducted on a lab bed.  Slicker
were the partial impressions of the invisible when exposed via another
medium.  
The screenplay (Andrew W. Marlowe, "End of Days") does nothing but move
the action along with little in the way of explanation for Caine's moral
degradation other than the concept that invisible eyelids don't allow one
to catch many Z's.  A long, drawn out climax is hoary indeed.  I've seen
one too many film's end where the surviving hero(es) climb up a tall shaft
while water or fire approaches and wouldn't it be refreshing indeed for
the bad guy to stay dead the first time he's offed?
In 1933, director James Whales scared and titillated people with his adaptation
of the H.G. Wells story "The Invisible Man." That film, with the wonderful
special effects created by John Fulton and the introduction of Claude Raines to
the screen, set a level of achievement that has been often sought, but rarely
attained. Director Paul Verhoeven ("Starship Troopers") makes a valiant, but
vain, attempt to bring the classic tale into the new millennium with "Hollow
Man."
Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) is a brilliant, egotistical scientist who has
broken new ground with his research in invisibility. His experiments in making
his lab creatures invisible have been quite successful, but he has had major
problems bringing them back. The protocol he designed is too unstable to safely
bring back visibility until he has a brainstorm that may be the breakthrough he
needs. When Sebastian and his lieutenants, Linda McKay (Elizabeth Shue) and
Matt Kensington (Josh Brolin), go before a government committee, the scientist 
lies about his latest idea and asks for more time.
Sebastian, before he publicly announces his anticipated achievement, wants to
take the next crucial step in the experiment - use a human test subject. He
lies to the rest of his staff, telling them that the committee approved the 
leap to human subjects. Caine then subjects himself to the invisibility serum 
and enters a brave new world - the first invisible man. But, his brainstorm 
wasn't quite right and, when Linda and Matt attempt to bring him back to 
visibility, the return to normal fails. To complicate matters, the invisibility 
drug has side effects that make the subject uncontrollably violent. It's a race 
against time as Sebastian goes power mad and Linda, Matt and the rest of the 
staff have to stop him.
Paul Verhoeven may believe that he has created a modern version of the Whales'
classic horror/monster flick with "Hollow Man." He hasn't. What he has done is
to make a version of a cool story that capitalizes on the F/X technology of
today, but fails to capture the essence of what made the 1933 film such a
landmark event. The problem is, there isn't a fresh approach to the story.
Instead, the screenplay by Gary Scott Thompson and Andrew W. Marlowe is a
rehash of many of the mad scientist movies of the 50's and journeys into 
well-traveled science fiction territory.
Why is it that every genius scientist in films like "Hollow Man" always forgoes
the rigid rules of research and use themselves as guinea pigs in experiments
that are doomed to disaster? The answer is, of course, because we wouldn't be
spending our time and money watching a movie about a guy who follows the rules
of science and never strays beyond them. That would be boring. Unfortunately,
so is the cookie cutter approach made by Verhoeven and company in attempting to
recreate the mood and feel of the '33 original. There is nothing new in this
latest rendition of the Invisible Man tale, except for some first-class F/X.
Though Kevin Bacon plays the title character, Elizabeth Shue is top billed. The
actress does not reprise the power she showed in Mike Figgis's "Leaving Las
Vegas." Of course, there is a big difference between the character intense
nature of her earlier film and the F/X extravaganza of "Hollow Man." Shue
doesn't get to show any thesping ability here as she, basically, runs around
through most of the film and delivers lines like, "He's dead," with no
inflection or drama to her delivery. So far, the wow perf that Figgis got out
of her has not been duplicated since.
Kevin Bacon, as expected, is a non-person through much of the film. His
Sebastian Caine is a smart, arrogant egomaniac in the beginning and, until he
becomes a monster, pretty much stays that way. Josh Brolin and the rest of the
cast are relegated to background, though Brolin gets a bit more air time as
Linda's secret (from Sebastian) boyfriend and subject of invisible Sebastian's
ire. The remains of the cast are fodders for the monster to prey on and little
more.
Production values are high, especially in the set design by Allan Cameron
("Starship Trooper") and the F/X, led by Scott E. Anderson ("Babe"). The
sterile, high tech laboratory is slick in design and, despite the usual cheesy
computer stuff, lends a good look to the proceedings. The visual effects are
superior with the computer-generated invisibility process and, more subtly
done, Sebastian's return to visibility in water, smoke or the spray of a fire
extinguisher. Too bad high production values can't save a movie. (See the 1999
Jan de Bont film, "The Haunting," as another example of great F/X and
production design wasted.)
A final note to the screenwriters - when you kill the monster the first time,
leave it dead, please. "Hollow Man" is yet another example of a film where the
monster, beyond all reason, does not die, no matter what the hero does. Here,
Sebastian is blasted by searing flame, then electrocuted but he just keeps on
coming. The same gaff was seen in the recent, "What Lies Beneath." There the
monster wouldn't die either. The cheap shocks get tired.
