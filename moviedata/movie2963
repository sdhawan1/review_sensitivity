based on the novel by Nick Hornby
directed by Stephen Frears
Top five things thus far written about the film High Fidelity by critics
other than myself: 1. "The movie looks like it was easy to make-but it
must not have been because movies this wry and likable hardly ever get
made. Usually a clunky plot gets in the way, or the filmmakers are
afraid to let their characters seem too smart." (Roger Ebert, The
Chicago Sun Times) 2. "It's hard to remember the last time guys were
nailed so perceptively and dragged into adulthood so warmly and
entertainingly." (Jay Carr, The Boston Globe) 3. "It's the first great
date movie of 2000." (Joe Leydon, Variety) 4. "Few actors could pull off
the amount of narration required of Rob without becoming instantly
annoying; even fewer could make self-absorption somewhat sympathetic."
(Scott Renshaw, Scott Renshaw's Screening Room) 5. "I enjoyed myself
immensely." (Desson Howe, Washington Post)
Really and truly, the above compilation of quotations summarizes my
positive feelings on High Fidelity as a good mix tape should. The film
is perceptive and enjoyable, the most precisely aimed men's movie since
Swingers. Youthful males will see themselves in loquacious Rob (John
Cusack, prototypically charming), a self-pitying record store owner
intent on deciphering the mystery behind his string of failed
relationships. The first question he asks himself is "What came first:
the music or the misery?" Do sad songs ruin us, or do we gravitate
towards them after the heartbreak as a form of therapy? A chicken/egg
scenario if there ever was one.
This is what the fanatical do-I tend to filter all of my life
experiences, for better or worse, through my knowledge and appreciation
of cinema; it helps me give context to a complex emotional pathology.
Rob prisms the minutia of his existence through music-a quintet of
break-ups is related to us as another of his fanboy Top 5 lists, but
what he's really doing is playing the frustrated musician: wittily
recounting his unsuccessful love life-directly for the camera, no
less-is perhaps the closest he'll ever come to releasing a five-song EP.
(To get personal again, many movie critics are actually stymied
filmmakers, and though it's left largely unexplored, I'm assuming that
an absence of viable musical talent is what leads Rob to disc jockeying
and obsessively mixing compilation tapes for others-they're both
vicarious methods of attaining a faint taste of rock star glory.)
Of course, when we meet Rob, he's experiencing the misery instead of the
music whole; spinning records in his dingy apartment, a veritable vinyl
cellar, he's merely listening to the notes-unlike his two hired hands,
Rob's passion for music seems to rollercoaster in tune with his love
life. (He's also organizing his personal collection
"autobiographically", effectively deintellectualizing the albums
themselves.)
Those aforementioned employees are Dick (Todd Louiso), a timid buff of
all songs angst-ridden, and Barry (Jack Black), the sort of elitist one
anticipates meeting in comic book shops: fat, abrasive, elitist,
anti-populist. Barry will loudly, proudly, desperately shove his
knowledge in the face of a customer, and even refuse service to those he
deems unworthy, i.e. ignorant. (Surprise, surprise: Barry wants to form
a band, ill content with his zealot status. Naturally, Rob presumes that
Barry can't sing worth a damn.) Black's character is largely responsible
for the movie's vitality as a portrait of the record-peddling milieu.
Laura (Iben Hjejle), Rob's most recent dating casualty, has paralysed
him with self-examination; managing "Championship Records" (the sign is
missing the "SH") is the only thing getting him out of bed in the
morning, but it's not enough to keep his energies up. He'll sit idly by
as Barry abuses a potential buyer, and his Top 5 lists take on a
spectacular banality (Barry chides him for including the obvious "Smells
Like Teen Spirit" on a rundown of the best first songs of side ones).
Eventually, Rob contacts old flames (two of whom are played, in cameo,
by The Haunting duo Lili Taylor and Catherine Zeta-Jones), hoping
they'll shed some new light on his perennial girl trouble.
Don't allow his current reputation as a mounter of gloomy, expensive
period pieces (Dangerous Liaisons and Mary Reilly) to deceive you:
Stephen Frears was an ingenious choice of director for High Fidelity.
The source book, by Nick Hornby, takes place in London, and hiring a
UK-born helmer was perhaps its only shot at retaining a British
sensibility in the cinematic shift to Chicago. (It has, profoundly so.)
B-sides, these kinds of working class love/hate stories were Frears'
domain once upon a time, as his Sammy and Rosie Get Laid and Prick Up
Your Ears demonstrate. (Additionally in his favour: Frears had worked
with Cusack before, on The Grifters, and so he understands Cusack's
rhythms and doesn't disturb them.)
Perhaps I mischaracterized High Fidelity as a "men's movie" above, as
the guys at my screening were noticeably squirmy throughout, even as
they laughed uproariously. Rather, it's a movie that those women looking
for an inside track on the male species would do well to attend. It's a
testament to Cusack's familiar screen presence that his character isn't
totally despicable by story's end (or maybe he is, but my gender bias is
getting in the way), as he is largely (and often cruelly) responsible
for the death of all his affairs. One particularly unflattering moment
sees habitual Rob celebrating the possibility of reunion with Laura by
bedding the first available girl he can find. (He's not afraid of
commitment-he's afraid of committing to the wrong girl.)
Rob, Barry, and Dick have been fully realized by a team of excellent
writers, as have all sequences that take place inside "CHAMPION  IP"; I
was notably moved by a scene depicting communion among shoppers over The
Beta Band's "Dry The Rain"-it captures the familial vibe one gets while
visiting these hole-in-the-wall downtown record emporiums. Not quite as
fleshed-out is Laura-she's spoken of as having personality to spare but
doesn't have the chance to reveal enough of it in our company, though
Hjejle projects considerable warmth. Far more problematic is Tim Robbins
as Laura's tentative boyfriend Ian, for his sole defining character
trait becomes a ponytail.
A few late-in-the-game turns of the plot are also underdeveloped. It's a
shame, for instance, that we never get to see the production of a
low-rent CD that figures prominently into the climax, because, in the
words of director George Roy Hill (via William Goldman), "The audience
loves how-to.'" Luckily, the movie's breezy confidence smoothes over
these rough patches.
Twenty years from now, they'll be calling High Fidelity a Golden Oldie;
Frears' latest excited me out of a Rob-like funk (pertaining to the
state of American Cinema) with convincing mise-en-scčne, compelling
leads, an unpredictable soundtrack, and observant humour. It already
feels from a bygone era.

Directed by Stephen Frears; produced by Tim Bevan, Rudd Simmons.

on the novel by Nick Hornby.

"He's in love with rock 'n' roll, whoa... he's in love with gettin' stoned, 
whoa... he's in love with Janie Jones, whoa... he don't like his boring job, 
no!"
It's unsurprising that the song containing those lyrics is on one of Rob's 
Top Five Lists. Rob drinks and smokes too much, listens to too much loud 
music, obsesses over too many women, and isn't exactly going places 
career-wise. This hardly makes him original, but he's easy to identify with.
"High Fidelity" is his story -- that of a pop fan-boy constantly making 
lists, rearranging LPs and thinking of love songs that relate to his own 
romantic misadventures. "Never mind what people ARE like, what DO they like?" 
he philosophises at one point. "Books, movies, music... these things matter." 
He runs a big but only moderately successful store called Championship Vinyl, 
and employs two guys called Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black), who he 
has nicknamed "the musical moron twins". Dick is a shy kid whose main act of 
friendship is copying tapes. Barry is one of those know-alls who rams his 
taste down other guys' throats -- which is annoying most of the time, but 
also great for business, when he intimidates guys into buying stacks of 
albums they can barely carry. "What do you mean, you don't have 'Blonde on 
Blonde'??" he asks one man, making him feel guilty enough to empty his wallet 
and rebuild his collection.
This is a film about shift work, beer, being hung over on a Monday morning, 
listening to good tunes, and dating. In the opening scene, Rob's girlfriend 
Laura (Iben Hjejle) is leaving him for the hippie who used to live next door, 
which sets off the movie's tone of romantic longing, reminiscing and 
scheming. There is a plot of sorts -- involving Rob's attempts to reunite 
with Laura, and his visiting of old girlfriends in a goofy attempt to achieve 
catharsis with the past -- but "High Fidelity" is not a complicated story, 
and exists for Rob's musings about relationships, his lists of Top Five Worst 
Breakups, his silly ways of dealing with heartache. The style of the 
narration is inspired by another single man's cinema classic, the Michael 
Caine vehicle "Alfie" (1966), as the protagonist looks straight into the 
camera to address the audience directly. It's a good device because it's 
intimate, informal and quirky, and announces that this is a frank and 
unconventional picture, uncluttered by the usual dumb distractions of 
romantic comedies, like mistaken identities and aggravated misunderstandings.
Everything is handled so well that we almost forget how badly it could have 
been done. Rob has a heart-to-heart with Laura's best friend, and she doesn't 
offer the embarrassing pseudo-psychoanalysis that would be spoken in such 
typical Hollywood flicks as "Hanging Up". She lays things out in real terms: 
"There's two of them, there's one of you, and you're all in this mess 
together -- so sort it out."  Later, when Rob lists the worst screw-ups he's 
perpetrated against Laura, he is able to explain away some of them, but not 
all, and that rings of absolute truth. Women generally think men are 
insensitive pigs, men generally think women are nagging, hypocritical and 
paranoid -- the actuality lies somewhere in between, and "High Fidelity" is 
brilliant at presenting that middle ground. Its ending is similarly realistic 
-- Rob and Laura get back together, and Rob's explanation is not an entirely 
convincing piece of resolution... but don't we all make weird decisions, 
settle into realities that may not be permanent, and justify situations to 
ourselves instead of weighing them up?
Cusack, my favourite actor, is perhaps the only man who could have played 
Rob. His boyish wide eyes and sardonic tone of voice have more of the 
required bittersweet aura than anyone I can picture. The "High Fidelity" 
screenwriting team were also behind "Grosse Pointe Blank", one of the best 
films of 1997, and Stephen Frears, who directed the picture, is a great 
filmmaker whose credits include "Dangerous Liaisons", "The Snapper" and 
"Prick Up Your Ears". Yet so many danger signals suggested that this was 
going to be a disaster. It's based on a wonderful novel -- those usually 
translate into lousy movies. It's an American adaptation of an English story, 
which usually results in examples of bland ineptitude like "Thomas and the 
Magic Railroad". Also, its blunt world view and obsession with pop culture 
would have easily allowed it to become another obnoxiously hip and cynical 
rip-off of "Scream" or "Pulp Fiction".
All of those pitfalls have been avoided. This is a wonderful movie about real 
people, real problems and real fixations, that beautifully captures the 
texture of alternative culture. It will probably be a modest box-office 
success, then a huge cult hit on video, where it will be embraced by vinyl 
junkies, comic book fans, wearers of leather jackets, people who know the 70s 
were the best decade for American movies, tattoo and body piercing 
aficionados, twentysomethings who still have their "Star Wars" toys and 
everyone who loves the Krazy House club on Wood Street. I saw it on the first 
day of summer, and could really feel the sun come out.

Better title: "The Top Five." Of course you'd ask ... "The top five what?"
And that's just where the advertisers would love to have you. Well, the top
five most humiliating break ups for John Cusack, as a matter of fact.
Cusack, mug to camera, provides self-depreciating commentary to his dumpy
little life as a used record store owner/operator on the more urban streets
of Chicago. Fun flashbacks provide entertaining history of the top four
heartbreakers as Cusack tragically lives through break up number five in
real time.
Cusack's two loser employees (Jack Black and Todd Louiso) are hilarious. "I
can't fire these guys, I hired them for three days a week and they started
showing up everyday ... that was three years ago." Louiso is especially
lovable as the bald headed pathetically charming geek. Black is ever on the
attack aggressively defending his musical edicts.
But it's Cusack's cynical rambling that gives "HI-FI" it's biting irony.
Here are just a few juicy quotes. The ever so diplomatic... "You f***ing
bitch, let's work it out." And then on the human attraction phenomena...
"It's what you like, not what you are like." Then there's the crude, yet
clever ... "My guts have sh** for brains." Lastly, the nagging film-opening
question ... "Which came first the music or the misery?" (referring to the
depression itself vs. the depressing songs meant to ease/enable). Cusack
spends much of the film trying to understand why he's such an "F***ing
a**hole."
A little slow getting going, but fills out nicely with rough-toothed
dialogue. Eclectic music snobs are sure to have a good time.
Danish actress Iben Hjejle (who plays the lead female role) sums the film
well, "It's the most direct script about men's struggles with relationships
I've ever read. It really surprised me that it has this honesty and I think
it's very unusual for an American film to deal with subjects like this."

John Cusak stars in the adaption of the popular British novel about a broken 
hearted record store-owner
who spends most of the movie wondering why all his romantic relationships 
have failed to materialize his
whole life. Chicago is the backdrop to make the setting and characters more 
American-friendly but the
English style is ever present. 
Think of it as a really mature Kevin Smith flick (but not TOO mature), 
there's tons of discussions analyzing
pop culture and music and relationships with an added dash of brash comedy 
and the like. The comedy and
the drama (the main plot about Cusak's recent break-up with his long-time 
girlfriend and his attempt to
win her back) balance nicely - so that you have one scene of serious human 
interaction and the next is
banter about "Top five side A's, track 1's." 
It's a cute movie that has more to offer than the typical Hollywood romantic 
comedy. Probably one of the
best [first] date flicks to be released in a long time.

"High Fidelity" (2000) *** (out of four)
Directed by Stephen Frears
Written by D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, John Cusack,
and Scott Michael Rosenberg
Starring John Cusack, Iben Hjejle, Jack Black, Todd
Louiso, Lisa Bonet, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lili Taylor,
Joan Cusack, Natasha Gregson Wagner, and Tim Robbins
Just look back two years ago at the Coen Brothers'
comedic gem The Big Lebowski, change the actors, take
away the bowling alley, add a record store, and you've
got High Fidelity (or maybe the other way around since
Nick Hornby's novel High Fidelity came first). Either
way, it's been done before, a trio of losers cracking
jokes and complaining about their failed romances, yet
it remains consistently funny. Why is this? Maybe
because you know your life is much better than this,
you know these guys are more pathetic than you are,
and you know its ok to laugh at them because they're
fictional. Director Stephen Frears, possibly not
intentionally, has created a movie that makes you feel
good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good
uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day.
When watching High Fidelity, expect to laugh at
someone else's pain, realize what you are laughing at,
and then laugh again. 
I laughed at Dick (Todd Louiso), the shy, timorous,
Steve Buscemi character of Lebowski, who seems to know
what he is talking about but either can't put it into
words or is harshly rejected by his friends. I laughed
at the John Goodman character Barry (Jack Black), an
exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on The
Simpsons, pudgy, egotistic, and obnoxious at the same
time. And I laughed at Rob (John Cusack), the Jeff
Bridges type, whom the story revolves around. Rob is
the character easiest to relate to, but he is nothing
like you at all. He uncontrollably cheats and lies,
then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a
woman. And like his other miserable friends, pop music
is where he inevitably goes for comfort. 
He spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his
coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new
music and either deriding it or praising it. Whatever
human emotions The Clash, Aretha Franklin, and Bruce
Springsteen records hold, Rob and co. grasp them and
help fill voids in their social lives. Rob has built
an extensive collection in his record store as well as
his home and he organizes them depending on what mood
he is in. During this confused stage of his life in
which the movie focuses on, Rob is trying to cope with
numerous rejections over the years by visiting past
girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him.
But these aren't any girlfriendsthese girls made the
all time top five break ups in the history of Rob
(Rob's incessant use of lists show how pop music has
played a major role in his life). The plot in three
words is: women and music.
The approach director Stephen Frears takes by having
the charismatic Rob speak directly to the camera is
very effective. It gives High Fidelity a quickly
paced, informal structure, adjectives which perfectly
parallel Rob's own lifestyle. It also helps open the
viewer's eyes as to how annoying Barry is. Jack Black
steals the show with a hilariously realistic
performance as a total sleaze ball. Just listening to
him speak for five minutes makes the audience
immediately sympathetic for Rob, who must work with
him every day of the week. What Frears does so well is
that he makes us feel sorry for Rob while laughing at
his misfortunes. John Cusack plays his character
convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast,
consisting of big stars and character actors, that
really defines Rob. Now instead of Rob just talking to
the camera, after he explains something, the remaining
cast members physically and humorously create what he
is trying to say. 
The only problem with High Fidelity is that it doesn't
end when it should have ended. Instead the movie goes
on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot
longer than that. Also Bruce Springsteen is completely
wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie. 
High Fidelity is a cheerful, old fashioned comedy with
a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs. I just
hope Hollywood keeps creating losers on the big
screen, they make everyone look and feel great.

DIRECTED BY: Stephen Frears
WRITTEN BY: D.V. DeVincentis, based upon a novel by Nick Hornby
CAST: John Cusack, Todd Louiso, Tim Robbins, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Iben Hjejle
After a rather disappointing "Mary Railly", Stephen Frears is now
officially back in business with a comeback worthy of praise. This is
one of the best surprises of this season -- a sweet, small budget
comedy with a big heart. In fact it's not even a comedy. It's a drama
or even more precise -- a clever satire on human relationships and
needs. Based on a 1995 critically acclaimed novel by British author
Nick Hornby, ``High Fidelity'' is a wry and likable story about a
man's quest for fulfillment and happiness.
Rob Gordon was a DJ. It seems that he could make everything spin --
except his own life. Now he owns Championship Vinyl, a little musical
store, somewhere in New York. When he suddenly gets dumped by his
girlfriend, a gorgeous blond attorney, life suddenly looses every
purpose. Decimated, humiliated and on the verge of a mental (and
emotional) breakdown, he starts meditating over his life and the way
it could have been -- about what's right and what's important. He
starts "categorizing" life, dividing it into "top 5 lists". And the
most important is the "top 5 list" over the most painful breakups of
his life, starting with 5th grade, when he found his young girlfriend
with another boy. Though you might think that people change, grow more
mature with age, it just doesn't seem that way and all Rob's
relationships were different versions of that first. Where did he go
wrong? Was it he that screwed up? Or maybe life just stinks? While he
is lost in his own self-pity, he must think of the "top 5 list" over
his needs for the future, find the right elements and mix his life
together.
With clever parallels to the cult of celebrity, music and with
incredibly direct narration, it addresses the average audience member,
in other words -- people like you and me. Although a lot of this honor
should be addressed to the screenwriter ______ and Frears, the
director, the acting is equally important as the written word. And
here John Cusack should absolutely be mentioned. He is simply
superb. It is as much his movie as it is Frears'. The film would not
be the same without him. Cusack -- whose character is sadder, wiser
and 35 -- brings intelligence and warmth to post- mod irony. Most of
his dialogue is delivered directly to the camera -- not an easy task
-- but Cusack pulls it off. His interpretation feels so emotionally
right, so incredibly realistic and precise that Frears' message simply
can't be ignored or overseen. The other members of the cast do an
equally remarkable job. Both ______ and Jack Black are fabulous. Even
Catherine Zeta Jones appears in a role where she actually acts, not
just looks beautiful. However, the most unexpected pleasant surprises
is provided by Todd Louiso who delivers a spectacular comic
performance as Rob's co-worker and friend Dick. This is such an
impressive achievement that it's almost worth a Oscar-nomination. He
is simply a joy to behold. Otherwise, everyone are in their place, and
at the right time -- all part of Frears' colorful blend.
Pretty much like Edward Norton's "Keeping the Faith" , this film
doesn't follow any formula or belong to any genre -- it's dramatic,
tragic, sarcastic, comic and even cynical, but never bitter or
angry. It's a little bit of everything, pretty much like life
itself. Nothing seems unreal or staged. It reflects reality as a
mirror. As you watch it, you go through the same emotional problems as
the main character. You feel and think and reflect. This effect has
become a rarity nowadays.
Although it's primarily about the perils of love, ``High Fidelity'' is
secondarily about pop music. Rob owns Championship Vinyl and his
employees, timid Dick (Todd Louiso) and overbearing Barry (Jack
Black), are fellow music snobs. Music is the language in their lives,
the measure by which they define themselves and mark the significant
events of their lives. And so does the movie. It is as much a musical
film as anything else, as Rob's journey is wonderfully portrayed
through carefully inserted musical fragments.
In the end, you have gained something while watching it. It's not the
film of the century or even of the year. It's not an special effects
extravaganza. It doesn't require big explosions or digital creatures
to succeed. It's a small movie about the big things. And even though
it does not contain heavy philosophy, you feel as if you have
experienced something of significance, and you will experience that
nice warm feeling for quite some time.

IN SHORT: a passable GenX demo targeted flick
For two hours try to enjoy the new cinematic game "You Be The
Therapist," as self-proclaimed [expletive + impolite euphemism for lower
body part, hereafter] FA Rob Gordon (John Cusack) recounts his Top Five
Most Humiliating Relationships in the wake of being dumped by current
live-in flame Laura (Iben Hjejle). Perhaps in uncovering the reasons why
he was dumped, he will find enlightenment and a permanent relationship.
God knows it would make his weeping mother happy.
Rob runs a failing used record store and has borrowed cash from Laura, a
lawyer, so there's that income insecurity to deal with, amidst all his
other self-perceived problems. The man dumps his problems and
revelations upon us which, by the end of the two hours and what passes
for a happy ending, you may be sympathetic Rob or you may look on his
continuing plight with a smug satisfaction born of passing through the
kind of relationship Hell that he has experienced. Either way, you'll
have no disagreement on the fact that, yes indeedy, Rob is a FA.
At least Rob is self-aware enough to realize what he is. That's not the
case for his employee Barry (Jack Black) an overweight, abusive music
elitist who, without deliberate intention, does his best to drive away
what few customers wander in to Championship Vinyl on the North Side of
Chicago. The record store itself is so empty that thoughts of television
sitcom settings ran through Cranky's head. Indeed, most of the gags set
inside the store are, language excepted, fit for teevee. Much meeker,
but still an elitist, is co-worker Dick (Todd Louiso). The part-time
pair, who show up for work full time because they have no other lives,
have no girlfriends, don't seem to date or have any apparent hobbies
other than a manic devotion to music and things vinyl. (Kinda like
Cranky in his twenties, except for the dating and hobbies thing, which
means I can almost empathize and I'm certainly amused). At least this
pair have places to go in the course of this flick.
Said course will introduce us to the current whereabouts of all five of
Rob's humiliators, beginning with a the hot and heavy first clutch of
all, with Allison Ashmore (played at age 13 by Shannon Stillo) who
strung poor Rob along for six hours over the course of three whole days,
and destroyed whatever notions of respect of women his parents had tried
to instill. We never see the adult Allison for reasons I won't spill,
other than to say that she's not dead. There was Penny (Joelle Carter),
the "nice" girl who actively refused anything more than a kiss and
bedded a chem geek, who boasted of the experience, after dumping Rob.
Ah, the humiliation . . . but it's nothing next to the two year
relationship with Charlie Nicholson (Catherine Zeta-Jones) whose beauty
puts her so far beyond Robs perceived status that his inadequacies, real
or perceived, push the coupling towards certain doom. Finally there is
Sarah (Lili Taylor) who has been suffered mightily in her affairs. So .
.. it's better to sleep with another wretched soul than to sleep alone.
Chicago winters being what they are (and they are all you might expect
-- I've lived through 'em) keeping cozy is fine until spring fever
breaks.
That brings us back to Laura, now shacked up with a "conflicts
resolution counselor" named Ian (Tim Robbins). If anything, Rob's
thoughts on what he'd like to do to the man who stole his gal are the
funniest part of the movie. As rough as the breakup was, things just
aren't settled between the two. They don't settle out in the way you'd
expect 'em to. Rob at all times looks directly into the camera to
explain it all to us which may help you bond with the FA or may not.
Cranky settled for the smug satisfaction option, and Jack Black's
character is funny enough that he wasn't bored.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to High Fidelity, he would have paid...
High Fidelity is probably Dateflick for most GenXers and they can battle
over how big a jerk Rob is afterwards. For the rest of us, its fit for a
smaller screen and so is at pay per view level.

I used to be a major comic book geek. I still am a pretty big movie geek.
The characters in this movie are music geeks. But unlike myself, they don't
have the patience to deal with "the rest of the world" who apparently don't
know as much about music as they do. Of course, this type of snobbery isn't
very cool, but gosh darnit...it's pretty funny! Tag that onto the fact that
this film is essentially about a guy dealing with the breakup of his
relationship, and it's sad to say that my life is definitely imitating this
art. Bummer.
PLOT:
A 30-something year old man unwilling to grow up suddenly has to come to
grips with his lifelong inability to maintain any sort of successful
relationship. He decides to revisit his previous relations in an attempt to
educate and invigorate his present state of life.
CRITIQUE:
A funny, original, small tale which kept me entertained me with its laughs
and intrigued with its universal relationship dilemmas, despite almost
losing me with its never-ending conclusion. If you don't like John Cusack as
an actor or a person (is there a difference?), I would suggest you scratch
this film off your list because he is everywhere in this movie! He speaks
into the camera, plays that same guy he seems to have played in half a dozen
other flicks and ultimately takes you through the adventure of his life's
most hurtful relationships, so if you don't like him...chances are, you
won't dig the film. I did enjoy him and his performance in this movie
because of a well-written script which belted out plenty of major laughs,
tossed a few decent "dialogue keepers" out there for kicks, and ultimately
entertained and secured my interest for most of its run. Granted, I had a
major problem with Cusack's girlfriend in the movie, one Iben Hjejle, who
seemed totally out of place, radiated very little charisma, and ultimately
just jostled my attention with her come-and-go accent and inconsistent
delivery. But I digress.
Thankfully for this film and Mr. Frears, the rest of the cast was rock solid
with a handful of "name" actors dropping by for small cameos here and there.
The great Tim Robbins seemed to be the one who had the most fun with his
character, and I certainly shared in that enthusiasm. But in the end, the
movie is about relationships, love, commitment and growing up. Do these
subjects matter or mean anything to you? Have you had your heart broken,
broken a heart, felt like nothing, felt like the king of the world...well,
if you have, then chances are that you will definitely share something in
common with at least one of the characters from this movie. The story is
sincere, Cusack is very good in his role, and more than anything, the film
is actually pretty funny, especially the first half. The last 20 minutes or
so seemed to drag a little, with certain scenarios slowing the pace down,
but all in all, I enjoyed this film.
So if you like relationship comedies with touches of drama sprinkled here
and there, this one should definitely make your "to do" list for the
weekend. Ironically, for a movie that is set in and around a record store,
featuring hundreds of references to music of all eras...the soundtrack was
actually pretty inconspicuous. Strange.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
According to John Cusack and Entertainment Weekly magazine, "no one liked"
the first screenplay draft of this movie as written by Scott Rosenberg. So
Cusack himself wrote a new version, with his collaborators from GROSSE
POINTE BLANK, D.V. DeVincentis and Steve Pink (Two of his high school
buddies, with whom he also runs a production company called New Crime
Productions). "Then the Writer's Guild screwed us and gave Scott credit,
too", says Cusack. Retorts Rosenberg: "I don't want to get in a pissing
contest, but having been burned by the [credit] arbitration, I did some soul
searching and decided to work with the system and get makeup credit."
The Boss, Bruce Springsteen, has a small cameo in this movie.
The film is based on a cult comic novel of the same name written by Nick
Hornsby. One major change from the novel has apparently angered a lot of its
fans, and it has to do with the film version taking place in Chicago, while
the book was set entirely in London, England.
John's love interest in this film is played by Iben Hjejle, a Danish actress
making her American debut in this film.
Lisa Bonet played Denise on TV's "The Cosby Show" and was married to rocker
Lenny Kravitz for about six years. They have one daughter together.
Director Stephen Frears is probably best known for his 1990 overrated film
called THE GRIFTERS, also starring John Cusack, and 1988's DANGEROUS
LIAISONS, an adult version of CRUEL INTENTIONS...'tis a joke! :)

DIRECTED BY: Stephen Frears
WRITTEN BY: D.V. DeVincentis, based upon a novel by Nick Hornby
CAST: John Cusack, Todd Louiso, Tim Robbins, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Iben Hjejle
After a rather disappointing "Mary Railly", Stephen Frears is now officially back in business with a comeback worthy of praise. This is one of the best surprises of this season -- a sweet, small budget comedy with a big heart. In fact it's not even a comedy. It's a drama or even more precise -- a clever satire on human relationships and needs. Based on a 1995 critically acclaimed novel by British author Nick Hornby, ``High Fidelity'' is a wry and likable story about a man's quest for fulfillment and happiness. 
Rob Gordon was a DJ. It seems that he could make everything spin -- except his own life. Now he owns Championship Vinyl, a little musical store, somewhere in New York. When he suddenly gets dumped by his girlfriend, a gorgeous blond attorney, life suddenly looses every purpose. Decimated, humiliated and on the verge of a mental (and emotional) breakdown, he starts meditating over his life and the way it could have been -- about what's right and what's important. He starts "categorizing" life, dividing it into "top 5 lists". And the most important is the "top 5 list" over the most painful breakups of his life, starting with 5th grade, when he found his young girlfriend with another boy. Though you might think that people change, grow more mature with age, it just doesn't seem that way and all Rob's relationships were different versions of that first. Where did he go wrong? Was it he that screwed up? Or maybe life just stinks? While he is lost in his own self-pity, he must think!
 of the "top 5 list" over his needs for the future, find the right elements and mix his life together. 
With clever parallels to the cult of celebrity, music and with incredibly direct narration, it addresses the average audience member, in other words -- people like you and me. Although a lot of this honor should be addressed to the screenwriter ______ and Frears, the director, the acting is equally important as the written word. And here John Cusack should absolutely be mentioned. He is simply superb. It is as much his movie as it is Frears'. The film would not be the same without him. Cusack -- whose character is sadder, wiser and 35 -- brings intelligence and warmth to post- mod irony. Most of his dialogue is delivered directly to the camera -- not an easy task -- but Cusack pulls it off. His interpretation feels so emotionally right, so incredibly realistic and precise that Frears' message simply can't be ignored or overseen. The other members of the cast do an equally remarkable job. Both ______ and Jack Black are fabulous. Even Catherine Zeta Jones appears in a role where!
 she actually acts, not just looks beautiful. However, the most unexpected pleasant surprises is provided by Todd Louiso who delivers a spectacular comic performance as Rob's co-worker and friend Dick. This is such an impressive achievement that it's almost worth a Oscar-nomination. He is simply a joy to behold. Otherwise, everyone are in their place, and at the right time -- all part of Frears' colorful blend. 
Pretty much like Edward Norton's "Keeping the Faith" , this film doesn't follow any formula or belong to any genre -- it's dramatic, tragic, sarcastic, comic and even cynical, but never bitter or angry. It's a little bit of everything, pretty much like life itself. Nothing seems unreal or staged. It reflects reality as a mirror. As you watch it, you go through the same emotional problems as the main character. You feel and think and reflect. This effect has become a rarity nowadays. 
Although it's primarily about the perils of love, ``High Fidelity'' is secondarily about pop music. Rob owns Championship Vinyl and his employees, timid Dick (Todd Louiso) and overbearing Barry (Jack Black), are fellow music snobs. Music is the language in their lives, the measure by which they define themselves and mark the significant events of their lives. And so does the movie. It is as much a musical film as anything else, as Rob's journey is wonderfully portrayed through carefully inserted musical fragments. 
In the end, you have gained something while watching it. It's not the film of the century or even of the year. It's not an special effects extravaganza. It doesn't require big explosions or digital creatures to succeed. It's a small movie about the big things. And even though it does not contain heavy philosophy, you feel as if you have experienced something of significance, and you will experience that nice warm feeling for quite some time.

Classified as a romantic comedy, "High Fidelity" is really a valentine
to every underpaid twerp who has ever held court behind the counter in
an independent record store. I can attest to the film's authenticity,
because I was once a member of that elite corps of self-styled demigods.
>From the details of how the definitive Zombies boxed set was assembled
to the name, age and background of the new bagpipe player in the
Tannahill Weavers, we knew everything  and were more than happy to
share our wealth of knowledge.
We snickered at the buffoons at a nearby chain store who filed CDs from
the legendary band Pere Ubu in the International section (they thought
Pere Ubu was a South American country!), shook our heads sadly when
customers looked for Monty Python albums in the "P's" and taught new
reggae fans about the brightness of ska and the dreamy wonders of dub.
And, yes, when you bought the latest from Phil Collins, we made fun of
you after you left the store.
John Cusack plays Rob Gordon, owner of Championship Vinyl, a funky
little record store in Chicago (the Nick Hornby novel that inspired the
film is set in London, but the transatlantic move doesn't hurt). While
the story revolves around Rob's godawful love life, the best parts take
place in the store, where he talks minutia with his two employees: Dick
(Todd Louiso), a pale passive-aggressive type and Barry (Jack Black), an
overtly aggressive elitist.
Together, the boys pass the hours making compilation tapes, dissecting
new music, quarreling like puppies in a cardboard box and makings lists.
Lists of the all-time top five death songs, the all-time top five
breakup songs and so on. In fact, the film is built around Rob's
compilation of his all-time top five most memorable split-ups.
That Rob has been a loser in love is no surprise. While he can be
charming on occasion, the perpetual adolescent is generally a real jerk.
Aimless, self-absorbed and lacking in the social graces, Rob is the kind
of guy who shouts "Charley, you fucking bitch, let's work it out!" at a
departing girlfriend and actually expects her to turn around and come
back.
Rob shares his pain by talking to the camera, an overdone gimmick that
drives me crazy, but John Cusack pulls it off better than most. Through
his narration and numerous flashbacks, we meet some of the women who
dumped him, including Catherine Zeta-Jones and Lili Taylor (both of whom
make the best of their limited roles).
But the prime target of Rob's ramblings is Laura (Iben Hjejle), the
woman dumping him right now. Rob's misery grows when Laura takes up with
Ian (Tim Robbins), a smarmy, ponytailed fellow whose condescending tone
and mannered calm drives Rob right up the wall. Robbins drove me up the
wall as well. His is the one performance in the film that doesn't fit.
He overplays the role just enough that it feels like the actor is
actually more smug than his character.
Thank goodness for the extraordinary Jack Black, whom you might remember
as Lukas Haas' gung-ho marine brother in "Mars Attacks!" Black is a
terrific actor bound for greatness, a razor-sharp bulldog sliding from
lovable to naughty to ferocious in a single line. He projects the
intelligence and bite of vintage John Belushi, but without the aura of
self-destruction. John Cusack may be the name above the title, but Jack
Black is the real star of this show.
A number of other talented performers pop up for supporting roles and
cameo appearances. Lisa Bonet contributes a nice turn as a slurry
musician and Natasha Gregson Wagner is fine as an extremely inquisitive
journalist. Sara Gilbert, so wonderful as Darlene on "Roseanne," appears
all too briefly, as does John's sister, the delightful Joan Cusack. And,
in a very short daydream sequence, Bruce Springsteen makes his debut as
an actor, offering advice to Rob.
Director Stephen Frears ("The Grifters") juggles the flashbacks and
fantasies so adroitly that it takes awhile to notice the flimsiness of
the story. Luckily, "High Fidelity" is more about atmosphere, attitude
and snappy conversations than plot and, with a few exceptions, Frears
gets it right. The notion of returning to my record store days is
horrifying, but how nice it was to visit the boys for 113 minutes. Come
to think of it, if Jack Black was my co-worker, I might sign up for a
shift or two on weekends.

Starring-John Cusack, Iben Hjejle, Jack Black, Todd Louiso,
Joan Cusack, Lisa Bonet, Tim Robbins and Catherine Zeta-Jones
Director-Stephen Frears
Canadian Rating-PG
Released by Touchstone Pictures - 03/00
There's just something about John Cusack, isn't there? His offbeat sense
of humor and quirky idiosyncrasies have been meticulously evident
throughout the actor's career. From `Say Anything' to `Grosse Point
Blank', everything is intact, and to such an extent that I'm sure
certain individuals believe he's always played the same character. `High
Fidelity' does little else but continue the curious trend, with Cusack
doing strict Cusack, but progression is attained nonetheless. How does
he manage it? It always helps to have a fresh and limber screenplay in
which the comedic whimsy is worthy of Cusack's eccentric charm. `High
Fidelity' is, in turn, more than worthy.
Ever since a brief liaison under the football bleachers in grade 7, Rob
Gordon (Cusack) has been cursed with a romantic hex. All of his
relationships seem to hinge on some essential bond of devotion or love,
and every time, Rob blows it. Now, he owns a record store called
Championship Vinyl, and toils over his current possible break-up with
Laura (Iben Hjejle), who -- *gasp* -- may be the one he's been searching
for all along. The early structure of `High Fidelity' is built around
presenting Rob's Top Five Break-ups', which we see in amusing
chronological flashbacks. The casting in these scenarios ensures some
fun and potential surprise for audience members. Catherine Zeta-Jones
appears, sporting a deck of snobbish qualities, as a controlling
romantic interest who spews dialogue in rapid-fire bursts. And then
there's Lili Taylor, returning to comfortable ground after `The
Haunting', playing a timid partner who seems like a perfect match for
Rob.
`High Fidelity' spins a surprisingly affectionate romantic yarn that
simmers quietly under the surface without ever boiling over. This
eventually generates a sense of observant charm, which is so slight and
unanticipated that it may catch you off-guard. In addition, the cast is
populated with well-realized characters whom every actor seems perfectly
tailored for. Some of the most seasoned comedy is derived from Rob's two
employees: Barry (Jack Black), a rash and egotistical jerk who grills
any customer who wishes to buy a crummy record, and Dick (Todd Louiso),
a bashful but friendly music fanatic who seems hesitant to do anything.
Both actors are perfect in their respective roles, but Black goes
directly to town as Barry, lighting up the silver screen in a bombastic
showcase of astonishing energy that jacks up the entertainment level a
good two or three notches. John's sister, Joan Cusack, appears welcomely
as a mutual friend of Rob and Laura's. Rounding out the supporting cast
is the ceaselessly wonderful Tim Robbins, hilarious as an aging
spiritual hipster who becomes romantically entangled with Laura. A
confrontation with he and Rob, in which three alternate `Scooby Doo'
situations are presented, is manic and inspired.
`High Fidelity', based on the novel by Nick Hornby, only stumbles over a
few thematic elements. In the screen translation, Rob's character seems
to be confined at times, and lacking the edge and prickly cynicism that
his romantically-challenged character would probably envelop. Director
Stephen Frears (`The Grifters') uses the continual device of Rob talking
directly into the camera to explain his various predicaments. Thanks to
Cusack's spontaneity and distinguished range, this usually works, but
Rob's chats with the audience occasionally grow tiresome because they
lack a certain dimension of character. But no bother. Cusack, even with
the sporadic instance of jarred emotions, manages to excel in presenting
an offbeat character.... as he always does. It is pretty standard
terrain, but Frears hits the nail of relationships on the head, and
everyone seems to evolve to the liking of the viewer. Take Cusack's
effortless chemistry with `Cosby' girl Lisa Bonet, playing a beautiful
young singing talent, and you get the basic gist of the balmy approach
that `High Fidelity' is gunning for.
I was surprised at how efficiently `High Fidelity' achieved some
decisive romantic truth. It's a sweet, enjoyable motion picture,
peppered with observant chuckles and immensely likable performances.
It's familiar turf for Cusack, but `High Fidelity' sheds some gentle
light on the awkward state of dating and relationships, and gets inside
the head of your average single male. Yes, that's one small step for
John Cusack, one giant leap for mankind.

Directed by: Stephen Frears
Written by: Nick Hornby (novel), D.V. DeVincentis
Thinking back over all the horrible relationships you've had, could you rank
them in order of how painful they were? Rob Gordon, wonderfully played by
John Cusack ("Grosse Point Blank", "Being John Malkovich"), is capable of
ranking not only his worst relationships, but everything else for that
matter. Rob ranks his favorite songs, albums, movies, performers, and
anything else he can think of. Rob then proceeds to explain to the camera
and the audience why he has ranked things in such a way. I've always felt
that John Cusack was one of the more underappreciated comic actors of our
time, and he has only recently begun to be recognized by audiences and
critics. I was pleased to find that "High Fidelity" gives him the
oppurtunity to really display his comic talents.
Rob Gordon runs a record store called Champion Vinyl with his two employees,
the obnoxious Barry (Jack Black) and the meek Dick (Todd Louiso). Rob has
just been dumped by the light of his life, Laura (Iben Hjejle), and he isn't
handling it particularly well. He now spends his time relating his past
miserable experiences to the camera and trying to determine just where he
went wrong. The thing really driving Rob nuts is that Laura left him for a
guy named Ian (Tim Robbins), or Roy - he's never quite sure which name the
guy goes by. His sister, Liz (Joan Cusack), is first sympethetic to Rob's
problems, but eventually gives up on him. Rob decides to revisit his five
worst breakups to determine where exactly he went wrong in each
relationship.
There's something about "High Fidelity" which is strangely endearing. It may
be Cusack's performance as a man almost everyone can relate to in some way;
or it might be the interesting narrative style used throughout the film.
However, I'm sure it has more to do with Cusack's Rob being such a
sympathetic character, despite the way he acts at times. Certainly one of
the film's greatest features is the wonderful soundtrack (what do you expect
in a movie about a record store). Stephen Frears ("Mary Reilly") manages to
use music of just about every type, each song chosen to perfectly accompany
the scene in which it is used. Speaking of music, Jack Black ("The Jackal",
"Enemy of the State") is given a musical number near the end of the film
that makes me believe the man maybe in the wrong line of work.
If you're going into "High Fidelity" expecting a laugh-out-loud movie like
"There's Something About Mary", you're in for a disappointment. While there
are one or two truly hilarious scenes (the confrontation between Ian and
Rob, for example), the majority of the film is one you can't help but
chuckle at all the way through. The characters are all eccentric and at
least mildly amusing, except for Jack Black's character, Barry, who is an
absolute riot. I'm not sure why Black has been hiding out in minor roles for
the past seven years, but someone has to hand that man a leading role in
something. As for the rest of the cast, Joan Cusack and Tim Robbins are both
sadly underused, though newcomer Iben Hjejle is given plenty of screen time
in which to shine. Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lili Taylor, and even Bruce
Springsteen all show up in what amount to cameos.
"High Fidelity" is certainly a fun movie, but it's far from perfect. The
romantic elements are sometimes a bit overused, which leaves the film
humorless at times. The movie also runs a bit too long at 113 minutes, with
the last fifteen being almost unnecessary (except Black's musical number).
If you're a fan of John Cusack, I would certainly recommend this movie. If
you're one of those rare individuals who doesn't care for him, "High
Fidelity" just might make you a fan of his. I'm not sure if the soundtrack
is out yet, but if it is I'd recommend picking it up. One last thing I
wanted to note, I'm not sure what Frears believes Chicago is like, but I
could have sworn there were more people living there than we see here. I'd
recommend "High Fidelity" to just about anyone (unless you dislike comedies,
of course) and give it four out of five stars.

"Did I listen to pop music because I was miserable or am I miserable
because I listen to pop music?" Rob Gordon (John Cusack) says in
voice-over in the introduction to Stephen Frears's HIGH FIDELITY.
Rob runs an old-fashioned vinyl record store, "located in a neighborhood
that attracts the bare minimum of window shoppers." He has precisely two
employees, Barry (Jack Black) and Dick (Todd Louiso), whom he hired to
work for 3 days a week, but since they come every day anyway, he figures
that he can't fire them. The three of them insult what few customers
they have unless they consider the buyer's level of musical knowledge
acceptable. They spend their time in the store quizzing each other and
coming up with various 5-best lists.
"I know we don't have customers, but I thought that was a bad thing and
not a business strategy," Barry tells Rob while apologizing for telling
Rob's newest heartthrob about the store. Barry, who will form the Sonic
Death Monkey band before the film is out, is outlandishly hilarious.
Although Rob has had a lot of girlfriends (Lisa Bonet, Joelle Carter,
Iben Hjejle, Lili Taylor, Natasha Gregson Wagner and Catherine
Zeta-Jones), he considers himself a failure when it comes to
relationships since none of them have lasted. His most important top-5
list is that of his biggest breakups. Besides humorous flashbacks about
his previous failures at sex and at relationships, there are many
current episodes as he interviews his ex-girlfriends to find out what
went wrong.
Easily half of dialog occurs with Cusack talking directly to the camera.
His soliloquies are heavily laced with self-deprecating humor, and he
has a hangdog look that says "dump me" on his forehead. "He's grumpy,
he's broke and he hangs out with the musical moron twins," Rob says of
himself, asking himself how in the world he attracts these great looking
women in the first place?
Rob's most recent girlfriend and the one that gets the most screen time
is Laura, played warmly and fetchingly by Iben Hjejle from MIFUNE. Their
chemistry together has the definite spark that his other relationships
lacked.
In one of his best performances ever, Cusack is absolutely delightful.
Sympathetic, funny, sweet and sad, Cusack's Rob is a person that
everyone can identify with in some way.
The movie is fresh and original, thanks to a great script by D.V.
DeVincentis, Steve Pink, John Cusack and Scott Rosenberg, based on
DeVincentis's novel, and it contains a large number of big laughs. And,
as you might guess, it has a killer soundtrack.
A good-spirited and funny film, HIGH FIDELITY has to go on the top of
your must-see list if you're a John Cusack fan. And, for the few of you
who aren't, this movie should serve to change your mind.
HIGH FIDELITY runs 1:47. It is rated R for sexuality and language and
would be fine for most teenagers.

Don't you just love movies where the characters and their situations remind 
you of your own life? No movie can replicate your life verbatim, but those 
that have realistic characters in realistic situations speaking realistic 
dialogue are my favorites. That's why "High Fidelity" works so well for me. 
It's movie with a rather simply, calm story about a guy who pines over lost 
loves and discusses pop music history with his friends and it's fascinating. 
The film works on two levels: as a breezy portrait of modern-day GenX and 
GenYers who haven't really grown up yet and can still cherish, savor and 
appreciate spending most of the their time hanging with friends and rapping 
about their favorite CDs, TV shows and movies. So many people believe it's 
the little things in life that bring people together and make relationships 
work and the theme of "High Fidelity" exemplifies this when the main 
character Rob (John Cusack), is pining over his latest breakup and says, 
"It's not what YOU'RE like, it's WHAT you like." 
Cusack delivers one of his finest performances to date playing a character 
that's an assemblage of virtually every other characters he's played before. 
He also co-wrote and co-produced the film which works to his advantage all 
that much more. Rob Gordon is a GenXer in his late 20's who owns a used 
record store called Championship Vinyl. Business isn't exactly booming and 
most of the customers are personal friends of Rob's and his two employees': 
the hyperactive, bossy music snob Barry (Jack Black) and the quiet, low-key, 
almost masochistic Dick (Todd Louiso). Barry insults potential customers and 
guilts surviving ones into buying more vinyl albums ("What do you mean you 
don't own 'Blonde on Blonde'!? For God's sake don't tell anyone!" he says as 
he stacks another record on a stack a schmuck customer's carrying thereby 
totally obscuring his vision). Dick is Barry's whipping boy who's too much of 
an introvert to so much stand by his convictions, let alone raise his voice. 
"I can't fire these guys. I hired them for only three days a week and they 
just kept showing up. That was four years ago," says Rob. 
As the film opens Rob's in the middle of a break-up with longtime girlfriend 
Laura (Iben Hjejle). They've been living together and she's slowly moving her 
stuff out. Where's she's going to and why she's leaving aren't clear. The 
film doesn't go into a lot of detail and drama over their relationship, not 
at first at least. Instead, it's a catalyst for Rob to tell us all about 
himself - how he is doomed to be left, rejected and heartbroken. He launches 
into a "Top Five" list of his all-time most painful breakups, from the girl 
he went out with for three days in a row in seventh grade to the present day. 
The first half to two-thirds of the film is lighthearted character humor with 
the occasional check back to Rob and Laura's relationship, or what's left of 
it. The film does an excellent job in balancing these two separate stories of 
Rob's life within and outside of his relationship. There's so many great 
scenes of Rob hanging with Dick and Barry at bars and clubs making lists of 
the best songs ever and pondering about what it'd be like to date a musician 
who might include one of their jokes in the liner notes of their album. 
There's also flashbacks to the other breakups on his list, which stay within 
the confines of the lighthearted story and never get too serious despite the 
fact they're all about rejection. The only really "serious" aspects to the 
film are when Rob and Laura talk and argue about whether they can patch 
things up and what the future holds. The story will take a very serious turn 
as it winds down, teetering on melodrama but makes amends by having a 
slightly unusual but charming ending. 
If I had to cite the film for any major flaws it would be for how it deals 
with Rob and Laura's post-relationship relationship. This is a romantic 
comedy to be sure, which means a touch of the intense is a given but the 
screenplay is a just a bit choppy. The reason they broke up has to do with 
Rob having slept with someone else and Laura having an abortion without even 
telling him. Little detail is revealed about this aspect which I think is a 
necessity. If they were such a great couple why did Rob cheat and who did he 
do it with? And what's the deal with this new guy Laura's seeing? He's a New 
Age guru named Ian who eats a lot of organic food, listens to "whatever world 
music is popular this week" and supposedly has the best sex in the world 
(played by Tim Robbins with tongue firmly in cheek). For a film that's so 
relatable this seems just a bit out of place, although when we examine Rob's 
other breakups he's always been dumped for a guy who's a total jerk. 
I guess it's not the point, really. The payoff comes not in Rob's efforts to 
get Laura back (however unsuccessful and/or funny they may be), but in those 
moments where he opens up inside and says the reasons he REALLY misses Laura. 
Of course they involve the little things she did and other such 
characteristics which keeps with the film's theme. These romantic aspects to 
"High Fidelity" work on so many more levels and are so much more appreciable 
than most dramas try to do so much more forcibly (i.e. "The English Patient," 
"Bounce").
It's difficult to say what the best aspect to "High Fidelity" is. I love how 
the characters talk about real things and have real problems. I love the 
production design that makes every single set in the film look like a real 
place (the fact most of it was shot on location may be a reason why). And I 
absolutely adore the technique of having Rob speak directly to the camera, 
not just in scenes where he's alone in a room but scenes where there's people 
all around him. Everyone wants to have an anonymous outlet and we play that 
role for Rob. There's also a some smart fantasy scenes such as when Rob 
dreams of confronting Ian or when he asks Bruce Springsteen if he's one of 
"The Boss's" songs come to life. 
If there's any justice young men around the world will realize "High 
Fidelity" is probably the perfect film to watch on a date because it will 
inspire so much conversation. As Rob said, it's not what you're like, it's 
WHAT you like and I can't imagine anyone not liking this film. 

[Critic's note: This is a re-write of a capsule review I initially wrote back 
in April. It's the best movie I've seen so far this year and I thought I 
should give it a proper full-length review if I name it the best movie of 
2000. So I rented it and realized it was even better than I had given it 
credit for. So here's a proper, honest review. The original capsule review 
can be read here.]
Think of it as a really mature Kevin Smith flick (but not TOO mature), 
there's tons of discussions analyzing pop culture and music and relationships 
with an added dash of brash comedy and the like. The comedy and the drama 
(the main plot about Cusack's recent break-up with his long-time girlfriend 
and his attempt to win her back) balance nicely - so that you have one scene 
of serious human interaction and the next is banter about "Top five side A's, 
track 1's." 
It's a cute movie that has more to offer than the typical Hollywood romantic 
comedy. Probably one of the best [first] date flicks to be released in a long 
time.

Directed by Stephen Frears. Screenplay by D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink,
John Cusack and Scott Rosenberg, based on the novel by Nick Hornby.
Starring Cusack, Todd Louiso, Jack Black. Running time: 113 minutes.
Rated AA for offensive language (MFCB). Reviewed on April 12th, 2000.
Here they are, my all-time Top Five Things To Know About "High Fidelity":
1. The synopsis (well, every review's got to have a synopsis, right?).
Relationships and music, music and relationships -- that's pretty much
what "High Fidelity" is all about. John Cusack plays Rob Gordon, a
thirtysomething record store owner whose longtime girlfriend Laura (Iben
Hjejle) has just left him. Watching her drive away, Rob makes up a list
of his top five worst break-ups, and is delighted that Laura hasn't made
the cut. At a crossroads in his life, Rob decides to revisit each of these
five former lovers (including half the cast of "The Haunting"). He hopes
that in so doing, he will finally figure out why all of his romantic
entanglements turn out disastrously. Meantime, he's also got to decide if
he's happy spending his days running a record store, or if he wants to get
something more out of life.
There can be little doubt that this movie turns on John Cusack's everyman
qualities. Cusack has always had a broad appeal, even when he's portrayed
such unusual characters as a professional assassin ("Grosse Pointe Blank")
and a puppeteer with a mystical connection to John Malkovich ("Being John
Malkovich"). In "High Fidelity", for once he's playing a character who
isn't larger-than-life. Rob Gordon is a pretty regular guy, with a regular
job and regular problems; it's hard not to relate, so the movie is
accessible on a very fundamental level. His overriding passion is music,
and his life is replete with its trappings, but not to the point where we 
feel alienated from him. For example, to help himself get over Laura, he
reorganizes his record collection. "Chronologically?" he's asked.   
"Autobiographically," he replies, and our gut reaction is no different   
than if he were eating cookie dough ice cream. Rob is a well-crafted
character, and Cusack's portrayal of him is spot on -- if its main
character weren't someone the audience could relate to, "High Fidelity"
would have been a flop.
The toughest aspect of Cusack's performance is the fact that he makes
frequent asides to the audience; indeed, in several cases these asides   
become full-blown soliloquies. But Cusack knows how to deliver a
monologue; he keeps them lively and interesting, without exaggerating for
effect. Indeed, these are some of "High Fidelity"'s most enjoyable scenes,
which is an accomplishment, given that this kind of filmmaking device
often comes across as stagy and dull.
Cusack might be the high point of "High Fidelity", but it doesn't hurt
that he's been placed in pretty talented company. Of particular note are 
Todd Louiso and Jack Black as Dick and Barry, Rob's employees at the
record store, die-hard music buffs who were hired as part-time help years
ago and haven't stopped showing up since. Barry is the loud and boisterous
one, while Dick is reserved and polite. Together, they form one of the
best comic double acts in quite some time. Also very good is Iben Hjejle
as Laura. Hjejle's is the film's most complex role: for much of the movie,
she has to be convincingly at odds with the protagonist, but at the same 
time not come across as "the villain", nor forget that Laura and Rob did
once care about each other -- and, perhaps, still do. The relationship   
between Rob and Laura is meant to be realistic, and even though we're
seeing everything from Rob's biased perspective, this sense of realism
would have been shattered had Hjejle's performance not been so moderate
and considered.
In addition to the movie's main cast, a number of popular actors have    
extended cameos in "High Fidelity". These are a lot of fun, especially
since several of the actors are playing either exaggerated versions of   
their public image, or else totally against type. For example, Tim Robbins
is cast as Ray, an irritating, ponytailed faux-intellectual who is Laura's
new love interest. One of the movie's funniest scenes depicts Rob
fantasizing about all the things he'd like to do Ray when the latter
confronts him over Laura. Needless to say, the fantasies are neither
pretty nor anything approximating reality. Catherine Zeta-Jones,
meanwhile, plays Rob's ex-girlfriend Charlie, a sensuous high-society    
type who may not be everything Rob remembers.
Based on the 1995 novel by Nick Hornby, "High Fidelity" is a hilarious
and eclectic look at love, but one which will likely ring true to many
viewers. Particularly interesting is the way the movie's version of events
is subordinate to Rob's views on his life. Our introduction to various   
characters and situations is colored by his opinions and memories, and so
even though it might feel like we're getting the whole story, there are  
times when we're really only getting a Rob-biased perspective on things.  
As Rob uncovers the misunderstandings and misconceptions which have
dominated his love life, so too do we.
Probably the only real downside to "High Fidelity" is a subplot about
Rob's desire to be a record producer. Although it does arise naturally
from the film's subject material, it nonetheless feels artificially      
appended to the movie, there mostly to give the events a typical Hollywood
ending. But "High Fidelity" doesn't really need this; its proper climax
comes fifteen minutes before the credits roll, and the extra material
ultimately feels like padding. Funny padding, yes, but padding
nonetheless.
But this is a minor flaw. "High Fidelity" is a fun, lightweight movie
which derives its laughs not from scripted routines but from experiences 
most anyone who's ever been in a relationship (or even just wanted to be 
in a relationship) will be familiar with. It is a film which draws its   
audience in slowly, and plays out gradually, and this may lose people     
looking for a more high-octane ride. But in its totality, "High Fidelity"
is an experience which is not just entertaining, but also very true.

---This review will be published to
http://www.moviereviews.org/high_fidelity.htm on Friday, March 31, 2000, the
film's release date---
Here's the good news: Tim Robbins, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Jack Black are
excellent in their supporting roles. Here's the bad news: the trio are
responsible for 100% of the all-too-rare laughter in the movie. This is a
major problem for an already hurting High Fidelity, yet another
midlife-crisis saga involving old girlfriends and supposedly deep
meditations like `what came first  music or misery?' The movie offers the
audience plenty of both.
Rob (John Cusack) is depressed because his love life has proven to be
disaster after disaster. His latest girlfriend, Laura (Iben Hjejle), a
rather plain-looking blonde woman with a slight British accent, has just
walked out and Rob's self-therapy is to reminisce over his top five breakups
of all time. Actually, he finds a way to turn everything into a top five
list even though the Letterman-style jokes always fail to land.
Rob ultimately reaches the conclusion that in order to move forward, he must
resolve the past. (There's a new one!) His voyage from ex-girlfriend to
ex-girlfriend quickly becomes as dim and hopelessly misguided as Christopher
Columbus' (Look! The West Indies!). But the filmmakers seem totally
oblivious to the fact that Rob is uninteresting and sail on into dangerously
unentertaining waters.
Fortunately, Jack Black enters as Barry, an overly cynical employee of the
record store that Rob owns. Black, a slightly more petite version of Chris
Farley with the same energy and roll-in-the-aisles sarcasm, shows up on
screen every so often, thus keeping the film from sinking into the pits of
Hollywood's absolute worst. Unfortunately, the other record store employee,
Dick (Todd Louiso), does little to further the film's humor or plot, proving
to be an unnecessary timesuck in an already overlong production.
Tim Robbins plays the new boyfriend of, Laura, Rob's latest breakup. The
character, unlike most in the movie, is very well written with a certain Zen
quality that makes for a hilarious misfit in the edgy 90's environment.
Robbins conquers it well with his usual competence, despite being surrounded
by utter incompetence.
Catherine Zeta-Jones portrays Charlie, one of the five great breakups of Rob
's life. Aside from being the most attractive person in this film (not even
a close call), Zeta-Jones somehow transforms her poorly written character
into a mildly intriguing interlude of Rob's past and present. The other
former girlfriends are dull, boring and clichéd (although points should be
awarded for making the only other semi-attractive one a film critic).
Where the movie does score big is its soundtrack, although such is the norm
for music-related films. The press notes list some 59 tunes. Highlights
include a couple of Lou Reed songs performed by Velvet Underground, an Elton
John number and Queen's triumphant `We Are the Champions.'
High Fidelity also seems to have some problems creating a realistic setting.
Except for one night club scene, it appears that the filmmakers forgot to
hire extras for their ordinarily busy background setting of Chicago.
High Fidelity, which I admit not having read, was a successful book probably
because it tapped a certain psychological truth much like Salinger did in
the landmark The Catcher in the Rye. But Holden Caulfield has never made it
to film because the production would get too confusing trying to follow such
mental ramblings; trying to track Rob has the same problems causing the
audience to get lost and, ultimately, bored.
At one point, Rob ponders `Did I listen to pop music because I was miserable
or was I miserable because I listened to pop music?' I don't know. But I do
know this: I didn't see this movie because I was miserable that evening, I
was miserable that evening because I saw this movie. And if you mistakenly
venture out to see this movie, you will quickly learn that misery loves
company.

  In this romantic comedy, John Cusack plays a self-confessed
music junkie who owns Championship Vinyl, a dilapidated record store
in downtown Chicago. Having just been dumped by his girl-friend
(delectable Danish actress Iben Hjejle), he spends his days playing
verbal trivia games with his two moronic employees (Todd Louiso, Jack
Black), who share his encyclopedic knowledge of pop music and the
music scene, and most nights morbidly picking at the scab of his
emotional misery. In the form of an into-the-camera confessional, he
chronicles the failed relationships that repeated his first rejection
at age 14 in junior high school. "Did I listen to pop music because I
was miserable or was I miserable because I listened to pop music?" he
muses, organizing his record collection, not alphabetically or
chronologically, but autobiographically, so he has to remember the
connections.  While he considers himself unlucky in love, his ex's
include Catherine Zeta Jones, Lili Taylor, Joelle Carter and Lisa
Bonet. Joan Cusack plays his pal while Tim Robbins is hilarious as a
rival suitor. Based on a novel by Nick Hornby, it's been cleverly
adapted by D.V. DeVincentis & Steve Pink & John Cusack, who worked
together on Grosse Pointe Blank, plus Scott Rosenberg and perceptively
directed by Stephen Frears, who makes Cusack into a self-reflecting
Everyman who wonders if he'll ever find true love. With his
ingratiating charm and impeccable timing, Cusack is not only likable
but believable. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, High-Fidelity
is an honest, funny, ironic 8. Striking a timely, contemporary note,
it's a "must see" for anyone who wants to know the truth about young
men - and their obsession with music.

What are the top 5 best films of the year 2000. Well, admittedly its
still too early to start calling the shots. But be prepared for this
funny and charming little gem from director Stephen Frears, as it
already has my attention.
The story if about Rob Gordon (John Cusack), a thirty-something
entrepreneur and owner of a small used record store in downtown
Chicago. Now, Rob has a problem and that is, Laura (Iben Hjejle) his
live in girl friend of several years has moved out. Rob, heartbroken
and introspective tries to re-evaluate his love life.
That plot line, in and of itself is pretty nondescript. What makes
this film so enjoyably fresh is the marvelous script by Mr.'s
DeVincentis, Pink, Cusack, and Rosenberg. John Cusack as Rob Gordon
breaks the cinematic third wall, conversing with the audience
throughout the film. His self examination is both poignant and
revelatory. We are witness to a man, who has been unwilling to face
his life, coming to terms with his adolescence and his own immaturity.
Rob Gordon is just such a fascinating, human character. And Cusack's
performance is one of his best, equaling his turns in 'Grosse Point
Blank' and (one of my favorite films) 'Say Anything'.
There are so many surprises in the film, including but not limited to
uncredited performances by Tim Robbins (as Ian Raymond) and Catherine
Zeta-Jones (as former girlfriend Charlie Nicholson). But performances
are wonderfully timed comic turns, with Ms. Zeta-Jones turning a
trophy lover into a bittersweet shrew. The rest of the cast is also
remarkably good, with special credit to Jack Black (famed co-creator
of the fictional acoustic punk group 'Tenacious D'), who turns in one
of the funniest characters in recent years. What makes Barry (Jack
Black) so funny is that we recognize him immediately. Most of us have
had to deal with a retail clerk whose self importance and superiority
were insufferable, and Jack Black's performance is hilariously on
target in both its accuracy and self depreciation.
Lisa Bonet (as singer Marie DeSalle) is a revelation, both for her
performance and her singing (Her performance of "Baby, I Love Your
Way" is a revelation). This is a grand surprise and a welcome one.
Iben Hjejle as Laura has a soulful and graceful quality that lights up
the screen. Her performance is the emotional heart of the film. And as
such, gives greater resonance to Rob's acceptance of adulthood and
responsibility.
The screenplay by D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, John Cusack and Scott
Rosenberg is both knowingly funny and insightful. There is not a
wasted line or scene. Every moment of the film brings with it new
information to each of the characters and their situations. This may
just possibly be the best screenplay of this year. I cannot remember
any film recently (save for those by Woody Allen) that treats all of
its characters with such aplomb. Not even the most minor of supporting
roles is without its truth and honesty. And mention must be made of
some of the funniest and wittiest dialogue since 'Grosse Point Blank'
(also co-written by Mr.'s DeVincentis, Pink, and Cusack).
Stephan Frears (who's underrated "The Van" rates as one of 1996's best
films), has another grand inclusion to his resume here. His direction
of the film is marvelously subtle and subversive. Taking the technique
of breaking the barrier of the screen from 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off',
he reinvents it. Using it to force the audience to identify and
sympathize with the character of Rob Gordon. The mise-en-scčne, strewn
with vinyl records and classic music, ranging from the '13th Floor
Elevators' "You're Gonna Miss Me" to a cameo by Bruce Springsteen as
an imaginary "pop" psychologist; is wondrous. I only hope that the
AcademyŽ has a long memory come nomination time in 2001.
In conclusion, "High Fidelity" is one of the best surprises of the
pre-summer season. This is a film that will be laughed at and with. A
knowing and thoughtful film that will entertain anyone who's ever been
in love and lost. And knows all of the best songs to listen to while
they recover.

American popular music may have changed in style as time has gone by,
but has remained constant in theme. The topics of romance and
heartbreak remain characteristic of the genre, reflecting the
obsessions of its youthful audience. This film uses popular music to
metaphorically represent the turbulent romantic life of its
characters.
The story begins as Rob Gordon (John Cusack) and his current
girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) are breaking up their relationship. Rob
is the main character, a young record store owner who has classified
and cataloged his romantic failures as obsessively as his record
collection. He recounts his most troubling breakups and analyzes where
in the pantheon this latest one should be placed. Rob decides (aided
by an apparition of Bruce Springsteen) that in order to understand his
bad luck with romance, he must revisit and dissect each of his worst
breakups and understand the problems in the relationships that caused
them. The most enjoyable part of the film is the depth to which Rob
goes in exploring all aspects of his old relationships. It is an
intelligent approach that is not often seen in popular film.
In contrast to its serious side, Rob's connection to popular music
also anchors its humorous part. The record store he owns specialized
in rare and collectible vinyl records, and the two clerks who work for
him are indeed odd characters. There is the neurotic and meek Dick
(Todd Louiso), and unrestrained Barry (Jack Black). The elitist trio
sneer at all people, even customers, who have "lesser" tastes in
music. It is a construction that does not necessarily make them
likeable, but makes them entertaining. Barry in particular is often
overboard, but also causticly funny.
Although it is common to use voice over narration at the beginning of
a film to set context, or at the end of the film to provide an
epilogue, it is not often used by good films as prominent part of its
storytelling. This film uses soliloquy (having Rob talk directly to
the audience) to distracting excess. It is far too easy to have the
character intravenously feed the audience his inner thoughts. Good
craftsmanship could have expressed these feelings in a more indirect
manner, such as inter-character dialog and expressive performance. It
is surprising that veteran director Stephen Frears chose this route.
The other major complaint is the use of an overly melodramatic plot
device to develop Rob and Laura's relationship. The suddenness and
force of this occurrence feels manipulative. The weaknesses of this
film are surprising considering the body of work compiled by Stephen
Frears, whose films are generally more oblique and engaging.
Recommended. The film attempts to intelligently and realistically
examine the issue of relationships in modern life, and it is mostly
successful in this dimension. It also uses character based humor that
is frenetic, but still enjoyable. The film has definite weaknesses
which keep it from reaching its full potential, but it remains a more
thought-provoking exploration of romance than what is typically
produced.

John Cusack is the kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his
respective film roles. So effortlessly that people tend to forget he's there,
much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors (anyone
who can put the name James Rebhorn with that actor's face is invited to treat
themselves to a product from one of my sponsors). Example: The other day my
mother asked me (the expert, of course) if there were any movies out worth
seeing, never mind that our tastes couldn't be more divergent--- I'll never
forget the day she recommended that I go see A NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY for god
sakes, and to be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that GO!
was a lot of fun (which it is), so I didn't see this as anything more than a
futile attempt at conversation. I muttered, with a little trepidation, that she
might enjoy HIGH FIDELITY. She responded with her usual query," Whose in that
one?" This is a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the
kind of movie you went to see. If the reply is Julia Roberts you probably
assume it was something wispy and light, a Sylvester Stallone movie and you
picture a bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing, and a
Woody Allen movie means hyper articulate white people (usually of the Jewish
faith) fretting about in some Upper East Side palace. Anyway, when I answered
"John Cusack", she replied with a rather stunned "Who?", as if it was
unreasonable for her to know whom I was referring to.
Now I know for a fact that my mother has seen several Cusack movies, most
recently BEING JOHN MALKOVICH and PUSHING TIN, but I suppose it's
understandable that she would not recognize the name, after all, for most,
names are tougher than faces. I showed her a picture of Cusack's mug in the
paper hoping for an "Oh - him, yes he's quite good" instead I got a "No - I
don't know him". At this point I was way beyond frustration into a realm of
nose hair yanking anger (yes, filmic ignorance is all it takes to get me into
the nose hair pulling zone), till I realized something: I doubt that much of
America would recognize Cusack's relatively bland visage, or even the name
which is rather bland compared to the coolness of a Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise,
one-syllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity of a speeding
car.
Cu-sack. Cu-sack - no, not quite as cool. I'm sure that twenty years from now
Cusack will forever be referred to as "the guy from (add in the Cusack film of
your choice)". He's not a brand name, and his movies usually aren't big
moneymakers, but in his own unassuming way he's kind of a genius.
With his pleasant, common man looks, and charming semi-articulate blatherings
he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the 90's. From
THE SURE THING to SAY ANYTHING Cusack has merged the talents of early Tom Hanks
and early Jack Lemmon. Despite the fact that nearly every character he plays is
a variation of the character before it (the schlumpy every man), he's a
constantly enjoyable screen persona, like Albert Brooks or Woody Allen. And he
knows how to chose scripts, while the Stephan Baldwin's and Val Kilmer's seem
to put them selves in everything (the former actually had the insight to follow
up Oscar winner USUAL SUSPECTS with a Pauly Shore vehicle, and judging from his
latest projects it looks like he still has yet to fire his agent), Cusack
generally picks rewarding projects (save for the unwatchable HOT PURSUIT, a
1988 film also featuring a young Ben Stiller).
HIGH FIDELITY is his second collaboration with hit or miss English director
Stephan Fears (THE GRIFTERS, THE HI-LO COUNTRY), and it's a hit. It was also
co-written by Cusack, and some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy,
GROSSE POINT BLANK. It's not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film,
but as it progresses in its meandering fashion, the movie cast something of a
spell over me. HIGH FIDELITY begins as a hipster ode to the non-committal Rob,
a vinyl record store owner, who opens the film by breaking down the fourth wall
with much abandon and educating us in his "top 5 break ups list". This is
something Cusack does the entire film a la FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF. At first
the talking-directly-into-the-camera-schtick had me vaguely annoyed, mostly
because it reminded me so much of the film BODY SHOTS which used a similar
conceit, but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to Cusack's witty
delivery. He's the kind of guy we don't mind talking directly to us.
Gradually the film settles into a SHAMPOO-like tragi-comic character study, of
a guy who must confront himself and his personal failures in order to figure
out the true person he is (yes it's all very existential). Though that
plot-line is mostly enjoyable, the thing I liked the most about the film is how
much pleasure it offers in introducing us to minor characters, all of whom (now
this is really something) are terrific enough to warrant their own films.
The best of which is Jack Black (of the very funny show TENACIOUS D, a program
that sadly went the way of Bruce Willis' hairâŚunfortunately that annoying
smirk remains), an ardent record store employee who bullies customers into
buying exactly what he wants them to buy. He's the kind of guy I'm sure we've
all met before, a blowhard who thinks he's always right and will do anything in
his power (be it yell, argue, insult) to hoist his opinion onto others. But I
like this guy, because of how Black plays him. The actor is portly with a round
baby face and crazy eyes, but despite his size he leaps to and fro like a manic
speed freak (which might be a bit of a redundant description, seeing as how all
the speed freaks I know are manic). He's the kind of supporting character who
would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most other films. (Look at what
that hack Jan de Bont did to poor Phillip Seymour Hoffman in TWISTER). But
Fears and Black never let that happen. The character, for all his shucking and
jiving is steeped in reality. He's over the top, but in a way we can all
probably relate to.
Catherine Zeta-Jones, in her brief role, gives a vivid portrayal of a women
completely enamored with her own "charm". Tim Robbins registers in an even
tinier part as a New Age-type, a character played entirely for cartoon yuks,
but still manages to work its desired comic effect. The one exception in the
acting department is a bit of a doozy, the main love interest played by Danish
actress Iben Hjejle (MIFUNE), who completely obliterates any trace of a Danish
accent, replacing it with a stilted American phonation. I give her kudos for
attempting such a contradictory role, but instead of being likeable, she comes
across as rather robotic, and as such it's hard to see why Cusack's character
would be so obsessed with her especially when he has a beautiful, intelligent
writer (Natasha Gregson Wagner) potentially waiting in the wings. This reminded
me of SAY ANYTHING, where the charming Cusack was paired with the charmless
Ione Skye, and in MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL where the poor
bastard had to put up with Alison Eastwood (whose unbelievably more wooden then
father, Clint for those "special people" whose wheels turn a little slower). In
fact Cusack is rarely paired up with a personality that matches his, though I'd
bet that if Laura and Natasha switched roles, the result would be more
effective.
HIGH FIDELITY works almost entirely on the strength of its characters and
performances. Fears' direction is somewhat stilted, and the script is sometimes
a little too (and this is a word I'm beginning to hate to use but alas I must)
quirky for its own good (I think I'll blame that on Scott Rosenberg, who
judging from what he did with BEAUTIFUL GIRLS, CON AIR, and THINGS TO DO IN
DENVER WHILE YOUR DEAD, has his fingerprints all over the most irritating bits
of this movie). But Cusack really does deserve an award, for being so
damnâŚCusackian. I'm afraid that his talents are so understated that he may
have to wait till his hip needs replacing to be offered such an award worthy of
his considerable talent. His character, Rob (whose sort of like an older, more
bitter Lloyd from SAY ANYTHING) is funny and tragic without being pathetic, and
that Cusack can do all this, and still not imprint himself onto the minds of
most audiences, is something of an achievement.

         Unresolved relationships can be like those mildly irritating
but fiendishly catchy pop songs you sometimes come across while
listening to the radio: Try as you might, you just can't get them out of
your mind.
 For record store owner Rob (John Cusack), the tune he can't
shake off is his former girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle), who recently
moved out of the dumpy apartment they shared with his racks of vintage
vinyl and CDs. "You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks since I
met you," Laura sighed, and she's not far off the mark. Rob, as readers
of Nick Hornby's novel "High Fidelity" know, is one of those guys who's
struggling to hold on to his youth by staying poor, avoiding heavy
responsibilities and hanging out with slackers and semi-slackers who
want nothing more out of life than to join a garage band or find a
mint-condition mono copy of Bob Dylan's "Blonde on Blonde."
In many ways, Rob is a quintessential Cusack hero. Although he's
reasonably bright, he over-analyzes every aspect of his life, and
despite having some ambition, he seems incapable of focusing his energy.
         To some extent, "High Fidelity" has exactly the same problem.
The screenplay is almost fervently faithful to the book, but what was
breezy and funny on the page doesn't always play out. Trying to transfer
Hornby's first-person narrative to the screen, Cusack and three other
scripters have given Rob lots of breaking-the-fourth-wall monologues
that bog down what little momentum the story has.
 The movie also mistakenly moves the action from Hornby's
mid-1990s London to contemporary Chicago. The novel's very British
attitude (all those suppressed emotions, all those worries about class
differences) doesn't survive the journey, and if "High Fidelity" is
ultimately about anything, it's about attitude.
 What the film does manage to put across is the enticing
atmosphere of an independent music shop, where clerks argue over whether
the Righteous Brothers' version of "Little Latin Lupe Lu" is better than
Mitch Ryder's cover and band names like Sigue Sigue Sputnik and Stiff
Little Fingers actually mean something to the customers. If you've spent
any time working or shopping in such a place, you'll completely identify
with Rob and his buddies.
 "High Fidelity" also scores some laughs with cameos by a
ponytailed Tim Robbins (as a Steven Seagal wannabe), Catherine
Zeta-Jones (as a chic but bubbleheaded former flame of Rob's) and even
Bruce Springsteen, who drops by to offer much-needed advice on affairs
of the heart. Cusack is his usual agreeable self -- think of Lloyd
Dobler from "Say Anything" on the edge of 30 -- and the soundtrack,
featuring artists ranging from Stereolab to Stevie Wonder, is delicious
ear candy.
 If movies were rated on the 100-point scale "American
Bandstand" used to use for records, "High Fidelity" would probably score
a 50: It doesn't have much of a beat and you can't really dance to it,
but it's way better than that new Celine Dion disc. James Sanford

Boyish, commitment-shy thirtysomething Rob Gordon (John Cusack) stares at the
screen and ponders, "Did I listen to pop music because I was miserable, or
was I miserable because I listened to pop music?" And so begins "High
Fidelity," directed by Stephen Frears (1988's "Dangerous Liasons") and based
on the 1995 novel by Nick Hornby (which was set in London; the film in
Chicago). Such a statement might come off as a throwaway one-liner, but
through the course of the picture, it gradually grows to hold far more
substance and truth than expected. An alternately insightful and uneasily
thin-skinned look at relationships and true love, "High Fidelity" appears as
if half the film was written by a screenwriter full of talent and
intelligence, while the other scenes sprinkled throughout were penned by a
hack who has never been in a relationship, or doesn't care to bring such
veracity to the screen, just as long as he or she is receiving a sizable
paycheck.
Rob, who has owned a vintage record store called Championship Vinyl for
several years, has been through more romances with women than he cares to
count, but no matter what, something always seems to get in the way of things
working out. Rob is clueless as to what the problem might be, but he grows
increasingly curious when his most recent long-time girlfriend, Laura (Iben
Hjejle), leaves him and moves in with a womanizing hippie named Ian (Tim
Robbins). Rob speaks directly to the screen for a large portion of its
running time, and he triumphantly concludes when Laura leaves that she didn't
even make his Top 5 Break-Ups List. Everything is a Top 5 List for Rob and
his two coworkers, the surly, robustly sarcastic Barry (Jack Black), and the
introverted, lonely Dick (Todd Louiso), and Rob sulks in his latest loss
while he has flashbacks of his ex-flames from the past (including Catherine
Zeta-Jones, Lili Taylor, and Joelle Carter). Through it all, Rob is
determined to find out why fate has lent him such a discouraging romantic
hand in life, until the moment when he inevitably discovers it has nothing to
do with fate, and everything to do with himself. Oh, and he grudgingly must
finally admit that Laura does, in fact, make his Top 5 List on the most
painful break-ups.
Written by John Cusack, D.V. DeVincentis, and Steve Pink (the same team who
brought us 1997's "Grosse Pointe Blank"), "High Fidelity" holds the same
basic unevenness and dissatisfaction as their previous endeavor, despite
clearly knowing how to write fresh dialogue. The problem with their
screenplay is not in its details, but in its outline, which may hold a few
perceptive ideas, but is brought down by its overall feelings of deja vu in
the plot department, as well as in its severe mishandling of the wide array
of characters.
Arriving on the film's second, and most notable, quandary, "High Fidelity"
has been cast, for no apparent reason, almost top to bottom with familiar
faces and stars, and then chooses to do nothing with them. Had the
inconsequential supporting roles been filled by relative unknowns, this whole
predicament might have been solved, but when a film completely wastes the
talent of such exuberant actors, one must put blame on (1) the director, in
this case Stephen Frears; (2) the sloppy, often aimless screenplay; and (3)
the film as a whole, because you simply can't believe a movie would include
Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lili Taylor, Tim Robbins, Joan Cusack, Lisa Bonet, Sara
Gilbert, and Natasha Gregson Wagner, among others, only to throw them into
the bedroom corner, left to hang out with the dust bunnies. The major cutting
of particular characters, with the considerable rewriting of the rest of
them, would have benefitted this film significantly, making the whole
undertaking seem far more satisfying and not such a missed opportunity.
In a role he was born to play, John Cusack fully embodies the heart, soul,
and skin of Rob Gordon. Cusack, of the puppy-dog-eyes ilk, believably
exhibits Rob's oscillating desperation, his passion of music, his childish
bravado. What the film fails to do, however, no fault of Cusack's
performance, is get us to care about Rob as a person, or become involved in
his lovelorn plight. Without his complete likability, which the picture
relies vitally on to be successful, the much-needed rooting interest factor
of the story is nonexistent.
Iben Hjejle, a Danish actress making her U.S. film debut here, equips herself
with a dead-ringer American accent, and is, overall, very good, easily more
effective than most foreign actors who give America a try, and fail (Virginie
Ledoyen, of "The Beach," anyone?). Hjejle handles several subtle sequences in
the latter half with impressionable aplomb and realism, especially one near
the end in which Rob does something she never thought he would do. It must be
noted, however, how odd it is that the one major female role has gone to a
basic unknown, while the bigger stars are left hanging from the rafters--or,
for film review purists, still playing with the dust bunnies in the corner.
Finally, the only other major roles have been handed to the marvelously funny
Jack Black, and Todd Louiso, who, coincidentally, is more likable than Rob,
and whose potentially warm-hearted subplot in which he unexpectedly romances
a pretty, young customer named Anaugh (Sara Gilbert) is almost completely
disregarded. As for the rest of the ill-fated cast, Catherine Zeta-Jones is
entertaining, yet painfully shallow as Break-Up #3, the gorgeous Charlie
Nicholson, who, Rob says, "was way out of my league." Lili Taylor, as
Break-Up #4, the unlucky-in-love, desperate Sarah, might have been able to
add some poignancy to the proceedings, had her one big scene been written
with more care, rather than have been the rush job that it disappointingly
is. Lisa Bonet is surprisingly good as alluring club singer Marie DeSalle,
whom Rob has a one-time affair with after Laura moves out, but she exits the
picture too soon. Joan Cusack, as Rob and Laura's friend, Liz, offers the
same lightness of being that she always is able to bring to a film, but has
nothing to do, while the less said about Tim Robbins' embarrassing cameo, the
better. Finally, Natasha Gregson Wagner is truly fetching as Caroline, who
shows up late in the picture as a music columnist for a Chicago-based
magazine who briefly catches Rob's fancy. Wagner shows such promising signs,
in fact, that it was a shame to see her be slighted, like everyone else, with
a criminally underwritten character.
Since "High Fidelity" has just as much to do with music as it does with love,
it has been inhabited from the first scene to the last with familiar, and
not-so-familiar, tunes that span at least three or four decades.
Unfortunately, so much care has been contributed to the soundtrack that
director Frears has forgotten about the importance of the film itself. By the
conclusion, Rob has learned a great deal about himself, and about his
character flaws, to the point where he finally is able to assuredly enter
into a relationship with maturity and recently obtained wisdom. It's too bad
Frears didn't understand the title better; this film desperately needed
higher fidelity to be a movie worth seeing.

It's been several days since we saw HIGH FIDELITY - longer than I usually 
take to write about a film - but its feel is still with me.  Director 
Stephen Frears has put together an engaging piece about two big subjects, 
love and music, and the result is the best film released yet this year.
John Cusack gets credit as a screenwriter, along with D. V. DeVincentis, 
Steve Pink and Scott Rosenberg.  Cusack is also the film's star; his 
character, Rob Gordon, owns Championship Vinyl, a quirky and eclectic music 
store in a Chicago neighborhood you wouldn't want to be caught in after 
dark.  This set is by far the most fun in the story; when the script locates 
us here, we watch the characters' true selves emerge.  Perhaps the film's 
success is ensured by the store and everything surrounding it.  It functions 
both as a meeting place and as a source of a surefire premise: theme and 
variations on romance.
Rob Gordon takes center stage by giving us a top-five list of breakups that 
gnaw at him the most.  Hence we watch clever flashbacks of Rob from the time 
he is fourteen and kissing a girl in the school playground, to the time of 
his most recent heartbreak, the present, his lover Laura (Iben Hjejle) 
having just left.  It takes Rob awhile to admit that Laura's moving her 
things to the upstairs apartment of an aging New Ager - Ian Raymond, who's 
played by Tim Robbins - is devastating enough to belong on this short list.  
But quickly we realize Rob's preoccupation with the topic emphasizes that 
this is the worst his heart has felt, ever.
When Cusack addresses the camera, it's a cool form of authorial intrusion, 
dear reader.  His character comes off as endlessly self-reflexive, the 
post-modern malaise dripping from his monologues and casual clothes.  His 
various sundered relationships come off as funny and touching, and you know 
things really get moving when he gets to the just-out number five on the 
list of all-time heartaches, the lissome Laura.  Really Cusack is brilliant 
in his nonchalance.  Whether talking to his audience or to his eccentric 
cadre of friends, he flashes wit and humanity, and we end up liking him, 
even if he seems the eternal child-man.
Cusack's acting is matched by the acting of Jack Black and Todd Louiso, who 
play Barry and Dick, clerks in Championship Vinyl.  They began as 
part-timers and now Rob can't get them to stop coming in every day.  
Clearly, they need lives, and what's neat is that by the end of the story, 
they are closer to getting lives.  Louiso, a Cincinnati native, is 
especially good:  low-key and slow-talking, he exudes a deep compassion 
belied by shyness.  I would tune in every week if there were a show starring 
these two music geeks.
Iben Hjejle is fine as Laura, perhaps overly calm is spots, but sympathetic 
and smooth.  The script treats her well, calling for a peak of emotions late 
in the story.
Frears uses a strong supporting cast.  Besides Black and Louiso, there's 
Cusack's sister Joan, who plays Liz, a friend of Laura and odd confidante of 
Rob.  Though Joan Cusack has a hard time not being funny, her role here 
calls for a more serious turn, a sort of go-between in the edgy romance 
between Rob and Laura.
As one of Rob's former girlfriends, Charlie, Catherine Zeta-Jones plays a 
bright but very superficial woman.  And Lisa Bonet ably helps the story 
achieve another of its points about love: there is an incredible amount of 
amorality out there.
Another main character is the music.  The songs played in the store, Rob's 
apartment, bars and other locales serve not only as background but as 
characterization.  When Barry is not allowed to play the tape of 
Monday-morning songs he's compiled, he takes it as a serious offense.  Even 
the title plays off the theme of fidelity - or faithfulness - making the 
piece directly about love and the loyal that is a clear sign of it.
HIGH FIDELITY is rated R for language and sexuality, essentially unnecessary 
tidbits of sex scenes.  I wouldn't take anyone under 16.  I suspect the film 
will have a wide audience, as the musical styles appeal to many generations 
of taste, and of course the love themes engage the owners of hearts of any 
age.

Vista. 113 minutes. R (language)
The astute title "High Fidelity" has many meanings. The music is 
pre-hip hop or rap. The characters entranced by vinyl albums (when 
not critical of them) are Generation Xers who cult-ivate (sic) the 
sounds of their adolescence. It's fitting, because they are in a 
state of suspended youth even though the age of the 
principals-on-screen is about the same as the age of the 
principals-in-life. John Cusack was born in 1966, Jack Black in 1969, 
etc.
Rob (Cusack) owns and vaguely runs Championship Vinyl, a store of 
used records on a Chicago street that gets little pedestrian traffic. 
He has two employees. They were hired for three days a week but are 
there all the time,which tells you something about their passion for 
certain kinds of music and their nonexistent private life or other 
interests. The store looks well-stocked with records but is woefully 
un-stocked with customers. How it and its three people survive, how 
the stuff is bought, how rent, taxes or utilities are paid is a 
mystery. But the movie, like its characters, is above such mundane 
considerations.
It is, however, an excellent filmization of a popular book, and a 
seamlessly credible transposition to Chicago of the original novel's 
setting in London. Many, often lengthy passages of the book's text 
are quoted. The trick is to have Rob address directly the audience. 
No stinting here.
What gets the whole thing going is that Rob's longtime live-in 
girlfriend Laura (Danish actress Iben Hjejle) suddenly fed up with 
his messiness, immaturity, lingering childishness and other such 
characteristics, walks out on him.
The store's male trio are music-on-vinyl geeks. "Geeks" falls on some 
people's ears with a negative connotation. But then some geeks can be 
endearing. They may be living in a strange world of their own, but at 
least they have a passion for something, be this computers, toy 
trains, stamp collecting, dancing... the list is endless. The three 
men's musical knowledge is encyclopedic. Rejoice, geeks in the 
audience! You can hear some 60 songs, though mostly in excerpts.
The Championship Three are idiosyncratic. Bulky Barry combines a 
haughty attitude of Papal infallibility in pop music matters,with 
rude intolerance for tastes he does not share. Fragile, mumbling, 
timid, bald-pated Dick is a masculine wallflower. Moody Rob seems to 
be in a semi-trance-like state which melds indifference,worries, 
whining and self-irony. The trio, especially the two helpers, judge 
people by their musical tastes. It's like "tell me what you like and 
I'll tell who you are and if I'll like you" -- a valid criterion in 
many situations.
What all those men share is the mania for making lists of the top 
five albums in categories that range from life, love and death to 
abstruse topics.
Laura's departure triggers in Rob a flood of self-centered questions. 
His thoughts in the book become in the movie direct addresses to the 
audience. And the listomania makes him create his own top five worst 
breakups with the women in his life. Supplemented by voice-overs, his 
speeches are a messy mass of analyses, self-pity, puzzlements, alibis 
but also self-criticisms in which he does not spare himself. All are 
beautifully done, amusing rather than pathetic, indeed often 
hilarious. They alternate between lucidity, myopia, good and bad 
faith, and are illustrated by compact, colorful flasbacks of his 
romances, from his teens onwards.
Rob's tales of his amorous discomfitures are briefly interrupted by a 
one-night stand with singer Lisa Bonet. It does not light the man's 
lantern of self-knowledge but he does gain confidence. In 
entertaining sequences he  visits old flames who tell him (I forget 
if it is in some cases or all) that he was the one who broke up the 
affairs. This is followed by a temporarily renewed relationship with 
one ex, a recently jilted neurotic.
What Rob wants most is Laura's return. She has moved in with a New 
Age legal guru (Tim Robbins) who specializes in resolving conflicts. 
This adds to the film's ironies, as Rob is trying to resolve his own 
conflicts. His talking to the viewers is a form of "I am my own 
shrink," but then, self-surgery is no easy process.
I cannot divulge what happens next, but one does suspect that there 
is no   true closure since Rob is not a leopard that can change his 
spots. It does not take reading between the lines either to realize 
that by higher standards, none of Rob's girls was interesting enough, 
and neither was Rob. He deserved whatever he got. Laura however is a 
cut above the rest and gets more vignettes than the others.
The movie rests overwhelmingly on Cusack's shoulders, even though 
Todd Louiso's and Jack Black's very well played weirdoes, bring fresh 
comic relief. It is more than a film with Cusack, it 's a Cusack 
film, with  It has the same genuinely maverick, 
absurdist-realistic-humorous ambiance as the previous all-Cusack 
"Grosse Pointe Blank."  Of the four scenarists of each movie, three 
are the same in both. In those pictures,as well as in others, a 
variety of Cusack personae emerge, often different from one another 
yet with a base of effortless likeability that makes the low-key 
actor stand out. He stays with you the way  high-key Jack Nicholson 
or Dustin Hoffman do --and far more than most performers of Cusack's 
age group.
The breaking of the Fourth Wall (Cusack's direct speeches to us) is 
handled with convincing efficiency. The device can be dangerous, 
precious or annoyingly artificial. It worked well with Michael Caine 
in "Alfie" (1966) which for many people was the first movie to use 
this approach. But it already existed, as in olden days, funny 
movie-shorts, especially Robert Benchley's "lectures." In Jean-Luc 
Godard's innovative  "Breathless" (1959)   actor Belmondo very 
briefly speaks directly to us, and so on.
This brings me to my wondering whether or not there are Godardian 
influences here. The Frenchman's films overflow with questions spoken 
by their characters. Ultimately we get Godard himself thinking aloud. 
There are other whiffs of Godard, especially Rob's early "Did I 
listen to pop music because I was miserable, or was I miserable 
because I listened to pop music?" This very pattern abounds in 
Godard's paradoxes.
The movie is, after "The Grifters" (USA, 1990), Cusack's  second 
collaboration with British director Stephen Frears. Frears knows how 
to bring characters to life, how not to mess up scripts or interfere 
with his actors' talents. In England, his first dozen pictures and 
several later ones  were TV productions moved rapidly to theaters. 
This no doubt played a major role in Frears's sense of economy of 
budget, story-telling and construction. Subsequent titles  include 
"The Hit,' "My Beautiful Laundrette," "Sammy and Rosie Get Laid,""The 
Snapper," and in the U.S "Dangerous Liaisons," "Hero."
"High Fidelity" proves that Cusack and Frears were made for each 
other. More, more!

Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.
     At first glance, there's every reason to believe John Cusack is the
ideal cast for Rob Gordon, the protagonist of HIGH FIDELITY. A single,
likeable, somewhat directionless guy in his early 30s, Rob spends his days
hawking the archaic music format of vinyl in his shop Championship Vinyl,
then spends his nights obsessing over his failed relationships. Throughout
HIGH FIDELITY, Rob narrates his story directly to the audience, describing
his troubles with his soon-to-be-latest-ex Laura (Iben Hjejle) and Laura's
place in his catalog of break-up stories. Few actors could pull off the
amount of narration required of Rob without becoming instantly annoying; 
even fewer could make self-absorption somewhat sympathetic. 
     So why does Cusack seem ever-so-slightly wrong in a role that should
be so right? It's not the sharp comic setting crafted by director Stephen
Frears and a team of four writers (adapting Nick Hornby's novel). That
setting finds Rob and his co-workers Barry (Jack Black) and Dick (Todd
Louiso) holding court in Championship Vinyl, mocking customers for their
lack of musical acumen and exchanging Top Five lists of best songs in
detailed categories (e.g., Top Five Side-One, Song-One Tracks). Cusack is
fine as the saner center, but his co-stars are superb. Black's Barry is an
aggressive, abrasive pedant who delights in the power of dispensing arcana
or withholding a rare record; Louiso's Dick is a portrait in awed fan-geek
deference. When the Championship crew is rattling off obscure band
influences or rattling customers with their disdain, HIGH FIDELITY finds
its highest energy.
     It's not the focus on Rob's relationship history, either. Rob
recounts his woman woes in search of a pattern to his failed love affairs,
allowing for some great moments of comic humiliation (and a couple of
priceless fantasy sequences). It also allows for a parade of familiar
faces in extended cameos: Tim Robbins as Laura's other man; Lili Taylor as
one needy ex; Catherine Zeta-Jones as another, more intimidating ex; even
Bruce Springsteen pops up to offer advice. The gimmicky casting is
occasionally distracting, but not so much so that it overwhelms the
strengths of the individual episodes. There's even some charming wisdom in
HIGH FIDELITY's acknowledgement that middle school make-out sessions can
stay with you for life, or that a skillfully made mix tape can speak from
the heart.
     No, the one key problem with an otherwise thoroughly entertaining
film is that Cusack's screen persona is just too ... nice. Rob is a
somewhat unreliable narrator, since it is gradually revealed that he's
caused just as much emotional damage as has been done to him. One breakup
inspired by his own sexual frustration has morphed in his mind into the
woman's fault; he acknowledges having cheated on Laura while they were
together; he sleeps with a singer (Lisa Bonet) even as he's fuming over
Laura's involvement with another man while they're separated. Combine his
romantic irresponsibility with his musical snobbery, and you've got a
character that should be played with more jerkish, immature edge. With
Cusack, the nice guy is too dominant. Rob's confessions -- which should
have played as calculated attempts to win us to his side -- feel more like
guileless soul-baring coming from Cusack's mouth. And they never quite
feel right.
     In the end, Rob learns some valuable lessons and starts to grow up a
little. It's only then that you can feel enthusiastic about wishing for
Rob's happiness. HIGH FIDELITY's sharp wit could have made up for a
multitude of sins, when in fact it only has to make up for one; there's
more than enough quality film-making to weigh in the film's favor. There's
also that nagging realiation that Rob's not the good-natured hero we all
want him to be when John Cusack is playing the part. Cusack has proven
himself to be a talented, versatile actor, but there's a guy we've come to
know and love in off-beat romantic comedies like THE SURE THING, SAY
ANYTHING and GROSSE POINTE BLANK, and it's hard not to listen to  Cusack
reveal personal traumas without expecting that guy. Even when HIGH 
FIDELITY is at its most inspired, you can tell that Rob Gordon isn't that
guy.

John Cusack as Rob Gordon, is a neurotic, 30-something year old who
hasn't grown up. He is the Chicago record store owner of Championship
Vinyl, carrying CD's and vinyl lp's for musical connoisseurs, in a small
store that is barely surviving. This wormy role is one that he has been
seemingly typecast for in most of his films to date. His narcissistic
performance totally grossed-me out, even though I liked a few things
about this feel-good, quirky movie, but whose plot could have been
better explored if it was discovered what the plot was and whose story
would have been given more credence if it had a sharper script, a better
sense of pacing, and less screen time for the annoying Cusack character.
Cusack spent nearly ninety percent of the film's time looking right at
the camera and explaining to the audience what he was thinking and
doing, as if the story was made for an Einstein-type and needed to be
decifered to the under-thirty something audience targeted to see this
film.
Rob is griping to the camera about his failures in romance, and in
imitation of the David Letterman's TV show shtick of making lists to
elicit laughs from the audience, Rob is prone to making Top 5 lists,
having recently completed his "Top 5 all-time breakups", going through
those he most clearly recalls, giving the audience a running narration
on each of those romances. He starts with a junior high school kissing
marathon in the baseball field's bleachers with Allison (Stillo), that
lasted six hours, before he was dumped for another boy. Next he
reminisces about the sexy Charlie (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who can't stop
talking and saying inane things, which he found amusing at the time, as
he wondered why someone as stunning as she is would go out with him.
Then there is Penny (Carter), someone who won't give him sex, so he
dumps her. There is also his breakup with the sweet Sarah (Lili Taylor).
By gosh, what is this fine comedic actress doing in this film, and to
the bargain, taking such a miniscule part!
Even though, he can't quite admit it yet, his present breakup might be
the hardest one for him to recover from, since his lawyer girlfriend
might be the one he was always looking for. Laura (Iben Hjejle-a Danish
actress making her American debut) is the best thing about this film.
Her lips are of a succulent ruby red color, and when she pouts or a
small smile comes over her, there is a very sensuous crease that comes
over her mouth and chin area-- plus she has a nice laugh and cries in a
dignified manner when she has to. She stops being Rob's live-in lover as
the film opens, moving out of his music-fanatic decorated pad, because
he's a drip, has no ambition, and failed to commit to her. She moves in
with the upstair's neighbor, Ian (Tim Robbins), who is another drip,
though of the "new age" type, who does crises intervention therapy, and
is adorned with earrings and a ponytail.
What the film does well, is capture the nostalgia and musty atmosphere
of a place where music geeks hang-out, memorizing tunes and reciting
them back-and-forth to each other, as if they were idiot savants who
overdosed on sugar. The picture is stolen by the two snobbish musical
clerks who inhabit Rob's store as if it were the Vatican of the music
world, and those not up to snuff with their elitist thinking on musical
taste are snubbed by them. Jack Black is Barry, the more hostile and
comically inclined of the two, who is a burst of loudness in the dead
sea of music trivia. He's a Van Morrison clone without the singer's
voice or forebearance or manners. His other partner and fellow expert in
pop culture music, is the more timid but equally snobbish, Dick (Todd
Louiso). Without these two, you wouldn't have had a film about music
geeks--but a film about a monologue of Cusack talking to Cusack,
interupted only when he talks to the other Cusack in the film, his
sister. The clerks' attitude toward the customers was brusque, but the
exchanges that resulted were very dear. In one encounter, with a
middle-aged man wanting to buy for his daughter's birthday Stevie
Wonder's "I Just Called to Say I Love You", Barry disapproves the
choice, telling the would-be customer that they have the record but he
won't sell it to him, that he should go to the mall: "That the only way
his daughter would like that song, is if she were in a coma."
In keeping with the spirit of the film, I made a Top 5 list of things I
liked about the film and a more involved Top 5 list of things that I
didn't like about the film.
First what I liked: 1. The soundtrack kicked ass. 2. The two musical
geek clerks were funnier than Batman and Robin in hell. 3. I didn't have
to pronounce Iben Hjejle's name to know what I liked about her. 4. Lisa
Bonet made up for her inconsequential part and gratuitous sex scene by
adding a beautiful song to the film and a warm presence to a story that
wasn't that hot to begin with. 5. I can count on my left hand how many
films were made about geek music-store clerks who work in musical stores
that are not in a mall.
What I didn't like: 1. John Cusack is either a putz or someone who is
acting like a putz, but in either case, I can't handle watching a
needlessly long film (over two hours) such as this one, with someone as
self-absorbed as he is, without getting a headache. 2. The story seemed
to be a never-ending one, where there were at least three times that I
thought the movie had wound down and was about to conclude. Instead, the
movie got a second wind and added more banal storyline to keep it going.
It seemed to be poorly edited and written with a few different endings
in mind and failed to make its rewrites seamless. The result is a very
shoddy film, even if it is adapted from a popular cult comic novel of
the same name written by Nick Hornsby. The film has not been improved by
changing the setting from London to Chicago, and as far as I'm
concerned, it could have been set in Mars or Venus, with the same
results gleaned. 3. The love angle was predictable and wimpy. I couldn't
stand to see Cusack begging and carrying on to worm his way back into
the relationship with Laura. I was rooting for him, against all odds, to
be left out in the cold and rain by the end of the movie without a
girlfriend. But this was formula sitcom stuff all the way, as all three
music geeks got some reward for their long-suffering for the art of
nostalgia and trivia and useless knowledge. Barry got a band together
and, my main man, Dick, he got himself a girlfriend, and of course,
Cusack, he got the first prize, Iben. 4. For a movie that is about
growing up, maturing, and handling relationships, somehow the characters
didn't particularly make me interested in how any of their relationships
were resolved. 5. I felt used by this film. They made me listen to
Cusack go into his heavy neurotic spiel, pretending to be a loser, while
all the time he was really an insensitive manipulator of women, who was
sneaky in getting his way with all the women he went out with. And I had
to listen to him kvetch for the entire film and I'm not even a
psychoanalyst who gets paid to hear such dribble but a long-suffering
movie critic who was bored to death by this very forgettable pop culture
movie and couldn't wait for the session (uh! movie) to end.

     There's nothing more annoying than a music geek.  You know, the
kind of guy who hangs out in record stores reminiscing about Camper Van
Beethoven, Stereolab, and the roots of Green Day.
     As such, a movie full of music geeks may seem a little unbearable,
and in a lot of ways, HIGH FIDELITY is.  That it manages to often redeem
itself is the biggest surprise in the movie, and not for the reasons you
might think.
     Let's start out with what doesn't work.  For starters, purist fans
of Nick Hornby's novel will be disappointed to find their favorite
record store moved from England to Chicago.  John Cusack's Rob is, of
course, not British -- he's a typical Yank with a perpetually broken
heart.  Rob spends much (or all) of the film narrating to the screen, as
if the moviegoer is in the room with him, wherever he goes.  This gets
old, awfully fast, quickly losing its charm and becoming obvious as a
crutch used to mask lazy, sloppy writing.
     Rob is also as shallow as they come.  He lives his life like a
Billboard chart.  Everything is a "top five," and the movie centers
around his current girlfriend Laura (the fittingly unknown Iben Hjejle
-- her real name!) leaving him, thus entering the charts as his #5
Heartbreaker.
     The problem isn't really Rob's shallowness; it's that Laura turns
out to be pretty worthless as well.  Hjejle clearly has no chemistry
with Cusack, and her character has no redeeming qualities either except
that "she smells good."  (And you have to take Cusack's word on that.)
On the road to getting Laura back, Rob visits the rest of the top 5
heartbreakers -- including Catherine Zeta-Jones and Lili Taylor, but
nothing really comes of this.  The song of Rob's life remains utterly
the same.  (There's even an inexplicable fling with Lisa Bonet of "The
Cosby Show" fame, particularly ironic since the 80's standard is mocked
elsewhere in the film.)
     Fortunately, throw Jack Black (best known as Matthew Broderick's
friend in THE CABLE GUY) into any of the above scenes and it becomes a
laugh riot.  You will forget about the rest of the movie (think EMPIRE
RECORDS grown up) when Black struts his stuff.  The man should kill Adam
Sandler and takeover his life as a real comedian.  Demure newcomer Todd
Louiso, like Black an employee in Rob's record store, provides excellent
counterpoint to Black's over-the-top character.  Literally, the scenes
in Rob's store are so funny they make you forget about the rest of the
film.
     A hilarious supporting role by a pony-tailed Tim Robbins
notwithstanding, that "rest of the film" is pretty much a drag.  It's
uniformly shallow and vapid, and the reliance on Hjejle (imagine Mia
Farrow with a bad haircut and a language barrier) to carry a lead role
was a fatal error for HIGH FIDELITY's producers.  All the talk of
avant-garde bands may make you envious of the boundless musical
knowledge these guys possess.  Or, like me, you may just want to skip to
the tracks you like.

I read High Fidelity several months ago in anticipation of its
theatrical release.  While the best-selling Gen X novel was certainly a
good read, I couldn't envision it being made into film - a film worth
watching, anyway.  There really isn't any action, and it's pretty light
on dialogue, instead focusing on the rambling thoughts of its
romantically challenged main character.  I figured there was two ways to
handle this in a screen adaptation:  Either use a voice-over to show
what the character is thinking, or replace what he's thinking with
additional dialogue and action not found in the novel.
Imagine my surprise at the first scene, where protagonist Rob Gordon is
delivering his lines right into the camera.  `Jesus,' I thought, `this
is going to be really annoying for two hours.'  But the narrations
actually grew on me.  Fidelity is lucky to have cast John Cusack (Being
John Malkovich), who may be the only actor in the world that could pull
off this role.  It probably didn't hurt that Cusack also produced and
co-wrote the film, tailoring it to meet both his splendid comic timing
and hangdog vulnerability (read: sad puppy-dog eyes).  Fidelity is an
unqualified hit and, although it's way too early to be saying this,
might be one of the better films you'll see all year.
Formerly a successful club DJ, Cusack's thirty-something Rob is now the
owner of a struggling record shop called Championship Vinyl, which is
located off the beaten path in downtown Chicago.  His two employees,
Barry and Dick (Jack Black, Enemy of the State; and Todd Louiso, Eight
Heads in a Duffel Bag), are the type of elitist record geeks that mock
you to your face if you can't tell the difference between an original
pressing and a reissue of an obscure Frank Zappa album.  But Rob
tolerates it because he's a bit of a musical snob, as well.  The three
busy themselves by compiling Top 5 lists that cover everything from the
all-time best death songs to the greatest Monday morning songs.  And be
warned  expect the more jug-headed critics to begin their reviews with
a `Top Five Reasons I Loved/Hated This Movie' list.
The film actually opens with Rob listing his desert-island, all-time,
top five most memorable split-ups, which are then shown in flashbacks
over the first third of the film.  He's recently been jilted by live-in
lover Laura (Iben Hjejle, Mifune  this is her first English-speaking
role) and begins to contact all of his old exes in an attempt to
pinpoint the exact cause of his inability to maintain relationships with
members of the opposite sex.  This quest, together with Rob's bizarre
need to reorganize his massive record collection in times of crisis,
make up the bulk of the film.
Aside from changing the setting of the film from London to Chicago,
Fidelity stays extremely faithful to its source.  Most of the lines are
taken verbatim from the book, which was written by Nick Hornby, who also
penned the soccer novel Fever Pitch, the film of which saw limited
release in 1999.  Ironically, the only thing British in the film (other
than some behind-the-camera talent) is Catherine Zeta-Jones, who plays
one of Rob's exes.  And everyone think she's Hispanic (she's Welsh).  My
only complaint is that `book' Rob would have hated most of the bands
that `movie' Rob was into.  He had a Bush poster on the wall of his
apartment, for God's sake.  I think that may even be illegal in England
- and if it isn't, it should be.
Perhaps the greatest thing about Fidelity is its uncanny ability to make
viewers point out old albums that they've owned during interior shots of
Rob's record store.  Oh, there goes that King Crimson bootleg that I
just bought on eBay for $50.  Hey, there's the first Hanoi Rocks record
that my sister crayoned all over.  I saw people literally pointing at
the screen in awe that these records existed anywhere but in their own
personal collections.
Also noteworthy is the wildly kinetic performance of Jack Black, who
steals every scene he's in.  This role could make him into the new
Philip Seymour Hoffman.  There is a surprise cameo (musical, of course)
and the closing credits are fantastic, showing the names of the film's
participants on concert handbills.  Fidelity was directed by Stephen
Frears (The Hi-Lo Country) and adapted from Hornby's novel by Cusack and
his Grosse Pointe Blank collaborators D.V. DeVincentis and Steve Pink,
as well as ConAir's Scott Rosenberg.  Their film is obviously a
carefully crafted labor of love that should be a big hit with everyone,
especially if you were born in the 1960s or 70s, still own a turntable
or ever worked in a record store.

Ingrid, Renee, Jackie, Stephanie, Susan. Those names I can rattle off my mind
like shards of lightning, and they are at the top five of my list of breakups
in my life. And so I could identify with Rob Gordon's unique ability to not
only remember the names of past loves and the extent of their relationships,
but to also know which pop/rock and roll songs were playing at the time,
exclusively on vinyl. Music is an identifiable factor for me too, and for my
sweet miseries of the past, it includes Huey Lewis and the News performing
"Small World" in 1988 and "Shakedown" by Bob Seger from the summer of 1987. For
Rob, it includes a different era of Fleetwood Mac and Paper Lace, and that is
at the heart of Stephen Frears's delicately oddball romantic comedy "High
Fidelity," which is more oddball comedy than romantic but it delivers all three
in nearly equal doses and that is part of its charm.
Based on Nick Hornsby's 1995 cult novel of the same name, John Cusack plays the
record-loving Rob who owns a small Bohemian-like record shop in Chicago called
Championship Vinyl, which specializes in selling records wrapped in plastic
(vinyl has not lost its touch since it is still sold in record shops,
especially in New York City or Princeton, N.J.). Rob speaks directly to the
camera, ruminating on his past top five breakups, most recently Laura (Iben
Hjehle), while giving us the pop history of each breakup - the song that played
and where it played as a reminder of that misery. Or as Rob puts it, "I don't
remember if I was miserable when I listened to pop music or if listening to pop
music made me miserable." 
Laura has left Rob's pad but he loves her too much to just let go. She lives
with a sexual hippie (hilariously portrayed by Tim Robbins) who is a
martial-arts master. We get more than a few scenes of Rob dripping wet like a
madman in the rain while calling Laura from outside her new home - this almost
seems like an extension of the classic "Say Anything" by director Cameron Crowe
that also starred Cusack. All Rob has left in his life, minus Laura, is his
record store and two employees, the geeky, apologetic Dick (Todd Luiso) and the
musically encyclopedic, irascible Barry (Jack Black) who is ticked off by
anyone who does not share his music tastes. I love the moment when they discuss
"Evil Dead 2" and its "great soundtrack" or Barry's recommendation to use "You
Can't Always Get What You Want" at Laura's father's funeral:
Dick: 'That is an immediate disqualification on the grounds of it being used in
"The Big Chill".'
Besides his listless life without Laura, Rob is a part-time DJ and briefly beds
a sexy singer (Lisa Bonet) who shares Rob's lovelorn disappointments and sings
Peter Frampton songs. And we get glimpses of Rob's obsession over his past
loves, shown in brief flashbacks. He is so obsessed that he arranges to meet
all five and figure out why he has failed them. Most memorable of these
ex-girlfriends include Lili Taylor as an unhappy yet sometimes cheerful woman
(only Lili can credibly play such a part) and Catherine Zeta-Jones as a rich,
wild woman who is confused by Rob's need to explain why she left him. 
"High Fidelity" is familiar turf, a lot of is reminiscent of some of the best
parts of "Singles," one of my favorite comedies of the 90's. Still, thanks to
director Stephen Frears's offbeat direction and Scott Rosenberg and Cusack's
writing, the laughs come in with terrific precision, mainly due to Cusack's
dead-on, quirky line readings. The cast is richly entertaining to watch,
including the histrionic, energetic Jack Black, and a marvelous Joan Cusack as
Rob's friend who is shocked to discover how Rob treated Laura thanks to Laura.
I also enjoyed the presence of Hjejle - for once in these comedies, a real
human being of the opposite sex shows how deeply hurt she is by a man's
transgressions. Though the film loses momentum in the last half hour building
to the predictable final act with Laura, "High Fidelity" has oodles of charm
and a consistently jerky funny bone. It's uneven, like Cusack, but you expected
that.

   Go to movies like "Boiler Room," "American Psycho," and
"Keeping the Faith" and you get the impression that all
twenty-somethings in America have taken jobs with important
corporate firms or have become leaders in fields like religion
and law.  But walk the streets of any city and you'll see a
landscape dotted with hundreds, maybe thousands of small
stores, each catering to specific needs of the citizens who
patronize them and who may never see the inside chambers
of huge establishments.  Because these stores are operated
by people who are either too independent to work for others,
or who lacking specific types of education, or who are fairly
new to the country, you are likely to fund proprietors and their
associates who are quirky, who have personalities different
from those who wear pin-striped suits, are addicted to cell
phones, and may not give much of a damn about the
concerns of their supervisors.
   "High Fidelity" is a whimsical film that captures the
temperament of some of these small retail people,
knowledgeable about their product, often so passionate about
what they sell that they may prefer discussing their
commodity with their customers to taking their money.  The
movie is helmed by British director Stephen Frears with
loving attention to its principal character and is based on a
popular cult novel published in the UK in 1995 by Nick
Hornby.  The story focuses on an attractive fellow, Rob
Gordon (John Cusack), who frequently breaks away from his
exchanges with lovers, customers, and fellow workers to talk
directly to the camera, as though he were performing in a
Shakespearean play.  You may get impression--as I did--that
Rob's role could not have been better cast; that no one other
than John Cusack could have pulled off Rob's idiosyncratic
nature as a man of about thirty who obsesses so regularly
about his past loves that he fails to pay sufficient concern for
the women who rightfully demand his attention.  =
   Effectively, with quiet humor and restrained command,
director Frears guides Cusack into a series delicate
recollections from the times he tries to make out at school
parties through his more grounded affairs with a succession
of good-looking women.  The film opens on Rob and his
current live-in woman, Laura (Iben Hjejle), just as Laura is
packed up, moving out, and ending her liaison with Rob.
   In a meandering way that could alienate a young audience
accustomed to MTV, action pictures, and broad comedy,
"High Fidelity" takes us inside Rob's failing record business in
one of Chicago's scruffy, arty neighborhoods, Seamus
McGarvey's camera content to spend a good deal of time
among the retro product found in abundance throughout the
store.  Rob specializes in vinyl records of pop music
exclusively, his two workers, Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry
(Jack Black) happy to spend twice the time therein than they
were hired to do.  Frears milks a good deal of the comedy
from these two characters who are so opposite in
temperament (Dick is a scholarly introvert while Barry is feisty
and opinionated) that we wonder how they get along so well. =
While Dick quietly discusses the music with the relatively few
customers--including a band of hip, neighborhood
skateboarders who occasionally shovel material
surreptitiously under the shirts and pants--Barry elects to
insult the squares.  In the movie's most mirthful exchange,
Barry tells a middle-aged guy who wants to buy "I Just Called
to Say I Love You" where to get off with such sugary pap,
suggesting, "Do you even know your daughter?"
   This lovely comedy never overstays its welcome, getting
blustery on only one occasion as Rob fantasies beating the
hell out of his lost love's current beau, Ian (Tim Robbins), an
unctuous, pony-tailed professional in the field of conflict
resolution whose ears are pierced and decorated with three
rings.  As Rob's parade of lovers and near-liaisons, Frears
parades a group of attractive women such as Marie DeSalle
(Lisa Bonet), who delivers in the vocal department, and
Penny (Joelle Carter).  Most refreshing of all is Rob's favorite,
the conflicted Laura, played by a woman known to
aficionados of foreign films for her role as a hooker in the
Danish movie "Mifune" of Soren Kragh-Jacobsen.  The
relationship between Laura and Rob is not entirely resolved
by the story's conclusion, but we wish them the best.
