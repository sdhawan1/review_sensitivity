     Though closer to consistently amusing than non-stop, fall-down fun-
ny, the first family film from Dreamworks is a slight delight.  Nathan
Lane and British comic Lee Evans play a pair of bickering, bumbling
brothers, trying to rid a prized old mansion of a mouse.  A very *smart*
mouse.  Slapstick ensues (vacuum versus sewage line, lit match versus
natural gas, etc.), but not nearly as much as the ads suggest.  (Nor as
hilarious as expected, either.  Have such shenanigans become too common-
place, after three HOME ALONE movies?)  Significant screen time is also
devoted to the rodent's POV, in several FX-intensive sequences set in-
side the walls of this old house.  Younger kids *may* grow restless dur-
ing the film's talkier bits, such as the brothers' ongoing efforts to
sell the ancient (but fully functioning) string factory that they also
inherited from their recently deceased father (William Hickey, looking
delightfully decrepit in his final screen role).  That said, whatever
the wee ones miss in dialogue, the exceptional visuals should still keep
them spellbound.  (My favorite, next to the sight of Lane's exaggerated
eyebrows, is the one-two punch of Phedon Papamichael's dark photography
and Linda DeScenna's goofy-Gothic production design.  We're talkin' Tim
Burton territory, here.)  And, parents, be forewarned about the City
Pound scenes, where Laurel and Hardy look to snatch "one mean pussy."
After the kids see *those* conditions, you'll never be able to get rid
of another pet again.  Get me my Gouda.

RUNNING TIME: 99 MINUTES (1 HOUR 39 MINUTES)
STARRING NATHAN LANE AND LEE EVANS
DIRECTED BY GORE VERBINSKI
After the mediocre The Peacemaker (1997) and the interesting if dull Amistad
(1997) Dreamworks tries again to have a hit with this children's movie. They
haven't got a hit on their hands, but Mouse Hunt is entertaining enough to
keep the kids happy. Nathan Lane and Lee Evans play brothers Ernie and Lars
Smuntz, who inherit a string factory, and a very spooky old house, from
father Rudolph (William Hickey.) They discover that the house is built by a
famous architect, and could receive $10 million if they manage to sell it.
However, one thing stands between vast wealth: a tiny mouse. But the chaos
it causes is unbelievable, and the film centres around the two brothers
trying desperately to get rid of the furry pest.
What Dreamworks have churned out is standard slapstick fare, although much
more visually pleasing and darker than most 'Home Alone' type movies. The
house looks really spooky, and really cool. The special effects are also
good, with the mouse looking pretty realistic in the CGI shots. Also, the
wide spread destruction is done well by CGI, and there's a hilarious
animatronic cat, called 'Catzilla' who really is a terrifying beast (almost
too scary for the child sitting next to me in the theater.) The sets are
excellent, with some great art direction, and good cinematography by Phedon
Papamichael. The house and effects, though, were too intense for some
children in the theater (not a good sign for a 'kiddies' film) although most
of them could handle it.
Complementing the comic effects perfectly are Lane and Evans, doing a grand
job working with the effects. Lane is good as the straight man, delivering
lines with perfect timing ("It's Hitler with a tail", he tells Evans on why
they should kill this mouse.) Also, Evans (a popular british comic) is
perfect with physical humour (the filmmakers were probably looking for a
cheap Jim Carrey-a like), and the scene where his clothes get caught in the
string factory machinery is slapstick genius. Christopher Walken makes an
appearance as a near psychotic bug exterminator, and is good fun. The
director, Gore Verbinski, graduating from commercials, fills the screen with
superb visual, and handles the slapstick really well. (The funeral at the
start is brilliant slapstick.)
But, beneath all the comedy, this is one dark movie. There is hardly any
light, it's almost continually raining, the house is spectacularly
forbidding, and some of the scenes (a man choking, then dying, on a
cockroach, the aforementioned Catzilla scene) could be a bit much for
children. Also, some of the jokes fall flat, and it even resorts to having
Lane and Evans just hit each other with frying pans. There are some standout
scenes (a chase inside a piano is genius), but generally, the visual are
aimed for adults, while the jokes are aimed for children. And there are
definitely not enough jokes for adults (unlike recent Disney films, which
try too hard to appeal to adults now-a-days.)
In the end, though, Mouse Hunt is enjoyable enough for kids, and should have
them laughing. Adults, though, should just sit back and enjoy the scenery.
Entertaining, but flawed and shallow.
OVERALL RATING=**1/2 OUT OF *****

 Computers are making cartoons obsolete. Take Gore Verbinski's `Mouse Hunt' for
 instance. Could they have made a live action film using Tex Averyesque cartoon
 physics any other way?
 No! Besides real people are far more belivable than cartoon people, a fact
 that isn't true for animals.
 William Hickey plays the late Rudolph Smuntz, who leaves his sons Ernie(Nathan
 Lane) and Lars(Lee Evans) an extremely antiquated string factory (even the
 workers are antiques), a derelict house and a box of precastro Cuban cigars.
 Unfortunatly, Ernie and Lars manage to drop old dad into a sewer, and there's
 a whiff of a curse in the air...
 The curse [which is implied, but never actually stated]works almost
 immediately. Lars' wife April (Vicki Lewis) immediately kicks him out of the
 house, the ancient box of cigars sprout cockroaches in the kitchen of Ernie's
 chic restaurant, killing the mayor and his business in one fell swoop, and our
 two heroes are homeless and friendless, but there is the old house, which
 turns out to be the missing work by the great 19th century architect LaRue.
 This is a live-action cartoon, so the laws of physics are against them, and
 not only that, but a cartoon mouse in live-action drag is living there! Tom
 and Jerry meets Laurel and Hardy! Lane even gets the tie stchick right! 
 Christopher Walken is great as the exterminater the two hire get rid of the
 title character, and the climax is just what you'd expect...in a good way of
 course.

MOUSE HUNT (DreamWorks) 
Starring: Nathan Lane, Lee Evans, Maury Chaykin, and Christopher Walken. 
Screenplay: Adam Rifkin. 
Producers: Alan Riche, Tony Ludwig, and Bruce Cohen. 
Director: Gore Verbinski. 
MPAA Rating: PG (slapstick violence, profanity, sexual innuendo) 
Running Time: 97 minutes.
Reviewed by Michael Dequina.
Rating: ** 1/2 out of **** (fair)
        With its three inaugural releases, megabucks studio DreamWorks SKG has
just about covered all the bases: middle-of-the-road action (THE
PEACEMAKER); highminded "Oscar bait" (AMISTAD), and now lowbrow comedy with
MOUSE HUNT, a slapstick comedy that will please the tykes but will leave
the rest of the family less than satisfied.
        The basic plot setup (a pair of down-on-their-luck brothers inherit a
rundown--and, as it turns out, valuable--house from their string
manufacturer father) is rendered irrelevant once the "star" of the movie
enters the picture: a tiny little mouse (a charmer by the name of "Jenny
the Mouse"), who immediately ruins the house renovation plans of the two
siblings, Ernie (Nathan Lane) and Lars (Lee Evans) Smuntz.  What ensues is
one long, frenzied pursuit in which the two bumbling brothers make attempt
after attempt to find and kill the mouse, who outsmarts them every time.
        MOUSE HUNT is little more than HOME ALONE with a mouse in the lead, which
should give you a clear idea about the bulk of the comedy in this film:
broad physical schtick.  Granted, this type of humor goes a long way with
the film's target audience--children--and a handful of the gags did make me
smile, but after a while I (and, I suspect, most adults in the audience)
grew tired of the pratfalls.  After all, a man getting hit in the head by a
blunt object can only be so "hilarious" after the first two or three times
it is done.
        What keeps the incessant slapstick from becoming completely monotonous are
the engaging performances.  Even though they are set up as the villains of
the piece, Lane and Evans, who develop a nice brotherly rapport, remain
likable and sympathetic; at certain points I found myself simultaneously
rooting for them _and_ the mouse.  And it is through the acting that the
film is able to maintain a slightly twisted edge.  Lane delivers his acid
one-liners with malicious glee, and an effectively creepy Christopher
Walken comes close to walking away with the movie as overzealous and
slightly psycho exterminator Caesar.
        MOUSE HUNT, like its destructive but well-meaning protagonist, is
harmless, a fairly safe bet to keep the little ones entertained for 97
minutes.  But anyone looking for a film that truly is fun for the whole
family is better off checking out the opulent ANASTASIA or, better yet,
Disney's modern classic THE LITTLE MERMAID, which is enjoying yet another
rerelease this week.

Here's a riddle: what do you get when two slow-witted men attempt to
invade a house manned by a solitary young boy?  The answer, of course,
is Home Alone.  All you need to do now is substitute the "young boy" for
"mouse," and you'll have a fairly good idea of what Mouse Hunt is all
about.
However, their is one major difference that separates the two films from
being distinctly alike: whilst the young lad in Home Alone set traps for
goofy villains, the mouse in Mouse Hunt simply avoids the ones set by
the invading men until they are stupid enough to fall for them
themselves.  This alone proves to be more amusing and much more enticing
than Home Alone's formula, and the same sort of physical comedy is
presented in an artistic and entertaining way that's bound to appeal to
both young and old.
It's the story of two greedy brothers. Ernie Smuntz (Nathan Lane) is a
professional chef who owns a high-class restaurant, and Lars Smuntz (Lee
Evans) works along side his father Rudolf Smuntz (William Hickey) in the
family string factory.  So when Rudolf dies, his string factory and an
apparently abandoned old mansion is left at the brothers' dispense.
They quickly ride off their new assets as worthless, and quickly stumble
into financial crisis.  Eventually, they discover that the old house was
in fact designed by a famous international architect and is worth
millions.  All they need to do to cash in is renovate the house.
There's just one problem: there's a mouse in the house.
Yes, this problem is more than laughable - but in no time Ernie and Lars
realize how serious the situation is and their money making scheme is
now in jeopardy.  This is when the real fun begins
Just as is expected from such a film, the two greedy brothers go to
absolute extremes to ensure that they do everything but kill the mouse.
In fact not only do they fail to succeed on all accounts, but they also
make themselves look like money seeking morons; and as their traps get
progressively more outrageous their hatred for this hairy critter grows
and grows.  But of course when they finally get the little rodent in
their hands, killing it seems to be a far too easy option
It is with a subtle cleverness and ingenious cartoony atmosphere that
unknown director Gore Verbinski has created in Mouse Hunt's zany
characters and their hilarious physical and intellectual comedy.  It's
definitely not your average kid's comedy; and if the advertising
previews are any incentive for you to give this one a miss then I
suggest you ignore them, run to your local cinema and let Mouse Hunt
refresh your idea of what an excellent family film really is.

DreamWorks SKG / 1:37 / 1997 / PG (language, slapstick violence, comic
 sensuality)
Cast: Nathan Lane; Lee Evans; Christopher Walken; Vicki Lewis; Eric Christmas; 
Maury Chaykin; William Hickey 
Director: Gore Verbinski 
Screenplay: Adam Rifkin 
Mickey Mouse had better watch his back -- there's a new critter in
town, and he's the nameless animal attraction of "Mouse Hunt,"
DreamWorks SKG's clever first foray into family fare. Although it runs
out of steam towards its end, this live-action comedy still boasts
enough energized slapstick and inventive set pieces to best Disney's
entire 1997 non-animated, kiddie-oriented catalog ... but consider
that list includes dismal tripe like "Air Bud," "Flubber" and "That
Darn Cat," and it's really not such a difficult feat to pull
off. Still, throw the two rodents in a boxing arena, and I'll be
hoping that the mouse from "Mouse Hunt" knocks some sense back into
Mickey.
Nathan Lane (Robin Williams' significant other from "The Birdcage")
and Lee Evans (last seen as a nervous bellhop in "The Fifth Element")
play Ernie and Lars Smuntz, befuddled brothers who have just inherited
two unwanted assets from their late father (William Hickey, in his
last role) -- a dilapidated old string factory and a dilapidated old
mansion. Although Lars made a deathbed promise to upkeep the former,
he and Ernie decide to sell the latter for big bucks after learning it
was designed by a famed architect. But there's a lone obstacle in
their way -- a single mouse lives within the walls of the house, and
he's not about to give up his place of residence without a fight.
Movies aimed at young audiences are rarely this visually
exquisite. The effects blending the talents of 60-some live mice, one
animatronic mouse and one computer-generated mouse are pretty
seamless. The splendid production design seems to be straight out of
Tim Burton's mind; the Smuntz's architecturally-unsound mansion is
like something straight out of "The Nightmare Before Christmas," and
the vortex of bizarre machinery in their factory resembles some of
Vincent Price's warped contraptions from "Edward Scissorhands." "Mouse
Hunt" is a pretty dark movie -- even some of the humor can be grim --
but it's hardly ever mean-spirited.
The star of the show is neither the top-billed Lane nor the titular
mouse. It's lanky British comedian Evans, whose hysterical bodily
antics suggest a cleaned-up Jim Carrey without the obnoxious overkill
(note a toned-down but nonetheless outrageous impromptu striptease);
Evans' banter with the ever-affable Lane is funny stuff, too, and
holds its own against the movie's more flashy physical shtick. Vicki
Lewis (Beth from "NewsRadio") is solid in a supporting role as Lars'
money-grubbing wife. And in a nifty bit of novelty casting,
Christopher Walken is a macabre delight as a spooky exterminator who
takes his job a little too seriously, popping a dropping into his
mouth and noting to his tape recorder that the mouse has a "calcium
deficiency." Blech.
A basically one-joke idea -- a mouse outsmarts a couple of bumbling
humans -- is given a rather engaging execution. Their sparring is
imaginatively realized (I don't think I'll ever forget the sight of
that tiny little mouse making his getaway on a rolling wheel of
Gouda), and although you really never fully root for either side,
that's okay -- a warm-and-fuzzy union between the two parties is
practically promised from the first frame they share. "Mouse Hunt" may
take a while to get going (the rather lengthy set-up could test the
patience of some of the younger children, although I rather liked it,
much in part to Lane and Evans), and the climactic sequence is allowed
to play out for a bit too long, but this appears to be one family
movie that most members of the family will be able to find agreeable,
not unlike the original "Home Alone."

This children's picture melds the comedic spirit of the original HOME
ALONE (7.5/10) picture, with the style and darkness of the ADDAMS
FAMILY movies.
PLOT:
Two unique brothers inherit a historically rich mansion from their
dying father. After valuing the house at over a million dollars, they
decide to hold an auction at which all interested parties could bid.
Unfortunately for them, there is one feisty little mouse in the house
that does not want to let anyone rest in peace. Mayhem ensues.
CRITIQUE:
Mostly enjoyable but redundant picture that pits two brothers against
the dynamic smarts of a two-inch mouse. This movie had many funny
moments, as well as many not-so-funny ones. Kids under ten should enjoy
this picture whole-heartedly, while all others might meander between
the "hit" and "miss" classifications. I guess it all depends on how
interested you are in seeing the hundreds of different ways that a tiny
mouse could frustrate two grown men. I personally was never really
bored during the entire picture, so I guess that's a pretty good sign.
Also, one of my favourite actors, Christopher Walken, makes an
incredible cameo as the "exterminator from hell" who owns every single
device known to man to deal with this defiant rodent. His fate is a
pretty slick sequence to behold. Other than that, not too many scenes
stick out in my mind, but the style of the picture is very cool and
Coen-esque. It's also very dark and colorless, unlike a lot of other
children's movies. This is an aspect that I embrace in pictures, but
you might not.
The actors are all fine in their roles, while the mouse also pulls off
an overall authentic vibe throughout the entire movie. All in all, I
guess that if you're in the mood to laugh at some morons getting
tricked by a cute mouse, this is your nacho plate for the night. If
not, skip this puppy and rent THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS (8/10) for
some real kid's dark, spooky fun.
Little Known Facts: 
Christopher Walken's real name is Ronald Walken (I wonder why he
changed it? :)). He was born in Queens, New York, in 1943, and has been
married to the same woman since 1969, Georgianne Walken. He won a Best
Supporting Actor Oscar for his role in 1978's DEER HUNTER (7.5/10). 
Ernie (Nathan Lane) greets Maury (Ernie Sabella) at the auction by
saying "Hakuna Matada", a reference to Lane and Sabella's roles in the
animated children's feature, THE LION KING (7.5/10).
Gore Verbinski was a TV commercial director before hitting the
feature-film realm. He directed the first "Budweiser Frogs" commercial.
Nathan Lane's real name is Joe Lane. He was born in New Jersey in 1956.
Lee Evans was born in Avonmouth, England.

De ultieme vorm in het comedy-genre is toch wel het leedvermaak, met als
beste voorbeeld de "Home Alone"-trilogie. De duivelse Kevin gaat (in
"Home Alone 1" en "Home Alone 2") op pad om het leven van de twee boeven
zuur te maken, met alle middelen binnen handbereik. Dat gaat er pijnlijk
aan toe, want strijkijzers en vlammenwerpers behoren tot z'n arsenaal.
Nu is er weer zo'n sadistische film gemaakt. Deze keer geen Kevin in de
hoofdrol, maar......een muis? 
Ernie (Nathan Lane) en Lars Smuntz (Lee Evans) zijn, na de dood van hun
vader, de trotse eigenaars van een touwfabriek en een oud huis. De
touwfabriek stelt weinig voor en bevindt zich in een bouwvallige staat.
Zeppco, een groot bedrijf, neemt graag deze fabriek voor een spotprijsje
over. Lars overweegt dit aanbod, maar denkt al snel aan z'n vader, die
erop stond dat Ernie en Lars samen deze fabriek zouden runnen. 
Nu blijft dus alleen het oude huis over, wat op het eerste gezicht niks
bijzonder lijkt. Totdat men erachter komt dat het een zeldzame LaRue is,
een merk waar men veel geld voor over heeft. Ernie en Lars komen snel
tot de conclusie dat ze het huis voor een zo hoog mogelijke prijs moeten
verkopen. Helaas worden hun plannen gedwarsboomd. Niet door een mens,
maar een klein muisje. Eentje die het hun heel moeilijk maakt... 
"Mouse Hunt" is zo'n film die je NIET serieus moet nemen. De film zit
vol met de stereotypes, het verhaal is broodmager en de trucs die de
muis uithaalt zijn natuurlijk onmogelijk. Maar dit alles heeft wl het
goede effect, want vaak lig je dubbel van het lachen.
Met de vlotte regie, de mooie special effects en de goede
acteerprestaties van de hoofdrolspelers is dit een uiterst vermakelijke
film geworden. Verwacht geen epos a la
Titanic, maar gewoon een leuk tussendoortje. 
Trouwens, de manier waarop Christopher Walken ("The Deer Hunter",
"Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead") zich als Caesar voor schut
zet, is onvergetelijk en absoluut het aanzien waard. Met z'n schorre
stem en coole verschijning is hij geknipt voor deze rol.

     You have to admire Dreamworks' guts for using a mouse in a direct 
challenge to Disney's family feature dominance (in fact, not only do 
they use it, but they make jokes about using it).  Unfortunately, that's 
one of the few admirable things about MOUSEHUNT, a clever but 
surprisingly stale exercise in tedium that's supposed to pass for a 
slapstick-laden live cartoon.  It's easy to see how the film makers 
thought they had a winning comedy on their hands, but the fatal flaw is 
in the design and execution, not the premise.
     MOUSEHUNT is HOME ALONE with a rodent in the place of Macaulay 
Culkin (which, regardless of how you feel about the child actor, is not 
an improvement).  The Smuntz brothers, Ernie (Nathan Lane) and Lars (Lee 
Evans), inherit two things from their recently-departed father:  a 
rundown string making business and an even more rundown mansion.  Much 
to their surprise, it turns out that both are worth a lot of money.  
But, although Lars refuses to sell the business (he made a deathbed 
promise to his father to keep it in the family), both brothers agree to 
fix up the house, then auction it off.  There's one little problem, 
however:  the mansion is infested by a mouse, and it's an extremely 
smart, devious, and dangerous little animal.  When Ernie and Lars can't 
get rid of the unwanted pest, and a feline named Catzilla is equally 
unsuccessful, they call in an exterminator (Christopher Walken).  He too 
turns out to be no match for the "Hitler with a tail."
     On an intellectual level, I can appreciate the potential amusement 
value of a story in which a mouse outwits and beats up a group of inept 
human beings.  The problem is, with all of its physical comedy, this 
movie is going for a more visceral appeal.  To that end, it makes a 
serious mistake.  MOUSEHUNT alienates the audience from all of the on-
screen characters, and the distance is so great that it's difficult to 
care about any of the participants, regardless of whether they're four-
legged or two-legged.  This lack of involvement caused me to lose 
interest.  It's also never clear whether the film makers' sympathies lie 
with the cute rodent or the Smuntzes.  Who, if anyone, are we supposed 
to be rooting for?
     The film's ambivalent approach saps the life out of any humor.  
Some of the comic bits are inventive, but they're not funny.  The film 
isn't as lifeless as MR. MAGOO, but I still didn't react more positively 
than with an occasional smile.  Seeing people fall through floors and 
get snapped by mouse traps is only entertaining if it's properly set up.  
That's why we laugh when Wile E. Coyote endures physical abuse, but not 
when the same things happen to Nathan Lane.  
     Live action cartoons are hit-and-miss affairs (witness the 
differing quality of the aforementioned HOME ALONE and MR. MAGOO), and 
this one is more of a "miss" than a "hit".  MOUSEHUNT is a slapsticky 95 
minutes filled with dull, obligatory comedy that may amuse children but 
is unlikely to enthrall adults.  The special effects used to create the 
mouse are effective, with the antics of 60 real-life rodents and one 
animatronic creature seamlessly edited together by first-time feature 
director Gore Verbinski, who previously made the Budweiser frog 
commercials.  However, in today's marketplace, that's not much of an 
achievement.  Even Christopher Walken, playing a spoof of his usual 
creepy self, fails to generate much genuine humor.  His performance, 
like the rest of the picture, seems recycled.

How do films like MOUSE HUNT get into theatres?  Isn't there a law or
something?
This diabolical load of claptrap from Steven Speilberg's Dreamworks
studio is Hollywood family fare at its deadly worst.  MOUSE HUNT takes
the bare threads of a plot and tries to prop it up with overacting and
flat-out stupid slapstick that makes comedies like JINGLE ALL THE WAY
look decent by comparison.
Writer Adam Rifkin and director Gore Verbinski are the names chiefly
responsible for this swill.  The plot, for what its worth, concerns
two brothers (Nathan Lane and an appalling Lee Evens) who inherit a
poorly run string factory and a seemingly worthless house from their
eccentric father.  Deciding to check out the long-abandoned house,
they soon learn that it's worth a fortune and set about selling it in
auction to the highest bidder.  But battling them at every turn is a
very smart mouse, happy with his run-down little abode and wanting it
to stay that way.
The story alternates between unfunny scenes of the brothers bickering
over what to do with their inheritance and endless action sequences as
the two take on their increasingly determined furry foe.  Whatever
promise the film starts with soon deteriorates into boring dialogue,
terrible overacting, and increasingly uninspired slapstick that
becomes all sound and fury, signifying nothing.  The script becomes so
unspeakably bad that the best line poor Lee Evens can utter after
another run in with the rodent is: "I hate that mouse".  Oh cringe!
This is HOME ALONE all over again, and ten times worse.
One touching scene early on is worth mentioning.  We follow the mouse
through a maze of walls and pipes until he arrives at his makeshift
abode somewhere in a wall.  He jumps into a tiny bed, pulls up a
makeshift sheet and snuggles up to sleep, seemingly happy and just
wanting to be left alone.  It's a magical little moment in an
otherwise soulless film.
A message to Speilberg: if you want Dreamworks to be associated with
some kind of artistic credibility, then either give all concerned in
MOUSE HUNT a swift kick up the arse or hire yourself some decent
writers and directors.  This kind of rubbish will just not do at all.

     MOUSE HUNT, the first kids' movie from the new DreamWorks studio,
should come with a warning.  Its PG rating may give a false sense of
security to parents, but they may find their kids wanting to leave
early as several around us did.  Later in the review I'll cover some of
the picture's questionable aspects.
     The dark movie opens with a funeral.  The father, Rudolph Smuntz,
played just before his death by William Hickey, has died.  His grown
sons, Ernie and Lars, played without much energy by Nathan Lane and Lee
Evans, are carrying their father's casket.  When the brothers drop the
casket, the corpse comes flying out, which immediately began to scare
some of the kids around us.
     The father, whose motto is "a world without string is chaos," owns
a bankrupt string factory.  He bequeaths it and a heavily mortgaged,
broken down house to his two sons.  The house is correctly described as
"cold and spooky," and Phedon Papamichael's creepy, dark cinematography
adds to the fright.  ("Can we go now?" asked the kid behind me, clearly
upset.)  Alan Silvestri's whimsical music tries to set a happier mood
to the picture.
     With a DOA performance by the two leads, the mouse shows up and
almost saves the picture.  His antics are delightful, and he is the
only one present with any intelligence.  When the brothers slice off a
piece of cheese to put it on a mouse trap, the mouse rolls the entire
cheese wheel away instead.  And when they hire a scary cat named
Catzilla, whose claim to fame is that he survived being gassed at the
pound, even he cannot outsmart the mouse.
     The broke brothers find out that, since their father's house was
designed by a famous architect, it can be sold for over ten million
dollars.  In an illogical fit of anger they slowly demolish their only
valuable possession in a vain quest to kill the pesky mouse.  The only
smart thing they do is hire Caesar the Exterminator -- smart because
Christopher Walken's militarily precise performance is the only decent
one by a human being in the movie.  Looking like Robert De Niro in his
role of Harry Tuttle in BRAZIL, Walken goes after the little critter
with gadgets and pseudo-sophisticated strategy.  Got to think like a
mouse to capture one, he explains.
     The most imaginative sequence in the film has the mouse running
behind the walls, chased by a series of nails being hammered into the
wall.  As he is trapped between two nails with another about to shoot
through his eyes, he is saved at the last second.  Needless to say, the
kids are apt to be to scared by this scene as it looks like the mouse
is about to die a horrible death.
     First-time movie director Gore Verbinski, whose background is
television commercials, manages to maintain interest in the show's
black comedy for about thirty minutes, but after that repetition sets
in.  The mouse's acrobatics always delight, but banged heads have a
limited appeal.
     As promised, I'll cover some of the inappropriate parts of the
movie.  First, the tone is extremely dark.  After opening with the
burial of one person, they kill off another with a realistic scene in
which an obese man eats a cockroach, throws it up and then dies of a
massive heart attack.  My son refused to drink water after the movie
until he inspected it for bugs.  In a particularly gross scene, the
exterminator eats mouse feces as an investigative technique.
     In the sexually questionable category are a series of fondlings
that occur at the end.  When the mouse runs down a woman's dress, one
brother reaches his arm way down inside her dress with the appearance
of fondling her.  This causes her friend to grab the other brother's
hand and put it down her dress so she can be fondled too.  And there is
a similar scene when the mouse runs down a man's pants, and his brother
puts his arm in after it.  These scenes have no place in a PG movie
with a theater filled with young kids.  (I checked and was not able to
find any other reviewers who have mentioned the movie's questionable
parts.  How can they be so oblivious to the sensibilities of the
movie's target audience?  Don't any of the reviewers have kids?)
     The movie ends in one of its few upbeat moments.  The ending
possesses the intelligent and good spirited humor that the rest of the
movie so often lacks.
     MOUSE HUNT runs 1:30.  It is incorrectly rated PG and should be
considered questionable for kids under 10.
     My son Jeffrey, age 8, spent most of the movie so scared that he
was shaking, but said he wanted to stay.  In the end he claimed he
thought the movie was "great and funny."  He went on to say that he
wanted to advise parents that "if you don't like bugs or mice or bloody
scenes or if your child gets scared easily, don't see it."  His friend
Matthew, age 9, said the movie was "a rich and cheesy deal, but it was
good."  Both of them said they liked HOME ALONE 3 much better because
it had more action, was funnier and wasn't so gross.

Starring: Nathan Lane, Lee Evans, Maury Chaykin, and Christopher Walken.
Screenplay: Adam Rifkin. Producers: Alan Riche, Tony Ludwig, and Bruce
Cohen. Director: Gore Verbinski.
This is a mouse and this is a house, and this is about as funny as the
movie gets. In this unnecessary epic tale of two none-too bright
brothers come to stake their claims on a 10 million house, they must
first boot the illegal tenant a mouse, into the snow. If you like movies
where grown men continually make idiots of themselves, then this movie
is for you. There are enough HOME ALONE scenes in this movie to make all
McCauley Culken wanna-bes, happy little boys.
The mouse doesn't speak a word of English, but has an impeccable sense
of timing and undeniable good sense of humour. Foiling the greedy
brothers with every twist of traps and turn of cheese, it outwits the
dimwit brothers, inflicting hell on all concerned. This rising star of
the animal kingdom is not by any means as talented as BABE, but still
encapsulates intelligence, wit and cheek in its tiny body. Judging from
the fickleness of Hollywood contracts, it is likely that more that two
dozen mice were dumped from the set because they were either getting too
old, too ugly or just plain pregnant. Isn't the going settlement 7
million for all pregnant stars unduly discharged? How I wish I was a
pregnant mouse.
Taking the passenger seats in this roller coaster comedy are the Smuntz
brothers Nathan Lane and Lee Evans. Lane from THE BIRDCAGE once again
shows us his comedic talents as he is beaten and battered to death by a
mouse. Hard to believe, but I guess it takes more than just contrived
acting to convince the audience that a mouse has just beaten you up  so
full marks to Lane for lowering himself to the task. There is also a
delightful appearance from Christopher Walken as the pest control
extraordinare - even he the master of villainous guises falls prey to
the mightier mouse.
So this new offering from SKG is not as funny as it had hoped. Diverting
enough entertainment for the holiday period, but the material is as
intelligent as handing a mouse a script, letting it chew it up before
releasing it in a house to cause mayhem on the world. Happier hunting
next time SKG, this is not the big cheese that everyone will take the
bait for.

     Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy would probably enjoy 'Mouse Hunt'.
The humour is designed to be something straight out of one of their
movies.  The great slapstick duo of film's early years cannot be
compared to anyone so the comparison to them is only in the style of
comedy projected by this movie.
     Two brothers (Nathan Lane and Lee Evans) have inherited two things
upon the death of their father (William Hickey).  The first is a string
factory falling on hard times and the second is a creaky and neglected
mansion built in 1876.  At first thought, it appears that the house is
worthless but upon further examination of some blueprints they discover,
it occurs to them that the year 1876 was the American centennial and
they also discover that the house was built by a world renowned
architect admired by the wealthy.  One man offers the brothers a
substantial amount for the dwelling and tells them that he has over 40
other houses designed by the same architect.  They decline his offer
because they feel they can get more by auctioning it off.
     Embarking on a much needed renovation, the brothers find there is a
slight problem which may lower the property value of their house; a
mouse!  They feel that the problem could be more than one mouse but it
turns out from the audience's look at the film that there is indeed only
one mouse who feels the two brothers are the invaders and not him.  The
mouse is extremely clever as he avoids traps and leads the brothers into
creating more destruction for themselves in their attempt to catch him.
The mouse steals an entire block of round cheese by rolling it like a
wheel.  He has the brothers fall victim to their multiple mouse traps
and he even outsmarts an expert exterminator (Christopher Walken) in a
key role approaching it like he was a bounty hunter.
     'Mouse Hunt' is a good family film addressing the necessary comic
turns comparable to the dark punch of a boxing glove and Lee Evans is
hilarious as the better of the two brothers named Smuntz.  Sounds like a
name perfect for comedy.  The interesting thing about the movie is that
the scenes with the rodent rascal are done three ways.  With a real
mouse, a mechanical one and a computer enhanced one for those scenes
that look cartoonish and that is much of the films content.  Much of the
humour is dark but also very cute with special appeal to children and
while it is a cross between a road runner cartoon and a Laurel and Hardy
slapstick feature, it still is worth a look.
