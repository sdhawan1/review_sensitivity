Joe Gould's Secret is the third directorial effort from prolific character
actor Stanley Tucci. Similar to his previous films, Big Night and The
Impostors, Tucci continues his trend of focusing on unique relationships
between two male characters of the past. Unlike his previous films, Joe Gould's
Secret is based on a true story that occurred during the 1950's within
Greenwich Village, New York City. The acting in the film is particularly
impressive especially from the two leads, Tucci and Ian Holm. Their
performances clearly show the vast research and accuracy they brought into
their difficult characters. However, the film's dull script eventually grows so
tiresome that the outstanding performances are unable to save it. 
The characters in Joe Gould's Secret are so irregular that it is almost a
mystery how this film is as it boring as it is. First there is the ostensibly
simple Joseph Mitchell (Tucci). A well-known writer for New Yorker magazine who
can create a masterpiece on paper but can barely speak a full sentence in
person without the occasional uhhh's or ummm's in between words. Mitchell,
speaking with an acute Southern accent, is so kind, it is fascinating he is
able to survive and succeed in a hectic city such as New York. Looking for a
story that will make him a writing legend, Mitchell finds himself following and
writing about the adventures of a homeless man named Joe Gould (played
wonderfully by Ian Holm). Gould is loud, annoying, and rude but Mitchell finds
that this man is something different. The loquacious Gould, it turns out, is
writing a book called The Oral History. Consisting of  random quotes that Gould
has heard from diverse people around the city, the book currently holds three
times as many words as the Bible. As Mitchell follows Gould, he learns that
Gould is very popular among the upper class art lovers, who enjoy his company
because of his wildly eccentric characteristics. Mitchell searches for the
majority of the film Joe Gould's secret. He tries to solve the enigma that is
Gould. Is Gould an ignored genius with a lot on his mind or is he a phony just
trying to cheat the upper class out of their money?
The script at first is excellent. It does a fine job setting up the characters
and building a solid relationship between Gould and Mitchell. However, what
made the script unsatisfactory was that the main plot was constantly
interrupted by pointless characters or scenes. Small roles from big actors such
as Steve Martin and Susan Surandon hurt the film more than helped it because
they were so distracting and out of the ordinary. Hope Davis' character as
Mitchell's wife was not fully developed so the scenes in which Mitchell spends
time with his family seem very pointless and unnecessary. These scenes were
incredibly dull especially when compared to the intense and exciting action
that Ian Holm brings to the screen. Because of the distractions that plague the
main plot, the script loses its steam about two-thirds of the way into the
film, once Mitchell has written his article about Gould. At this point,
Mitchell becomes just as tired of Gould as I am. Sitting through the final
third of the film was like torture. It never seemed to end.
See this film for the acting. I have never seen Ian Holm better than this in a
barely recognizable role. He gives out the perfect message that his character
is someone you admire greatly but because of his lack of manners, you don't
want to eat lunch with him. If Joe Gould's Secret becomes widely recognized, I
beg the Academy not to forget him next year.

Character-actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's latest is based on a
true story from the 1940s about New York City residents Joseph Mitchell
and Joe Gould.  These two were far from your average Joes Â– Mitchell was
a popular columnist for the New Yorker, while Gould was a legendary bum
who prowled around Greenwich Village.  Tucci's fantastic film is based
on two articles that Mitchell wrote for his magazine.  The first,
`Professor Seagull,' was published in 1942, and the second, `Joe Gould's
Secret,' came out twenty-two years later, long after Gould had died and
Mitchell had discovered his `secret.'
Tucci (The Impostors) plays Mitchell, an elegant writer that can barely
sputter out a complete thought during face-to-face interaction with
other humans.  He's happily married to a photographer (a dark-haired
Hope Davis, Mumford) and has two precocious daughters.  One day, while
eating lunch at a coffee shop, Mitchell crosses paths with the homeless
Gould (Ian Holm, eXistenZ), a crazy, disheveled, mumbling, foul-mouthed,
arm-flapping, name-dropping Harvard graduate/exhibitionist that claims
he's a direct descendant of William the Conqueror and is able to
communicate with seagulls. Gould, like Hannibal Lecter, can pinpoint
Mitchell's birthplace from hearing one simple phrase.
Gould is also working on a book called `The Oral History of the World'
(or sometimes, just the `O.H.'), a tale about the overheard
conversations of anonymous, everyday people that will someday show the
world what went wrong with society. Gould has been working on the book
for years that, to date, dwarfs the Holy Bible in terms of sheer
volume.  Needless to say, Mitchell is intrigued by Gould and begins to
spend time with him so he can write an article championing his cause.
When he asks Gould for samples of his work, he is told that the bulk of
Gould's masterpiece is currently being stored in the basement of a house
on a Long Island duck and chicken farm.
When the New Yorker piece runs, Gould becomes a cult hero, receiving
contributions to his `fund,' and also gaining a mysterious benefactor.
He is finally granted membership to a snooty Greenwich poetry society
that he used to be kicked out of on a regular basis.  But he also
continues to bother the patient Mitchell, who Gould begins to refer to
as his biographer.  Mitchell just wants to move onto his next subject,
but Gould won't let him.
Gould's character brings to mind Henry Fool from Hal Hartley's 1998 film
of the same name.  A dreamer like Gould, Fool also wrote his life's work
in dime-store composition books and believed that the finished product
would shake up the world.  Holm's performance is beyond words.  He
doesn't look a lick like himself (his Gould more resembles Bob Hoskins
in Cousin Bette) and he perfectly ends every one of Gould's rambling
sentences by incoherently trailing off, like Mike Myers doing an
impression of Rolling Stone Ron Wood.
Tucci's direction here is much better than The Impostors, which was
obviously a bit of a lighter film.  As a result, Gould is much more
focused and perfectly captures the look and feel of World War II New
York City.  Gould was photographed by Maryse Alberti (Velvet Goldmine,
Happiness) and scored by Evan Lurie (Trees Lounge).  The film co-stars
Steve Martin (Bowfinger), Susan Sarandon (Cradle Will Rock) and Patricia
Clarkson (The Green Mile).
Perhaps the most interesting thing about the story is the fact that
Mitchell continued to go to his New Yorker office every day after
publishing `Joe Gould's Secret' in 1964.  He wrote for years and years,
but was never printed again, claiming he was working on some big piece
that remained shrouded in mystery. Nobody ever found out what it was,
and Mitchell died in 1996.

IN SHORT: One good one for us grownups.
There should be no secrets kept about Stanley Tucci's third outing as a
director. Joe Gould's Secret is an intelligent, touching, beautifully
written and acted film. A flat out fine film for those of us who don't
require explosions, foul mouthed rap music, gratuitous sex or violence
from our movies.[Not that there's anything wrong with that, but . . .
]
Writing from the experience of a life-long New Yorker, I can honestly
report that in the decades while the homeless were anonymous, this city
had what we called "characters". Some may or may not have been homeless
or living in shelters, some may or may not have been addicts of any
kind, but they all stood out from the average bum in the gutter. In the
last twenty years, two come to mind. One, a very tall, blind poet, used
to stand on the corner of Sixth Avenue and 53rd street in full Viking
Warrior gear, spear and all, and recite for spare change. When he died
last year, after a number of years in Europe, he got a full write-up in
the New York Times. The second, Adam Purple (as in dressed head to foot
in) squatted in an abandoned tenement downtown and built, over the
course of a decade or two, an astounding garden on an abandoned plot of
land. When the City trashed it to build low cost housing not only was it
news, it broke our hearts.
Which brings us to the subject of Stanley Tucci's third feature as a
director, Joe Gould's Secret. Joe Gould (Ian Holm) was, thanks to an
article by Joseph Mitchell (Tucci) in The New Yorker, such a character.
Initially known as Professor Sea Gull, because of his self proclaimed
ability to converse in the language of the gull, the article made Gould
a minor celebrity in the growing bohemian counterculture down in the
Greenwich Village of 1942 or so. Planted in a window table at the
Minetta Tavern, scribbling in a school composition notebook and/or
reciting poetry or speaking the language of the gulls, Gould would
solicit contributions to the "Joe Gould Fund" all of which was to
support his massive written work in progress, "An Oral History of Our
Time".  Every conversation with every person Gould has met is written
down and, he claims, stored in a lockbox of a memory that recalls every
word.
Among Gould's famed contributors and supporters are Ezra Pound and e.e.
cummings, neither of whom appear in the flick. We do get to meet artist
Alice Neel (Susan Sarandon) and publisher Charlie Duell (Steve Martin)
who do their best to try and give Joe the exposure they think he
deserves. We do see his acceptance in The Raven Poetry Society, a group
of snobs who, after ten years tolerating Joe's mooching at their buffet,
allow him entry after fame strikes.
What we see best is a pair of great character performances by Tucci and
Holm. Joe Mitchell's family life is rounded out by Hope Davis, as his
photographer wife Therese and two kidlets (of whom one real life
surviving kidlet consulted on the film) and it is a fully formed
picture. We see a working guy do his story and try to move on -- except
for the fact that the story keeps coming back. In this case, Gould camps
out in the lobby of The New Yorker, waiting for Mitchell. And waiting.
And waiting.
Joe Gould's "secret" is revealed in the film. What is more interesting
is an even darker secret that pops up in the middle of the film and
promptly disappears. You'll know it when you see it. Unless, of course,
I'm suffering from an overactive imagination.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Joe Gould's Secret, he would have
paid . . .
Much better than the average arthouse fare and, IMO, a return to the
solid film-making talent Stanley Tucci showed in Big Night.

Stanley Tucci should stick to acting.  As a director, he lets JOE
GOULD'S SECRET run down like a tape player with a rapidly dying battery.
Although admittedly not as bad or as ambitious as his last movie, the
audacious failure called THE IMPOSTORS, this latest movie of Tucci's
hasn't much to recommend it other than its period sets.  There is a
sterling supporting cast (Patricia Clarkson, Hope Davis, Steve Martin
and Susan Sarandon), but they are so underutilized that they hardly
count.  Imagine arranging for Steve Martin to be in your movie and then
giving him a throwaway part.  What a waste.
The movie, set in the 1940s, is based on a true story of a writer for
The New Yorker, Joe Mitchell (Tucci), who finds an eccentric
motor-mouth, Joe Gould (Ian Holm), who he thinks would make a wonderful
subject for an article.  This disheveled Bohemian spends his time in
restaurants and art galleries begging, claiming that he is collecting
for the "Joe Gould Fund." He says that he is working on an oral history
of the city that already encompasses over a million words.  The tome
contains the random thoughts of the people he meets.
Ian Holm, who looks like Robinson Crusoe in a Goodwill suit, overacts
with a vengeance.  When a waitress complains about Joe's emptying an
entire bottle of ketchup on his food, he jumps up on his chair and
screams out, "I'm no ordinary person!  I'm Joe Gould!"  Holm's
performance, although cute at first, quickly becomes repetitive and
irritating.  With each successive picture, Tucci increasingly encourages
his actors to overdo it and aims too often for camp.
Yes, Joe has a secret, but, not only is it easy to guess, it's also not
very interesting.  The first half hour of the picture is worth
recommending, but after that, you're better off giving up rather than
staying with it.  Like the Cheshire cat, the movie slowly fades away.
But, rather than leaving only a smile, all the movie leaves are some
pristine-perfect period automobiles and other set decorations.
JOE GOULD'S SECRET runs 1:44.  It is rated R for some language and brief
nudity and would be acceptable for teenagers.
