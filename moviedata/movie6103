   Remember this one from English class?
   Strangely enough medieval ballads like this one were among
my favorite memories from college sophomore English class and
what's more I think they could be appealing even to high school
kids because a good deal of them are blood-curdling.  Poisoning
and suicide by lovers ("Barbara Allen"), stabbings of fathers by
their sons ("Edward"), drownings on the high seas because of
predicted storms ignored by seamen ("Sir Patrick Spens") pop up
among other casualties.  Then again, a modern kid would want
the ballads set to rap and that would kind of destroy the lovely lilt
that always undercut the subversive nature of the words.  In
Maggie Greenwald's exquisitely sensitive and sincere film
"Songcatcher," the title character laments the fact that people
today may read the words to the songs,  but what good are mere
statements without the music that makes them soar?  Ms.
Greenwald, whose previous and largely ignored film "The Ballad of
Little Jo" (about a woman in 1866, disgraced by her out-of-
wedlock baby, who runs to the West and like Yentl pretends she's
a man), comes across once again.  With the help of "Little Jo"'s
music composer David Mansfield Greenwald has fashioned a film
that's a revelation.  With a superlative cast acting  the roles of
mountain people who react to a city slicker in their midst,
"Songcatcher" could forever alter your impression of hillbillies.
   Filmed on location in the western mountains of North Carolina
north of Asheville, "Songcatcher" centers on Janet McTeer in the
role of Dr. Lily Penleric who, upon being passed over in 1907 for a
promotion to full professor of music (in favor of a male outsider)
becomes a feminist albeit in a less aggressive manner than did
Suzi Amis's title character in "The Ballad of Little Jo."  She quits
her job and heads for the hills, aiming to capture Appalachian
music from its source and that music's relationship to the Scotch-
Irish ballads that were anonymously composed between 1200 and
1700 and passed on through the generations.  Taking up
residence in a snug wooden cabin with her schoolteacher sister
Elna (Jane Adams), she is well on her way to writing her book
when she hears the words to several ballads beautifully performed
by a teenage girl, Deladis Slocumb (Emmy Rossum).  Lily realizes
straight away that these ballads are in the pure form not yet
known by so-called outlanders (those who do not live in these
Appalachian communities).  She transcribes the notes and
records the songs on a primitive cylinder to be placed by one of
those Victrolas you see in the RCA ads now and then.
    Two other people change her life as dramatically.  One is Viney
Butler (Pat Carroll) in an Earth-mother role, shotgun in hand, who
knocks the city out of Lily by commanding her to assist in a bloody
childbirth. The other is a man with whom she becomes
romantically involved--kept apart for a while as Tom Bledsoe
(Aidan Quinn), wants her off the property because he considers
her writing and recording to be an exploitation of his people.
   "Songcatcher" is a happy combination of captivating music
sung by the local L'iL Abners either a capella or to the
accompaniment of banjos and fiddles and splendid ensemble
acting, the performers enacting the types of disputes that even
citizens in big cities are a part of--intellectual theft, exploitation by
capitalists, Bible-thumping gay bashers to cite a few.  McTeer
does a super job, wide-eyed throughout a good deal of the
proceedings as she watches a manager of a mining company
buying up land at Depression prices from the poor denizens, and
again in the middle of a fiery confrontation that erupts when one of
the villagers discovers her sister, Elna, in flagrante with her
teaching partner and lover, Harriet Tolliver (E. Katherine Kerr).
   I took issue with two points, however minor.  In one case, the
educated mining company manager holds that Johann Sebastian
Bach's music is superior to folk songs.  Lily responds that this is
like comparing apples and oranges "to the detriment of both
traditions."  Contrary to her rejoinder, one could hardly say that
the simple, repetitive melodies of the mountain people, however
lovely, can compare with the profound variations of, say, the
Brandenburg concerti or the Passacaglia and Fugue in B minor. 
In another segment of the story, Tom tells Lily that the outlanders
will never be interested in the music of the mountain people
because they consider hillbillies "dirty and illiterate."  Well...in fact
for all the goodness in their hearts, for the most part those
depicted in "Songcatcher" simply are.
   I was hoping that at some point in the 109 minute picture, Lily
would explain why these medieval ballads (which she erroneously
calls "ancient") are so bloody in contrast to the purely romantic
songs of, say, the U.S. during the 1950's as performed on TV in
"Your Hit Parade."  These cavils aside, "Songcatcher" is an
absolutely graceful and enchanting look at music that is so pure
you may just come away wishing that all the punk rock, acid rock
and even rock 'n' roll could just disappear so that we can at least
return to the innocence and charm of the folk era that informed
the generation of Pete Seeger, the Weavers, and the like.
Rated PG-13.  Running time: 109 minutes.  (C) 2001 by

There should be a special place in purgatory for filmmakers who dig into a
wonderful subject and ruin it for everybody else by making a bad movie.  Maggie
Greenwald's Songcatcher ventures into the mountains of Appalachia at the turn of
the last century to mine the rich traditions of the folk music that had come
over with immigrants from the British Isles a couple of centuries before and had
survived, almost unchanged, to that time.  The music is good.  But the story,
the writing, and the direction are a travesty.  Songcatcher is artistic strip
mining, leaving the territory it plunders bare, forlorn, and unusable.
Greenwald has researched her subject and drawn on historical characters,
but the fictional characters and situations she has created don't suggest real
people in that place at that time.  Dr. Lily Penleric (Janet McTeer) is a
musicologist at an Eastern college.  She's a feisty one, aggressive sexually and
ambitious professionally.  When she's rejected for tenure because of her gender,
it riles her up.
This happens in the first scene, and it's a revealing scene for its
self-conscious exposition.  She's been passed over in favor of a male
musicologist -- "Cyrus Whittle,' her department chairman announces smugly, `who,
as you know, has almost singlehandedly created the revival of the English folk
song."  Scene after scene will follow this lead Â– uneasy, unconvincing moments
between badly drawn characters assembled to advance a forced narrative and an
afterthought of a love story, all in the service of a set of late-20th century
perspectives on social issues.  
After her snub in academia, Dr. Penleric heads off to Appalachia to visit
her sister Elna (Jane Adams) who has started a mountain school with her friend
Harriet (E. Katherine Kerr).  When Lily discovers the two are lesbians, she's
disgusted, but she finds a welcome distraction in the treasure of old folk songs
that the mountain people sing.  She starts collecting the songs, on paper and on
wax cylinders, but she runs into opposition from a local named Tom (Aidan
Quinn), who suspects that she's out to exploit his people.  
How he comes to change his mind about her, how she gradually sheds her
uppity, pedantic airs, how the lesbian cat escapes the bag and triggers
melodrama, heartbreak, and destruction in paradise, are matters best left for
the movie to unfold.  Sequences like the one in which Lily runs in panic through
the nighttime woods and emerges into a field in broad daylight provide the
respite of puzzlement.  The music makes some of it bearable, but even the
musical scenes are not an unalloyed gift.  There are a few pure moments, such as
the great bluesman Taj Mahal being trotted out for one brief guitar riff and
then packed off again into the wings, but Aidan Quinn, fine actor though he is,
fails to convince either with his playing of the banjo or the guitar or the
character.  The orphan Deladis (Emmy Rossum) and the old granny Viney (Pat
Carroll) sing us a number of ballads, and do pretty well with the music, but the
acting is a burden.  McTeer is a former Oscar nominee, but here the odds are
stacked against her.
Any movie that can arouse compassion is worthy of notice, and this movie
does arouse compassion for the poor actors, exposed in scene after scene without
the decent covering of adequate dialogue or direction.

Susan Granger's review of "SONGCATCHER" 
In the midst of this summer's fare of dinos revisited and romantic fiascoes,
there are a few thoughtful movies - and this Appalachian period drama is one.
Oscar nominee Janet McTeer ("Tumbleweeds") stars as Dr. Lily Penleric, an
accomplished musicologist who, back in that pre-feminist era, was refused a full
professorship at her university. Determined to prove her worth, she ventures
deep into the rugged mountains of North Carolina, where her younger sister Elna
(Jane Adams) runs a school. There in Bear Creek, she discovers a treasure-trove
of traditional Scots-Irish and English folk ballads, given a unique
interpretation by the insular locals. 
Excited, she sends for recording equipment and persuades Vinie Butler (Pat
Carroll) and other self-sustaining mountain folk to share their musical heritage
on her Edison phonograph cylinders. Their music, as she puts it, is "as much a
part of life here as the air you breathe." That's the main thrust of
writer-director Maggie Greenwald's occasionally uneven culture-clash story,
which is loosely based on Olive Dame Campbell's foray through the Blue Ridge
Mountains in 1908, but there's also some melodramatic romantic spice. Ornery,
bearded, banjo-picking Aidan Quinn falls for the statuesque, passionate
"songcatcher," while Elna secretly engages in a lesbian relationship with a
colleague (E. Katherine Kerr). I'm ready to buy the soulful soundtrack with
vocalists like Emmylou Harris, Iris DeMent, Taj Mahal and young opera star Emmy
Rossum who plays a pivotal role as McTeer's wide-eyed protÃ©gÃ©. Rated PG-13,
there's an intense scene of primitive childbirth. On the Granger Movie Gauge of
1 to 10, "Songcatcher" is an intelligent, extraordinary 8, transported by the
transcendent power of song.

The very idea of an arthouse film about a person going off to a remote area
to "catch" songs makes me giggle uncontrollably.  Since when does
independent cinema have to steal ideas from PokÃ©mon?  Is there really any
difference between gathering old Gaelic tunes and stockpiling "pocket
monsters"?  Beats me, but at least Songcatcher didn't give me any seizures.
The film, which is a must for any music lover that isn't into bands that
spell stuff wrong (i.e., Limp Bizkit, Korn, Staind, Outkast, etc.), is set
just after the turn of the 20th century and opens at an unnamed university.
Dr. Lily Penleric (Janet McTeer, The King is Alive) believes she's in line
for a big promotion in the school's music department, but the position is
instead given to a well-respected musical outsider.  To make matters worse
for Lily, the university's board made the decision unanimously, despite the
fact that she was having an affair with one of the higher powers.
Disenchanted with the school (and men in general), Lily heads off to her
sister Elna's (Jane Adams, The Anniversary Party) home in a coal-mining town
deep in the Appalachian Mountains.  When she gets there, Lily discovers
(among other things) the area is filled with a bunch of barefoot,
jug-blowin', foot-stompin', overall-wearin' hillbillies who croon
traditional folk music learned from their Irish and Scottish ancestors.
Even though she has heard some of the songs before, the locals' versions are
much more pure and contain numerous verses that Lily has never encountered.
This is when the collecting starts.  Lily tries to have an assistant lug an
extremely heavy recording device though the hills to track down as many
songs as she can.  And she's met with resistance, initially in the form of a
shotgun-wielding grandmother named Viney (Pat Carroll), and then, after you
say to yourself, "I hope Lily gets a love interest," Viney's grandson, Tom
(a very chunky Aidan Quinn, Practical Magic), who thinks Lily is just trying
to take advantage of them thar bumpkins.
If you're going for the music, you won't be disappointed, as the characters
belt out bubble-sounding songs that contain some seriously dark material
(and they're performed by the likes of Taj Mahal and Emmylou Harris).  But
there isn't much going on other than the music.  Writer/director Maggie
Greenwald tries to pack too much feminist dogma into the story, which makes
the whole thing seem like a heavy-handed message film.  So what if Lily was
passed over for a job in favor of a man who was more qualified but happened
to be an outsider?  Maybe if she spent more time on her career and less time
under her married superior, she would have received the promotion.  Or at
least a little sympathy.
The feminist territory isn't much of a surprise, as Greenwald's previous
(and only other) film was The Ballad of Little Jo, which basically was a
Western version of Boys Don't Cry.  And it's too bad, because Songcatcher
has the potential to be a big crowd-pleaser (it even won a Special Jury
Prize for Ensemble Cast at this year's Sundance Film Festival).  McTeer does
what she can with her poorly written (and, at times, unlikeable) role, but
the true standout is young Emmy Rossum, who plays one of Elna's musically
gifted students.
1:49 - PG-13 for sexual content and an intense scene of childbirth

SONGCATCHER, written and directed by Maggie Greenwald, is a charming film that
could almost be a Hallmark Hall of Fame television movie given its Norman
Rockwell brand of folksy Americana.  Hallmark, however, would probably not be
comfortable with the amount of implicit sex going on and would want to cut short
the songs which fill almost every scene.  The film was a hit at 2000's Sundance
Film Festival.  It's an unusual picture, essentially a musical of folk ballads. 
It may not have much a narrative drive, but it sure can carry a tune.  
The story, set in the early 1900s, concerns a Doctor of Music, Dr. Lily Penleric
(Janet McTeer, TUMBLEWEEDS), who takes a leave from her university when she is
passed over again for a full professorship.  A feminist, she bitterly resents
the sexual discrimination.  Even the married professor with whom she has been
having an affair voted against her.  She's a modern woman with a sophisticated
set of values who believes in sexual freedom among heterosexuals.  Only her
sister's lesbianism troubles her.  Jane Adams (HAPPINESS) plays her sister, Elna
Penleric.  It is to Elna's school high up in the mountains to which Lily goes
for her break.
While in the mountains, Lily makes an incredible discovery for a musicologist
like herself.  She finds that the locals sing a pure version of old English folk
ballads.  She takes it upon herself to write down the songs and to record them
on cylinders.  Resenting "outlanders" like Lily, the mountain folks, especially
Tom Bledsoe (Aidan Quinn), at first are leery of having anything to do with her.
 Tom figures that she is "exploiting" them and "stealing" their music.  Yep, you
guessed it.  The liberal Lily will soon be shedding her clothes for Tom.
The movie is best when it lets the music flow, which is most of the time.  The
songs, both romantic and tragic, are uniformly lovely, regardless of the singing
ability of the person singing them.  Less effective are the moments when the
movie tries to go on message.  In one of these clichÃ©d moments, Ambrose
McFarland (Steve Boles), the wealthy head of the coal company, which is trying
to buy the land for fifty cents an acre, doesn't believe in the importance of
Elna's school.  "Educating these savages is a waste of money," he says.  Later
he offers a huge donation to the school anyway but only as a ruse to get what he
wants.
A movie like this that is built with a collection of little incidents has
trouble ending.  The dramatic incident that Greenwald comes up with is a bit too
easy to foretell and is allowed to occur too easily by those involved.  But the
story has to end somehow, and the way Greenwald chooses is reasonable even if
not especially inspired.  SONGCATCHER leaves you in a state of bliss as the
music floats through your mind like a billowy cloud on a lazy summer day.
SONGCATCHER runs 1:52.  It is rated PG-13 for sexual content and an intense
scene of childbirth and would be acceptable for kids around 11 or 12 and up.
The film is playing in limited release now in the United States.  In the Silicon
Valley, it is showing at the Camera Cinemas.
