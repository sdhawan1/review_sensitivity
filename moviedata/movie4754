   Question: "How do you know when a lawyer is lying?" 
Answer: "When you see his lips moving."  This gag, narrated
soon after the opening scene of Francis Ford Coppola's
adaptation of John Grisham's book, sums up the novelist's   
attitude toward the legal profession.  Grisham, who was easily
able to give up his day job as an attorney when he turned to
writing about the responsibility, is cynical almost to the point
of hopelessness.  What saves him from despair is his
conviction that somewhere out there you can find
professionals of integrity who do not lie each time they move
their lips and juries who are justifiably incensed enough to
mete out justice.  
   In the hands of director Coppola, "The Rainmaker," given
the appropriate time of two hours and fifteen minutes, must
still come up short on some of the story's subplots, most
expressly in the case of an elderly woman who pretends to
have a small fortune put away which, she insists, will go to
her children only if they treat her right in her declining years. 
But Coppola more than makes up for this omission by playing
up the humor in what is at base a tale of pathos involving a
twenty-two-year old man who is dying of leukemia, a kid who
could have been saved if his medical insurance policy
approved his family's claim.  "The Rainmaker" features a
stellar cast with Danny De Vito providing most of the yocks,
young and relatively unknown Matt Damon eliciting audience
cheers and good will, and Jon Voight as the big, bad,
corporate attorney absolutely full of himself as he brings his
enormous skills and experience to bear against a poor
Memphis woman whose son in slipping into death.
   To Coppola's credit this tale, which could have been
hammered home with all the hysteria of a mega-
melodrama, is played out low-key almost as though the trial
scenes were taking place as cinema verite.  The story is
peppered throughout with Michael Herr's narration of the
budding views of the twenty-four-year-old Rudy Baylor (Matt
Damon), who has just graduated from law school and is
looking for his first job.  Landing a position with a shady firm
of ambulance chasers bossed by "Bruiser" Stone (Mickey
Rourke), he learns quickly that he needs not chase
ambulances unless he has a penchant for eating.  Opening
scenes feature Danny DeVito in scenes that could have come
out of "Critical Care," as Deck Schifflet (DeVito) and his new
associate Rudy hustle about a local Memphis hospital looking
for accident cases to take on.
   While the principal action involves the lawsuit by Rudy
Baylor's sprouting legal office against an insurance company
which has a policy of refusing virtually all claims, there is an
ample diversity of smaller accounts to keep the audience
busy, the most melodramatic of which involves the young and
pretty Kelly Riker (Claire Danes) who is regularly beaten up
by her husband.  Baylor's relationship with the hapless and
mousy woman provides the right romantic touch and is
treated with subtlety and good taste.
   Jon Voight is particularly dependable as the big-shot lawyer
who tries every tactic to squelch the plaintiff's case of
wrongful death while Mickey Rourke, in a solid, over-the-top
performance, demonstrates the sleaze of an attorney whose
fumbling little law firm is just a front for mob activity.  Matt
Damon operates in a role that could have gone to Matthew
McCannaughey, Damon's youth and inexperience providing
the proper feel of a young urban professional who will have a
very tough time ever duplicating the success he enjoys in his
very first test.
   "The Rainmaker" is not noted particularly for saying
anything new or for subverting audience prejudices against
shyster lawyers and corporate evils, but what it says comes
across in a crisp professional style under Coppola's direction
and provides "The Rainmaker" with a solid story ably told.
Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 135 minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey

        THE RAINMAKER carries on the tradition of transforming 
John Grisham novels into big screen blockbusters. This one, though, 
leans less toward the early Grisham action thrillers like THE FIRM 
and THE PELICAN BRIEF and more toward the courtroom drama 
of A TIME TO KILL and THE CHAMBER. It's about a young, white-
bread lawyer who overcomes the odds and scores a victory for the 
less fortunate, and it's preachy as hell. However, with director 
Francis Ford Coppola at the helm of a large, likeable cast, THE 
RAINMAKER refuses to sink under the weight and predictability of 
the storyline.
        Matt Damon is the hero this time around, just out of law 
school and cramming for the bar exam. He takes a job with a shyster 
(Mickey Rourke) who sets his lawyers up on a commission basis and 
sends them out to chase ambulances. Damon learns the ropes from 
an older, wiser, unlicensed associate (Danny DeVito) and gets his 
first clients, an old lady changing her will (Teresa Wright) and a 
not-as-old lady (Mary Kay Place) whose son is dying of leukemia.
        Just as Rourke gets nailed by the FBI and Damon passes the 
bar, he and DeVito partner up to form their own unholy alliance. 
Claire Danes comes along at about the same time, as a young 
woman whose husband put her in the hospital. Hers is the 
predictable subplot that will haunt the movie until the end, as 
Damon falls in love with her, she leaves him and they decide to go 
back and get her stuff. I assume this sidebar was trimmed greatly 
from the novel, but in the Cliffs Notes version THE RAINMAKER 
movie affords us, we see enough to know this is the same old Wife-
Beater Gets His plotline with no new twists.
        It's the Corporate America Gets Theirs plotline that most of 
THE RAINMAKER is concerned with. The leukemia kid bites the 
dust and the family sues the insurance company for wrongful death. 
The company denied their claim eight times, so he missed his 
treatment. There are plenty of courtroom scenes, much less 
sophisticated than we're used to, where young Damon has to orient 
himself to court procedures and fight off the high-paid insurance 
company attorney team (led by a sneering Jon Voight). It's never in 
doubt what the eventual outcome will be and which surprise witness 
will bring it.
        As I've maintained these last four paragraphs, the plot is 
weak, and the constant sermonizing against both the legal 
profession and the e-e-e-evil insurance companies only makes the 
movie less appealing, but thankfully, the actors trapped in this story 
bring their own charm. There's a lot more humor than you might 
expect, particularly from DeVito and the two judges in the case 
(Dean Stockwell and Danny Glover), so the movie is worth 
watching, but on the whole, it's a low-rent A TIME TO KILL.

Paramount release. 137 min. PG-13.
John Grisham is a best-selling novelist and, to borrow from film language,
an "auteur" in the narrow sense, as he specializes in one genre (legal
yarns) the way X does in horror or Y in romance. But he is no writer. His
prose lacks style and nuances, his characters have to struggle to reach two
dimensions.
He was lucky to have Francis Coppola write and direct "The Rainmaker."
Coppola's script cuts out many of the repetitions and subplots of the book,
streamlines, smoothes it without oversimplifying it, improves it
significantly.
The film comes at the heels of another lawyer movie, "The Devil's Advocate"
in which lawyers are devils and vice versa --literally. It is done in silly
ways that use the supernatural as a facile alibi. "The Rainmaker" sticks to
much more convincing and affecting realism.
Matt Damon plays Rudy Baylor, who worked his way through a lesser  law
school, finished and found a job in Memphis with a sleazy lawyer with
underworld contacts,  Bruiser Stone (Mickey Rourke). Bruiser's office  is
in character, with a minimal law Library but a tank of sharks.
Flat broke Rudy, evicted from his apartment, using his jalopy as home, must
do his tasks for Bruise yet also study for his bar exams, which he does in
a bar owned by Bruise (a good verbal gag) and later in the cafeteria of a
hospital.
Usually, Rourke's presence guarantees a picture's worthlessness, but here
he is beautifully cast. His legman-assistant is Deck Schiffler (Danny
DeVito), ex-salesman, law graduate, record holder in failing the bar exams
--six times. An ambulance-chasing con-man par excellence, he is amoral
rather than immoral. Matters of conscience as as alien to him as a bottle
of Chateau Latour would be to a Dr. Pepper drinker. He is even oddly
likable and very, very funny.
Rudy may sound like an idealist by lawyeresque standards, yet he is simply
a decent youth with respect for the law and warmth for fellow humans. His
duties send him to one main case, that of the Black family, humble people
whose son is dying from leukemia because the huge insurance firm Great
Benefit has refused coverage and claims, not once but eight times.
Rudy passes the bar exams, Bruiser disappears when the Feds get after him,
Rudy and "paralegal" Deck form a threadbare partnership. The two nothings
take on the insurance giant and its phalanx of platinum-plated lawyers led
by the remorseless, semi-oily, clever, experienced, influential Leo
Drummond, whom Jon Voight plays to the nasty hilt but without cliched
caricaturing.
The film's core is the battle royal between David Rudy and Goliath Great
Benefit. I will not give away the twists , turns , twists within turns of
the fight's strategies, a far cry from a mere Biblical slingshot. I could
not reveal the plot in any case, as it is convoluted and requires a
viewer's concentration. Its essence is a powerful expose of enormous scams
of the kinds that are all around us. Rudy turns into an investigative
sleuth ,a muckracker (a splendid word, often misunderstood) akin to those
who have made "60 Minutes" on CBS the most facinating and needed program of
its kind.
DeVito is terrific as he  both lightens and advances the film with comic
relief. Coppola had lightened the structure of the plot with his cuts. Yet
he still retained the character of  Kelly (Claire Danes), a horribly and
regularly beaten up woman --by a beast of a "loving" yet deranged husband.
She and Rudy meet at the hospital cafeteria where he retreats to study. You
guesse the rest. But as the de developments in Kelly's case are quite
complex, the film can only sketch them out. I think it might have survived
more smoothly had this "de rigeur" Hollywoodian boy-meets-girl entirely
excised.
Lone Rudy,innocent in the ways of lawyering, forms personal attachments
with his cases. This is less of a problem with Miss Birdie, a charmingly
pixillated old lady (Teresa Wright, 25 and unforgettable in Hitchcock's
"Shadow of a Doubt," 79 now). She wants to cut out her relatives from her
will and leave everything to a TV preacher, a phony, we surmise  Rudy
gently retorts that the man is well provided for. She replies that he has
much overhead and besides "his jet is getting old." When Miss Birdie's
sleazy son and wife come from Florida, he sells them the story that the
Miss Birdie is wealthy. Pronto, they switch from despising her to fawning.
So much of the film is under the sign of sleaze. The first judge we meet
(played by Dean Stockwell) is sleazy in his way. So are the elegant
"suits,"the lawyers, and the insurance company's casually chic CEO (Roy
Scheider). But the women are not --and this comes organically, naturally,
not as a sop to feminism.
All the actors are perfectly cast and give marvelously good performances
-both Coppola hallmarks. Among the thespians: Red West  (the desperate,
alcoholic father of the dying young man), Mary Kay Place (the mother),
Johnny Whitworth (their son), Virginia Madsen(a witness), etc. Danny
Glover, the new judge, comes from a civil rights, pro-underdog background.
He has natural elegance, a discreet yet formidable presence, a faint but
clear twinkle in his eyes, and the talent to skew some issues gently when
he judges them to serve justice best.
The players would not have been so good without Coppola's guidance. The
bashing of corporate America and its minions does not have to be heavily
underlined. The mere presence of  humane, morally clean young Rudy does it.
By opposing the lawyer-sharks, Rudy is not so much a knight in shining
armor as he is the decent exception that confirms the rule.

After many exciting court thrillers, it comes as somewhat of a
surprise that The Rain Maker is a tame yet well acted drama.  John
Grisham and director Francis Ford Coppola have been careful not to
throw in more than its simplistic plot can handle, and although The
RainMaker is not as spectacular as A Time to Kill or The Pelican
Brief, its a much more complete film in many regards.
Rising Hollywood star Matt Damon plays Rudy Baylor, an inexperienced
young lawyer who teams up with Deck Shifflet (Danny DeVito) to bring a
shoddy insurance company to justice.  Along the way he encounters
problems with staying financially secure, protecting a troubled friend
from her violent husband and becoming recognized in a town swamped
with money hungry lawyers.
After being employed by known sleaze Bruiser Stone (Mickey Rourke),
Rudy and Deck quit their job and start small law firm of their own.
Rudy soon finds himself relying on a solitary court case to get them
through the threat of bankruptcy, and battles high-class lawyer Leo
F. Drummond (Jon Voight) to fight for what is morally correct.
With a mixed cast of young and old Hollywood players, it comes as a
disappointment that no real climax ever eventuates; and although this
well acted drama is of fine tune and taste this alone is not enough to
make it a great film.  A worth while watch, yes, and although nothing
here is ground making material, The RainMaker has enough substance and
interest to make it a successful court drama.

Based on the John Grisham novel of the same name, it is the story of
how one insurance company does not honor legitimate claims by its
policy holders.  With the exception of John Voight who is Drummond,
the insurance company's thousand-dollar-per-hour attorney, the rest
of the cast is either wasted or engages in some very mediocre
acting.
The film's hero, Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon) is supposed to be a young
hotshot lawyer trying to make it big.   As portrayed by Damon,
however, he falls very short in that role.   He never comes across
as being real, as being a real attorney who knows what he is doing.
He does not compare with John Voight as a brainy attorney.  The
film's title refers to someone who aspires to be a great attorney
and make tons of money for any company that is smart enough to hire
him; no such company has done that in Baylor's present.
Danny DeVito, as a "para lawyer" who has not passed the bar, hams it
up something fierce to the point where he comes across as
ridiculous. In more or less cameo roles, the following are wasted:
Mary Kay Place, Claire Danes, Mickey Rourke, Danny Glover, Virginia
Madsen, Roy Scheider, Teresa Wright, Dean Stockwell and others.   I
shudder when I think of all the fine films those actors have been
in; this was certainly not one of them.
     The screenplay and direction are by Francis Ford Coppala, and
that is hard to believe, too

Jane Austen, Michael Crichton, and John Grisham. These are the authors whose
books consumed the world of 1990's cinema. Since 1993, Grisham has had six
novels turned into major motion pictures, and they've been relatively well
accepted by the movie-going public. Unfortunately, that's a trend that's been
on the downhill. THE CHAMBER was virtually unnoticed as it passed thru a brief
existance in movie theaters, and now comes JOHN GRISHAM'S THE RAINMAKER, which
is on about the same level both in terms of quality, and in the attention it's
receiving. Both are nothing to brag about.
Matt Damon stars as Rudy Baylor, a young, handsome lawyer on the verge of a
bar exam (in a John Grisham story? No way!). Starting out in Memphis under the
shady Bruiser Stone (Mickey Rourke), Rudy finds his natural good character
heavily conflictive with the proud ambulance chasers he works with. Danny
DeVito plays Deck Shiffler, Rudy's "tutor" whose six failed attempts at the
bar exam leaves him just this side of being a real lawyer. Nevertheless, Deck
shows Rudy the easy way to quick bucks, barging into hospital rooms and
refusing to take no for an answer, and Rudy, despite his integral ambitions,
falls into it very quickly.
The main conflict deals with Dot Black (Mary Kay Place), a middle aged woman
who loses her son to Leukemia. If the right steps had been taken, her son
might still be alive, but due to a less-than-honest insurance company, Dot
watched her son wither away. Rudy, a greeny, must take the powerful insurance
company, and its high-paid group of "old pro" lawyers (led by Jon Voight), to
court. On the sideline, we have an abused wife (Claire Danes) that Rudy seems
to be falling for, and Miss Birdie (Teresa Wright), an old woman who rents the
young lawyer a room, who intends to leave all her possessions to a TV-
evangelist when she dies.
Most of the acting in this film feels too staged. Place is melodramatic
whereas Wright comes off like a stage actress (there is a difference between
acting in plays and movies, and the two don't mix!). DeVito gives it his all,
but being the talent he is, the role is almost too belittling of him (and I'm
not making a "short" joke at his expense). Voight plays an arrogant lawyer
quite well, but when the best acting comes from a meant-to-be despised
character, it's hard to get all excited. Danes has proven herself an
exceptional young star, and this role also doesn't do her justice. She's one
of the best things the film has, but once again, her character is too
frivolously used to make it an impressive stamp on her résumé. The surprise
winner here is the cameo-esque appearance by Danny Glover as Judge Tyrone
Kipler. Glover needed some brownie points after the horrendous GONE FISHIN',
and while THE RAINMAKER isn't a full redemption, it helps us forgive him just
enough.
Along with GOOD WILL HUNTING, THE RAINMAKER is Matt Damon's ticket to
notoriety, but let me assure you, GOOD WILL HUNTING is definitely the
flatterer. In fact, I saw that one before I saw THE RAINMAKER, and seeing THE
RAINMAKER was a sad disappointment after such an impressive performance. Damon
grows into the character of Rudy Baylor, but for the first while, he struggles
to pull it off (as well as his less-than-perfect southern accent). He's one to
watch, but he should also pick his roles more carefully. Playing a young,
cocky, streetwise kid from the poor side of Boston is much more up his alley
than a young, timid, southern lawyer.
Francis Ford Coppola, once a very impressive name as a director, is taking too
many wrong turns with films like this and the below-average JACK (he also
wrote the script for THE RAINMAKER). He's not bad, but he's not great, and
when people are paying more and more money to get into theaters, great is more
what to aim for. THE RAINMAKER almost seems hastily made, and the end result
is a film that won't be remembered in much detail two days after you've seen
it. Unlike every other Grisham-novel movie, THE RAINMAKER lacks any suspense
(THE FIRM, THE PELICAN BRIEF, THE CLIENT) or any emotional stirring (A TIME TO
KILL, THE CHAMBER). The only thing that gives this film two and a half stars
is the courtroom finale. Although we've seen it over and over before, it's
still fun to watch the underdog work his way thru an impossible trial. Like I
said, it's not emotional or suspenseful, but it is interesting. Not
captivating, not intriguing, just interesting. And when you've paid six bucks
to get in and sat there for two hours waiting to see what happens, you'll be
more than thankful.

The Rainmaker is an utterly predictable film. With that said, I have to
tell you that I really loved The Rainmaker. Being predictable is a small
flaw that is easily overlooked because of it being a well-directed,
well-acted, and fun movie.
Having come out of seeing the last courtroom drama, Red Corner, The
Rainmaker comes as a surprise to how it handles the courtroom scenes. Which
is to say the courtroom scenes are put at a minimum while the personal side
of the lawyers is shown more. This easily takes away most of the cliched
courtroom scenes (the surprise witness, the talking killer, etc) and
introduces a warmth to a courtroom/legal system film.
Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon) is newly out of law school. He joins up with a
firm that is, unbeknownst to him, dirty and is headed up by a scoundrel
lawyer, Bruiser Stone (Mickey Rourke). While in the firm he has two cases
that he continues to pursue from a law workshop, the big one is what the
film concentrates on, but the smaller one is not overlooked either.
The enemy in The Rainmaker is an insurance company. Rudy's first big case
is for a young man with leukemia fighting against the big insurance
company. On the side he has a smaller case of writing a will for an elderly
lady. And while at a hospital trying to field clients he meets and
inevitably falls in love with a married and abused woman (Claire Daines).
All these plot lines work well together during the film, and each touch the
other in one way or another.
As the cops and a Federal probe gets closer and closer to Rudy's dirty boss
Bruiser, Rudy and Deck (Danny DeVito) take a wad of cash that Bruiser gives
them and they start up their own law firm. What is nice is that the
courtroom scenes are not "played up" for drama. Ford Coppola actually lets
the two, Rudy and Deck, act nervous in court, and this puts a good
down-to-earth spin to the courtroom scenes.
There is an added touch of comic relief that is added to The Rainmaker this
makes the movie so much better than the average courtroom drama. The
Rainmaker is not a comedy in any sense, but Ford Coppola is able to insert
these small moments to get a laugh out of the audience.
There are some pretty big names in this film and they go from small parts
to big parts. There are three big name stars in The Rainmaker that I loved
the best. The first is a major role and that is Danny DeVito as Deck, the
legal assistant to Rudy. Deck has tried the bar exam six times, but has yet
to pass. Though at times it seems that Deck knows more than Rudy, who has
passed the bar. DeVito gives a great performance in The Rainmaker. The
second big name performance that I loved was that of Danny Glover as the
judge Tyrone Kipler. Though Glover's part is small, he does a wonderful job
with it, and he is just a joy to see on the screen again (I last saw him in
Switchback). Last but not least is Jon Voight as the high paid scummy lead
lawyer serving for the insurance company. Voight who I last saw overacting
in the horrible Most Wanted, redeems himself here in The Rainmaker. His
performance as the lead lawyer, Leo F. Drummond, is brilliant, and you can
just seem the slim dripping off of him.
But, the real star of The Rainmaker is Matt Damon as Rudy. Damon gives a
wonderful performance as Rudy and as the film is setup he has a lot of
performing to do. His part is the center of the film, and the film is
basically a character study of his character. Damon does wonderfully in his
part, and I hope to see him in more films soon.
The music by Elmer Bernstein is strange, but it most definitely fits the
movie in most places. It changes moods constantly and consistently with the
action on the screen, but for me the score sometimes sounded out of place.
After seeing a slew of bad films this fall, I'm happy to say that The
Rainmaker is great movie. It is highly entertaining and though somewhat
flawed it shouldn't be missed because it is well-directed, well-acted, and
just plain fun. Don't Miss this film.

Written by: 
Francis Ford Coppola, adapted from the novel by John Grisham
Starring: 
Matt Damon, Claire Danes, Danny DeVito, Jon Voight, and Danny Glover
Ingredients: 
neophyte lawyer, legal situations, corrupt insurance company,
Synopsis: 
Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon) is an ethical kid fresh out of law school who
must juggle three legal situations at the same time. Rudy's girlfriend
is attacked by her violent husband; Rudy's elderly landlady wants to
arrange her will so that her children are excluded, and; the family of
Rudy's friend with leukemia is suing the corrupt insurance company that
wouldn't pay for a bone marrow transplant. Rudy is new to being a lawyer
and is thoroughly outgunned, but luckily he is aided by a sleazy
ambulance chaser (Danny Devito) who has failed the bar exam six times as
well as by the kindly presiding judge (Danny Glover). Jon Voight plays
Leo F. Drummond, the intimidating and arrogant leader of the
all-powerful insurance company's team of lawyers who will do anything to
oppose justice. Will Rudy defeat Leo? Will he enjoy being a lawyer?
Opinion: 
The good news is that this movie has a happy ending, and it features a
guy trying to do the right thing. Director Francis Ford Coppola does
this film a little differently than the stereotypical law movie. In the
typical lawyer movie there's one big case and the movie focuses on
solving it, and somewhere along the line surprise witnesses and motives
turn up before the good guy wins (after lots of gripping courtroom
drama). However, Coppola's movie is deliberately more low key. 'The
Rainmaker' plays out like a personality sketch of young Rudy as he gets
emotionally involved with and tries to save various little quirky side
characters. In the background Rudy's voice narrates his feelings and
makes half-cynical jokes about the legal profession in general. Two
factors combine to make this movie less heavy than it can be. First,
Rudy's time is split juggling three cases, rather than concentrating on
a single high-stakes case. Also, Rudy's use of voice narration in place
of acting makes the film lose some of its dramatic edge. The end result
is an entertaining low key law movie where the good guys win, and Rudy
narrates his way into coming of age.

JOHN GRISHAM'S THE RAINMAKER (1997)
Matt Damon, Danny DeVito, Jon Voight, Claire Danes, Mary Kay Place
PG-13, 2 stars
Review by Ed Johnson-Ott
For more reviews, go to www.nuvo-online.com and click on "film."
All of the elements for a can't-miss film were there. A David vs. Goliath 
story about an idealistic young man battling corrupt lawyers and a 
soulless insurance company, directed by the legendary Francis Ford 
Coppola from his screenplay of John Grisham's best-selling novel. Yet, 
"The Rainmaker" is a major disappointment, a self-righteous exercise in 
audience manipulation that chokes on its own smugness. While the film 
retains some pleasures, Coppola's heavy-handed direction snuffs out the 
sense of exhilaration a story like this should have.   
The first hint of trouble comes from the official title, "John Grisham's 
The Rainmaker." The prolific Grisham has become a brand name, and 
whenever Hollywood slaps an author's name onto the title of a film, it's 
safe to expect the worst. Think of "Stephen King's Graveyard Shift," 
"Jacqueline Susann's Once Is Not Enough" or "Sidney Sheldon's Bloodline" 
and you'll get the idea. 
The story, while not exactly earth shaking, is durable enough. Recent 
Memphis law-school graduate Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon,) idealistic and 
eager to work, reluctantly hooks up with Bruiser Stone (Mickey Rourke,) a 
sleazeball lawyer who keeps a live shark in his office aquarium, lest we 
miss the other painfully obvious signs of his corruption. Stone pairs the 
kid with Deck Schifflet (Danny DeVito,) an ambulance-chaser who has 
failed the bar six times, and sets the pair off to troll for business at 
a local hospital, where Baylor meets Kelly Riker (Claire Danes,) a young 
woman whose husband batters her on a regular basis.
Refusing to adopt his employer's tactics, Baylor takes his own path, 
renting a room from Miss Birdie (Teresa Wright,) an elderly client 
looking to cut her money-grubbing kids out of her will, leaving her 
assets to a televangelist instead. "He needs the money," she explains, 
"Why, the upkeep on his jet alone costs a fortune." But Baylor's big case,
 and the centerpiece of the story, is a lawsuit against Great Benefit, an 
insurance company that specializes in shafting the poor. Donny Ray Black 
(Johnny Whitworth) is dying of leukemia and the company has flatly and 
repeatedly denied his claims, climaxing in a letter to his mother (Mary 
Kay Place) rejecting the claim for the "final time" and calling her 
"stupid, stupid, stupid." So the inexperienced young Baylor and his 
ramshackle assistant head for court, defending a dying boy and his poor 
family against a battery of high-priced lawyers, hatchet men for an evil 
corporation. Any idea how the case will turn out? 
Fine, so its a obvious story with easy targets. Lots of memorable films 
have came from trite ideas. "Hoosiers" also told a David vs. Goliath tale,
 filled with every cliché in the book, yet that film succeeds while "The 
Rainmaker" flounders. Why? Because inexplicably, Francis Ford Coppola 
undermines the very film he is directing. Coppola's work here is so ham-
handed that it smothers the emotional impact of the story. Scenes of the 
corporate lawyers, led by Jon Voight, are painful studies in overkill. 
Coppola doesn't allow the bad guys even a hint of humanity. Instead, 
every shot shows them scowling, smirking or exchanging smug glances. They 
are nothing less than walking cartoons; watching them get their 
comeuppance carries about as much dramatic weight as seeing Yosemite Sam 
shoot himself in the foot. 
Then there is Danny DeVito's Deck Schifflet character. "The Rainmaker" is 
designed to give viewers vicarious kicks by watching an idealistic young 
man bring down an arrogant corporation by taking on their unethical 
lawyers, yet Schifflet's equally corrupt behavior is played for laughs. 
Schifflet is a bottom-feeder, but presented as just a lovable little 
scamp. His antics disrupt the film's dramatic flow and become 
increasingly annoying as the story trudges along.
Thank goodness for "The Rainmaker's" strong cast. Matt Damon is fine in 
the lead role. He underplays the part nicely, investing Baylor with an 
appealing blend of awkwardness and strength of character. DeVito gives a 
hearty performance as well, despite how his character is misused. Claire 
Danes does what she can as the abuse victim, although the whole story 
involving her character is treated as a sketchy footnote to the film, 
rather than a major secondary story. Teresa Wright is appealing as the 
flighty, but feisty Miss Birdie, but the real scene-stealer here is Mary 
Kay Place, with a resonant performance as the mother of the dying young 
man. 
Despite the best efforts of the cast, "The Rainmaker" packs little impact.
 Beyond all the problems with Coppola's direction, the simple truth is 
that you can find more inventive, better told stories than this by 
flipping on the TV and watching "Homicide," "Law & Order" or "The 
Practice." You may not get John Grisham's brand name, but you'll save $7.

Lawyers have a saying that goes something like this:  "The most
important thing you can do in a courtroom is show sincerity.  If you can
fake that, you've got it made."
Matt Damon stars in The Rainmaker as Rudy Baylor, a young, sincere,
idealistic lawyer fresh out of Memphis State Law School, entering the
cutthroat world of the legal profession.  He begins his career with a
golden opportunity:  a lawsuit filed by the Black family, who are
struggling with an evil, heartless insurance company for coverage of a
bone-marrow transplant for young Donny Ray Black.  The movie -- minus
some extraneous subplots -- is about how this inexperienced David
battles the mind-numbingly evil Goliath of health insurance.
The Rainmaker, adapted from the John Grisham novel, occupies a
black-and-white moral universe.  On one side, you have the brave family,
let by the gallant Donnie Ray, and represented by the young, sincere,
idealistic Baylor.  On the other side, you have the insurance company,
represented by a cadre of high-powered lawyers (led by Jon Voight).
Both the insurance company and the law firm occupy huge, well-appointed
office buildings, paid for by the poor, neglected policy holders who
spend good money on worthless health insurance.
The problem is that it's all a sham.  I don't care how much you hate
your HMO, but these conditions don't exist in the real world, they just
don't.  The Rainmaker has this problem:  its hero is a plaintiff's trial
attorney.  Attorneys -- especially plaintiff's personal injury lawyers
-- are not your standard heroes, they're much too flawed for that.  But
in order to make the hero likable, to make the audience root for him,
the script gives Damon all of the good moral qualities that there are,
and demonizes the opposition to the point of caricature and beyond.
Damon is good to his elderly landlord, his physically battered and
emotionally scarred girlfriend (Clare Danes), and sympathetic to his
clients.  But he's too good for his own good.
Damon has proven, with Good Will Hunting, that he's a fine actor, full
of passion and intensity.  Here, he's not given any opportunity to
shine:  his character is required to be sincere and polite, and that's
all.  There's no spark of energy in his performance:  he's singularly
listless.  The only clue that we get to what's going on in his head is
the voice-over narration, and even that's flat and dull.  Damon's not
bad in the movie -- he even gets the Southern accent down pat -- but
he's the victim of a one-dimensional screenplay.  I would have liked The
Rainmaker a whole lot better if Damon had been able to cut loose -- to
experiment with being bad and unethical and tempted by the Dark Side of
the law.
The other lawyers aren't much better.  Jon Voight is the lead trial
attorney for the evil insurance company -- which makes its money by
systematically denying every single claim on principle.  Voight is fine
as a sleazy, oily lawyer in the negotiation and discovery sequences, but
when he gets into the courtroom, he's as bad as he can be.  He foolishly
goads one of the jurors (Randy Travis) into attacking him during voir
dire.  He is harsh and angry to the grieving Mrs. Black (Mary Kay
Place).  He blusters and makes bad objections during the course of the
trial.  When the insurance company's CEO (Roy Scheider) makes a damaging
admission, he acts like someone has hit him in the solar plexus with the
butt end of a pool cue.  And finally, he delivers the worst closing
argument in the history of cinema film.  But he's not the worst lawyer
in the film:  Mickey Rourke, as Damon's sleazy employer, is a poorly
drawn cartoon of the worst lawyer stereotypes ever.
What saves The Rainmaker are two fine performances from veteran actor
Danny DeVito and veteran director Francis Ford Coppola.  DeVito supplies
the charming roguishness that Damon isn't allowed in this movie.  He
instructs the shocked Damon in the fine art of ambulance chasing, makes
sure that their battered office is swept for bugs, and generally applies
a counterpoint to the oppresive sense of decency and goodness that Damon
is forced into portraying.  When he spots a little kid with his arm in a
cast on the street, DeVito does the only thing he knows to do:  he hands
him his card just in case there's a possible lawsuit brewing.
Coppola really saves the day, though, by providing a pervasive sense of
presence.  The movie was shot on location in Memphis, and there was a
lot of careful thought that went into the places where the movie was
filmed and the casting of extras.  Rourke's combination law office and
honkytonk is a wonderful visual sight gag.  The down-at-the-heels houses
where Damon and the Black family live look like real people actually
live there.  The casting choices are excellent, too.  Mary Kay Place is
just right as as the beleaguered Dot Black.  Danny Glover has a couple
of nice moments as the trial judge.  The jury looks like a real jury,
the lawyers look like real lawyers, and Memphis looks like something
more than an anonymous concrete canyon.
Even the cars are just right.  There's a beat-up 50's vintage junker in
the back of the Black house where the father (who "ain't right") sits
and drinks.  Damon drives an equally junky hatchback filled with his
worldly possessions (it's a dead ringer for the one that I drove in law
school) -- and then moves up to an elderly blue Volvo.  (The opposition
lawyers drive sleek, German luxury cars -- another sign of their evil.)
The old adage in Hollywood used to be:  If you want to send a message,
call Western Union.  The Rainmaker is a "message movie", plain and
simple.  But if you're going to send a message, it might as well be on a
Hallmark card, right?  The Rainmaker is lucky to have actors like DeVito
and Damon, and especially lucky to have a director like Coppola, who
obviously cares enough to send his very best.  Unfortunately, it's not
quite good enough to save The Rainmaker from itself.

If there is one thing we can expect from a movie based on a John
Grisham novel it's star power. Tom Cruise , Julia Roberts , Gene Hackman
and Sandra Bullock have each had their turn portraying a John Grisham
character. Therefore it comes as a pleasant surprise that The Rainmaker
offers a cast of relative unknowns and some little seen actors. 
There is a lesson here: just because an actor costs 20 million it does
not mean he's worth his weight in gold. The cast of The Rainmaker is
like a breath of fresh air from a bunch of fresh faces. Matt Damon
donates a wonderful performance which will most likely kick his career
into overdrive. Heroic yet flawed , he is an imperfect hero , and
underdog for the audience to cheer for.
Mickey Rourke offers his usual quiet intensity and makes the most of
his five minutes of screen time. Clare Danes is the love interest /
battered wife / useless sub-plot only in the movie because people cannot
watch an entire movie without at least one scene of violence. 
Still , she is cute as a button so we can forgive our hero for
indulging his "knight in shining armor" side. Danny Devito is comic
relief , something that was missing from previous Grisham movies , Jon
Voight is incredibly sleazy , as usual. That's just the main cast ,
let's not forget an incredible supporting cast.
Danny Glover , Roy Schneider , the dying boy and his father whose names
i forget. Not one bad performance during the entire movie. Like in all
John Grisham movies the bad guys are , well , bad. First it was sleazy
lawyers , then a corrupt government and rapists...now we have insurance
companies. Ooooohh , my skin crawls at the mention of the name. 
It is always a good sign when viewers actually boo the bad guys. It
means we actually give a damn about their actions and the consequences
of these. Luckily , we have a lawyer fresh out of law school and an
assistant who flunked the class six times on the side of all that is
good and mom's apple pie. 
Shit. We're screwed. 
Actually they...well i won't give away the ending but it certainly
makes you hate the insurance companies even more. All in all , an
enjoyable movie with a dynamite cast...a cast that probably cost less
than two or three of those bugs in Starship Troopers.

Na Michael Crichton (bekend van "Sphere") is John Grisham de meest
gevraagde schrijver in Hollywood. Grisham, vooral bekend om z'n
rechtbankdrama's, had echter weinig te maken met Francis Ford Coppola's
nieuwste film "John Grisham's The Rainmaker". De titel mag misschien z'n
naam dragen, maar Coppola heeft aan het verhaal van Grisham 't ייn en
ander veranderd. Gelukkig is het basisidee nog gebleven. 
Rudy Baylor (de eerste hoofdrol van Matt Damon) is een pas afgestudeerde
advocaat, die z'n geluk komt beproeven bij Bruiser Stone (Mickey
Rourke), een nogal louche zakenman. Daar ontmoet hij ook Deck Shifflet
(Danny DeVito), ook een advocaat die al zes keer gezakt is en nog steeds
niet het recht heeft om voor z'n klanten op te treden. 
Al snel kunnen Baylor en Shifflet goed met elkaar opschieten. Stone
geeft Baylor een paar rechtszaken. Een paar dagen later komt Baylor
erachter dat Stone samen met z'n partner betrokken is in duistere zaken.
Shifflet, bang om in de gevangenis te belanden, besluit samen met Baylor
een eigen zaak op te richten. 
Eיn van Baylor's klanten, mevrouw Birdie (Teresa Wright), maakt zich
zorgen over haar testament. Zij wil namelijk al haar geld geven aan een
TV-dominee, omdat "z'n jet al zo oud is". Haar kinderen zijn daar
natuurlijk niet zo blij mee, maar gelukkig komt Baylor tussenbeide met
een smoesje. 
Een andere klant, Kelly Riker (Claire Danes), wordt regelmatig door haar
echtgenoot in elkaar geslagen en bewerkt met een aluminium
honkbalknuppel. Geen pretje dus, daarom biedt Baylor z'n hulp aan. Dit
wordt, samen met de derde klant, de meest persoonlijkste zaak voor hem. 
En die derde klant is Dot Black (Mary Kay Place), wiens zoon aan een
ernstige vorm van leukemie lijdt. Black heeft al acht keer claims naar
haar verzekeringsmaatschappij Great Benefit gestuurd, maar Great Benefit
weigert Black's zoon een behandeling te geven. Baylor wordt ingeschakeld
en leert de familie goed kennen. 
"The Rainmaker" is een erg mooie en persoonlijke film, wat te danken is
aan Francis Ford Coppola. Coppola laat, in tegenstelling tot eerdere
verfilmingen van Grisham (zoals "The Firm" en "The Chamber"), de
menselijke kant van de advocaat zien en hoe hij z'n leven doorbrengt. Er
zijn prachtige rollen van Damon (nu een superster geworden met "Good
Will Hunting"), DeVito (alhoewel een beetje tweedimensionaal) en Voight,
die overtuigend gestalte geeft aan Leo F. Drummond, de advocaat van
Great Benefit. Hij kreeg er terecht een Golden Globe-nominatie voor. 
Verwacht geen film waarbij je achterover kan leunen en relaxed het
verhaal kan volgen, want "The Rainmaker" bevat een complex verhaal.
Daarom is deze film niet zo toegankelijk voor iedereen. Ook had de film
gerust een kwartier korter mogen duren. Ondanks deze opmerkingen, moet
je "The Rainmaker" gaan zien. Dit is, zonder twijfel, de beste Grisham
verfilming tot nu toe.

As it moves from one scene to the next, 'The Rainmaker' contains no real
surprises.  What it does have is marvelous acting by the entire cast, some
of whom are underwritten and others that we don't see enough.  Directed by
Francis Ford Coppola and written by Coppola himself based on John Grisham's
book it reminded me of those films Coppola made from 1981 to 1990 that were
very low key but mildly effective and primarily well acted. Among them, 'The
Outsiders', 'Rumble Fish', 'Peggy Sue Got Married' and 'Gardens of 
Stone' spring to mind first.  They were made when Coppola dropped 'Ford'
from his full name and went by the credit Francis Coppola.  Only 'The
Godfather Part III' and Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' have stood out in the 1990's
for Coppola. 
Set in Memphis, Tennessee, 'The Rainmaker' is about a low-income family who
sue a gigantic insurance company for fraud and later wrongful death when
their son develops leukemia and can't get a bone marrow transplant because
the family's insurance claim for funding it is denied.  The attorney
representing them is a young and inexperienced newcomer to the legal
profession (Matt Damon) who is trying his first case.  His assistant is a
man who knows the law pretty well but strangely enough has failed the bar
exam exam six times (Danny DeVito). 
The lawyer representing the insurance company is a cold and calculating
smoothy acted in high capacity by Jon Voight who shines as the best villain
in a courtroom since James Mason in 1982's 'The Verdict'.  The courtroom
scenes are realistic and convincing as the usual legal motions are accepted
and declined and the twists in momentum from side to side make it hard to
figure out how things will be resolved. 
The ending is not as clear cut as you might predict and the only thing that
took 
away from the film's major enjoyment is a sub plot involving Damon's
relationship with a young woman (Claire Danes) who is caught in an abusive
relationship with a husband who almost kills her.  I felt this served as a
serious distraction from the film's overall impact involving the trial.
Another handicap for the film is the under played and under written part
DeVito plays in this movie.  He is a reasonably good actor if the right part
is there and he is not used to his full potential here.  Although it is
never moving but a film that deserves to be respected, 'The Rainmaker' is no
classic but does have a good performance from its lead in Matt Damon and
Coppola proves again that his demand for first rate casting will not be
compromised.

     Welcome back to John Grisham's world, where the lawyers are
slimeballs, and the businessmen are crooks.  (The movie's modest title
is JOHN GRISHAM'S THE RAINMAKER.)  In Grisham novels, there is always
one idealistic lawyer fighting the system.  Here we get two, sort of.
One, Deck Shiffler, played hilariously by Danny DeVito, has flunked the
bar exam six times already.  Although not yet, or maybe ever, a real
lawyer, he still chases ambulances with the best of them but has a
heart of gold nevertheless.
     Matt Damon gives a lethargic performance as the crusading, but
broke lawyer named Rudy Baylor.  (Grisham, himself a non-practicing
lawyer, always dichotomizes the legal profession into a large group of
rich, evil lawyers and a smaller cadre of poor, honest ones.)  One
could argue that Damon's shallow acting in the movie reflects his
character's legal abilities, but if Damon had not had such a sterling
supporting cast, his acting would have almost destroyed the movie.
     Since screenwriter and director Francis Coppola makes extensive
use of voice-over by Damon, we get to hear large doses of his sad
voice.  Elmer Bernstein has loud violin's wailing and the flutes
sobbing during these narrations to remind you how noble our young
lawyer is.  It is easy to listen to the pretentious soundtrack and
convince yourself that Rudy must be some modern-day Gandhi.
     Evicted from his apartment, Rudy goes to work for a legal low-life
who goes by the charming moniker of Bruiser Stone.  With jeweled cuff
links and small, dark glasses, Mickey Rourke is almost unrecognizable
as a gravel voiced Bruiser.  Bruiser's having a bit of a disagreement
with the Feds over a money laundering scheme but tries to take a little
time to mentor Rudy, his young protege, in the art of making a fast
buck by signing up as many clients as possible.
     Rudy only has three clients.  One is a battered wife, played
touchingly by Claire Danes.  Rudy, showing good taste if foolhardiness,
falls in love with this client and goes way beyond all legal ethics.
This, of course, is okay since it is for a good cause.
     Another client is a rich widow, who actually isn't rich at all.
She wants him to rewrite her will so she can cut out all of her
good-for-nothing kids and give her fortune instead to a television
preacher whose jet needs replacement.
     It is the other case that gets the show in gear.  Mary Kay Place
plays a poor woman, Dot Black, with a son dying of leukemia.  Although
he could have been saved by a bone marrow transplant, Great Benefit
Life has been denying her claims.  In the company's last letter one of
its Vice Presidents wrote her, "We now deny it for the eighth and final
time.  You must be stupid, stupid, stupid!"  Needless to say, Rudy and
Deck jump for joy at receiving such valuable evidence as this
unequivocal letter.
     As the Great Benefit's lead attorney, Jon Voight gives one of his
best performances in a long time as Leo F. Drummond, the lawyer with
tasseled Guccis and a team of expensive backup men.
     After a slow start the movie takes off dramatically once it gets
to the courtroom.  Although the case is initially assigned to one of
Drummond's buddies, a judge played by Dean Stockwell, it gets switched
to a new judge named Tyrone Kipler.  An ex-civil rights attorney, Judge
Kipler is played with just the right level of restrained humor by Danny
Glover.
     Deck accurately characterizes their adversary.  "Great Benefit is
like a bad slot machine," he claims.  "It never pays off."  But with
the appointment of Judge Kipler, Deck is jubilant.  "You remember what
a Rainmaker is, kid?"  Deck asks Rudy.  "The bucks are going to start
falling from the sky."  And when their client dies as everyone knows he
will, Deck can barely contain his euphoria.  "Now, it's a wrongful
death suit -- Gazillions!" he effuses.
     By the end JOHN GRISHAM'S THE RAINMAKER becomes a thoroughly
delightful piece of entertainment.  You'll probably guess most of the
twists in the story, but you'll have fun watching them anyway.
Voight's reptilian performance alone is worth the price of admission.
     JOHN GRISHAM'S THE RAINMAKER runs too long at 2:14.  It is rated
PG-13 for violence and some profanity.  The movie would be fine for
kids around eleven and up.

*** (out of 4) You never know what to expect from Coppola: sometimes you
get a great film and sometimes you get JACK. THE RAINMAKER is an
above-average courtroom drama. It is a good, solid, well-made movie.
It's no classic, but it's worth seeing. 
This is the sixth big-screen adaptation of a John Grisham novel. In this
outing, the young Memphis lawyer is Rudy Baylor, played by Matt Damon.
Rudy is just out of law school and looking for work. He finds it in the
shady law office of "Bruiser" Stone (that's Mickey Rourke, believe it or
not) who's under investigation by the FBI. 
Bruiser agrees to hire Rudy on the condition that he recruit his own
clients. Rudy just happens to have two cases that he landed from a
school open-house event. One of the cases turns out to be big; a
leukemia patient, Donnie Ray Black (Johnnie Whitworth) and his mother
file a lawsuit against a crooked insurance company for denying their
legitimate claim. 
One night Rudy and his legal assistant Deck Shiffler (Danny DeVito)
discuss their future with Bruiser's law firm. They decide that the FBI
is getting too serious and that the heat will be too great at Bruiser's
offices, so they take their cases and leave the firm, just in the nick
of time. Now on their own, they bring Great Benefit Insurance and its
five lawyers to court. In the outstanding performance of the movie, Jon
Voight is Leo Drummond, the high-paid, slick, confident power lawyer of
the defense team. Coppola gave Drummond enough smarts and clout to match
Voight's performance. The role could have easily been under-written and
over-played, but the actor and the role were tailored to suit each
other. 
Most of the movie follows the specifics of the court case from beginning
to end, and that in itself is an interesting twist. Seems like most
so-called courtroom dramas dedicate lots of screen time to the crime and
the out-of-court implications; then they end with a big climax in the
courtroom. THE RAINMAKER actually follows the courtroom story for most
of the movie. 
But there are subplots. In an inept attempt at ambulance-chasing, Rudy
meets and falls for Kelly Riker (the sweet, likeable Claire Danes) who
is the victim of spousal abuse. Another subplot involves Rudy's other
case, an old woman, his landlord (Teresa Wright), who wants to rewrite
her will to exclude family and include a Texas televangelist. 
These subplots really were subservient to the main story line. Though
they were interwoven, they existed separately. They never really touched
on the main plot. They added a nice texture to the movie, but I often
felt the cross-cutting was labored and unmotivated. 
Also, I question the intent of making Kelly the victim of abuse. The way
the movie dealt with her husband was to violently hate him, much the
same way the movie made you feel about the insurance company. All of
Rudy's dialogue regarding Kelly's husband is talk of murderous revenge.
I suppose in that way, this movie is similar toSTARSHIP TROOPERS, which
takes pleasure in the extermination of its villains. But where the
hatred in STARSHIP TROOPERS was ironic and distanced, in THE RAINMAKER
it is "righteous." I think that's probably worse for society. (Is this a
trend in movies of the late nineties - to make the audience feel good
about killing? Are they sating our demand for public executions?) 
Still, these scenes didn't detract from the experience; they played a
small enough part, and they fit in with the movie's overall feel. 
If there was anything that was wrong with THE RAINMAKER, it was that the
movie's conflict was too easy. The insurance company was too cruel and
the victims too sympathetic for there to be any question of the outcome.
The movie left no room for any real debate on health care, insurance, or
tort reform. For example, a memo from the insurance company was written
by an employee having a bad day. The letter calls the claimant "stupid,
stupid, stupid." If that weren't enough, the letter is read aloud about
four times in the movie, and at one point, it fills the movie screen. 
That's not to say that the movie wasn't satisfying - what could be more
satisfying than the defeat of a melodramatic villain? But it means you
won't want to see the movie more than once, and you probably won't
remember it in five years. 
But for here and now, it's not a bad way to spend a couple of hours.
It's a solid, well-made courtroom drama that actually spends a lot of
time in court.

They're ever-present. Every day goes by and someone cracks a joke about
them. We loathe them more than anything else in the world and there are more
bad jokes about them than the Catholic Church.
They're lawyers. Those three-piece suit wearers of Armani who make upwards
of a hundred dollars an hour. And they're the one sect of society that is
universally hated and takes pride in it.
And, with every novel and every film made out of them, John Grisham makes us
love them.
In the newest, best, and most interesting John Grisham book adapted to the
screen we see a rarity -- a mix of old talent and new talent. Matt Damon
stars as a young, idealistic lawyer tackling an insurance company. He's
mixed with the directorial skills of Francis Ford Coppola ("The Godfather"),
the young talent of Claire Daines (tackling the serious role of a wife being
abused by her husband), of John Voight, and of Danny DeVito).
So what is it that John Grisham chooses to tackle in his moral crusade to
give lawyers a good name? The lawyers that have a bad name: the ambulance
chasing, insurance-settlement getting lawyers that make the word "schiester"
what it is.
The film makes you love a character that does just that for a living,
explaining all of the things which we wonder about (such as why in the hell
they drool when the sirens blare, anyway?). It has him going into law school
to change the world, to be a complete idealist, and tackles the subject of
recognition of your place in life.
What's the best thing about this new film? The classic realism that Francis
Ford Coppala has always shown (with the exception of "Dracula", of course).
In this film, he reasserts his mastery over the American Silver Screen. A
sure-fire winner, and a definite Oscar Contender for this year. See it if
you're in need for a good dose of idealism.

So here I am faced with the dilemma of reviewing another John Grisham
movie. I ask myself, shall I be fair or should I trash it? After all
this is number umpteen in a long line of successful Grisham movies, and
the one most likely to be torn apart by critics hungry for blood. Let's
be fair.
This is not by any means the most engrossing court room drama to date,
but it is certainly one of the more amusing attempts to lighten the
heavy weight of legal discourse. Thanks to Danny Devito and his funny
man antics we have achieved the latter to the end. Frances Ford Cappola
seems an unusual choice for directing such an unconventional mixture of
drama and comedy, and remarkably this movie isn't clouded by his usual
heavy directional undertones. When the movie finishes, you'll be
wandering to yourself  My God, Frances Ford Cappola directed this ???'.
For better or worse, Coppola has decided to sway away from using a prime
grade star by choosing a relative unknown such as Matt Damon, to play
the lead. This I personally believe was a mistake. People are always
asking about who the male and female leads of a movie are, and when you
can only provide a . Ummmmh.. in response to their question, you will
likely get an .Ohhhh.. from them, before they brush the movie into
their memory  that's unless you are a die hard Grisham fan. Matt Damon
is every bit good quality for money as the young lawyer who makes a
miracle happen in court, but someone like Ethan Hawke may have been
better material.
There is however a strong cast of supporting actors and actresses. Jon
Voight is delightfully crooked as the powerful lawyer providing defence
for the fraudulent health insurance business. Devito I have already
mentioned, and other well knowns like Danny Glover, Roy Scheider and
Mickey Rourke throw in fine performances. The most unbelievable and
sadly miscast is Clare Danes in the role of a battered wife who also
provides a love interest for the young Matt Damon. Not only are the
bandages hanging off her face in the most pathetic manner, but the
flimsy method of application with a stuck band-aid here and there is
ludicrous. This is sadly the fault of a misinformed make-up artist with
no first aid experience.
Beside this, there is only one point of contention in this movie that I
have to mention. When the battered wife (Danes) asks the young lawyer
(Damon) for the baseball bat and then closes the door behind her before
beating her husband's brains out . sad to say this can no longer be
considered The Battered Wife Syndrome' or Manslaughter'  the correct
term would be intent to kill and cannot be justified by the fact the
abusive husband deserved to die. Once the husband is dead it is implied
that the lawyer and housewife get together. This surprised me
considering that all John Grisham movies carry such an undeniable sense
of right and wrong, but now such leeway is given. Besides this minor
quirk, the audience is drawn into caring about what happens to the
characters, and you will end up with another cathartic experience of
courtroom melodramatics to help soothe your society ill laden
conscience.

John Grisham's The Rainmaker (PG-13) *** (out of ****)
Good Will Hunting (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
Every year, Hollywood crowns a new "it boy"--a young actor pegged for
major movie stardom.  Inheriting the mantle from last year's "winner,"
Matthew McConaughey, is Matt Damon, and, like McConaughey, he proves to be
more than just a fresh young face, as evidenced in two radically different
projects currently in release--John Grisham's The Rainmaker and Good Will
Hunting.
Damon has his first major starring role, a la McConaughey, in a John
Grisham adaptation--in this case, Francis Ford Coppola's take on The
Rainmaker.  Damon plays wet-behind-the-ears attorney Rudy Baylor, who,
immediately after passing the bar exam, finds himself representing the
mother (Mary Kay Place) of a terminally ill young man (John Whitworth) in a
big-league suit against a negligent insurance company.  While Rudy's (and
the film's) main concern is this case, he also finds time to protect a
young wife (Claire Danes) from her abusive husband (Melrose Placer Andrew
Shue, in a mercifully brief role).
Written for the screen and directed by Coppola, The Rainmaker is the best
Grisham film yet mostly because it does not take itself too seriously.
Coppola's most notable--and effective--contribution to the tried-and-true
Grisham formula is a sense of humor about itself, which largely comes in
the presence of Danny DeVito (as Rudy's unlicensed co-counsel) and Golden
Globe nominee Jon Voight (as the insurance company's hotshot attorney).
The inclusion of the battered wife subplot feels rather superfluous, but
Danes is as superb as always.  Then, of course, there is Damon, who nicely
juggles the weighty (the insurance case, the spousal abuse) and the
humorous (Rudy's often comical naivete) requirements of his role without
missing a beat.
As good as he is in The Rainmaker, Damon showcases the depth of his talent
in Good Will Hunting, directed by Gus Van Sant and written by actor Ben
Affleck and Damon himself.  Damon plays the title character, Will Hunting,
a troubled young construction worker/janitor at MIT who also happens to be
a supergenius.  In an attempt to steer this brilliant young mind in the
right direction, an MIT math professor (Stellan Skarsgard) taps his old
college friend, community college psychologist Sean McGuire (Robin
Williams), to counsel the abrasive, standoffish Will and try to help him
come to terms with his turbulent life.
Good Will Hunting is the touchy-feely enterprise its plot synopsis
suggests, but to simply dismiss it as that would be to discount the true
emotional chords Affleck and Damon's intelligent script touches.  Even
though no one (and, if so, _very_ few people) can directly relate to Will's
burden of superhuman intelligence, the insecurities he suffers are
universal.  The material is brought to life by the terrific ensemble of
actors.  Williams delivers a nice dramatic turn; Affleck, a hot
up-and-coming actor himself (Chasing Amy), turns up in a warm and charming
performance as Will's best friend; and the ever-appealing Minnie Driver
shines as Will's Harvard-schooled love interest.  The clear standout in the
cast, though, is Damon, who bravely does not soften Will's prickly nature
but has such a natural ease with the audience that it is hard _not_ to care
for him.
So many names come and go with the fluctuations of the Hollywood hype
machine, but based on his impressive work in John Grisham's The Rainmaker
and especially Good Will Hunting, it is a safe bet that Matt Damon is one
name we will be hearing a lot more of in the years to come.

     Frankly, the *last* thing that I wanted to see on a Saturday night
was yet another John Grisham flick, about yet another young law dude
(Matt Damon) tackling his first big case.  (This is, what, the *third*
such story in a row, after THE CHAMBER and A TIME TO KILL?)  Imagine my
surprise to find adaptation #6 possessing a strong, often broadly played
comedic streak.  Sure, the outcome is predictable, duh, but the road to
get there is refreshingly lighter-hearted.  Francis Ford Coppola, who
wrote and directed, serves up ample humor at every turn, from those de-
liriously tacky Memphis locales to the occasional bit of outright slap-
stick.  (The scene-stealer, here, is DeVito.  In a smaller role, Mickey
Rourke is oily fun.  And don't miss Dean Stockwell's delightful hacking-
cough cameo.)  The courtroom scenes have the requisite surprises, but
not nearly enough dramatic punch.  The tone is breezy, almost whimsical;
the pacing is methodical, though we could use a bit more urgency toward
the end.  Trickier is the subplot involving Claire Danes as an abused
young wife (and potential love interest), but the filmmakers pull it
off.  (That is, except for Elmer Bernstein's score, that too often in-
trudes upon the couple's quiet time.)  And, as the main character real-
izes by the end of the movie, there's no small irony in a story about an
ambulance-chasing, money-grubbing law firm going after a claims-denying,
money-grubbing insurance agency.

     It has been several years since I've read a book by John Grisham (I 
believe the last one was THE CLIENT).  After three or four of Grisham's 
novels, I grew tired of the predictable repetitiveness and contrived 
suspense of the narratives.  As a result, the intelligence and subtlety 
of THE RAINMAKER took me by surprise.  I don't know if this is because 
the novel is better than any of the prolific lawyer-turned-author's 
previous efforts, or if Francis Ford Coppola has performed a near-
miracle in transforming the written pages into a screenplay.  Whatever 
the case, THE RAINMAKER stands above any other filmed Grisham 
adaptation, including A TIME TO KILL, the former holder of that title.
     In order to make an appealing movie with a lawyer as the 
protagonist, it's necessary to come up with a villain who can make even 
an attorney look good.  In this case, Grisham has found one -- a big-
time, sleazy insurance company.  Of course, it doesn't hurt that the 
main character in THE RAINMAKER has his heart in the right place.  Sure, 
Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon) may be an ambulance-chaser, but that's only an 
unfortunate fact of life.  He's one of the few who doesn't allow the 
realities of practicing law to corrupt his sense of ethics.
     Rudy went to law school because he believed all the myths about 
helping people.  But, because his family had no high-placed connections, 
graduation found him waiting tables to pay off his student loans, rather 
than going to work for a prestigious firm.  Eventually, Rudy hooks up 
with the Memphis-based ambulance-chasing outfit of Bruiser Stone (Mickey 
Roarke), where he's partnered with Deck Shiffler (Danny DeVito), a 
"para-lawyer" who knows the ropes but has failed the bar exam six times.  
Rudy is sent to the local hospital to search for new clients.  What he 
finds instead is a young woman, Kelly Riker (Claire Danes), who has been 
severely beaten by her husband.  The attraction between Rudy and Kelly 
is immediate and obvious, but she's afraid to file for divorce for fear 
that her husband will kill her.  Pretty soon, Rudy and Deck feel the 
heat as a Federal probe closes in on Bruiser, so, together with only 
about $10,000 between them, they open up their own office.
     Meanwhile, Rudy is working on his first big case:  suing an 
insurance company for failing to make good on a claim owed to his 
client, a leukemia patient, Donnie Ray Black (Johnny Whitworth).  When 
the inevitable happens and Donnie Ray dies, it becomes a wrongful death 
suit, with Rudy representing Donnie Ray's mother, Dot (Mary Kay Place), 
against a host of high-priced suits led by Leo F. Drummond (Jon Voight).  
But the judge, Tyrone Kipler (Danny Glover), is a fair man, and allows 
Rudy some latitude in presenting his case.  As Rudy puts it, "I'm alone, 
I'm outgunned but I'm right."
     THE RAINMAKER keeps the in-trial showmanship to a minimum.  While 
it's virtually impossible to film a courtroom drama where there aren't 
at least a few tricks and unexpected legal maneuvers, THE RAINMAKER does 
a good job of downplaying these so that they're never too difficult to 
swallow.  (Besides, what fun would it be if there were no surprises 
whatsoever?)  The ending is also low-key, with no embarrassing SCENT OF 
A WOMAN display.  At no time does the courtroom erupt into spontaneous 
applause, nor does judge Danny Glover ever have to threaten to clear the 
room. As an added bonus, Rudy and Deck are actually shown acting nervous 
and inexperienced in court.  They make numerous gaffes, occasionally 
stumble over their words (or their feet), and generally appear like 
first-timers, which they are.
     In a recent interview with THE PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER's Steven Rea, 
Coppola stated that he was tired of being labeled a "gun for hire," a 
term used to refer to him when describing his involvement in the studio 
projects JACK and THE RAINMAKER.  Coppola noted that he wrote and 
directed THE RAINMAKER because he was engrossed by the book and saw 
parallels between Rudy's struggles as a young lawyer and his own early 
years as a film maker.  Coppola also emphasized that he loved making the 
movie, and didn't see it as just a source of quick cash.
     For the most part, THE RAINMAKER is really a character study of 
Rudy.  Everything in the film  his relationship with Kelly, his 
courtroom struggles, and his growing involvement with his clients  is 
designed to highlight his development as an individual.  In the lead 
role, Matt Damon does a fine job portraying the uncertainty of someone 
who believes he has the moral high ground, but realizes that his lack of 
experience could lose the case.  Danny DeVito is perfect as the more 
cynical, financially-driven Deck, providing occasional moments of comedy 
to break THE RAINMAKER's tension.  Claire Danes is heartbreaking as 
Kelly, the young wife who has lost all of her dreams in a sea of pain 
and bruises.  The supporting cast is solid, with turns from an 
uncredited Danny Glover, Virginia Madsen as a witness for the plaintiff, 
Teresa Wright as Rudy's landlady, and Roy Scheider as the CEO of the 
insurance company.
     THE RAINMAKER is not without missteps  for example, the latter 
stages of Rudy and Kelly's relationship seem rushed, as does the ending.  
Overall, however, this is a well-made, absorbing motion picture that 
seems a lot shorter than its 140-minute running length.  Unlike many of 
the other films based on a Grisham book, this one is interested in 
telling a story rather than ambushing the audience with cheap 
contrivances.  It's an intelligent and thoughtful approach, and the 
focus on character and legitimate drama makes this a surprisingly-strong 
late-November release.
