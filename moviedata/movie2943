In BOYS AND GIRLS Freddie Prinze Jr. delivers a lame performance that
appears almost to be a parody of himself as an actor playing a part.
The canonical young romantic comedy lead, Prinze this time plays a
lifeless character named Ryan Williams, who is an anal-retentive
grammarian and a structural engineering student.  With nerdy glasses and
big hair that looks like it was parted by Moses, Ryan is not the type
who succeeds easily with girls.
In contrast, the lovely Jennifer (Claire Forlani from MEET JOE BLACK)
has everything to attract the opposite sex.  Her problem (other than her
obsession with Latin quotes -- she's a Latin major) is that she has a
phobia toward commitments.  That's really original.  Her first long-time
boyfriend drops her by singing his goodbye in a song in a nightclub in
which he is performing.
Ryan and Jennifer keep running into each other, and, as you can probably
guess, their friendship becomes deeper than either one of them realizes.
You, however, will care about none of this.  Thanks to Robert Iscove's
lethargic direction and Andrew Lowery and Andrew Miller's laughless
script, the movie creaks along like a car from Rent-a-Wreck.  If the
movie could have ever worked it way up to at least being insulting that
would have been a welcome improvement.  (The movie starts off raunchily
as the characters as 12-year-olds meet for the first-time on a plane.
Their candid discussion involves her first period since it delays the
flight.  After this episode, however, the movie becomes as bland as the
help-wanted slides that they play in the theaters before the movie
starts.  No.  Hold that thought.  Some of the slides show at least some
inspiration.)
"You're pretty funny when you're depressed," Jennifer tells Ryan.  "Get
ready for comedy," he quips.  If you're heading for BOYS AND GIRLS, it
will help if you find depression funny because you may be pretty
depressed after wasting your money on this shallow story.
BOYS AND GIRLS runs 1:34.  It is rated PG-13 for sexual content and
would be acceptable for teenagers.

     Having ventured into the fairy tale realms of relationship dynamics
in 1999's Cinderella story SHE'S ALL THAT, director Robert Iscove and
Freddie Prinze Jr. clearly felt there was a more contemporary spin on
male-female interaction that they could rip to shreds for a youth 
audience. So in BOYS AND GIRLS they decided to tell a story of Ryan Walker
(Prinze) and Jennifer Burrows (Claire Forlani), two individuals whose
paths cross repeatedly over the course of several years before they end up
becoming friends. One of them takes a casual view of sex and a cynical
perspective on the prospects for love to succeed; the other is a
compulsive planner and hopeless romantic. Each one has a best pal of the
same sex in whom to confide -- Ryan's compulsive liar roommate Hunter
(Jason Biggs) and Jennifer's high-strung roommate Amy (Amanda Detmer),
respectively -- but ultimately they communicate better with each other
than with anyone else. Then they have sex, and everything gets terribly
complicated despite the fact that they tell each other they both believe
it was a mistake. 
     Paging Nora Ephron: I hope you've got your attorney ready, because
this is one slam-dunk of a plagiarism case. Yes, BOYS AND GIRLS is
practically a point-by-point remake of WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, dumbed down
significantly to appeal to viewers even younger than the lead actors' peer
group. Sure, there are a few minor variations -- in this incarnation, it's
Ryan who's the Type A Sally Albright, and Jennifer who's the Type B Harry
Burns -- but the devil is in the details. Jennifer tells Ryan that she's
got a date, then suggests that Ryan should "get out there" as well. 
Jennifer makes a point during a conversation with Ryan by making a scene
in a diner. The "morning after" scene finds one of the participants trying
to make an uncomfortably quick getaway. There's a montage in which
Jennifer leaves multiple answering machine messages for the emotionally
wounded Ryan. The protagonists' respective best pals get together the
first time they meet. And so on, and so on.
     Granted, Hollywood has always been in the recycling business, and
there are far worse romantic comedies to use as a model than WHEN HARRY
MET SALLY. But BOYS AND GIRLS does what most bad copies of good films
do: It mimics a structure without having the faintest grasp of the insight
or charm that fueled the original. The script, credited to "The Drews" 
(actors Andrew Lowery and Andrew Miller, whose only previous screen credit
as writers came for the Dennis Rodman action vehicle SIMON SEZ), doubles
the pain of lame situations by adding horribly forced banter, the kind of
stuff that just makes you feel sorry for the people reading it. BOYS AND
GIRLS does have a great supporting cast in Biggs, Detmer and erstwhile
BLAIR WITCH victim Heather Donahue (virtually unrecognizable as a blonde); 
their energy makes the film almost watchable, since one or more of them is
on screen much of the time. Unfortunately, the force of their 
personalities just makes the hole at the center of the film all the more
evident.
     It would be easy enough for that interpretation to be read as a cheap
bit of Freddie Prinze Jr.-bashing, which it actually is not. Granted, it's
a ghastly sight watching Prinze pretend to be a geeky, braces-wearing
16-year-old, but he's relaxed and pleasant enough for most of the film. 
Claire Forlani also does a perfectly serviceable job considering how
little context is provided for her personality. The problem with BOYS AND
GIRLS is that in the process of re-making WHEN HARRY MET SALLY with
attractive twenty-somethings, Iscove and company have lost the wisdom and
wit that comes from a story about the romantic travails of thirty- and
forty-somethings. All that remains is a familiar shell that has been
filled with silly nightclub choreography and a complete lack of chemistry
between the two leads. It's a shallow little film that's just not funny
enough or perceptive enough to register as anything but weak imitation. 
The opening credits re-make of J. Geils Band's "Love Stinks" is merely a
clever diversion; apparently Harry Connick Jr. was unavailable to do the
honors.

When it comes to the average teenage romantic comedy,
I expect negative reviews from critics left and right.
Predictable, unoriginal, and forgettable will most
likely be the three adjectives to haunt the Down to
You's and the Drive Me Crazy's released by the dozens
these last couple of years. What I really look for in
this kind of movie is the entertainment value while
I'm sitting in the theater. Am I enjoying myself? Is
this a comfortable break from my week of finals? This
is why I have given films like Final Destination or
Road Trip high marks; I had a party of a time wasting
my money on something I won't remember next week.
So last week I opened up the New York Times - and, no
surprise, Boys and Girls got a negative review. Daily
News? Negative. Reelviews? Negative. Epinions.com?
Negative. This was nothing new. American Pie, Final
Destination, Road Trip didn't get such hot reviews and
I loved those guilty pleasures. Same goes for She's
All That, a formulaic but enjoyable Pygmalion
adaptation that got unjustly pounded. Since Boys and
Girls reunites She's All That director Robert Iscove
and actor Freddie Prinze Jr., I predicted déjŕ vu al
over again. But, still curious, I asked around my
school and from the one or two people who had seen it,
the reactions were far from positive. I had made up my
mind; I'll catch it on video or cable in a couple of
years. But, soon after, following a series of
unexpected events (we couldn't get into Shaft because
it is rated R), I found myself watching Boys and
Girls. Whoops. 
Boys and Girls is about a "nerdy, smart" boy named
Ryan (Prinze Jr.) and a "popular, flirt" girl named
Jennifer (Claire Forlani). Briefly meeting as
pre-teens and now attending the same college, the two
bump into each other so many times that eventually
they become best friends. But in the movies, a male
and a female cannot be friends without having that
nagging feeling of attraction for each other. With
advice from their roommates (Amanda Detmer, Jason
Biggs), Ryan and Jennifer attempt to discover the true
meaning of their relationship. 
The film definitely lives up to the dreaded three
adjectives - and mindless entertainment is nowhere to
be found. I could hardly sit through the 93 minute
running time for several reasons. The dialogue is
probably the worst I have ever seen in any movie,
mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring
script and the ridiculous words these characters use
is what Hollywood thinks kids can relate to. It is
almost offensive. An example of an insightful
conversation:
(Well it's not as bad as Wing Commander I guess)
The supporting cast is also painfully useless. Detmer
and Biggs stand in the way for anything interesting to
happen with their own boring, pointless subplots. And
although this is supposed to be from both perspectives
of the human sex, Prinze Jr's Ryan dominates the
screen while Forlani's Jennifer simply acts as a
dilemma for him to work with. We never learn anything
about Jennifer which is a shame too because Forlani is
the only actor to bring any life into her character. 
Teenager or not: you'll hate this movie, I guarantee
it. Maybe I should rent She's All That again. Is it
really as good as I think it is?

Freddie Prinze, Jr. has said in recent interviews that the reason he made a 
string of teen movies in the last two years is because, in a sense, his goal 
was to create a trilogy of films that his generation could relate to, and 
appreciate. The opening part of the film threesome, "She's All That," was a 
cliched and rather uninspired high school dramedy that had a cast of fresh 
faces, but stereotyped each and every one of them. "Down to You" was the 
second film, inferior to "She's All That," and ruined by a mess of a 
screenplay and Prinze, Jr.'s amateurish performance. The final part of the 
trilogy, "Boys and Girls," is the best of the three, intelligently written 
and with just a little more going on in its head than the usual film of its 
type. It also can be noted as Freddie Prinze, Jr.'s very first movie in which 
he is actually pretty good in it. Usually striking frequent false notes in 
each of his performances, he has finally come into his own as an actor here, 
and it's a good thing, for the cast of "Boys and Girls" is its strongest 
asset.
Ryan (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) and Jennifer (Claire Forlani) first met on an 
airplane when they were 12-years-old, both flying alone en route to Los 
Angeles. The free-thinking Jennifer had just gotten her first period, and her 
graphic talks of it both confused and disgusted the anal-retentive Ryan, with 
their conversation eventually leading into a string of insults. Their next 
encounter was four years later in high school, with Jennifer now a 
cheerleader and Ryan the football team's mascot. 
No matter how different Jennifer and Ryan were, their paths always seemed to 
cross, and it does again two years later when Ryan enters into the University 
of California in Berkeley, where Jennifer is a sophomore. Primarily spanning 
the first three years of Ryan's college experience, he and Jennifer gradually 
become best friends, their varying personalities a perfect fit to help each 
other out in their relationships when they most need it. Ryan is a structural 
engineering major, with his life all mapped out, whereas Jennifer is a Latin 
major with absolutely no idea how she could use such a thing to get a job in 
the future. Jennifer is afraid of commitment because of all of the times she 
has been burned by guys, while Ryan just wants someone who he can love 
unconditionally, and who is right for him. What isn't clear to Jennifer, 
however, is that the one that could really make her truly happy is right in 
front of her--the kind of guy who could be the love of her life, as well as 
her dearest friend.
"Boys and Girls" is predictable, but that is to be expected. What does come 
as a surprise is how much this Generation X and Y-aimed comedy-drama has in 
common with Woody Allen's films, most notably 1977's "Annie Hall." Despite 
the advertising campaign that makes "Boys and Girls" appear to be an ensemble 
picture, the film is essentially a two-character show, with Freddie Prinze, 
Jr. and Claire Forlani taking up almost all the screentime. All supporting 
characters are purposefully inconsequential catalysts that aid in taking Ryan 
and Jennifer through the journey that inevitably brings the two together. 
This style of storytelling works because it adds a layer of realism to the 
proceedings, where people can come in and out of your life before you have 
time to stop and realize it.
Besides the aforementioned Prinze, Jr., Claire Forlani (1998's "Meet Joe 
Black") surpasses the unextraordinary material to bring Jennifer an added 
dimension I suspect wasn't present in the screenplay, by "The Drews." Forlani 
is the type of classy actress you would never associate with teen movies, but 
here she is, in a role that is admittedly unlike any she has taken on before. 
Together, Prinze, Jr. and Forlani make for an appealing couple with not a lot 
of fiery chemistry, but delightful as close buddies.
While Jason Biggs (1999's "American Pie") has been highly touted in the ads 
for "Boys and Girls," he is not onscreen nearly as much as you would be led 
to believe. As Hunter, Ryan's girl-crazy, compulsively-lying roommate, Biggs 
is the comic relief of the film, and is well-cast. The same goes for Amanda 
Detmer (2000's "Final Destination"), as Jennifer's socially inept friend, 
Amy, who relies on a therapist to make the brunt of her decisions. Detmer 
brings added energy to her scenes, and is a likable presence throughout. 
In a return to the big screen after her stunning debut in last year's "The 
Blair Witch Project," Heather Donahue is very funny as Megan, Ryan's 
straightforward girlfriend who approaches him about going out and makes it 
clear that "I always zoom in on what I want." Donahue is only in a few 
scenes, but makes a lasting impression, causing you to wish she could have 
garnered more to work with. Finally, Alyson Hannigan (1999's "American Pie") 
and musical artist Monica Arnold briefly appear in cameos as, respectively, 
Ryan's high school sweetheart and one of Hunter's fleeting flings.
At times a bit overly talky, and oddly feeling as if it might have been 
better equipped as a stage play, "Boys and Girls" is, nonetheless, a 
well-made romance that may not always work, but is appreciatively 
overambitious in its ideas about relationships and the opposite sex. It's 
better to aim high and only occasionally achieve its goals, I think, rather 
than merely accepting the bare minimum in character and story 
developments--something the majority of so-called "teen" films fall right 
into the trap of, without looking back.

Director Robert Iscove and star Freddie Prinze Jr. both appeared last year in 
the similarly themed She's All That. In that film, Prinze's jock character 
was trying to win a bet by turning an outcast into the prom queen, only to 
fall in love with her. Boys and Girls takes place in college, the next step 
after high school, but some main elements are very much the same. Luckily, 
both films retain a romantic charm that makes them work. Some would attribute 
this to popular teen romance movie star Freddie Prinze Jr. Freddie did make 
movies like Down To You and I Still Know What You Did Last Summer work, but 
Boys and Girls owes its thanks to a marvelous supporting cast. These 
characters are where the film's real comedy comes from, and it makes the 
movie seem like less of a rehash. 
Ryan (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and Jennifer (Claire Forlani) have been running 
into each other at different points in their lives. One time they get seated 
on a plane together, another incident years later has them meeting up after a 
football game when her boyfriend runs over his mascot costume. The two are 
gawky and more than a little strange. As luck would have it, they end up 
going to the same college, where they discover the other hasn't changed a 
bit. Ryan must still have a plan for everything and is very uptight. Jennifer 
is free-spirited and still scared of commitment. Their differences turn out 
to form a friendship and they start spending a lot of time with each other. 
Their roommates Hunter (Jason Biggs) who is always trying to score with the 
ladies, and Amy (Amanda Detmer) who is always talking about or talking with 
her therapist, join the circle of friends. Jennifer's convinced her and Ryan 
are just friends, and the two date other people. Ryan's brainy, 
straightforward, and very funny girlfriend Megan (The Blair Witch Project's 
Heather Donahue) and a guitarist are among them. However, Ryan and Jennifer 
can't hold their passion in much longer. 
All of the actors are quite charming in their roles. Freddie Prinze Jr. does 
nothing new, but Claire Forlani finally gets the lead role she's been looking 
for. Both Forlani and Detmer get a chance at laughs they didn't get with 
their last movies, and they succeed. Hunter and Megan are the real comic 
characters though. Hunter makes up so many lies about himself to women, 
hoping it will quickly lead to sex for the night. His tactics, attitude, and 
actions are never short of ridiculous. Megan only appears in a few scenes, 
but was a standout character. Heather Donahue brings her control freak 
by-the-rules Megan to life, and steals the show. My favorite part of the 
movie is when Megan first approaches Ryan and directly asks him out. As she 
says once or twice, "I'm a laser. I know what I want and I go straight for 
it." The soundtrack for the film is very good, and there is a great scene 
where Jennifer takes Ryan out to a club where they dance to âCar Washâ? by 
Rolls Royce. While dancing, they actually are being washed with soap and 
water by the club's plumbing system. This strange modern musical number was 
also a feature of She's All That. 
The appealing actors can't make up for a large amount of very stupid and 
rather pointless lines. At times the lines get convincingly said, at other 
times not, and the movie never reaches a huge level of reality. Jennifer 
complains late in the film about movies like Sixteen Candles, and how they 
never show the relationship six months later when everything is starting to 
fall apart. Despite these comments, this movie does the same thing. I had to 
ask myself how long this relationship could possibly last, but for now it 
makes for an entertaining romance that is sure to please teenagers and adults 
alike.

>From all the publicity and promotions for this movie you'd think it was going 
to be this year's "American
Pie" but just because it has Jason Biggs in it doesn't make it so. This is 
far from the zany, outrageous
comedy you think it's going to be, it's more of "When Harry Met Sally" at the 
teenage level. 
Freddie Prinze Jr. and Claire Forlani star as two friends who met each other 
as children, bump into each
other in high school and bump into each other A LOT in college. They spend a 
lot of quality time together
and have great chemistry for a couple who are just friends (think "Will & 
Grace" without the gayness). The
film plays like a senior thesis on relationships and a lot of time is spent 
dissecting basic human attraction. 
At times the movie goes overboard and becomes really sappy (especially at the 
end), but it's a teenage
romantic comedy so there's not many big surprises here. A good date movie but 
needs more laughs.

filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Norm Schrager.

Boys and Girls plays like a college version of When Harry Met Sally,
with just as much fun and fewer contrivances.  Here, the key couple is
Ryan and Jennifer, who meet by chance on a plane as pre-teens, and
continually bump into one another until their lives bisect at
Cal-Berkeley.  Ryan, played by Flavor of the Moment Freddie Prinze, Jr.,
is a bright, sometimes awkward engineering student who loves planning
and order; Jennifer, Meet Joe Black's Claire Forlani, majors in Latin
for no particular reason and aims to travel.  Both wish they could apply
their positive personality traits to their floundering relationships,
but it just doesn't work.
The smart script for Boys and Girls, written by the humbly-credited
`Drews', succeeds in part because Ryan and Jennifer nurture their unique
friendship for nearly all of the film.  While the inevitable Hollywood
ending may be in viewers' minds from the get-go, The Drews and director
Robert Iscove keep us guessing if this pair might ever connect with each
other, and the sweet performances by Prinze and Forlani keep us
interested.. The couple's interplay, and the machinations of their
separate, frustrating lovelives, are satisfying enough that a sunshiny
ending is not required.
Iscove, a TV veteran and director of Prinze's She's All That, provides
so much screen time between the leads that there are times when
sequences seem almost too long  until we realize we're seeing Ryan and
Jennifer weeks or months later, and not the same night as the previous
scene.  It's one of the many subtle surprises in Boys & Girls, and it
keeps the film floating with an infectious energy.
When movies like these create supporting roles, it's usually to provide
basic comic relief or other plot motivation that minimizes the
characters  not the case here.  Jason Biggs, becoming famous and good
very quickly, is Hunter, Ryan's roommate who changes hair color every
semester and stories with every girl he meets; Amanda Detmer garners
sympathy as Jennifer's nervous, jealous roommate, desperately trying to
find her way while being overly reliant on her therapist.  This pair
become neatly woven into the story, rather than existing just on the
fringes.  It's more effort than you'd find in say, Nora Ephron's
standard Tom Hanks-Meg Ryan romances.
One of the best compliments that can be paid to Boys & Girls is that it
recalls Cameron Crowe's work.  Sure, there's the basic story of young
adults trying to get comfortable in their own skin, but there's more.
Iscove injects the film with the total atmosphere of college life,
Berkeley, and San Francisco, creating a fuller environment for his
characters and story.  Crowe showed similar skills with Singles and Say
Anything, and that kind of detail adds a real flavor and maturity to the
movie.
When John Hughes created The Breakfast Club in the mid-80s, he added
substance and humor to his characters, making a seemingly `teen' movie
appeal to a broad audience.  The makers of Boys and Girls were obviously
affected by Hughes (aside from Ryan and Jennifer going to a Hughes
double-feature): moving against the grain of recent films, Boys and
Girls glides by with no nudity, no gross-out humor, and minimal
stereotyping, and yet should still appeal to the high school and college
audience.   It avoids cheap laughs and respects its young characters,
and that's a welcome change.

A romantic comedy is supposed to be fanciful and fun. This is neither. Nor is it sexy. Written by Andrew Lowery and Andrew Miller (who call themselves the Drews) and directed by Robert Iscove, as a date movie, it's so blatantly formulaic and generically predictable that it's tedium. After "She's All That" and "Down to You," Freddie Prinze Jr. could play this teenybopper idol role by rote - and he practically does. He's a sensitive stud who finds his soul-mate in Claire Forlani, who's obviously seen too many episodes of "Ally McBeal."  They first met, years ago, when they were pre-teens, on an airplane and discovered that they were both children of divorce en route to their new homes. Since then, their paths have crossed occasionally but they both, coincidentally, wound up at University of California at Berkeley.  The so-called "catch" is that they're not only commitment-phobic, very verbal best-friends but, temperamentally, opposites. He's logical and has his heart set!
 on structural engineering; she's free-spirited, emotional and a Latin major. And if much of their commiserating about their respective lackluster love lives looks familiar, think "When Harry Met Sally..." which obviously served as inspiration. Then, one night, passion overcomes resistance, and - guess what? - he's more sexually strait-laced than she is. (The giddy teenage girls in the audience were giggling hysterically at this point.) The other actors, like Jason Biggs, Amanda Detmer and Heather Donahue, simply look bored, desperately wishing they were elsewhere. And who can blame them? On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Boys and Girls" is a lame, tepid 2. Guys, you gotta wait too long for those Victoria's Secret models to beckon your glazed eyes back to the screen.

"Boys and Girls" is the kind of teen movie that has been done repeatedly to 
death - boy finds girl, boy becomes best friends with girl, boy finds new 
girl, girl finds new boy, original boy and girl have sex, boy and girl see 
mistake in this, boy and girl decide to be together, etc. If it were not for 
the entertaining, credible performances by the leads, I would have said: skip 
this! 
Freddie Prinze, Jr. is Ryan Walker, a nerdy, high-school whiz with prospects 
of majoring in structural engineering. Claire Forlani is Jennifer Burrows, a 
bright girl who aspires to major in Latin and then go to Italy for graduate 
studies. Ryan doesn't like to be called dumb and doesn't go out much. 
Jennifer does not believe in commitment, and uses Latin phrases constantly. 
There is no reason in the world for Ryan and Jennifer to be together, but 
they keep running into each other every few years before finally becoming 
best friends in college. 
Ryan's college roomate is Hunter aka Steve (Jason Biggs), a foolhardy court 
jester whose idea of humor is to stay locked inside a trunk and surprise 
people. He has trouble finding girls, no doubt due to his repeatedly dyed 
hair. Jennifer's college roomate is Amy (Amanda Detmer), who grows jealous of 
Jennifer's friendship with Ryan since Amy had dated him. Amy also sees a 
psychiatrist. 
Okay, so how could I possibly like this film at all, you may ask. It is after 
all the tired cliche of how friends of the opposite sex can't be friends if 
they have sex - the critics were right in calling this a junior league "When 
Harry Met Sally." Of course, and I am not sure I would call this a spoiler 
alert, they do stay together as more than just friends. But what if they 
didn't? What if director Robert Iscove (who helmed the atrocious "She's All 
That") chose a different path? What if the filmmakers proceeded along 
uncharted territory, along the lines of the penultimate twist that occurs in 
the film between Jennifer and Amy? Unfortunately, that twist is settled in an 
awkward dialogue exchange that is too safe a solution to inspire much drama. 
Still, how could I like this film? Well, much to my surprise, I found genuine 
chemistry between Prinze and Forlani. Freddie Prinze may be a hottie to 
teenage girls of today but he strikes me as being so mild-mannered as to make 
Clark Kent jealous. Yet in "Boys and Girls," he comes alive thanks to his 
rapport with Forlani and especially Hunter. Not casting Rachael Leigh Cook in 
this film was beneficial indeed. 
Forlani has not interested me in her choice of movies lately but she does 
well here, exuding radiance and true beauty as she did in "The Last Time I 
Committed Suicide" and "Basquiat." Another plus is that she does not look 
like Ally McBeal and there is something to be said for that. 
As for Jason Biggs, well, he is on his way to major movie stardom if he wants 
it. He had a great lead performance in "American Pie," and here, he delivers 
his one-liners with enough energy and subtlety to rival even Ben Stiller. He 
is such a comic force that I wish there were more of him (though we get a 
further glimpse during the end credits).
"Boys and Girls" is virtually free of all the current trends in teenage fare 
- there are no sexually scatalogical jokes, no gross-out humor, and hardly 
anything too juvenile. The film is often sensitive and emotionally true, 
though there are some melodramatic lulls at the end. Nonetheless, "Boys and 
Girls" is sweet, innocent fun that makes you wish it were so much more. 
Note: In this age of postmodernism, "Boys and Girls" does feature a scene 
where the lead characters enter a movie theatre showing "Sixteen Candles" and 
"The Breakfast Club," which this film resembles in both cases.
