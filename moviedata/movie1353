Friday the 13th Part III (3-D) (1982) *1/2 out of ***** - Directed by: Steve
Miner. Running Time: 96 minutes.
I wish I could accurately describe the theme music for part 3. The best way
I can put it is that it's funky. I know this is an odd question, but
remember the opening music of "Police Academy 4:Citizens on Patrol", when
Steve Guttenberg and Michael Winslow perform the title song "Citizens On
Patrol" during the opening credits? It's just like that.
Anyway, part 3 takes place a day after the events of part 2 (so technically
still 1985). This time, a group of horny teens (who also bring along two
aging hippie potheads for some reason) head up to a cabin on Crystal Lake
for a weekend of sex and weed. It turns out that one of the teens had been
attacked by Jason earlier in her life (which must have been between parts 1
and 2) so why she has returned to Crystal Lake ONE DAY after a new batch of
murders is beyond me. She's the lone survivor this time. Part 3 was
originally shown in theaters in 3-D, and from what I can tell from the
video, it looks as though they may have been fairly decent effects.
Jason had long, wild hair when he was unmasked in part 2. Now, one day later
he's completely bald. Also, it being one day later, it can't be Friday the
13th now can it? Oh well. Steve Miner is the only director who helmed more
than one film in the series. [R]
