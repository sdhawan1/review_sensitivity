`You're horny for a dead girl.'  I can't recall a line from a film as
startling as this.  It's even more alarming because the line doesn't
seem as disquieting during Don't Let Me Die on a Sunday, the latest
French romp through such topics as AIDS, necrophilia and other forms of
deviant sex.
Sunday begins by chopping two different scenes together.  One shows
19-year-old Térésa (Élodie Bouchez, The Dreamlife of Angels) being
slipped a mickey while she's at a smoking rave party.  The other shows
two guys double-teaming a girl in what appears to be a hospital, or some
other type of sterile environment.
The two separate stories quickly merge as Térésa hits the floor like a
sack of potatoes, is pronounced dead and taken to the local morgue,
where the two tag-team partners are employed as attendants.  One of the
men is Ben (Jean-Marc Barr), an apparently sexually frustrated chap who
has been on the job for four years and has clearly flipped his lid.  He
waits to get Térésa's body to himself, and then performs unknown carnal
acts upon it (unknown because, thankfully, they don't show it).
Then, in every necrophiliac's worst nightmare (or their ultimate fantasy
 I'm not sure I care to know), Térésa wakes up while Ben is slamming
away at her.  The authorities are stunned, but for some reason, Térésa
won't press charges, so there's nothing they can do.  Ben is suspended,
and followed first by the girl's father, who beats the shit out of Ben,
and they by Térésa herself.  Naturally, she finds herself drawn to the
man that fucked her back from the other side.
Térésa and Ben link up to perform some pretty strange sexual acts,
although never on each other.  Ben introduces her to a small group of
his friends, who are equally as bent sexually.  One is dying of AIDS in
a hospital, and Ben's friends perform a late night kidnapping to take
him to an isolated cabin to spend his remaining days.  And straight from
Girl on the Bridge, there's a scene where Térésa and Ben save a man who
is about to off himself on a viaduct.  They incorporate him into their
sexual games.
Sunday was written and directed by Didier Le Pęcheur, whose film isn't
nearly as good as Lynne Stopkewich's Kissed, which was about a woman
having sex with dead guys.  The film's subtitles are tough to read
against the white lab coats that are prominently displayed throughout
the film.  Bouchez and Barr do a decent job acting, with the latter
looking like a bizarre cross between Jeremy Piven and Croupier's Clive
Owen.  The film may be trying to deliver an important message about the
state of sex in a world full of various deadly, sexually transmitted
diseases, but it comes off as something made just to get a rise out of
viewers.

There is a particular kind of pleasure in seeing a really bad movie --
at least you have the advantage of expressing anger, frustration, or
resentment --a visceral response of some kind, no matter how
unsatisfying that is.
Don't Let Me Die on a Sunday won't even give you the satisfaction of
disgust or hatred; it is simply too dull for that.
After a wild techno music party infused with all kinds of sex, drugs and
alcohol, a young woman named Terese (Élodie Bouchez) arrives at the
local morgue: She is pronounced dead from a drug overdose.  Her
beautiful corpse attracts the attention of a gloomy, violent morgue
attendant named Ben (Jean-Marc Barr), a necrophiliac whose sexual
voracity is so powerful it brings the woman back to life.  With Ben, she
discovers an alternative lifestyle -- a subculture of sex fanatics,
latex, nipple clamps, and other trappings of a supposedly promiscuous
sexual underworld. 
With this premise, the film could have been realized as a farce or at
least black comedy, had it managed to have a drop of humor and panache
in presenting such distasteful material.  Instead, what could have been
a wild quest for endless sexual gratification is realized in boring
series of catatonic sexual gyrations, completely devoid of fun and
pleasure.  The film becomes an odyssey of dead people walking: aloof and
desensitized, they inhabit the world of dark hallways, sex clubs, morgue
corridors, and vast empty spaces.  Their world is a place in which
normal human relationships can't possibly be found: Ben and his fellow
co-workers escape what they call ordinary life in pursuit of orgies,
death worship, petty violence, and emotional vacuum.  The most
unfortunate of all is that the film treats its material with a straight
face and frightening absence of imagination and humor, and -- for those
interested in adventuresome French sexual escapades -- without even a
slight attempt to be daring or transgressive.
Even the wonderful Élodie Bouchez, who won the Best Actress Award at
Cannes in 1999 for her outstanding performance in The Dreamlife of
Angels can't bring life to this utter nullity of a movie.  My feeble
attempts to excavate the meaning of love, life, and death out of this
morgue land have obviously failed ignominiously.

     CAPSULE: Liebes meets Tod.  This was a film about sex and death.
A morgue attendant accidentally revives a dead woman through
necrophilia and brings her into his world which is heavy on orgies.
This film says something obscure about the relationship of sex and
death, but imparts no insights.  To make matter worse this print was
poorly subtitled into English from French. Rating: 4 (0 to 10) 0 (-4 to
+4)
   - An attractive 18-year-old dies on a disco floor and gets sent to a
     morgue.  One of the attendants, Ben (Jean-Marc Barr) is so
     attracted by her that he attempts necrophilia.  We see him
     crawling away after a shock.  In the middle of sex the dead teen
     has come back to life.
   - The morgue attendant was just adding a new form of sex to his
     collection of kinks.  He was already part of a group that gets
     together for S/M sex.  The revived teen, Teresa (Elodie Bouchez)
     joins them.
   - Moral dilemma of Teresa's father.  Ben has abused his daughter's
     body, but in doing so has saved her life.
   - Part of this opaque allegory is a man saved from suicide who joins
     in the sexual hijinx.  Also involved is a man in the final stages
     of dying of AIDS, a close friend of the morgue attendant.  He does
     not get involved in the orgies.
   - The subtitles of our print were white, often on a white background
     making them often hard to read, but I don't think there was a
     whole lot of meaning there that was lost.
   - The title means "Don't let me die on a Sunday."
