RELEASED: 1971
"We want water. That's as simple as I can make it. Anybody can
understand that." --The Girl, Walkabout 
Nicolas Roeg's Walkabout is quite literally a diamond in the rough.
It's difficult to name a single other film in which the setting
becomes quite so much a part of the tale, or another that is
photographed quite so lovingly. Freeze any frame and you have a
potential National Geographic cover shot. Every scene is deliberately
chosen for its cinematic effect, and there's not a moment in the film
which doesn't convey astonishing beauty--visual poetry, if you
will--even when the narrative is at its bleakest. 
But 'poetry in motion' is too simple a description for the wonders of
Walkabout; its success and brilliance stem not just from Roeg's
masterful use of the camera, but from the haunting, human characters
which inhabit this world. The film, an adaptation of the celebrated
novel by John Vance Marshall, follows the struggles of a fourteen
year-old girl (Jenny Agutter) and her little brother (Lucien John, son
of director Roeg) as they find themselves stranded in the Australian
outback after an excursion with their father ends in tragedy. 
An Aborigine boy (David Gulpilil) appears. He appears to be about
sixteen years old, and speaks no English. He's on his walkabout--an
Aborigine right of manhood in which a boy spends six months living in
the wilderness, surviving on his wits and hunting prowess. Realizing
that his two new friends are stranded, he travels with them, teaching
his companions (via gestures) how to survive in the Outback.

     Originally distributed in 1971, WALKABOUT has become director 
Nicolas Roeg's "lost work".  The film, which had five minutes of Jenny 
Agutter's frontal nudity cut from its original U.S. release, was never 
transferred to video.  As a result, this is the first opportunity for 
the under-30 crowd to experience the film, and the first chance for 
North American movie-goers of any age to see the entire, uncensored 
version.  (Incidentally, by today's standards, the nude scenes of 
Agutter wouldn't earn anything more sensational than an "R".)
     WALKABOUT is the story of two children -- a teenage girl (Agutter) 
and her 7-year old brother (Roeg's real-life son, Lucien John) -- 
stranded in the Australian wilderness.  They become trapped there when 
their father drives them out in the middle of nowhere, lights the car on 
fire, then shoots himself in the head.  Lost and alone, the two must 
attempt to find their way back to civilization.  Just when their 
provisions have run out, an Aboriginal man-child (David Gumpilil) finds 
them and guides them through the bush.  He's on his "walkabout" -- a 
several months' journey across Australia where he must survive off the 
land -- but the end of his odyssey is something that neither he nor his 
two white charges could have anticipated.
     WALKABOUT is about the never-ending conflict between civilization 
and nature, and how the two constantly work to destroy one another.  Man 
is continually tearing down the wilderness to build concrete fortresses 
that, left unattended, are reclaimed by the land.  It's clear here, as 
it was in many '70s pictures, that civilized humanity is the enemy -- 
the scourge and rapist of nature.  By today's standards, the film's 
message may seem a little naive, but that by no means renders it 
invalid.  There are Biblical allusions as well, such as snakes in a tiny 
desert oasis, but the real serpent in this Eden is the industrialized 
society.
     For the most part, WALKABOUT is an involving, occasionally 
hypnotic, motion picture.  Some of the photography, including images of 
the outback and its denizens, is spectacular.  There are also several 
effective visual contrasts between man and nature, such as the sequence 
where Agutter's character, a child of civilization, is enjoying a quiet 
swim in a natural pool while a group of Aborigines, children of the 
wilderness, are curiously exploring the burnt-out shell of a car.  All 
throughout the film, the differences between man and his world are 
highlighted, and the ending, which, while tragic, seems almost 
inevitable.
     Not every aspect of WALKABOUT is successful, however.  Roeg 
occasionally resorts to intrusive camera tricks to get his point across, 
and, without exception, these work to the film's detriment.  The use of 
still frames, hand-held shots, and bizarre inserts interferes with the 
simple beauty of the film, temporarily distancing the viewer from what's 
transpiring.  These supposedly-artistic riffs are uniformly more 
distracting than effective.
     Certainly, the most fascinating aspect of WALKABOUT is the 
relationship between the white children and their black guide.  The 
Aborigine is comfortable with the land and his body.  Not so for 
Agutter's character, a wild flower wilting under the relentless sun.  
There's a subtle element of sexual tension in their relationship, but 
it's kept in the subtext.  I doubt any film made today would be as 
oblique about this.  There's also an aspect of disdain (and, 
occasionally, fear) in the way Agutter deals with the Aborigine.  This 
is offset by the attitude of John's character, who treats the guide as 
his sister's equal.  The climactic moment, and the different ways the 
three characters face it, says more about the contrast between the 
"civilized" and "uncivilized" than anything else in the film.
     It's difficult for me, reviewing WALKABOUT more than a quarter 
century after its initial release, to get a sense of what the movie 
meant then, when its method and approach were fresher and more unique 
than they appear now.  By 1997, we've seen innumerable films with the 
same message, and that makes parts of WALKABOUT appear outdated.  
Nevertheless, even considering that this motion picture has not aged as 
well as some other landmark '70s movies, certain aspects of the film -- 
notably its lush, evocative photography and forceful emotional component 
-- make it a worthwhile experience for a '90s audience.

     Nicolas Roeg's mesmerizing 1971 film WALKABOUT exists on a
different and higher plane than traditional films.  Until very recently
this classic film was not available on tape and the theatrical version
available in America did not have the nude scenes which are essential
to the show's almost spiritual essence as they illustrate the girl's
becoming one with nature.
     We were privileged to see the full length version recently at a
local repertory theater, but the video version, released by Home Vision
Cinema, is also the complete Australian original.
     Although director and cinematographer Roeg approaches the material
as if it were a dream, the actions have a poetic truth as well as a
lyrical beauty.  Some may find parts of the story confusing, but all of
them make sense if you think about them long enough.  Unlike today's
typically transparent films, WALKABOUT expects that the viewers will be
so engrossed by the story that they will be willing to invest the
energy to think through what is happening.  We certainly were.
     The simple yet powerful movie opens with a family, known only as
the girl, the brother, and the man, about to leave for a picnic in the
Australian outback.  They take their black Volkswagen bug off the road
and stop literally in the middle of nowhere.
     The girl spends much of the film listening to educational programs
on her portable radio.  On the way to the picnic she learns the correct
etiquette for table setting.  The family is immaculately dressed with
the girl and brother in their school uniforms.  The six-year-old boy
has on his coat and tie even though the heat is scorching.  The
sixteen-year-old girl wears proper white pantyhose under her miniskirt.
     The small role of the man is played by John Meillon.  His glassy
stare speaks of an inner and unspoken torment.  Luc Roeg (then using
the professional name Lucien John) is the little boy.  He plays him
with all of the unquestioning naivete of a child.  The best performance
is by Jenny Agutter.  She oozes a natural charm and sexuality without
ever being flirtatious.  At that age where she has the body of a woman
but the limitations of someone still a schoolgirl, she displays
remarkable resilience and maturity.  Her acting leaves an impression on
you long after you leave the theater.  Why she has only gotten small
parts in dozens of minor films since remains a mystery.
     The unusual camera angles and Antony Gibbs' and Alan Patillo's
editing immediately put the audience on notice that this is no ordinary
film.  Desert animals, especially ominous lizards, are shot in extreme
close-up and then there is a fast zoom out.  Sometimes shots are frozen
so that the images left have the blur of motion.  One of the many
themes of the picture is the duality of human life as part of both the
civilized world and the animal kingdom.  This is illustrated in many
ways but most frequently by dwelling on animals eating other animals,
in nature as well as in the city.  Cuts between a butcher chopping meat
and an animal devouring its kill are typical.
     At the picnic, the father goes subtlety berserk.  Without warning
he slowly begins shooting at his kids and then he immolates himself and
their car.  The girl then calmly takes her brother by the hand and
together they attempt to return to civilization.
     Soon, however, their water has run out and their carefully
scrubbed faces are pock marked with serious sunburns.  Exhausted, the
little boy is ready to give up.  "Please try," insists his sister
politely.  "It's silly to give in now.  It can't be much further."  Of
course, it is.  The vast, and gorgeous desert is surrounded by red
rocky mountains, and the city might as well be a million miles away.
     Their savior appears in the form of an aborigine (David Gulpilil).
His character, known only as the "black boy" in the credits, is
sixteen-years-old and on his mandated "walkabout" where he must leave
the tribe to wander in the desert for months.  Armed only with a
self-made spear and wearing just a revealing loin cloth, he has to live
off the land.
     The girl cannot believe the aborigine does not speak English.  "We
want water," she says demanding his help.  "That's as simple as I can
make it.  Anybody can understand that."  This time it is the brother
who solves their predicament.  Using his hands and his mouth, he
communicates to the aborigine and soon the aborigine, sticking a reed
into a muddy creek bed, has the blessed water for them.
     Most of the movie occurs during their journey back to the city
with the aborigine as their guide.  Along the way, the sexual tension
between the two teenagers builds until you are sure it will explode,
but it doesn't.  Roeg uses revealing camera angles and various
flashbacks to tell the teens' story of repressed desire.  The result is
a beautifully erotic movie where not even a kiss is exchanged.
     One could easily write a long essay on this richly textured movie,
but words cannot fully express what is mainly a visual experience.  The
script by Edward Bond, based on the novel by John Vance Marshall, uses
images for dialog.  Words are rarely spoken except for the brother who
sometimes starts babbling, but these words are more background noise.
The interest in the show is the focus on the girl and the aborigine.
The chemistry between them is strong, and their few words are more than
sufficient.
     To complement the sparseness of the spoken word, the music by four
time Academy Award winner John Barry has a majesty reflective of the
film's beautiful landscapes and charming wildlife.  The movie even
includes my favorite Australian animal, the cute little wombat.
     After a surprising but effective ending, the show wraps up with a
sentimental epilogue.  Like the rest of the show, both are quite
confusing until you think about them some.  In the day since I've seen
the film, I cannot put it out of my mind.  Its images continue to be
savored, and I will never forget the three travelers through the
desert.
     WALKABOUT runs 1:40.  It is not rated but would be an R.  The film
would be excellent for teenagers.  I strongly recommend this
fascinating piece of filmmaking to you and give it my top rating of a
full ****.

When Walkabout was released nearly thirty years ago, it was widely regarded
as a cinematic pičce de rčsistance. Roeg's lush photography combined with a
deceptively elemental story yielded a film of both intoxicating beauty and
relevance. Unabashedly advertised in the film's theatrical trailer as `the
most different movie you'll ever see,' Walkabout lives up to the appellation
by being Kubrickesque in its vivid imagery and openness to interpretation.
Roeg's film is primarily about existence at the margin and the nature of
communication. What surrounds the walls that we erect and can we exist
beyond them? Walkabout suggests that cultural coexistence may be a myth; our
lives are intrinsically inclined towards an indigenous domicile and its
native tongue binds us.
The theme of home emanates from Walkabout's lyric. The comforts that lie at
one's hearth are oftentimes immeasurable. One of my fondest memories of
growing up were days at camp, but there were always the first few days that
were spent terrified of my new habitat and much time was spent longing for
home. Eventually, one gets makes friends and adapts to the new environment,
and when the two or three weeks are over, we would give anything for another
week. Oftentimes Walkabout is interpreted as a `back to nature ' movie, but
the opposite is true. The children cannot accept the outback as a place
where people call home. There are times when the Girl and her brother seem
to adapt to their surroundings, but the acceptance of the Australian Outback
is tenuous at best. The Girl meticulously keeps her school outfit clean and
makes sure she looks presentable even in the desolate desert. She even wears
her bra throughout the journey, as if clinging to the icons of her
civilization would serve as a token of her existence. Once the Girl finds
the abandoned farm, the sight of her irrepressible relief reminds us that
she still longs for familiarity . For the Girl, there is never harmony
between her home and the outback; her travels with the Aborigine were
necessary means to an end. Though the film concludes with a sense of regret,
the Girl chooses to recollect her experiences as an image of happiness, but
not as an inspiration to break the cyclical monotony of her life.
Why is the acceptance of the outback so difficult for the Girl? Nicolas Roeg
sets up the answer to the question by presenting the idea of boundaries. Man
strives for convenience and packs everything that could be desired into
dense, over-populated cities. When the cities run out of space, skyscrapers
are erected to increase capacity. The conflict between nature and civilized
man is established in shots early in the film. While the family members are
coming home, we see shots of buildings amongst trees . The mise-en-scčne of
these shots suggest a relationship between the organic and inorganic, and we
sense that their coexistence is unnatural.  Roeg comments: `All architecture
has [an artificiality]. No matter how much it is spoken about it goes with
the trees' It's artificial - whatever way you look at it. ' Another example
of this is also one of the more startling images in the film. The Father,
coming home after work, stands on the deck of their apartment and looks at
his children playing in the pool.  The POV shot is amusingly perverse; we
see the children playing in a pool by the ocean . Revenge by Mother Nature,
it seems, is exacted later in the film when the children reach an Edenic
oasis only to see the water dry up shortly after their arrival. The scene,
in a didactic way, seems to scold the children for their wasteful ways.
Juxtaposing organic elements with inorganic elements elucidate modern man's
vain efforts to exist in both a natural and synthetic world. Civilized man,
represented by the Father and the Girl, seem driven by solely by economies
of scale. And the cities become traps  walking home through a botanical
garden is no substitute for a forest just as swimming in a pool is no
substitute for the sea. At some point the Father realizes this. Trapped from
real experience, real transcendence, the Father takes his life and attempts
to spare his children of civilization's prison as well.
The opening sequence to Walkabout shows shots of brick walls which pan to
either the hubbub of Sydney or the bareness of the outback . Through these
shots, Roeg presents the viewer with the concept of boundaries. The wall
becomes a metaphor for the division between the resident and the
aboriginal  the civilized White and the primitive Black. The walls of the
modern man effectively keep the unwanted out, but to what extent are these
boundaries actually the self-imposed trappings of the civilized? Modern man
raves of technological progress, but the Father, the Girl, the Boy, and even
their automobile cannot survive in the an environment where the natives
thrive.
Walkabout explores what happens when the products of industrial civilization
are displaced to the margins of their familiar world. It is important to
note that the Girl is not dropped in the heart of the aboriginal land, but
in a border zone where two cultures meet.  Roeg makes this clear not only
through the shots of the brick wall which infer a line of demarcation
between two cultures, but also the frequent emissions of the radio, which
offers the impression that the children have not strayed far from the city.
On the flip side, though the land the children are in are certainly more
foreign to them than the Aborigine, he too, cast away from his home to
undertake the walkabout, is placed at the margins of his own society. This
subtlety should be recognized in that it relieves from the Aborigine the
burden of being a host; that is, he is on a journey of survival just as the
Girl and her brother are and he is under no obligation to play the role as a
guide for the children. In fact, in the end it is the Aborigine that does
not survive the walkabout. Their meeting takes place at a border zone where
the cultures of the city and the outback connect. By removing the schemata
of their familiar lives, Roeg presents cross-cultural communication in the
most fundamental context. Thus, what happens to the characters, which aptly
remain nameless throughout the film, becomes an allegorical tale of cultural
coexistence.
When the children first meet the Aborigine, the Girl unsuccessfully tries to
communicate with the Aborigine. `Water!' she cries repeatedly, `You must
understand. Anyone can understand that I can't make it any simpler!' The
Aborigine looks in confusion. Finally, the Girl's' younger brother makes the
gesture to drink, and the Aborigine immediately understands, and shows them
how to draw water from the ground through a reed . Herein lies the
pessimistic undertone of the film. Roger Ebert wrote: `[Walkabout] suggests
that we all develop specific skills and talents in response to our
environment, but cannot easily function across a broader range. It is not
that the Girl cannot appreciate nature or that the [Aborigine] cannot
function outside of his training. It is that all of us are the captives of
environment and programming ' Continuing further along the lines of Ebert's
hypothesis, I would suggest that the fact that the Girl, who is fourteen,
cannot effectively communicate in comparison to her younger brother further
provides a subtle point. As all children look at the world with wonder and
curiosity, the little boy in Walkabout is a reminder of the plasticity of a
child's mind. Roeg feels that the boy's age of six is crucial because it is
the point where `one begins to form proper memories. Then at eight you start
worrying about school, then at nine, ten, eleven, [you worry about] exams .'
The boy's age, according to Roeg, is at a point where one still feels secure
and trusting, but the little boy is just at the cusp of loosing that
security . For the 14 year-old Girl, even necessity for water cannot impel
creativity. She has taken for granted the power of language, and is too
jaded to feel the need to communicate in any way other than English. Her 6
year-old brother, on the other hand, is able to communicate effectively not
because he is more intelligent, but because he has had less of the
environmental programming suggested by Ebert. Like some studies which show a
critical period in which a child can effectively learn language, in this
scene, Roeg presents the idea of a critical period of communication.
Sometime between the ages of the Girl and her brother, Roeg suggests our
programming is complete - even the common tongue of gesticulation then
eludes us, and our communicative abilities become hard-wired instead of
remaining dynamic.
In Shakespeare's The Tempest, Caliban, the beast-human slave of Prospero
cries: `You taught me language, and my profit on't Is, I know how to
curse. ' The power of communication is an important theme in literature.
Prospero taught Caliban language so that he could know when to chop wood or
pick berries, not so that he could engage in philosophical debate. Because
of the inherent power in bestowing language onto another, frequently lessons
in language become a source of domination over the pupil. Certainly, Friday
was quite enamored with Crusoe for enlightening him on the White Man's ways.
Subtly, this theme is explored in Walkabout. While the little boy is willing
to talk to the Aborigine in the Aboriginal tongue, the Girl, even near the
end of the film, still insists, `Water! Water!' However, her cries are no
longer the cries for help, but akin to orders for a slave . She commands the
Aborigine to fill a bucket from the fountain at the abandoned house while
she is just as capable of filling the bucket herself. The Aborigine takes
the bucket and softly replies, `Water.' The disappointment in the Aborigine'
s face is evident as he finds his sexual advances are met with the Girl's
callous indifference. Just like Prospero and Caliban, the language shared
between the Girl and the Aborigine are words of governance, not compassion.
Under the rubric of communication, we find that Roeg again suggests that
after a certain critical period, we no longer become receptive to subtleties
of communication. The POV shots of the Girl looking at the Aborigine's
buttocks and groin early on were the first indication of a sexual interest
between the two.  There is also an erotically suggestive shot of the tree
limbs and later a POV shot of the Aborigine juxtaposing the Girl's leg next
to a tree limb in his mind's eye . Yet tragically, because neither party can
articulate their attraction for one another, the relationship turns into one
that is more effortless for both of them but detrimental to their
coexistence; the Aborigine becomes the waterboy while the Girl retreats to
dreams of the city.
If there is an instance when Roeg lets us ponder the image of coexistence,
it is in the beautifully evocative swimming scene . We see the Girl and the
Aborigine existing, if just for a moment, in a temporary Eden. The
cross-cutting  between shots of the Girl swimming and the Aborigine hunting
carry a domestic proposition  the Girl is at home with nature while the
Aborigine, under the role of her husband, works to provide for the family.
The little boy follows the Aborigine to learn the ways of hunting. For this
moment, the Girl, the Aborigine, and the boy represent Everyman; stripped of
all pretext, they exist simply as God's children, and cultural barriers
cease to be. Jenny Agutter, who plays the Girl, recalls: `[Nicolas Roeg]
wanted it to be the most innocent and beautiful sequence of the film, which
[depicts] just their living. Because if they don't have that at this point,
then there is no regret at the end .'
It is regret at the end of Walkabout that is our indication that this is not
a Back to Nature' story. Had it been such, the Girl would have stayed in
the outback, or would have at least altered her lifestyle when she returned
to the city. Roeg, however, shows us that the Girl gets married and lives in
the exact same apartment she did as a child. There are a couple jump cuts to
the brick wall, signaling her existence back within the boundaries of her
society. The situation is perverse because not only does she return from her
walkabout uninspired, she clings to the tokens of familiarity with increased
fervor. Living in the same block flat looking over the same pool - she even
marries a man who works in the same building as her father. The lessons
learned in the outback are lost and she has come full circle. It is
understood that one day the Girl, now a woman, will look over the deck at
her own kids playing in the pool by the ocean and realize like her father
before her, the sterility of their existence. Unlike her father, however,
she will be burdened by the memory of her moment of transcendence and how
she failed to grasp it.
Walkabout is not an indictment of industrialization or technology. The
barriers to communication were built with bricks from both sides of the
wall. The civilized trap themselves in a synthesized existence and the
primitive stodgily adhere to ways of the old. While the Girl could not find
solace outside her programmed environment, the Aborigine was equally
ineffective in coexisting with the Girl. The message in Walkabout, however,
is not entirely pessimistic. Though the final scene may be colored with
regret, we also notice the little boy, who must now be a young man, missing
from the scene. Perhaps there is a period in one's life where one can still
be enlightened. Roeg leaves the possibility that somewhere out there the boy
exists, and carrying the lessons learned on the happy highways of his youth,
he continues to wonder, communicate, and coexist with all people. We hold
within ourselves the similar hope that we shall never lose such ability to
be inspired.
