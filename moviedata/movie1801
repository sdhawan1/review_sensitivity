PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
It seems to be an annual tradition this time of year.  I'm not talking
about Christmas shopping or trimming the tree or even packing yourself
full of turkey and pie.  The custom I refer to is that of heaping oodles
of undeserving praise on a small, independent foreign film.  Last year,
it was the Brazilian festival fave Central Station, which nabbed two
Oscar nominations (for Best Actress and Best Foreign Film).  This year,
it's Pedro Almodóvar's All About My Mother.
Don't get me wrong  it's not a bad movie at all.  In fact, it's better
than Central Station.  But a Best Director win at Cannes?  Two European
Film Award nominations (Picture and Actress)?  And five-star review
after five-star review?  I just don't get it.  I would have to use two
hands to count the number of superior films in competition at Cannes.
Better than Kikujiro?  Not a chance in hell.  Among other favorites,
Almodóvar beat David Lynch, Peter Greenaway, Jim Jarmusch, Atom Egoyan,
John Sayles, Michael Winterbottom and Tim Robbins for the Best Director
award.
The film centers around a woman in her late thirties named Manuela
(Cecilia Roth  think Deborah Kara Unger in about ten years).  She's a
hospital nurse and single mom with a seventeen-year-old son named
Esteban (Eloy Azorín) who dreams of becoming a writer.  As the picture
opens, Manuela and Esteban watch a dubbed version of All About Eve,
discussing the translation of its title into Spanish (so you'll be
watching English subtitles of an American film dubbed in Spanish  oy
vey!).  For Esteban's birthday, the two take in a stage performance of A
Streetcar Named Desire, but he is killed in an accident trying to get an
autograph after the show.
This is where Almodóvar (Live Flesh) shines, tactfully blending scenes
from both Eve and the stage version of Streetcar to underscore the
emotion of his characters.  Add to that a nifty ironic twist early on
involving organ donation that I won't reveal here, even though I've
heard he used a similar theme in The Flower of My Secret (which I've
never seen).  The use of Streetcar is serendipitous as Manuela actually
played Stella several years ago in a Barcelona production, opposite a
Kowalski that became Esteban's father.  She always told her son that his
father died before he was born but in reality, Manuela took off for
Madrid, pregnant with Esteban and neglecting to tell the father.
All About My Mother, an obvious homage to the title of All About Eve, is
basically the story of Manuela's attempt to track down the father of her
child in Barcelona, reversing her journey from seventeen years ago.  She
meets many zany characters along the way, including a pregnant nun
(Penélope Cruz), a transsexual (Antonia San Juan), a junkie (Candela
Peńa) and an actress (Marisa Paredes).  Each woman helps to demonstrate
a powerful quote from the film - `Women will do anything to avoid being
alone.'
Mother, like other Almodóvar films, is a non-stop visual assault of
bright, beautiful colors (his Live Flesh cinematographer Affonso Beato
is back here).  He's a brilliant director, and his cast is full of
fantastic actresses (namely Roth), but the story isn't all there.  It
plays like a cheesy Spanish soap opera that you might stumble upon
flipping through cable stations.  I have a feeling that guy in the giant
bee costume may be more entertaining. Alberto Iglesias provides the
acoustic-heavy score.
1:45 - R for sexuality including strong sexual dialogue, nudity, adult
language and drug content

ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER (TODO SOBRE MI MADRE) (director/writer: Pedro
Almodóvar; cinematographer: Affonso Beato; cast: Cecilia Roth (Manuela),
Marisa Paredes (Huma Rojo), Candel Pena (Nina), Antonia San Juan
(Agrado), Penelope Cruz (Sister Rosa), Rosa Maria Sarda (Rosa's mother),
Fernando Fernan Gomez (Rosa's father), Toni Canto (Lola), Eloy Azorin
(Esteban), 1999-Spain)
Cecilia Roth, the wonderful Argentinian-born actress, is the focal point
of the film and it is fair to say that her outstanding performance tries
to portray what the director wants to say about the nature of
motherhood. She plays Manuela, a 38-year-old nurse coordinator in a
transplant organ unit in a Madrid hospital. She is a single-parent with
a son Esteban (Eloy Azorín), who wants to be a writer and is about to
celebrate his 17th birthday. He is watching TV with her and the movie
"All About Eve" is on, which encourages him to write in his pad, "All
About My Mother."
The boy's favorite writer is Truman Capote. For his birthday present,
Manuela takes him to the theater to see Tennessee Williams' "A Streetcar
Named Desire." The enthusiastic youngster, always with a notebook near
him, always ready to jot down things in his journal, such as his wish to
know who his father is, is star-struck by the masterly performance of
the aging actress playing Blanche Dubois, Huma (Marides). He waits for
her in the rain by the stage door with his mother after the show to get
her autograph, and when she gets in a cab he chases after her but gets
fatally hit by a car. This is filmed from his eye-sight view of the
accident, so what the audience sees is what he saw.
His mother is asked to donate his organs by the same doctors she works
with, the ones who just completed a dry-run of what it is like for
family members to be asked to be organ donors. In this film there is
little difference between what is real and what is fake. After she
agrees to donate his organs, she decides to fulfill her son's wish to
find the boy's father and she goes back to Barcelona, where she came
from 18 years ago. She has lost all contact with the father while in
Madrid and will try to retrace her steps.
But, before she goes on the journey, she must see who received her son's
heart and is relieved to see it is a decent fellow, as she watches him
leave the hospital and overhears him from her hiding place gleefully
talking about having a young man's heart him in.
This is the 13th Pedro Almodóvar film I have seen, one that many critics
say shows the aging, enfant terrible director maturing, becoming kinder
and gentler, showing a capacity for making a film with more of a
conventional plot and being less interested in shocking his audience as
he once loved to do. But the shock is still there, enough of it to keep
it from becoming a mainstream film. The shock comes from the characters
Manuela will meet on her journey back to where she hung around with
prostitutes and transvestites. To visually show her path back and forth
from Barcelona to Madrid, there is a stunningly photographed tunnel
looking very much like a womb, with a train racing through it.
Though the film has a pungency to it, there are just too many scenes
where the wit seems forced and doesn't flow in the natural rhythm of the
story. The film is filled with many references and homages to other
Hollywood films and to writers, something that is both good and bad. It
is good because too many films are devoid of any intellectual
influences. Bad because the references are overused here, making the
director's gushy homages too syrupy for my taste buds.
In Barcelona, Manuela meets again her friend Agrado (Antonia San Juan- a
popular nightclub performer, who plays this role in an amusingly
unrestrained manner). He is a transvestite prostitute, working in an
outdoor area known as the Field, where the customers are riding around
in a circle to look the odd assortment of male and female prostitutes
over, a very Fellini-like scene. Symbolically, it indicates that
Manuela's life is going around in circles, she is back to where she
started as a prostitute. Agrado was an actor with her in an amateur
production of the Tennessee Williams's play; he was a man then but has
since had breast implants and a complete make over to look like a woman.
He is upset because his transvestite lover, who used to be called
Esteban but now is Lola (Canto), has just run away from him. Lola also
happens to be another actor in that amateur play 18 years ago that
Agrado and Manuela were in and the father of Manuela's child. But he
doesn't know that.
This is a story about many different things: its subplots could take you
into areas such as organ donors, AIDS, coincidences, family
relationships, family values, and the affects of pop culture on the
public (take note of that hilarious diaper commercial, an actual one
shown on Spanish TV); but, the film's main premises were about: praising
actresses, praising motherhood, praising sexual ambiguity, and praising
the kindness from strangers (tolerance of all people seems to be the
strongest message emanating from the film).
The mixed feelings I got about the film come from my not being sure if
this film is meant to be taken as a parody or a tragic soap opera. My
perception of all the supporting characters was of them being
problematic: the two transvestites; a pregnant nun with AIDS who
counsels needy prostitutes; Huma, as an actress, who is in a hopeless
lesbian relationship with another actress, the junky Nina (Pena); and,
all the while, this is a story about women as actresses and as mothers
and as sexually ambiguous figures. There were times I didn't know
whether I was supposed to laugh at all this or cry.
This film is melodramatic in the tradition of the Douglas Sirk nuclear
family romantic Rock Hudson and Dorothy Malone ones of the 1950s, but
with Almodóvar, it becomes even a weepier one, one that is mostly
outrageous, one whose family nature is more ambiguous and certainly not
nuclear. It is a film that is paradoxical: men can be actresses also. It
is one that has a character who takes the name Agrado, which means
agreeable and an actress, Huma, who is influenced by Bette Davis in "All
About Eve," whose chosen name means chain-smoker. Bette influenced her
totally, including her smoking habit.
The deftness of the cinematography and the array of colors displayed are
simply dazzling. This film could be enjoyed solely for its bright
orange, red and yellow patterns, giving the eye a startling light show
to feast on, as the camera is constantly moving from one thing of beauty
to another. It is a film made by someone who has the self-confidence to
know who he is (a beautiful gay man) and to realize that his film will
be different things to different people: to those searching for their
own identity, it could be seen how resilient the characters are who are
adding body parts to change their sexual orientation. For the ones
adjusting to the loss of the dearest one in their life, like Manuela,
after having given away the deceased's body parts, it could be a way of
accepting change. The characters in this film will find ways to adjust
to their situation, these are not characters who will fall apart and
have nervous breakdowns. It is worth noting, that there is no criticism
by the director for any of his characters, no matter how they screw
things up.
What Almodóvar wishes to express, is his adoration for all women. He
dedicated the film to actresses who played actresses: Bette Davis, Gena
Rowlands, and Romy Schneider. The problem with all this adulation is
that all the flattery has a hollow ring to it, it is just too good to be
true, and his characters are not completely believable because of this.
The film's strength lies in the emotions of the characters; their
close-ups revealing an inner strength in them, that no matter what
they've been through, they will stick together and not succumb to their
overwhelming problems. Agrado, after being battered by a psychopath,
gets dressed in her imitation pink Chanel dress and takes Manuela to
meet the attractive Sister Rosa (Penélope Cruz) in the prostitutes'
shelter. In return Agrado is consoled by the empathetic Manuela. A
pregnant nun in an Almodóvar film shouldn't be that surprising to his
fans, in fact what else should they expect! The father of Sister Rosa's
child, by coincidence, is Lola, the same father of Manuela's child. The
anguished Sister Rosa will come to live in the apartment that Manuela
rents and be nursed by the woman who is both a tower of strength and a
fragile grieving mother.
When the older and younger women form a warm relationship, Manuela is
introduced to Rosa's so-called normal but not-knowing-how-to-love
parents. She first meets her wealthy mother (Sarda), who makes fake
Chagalls. This is another of the director's themes, of how the ones who
are supposed to be normal and try so hard to convey that impression, are
really fakes, while the ones who are considered to be oddballs in
society, could be the normal ones, who are at least living out their
fantasies. Later on, Manuela will meet Rosa's father (Gomez), who might
have Alzheimer's, or maybe he just doesn't seem to remember who his
daughter is. The family dog is the one who remembers her. The hurt look
on Rosa's face after her father leaves, gives us a picture of her
thought process that is better than dialogue, it is one that is worth
savoring.
There is one scene when Agrado announces that the performance of
"Streetcar..." will be cancelled but for those who want to stay, she
will tell her life story. Of course, this clears most of the audience
out, with those few remaining being mostly the young and more daring
ones, the same audience that has sustained the director over the years.
She proceeds to tell how he got put together into a she and how much
each part cost, in a comic bit that seemed, at least it did to me, that
the director was trying to please his audience too much.Trying to
convince everyone remaining that they could be who they want to be, all
they have to do is pay the price for their dreams.
The actors were all splendid. I was particularly impressed by Marisa
Paredes' subtle but invigorating performance. The aging actress had a
certain air about her that invigorated every scene she was in, showing
how vulnerable and engaging an actress she is. Cecilia Roth was the glue
that held the film together. But when the spotlight was on Marisa, what
the director was trying to say about actresses' had a clarity about it
that didn't seem forced.
But still, what makes an Almodóvar film special, is his eye for visual
effects. I haven't seen a more stunning visual film all year (it is
comparable to Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut"). I was so dazzled by the
visuals, that the film's metaphors, bizarre tale, and great actors, seem
to take second place to the visual splendor of the film.
As good as this film is, one of the problems Almodóvar still has, is
that he can't make his outrageous characters distinguishable from
caricatures. Making them seem normal by comparing them to the normal
parents of Cruz', or those normal theater patrons walking out of that
childish Agrado discourse when they paid good money to see a play and
not him lecture them about how he paid his dues to be the girl he is, is
not really making them seem normal. This cloy act of his does not make
Agrado any more compelling. What the director shows best is his
unyielding love to all these strange characters, the social outcasts,
those who are looked down by society. He treats them as if he was the
mother, the one who loves them for what they are, who loves them as only
a mother can love her own. His wish seems to be that society would also
give them a chance to be loved.
One must give Almodóvar credit for getting his voice heard in the
mainstream while keeping his artististic integrity intact. That is not
an easy thing to do and the director has used the popular vehicle of
Hollywood melodrama to add his own sense of culture and literary
references to it, despite the differences I have with his approach to
the characters and their development. The film's story line is ludicrous
but the hurt the characters receive as perceived by them is real.
Almodóvar retains in this work an intriguing call for the bizarre, that
keeps the film from descending toward being a Hollywood one. But it also
never reaches great artistic heights. There are no breakthroughs in
character study. This is basically still a message film. A most amusing
and diverting portrayal of the sexually ambiguous, but not a great film.
The critical success of this film makes for strange bedfellows, when the
'chic' Cannes crowd hooted in disappointment that the film wasn't chosen
as the best one in the festival, but cheered when Almodóvar won for best
director, they now might be considered as part of the usual Almodóvar
fan base of weirdoes and independent-minded movie goers, a fan base that
seems to be growing to accomodate a different type of enthusiast, one
that is more establishment orientated.

All About My Mother (Todo sobre mi madre) (R) 
Starring Cecilia Roth, Penelope Cruz, and Eloy Azorin
Directed by Pedro Almodovar
Running Time: 105 Minutes
Released by Sony Pictures Classics
Reviewed by Frankie Paiva
There are only a selected handful of films that manage to be funny, yet be
extremely sad at the exact same moment in time. All About My Mother is one of
those films. The movie, which is filled with beautiful scenery and gorgeous
settings, has this ability to affect you by printing haunting images onto your
brain, and making sure they stay there.
Manuela (Roth) takes her son Esteban (Azorin) to a touring production of "A
Streetcar Named Desire" for his birthday. He is delighted by the show and
decides to wait outside in the rain to ask one of the lead actresses for her
autograph. He is determined to get it, and he runs after her when she speeds
away in a taxi. At an intersection, he is run over by a car and killed. He
died, never knowing who his father really was, and Manuela was going to tell
him all about his dad that night as his birthday present. 
The grief stricken Manuela decides to go back to Barcelona to meet up with
his father, but there is a catch. Not only does the dad not know he has a son,
he also happens to be a transsexual who know goes by the name of Lola, and is
contributing to the spread of AIDS across the city. She rents an apartment, and
while in town, takes in a pregnant nun with a foreboding mother and helps her
through her pregnancy. She also meets up with her friend Agrado (Antonia San
Juan), who I believe was supposed to be a woman playing a woman but in this
movie it's kind of hard to be sure. These three women soon begin a rapidly
growing bond of friendship, a bond that is later shared with the lead actress
from Streetcar, who is currently in town for the show. Each of these four women
have problems, and each one of them will have help to deal with them.
It's hard to think of where to begin with this film. For starters, the
cinematography and camera work is superb. The use of color is remarkable and
adds life to and electricity that seeps throughout the entire picture. But not
everything is vibrant and rosy. The film also has some chilling moments, and a
particular scene involving Manuela circling a field full of hookers offering
themselves to, and being raped by men is (in my opinion) the most haunting and
depressing scene of any film this year. The film's main theme is death and
disease, and the pain caused by both, but much of the abundant humor
overshadows the dark undertones. There is an amazing monologue that Agrado
delivers about her life late in the film, that is so funny and hilarious, you
can download it on the AAMM website. 
There are many great performances in the film, Cecilia Roth shines as the
vulnerable, but strong heroine of the movie and San Juan is just beyond belief
as
Agrado. But the real star of the film is director Pedro Almodovar, everything
in the film looks amazing and all of the scenes are well thought out. This may
finally be his chance to be noticed by the mainstream audience, as the film is
likely to pick up this year's Best Foreign Film Oscar. An overall good film,
almost all of the testosterone in the audience will be lost, but it will still
be enjoyable for both genders. If you are looking for a great movie to see,
find the theater near you playing All About My Mother.
Overall Grade: B+                        Rated R for for sexuality including
strong sexual dialogue, language, and some drug content
The Young-Uns: While the film would be OK for older teens, they will probably
be bored. Good Age: 15 and up

Starring Cecilia Roth, Antonia San Juan, Penélope Cruz, Marisa
Paredes, Candela Pena;
Written & Directed by Pedro Almodóvar;
Cinematography by Affonso Beato
        In the opening scenes of Pedro Almodóvar's ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER,
Esteban is preparing to write a story about his mother, Manuela (Cecilia
Roth); we are shown excerpts from Joseph L. Mankiewicz's ALL ABOUT EVE;
mother and son attend a performance of Tennessee Williams's "A Streetcar
Named Desire" on Esteban's seventeenth birthday.  These are all
refererences to stories about women, written by men.  And then Esteban is
run over by a car.  His story about his mother remains incomplete.
        The rest of the movie belongs to women: other than Esteban, the
only male characters of any significance are a senile father who no longer
recognizes his own daughter and a stagehand obsessed with sex.  There are
also two transsexuals who have opted to become women.  The suggestion is
that the death of Manuela's son represents the termination of the masculine
viewpoint: instead of men's stories about women, we will be given access to
a film about women, seen from the vantage of women.  It's a rather
disingenuous suggestion on the part of Almodóvar (LIVE FLESH), who is of
course a man--and the author of the movie--but what follows represents an
admirable attempt to represent the complexities of women.
        A bare bones outline of the plot might suggest the flamboyant
nature of the director's earlier work.  Woman's son dies in freak accident.
Woman abandons her job and heads to Madrid.  Woman meets a transsexual
friend (Antonia San Juan), befriends a pregnant nun (Penélope Cruz),
becomes assistant to an aging actress (Marisa Paredes) and has to deal with
her young, sullen, self-destructive, heroin-addicted mistress (Candela
Pena).  But Almodóvar treats the material as straight melodrama, more or
less, not as farce.
        The movie has a sense of humour and is sometimes provocative, but
the tone is rather sombre.  The emotions it reaches for are undistorted by
irony.  We are asked to accept these women just as they are given to
us--prone to extravagent emotional outbursts, their lives governed by
far-fetched coincidences.  In this respect, ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER resembles
soap opera, which likewise expects to be taken at face value (and whose
audience is primarily female).  Soap opera itself is a form which descends
from the sentimental fiction of the 18th century, when novelists like
Samuel Richardson wrote mammoth serialized novels--about women, for women.
        All of which is to say that ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER makes use of
fictional forms that are traditionally associated with women, and has fun
with them.  It's a fascinating film in terms of its manipulation of ideas
about gender, but as a viewing experience it is perhaps too languorous and
comfortable.  The urgency and effrontery of Almodóvar's earlier work is
missing.  Despite the playful approach to gender roles, the movie relies on
the clichés of sentimental fiction to the point where it at times seems no
more than a humdrum melodramatic tearjerker.  There is an instance of the
tired routine in which a woman throws up for no apparent reason--and, of
course, it later turns out that she's pregnant.  Almodóvar makes use of
this cliché without ironizing it or putting it to the service of the film,
and so it remains no more than a cliché, a shortcoming.
        The women in ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER represent most of the customary
female roles and stereotypes: mother, daughter, nurse, actress, lesbian,
prostitute, nun.  What is most complex and rewarding about the movie is the
manner in which the various women slip from one category to another,
inhabiting numerous roles, wearing them like an endless succession of
masks.  We learn, for example, that a young nun (Penelope Cruz) is
pregnant, and that she was impregnated by an older transsexual; our
preconceptions become worthless.  At the end, we are told that one of the
lesbian characters has married a man and had a child.  Manuela herself, the
emotional centre of the movie, is mother, friend, confidante, nurturer, and
much more besides.  She can be vulnerable, tough, bitchy, playful: she
cannot be pinned down.  By fostering slippages and tensions, by undermining
conventions and expectations, the movie allows the intricacies of
personalities which resist stereotyping to emerge.
        The notion that women's social roles represent a series of
performances is fundamental: two characters are actresses, Manuela performs
in a play one night, and Manuela's transsexual friend gives a theatrical
monologue about herself which verbally duplicates the construction of
female identity she has undertaken through surgery, make-up, implants,
hormonal treatments, etc.  He has become she: the result of her own
constructs and not those of society or biology.  Almodóvar's underlying
message seems to be that a woman is what she makes herself out to be,
irrespective of what others would impose on her.  One female stereotype is
notable for its absence: woman as victim.

filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member James Brundage.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/386ecdfa63236c958825684b000a144d?OpenDocument
 Director Pedro Almodovar explains the relationship between tunnels and
the main character of Manuela (Cecila Roth) in All About my Mother with
the line: "Manuela runs away.  She always runs away on a train, through
endless tunnels."
 Indeed, Manuela is always moving.  With the untimely death of her son,
Estoban, she moves to Barcelona to embark upon a search for Estoban's
father.  In Barcelona, she is constantly moving from one place to
another, doing something or another for someone.  Save a transsexual
prostitute here (Antonio San Juan), help a pregnant nun there (Penelope
Cruz).  Help smooth out the turbulent lesbian relationship between two
actresses (Marisa Paredes and Candela Pena) here, usher an older woman
(Rosa Maria Sarda) into a great understanding of life there.  She never
stops.
 It seems so odd, then, that the one thing that All About my Mother
would have needed to be a really great film was a better pace.
 All About My Mother is an interesting, somewhat surreal and oftentimes
bizarre journey of self-discovery that comes during the search of
Manuela for her transsexual ex-husband, Lola.  Admittedly, it is one of
more bizarre foreign films I have seen (although this is not a long list
and Il Mostro was pretty trippy, too).  However, All About My Mother
does end up being an incredibly interesting film to watch.
 Penned and directed by Pedro Almodovar, All About my Mother succeeds is
doing several noteworthy things.  The first of which is making critics
laugh.  I saw this at a Cleveland press-only screening with five other
critics, and we all had at least a few moments where we unleashed our
tongue to let loose a chuckle.  The second of which is accomplishing
what amounts to a nearly all-female cast.  In the cast we have one
supporting male, the boy who plays Estoban.  The rest of the film is
comprised of women, and thus it is like watching a Spanish version of
the cafe scenes in "Sex and the City" for about an hour and
three-quarters.  The third and final thing is accomplishing a movie
which deserves a second glance.
 To fans of the surreal, who normally can handle subtitles, All About my
Mother will be quite a treat.  It is a film that is able to easily
provide interesting imagery (a joint effort of the great directing on
behalf Pedro Almodovar and the haunting photography of Affonso Beato),
incredible dialogue, and at the same time make you ponder over it.
 Despite these three major strengths, however, All About my Mother is
lacking in one major element: pace.  Certain movies can engage
themselves upon thought alone.  Others rely on action.  Because All
About my Mother has absolutely no action to it, it must rely entirely
upon thought for pacing.  The thought in All About my Mother is enough
to fill perhaps a thirty-minute short.  There is simply not enough
pacing present to sustain this film.
 All About my Mother has been voted the best foreign film of the year by
several major critics circles.  To say this about All About my Mother
makes me wonder what the other foreign films were like this year.  It's
good.  It gets a lukewarm recommendation.  But its not that great.
 Then again, that's the problem when you have to give a film points just
for being foreign.

   In James L. Brooks's comedy "As Good As It Gets," when
a receptionist asks celebrated novelist Melvin Udall how he
writes women so authentically, he replies, "I think of a man. 
Then I take away reason."  By contrast, Pedro Almodovar
bears no malice toward the female sex.  His latest film, which
won him the best director prize at the last Cannes Film
Festival, is billed as a homage to all women and to all people
who want to be women.  While Almodovar--perhaps Spain's
greatest director since Luis Bunuel--breaks with his past
custom of portraying off-the-wall characters against surreal
settings, he retains an affection for unusual people.  In "All
About My Mother," a moving, sometimes melodramatic
meditation upon a group of women who become good friends
and support one another through their heartaches and
troubles, the prolific forty-eight year old regisseur creates a
somewhat autobiographical picture across a boldly-colored
canvas.  In a movie flawed only by an unusual number of
coincidences, he focuses on a nurse whose tragedies began
when her husband ran away from their Madrid home to
Barcelona to become a woman, later to become tragically
involved with yet another woman whom he callously
abandons as well. 
   Directing "All About My Father" at an often fevered
emotional pitch, Almodovar centers on the 38-year-old
Manuela (Cecilia Roth) who has a mutually dependent
relationship with her 17-year-old son and would-be novelist,
Esteban (Eloy Azorin).  When the boy, a Truman Capote fan,
is run down and killed by a car while seeking the autograph
of actress Huma Rojo (Marisa Paredes), Manuela is
traumatized, quits her job, and goes in search of the boy's
father (Toni Canto)--who has become a transsexual living in
Barcelona.  After running into a transsexual friend from
Madrid, La Agrado (Antonia San Juan), whom she saves from
a beating in a red light district of Barcelona, she is hired as
an assistant to actress Huma Rojo, who is currently
performing the role of Blanche DuBois in Tennessee Williams'
"Streetcar Named Desire." Manuela also meets Huma's
significant other, Nina (Candela Pena) who is in the role of
Stella, and Sister Rosa (Penelope Cruz) who prepares to go
to El Salvador to replace a murdered nun when she is
hindered from the assignment by an unusual predicament.
   A kind of tagline to the movie which is utilized by
Almodovar is Truman Capote's quote, "When God gives you
a gift, He hands you a whip."  This becomes clear as a
calamity falls upon one women after another some time
following her attainment of a blessing.  Despite their
misfortunes--or perhaps because of them--Almodovar treats
these people whom only a mother could love with the
greatest respect and dignity, showing the special spot he
carries in his heart for the walking wounded and society's
outcasts. Drug addicts, abused nuns, transvestites and
transsexuals, whores, lesbians--all fall under the man's
umbrella and are accorded compassion and affection.    
   "You're more authentic the more you resemble what you
dream you are," is promoted as a manifesto of the film's
comic genius, Antonia San Juan (in the role of the heavily
plasticized La Agrado).  This pronouncement is obviously the
driving force of the warmth we feel for each of the
personalities portrayed, and interpreted by Almodovar with
camera work that shows an attention to detail and a fancy for
luminous colors.  The jazzy soundtrack gives an upbeat tone
to a film which is serious about the plight of the women while
remaining always heedlessly optimistic.

     Pedro Almodovar has always been a filmmaker with a world view that
is -- to engage in a bit of understatement -- unique. He loves the blurry
lines of sexuality; he loves the complexities of romantic relationships. 
He even seems to have some strange fascination with organ donation (if
memory serves, THE FLOWER OF MY SECRET featured a role play strangely
similar to that in ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER). Most of all, however, he loves
women, and has dedicated most of his films to their psychology. Yet even
when it comes to a subject like half the human race, Almodovar won't do
things the easy way. Take the decidedly non-nuclear family created in ALL
ABOUT MY MOTHER, for example: a single mother; a pregnant, HIV-positive
nun; a transvestite prostitute; a lesbian actress; and the actress's
heroin-addicted lover.
     Almodovar's critics have often accused him of being more fond of
the conspicuously provocative than with genuine emotional content. ALL
ABOUT MY MOTHER proves that he can ground his wild side in honest 
humanity.  Cecilia Roth stars as Manuela, the single mother whose
17-year-old son Esteban (Eloy Azorin) wants to know the truth about the
father Manuela has long claimed died before Esteban was born. Manuela
intends to tell the story, but Esteban is killed in an accident before she
can. The tragedy sends Manuela on a trip to Barcelona -- the city Manuela
fled when she learned she was pregnant -- in search of Esteban's father. 
There she meets up with the transvestite prostitute Agrado (Antonia San
Juan), an old friend, as well as a kindly young nun named Rosa (Penelope
Cruz). Then Manuela learns that Rosa is pregnant, and that the father was
another transvestite prostitute named Lola. And the plot thickens ...
     Or at least it gets dense with women on the verge of various
breakdowns. Along the way Manuela becomes a personal assistant to the
renowned stage actress Huma Rojo (Almodovar stalwart Marisa Paredes),
helping Huma both professionally and in her tempestuous relationship with
co-star Nina (Candela Pena). Manuela also tries to ease tensions between
Rosa and her judgmental mother (Rosa Maria Sarda), who herself has to care
for an increasingly senile husband (Fernando Fernan Gomez). In a sense,
it's a lot like an art house spin on broad Hollywood dramedies about the
power of sistah-hood, with the male characters either utterly peripheral
or half-female themselves. The women cope with tragedy, grow and learn,
depending on each other for support. In true Sister Sledge fashion, they
are fam-a-lee.
     The reason ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER doesn't inspire world-class eye
rolling (like, for instance, HANGING UP) is that Almodovar really does
want to make his characters complete. Cecilia Roth in particular is
exceptional as the grief-stricken mother who finds some peace by bringing
peace to others. Much of the comic relief is provided by the tart-tongued
Agrado, performed with depth beyond bitchy clichs by Antonia San Juan. 
Almodovar wraps the story in references to ALL ABOUT EVE (from which the
film draws its variation-on-a-theme title) and A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE
(the play in which Huma and Nina are performing as Blanche and Stella,
respectively) to underscore the more interdependent relationships of his
characters. These women aren't out to screw each other over, nor are they
going to be victimized by men. They're strong, and prepared to survive.
     Almodovar's all-encompassing embrace of womankind could strike some
viewers as inherently undramatic -- and in a sense, they'd be right. Aside
from the accident that claims Manuela's son, there really isn't a pivotal
plot moment in ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER. It's more of a general observation of
the maternal instinct, with a magical medical cure thrown in for good
measure. And it's hard to describe except to say that it works -- as
character study, as off-beat comedy, as defense of unconventional 
matriarchy.  You won't find many films that are simultaneously this warm
and fuzzy and this weird. In the Almodovar universe, you can hear those
women roar in numbers too big -- and variations too strange and wonderful
-- to ignore.

Spanish writer and director Pedro Almodóvar (WOMEN ON THE VERGE OF A
NERVOUS BREAKDOWN) loves to create movies featuring a cornucopia of
colorful characters.  In ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER he throws in everything but
the kitchen sink.  (Actually, for all we know, the sink may be there but
dressed up as something else.)
ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER (TODO SOBRE MI MADRE) has everything from a
pregnant, HIV-positive nun, Sister Rosa (Penélope Cruz), to a
transsexual, Agrado (Antonia San Juan), who has a female top and a male
bottom.  There's also a lesbian actress, Huma Rojo (Marisa Paredes),
with a drug addicted girlfriend, Nina (Candela Peńa).
Soon after the movie opens, the story's protagonist, Manuela (Cecilia
Roth), loses her teenaged son, Esteban (Eloy Azorín).  As he chases
after Huma and Nina's taxi, he is killed by another car.
Her son's death sets Manuela off on a journey to locate his father, with
whom she lost contact after her son's birth.  Given the rest of the
plot, you probably will not be surprised to learn that her ex-husband is
an ex-man, now woman, named Lola (Toni Cantó).  It gets even more
complicated and convoluted.
One's enjoyment of the story depends on whether all of this quirkiness
is enough to sustain your interests.  After a while, I just got tired of
all of the overly cute twists and turns in the plot.  Some of the acting
is good, but that's about it.
ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER runs 1:45.  The film is in Spanish with English
subtitles.  It is rated R for sexuality including strong sexual
dialogue, language and some drug content and would be acceptable for
older teenagers.

Susan Granger's review of "ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER" (Sony Pictures Classics)
This is the foreign language picture you'll be hearing about in
the coming awards season. It's the 13th film and best work so far from
Spanish film-maker Pedro Almodovar, who gave us unconventional fare
like The Flower of My Secret, Live Flesh, and Women on the Verge of a
Nervous Breakdown. This baroque, non-judgemental film about femaleness
- what it means to be female - tells the story of Manuela (Cecilia
Roth), whose teenage son is killed by a car. Honoring her son's wish
to learn more about the father he never knew, she goes she goes back
to her native Barcelona to locate the man she fled from nearly 20
years earlier - a man now known as Lola. Finding herself amidst drug
addicts and transvestite hookers, she befriends another former
companion, Agrado (Antonio San Juan), who introduces her to Sister
Rosa (Penelope Cruz), a nun whose own secret connection to Manuela is
cleverly interwoven into the criss-crossing fabric of coincidences and
interconnections as she comes to reconcile with ghosts from her
past. For inspiration in creating these characters, Almodovar draws on
many sources: A Streetcar Named Desire, echoing Blanche Dubois' famous
line: "I've always depended on the kindness of strangers...", All
About Eve, from which the title and character comes, and, primarily,
John Cassavetes' Opening Night, in which a Broadway actress (Gena
Rowlands) is haunted by the accidental death of an idolatrous young
woman.  But Almodovar creates a fascinating, often hilariously funny
work that stands on its own, evolving into a magnificent, if
melodramatic, meditation on female solidarity. Almodovar calls it a
"screwball drama." On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, All About My
Mother is a poignant 10. It's 1999's best foreign language film.

drug-addicted character)
Pedro Almodovar made several shorts in 1974-79 and 13 features since 
1980 ("Dark Habits,'' Matador,'' "Women on the Verge of a Nervous 
Breakdown,'' "High Heels," etc.)  Though in Number 14    Almodovar 
seems to be gentler and kinder, it is no 180-degree departure from 
his past work. The enfant terrible of Spanish cinema, whether on the 
surface or below it, has always been kind,  gentle and humorous, and 
"Mother" has a lot of humor. It also has a lot of sadness, but it is 
mostly overcome by spunk, love and women's solidarity. For this is a 
movie  about women, dedicated to them, and placing them on some 
--admittedly weird--pedestals --and a paean to motherhood.
Enchanting, Argentina-born Cecilia Roth plays Manuela. In Madrid, she 
is a nurse, a coordinator of transplants in a hospital, and the 
single mother of Esteban. The mother-son relationship is beautiful in 
its friendship and affection. The boy, charming, smart, gifted, 
precociously cultured, wants to be a writer. He's already keeping 
notes.  Manuela has told that his father died before Esteban was 
born, but she keeps mum about anything regarding that man. She has 
old photos of herself where one-half is torn off. It is clear to the 
young man that the missing part portrayed his father. Esteban is 
curious.
On his 17th birthday Manuela and her son watch on TV the film "All 
About Eve." Inspired, Esteban titles his notebook "All About my 
Mother."
The two go to the theater. The much-admired Huma Rojo plays Blanche 
in "A Streetcar Named Desire." After the show, as Esteban rushes in 
the rain to get the star's autograph, he gets killed by a car. With 
black irony, Manuela is asked for permission to transplant his heart.
The movie is so rich in characters and episodes that detailing them 
would be a disservice to potential viewers.  Simplifying  the story, 
I will say that Manuela, after an 18-year absence from her native 
Barcelona, returns to find the boy's father, to tell him that he had 
a son, that the son always thought of his father. For the latter, 
also named Esteban, was alive (but not well), and had become Lola.
You have to stay alert to figure out who the characters are, and 
what, including Manuela in her earlier days. Let's just state that 
the milieu in which Manuela will move in Barcelona is one of 
prostitutes, transvestites, transsexuals and other "exceptional" 
cases. Yet it remains an essentially warm and loving circle, partly 
because of a line quoted from "Streetcar," about 'the kindness of 
strangers.'
Coincidences abound in the movie, but do not distract or detract. 
Manuela's quest for Lola starts with a meeting of an old friend, the 
transsexual prostitute Agrado, which roughly translated means "I 
please." This in turn leads to  pretty young nun Rosa, who cares for 
destitute prostitutes. Rosa is the alienated (but not in the usual 
way) child of a mother who paints fake Chagalls, and a father who has 
Alzheimer's or something like that. He's totally out of it.
The plot then adds the presence of the "Streetcar" troupe that is now 
playing in Barcelona; the connections of, first Manuela, then Agrado, 
with the thespians; the lesbian affair between Huma (the name means 
roughly "chainsmoker") and Nina, who plays Stella. Says Huma:" Nina 
is addicted to heroin, I am addicted to Nina." Then comes the 
revelation that Rosa is pregnant (by, guess who? Lola! ) and 
HIV-positive.
This is melodrama --down to the near-miraculous happy ending two 
years later.-- barefaced and proud of it. In American cinema the 
German-born Douglas Sirk was notorious  for his melodramas. Wild and 
woolly Almodovar runs circles around Sirk and such. He is enamored of 
Hollywood melodramatic films (cited among other filmic references) as 
well as Latin American movies of that type. It may sound like a 
penchant for pop culture, but then I remember that the great 
critic-scholar of theater Eric Bentley declared (if my quotation is 
right) that "Melodrama is the essence of theater."
Melodrama with twist after twist, including something that the rich 
American cinema ignores to the point of destruction: literacy and 
culture. Not only film references abound, but literary ones nicely 
worked in: Tennessee Williams, Truman Capote, Boris Vian...
"Mother" is theater of emotions, but it is not judgmental. Nor is it 
"classical" in format. It is shot with Almodovarian avant-garde 
techniques, camera angles and tricks, garishly pleasant colors. 
Almodovar plays a game of Chinese boxes, with film-within-film, 
videos, TV, with symbols within the hyper-realistic context. Think of 
how the transplants, in their own remote way also evoke esthetic 
surgery and transsexual operations.
The word "tolerance" is never spoken but the notion is there, all 
over, not as a plea but as a necessity for life.
What is really surprising is the tolerance of today's Spain vis-a-vis 
subjects that once were taboo. After its Civil War, General Francisco 
Franco ruled the country from 1939 to his death in 1975. Censorship 
and self-censorship reigned in that prudish, conservative nation. In 
the last part of Franco's life, a number of movies appeared which 
--like many Polish films--used on-the-face-of-it politically 
innocuous themes, but in reality had camouflaged sub-texts, 
metaphors, symbols which the savvy audiences understood. Then Spain 
exploded after Franco's demise. I still remember kiosks with 
astounding arrays of "girlie" if not porno magazines. Even so, it 
took Almodovar (who is homosexual) to become the most influential 
agent provocateur in cinema, to the extent that today, a major, 
sexually outspoken film like "Mother" (which was awarded Best 
Director at Cannes 99) is accepted without second thoughts in Spain 
but would have trouble in the United States.
