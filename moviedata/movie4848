When I ponder childhood memories past, one of the things that always springs
immediately to mind is watching the "Inspector Gadget" TV show with my older
brother. Truth be told, we were rabid fanatics; our version of Cowboys and
Indians was chasing each other around our coffee table to the theme tune,
alternating who would get to be Gadget and who would be stuck playing the
part of Dr. Claw, the inspector's arch nemesis. I was never a biggie on
nostalgia, but you just can't help but have fond memories of something like
that. Sometimes I even find myself up at 4AM watching re-runs of my favorite
episodes, trying to recapture some of that sense of wonder I felt as a kid.
At the very least, I was expecting the new film version of the classic
television series to have at least some kind of similar effect on me.
Despite how horrid a film may be, the simple task of rekindling even a
slight feeling of nostalgia is pretty tough to screw up. So back I sat, with
minimum expectations of what the movie would deliver (let's face it; exactly
how good can a live-action Disney film really be?).
I was wise enough to steer clear from the likes of Mr. Magoo and George of
the Jungle (two previous Disney adaptations), and I wish to God that I had
been sharp enough to skip Gadget as well. Rarely has a movie left me with
such an utter feeling of emptiness. As everyone else was getting up to exit
the screening room after the movie had completed its assault on mankind, I
was left sitting there, absolutely speechless and totally dumbfounded at
what I had just seen. Can something this awful truly exist in such an
evolved world?
Right from the beginning, I knew I was in trouble. In the opening scenes,
each character is introduced as if their sole purpose is to just be, to
simply serve as real-life duplicates of their cartoon clones. When referring
to them, people almost yell in fear that the audience will not catch on as
to who a certain character is supposed to be ("Oh, hi PENNY! Is BRAIN with
you?"). Creating one-dimensional replicas is one thing; having mere names
take the place of them is quite another.
The "plot", shall we call it, stays fairly in tune with the original series.
Matthew Broderick stars as John Brown (how creative is that?), a security
guard who is horribly injured by a pack of ruthless businessmen headed by
Scolex (why, Rupert Everett, for the love of God why???!!!), who himself is
transformed into Claw by an unfortunate chain of events. Brown is then
rescued and used as a prototype for a new law-enforcement technology wherein
he's joined with various machine parts and some nifty gadgets to form
(drumroll, please)... Inspector Gadget!
>From here on out, the movie becomes a hodgepodge of stupid dialog and
confusing situations (although, to be fair, my confusion could have been
caused by the virtual concussion the film was inflicting upon my fragile
mind). There's something about an evil Gadget taking over the city (his
first crime must have been swiping Matt Dillon's dentures from There's
Something About Mary) and it all ends with (what else?) a bunch of
post-credit nonsense and a cameo by Don Adams himself. To be honest, I
wasn't much paying attention to these "treats". I was just glad that it was
over.

Rating: **1/2 (out of ****)
Walt Disney / 1:20 / 1999 / PG (innuendo, comic violence)
Cast: Matthew Broderick; Rupert Everett; Joely Fisher; Michelle
Trachtenberg; Dabney Coleman; Andy Dick; Michael G. Hagerty; Cheri Oteri
Disney's track record with turning past film and television concepts
into big-screen fare for the multiplex-happy family crowd hasn't been
too successful - "Mr. Magoo," anyone? - so it comes as a slight surprise
that their "Inspector Gadget" makes for a mildly amusing 80-minute
diversion. Whether or not this astonishingly hasty running time was
intentional or a result of post-test screening tampering, it certainly
serves the material: Goofy "Gadget," an overblown adaptation of the
mid-'80s cartoon, finishes before it has a chance to truly grate. This
alone is more than can be said for "George of the Jungle."
Anybody who's seen and loved the original incarnation will carp (and
probably has) that Matthew Broderick seems all wrong for the title role,
a contraption-laden crime-fighter, but the story adjusts to fit the
actor's coolly meek demeanor. In the show, Inspector Gadget was aloof -
if extremely equipped, with utensils, gizmos and doohickeys hidden in
every imaginable appendage - and constantly retrieved from the brink of
disaster by his super-smart niece Penny and dog Brain. Here, the kid
("Harriet the Spy"'s plucky Michelle Trachtenberg) and the canine get
relegated mostly to the background while a less-hapless but just as
well-armed hero takes center stage.
Not much in "Gadget" stays the same, actually. Mega-villain Claw never
allowed his face to be seen on TV, but is played in the movie by Rupert
Everett in a rare display of over-the-top fussing and mugging. He wants
to defeat his adversary with a synthetic creation called RoboGadget
(also Broderick), an Inspector doppleganger with Chiclet teeth and a
flair for destruction. Good idea: Giving the typically straight-laced
Broderick a change-of-pace chance to run wild in this part. Bad idea:
Allowing Broderick's genuine article to seem dull by comparison. Guess
it's true that bad guys have more fun.
A set-up explaining the intrepid Inspector's origins - humble security
guard suffers horrible accident - is executed quickly, all the better to
usher in Stan Winston's nifty special effects and some humdinger action
sequences. But what's up with the studio's inclusion of wisecracking
inanimate objects that children may take to but adults will find
irritating. In February's "My Favorite Martian," a suit named Zoot
failed to steal the show. "Inspector" has the Gadget Mobile, a
jive-talkin' roadster (comic D.L. Hughley does the voice) that comes
complete with its own assortment of uneven self-referential jokes and a
snack bar. Cue intrusive product-placements galore.
Easier to not mind than out-and-out like, "Inspector Gadget" finishes a
spotty endeavor. At least the picture benefits from wall-to-wall
wackiness - the vivid camera work makes bombastic Jerry Bruckheimer
films look subtle by comparison - and a pair of female performances that
further push its lively quotient: "Ellen"'s Joely Fisher as a
scatterbrained (but brainy) scientist and "Saturday Night Live"
scene-stealer Cheri Oteri as a noisy city official. David Kellogg
directs the sound and fury with confident flair. His sole other credit:
1991's Vanilla Ice vehicle "Cool as Ice." "Gadget"'s far better, but
really anything would be.

About fifteen years ago, a cartoon called "Inspector Gadget" premiered
on American television featuring the voice of "Get Smart" star Don
Adams as a bumbling police detective with the unique characteristic of
being robotic.  Inspector Gadget did not have the self confidence of
the Six Million Dollar Man, nor the icy-cool visage of Robocop, but
instead was just an inept human being who happened to be partly
mechanical and loaded with a whole bunch of neat little devices.  Most
of his detective work was actually conducted by his niece, Penny, and
her dog, Brain, both of whom constantly accompanied or followed Gadget
to make sure that he stayed out of too much trouble.  
Today we're given David Kellogg's INSPECTOR GADGET, starring the
ever-youthful Matthew Broderick as the title character.  Gadget starts
out as John Brown, a security guard for a robotics research firm run
by Brenda (Joely Fisher) and her father (Rene Auberjonois).  The firm
is on the verge of completing work on a robotic prosthetic foot which
could be remotely controlled by the brainwaves of a human operator,
when the greedy tycoon Sanford Scolex (Rupert Everett) breaks into the
firm's lab, stealing the foot and killing Brenda's father in the
process.  Brown jumps into his Chevette and pursues Scolex, only to be
blown up by one of Scolex's innovative and fearsome weapons, an
explosive cigar.  As a result of the explosion, however, Brown's
bowling ball, which happened to be in the Chevette, flies into the air
and lands on Scolex's hand.  Scolex gets his hand replaced by a
mechanical claw, and renames himself, well, Claw.  Meanwhile, Brenda
uses all of her robotic wizardry to remake Brown, and Inspector Gadget
is born.  When Claw finds out about this mechanical wonder, however,
he becomes bent upon stealing the new technology to build an army of
Gadgets he can sell off to countries around the world.
INSPECTOR GADGET is a movie intended for kids, and on that level it
works pretty well.  It's got an uncomplicated plot, a lot of slapstick
comedy, and simple jokes.  Children will love it, but their parent
guardians may have a slightly less enjoyable experience.  First of
all, edits made after the trailers went to theaters serve to confuse
the attentive viewer by leaving out explanatory scenes.  For example,
Gadget goes to some kind of mayoral ball, but we have no idea why.  It
also seems that attendees are not surprised in the least that this
mechanical man is dancing in their midst.  Why?  Because the scene
showing that the ball was meant to debut Inspector Gadget was cut
completely.  I assume this missing scene was also where we get to see
why Police Chief Quimby (Dabney Coleman) harbors so much animosity for
his newest member of the force, since it's never explained
satisfactorily anywhere else in the film.  I really have to wonder why
these edits were made in the first place, as the film runs short at
about eighty minutes anyway.
Unlike the animated series, Penny (Michelle Trachtenberg) and Brain
are relegated to what amounts to barely supporting roles.  In fact,
they seem more of an afterthought homage to the original cartoon,
since their inclusion in the film is so superfluous that they could
have been left out altogether.  Too bad, as it would've been hilarious
to see a live action Brain following Gadget around and keeping him
safe.  Of course, they'd have to put that "No animals were harmed...."
disclaimer in big, bold letters at the end of the movie, as Brain was
frequently on the receiving end of exploding parcels and the like
which he intercepted before they reached Gadget.  It would seem that
in not exploring this possibility, the filmmakers passed up a great
opportunity for comedy and development of other characters (even if
one is a dog).
Speaking of the original show, you should know that it had no
connection to Disney whatsoever.  You wouldn't think so, the way the
live-action film version of the lovable cartoon is marketed in all
venues as "Disney's" INSPECTOR GADGET.  But there it is.  To be fair,
the possessive is more than mere credit grabbing.  Actually, the film
has that touch that plagues most of Disney's recent non-cartoon
features - just look at films like THE BIG GREEN, 101 DALMATIANS, or
THAT DARN CAT (with Christina Ricci, not Dean Jones), and you'll see a
certain quality of, oh, we'll call it goofy filmmaking (no reference
to the man-dog-thing intended).  INSPECTOR GADGET is laden with weird
sound effects that come out of nowhere for the sole reason of pushing
a scene over the edge and making it, well, goofy.  For example, a
billboard advertising the internet search engine Yahoo! falls on
someone, and as we see the logo come tumbling over, we hear the sound
effect of someone yelling, "Yahoo!"  Stuff like that occurs throughout
the film, and my reaction was that watching it was like watching an
episode of "Bill Nye, The Science Guy," which relentlessly uses the
same effects technique.  My girlfriend, by the way, very astutely
pointed out that "Bill Nye" is also produced by Disney.  Will someone
please give us a break?  Well, at least the billboard wasn't plugging
the internet's Go Network, which everything associated with Disney is
doing these days.
Shameless product placements also abound throughout the film, most
noticeably in Gadget's gadgetmobile.  Built right into the car's
console are buttons which, while never used, seem to dispense
Coca-Cola, Sprite, Skittles, M&M's, and a couple of other things which
we're supposed to go out any buy once the movie's over.  By the way,
the car also talks.  It's one of those ploys for the kids which adults
will find interminable, since the car doesn't say anything funny at
all, not even when it says, "You have to use your seat belt.  This is
a Disney movie."  It only reminded me of the painfully obvious.
Broderick actually does a pretty decent job filling the shoes of the
cartoon hero, although the screenplay doesn't require a whole lot of
the otherwise talented actor.  Unfortunately, the simplistic script
seems to almost visibly constrain the rest of the movie's players.  I
so much wanted Rupert Everett to have some juicy lines with which he
could take his character over the top.  He chews scenery, but it's
more like a nibble here and there, rather than the voracious feeding
frenzy I was hoping for.  Meanwhile, Joely Fischer's Brenda is
entirely forgettable.  As I write this review, I can't even recall a
line she had in the whole film.  The thing is, I can't fault her
because she displays a great acting range in a sequence where she
plays a dual role, and evidently could have really done a lot more
with Brenda if the script had only allowed it.  In the supporting
cast, Dabney Coleman has literally nothing to do, but is still cast
well as Quimby because he actually looks like the cartoon character.
Andy Dick as one of Claw's scientists and Cheri Oteri as the mayor
basically play the roles they play on television.  As Sykes, Claw's
minion, actor Michael G. Hagerty, supporting player in so many films
and various television episodes, stretches his acting range by
allowing us to see him for once without his mustache.  Wow.
But again, this film is for the kids anyway, and it's a lot of good,
clean fun for them, if not so much for you.  Just remember that:  It's
not for you.   In other words, don't go into the theater expecting a
reward for your years of watching the cartoon.  That will only
engender the kind of animosity you now have for George Lucas in making
STAR WARS EPISODE ONE:  THE PHANTOM MENACE.  And that's not very
productive, now is it?

Do the folks at Disney have no common decency? They have resurrected yet
another cartoon and turned it into a live action hodgepodge of expensive
special effects, embarrassing writing and kid-friendly slapstick. Wasn't
Mr. Magoo enough, people?
Obviously not. Inspector Gadget is not what I would call ideal family
entertainment. Younger viewers will likely be taken in by the abounding
goofiness, but their adult companions may feel a wave of nausea sweeping
over them as they attempt to endure this appalling 80-minute exercise in
glaring stupidity. The movie is poorly edited, grossly manipulative, and
the finished product resembles somewhat of a failed jigsaw puzzle. All
the elements are there, but the manner in which director David Kellogg
pieces them together is laughable and trite.
As a huge fan of the 80's animated TV show, the first thing I must
express is my anger toward the treatment of the main villain. In the
cartoon, Dr. Claw was a frightening, raspy-voiced presence who remained
a total mystery to the viewer. We never saw his face; he simply sat back
in his arm-chair, watching surveillance cameras and gently stroking his
loyal cat. As a child, I always imagined what Dr. Claw would appear as -
and this curiosity kept me watching for many years. With the release of
the live-action movie, the face of this once intriguing villain has been
unrightfully exposed - it's... Rupert Everett?! Only now, Dr. Claw is
simply known as Claw (`One word,' he explains, `like Madonna'). He
sports a shiny clamp instead of the steel glove, and seems far less
interesting than the animated version. It helps that the dashing Everett
is enthusiastic, but he overplays the role entirely too far. When all is
said and done, this wasn't a very wise move on the part of the
screenwriters - the infamous Dr. Claw has been turned into a
wisecracking game show host who makes cheap attempts at being suave and
cool. He does still have his cat, though.
In the title role, Matthew Broderick looks lost. The actor, while
usually downright charming, doesn't know exactly where to take his
character - a fault that again can be blamed on the hapless writers.
Broderick first plays a friendly, naive security guard named John Brown,
who dreams of becoming a cop and upholding the law for the good of the
people. He has a mad crush on pretty scientist Brenda (Joely Fisher),
who has stumbled upon a new wave of technology involving the interaction
of human tissue and electronics. But one fateful night, her lab is
destroyed and her experiment is stolen by a fiendish millionaire
(Everett) who wants to take over the world. John courageously pursues
the limousine from the scene of the crime, but loses the chase when his
vehicle bursts into flames. In a full body cast, he is chosen to be the
first human prototype for Brenda's work; a revolutionary crime fighting
tool with numerous fancy gadgets to dispatch bad guys. And so is born
Inspector Gadget.
As bad as this movie is, it does have a certain charm in isolated
scenes. Broderick actually fares better playing Robo Gadget, an evil and
destructive clone that Claw has set loose on the city. And there are
about two or three amusing punch lines, the funniest being when Robo
Gadget impersonates a rampaging monster with shadow puppets on a brick
wall, and a Japanese man flees the scene while screaming, `This is why I
left Tokyo!' Alas, the hit ratio of the ongoing gags is about 20 to 1 in
favor of not even cracking a slight giggle. There are so many tired plot
additions. Gadget's talking car (voiced by D.L. Hughley) is the same
type of character as Zoot the suit from My Favorite Martian. Both are
wisecracking, non-human additions designed to coax laughter from smaller
children. Well, it just doesn't work (in fact, Zoot functioned
marvelously in comparison to this). And don't even get me started about
the villains. I didn't mind Everett's performance, but his bumbling
assistants will make every adult cringe with disgust.
The characters from the cartoon have been reduced to thankless
supporting roles. Penny (Michelle Trachtenberg) and Brain the dog now
have little to do with the action, and Chief Quimby (Dabney Coleman) has
lost considerable appeal in the transition of animation to live action.
The special effects are everywhere, but not so annoying they will cause
your eyes to peel over. The problem here lies solely in the script.
Perhaps the next time Disney attempts a remake like this, they will
invest more in the screenplay than the fancy-schmancy visuals. Here is
one critic crossing his fingers, anyway.

Cranky CriticŽ movie Reviews: Inspector Gadget
Rated [PG], 87 minutes
Starring Matthew Broderick, Rupert Everett, Joely Fisher
Story by Dana Olsen and Kerry Ehrin
Screenplay by Kerry Ehrin and Zak Penn
Directed by David Kellogg
website:http://disney.go.com/DisneyPictures/gadget/
Matthew Broderick and Cranky agree on at least one thing; we're both too
old to have known Inspector Gadget from his teevee toon incarnation.
Cranky doesn't compare to Source Material and Matthew discusses his
angle over in StarTalk">http://www.crankycritic.com/qa/matthewbroderick.htm">StarTalk
(we were discussing a different movie, but Cranky thinks ahead).
>From an adult point-of-view, Inspector Gadget is a blend of Robocop and
Get Smart (whose star, Don Adams, voiced the cartoon Gadget and
contributes a voice cameo to this flick). For kidlets, Inspector Gadget
is the ultimate in cool. With 14-foot long telescoping legs, helicopter
blades that pop out of his head, high tech spy gadgets built into every
fingertip (not to mention a toothbrush and toothpaste dispenser --
cleanliness is next to Gadget-ness, you know) he's every fantastic
single digit kidlet fantasy come to life.
Or as my 6-year old nephew puts it: "Gadget is so totally awesome."
Since the neph wasn't available to sneak peak Inspector Gadget with the
best uncle in the world, me, Cranky sat himself down amidst a bunch of
parents who had brought their kidlets. We watched security guard John
Brown (Matthew Broderick) get transformed into uber-cop Gadget to track
down the evil villain Sanford Scolex, aka Claw (Rupert Everett), killer
of kindly inventor Artemus Bradford (Rene Auberjonois), father of the
girl John has his heart set on Brenda Bradford (Joely Fisher). We
thrilled to the utter intelligence of John Brown's niece Penny (Michele
Trachtenberg) 'cuz, as sweet as her uncle is, Gadget is a bit of a dim
bulb.
Good thing Gadget has a spare bulb in his hat, which pops up and flashes
bright yellow when he has an idea. With a surplus of cartoon imagery, us
old folks (those with attention spans that last longer than 40 seconds
or so) will be totally lost inside of the world of Gadget. Inside that
world is a fast talking super-car, the Gadgetmobile (voiced by D. L.
Hughley) built for comfort. The car not only has it's own bunch of super
gadgets, it has built in Skittles, Coca-Cola and Big Mac dispensers.
[Think about it for a second; with VCR systems now being built into
mini-vans, how long is it going to be before mini-microwaves and
refrigerators join the party?]
There's a pair of below the belt jokes that are aimed strictly at adults
-- kids'll laugh at the slapstick without feeling our pain -- and enough
references to old flicks (Mission Impossible, Mary Poppins, Godzilla to
keep our attention from flagging, but Gadget ain't for us. But we knew
that walking in. I'll let the film students complain about visual and
continuity errors, of which there are many, or a story that barely holds
together. Cranky writes for the grownups, all of whom will want to know
if Inspector Gadget is fit for their kids. Yep. No doubt about it.
So, don't be complaining about the rating, 'cuz that's for the adults,
all of whom will take the kidlets to the theater, then rent this flick
until they give in and buy it.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Inspector Gadget, he would have
paid...
Rental level for reasons previously stated. Every kidlet I talked with
or eavesdropped on, most in the 6 - 9 year old range, were thrilled by
Inspector Gadget, and wanted to see it again.

INSPECTOR GADGET (PG).  
(Walt Disney Pictures/Buena Vista International)
Director: David Kellogg
Stars: Matthew Broderick, Rupert Everett, Joely Fisher, Michelle 
Trachtenberg, Dabney Coleman, Rene Auberjonois, Michael G Hagerty,
voice of Don Adams.
This pedestrian and largely unfunny adaptation of the popular
children's cartoon series joins those other woefully miscast,
misguided live action adaptations of animated series (The Flintstones,
Mr Magoo) in the cinematic wasteland.
A strangely uncharismatic Matthew Broderick (remember his
glory days as Ferris Bueller?)  steps into the shoes of the robotic
sleuth with more gadgets than a hardware store, but he is clearly out
of his depth.  Broderick plays John Brown, a security guard who dreams
of becoming a police officer in Riverton.  His wish comes true in a
most unexpected way after he is severely injured while attempting to
stop a break in at the laboratory where he works.  Brown becomes the
guinea pig in a revolutionary experiment conducted by the beautiful
scientist Brenda Bradford (Joely Fisher) aimed at creating a robotic
cop.  He ends up looking like a cross between the Six Million Dollar
Man and Robocop, without the inventive genius of either!
Gadget's first case involves trying to solve the murder of
Brenda's father, which brings him up against the villainous
industrialist Claw (Rupert Everett, in a complete contrast to his
recent role in An Ideal Husband, etc), who creates an evil version of
Inspector Gadget and sets about creating havoc in the city.  The less
than cluey Inspector Gadget gets plenty of help from his inquisitive
and intelligent niece Penny (Michelle Trachtenberg, from Harriet The
Spy) and her dog Brains.
David Kellogg's direction is ham fisted and unsubtle, and the
film has plenty of flat moments, especially for older audiences or
those who fondly remember the '80's cartoon with some affection.  The
special effects are occasionally quite good, but more often than not
they are distinctly second rate and unconvincing.
The performances are suitably camp and unconvincing.  Everett
hams it up nicely as the arch villain of the piece, and almost steals
the movie.  Some of the film's best lines belong to the gadgetmobile,
the wise cracking, talking car with attitude, whose antics will
probably delight younger audiences.  Don Adams, who provided the voice
of Gadget in the original series, gets a brief cameo here providing
the voice of Brains, the dog, in some nonsense during the final
credits.
Admittedly, Inspector Gadget is comic book stuff, but still
some effort should have been made to accommodate those audiences older
than eight years old who will inevitably be dragged into the cinemas.
The biggest problem lies with the uneven script, which can't seem to
make up its mind whether it should be over the top comic book fantasy
or not.  There are a few clever in-jokes throughout the film (such as
the Godzilla send up) that provide a few chuckles.  Unfortunately, the
best and most inspired moments come too late, during the final
credits.
Sadly this disappointing film is a case of no go gadget!

     I'll admit to watching the early 1980's `Inspector Gadget' cartoon,
and probably far too late in life.
     Looks like now I'm waaaaay too old for this kind of thing, but
judging by the mute stares of the many children in our advance screening
audience, maybe they are too.
     INSPECTOR GADGET  the live-action version starring Matthew
Broderick in a thankless slapstick role  tries so hard to be funny,
aiming alternately at kids and their parents, that it misses on all
counts.  In one scene, Gadget will grab some guy's crotch until he
squeals.  In the next, the evil Dr. Claw (Everett) will pontificate on
how his moniker is `One word, like Madonna.'  Do kids get the subtlety
of the joke, considering Everett is openly gay?  Do adults think it's
funny?
     Nix on both counts, and the super-streamlined plot line (John Brown
is injured and becomes superhuman crime-fighting machine) is stolen
completely from ROBOCOP.  How's that for your average kiddie movie?
     Two funny items of note earn GADGET its half-star.  First is the
Minion Recovery Group scene, which appears during the closing credits.
Second is actually up front, when a `Yahoo!' billboard crushes Claw's
limo.  Considering that Disney's Go network is now an arch-rival of
Yahoo!, the free advertising for the competition (which likely wasn't an
issue during the movie's original production) seems particularly ironic.

Perhaps you might be familiar with a campy 60s TV show called Get
Smart, which featured a bumbling agent that always thwarted the forces
of evil even though he couldn't find a clue if it came up and hit him
in the face.  You might also be familiar with an equally campy 70s TV
show called the Six Million Dollar Man, which featured a man barely
alive who was rebuilt to be fasterstrongerbetter.   And of course
we're all familiar with the people at Disney, who possess a talent to
bring us good family fare full of wacky creativity.  Blend these three
elements together and you get 80 minutes of grins in Disney's
`Inspector Gadget.'
Inspector Gadget is actually John Brown (Matthew Broderick), a
mild-mannered security guard that almost loses his life during a
robbery.  In the accident, his body has suffered irreparable damage. 
But thanks to some groundbreaking work by scientist Brenda (Joely
Fisher), John can benefit from a new procedure that blends flesh with
technology.  On the operating table as they try to save his life, they
wheel in the entire inventory of the local Home Depot, from springs to
pipes to hoses.  When John wakes up, he learns that he is now the new
generation of law enforcement.  All he has to say is go go gadget'
something, and voila  it pops out.  This man is the ultimate Swiss
pocketknife.  His thumb is a lighter, his ear is a sound amplifier, and
his legs turn into huge metal stilts that allow him to leapfrog through
traffic at an amazing speed.  When he wants to scale a building, go go
gadget grappling hook.'  And when he needs to get somewhere across
town, 'go go gadget copter.'  I found these scenes inventive and cute,
although kids would probably appreciate the gee-whiz gadgetry more than
I did.
The acerbic police chief Quimby (Dabney Coleman) is not thrilled with
having an experimental cybercop, quipping that Inspector Gadget is
Columbo and Nintendo all rolled into one.  But this new inspector
catches the eye of the magnate, Mr. Scolex/Dr. Claw (Rupert Everett). 
He wants to steal the technology to build his own legion of warriors. 
Scolex is the kind of cartoonish bad guy that says mean things
accompanied by mean-sounding music in the background.  After all, this
is Disney.  
This live-action film was inspired from the cartoon of the same name
from the 80's.  I was mildly interested in the cartoon and probably
came away with a similarly lukewarm feeling after I saw the movie. 
There isn't much bite to this movie, although the movie has its tender
moments.  Nonetheless, I did enjoy Broderick's appropriately frumpy
performance and I thought that the movie paced itself very well to keep
me from slipping into a mode of boredom.  I also liked the
Gadgetmobile, which is a convertible that puts the Knight Rider
(another 80s show) car to shame.  Among the many cool things that this
car can do, perhaps the coolest is the built-in soda and candy
dispenser for the weary passenger in need of a snack.  But the funniest
scene happens during the end credits.  One of Scolex's evil henchman
wants to mend his ways and attends a meeting of the Minion Support
Group.  In this group, you'll find Oddjob and Jaws from a few James
Bond flicks and a few other memorable, evil sidekicks.

A thumb that turns into a cigarette lighter. That's about as funny as
INSPECTOR GADGET ever gets. Disney's new live-action movie pins all of
its hopes for laughter on such sight gags.
As the gadget-laden hero, Inspector Gadget, poor Matthew Broderick is
stuck yet again in a movie in which he delivers an awkward performance
in an underwritten role. Broderick invests little emotional energy in
the part of a guy whose reconstructed body is a collection of gadgets
and gizmos.
The writing credits go to a committee of four (Dana Olsen, Kerry Ehrin,
Zak Penn and Audrey Wells). The quality of a script is usually inversely
proportional to the number of writers, and this screenplay is no
exception. The dialog packs no punch whatsoever, leaving the physical
comedy alone to carry the picture.
The one-joke movie consists of having Inspector Gadget, a kid's version
of RoboCop, demonstrating all of his hardware. The comedy comes from the
way the mechanisms frequently go awry, causing such "hilarious" mistakes
as various parts of his body crashing through ceilings and walls. The
result is a movie with a laugh count of maybe one or two small chuckles.
As written, was the project doomed? Perhaps not. Consider, for a minute,
what it might have become with Brendan Fraser. He throws himself heart
and soul into his every part. Willing to risk looking completely
ridiculous, Fraser usually dazzles us with his comedic bravado.
Broderick, on the other hand, never convinces us he even wants to be on
the set.
Still, even the usually reliable Rupert Everett, who plays the movie's
villain, Claw, doesn't show much spark in his acting.
There is one undeniably enjoyable part of the production. It doesn't
last long.
INSPECTOR GADGET runs 1:20. It is rated PG for wacky violence/action,
language and innuendo and would be fine for kids of all ages.
My son Jeffrey, age 10, gave the movie ** 1/2, complaining that it
didn't have enough action, comedy or mystery. His buddy Nickolas, age
10, gave the film ***. He thought the movie needed more action, but he
really liked the talking car in it.

The question abounds: Why is it that every single year Walt Disney Pictures 
will release a big summer animated movie that is usually of high quality, 
both enjoyable and smart enough for kids and adults alike, and yet they 
constantly are willing to churn out live-action films that are about as fun 
as having a route canal done...without being put to sleep or given any form 
of medication. I just don't understand it. "That Darn Cat," "My Favorite 
Martian," "Meet the Deedles," "Flubber," "101 Dalmatians," and "Inspector 
Gadget," which is the worst of the lot, by the way. Did anyone who made these 
films, the director, the cast, the producers, the studio, for once actually 
believe that they were making a worthwhile film for families that was both 
intelligent and entertaining, heartfelt and truthful, funny and clever? If 
they ever did believe such a story, they were either brainwashed, fooling 
themselves, or under the heavy influence of LSD. There is, simply put, no 
excuse at all for Disney, or any other high-profile studio for that matter, 
to be unleashing such vile garbage unto the world that does not have one 
redeeming element to be found anywhere. I've got news for you, Disney: these 
live-action movies you are making are not enjoyable for the entire family; 
they are demeaning and show that you have no respect for any sort of thinking 
human audience at all. Check out such non-Disney family film winners, such as 
"The Wizard of Oz," "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory," "A Christmas 
Story," and "Prancer." Maybe studying these wonderful entertainments that do 
not talk down to children or grown-ups will knock some sense into you.
Based on the early-'80s animated series, "Inspector Crap-on-it," oh, I mean 
"Gadget," the movie follows John Brown (Matthew Broderick, whose career has 
been shot to hell once again after appearing in the brilliant satire, 
"Election"), a single security guard who cares for his young, precocious 
niece, Penny (Michelle Trachtenberg), and longs for beautiful scientist 
Brenda (Joely Fisher). When the villainous Sanford Scolex (Rupert Everett) 
breaks into Brenda's lab, killing her father (Rene Auberjonois) and stealing 
their research projects, John comes to the rescue, but in the process is 
blown up in his car, and Sanford himself accidentally gets his hand severed. 
In appreciation, Brenda decides to save John's life by putting to use her 
latest invention, and before long John Brown is Inspector Gadget, a 
part-human/part-mechanical creation that has the ability to do almost 
anything, with some sort of gadget or weapon planted into each of his body 
parts. Meanwhile, Sanford has constructed a claw-like device to be put on his 
hand and changes his name to Claw, "one word...like Madonna." Hardee-har-har! 
Anyway, Claw invents a robotic replica of Inspector Gadget who is set out to 
destroy everything in its path, including John.
You know, I could have been generous and given "Inspector Gadget" a 
marginally kinder 1/2-star rating, but the more I thought about it, the more 
I realized there was not one scene, element, or even frame that I could 
honestly say I liked while looking someone straight in the eyes. The story is 
brief (thank the Lord!), but makes no actual sense, with little clouds coming 
up from Inspector Gadget's head now and then to show him using one of his 
many gadgets to good use. But how does this actually fit into the plot at 
hand? Better yet, how did the haphazard screenplay, by the clearly-talentless 
duo of Kerry Ehrin and Zak Penn, get past the written page? And even better 
yet, why would Disney spend millions and millions of dollars on this 
instantly forgettable, ineffective piece of junk when they could instead be 
making generous donations to help out the sick, disabled, and needy?
The movie may think it's funny, but I've got news for it: I lightly, and 
quickly, laughed once during the interminable 77-minute running time, and 
that was only thanks to Saturday Night Live talent Cheri Oteri (who is 
otherwise criminally wasted as the town's goofy mayor). The rest of the movie 
has scene after mindless scene pounding the audience with almost non-stop 
action, effects, chaos, and cheap humor. Did you see character development or 
simple charm on that list? I didn't think so.
"Inspector Gadget" is unredeemably bad, and shockingly so. I wasn't expecting 
a masterpiece going into the theater, but the film also sunk well below the 
lowest expectation that could have possibly occurred in my mind. Every actor 
should not only be embarrassed to have appeared in this film, but they should 
change their names in private and hide out for a couple years until everyone 
has forgotten about this worthless piece of shameful celluloid. I'm not going 
to mention any actors, but you can take a gander at my cast listing up above 
to decide for yourself what could have possibly gone wrong. "Inspector 
Gadget" is one of the few movies I've seen in which every cast and crew 
member involved should have billed themselves as Alan Smithee. Maybe Disney 
should even change their name after this debacle, but not to "Alan Smithee." 
They should change it to "sell-out."

"Inspector Gadget," directed by David Kellogg, is another live-action 
version of a Saturday morning cartoon, and indeed the places in which it is 
most successful are those that show cartoonish silliness.
Matthew Broderick plays the rather dull-witted police inspector dedicated to 
justice. His character, John Brown, is at first an ambitious security guard 
at a medical clinic. The clinic is run by Dr. Brenda Bradford (Joely 
Fisher), who has just about perfected a high-tech program in robotics. When 
an arch-criminal - Sanford Scolex, played by Rupert Everett -- kills 
Bradford's father and makes off with essential components of the "Gadget" 
program, the main plot devices are set in motion. Scolex lobs a dynamite 
cigar and blows Brown up, and himself loses a hand. Hence the nickname 
"Claw."
In an oblique nod to "Robocop," the damaged semi-officer is robotized, his 
head his only human part. Meanwhile, the slimy Claw has recruited Dr. 
Brenda Bradford, offering her unlimited funding and control. His plans are 
sinister, of course: he wishes to build robotic warriors to create 
invincible armies for the highest bidders. The rest of the story follows 
Claw's evil wanderings, including his manufacturing an evil twin for 
Inspector Gadget.
This double is the highlight of Broderick's performance. Rather ordinary in 
his title role, Broderick sets off the twin with a wise-cracking, 
teeth-clicking twist of attitude. It's unclear exactly why Claw has made 
the twin, except to clone the convention of smearing the good guy. Further, 
not enough is made of the wondrous Gadget, so his character seems 
underdeveloped in the public's eye; the real Gadget does not seem to suffer 
from the public's scorn. Clearly, the writers didn't think of everything.
On the other hand, Rupert Everett saves his character with exaggeration - 
laughs and scowls reminiscent of the best mad scientists. In this 
telescoped plot - the whole film under 80 minutes! - Claw's motivations are 
muddy, his background almost completely absent. But Everett makes his bad 
guy actually likable, a feat only good cartoons accomplish.
Joely Fisher as Brenda Bradford is passable. Too much emphasis is placed on 
her beauty, not enough on her intelligence. And I got the feeling that she 
found it difficult to make us believe a human could fall in love with her 
Frankenstein, although it is a fascinating possibility.
The self-relexive humor goes a long way toward making "Inspector Gadget" 
watchable. When the Gadgetmobile (a souped-up white Lincoln convertible 
voiced by D.L. Hughley) quips that this is "a Disney movie," we get a taste 
of wit that appears too sparsely in so many other parts. Mini-parodies of 
movies like last summer's flop "Godzilla" also kick the quality up to 
average.
What pulls it so far down, though? For one, editing done in a chop-shop. 
Many moments that we have seen in trailers for months either do not appear 
at all in the film, or surface at points that are at times awkward or even 
incoherent. I should add that a couple of thought-balloon sequences do 
succeed in offering tiny, cartoon-y flashbacks. But much of the exposition 
we need to comprehend the storyline is lost to the editor's hatchet. 
Another aspect that falls flat is the role of Gadget's niece Penny (Michelle 
Trachtenberg). The actress does a fine job; it's just that she is used for 
ridiculous purposes. Her pooch, the beagle Brain, has simply too little 
screen time to matter much.
Visual effects do a nice job in emulating the outrageous gadgets that spring 
out of the inspector's body. His arms and legs extend for yards, weapons 
shooting out of every portal, even his hat. There's a particularly neat 
scene in which a boy on the street asks for an autograph from the evil 
Gadget, and all kinds of evil-looking weapons pop out of the copy's arms, 
scaring the boy. Unfortunately, we were overexposed to this scene in the 
trailers.
To get a little more of your money's worth if you see this film in a 
theater, stay for the closing credits. Some of the best segments of your 
viewing will include Brain talking in the sharp voice of Don Adams (Gadget's 
voice in the creative cartoon), as well as one of Claw's henchmen in a 
Minion Support Group, characters like Richard Kiel's "Jaws" and an Odd-Job 
impersonator sitting among the listeners.
But I'd advise to skip paying today's big bucks for first-run admission in 
favor of second-run or video rental. That way there's no chance for the 
regret I experienced in paying for a movie I had heard was bad.

Some movies I should just skip.  My daughter and I had a really vile
time at My Favorite Martian a few weeks back, and here comes another
Disney effects-filled live-action flick based on an old TV program.
True, the probgram is only 15 years old this time, and it's a cartoon.
But it's a cartoon I liked, and I was understandably reluctant to see
what Disney had done to it on the big screen.  But my daughter really
wanted to go, and how bad could it be?
Turns out I was right, mostly.  Inspector Gadget, oddly enough,
follows almost exactly the same format as My Favorite Martian, down to
the jive-talking side-kick.  At first I thought it was done by the
same people, but IMDB informs me that IG was directed by David Kellogg
and written by Dana Olsen and Kerry Ehrin, where MFM was directed by
Donald Petrie and written by Sherri Stoner and Deanna Oliver.
This odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by
the studio that produced it, where "formula" isn't just business, it's
a way of life.  The producers who obviously micromanaged the two
projects should get prominant screen credits.  In some parts you can
just hear them saying "more zany!  I want more zany here -- and --
here."  "Let's have a really painful sexual reference for no reason
right here -- make it really painful.  I want the audience squirming
in their seats."  "Ok, that's fine, but I want you to add bug guts."
"What does this scene do?  Character depth?  But where's the zaniness?
I DON'T see ZANY here.  If you can't make it zany, cut it!"
The latter is the only explanation I can come up with for the absence
of the thoroughly charming Michelle Trachtenberg for most of the
movie.  Michelle (who plays Penny, Gadget's niece)  shines in every
scene she's in, but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of
screen time.  My guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor.
Dabney Coleman's comedic talents are utterly wasted as Chief Quimby.
I kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow
save the film, but instead, he does the best he can with some really
poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes.  He is thoroughly upstaged
by Cheri Oteri as the "gidget bitch from hell" town Mayor.  Oteri's
overly enthusiastic and continually self-congratulatory speech
patterns and mannerisms were so much like Portland, Oregon's own manic
mayor Vera Katz that I had to wonder if the studio wasn't poking fun
at our fair town.  Or, maybe all career politicians are like that.
I must say, Matthew Broderick does not stroll through Inspector Gadget
as he did Godzilla.  He appears to have some fun with the film,
especially as the evil Gadget.  Rupert Everett is entertaining as the
maniacle Claw.
Joely Fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the
zany carbon copy of herself.  Her performance is one of the few things
worth watching in the film.
D.L. Hughley plays the shuckin'-and-jivin' vehicular side-kick, in a
role that firmly sets Emancipation back 20 years.
The dialog is... let's face it, it's pretty bad.  The tag-line after a
major set-piece battle is a faux pas that makes no sense in context.
A lot of the lines (especially Hughley's) appear to be made up as they
go along, by people with little gift for ad-lib.
About three-quarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin
story for both Gadget and Claw.  Gadget then spends the latter third
of the movie trying to locate Claw and having various altercations
(not really "battles") with the evil Gadget.  Penny does about a
minute and a half of the detective work her character did every week
in the cartoon.
Let me rage here just for a minute.  Michelle Trachtenberg was an
excellent choice for the Penny character.  She's utterly charming, and
has excellent experience (Harriet the Spy) for the part of the
pint-size detective.  Why she is so underutilized in this film is a
real mystery.  The film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled
with scripting (or editing) stupidity.
Inspector Gadget is missing the long, long stretches of potty humor
that (among other things) made My Favorite Martian so unbearable, but
it's a very short movie, so perhaps something was cut at the last
moment.
Probably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits.
The "evil sidekick support group" is especially worth seeing, and has
an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds it's
onscreen.
All in all, another bad live action film from the premere studio for
bad live action films.  I wonder if Disney uses the revenues for it's
generally money-making cartoons to produce these losers.  But if true,
why?  If they're trying for another Mary Poppins, they need to find a
team that can produce one, and then give them a chance to do it.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Disney's live-action big-screen version of the popular animated
television series, while likely be entertaining for kids, will be a bore
for those who have reached a double-digit age.  Giving the lead role to
Matthew Broderick could be part of the problem  Gadget should be
bumbling and cocky, not bumbling and bland.
Broderick (Godzilla) stars as John Brown, a security guard for a
scientific research facility and a wannabe cop.  He is also in love with
Brenda (Joely Fisher, TV's Ellen), the daughter of a scientist that is
on the brink of creating robot police officers.  When a late-night
break-in attempt leaves her dad dead and John clinging to life, Brenda
decides to have doctors remove John's innards and replace them with the
lifework of her father.  The result?  John Brown becomes Inspector
Gadget, a high-tech officer for the Riverton Police Department.  Gadget
can implement any of his new features by shouting `Go Go Gadget,'
followed by whatever it is he wants to use  like spring legs or
helicopter hat.  But, like the series, he usually gets it wrong,
hilarity ensues, yet he still manages to get the bad guy.
Speaking of bad guys, Gadget's nemesis Claw is hammily played by Rupert
Everett (An Ideal Husband).  The world's youngest (and formerly the
fattest) billionaire, he has both an evil cackle and a net worth counter
on the front of his desk.  He's the one responsible for the break-in and
was left with a crushed right hand, which is eventually replaced with
the claw from which he derives his moniker.  Claw's headquarters are
located within the same Pittsburgh building that was supposed to have
been used to house Brainiac in the stalled production of Superman.
Like the TV series, Gadget has a dog named Brain and a niece named Penny
(Michelle Trachtenberg, Harriet the Spy), both of which appear smarter
than him.  Like the TV series, Gadget also has a talking car, voiced
here by D.L. Hughley (The Hughleys), who breathes some much-needed
energy into the film.  And like the TV series, Gadget always gets his
man and delivers him to Police Chief Quimby (Dabney Coleman, You've Got
Mail).  Other characters include a wasted (probably literally) Andy Dick
(NewsRadio) as one of Claw's scientists and an annoying Cheri Oteri
(Saturday Night Live) as Riverton's Mayor.
Perhaps even odder than the casting of Broderick is Disney's selection
of director David Kellogg, whose only previous effort was Playboy's
Playmates at Play video release.  This could explain the scene where
Gadget hoses down a cleavage-bearing Fisher with a giant load of blue
toothpaste.  Also, be on the lookout for several bothersome product
placement scenes.  (1:36 - PG for wacky violence/action, language and
innuendo)

Starring Matthew Broderick, Rupert Everett, Joely Fisher, Michelle
Trachtenberg, Andy Dick, Cheri Oteri. Rated PG.
The "Disney Stick-to-What-You-Do-Best" rule states that Disney's
animated features will invariably be sublime but whenever they try their
hand at live-action kids' entertainment, they will fail miserably. This
goes double for occasions when they try to make a live-action adaptation
of a popular cartoon (Remember the 1996 version of 101 Dalmations? I'm
still trying to forget).
That rule proves more dependable than ever with Inspector Gadget, an
insulting, despicable and, worst of all, expensive piece of trash trying
to pass itself off as a viable children's film. It will bore anyone over
five and should prove unbearable for adults, even at its relatively
skinny running time of 80 minutes. It's films like this that make me
want to go to my local Blockbuster and rent something from the days when
brains were more important than budgets and wit compensated for lack of
fancy effects.
Just as Matthew Broderick began to convince me that there is hope for
him as an actor yet, his career takes a nosedive to hell with his "role"
as John Brown, a depressed security guard with a big heart who hopes
that one day he can become a real policemen and help the people around
him. He dreams of heroic deeds and the subsequent admiration of his long
time crush, Dr. Brenda Bradford (Joely Fisher). But after a few bizarre
coincidences it seems that he has to dream no longer.
John breaks every bone in his body while trying to save Dr. Brenda's
father. Dr. Brenda has been working on a "Gadget Project," which would
make a half-man half-machine super-policeman to fight crime. Feeling
indebted to John she decides to save his life by making him the subject,
realizing his dream of becoming a policeman. Now, when he says "Go Go
Gadget [insert name of gizmo here]" he can use all kinds of nifty
gadgets to capture crooks, bang up bandits and mangle murderers.
In the meantime, the evil Claw (Rupert Everett), the man responsible for
the murder of the good doctor's father is building a gadget of his own:
a carbon copy of our Inspector Gadget except evil and John Brown's worst
nemesis. Claw has plans of world domination, which leaves it up to the
Inspector and his Gadget Mobile (voice of D.L. Hughley) to save humanity
from his wrath.
State of the art effects fly at a mad pace in this $90 million dollar
movie and yet director David Kelogg never sets up a convincing
atmosphere. Had they replaced all the fancy gizmos with dollar bills
they would have wound up with the same effect. What we see on the screen
is like the raw ingredients of a meal: all of the expensive f/x amounts
to nothing.
Part of the charm of the tv series was its sly irreverence which has
gone down the toilet in the condescending movie. Can kids really admire
a hero so goody-two-shoes that he screams "Hey! You ran a stop sign!"
while hanging off the back bumper of a quickly moving vehicle? I think
that today's children will respond better to somebody dashing, someone
ultra-cool. They (probably) receive enough preaching from their parents
and its an insult to their intelligence to assume that they want to go
to an action movie to see a father figure kick butt.
In addition to the more complex complaints above, there's also the
simple stuff: Inspector Gadget is boring, formulaic and achingly
implausible. There's no feeling that the director really cares about his
story: more than any other film I've seen this year, this one really
feels like it was made on an assembly line. There's a popular commercial
(for Sprite, but that's irrelevant) running in movie theaters before
features that spoofs the way major studios deal with projects. It
consists of studio suits discussing a fictitious (thank God) movie
called "Death Slug". Each executive gleefully presents a different
merchandise tie-in (Slug Taco! Slug on a stick!). At the end one of them
asks "What about the movie?" Another answers: "Well, we don't have a
script yet, but we can bang one out by Friday." They probably could have
replaced "Death Slug" with Inspector Gadget. This film contains the sort
of logical contradictions and blatantly obvious adherence to formula
that could have been eliminated had any attention been payed to the
script.
It's no coincidence that most good children's entertainment these days
comes from animation. Animated features take so long to maker that it
becomes a labor of love for the filmmakers and they put care and pride
into their work. These kinds of films are banged out quicker and a good
percentage turn out worthless, sloppy and impersonal. The studios are
becoming factories and films their assembled products.

Inspector Gadget is another one of my favorite cartoons. Rugrats and Doug have
been made into movies, why not this classic series? However, Disney decides to
take the production another way. This Inspector Gadget is a live action super
crime fighting machine. He's always in control, he's not stupid, and the whole
Mission Impossible bit from the TV show is completely lost.
Broderick is a security guard one night when Brenda (Joely Fisher) and her
father have been working on creating a fully robotic anamatronic crime fighting
machine, Claw (Rupert Everett) breaks in to steal their prototype foot and they
break into a chase. Broderick is sent to intensive care, but not before hitting
Claw's hand with a bowling ball.
Claw then proceeds, (with the help of mad scientist Andy Dick) to create a
clone of Gadget.  He's decked out with guns and other killing machines, his
mission is to destroy the original Gadget. Claw's idea is to make everyone in
the world pay for his killing machines so he can become rich. Add a couple of
bad spoofs and you've got another bad Disney movie.
Plus, this movie loses all sight of the original cartoon. It throws in a
miscast Michelle Trachtenberg as Penny, D.L. Hughley as a talking car, and
Dabney Coleman as the chief of police. There however is enough content here to
make this movie watchable, the gadgets are pretty cool, and some of the humor
is funny, (the was extremely surprised to find no fart and poop jokes) this is
mostly credited to Cheri Oteri who plays the town's glamorous, if not
dim-witted major.
So why would I give this movie ** stars you ask? Stay for the credits! There
are two scenes, one in particular (where we get to hear Brain talk) that make
up (at least for me) almost the entire movie. If your kids drag you to it, it
won't be that painful, but I still give it ** stars.

When will Hollywood learn that successful animated concepts just don't
cut it when translated to flesh-and blood life?  That is most certainly
the case with _Dudley_Do-Right_--or, should I say, _Deadly_Do-Wrong_. 
After the inexplicable box office success of the horrible
_George_of_the_Jungle_, it must've seemed like a good idea to have
_George_ star Brendan Fraser tackle another Jay Ward cartoon character,
the bumbling Canadian mountie and sworn enemy of the dastardly Snidley
Whiplash (Alfred Molina).  But if there's any justice in the world, the
fluke financial success of _George_ will not be duplicated, for this
excrutiatingly unfunny test of patience is even worse than that awful
film.  Writer-director Hugh Wilson's (who last teamed with Fraser earlier
this year in _Blast_from_the_Past_) idea of comedy is having Dudley wear
a moose head and get repeatedly hit by his cabin's loose floorboards.  If
you're with Wilson and are sent rolling on the floor by those gags, by
all means, go to the film.  Everyone else would be wise to just watch the
new _Fractured_Fairy_Tale_ animated short that precedes the film... when
the film hits video.
The other live-action cartoon adaptation of the summer,
_Inspector_Gadget_, is indeed better, but only in the sense of what a
severe migraine is to a heavy blow to the head: not as damaging, but
still painful as all hell.  Matthew Broderick plays the cop outfitted
with various mechanical gizmos to defeat the evil Claw (Rupert Everett,
cashing a paycheck) in this effects-laden, fast-paced film.  The problem,
though, is that the film is simply too fast-paced--a loud, hyperactively
acted, directed, and edited exercise in sensory overkill that calls out
for a lethal dose of Ritalin.  That none of the 80 or so minutes in the
film isn't slightly funny doesn't help--it just makes you reach for more
Excedrin.

 Its a sad state of affairs when Republicans and Democrats can get along
better than rival movie studios.  Nine times out of ten, republicans and
democrats can't sit in the same room without yelling, yet, with at least
some bipartisan cooperation, they can churn out a good law every once in a
while.
 Movie studios, on the other hand, refuse to collaborate even when it would
be in there best interests.  Case in point: Inspector Gadget and Wild Wild
West.
 Inspector Gadget is the latest in a string of cartoon adaptations that
generally annoy me.  This one, however, would have been a lot better under
the command of Barry Sonnefield.  Sonnfield decided to do Wild Wild West, a
movie with no plot, no fine performances, and a focus on action. Novice
director David Kellogg got to do inspector Gadget, a film that has plot, has
performances, and has a focus on comedy.  It just lacks that particular
thing called timing.
 Where as Wild Wild West never made me laugh, Inspector Gadget irked out a
few (by definition, I laughed exactly three times during the movie).
However, Inspector Gadget's wet behind the ears director David Kellogg just
couldn't handle a movie of Inspector Gadget's plot... and that's not a lot
to ask.
 Of course, I can't get my wish and Inspector Gadget WASN'T done by Barry
Sonnfield, so instead I had to sit through the hour and a half of Disney
crap.
 Inspector Gadget tells the story of John Brown (Matthew Broderick), who
gets a serious injury while trying to stop Claw (Rupert Everett, the fun
part of the movie) from getting away with robbery and murder.  He becomes
the experimental prototype of a new form of cybernetic police officer known
as Inspector Gadget, and gets to fulfill his dream of becoming a supercop.
Of course he has a love interest, Brenda (Joely Fisher).  Of course he has a
car that talks back to him (can we say LOVE BUG?).
 Basically, Claw creates a duplicate evil Gadget (also played by Broderick,
who has versatility even in as flat a role as Inspector Gadget offers him)
who tries to destroy Riverdale and, from then in, the movie is completely
cliche and predictable.
 Of the several annoyances I have over this film, three rank high on my
list.  The first is that all of the great actors are given terrible roles.
Rupert Everett, Andy Dick, Mathew Broderick.  These are three people able to
pass off a joke in a Nazi Death Camp (along with Roberto Benigni), but the
writers don't give them a single chance.  Two, the cartoon wasn't that good
to begin with (I spent a good portion of my youth watching its ilk), and the
movie was worse than the cartoon, and three, it decided that it was going to
rename the city Riverdale.
 The movie is obviously filmed in Pittsburgh, a city that truly shines out
in the film, yet the writers decided to set the movie in Riverdale.  Hello?
What does that do if everyone notices the city as Pittsburgh?  Of course,
I'm only saying this because I live near the burgh and for some reason the
steel city grows on you (kinda like New Jersey), but I still think it's a
crock.  A lot more people would have been happy if they moved it to
Pittsburgh, but NO!
 It doesn't matter, anyway.  Even if they moved the location to Pittsburgh,
the movie would have still sucked.  It just should have been done with the
touch of Sonnfield, not some idiot still reading a camera manual.
