There is a school of thought that believes striving for reality in art is not 
a worthwhile pursuit. I've never understood why; we live in reality, we 
connect with it, it's exciting. Think of all the types of situations you find 
yourself in every week -- there'll always be some forms of happiness, 
sadness, expectation, disappointment, serenity, tumult, calm and anger. Life, 
to use a horrible cliché, dear friends, is an emotional roller coaster!
"Wonderland" is glorious proof of that, a film of scruffy beauty and 
spellbinding power, which seems constructed to capture the appeal of 
eavesdropping. That pastime is involving, of course, because of our 
instinctive fascination with humanity; this movie uses the same hook, diving 
into the lives of several Londoners, all of whom are connected by family 
ties, but are at different stages of their lives and have different 
occupations.
Nadia (Gina McKee) is an attractive but lonely waitress, who places a lot of 
personal ads but allows herself to get upset every time she goes on a date. 
One of her sisters, Molly (Molly Parker), is married and pregnant; the other, 
Debbie (Shirley Henderson), is raising her son alone. Their parents are 
Eileen (Kika Markham) and Bill (Jack Shepherd), two pathetically unhappy 
people who mope around the house, and occasionally cringe; because of barking 
dogs, broken appliances, boredom or simple fear of leaving the house.
We also meet up with partners and ex-partners, friends, acquaintances, 
neighbours, estranged relatives, colleagues... "Wonderland" never announces 
itself as a definite study of anything in particular, which gives it the 
freedom to roam around, to spy on whomever's interesting.
The director, Michael Winterbottom, shoots everything in a grainy, hand-held, 
almost camcorder style which makes events seem imparted to us from the inside 
out, rather than staged and shot. It's as if invisible camera crews had been 
ceaselessly exploring London. It's essential to the sense that we're watching 
real people who aren't aware of our presence.
This could have come across as solemn and grimy, like any of those pathetic 
TV documentaries that follow losers around their places of work and play. But 
in between the quiet, sober scenes are astounding sequences where the camera 
submerges in neon light, the editing plays around with cutting and speed, and 
Michael Nyman's grand score soars on the soundtrack. The whole movie uses 
London as a backdrop, letting us unconsciously absorb it; these grand musical 
moments explicitly rejoice in the city's strange beauty, and announce that 
the film is not scrutinising life, but gazing at it in wonderment.
So music is an important tone-setter in "Wonderland" -- but it's always kept 
for these side-moments, and never interferes with the drama. Scenes do not 
follow typical Hollywood constructions; there isn't a little climax every 
five minutes, characters don't subtly recap their situations to each other to 
let the audience know what's going on. Everything plays out at a realistic 
pace, and we get our bearings by picking up on mood, tone, emotions. 
Winterbottom, his actors, and even his extras, have a knack for capturing the 
way conversational rhythms actually do sound -- in homes, hairdressers' shops 
and pubs; on dates, the phone, and everywhere else the story goes.
And that is why this beautiful film has been made. It is a devoted record of 
modern human behaviour. I dreaded that there would be some hugely 
inappropriate surprise plot development near the ending, but no -- 
Winterbottom and screenwriter Laurence Cordiat know that most of us don't end 
a typical weekend by stumbling into life-changing experiences. "Wonderland" 
is such an acute observance of people that it makes us confront our essential 
feelings about our fellow man. And to any foreigners out there, wondering 
what it's like to be in Britain -- just take a look at this movie.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
After Jude and Welcome to Sarajevo, a person might have certain
preconceptions about director Michael Winterbottom.  To call them both
both dark films is a bit of an understatement.  I was actually smacked
in the head after letting a female co-worker borrower my copy of Jude.
All of this makes Winterbottom's latest - Wonderland - even more of a
surprise.  And when I say `surprise,' I don't mean it in a good way.
An unwelcome change of pace for Winterbottom, Wonderland follows three
generations of a South London family through a tumultuous November
weekend.  Each family member has their own story line, and they
frequently intersect with each other.  Their stories are almost all
boring, particularly coming on the heels of Paul Thomas Anderson's far
superior film Magnolia.  In fact, Wonderland will really make you
appreciate how good Magnolia was, even for you dicks that walked out
after the first hour.
It's not all bad.  The acting is solid, showing that Winterbottom is, if
nothing else, routinely capable of eliciting great performances from his
casts.  The problem is with the script, written by debut screenwriter
Laurence Coriat.  Winterbottom's two previous gems were adapted from
novels (Jude from Thomas Hardy's `Jude the Obscure' and Sarajevo from
Michael Nicholson's `Natasha's Story').  Dude, find some more messed-up
books and direct them instead of stories from first-time writers.
Mum - Eileen (Kika Markham) hates her husband Bill (Jack Shepherd),
constantly badgering him and calling him `pathetic.'  Their relationship
started to crumble when their youngest child and only son ran away from
home, apparently so he could have sex with his girlfriend.  Oh, yeah 
Bill seems to have a thing for his black neighbor, as well.  Eileen and
Bill also spawned three daughters, including:
Debbie (Shirley Henderson, Topsy-Turvy), a divorced hairdresser (with
bad hair, no less) that loves penis almost as much as her only child,
eleven-year-old soccer fan Jack (Peter Marfleet).  Her ex-husband Dan
(Ian Hart, The End of the Affair) is an irresponsible lout.
Molly (Molly Parker, Dean Koontz's Intensity) is about to have her first
child and is happily married to a kitchen remodeling salesman named
Eddie (John Simm, Cracker), who hates his job, wants to quit and doesn't
so much want a wife or kid.
Nadia (Gina McKee, Notting Hill) a gangly waitress that hopelessly looks
for love in the personal ads, but has yet to manage a third date with
any of them.
Did I miss something here?  Did Winterbottom wake up and find a vagina
between his legs?  Although I don't have an inherent problem with
chick-flicks, I do have a problem with a guy that's made two strong,
masculine films making a wimpy flick where all of the male characters
are deplorable.  The women in Wonderland aren't much better than the
men, but it is definitely told from a female perspective.  On the plus
side, each character is miserable in their own way.  The only person
that seems remotely happy is little Jack when he sneaks out of his house
to go to the Bonfire Night festival, but then he gets mugged.
Just to keep things interesting, Winterbottom employed several kooky
techniques to Wonderland.  He used only hand-held cameras and hidden
microphones.  There were no extras, no lights and no clapperboard was
used during filming.  Winterbottom also chose to use 16mm film, which
was later blown up to 35mm.  The result, as you can imagine, is very
grainy and looks a bit like a documentary.  While attempting a sort of
cinematic freedom, Winterbottom readily denies the fact that he tried to
copy the Dogme aesthetic.  In fact, Wonderland was in pre-production
when the first two Dogme films (The Celebration and The Idiots) screened
at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival, where the director sat on the jury.
But despite not trying to achieve results like his Danish counterparts,
the hospital scenes at the end of Wonderland look very Kingdom-esque.
