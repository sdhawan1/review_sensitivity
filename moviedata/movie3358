     By now you probably know the premise.  Diane Keaton plays J. C. Wiatt,
"The Tiger Lady," and a stereotyped yuppie marketing manager, on the verge of
being promoted to a partnership in her agency.  Then she inherits a baby from a
distant relative.  Ignoring the suspension of disbelief inherent in the way the
movie shows the adoption process, J.C. ends up trying to be super-Mom--and
still work 70 hours a week.  
     The plot turns on J.C. finding a clever way to deal with her situation.
There is also a romantic interest, J.C.'s live-in lover having walked out once
the baby came.  Unfortunately, the ending is completely predictable by the
middle of the movie, though it's still handled well.
     The pluses--some very funny moments, especially those centering on yuppie
cliches  (e.g. J.C. learning about how important it is to get baby Elizabeth 
into the "right" pre-school), a nice conciousness of feminist values (which
includes some indication of men as nurturing parents as well) and some nice
scenery in Vermont.
     The minuses--the baby is just a little too sweet, the plot is a little too
pat, Diane Keaton is far too unbelievable in her "successful businesswoman"
persona (unless you think that marketing executives stammer and giggle "gee,
that's really great" when a potential promotion is discussed) and nobody in the
cast had ever bothered to find out what a Vermont accent really sounds like.
     Overall, the plusses outweigh the minuses.  3 stars.
