There are some films that never let you go. For me, Ingmar Bergman's
"Persona" (1966) is such a film. Because it has great depth and resonance,
new facets of meaning emerge with each viewing. Yet it defies being
completely understood, but that is part of its beauty and power.
When I first saw "Persona," I didn't quite know what to make of it. I
thought it was a haunting, enigmatic cinepoem, but my mind was unable to
grasp it all at once. Much as a wonderfully complex novel demands careful,
multiple readings, I knew I would have to see the film several times to
start to gauge its depth, even though it's only 81 minutes long.
Every time I watch this film, my mind still reels a little, but that's not
surprising. There's a kind of psychological vertigo operating in "Persona"
that complements its theme of slippery, shifting, ambiguous personal
identity. And Bergman takes great pains to make the people in his audience
sharply conscious of the fact that they are watching a movie. Thus, the film
is also about the vampiric voyeurism that is inherently part of cinema and
the corresponding loss of self it produces.
In "Persona," much of the viewer's time is spent looking at the faces of a
pair of women who are very similar in appearance, and as the story
progresses there are moments when the two women seem to become one. In a
striking sequence near the beginning of the film, an adolescent boy reaches
for an image of a huge face apparently projected on a screen that he can
almost--but not quite--touch. The face shown in this sequence alternates
between the visages of Liv Ullmann and Bibi Andersson, the actresses who
portray the main characters in the film. And much later in the movie, in one
of the most stunning images in all of cinema, a composite face is formed,
half Ullmann's face and the other half Andersson's. There is, in fact, much
loving, lingering camera work devoted to faces throughout the film, and it
struck me as reminiscent of the incredibly emotive things they used to do
with faces in silent films.
The story in "Persona" is deceptively simple. It revolves around Alma
(Andersson), a 25-year-old nurse put in charge of Elisabet Vogler (Ullmann),
a well-known stage and screen actress who has suddenly, inexplicably stopped
speaking. Elisabet steadfastly maintains her silence, evidently through the
sheer strength of her will. Early on, Alma expresses feelings of inadequacy
to the psychiatrist in charge of the case, fearing that this patient might
require a more experienced nurse.
Nothing seems to be really wrong with Elisabet, except for her stubborn
refusal to speak. When there seems no good reason for the actress to remain
at the hospital any longer, the attending psychiatrist suggests that she
stay at a rustic seaside cottage for a while under Alma's supervision. There
the nurse does all the talking for both of them. A little in awe of the
actress, the nurse is caught up in her glamour and magnetism. Slowly, Alma
becomes taken over by Elisabet's persona and temporarily loses part of her
own identity in the process.
One evening at the cottage while the two women are relaxing and sipping
wine, Alma confesses to Elisabet an incident where, even though she was
engaged to be married, she had sex with strangers without her fiance's
knowledge. But the nurse goes on to tell of the incident's painful
consequences and how she still feels tormented by it. In some ways, the
telling of this story makes for a highly erotically charged scene, yet I
found that at the same time Alma's feelings of desperation and despair all
but cancel out the eroticism.
Not long after sharing this confidence, Alma reads a letter which Elisabet
has given her to mail and makes the discovery that the actress regards her
as an interesting study, perhaps something she can use in her acting
someday. Alma's feelings of disappointment and betrayal as she reads the
letter make for a heartbreaking moment of shattered illusions, superbly
realized by Bibi Andersson.
In reprisal for her perceived betrayal, the nurse lashes out in an attempt
to emotionally wound her patient, and this causes Elisabet to retaliate in
kind. The conflict between the two women heightens until we are eventually
drawn into a lengthy dream where Alma's identity temporarily merges with
Elisabet's, and this dream sequence adds to the film's enormous emotional
impact.
It is during this dream sequence that a stunning repeated monologue occurs.
It unfolds twice, and each time it is seen from a different point of view.
What Bergman does here is completely unexpected, and I was at first taken
aback by it, although after seeing it many times, I see it as a stroke of
genius.  Although I doubt that I ever will completely understand it, I am
always affected by its haunting resonance.
Twice Alma speaks the same rather lengthy monologue, in which she accuses
Elisabet of being unable to bond with her own son, and each time the words
and delivery are almost exactly the same. At this point, the two women's
personas are so difficult to differentiate that the scene has the eerie,
evocative effect of something seen from each side of a mirror. The first
time Alma's monologue is delivered the camera focuses on Elisabet's face,
the second time on Alma's.
At the end of Alma's repeated monologue, the fusion of the two identities is
indicated by the famous image of the composite face which is half Elisabet's
and half Alma's. But before the dream ends, Alma somehow manages to reassert
her separate identity. To my mind, this extended dream sequence is a tour de
force--managing to be simultaneously both surreal and super-real.
When Alma awakens from her dream, she finds Elisabet packing a suitcase, and
both women seem to have come to some strange sort of closure that allows
them to keep their respective demons at bay, at least for a while. The women
prepare to leave the beach cottage, apparently ready to return to their
normal lives and their separate identities.
"Persona" is hardly a film that uses strictly linear storytelling, and I
would be remiss if I failed to point out that there are some short, visually
jarring sequences at the beginning, roughly at the middle, and near the end
of the film. These sequences show such things as film projector components,
film winding over spools, a segment from an animated cartoon, a fragment
from a silent farce involving a skeleton, a spider, the slaughter of a lamb,
a human hand pierced by a spike, and views of hospital grounds and a morgue.
These sequences are not directly part of the narrative as described above,
but are about filmmaking itself, and I like to think of them as a kind of
matrix that surrounds and defines the story of Alma and Elisabet.
Bergman's films are so dear to me that I find it impossible to single out
just one as my favorite, and while I love "Wild Strawberries" (1957) and
"The Seventh Seal" (1956), "Persona" is definitely one of my favorites as
well. It has an uncanny ability to reach down into the depths of the
subconscious with its dream-like quality, and on this basis alone, I believe
this Swedish film must be considered a masterpiece of world cinema. It also
features a point-perfect visual sense, superb cinematography by Sven
Nykvist, and extraordinary performances by Andersson and Ullmann, both of
whom have extremely difficult roles. Andersson carries the weight of
delivering almost all the dialogue in the film, while Ullmann must rely on
her facial expressions, body language, and magnetic presence to take her
where words cannot. And Ullmann does so with such mesmerizing force that she
makes it credible that the nurse could come close to losing herself for a
while under the actress' spell.
Although "Persona" is one of my favorites, I realize it's not a film for
everyone. The critic John Simon wrote that it was probably "the most
difficult film ever made." Although I don't completely agree with him, I can
certainly understand his point. "Persona" initially baffled me, yet each
time I see it, I comprehend just a bit more. "Persona" is a difficult film,
but if you're up for a challenge, it's an intellectually rewarding and
emotionally rich experience.

The thing I like best about Ingmar Bergman's "Persona" is how it's able to
work on so many complex levels yet never separate themselves from one
another.  On one level, there's a story of two people represented two parts
of the human psyche.  On another level, there's a scathing portrait of
method acting.  On yet another level, there's a scathing portrait of films
as mirrors of life.  On even another level there's a tale of unity amongst
different people.  And there's even a level about the way we sometimes hide
another an entirely different persona to escape from our own, as well as
the world.  There's probably a couple other levels this film works on that
I'm not thinking of right now or haven't realized yet.
I like any film that has multiple levels that it works on, but it's so rare
that a film is able to use all its different levels so that they all work
with one another.  Every level benefits another level, like cinematic
puzzle pieces, all interlocking with one another to form a large portrait. 
Sure, I enjoy a film like "2001: A Space Odyssey" where there are several
levels it can work on, even if they don't work with one another, but when I
see a film like "Persona" where it works like this, I just have to give it
much more respect.
"Persona" is a baffling, confusing, and sometimes even confusing piece of
surrealism that often makes little sense until much later.  The underlying
story is very simple: an actress, Elisabeth (Liv Ullmann, in her first
Bergman film), suddenly becomes catatonic during a performance of a play
she's in, and is sent to be cured by a nurse named Alma (Bergman regular,
Bibi Andersson).  The two retreat to a head nurse's summer home on a
secluded island, where Alma tries to get Elisabeth to talk and open up as
she talks her head off, eventually opening so much to her that she exposes
her deepest secrets.
It would seem from this description that "Persona" could be a long, boring,
foreign retread of "The Miracle Worker," the story of Helen Keller and how
she learned to communicate.  But Bergman's way too existential for that. 
He not only takes the story somewhere, as well as adding a ton of depth
(personal and universal), but he really makes it into a big experience. 
Watching "Persona" is hypnotic, not only because it demands full attention
of the audience to what everything means, but because it's so well
directed, and so gorgeous to look at.
>From the first shot, "Persona" grabs our attention, doing so by throwing us
a curveball.  The film shows us lots of random images (including a couple
shots from his older films), such as a man having a nail pounded into his
hand, and a camera starting up, and eventually arrives at a shot of a boy
laying down on a bed, watching a film on a giant screen.  At first, this
seems overly self-indulgent (and you know how much I love self-indugency),
but later makes sense with the rest of the film, as the film ends with a
film projector turning off, and even has a middle part where the film
splices, and picks up in the next scene (Bergman apparently thought this
was an opportune place to put this, as he had no clue how to end the scene
- it works).
The film ultimately shows us how film attempts to mirror life, but kinda
fails, mostly by showing the relationship between Alma and Elisabeth, which
at first seems like Alma giving everything over to Elisabeth willingly, but
later turns into Elisabeth acting as a parasite, taking everything she can
from Alma, but at the same time giving a bit back.  She basically attempts
to become a carbon copy of Alma, coming off as only a bizarre version of
her as she attempts to study her so that she can become a better actress. 
Otherwise known as method acting.
The two eventually become one person, existentially forming two parts of
one person's psyche.  Watching their merging is one of the greatest
cinematic experiences in awhile, as the film uses original and fascinating
techniques to show this development.  At one point, the two sort of embrace
and form one body...at another point, each face is divided in half and then
placed side-by-side to show how much they resemble eachother.  In fact,
Bergman got the idea for the film, or at least the idea of who to cast,
when he saw both Ullmann and Andersson in public, and realized how much
they look alike (the one main difference between them is their respective
hair lengths).  Bergman even goes as far as to show one scene twice, from
two different point of views, to show how they each react to one situation.
Bergman only makes it better as he makes it a surrealistic experience. 
Often a fan of showing things through realistic dialogue and action,
"Persona" shows that his knack at creating surrealism makes his points come
much more alive, and the result is a film that not only demands a second
viewing, but makes it a pretty pleasurable experience.  Watching, say,
"Through a Glass Darkly" twice is a bit of a chore, but "Persona" is one of
the most chilling, disturbing, and even erotic films to ever be made.  The
entire film is beautifully shot by Bergman's favorite cinematographer, Sven
Nykvist, who makes every shot compeltely gorgeous, and well set-up, so that
the film resembles a dream.  Bergman knows that film is not a good way of
interpreting reality, that it's really an art form, and by filming it in
such a fashion, he makes his point come across in an incredibly competent
and rewarding fashion.
The best scene in the film comes about half way, where Alma, having become
more comfortable with her silent partner on the island, tells her of a time
when she cheated on her husband with a young boy while nude sunbathing on a
beach.  Bergman uses as few shots as possible, and only lets her words come
across.  It's a long scene, and it's even more amazing that he's able to
sustain such a high level of eroticism for so long, making it possibly the
most erotic experience ever put on film, and proving the fallacy that
Steven Soderbergh would make over 20 years later in "sex, lies, and
videotape": speaking about sex is much more erotic and satisfying than
actually having sex.
That this works with the rest of the film, in that it portays a mirror
image to the situation just like the film is a mirror image of realty,
makes the film much better, as it probably would have lost some steam due
to such a high increase in eroticism.  The film is able to hold a long
hypnotic spell the entire time, blowing its audience away with a bizarre
opening, and able to hold onto their attention for the entire 81 minute
running time.  There are a ton of great scenes - where Elisabeth panicks
after watching the tape of the Buddhist monk burning himself in protest to
the Vietnam War (or: the cover of the one Rage Against the Machine album);
where the two have a big fight; where Alma discovers Elisabeth's letters -
but they all work with one another, and every scene has the exact amount of
surrealism that it needs, making the film one of the best cinematic
experiences of all time.  Simply put.
