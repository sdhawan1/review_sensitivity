Witherspoon, John Astin, Kevin West, "Rock" Peace, John De Bello,
Charlie Jones
     Rick Rockwell is a cop working for "Rock" Peace, a veteran of the
two tomato wars.  He doesn't see the danger that exists with having
tomatoes around.  Scientist Crystal Carson is attacked by tomatoes and
goes to Rockwell for help.  He thinks it is a joke, but the two along
with Fuzzy Tomato (from RETURN OF THE KILLER TOMATOES: THE SEQUEL),
discover that the evil doctor Austin, who is impersonating the host of a
talk show called Geranahue (a stupid pun), plans to help tomatoes take
over the world.
     KILLER TOMATOES STRIKE BACK! is the sequel to the film RETURN OF
THE KILLER TOMATOES: THE SEQUEL.  KILLER TOMATOES STRIKE BACK! is a
pathetic excuse for a movie, but is not quite as bad as the original,
ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES.  The production values look higher, but
the jokes are just as lame.  Some of the actors are better than the
original but not much.  On a scale of zero to five, I give KILLER
TOMATOES STRIKE BACK! a one.  KILLER TOMATOES STRIKE BACK! is not
rated but contains adult situations.
     The best part of this film was the tomatoes.  They looked rather
cute, although I don't think that they were supposed to, and seemed to
do a better job than the actors.  Then again, they were probably easier
to train than the actors.  For the most part the actors do a horrible
job.  The two that I thought put in rather good performances were John
Astin, from the television show "The Addams Family" (not the movie), and
Charlie Jones.  John Astin is great as the evil professor Gangrene.  He
has an evil crazy appearance that makes his role totally believable.  If
it wasn't for him and the tomatoes this film would have been a total
loss.  Charlie Jones, who only has a cameo in this film, is funny as the
master of disguise.  Crystal Carson, although she looks good, shows no
acting ability and the scene with her in the shower is completely
stupid.  "Rock" Peace, who plays the tomato basher dude also shows no
acting ability at all and I have no clue as to why he keeps getting
called back for the role.  Couldn't they find anybody else who could do
a better job?  
     I feel even fans of camp films will find this one horrible and a
waste of time.  I can't recommend this film to anybody unless you found
ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES to be a wonderful film, and if you did I
feel sorry for you.  If you must see this film convince a friend to see
it and get him or her to rent it so you won't waste any money.
     One last note, at the beginning of the video cassette, for KILLER
TOMATOES STRIKE BACK! there is an ad for part four of the Tomatoes
trilogy (yes, I catch the joke) called KILLER TOMATOES EAT FRANCE,
which may or may not really exist.  If it does, it looks like it will be
as bad as KILLER TOMATOES STRIKE BACK!  If I ever find it on video
cassette I will write a review on it and tell you what I thought of it.
I would appreciate any comments on it if anybody has already seen it
(the copyright notice on the ad was 1991 so it probably would already be
on video cassette if it actually exists).
