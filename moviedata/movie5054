Brrrrrr.  Better bring along your heavy coat to THE CLAIM since it's 
palpably cold.  Set in the Sierra Nevada mountains in the harsh winter 
of 1867, the movie features knee-deep snow and blowing wind that sounds 
like a hungry coyote howling at the moon.
Daniel Dillon (Peter Mullan), a man with a stash of gold that looks like 
a miniature Fort Knox, owns and runs the remote mining town of Kingdom 
Come in which the story is set.  As the story opens, Dillon welcomes 
railroad engineer Donald Dalglish (Wes Bentley, AMERICAN BEAUTY) to his 
rough-and-tumble town.  Dalglish is looking for the best place in which 
to locate a station for a new railroad line.  Dillon, of course, rolls 
out the red carpet for Dalglish in hopes that he'll choose Kingdom Come.
In a town with only two visible businesses, a thriving saloon and an 
even more prosperous bordello, bribery for the railroad surveying crew 
comes in the form of liquor and sex.  The rustic town, as photographed 
in the warm, dark glow of kerosene lamps by Alwin H. Kuchler, feels 
completely authentic.  Only the price of rented passion seems a bit out 
of line.  The base price isn't revealed, but the prostitutes charge $30 
extra if the guys want to stay a little longer than normal.  $30 an hour 
in 1867 money?  You do the math.  That's a tidy sum.  Then, again, as 
the adage goes, the real money during the gold rush went to those who 
supplied the miners with their "needs."
THE CLAIM is loosely based on Thomas Hardy's "The Mayor of 
Casterbridge."  It being Winterbottom's second Hardy adaptation, I had 
really been looking forward to THE CLAIM.  His first, JUDE, a fairly 
literal adaptation of Hardy's "Jude the Obscure," was on my best of the 
year list back in 1996.  Although THE CLAIM's dramatic visuals surpass 
JUDE, in no other way is it comparable.  JUDE had a rich, 
character-driven screenplay, but Frank Cottrell Boyce's script for THE 
CLAIM leaves the images alone to tell the story.  None of the characters 
are properly developed.  The leads are merely sketched, and the 
supporting cast is almost completely ignored.  An unrecognizable 
Nastassja Kinski, as Daniel's sick wife is the most wasted of all.  
Kinski is given little more to do than cough.
The focal point of the story is the extremely lucrative mining claim 
that Daniel received years ago in trade for his wife and child, Hope.  
Grown now and having come to visit Daniel, Hope is played by Sarah 
Polley (THE SWEET HEREAFTER).  Hope doesn't know the secret, and the 
story's arc obviously leads to the big scene in which she will find out 
the truth.  Although this event should be the tearful culmination of the 
tragedy, it leaves you completely dry eyed since there isn't a single 
character worth caring about in THE CLAIM.  
THE CLAIM is an impressive exercise in visual style and atmospherics.  
It is a shame that it isn't more than that.
THE CLAIM runs 2:03.  It is rated R for sexuality and for some language 
and violence.  It would be acceptable for older teenagers.

Like Oliver Stone and the 1960s, or Barry Levinson and the City of
Baltimore, Michael Winterbottom may be forever associated with Victorian
author Thomas Hardy.  The Claim is the second film Winterbottom has
directed from a script based on one of Hardy's novels (the other was the
stellar Jude, from `Jude the Obscure').  Here, the director borrows the
story from Hardy's  `The Mayor of Casterbridge' but updates the setting
from 19th century Dorset, England to the waning days of the California
Gold Rush.
One of Winterbottom's gifts is his collaboration ability with actors of
various backgrounds, from the professionally trained Kate Winslet to 
errr  well, to Woody Harrelson.  And The Claim's marquee reads like a
who's who of people snubbed by Oscar over the last three years  Sarah
Polley (for 1997's The Sweet Hereafter), Peter Mullan (98's My Name is
Joe) and Wes Bentley (99's American Beauty).  Despite the acting talent
on board, and Winterbottom's familiarity with adapting Hardy's work, The
Claim doesn't work as well as it should.  It's still a decent film, and
it grows more and more interesting as it progresses, but the picture is
as flat as Calista Flockhart.
The film is set during 1867 in California's Sierra Nevada Mountains (it
was filmed in Alberta, British Columbia) and, as the film opens, the
tiny town of Kingdom Come has just welcomed two groups of people to its
settlement.  The first is led by Donald Daglish (Bentley), the chief
engineer of Central Pacific Railroad's expedition.  Daglish and his men
are one step ahead of CP's railroad and are looking for cities that are
topographically and geographically ideal for the construction of said
railroad.
The second group contains only two people  a young woman named Hope
(Polley) and her dying mother, Elena (Nastassja Kinski, who, ironically,
starred in the film version of Hardy's `Tess of the D'Urbervilles').  A
flashback from some two decades earlier tells us that a young Elena and
infant Hope were sold to a complete stranger for a small bag of gold by
none other than Hope's own father, Daniel Dillon.
Years after that callous transaction, Dillon (Mullan) parlayed the gold
into Kingdom Come.  He owns everything in the town and has settled down
with Lucia, the Portuguese manager of the local whorehouse (Milla
Jovovich, The Messenger).  Dillon has enough gold to open a private wing
in Fort Knox but needs a train station placed in his town for it to have
a chance to become a real city.  Of course, his plans for Kingdom Come
get put on the back burner when his former wife and grown daughter
stumble back into his life.
There's enough romantic potential in the film (Hope and Daglish, Daglish
and Lucia, Lucia and Dillon, Dillon and Elena, and a bizarre side story
focusing on a one of Daglish's workmen and a common hooker), but none of
it amounts to much.  The Claim certainly looks great  from the
realistic sets and props, to Alwin H. Kuchler's sound photography of the
snow, wind, trees and mountains  although it's not as quite as chilly
and bleak as A Time for Drunken Horses, or as pretty as Snow Falling on
Cedars.
Of the actors, Mullan and Polley are the only standouts.  Bentley, who
looks surprisingly like Tobey Maguire in Ride With the Devil, doesn't
seem as comfortable with his character as he did in Beauty, but he's
still the thinking man's Jared Leto.  Kinski has little to do but cough
up blood.
Winterbottom's direction is pretty ordinary and, for some reason, he
chooses to begin and end several of the scenes with out-of-focus shots.
Instead of having any kind of cinematic effect on the film, it succeeds
only in making viewers think the projectionist has fallen asleep.  It's
good to see Winterbottom return to adapting films from novels, as
opposed to the disappointing Wonderland, which was based on an original
screenplay.  Here, his Welcome to Sarajevo scribe Frank Cottrell Boyce
does the dirty work of taking Hardy's work and transposing it into
America's Wild West.
Interestingly, The Claim was originally called Kingdom Come but had to
change its name because of  hold on to your hats  a Whoopi Goldberg
film bearing the same name.  An online contest was created to choose a
new name, hence we have The Claim  which really applies to Dillon's
original claim to the gold, and then, later, his claim to his family.  A
nice touch, but a dumb name nonetheless.  The film's official website is
probably the best since The Blair Witch Project in terms of interesting
content.
2:03  R for nudity, adult language, violence and sexual content

 CLAIM, THE (director/writer: Michael Winterbottom; screenwriters:
 Frank Cottrell Boyce, inspired by the novel "The Mayor of
 Casterbridge" by Thomas Hardy; cinematographer: Alwin Kuchler; editor:
 Trevor Waite; cast: Wes Bentley (Dalglish), Milla Jovovich (Lucia),
 Nastassja Kinski (Elena Dillon), Peter Mullan (Daniel Dillon),
 Sarah Polley (Hope Dillon), Sean McGinley (Sweetley), Julian Richings
 (Bellanger), Shirley Henderson (Annie); Runtime: 120; United Artists;
 2000)
The Claim is a great western epic about the building of a frontier
American town and about the pioneer who built that town. It's an homage
to Robert Altman's insightful film, with the same theme, "McCabe and
Mrs. Miller." It was creatively adapted to the screen by English
director Michael Winterbottom (Jude/Welcome to Sarajevo/Wonderland) from
a novel by Thomas Hardy" The Mayor of Casterbridge," as the setting was
changed from England to a snowy gold-mining mountain town in
California's Sierra Nevada mountains called Kingdom Come. The time frame
was in 1867, some 20 years after the gold rush.
The lure of gold has drawn men to this remote and harsh territory, in a
town without a church but one with a prosperous saloon and brothel. The
town is owned by the benign despot, the mayor of the town, Mr. Dillon
(Peter Mullan), who also makes the laws and enforces them with the help
of his right-hand man, Mr. Sweetley (McGinley). Dillon is in his forties
and has a dark secret from some 20 years ago, of how he sold his wife
and young child to a prospector for his claim. It was with that claim
that he struck it rich and built this material empire for himself. His
mistress now is the town's testy brothel owner, Lucia (Jovovich), a
cultured whore of Portugese extraction, with a good head for business.
A caravan of people arrive in town, including an ailing mother and her
attractive twentysomething daughter. The dying mother is named Elena
(Nastassja Kinski). Her blonde daughter is named Hope (Sarah Polley).
They are the wife and daughter that have haunted the prosperous
businessmen ever since he chose wealth over love, using the excuse that
he was always drunk during those days. The mother has never told her
daughter that Dillon is her father, but has instead told her that he's a
relation. They have come here to confront Mr. Dillon in a way that will
not call attention to others why they are here. The dying mother, since
her husband has died and left her broke, wants to make certain Dillon
gives his daughter money so that she doesn't starve.
Also on that caravan is Dalglish (Wes Bentley), a surveyor for the
Central Pacific Railroad. He's important to the town because if the
railroad approves of laying tracks in town that will mean certain
prosperity, but if they choose to bypass the town that means death.
Dalglish is the young Scottish version of Dillon. He's a handsome young
man, who is very ambitious and is capable of doing his task in a
hard-headed business way; he is not fooled by the red carpet treatment
he's given by Dillon as he's offered money, free drinks, free hotel
rooms, and whores. He gladly accepts the women and the booze, but has
trouble with being openly bribed by money. What he knows for certain, is
that he's attracted to the peachy looking Hope. Lucia also finds him
attractive and when disappointed by Dillon's attention going to the two
newly arrived women, she comes onto Dalglish. He prefers Hope, but when
there are obstacles between them he's quite willing to be with Lucia. It
all indicates that even though he's honestly doing his job, he seems to
be someone who has chinks in his armor and might in the future be more
easily corrupted.
The Claim works best as an antitraditional Western epic that presents an
allegorical drama of fate, retribution and redemption. It took a certain
courage for Dillon, the flawed hero of the story, to come out to this
barren land and make something out of it. The next generation to come
out here was represented by the brashness of young Dalglish, who will
have it easier than the pioneers. He will have more to work with, but
the baton has been passed on and he will also have to face his dark side
and see if he can overcome his mistakes and build something that is
worthwhile and lasting. The film might not have been engaging
dramatically at all times, as it parcelled out its long tale reluctantly
in bits and pieces, but it sets a haunting mood relating the lives of
these laconic characters to the building of the country. It shows how
the country consisted of people from all over the world who had dreams
of success. In The Claim these pioneers and emigrants are Scottish,
Polish, Irish, and Portuguese. These are the builders of America who
found sanctuary in the snow-covered mountain town and brought
civilization to the country, even though they did it in such a violent
and messy way. The Claim also does not forget the English influence on
these settlers, this is shown by a poem being read from Shelley's
"Ozymandias."
The film is satisfying because it remains elusive as to what the
ingredient for success and happiness is, as each character wants
something else in their American Dream. This is a country where
individual freedom is cherished, and this film does that concept a great
honor by not trivializing that dream to be the same for everyone. It
shows how a successful town could live with a diverse population, a
whorehouse, a church, and gold-mining camps.
There are a number of striking visual scenes; such as, the train passing
through the breathtaking mountain landscape, which indicates what a
difficult chore it must have been to lay tracks in that location. A
surreal shot of a horse on fire galloping on the mountain snow. Another
great shot was the house moving of Dillon's Victorian house, a tribute
to the workforce in the community who rallied together to support one
another in a time of need.
The Scottish actor Peter Mullen gave a wonderfully restrained
performance, convincing as the man who did wrong and doesn't know how to
make things right except by trying to when given a second chance. Sarah
Polley is a marvelous young Canadian actress, whose stubborn girlish
behavior comes to a climax when she falls in love and begins to
understand her mother in a way she couldn't before; circumstances have
changed so rapidly when she learns about her mother's secret and she is
on her own out of necessity.
As in "McCabe...," there's a gloomy ending that reflects on how
disasterous and empty a life of greed is. It's a bleak film that manages
to give one hope for a situation that seems hopeless, and that is the
strength of this very enriching film. It has captured a slice of the
American West from a book that was written as an English period piece.

   Some movies consider second chances--Brett Ratner's
"The Family Man," for example--about what sort of life we
might have had if only....  Other movies in a similar vein are
more realistic.  We can't change what happened years ago,
but Michael Winterbottom's "The Claim" instructs us about
what one man does when given the chance to make up for a
moral failure in the past.  "The Claim" is not about a guy who
goes to summer school to make up for his 55 in Computer
Science.  In fact the film takes place principally in 1869, 
before computers or electric light bulbs were invented and
about the time that cameras began taking snapshots and
views of town life.  In fact thanks largely to the invention of
photography, Winterbottom's crew, particularly production
designer Mark Tildesley, were able to reconstruct a California
town just as it looked 130 years ago--not the easiest job
considering that the hamlet was erected in minus thirty
degrees temperature with winds sometimes gusting to one
hundred miles per hour.  
   Winterbottom's camera man, Alwin Kuchler, captures the
majesty of Fortress Mountain high in the Canadian Rockies to
simulate the wild west town of Kingdom Come, California--
some twenty years after the discovery of gold led to the
migration of a half million people of pioneer spirit in search of
wealth and a greater degree of independence than the East
could afford. Winterbottom's picture, then, is a western
complete with a town bar (although the manager here is not
named Kitty), with just a fraction of the gunplay of the
traditional genre movie popular during the forties and fifties,
and with some moments of peak drama of the sort exploited
by Fred Zinnemann's "High Noon." 
   Inspired by Thomas Hardy's "The Mayor of Casterbridge"
this tale of greed, guilt, and redemption scripted by Frank
Cottrell Boyce centers on a man who is more than the chief
political honcho of the town of Kingdom Come, Daniel Dillon
(Peter Mullan). Dillon runs the town because he owns
everything in it--the bar, the brothel, the bank, the respect of
all who know him and never call him anything but Mr. Dillon. 
In a few brief flashbacks that take us back twenty years, we
find out that he acquired his wealth when, trudging in knee-
deep snow out in nowhere with his wife and newborn baby,
he agrees to a Faustian bargain.  In return for a bag of gold
from a man who insists that he needs a woman more than
the money, he sells his wife Elena (Natassja Kinski) and his
newborn, Hope (Sarah Polley).  During the years of living the
high life, Daniel enjoys the carnal companionship of barkeep
and brothel manager Lucia (Milla Jovovich) and appears to
lack only a railroad to pass through the town--without which
the village could not long prosper.  As Donald Dalglish (Wes
Bentley) scouts areas to find the ideal locations for the tracks
that his company is prepared to construct, he is courted by
Dillon (who tries unsuccessfully to bribe the young man) and
in turn by the lovely twenty-year-old Hope--who has traveled
to the burg with her mother unaware that Dillon is her sell-out
dad.
   Winterbottom presumably shows us what California was
like without the glitter and gloss that slickly commercial
westerns have afforded.  We see that the men rarely change
their clothes and are the sorts that we today would probably
move far away from if traveling with them on the very tracks
that were built over a century ago by thousands of
immigrants making just pennies a day.  The views of the
Rockies are stunning; covered with snow, streams running
through, still virgin land beginning to smart at the
rapaciousness of the builders and miners.  
   What the movie lacks, however, is sufficient character and
plot development.  Moviegoers could be confused by the
flashbacks were they not aware of the ill deed done twenty
years earlier by the principal character, whose feeling of guilt
comes dramatically to the surface when confronted by his
wife and daughter.  The romance between Hope Dillon and
railroad scout Donald Dalglish is odd.  Though love at first
sight does indeed exist, only Sarah Polley's in the role of the
innocent but curious twenty-year-old comes across
convincingly.   Nastassja Kinski, remarkable in Roman
Polanski's "Tess" (also based on a novel by Thomas Hardy),
gets little to do but flash her ghostly, consumption-ridden
pallor across the screen.  Peter Mullan's rendition of a virtual
Nineteenth Century baron--whose fate is foreshadowed when
one of the locals performing in the bar delivers a rendition of
Percy Byshe Shelley's poem "Ozymandias" written in 1817--
overshadows the rest of the cast whether loudly shutting up
the chatty denizens of the bar during a recital by his daughter
or simply looking morose when ultimately considering the
meaninglessness of his wealth.  The Glaswegian perfomer is
well suited to a cast representing the large body of European
immigrants (in this case from Ireland) who had left their
famine-stricken lands in search of gold and glory.  
   While all that glitters is not gold in Winterbottom's film of
American pioneers, many of whom left the claustrophobic
confines of effete cities while others fled from the insularity of
their European homelands--"The Claim" is a reasonably good
meshing of a personal story with a chapter of America at a
time that rugged individualism, and not paper shuffling in
office cubicles, was the order of the day.
