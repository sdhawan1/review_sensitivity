 The Emperor's New Groove (2000) 3 stars out of 4. Featuring the vocal
talents of David Spade, John Goodman, Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton.
Story by Chris Williams and Mark Dindal. Screenplay by David Reynolds.
Head of story Stephen Anderson. Music by John Debney. Songs by Sting and
David Hartley. Directed by Mark Dindal. Rated G.
 In recent years, with such works as Beauty and the Beast, The Lion
King, The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Tarzan, the Disney animation
unitís work has been spectacular and literary ó high-brow, if you
please.
 These features have been just as satisfying for adults as for children.
 Now comes The Emperorís New Groove. If the above mentioned titles can
be likened to grand opera, than this newest Disney offering is on the
level of vaudeville.
 Don't misconstrue. The Emperorís New Groove is a delightful little
pastiche that lacks the grandeur of its predecessors.
 But what it is missing in production values is compensated by its voice
talents.
 It must be the true millennium for I am about to do something I never
thought possible ó compliment David Spade.
 This annoying little comic actor has, since his days on Saturday Night
Live, made a career out of sarcasm. Mostly, he is grating and annoying.
 Yet it is just these qualities (or deficiencies, depending on your
point of view) that make his foray into the wonderful world of Disney
animation so successful.
 Spade voices Kuzco, emperor of a mythical mountain kingdom in a
pre-Columbian South America. Kuzco is arrogant, egocentric, spoiled and
selfish, thinking only of his own pleasure.
 He treats everyone with contempt and condescension, including his chief
adviser, Yzma (voiced by the legendary Eartha Kitt).
 After being fired by Kuzco, the power-hungry Yzma transforms the young
emperor into a llama. The metamorphosed ruler is stranded in the jungle
where his only hope of returning to his palace and regaining his throne
rests with a peasant named Pacha (voiced by John Goodman), whose village
he was about to destroy to make room for his summer palace playground.
 Pacha, a good-hearted soul, agrees to help Kuzco if he promises not
raze the village. The devious Kuzco, to whom a promise means nothing,
agrees, of course, and the mismatched pair set out to set things right.
 At about 80 minutes, The Emperorís New Groove moves quickly. The
animation, especially the backgrounds, is sketchy. The depth and detail
that went into previous efforts such as Tarzan are wanting, but that is
not much of a drawback since the story is a piece of fluff ó sort of a
fairy tale with a moral for the youngsters.
 Of course by the finale, Kuzco is changed back into a human being, has
learned the true meaning of friendship and is a reformed ruler. The only
missing ingredient is Jiminy Cricket singing ěWhen You Wish Upon a
Star.î
 I donít believe I am writing these words, but Spade is perfect as the
arrogant emperor you love to hate. He plays his voice like a violin,
making his character one you can despise, but not crossing the line so
that you cannot root for his reformation.
 Goodman does well as the honorable peasant, while Kitt is wonderfully
flamboyant and hammy as the evil Yzma.
 However, they all pale in comparison to Patrick Warburtonís Kronk,
Yzmaís muscle-bound manservant. If the name doesnít sound familiar,
Warburtonís claim to fame was as Puddy, Elaineís off-again, on-again
boyfriend on TVís Seinfeld.
 In The Emperorís New Groove, he steals the film as the somewhat dim,
right-hand man of Yzma. Kronk can and would rather whip up a gourmet
meal or speak to the forest animals in their own language, than do his
masterís evil bidding.
 It is a wonderful performance and should lead to bigger and better
roles for this fine comic actor in live-action films.
 The filmís songs by Sting are serviceable, but lack the soaring
splendor of The Lion King or Beauty and the Beast.
 Overall, The Emperorís New Groove is more a childrenís adventure than
previous Disney outings. But adults shouldnít be dissuaded from giving
it a look-see. It all depends on your David Spade tolerance quotient.

Disney's THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE, directed by Mark Dindal (CAT'S DON'T 
DANCE), is a throwback to those old cartoon movies with silly, paper 
thin plots and wisecracking characters.  Without any pretensions and 
without wasting much time trying to entertain the adults in the 
audience, the movie is as carefully targeted to its intended 
demographics as a Saturday morning cartoon series.  Any kid younger than 
13 will undoubtedly love it.  Older viewers may be less impressed, but 
it's a hard film to dislike.  Even if there may be few outright laughs, 
the story keeps a smile on your face.
David Spade (LOST & FOUND) plays the leading part of the egotistical 
Emperor Kuzco.  It is a part that manages to take advantage of David 
Spade's limited talents.  Kuzco considers it part of his birthright to 
be able to abuse the peasants of his kingdom.  He continues to do so 
even after his nemesis, Yzma (Eartha Kitt), turns him into a llama.
One such peasant is a llama herder named Pacha (John Goodman).  Kuzco 
wants to wipe out Pacha's village so that he can build Kuzcotopia, a 
summer home that looks like a water-based amusement park.  In one of the 
story's funniest scenes, Kuzco stops the action so that he can remind us 
that the story is about him.  To illustrate this point he uses a marker 
to draw a big circle around himself and to obliterate Pacha.  Following 
the standard buddy movie formula, Kuzco and Pacha are a pair of 
squabbling characters who eventually come to respect and help each 
other.
Perhaps the story's best character is Yzma's right hand man, Kronk 
(Patrick Warburton), a square jawed hunk that looks like Gaston from 
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  Kronk, who speaks fluent squirrel, is low on IQ 
and common sense.  His shoulder-based devil and angel figures who advise 
him are as stupid as he is.  He does, however, make great spinach puffs.
Feeling in tone much like DreamWorks' THE ROAD TO EL DORADO, THE 
EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE doesn't break any new ground, but it is diverting 
for the adults and fun for the kids.  My personal favorite part of the 
movie is the map shown to trace the character's progress on their way 
back to the palace.  It is a plot device that we don't see much any 
more.  Like most of the rest of the picture, it brought a smile to my 
face even if it didn't generate any outright laughs.
THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE runs a fast 1:20.  It is rated G and is fine 
for all ages.
My son Jeffrey, age 11, saw the film with most of his sixth grade class, 
who liked the picture.  I interviewed 4 of them afterwards.  Jeffrey and 
Rajiv gave it *** 1/2, and John and Maxim gave it ****.  They thought 
the film was funny and had a cute plot.  They liked the way that the 
Emperor kept reminding us that the story was about him.  Their favorite 
characters were Kronk, Kuzco and the cat.

     At various points during Disney's THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE, it
becomes apparent that it could have been a mediocre-at-best piece of
animated film-making. Here there's a significant lack of detail in the
background animation; over there, a gaping hole where a catchy tune might
have buoyed the proceedings; throughout, a narrative that doesn't exactly
set the world on fire. Yes, it's all pretty tepid stuff -- and then a
character will open his mouth, and set you to giggling uncontrolably.
After years of watching its animated features soar on various permutations
of stunning visuals, engaging story-telling and memorable songs, Disney
has finally made a film that succeeds almost exclusively on the strength
of its vocal performances.
     And it does so by a fairly narrow margin. The straightforward plot
focuses on Kuzco (voice of David Space), an arrogant teenage emperor of a
culture somewhere in pre-Colombian America. Kuzco is on the verge of
turning the family home of a gentle peasant named Pacha (John Goodman)
into a summer palace when he invokes the ire of his nasty advisor Yzma
(Eartha Kitt). With the aid of her simpleton henchman Kronk (Patrick
Warburton), Yzma slips Kuzco a potion that turns him into a llama.
Stranded alone in the jungle, Kuzco's only chance of returning to his old
imperial, human self is  you guessed it, the same gentle peasant whose
family home he was set to destroy. Bonding and learning of important
lessons ensues.
     In a way, the whole business is quite beneath Disney. Much of THE
EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE feels cobbled together as an afterthought, as though
the real A-team Mouseke-thinkers were too busy making FANTASIA 2000 or
figuring out how to promote 102 DALMATIANS. While the character animation
is effective, virtually everything else is about as eye-catching as your
typical Hanna-Barbera background. The progression of the story is bland,
with only a couple of really good action set pieces to liven things up.
Meanwhile, the music is left to score composer John Debney (okay, but
unmemorable) and the songwriting tandem of lyricist Sting and composer
David Hartley (whose two numbers feel jarringly out of place in the
otherwise non-musical film).
     Not exactly the stuff of which Disney animated "classics" are made,
at least until the voice actors get to strut their stuff. David Spade
provides the perfect petulant, all-about-me vibe for Kuzco, though it
certainly helps to be in tune with Spade's typical caustic sense of humor.
As the villainous Yzma, Eartha Kitt growls her role with such delicious
malevolence it boggles the mind that she has never been cast as a Disney
animated villain before. But the real show-stopper is Warburton's Kronk,
one of those essentially decent lunkhead sidekicks who eventually do
their evil bosses more harm than good. The part is a familiar one, but
Warburton delivers his lines with such a combination of deadpan idiocy and
absolute sincerity that nearly every syllable out of Kronk's mouth is
hilarious. Screenwriter David Reynolds provides some clever dialogue, but
it's not nearly as good as the people who bring it to life.
     The one weak link in the cast is Goodman, though it's not really his
fault. Pacha is as personality-impaired a character as Disney has created
in a long time for a central role (okay, probably since POCAHONTAS). He's
not exactly the hero, not exactly the comic relief -- he's just the big,
good-natured guy necessary to move the plot along. Considering the
relative blandness of the plot itself, there are all kinds of reasons to
suspect that THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE should have been a dud.
Congratulations to Spade, Kitt and Warburton -- and to the casting
director -- for giving the film the spark the rest of the creative team
couldn't quite manage.

PLOT:
A stuck-up emperor with an evil advisor gets turned into a lama after some
of his selfish behavior gets out of hand. Stuck in the middle of the jungle,
the great leader must ask for assistance from a lowly peasant. The duo
attempt to get back to the palace, so that the emperor could be returned to
his former self.
CRITIQUE:
Not as ambitious as many of Disney's other animation flicks, but definitely
one of its funniest. It's not the animation that will blow anyone away with
this movie, it's actually very basic, and it's not the music or the score,
both of which are also very standard. It's the four lead characters that are
a blast and despite a ho-hum story, the charm and humor built into these
characters, draws you in and allows you to have a mucho good time! First
there's David Spade, perfectly cast as the sarcastic emperor with an
attitude to kill. No doubt that Spade used some of his own improvisational
skills to make this character even more cold-hearted (Bu-bye!). The
commoner, voiced by John Goodman, a great ying to Spade's yang. A nice guy
with a cute family to whom anyone should be able to relate. Not an
over-the-top character, but one with enough morals to balance the lack
thereof in Spade's emperor. A great straight man. There's also the evil
Yzma, who actually plays out a complete person, with humor, thoughtfulness
and more than the usual one dimension. And the best surprise of all, and
easily the second funniest character after the lead, Kronk, the dumb-guy
side-kick, who looks exactly like Bruce Campbell from the EVIL DEAD movies,
and delivers many of the film's most uproarious lines. I just couldn't help
but laugh at everything that this guy did and said. They could make a movie
out of this guy alone!
The film also includes plenty of pratfalls for the kids (a la Road Runner),
sarcastic adult remarks for the parents joining the young ones in the
theatres and no musical interludes at any point...yes, that's right, no one
breaks out into a Broadway tune every five minutes. There's also a
self-referential narration by the lead character that works and is original.
Very unexpected to see a Disney film being stopped halfway by a character
wanting to make a point about something. Funny shtuff. The film doesn't have
any major action scenes either, but the last twenty minutes should give
everyone a hoot and a holler to take home. And it's like I said earlier,
very little ambition in this movie. The story is a very simple one, the
emperor gets turned into a lama and he now wants to get back to the palace
to return to his old self, end of story. But every other line in the film is
laced with sarcasm or dry wit and I just love that kind of humor. This film
may definitely not be for everyone, much like Spade's own humor, but I
certainly thought it was worthy of its quick 75 minute runtime. Go with the
kids, I doubt that you'll regret it. Not a classic, not a keeper but
definitely a very funny movie with great new characters. The title still
stinks though.

Director Mark Dindal (Cat's Don't Dance) and the animation gurus at Disney 
bring us the holiday entry of The Emperor's New Groove, which is, simply put, 
the best animated film in years. Groove succeeds where Disney films as of 
late have not: Its emphasis is on character development and storyline, rather 
than the appearance of the animation itself.  Unlike 1999's Tarzan and this 
past summer's Dinosaur, Disney's The Emperor's New Groove holds the potential 
to go down as one of Disney's more accomplished films and possibly come to be 
considered an animated classic.  
David Spade brings his sarcastic antics to the film's central character,  the 
self-absorbed, selfish, Emperor Kuzco, who we're told by a poor old man (who 
fell victim to his Emperor's harsh ways) has a "groove," the way in which 
everything in his self-indulgent world works.  Kuzco has recently fired the 
wicked Yzma (voiced by Eartha Kitt), who, in return, along with her ignorant 
right-hand man Kronk (voiced by Patrick Warburton), vows to seek sweet 
revenge.  But Yzma's original hope to poision the Emperor's drink at dinner 
takes an unpredictable turn when Kronk accidentally replaces the poision with 
a potion, and as a result the Emperor is magically transformed into a llama.  
Meanwhile, the llama-herding Pacha (voiced by John Goodman), who previously 
was informed by the Emperor that his hilltop village would be demolished and 
replaced with his summer resort, unknowingly brings the llama/emperor home 
when Kronk idiotically misplaces the bag in which the transformed Kuzco is 
unconscious.  From here, Pacha and Kuzco form an unlikely, unpredictable, and 
unsteady friendship as Pacha agrees to take Kuzco back to the palace, but 
only under one condition: The Emperor must build his summer resort elsewhere. 
 But all does not go smoothly-Kuzco has not yet been cured of his 
snobbishness, and Yzma will not relent in her hope to have the Emperor 
killed.  
Jonathan Roberts and David Reynolds pen The Emperor's New Groove full of wit, 
intelligence, and a sophisticated yet simple storyline with plenty of twists 
and turns to keep the action rolling onscreen.  The morals and lessons 
Roberts and Reynolds fill Groove with are certainly nothing we haven't seen 
before, but for parents looking for a film that will entertain their children 
and quite possibly teach them a lesson or two in friendship and in life, the 
film is more than adequate.    
John Goodman's vocals make for a warm and affectionate protagonist, David 
Spade cleverly shapes his character much like the stereotype a fan of Spade 
would associate the comedic actor with, Patrick Warburton brings big laughs 
to his dumbbell of a character, and Eartha Kitt is sharp and biting as Yzma, 
making for an easily despicable, fun villainess. 
The animation's smooth, vivid colors highlight the vast and majestic 
settings, effectively setting the lively onscreen mood.  
Containing enough gags to hold the interest of younger children, presenting 
numerous pop culture references that will humor teenagers, and holding plenty 
of tongue-in-cheek comedy at which parents will laugh but find zooming right 
over their children's heads, Groove has something to offer to all ages.  The 
film's only shortcoming is: With a swift running time of 75 minutes 
(obviously to suit the short attention span of younger audiences), it all 
ends too soon. 
THE BOTTOM LINE: With the impressive Emperor's New Groove, Disney shows that 
after a long hiatus, it truly does have its groove back.

Susan Granger's review of 'THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE" (Disney)
 If Walt Disney were to wander into the multiplex tonight,
he'd wonder which studio did this animated film. Unlike what's come to
be known as the Mouse House formula (or rut, depending on your point
of view), there's only one or two songs and no romantic subplot. The
story begins with a lonely, braying llama being drenched by rain in
Peru. Only he's not an ordinary llama. He's actually Kuzco (voiced by
David Spade), once the ruler of a pre-Colombian empire, who was
accidentally transformed by his scheming, malevolent advisor Yzma
(growling Eartha Kitt). Her dim-witted, muscular assistant, Kronk
(Patrick Warburton), was supposed to kill him. Instead, he escaped in
the back of a cart belonging to Pacha, a good-natured, hulking peasant
(John Goodman), his pregnant wife Chica (Wendy Malick) and five
daughters whose village Kuzco had intended to raze to build a vacation
resort. The adventure revolves around the emotional maturation of the
not-quite-18 year-old selfish, sarcastic, obnoxious Kuzco as he tries
to find an antidote for the llama spell and hoofs his way back to the
palace with Pacha to claim his rightful throne. Written by David
Reynolds from a story by Chris Williams and director Mark Dindal, it's
basically a buddy comedy and the quips are jazzy and hip, like "Your
department is being downsized" and "We're not picking up your option."
Reportedly, Sting and David Hartley composed a full musical score but
what remains is "Perfect World," sung by Tom Jones, and "My Funny
Friend and Me." On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The Emperor's
New Groove" is a lively, swingin' 7. Curiously, it shares the same
historical setting as "The Road to El Dorado."

Aside from Pixar's Toy Story 2 and A Bug's Life, Disney's animation arm
hasn't produced anything to crow about in the last couple of years.
With The Emperor's New Groove, things may be turning around for the
studio.  Perhaps the improvement can be traced to the attempts of Fox,
DreamWorks and Warner Bros. to muscle in on the turf that has been
exclusively theirs for so long.  Maybe it's because Groove doesn't put
the film's animation technique ahead of its story, like it did with
Dinosaur and Tarzan.  Or, quite possibly, it's just a fluke.
What we do know is that Groove was originally called Kingdom of the Sun
and was created around a half-dozen songs penned and performed by
Sting.  The film had the typical Disney romantic subplot, the stock
antagonist, the obligatory wacky sidekick and enough talking animals to
shake a stick at. In other words, it was just like every other goddamn
animated feature the Mouse House has ever produced.  But here comes the
surprising part  Disney scrapped most of the story, the romantic angle
and almost all of Sting's songs.  The result is the first straight-out
Disney comedy to come along in a long, long time.
David Spade (Just Shoot Me) provides the voice of Emperor Kuzco, the
young ruler of a kingdom that extends as far as the eye can see.  To say
Kuzco is conceited would be an understatement, and this point is driven
home in the film's opening scene.  Kuzco dances around his castle (to
Sting's "Perfect World," sung by Tom Jones) but is interrupted by one of
his villagers.  In a scene straight out of Braveheart, Kuzco tosses the
man out the window for throwing off his "groove."  A few moments later,
Kuzco tells another villager (John Goodman, Normal, Ohio) he's being
evicted from a piece of property that has been in his family for
hundreds of years  just so the Emperor can build a summer retreat
called "Kuzco-topia."
Kuzco also has an advisor named Yzma (Eartha Kitt), who hatches a plan
to bump off her boss and take over his throne.  Together with her big,
dumb assistant, Kronk (Patrick Warburton, Putty from Seinfeld), Yzma
tries to poison Kuzco but succeeds only in turning the ruler into a
llama.  The newly cloven-hoofed Kuzco is put in a sack and dropped in
the river, where he meets up with Pacha, the villager he just evicted.
The two begin the long journey back to Kuzco's castle, meeting various
adversities along the way.
It would be one thing to have a Disney film devoid of songs, or missing
a time-consuming love story, but to have both in the same picture is
almost too good to be true.  Groove also features a funny cross-dressing
scene (a must for any decent comedy, I suppose) and nods to, among
others, Fantasia and The Fly.  But, best of all, it's smart, funny and
will be equally enjoyable for adults and children.
Groove is narrated by Spade's character, and the first half of the film
is told via flashback (including two occasions where his Kuzco
interrupts the story when it's not about him).  The technique wouldn't
have worked without Spade (the same way High Fidelity would have been
awful without John Cusack).  There was some concern that Spade's Kuzco
wouldn't have the same snarky bite we're used to from the pint-sized
comedian, but he's just as snide here as he has been anywhere else
(thanks to the script from Toy Story/Bug's Life writer David Reynolds).
Kitt's voice produces one of the most memorable Disney villains in quite
some time.  Her Yzma is a cross between Madame Medusa from The Rescuers
and the original (read: animated) Cruella De Vil.  Goodman's voice is
very subdued here, which is a welcome surprise if you've seen his new
television show.  His animated wife is voiced by yet another sitcom star
(Spade's Just Shoot Me co-star, Wendie Malick), showing that Disney
spared no expense for the film's voice talent, which is absent any
feature-film stars.
In case you didn't notice, Groove features the voices of two current and
one former player in NBC's powerful "Must See TV" Thursday night lineup
(Spade and Malick, and Seinfeld's Warburton).  What's stranger is that
these three are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Disney
raiding television's most popular evening for voice talent.  Remember ER
stars Julianna Margulies and Ming-Na Wen (Dinosaur and Mulan,
respectively)?  How about Warburton's fellow Seinfeld co-workers Jason
Alexander (The Hunchback of Notre Dame) and Wayne Knight (Tarzan and Toy
Story 2).  Even Hercules was voiced by Tate Donovan, who, at the time,
was playing Rachel's boyfriend on Friends.
Next up: Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Jerry Seinfeld in The Beauty and the
Beast 2.

I cringed while watching the first trailer for Disney's animated
feature, "The Emperor's New Groove." The title was dreadful, sounding
like something concocted by a grandmother trying to be hip. Then there
was the art. When I was little, there were two kind of cartoons: the
cutesy-pie, parent-friendly Disney stuff and the edgier, anti-authority
Warner Brothers fare. The drawings in the "Emperor" commercial looked
like they were stolen from a latter day, cut-rate Warner Brothers
feature. But what really got me was the voice of the lead character. It
only took one word for my internal alarm bells to go off as I recognized
the smug tones of David Spade.
David Spade, the sarcastic troll from "Saturday Night Live." David
Spade, the smarmy creep who periodically appeared on "Weekend Update"
doing commentary on Hollywood figures, taking cheap shots at easy
targets  as if the talent-impaired twerp was in a position to pass
judgment on anybody. David Spade, who dared to strut around acting
superior in Chris Farley movies before making "Lost & Found," his own
wretched feature film. How can there be atheists in a world where David
Spade parleys snideness into a career, thus offering proof that there
truly is a Devil who trade favors for souls?
I went into the screening of "The Emperor's New Groove" expecting the
worst, but emerged with a smile. By Disney standards, the art is weak.
The drawing style and comic sensibilities are indeed ripped off from
Warner Brothers. And David Spade is in virtually every one of the
production's 79 minutes. But despite it all, "The Emperor's New Groove"
is fun, almost solely due to inspired casting of the voices behind the
drawings, including, much as I hate to admit it, David Spade.
The project went through major changes. Originally titled "Kingdom of
the Sun," it was to have been a typically lavish Disney musical, a grand
romantic comedy in which the emperor was but a supporting player.
Somewhere along the developmental course, the production lost its main
concept, lead characters and a handful of songs by Sting (a couple of
his tunes remain; one at the beginning and the other over the closing
credits).
The revised version tells a simple tale. Kuzco (Spade), the bratty,
arrogant young emperor of an Inca-like empire, is targeted for
assassination by his advisor, the wicked Yzma (Eartha Kitt). But Yzma
and Kronk (Patrick Warburton), her chronically preoccupied assistant,
grab the wrong bottle and, instead of poisoning their leader, they turn
him into a llama. Kuzco runs for his life and ends up with Pacha (John
Goodman), a gentle soul from a peasant village. Due to his belief in the
goodness of the human heart, Pacha agrees to help Kuzco avoid Yzma,
return to the castle and regain his throne.
The film starts off slow, with Spade oozing sarcasm during a torturous
opening monologue. In stark contrast to most Disney offerings, the
drawings feature almost no background details. As a result, the
characters initially come off like figures doing stand-up comedy on an
animated stage (Oddly enough, just as I noted the production's broad,
Las Vegas feel, one of the film's two songs began, crooned by none other
than Tom Jones). In addition to the lack of background details, the
empire is also noticeably underpopulated. Including soldiers and
villagers, I counted less than thirty people in the whole movie. Perhaps
the bulk of the population recognized the voice of their leader and
moved.
After the set-up and song, the production soon turns into a buddy
comedy, with Kuzco and Pacha squabbling and then bonding, while Yzma and
Kronk try to track them down. Most of the slapstick works, although the
writers toss in two ancient, unwelcome gags about male intimacy, one
involving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, the other a simple hug. Both
times, two guys get close, then panic and bolt away from each other,
muttering macho phrases while skittering about nervously. Not only do
the jokes reinforce homophobia, but they are also lame recreations of
the legendary pillow scene in "Planes, Trains and Automobiles."
Thankfully, the casting is light years better than those scenes. As the
cruel, immature emperor Kuzco, Spade is, of course, perfect. John
Goodman, meanwhile, lends his warm, deep tones to the gentle giant
Pacha. Because of the character's innocent nature, Goodman gets
relatively few one-liners, but he proves a welcome balm to Spade's
acidity.
As is the norm in cartoons, the villains get the best lines. Eartha Kitt
is excellent as the wicked Yzma, upping the metallic edge of her voice
to great effect, managing to give even her quietest line readings the
sense of a coiled snake ready to strike. But even the remarkable Eartha
gets upstaged by Patrick Warburton, who casually steals the movie as
Kronk, a lovable henchman more interested in emulating Martha Stewart
than doing evil. Warburton delighted audiences as David Puddy on
"Seinfeld" and corporate-shark-turned-hobo Johnny Johnson on
"NewsRadio," and he underplays his lines here beautifully. The man has a
unique gift for comedy and is destined for greatness.
Disney clearly invested little effort on "The Emperor's New Groove," but
the film is still a minor success, courtesy of Warburton, Kitt, Goodman
and Spade. If the movie turns out to be a hit, I hope the company is
smart enough to send large bonus checks to the foursome. And if they
decide to give each of the others a bigger cut than Spade, that's fine
with me too.

     What would the holiday season be without a new animated film
from Disney?  This outing rather than taking some classic story and
inaccurately making it into a film, they have taken their own story
setting it in Peru vaguely sometime before Columbus came to the New
World.  The Emperor Kuzco (voiced by Saturday Night Live veteran
David Spade) has been particularly cruel to a well-meaning lug of a
peasant Pacha (John Goodman). Kuzco may not have a shred of meanness
in his body but the also does not have a scrap of empathy or
kindness.  What does have is an ambitious and evil adviser, Yzma
(the great Eartha Kitt).  Yzma tries to poison Kuzco in order to
take his place but instead accidentally turns him into a llama and
then loses him.  Kuzco find himself alone and friendless except for
the peasant he has mistreated.  He finds it a rocky friendship but
one he comes to depend on.
     As Disney animated films go this is not the best, but
definitely not the worst.  The script does not go into the
characters as much as it might, choosing instead to keep the script
denser in humor.  Wait long enough and the relationship between
Kuzco and Pacha will become surprisingly touching.  The choice of
setting is one that has rarely been used for film and one that the
younger members of the audience might not immediately recognize or
understand.  It may provide a good opportunity for parents to give
their children a history lesson, if indeed the parents understand it
themselves.  Of course the history must not be taken too seriously
either.  The script mixes its cultures a little too much having in
one scene a Mexican piata party.  One of Sting's forgettable songs
incorrectly refers to this part of the world as "Meso-America."
John Goodman is a little large and plump to play an Inca.  Incas
were probably short and certainly not heavy.  The script manages to
avoid having anything larger than a ladybug die in the course of the
story.  The most frightening scenes are not of violence, but of
dangers of falling from great heights.  Then again, this is Peru and
you expect great altitudes.  The religious right may object to a
usually likable gay character, even if he is the conflicted henchman
of the villain.  Those who would ban books like Harry Potter and THE
WIZARD OF OZ may be unhappy that magic has an effect in this film;
though they may take consolation in that it seems never to be the
effect intended.
     This film does push what were at least of few years ago limits.
For most of the film Pacha's wife is noticeably pregnant.  And in
spite of the fact she seems content to be what we would call "a
housewife," she proves herself more than match for some powerful
baddies.  Most of Disney's best villains have been women so they
have never held back from allowing women to be villains, though
usually they are uglier and older women and this film is not really
an exception.  The corpulent hero is, however, something of a change
for Disney.
     For once the animation techniques do not run away with the
show.  There are no scenes that are anywhere near a breath-taking as
the opening of THE LION KING.  Most of the animation seems fairly
flat and old-fashioned.  This is Mark Dindal's second outing as
director.  His previous effort was CATS DON'T DANCE for Turner
Broadcasting.  He did previously direct for Disney the animation
sequences for the under-rated THE ROCKETEER.  The music is by John
Debney and David Hartley.  Sting wrote the songs and is apparently
unhappy that some of his songs were dropped.  He might have a point.
The songs dropped could easily have been better than the boring
place-holder songs that were not dropped.  At least I think they
were boring place-holder songs, admittedly not much about the songs
comes to my mind at the moment.  When Disney Studios said that they
mourned the loss of Alan Menken, it was with only the best of
reasons.

_The_Emperor's_New_Groove_ (G) *** (out of ****)
With Disney's 38th animated feature, _The_Emperor's_New_Groove_, come
two distinct perceptions.  The title's nontraditional inclusion of a
slang term and the film's no-frills art style could be read as reflective
of a general attitude: looser, wilder, hipper--a brazen new direction for
the usually staid House of Mouse.  Then there's the less forgiving point
of view, which takes into account the film's turbulent path to the
screen.  Originally conceived as a DreamWorks-style epic musical drama
called _Kingdom_of_the_Sun_, the film morphed into its current tune-free
incarnation when the concept was completely overhauled after a third of
the film had already been completely animated; _Groove_'s lean running
time and lack of a big animation showpiece--a staple of modern Disney
'toons--would lend support to the thought of the end product as one big
rush job.
After seeing _Groove_, I'd say both sides of the argument hold water. 
Coming off of the heels of the technological breakthroughs of last year's
_Tarzan_, this film's scaled-down visual style cannot help but be a
letdown; also, the story is even more threadbare than one is used to,
even by family film standards.  That said, there's no denying the energy
and joy present in this zippy tale, and the film's genial, unpretentious
nature--not to mention sharp wit--are what will win over the most cynical
viewer.
Its rocky production history aside, _Groove_ faces a major hurdle from
the outset, a problem it never completely overcomes: the voice casting of
its lead character, Kuzco.  The film's original title,
_Kingdom_of_the_Sun_, figures into the retooled story as a basic
description of the arrogant and materialistic South American emperor's
dream project: a sun-drenched mountain-top retreat/monument-to-self whose
construction means bulldozing the homes of many villagers--in particular,
honorable peasant Pacha (voiced by John Goodman), his wife (Wendie
Malick), and their children.  So by basic story design, Kuzco is a pretty
obnoxious character, and the casting of famously acerbic ex-_SNL_'er
David Spade would appear to be spot-on.  However, it proves to be _too_
perfect; anyone familiar with his work knows that when he plays an
asshole, he plays the role to the smarmy, one-dimensional extreme, with
absolutely no trace of latent sincerity or humanity.  As one would
expect, _Groove_'s basic arc is the bratty young ruler's gradual
discovery of some sense of compassion, and with Spade cranked to maximum,
irredeemable abrasion from frame one, the ultimate transition isn't
believable.  Even worse, it's impossible to care if he changes--both in
terms of personality and physical appearance, for his conniving,
magic-dabbling advisor Yzma (Eartha Kitt) transforms him into... a llama.
That plot point shows how director Mark Dindal and writing collaborators
Chris Williams and David Reynolds are able to make this _Groove_ an
ultimately smooth one: reckless comic abandon.  The llama-fied Kuzco ends
up teaming with the goodhearted Pacha to return to the royal palace and
reclaim his throne, and during their big road trip, the two get into a
number of very funny comic predicaments--that is, when they're not
engaging in some inspired verbal sparring.  Not every gag works--a
slapsticky scene in which the pair try to evade Yzma and her lunkheaded
servant Kronk (voiced to scene-stealing perfection by Patrick Warburton)
in a restaurant particularly reeks of sitcom--but the duds are a
tolerable tradeoff for antic highlights such as the chain reaction of
calamity that results when Kuzco and Pacha walk across an unsteady rope
bridge.  Dindal and company also use the gaps and inconsistencies in the
plot to their advantage, using them to spin cleverly self-effacing jokes.
Given its lightweight nature, _The_Emperor's_New_Groove_ won't be
recognized as one of Disney's crowning animated achievements; the years
will be especially cruel to the very of-its-time title.  What matters,
however, is the here and now, and despite obvious shortcomings, this
rollicking ride will have no trouble getting viewers of all ages to feel
its groove.

I'll be the first to admit I didn't expect much from The Emperor's New
Groove: More Celine Dion-esque song-and-dance numbers, cuddly characters
that become cross-promotion devices in McDonald's Happy Meals, and
Hollywood stars trying to gain credibility by adding a voice-over job to
their resume.
I was dead wrong about all of those things.
The Emperor's New Groove is funny.  Damn funny.  And the cute characters
in the film are the dangerous ones.  The script is fast and furious,
with no singing and dancing.  The animation is clean and would give Walt
a warm feeling all over.  The humor is dry and aimed at both the
cynicism and the goodness in all of us.  The story is ridiculously weird
and comes off as a strange acid trip involving talking, cross-dressing
llamas and schizophrenia.
Here's the plot; try to follow along.  Set in a mythical kingdom, the
film follows the adventures of Kuzco (David Spade), an arrogant and
egocentric emperor.  When Kuzco fires his power-hungry advisor, Yzma
(Eartha Kitt), she and her "assistant" Kronk (Seinfeld's Patrick
Warburton) change him into a llama.  Kuzco then gets stranded in the
jungle and must rely on Pacha (John Goodman), a llama-herder whose home
was to be replaced by Kuzco's Water World Theme Park, to save him.  Then
the fun starts.
For the next sixty minutes, the audience is treated to something unheard
of in Disney films these days: Imagination.  Yzma, voiced by the
talented singer Eartha Kitt, looks like a cross between Norma Desmond,
Joan Crawford, and a really old Vegas showgirl.  The dialogue between
her and her oblivious assistant Kronk is quick, sharp, and feels like an
episode of Seinfeld (which would make sense).  David Spade and John
Goodman's character interactions make you feel like you're watching an
old Hope/Crosby film.  Spade is beyond dry with his humor and shoots
below the belt on several occasions, and I laughed out loud several
times.  Needless to say, that is an extremely rare thing in Disney
screenings these days.
The best part about The Emperor's New Groove is how audacious the film
is.  The sheer weirdness factor is very high.  Cross-dressing,
schizophrenia, duality of soul, people being turned into every animal on
Noah's boat, llama CPR, homoerotic tendencies, an Emperor with his own
theme song and singer, Michael Jackson dance moves, and a guy that can
communicate with a squirrel are only a few of the oddities that make the
film a true orginal.
Simply put, The Emperor's New Groove is one of the best children's films
out for this holiday season.  Kids will enjoy the adventures, and
parents will enjoy the story and dialogue.  That's a tough thing to pull
off in a single package, but this Emperor manages to do it.

18-year old Emperor Kuzco (David Spade) is an arrogant, egocentric and
selfish young ruler whose philosophy on the lives of his subjects is "don't
know, don't care." Kuzco is so interested in himself and his own pleasures
he doesn't have a clue that his new summer home, Kuzcotopia, will displace
a caring and kindly peasant, Pacha (John Goodman), and his family.
Meanwhile, wicked advisor Yzma (Eartha Kitt) has her own designs on the
throne and turns the unsuspecting monarch into a llama. It's up to Kuzco
and Pacha to restore him to his human form, return him to the throne and
thwart Yzma's plans in Disney's latest animated feature, "The Emperor's New
Groove."
The one word that jumped into my head after seeing the latest in Disney's
long, long line of animated films is "serviceable." The history behind the
creation of "The Emperor's New Groove" goes back to 1994 when the project
was called "Kingdom of the Sun," a dramatic story inspired by pre-Colombian
legend. As the development process moved along, the tone of the project
changed from the serious to the silly. With the original dramatic intent
taken away, the film became a light comedy with state-of-the-art animations
and an insubstantial story, though a cute one.
Emperor K is a spoiled brat whose own wants and needs are first and
foremost in his mind. He summons peasant Pacha to the palace to inquire
about the beautiful hilltop where Pacha and his family live. Pacha assures
his master that his hill is so special, it makes music. This sounds so
good, Kuzco decides that his newest palace, with pool, will be built there
and tells Pacha to move. The despondent, but loyal, peasant heads home to
break the bad news to his pregnant wife, Chicha (Wendie Malick), and five
daughters.
As Kuzco blithely makes his plans, his ancient and conniving advisor, Yzma,
has delusions of grandeur of her own. The wicked counselor has, for years,
used her exalted status to insinuate herself into a position of power. When
the self-centered Kuzco, putting his own selfish desires aside for a
moment, realizes that Yzma is usurping his throne, he fires her on the
spot. But, since only Kuzco, Yzma and her loyal henchman, Kronk (Patrick
Warburton), know about the dismissal, she decides the best course of action
is to poison the egotistical sovereign and take over his kingdom. The plans
go awry from the start when Kronk gives Kuzco extract of llama instead of a
poison cocktail.
Kuzco, now a talking llama, has no choice but to enlist the help of Pacha
in getting back to the palace and changing back to human form. Meanwhile,
Yzma, realizing that Kronk could not kill the llama king (Kronk is your
basic nice guy), heads out with her muscle-bound assistant to finish the
job herself. It becomes a race against time and nature as Kuzco and Pacha
must brave fierce crocodiles, deadly scorpions and startled bats in their
journey to the castle. It is also an odyssey of change for Kuzco as the
selfish boy-king learns the value of friendship and generosity and becomes
a good man and better emperor in the end.
As Disney animations go you can see the force of skilled animators at work
beneath the surface of the movie. Visually the characters are finely honed
caricatures as they represent simple human virtues and flaws. The emperor,
as voiced by Spade, is really a spoiled brat, used to getting what he wants
whenever he wants. Good or bad, this self-centered attitude lasts through
most of the film, changing only when the final climax looms. The
selfishness and smart-ass attitude given the character by Spade gets tired
after a while. Fortunately, his one-liners, peppered through the film, help
get you by the rotten little kid aspect of Kuzco.
John Goodman is one of the serviceable aspects of the film, as is Eartha
Kitt. Goodman's Pacha is a big-hearted, good-natured peasant who loves to
give to those around him. It's rather inevitable, with such a companion by
his side, that Kuzco is going to learn some valuable, life-affirming
lessons. Kitt gets a low-rent version of Cruella DeVil to play with and
does a decent job breathing life into the old crone that wants the throne.
Stealing the show, though, is Patrick Warburton as the lovable Kronk. The
amiable big guy (he's a size 66 long with a 31-inch waist) is more
interested in the quality of his cooking than in his henchman's duties.
He's particularly proud of his spinach puffs, truth be known. Warburton and
his animation team and writers create a funny, likeable character that is
supposed to be bad but can't be. After all, he was a Junior Chipmunk as a
kid and learned how to talk to squirrels, so how bad can he be. Beyond the
four leads, though, there is little background activity for minor
characters, giving the film a flat feel.
The animation processes used here are the epitome of the quality that we
expect to come out of Disney Studios. There isn't any breakthrough
development as was the case with the "deep canvas" process developed from
"Tarzan," but the creators of "The Emperor's New Groove" utilize every tool
at their disposal to create a fine visual work. The combination of the
animation and, again I say, the serviceable vocal and writing talents
involved help create a light bit of comedy entertainment that will please
all ages, but won't make a lasting impression.
Animation director Mark Dindal co-wrote the story with screenwriter David
Reynolds. They succeed in making a Disney-lite effort that is fast-talking
and very, very hip - mainly due to Spade's chatter and Kronk's likableness.
It fills the bill for the holidays and will keep the kids quiet and adults
entertained. In the end, "The Emperor's New Groove" is a popcorn movie. I
give it a B-.

"This story is about Me! ... I was a really nice guy and they ruined me 
for no reason," David Spade begins his reign over this Disney film from 
the get-go and never lets go. 
Changed into a llama by Yzma, his wicked Grinchy-looking advisor, the 
emperor is forced to come to terms with his total lack of heart. In 
stark contrast, John Goodman, as the big-hearted Pacha, makes an 
unlikely partner in the emperor's attempt to reclaim the thrown. 
Hey, this is a really funny movie! (And I'm a few years older than five) 
Spade's wry, dry, whiny, biting edge vibrates against the expected 
smooth gloss of Disney paint ... it'll set your funny bone resonating. 
Kudos to the director, editor, and screenwriter as well, though Spade is 
definitely the star of this show (as Carrey in the Grinch); this film 
still packs plenty of well-timed physical humor and a healthy supply of 
delightful one-liners from other characters. 
Kronk, Yzma's kid-spirited sensitive-male thug, delivers a host of juicy 
gags. Yzma orders, "Kronk, break down that door!"
Kronk narrow's his eyes, "What? Are you kidding? That's hand-carved 
mahogany." 
A nervous villager stands before Yzma.
Yzma barks, "It's no concern of mine that your family doesn't have ... 
what was it again ... food?"
The villager mutters something inaudible.
Yzma finishes, "Yes, well you really should have thought about that 
before you became a peasant." 
Toward making Emperor Kuzco even more vain (and since the story is told 
by him), other character's dialogue sort of blurs into blah blah as they 
fall victim to his short attention span and gross lack of empathy. A 
very nice touch. And then as a Llama, Kuzco stumbles clumsily around on 
his new hoofs -- strong creative insight to thicken this already rich 
character. 
The film's only flaws are consolidated into one unfunny jungle 
restaurant scene that plays like a bad 1960's sit-com. It's an ugly 
blemish that is soon enough over and done with. 
In sum, the emperor's jaded, Spaded, jagged-edge of vanity cuts a sharp 
b-line to the jugular. Though small tikes may miss some of these satiric 
nuances, the film still stocks a powerful momentum. At about an hour 
fifteen, it's smaller in length while decidedly passing on the usual 
Disney animation grandeur (not a one character ever breaks into song); 
still this is a pretty darned fun and funnier film.
