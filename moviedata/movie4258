"To Hell and Back" held the honor of being Universal Studio's
top grossing film for twenty years, until surpassed by "Jaws".
While largely forgotten today, it is easy to see why the
film was so hugely successful.
Audie Murphy plays himself as World War II's most decorated
soldier.  Unfailingly self-effacing, polite, heroic and
courageous, Murphy makes up for his lack of physical stature
by always doing the right thing in battle.  Murphy's
all-american boy role model fit the 1950s era perfectly,
back when it was wise not to question the U.S. Government.
Murphy is a competent actor.  It is true that when he is
supposed to be angry, he merely shouts, and when he is
supposed to be tender, he merely talks more quietly.  He
lacks emotional commitment to his role, despite playing
a perfect version (at least in the eyes of the Army) of 
himself.  Still, his earnest demeanor and slew of earned
decorations give him credibility.
Murphy has problems when acting with women.  He is polite
and passive, and has only one brief romantic scene, with
a woman gentle enough to help him along.  This may explain
Murphy's career as an action hero more than as a romantic
lead.
Murphy's army buddies all seem interchangeable after a
while.  They shoulder their burdens with only witty and
well-crafted jabs, never whining or threatening.  One has
the feeling that the U.S. Army had an eye on the script
as a condition of their support during filming.
"To Hell and Back" is not a particularly realistic depiction 
of WWII battles from a soldier's point of view, since the
battles serve merely to depict Murphy's heroism.  But the
film does accurately reflect an idealization of WWII
as viewed by Americans during the 1950s.
