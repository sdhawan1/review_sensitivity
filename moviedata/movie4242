     Having seen only one episode of the 1960's television series, and
only a part of it at that, I came into this movie with very little by
way of preconceptions.  Of course, the basic premise is famous: a
respected doctor, Dr. Richard Kimble, is sentenced to die for the
murder of his wife which he did not commit.  After escaping in a bus
accident, Detective Sam Gerard (in the movie, converted to U.S.
Marshall) becomes obsessed with his recapture while Kimble searches for
the one armed man seen at the scene of the crime.
     But that's about all this movie has in common with the television
show.  For one, this is a full-fledged murder mystery as Kimble takes
on his own investigation as to who murdered his wife and why.
Secondly, the movie format limits the story to basically a chase/murder
mystery, whereas the series was known for the different situations
Kimble would find himself in week after week.  There is one instance in
the movie where Kimble stops long enough to help someone else out (as
was the main focus in the series) which was a small tribute to the
spirit of the series, but the 2+ hour length does not allow for more.
     The film is a fast-paced, well structured chase movie which asks
you to stretch the imagination at points, but never fails to be
enjoyable.  There are times where the tension becomes almost tangible
as our hero struggles to stay one step ahead of the law.
     The biggest departure from the series comes in the character of
Deputy Samuel Gerard.  Whereas the series' character was clearly the
bad guy who's obsession on capturing Kimble makes him thoroughly hated
by the audience, the film's Gerard comes off as just cop trying to get
his man.  At times he seems almost too glib, but his one-liners bring a
comic relief in contrast to Kimble's almost lack of dialog.  Of course,
this Gerard is portrayed as much more competent than the series'
Gerard; after all, he captured Kimble after two hours whereas it took
the other Kimble seven years!
     For fans of the old series, be prepared.  THE FUGITIVE is a
thoroughly updated and modern version of the series, definitively set
in our time, complete with 911, cellular phones, and bullet-proof glass
doors.  And if you've seen the final episode of the series, do not
fear.  The resolution with the one armed man is completely different
than the one portrayed in the series.  Clearly, this movie will
continuously be compared with its television namesake, but the nature
of the movie is entirely different.  This is a smart, intelligent chase
movie that keeps your eyes glued to the screen.  Harrison Ford once
again proves himself to be the thinking man's action hero as he manages
to go from scrape to scrape, barely managing to get himself out of each
new jam.  Tommy Lee Jones provides the perfect foil and his face to
face encounters with Ford are among the most gripping of the film.

     It was easy to fear the worst.  Begin with a classic 1960's
television series, add a big budget and an A-list star in the lead
role, and stir.  Script, you ask?  Who needs one, kid ... we've got
ourselves a formula.
     That was my fear: a bloated monster without any sense of
direction.  Then, much to my amazement, everything that could possibly
go wrong ... didn't.
     THE FUGITIVE is as lean, taut and tense as anything the action
genre has produced in the last several years.  Under the direction of
Andrew Davis (1992's UNDER SIEGE), THE FUGITIVE grips you by the throat
from the outset and never lets go.  Expect box office to go through the
roof, deservedly, and expect an Academy Award nomination for Tommy Lee
Jones.
     The premise is a simple one.  Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford)
is wrongly convicted for the murder of his wife after struggling with
the real killer, a man with an artificial arm.  After an escape attempt
by some other prisoners during a transfer goes awry, Kimble finds
himself on the run.  His one goal: to find the one-armed man (Andreas
Katsulas) before U. S. Marshall Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) finds
him.
     Where THE FUGITIVE surprises the most is the script, by Jeb Stuart
and David Twohy.  In a genre where one is almost always asked to allow
leaps of logic, the script repeatedly astonished me with its
intelligence, its attention to detail and its respect for the
audience.  In an early sequence, Kimble sneaks into a hospital to shave
of his beard, slick back his hair and change into a lab coat.  On his
way out, a police officer jokingly tells the man he doesn't know is
Kimble to zip up his pants.  It's a small moment, but it punches home
the urgency of Kimble's situation, and exactly what a man concerned
about not being recognized might easily forget.  Later, while trying to
lose himself in a parade, Kimble thinks to drop his overcoat, the most
likely way he'd be recognized from behind.  It's these details which
convince us that when a colleague of Kimble's tells Gerard that he's
too smart to be caught, he may just be right.
     Credit must also be given to the special effects and stunt
coordinators.  The bus crash which allows Kimble's escape is a
spectacular sequence, as is a leap from a dam into the water below.
The action is crisp and brutal, and never romanticized.  Special kudos
go to director Davis for maintaining a relentless pace which
underscores the single-mindedness of the two leads.
     And what a pair of performances those leads are.  Tommy Lee Jones
is nothing short of brilliant as Gerard, because he manages an
incredibly challenging feat.  For the first third of the film, there is
really no *villain* per se; Kimble is on the run, and Gerard is out to
find him.  It would have been very easy to turn Gerard into a
malevolent, vindictive Inspector Javert, but that never happens.
Instead Jones plays him as a sharp, committed man who's just doing his
job, so that when he responds to Kimble's comment, "I didn't kill my
wife," with a matter-of-fact, "I don't care," we know exactly what he
means.  It's not his job to determine guilt or innocence.  It's his job
to bring in a fugitive.  This is a well- written character played with
relish by an actor at the top of his form.
     The only unfortunate thing about Jones' stunning turn is that it's
likely to overshadow Harrison Ford, and that's a shame.  For his entire
career, Ford has been underappreciated as an actor due to his
pigeonholing as an action hero.  However, he does a fine job with the
less flashy part of Kimble, always keeping at the forefront the
advantage this man has because of his intelligence.  THE FUGITIVE could
only work to its fullest if the two protagonists always seemed to be on
equal footing, and Ford is up to the task.
     This summer has been loaded with action/suspense films, and most
of them have been doing brisk business.  However, it's time for Clint,
Sean, and various dinosaurs to step aside.  The chase is on.  My advice
is to catch it.

     This is based on the TV series of the same name, with Harrison
Ford playing the on-the-run doctor, and Tommy Lee Jones as his pursuer.
Briefly, Ford's character is accused and convicted of the brutal murder
of his wife, and escapes while on his way to Death Row to hunt down the
one-armed man who he knows is the real criminal.
     Academy Award nominations all around: for Best Picture, Best
Director, Best Actor, and Best Supporting Actor (there are no
significant women's parts).
     The first half of the movie is a thrilling chase, with great
special effects that really put me on the edge of my seat (in
particular, the train crash beats anything from the Indiana Jones
series). But it is Ford's bewildered intensity and Tommy Lee Jones's
no-nonsence confidence that make this a great film, coupled with the
direction. I loved that moment when Jones catches up with Ford early
on, and you know what Ford's going to do (at least if you've seen the
preview), and he knows it too, and he can't quite believe he's going to
do it but does it anyway.  Or later, when Jones has Ford in his sights
and you just know it's over, but it isn't and at first you (and Ford)
can't believe it, and then it makes so much sense.  This is truly great
cinema, what American films are all about.
     The movie drags towards the end, when a poorly-written script
catches up with the director and forces him to spend time explaining
why the one-armed man did what he did, and to show us two middle-aged
men fighting.  I mean, who cares?  At that point, everything that
matters has been resolved; it would have been better if there had been
one more near encounter earlier on or something, if the movie had to
last a certain length.

**** (out of 4 = excellent)
1993, PG-13, 133 minutes [2 hours, 13 minutes]
[thriller]
starring: Harrison Ford (Dr. Richard Kimble), Tommy Lee Jones (Deputy Sam
Gerard, U.S. Marshall), Joe Pantoliano (Cosmo Renfo), Daniel Roebuck (Biggs),
written by Jeb Stuart, David Twohy, produced by Arnold Kopelson, directed by
Andrew Davis.
"The Fugitive" is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made. It takes
realistic, believable characters and tells an exciting story that's totally
believable throughout. This isn't an over-the-top action flick for the sake
of action, this is an intelligent adventure story with a real sense of
mystery to it and it works perfectly. 
Harrison Ford stars as Dr. Richard Kimble, a man who is wrongly accused and
convicted of murdering his wife. The entire premise of the story revolves
around this murder, but is not told in a straightforward manner. We
constantly see flashbacks to the murder from Kimble's perspective. Hints are
dropped from various times of the night Kimble's wife, Helen (Sela Ward) was
murdered. We don't get to see who the killer is until much further into the
story. In fact, we might even have a little doubt about Kimble's innocence
ourselves.
The film doesn't spend much time on the details of Kimble's trial and
conviction as it is not the point of the story. One of the greatest action
scenes ensues as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which
leads to a fantastic train wreck. But it does not at all seem gratuitous or
formulated, it is actually suspenseful to watch. This movie is so incredible
because it's able to take elements like these and make them wholly original
and believable.
Tommy Lee Jones almost steals the show as Deputy Sam Gerard, a U.S. Marshall
who is an expert in hunting fugitives. From the moment he appears we know a
huge game of cat and mouse is about to occur. Kimble and Gerard are equally
matched as there is no way to tell how one is going to outsmart the other.
Most of the film deals with Richard's complex investigation as he tries to
find the one-armed man who killed his wife. Ford does not have a lot of lines
here, so it is Stuart and Twohy's script and Davis's outstanding direction
that make the film as great as it is. Just watching Richard use his keen
intelligence and wits, disguising himself, and doing his own detective work
is very interesting. We know just as little as he does as to why his wife was
killed, so as he learns more so do we.
Meanwhile Gerard and his staff are using all their skills to hunt him down.
At one point they run into each other and a great chase ensues, but Richard
is just too smart for them. He leaves clues for Gerard to show his innocence
and to help him solve the mystery.
One of the greatest charms to the film is its sense of humor. There is a
great sense of comradeship between Gerard and his two closest deputies Cosmo
Renfo (Pantoliano) and Biggs (Roebuck). They are trying to catch what they
believe to be a dangerous murderer, yet they constantly start up small talk
with each other, making funny wisecracks and one-liners, but not in any kind
of distracting manner.
The final act concludes with another terrific chase. Richard figures out who
the killer is and confronts him, and although we get a typical fight scene,
the case is far from solved. The man who ordered the murder has been under
our nose all along, and we don't realize this until the end when both Richard
and Gerard put the pieces together. Maybe the finally scene is a bit much,
but it still has a believable atmosphere to it. We're so relieved when
justice is served.
It's not the plot is that makes "The Fugitive" great, it's all the motions
the characters go through to make for an intriguing story. Watching a
seemingly average man go through as much as this is what makes the movie so
adventurous. If only Hollywood could produce more movies like this.

     In September 1967 Dr. Richard Kimble found his wife murdered my a one-
armed man who escaped.  Kimble was found guilty of the murder and sentenced
to die.  But as police Lt. Philip Gerard was taking him to prison, the train
they were riding in derailed and Kimble was able to escape.  For three years
Kimble tracked the one-armed man and Gerard tracked Kimble.  Or at least
that was the premise of the television series THE FUGITIVE. that starred
David Janssen and Barry Morse.  THE FUGITIVE is also the name of a fast-
paced new film very loosely based on the twenty-six-year-old television
series.  In fact, the film version owes as much or more to Alfred Hitchcock
thrillers such as THE 39 STEPS, THE SABOTEUR, and NORTH BY NORTHWEST as it
does to the old Quinn-Martin series.  That series, itself intended as a
variation on Victor Hugo's LES MISERABLES, had a leisurely pace which is
just not the style of this tight and tense 127-minutes film.  There is very
little of the "nice guy mixing in people's lives" premise of the television
series in the new film.  The series was light on the murder aspect and the
film has more motivation behind the murder than three years of the
television show had.
     At least superficially, the film has the same premise.  Dr. Richard
Kimble (played by Harrison Ford, apparently still a little befuddled from
the brain injury in REGARDING HENRY) comes home from surgery late one night
to find his wife dead and a one-armed man in his house.  Nobody is
particularly convinced by Kimble's story and he ends up headed for Death
Row.  On the way there is an attempted escape and a bus crash, and then a
train comes along and slams into the bus.  This spectacular chain of events
leaves wide open an opportunity to escape as well as the mouths and eyes of
the audience.  Called in on the case is U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard
(substituting for police Lt. Philip Gerard, and played irascibly,
irreverently by Tommy Lee Jones).  And the chase has everything but the
laid-back style of the television series.  In the series Kimble would
typically befriend someone and after he saves their marriage , they would
help him escape.  In the film Gerard is much closer on the trail and the
escapes are much more physically challenging.
     I think Harrison Ford is miscast in this and many of his films.  He
plays characters who are very sharp but he always appears on the bland edge
of confusion.  Admittedly, he has a right to be as dazed as he appears,
after the events of the film, but at the same time he is supposedly making
clever deductions.  Tommy Lee Jones may be playing an honest cop--uh, sorry,
U.S. marshal--but he steals the film right from under Ford.  He really can
play with the mind of the viewer by saying just the right unexpected comment
at just the right moment.  And nearly as sarcastic is Joe Pantoliano as
Cosmo Renfro, assisting Gerard.  Pantoliano is a character actor who manages
to make small parts get noticed.  Sela Ward plays Kimble's wife and appears
to be the perfect reward for all the hard work of medical school.
     THE FUGITIVE is a terrific thriller that may stretch the credulity of
the audience at times, but leaves them well-entertained for better than two
hours.  I give it a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.
        ***HEAVY SPOILER*** ***HEAVY SPOILER*** ***HEAVY SPOILER***
     Here we have yet another mystery in which the solution does not quite
explain the mystery.  Apparently the drug company is involved with the plot
since they have lent security people to it.  It makes no sense that they
would do that without knowing the drug was faulty.  But a drug company is
not the same as General Motors.  It is *very* dependent on a good name
because the doctors who prescribe its products are a very cautious lot.  So
if you are a drug company, you might try to cover up the negligence of
letting a faulty drug get on the market, but you would be really cautious
about what has not yet been released.  Any possibility of scandal is very,
very strongly avoided.  At least, that is my understanding.  The story
holds together neither if you assume the drug company knew nor if you assume
it doesn't.

     Despite his innocence, Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) has been
tried, convicted, and sentenced to die for the murder of his wife.  On
the bus ride that takes him to the prison where he will spend the rest
of his days, Kimble is accompanied by three other prisoners.  When they
stage an attempted escape, the driver of the bus loses control and it
plunges down an embankment.  Kimble is free.  Ninety minutes later,
Federal Deputy Marshal Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) arrives on the
scene to coordinate the search for the fugitive.  So, while Kimble
flees Gerard and his men, he begins his search for his wife's real
killer--a mysterious one-armed man (Andreas Katsulas).
     THE FUGITIVE is loosely based on the 1960s television series which
featured the late David Jansen in the title role.  The film takes a lot
of liberties with the original premise and characters, weaving a story
that barely resembles the one which entertained TV audiences more than
twenty years ago.  Back then, Dr. Kimble was on the run for week after
week, and there was more to each episode than the chase.  Now, however,
the flight lasts two hours, and catching the criminals is all that's on
anyone's mind.
     Oddly, even though THE FUGITIVE is an admitted chase movie, the
scenes before the hunt begins are among the best of the movie.
Everything surrounding the murder and trial, all told in a tremendously
well-edited fifteen minute prologue, is engrossing.  We don't see much
of the relationship between Richard and Helen Kimble, but what we're
presented with gives us insight into the double tragedy faced by the
doctor.  Not only is his beloved wife dead, but he's the one believed
by everyone to have killed her.  Kimble's character, revealed through
these scenes, is well in place by the time his sentence is read.
     Following the opening scenes, we're treated to over a half-hour of
nonstop action as Gerard and his men go after Kimble.
Well-photographed and directed with a flair, this part of the movie
keeps viewers on the edges of their seats.  Most importantly, when on
the run, Kimble acts like an intelligent human being.  Equally as
refreshing, the lawmen are his match, not a bunch of uniformed dunces
being run around in circles.
     In fact, it could be argued that both Kimble and Gerard are too
intelligent, not to mention too lucky. The plot is far from airtight,
and there are a number of contrivances that come into play to bring
about the resolution.  How much of these you accept depends on how much
license you're willing to give the film makers.  Considering the
overall quality of the movie, I think they deserve some room to
maneuver, and most of the plot hiccups didn't bother me.
     The movie's pace flags somewhat during the second hour as the
pursuit cools down and Kimble's own search for the one armed man takes
up screen time.  There's a little more talking and less action during
the middle portion of the movie.  Of course, the action predictably
starts to build again as the closing moments arrive.  The ending lacks
originality but is nevertheless more satisfying than not.
     Most of THE FUGITIVE's problems center around Kimble's
investigation of his wife's murder.  There are too many leaps of
intuition and handily placed clues.  The murder mystery is not
well-constructed and there's no way that the audience can figure out
who's responsible for the killing until the film reveals it (unless
they use the old tried-and-true method of guessing based on who is
among the least likely of suspects).  Simplifying this part of the
story might have resulted in a more tightly constructed plot, and a
little less confusion about the motivation of some of the characters.
     Personally, I wasn't that interested in Kimble's search.  Sure, I
wanted him to find the one armed man, but the lure of THE FUGITIVE is
the cat-and-mouse chase between the doctor and Gerard.  These moments
are at the heart of the movie; they make the picture work because it's
through them that suspense is developed.  Witness the scene at the
dam--the tension as the two main characters confront each other is
palpable.  A little more of this Kimble/Gerard interplay might have put
THE FUGITIVE squarely on the same level as another of the summer's big
thrillers, IN THE LINE OF FIRE.
     With all apologies to Harrison Ford, who turns in a far more
emotive and less wooden performance than in PATRIOT GAMES, the real
acting standout is Tommy Lee Jones.  For a man whose star has been on
the rise for the past couple of years, this may be the movie that
finally gets him into the upper echelon of today's performers.  He
invests his character with charisma and energy and, as Gerard's
grudging respect for Kimble grows, so does our appreciation of what
Jones is doing with his seemingly straightforward role.  Assuming that
Kimble is the good guy (which the script goes out of its way to make
clear), that means that Gerard, who's chasing him, is the bad guy.
And, as the film progresses, we can't help starting to like him.
     While no one could accuse THE FUGITIVE of having a masterful
insight into human nature, that's not why this film was produced.
There's an odd moment or two when an element of someone's behavior
strikes a responsive chord, but basically the characters are developed
only enough to keep us interested in them as the chase proceeds.  They,
like the sometimes overplotted story, are subordinate to the hunt.
Fans of the old TV series will find echoes of the show here, but most
of this version is new.  "Innovative" is not a legitimate description
of THE FUGITIVE, but "entertaining" is.
