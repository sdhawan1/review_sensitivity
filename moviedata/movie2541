     Life in post-Communist Ukraine has not been kind to Anatoly
(Alexandre Lazarev).  A respected academic and linguist before the
collapse of the Soviet Union, Anatoly now finds his skills useful only for
translating business deals at a few dollars a shot.  Even his wife Katia
(Angelika Nevolina) is finding a better deal in an affair with a
co-worker.  Feeling depressed and obsolete, Anatoly decides on a
thoroughly market-economy solution to his woes:  through a friend (Eugen
Pachin), he hires someone to kill him.  The problems ensue when Anatoly
changes his mind, and the only way to end the contract on his life is to
hire another killer to eliminate the first.
     This might seem like the premise for a slapstick farce; in fact, it
might sound strangely similar to the premise for Warren Beatty's current
BULWORTH.  But like BULWORTH, A FRIEND OF THE DECEASED takes that premise
and steers it into some astute social commentary.  Director Vyacheslav
Krishtofovich and screenwriter Andrei Kourkov may romanticize the
Communist past, but they also paint an intriguing picture of people
adapting to the capitalist present.  Many dive into the world of crime
without any understanding of the potential consequences -- a bright-eyed
young prostitute (Tatiana Kravitska) believes she can marry a violent man
and still carry on with her work as though nothing had changed, while a
hired killer leaves behind a wife and baby when his profession finally
catches up with him.  It is left to Anatoly to grasp the dangerous course
his country is on, and to take a step which will turn compassion into a
marketable commodity.
     A FRIEND OF THE DECEASED might have been an even more compelling film
if it had been more consistent, both in tone and pacing.  At times it
takes on the tense atmosphere of an espionage thriller; at other times, it
has the loping pace of deadpan comedy; at still other times, there is the
stark sincerity of domestic drama.  Each is effective in its own way, but
in combination they can leave you wondering how you're supposed to feel
about the strange events in Anatoly's life.  Fortunately, that confusion
plays a significant role in this story of complex social change where the
rules are still being determined.  It is also fortunate that Alexandre
Lazarev, with his soulful eyes and weary decency, makes for such a
sympathetic tour guide through this world.  A FRIEND OF THE DECEASED is a
slightly blurry window onto a morally-blurry world and the people trying
to survive while they try to make it all a bit more clear.

     In the press information for his new film, A FRIEND OF THE
DECEASED (PRIYATEL POKOINIKA), Ukrainian Director Vyacheslav
Krishtofovich says the story is about all the "cultured people" living
in what was once the Soviet Union.  "In the absence of liberty, these
people helped one another," he says.  "Human warmth was very present.
But freedom suddenly appeared and, with it, coldness and solitude."
(He goes on to note that in Ukrainian the word for love and pity are
sometimes considered synonyms.)
     Thus we have a film of revisionist history in which the filmmaker
seems to be saying that if, we just brought back Communist
totalitarianism, the people would pull together and be happy again.
But, without Big Brother to unite against, the people shuffle along
without purpose, drinking and feeling sorry for themselves.  Of course,
the old Soviet Union under Stalin and his successors had a tremendous
problem with alcoholism, and the citizens were not known for their
excessive love of life.
     Regardless of the background for the picture, the story by Andrei
Kurkov has a promising plot but little more.  The setup is that
Anatoli, played with a single blank stare by Alexander Lazarev, has a
beautiful blonde wife, Katia (Angelica Nevolina), who is cheating on
him.  During a drunken binge with his friend Dima (Yevgeni Pashin), he
decides to put out a contract on Katia's boyfriend.  The next morning,
more despondent than ever, Anatoli decides to put out the hit on
himself instead.  Along comes a perky prostitute named Vika (Tatiana
Krivitskaya), who serves up love and hope along with the sex, and
Anatoli decides to change his mind.  Unable to turn off the original
killer, he hires a bodyguard, who sets out to kill the killer.
     If this all sounds like a fascinating black comedy, it isn't.  The
movie is devoid of humor, and the director stages scenes way too
slowly, emphasizing the tragedy of the film's depressed protagonist.
Vladimir Gronsky's melancholy music permeates many of the scenes to
remind of us of the pervasive sorrow in the land.
     "Friendship disappeared with our glorious Soviet past," Dima
remarks to Anatoli.  And all the compelling characters disappeared from
this movie before the filming started.  All that we are left with is
the outlines of a story.
     A FRIEND OF THE DECEASED runs 1:40.  It is in Russian with English
subtitles.  The picture is rated R for some nudity, profanity and
violence and would be fine for older teenagers.

     Ukrainian film maker Vyacheslav Krishtofovich has used his latest 
film, A FRIEND OF THE DECEASED (which was one of the five Best Foreign 
Film nominees for the1998 Oscars), to take a darkly comic look at the 
current economic and social climate in the former Soviet Union.  
Krishtofovich is on record as saying that the "human warmth" evident 
during the height of socialism has been replaced by solitude and self-
interest in the new era of freedom.  As he says in a prepared Director's 
Statement: "In Ukrainian, the word 'love' and the word 'pity' are 
sometimes considered synonyms.  That is why I made this film about 
people whom I pity.  And whom I love."
     Today in the Ukraine, it's possible to buy and sell almost anything 
Â– drugs, sex, booze, and murder.  The Black Market is booming, and 
Kiev's sidestreets are teeming with drug dealers, prostitutes, and 
contract killers.  In this new environment, someone like Anatoli 
(Alexandre Lazarev), a reserved intellectual who was trained to be a 
translator in English and French, finds himself without work or self-
respect.  His wife, a successful advertising executive, is about to 
leave him for another man, and there's nothing he can do about it.  One 
day, he casually mentions his problems to a friend, Dima (Eugen Pachin), 
who suggests putting out a hit on his wife's lover.  With surprising 
rapidity, Dima puts Anatoli in contact with Kostia (Constantin 
Kostychin), who accepts the job over the phone, without meeting his 
client face-to-face.  But, instead of providing Kostia with his wife's 
lover's description, Anatoli gives the killer a picture of himself, 
figuring that arranging his own murder offers a quick and painless way 
out of a dreary life.  But, when a tryst with a prostitute (Tatiana 
Krivitska) re-invigorates Anatoli and causes him to change his mind, 
it's too late to call off the hit.  So, to save his life, Anatoli must 
hire another contract killer to eliminate the first one.
     With a script (by Andrei Kourkov) that combines dark comedy, drama, 
and suspense, A FRIEND OF THE DECEASED proves to be a fascinating and 
engaging look at a country in turmoil.  The way the story develops, with 
a number of inventive twists overlaying a typically "Russian" sense of 
tragedy, conjures up images of the work of Fyodor Dostoevsky as filtered 
through O. Henry.  The screenplay drips with irony as Anatoli, who is an 
astute-but-ineffectual man, learns to use the mechanics of Ukrainian 
capitalism to rebuild the life that it was instrumental in destroying.  
     While most of the film wades through dramatic currents, with 
occasional swells of satire and grim humor, one extended sequence 
recalls the suspense of a Hitchcock feature.  It occurs when Anatoli is 
playing the bait in a trap devised by the second killer to catch the 
first.  The problem is that Anatoli has never seen Kostia, and has only 
a sketchy description of what he looks like.  As a result, the 
possibility exists that Anatoli could accidentally mark an innocent man 
for death.  For about fifteen minutes, Krishtofovich continually 
ratchets up the tension as Anatoli tries to flush out Kostia before he 
fulfills his contract.
     The only real problem with A FRIEND OF THE DECEASED is that there 
are occasions when things seem a little overplotted.  From time-to-time, 
the seams of the script show, and we're aware that a character is acting 
in a certain way because that's what the plot demands.  In particular, 
Anatoli's inability to call off the first contract killer seems like a 
contrivance.  After all, how hard does he really try? 
     A FRIEND OF THE DECEASED's primary asset is that it offers an 
insider's perspective of the labyrinthine workings of contemporary Kiev, 
and how the transition from the old ways to the new ones have overturned 
the values and shifted the balance of a society.  (At one point, a 
character remarks, "Before we had friendships.  Now we have business 
relationships.")  It's a plus that the movie is well-acted, gripping, 
and populated with enough bizarre twists to keep even a casual viewer 
involved.  Although not a masterpiece, A FRIEND OF THE DECEASED is a 
strong and worthwhile effort from an acclaimed Ukrainian director.

   Depending on your views about communism, "A Friend of
the Deceased" is either the most reactionary movie since
"Starship Troopers" or the most progressive one since "Red
Sorghum."  Director Vyacheslav Krishtifovich, who filmed the
action in Ukraine's touristic capital of Kiev, has a political axe
to grind.  He may not wholeheartedly support a return to the
good old days of Ukraine's provincial role in a firmly
communist Soviet Union.  But while he appreciates the
freedom the new country has since independence from
Moscow, he looks back sympathetically to a time that
Ukrainians were more warm and neighborly and blames
capitalism for a new atmosphere of coldness.  It's all business
dealings now, he seems to say, not human connection.  His
theory has pertinence to the countries like the U.S. which
have long enjoyed capitalism.  It's commonly believed that in
poor areas, the residents support one another.  They refuse
to send their elderly and frail to nursing homes, they sit on
stoops and chat the night away.  But Krishtofovich is
forgetting that in needy neighborhoods, crime is sometimes
rampant and social pathologies make their mark in the
disproportionate number of the mentally ill.  And China, still
firmly in the communist camp despite its free-market reforms,
is no model of people-to-people cordiality.
   Krishtofovich, using a screenplay by Andrei Kourkov, seems
eager to display a new Dodge City world in Kiev ruled by
high-flying entrepreneurs, the Mob and the black market.  At
least that's what the press notes indicate.  By focusing on a
lonely intellectual who seems unable to make it in this brave
new world, he wants to portray a society adrift, one in which a
new class of losers abounds.  Anatoli (Alexandre Lazarev), a
nerdy Woody Allen type without that master's sense of humor
or irony, had always made his living as a translator for
Ukrainian firms who need to deal with those who speak
English and French.  For reasons not explained, he has fallen
on hard times since the silent revolution which has replaced
the Iron Curtain with the open door.  Why would his country
need him in the past but not now?  One would think a
flourishing business economy could use his talents to an even
greater degree.  
   His wife Katia (Angelika Nevolina) is leaving him for a
hipper guy with a fancy red car (as though the wheels were
the only reason for her departure).  His phone--whose
handset is mysterious and inexplicably tied to the unit forcing
him to use the speakerphone--rarely rings.  He is depressed
and, through a friend, Dima (Eugen Pachin), he hires a hit
man.  The intended victim is not Katia's boyfriend but his own
suicidal self.  When he meets a hooker, Lena (Tatiana
Krivitska), a spirited but unappealing vamp who is attracted to
Anatoli, his mood brightens, he wants to call off the hit, but
discovers that it's too late.  The contract, once agreed to,
must be fulfilled.  The remainder of the story deals with his
efforts to stop his own execution, which involves the hiring of
Ivan (Sergiy Romanyuk), a hit man for the hit man.
   Lazarez plays the role in a deadpan manner that would not
impress W.C. Fields.  He is so down-and-out throughout, so
phlegmatic and inarticulate, that he seems already to be the
titled deceased guy.  Only Elena Korkova in the role of
Marina, the wife of the contract killer, brings breath to this
downer of a film, which fails appropriately to exploit the Kiev
milieu and, more important, does not promote the creators'
view that Anatoli's problems are the fault of the new
capitalism.  In Russian with English titles, "A Friend of the
Deceased" was exhibited at several film festivals including
those at Cannes, Toronto, and Sundance.  Rated R.  Running
time: 100 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten 1998
