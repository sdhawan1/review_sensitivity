Cirque du Soleil is back with this direct-to-video production, Dralion,
89 minutes of jumping, flying, dancing, and wordless gags that will
leave you either breathless or, in my case, fumbling for a vial of
Tylenol.
Typical of any Cirque production, Dralion features a jaw-dropping and
expansive litany of acrobatic stunts, presented in rapid-fire succession
so that you never know what's coming at you.  A martial arts-style
performance with flags for swords will be succeeded by a juggler with
seven balls in the air.  A trapeze act will abut a gaggle of little
Asian girls who stack themselves five-high on one another's shoulders. 
For comic relief, "clowns" will come out and goof around -- the best
part of the video being a short, bald man who picks someone out of the
crowd to use as an unwitting ally in his own stunts (though later the
"audience member" turns out to be a Cirque troupe performer).
Sounds good so far.  Alas, the problem with Dralion is not in its
action, it's with its filmmaking.  While the filmmakers should be
congratulated for having so many cameras, the editor should be shot for
feeling compelled to cut among them every couple of seconds.  Flash! 
We're in a wide shot overlooking the arena.  Flash!  We're on a close-up
of a performer's agonized face.  Flash!  We're watching one of the
singers who would otherwise be in the background.  Flash!  We're looking
at a kid in the audience eating cotton candy.  Flash!  We're back to the
wide shot.
This rapid-fire editing is incessant, never pausing for a minute, and
stands as one of the worst examples of cutting a film together I've ever
seen.  Not only does this detract from the performance, it makes it
virtually impossible to see what's going on altogether.  The use of
video to capture the goings on doesn't help either, lending a Circus of
the Stars feel to the proceedings.  Like most Cirque films, the actual
acrobatics are fun and fine, but the way they are presented simply
blows.  Literally, watching the film gave me a headache inside of 25
minutes.
And that's got to hurt more than trying to balance your whole body on
one arm.
