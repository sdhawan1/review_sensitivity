          Capsule review:  Unlucky in love, Michael Myers plays a
     man who finally finds the perfect woman, only to start
     finding clues that she may have murdered three husbands.  The
     comedy is uneven but often amusing; the mystery elements need
     a lot of work.  Rating: high 0 (-4 to +4).  (Mystery elements
     discussed in a heavy spoiler at the end of the review.)
     Charlie Mackenzie (played by Michael Myers) has been unlucky in love.
Each of his former loves has had something seriously wrong with her, as he
recounts to his policeman friend and as he sets to jazz poems as part of a
very obnoxious coffee house act.  It could be that each had been involved on
the mossy side of the law or it could all be in Charlie's mind.  Or a third
very real possibility is that Charlie's personality drives people to
desperate acts.  Then Charlie meets Harriet (played by Nancy Travis) and
they are just perfect for each other.  This might be the one for Charlie.
The only problem is that Harriet's background is surprisingly like that of
"Mrs. X"--the designation the tabloids have given to an unknown woman who
has apparently murdered three husbands.  One piece of evidence after another
links Harriet to the three murders.  Is Harriet the infamous Mrs. X?
     SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER is a comedy/mystery, with the accent on
comedy.  And I mean that 100% of the accent is on comedy.  The mystery
writing is an insult to mystery films.  It is just a framework on which to
hang the comedy.  (Strongly-worded spoiler section to follow.)  Perhaps this
is more a skit than an actual film.  While I was not fond of Myers in
WAYNE'S WORLD, there is some humor here that works.  Alan Arkin is on hand
as a police captain, the boss of Charlie's best friend, and a running gag
involving him is original and funny.  Robbie Fox's screenplay tries to go
for some bad-taste humor that on the whole falls flat.  Mostly it is aimed
at the audience who thinks that crotch injuries are hilarious and not over-
used.  The scenes of Charlie's home life with his eccentric Scottish father
(also played by Myers) fail to generate much interest value or feel of
authenticity.
     SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER is a comedy/mystery with some edge on the
comedy, but the mystery elements are just not very keen.  I rate it a high 0
on the -4 to +4 scale.

     SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER is the worst mystery film I have seen
since HAUNTED HONEYMOON.  Historically there have been few mystery films
written this poorly that did not have Bela Lugosi in a red herring role.
First, there is a rule in mysteries that you look for the person who is
completely unnecessary to the plot, particularly if that person is played by
someone well-known.  In this film, one person stands out in neon lights as a
familiar actor who seems to have nothing to do up to the finale.  If that
character is not played by Lugosi, you can bet that you have the murderer.
     Second, there is no sign that the writers gave any thought at all to
their own story.  There is a strong implication at the end that because
somebody else was the actual killer, Harriet is now happy and free.  Harriet
may not have been the killer but she certainly has been an accessory to
these murders, concealing them from the law.  And having concealed the first
murder, she is legally responsible for the two that followed.  It is absurd
to see Harriet grinning in a coffee house at the end: this is a woman who is
going to spend most of the rest of her life behind bars.  And I may not be
in the spirit of the film, but I think it's a good thing.

     As the title suggests, this is a B-movie-style romantic comedy. It
is a vehicle for Michael Myers, who gets to do several different
characters:  beat poet, Scottish father, romantic guy. Nancy Travis
stars, but does not distinguish herself, as the potential axe
murderess.
     I thought the movie worked fairly well as a vehicle for Myers.  I
liked him both as a beat poet and as his own Scottish father (who sings
sentimental favorites from the House of Stewart -- that is, Rod).
     In terms of plot, though, forget it. The film makes no pretense of
caring about coherence or much else. What does Myers's character do for
a living?  Why do the police know so little about "Mrs. X"?  Why were
none of the disappearances reported?  Etc. If this were a complete
fantasy I could see the these details as unimportant, but the film is
not constructed that way.
     There are a few fine comic actors in small but fun roles.  Alan
Arkin plays the police sergeant, Charles Grodin is the commandeered
motorist, and Phil Hartman plays a guard at Alcatraz.
     The fine actress Brenda Fricker, who is unfortunately (for her
career) no longer young, is wasted in a humiliating role.  Remarkable,
isn't it, how men can mature into interesting characters who get great
parts (De Niro, Nicholson), while fine actresses disappear after a
certain age (e.g., Streep).
     This is a fun movie if you like Michael Myers.  It is a reasonable
date movie. But its quality puts it more in the VCR rental arena.

     Charlie MacKenzie (Mike Myers) hasn't had the best luck with
women, although the problem is more with him than his dates.  He can't
commit (the notion of marriage frightens him to death), so whenever a
relationship starts to get serious, Charlie finds an excuse to dump
her.  Hey, if she smells like beef vegetable soup, that's a good enough
reason.  This time, however, Charlie is really smitten.  There's only
one problem--an increasing amount of evidence seems to point to
Harriet (Nancy Travis) as being the mysterious Mrs. X, a woman who is
suspected of having married, then killed, three men.
     A good indication that this movie didn't work for me is that I
never cared whether or not Nancy Travis' Harriet was an axe murderer.
The characters--and it's not just her's--are so paper-thin that it
doesn't make a difference who lives or dies, and who does the killing.
There isn't enough life in these people even to consider them
caricatures.
     P. D. James need not worry.  The creative team behind this film is
not poised to steal away her title of the "Queen of Crime."  Mysteries
are supposed to be complex, intriguing, and beguiling, with the
audience unsure of the truth until the very end.  None of these things
is true of SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER.  In fact, the solution is so
obviously telegraphed that it's possible to have the answer fifteen
minutes into the movie.  Of course, given the number of logical flaws
in the resolution, it's a safe bet that you won't have gotten
everything right.  It's impossible to predict things that don't make
sense.
     So, having established that there's no reason to care for the
characters and that the murder mystery plot is as feeble as they come,
that leaves only the comedy to comment on.  As I've said before, any
movie can overcome flaws if it's funny enough.  Laughter is the best
paint to hide the cracks in the story.  John Cleese's A FISH CALLED
WANDA is an excellent example of this.  Unfortunately, SO I MARRIED AN
AXE MURDERER is not.
     Not only is the humor banal, it's only fitfully amusing.  For
every joke that works, there are half a dozen that fall flat.
Apparently Mike Myers thinks he's a lot funnier than he actually is.
The whole Scottish shtick with Charlie's father (also played by Myers)
wears thin quickly, but Myers keeps pushing it long after it's ceased
to elicit more than forced chuckles.
     There are three nice cameos in the film.  The best of these
belongs to Alan Arkin, who plays a nice police chief trying to act
tough to please one of his detectives.  Arkin is only in a few scenes,
so there's not enough time for the gag to get overused.  Also good is
Charles Grodin as a car driver who refuses to let his vehicle be
commandeered.  Finally, although not quite as good as the other two,
but still worth a mention, is Phil Hartman's Alcatraz security guard.
Excepting perhaps Leslie Nielsen, few actors do deadpan better than
Hartman.
     There's nothing in SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER to make this film
worthwhile entertainment.  It's about as unspectacular a production as
there is, with the typical level of juvenile comedy that the writer,
director, and actors think is funnier than those stuck in a theater
watching the picture.
     Sneak previews of SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER paired this movie
with WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S 2.  The thought of sitting through these films
back-to-back makes me shudder.  One at a time is bad enough, but both
in four hours?  Of the two, SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER is the better
production.  Not much better, but an improvement nonetheless.  Faint
praise indeed, considering the competition.

     After suffering through Mel Brooks' latest atrocity, ROBIN HOOD:
MEN IN TIGHTS--quite possibly the worst film I've seen In My Entire
Life--the idea of stomaching a second supposed "comedy" two nights in a
row didn't exactly thrill me to the gills.  The ominously
awful-sounding SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER was the movie in question.
     Not only is the film funny, sometimes side-splittingly so, but
it's also very well made, with unexpected moments of real tension and
tenderness in and amongst the comedy.  For a movie that promises to mix
marriage and murder, there isn't a mean moment in this melange.  Kudos
to director Thomas Schlamme, writer Robbie Fox, and to a stellar
comedic cast that includes Mike Myers, Nancy Travis, Anthony LaPaglia,
Brenda Fricker, and ... er, Mike Myers.
     Set in the heart of San Francisco, SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER
tells the story of Charlie Mackenzie, a happenin' bachelor who performs
his unique brand of beat poetry in a retro-chic coffeehouse.  By
"unique" I mean bad. Charlie, it seems, has yet to meet the perfect
girl.  Afraid of commitment, he's dumped each of his previous
girlfriends for less than perfect reasons ("She smelled like soup," for
example).  Or so he tells his buddy Tony, an underappreciated cop
played by Anthony LaPaglia.  LaPaglia is cute and cuddly in this movie,
and shares some great moments with his police captain boss (an
unbilled, amusing cameo by Alan Arkin).
     But when Charlie meets Harriet (Nancy Travis), who works at a
butcher shop called "Meats of the World," it's love at first sight.
He's smitten--"full of smit" as he calls it.  The couple share a funny
meat montage together, replete with missing limb gags and ALIEN-style
chest-bursting humor. However, evidence soon begins to mount that
instead of finding Ms. Right, Charlie might well have stumbled upon
Mrs. X, whom the tabloids call "The Honeymoon Killer."  Mrs. X has the
tendency to slice and dice her husbands on their wedding night and
Harriet, after all, is quite adept at wielding the necessary
paraphernalia.  Needless to say all this makes Charlie more than a wee
bit paranoid.
     Among the film's funniest scenes are those in the Mackenzie
household. Brenda Fricker plays Charlie's over-friendly mother May and
her flexibility as an actress is astonishing, especially when you
compare this character to her dramatic, Oscar-winning role in MY LEFT
FOOT.  Mike Myers serves double duty in the film, playing Charlie's
overly Scottish father, Stuart. If anything, he's funnier as Dad than
he is as Charlie, continually yelling at his younger son (whom he calls
"Head" on account of the boy's disproportionately large hairdo) with a
brogue that's spot on.  Wearing heavy makeup and thick-lensed glasses,
Myers' Stuart is an armchair-ridden, McKewan's lager guzzling
caricature of hysterical proportions.  And his bagpipe-backed rendition
of Rod Stewart's "Do Ya Think I'm Sexy" is almost as funny as the Bay
City Rollers music that thunders from the Mackenzie homestead.
     With the exception of Arkin's, many of the film's cameos (by the
likes of Phil Hartman, Michael Richards, Stephen Wright and Charles
Grodin) are distracting, but otherwise the film maintains an even
keel.  Myers and Travis are silly but likable as the nervous newlyweds,
even though Myers obviously finds it harder playing it straight.  It's
not too much of a challenge figuring out the film's ending, but in "So
I Married an Axe Murderer," the accent is more on comedy than mystery,
so don't let that fact spoil your enjoyment of an otherwise
entertaining film.
     From its frothy Cappuccino-Cam(R) opening to its dramatic rooftop
conclusion, SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER is a surprisingly fun night at
the movies, buoyed along by a smattering of WDRE hits on the
soundtrack, picturesque views of the San Francisco Bay area, and
consistently droll injections of humor.  It's a goofy comedy/thriller
with an edge.
