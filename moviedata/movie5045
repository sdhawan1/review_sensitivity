    -------------------------------------------------------------
If you've seen any number of American independent films in recent
years, you've no doubt run across the ubiquitous PARTY GIRL herself,
Parker Posey, who seems to literally appear in every third recent
movie.  From early 1997 releases like Christopher Guest's WAITING FOR
GUFFMAN, Greg Motolla's THE DAYTRIPPERS, Richard Linklater's
subUrbia, and Peter Cohn's DRUNKS to upcoming films such as Jill
Sprecher's feature debut CLOCKWATCHERS and a reunion with Hal Hartley
in HENRY FOOL, Ms. Posey is, along with the similarly-prolific Lili
Taylor, the reigning Queen of the Indies, and has been extremely
impressive throughout her career with her sassy, infectiuously
energetic and dynamic performances.  Her astonishing vivacious turn
in Mark Waters' debut film THE HOUSE OF YES, for which she was
awarded a Special Outstanding Performance prize earlier this year at
the 19th edition of the Sundance Film Festival, is the pivotal
performance in her career, and should serve as her big breakout role
into mainstream recognition and future stardom.
While most black comedies typically feature one or two decidedly
eccentric characters in order to heighten the inherently perverse
natures of their plots, the witty THE HOUSE OF YES deliciously takes
this concept a bit further -- virtually every character in the film
is quirky and bizarre to varying degrees except for cheery,
sweet-natured donut shop waitress Lesly (Tori Spelling), who acts as
the audience surrogate and plays as the interloper into the strange,
deranged world of the Pascal family.  Set on a stormy Thanksgiving
evening, conventionally handsome Marty Pascal (Josh Hamilton) returns
home with new fiancee Lesly, looking every bit like a fresh-faced
wholesome young couple, to his strikingly odd and scandalous clan:
dim and overly eager-to-please younger brother Anthony (Freddie
Prinze Jr.), supercilious and largely-preoccupied matriarch Mrs.
Pascal (Genevieve Bujold), and, most notably, his recently
deinstitutionalized and highly emotionally volatile twin sister (Ms.
Posey), who goes by the name Jackie-O and is completely obsessed with
the former First Lady to the point of trotting about the house
sporting a pageboy hairdo, in various looks immortalized by the late
Jacqueline Onassis: pink Chanel ensemble complete with pillbox hat,
or simple black dress with strand of pearls.  Jackie-O's fixations
aren't limited to the late First Lady; acerbic and hysterical while
preparing for Marty's return, she greets her twin brother at the
front door with a euphoric, impassioned embrace befitting that of a
savior, virtually vaulting herself into his arms.  When the inclement
weather knocks out the power and causes a hasty postponement of
Thanksgiving dinner, Mrs. Pascal retreats into the darkness, leaving
the four young characters to make do for the remainder of the
evening, and by candlelight the sordid family secrets of Lesley's
future in-laws are gradually revealed.
The antecedent of THE HOUSE OF YES as a 1990 stage play penned by
Wendy MacLeod (which had a long, successful run in San Francisco) is
clearly evident from the single locale and the heavy reliance on
dialogue to drive the plot forward.  However, despite a faithful
adaptation of Ms. MacLeod's play by Mr. Waters in his screenplay, the
stage roots of THE HOUSE OF YES do not prove to be restrictive --
indeed, attempts to greatly open up the story for the film medium
would likely destroy the claustrophobic tone set early in the film
and shatter the metaphoric barrier separating the unique world of the
Pascal family from normalcy, undermining the depiction of their
disturbed behaviour and resulting in their appearance coming off more
as ridiculous than distinctively quirky.
While THE HOUSE OF YES is a highly stylized and peculiar black comedy
with a truly inspired storyline, its clear strength is its wholly
original dialogue.  The film's astonishingly clever banter is wicked,
biting, and hysterical, and Mr. Waters' makes a fine feature debut
with his confident, assured helming of THE HOUSE OF YES, with some
inspired kinetic camera work and crisp cutting of the terrific verbal
interplay in an effectively precise, rhythmic pattern.  An inspired
and inventive opening sequence is wonderfully realised.  Mr. Waters'
ability to guide the film between viciously comic and stirringly
dramatic scenes are most impressive and clearly evident, and his
solid, capable work here heralds him as a promising new talent.
While the remainder of the ensemble cast of THE HOUSE OF YES is
generally solid, there can be no doubt that this film essentially
belongs to Ms. Posey, who dominates throughout with her wonderfully
entertaining and captivating performance.  An on-screen dynamo with
remarkable intensity, she can turn from delightfully witty and
hilariously cruel to remarkably unstable and utterly pathetic on a
dime, and Ms. Posey's rendition of Jackie-O is a completely
fascinating creation: a needy, fragile, and helpless mentally ill
young woman with a barely-suppressed hysteria who nonetheless lords
over the household by sheer audacity.  Hers is easily the most
interesting character in the film, and one is left wanting more when
she's offscreen.  Her delivery of the volley of stinging barbs at Ms.
Spelling's hapless character is brilliant -- savage and gleeful.
It's a stunning performance, highlighted by Ms. Posey's customary
fierce energy and mercurial appeal, and one which should catapult her
into the limelight.
"Independent film is where the heart is and where the stories are,"
Ms. Posey once commented, but after her triumphant performance in the
vastly entertaining THE HOUSE OF YES, it will be interesting to
observe how she reacts when Hollywood begins to pursue her with a
vigor.

     In the short, 221-year history of the United States of America, 
there has never been any royalty.  No barons, dukes, princes, and, 
especially, kings or queens.  The closest we have ever come was during 
the Kennedy years in the White House, but their reign was cut short by 
an assassin's bullet on November 22, 1963.  Nevertheless, somewhat 
inexplicably, the mystique still lingers, long after JFK and his wife 
have departed this life.  Mark Waters' darkly funny THE HOUSE OF YES 
provides a cutting look at the country's obsession with the Kennedys  a 
topic that seems apropos in light of the ghoulish fascination regarding 
Princess Diana.
     Going home to meet your fiance's family seems like the normal thing 
to do.  Intimidating, perhaps, but normal.  And Lesly (Tori Spelling) is 
a very normal girl, albeit not a particularly bright one.  In fact, 
that's why Marty Pascal (Josh Hamilton) is attracted to her - he has a 
craving for normalcy, something that he never got from his family.  His 
twin sister, Jackie-O (Parker Posey), is obsessed with the former First 
Lady, even going so far as to dress up as her and stage re-creations of 
JFK's final moments.  And the relationship between Marty and Jackie-O 
isn't a typical sibling connection; it's more like a brother/sister 
affair.  Mom (Genevieve Bujold) and little brother Anthony (Freddie 
Prinze Jr.) are aware of the situation, but, in the best interests of 
all involved, they turn a blind eye.  
     Then, on Thanksgiving Day in 1983, Marty shows up at his Washington 
D.C. home in the midst of a hurricane.  He's not alone - Lesly, the 
proud bearer of a new engagement ring, is with him.  Jackie-O's reaction 
upon learning that her beloved brother is no longer all hers is to let 
out a piercing scream.  Mom is a little more reserved.  On her way back 
into the kitchen, she calmly notes, "I'm going to go baste the turkey 
and hide the kitchen knives."  Over the next twenty-four hours, Lesly 
will learn all there is to know about Marty and Jackie-O while capturing 
Anthony's affection and earning Mom's enmity.
     Although THE HOUSE OF YES is dark, bleak, and occasionally 
disturbing, it is subversively funny - and I mean laugh-aloud funny.  
Admittedly, most of the humor is warped (how else could you describe a 
comedy with central themes of incest and an obsession with JFK's 
assassination), but it would take an exceedingly bland viewer not to 
find at least a few amusing elements in the film.  Consider, for 
example, the delightfully matter-of-fact manner in which Genevieve 
Bujold delivers her biting dialogue.  Or the wonderfully off-the-wall 
way in which Parker Posey brings Jackie-O to demented life.
     In fact, while Posey is obviously the film's acting standout, she 
is ably supported.  Josh Hamilton, a familiar face from Generation X 
movies, is believable as a brother torn between a carnal desire for his 
sister and her games, and a need for the kind of normal life he has 
always been denied.  Freddie Prinze, currently appearing in I KNOW WHAT 
YOU DID LAST SUMMER, shows an almost-creepy timidity as Anthony.  And, 
perhaps most surprising of all given her dubious reputation, Tori 
Spelling is fine as the dim Lesly.
     THE HOUSE OF YES is what happens when a film takes the 
dysfunctional family melodrama to its farthest reaches.  It's a bold, 
gutsy movie that's definitely not for everyone.  But, for those who are 
always looking for the next daring motion picture and who aren't 
offended by off-color humor, THE HOUSE OF YES offers 90 minutes of solid 
entertainment.  Not every chance taken by Mark Waters works, but enough 
are successful to produce some memorable motion picture moments.

On Thanksgiving eve, Jackie-O's eyes glisten as she tells her twin 
brother's fiancee, "I've been over the edge, now I'm back." She washes 
her anti-psychotic medication down with rum, noting that the pills are 
color-coordinated with her eyes. Surveying the goings-on, Jackie-O's 
mother excuses herself, saying, "I'm going to baste the turkey and hide 
the kitchen knives."
Welcome to "The House Of Yes," Mark Water's brilliant black comedy 
adapted from Wendy MacLeod's macabre play. "The House Of Yes" is a jewel, 
one of those rare and exhilarating films that completely realizes its own 
unique vision. 
The privileged  Pascal family inhabits a decaying Washington DC mansion, 
insulated from the rules of the outside world. Marty (Josh Hamilton) is 
the only family member to leave home since his father disappeared on the 
day John F. Kennedy was killed. When the young man returns with his 
fiancee, a Donut King hostess named Lesly (Tori Spelling), he hopes to 
introduce a little normality to the home. Nice try, Marty. His 
otherworldly mother (Genevieve Bujold) takes Lesly into the kitchen for a 
little chat, casually informing her that "Jackie was holding Marty's 
penis when they came out of the womb." After a storm knocks the lights 
out and Mom retires to her room, we learn more about the kids. Jackie-O 
(Parker Posey) and Marty have been lovers for years, reenacting the 
Kennedy assassination as foreplay.
You see, Jackie-O has this thing about the Kennedy's, routinely donning a 
pink suit, pearls and a pill box hat to emulate the former First Lady. 
While Jackie-O frantically tries to draw Marty back into her arms, 
Lesly's time is occupied by the twins' shy, eager-to-please younger 
brother Anthony (Freddie Prinze Jr.), who spills the beans about his 
siblings' romance, then wheedles Lesly to help him lose his virginity. 
Just to be fair, you should know that after this mundane stuff has been 
established, things get a little weird.
"The House Of Yes" has a delightfully creepy feel. It's like finally 
finding out what the Addams Family REALLY did behind closed doors. The 
whole thing could easily have become campy, smug or just too damn 
precious, but Waters' manages the mean trick of keeping this story 
emotionally grounded. By directing the actors playing the Pascal family 
to maintain a sense of heightened reality, he highlights just how 
isolated the Pascals are. With their mansion serving as some plush 
sensory deprivation tank, the family is cut off from life, damned by 
their own lack of self-restraint to live a hollow existence of melodrama 
and role-playing.
Water's couldn't have pulled this film off without skilled actors, and 
the cast of "House Of Yes" is superb. You'll immediately notice Parker 
Posey's triumphant turn as the whacked-out Jackie-O, but pay attention to 
the other performances as well. Genevieve Bujold creates a matriarch who 
is regal, snobby, droll and distracted in a truly odd, disturbing fashion.
 Josh Hamilton is a perfect yang to Jackie-O's yin. Watch his face when 
she tries to convince him to drop his attempts at a traditional life and 
return to the loony bed. Hamilton conveys a stunning transition of 
attitude using only his eyes and subtle changes in facial expression. He 
is exceptional. Tori Spelling conveys a charming naivete as a simple girl 
who "smells like powdered donuts." The real scene stealer, though, is 
Freddie Prinze Jr., who initially appears to be merely an ancillary 
character, but comes into his own with a sly, remarkably skilled 
performance. Watch him closely during Anthony's attempted seduction of 
Leslie. This boy can ACT.
While adroitly mixing humor and horror, Waters' plays games with your 
head. When Jackie-O begs Marty for some Dallas motorcade sex, you find 
yourself hoping he will agree. When Anthony tries to bed his brother's 
fiancee, you hope that he'll succeed. Is Waters trying to make a case for 
incest and stealing your brother's girl? Of course not. He is taking the 
audience, isolated in a movie theater, and showing us how easy it is to 
be seduced into wrong thinking by attractive, charming people while we're 
cut off from the rest of the world. Just like the Pascals.
At least that's my spin on it. Part of the beauty of "The House Of Yes" 
is that there are infinite ways to interpret the material. As the film 
makes its way across the country, it's proving to be one of those love-it-
or-hate-it movies. That's the way it usually works with innovative films, 
and "The House Of Yes" is certainly innovative. Shocking in its 
originality, it is funny, frightening, thought-provoking and one of the 
years best films.  
******* Interview with "House Of Yes" director Mark Waters *************
Ready for the anti-Camelot? In "The House Of Yes," a brilliant black 
comedy directed by South Bend native Mark Waters, we meet the Pascals, a 
privileged family who live in a Washington DC mansion, an insulated world 
where absolutely nothing is out of bounds. On November 22, 1963, at the 
same time President Kennedy was assassinated, Mr. Pascal abruptly 
disappeared from his family. Twenty years later, young Marty Pascal (Josh 
Hamilton) returns home for the holidays with new fiancee Lesly (Tori 
Spelling) by his side, ready to introduce her to the rest of the family; 
his regal, otherworldly mother (Genevieve Bujold,) younger brother 
Anthony (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and Marty's twin sister, Jackie-O (Parker 
Posey,) a beautiful, totally whacked out young woman with an intense 
fixation on the former first lady, and a very unique relationship with 
her twin brother. The dark psychological comedy is based on Wendy 
MacLeod's play of the same name.
"In 1990, when I first encountered the play in San Francisco, I wasn't a 
film person," explained Waters in a telephone interview. "I was a 
theatrical actor and director. I didn't go for straight plays generally, 
I liked things a lot more stylized, yet when I saw this play I really 
loved it because it had this kind of expressionistic stylization to it 
and a bleeding of genres. It was a really funny black comedy, an extreme 
and exciting suspense play and a powerful tragic drama as well. I loved 
it because it was very ambitious and achieved most everything it went for.
 I got a copy of the play from Wendy MacLeod's agent and put it aside 
until years later, after I'd gone to film school. I realized that with 
only five actors and one location, I could make this into a film on very 
little money, while dealing with an exciting, full piece of material."
Creating a dark comedy that pulls humor from taboo themes wasn't easy. 
Handled wrong, the film could easily have become smug or too clever for 
its own good, but Waters established a delicate balance that makes the 
material sing. "It started with the adaptation," he said. "I stripped 
down the play quite a bit, taking out a lot of dialogue that was just 
repartee for repartees sake; lines that didn't really add to the 
characters or the story. I also restructured the scenes so that things 
didn't happen without an emotional justification for them occurring. I 
imposed a dramatic texture or structure which wasn't there before and 
then adjusted the scenes so there would be emotional connections 
throughout the material. 
"The next part was really the casting. Parker, Josh, Freddie, Tori and, 
of course, Genevieve Bujold are all incredibly talented. I chose them 
because they were genuinely likable and charming, with a natural sense of 
acting. Even with Parker Posey's character, we tried to have her be more 
emotionally grounded than in most of her other roles and she relished the 
opportunity to do that more intimate kind of acting. We didn't want to 
veer off into camp, like the 'Addams Family' or 'Fassbinder,' where 
everything is so cold and dark that people wouldn't be able to engage the 
characters. When I started the adaptation, Wendy told me that it could 
work if it had high style with emotional truth. So in the movie, I 
decided we would have a level of stylization. We established a slightly 
heightened reality, without losing the emotional truth. The audience is 
able to stay with the characters as human beings even while watching them 
take things to unreal extremes at times.
"There's a scene in the dining room, where Jackie-O is at Marty's knees. 
She says "When you make love to that Lesly girl, do you see my face?" and 
Marty says "Sometimes." The movie is working well when the audience goes 
right along with them, wanting him to say yes, wanting him to acknowledge 
his love for Jackie. Then suddenly they think "Wait a second! They're 
brother and sister, I shouldn't be wanting this!" but at the same time 
they can't help but truly empathize and sympathize with the characters. 
It's one of the most crucial scenes in the movie. Going into shooting, I 
didn't know if we'd be able to pull it off. But both of those actors just 
stepped right up to the plate and did it. It's a very difficult, subtle 
thing to get the audience to sympathize with something they would 
normally find taboo and scary."
Incestuous sibling romances aside, one of the most controversial aspects 
of "The House Of Yes," which appears under the banner of Spelling Films, 
was the casting of Tori Spelling. Waters laughed about the fuss, saying, 
"I had no real awareness of Tori before I cast her. I don't watch TV much,
 except for "Seinfeld" and "Friends," and I'd never seen "Beverly Hills 
90210." When I read with her I was completely smitten. She was perfect 
for Leslie; shy, sweet and vulnerable. All I knew of her is that she was 
kind of a celebrity. I didn't know about all the baggage associated with 
her until we got to the Sundance Film Festival and we started getting 
reviews saying things like "a surprisingly capable Tori Spelling" and I 
thought "Wow, these people really have a chip on their shoulder about her."
 It was only months after the film was completed that I became aware of 
the charges of nepotism that have followed her through her career. 
Spelling Film's involvement with the piece came very late in the game. 
Aaron Spelling said he'd read the script, thought it was absolutely 
hilarious and wanted to acquire the movie, which was nice because we were 
all working on deferment and actually getting paid was great. If I'd been 
aware of all that nepotism charges, I would have insisted we stick with 
our old funding sources. But in the end Spelling Films was happy because 
they put their money behind a successful film, and Tori's happy because 
she got a chance to show her skills.
Waters is excited about his next project, "Strike." "It's also going to 
be a Miramax project; we're finalizing the contract and I'm about to get 
into the casting. It's great being a second time filmmaker because you 
don't have to struggle so much for money. The film is kind of set in 
Indiana, a mythical Midwestern High School based on my experiences. They 
were starting busing when I was going to school and I lifted the premise 
for the film from the Greek play 'Lysistrata' which is about a war 
between Athens and Sparta where the women get together and decide to 
withhold sex from the men in order to stop the war. I've set the story in 
a high school during a racial gang war where the black girls and the 
white girls get together and decide they're going to stop putting out, 
withholding sex from the boys to try and stop the violence. It's another 
black comedy, but the tone is different from 'The House Of Yes.'"
This year has seen three films with Indiana connections, all dealing with 
dark topics. Asked about the other films, Waters said, "'The House Of 
Yes' is a dark comedy, yet we're actually lighter than those other two 
movies. When you think about it, that's really pretty funny. 'Going All 
The Way' and 'In The Company Of Men' were my two favorite films at 
Sundance and it was just coincidental that they had the Indiana 
connection."
For her performance in "The House Of Yes," Parker Posey received a 
Special Acting Award at the Sundance Film Festival. 
******* Interview with Freddie Prinze Jr. from "The House Of Yes" 
********
When Freddie Prinze Jr., who plays Anthony, the younger brother in "The 
House Of Yes," walked in front of the crowd at a promotional appearance 
in Hollywood, he was visibly uncomfortable. As the cameras flashed and 
the emcee asked inane questions, Prinze looked desperate to get out of 
the room. Later, he discussed the evening. "To be honest, I'm still kind 
of learning how to do the celebrity stuff. It's not what I got into the 
business for, and I'm not very good at it. With people shouting Freddie! 
Freddie!' and sometimes even calling me Mr. Prinze,' it feels really 
strange. I understand it's part of the job, but I'm not good at it."
The talented young actor is far more comfortable discussing his work, 
particularly his outstanding turn in "The House Of Yes." "Anthony is kind 
of like Norman Bates before his Mom had the motel. He's so nice, yet has 
his own agenda. He can get manipulated, but at the same time he's very 
manipulative. The role was tricky because you don't want to give away too 
much at first."
The House Of Yes is a very intimate film, with the camera moving ever 
closer to the actor's faces as the story proceeds, which called for 
subtle performances from the cast. "I always worked from the gut, and 
this role called for me to play things mostly through my eyes, so I had 
to re-train myself. Parker Posey establishes a distinct tone, she's the 
thread between the beginning and the end of the movie and everybody 
revolves around Jackie-O, so you have to adjust your style so that 
everything meshes.
"My first job ever a three line role on Family Matters with Urkel," he 
laughed. "I was Burt the punk. I didn't even get a last name, just Burt 
the punk." Prinze also appeared in "To Gillian On Her 37th Birthday" and 
the current "I Know What You Did Last Summer." "It was so satisfying 
doing a film like The House Of Yes.' Mark Waters, the director, was like 
a kid in a candy store. It was his first film and he'd get so into scenes 
that he'd forget to say cut. We actually finished a half day ahead of 
schedule, which is amazing for an independent film. I'm really happy 
about the reception the film is getting. It's definitely the role I'm 
most proud of and it's gratifying when people respond well to it"

     "Oh my God, I sounded just like a mother!" Mrs. Pascal, played
with devilish wickedness by Genevieve Bujold, tells her son.  "Didn't I
sound just like a mother?"  "You are a mother," her son Marty tells her
disgustedly.  "I know, but I still can't believe it.  I look at you
people and wonder, how did you ever fit in my womb?"
     Marty, you see, is a grown-up twin.  Although his sister, who
thinks she is Jackie-O, is certifiably insane, Marty fits right in with
the rest of this highly dysfunctional family in the witty black comedy
THE HOUSE OF YES.
     Mother and daughter, played in a brilliant performance by Parker
Posey, are both varying degrees of wacko.  Most dysfunctional families
in the movies are more angry and mean-spirited than diabolically
abnormal as this one is.  The daughter's fantasy of being Jackie-O is
probably the most sane part of her being.  Mrs. Pascal is the sort that
will not let Jackie-O keep a hairbrush downstairs since food is kept on
that level.  She explains to Marty's new fiancee, Lesly (Tori
Spelling), soon after their first meeting that Jackie-O was holding
Marty's private part when she came out of the womb.
     The dialog by Wendy MacLeod, based on the play by Mark Waters, is
so sharp and biting that it seems in danger of cutting through the
celluloid at any moment.  The script, reminiscent of a David Mamet
play, flows smoothly with its fast paced intelligence and mesmerizing
set of bizarre characters.  The exaggerated setup has Lesly and Marty
arriving at the family's out of the way mansion during a Thanksgiving
Day hurricane.
     In this storm are two sane individuals.  The fiancee is a giddy,
school-girl type, embarrassed by everything, a complete contrast to her
rival Jackie-O's bitter pseudo-sophistication.  As the two twins'
younger brother, Anthony, Freddie Prinze Jr. plays the All-America boy
type whose only foible is his explicit obsession of bedding his
brother's fiancee that night.
     "We all have our secrets," Jackie-O tells her potential
sister-in-law, and boy, does she have a few.  This is a house filled
with them.  (When Lesly calls it the family's "home" to Mrs. Pascal --
they've never had a visitor before Lesly -- Mrs. Pascal becomes
discombobulated until she realizes that Lesly is talking about their
"house.")
     In a film that gives new meaning to the phrase, "made for each
other," the twin's biggest, but not their only secret, is that they've
had a long-term incestuous relationship.  They don't like to discuss
it, although they are not particularly ashamed of it.  Perfect for
viewers who can appreciate perverse comedy, this story never pulls its
punches.
     Jackie-O tries in many ways, few subtle, to show that she is a
better match for Marty than that ditzy fiancee of his.  In one scene
Marty and Lesly are playing chop sticks together on the piano when
Jackie-O pushes her aside and starts playing a challenging classical
piece for four hands.  Marty joins her as his fiancee looks on with
envy.
     The chemistry between Parker Posey and Josh Hamilton is nothing
short of amazing.  They put down their little brother and most of the
other sane people in the world.  Their ripostes are engaging filmmaking
at its best.  Director Mark Waters keeps the show's energy level high
and lets the leads sling zingers at each other at a furious pace.  His
crisp direction ensures the movie has nary an ounce of fat on it.
     Jackie-O is temperamentally incapable of being nice.  And being
jealous, she cuts Lesly down mercilessly.  "Were you poor?" Jackie-O
asks her when she finds that Lesly committed the crime of growing up
impoverished.  "Did you eat pies?  Chicken pot pies?"  "Pancakes
actually, lots of pancakes," Lesly replies with her usual sincerity.
     "A Donut King, so is she like the queen?," Jackie-O cattily
inquires of Marty when she learns that Lesly works at a Donut King.
"Are we entertaining royalty?"
     With Rolfe Kent's whimsically sinister music it never seems clear
where the story is headed.  Will it end in a big emotional explosion, a
murder, people slowly cutting each other up with words, a familial
catharsis, a weather disaster or what?  The emotionally charged play is
clearly going somewhere, and the engaging characters captivate the
audience with their spell.  I'll not say more except that the ending is
perfect and a bit of a surprise.
     THE HOUSE OF YES runs a blazing fast 1:25.  It is rated R for
sexual situations and conversations, mature themes, violent overtones
and some profanity.  The movie would be fine for older and mature
teenagers, i.e., treat the movie as it were rated NC-17.

THE HOUSE OF YES is a vicious but hilarious black-comic satire of the
American upper class, introducing us to a bizarre family whose isolation
and obsession with the Kennedys has led to murder and an incestuous
brother-sister relationship (the two of them seem to flirt by re-enacting
JFK's death, complete with ketchup and macaroni to simulate blood and
brains). Their snobbery and detachment is revealed by the appearance of
Leslie (Tori Spelling), the fiancée of the elder son in the family, who is
ridiculed by the daughter for being from Pennsylvania. All of this is
pretty absurd, but the dialogue, adapted by Mark Waters from a play by
Wendy MacLeod, is clever enough to disturb the audience and make them laugh
at the same time. Make no mistake about it: THE HOUSE OF YES is
cold-hearted, mean-spirited, and perverse. But as someone who normally
despises all three of those qualities in a film, I found myself curiously
entertained by all this.

 It has often been said that films are like drugs.  Let us expand upon this
and say that films, in fact, are drugs of sorts.  Not in the line that they
are completely addictive and that one will begin to need a sort of Methadone
to ween off of them but instead that they are drugs along the lines of
caffeine.  That each different type of movie is akin to a different type of
coffee.
 With this in mind, an analysis of dark comedies is possible.  Dark comedies
are triple-espressos drunk at two in the afternoon when your not tired but
are already wired.  In short, they are strong, biting, and only for the few
that are immune to the residual effects.
 The House of Yes is extreme even for the realm of dark comedy.  It is one
part British parlor drama, one part My Dinner with Andre with a sense of
humor, and one part psychological thriller.
 The Pascal house is one of those upper-crust homes outside of Washington
where the neighborhood was born rich and will die rich.  They live next door
to the Kennedy's and feel a perpetual envy towards that group.  They spend
time being the last bastion of American royalty: the blue blood rich.
 On Thanksgiving, 1983, 20 years after the assassination of JFK, the Pascal
family has gathered for their Thanksgiving holiday in the midst of a
hurricane.  On the regular roster of invitations are the three full-time
residential Pascals, mother (Genevieve Bujold), little brother Anthony
(Freddie Prinze Jr.) and older sister Jackie-O (Parker Posey).  Coming back
from his home in New York City is Marty (Josh Hamilton).  Marty has brought
along his fiancée Lesly (Tori Spelling), a blue collar to their blue blood
who was born in Pennsylvania and works as a waitress at a Doughnut King.
 Of course, as with all families of blue blood we have the hidden secrets.
Begin with the fact that Jackie-O is insane.  So insane, in fact, that she
wore a Pink Chanel suit with fake blood and brains on it to the Ides of
March party after Kennedy was assassinated.  One could normally write this
off as a morbid sense of humor combined with a complete lack of tack and
presence of bad taste, but Jackie-O's madness goes far beyond that.  In the
opening frames she begins obsessing over the aesthetic difference in hair
brushed with a comb and brushed with a brush, so you can tell she ain't
playing with a full deck of marbles.
 Like The Ice Storm, the whether serves as an appropriate backdrop to the
situation.  As the hurricane approaches the eye, the situation gets worse
and worse.  When the storm has finally passed, the movie is over.
 This serves as an example of the weakest aspect of the movie, which is
surprisingly the direction and not the presence of Tori Spelling, which for
once strengthens the film.  All of the performances are top-notch with the
exception of Genevieve Bujold, who annoys me despite the fact that I have
never seen her before.  On the good side, she plays a bit part.
 As anyone who has seen the previews or heard anything about the film knows,
this is a comedy about incest and the Kennedy assassination.  Although it
may not be as blatantly dark a blend as Very Bad Things, The House of Yes
comes damn close.  So, unless you're ready for a complete blast of darkness,
step back and let someone else rent it.

I must admit that I've never understood the fixation that many people have
with the Kennedys.  Sure, one can point out a number of positive things JFK
achieved during his presidency, but if you study history, you'll also find
that he was quite an opportunist, pumping the nation full of such rhetoric
as to fuel the Cold War and send the country's young men down a path that
led deep into the jungles of Vietnam and Cambodia, all in the name of going
anywhere and fighting any fight, apparently with little regard to the real
elements of national security, or the real meaning of honor.  The man took
risks like approving the poorly-planned and disaster-ridden Bay of Pigs
invasion (Kennedy served in the South Pacific as a PT Boat commander during
World War II, yet consented to an amphibious landing that benefited from no
air support).  He took the nation to the brink of nuclear holocaust one
October in the biggest gamble this nation has ever waged.  I therefore found
it very difficult to get into a movie where the main character is
preoccupied with the lives of John F. and Jacqueline Kennedy.  However, it
was somewhat comforting to know that this character is also supposed to be
insane.
THE HOUSE OF YES is a comedy which starts out with that television special
from the early 60's where Jackie Kennedy takes the nation on a tour of the
White House, intercut with a home movie from the early 70's with a young
girl dressed up as the first lady, taking the viewer on a tour of her own
mansion.  We are then brought to the present day, and are introduced to that
young girl, now grown up, and we find that she has gotten her family to call
her Jackie-O.  We are also told by her narrative voice that at the age of
14, she went to a costume party in a replication of the famous pink dress
Mrs. Kennedy wore on that fateful day in Dallas, covered with ketchup for
blood and macaroni for brains.  Very disturbing.
Jackie-O (Parker Posey) is indeed certifiable.  She has spent time in a
mental institution and is on a string of medications.  When her twin brother
Marty (Josh Hamilton), now living in New York, comes home to the family's
Washington D.C. mansion for Thanksgiving dinner and brings his new fiancee,
Lesly (Tori Spelling), Jackie-O goes absolutely ballistic.  Within minutes,
it seems that Jackie-O, her mother (Genevieve Bujold), and her younger
brother Anthony (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) are all trying to break up the happy
couple.  Why?  And why is Jackie-O so enamored with Jackie O.?  The answer
lies in more than one family secret.
One of the first mental notes I took upon viewing THE HOUSE OF YES was that
the dialogue is hilarious, but sounds like it was meant for the stage.
Delivery, wordplay; it's all much like musical theater in between the songs,
or perhaps Shakespearean comedy.  I later found out that this film is, in
fact, based upon a play by Wendy McLeod.  Where it was performed or how well
it did, I have no idea.  Director Mark Waters clearly wanted to translate
that feel directly to film, and it's a bit off-putting at first.  However,
you quickly get used to it and can enjoy the rest of the film, which is
actually quite funny.
The problem is that the movie is also very predictable.  Inside of the first
ten minutes, you're able to put in a good guess as to what both the primary
and secondary family secrets are.  Sure, the dialogue still makes the film
enjoyable, but mostly you're just watching the mechanics as it gets to where
you know it's going in the first place.  As the movie progresses, precious
little additional information is revealed about each of the characters.  A
little more character development would also have really helped.  There are
also moments in this film that are so done up with music and slow motion
that you get the feeling that Waters wants to make you believe you're
witness to something profound.  It is at these times that the film simply
takes itself too seriously.
One of the things this film does well is depict alienation.  Anthony is the
little brother who seems to get kicked around and has spent most of his life
trying to keep up with his siblings.  He gets told what to do by everyone in
the house, and try as he might to rectify the situation, he's still low man
on the totem pole.  Lesly, trying to make a good impression, is only
rejected by Jackie-O and her mother for reasons obscure to her until the
very end.  Even Marty, mindful at first of her feelings, soon becomes party
to her persecution as an outsider.  A scene where Lesly terribly plays a
chopsticks piano duet with Marty, and is then "shown how it's done" by
Jackie-O as she sidles up next to her brother on the piano bench, is
heart-wrenching.
Ultimately, however, it's the acting in THE HOUSE OF YES that really stands
out.  The cast is admittedly small, but all five actors deliver exceptional
performances.  Parker Posey is being hailed as the queen of independent
films, and it's no wonder.  She's acted in nearly two dozen of them, and has
effectively portrayed a wide variety of characters, displaying an impressive
range and competence not found in the majority of Hollywood newcomers (or
big names, for that matter).  In this film, she's really got the polish on,
doing an incredible job as the always-on-the-edge Jackie-O.  One minute she
seems sweet as sugar, the next she's being caustically sarcastic, and then
she's suddenly flipping out like a nutcase - and it's all totally convincing
as well as a pleasure to watch.
Freddie Prinze, Jr. does a nice job playing the little brother who seems to
get kicked around and has spent most of his life trying to keep up with his
siblings.  Genevieve Bujold is also apt at playing the mother who is
disapproving of anything outside of her own family.  Josh Hamilton as Marty
interacts well with all the characters, perhaps since his is the most normal
in the film, and is the one with which we most identify.  Most surprising,
however, is Tori Spelling.  I've never really liked her in anything, largely
because it seems she plays the same character so often (or maybe it's the
same character I keep seeing - how long was she on 90210, anyway?), but here
she actually impressed me with her performance as a girl from humble roots
who, in spite of her vacuous persona, still has more substance than everyone
in Jackie-O's household combined.  My opinion of her improved considerably
after viewing this film.
Although THE HOUSE OF YES is laden with an imbalance between its acting
talent on the one hand, and it's direction and scripting on the other, it's
still an enjoyable film, as the former kind of makes up for the latter.
However, I kept getting the feeling that with a more fleshed-out screenplay,
this film could have been something really great.

Miramax / 1:30 / 1997 / R (language, violence, perverse sexual theme) 
Cast: Parker Posey; Josh Hamilton; Freddie Prinze, Jr.; Tori Spelling; 
Genevieve Bujold 
Director: Mark Waters 
Screenplay: Mark Waters 
The characters in the pitch-black comedy "The House of Yes" have so many 
family scandals and disturbing secrets hanging over their heads that 
they make the Kennedy clan seem like the Waltons -- an odd comparison, 
because the Kennedy legacy plays a very active part here. This 
five-person adaptation of Wendy MacLeod's stage play mines 
extraordinarily dark material to get its laughs, and whether you find 
the finished product distasteful or uproarious, it's unarguably daring. 
Parker Posey, a versatile actress who frequently appears in independent 
films, has the lead here. She plays Jackie-O Pascal, an unbalanced young 
woman who models herself in style and appearance after the same- 
nicknamed former First Lady. On the eve of Thanksgiving in 1983 (20
years after the Kennedy assassination), the Pascal household -- which 
includes her younger brother Anthony (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) and mother 
(Genevieve Bujold) -- are anxiously awaiting the arrival of Marty (Josh 
Hamilton), Jackie-O's twin brother who's visiting for several days. When 
Marty does show up, a hurricane begins to rage outside the Washington 
D.C. estate. There's also a storm inside, because Marty brings along his 
fiancee Lesly (Tori Spelling) -- a fiancee he has not yet told his 
family about. 
Jackie-O takes the news worst of all, locking herself in a bathroom and 
leaving Anthony and Mrs. Pascal to entertain Lesly with strange stories 
of which the less said, the better. After Jackie-O collects herself and 
joins the party downstairs, it becomes quite clear that this is going to 
be no ordinary Thanksgiving dinner. And when the lightening causes a 
power failure and Mrs. Pascal turns in for the night, leaving the 
remaining four to fend for themselves, events take a strange turn --
Jackie-O tries to jumpstart a bond she shares with her twin sibling and 
Anthony does his best at attempting to seduce Lesly. 
You get a reaction from "The House of Yes" -- apparently called such 
because inside, just about anything goes -- not too long after it opens, 
around the time Mrs. Pascal makes an unprintable reference about the 
nature of Jackie-O and Marty's birth. It becomes quite clear then what 
warped territory it's going to explore, and you either find it absurdly 
audacious or downright unholy. If you fall into the former category, 
you've got to give director/screenwriter Mark Waters credit for having
the guts to milk many belly laughs from such perverse material. If 
you're in the latter, "The House of Yes" will likely make you very 
uncomfortable. 
A small but priceless cast backs Waters up all the way. Posey clearly 
has fun with her extremely topsy-turvy role, and her delivery alone is 
worth the Special Recognition for Acting award she received at this 
year's Sundance Film Festival. Hamilton is well-used as her foil; coming 
from such duds as "With Honors" the people-who-eat-people flick "Alive," 
Marty Pascal is probably his best part yet. Bujold does nice, eccentric 
work even if her character is underwritten, and Spelling does an 
interesting riff on her goody-goody "Beverly Hills 90210" image. If 
there's a scene-stealer, though, it's definitely Prinze, who goes from 
giddy naivety to deadpan deviousness with appealing enthusiasm. 
The fall of "The House of Yes" is that it comes apart at a climax which 
attempts to tie too many sketchy plot details (Mr. Pascal's mysterious 
disappearance the day Kennedy was shot, for instance) with a conclusion 
that's dramatically unsatisfying. Unfortunately, I can't say exactly how
without giving away a few key plot details that are meant to shock. 
Let's just say the last 15 minutes or so are a cheap attempt to wrap 
things up all too quickly. That's a shame, because all of these 
characters are delicious creations, each of whom sustains enough 
personality for his or her own film. 
It's not likely that any of this matters, though, because not a lot of 
people will see "The House of Yes" anyway, and therefore it should only 
spend a few weeks in the art houses before being remembered as one of 
Miramax's more outrageous indie features. Mainstream audiences won't see
it because of it plays such potentially troubling matters for laughs 
(remember "Citizen Ruth"?). The rest of us -- and we know who we are -- 
will go, and generally have a good time.

       Playing a fetching psychopath, Parker Posey puts a serrated
       edge on the mostly innocuous THE HOUSE OF YES, a comedy of
       early-80s manners that coops up three siblings, a matriarch,
       and an outsider in the family home over Thanksgiving night
       while a storm rages outside. Posey is Jackie-O Pascal, a
       well-practiced Jacqueline Onassis fetishist who's dangerous
       when she's unmedicated. She can't be accused of good taste --
       she pays homage to the Kennedy dynasty by dolling herself up
       in a pink suit and pillbox hat, a la the more famous Jackie
       O. At a costume party, she once added a blotch of ketchup and
       a dollop of macaroni to the outfit to, um, accent the
       ensemble with mock blood and brain matter from a certain
       assassinated president.
       It's not that our Jackie-O is simply an American history buff
       with a grisly bent. Also among her issues is a longstanding
       sexual relationship with her twin brother Marty (Josh
       Hamilton), who is helpless to resist her charms. (They
       reenact the Kennedy assassination together, Marty sitting
       upright and waving vacantly.) The soaking-wet outsider is
       Leslie (Tori Spelling), whom Marty has brought home for the
       holiday to introduce as his fiance. (Daggers from Jackie's
       eyes, natch.) But before the night is over, Marty and Jackie
       will pair off to, um, discuss old times. Meanwhile, awkward
       younger brother Anthony (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) already has
       designs on Leslie. As the matronly Mrs. Pascal, Genevieve
       Bujold hovers disapprovingly over the proceedings.
       Wackiness ensues, leading up to the third-act introduction of
       a loaded gun into the housebound milieu. (If you guessed this
       was based on a stage play, you're absolutely right.) THE
       HOUSE OF YES is fitfully funny, but I can't help but think it
       missed an opportunity to be truly bizarre. Although it's been
       compared to the bold work of Noel Coward, Harold Pinter, and
       Tennessee Williams (!), it retreats too readily to the
       shelter of self-conscious absurdity. The movie saves itself
       from its own staginess by being aggressively artificial, and
       nobody is better at playing that game than Posey, who can
       imbue even the most honeyed line with the flutter of latent
       wickedness. The result is a black comedy that's oddly
       agreeable. The outrageousness is parlayed with a wink, and
       the campy performances reflect the melodrama that seems to
       infect every corner of the Pascal family's daily life. Only
       Spelling, doing an uncanny imitation of a fish out of water,
       doesn't seem to be in on the joke.

     Norman Rockwell would not approve of what the movies are doing to
Thanksgiving.  Once upon a time, the fourth Thursday in November was the
place where Americana accumulated:  loved ones, football games, a golden
roasted bird and pleasant conversation.  That was before the idea of a
stable, happy family became tres declasse.  A couple of years ago,
director Jodie Foster depicted a Midwestern family dissolving under the
stress of being HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS.  This fall, no fewer than three new
releases -- THE ICE STORM, THE MYTH OF FINGERPRINTS and THE HOUSE OF YES
-- are turning Turkey Day into Dysfunction Junction.
     At least Mark Waters, screenwriter and director of THE HOUSE OF YES,
seems to understand that the recrimination-filled holiday gathering has
already become a film cliche.  THE HOUSE OF YES is a black comedy not at
all concerned about making its family feuds a touch surreal.  Those feuds
involve the Pascal clan of Washington, D.C., and they take place on
Thanksgiving day 1983.  The year is significant because it marks the 20th
anniversary of the assassination of President Kennedy, a date which holds
even more significance for the Pascals than for most Americans.  You see,
it was on November 22, 1963 that Papa Pascal disappeared never to be seen
again, cementing the fixation of a daughter known as Jackie-O (Parker
Posey) with the widowed First Lady.  Jackie is equally obsessed with her
twin brother Marty (Josh Hamilton), who shakes up the family by bringing
home his fiancee Lesly (Tori Spelling).  While Mother (Genvieve Bujold)
doesn't try at all to make Lesly feel at home, and younger brother Anthony
(Freddie Prinze Jr.) tries a bit _too_ hard, Marty's attempt to find a
normal life begins to collapse under the weight of family secrets.
     Waters adapted THE HOUSE OF YES from a play by Wendy MacLeod, and you
can hear the theatrical roots in every line of dialogue.  Posey, Prinze
and Bujold exchange clipped quips with the practiced air of a company in
mid-run, lines building on top of one another at a dizzying pace.  Waters'
direction also tends towards the conventional, usually holding the speaker
in medium shot then shifting immediately to the next speaker.
     Ordinarily, a production this uniformly stagy would feel forced and
awkward on the screen, but not THE HOUSE OF YES.  As it turns out, this is
a story of overly dramatic people living a self-conscious soap opera.
Jackie-O performs every minute of every day, dominating the Pascal
household like a hammy actor dominates the stage, while her mother glides
in and out of rooms like a condescending WASP matriarch from central
casting.  Appropriately enough (if unexpectedly), Tori Spelling delivers
the film's most naturalistic performance; the rest of this clan is like
the Addams family, so immersed in their own singularly demented world that
they don't even see anything out of the ordinary.  The script also keeps
the wicked humor coming so regularly that you may not notice the arch
deliveries (or at least not mind them).  The dialogue is fast, funny and
quirky enough to defuse some touchy subject matter.  For most of the
film's running time, Waters refuses to treat the Pascals' family skeletons
as tragedies.  
     It's late in the film when THE HOUSE OF YES takes its most
ill-advised turn, going exactly the somber and serious route it had so
carefully side-stepped.  The last shot in particular seems to ask for a
careful psychological analysis, potentially rendering Jackie-O as a
guiltless, misunderstood victim.  It's a jarring miscalculation which
takes a satire of dysfunction dramas and turns it into something which
leaves a dysfunction drama taste in your mouth.  THE HOUSE OF YES should
have stuck with what it was doing best:  providing an alternative
Thanksgiving meal, something salty and bitter without a trace of
saccharine.

THE HOUSE OF YES
 By Harvey Karten, Ph.D.
 Miramax Films/Spelling Films
 Director:  Mark Waters
 Writer:  Mark Waters
 Cast: Parker Posey, Josh Hamilton, Tori Spelling, Freddie
Prinze, Jr., Genevieve Bujold, Rachael Leigh Cook
   A question that looms over movies like "Home for the
Holidays" and "The Myth of Fingerprints" is, "Why would
people like Claudia (Holly Hunter) and Warren (Noah Wylie)
want to return to their dysfunctional families after having
successfully escaped from their clutches?"  Perhaps it's guilt,
maybe curiosity.  "Fingerprints" opens on a therapy session
as Warren informs his analyst that he is returning after three
years--he knows not why.  Now, in "The House of Yes," the
one family member who has fled the nest, Marty (Josh
Hamilton). is returning to his lavish digs to introduce his new
girl friend, Lesly (Tori Spelling), a waitress in a doughnut pub. 
He does not reappear from a sense of either guilt of curiosity. 
Something there is about the titled house of yes that draws
him, a magnetic allure that tows back to the fold someone
who has had exceptionally pleasant memories but who had
nonetheless deserted because of the wildly dysfunctional
atmosphere.
   The house itself exudes wealth.  A pillared mansion in an
upscale Washington suburb, the house of yes is composed of
the absolutely off-the-wall, psychotic Jackie-O (Parker Posey),
in and out of mental institutions and marginally normal when
she takes her medication.  She is watched over by a mom
who is by comparison only mildly eccentric, Mrs. Pascal
(Genevieve Bujold), who keeps a vigil as well over a young
man of about eighteen years, Anthony (Freddie Prinze, Jr.). 
Jackie-O at once point got her fifteen minutes of fame by
appearing at a party dressed as Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis
just after her husband was assassinated: her dress is covered
with ketchup and spaghetti, just one of the various sick jokes
in Mark Water's debut production.
   The production, which follows the unities of time, place and
action, unfolds exclusively inside the mansion on the night of
a hurricane, and manifests all the stiffness of a filmed play. 
Adapted from a staged work by Wendy MacLeod--whose
contributions to the theater include "Apocalyptic Butterflies,
"The Lost Colony," and "The Shallow End"--the dark, five-
person comedy often has the artificial look of a work which
has simply been filmed during a live presentation.  As a
consequence, spontaneity is sacrificed and lines which should
have been hilarious seem like words spoken by a small group
rehearsing their dialogue, straining for shock value.  
   While much of literature deals with the problems of families
too poor to enjoy the options which life can afford, "The
House of Yes" considers a family which has been spoiled to
the point of insanity by never having heard the word "no." 
Two of its members have indulged themselves for years in the
universal taboo of incest.  The attraction between Jackie-O
and her twin brother Marty is so compelling that--the tale
hints--Jackie-O will kill rather than allow any woman to stand
in the way of her passion for her brother.  As their mom
happily announces to the Thanksgiving guest, "Marty and
Jackie belong to each other...she was holding Marty's penis
when they come out of the womb."
   This wacky story, which could be considered by some to
evoke the glittery ambiance of Noel Coward overlaid by the
menace of Harold Pinter--is actually closer in genre to the 
writer Arthur Kopit's play, "Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung
You in the Closet and I'm Feeling So Sad."  The tension
comes from the baiting of Marty's innocent, Pennsylvania-
raised girl friend Lesly (Tori Spelling) by the sophisticated but
quite loony and homicidal Jackie-O.  As you might expect,
Lesly is virtually eaten alive in this mad mad household, while
the film gleefully flashes back to expose glimpses of Jackie-O
imitating Jackie O., then cross-cut with scenes of the real
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis giving a televised tour of the
White House.  (Some of these actual black-and-white clips
from the sixties seem to us nowadays as unintentionally
absurdist comedy.)
   "The House of Yes" is, then, decidedly offbeat comedy
played out by performers who appear to know one another
quite well and to be having a grand time duplicating patterns
of sheer dementia.  Genevieve Bujold is made up to resemble
a crone, a mother-in-law from hell who is as determined as
her off-the-wall daughter to keep the family intact and free
from the influence of normal outsiders.  Obviously not for
every taste, "The House of Yes" scores high for originality and
gleeful bad taste, but is limited by its overall look of artificial
staging. Rated R.  Running Time: 87 minutes.  (C) 1997

The House of Yes (1997) * out of ***** - Cast: Parker Posey, Josh
Hamilton, Tori Spelling, Freddie Prinze Jr., Genevieve Bujold.  Written
and Directed by: Mark Waters.  Running Time: 85 minutes.
Boy, there's nothing like a good dysfunctional family story.  Too bad "The
House of Yes" is a HORRIBLE dysfunctional family story.
"The House of Yes" is set at Thanksgiving in 1983.  Parker Posey plays
Jackie-O, a mentally disturbed woman who believes she's Jackie
Kennedy-Onassis.  Her brother (...) is coming home for the holiday and she
just couldn't be happier.  To her dismay however, he has brought along a
surprise: a fiancee (Tori Spelling, in a surprisingly good performance).
Things immediately turn ugly.  You see, there's a reason Jackie-O has gone
insane.  She and her brother just happened to be lovers for quite some
time.  They liked playing a game where they would re-enact the Kennedy
assassination and then proceed to have sex.  Hard to believe that could
mentally disturb someone isn't it?  I was disturbed enough to break into
sweats and cower in the fetal position just watching it.  Anyway, for some
reason they just can't resist this game once he returns home, much to the
disgust of his fiance and the younger brother in the family.
"The House of Yes" was adapted from a stage play by Wendy MacLeod, and the
fact that it was a stage play is warning sign number one.  There's a
reason some stories are told on stage and some on screen.  And the film
plays exactly as if it was a play, aside for moments of obnoxiously
blaring score music that come out of nowhere, usually announcing the
incest which is about to be happening.  Speaking of incest, I guess that
would have to be warning sign number two.  Need any other warning signs to
save yourself from this film?  [R]

The boyfriend brings his fiance home to meet his disfunctional family...how
many times have we seen this set-up?  In "The House of Yes," this is what
happens, only the film throws us a couple weird pitches, keeping us off
guard and generally freaking us out like no film bearing this cliche has in
recent memory.  For one, they're all much weirder, and for another one, one
of his family members...well, thinks she's Jackie Onassis.  Instead of
being just a cheap comedy, it has become a cheap, elongated "Tales From the
Crypt" episode.
The film opens by introducing the whole "Jackie Onassis" obsession, which
inhibits the one daughter (Parker Posey, making her 97 rounds in indie/art
house films) in the family, who goes by "Jackie-O," but whether her name
really is Jackie, we never discover.  In the opening credits, we see her as
a young child in the early 70s being filmed doing an impersonation of
Jackie Onassis, complete with the pink dress and pill box hat.  We later
discover that the obsession with Jackie Onassis is a result of the
disappearance of their father on the day Kennedy was assasinated.  Okay...
The real plot of the film deals with, as I said, the one brother, Marty
(Josh Hamilton), bringing home his perky fiance, Lesly (Tori Spelling -
yes, you read correctly), to meet his family, who live in a giant mansion
in D.C.  There, she meets his family members: his freaky mother (Genevičve
Bujold, who I thought was dead), a reclusive bizarre nut; his dorky and
clueless brother, Anthony (Freddie Prinze Jr., who played the boring
boyfriend in "I Know What You Did Last Summer"); and...Jackie-O, who is
infactuated with him so much that when she hears of the engagement, she
screams and runs off to comb her hair.
Taking place on Thanksgiving night, we are introduced to one weird evening
where the disfunctions of the family take off, and some extremely weird
things and facts are introduced.  Anthony finds he lusts after Lesly, and
begins to comfort her as the evening goes on...in his own blunt way (which
means trying to get her to talk to him in what he thinks is "Girl Talk"). 
And we discover that Jackie-O is: a) totally insane (duh!), b) just got
back from the hospital, and c) had sex with Marty when they were kids and
still holds a torch for him.
This is pretty much all the film is, and that becomes a big problem because
we discover that the only thing this film has to offer is some really weird
things, like incest and obsessions with Jackie Onassis.  "The House of Yes"
has nothing much to offer in terms of characterization, depth, even some
kind of message (although I guess the message of this film is...families
are weird).  So what it does is pull out as many controversial jokes as it
can, intending to shock the audience into appreaciating the film.
This is what's wrong with the film.  Because it doesn't have the guts to go
any deeper with the themes and ideas it introduces, it becomes shallow and
pretty much redundant.  By the ending, you're just hoping that the film
will suddenly perk up, dive deep into what we saw before, and expand on
them.  It doesn't.  Everything introduced is pretty much just a contrivance
to freak us out; I mean, why exactly did the writer chose Jackie Onassis to
be the obsession if the film is never going to do anything with it but
stage an addmittingly humorous enactment of the assasination?
But granted, the film has many strong points that kinda save it.  For one,
there are some really great one-liners and exchanges, even if the script
isn't all that great.  The acting is also pretty good, with all the actors
doing good jobs (Freddie Prinze Jr is a terrible actor, but his bad acting
works with the character for some reason, and Tori Spelling finds all the
right notes for her part).  One of the biggest shocks for me was to see
Genevičve Bujold, who has pretty much been floundering since the late 70s. 
She gives a pretty incredible and comical performance.
But the real star of the show is Parker Posey, who does what has to be the
best acting of her short yet lengthy career thus far.  She goes completely
over the top with her performance, and watching her do her schtick is one
of the real pleasures of watching this film.  If any performance would
define Posey as an actress and make her a star, it's this.
It's too bad she wasn't in a better film, as "The House of Yes" is a really
disappointing little film.  It has some great ideas and all, but the fact
that it never does a thing with them (probably because the writer wanted it
to be really short) is what becomes wrong with this film.  I will say this
though: the film is pretty comical, and yes, I laughed several times
throughout it.  And the film held my attention the whole time, which is
something to be commended.  Of course, the flip-side of that is I was
waiting for something to really happen.

HOUSE OF YES, THE (director/writer: Mark Waters; screenwriter: from a
Wendy MacLeod play; cinematographer: Michael Spiller; cast: Parker Posey
(Jackie-O), Josh Hamilton (Marty), Tori Spelling (Lesly), Freddie Prinze
Jr. (Anthony), Genevieve Bujold (Mrs. Pascal), 1997)
This successful NYC Wendy MacLeod play, a black comedy about a
dysfunctional nuclear family, revolves around Parker's (Jackie-O)
obsession with the Kennedy assassination, and is chock-full of ironies
(Jackie confuses Kennedy's death with her father's flight from home on
that same day in 1963).
The film's major fault is that it is too stagy a production.
Parker is fond of dressing up as Jackie-O (wearing a tacky pink suit and
pillbox hat around her Georgetown mansion) and reenacting the Kennedy
assassination with her twin brother, Marty, played by Josh Hamilton,
acting as the president. She once shot him with real bullets during one
of those stagings, when she thought he would be leaving her. Their
relationship includes incest, something he feels isn't normal even if he
derives great satisfaction from it. But, she doesn't agree with him on
his judgment about what is or is not normal. She is, of course, a
certifiable nut job, committed to a mental institution after the
shooting incident.
Parker is still overly possessed with her twin brother, even though he
is now living in NYC and wishes to stay clear of her for good. The other
brother, Anthony, is played by Prinze, with a panache for bringing out
his character's creepiness. He is weird, slow-witted and obnoxious, but
he does not have the same kind of depraved sexual relationship with
Parker as Josh does. Bujold is the eccentric mother, who might or might
not have killed her husband the day after the Kennedy assassination. He
might have just left them like the family claims happened. In any case,
he no longer lives with them in their Washington mansion and has not
been heard from since.
During a 1983 Thanksgiving Day hurricane, Josh pays a surprise visit to
the family, so that he can introduce his fiance (Tori) to them. She is
cute but not too swift, and is as straight as an arrow. Josh likes the
fact that she is so ordinary and is happy that she works in a donut
shop, and is almost ecstatic that she is witless. She is naturally
nervous about meeting the family, and knows nothing about their infamous
history.The only one in the family who takes a liking to her is Prinze,
who wishes to take her away from his brother. Mother hates her with a
passion and Jackie- O can't wait to get rid of her. I found Tori's
performance to be lacking in spunk, especially when compared to the fine
ensemble cast she is surrounded by.
How much you like this film depends on your idea of comedy and how much
tolerance you have for "sick humor." If this kind of parody over the
tragedy that rocked the country, upsets you, and you think it is in bad
taste, then you shouldn't see this film. If your reaction is like mine,
then you will find that when this picture is on the mark, which is quite
often, you will laugh aloud, and when it misses the mark, you might even
wince. The real flaw in the film is when it starts to take its comedy
seriously and thinks it has to explain itself and come up with an
academic explanation for the Parker character's obsession. It would have
been better to have just ridden the comedy out and have been criticized
by those who didn't like where the comedy was going. It seemed
unnecessary to have changed the mood of the film and all of sudden
offered some psychological explanations for Jacki-O' behavior.
The staple in the film was Parker Posey, the princess of the indie
film.  She, simply, steals the film.
