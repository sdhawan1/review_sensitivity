"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie" is a very good
film with an excellent script.  It may be a tough
sitting for those who prefer action flicks or
comedies, but those interesting in dialogue and
character studies will enjoy it.
The film takes place in Edinburgh, England in 1932.
Jean Brodie (Maggie Smith) is a history teacher at
a private school for girls.  Her romantic liasons
with passionate art teacher Teddy (Robert Stephens)
and a well-intentioned music teacher (Gordon Jackson),
as well as her radical pro-fascist political views,
put her at odds with the formidable, conservative
headmaster (Celia Johnson).  But Brodie remains popular
with the girls in her class, especially insightful Sandy
(Pamela Franklin), stammering Mary (Jane Carr), and
serene beauty Jenny (Diane Grayson).
Vanessa Redgrave had played Brodie in the stage
production, and was originally cast in the role.
However, she was unavailable when the film production
began.  Maggie Smith took the part and won the Oscar for
Best Actress for her performance.  Celia Johnson won
Best Supporting Actress in the British Academy Awards.
The major strength of "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"
comes from the script, which is excellent.  The dialogue
provides great depth and credibility to the major characters,
and the direction by Ronald Neame is careful to show the
facial reactions of the characters to key lines.
The syrupy, string-laden Rod McKuen theme is the film's
most obvious weakness.  One minor complaint: it is
difficult to believe that a painter can't avoid putting
his lover's face in every portrait.  Also, the affair
between Teddy and Sandy is given slight treatment, and
you would think that Brodie would be furious rather than
merely stunned upon her betrayal.
