    It's almost amusing to watch 21-year old Christina Ricci get drastically 
overshadowed in Sally Potter's follow-up to 1997's The Tango Lesson, The Man 
Who Cried. The gen-Y actress, with her cold stare and big, black eyes, has 
appeared in an impressive range of films; but she doesn't even come close to 
being the bold heroine the film, set against the historical backdrop of World 
War 2, requires her to be.  Ricci, whose character is shockingly silent and 
blank, showing only the occasional smile or hint of concern, shares most of 
her scenes with the astounding Cate Blanchett: quite an amusing sight to 
behold.  Blanchett's Lola, a Paris dwelling dancer who befriends the aspiring 
singer Suzie, is bold, interesting and layeredeverything our heroine lacks. 
 Co-star of the upcoming Lord of the Rings trilogy, Blanchett has a good 
seven inches on Ricci, sports twice the makeup and dons a flashy wardrobe. 
 The actress inhabits the roleas she always so remarkably doeswith a 
fervor and life that makes you want her to hold the screen as the film's lead 
rather than her dull companion. 
     Important historical events involving Hitler and his Nazis scatter 
themselves across the film; these landmarks serve as the film's little 
conflict.  Obviously, the tables are turned in the life of Suzie by these 
events, whose Jewish origin is unknown among her Parisian colleagues. 
     The Man Who Cried has many aspirations, none of which come full circle 
by the film's close.  There are forced messages here and there: "Go forward; 
always go forward," Lola preaches to Suzie; there's romance between Suzie and 
a fellow target of Hitler's Nazis, the gypsy Cesar (Johnny Depp, who, like 
Ricci, barely gets to speak); Lola struggles with her character that desires 
above all things wealth and men who have it; and at the core of all these 
devices lies Suzie's desire to travel to America, where her father journeyed 
after leaving her and her mother years ago. 
     The film's main problem is that Potter isn't skilled enough to tell the 
epic-sized story of Suzie.  The time period's instability, the conflicting 
social classes, the prejudice against Suzie from all those around her in her 
new life: serving as both writer and director, Potter throws in some of each, 
but hardly an inch of depth is to be found in any.  By the time the 
sigh-inducing climax hits, the believability and complete absence of focus 
leave one ready to leave the theater.  The film's falling action is weirdly 
unsatisfying and unlikely; are we really meant to believe any of this could 
happen? Contrastingly, in its moving final scene, The Man Who Cried strikes a 
note that is made effective in its ties to the emotional beginning of the 
film. 
     Although it's apparent that Potter can't grasp what she reaches, I'm 
puzzled as to why she reaches for so much in the first place.  Ricci's Suzie 
is meant to be the film's core: from the extended flashback at the film's 
beginning to the quickly drawn ending, everything seen in the film, in some 
way, relates to her.  So why then does Potter spend so much time on subplots 
involving other individuals?  The character of Suzie is too present for The 
Man Who Cried to work as an ensemble, but not present enough for the film to 
be Ricci's.      
     The almost constant lack of flow and one-note tone with which Potter 
depicts The Man Who Cried are somewhat improved upon by Sacha Vierny's 
beautiful cinematography that renders the film's various locations 
wonderfully.  Also worthy of note are Lindy Hemming's costumes that help to 
depict the area quite nicely.   
     And then there's the music.  From minute one to minute ninety-seven, 
there's hardly a moment when the wavering, skilled voice of an opera singer 
or the rhythms of the gypsy music don't undercut the action; the notes 
stricken both overwhelm (particularly John Turturro, portraying fictional 
opera singer Dante Dominio, whose money and reputation catch Lola's interest) 
and accompany (oftentimes, the perfect chords are captured to undermine the 
state of the film's characters and reinforce that state).  Potter obviously 
cares much about each and every musical note; unfortunately, the same effort 
isn't given towards (almost) everything else.

In 1927, a doting father (Oleg Yankovsky, "Mute Witness") seemingly lives 
an idyllic life with his young daughter (Claudia Lander-Duke) in rural Russia.
Convinced by a visitting relative to try his luck in America, he ruefully
leaves the tiny girl with his mother (Hana Maria Pravda).  As their shtetl
is being burned to the ground, Grandmother gives her to escaping strangers, 
along with some gold coins and a photograph of her father.  After a horrific 
journey, she's named Suzie by an English port official (Clifford Barry), 
discovered to have a singing voice, and eventually lands in Paris (grown up,
played by Christina Ricci), but her goal remains America in "The Man Who
Cried."
Written and directed by Sally Potter ("Orlando, "The Tango Lesson), "The
Man Who Cried" is an odd amalgamation of filmmaking - good performances
admist luckluster and over the top, on location filming mixed with obviously
artificial set pieces, and a weirdly titled tale that, while nothing new, 
somehow remains engaging.  It's a survivor story set against a historical
background writ from the movie screen.
Suzie, presumed a Brit, gets a job in a cabaret and meets Lola (Cate 
Blanchett), a fellow Russian out to land a wealthy man.  He arrives in the
person of Dante (John Turturro), an egotistical Italian opera singer in
the stage company of Felix Perlman (Harry Dean Stanton).  Lola gets herself 
and Suzie jobs in its chorus and soon she's keeping company with Dante,
(who's most interested to learn Suzie's secret when he spies her father's
picture).  Suzie gravitates towards Cesar (Johnny Depp), a gypsy of few 
words who rides a white stallion onto the stage every night (much to Dante's 
chagrin).  The gypsy way of life reminds Suzie of her Jewish heritage and 
Cesar presents an alternative to the quest for her father.
But the lines are clearly drawn for these four characters with the onset
of WWII and the Nazi occupation of Paris.  (Their fate is economically summed
up with a crane shot of a vaguely Naziish prop looming over Dante 
and Suzie, faced off on the stage below.)
Potter opens her film with credits rolling over her heroine (Ricci), fighting
for life in a dark ocean (clearly a tank) surrounded by burning debris and
water.  Fire and mist continue as leitmotifs throughout the film, although what 
they symbolize is a mystery (the lack of solid ground afforded Suzie?).
The steam rising from a bowl of soup becomes the most predominant (and oddly
hypnotic) element of a shot.  Visually, "The Man Who Cried" is often stunning,
featuring slow-mo closeups of Suzie, costumed for an ornate outdoor tableau,
or Cesar performing stunts on horseback through the nighttime streets of Paris.
A shot of young Suzie stubbornly clutching the heavily framed portrait of
her father (it's almost as big as she is) while terror reigns around her is
haunting.  (Cinematography is by Sacha Vierny, "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife 
and Her Lover" and "Prospero's Books").
Ricci plays Suzie largely as an impassive observer.  This, combined
with Ricci's otherworldly appearance, makes for an empathetic portrayal of an 
intelligent survivor who's not what she appears to be.  A shy smile for 
Cesar is hard won and takes on more weight.  Blanchett continues to amaze with 
her ability to transform herself.  Peroxide blonde Lola targets Dante like a 
heat-seeking missile and Blanchett does the heavily-accented flirt well.  She 
also brings urgency and regret to her character when she must face 
the inevitable.  Depp recycles his role from "Chocolat" as a man of even lesser
words.  Potter objectifies him, but Depp gets across the simple points - anger
at oppression, love for his family.  Turturro, however, relies on theatrical
posing and grandstanding in a two dimensional performance.  Harry Dean Stanton
is quietly convincing, lending an air of melancholy to his democratic 
businessman.  Young Claudia Lander-Duke looks like Ricci and her stoicism 
meshes well into Ricci's portrayal of the character.
"The Man Who Cried" is an off kilter work from a visual, overtly 
romantic director.

Writer and director Sally Potter (THE TANGO LESSON), who has a 
propensity for crafting sumptuous music and visuals while having 
difficulty coming up with a compelling narrative, has her usual troubles 
in THE MAN WHO CRIED.  Although it never achieves lift-off, its clichéd 
story boldly comes out foursquare against anti-Semitism.  Among its 
musical treats are melodic opera arias, lip-synced by John Turturro in a 
silly beard, and a moody rendition of "Gloomy Sunday," lip-synced by 
Christina Ricci.  The superlative actors also include Cate Blanchett as 
a blonde bimbo, who worries that she hasn't used enough bleach on her 
hair, and Johnny Depp, who repeats his role from CHOCOLAT as a gypsy 
hunk living in France.
As the story begins in an unknown time and place, Yiddish-speaking 
characters are fleeing a village.  One young girl, played by Claudia 
Lander-Duke, is sent off to America but arrives instead in Britain, 
where the immigration officials randomly assign her the name of Susan.  
Susan, who takes the nickname of Suzie, is caned at school by her 
principal for speaking Yiddish.  The principal remarks that they didn't 
let him speak Welsh when he was young.
Jumping forward in time to pre-World War II Britain, a grown-up Suzie 
(played by a miscast Ricci) embarks on a new career as a member of a 
scantily-clad group of singers and dancers bound for Paris.  With a 
laughably overdrawn Russian accent, Cate Blanchett plays Lola, Suzie's 
roommate in her new troupe.  When they arrive in Paris, Lola takes up 
with Dante (Turturro), an Italian opera singer with a large ego.  After 
working hard, albeit with mixed success, on making the accents 
authentic, Potter gives up on only one nationality, the Germans.  The 
only characters with American accents are the Nazis.  Go figure.  
Since we've seen all of this before, the only things we're likely to 
remember are the visuals.  Two stand out.  Depp makes one heck of a 
handsome gypsy, and Turturro looks ridiculous as an opera singer.  
THE MAN WHO CRIED runs a long 1:37.  It is rated R for sexuality and 
would be acceptable for teenagers.
The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, May 25, 2001.  
In the United States it will be showing at one of the Camera Cinemas.

Sally Potter's (The Tango Lesson) films always seem to be about the visuals
more than any kind of structured story, and The Man Who Cried isn't one bit
different. It tells the story of a Jewish girl traversing the globe in
search of her beloved father and is set against the backdrop of World War II
and the Holocaust (can somebody please create and enforce an annual ceiling
on the production of WWII/Holocaust films?). The picture has a pretty decent
cast - it's kind of the indie version of America's Sweethearts' A-list
stars - but little annoyances like dialogue and chemistry bog down each of
the fine actors and actresses in a somewhat harebrained story.
Set in 1927, Cried opens in a Russian shtetl that is full of thin guys with
beards, thick-ankled women with babushkas, and kids who look normal but will
evolve into one of these two kinds of adults. One of these children is
Fegele (Claudia Lander-Duke), the daughter of the village cantor (Oleg
Yankovsky) and the apple of his eye. Fegele's papa heads for America with
the intention of bringing the rest of his family to the New World once he
saves enough money. But shortly after he leaves, the shtetl is burned to the
ground, and the wide-eyed Fegele is smuggled into England with only a
photograph of her dad and a couple of coins sewed into her dress.
Upon arriving in the UK, Fegele is renamed Suzie and handed off to a gentile
family who sends her to a Catholic school that literally beats the Yiddish
out of her. Cried flashes forward about 10 years, when an older Suzie (a
slimmed-down Christina Ricci, Sleepy Hollow) hightails it away from the
parents to whom she apparently never developed any kind of attachment and
heads for Paris, where she becomes a dancer in a theatre company owned by
Felix Perlman (Harry Dean Stanton, The Green Mile). But Suzie is able to
keep her Jewish past a secret, thanks to the English accent flogged into her
 by the Church and her adoptive parents.
Suzie also befriends fellow Russian dancer Lola (Cate Blanchett, The Gift),
who will do just about anything to land a man with money; and Cesar (Ricci's
Sleepy Hollow co-star Johnny Depp), a Gypsy horse-trainer for the theatre.
Johnny Depp as a gypsy living in France? That seems like such a stretch. As
in Chocolat, Depp doesn't show up for a while, and when he does, he barely
has any lines. And like Sleepy Hollow, there isn't much chemistry between he
and Ricci, but each offers more wordless glances at which to shake a stick.
Silent stares only get you so far, though.
I loved the beginning of the film, especially Lander-Duke's Ponette-esque
performance, and I admired the fact that, unlike Heartbreakers' Sigourney
Weaver, Blanchett's Russian accent didn't sound like Natasha from The Rocky
and Bullwinkle Show, even though, as Suzie's alter ego, her character is
grating (the film could have also been called Shut Up Lola Shut Up). Cried
looks fantastic (cinematographer Sacha Vierny has shot the last nine Peter
Greenaway films) and sounds great (Osvaldo Golijov's score includes a
terrific song from Requiem For a Dream's Kronos Quartet). But other than
that, there isn't too much happening, other than a lot of lip-synching.
Basically, Cried is about a girl in the throes of an identity crisis. Suzie
feels guilty about hiding her Jewish roots, and her heart breaks when she
sees the way the Gypsies are treated, but outing yourself as a Jew and
befriending the Gypsies as the Germans advance on Paris are a sure way to
get yourself tossed into the oven.
And just who is the titular crying man? Is it Suzie's father, weeping
because he was separated from his daughter? Is it Cesar, sobbing because he
knows his Gypsy family is likely to be wiped out? Or is it me, bawling
because I sat through the whole blasted thing?

   Mr. Abramowitz, (Oleg Yankovsky), the title character who
frames the picture, is an unimportant person from the point of
the view of the film's photographer and director but is the
most important person in the life of his daughter, Suzie,
known as Fegele in the birthplace which has been her home
for ten years.  Suzie's attachment to her dad is almost
Oedipal in intensity, but you can't blame her since the
unfortunate fellow, a cantor in the small Russian shtetl of
Borisov, was compelled to leave her behind when he
departed for America in 1927 in search of a better life--
intending to make enough money to send for Suzie later on.
   "The Man Who Cried" is yet another in the line of films
with motifs dealing in part with the domination of Europe
by the Nazis, which in the past year have included "Divided
We Fall," "Into the Arms of Strangers" and "Left Luggage." 
(Add "The Crimson Rivers" to that list if you include the
influence of Nazi thought on a modern-day French university.) 
While Sacha Vierny's photography is stunning, particularly
when contrasting the dirt-poor village that housed the Jews
with the opulence of an exquisite flat in Paris, and Osvaldo
Golijov's lovely music a welcome antidote to "Pearl Harbor"'s
deafening soundtrack, Herve's Schneid's editing gives the
entire movie the look of a series of trailers tacked on to one
another.  Sally Potter, who wrote the script to "The Man Who
Cried" as well, spends quite a long time in Europe slowly and
painfully developing the story for its ultimate payoff--which
proves to be almost anticlimactic in dramatic value.
   Christina Ricci inhabits the role of Suzie, seen first at about
the age of 10 (Claudia Lander-Duke) who, despite her
mellifluous singing voice stands out by adopting the silence of
the perpetual outsider.  When Cossacks invade the town and
burn the village, she escapes using the few gold coins that
her father had saved in the sugar jar and though clueless
about the destination of the ship, winds up not in America
where she expects to reunite with her dad but in England.
She is adopted by a Christian family with whom she remains
until she leaves ten years later for Paris to work in a chorus
line.  Taken under the wing by another Russian, the
gold-digging, Lola (Cate Blanchett), she acts like the
proverbial locked-out college roommate when Lola begins an
affair with an Italian opera singer, Dante Dominio (John
Turturro), who has a contract with producer Felix Perlman
(Harry Dean Stanton).  Luckily for Suzie, though, she loses
her virginity and gains a pair of starry eyes when she gains
the attention of a handsome but often sullen gypsy (Johnny
Depp).
   Sally Potter, whose "Orlando" is an engrossing, imaginative
tale of someone who lives for four hundred years--first as a
man and then as a woman--comes across this time with a
story as pedestrian as "Orlando" is innovative.  None of her
characters gets a three-dimensional treatment.  Cate
Blanchett's Lola is a caricature of the flirt and while John
Turturro benefits from the excellent dubbing of an operatic
voice,  Johnny Depp sleepwalks through his signature role as
a gypsy.   Christina Ricci's character is so repressed that we
are unconvinced of her ability as a singer.  Nor does she
inspire Johnny Depp, with whom she conducts a ho-hum little
love affair.  She's adept at learning Yiddish, though, and that's
a big plus for a nice, 20-year-old Santa Monica gal.
Rated R.  Running time: 100 minutes.  (C)2001,
