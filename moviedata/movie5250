     As is probably the case for many of my worldly generation, my
defining image of Tammy Faye Bakker isn't even really of Tammy Faye 
Bakker. It's the image of "Saturday Night Live's" Jan Hooks doing Tammy
Faye, all squeaky rebuking of demons and freely flowing mascara. Tammy
Faye herself was a caricature, easy to mock because of that
heart-on-the-sleeve demeanor and that garishly made-up face on that tiny
body. Who knew who she really was  and, frankly, who cared? She was part
of that whole PTL scandal with its juicy melange of God, sex and fraud. 
And she was so easy to laugh at.
     Randy Barbato and Fenton Bailey's documentary THE EYES OF TAMMY FAYE
is clearly an attempt to rehabilitate Tammy Faye now-Messner's image, made
with the full cooperation of the First Lady of Televangelism. And it's a
frequently fascinating character study that puts a truly human face on the
much-maligned woman. After an introduction to Tammy Faye's childhood, much
of the film is devoted to the peaks and valleys in Jim and Tammy Faye
Bakker's multiple attempts to create a Christian-themed satellite
television network. Naturally, there's also a heavy focus on the 1987
scandal that toppled the Bakkers' PTL empire, including Jim's confession
to a one-night stand with Jessica Hahn and a fraud trial related to
fund-raising for the Heritage U.S.A. vacation resort. Along the way there
are glimpses at the present-day Tammy, starting over once again with a
marriage to former Bakker associate Roe Messner and attempting to put her
troubled past behind her.
     THE EYES OF TAMMY FAYE is full of the sort of eye-opening tidbits
that make a documentary more than a parade of facts, places and dates. 
Barbato and Bailey give the Bakkers their due as pioneers who started The
700 Club, Trinity Broadcasting and PTL before being forced out of each and
every one by savvier folks. There are funny archival clips of the Bakkers'
mostly-improvised Christian children's show with Tammy Faye performing
hand puppets, and surprising glimpses of Tammy Faye reaching out to AIDS
patients at a time when many religious leaders were still referring to the
disease as punishment for homosexuals. There's humor in the clips of a
pre-Oscar Kevin Spacey playing Jim Bakker in a made-for-TV movie, and
drama in the machinations of Jerry Fallwell to force the Bakkers out of
PTL (Fallwell himself refused to be interviewed for the film). All
documentaries should be this entertaining.
     It's also not clear until the film is nearly over that it has spent
most of its running time avoiding its most intriguing subject: the
present-day Tammy Faye. Once the whole sordid PTL mess had been laid out,
Barbato and Bailey shift gears to show Tammy Faye trying to revive her
career as an entertainer. She appears on the now-defunct "Roseanne" talk
show; she meets with a photographer for new head shots (and throws the
makeup artist for a loop with her permanently lined lips, eyes and
eyebrows). She even pitches ideas for television projects -- including
"Tammy's Terrific Teens" and a show about medical advances -- to an
incredulous USA Networks executive. Tammy Faye emerges as a wonderful
contradiction: a born performer whose 30 years in the public eye have done
nothing to erase her essential naivete. The goofy genuineness that emerges
in scenes like her reaction to being in a grounded airplane during an
electrical storm make for a much more human story than the story of the
Bakkers' pre-scandal careers.
     None of that makes THE EYES OF TAMMY FAYE any less worth watching; in
fact, it's almost like two provocative short films effectively fused
together. It's also playful (the BABE-esque chorus of sock puppets reading
the chapter titles), informative and even a little bit inspirational. 
Comic Jim J. Bullock, Tammy Faye's former daytime chat-show co-host,
claims that after the world ends, all that will remain is "roaches, Tammy
Faye and Cher." It's a treat getting to know that plucky survivor, and
learning that there's something more than someone else's caricature behind
that trademark mascara.

Years from now, when the 1980's are reduced to a few meager paragraphs in
textbooks, only a few names will make the cut. Ronald Reagan and Oliver
North will probably be two of them for the infamous Iran-Contra scandal.
Ditto Mike Milken and Ivan Boesky for their notorious Wall Street
activities. And surely Jim Bakker will also find his way into the history
books as a founder of televangelism and a man who fell fast and hard. But
where is his partner? The other giants, Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson and Pat
Boone are all still standing - Bakker alone when to jail. Of course, there
was his loyal wife who seemed to vanish at the end of the turbulent decade
and never resurfaced. `The Eyes of Tammy Faye' asks the question: `Whatever
happened to Tammy Faye?'
Tammy Faye grew up in Small Town, USA as a Christian girl with such strong
faith that she claims a finger wart of hers was cured during communion one
Sunday. When in college, she met her religious equal and married him within
a year. Jim and Tammy Faye Baker would go on to make Pat Robertson who he
is, build three Christian television networks and practically create the
electronic pulpit.
The couple, who became the most popular Christian force in America,
redefined how it all worked. Tammy welcomed a homosexual suffering from AIDS
on air  something that had previously been taboo in the faith. Together,
they gave religious television a new look: no longer would it be super
serious and oftentimes boring, rather it would have a carnival like
atmosphere. Tammy insists `we believed Christianity should be fun' as she
recollects how she sung and used puppets, Jim introduced magicians and
clowns, and together they spread their religion over the Praise The Lord
Network (a. k. a. `PTL').
Of course, such an operation wasn't cheap. They were constantly asking for
donations and raising money. The bigger they got, the more expensive their
network became. When Jim decided to build a theme park  one that would be
the third largest in the world  the cost of operation per every two days
was $1 million. That's equivalent to 50,000 $10 pledges a day.
Then, in the 1980's, it all came crashing down. `The Eyes of Tammy Faye,'
with a clear pro-Tammy bias, pins most of the couple's problems on Jerry
Falwell. Rather than Jim Bakker being at fault for his infamous rendezvous
with Jessica Hahn, Jerry Falwell is the troublemaker. It is strongly implied
that Falwell leaked word of the affair to the news media and it is stated,
by many people, in very clear language, that Falwell maliciously conned the
couple out of PTL and then intentionally bankrupt the empire. It is even
alleged that he went a step further and insured that Jim and Tammy Faye
suffer public humiliation  possibly even framing Jim for the financial
irregularities that ultimately led to his being sentenced to 45 years in
prison. At one point, the film goes so far as to indirectly refer to Falwell
as `The Dragon.'
Of course, Jerry Falwell allegedly wasn't alone in sabotaging the couple.
The documentary assures us that the trial was biased from the beginning, the
press just as slanted and the American people all-too unforgiving.
Could it be? Is it just possible that America's largest religious scandal in
memory was actually a sham? Tammy Faye, between many tears and sobbing,
denies that either she or Jim ever misplaced a penny. Rather, it is
conveyed, that she merely suffers from bad luck and is continuously forced
to survive what no person should have to endure. As soon as we learn of her
phobia of flying, we see her in a plane that is grounded mid-route because
of weather problems. It all strikes a note that belongs in an Alanis
Morissette song. Yet, as frustrating as Morissette's `Ironic' may have been,
it was still a very entertaining piece. `The Eyes of Tammy Faye' is no
different.

Tammy Faye Bakker, "the First Lady of Christian broadcasting," was at
the center of the biggest real-life soap opera of the 1980s.  THE EYES
OF TAMMY FAYE, directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato and narrated
by none other than RuPaul Charles, is a mesmerizing and insightful look
into her life and the whole PTL (Praise The Lord) network scandal
involving her husband, Jim Bakker.
The documentary argues convincingly that the only sin of Tammy Faye, a
likeable little dynamo, is her unquestioning naiveté.  It suggests that
her husband's problems come down not to greed but to mismanagement and
that his infamous one-night stand with a playboy centerfold represents a
momentary lapse in judgment.  The villain of the piece turns out to be
Jerry Falwell.  Whether this represents the ultimate truth or not may
never be known, but the documentary offers compelling evidence to
support its case.
All of the above notwithstanding, the reason to see the movie is to meet
a fascinating and resourceful woman with a very interesting background.
Although the title refers to Tammy's signature heavy eye make-up, it
could be titled THE EYES OF THE VIEWERS since your eyes will be glued to
the screen in this intriguing tale.  In an age in which reality
programming is popular, this movie would seem to have arrived at just
the right moment in time.  Forget daytime soaps, none could be better
than this movie.
Each of the story's chapters is introduced by puppets who like to giggle
as they read titles like "Things Can Only Get Worse."  These humorous
puppets are appropriate since Jim and Tammy's first television show was
a Christian broadcast done Howdy Doody style.  Tammy Faye, like a little
girl who never grew up, loves her dolls and puppets even today.  The
remarkably good-spirited documentary offers up lots of opportunities to
laugh but none are at Tammy Faye's expense.
After the Christian kids' show, Jim and Tammy went on to form the famous
700 Club and their own network.  Intrigue followed them wherever they
went, and, like all of the major televangelists, they lived a lavish
lifestyle.  The internecine warfare among the leaders of the Christian
broadcasting community is shown to be much more vicious than outsiders
would ever imagine.
An unabashed believer in the importance of happiness in worship ("We
believe that we were one of the first people to put fun and joy in
religion."), she works so hard that she appears in constant danger of a
complete meltdown.  Overuse of prescription drugs proves to be her
undoing.
Meanwhile her husband, Jim, is busy launching a satellite and building
the third biggest recreational attraction in America, the Heritage USA
theme park.  All along, he is blasting across the airways trying to
raise money while harping on his theme of "God loves you, he really
does."  If he isn't shown to be quite as likeable as Tammy Faye, Jim
still comes across as an ambitious man with a good heart who made some
mistakes.  In short, he just appears human, and high profile political
figures guilty of much more than he have thrived.
Most of all, Tammy Faye is a survivor.  Jim J. Bullock, a gay comedian
and, at one time, Tammy's television talk-show host, says it best about
Tammy Faye's skills.  "After the Holocaust, there will be roaches, Tammy
Faye and Cher," he gives as his list of the top survivors of the
twentieth century.
THE EYES OF TAMMY FAYE runs a fast 1:19.  It is rated PG-13 for some
sexual content and would be acceptable for any kids old enough to be
interested in the material.

EYES OF TAMMY FAYE, THE (director: Fenton Bailey/Randy Barbato;
cinematographer: Sandra Chandler; editor: Paul Wiesepape; cast: Tammy
Faye Messner, Roe Messner, Jim Bakker, RuPaul Charles (narrator),  the
Rev. Mel White, Pat Boone, Steven Chao, Jim J. Bullock, Charles Sheperd
(reporter for the Charlotte Observer); Runtime: 79; Lions Gate; 2000)
A poorly done documentary that is superficially entertaining, whose
blurred camerawork, its failure to get hold of its subject in anything
but a self-promoting manner, and its campy playing with the criminal
scandals and lawsuits that became front-page news fraught with sex
charges and fraud in fund-raising is done in a witless manner, which
leaves me scratching my worldly head about why this farcical film was
made or why it thinks this would make Tammy Faye, the subject of the
film, look better than the national joke she is. The only thing this
film clearly revealed about Tammy Faye, is that she loves to be in front
of the camera, is terribly vain, is addicted to Diet-Coke, wears tons of
makeup and wears her emotions on her sleeve, mistakeningly thinking
she's an old-fashioned girl who likes real things when we clearly see
otherwise; and most importantly, she wears Loreal mascara and has
permanently false eyebrows (which is her trademark), and that her lips
are permanently lined.
This upbeat religious parasite, was born in humble circumstances in
International Falls, Minnesota. She went on from there to make a lot of
money by exploiting the Christian thing, evoking Jesus' name at the drop
of a hat, preaching that God is on her side, while she clawed her way to
the top of the heap as a televangelist, greedily scheming and
manipulating to make a fortune and living a very luxurious life-style.
Since I didn't care about her when she was riding high in the 1960s and
1970s and early 1980s, and I didn't care about her when she was banished
from Christian TV because of her disgrace, I wondered what this
documentary would present that would change my mind about her, so I at
least could care somewhat about her. But it failed to get me to see her
in any other light than that of a self-absorbed publicity hound and
someone who is superficial to the point of being a caricature of someone
who is superficial, though if she is compared to those other Christian
hypocrites --  like her ex-husband Jim Bakker, Jerry Falwell, and Pat
Robinson, she passes the likability test with flying colors. She might
be in the same league with them, but she's not cut from the same kind of
dirty player cloth they are, more of a goof than the hateful persons
conveyed by Falwell and Robinson, whose biases are couched in their
belief it is God who tells them what is right and anyone else's
interpretation is the work of the Devil. Tammy spent a longtime in the
company of such men and her sudden realization of how cruel they can be,
seems to be only because they did her dirty in business. She certainly
knew what her husband was doing, even if it wasn't her scheme, yet she
did nothing about it, never preventing innocent people from being
ripped-off.
The film's aim seems to be nothing less than a rehabilitation project in
the public image on Tammy Faye Messner, the once queen of televangelism
but the now exile in the world of Christian televangelism. But since
there was not one moment in this documentary that I cared what happened
to this grasping, charlatan, and greedy performer, who helped swindle
those who were believers with her self-righteous Christian beliefs and
is now trying to go secular to get back into showbiz by using her
calling card, that she was the only televangelist to be nice to an AIDS
victim on the air and has always struck a friendly chord with gays,
therefore she's such a wonderful person, merely a victim of the media
who were out to get her, and that the real culprit in televangelism is
the Judas, Jerry Falwell, who stole her television station, just like
the shadowy Pat Robinson, who stole her 700 Club. This reasoning on her
part does not wash with me.
But at least, she deserves credit with her slimy husband, Jim Bakker,
for being business pioneers in Christian broadcasting, making use of the
Oral Roberts brand of evangelism to reach a broader audience by making
Christianity into a lighthearted show, where she sang and performed with
hand puppets, while he raised tons of money from his TV audience. They
started The 700 Club, Trinity Broadcasting, Heritage Park USA and PTL
before being forced out of each of these very financially lucrative
ventures by those who were more cunning.
Their downfall came on two fronts, one was a moment of indiscretion on
the part of Bakker, where he had a one-night stand with future Playboy
centerfold Jessica Hahn and when she tried to bribe him, he tried to get
his friend who oversaw construction on Heritage USA, Roe Messner, to pay
her off to hush things up. Falwell used this nine years later to get
Bakker to turn the PTL over to him. Bakker's long prison sentence came,
after the reporter from the Charlotte Observer ran a series of stories
of how the money raised for Heritage Park was going into Bakker's
pockets instead of it all going into the project as advertised. In
court, the prosecutors showed that he kept at least $3 million and the
jurors convicted him.
RuPaul Charles does the narration, honing in solely on Tammy's point of
view. Tammy's main events in her life are introduced by hand puppets
singing out chapter titles in a most facile manner, copying the way the
children's movie "Babe" was presented.
We don't know much more about Jim Bakker from this work, other than a
few trivial crumbs of polished gloss Tammy throws our way.
The film shows Tammy as a survivor, divorcing Jim, marrying his friend
Roe, going on Roseanne's talk-show, trying to freshen her image for
secular TV by going to a Hollywood photographer, getting her own talk
show with a gay co-host Jim J. Bullock, unsuccessfully pitching a
ridiculous TV series she wants to call "Terrific Teens" to USA network
producer Steven Chao, and trying to get us to believe she is suffering
so much because of the injustice done to her, as she is leading a lonely
life in her mansion in Palm Springs, California. The house she got from
Jim in her divorce settlement.
I didn't buy into her act and I didn't find the film funny, when it
should have been both a scream and a much more informative piece than
what was presented. But if one has such low expections of Tammy, as I
surmise most do who are out of range of her choir, then some of those
might find that she is more likable than they first thought. But don't
include me as one her converts. I came away with the same trashy opinion
of her I had before I saw this "mock" documentary.
The best line in the film came from Bullock, the co-host from that now
defunct show, who states, "She is a survivor. After the Holocaust, all
that will remain will be "roaches, Tammy Faye and Cher." He might be
right, I'm sure she'll even survive this movie about her.

Many media observers have stated that modern American news coverage by
the mass media has shifted from substantive issue exploration to
tabloid journalism. In an intense competition to garner the most
viewers, issues are presented in a summary manner with only the
salacious details covered. This film is a documentary exploration of a
real individual, Tammy Faye Bakker, at the heart of one particular
scandal. It attempts to portray a broader picture than what could be
understood from news headlines.
In the late 1980's the television empire of Christian evangelists Jim
and Tammy Faye Bakker crumbled beneath allegations of adultery and
corruption. The pair had launched and run the successful PTL (Praise
The Lord) television ministry, which included a broadcast network and
sprawling theme park. Investigative reporting eventually uncovered an
affair between Jim Bakker and a ministry staffer which brought scandal
to the ministry, but it was the eventual revelation of embezzlement
that undid the Bakkers' empire. The public humiliation of the couple
was eagerly covered by the mass media.
The film gives a chronological recounting of Tammy Faye's biography,
concentrating on the details of the collapse of the PTL network. It
divides the events into several chapters which chronicle specific
upturns and downturns in Tammy Faye's fate.
Many viewers will remember Tammy Faye from the original press coverage
as a freakish, maudlin character sporting heavy layers of clownish
make up. The coverage portrayed her as a weepy, cloying whiner and as
a result outsiders may not have had a sympathetic opinion of her. Many
view television evangelists as inherently corrupt, and some were happy
to see the Bakkers punished for living a lavish lifestyle on viewer
donations. Some may have been happy to see the ministers publicly
humiliated for not living up to the principles they preached. The act
of preaching is intrinsically a patronizing relationship between the
preacher and congregation. When a broadcast medium is used for the
communication, some viewers will be offended by the assumption that
the they need to be preached to.
The reality presented by the film shows a less exaggerated, although
still odd, portrait. Tammy Faye lacked the judgmental vitriol of other
evangelists, as demonstrated by her unconditional acceptance
homosexuals and HIV infected patients from the moment the issue came
to public awareness. Although the Bakkers did live well, off the
contributions of others, they do appear to be less corrupt than many
of their contemporaries.
The basic purpose of a documentary is to frame a factual topic and
present the events in a manner that is enlightening and entertaining,
and this film succeeds at this level. For a documentary to excel, it
must raise a larger question and relate the story to a more esoteric
exploration, which this film falls short of. Although it is hampered
by the unwillingness of some of the key participants in the events to
be interviewed, the film is successful in constructing a coherent
narrative. The tone of the story is intentionally kept light in order
to present the quirkiness of the individuals to be entertaining. The
presentation is certainly sympathetic to Tammy Faye, but it does not
shy away from displaying her oddness.
Recommended. The film presents a detailed perspective on events that
were covered by the mass media, and shows that there is a story more
substantive and interesting than the sensational coverage may have
indicated. It falls short of exploring any serious philosophical
issues that a viewer might expect of a documentary, but it is an
entertaining insight into the world of television evangelism, and of
one particularly intriguing individual.

Susan Granger's review of "THE EYES OF TAMMY FAYE" (Lions Gate Films)
A hit at the Sundance Film Festival, this kitschy and
affectionate documentary by Randy Barbato and Fenton Bailey chronicles
the life and times of Tammy Faye Bakker, ex-wife of evangelist Jim
Bakker who - in a spectacular and highly publicized free-fall from
grace - lost control of the PTL (Praise the Lord) Ministries to
manipulative minister Jerry Falwell and wound up in jail. Narrated by
"RuPaul" Charles, it delves beneath the public persona of the teary
Tammy Faye and into the storybook life of the couple who had the
audacity to make Christian fellowship fun, creating a Heritage USA
water park that was the ultimate baptismal font and openly welcoming
homosexuals into their PTL Club.  Tammy Faye grew up as a humble
Christian girl who loved puppets and had such strong faith that she
claims a wart on her finger was cured during a Sunday communion. When
she was in college, she met and married Jim Bakker, whose faith
matched hers. Together, they cultivated the electronic pulpit,
building three Christian television networks and becoming arguably the
most popular Christian force in the United States. Their dreams were
expensive and their money-raising schemes extensive. Then, in the
1980s, scandal rocked Tammy Faye's life, destroying her reputation and
her marriage. Nevertheless, Tammy Faye is once again on her feet, the
indomitable survivor, back in the limelight where she feels she
belongs. Obviously, the filmmakers are sympathetic and their bias
propels the narrative. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The
Eyes of Tammy Faye" is an ironic, irreverent, comic 7.  I suspect that
one of the reasons this film resonates so strongly with audiences is
that we live in a very judgmental society and, just perhaps, we were
wrong about Tammy Faye.

THE EYES OF TAMMY FAYE  (2000) **1/2 . Produced and directed by 
Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato. Photography, Sandra Chandler. 
Editing, Paul Wiesepape. Music, Jim Harry. With: Tammy Faye Bakker 
Messner, Roe Messner, Jim Bakker, the Rev. Mel White, Pat Boone, 
Tammy Sue Bakker Chapman, Steven Chao, Jim J. Bullock, Roseanne, Greg 
Gorman, Charles Sheperd, James Albert.  RuPaul Charles narrates. A 
Lions Gate Film. 79 minutes.  PG-13
One of the major banes produced by the media revolution is so-called 
celebrities of all kinds. They are the good, the bad and the ugly; 
the objects of cult, of paparazzi and groceries' check-out counter 
tabloids, of most glossy magazines; they fill the airwaves; they 
regularly elbow out substantial news items; etc.
Per se, the "celebrity"-mania may not cause any major harm. But since 
human life and time are finite, the frills of  the excessive 
documenting of mostly entertainment figures has to be at the expense 
of more important knowledge and information. A vivid example of this 
is the Jay Leno show's sadly funny "Jaywalking" segments. (They are 
edited interviews, of course, and require that the people in them 
give permission --sign releases -- but is it not horrible that they 
accept to be idiots in public for the sake of being on TV?
On a more elevated level, too many college students who might be 
smart, and who almost all know by heart the names, performances and 
trivia of "celebrities," have lacked the time to learn (even 
slightly) general culture: history, geography, current events, 
literature, the arts and so on.
In fairness I must add that it was ever thus. College education is 
time-consuming; it offers limited opportunities for students to go 
beyond certain specialties. But then,  this state of things has 
reached exponentially abysmal proportions with the exponential rise 
of the media. Sadly too, while TV, the most influential of all, can 
also be also a major boon, an amazing and vivid source of learning, 
this very positive aspect of the media is far too little exploited. 
In fact, any polling of persons "being educated" reveals that
the small percentage of those who profit from 
educational/informational television consists overwhelmingly of older 
persons.
The same tragic situation applies to books, magazines, etc. You name 
it. And, alas, not only to the United States but to most, if not all, 
other countries.
Having gotten this off my chest I'll turn to "The Eyes of Tammy 
Faye." It is a documentary about "celebrity"  Tammy Faye Bakker, now 
Tammy Faye Bakker Messner. Its two directors (who seem to be Brits) 
are experienced in the genre. They are not impartial. They set out 
to redeem Tammy--or at the very least to induce in their public 
second thoughts about Tammy. The film goes overboard. The information 
that comes with it shows this clearly.
Examples: "Tammy is one of the most adored and reviled women of her 
time." Do the makers really believe that she was/is  a concern of 
most Americans, not to mention the rest of the planet?  They admit to 
having drawn an "  affectionate portrait."  But documentaries of this 
sort should not be partisan and take no sides openly, even though 
subliminally or indirectly documentaries always have a point of view 
(That's the old argument about "cinema verite")  Tammy is "both 
surprising and endearing." Says who? "The Bakkers were crucified in 
the court of public opinion for their supposed greed and corruption." 
If this is not a partisan opinion, what is? And so on.
Entertaining the film certainly is --and this is what makes me give 
it 2 1/2 stars. But it also falls between two stools. At first it 
seems to be akin to the satirical exposes by film-makers such as 
Michael Moore ("Roger and Me," " The Big One," et al.) But it rapidly 
evolves into a gentler, kinder portrait of Tammy and her adventures.
"Celebrities" can be, and often are, ridiculous figures. Make your 
own list. Tammy was and remains a Class A oddity who cannot be taken 
seriously as she recounts her life from its beginnings to the Odyssey 
of the Tammy-Jim Bakker duo, its rise and fall, to developments and 
updates through recent times.
The movie follows her mostly through interviews in which Tammy 
speaks to the camera.  Her interviewers are mostly unseen and unheard 
but many other "names" do appear and add their favorable, pro-Tammy 
opinions.
For many members of the movie's audience the main interest will be 
the light shed on the aspect of Americana known as televangelism. The 
couple's debut, in the 1960s, was when almost unknown Pat Robertson 
had them create for his own TV program in his one-station "network" a 
Jesus-based puppet show. (The puppets are in the film as 
chapter-announcers). Then the Bakkers invented  "The 700 Club,"  the 
first Christian talk-show.  Jealous of their success Robertson dumped 
the couple.
Moving to California the couple co-founded TBN, and were betrayed 
again. Moving on to North Carolina, they founded PTL (Praise the 
Lord), which became the jewel in their crown and was one of the very 
first 24-hour satellite networks.  Its thriving televangelism 
business culminated with the creation of the first Christian theme 
park, the mammoth Heritage USA.
Eventually came financial troubles, irregularities, deficits, money 
problems. Added to them was Jim Bakker's one-night stand with his 
employee Jessica Hahn (who later told her side of the story in 
Playboy). There also came research and exposes by the Charlotte 
Observer's reporter Charles F. Sheperd. All that spells scandal.
Hard-right televangelist Jerry Falwell now enters the picture. He had 
his own empire. Apparently he hated PTL because (among the reasons 
given by Tammy) he was against its all-embracing nature, its 
acceptance of  all denominations, of gays, addicts, and so on. And he 
had no satellite.
Oddly  (on the surface only) when PTL became a sinking Titanic, 
Falwell offered help, flew in to the rescue (in his private jet), 
made an offer that the Bakkers could not refuse: he promised money 
--and to get more funds, he said he would take over PTL for a short 
time only, to fix things, and so on.
As per Tammy, he cheated. Within a month he declared  PTL's 
bankruptcy, exposed the Bakkers' financial tangles, attacked Jim for 
his "homosexual audiences" and dishonesty ---and added one more 
betrayal to the J & T saga.  Falwell is the arch-villain of this 
story. There's no honor among thieves.
Soon after Jim was sentenced to 45 years in prison. The marriage 
dissolved. Tammy married their friend Roe Messner, the contractor of 
Heritage USA. Messner was also tried and sentenced to a sojourn in 
jail.
A tawdry tale, it keeps its steady focus on Tammy, a monument to bad 
taste in  makeup and vestimentary horrors. (At one point, her huge 
rings reminded me of gladiators' shields.) The camera and microphone 
show her as freaky but gutsy, pathetic (in both senses), with a 
meowing baby voice that matches her celebrated (in effect a huge joke 
to all but Tammy) treatment of her eyes. She speaks of her private 
troubles in an endless, often lachrymose litany :her betrayal by Jim, 
her drug addiction, her fight with colon cancer, her formerly 
alienated children, and much else. We follow her undaunted search for 
(un-realized or failed) Tammy-starring, outlandish TV shows (such as 
"Medicine Today with Tammy Faye") ,her singing, her recitations of 
her doggerel-plus poetry, her "beautification" for cameras, her 
visits to Oral Roberts University where she warbles ( the radio guy 
calls her "a fabulous singer" --sic) her determination to pull on 
heartstrings.
If this movie plays in Europe, where televangelism is still a rarity 
and a novelty, whether or not understood by non-Americans it is bound 
to become a mega-curiosity. That's another reason I rated it  **1/2 .
Tammy takes herself so very seriously that one might (or not) doubt 
her faith. There is a notable, disturbing passage when job-seeking 
Tammy talks about switching to "secular TV." Quote: " I am a very 
secular person. Christ is only part of me." And from start to finish, 
with the word "God"  kicked around as incessantly as a ball in a 
soccer game, one can't help thinking of the Commandment:
"You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain; for the 
Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain. "
