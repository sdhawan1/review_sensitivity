"Amazing Caves" is not an exciting enough title for a sometimes 
breathtaking, sometimes wondrous audiovisual experience. 
The filmmakers take full advantage of this sensational medium to carry 
us with them to places God knows we'd never go ourselves: winding 
through the canyons in the Arizona desert, submerged underground, 
underwater, or dropping through huge ice crevices - climbing, paddling 
and swimming into mysterious, elusive holes in the Earth. 
Though the production pays due attention to education, the beauty and 
adventure of these journeys are gladly the main focus. Splendid visuals 
are backed up with warm fertile moody tunes from 60's rock band the 
Moody Blues. The band reworks (and improves) old favorites for the 
score, enjoying the grand performance of Large Format audio. 
Like exploring a hole itself, the film takes an excursion from the 
familiar beaten path of documentary format in favor of finding something 
spiritual to bring home in the specimen jar. Sweetly done. 
"The most dangerous part of caving ... is just getting to them." 
Cavers take to kayaks and drop down a 12-foot waterfall - your heart and 
jaw will drop with them. A copter'd cam scraps the pastel canyon walls 
over a limestone turquoise blue river - gorgeous (no pun intended). 
Later in an underwater cave, divers squirm through holes no larger than 
a pizza. The screen is huge, but a fantastic feeling of claustrophobia 
squeezes it to within an inch of a gasp. How did they get that huge 
camera through? 
My only suggestions lie within the realm of education. I wouldn't change 
a single edit on the current production, but might have added graphic 
overlays to back up some of the narrative. Liam Neeson's tongue gives 
appropriate potency to the voice-over; but several times technical 
phrases could have been illustrated in one corner of that huge screen by 
a chart, diagram or animation, while the big adventure continued. Such 
overlays would serve to make the production so rich with information 
viewers will want to see it twice or three times. 
Nine years in the making, "Amazing Caves" was well worth the effort. I'd 
have chosen a better title though ... perhaps: "Caving in", "Climbing 
into the Earth", "Climbing into Ice, Rock and Water", or my personal 
favorite: "Spelunk!"
