THE CURSE OF THE JADE SCORPION, written and directed by Woody Allen, suffers
from the Woody Allen curse.  It's a malaise of mediocrity that has struck almost
all of his recent films.  They're all merely okay -- cute at times with some
nice laughs but as forgettable as sitcom reruns.
The setup this time features Woody as crackerjack detective CW Briggs during
Woody's favorite period, the 1940s.  This allows him to get a lot of his
favorite music, jazz, into the score.  The weird and wacky theme music for the
film manages to be the movie's most endearing and original accomplishment.
Briggs has running verbal battles with the office's new efficiency expert, Betty
Ann "Fitz" Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt).  Although they appear to despise each other,
they subconsciously are head-over-heels in love.  Their stream of insults and
CW's sexual innuendos form the best part of the dialog.  When she finds a deck
of playing cards decorated with naked women in his apartment, it confirms her
assessment of him as a slimeball.  As an explanation, he tells her, "I used to
date the six of spades."  Many of the jokes, however, are retreads such as the
one about the blind beggar.  Guess what?  He can see.
The plot concerns a hypnotist, Voltan (David Ogden Stiers), who puts both CW and
Fitz under a spell.  This allows Voltan later to turn them into zombies.  With a
glaze over their eyes and minds, they become Voltan's remote-controlled jewel
thieves.  
A subtheme concerns the affair that Fitz is having with their boss, Chris
Magruder (Dan Aykroyd).  This dissolves into the old routine of whether the
married man will leave his wife or not.  Elizabeth Berkley (SHOWGIRLS) and
Charlize Theron are given a couple of throwaway parts -- Berkley as a woman who
looks easy, but isn't, and Theron as a blonde bombshell, who is happiest in bed.
As the story evolves, it turns more and more into a love story.  If you like to
see old, frail, balding guys taking home the smart, good-looking women, you'll
like where the story goes.  I must admit that I still find Woody charming, but I
suspect it is more in reverence for his great films like ANNIE HALL and HANNAH
AND HER SISTERS than for his current pictures.  The best that can be said of his
latest film is that it's kind of entertaining.
THE CURSE OF THE JADE SCORPION runs too long at 1:44.  It is rated PG-13 for
some sexual content and would be acceptable for kids around 9 and up.
My son Jeffrey, age 12, gave it ** 1/2.  He said that it was funny, but that the
film "wasn't the greatest and wasn't the worst."  It was okay.
The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, August 24, 2001.  In
the Silicon Valley, it will be showing at the Camera Cinemas.

    CAPSULE: This film is more interesting for its nostalgia value
    than for actual story values.  That value is certainly better
    than any comic value it might have.  Woody Allen writes,
    directs, and stars in a whimsical B film of a style that was
    popular in the year it is set, 1940.  Allen's humor just is not
    as funny as it used to be.  This is better than some of his
    recent efforts, but that is not saying much.  Rating:
    4 (0 to 10), 0 (-4 to +4).
As far as I am concerned Woody Allen, once one of our finest
filmmakers, has not made a really satisfying film since his
excellent CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS.  CURSE OF THE JADE SCORPION is
his best effort in recent times.  At least he is not obviously
trying to write about his life, as he was in DECONSTRUCTING HARRY.
There are not missing scenes, as there were in SWEET AND LOWDOWN.
He does get the feel of the genre of film he is resurrecting,
unlike EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU.  Here he tells a whole story and
it feels right (mostly).  The one problem is that it is not a
really good story.  It has plot holes and the plot might very well
have been used for a 1930s or 1940s B picture.  It probably would
not have had a lurid, pulpish title like CURSE OF THE JADE
SCORPION.  In filmdom those titles were pretty much confined to
the serials at that time.  And this film is in color, albeit
sepia-tinged, and is a little more explicit about sex than one of
those films would have been.  But those exceptions aside this
might well have been a film that might have starred Lee Tracy and
nestled at the bottom of a double bill right under a big Warner
Brothers studio film.  If that was what Allen was trying to
recreate, that does not make this a particularly ambitious film,
but it probably achieves those ambitions.  Even the comedy is up
to the standards of that sort of film.
C.W. Briggs (Woody Allen) is a super-hot-shot investigator for the
North Coast Insurance Company.  (Does the U.S. have a north
coast?)  He gets all the big cases and breaks them with lightning
speed with the aid of his network of skid row informants.  He has
just broken a tough case of a stolen Picasso.  Everybody in the
office is agog but for the insurance company's executive
efficiency expert Betty Ann Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt).  Fitz, as she
is called, has absolutely no use for smug, self-obsessed,
egotistical Briggs, and Briggs has no use for the officious Fitz
who can match him insult for insult in battles of double
entendres.  One night the two go with a group to see a nightclub
hypnotist, Voltan (David Ogden Stiers).  When called up to the
stage neither thinks that Voltan can put them under.  He does and
temporarily makes them love each other.  He also leaves them with
post-hypnotic suggestion that makes them his slave when he uses
the right code word (a la THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE).  He has plans
of his own for them.
This is, of course, not Allen's first outing into nostalgia for
the world of the popular culture of his youth.  His most
successful film along these lines would probably be RADIO DAYS.
There he showed how the entertainment world and his own real world
interacted and fed each other.  There is no such attempt here.
His script is pure pastiche.  His humor is more than a little
strained and for me at least was just not funny.  At one point he
tells police that he cannot talk to them because he has a chorus
girl in his bedroom.  An instant later he tells them he has to get
back to his nurse.  When they remind him that he just said she was
a chorus girl, flustered he says it is a chorus girl who does a
little nursing.  The line is very Woody Allen, but it is not at
all clever or funny.  The film is just full of predictable twists
and gags that do not quite amuse.
In this film Allen is looking a little tired and bedraggled.  He
continues to cast himself as the romantic lead in his films.  The
heart wants what the heart wants, and the heart no longer yearns
to see him get a woman twenty-eight years his junior.  It seemed
only recently that Helen Hunt was in several films released at the
same time.  Now she is content to be in just Allen's film. Allen,
like Robert Altman, is in the enviable position that he can put a
familiar face in just about every major role.  This film has Dan
Aykroyd, Wallace Shawn, David Ogden Stiers and Charlize Theron.
One can tell from the beginning that this is a Woody Allen film.
Every Allen film these days starts with a jazz score and white on
black credits.
CURSE OF THE JADE SCORPION is whimsical, but it is empty and
rarely elicits a laugh.  I give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a
0 on the -4 to +4 scale.

There is no way to explain my constant fascination with Woody Allen. He is one
of the few comedy geniuses of the 20th century. From masterful comedy-dramas
like "Annie Hall" and "Manhattan" to somber, Bergmanesque dramas like
"Interiors" and "Crimes and Misdemeanors" to self-portraits that are as acrid
and alive as any of his early works like "Husbands and Wives" and
"Deconstructing Harry," Woody has maintained a body of work that reflects his
philosophy and psychology of general relationships on Manhattan's Lower East
Side. And he can be hard on himself when he deconstructs his own life, but
always with an edge and a distance that may not always appeal to everyone who is
not from New York. I would never confuse Woody for a mainstream comedy director
in this jaded day and age. That is why it is a pleasure to report that "The
Curse of the Jade Scorpion" is a delightful souffle, spiked and stinging with
wit from all corners of the screen. It is as smarmily funny as "Small Time
Crooks" and "Manhattan Murder Mys
tery" and as affectionate and buyoant as "Bullets Over Broadway" and "Zelig."
"Curse of the Jade Scorpion" is set in Manhattan in 1940 where C.W. Briggs
(Woody Allen) is a fraud insurance detective who cracks nearly every case with
sheer luck and ingenious instinct. He is admired by his co-workers, which
includes Dan Aykroyd as his professional boss Magruder and Jill (Elizabeth
Berkley), a secretary who will let someone rub her chest as long as they bring a
ring. The one exception to this staff is Betty Ann Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt) who
is hired by the company to make it more efficient and workmanlike (she also
considers condensing the private detective agency). She hates C.W. and sees him
as vermin and as a dinosaur (there are probably as many synonyms used to
describe Woody negatively in this film than in any other). C.W. hates her too
and you can see it will probably lead to a romance at some point. One night at a
birthday party, C.W. and Betty Ann are asked to participate in a magic act by
the great Voltan (David Ogden Stiers). They are put in a trance where the names
like "Madagasc
ar" and "Constantinople" are uttered and where they are apparently lovers. Once
snapped out of the trance, C.W. continues to hate Betty Ann. However, precious
jewels begin to disappear from wealthy estates and C.W. might be a prime suspect
thanks to the trance-like powers of the great Voltan. 
"The Curse of the Jade Scorpion" reminds me of the great 40's romantic comedies
where a bickering couple would trade insults and engaging repartee with ease
("His Girl Friday" is my favorite of that period). Woody Allen and Helen Hunt
are a match made in heaven and show love and hate for each other with aplomb.
Their chemistry works well - Hunt is all professionalism and Allen simply cracks
wise. What is ultimately satisfying and unusual is to see Allen in a role that
would have been suited for someone like Cary Grant or James Stewart. Seeing
Allen as a short man with a milder neurosis than usual  is simply startling and
hilarious - consider the opening sequence where he arrives at his office in a
trenchcoat and felt hat as if he were Humphrey Bogart. Similarly, Hunt cleverly
assumes the role of a 40's working woman with authority and great energy - I am
not crazy about Hunt overall but in the right role, this actress sizzles and
holds her own with Allen. 
"Jade Scorpion" has the customary Allen quips but it also has an informal,
chaste, elegant atmosphere. A romantic comedy like this in the 1940's would have
been rapid fire in pace and language. Here, Allen chooses to slow it down
somewhat, as if inviting us for a cup of tea rather than coffee. To some, this
may be offputting but I was positively entranced. The irradiating glow from the
cinematography by Zhao Fei enhances the elegance and brings a nostalgic tone to
the proceedings. 
As always, Allen knows how to choose the right actors. Can you recall Sean Penn
being as faultless and knowing as in "Sweet and Lowdown"? Can you recall Winona
Ryder ever being as bewitching as in "Celebrity"? Well, "Jade Scorpion" has
Helen Hunt at her best as aforementioned. There is also Dan Aykroyd as a
businesslike romantic interest (I never thought Aykroyd would share a kissing
scene with Helen Hunt) with choice lines - he delivers a performance every bit
as nuanced as anything he has ever done. Elizabeth Berkley is actually tolerable
on screen, shedding any leftover negative vibes from "Showgirls." David Ogden
Stiers, an Allen regular, vibrates with stinging ardor. Everyone is perfectly
cast and seems to occupy a time in history credibly, unlike say "Pearl Harbor."
"Curse of the Jade Scorpion" is a hoot and a half and tightly written and
directed. They say Woody Allen is not worth caring about anymore, and that he is
way past the comic highlights of his career. Some may say he is simply marking
time, making one film a year to keep himself busy. He may not create a
masterpiece like "Crimes and Misdemeanors" or "Annie Hall" but who cares. He
still makes films and let us be glad his wit lives on. The real curse would be
to avoid him.

Before you read my review, you gotta know that I love Woody Allen. This is a
very important note because Allen's films are generally an acquired taste and
definitely not for everyone. I know folks who believe him to be a complete
genius, while others see him as a dirty ol' schnook who keeps making the same
movie over and over again. I love most of his films, but will admit to having
been quite disappointed by his recent crop during the 90s. In fact, why he felt
the need to make 10 movies in those 10 years is beyond me! If you look at the
quality of those films, you'll hear what I'm saying. The only two films of his
that I really liked during that time were BULLETS OVER BROADWAY and HUSBANDS AND
WIVES. In fact, I secretly hoped that he would take some "time off" at the turn
of the millennium, just to re-energize or something, but it doesn't appear as
though he has any intention of doing that. So here I am again, reviewing yet
another Woody Allen movie and hoping that it brings back the Woody from the days
of old.
PLOT:
The year is 1940 and Woody Allen is a top-notch insurance investigator. His
methods are very old-fashioned and apparently out of date. A new employee (Hunt)
has just been hired to streamline the operations for greater efficiency. The two
do not like each other. One night, they are both put under a hypnotic trance by
a magician, and unbeknownst to them, placed under his control. Soon thereafter,
jewels are stolen, words of love are exchanged and everyone is looking for an
answer. 
CRITIQUE:
A wonderful recreation of the 1940s style movies, with the fast-talking witty
banter between co-workers, a catchy jazz score moving things along, film noirish
elements such as the Veronica Lake-type sexpot, one-liners galore and a fluffy,
if inconsequential plotline. On the downside, the film actually starts off
pretty slowly, with the first hour tossing only a few guffaws out there, but
never really generating any kind of steady flow or energy. The sets, on the
other hand, were amazing, the production design and costumes were perfect, and
the casting ideal, so I kept hoping that the film would pick up and not turn
into yet another mediocre outing for the man. But it wasn't not long before I
was fully engaged by the characters, entertained by the many zingers delivered
back-and-forth between Allen and Hunt, and actually interested in the resolution
of the flick. I also appreciated how Allen played the fine line between homage
to the films of old, parody and actual reinvention (note Theron's entire female
persona that is drenched in film noir- very cool).
Of course, films like this (with little or no real tension in the plot) need
solid actors to keep you interested in the quick-fire dialogue, and once again,
Allen does a great job in playing his character, who for once, isn't his typical
New York Jewish neurotic cheating insecure husband dude. He actually plays a
"macho" guy here and handles it pretty well, especially the scenes in which he's
hypnotized. But the bigger surprise for me in this film was Helen Hunt, an
actress who I was openly "sick of seeing" in movies late last year (sorry babe,
you were just in too many at the same time!). Anyway, she's really great in this
film as the headstrong woman looking to a new era of equality amongst men, and
doesn't miss a beat of Allen's fast-paced dialogue. I didn't care much for her
running joke about him "dying" whenever he left a room, but overall she was
really good and I especially liked the way that her sweaters clung to her
breasts as they did...yum, yum! Harumph, but I digress. So let's recap. A great
looking picture with a nice jazzy score, some funny one-liners, especially in
the second half, a decent plotline, although you shouldn't expect a real mystery
or anything, and some solid acting all around.
I can't say that this is even remotely close to any of Allen's best work, but I
certainly believe it to be a step in the right direction, especially after the
dinky decade of films that he just went through. It's probably better geared
towards Allen fans more than anyone else, but I would still recommend this film
to anyone looking for a cute, "old-school" kind of vibe, with chemistry between
the leads, zippy dialogue and a satisfying conclusion.

C.W. Briggs (Woody Allen) is the top investigator at the North Coast
Fidelity and Casualty Insurance Company. His old school manner conflicts
with the modern business ideas of newly hired efficiency expert Betty Ann
Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt) and the two butt heads constantly. When, during a
coworker's birthday party, a mystic named Voltan (David Ogden Stiers)
chooses the two as his subjects, the hypnotic suggestion he gives them
turns out to be more than just a parlor trick in Woody Allen's latest
flick, "The Curse of the Jade Scorpion."
The Woodman has, for a number of his later films, reached a nadir in his
filmmaking career, especially when compared to those of his heyday like
"Annie Hall" and "Manhattan." His more recent films, like "Shadow and Fog"
and "Celebrity" were almost painful to watch - if you could stand to watch
them at all. He made up some lost ground with "Sweet and Lowdown," mainly
through the efforts of the film's star, Sean Penn. The problem, I have
found, is the diminished quality of the writing by Allen, himself. Even in
his "funny" films there is a lack of pith when compared to his earlier
works.
"The Curse of the Jade Scorpion" reps a partial return to Woody's old
style, but, in the end, it's the lack of depth and less than sparkling
humor that keeps his latest work on the middle ground of his long career.
Sure, there are the one-liners that are a throwback to his old ways - C.W.
"How'd you like it if I hit you?" Tough rich chick Laura Kensington
(Charlize Theron) "How would you like it if I hit you back?" C.W. "Now
that's beginning to sound like fun." - but they certainly are not on a par
with his best work.
That's not to say that "The Curse of the Jade Scorpion" isn't fun. Woody
Allen is one of America's great filmmakers; he just doesn't produce the
great works he used to. Still, for late summer entertainment, it is a
pleasure to watch Allen play the quasi-hardboiled insurance investigator,
Briggs, as he uses old-fashioned instinct, gumshoe work, snitches and
informants to break one tough case after another. The modernity of 1940,
though, spells change for C.W.'s company when his boss, Chris Magruder (Dan
Aykroyd), hires Betty Ann Fitzgerald to shake things up and make the place
more efficient. Betty Ann thinks C.W. is a dinosaur in the business and he
thinks she is something that rhymes with "witch." The pair are always at
odds over how to run the business and are constantly bickering.
When Voltan, at their comrade George's birthday party at a local nightclub,
puts C.W. and Betty Ann under his spell and gives each a hypnotic
suggestion - the trigger words are Constantinople for him and Madagascar
for her - he tells them that they are madly in love with each other. It's
great fun for all, except for Magruder, who is having a clandestine affair
with his efficiency expert. Later, when Briggs is alone, he gets a
mysterious phone call that leads off with the word "Constantinople." It's
Voltan on the other end of the line and the mystic instructs C.W., now
under his spell, to break in to a wealthy clients home and steal every
jewel he can find. Of course, the next day the unwitting Briggs is ordered
to investigate the burglary and declares it an inside job.
When another rich client is burgled, Betty Ann decides to outsource the
investigation and brings in a pair of bumbling private eyes, Joe and Herb
Coopersmith (Peter Linari and Michael Mulheren), to solve the case, but not
before Voltan strikes again. Now, it's up to C.W. and Betty Ann, with the
help of their coworkers, to crack the crimes and clear Briggs's name.
Woody Allen, of late, doesn't delve far beyond his main characters in story
structure. His concentration is on the focal folks and he doesn't spend
much time developing or fleshing out any ancillary individuals around the
main characters. This is true with "The Curse of the Jade Scorpion," but it
is, still, an amusing little flick. My real problem lay between the two
lead characters. I never got the feeling that there would ever be an
attraction between C.W. and Betty Ann, so this required a real leap of
faith for me. Putting that aside, the adversarial conflict between the two
has the most punch in the film as Allen and Hunt play a couple of people
who love to hate each other.
Supporting cast is well rounded though no one is given a great deal to do.
David Ogden Stiers, as Voltan, gets to put a malevolent spin on his con
artist character. Charlize Theron, as the wealthy and caustic Laura, is
introduced as a Veronica Lake look-alike and puts a tough spin on her
character. If anything, Theron is underutilized in a role that she seems to
relish. Dan Aykroyd has proven himself to be an effective character actor
in the past and continues this track record as sleazy boss man Magruder.
Wallace Shawn and Brian Markinson, as C.W.'s coworkers, aren't given much
to do.
Techs are as expected in a Woody Allen film. Zhao Fei has lensed the last
several Allen films and works to keep the look consistent with the maker's
earlier efforts, but, boy, do I miss Gordon Willis behind the camera.
Costume designer Suzanne McCabe helps capture the look of the 40's and
longtime Allen collaborator Santo Loquasto does a solid job on the period
production design. Music, as one expects in a Woody Allen film, is perfect
with its mix of big band swing and combo jazz from the era.
One always hopes that Woody is going to produce another masterpiece like
"Manhattan." We don't get it with "The Curse of the Jade Scorpion," but we
do get a solid middlin' film from the guy. I give it a B-.

There are certain things we've come to expect from a Woody Allen film: the
same music, the same opening credits, the same self-deprecating humor and,
for the most part, a lot of the same acting talent.  His stories often take
place in the 1930s, almost always clock in at under two hours, and are
generally well-received by the press and Oscar (he's a 20-time nominee and
two-time winner).
Despite the somewhat superficial similarities between his films, Woody
always creates original stories.  You can count on him to be daring and
imaginative, year in and year out (literally - he averages at least one film
annually).  No remakes.  No sequels.  You'd sooner see him cheering on
Reggie Miller than writing a derivative, formulaic script.  And he's a
better actor than anyone is willing to admit.
But The Curse of the Jade Scorpion just isn't up to snuff, at least for a
guy who has continually set the bar pretty high.  It's the first film since
1994's Bullets Over Broadway that Woody has made without the help of
Sweetland Films (he's suing former producer Jean Doumanian, and she's suing
him back), and while it's certainly better than most of the hackneyed
romantic comedies out there (like America's Sweethearts, the genre's only
other high-profile summer offering), Scorpion is still disappointing.
Woody (Small Time Crooks) plays C.W. Briggs, an investigator for North Coast
Insurance in late 1930s Manhattan.  He's one of the company's best employees
and, as the film opens, C.W. has just recovered a stolen Picasso from a very
unusual place.  He shuns modern technology (like fingerprinting) in favor of
old techniques and hunches.  When his co-workers ask how he does it, C.W.
informs them that he puts himself in the shoes of the criminal.  "I'd hate
to have me after me," he proudly declares.
That's what they call foreshadowing, kids.  At a birthday party for a
co-worker at the Rainbow Room, C.W. and his arch-nemesis, ball-breaking
efficiency expert Betty Ann Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt, Cast Away), are
hypnotized by a magician named Voltan (David Ogden Stiers) who waves a
supposedly magical jade scorpion in front of them.  Even though the two
passionately hate each other, Voltan gets C.W. and Betty Ann to say
lovey-dovey things to each other while they're under his spell.  Everybody
laughs and goes home, amazed at Voltan's abilities and assuming the trick is
over.
Voltan has other plans, though.  He calls C.W., utters the magic word to put
him under and has him steal millions of dollars' worth of jewels from homes
that he personally has made burglarproof.  He is put in charge of the
investigation and, before long, C.W. is the prime suspect in the heists,
even though he has no memory of committing any crime.
It's pretty easy to stay one step (sometimes two, even) ahead of the plot
(Manhattan Murder Mystery was more of a, uh, mystery).  The rest of Scorpion
focuses on the bizarre relationship between chauvinistic C.W. and Vassar
alum Betty Ann.  The two adversaries trade nasty barb after nasty barb, but
we all know her hurtful words and his threatened masculinity are just a
cover for their attraction to each other - hypnotized or not
While still consistently funny, I can't recall more of Woody's gags falling
as flat as some do in Scorpion.  His C.W. is a sad, horny old man who tells
dated jokes and hits on office bimbos (like Elizabeth Berkeley).  Hunt's
Betty Ann is another educated women who doesn't think twice about boffing
her boss, played by Evolution's Dan Aykroyd (a la Janet McTeer in
Songcatcher).  The horrible things they say to each other, while quite often
humorous, are so surprisingly mean-spirited, I found myself rooting for
Voltan to rake C.W. and Betty Ann over the coals.  And that couldn't have
been Woody's intentions with this film.
Scorpion was photographed by the extremely talented Asian cinematographer
Zhao Fei, who has worked on Woody's previous two films (as well as Chen
Kaige's wonderful The Emperor and the Assassin).  Production designer Santo
Loquasto, who has worked on each of Woody's films since 1987 (that's 15
movies), does a great job at recreating '30s Manhattan (as usual).  And
Woody's direction is typically strong.  It's just a shame his script wasn't.

CURSE OF THE JADE SCORPION, THE (director/writer: Woody Allen; cinematographer:
Zhao Fei; editor: Alisa Lepselter; cast: Woody Allen (C. W. Briggs), Elizabeth
Berkley (Jill), Brian Markinson (Al), Helen Hunt (Betty Ann Fitzgerald), Wallace
Shawn (George Bond), Dan Aykroyd (Chris Magruder), David Ogden Stiers (Voltan),
Charlize Theron (Laura Kensington); Runtime: 103; DreamWorks Pictures; 2001) 
A pleasant film that is not all that good as far as the crime caper story goes,
but still has something about it that is endearing. It's in the tradition of
Hollywood films as escape vehicles, as it evokes a nostalgia for those kind of
B-films that the studios used to routinely put out and were not that worried
about the gaffes in the production. If you're a fan of the 1940s film noir,
especially the classy Billy Wilder "Double Indemnity," then you should find much
in this latest Woody Allen comedy/mystery film to remind you of that film and
others like it. Woody sets this film in 1940 and catches with amazing accuracy
the upholstered apartment furnishings, the lingo of the times, and the clothing
worn and hairstyles. It was like watching one of those B-films, but instead of
being in B & W this one is a lazy color version of it. It's the kind of faded
out coloring that would have been used to make a 1940 film noir, if they were
made in color. The retro scenes of all the interiors were exquisitely designed
by Santo Loquasto and shot by Zhao Fei in mostly plum and gold colors that
burnished on the screen. 
The film is set in NYC in 1940, in an insurance office where 20 year veteran
fraud investigator for the insurance firm, C.W. Briggs (Woody Allen), solves
cases by intuition, luck, his contacts with street characters, and by knowing
the ins and outs of the city. He's a slob at keeping an apartment, a bachelor
womanizer (he had a short and bitter marriage), a losing gambler, and a man in
his 60s who loves his job and the camaraderie he has among his fellow workers
and has no other ambition except to score an occasional young tootsy and solve
fraud cases. Into his satisfied life comes a brainy, slim blonde, efficiency
expert, Betty Ann Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt), who has been hired six months ago by
the boss, Chris Magruder (Dan Aykroyd), to modernize and streamline the place.
She has the upper-hand, even though he's a star claims investigator, because
she's sleeping with the married boss, and therefore is making life difficult for
the recalcitrant investigator. These two are opposites and hate each other
resulting in a war of words, as she rubs him the wrong way even further by
changing the antiquated filing system he is used to. The only satisfaction they
get is from sounding each other out, as one-liners keep coming throughout the
film from both of them. When he tries to smooth things over with her, he only
makes things worse by taking her to a dive he hangs out in, Rocky's bar. 
Celebrating the birthday of his coworker, George Bond (Wallace Shawn), an
amateur magician, they go catch a nightclub magic act. The magician Voltan
(David Ogden Stiers) uses Briggs and Fitz for subjects and hypnotizes them by
having them gaze at the 'Jade Scorpion' pendant to fall in love with each other,
which his coworkers find very amusing. But the evil magician has other plans, as
he never releases them from being under his command. When Briggs is home, he
receives a call from Voltan and he puts him under again by bringing up the word
Constantinople and has him rob the jewels of the wealthy Kensington home. That's
a home he made burglar-proof. After the robbery his memory draws a blank about
what he did, as he investigates the robbery for his firm and believes it's an
inside job. 
Women are used by Briggs as sex objects as Elizabeth Berkley plays Jill, a sweet
secretary with a low I.Q. he has the hots for and has an ongoing affair with,
while Charlize Theron is Laura Kensington, an immoral heiress who finds Briggs
as someone different to go to bed with from her usual pretty-boy athletes. She's
made to look like a poster version of Veronica Lake but she acts like the
vampish Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers) from "The Big Sleep." When she comes
to his shabby flat and peels off her trench coat to let him look at her nude
body, he's all wired up for a night of sex when the phone rings and the evil
magician puts him under again. After the phone call he talks in a trance-like
abnormal way to her about having to leave, as he goes to rob another house. 
Admittedly this is all a thin and rather predictable story incorporating the
usual Woody nebbish sexist and egotististical character, and to make matters
worse it comes with an unbelievable heist plot and with mechanical one-liners
with silly double-entendre sexual meanings. It's a role that he's ritualized and
could do it sleepwalking by now. But it worked for me because I didn't care
about all that and instead got caught up with the film's casual look and the way
it caught the look of the period's film noir, and I found the clash he had with
Helen Hunt brought out the sides of his personality that he's battling within
himself all his artistic life. They were a perfect duo, complementing each
other's missing needs. Woody seems more relaxed in this role than he has been in
his more recent films. This one being his 31st. And, since the film has no
artistic pretensions--it's more a homage to the B-films of the forties, it
seemed easier to handle than some of his more recent ritualized
Woody-by-the-numbers flicks or those pale imitations of those European auteurs
he so much admired like Bergman--films he slavishly imitated that never worked
for him. Mind you, this is not a good film but one that can be viewed as an
escape from reality. Something that is not all that bad during these troubling
economic days of that compassionate conservative administration of President
Bush. Seeing this film made me forget for the moment about Bush's war on stem
cell research and the way he goes out of his way to please his extreme
right-wing supporters and those big corporations that also supported him. The
same purpose could be said of those early films in the forties, with the world
being invaded by Nazis. Escape films were very much in vogue and served a
purpose.  I don't usually care for escape films, but every so often they feel
right and can be enjoyable if you can really escape reality by watching them.
Those are the kinds of films I let my critical guard down on, and that's the
case with this Woody Allen flick.

Starring Woody Allen, Helen Hunt, Dan Aykroyd, Brian
Markenson, Wallace Shawn, David Ogden Stiers,
Elizabeth Berkeley, Charlize Theron. Directed by Woody
Allen. Rated PG.
There may have been a time when Woody Allen was a
formidable auteur, but I do not remember it. With his
last two films in particular, he has gone back to the
strategy that propelled Manhattan Murder Mystery:
shrimpy, arrogant, ultra-neurotic protagonist
inadvertently gets himself in [insert predicament] way
over his head. The formula is appealingly simple, and
Allen's ear for distinctive old-codger dialogue as
well as his equally distinctive acting usually lets
him emerge from his often meandering scripts unharmed.
In The Curse of the Jade Scorpion, however, he takes a
few bruises.
Here, Allen plays CW Briggs, an old, old-fashioned,
successful, insurance investigator in the 1940s who
feels threatened by the arrival of the ironically
named Betty Ann (Helen Hunt), a smart, confident
"efficiency expert" who promised boss Chris Magruder
(Dan Aykroyd) to streamline company operations. The
two have a bantering hatred that is required by films
like this to imply a match made in heaven.
One night, at a company shindig, CW and Betty Ann are
pulled on stage to be guinea pigs for a professional
hypnotist. He gives them both key words --
"Constantinople" and "Madagascar," respectively --
that, when uttered, will put them into a deep trance
and make them malleable to instructions. He makes them
pretend that they are honeymooners madly in love with
each other, to the delight of all present. Later, CW
receives a phone call that begins with
"Constantinople," and ends with instructions to steal
the priceless jewels of the Kensington family as only
he can, since his company set up the security system
that protects them.
It doesn't take a CW Briggs to figure out what happens
next. Briggs, who has no idea what he has done, is put
on the case even as evidence mounts against him. He
confides in Betty Ann and seeks help, and then she
herself is forced to criminal action. Part of the fun
is the film's structure: the villain, after his
introduction, is present only as a sinister voice over
the telelphone (though we do see him as he speaks),
and no other character knows what the hell is going
on. This is mass confusion, very skillfully done.
Some people watch Woody Allen movies solely for the
banter between his characters, and The Curse of the
Jade Scorpion has one-liners aplenty. I especially
liked it when CW bursts into a bewildered Betty Ann's
room waving his arms and yelling "Resist the
temptation to scream!" And who can forget the
priceless "When the light hits you a certain way, you
sort of resemble Mussolini."
Still, you can't help but feel a sense of deja vu.
Allen's plots are so slight that his films play like
comic book issues, with the same irrepressible
character being placed in different situations. I
think he needs a new angle; Jade Scorpion is always
tolerable, and sometimes even more than that, but the
formula won't be able to withstand a new installment.
Oh, and Helen Hunt is amazing, as usual. I maintain
that there is nothing this woman can't do (except save
What Women Want. Neither Woody Allen nor his character
is a match.

The Curse of the Jade Scorpion takes Woody Allen to some truly
unfamiliar territory:  Manhattan!  I mean, can you believe it?  Woody
Allen in New York?  But seriously: At least this time out we're in 1940
NYC, his first real old-timey flick since 1994's Bullets Over Broadway.
It's also (thankfully) another entry in the Slapstick Woody genre (a la
Small Time Crooks), who seems to be doing a good job at keeping Serious
Woody out of the picture since the late 1980s.  Whew!
So how slapsticky are we talking?  Scorpion is the story of C.W. Briggs
(Allen), a top insurance investigator who spars with the "efficiency
expert," Betty Ann (Helen Hunt) brought in to clean up the company. 
They immediately hate one another, but it takes only a dinner theater
gag, courtesy of the great Voltan (David Ogden Stiers), to make hypnosis
subjects of them both and turn them into momentary lovebirds.
It's all in good fun, but late that night, Voltan gives C.W. a call,
re-hypnotizing him and sending him out to do his criminal bidding -- in
this case, stealing precious jewels from C.W.'s own insurance clients,
including a nutty heiress (Charlize Theron).  As the film progresses,
C.W. finds himself the understandable prime suspect in the case, with no
memory of his hypnotism and his crimes.
Of course, as with many of the Woodman's films, the movie is not much
about any of this and you aren't expected to sweat the details. 
Instead, you are invited to sit back as Woody pumps out punch line after
punch line.  Thank God, many of these lines are quite witty and
occasionally laugh-out-loud funny.  If I was brighter, I'd have written
them down so I could use some of the zingers against my more obnoxious
friends and co-workers.  Not all the lines are great, and often there's
a long gap between the juicy moments -- when C.W. and Betty Ann go at it
(verbally) -- recalling the classic Hepburn/Tracy or Hepburn/Grant or,
come to think of it, Hepburn/anyone comedies.  It's an oddity, for sure
-- stilted, but occasionally brilliant as only Allen could spin the
archetypal, mismatched, sparring couple movie.
While Scorpion is pleasant enough, it does get truly tiresome in its
third act, when the film takes up the whole ridiculous hypnotism/robbery
plot in earnest.  The Voltan thing is initially funny, but by the end
it's so distracting there's just no time for to fit in any comedy, which
is obviously the only reason Woody Allen makes any film at all.
Of course, I suspect the real reason Allen made this film is so he could
kiss Charlize Theron, a mere 40 years his younger.

CW Briggs (Woody Allen) believes he's the top insurance investigator in
New York City, but the new efficiency expert brought into the firm, Betty
Ann Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt) thinks he's a dinosaur.  When the two are 
chosen to be part of a nightclub's hypnotism act, code words will turn them
into the criminals they should be investigating in Allen's latest, "The
Curse of the Jade Scorpion."
Finally, the Woodman's back in form with his best flick since 1996's "Everyone
Says I Love You."  Allen, who has a real knack for nostalgic period pieces,
has created a sweet mystery.
CW Briggs is a hard boiled, chauvinistic insurance investigator and one of
Allen's funniest characters.  He goes toe to toe with tough cookie Betty
Ann Fitzgerald, who delivers some of the sassiest insults ever to be volleyed
in a battle of the sexes.  Betty Ann has a secret that makes her appear
suspicious to Briggs, but when revealed, uncovers her vulnerability.
When Briggs gets a late night call from Voltan (David Ogden Stiers, "Everyone
Says I Love You") whispering "Constantinople," he robs the wealthy Kensingtons,
stashes the jewels in his bedroom and has no memory of it.  Investigating
the next day, he meets spoiled Kensington daughter Laura, (Charlize Theron)
the type of gal who swims in fountains and drives fast cars.  She's turned
on because he's different ('I find it strangely exciting standing here in 
this grungy hovel with a myopic insurance investigator,' she purrs when
visiting his apartment).  When Briggs leaves her in his bed to heed another of
Voltan's calls, Laura finds his behavior suspicious.  Briggs discovers that
his boss Magruder (Dan Aykroyd) has taken on Coopersmith detectives who've
interviewed Laura and that he's now a suspect!  As much as Betty Ann presumably
hates Briggs, she doesn't believe he's a crook, but when he's put away, Voltan 
uses her code word 'Madagascar.'
Beautifully shot in a golden glow by cinematographer Zhao Fei ("Raise the
Red Lantern," "Sweet and Lowdown"), "The Curse of the Jade Scorpion" has
both the look and feel of a 40's film.  Allen's plot is like a loving
restoration of a caper from a more innocent time.  His interweaving
suspicions and code words ('Paris' is used by the married Magruder to
convey sweet nothings to his mistress Betty Ann in mixed company) snake 
throughout his screenplay masterfully.  Allen's impeccable choice of music 
includes recordings of Duke Ellington's "Sophisticated Lady" and Glenn 
Miller's "Sunrise Serenade."
"The Curse of the Jade Scorpion" is a solid mid-range effort from the prolific
writer/director that's a delight from start to finish.

     Don't expect brilliance every time from Woody Allen..  With the exception
of a few masterpieces like Annie Hall and Manhattan, what Woody makes is movies
-- funny movies, entertaining movies, sometimes very good movies, movies that
earn their claim on our ticket dollars and a few hours of our time.  He's
established a persona who checks in with different names and occupations but the
same neuroses and mannerisms in one dependable movie a year.  He makes movies in
the tradition of Bob Hope, or Charlie Chan.
     The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is a B movie made with A movie talent.  The
period production design by longtime collaborator Santo Loquasto is stunning,
the cinematography by recent Allen acquisition Zhao Fei is rich and satisfying,
the cast, from Oscar-winner Helen Hunt on down is excellent.  Curiously, Hunt is
often unflatteringly lit  perhaps in an effort to narrow the 28-year generation
gap between her and her romantic lead.  Among the richness of characters and
performances, Charlize Theron is a knockout as a Bad Rich Girl.  
     Allen's direction is uneven.  He gets great work out of his cast, but his
pacing is off  there's plenty of down time to read the EXIT signs and count the
change in your pocket.  His screenplay could have used a few more laps around
the word processor.  It's packed with gags, some of them funny, some of them not
(a mix Allen may recognize  he has  Hunt's character describe him as `a little
man who makes bad jokes.').  The plot has a retread familiarity, and its twists
and turns are just not as clever as they ought to be.  On the other hand, it's
not bad.  It passes the time in an amusing way.  It's comfortable.  
     In a way, Scorpion's B-movieness dovetails nicely with its setting.  The
time is 1940, the place of course is Manhattan, and the deal is this: Woody is
C.W. Briggs, an investigator for a big insurance firm run by the affable
Magruder (Dan Aykroyd).  Briggs is an old-school guy, who gathers tips from his
informer network of blind beggars and street riff-raff, hits on the office
secretaries, hangs out in the neighborhood bar, and solves cases by the seat of
his pants.  `I get inside the criminal mind,' he tells his admiring co-workers. 
`I wouldn't want to have me after me.'
     It's a world that should go on forever, but a serpent has invaded his
Garden.  She's an efficiency expert, Miss FitzGerald (Helen Hunt), and she's
messing with the old ways of doing things.  Briggs and FitzGerald get along like
Arafat and Sharon.  In the world of a movie, no two people who hate each other
that much could be headed anywhere but romance.
     The fulcrum on which Allen's plot turns is a scene with a nightclub
hypnotist (David Ogden Stiers).  From there the plot marches inexorably and
inevitably  one might even say familiarly  to its conclusion.  Echoes of
movies past haunt the frames of Scorpion.  You'll recognize bits of The Court
Jester, The Manchurian Candidate, even The Woman in the Window, and others that
nibble at the fringes of memory.  These days we call that sort of thing homage,
a stream Allen fished for his previous (and most commercially successful) movie,
the Big Deal on Madonna Street-flavored Small Time Crooks. 
     For my money, Allen's best movie in recent years is the hilarious and
smartly original Bullets Over Broadway.  He used a surrogate actor (John Cusack)
to star, and more importantly, he worked with a collaborator (Douglas McGrath)
on the script.  It's a formula worth revisiting.

   When I was eight years old I joined my parents on their annual
two weeks' vacation in upstate New York.  The hotel featured
nightly entertainment.  The big hit was a performance by a Dr.
Polgar, who was at that time a fairly well-known hypnotist. 
Anyway, the entire crowd was convinced that hypnotism is no
fake  when I, a little kid, got called up to the stage to stick pins
into the fingers and arms of a subject who was under the Polgar
spell. No reaction from the poor guy.  I guess everyone figured
that I couldn't be part of the act, a participant in fraud.  The
discussion that followed in the lounge centered on the question:
can a person under a spell be made to do something against his
will?
   In "The Curse of the Jade Scorpion," two people are  made to
do two things that you wouldn't expect them to do if they retained
all their own marbles.  At a party, Insurance investigator CW
Biggs (Woody Allen) and an efficiency expert hired by his firm,
Betty Ann Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt), fall under the spell of
hypnotist Voltan (David Ogden Stiers), each performing a
criminal act.  You'd think that they'd never do something like this
absent the hypnosis, but on second thought Woody Allen, who
wrote and directed this enchanting comedy, gives us reason to
believe that they would indeed have larceny in their hearts.
   However, the concept of the film--the second thing that they
unexpectedly do--is even more intriguing.  By now everyone who
has read even the most cursory primer on pop psychology knows
that the personality we project in public is often just a front, a
cover for our real selves which lie underneath.  In Mr. Allen's
view, hypnosis can shatter our veneer bringing out our true
feelings.  Two people who show terminal animosity toward each
other, fighting like cats and dogs, actually fall in love with each
other, courtesy of Voltan.
   The picture opens in the office of an insurance firm with Woody
Allen in the role of CW Briggs, a crack investigator of shady
claims who always gets his man.  He feels threatened, however,
when the boss, Chris Magruder (Dan Aykroyd), hires an
efficiency expert, Betty Ann Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt), to upgrade
the firm's standing.  Each moment they are together they are like
oil and water, their trading of jibes, their biting repartee forming
the nucleus of the movie's wit.  When a hypnotist, Voltan (David
Ogden Stiers), drags them from the table at a company party,
putting them under the power of a jeweled jade scorpion, he
convinces the pair that they are madly in love.  When he snaps
his fingers, they return to the fray. Later, evidence from a pair of
mansion robberies seems to point to CW Briggs as the perp
rather than the investigator; and when Briggs kicks the
captivating heiress Laura Kensington (Charlize Theron) out of his
bed, everyone is convinced that something strange has
happened to the impeccably honest and hardworking
investigator.  (What's even stranger, and what seems to have
bypassed Mr. Allen's sense of logic, is that Magruder, who is
having an affair with Betty Ann, is planning to take her on a trip to
Paris...in 1940??? Good luck.)
   "The Curse of the Jade Scorpion" is not a laugh-out-loud
comedy, nor should it be judged by how many belly laughs are
evoked from the audience.  If that were the criterion, a vulgar but
often hilarious movie like "American Pie 2" would take the cake,
so to speak.  But Woody Allen's movie, so different from his
typical psychobabble study of relationships, is the year's winner
for its witty dialogue, its simultaneous homage and send-up of old
movies with their (by modern standards) artificial and self-
conscious acting and screwball buffoonery featuring keystone
cops, Veronica-Lake hair styles, and the obligatory serious
drinking and chain smoking.  Woody Allen and Helen Hunt do a
smashing job as people who see each other from the wrong end
of a telescope,  like magnets whose negative charges are placed
side by side with the potential to draw together by a simple twist
(or sleight) of hand.  The 1940's come across with the sepia
tones of Zhao Fei's lensing while the rakish costumes--the
mandatory fedoras for males and long dresses for the women--fit
right in with Santa Loquasto's design of the epoch's non-cubicled
offices.  Blink your eyes and the ravishing Charlize Theron is
Veronica Lake; close them, listen closely to the games of one-
upmanship played by Woody Allen and Helen Hunt, and you're
listening to Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn.  "The Curse
of the Jade Scorpion" may get its name from Chinese mythology
but in Woody Allen's vision the picture is pure Americana.
