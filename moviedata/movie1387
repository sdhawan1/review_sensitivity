You know a film is bad when the reviews and descriptions carry on about
things like costumes and set design.  And let me tell you, the costumes
and set design in The House of Mirth are pretty darn good.  Yes, they
sure are.  Production designer Don Taylor (Brassed Off) and costumer
Monica Howe (Bugsy Malone) do a very admirable job of recreating 1905
New York City.  Yup.    What?  I have how many more
words to write?
Okay  here's the deal.  Mirth, based on Edith Wharton's novel, is an
awful film that features some of the worst acting to deface the big
screen in quite some time.  The X-Files' Gillian Anderson is so
howlingly awful in the lead role, it actually boggles the imagination.
Of course, I could be way off-base here - Anderson won a British
Independent Film Award (beating the likes of Brenda Blethyn, Julie
Walters and Emily Watson), while the director and the film also nabbed
nominations (losing, thankfully, to the impeccable Billy Elliot)
Set in turn-of-the-century Manhattan, Mirth tells the story of Lily Bart
(Anderson), a young socialite in the upper crust of New York society.
She's one of the city's most eligible young women and the envy of her
highbrow female friends because of it.  Lily doesn't have a reliable
source of income and must find a husband that will be able to support
her and the lavish lifestyle she has grown accustomed to by living with
her wealthy aunt (Eleanor Bron, A Little Princess).
Despite his lack of earnings, Lily falls for a lawyer named Lawrence
Selden (Eric Stoltz, Anaconda).  Although Lily is hot for Selden, she
won't marry him because he's poor.  When Lily is spotted leaving
Selden's apartment, she finds herself blackmailed by a social-climbing
property owner (Anthony LaPaglia, Autumn in New York).  Throw in a
couple of bad business investments, mounting gambling debt, a drinking
problem and being turned away by her aunt, and Lily starts slipping down
the social ladder so quickly, she barely touches the rungs.
Mirth is broken up into two sections, with one showing Lily struggling
to find the right man and the other concentrating on her descent into
the gutter.  At the halfway mark, you'll be wondering whether Lily is
too goddamn lazy or too hung up on her pride to  oh, I don't know  get
off her back and get a job.  Lily is a portrayed as a victim, and the
story is supposed to show how horrible it is when women had to depend on
men.  Women had to marry to obtain any kind of social status, while men
had a choice, and  it's just not fair.
There's a fine line between a pace that's methodical and a pace that's
boring, and Mirth writer/director Terence Davies (The Neon Bible) opts
for the latter.  To make matters worse, the story doesn't come close to
having a sympathetic character.  The women are all unlikeable, and the
men are even worse.
I love Anderson on The X-Files, and though the casting of her may have
seemed daring and edgy, it's all wrong.  Think about it  the only
non-Scully role she's landed was in Playing By Heart, which was hardly
awe-inspiring.  And Anderson isn't the only character miscast here.
Mirth features a string of unbelievable casting blunders, with Stoltz
following quickly behind Anderson with one of the year's worst
performances.  There's a reason nobody has seen the last 10 films this
guy has made.  If chemistry were measured on a scale of 1 to 10, the
sparks between Anderson and Stoltz would manage to pull in a negative
number.  When Dan Aykroyd is the best part of an acting ensemble,
viewers should head for the hills.  The actors perform as if Davies
pumped sleeping gas into the set every morning (something I wish they
did to the theatre at my screening of this film).
It's films like this that scare people from reading classic novels by
the likes of Wharton, Henry James and Thomas Hardy.  For every five
great film versions of a period piece based on a popular novel (like
Martin Scorsese's The Age of Innocence, Iain Softley's The Wings of the
Dove and Michael Winterbottom's Jude), it only takes one as bad as Mirth
to tear down everything built up by its far superior brethren.
2:20  PG for boredom-inducing thematic material

In "The House of Mirth" no character is three-dimensional, therefore 
convincing. Not the irritatingly vague Lily, not the hazy male or 
the incomplete supporting female roles. Not even Eleanor Bron, one 
of the movie's rare non-American performers. She plays the 
disapproving, rich aunt whose speech, enunciation and pauses feel 
amateurish in a role that in bygone days would have featured Dame 
May Whitty or Edna May Oliver. (She's unrecognizable from the 
charming parts she used to play in the 60s, as in "Bedazzled.")
I like writer-director Terence Davies's modest output, especially 
his "Distant Voices, Still Lives" (two separate but interconnected 
films in one) and "The Long Day Closes." These are all based on his 
dreary life and working-class family in wartime and post-war 
England. The films are splendid downers in which the only solace for 
their denizens seemed to be lavishly sampled, mostly American pop 
songs and Hollywood flicks. Well worth renting.

The truth is out there.  And the truth is that THE X-FILES's actress 
Gillian Anderson is badly miscast as Lily Bart, the central character in 
Terence Davies's THE HOUSE OF MIRTH, based on Edith Wharton's novel of 
early 1900s manners.  "She is herself with few people only," Lawrence 
Selden (Eric Stoltz) says of Lily.  Who these few people might be is 
unclear since Anderson shows almost no variation in her acting, reading 
her lines with little emotion.
The movie is sometimes fairly enjoyable in spite of the lead rather than 
because of her.  The credit belongs mainly to the script, whose 
delicious thoughts are worth savoring ("Where does dignity end and 
rectitude begin."  "Men have minds like moral flypaper.").  
Several members of the supporting cast also deserve credit.  Lily, who 
has a predilection for gambling and married men, turns to Gus Trenor 
(Dan Aykroyd), a married man who "invests" her money for her, giving 
Lily a handsome return.  A boisterous Aykroyd puts some drive into a 
movie that keeps slipping into neutral.  Anthony LaPaglia plays Sim 
Rosedale, an outspoken man who is the equivalent of today's dot-com 
millionaire.  Rosedale views marriage like a stock investment, and he'd 
like to make a little IPO with Lily.
Best of all, however, is Laura Linney (YOU CAN COUNT ON ME and THE 
TRUMAN SHOW) as Lily's friend and foe, Bertha Dorset.  While hers is 
only a small part, Linney proves how much stronger the film could have 
been had she had the part of Lily.   When Bertha stings Lily with, "A 
married man should not have the burden of being seen alone with a single 
woman," one can just imagine how much more effective Linney would have 
been as the star of the production.   
Although Glasgow stands in for New York, the sets and the costumes are 
authentic looking and sumptuous.  The sound, however, is jarringly dull.  
More music and a heightened use of background sounds would have given 
the film less of a flat feeling.
Sam Goldwyn once remarked, "Why should people go out and pay to see bad 
movies when they can stay at home and see bad television for nothing?"  
And why go to the theater to watch mediocre Masterpiece Theater when you 
can see good Masterpiece Theater on television?
THE HOUSE OF MIRTH runs a long 2:25.  It is rated PG for thematic 
material.  Although there is nothing in it to offend anyone of any age, 
the picture offers little to interest kids under 13.

Lily Bart (Gillian Anderson) is a pretty, intelligent young woman whose
mission in life is to land and wealthy, socially prominent husband in early
20th century New York City. But, her ambitions and bad decisions will come
to haunt her on the road to poverty in director/screenwriter Terence
Davies' adaptation of Edith Wharton's "The House of Mirth."
The period work of Edith Wharton holds no charm, normally, for me, so I was
pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed watching "The House of Mirth."
Lily, as played by "The X-Files" star Anderson, is a strong-minded woman
who, when we meet her, seems certain to get exactly what she wants from
life. She rebuffs the advances of a handsome young lawyer, Lawrence Selden
(Eric Stoltz), who, though well bred, does not earn enough for her liking.
Lily's mercenary nature leads her down a path that will end in poverty and
despair.
While "The House of Mirth" isn't going to break any box office records, it
is still a well-crafted, well-acted film that showcases a top performance
from Gillian Anderson. The actress is pigeon holed in her Agent Scully
persona from "The X-Files," but has proven herself to be a talented
character actor - see her terrific little performance in "The Mighty." In
"House of Mirth" she takes on the starring role and gives one on the best,
most subtle performances of 2000.
The rest of this little gem is equal to the efforts of Anderson. The large
supporting cast provides wonderful depth to the background characters with
solid perfs all around. Anthony LaPaglia, Eric Stolz, Laura Linney (in a
truly, sublimely wicked little role), Eleanor Bron and the rest give
credence and dimension to their well-defined roles.
Helmer/scripter Terence Davies does a marvelous job of adapting the Wharton
novel to the screen. The stage director uses his skilled background to
provide a play-like environment for the actors, but with the benefit of
lush sets and costume that flesh out the material to movie, rather than
stage, stature.
"The House of Mirth" could be a breakout film for Anderson, but a lot
depends on how much box office attention the movie gets. I give it a B+.

Lily Bart (Gillian Anderson) is a beautiful socialite trying to land a
rich husband in the shark infested waters of turn of the century New York
society.  She loves Lawrence Seldon (Eric Stoltz), but won't consider
marrying a working man.  Lily is adept at making bad choices and when
her acceptance of a married man's financial advise is perceived as an
affair, her fortunes quickly nosedive in writer/director Terence Davies'
Edith Wharton adaptation, "The House of Mirth."
British director Davies ("Distant Voices, Still Lives") has gathered an
unusual cast and set them in an unusual stand-in for New York (Glasgow, 
Scotland) to tell Wharton's tragic tale.  They (mostly) work.
Lily doesn't value her lover until she discovers she has a competitor,
Mrs. Bertha Dorset (Laura Linney, "You Can Count on Me").  (She later
comes into possession of Bertha's love letters to Seldon - she's mistakenly
blackmailed by a housekeeper at his apartment building, The Benedict,
who's seen Lily leaving Seldon's rooms - which could provide her only
means of salvation.)  Yet she still parades her prospects in front of 
Lawrence in a kind of 'we're all adults here' manner.  She doesn't treat
these men much better.  Mr. Gryce (Pearce Quigley) becomes discouraged
with her lack of attention and Mr. Rosedale (Anthony Lapaglia), while
rich, isn't deemed of proper social standing.
After she discovers that the investment earnings of $10,000 given her 
by a hopeful Gus Trenor (Dan Aykroyd) were really gifts, she's determined 
to repay the money which she's already spent.  Her social circle, however, 
shuns her, for having kept company with the married Trenor.  Her inheritance 
from her wealthy aunt (Eleanor Bron, "The Little Princess"), $10,000, is long 
in coming and her spiteful cousin Grace (Jodhi May, "A World Apart") refuses 
to help. Now Mr. Rosedale considers her damaged goods.  Only the eccentric 
Carry Fisher (Elizabeth McGovern) will remain her friend.  A position as a 
companion ends when her employer Mrs. Hatch (Lorelie King) enters society 
and an apprenticeship at a milliner's fails as well.  She refuses help from a 
truly distressed Rosedale, who somehow knows, and reminds her of, Bertha's 
incriminating letters.
Any who judge Anderson as wooden based on her portray of "The X-Files'"
Agent Scully will surely change their opinion after viewing her work here.
Although she seems a bit too modern at first (a problem that costars
Dan Aykroyd and Anthony Lapaglia don't overcome), Anderson turns that
into an asset as she gets into Lily Bart's skin.  As Lily's over confidence,
even snobbery, turns to disbelief, then resignation, Anderson fully engages 
us in Bart's complex and unfair situation.  The wash of emotions that
play over Anderson's face when Mr. Rosedale tells the impoverished Lily
that 'you could wipe your feet on them' (referring to society) is one of
the finest pieces of acting in the year 2000.  It's a brilliant performance.
Stoltz plays Seldon cooly, as a man of privilege, who retains control of
his emotions until it's too late.  McGovern, a fine, under utilized actress,
is solid as the unconventional Mrs. Fisher.  Laura Linney pulls out her
claws as the shrewish, manipulative Bertha.  Dan Aykroyd isn't quite right
as Gus Trenor.  Lapaglia also seems miscast as Sim Rosedale, although when
his character's standing rises above Lily's he wears the role more
successfully.
Davies' adaptation encompasses all the layers and below surface simmerings
of Wharton's story.  His modern use of cigarettes to signify passion is
amusing - where there's smoke, there's fire.  Things are said loudly,
without being said at all, such as when Rosedale tells Lily he owns The
Benedict and informs her that its name means confirmed bachelor.
The location choice of Glasgow, which is strong in Victorian architecture, 
doesn't capture a New York feel, but Davies uses intimate shots to focus on 
his characters rather than their surroundings.  This Wharton adaptation is 
very different from Scorcese's "The Age of Innocence," where costume and 
art production were lively and pushed to the forefront.  Davies' film is dark, 
brooding and a bit heavy feeling (cinematography by Remi Adefarasin 
("Elizabeth") and production design by Don Taylor ("Emma")).
"The House of Mirth" is an ironic title for a literary heroine with an
ironic fate.  Lily Bart's story is compelling and Gillian Anderson's 
portrayal of her is inspired.

     Draw near and bear witness to Gillian Anderson, a very successful
television actress (The X Files) who is still trying to find her legs on
the big screen.  Like many before her, she will try a tactic that has
made stars out of otherwise B-list actors: By taking the leading role in
an art house flick.
     Welcome then to The House of Mirth, a period piece which bears
little happiness for those within.  Or, ultimately, for those in the
audience.
     It is New York City in 1905, a town full of promise in an era of
drawing rooms in which tea is still served every afternoon.  On the
fringe of society is Miss Lily Bart (Anderson), a brazen vixen who has
yet to marry and wears red gowns to the symphony when everyone else has
dressed down.  She's a bit of a bad girl: She smokes, she skips church,
and she's "on the hunt" for a husband.  And her bad habits have spilt
over into her social life.
     She dallies with the lawyer Lawrence Selden (Eric Stoltz) in an
apparent affair, but pities him because he actually has to work.  Gus
Trenor (Dan Aykroyd, in his best role in decades) also offers his
affections, but, alas, he's married.  And then there's Sim Rosedale
(Anthony LaPaglia), a kind of Michael Milken for the Industrial Age. 
None present very good husband choices, which leads Miss Bart to take
all kinds of measures to find a mate.  Ultimately, through a falling out
with her best friend Bertha (Laura Linney) -- for reasons which I still
don't understand -- she finds her status in society plummeting, as
Bertha singlehandedly engineers her descent -- off camera.
     It's a worthy tale of blackmail and backstabbing, but unfortunately
it is told in the traditional, corseted, Masterpiece Theatre manner that
sadly leaves virtually all of this treachery (and the juiciness) behind
the scenes.  With a PG rating, there's nary a heaving bosom to behold
and only one slap to the face to get your pulse going.  One can only be
thankful the film isn't narrated a la The Age of Innocence, a film with
which The House of Mirth otherwise has much in common.  (Both are based
on Edith Wharton novels, and it's apparent the former was her better
work.)
     At the crux of the problem is director Terence Davies, who has
structured the film with an unfortunate lack of foresight.  A number of
unnecessary scenes are loaded on, but this is not counterbalanced by
much-needed explanatory scenes that have somehow gone missing.  The
ultimate effect is to make The House of Mirth a somber experience that
drags on and on at a ponderous pace that would be far too slow if you
didn't need the time to construct your own plot in its apparent absence.
     Much has already been said of Anderson's aplomb with her role, but
often the picture feels a bit like Stoltz and Anderson are reading for a
play off-Broadway or in their backyard, their lines delivered in a
manner that feels smarmy and disingenuous.  Not for a second does
Anderson look at home in period dress.  But at the same time, she has a
way of saying "delicious" that simply makes you melt.  Overall, the
decently apt cast is hardly stellar.
     Which leaves us with the theme of our tale.  As it turns out, The
House of Mirth hasn't aged all that well since it was originally
written, which would explain why it hasn't been made into a feature film
since 1918.  Put simply: Morality at the turn of the last century just
doesn't translate well to morality at the turn of this one.  Exactly how
Miss Bart gets into her predicament is unclear, as Bertha has the worst
reputation of the bunch.  Why would anyone listen to her?  Ultimately, I
just didn't buy the story.
     But in the end, Miss Bart's sad tale of woe is at least a bit
universal.  Like so many others, Miss Bart is a victim of her own
naďveté, stuck in a world where there truly are no good guys, and yet
she relies on others for aid.  (Stoltz's character is the closest we are
given to a hero, and he's hardly a stand-up chap.)  Can unsubstantiated
gossip still sink a person?  I suppose so, but who can imagine not
fighting back?

   I know a woman--and I'm sure you are familiar with the
type as well--who was the daughter of a moderately
successful professional man but who wanted far more wealth
and status than she was afforded.  She herself married a
highly successful lawyer and made her home in one of the
toniest burgs of New York's Long Island communities.  She
allegedly taught second grade for a year or two (though I
doubt her word on this), and to this day regularly chats with
her pals about the accoutrements of the family's latest auto,
the most recent trip to Provence or Tuscany, or the $100
repast she enjoyed with her group of ladies who lunch, which
she calls money well spent because "I'm worth it."  At the
same time she has no hesitations about confiding in what her
latest psychiatrist told her "the one I got after I fired the last
guy who did me no good" or about the handsome
European man she once met just before her marriage, "the
one I always wonder about...whether I should have accepted
his proposal instead."  This is a woman in conflict, a very rich
woman who dimly realizes that her life is empty, that she
never had any real work or identity of her own.
   Edith Wharton's partly autobiographical "The House of
Mirth," which deals with yet another individual who is of the
manor born but who, through a combination of her own
arrogance and thoughtlessness overwhelms her basic
integrity and contempt for hypocrisy meets a tragic fate, has
been successfully adapted into a richly textured drama. 
Filmmaker Terence Davies--who, though a methodical pace
and a wise refusal to make even his own dialogue sound too
contemporary--has brought to vivid life the compromises that
prominent women had to make as recently as the turn of the
Twentieth Century to keep their position.  When reputation
counted for all and a willingness to play by all the rules of
social convention was the only ticket to maintaining a
position in polite society, a decent woman with a mind of her
own had to accommodate herself to an often suffocating
existence in a world ruled thoroughly by men.  While Terence
Davies' "The House of Mirth" could be called a film
celebrating our current age of women's liberation, such a
stamp reduces the film to mere propaganda when in fact the
story is at heart a biting satire on a venal, insincere cosmos
of political and social backstabbing and of pathetic
compromises.
   In the central role of Lily Bart, Gillian Anderson ("The X-
Files") inhabits the guise of a woman who is described by
Miss Wharton at one point as "vigorous and exquisite, at
once strong and fine," and who as such is a welcome albeit
risky casting choice by Mr. Davies. While another filmmaker
might have gone with, say, Helena Bonham-Carter, Ms.
Anderson--who cannot be called a young, blushing beauty,
displays the bounce that made her the perfect choice to play
Special Agent Scully opposite her TV co-star David Duchovny
in the long-running series.  Displaying a brash indifference to
social convention, her character, Lily Bart, opens the movie
by accepting an invitation to tea by man-about-town lawyer
Lawrence Selden (Eric Stoltz)--inside his New York
apartment!  Though unmarried now and in her late twenties,
Ms. Bart takes the first step toward a slow descent in position
after begin spotted leaving the building by its owner, the
fabulously rich Sim Rosedale (Anthony LaPaglia), a fellow
who is both feared and respected by others in New York
society and yet whose identity as a Jew--so pronounced in
Wharton's novel--remains strangely unmentioned in the film.  
  Flirtatious to a fault, Lily is obviously in lust with Selden but
no union of marriage or even of much physicality takes place
because for her part, Lily is unwilling to combine forces with a
fellow who, relative to othes of her acquaintance, is poor,
while Selden--who seems to teach Lily that the conventions of
polite society are empty--is himself unwilling to break with
those very rules.  In other words, Selden is the story's
leading sellout.  
   With Ms. Anderson in virtually every scene, scripter-director
Davies takes us slowly and patiently into her decline,
tightening the noose almost imperceptibly during the 140-
minute piece so that we are scarcely aware until the
cataclysmic conclusion that Lily has been both lanced by
society and a victim of self-inflicted wounds.  The gambling
debts that transform her from a grande dame who believes
she has the world under her thumb thanks to her beauty and
charm become but a factor contributing to her loss of
reputation.  More important--and more cinematic as well--are
the by the ways that others in her little world use her to
satisfy their selfish ambitions.  Ms. Wharton's heroine joins
the likes of the eponymous character in Francois Truffaut's
1975 film "The Story of Adele H," done in ironically enough
by her decency and her stupidity.
   Whether this film works for you or not depends on your
capacity to enjoy a story that is uncompromisingly a period
piece, rich in costumes and even stilted in dialogue--all the
more to encourage us to think of the very contemporary
resonance that this director's decision evokes.  Davies shows
us not simply the avaricious and venomous nature of New
York society in 1905, but by extension demonstrates Edith
Wharton's own cynicism about the world in general.  Just as
Lily's "friend," Bertha Dorset played by the marvelous Laura
Linney as a bubbly, adulterous good-time-girl, is perfectly
willing to throw her buddy to the wolves to protect her own
reputation, so are politicians and businesspeople and, yes,
even the ordinary guy on the street agreeable to stab us in
the back when this suits their own ends.  As rich investor Gus
Trenor (Dan Aykroyd) demands sex as the price for
subsidizing Lily's waning fortune, so are many of us today
agreeable to demanding favors of woman whom they take out
to dinner and for whom they buy expensive presents.  
   While we can criticize Davies and Wharton alike for
displaying men as one-dimensional fixtures, some perhaps
even as plot devices, we should understand that Ms.
Anderson's Lily is in every way the axis around which an
entire organization evolves.  Though Eleanor Bron's
performance as Lily's rich aunt, Mrs. Peniston, is a caricature
worthy of Oscar Wilde's counterpart in "The Importance of
Being Earnest," Dan Aykroyd does fine in a serious role as a
male chuavinist pig, Eric Stoltz as a cool, conflicted playboy,
and Anthony LaPaglia as a complex person who withdraws
his offer of marriage when he no longer sees Lily as a trophy
bride. Talk about contemporary resonance!  If tragedy is
about bad things happening to a good person, this "House of
Mirth" easily justifies the irony in its very title.
