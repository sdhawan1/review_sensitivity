In its own way, `Hearts in Atlantis' is just as silly as `Zoolander.'  It
just isn't supposed to be.  `Hearts' is one of those swelling-score-laden movies
dripping with quality that practically have Oscar acceptance speeches written
into the screenplay.  Item: Anthony Hopkins, Sir Anthony Hopkins, an actor whose
presence in a movie fairly screams Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.  Item: Scott
Hicks, director of the wonderful `Shine' and the maligned `Snow Falling on
Cedars', a man who knows how to polish a movie and showcase a character.  Item,
William Goldman, the celebrated screenwriter who earned his place in the cinema
pantheon with `Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' in 1969 and the incomparable
Hollywood study Adventures in the Screen Trade  in '83. Item, Stephen King, the
best-selling author who moves between horror and sensitivity with the élan of a
Rudy Giuliani.  
The story here comes from the sensitive side of King, the side that
produced `The Shawshank Redemption', `The Green Mile', and the end-of-childhood
melodrama `Stand By Me'.  Childhood ends again in `Hearts of Atlantis', this
time the childhood of 11-year-old Bobby Garfield (Anton Yelchin), who lives in a
small Connecticut town with his self-absorbed mother, Liz (Hope Davis), a
cold-blooded skinflint who gives him a library card for his birthday instead of
the bike he wants.  His father died when he was little, and left his mother with
a lot of bills and a chip on her shoulder.  `He never met an inside straight he
didn't like,' she tells Bobby bitterly.
Things get cooking when elderly Mr. `call-me-Ted' Brautigan (Anthony
Hopkins) moves in upstairs, and offers Bobby a buck a week to read the
newspapers to him and keep an eye out for `low men' who may be closing in on
him.  Ted seems to have some sort of mind-reading gift (`People call it a
gift.I've always found it more of a burden.'), and he goes off from time to
time into glassy-eyed trances.  When he's not doing that he encourages Bobby to
read, and tells him stories; listening to Ted recount the comeback game of
football legend Bronco Nagurski is like hearing a play-by-play from Alistair
Cooke on Prozac.
The movie is framed, and perhaps you've encountered this device before, by
the present day funeral of a boyhood friend, where middle-aged Bobby (David
Morse) has his memory bank jimmied by a battered old baseball glove (which
doesn't figure in the movie any more importantly than Atlantis does.)  Back we
go to 1959, or at least they say it's '59, although the songs on the
available-in-stores soundtrack jump around disorientingly  from '55 (`OnlyYou',
`Aint That a Shame', `Sh-Boom') to '60 (`The Twist').
Lost innocence is a metaphor we can't get enough of in this country, and
innocence is lost with profligate carelessness here.  Bobby loses his, his
childhood sweetheart (Mika Boorem) loses hers, his Mom loses hers in a scene
where she must be the only person in the theater who doesn't see it coming.  The
country is poised to lose its as well, with low men skulking about and the faint
shadow felt of a young candidate for President who will not live out his term.
You can't make a movie with this kind of talent and not wind up with some
wonderful stuff.  There are moments of real charm.  Hope Davis is solid,
youngsters Yelchin and Boorem are good, and Hopkins is impressive as always,
though he often seems to be in another movie, reciting from the Tibetan Book of
the Dead.  The photography by the late Piotr Sobocinski (Krzysztof Kieslowski's 
cameraman) is beautiful.  But too much of the movie seems projected through a
Hallmark card, dredged in treacle and powdered sugar.  It may not be impossible
to enjoy this movie, but it might well be embarrassing.

With his last two films - Shine and Snow Falling on Cedars - Australian 
director Scott Hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the 
best out there, and his latest, Hearts in Atlantis, is no different.  Its 
structure - beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in 
the middle - is similar to The Green Mile, which is a bit ironic considering 
both were based on Stephen King books.  The parallels don't end there, 
either.  Atlantis was adapted by William Goldman, who had previously penned 
the big-screen version of Misery and is in the process of working on the 
script for King's Dreamcatcher.  Even the film's content is a bit 
reminiscent of Mile.  In fact, it's the perfect blend of the feel-good '60s 
nostalgia of Stand By Me (also by King) and mystical power hokum of Mile. 
King's Atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories, but the 
main focus here is on the first (and longest) tale, called Low Men in Yellow 
Coats (the film's title comes from the second chapter).  It's set in 1960 
Harwich, Connecticut, where 11-year-old Bobby Garfield (Anton Yelchin) lives 
in a boarding house run by his cold, self-centered mother Elizabeth (Hope 
Davis, Joe Gould's Secret), who seems to care more about her wardrobe than 
her son.  Bobby spends his time with his two closest friends, John Sullivan 
(Will Rothhaar) and tomboy Carol Gerber (Mika Boorem), who become something 
like the Kevin, Paul and Winnie of Harwich. 
When a new tenant moves into the vacant room, the fatherless Bobby finds a 
male role model in Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins, Hannibal), a mysterious 
stranger who is vague enough about his past to make Bobby's mom suspicious 
enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror.  Ted 
teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature (after his 
cheapskate mother gives him a library card for his birthday), dispenses 
prophetic words of wisdom and even pays Bobby one dollar a week to read him 
the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the Low Men, a group of 
people chasing Ted to exploit his special powers.  I won't go into what 
these powers are, but they're considerably toned down from the book (and 
don't involve black stuff flying out of Ted's mouth, a la Mile). 
Atlantis' present-day setting which bookends the film is based on the 
novel's final chapter, titled Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling, and 
features David Morse (in yet another connection to The Green Mile) as a 
married, middle-aged Bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood 
friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his 
formative years. 
Atlantis is nowhere near as flashy as Hicks' Cedars, which is disappointing 
but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing Robert 
Richardson to the occasionally amazing Piotr Sobocinski, the Oscar-nominated 
cinematographer behind Krzysztof Kieslowski's Red.  The acting is solid from 
everyone, including Hopkins, who never once makes you think of Dr. Lecter. 
Most impressive are youngsters Yelchin and Boorem, who both had tiny parts 
in Along Came a Spider. 
While I didn't really have much of a problem with Goldman's screenplay, I do 
need to point out at least one inconsistency.  Goldman, for those of you who 
don't read Premiere, writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody 
else's films, carefully explaining why they all suck, make no sense and 
insult their audiences, while somehow failing to mention the crap that he's 
penned (like The General's Daughter).  It's mean-spirited but fun to read, 
mostly on account of nobody else in Hollywood having the balls to say 
anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business (including 
Michael Jackson, O.J. and Robert Blake).  In Atlantis, which is supposed to 
be told through the eyes of young Bobby, one would assume he would have to 
be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back. Well, 
he's not, and it doesn't make sense. 
1:41 - PG-13 for violence and thematic elements

  HEARTS IN ATLANTIS (director: Scott Hicks; screenwriters: William Goldman
/Stephen King novel; cinematographer: Piotr Sobocinski; editor: Pip Karmel;
cast: Anthony Hopkins (Ted Brautigan), Anton Yelchin (Bobby Garfield), Hope
Davis (Liz Garfield), Mika Boorem (Carol Gerber), David Morse (Adult Bobby
Garfield), Will Rothhaar (Sullivan), Dierdre O'Connell (Mrs. Gerber), Timothy
Reifsnyder (Harry Doolin); Runtime: 101; Warner Brothers; 2001) 
Australian director Scott Hicks (Shine/Snow Falling on Cedars) has adapted a
Stephen King novel for his latest film. It's a film that has the promise of
being a horror story but that never quite comes together, as the film plays more
like a schmaltzy nostalgia piece and bland character study about an all-American
child of the 1950s, Bobby Garfield, who is in a bland coming-of-age film. The
11-year-old Bobby (the child-Anton Yelchin) is befriended by an eccentric older
man who boarded in his widowed mom's private house during the summer of 1960. 
The story is told in flashback by the adult Bobby Garfield (the adult-David
Morse). He is a middle-aged photographer who receives via Fed Ex a package
containing an old baseball glove from his childhood friend Sully (Will
Rothhaar), a glove he once coveted. Sully has just passed away. This inheritance
stirs up childhood memories, as he goes back for the funeral and visits his
childhood neighborhood of low-income private houses on quiet tree-lined streets
in Norwich, Connecticut, and he recalls that eventful summer and his intense
friendship with Sully and the first girl he kissed Carol Gerber (Mika Boorem).
She's a sweet blonde, whose kiss on the stalled Ferris wheel will be the one he
will judge all other kisses. He's saddened to learn at the funeral that she is
also dead. When he moved at the end of that summer to Massachusetts they never
corresponded and lost contact, even though they promised to always keep in
contact. 
The problem with this look back at his childhood memories is that we are being
overwhelmed with an orgy of nostalgia-- from the Platter's singing rock & roll,
flashy vintage cars, the Lone Ranger on TV, and many other memories from the
early 1960s. There's not much of a story here that isn't a contrivance, or
dripping with goo, or heading nowhere. 
It's basically a film about Anthony Hopkins hamming it up as Ted Brautigan the
mysterious stranger who comes with his possessions in a shopping bag to stay at
Liz Garfield's working class neighborhood residence, renting out her attic space
and forming a father-son relationship with the boy who craves a father figure to
counter his self-absorbed mother who selfishly has no time or committment to
love him since her husband died six years ago leaving her broke and having to
work as a secretary in a real-estate office. She instantly doesn't like Ted, at
first saying she doesn't trust anyone who moves with shopping bags, to later
suspecting him of being a homosexual, and finally to just not feeling
comfortable with him. The viewer is led to believe that Ted might be a possible
child molester, a discharge from a mental asylum, a harmless transient, or
someone being hunted by the Mafia or FBI. He doesn't appear to be the wise and
spiritual man he's passing himself off as. And he doesn't appear to be a great
seer, or someone who is very sensitive because he was hurt. If he was a
mind-reader, why would he tell the woman who hates his guts where he's going
when there are unfriendly people offering a reward for him! 
As the friendship grows between the boy and the stranger, we are forced to hear
such banal profundities from the pen of King uttered through the lips of Hopkins
as:  "Sometimes when you're young, you have moments of such happiness, you think
you're living in someplace magical, like Atlantis must have been." He also
reflects: "Then we grow up, and our hearts break into two." 
He gives the kid a root beer on his visits to the attic; pays to have the kid
read the newspaper to him and keep watch on strangers in town he calls the "low
men;" advises him on which classics to read (the kid chooses "Lost Horizon"), as
he now has an adult library card thanks to his mother's birthday gift; and, he
tells the impressionable kid, whom he calls kiddo to my dismay, that he's on the
run from the "low men" who are dangerous thugs who drive flashy cars and wear
dark suits and fedoras and who put up deceptive posters for lost pets all over
town to locate him. Who these "low men" are is never answered, by we are
eventually led to believe that they could be FBI men who want to use his psychic
gifts to help them flesh out Commies and read minds. Needless to say, the kid
also finds that he has temporary psychic powers as he goes to a country fair and
tests his skills with a card shark and wins. This comes after mom warns him to
never play cards for money like his dad, whom she said was a loser. 
Everything about this film felt loaded down with good versus evil characters,
with situations that seemed manufactured and did not have any flow to them. The
scene that annoyed me the most, was that formulaic bully scene between Harry
Doolin who is not only a bully who beats up Carol and Bobby, but he's also an
in-the-closet queer who calls Bobby a queer to draw attention away from him. You
can bet your Schwinn Black Phantom bike that Bobby will get physical revenge on
him before this gooey pic ends. In fact you can guess how everything will turn
out because there's no real story in this failed mystery story. The film's all
about a contrived atmospheric mood it sets in mystery to lead you to believe
something is going on, as it hopes your imagination will be better than the
author's in finishing the story. 
In the end Hopkins' portrayal is too creepy and ambivalent to draw any
conclusion about what all his inward hurt means and why he seems so strange and
saddened. We never see any of the lead characters develop or really get to know
them, we are only led to what they might be or what they represent. Everyone
seemed like a cardboard character waiting for either the "low men" to emerge or
for another trite golden nugget of wisdom to fall from the lips of Hopkins. This
film isn't even good enough to be considered a middle-brow art-house film, as
it's a commercial film that tries to be a little off-kilter with little to offer
in the way of suspense.

HEARTS IN ATLANTIS is a sweet, touching and rather usual film that is based on a
Stephen King novel.  No, it's not a horror movie.  But, what is it exactly?  As
the story evolves with quiet power, it is never clear where it is going or what
kind of movie it will become.  A low-key foreboding serves more as part of the
ambiance than as a hint of the future.  If the movie, directed by Scott Hicks
(SHINE) and written by William Goldman (BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID),
must be characterized, it might be as STAND BY ME 2.
The well cast film is a character study that revolves around relationships.  The
central character, 11-year-old Bobby Garfield (Anton Yelchin), is a fatherless
kid with a self-centered mother (Hope Davis), who squanders the family's meager
income on her fancy wardrobe.  One day in the early 1960s, his life is
transformed by a boarder, Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins), who comes to live in
the apartment above them.  A generous and mysterious man, Ted becomes a father
figure for Bobby.  Something of a scholar, Ted loves quoting famous figures and
sharing his own quotable thoughts with Bobby and his friends.  The most
prophetic of these is, "Sometimes when you're young, you have moments of such
happiness, you think you're living in someplace magical, like Atlantis must have
been.  Then we grow up, and our hearts are broken in two."
Bobby is at a key transitional moment in his life.  His view of the opposite sex
is moving from the "yuck" phase to the time when he would love to kiss a girl
but would never admit it.  Luckily for him, one of his best pals, Carol, just
happens to be female.  Young love has rarely been shot with more honesty and
delicacy.  The late Piotr Sobocinski's cinematography of Bobby and Carol at a
local carnival park is sheer magic.  Sobocinski, a second-generation
cinematographer, is best known for his Oscar nominated work on Krzysztof
Kieslowski's RED.
The scene-stealer in HEARTS IN ATLANTIS is Mika Boorem, who plays Carol.  It is
the sort of performance that will have you scratching your head wondering where
you have seen her before.  The answer is that she was in THE PATRIOT and both
she and Yelchin were in ALONG CAME A SPIDER.  The camera loves her, and she
delivers a dead-on performance.  The more important question is whether
producers will recognize her potential and give her the parts she deserves so
that she becomes the next Meg Ryan and not the next Molly Ringwald. 
HEARTS IN ATLANTIS runs 1:41.  It is rated PG-13 for "violence and thematic
elements," and would be acceptable for kids around 10 and up.
The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, September 28, 2001. 
In the Silicon Valley, it will be showing at the AMC and the Century theaters.

   We tend to repress the bad things that have happened to us in
our youth.  When we call up our memories, we recollect so much
that was heavenly, so much to indicate that life is a miracle, that
we think we are in a magic kingdom--like Atlantis.  This is, more
or less, what Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins) tells us as he
sadly adds that life's being what it is, our hearts would soon
break in two.  Mr. Hopkins plays his role so convincingly that
while we never see him as he was fifty years ago, he comes
across in part as a loving person but mostly as a man who has
seen all too much of life (in fact his eyes are failing him now): his
demeanor is somber throughout.  "Hearts in Atlantis" is a coming-
of-age tale focusing on humankind's eleventh summer when we
have not yet lost our curiosity and fertile imaginations and have
perhaps experienced our first kiss.  That kiss is the one we'll
remember all our lives, in Ted's prescient words.
   In adapting Scott Hicks's movie to the screen, William Goldman
("Boy and Girls Together") exorcises some of novelist Stephen
King's supernatural themes to concentrate on the human drama--
which constitutes, after all, the best particular about the Maine
resident's writing.  "Hearts" opens on a melancholy Robert
Garfield (David Morse), who has just learned that his best friend
from way back, Sully (Will Rothhaar) has died and, even worse,
the adorable girl friend of his youth with whom he had shared a
first kiss, Carol Gerber (Mika Boorem), has passed away as well. 
While the adult Garfield frames the story, the bulk of the film
deals with Bobby Garfield (Anton Yelchin) as an eleven-year-old
kid, an enthusiastic, intelligent and happy boy whose life appears
impoverished only because his mother, Elizabeth (Hope Davis)
cannot afford to get him the Schwinn bicycle he admires since his
dad had died the year before leaving only a pile of bills.  
   "Hearts in Atlantis" appears to ask us whether an adult we had
come across in our pre-teen days, whether a teacher, a
neighbor, or even a sports personality that we know from afar,
has affected us so much that our lives have been permanently
changed for the better.  Ted Brautigan is such a person for
Bobby, a strange person with psychic powers who becomes a
border in the dilapidated Connecticut home of the Garfields, who
pays the boy a dollar a week to read the newspapers to him and
therefore arouses the suspicions of Bobby's not-too-trusting
mother.  Scott Hicks, whose masterful achievement  "Shine"
deals as well with a prodigy who is being smothered by an
overbearing parent but who finds his first love, directs this work
with a sure hand, allowing the brilliant Anthony Hopkins to find
the sadness in Ted's character while gaining some delight as a
mentor to an impressionable young man.  Anton Yelchin as the
eleven-year-old appears not at all intimidated playing next to this
legendary performer, evoking both the bliss of a kid who
discovers love for the first time (and ultimately that Schwinn bike
as well) but has his heart broken in the midst of his existence in
his metaphorical Atlantis.  The production is a lovely one, quietly
moving, respectful enough of its audience to deal discretely with
a scene of violence involving Elizabeth while stressing inner
conflict over external strife.  The period is evoked subtly: "The
Lone Ranger" plays on TV, the Platters dominate the
phonograph.  Photographer Piotr Sobocinski elicits the feel of the
golden age of both young Bobby and the aging Ted with sepia
tones.   A formulaic Hollywood ending is avoided in favor of a
more realistic and sober assessment of the lives of people who
learn to confront their fears, appreciate the moment, and
perceive life as both a series of routine exercises and the shock
of striking moments.
Rated PG-13.  Running time: 101 minutes.  (C) 2001 by

Starring Anton Yelchin, Anthony Hopkins, Hope Davis.
Directed by Scott Hicks. Rated PG-13.
Film adaptations of Stephen King novels are
notoriously uneven. For every Green Mile and Carrie,
there's a Thinner and a Children of the Corn. Despite
the dubious track record, Hearts in Atlantis seemed
like it couldn't lose. The film, based on a) a
critically acclaimed b) coming-of-age-tale with c) no
elements of horror, would star d) Anthony Hopkins and
be directed by e) Scott "Shine" Hicks. If all else
fails, the resulting effort would at least have to be
interesting.
Turns out that the movie is a great deal more than
merely interesting. It's a wonderful, nostalgic piece,
closest in mood and spirit of another great Stephen
King movie: Stand By Me. Bobby Garfield (Anton
Yelchin) is an average pre-teen growing up in the
1960's. His father didn't leave them a penny when he
left, as his bitter, self-absorbed mother Elizabeth
(Hope Davis) doesn't fail to remind him every chance
she gets. A boarder moves into the upstairs apartment,
a kindly, slightly eccentric gentleman named Ted
Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins).
Brautigan offers to pay Bobby a dollar a week to read
the daily paper to him and, despite the warnings and
suspicions of his mother, soon becomes a friend and a
mentor. He's no child molester, but there's something
strange about him all the same. He tells Bobby to look
out for "low men" in the "Dickensian sense;" crooks
who want something from him and will circle their prey
like hyenas before moving in for the kill. Once in a
while, he goes into a trance and wakes up with a yell.
And how does he know all those things about everyone
around him, anyway?
There is a supernatural element to the story, yes, but
it is little more than a backdrop, a red herring for
the simply elegant coming-of-age story that is the
film's real concern. It is no accident that the "low
men" are never anything but ciphers, and there are no
dramatic showdowns with people hanging off catwalks by
their fingernails. There is, however, a boy: a real
boy, intelligent and not at all whiny, who, we
suspect, will never be the same again.
It is a redundancy to say that Anthony Hopkins gives
an Oscar-caliber performance, since every one of his
roles fits that qualification. It should be said,
though, that young Anton Yelchin, seen previously as
the son of a Russian official in Along Came a Spider,
could give Haley Joel Osment a run for his money as
child acting prodigy of the moment; while Osment is
amazing at playing characters in extraordinary
situations, Yelchin, two years younger, excels at
portraying a regular kid though he, too, radiates an
intelligence beyond his years.
Had Hearts in Atlantis cut its first ten minutes and
its last five, it may have been a masterpiece;
instead, it hedges its bets on an awkward framing
device, a series of present-day scenes where an adult
Bobby is played by David Morse, that isn't in sync
with the rest of the film. It's too easy a method to
evoke a conventional feeling of "nostalgia," and it
isn't really necessary, since Hicks does a terrific
job of giving the rest of the film a nostalgic feel
without additional exposition.
King's stories rarely pull any trademark manipulative
punches, and Hearts in Atlantis has an unsentimental
streak even as it works to make you cry. It's one of
the year's most purely satisfying films.

    CAPSULE: In 1960 an eleven-year-old forms a friendship with 
    an elderly man who boards at his house.  Scott Hicks directs 
    with a great deal of period feel.  Anthony Hopkins stars as 
    the mysterious Ted Brautigan.  The story is told 
    sentimentally and well until the script or perhaps the story 
    falters in the final reel.  Rating: 7 (0 to 10), low +2 
    (-4 to +4) 
Stephen King made his reputation on writing horror and that still 
seems to be the major portion of his output.  These days, however, 
the films made from his horror stories are definitely of secondary 
quality to those that do not have  strong fantasy content.  King 
is better when he concentrates on human drama than on the 
supernatural.  This film based on only one part of his novel 
HEARTS IN ATLANTIS basically ignores most, though not all, of the 
fantasy elements of the book. 
Robert Garfield (played by David Morse) is a photographer 
returning to the neighborhood where he grew up.  He is visiting 
the funeral of a childhood friend.  He asks about Carol Gerber, 
the girl who was the other close friend, only to discover that she 
had recently passed away.  Robert thinks back to 1960 when he was 
eleven.  Bobby (played just a little too maturely by Anton 
Yelchin) lived with his widowed mother.  Then boarder Ted 
Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins) comes to live with the Garfields.  
Though his mother takes an immediate dislike to him, for Bobby the 
boarder opens up new worlds.  Ted turns Bobby onto the world of 
literature and forever changes Bobby's outlook on the world. 
Bobby and Ted's relationship is made difficult by Bobby's mother 
(Hope Davis), a woman who makes all the wrong decisions in her own 
life and blames the result on others.  She has poisoned Bobby's 
mind against his dead father suspects the worst of Ted.  Bobby's 
mother is right about Ted in at least one regard.  There is 
something not normal about the recluse.  He seems to have psychic 
powers that tell him things about the future.  And Ted is on the 
run from men who know about those powers and want to use them.  
The book's fantasy element is much reduced in the William Goldman 
(MARATHON MAN, THE PRINCESS BRIDE) adaptation of one section of 
the book by Stephen King.  Scott Hicks who directed SHINE and SNOW 
FALLING ON CEDARS directs here.  In general his style is nostalgic 
and romanticized, though he somewhat unimaginatively creates a lot 
of the mood by playing the popular music of the 1960 period.  Also 
though the cars we see seem a bit old for the setting.  Goldman's 
or King's view of the "good kids" is a little too Simon Pure and 
cliched as he follows them down railroad tracks and swimming at 
the local water hole, slaking their thirsts with the carton of 
milk they brought along.  Nobody I remember was that good a kid.  
Once he has lulled us into this idyllic view of 1960 the 
introduction of some nasty violence in the latter part of the film 
comes as something of a shock. 
HEARTS IN ATLANTIS is a Castle Rock Entertainment production.  
They do the best adaptations of Stephen King, including the now 
classic THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.  HEARTS IN ATLANTIS is a cut 
below that film, but still a good production.  I rate it 7 on the 
0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.

PLOT:
A strange old man comes to live in a small town with secrets from the past. He
befriends a young boy whose mom is extremely selfish, and offers him advice on
love, life and girls. But where does this man come from? What's with all the
mystery? Does this movie have any real point? Find out below...
CRITIQUE:
A movie which obviously means well, but doesn't really provide the needed
"oomph" to back up its mysterious build-up. Not the kind of movie that you
should watch when you're sleepy, that's fer sure (unless you wanna fall asleep,
of course). It moves at a slow pace, gives you hints of stuff here and there,
clues behind some of its vagueness but ultimately very little to sustain its
well-established ominous potential. You wait, you wait, you wait...and watch
Anthony Hopkins and Anton Yelchin develop an interesting relationship
throughout, watch as exquisite shots of nostalgia and youth pass before your
eyes, but there's always something telling you that there's gotta be more behind
all of this, a hint of spirituality, a lining of depth, a greater love or
something, but ultimately...well, it just never comes. The ending is too
"ho-hum" and doesn't give you anything more than what it is, which is basically
just a...coming-of-age story? I hoped that this movie would hit me emotionally,
hoped that it would have me wondering aloud, hoped that I might recognize
something in it, which I had never seen in any other movie before, but this film
just didn't provide any of that.
Basically, it was a disappointment. Sure, some of its elements were spot-on.
Hopkins was rock solid as the mystery man, the little boy was perfect and
delivered the goods in both his happy and sad moments, as did Mika Boorem as
Carol, his "girlfriend" in the day. The cinematography and the innocence of the
time were also captured idealistically and damn, if that wasn't one of the
grooviest soundtracks of the year (very Sinatra-esque). But the bottom line with
most films is their story and this one just didn't deliver. It also featured a
very one-dimensional mother character, whom we try to understand, but are given
no reasons to appreciate in any way. We also get an explanation as to Hopkins'
character at some point in the film, but when all is said and done, it doesn't
really seem to be that relevant to the picture as a whole. I mean, whether or
not he is what he is, has little to do with the major drive of the film, so why
build so much into it in the first place? I don't know, I guess what I'm saying
is that I don't think the director did a good job of balancing the different
elements here, and had my focus going one way, when really the film wasn't so
much about that, then it was something else (I'm trying not to spoil anything
here, so bear with my babbling). 
Of course, I'm more than willing to admit that perhaps I didn't "get" the
undertones in this movie, or that there was some kind of "deeper meaning" behind
it all, but the bottom line with the film is that it just didn't bring anything
new to the table, especially when placed against much greater and comparable
films like STAND BY ME (which was also based on a Stephen King story). Then
again, I didn't care for THE GREEN MILE either, and most folks seemed to like
that, so being in the same vein as that flick, you might want to check this one
out just the same, if you enjoyed the latter. Overall, this film provides for
solid acting, a fun soundtrack and wonderful atmosphere, but very little of
resonance or freshness.
And what the heck does HEARTS IN ATLANTIS mean, you might be asking? Well, other
than the fact that it reminds me of that mediocre Disney flick from this summer,
it's apparently something to do with youth and love, but I challenge you to
decipher that one when the film is done. It's a game in itself.

To crudely semi-plagiarize from Entertainment Weekly, who in their right
mind would expect anything but good things from William Goldman's
adaptation of a Stephen King novel directed by Scott Hicks (Shine) and
starring Anthony Hopkins?  Of course, Hollywood has been able to muck up a
seemingly unmuckable roster in the past (Sphere comes immediately to mind)
but please let me tell you now, this is no Sphere.  This is a treasure.
People potentially put off by "adaption of a Stephen King novel" obviously
haven't been reading him lately.  Let me give you some perspective:  did
you like Shawshank Redemption, Stand By Me, The Green Mile, maybe even Apt
Pupil?  This is the King on display here, softened even more by the deft
hand of William Goldman.  Goldman speaks Kingese as well as Frank Darabont
does, and my frequent readers will recognize that as high praise indeed.
He shows without telling in an effortless, non-lingual way, and it's
delightful.  The late Piotr Sobocinski is the cinematographer, and this is
indeed a glorious swansong; everything is beautiful, everyone is carefully
placed in the frame, every visual detail is crisp and perfect, like the
best parts of a favorite memory.
Before the show began, I told my companion that I knew I had read this
book, it was on my shelf, I could picture the cover, but I had zip of an
idea what it was about.  The maddeningly vague ad campaign was no help
either.  As soon as Hopkins' hands curled around his paper shopping bags, I
remembered the whole thing, and I was just so glad to be there.  I
understand why the ads and even the publicity copy is so vague - how do you
describe it?  If you haven't read the book, you would only be attracted by
the pedigree.  When my boyfriend asked what the movie was about when I came
home, streaked in tears, I would only have been able to explain it by
ruining it.  So I said, it's just great.  As I am telling you now:  go
forth, and reward the studio for making this movie.
Many of King's best works (It, Stand By Me, for example) depend on his
brilliant, gleaming adoration of childhood friendships, notably around age
11-14, when the mind is the most open and innocence and curiosity and
everything are just budding but have not ruined the mind.  This film is no
exception.  It's wonderful.  I cried, more than once, as did my very
cynical (as a rule) male companion.  This is one of those films where,
actually, very few happy things happen, yet the feeling walking home is one
of uplifted wonder and melancholy joy.
Anthony Hopkins' eyes can see forever.  There are many unanswered questions
with regards to his Ted Brautigan, but we believe him and believe in him
because of his eyes.  Mychael Danna's music (he also did The Sweet
Hereafter and the Ice Storm) is hauntingly delicate, like the film itself.
Our copy actually broke 80 minutes into the film - we weren't budging,
despite missing 10 minutes and being told we'd have to wait 30 minutes.
The whole room was transfixed - what would happen next?  Lovely.  Anton
Yelchin is young Booby Garfield (David Morse is him grown up - take close
look at all his props, they say so much about his character) and he is
lovely, very open and natural and sweet and real.  Mika Boorem (I
recognized her, belatedly, as the child Ally McBeal, but she has a good
resume) is also dreamlike in her perfection as the best gal pal.

Directed by Scott Hicks. Screenplay by William Goldman, based on the novel
by Stephen King. Starring Anthony Hopkins, Anton Yelchin, Mika Boorem.
Running time: 100 minutes. Rated PG by the MFCB. Reviewed on September 
24th, 2001.
Synopsis: Bobby Garfield (Yelchin) lives in a small town with his 
mirthless widowed mother (Hope Davis). Bobby's world revolves around his 
friends, especially the spritely Carol (Boorem). Then one day, a new 
boarder arrives at Bobby's house. Ted Brautigan (Hopkins) is an enigmatic 
man to whom Bobby takes an immediate liking. As the bond between Bobby and 
Ted deepens, Bobby becomes privy to Ted's great secret, an event which 
will change both of their lives forever.
Review: A small but enchanting movie, "Hearts In Atlantis" easily recalls 
another King-inspired coming-of-age film, "Stand By Me", both in terms of 
its setting and the sentiment it conveys. "Hearts" is a tribute to the 
magic of childhood, to those summers when the days seem neverending, and 
nothing means more than your closest friends. Unlike "Stand By Me", there 
is a supernatural element to "Hearts", but although it is key to the plot, 
it is not prominent. Like "Stand By Me", this is a mostly character-driven 
film, and as such it benefits greatly from superb casting. Yelchin is very 
good as Bobby, finding a good mix of innocence and resignation. More 
splendid still is Boorem, whom I praised highly for her work in "Along 
Came A Spider" and who is simply radiant here as Carol. And then there is 
Hopkins, who despite playing such a quiet, introspective character as Ted, 
nonetheless commands our attention every time he is onscreen. Less 
successful is Davis, whose strident Elizabeth comes across as overly 
cartoonish. I also found it odd that Bobby and Carol's other friend, Sully 
(whose death as an adult sets up the movie's flashback framing device), is 
paid virtually no attention. But Hicks' direction is lovely without being 
cloying, and despite the movie's general lack of incident, it never ceases 
to weave its spell over the audience.

Look at the credits for "Hearts in Atlantis." A nostalgic drama starring
Anthony Hopkins, with a screenplay by William Goldman ("Butch Cassidy
and the Sundance Kid") based on a novel by Stephen King and directed by
Scott Hicks, the man who brought us "Shine." How can you go wrong with a
roster like that?
I should make it clear up front that there are elements of "Hearts in
Atlantis" that work very well. The locations are skillfully chosen 
this is a movie with a wonderfully specific sense of place. The
cinematography by the late Piotr Sobocinski is simply gorgeous. Anthony
Hopkins gives a sad, wistful, understated performance and establishes a
fine rapport with young actor Anton Yelchin. There are several memorable
scenes, particularly a Three-Card Monty segment and a first kiss on a
Ferris Wheel.
But the film doesn't work. After leaving the press screening with only a
vague notion that something about the production was wrong, I made a
point to see the movie again at a sneak preview over the weekend, hoping
to pin down the exact source of my discontent. Basically, it boils down
to this: "Hearts in Atlantis" purports to show the incalculable impact a
mentor can have on a child, but offers a contradictory message through
its depiction of the adult version of that child.
As in the far superior "Stand By Me," the film opens with a man dealing
with the death of a childhood friend. Photographer Bobby Garfield (David
Morse) returns to a small Connecticut town for the funeral of his best
pal, Sully, only to learn that Carol, his first love, has also passed
away.
A side note: In the book on which the film is based, Carol did not die.
Reportedly, director Hicks was jarred by the final scene in "Billy
Elliot," which abruptly switched to an adult version of the young star
of the movie. Rather than risk upsetting viewers by presenting an adult
version of Carol, Hicks opted to kill her instead. Thanks, Scott.
In "Stand By Me," the adult revisits his childhood through his writing,
and in the closing scenes, shows that he grew from the experiences. In
"Hearts in Atlantis," the adult Bobby remembers his childhood while
standing in the ruins of his old home, looking morose (and nobody is
better at looking morose than David Morse). When the flashback ends and
the camera returns to him, Bobby simply continues looking morose. If he
gained anything from his mentor, or Carol, or anybody, there is no
evidence of it onscreen. Where "Stand By Me" overflows with life and
growth, "Hearts in Atlantis" traffics in death and stagnancy.
Back in 1962 (cue the overplayed oldies), 11-year-old Bobby (Yelchin)
lives with his widowed mother Elizabeth (Hope Davis, giving a needlessly
shrill performance). The boy often slips away to play with his closest
friends, Sully (Will Rothhaar) and Carol (Mika Boorem), while dodging a
local bully. Almost every day, Bobby gazes through the toy store window
at the bicycle of his dreams. Unfortunately, Mom can't afford to buy him
the bike, although she somehow manages to keep a fresh supply of new
dresses.
Life becomes more interesting when Mom takes in a boarder, an elderly
gent named Ted Brautigan (Hopkins). Elizabeth views Ted with suspicion,
but welcomes his money, while Bobby finds the old man fascinating. It
seems that Ted is possessed of a gift and must hide from the "low men"
that would spirit him away because of his gift. He hires Bobby  for a
dollar a week!  to read to him and keep an eye out for his pursuers.
Ted becomes a mentor to Bobby: a reassuring presence and occasional
protector to the boy and his friends. It is here where "Hearts in
Atlantis" lives up to its promise. Although a few scenes fall flat,
particularly a face-off between Ted and the bully, the film captures the
elusive magic that nostalgic pieces shoot for, with just the right
balance of bitter and sweet. Hopkins interacts warmly with the kids, and
young Anton Yelchin and Mika Boorem are delightful together. All too
soon, though, the story gives way to melodrama without resonance,
leading to the return of David Morse for the dour wrap-up.
Because of the acting, cinematography and charming middle section, I'm
glad I saw "Hearts in Atlantis." Still, it is amazing that a group of
talents like this was only able to come up with one third of a great
movie.

"Hearts in Atlantis," set in a sleepy neighborhood in
the carefree era of the early 60s, follows in the vein
of other Stephen King tales about nostalgia and
innocence lost (most notably "Stand by Me" and "The
Green Mile").  It is a purposefully paced story that
focuses on the uneasy transition from boyhood to
adulthood.  It reminds us of the gentle awakenings to
the often-sinuous world that lie waiting for us when
we finally grow up.  It sympathizes the inevitable
fact that growing up frequently leaves us more
disillusioned and less hopeful.
Adults and children view the world in very different
ways.  For the grown-up, what they see is panoramic in
scope.  They see much of what is good like the
innocence of children, the beauty of books, and
rejoice in the ever-lasting effect of that first kiss
by which all others will be judged.  
However, with the wisdom that they have acquired over
a lifetime of experiences, they also see what is bad. 
They recognize the presence of things that are
ominous.  Such is the case of the mysterious Ted
Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins), a transient fellow who
shows up one day at the home of young 11-year old
Bobby (Anton Yelchin).  He has come to rent out the
extra room upstairs.
His mom (Hope Davis) is unsettled by his appearance. 
"I never trust a man who carries his possessions in
grocery bags," she says.  But that doesn't matter to
Bobby.  For children, what they see is more selective.
 It's as if they are looking into a mirror, gazing
upon a reflection, and seeing only what they want to
see.  
Currently, Bobby's world centers on his best friends,
Sully (Will Rothhaar) and Carol (Mika Boorem), and a
lazy summer that never seems to end.  It consists of
reading books on a giant tree branch that rests over a
babbling brook, the hope that a new bicycle awaits
him, and a glorious night at the local fair.
This is the last summer of Bobby's childhood. 
Partially, it's because he's 11 going on 12. 
Partially, it's due to his emerging friendship with
Ted.  Bobby's Dad died seven years ago, and his mom is
too distracted with her job to invest the kind of love
that every 11-year old needs.  Meanwhile, Ted offers
cold root beer, will pay Bobby a dollar a week to read
him the newspaper, and asks him to keep an eye out for
"Low Men" who wear dark hats and drive
official-looking cars.  They are the bullies in his
life.
Bobby begins to slowly learn that it's time to stop
gazing into the mirror and to try to struggle with the
world's realities, even if it is more than any 11-year
old can hope to imagine.  Sully is more than just his
friend.  Carol is more than just the pretty girl next
door.  Mom does love him.  And the world is bigger
than the block on which you live, meaner than the
local bully, and more complex than your feelings after
your first kiss.  Alas, the mysteries of adolescence
may never be understood.  And, as Ted so eloquently
yet sadly remarks, "there are some moments of
happiness that you live in some place magical that
Atlantis must have been.  Then we grow up and our
hearts break into two."

The entire time I spent watching the latest Stephen King big-screen
adaptation Hearts in Atlantis, I had this nagging feeling in the back of
my mind that something was missing.  All the key elements of a
potentially great film were present -- authentic-looking 1960s Americana
scenery, great acting by Anthony Hopkins and newcomer Anton Yelchin
(Delivering Milo), an intriguing story line, and strong directing by
Scott Hicks.  And then, at the end of the film, it just hit me like a
sap across the back of the neck. 
One common recurring narrative in many of King's better-known
novel-to-screen adaptations -- such as Stand by Me, The Green Mile, and
The Shawshank Redemption -- incorporates an older gentleman recalling
his youth or a life-changing incident of his life. Hearts in Atlantis
follows this to a tee.  After learning of a childhood friend's death, a
middle-aged photographer Robert Garfield (David Morse) ventures back to
his hometown for the funeral.  Upon arrival, Robert recalls memories of
youth and of one innocent, fateful summer when a mysterious man named
Ted Brautigan (Hopkins) entered his life and changed it forever.
At the beginning of summer, old Teddy rents the studio apartment on the
upper floor of his childhood home.  During his stay, Teddy displays the
usual, weird behavioral traits of all King characters.  He's a strange
gent who carries his belongings around in brown paper bags; says the
kookiest things about young love, life as a kid, and the pains of
growing old; appears as a mythical figure in times of crisis; and
carries the weight of the world on his shoulders.  Lonely little boy
Bobby Garfield (Yelchin) takes a liking to Teddy because his mother
(Hope Davis) is a workaholic who spends more money on dresses than
birthday presents and his father is dead.  During the summer, Bobby
falls in love and shares his first kiss with the neighborhood girl,
Carol Gerber (Mika Boorem), endures the trials of defending his honor
from the neighborhood bullies, pines for a bicycle in the local
convenience store, and discovers Teddy's mysterious gift of seeing
beyond the world.  Bobby is then entrusted with informing and somehow
protecting Teddy from the Low Men, dangerous ruthless faceless
characters who drive fancy cars and cast long shadows, who are hunting
for Teddy because of his unique "gift."
All of these circumstances would have made the film a success except for
one damning thing.  Everything -- from the unrequited love of two
childhood sweethearts to the emotional abuse of a lonely boy -- feels so
recognizable and indistinguishable from all of the previous works that
deal with these similar themes.  I kept catching myself remembering
parts from Stand By Me and even The Goonies.  It's a shame, because the
film looks great from a technical standpoint and both Hopkins and
Yelchin pull off great performances.  In the end, though, the film feels
cheap and used up -- like watching a two-hour Hallmark special.  You
feel guilty for even liking the good parts.
Even the message of Hearts in Atlantis becomes lost in the emotional
manipulation by both the characters and story.  Instead of giving the
audience the ability to develop its own emotional ties to the film's
narrative and personalities, the script dictates pre-defined moments of
trepidation, intrigue, anguish, sadness, loneliness, and frustration by
the obvious flow of the characters' dialogue and the film's plot
points.  One key example is when Hopkins details the story of a
once-great football player winning one last game for the home team.  So
much deliberation is given to this scenario that we all but expect the
main character of the story to have to overcome a challenging obstacle
in his own life.  It's a desperate manipulation, and it has a totally
opposite effect: In the end, you can care less what happens to Teddy or
his little friend.

Bobby Garfield (Anton Yelchin, "Along Came a Spider") lives in a Connecticut
mill town with his widowed, bitter, self-involved mother (Hope Davis, "Next
Stop, Wonderland").  It's 1960, still an innocent time, and Bobby finds 
support from his two best buddies Sully (Will Rothhaar) and Carol Gerber 
(Mika Boorem).  When a strange older man, Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins) 
moves in upstairs, Elizabeth Garfield's wary, but Bobby's found a father 
figure in the Stephen King adaptation "Hearts in Atlantis."
Screenwriter William Goldman ("The Princess Bride") has solved what makes
so many of King's more recent writings problematic by stripping out the silly 
supernatural aspects of his novella and focusing on the human drama.
While there are a couple of small, forgivable bumps in the adaptation (which 
may be attributable to editing and only slightly affect story clarity), 
director Scott Hicks ("Shine," "Snow Falling on Cedars") has turned in a film 
in the tradition of King adaptations "Stand By Me" and "The Shawshank 
Redemption."
Bobby-o, as his mother calls him, is disappointed when his eleventh birthday
gift isn't the Schwinn bike he's had his eye on, but a library card.  Yeah,
it's an adult library card, but he knows it was the fact that it was free
that caused his mother to choose it.  Buddy Carol's quick to point out that
Bobby's mom always has new clothes, but he defends her, noting her job in
an office requires her to look nice.
When Ted offers Bobby a job reading him the newspaper for $1 a week, Bobby's
thrilled - he can save for his bike.  Mom reluctantly agrees, as long as 
they remain on the porch.  But what Ted really needs is for Bobby to keep an 
eye out for 'the low men' in their flashy cars, men out to exploit Ted for
a mysterious power he has.  While Ted enriches Bobby's life with literature 
and friendship, Bobby's exposed to violence and treachery, becoming a young 
adult in the process.
Scott Hicks brings us his third period tale of a tortured adult reflecting 
on the lost innocence of his youth.  This is a beautiful production, with
Virginia perfectly standing in for an old New England town (production
design by Barbara Ling, Art Direction by Mark Worthington, Set Decoration
by Leslie E. Rollins).  Kids eat dinner on TV trays in front of black and
white televisions playing "The Lone Ranger" and Providence pool halls are
cool and shadowy.  The sound mix by Tod A. Maitland adds to the nostalgic
feel with a background composed of barking dogs, wind chimes and cicadas.
Cinematographer Piotr Sobocinski ("Red") composes with a golden, backlit glow
in his last screen credit (the film is dedicated to him).
Hopkins never once recalls Hannibal Lecter in his sensitive portrayal
of a man on the run willing to make time for a young boy.  His accent is 
too refined for a man who moves in with all his belongings in a paper bag,
but that's a small quibble.  Hope Davis gives her best performance to
date as a self-centered woman who gets more than she deserves before her
eyes are opened to her own selfishness.  Yelchin and Boorem are great
as the kids (we've had a wealth of child actors of late).  Celia Weston
("Snow Falling on Cedars") adds as a bartender who helps Bobby connect 
with his late father and Alan Tudyk ("A Knight's Tale") plays a pivotal 
three-card monte pitchman with just the right amount of hucksterism and 
growing frustration.  Adam Lefevre ("You Can Count on Me") personifies
the piggish machismo of Liz' Garfield's boss, Donald Biderman.  David Morse 
("Dancer in the Dark") plays the adult Bobby in the films' bookending scenes.
"Hearts in Atlantis" is a moving nostalgia piece where an underlying
darkness encroaches on a small town summertime childhood.

Susan Granger's review of "HEARTS IN ATLANTIS" (Castle Rock/Warner Bros.)
  Timing is everything, and the timing just seems right for this
poignant psychological drama that combines the coming-of-age nostalgia of "Stand
By Me" with the mystical power of "The Green Mile." Based on Stephen King
stories adapted by screenwriter William Goldman and directed by Scott Hicks,
it's set in 1960 in Harwich, Connecticut, where fatherless 11 year-old Bobby
Garfield (Anton Yelchin) lives in a boarding house with his resentful,
self-centered mother (Hope Davis).  He's devoted to his neighborhood friends
(Mika Boorem, Will Rothhaar) but his pivotal relationship is with a strange, new
tenant, Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins) who opens the world of literature to him
after his selfish mother refuses to buy him a birthday gift and hands him,
instead, a library card.  Knowing he's longing for a Schwinn bike, Ted offers to
pay him $1 a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for
signs of the malevolent, ominous Low Men who are chasing him to exploit his
special powers. The story structure consists of one long flashback, framed by
the present, featuring the adult Bobby (David Morse), minimizing the
supernatural elements while emphasizing the human drama  Hopkins' mysterious
character is genteel, sensitive and benignly seductive. The only explanation is
that he's a psychic who is wanted by the FBI to aid in their hunt for Communists
and even that seems appropriate, given the inexplicable state of the world right
now. The production values and performances are solid, particularly Hopkins -
arguably the finest, most versatile actor of our era - and the children with
whom he forges a firm bond. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Hearts in
Atlantis" is a wistful, enigmatic 8, evolving with subtle power to an
emotionally effective catharsis.
