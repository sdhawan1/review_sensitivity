          Capsule review:  Six women go through folly, friendship,
     and tragedy together.  If the basic formula is familiar, at
     least the writing by Robert Harling--based on his own stage
     play--is usually crisp and often genuinely funny.  Rating:
     low +2.
     STEEL MAGNOLIAS is about as formulaic a "women's film" as any film I
can imagine.  You have a set of two or more women whom you get to know very
well through relatively mundane circumstances.  You get a feel for what they
do in life's more ordinary moments.  The tragedy (usually medical) strikes
and having known them already you feel for their tragedy.  Suddenly any old
antagonisms seem small.  But they are stronger for having known each other
and the remainder of their numbers will abide and endure.  That's BEACHES,
that's TERMS OF ENDEARMENT, that's lots of other films, and that's STEEL
MAGNOLIAS.  All that makes one of these films good or bad is whether the
viewer is really brought into the characters during the normal, mundane part
and is that part enjoyable.  In STEEL MAGNOLIAS the mundane part is quite
good.  As it so often is, it's not silly or cute or whimsical.  It is
genuinely funny.  And as such it leaves most of the other films of its
formula behind.
     STEEL MAGNOLIAS is the story of six women from a small town in
Louisiana.  The women are played by Sally Field, Shirley MacLaine, Dolly
Parton, Daryl Hannah, Olympia Dukakis, and Julia Roberts.  Much of the story
takes place in a beauty parlor--as did all of the play the film was based
on.  But the film greatly benefits from the opportunity to get out of the
beauty parlor and see the world. There are really three pairs of women: a
mother and daughter, the beauty parlor owner and her assistant, and two
older women who are often at odds with each other.
     As is almost the requirement for this sort of film, there is a soft and
sentimental film score by George Delerue.  Nobody plays these soft and
sensitive strings like Delerue.  Also reasonably good, but obviously of
secondary interest, are the men, played by Tom Skerritt, Sam Shepard, and a
few others.  Also this film boasts (?) a view of the most revolting cake
ever baked.
     STEEL MAGNOLIAS obviously has a good cast and is diverting and
enjoyable.  I rate it a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.

        STEEL MAGNOLIAS must have been a casting director's wet dream!  Try
this on for size: Sally Fields, Shirley MacLaine, Olympia Dukakis, Daryl
Hannah, Dolly Parton, and Julia Roberts all together in one movie.
Collectively, these actresses have so much charisma that STEEL MAGNOLIAS
manages to escape without serious injury from a potentially fatal case of
tear-jerking.
        The movie clicks thanks to the warm camaraderie between the cast
members.  The story revolves around Roberts as a diabetic who decides to
risk her life by getting pregnant.  Fields is Roberts' over-protective
mother in a flashy role which requires the actress to pour on the pathos.
MacLaine is a riot as a cranky eccentric who claims to have been in a bad
mood for 40 years.  Dukakis is the fun-loving widow who enjoys exchanging
insults with MacLaine.  They all hang out and gossip at Dolly Parton's
beauty salon.
        The actresses are working with an exceptionally clever script,
which contains some of the year's funniest one-liners.  In fact, Gene
Siskel has dismissed the film as "Southern Belles doing stand-up."  But
when you're rolling in the aisles, who cares if the dialogue is
unrealistic?  Robert Harling's script revels in the absurd idiosyncrasies
of life in a small town.
        STEEL MAGNOLIAS is a movie of minor miracles, not the least of
which is a shockingly good performance by Daryl Hannah, who is usually my
least favorite actress on the planet.  Hannah plays the new girl in town,
and her schizophrenic character starts out as a timid nerd with funny
glasses and evolves into a kooky, born-again, religious fanatic with funny
glasses.  Maybe Hollywood executives will now finally realize that they've
been miscasting Hannah all these years.  Forget the glamor roles; give this
babe the weirdo parts!
        Regrettably, Hannah and her "sisters" are merely caricatures.  You
don't know them intimately, and consequently, the dramatic moments just
don't ring true.  The tear-jerking gets completely out of hand during the
climactic funeral scene: the emotions seem forced as Fields alternates
between gushing tears and hysterical laughter.  Fortunately, the movie's
comic undercurrent resurfaces just in time to rescue us from the jaws of
melodrama.

     This is a *very* frustrating movie to watch.  You have some wonderful
performances (Sally Field and Julia Roberts), and others that are just so
overdone (Shirley MacLaine, Olympia Dukakis, Tom Skerrit) that they almost seem
to be part of another movie.  You have characters that make mysterious
transformations during the course of the movie, like Darryl Hannah and Sam
Shepard.  You have some clumsy sound editing which left half the audience
wondering why the other half was laughing.
     I basically liked the movie.  I laughed more at this movie more than at
any movie since EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY.  Even though I knew how weepy parts of
the movie would be, I still found myself crying.  There's a moment after her
daughter's funeral when Sally Field suddenly starts reacting with such fury
over the death that she reminded me of her performance in SYBIL.
     Maybe *that's* the problem.  I never got so involved in the movie that I
forgot I was watching a movie.  In films like CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS, ALWAYS,
and SAY ANYTHING, I literally forgot I was watching a film at times.  But,
here, Dolly Parton is playing the same good old girl we've seen her play in
many other movies.  Ann Wedgeworth is playing another Southern eccentric.
     The movie takes occasional risks.  Shirley MacLaine has never looked
worse, but it suits her character perfectly.  The relationship between Sally
Field and Julia Roberts is *very* complicated, but it's also pretty believable.
     I think I'd rate the movie about a 7 on the Chuck scale, because though
it's a flawed movie, I found it compelling just the same.  It's so rare to see
the friendships of a number of woman portrayed in a film.  Someone complained
somewhere about the lack of a strong male character anywhere in the picture.
All I can say is: ABOUT TIME!
