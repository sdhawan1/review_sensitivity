Curdled (R) ** (out of ****)
2 days in the Valley (R) ** (out of ****)
        Those looking for evidence that Quentin Tarantino is the most
influential filmmaker of the moment need look no further than not one, but
two recent releases, the macabre comedy Curdled and the ensemble
comedy-thriller 2 days in the Valley.  Pairing black humor with bloody
violence, both attempt to duplicate, to paraphrase the Coens' Barton Fink,
"that Tarantino feeling"... and come up short.
        Tarantino himself executive produced Reb Braddock's Curdled, based
on Braddock's short of the same name.  The film centers on Gabriela (Angela
Jones), a Miami woman who has a had a fixation on death since she was a
little girl in her native Colombia--she even keeps a scrapbook of newspaper
articles about murders, drawing depictions of the crimes next to each
article.  When she sees a TV ad recruiting people for a company that cleans
up after murder scenes, she knows she's found her calling and immediately
signs up.  Of course, her new job puts her into contact with danger, namely
one Paul Guell (William Baldwin), a.k.a. the Blue Blood Killer, who stabs
and beheads women from Miami's upper social echelon.  It also just so
happens that Paul's murder spree is Gabriela's latest morbid obsession.
        The plot is enough to sustain 28 minutes, which is how long the
original Curdled short lasted.  Stretched out to a little over 90, the
thinness of the premise is all too evident; a number of scenes and
characters feel like padding, and the movie doesn't kick into full gear
until the last act, when Gabriela and Paul finally meet.  And for a black
comedy, writers Braddock and John Maass are a little too heavy on the
"black" and too light on the "comedy."  While the entire package is amusing
and never boring (look out for the connections to From Dusk till Dawn), real
laughs are few and far-between; however, the film never skimps in terms of
blood, the letting and collection of it.  The wallowing in gore is more
sensational and exploitative than anything else, and it is bound to turn off
many a moviegoer.  I suppose Braddock was trying to get under people's skin,
but the subtler moments, like Gabriela's haunting
retrace-the-steps-of-the-murder-victim dance, are more disturbing and funny
than, say, the gruesome finale, which comes equipped with a joke that's more
cheesy than hilarious.
        The performances are a mixed bag.  Jones and her fascinating
character of Gabriela (of which she played a variation in Tarantino's Pulp
Fiction) are by far the best thing the film has going for it.  Gabriela is
an interesting paradox--a woman who  always wears dresses and speaks in
soft, accented, little girl tones but on the inside is far from an innocent.
Baldwin, on the other hand, picks up where he left off in the awful Fair
Game, relying on a single facial expression to convey certain
characteristics.  In Fair Game, Baldwin made his eyes bulge and gritted his
teeth to convey toughness; here, he constantly makes his upper lip curl to
signify evil.  Mel Gorham is quite good as Gabriela's all-business cleaning
partner, and MTV personality Daisy Fuentes makes her acting debut as another
co-worker, but her role is so minute that it's still not clear whether she
can really act or not.
        Strong performances are about all there is to second-time
writer-director John Herzfeld's 2 days in the Valley, an interesting but
none-too-funny ensemble piece.  Herzfeld's knotty scenario has a murder in
California's San Fernando Valley link ten diverse characters: an Olympic
skier (Teri Hatcher); a no-nonsense hitman (James Spader); his icy Swedish
girlfriend (Charlize Theron); a past-his-prime hitman (Danny Aiello) deathly
afraid of dogs; an effete British art dealer (Greg Cruttwell); his put-upon
assistant (Glenne Headly); his nurse half-sister (Marsha Mason); a has-been
TV director (Paul Mazursky); and two vice cops (Eric Stoltz and Jeff Daniels).
        Actually, I should say _nine_ characters, for Daniels's racist cop
disappears midway through the action and thus has really nothing to do with
anything.  Aside from his anomalous presence, Herzfeld does find interesting
and creative ways to link these characters.  But structure isn't everything
to a picture, especially not a comedy, and 2 days's slapstick farce is more
labored and silly than funny despite some high points (the vicious brawl
between Hatcher and Theron being the highest).  With his wide assortment of
oddball characters and flashes of violence, Herzfeld was obviously shooting
for a mix of Tarantino and Robert Altman--Pulp Fiction meets Short Cuts, to
use the popular comparison.  The film does come off as a Tarantino/Altman
hybrid, but it's more like Four Rooms meets Pret-a-Porter.
        So just what does the mediocrity of the Tarantino-inspired Curdled
and 2 days mean?  Quentin, get thee back behind the camera--quick.

Running time: 94 minutes
CURDLED is a deliciously dark and witty black comedy, but its
humour won't appeal to everyone.  To be specific, let me give
you an example.  Do you know in PULP FICTION where Jules and
Vincent go on brain detail after Marvin and his head accidentally
get separated?  If you thought that was completely tasteless and
unfunny, don't see CURDLED.
On the other hand, if you found that sequence to be pretty funny,
you have the sense of humour that CURDLED is aimed at.
Our film's heroine, Gabriela, played by Angela Jones, is a woman
obssessively curious about murder and serial killers; she even
keeps a scrapbook of news articles.  Luckily for her, Miami is
being plagued by a serial killer rampage - her scrapbook is getting
pretty big.
The killer's nickname in the press is The Blue Blood Killer, because
he preys on older rich socialite women, and he's played by William
Baldwin (this is not a spoiler).  One particularly striking M.O. on
the Blue Blood Killer is his propensity to decapitate his victims.
Gabriela is watching television one day when she spots an
advertisement for a firm whose line of work is perfectly attuned
to her interests.  She immediately quits her job, and signs on
with PFCS, which stands for Post-Forensic Cleaning Service.  No
points for guessing what they do.
Her workmates are confused by Gabriela's fascination with murder;
to them, it's just a day job.  There's a hilarious locker room
scene where they debate whether decapitated heads can talk, and
what they would say.  Gabriela's partner, Elena, played by Mel
Gorham, is particularly perturbed by Gabriela's wide-eyed fascination,
and becomes really upset when Gabriela volunteers them to clean up
The Blue Blood Killer's latest scene - they're the messiest, you see.
Unbeknownst to them, the last victim left something on the scene which
would ID The Blue Blood Killer, so he's also heading over there..
The comparison to PULP FICTION earlier on was not accidental -
Quentin Tarantino executive-produced this film, which began life
as a short film he saw at a film festival.  Apparently Tarantino
was so impressed that he helped Braddock convert this into a
feature-length film.
There are other parallels - the star of CURDLED is Angela Jones
(the top billing goes to William Baldwin, but really, Jones is
the central character), who's probably best known for her role as
Esmerelda Villalobos, the death-obssessed taxi driver in PULP FICTION.
That role was written specifically for Jones based upon her similar
character in the aforementioned short film, CURDLED JR.
Jones is great in CURDLED - she's wonderfully funny and maintains
an amusing wide-eyed naive curiousity about murder without compromising
her character's innocence or likeability.  She can express so much
with one lift of her eyebrow.  It's a great performance.
Reb Braddock's direction is extremely sharp and clever, toeing the
line between black humour and bad taste.  The best scene in the
film is an outrageously funny sequence involves Jones and dancing
- any more than that would be a spoiler.  The opening credit sequence
is also inventive and amusing.  Of course, it's impossible to really
take this stuff seriously, but then again you're not really supposed
to - Braddock knows the audience is in on the joke, and makes it a
fun little romp as a result.
The one drawback of CURDLED is that it was based on a short film, and
it feels like it; the material is just stretched too thin in order to
fulfill a feature length running time, and some parts just seem to drag.
While its running time is already a short 94 minutes, it could really
stand to lose twenty minutes or so to give it better pacing.
CURDLED seems destined to be a nice cult film for Miramax.  It'll be
interesting to see if it will appeal to mainstream audiences as well.

     Accompanying the press materials for CURDLED were a few newspaper and
magazine articles about actual services which clean up violent crime
scenes, services like the one which is a key part of the film's premise.
If you want a sure sign of an insecure rookie film-maker, that would be
it.  I suppose the idea is to impress upon us the real-world foundation of
the story, but I simply don't care; an adept film-maker can sell me his
premise over the course of his film.  What the articles really tell me is
that director and co-writer Reb Braddock found the concept for CURDLED in
real life, and what the rest of the film tells me is that he didn't quite
know what to do with it.
     CURDLED is the story of Gabriela (Angela Jones), a Colombian
immigrant living in Miami who is singularly fascinated by violent crimes.
The scrapbook full of newspaper articles she collects about murders is not
enough to satisfy her curiosity, particularly concerning a serial killer
known as the Blue Blood Murderer.  Then Gabriela discovers her dream job
-- a company called Post Mortem Cleaning Services which tidies up after
blood has been spilled.  Gabriela loves her new job -- a bit too much for
the liking of her co-worker Elena (Mel Gorham) -- and when one of the Blue
Blood murder scenes comes up for assignment she leaps at the chance.  What
she doesn't know is that the victim left evidence identifying the killer
as bartender Paul Guell (William Baldwin), and that he is coming back to
do some cleaning up of his own.
     For a while, CURDLED is perversely interesting simply because
Gabriela is such a unique character.  Angela Jones plays her almost as an
innocent, like a child for whom death is still a question to be answered
rather than something to be feared.  She understands enough to know that
other people will not consider her obsession normal, but her enthusiasm
makes it difficult for her to contain herself, making for some
uncomfortable moments with a potential romantic interest (Bruce Ramsay)
and with her co-workers.  The black humor in the script by Braddock and
John Maass comes from watching Jones' off-beat performance as a woman who
shows a wide-eyed glee at being right where dark deeds were done.
     At least that is true at the beginning, when CURDLED appears to be a
black comedy.  At various points, it also tries to be a fairly
conventional suspense thriller (with Baldwin hiding to avoid being found
by Gabriela), a satire of media coverage of serial killings (including a
faux tabloid-style TV program which makes reference to executive producer
Quentin Tarantino's character in FROM DUSK TILL DAWN) and an intense
psychodrama.  The latter plays itself out in a confrontation between
Gabriela and Paul in which he forces her to describe in detail the death
of his last victim, and at that point it appears that Braddock is headed
towards teaching Gabriela a lesson:  the crimes she approaches with such
abstract interest involve the real, painful deaths of real people.
However, even that bit of character development is subverted for a cheap,
easy gag.  CURDLED seems to bounce from realism to surrealism with a
capricious indifference.
     Ultimately, this confusion points to a director who does not seem to
be in control of his material or his characters.  There is a lot going on
at various points in CURDLED, but none of it leads anywhere:  the central
character doesn't grow, there is no real sub-text about human nature, and
there is not even a consistent tone to allow it to work as a cathartic
genre picture.  It is evident that Braddock grabbed on to a basic
situation with potential, and that he was able to create an intriguing
central character to place in that situation, but that he just didn't know
where to go from there.  CURDLED sports a few neat stylistic flourishes,
including an eye-catching opening title sequence and a great scene where
Gabriela does a sensuous dance around a murder scene, but for the most
part it is just one big, long, sick joke with a punch line that is not
particularly worth the effort.  Someone should have thought about telling
a story, instead of just mailing one.
