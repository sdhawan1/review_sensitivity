_The_Big_Tease_ (R) *** (out of ****)
        Watching the opening moments of _The_Big_Tease_, my heart immediately
sank.  Here was another comedy using the much-exhausted mock documentary
format (last used, to ill effect, in _Drop_Dead_Gorgeous_) only to
frequently break its rules--as in, how the heck did they get all these
angles with one camera?  Furthermore, director Kevin Allen was not
executing the premise--Scottish hairdresser Crawford Mackenzie (Craig
Ferguson, who also co-wrote) comes to Los Angeles for the premier
hairdressing competition, "the Platinum Scissors"--beyond the obvious:
broad, cutesy, and obvious fish-out-of-water gags.
        Then a strange thing happened from the 25-minute mark: I began to be
charmed by this film.  The key to the big turn is that Allen, Ferguson,
and his writing collaborator Sacha Gervasi stop trying so hard to be
outrageously funny and trust the absurdity of the story to speak for
itself--resulting in some golden comic moments, such as one where
Crawford wins over a snooty publicist to the stars (Frances Fisher) by
identifying her entire hair care regimen with a simple glance. 
_The_Big_Tease_ is far from original--it fits squarely in the
_Full_Monty_ tradition of feel-good comedy from the British Isles--but it
gets the predictable job done.

A film review by Aileo Weinmann  Copyright Ó 2000 filmcritic.com
Director:    Kevin Allen
Producer:    Kevin Allen, Philip Rose, Sacha Gervasi, Craig Ferguson
Screenwriter:   Sacha Gervasi, Craig Ferguson
Stars:     Craig Ferguson, Frances Fisher, Mary McCormack, David
Rasche, Chris Langham
MPAA Rating:    R
Year of Release:   1999
Cut, Curl, Crimp, Color.  THE BIG TEASE is a mockumentary tracing
flamboyant gay hairdresser Crawford Mackenzie's (Craig Ferguson  THE
DREW CAREY SHOW) unlikely journey from Scotland to Los Angeles in his
quest to win the World International Hairdressing Federation's (WIHF)
Platinum Scissors Competition.  The adventurous bumbling begins when
MacKenzie mistakes a form letter  asking him to be part of the audience
 for an invitation to compete against three of the world's top
stylists, including his idol and the reigning Platinum Scissors holder
Stig Ludwiggssen (David Rasche).
Accompanied by filmmaker Martin (Chris Langham  BBC's KISS ME KATE),
Mackenzie travels to LA, where he plans to finally claim the artistic
recognition and fame that his small Scotland hometown can't offer.
(Except for that time he got to dry Sean Connery's toupee after it fell
into some water on a golf course).  Upon arriving in California, he
kicks up his kilt and happily takes advantage of what he assumes are
complimentary hotel amenities, only to wake up to the reality of a maxed
out credit card.  His passport now held collateral on his outstanding
charges, he proceeds to WIHF headquarters, expecting to clear up the
confusion and get reimbursed.  Unfortunately, WIHF President Monique
(Mary McCormack) is not about to pick up the tab for Mackenzie's
misunderstanding, nor does she plan to allow him to enter the
competition.  Undaunted, the remainder of the comedy unfolds in his
search of any and every way to gain entry in the prestigious contest.
Antics include befriending celebrity promoter Candy Harper (Frances
Fisher), calling on Sean Connery (to return a favor), and visiting a
testosterone-oozing Senator whose company sponsors the WIHF event.
Ferguson plays the eccentric hairdresser with finesse  he's silly and
endearing in his portrayal of destiny to attain the coveted Platinum
Scissors.  Chris Langham does a fine job with his feeble character,
providing a constant if not invisible sidekick for Mackenzie.  Frances
Fisher is great in her role as Mackenzie's compassionate and determined
advocate, demonstrating her versatility, in contrast with more serious
roles in films like TITANIC, UNFORGIVEN, and TRUE CRIME.  Cameo
performances by Drew Carey, David Hasselhoff, Cathy Lee Crosby, and John
Paul DeJoria (a.k.a. John Paul Mitchell, stylist extraordinaire) are
sprinkled to provide that true Hollywood feel.
Overall, THE BIG TEASE holds no real surprises, but the culminating
scene is outrageously over-the-top and doesn't disappoint.  Although the
mockumentary format was strained and became somewhat annoying at times,
it's not enough to kill the general cuteness and entertainment of the
production.  Zany characters, bigtime costumes and an originally absurd
premise (a world championship of hairstyling ?!?) offer as many smiles
as I remember from spinning around in the chair at the barber shop.

Breathing off the limited oxygen that Scottish and homosexual jokes can 
provide, The Big Tease makes the absolute most of its 86 minute 
life-span before its tank runs dry. Had the film not prudently cut off, 
and instead joined the infamous ranks of many current movies, I would 
not be able to declare it the funniest film of the century to date (take 
a second, think about it), a title of which it is well deserving.
Crawford Mackenzie (Craig Ferguson) is the finest and most respected 
hairdresser in Glasgow, Scotland. When a much-deserved invitation 
arrives for him to go to America and compete in the World Freestyle 
Hairdressing Championship, a documentary crew decides to follow. Upon 
arrival, 12 minutes into the film, Crawford runs into problem after 
problem, not the least of which is that he wasn't actually invited to 
compete and has instead been offered a seat in the audience between 
Daniel Day Lewis and Carrot Top.
As Crawford's ego deftly guides him, he stumbles through obstacle after 
obstacle in his quest for the Platinum Scissors and to honorably 
represent all of Scotland. The most humorous moment comes when he needs 
a job to get his HAG (Hairdressers of America Guild) card and finds 
himself prepping animal costumes at a theme park, just an example of the 
many odd and hysterical situations he encounters.
In the spirit of last summer's most underrated film, Drop Dead Gorgeous, 
The Big Tease is a near-textbook mockumentary. Much of the film's humor 
can be credited to the constant spoofing of major competitions and the 
hairdressing industry. But don't expect this film to create many 
believers like Woody Allen's latest work, Sweet and Lowdown, or the 
smash hit The Blair Witch Project as that certainly isn't the intent 
here.  
The Big Tease perfectly captures and lampoons the essence of Hollywood; 
a cab driver carries around head shots, you need an appointment to get 
into anywhere and the elite know they're elite. But don't be mistaken, 
this is not a Hollywood film. Although the mammoth Warner Bros. is 
distributing the picture, it more closely resembles independent products 
like The Full Monty and The Castle than studio pieces.
Positive word-of-mouth should make The Big Tease a pleasantly surprising 
box office draw in the traditionally weak time between the release of 
Oscar contending films and the highly rated awards ceremony. Just don't 
expect any hair-splitting drama or overly flaky jokes.

   Americans can't get enough movies about sports
competitions.  We'll take movies "Any Given Sunday" and
we'll "Play It to the Bone."  We'll even cheer for "The
Waterboy" if we can't get "Bull Durham" every year.  If the
competition does not involve a ball, heck, we'll make up a
tournament, and we'll make sure the picture has the usual,
predictable victory for the good guys in the final seconds (or
a draw if both guys are good). We'll send the former champs
home in bad spirits showing them for the bad sports they
acted like throughout.  While Scotland displays its own
regional craze for soccer, the large, autonomous block of
land north of England is not globally known for any special
game, so Kevin Allen, using the scripting talents of Sacha
Gervasi and Craig Ferguson, came up with a bright idea.  If
tough men don't wear plaid, there's still an area in which they
can fiercely compete, and that's hair dressing.  
   "The Big Tease" is a comedy about a worldwide freestyle
hair dressing competition that's as fluffy and forgettable as
last season's fashions at Beverly Hills.  This is the kind of film
that has you rooting for the underdog throughout knowing full
well that he has victory in the bag once he overcomes the
usual obstacles that a villainous competitor puts in his way. 
Featuring a number of cameos by people playing themselves,
"The Big Tease" stars Craig Ferguson as gay, Scottish hair
dresser Crawford Mackenzie, a clueless but gutsy and
determined professional playing the scissors game with some
of the biggest names in tresses and locks.  He's the sort of
fellow that those in the audience wholly unimpressed with
sports can relate to: a celebrated frog in his own little pond
ignored and laughed at when trying to play the role of the
prince when he lands in the big time.  Watch this guy go for
the gold--the platinum scissors in this case--and you might be
inspired to push harder the next time you find yourself
brushed off by the folks you're trying to influence.
   Filmed by Kevin Allen as a mockumentary, "The Big
Tease" follows the misadventures of Scotland's well-known
hair stylist Crawford Mackenzie (Craig Ferguson) who never
quite understands that well known in his province does not
necessarily translate to the status of global celebrity.  Invited
by the annual L.A. Freestyle Hairdressing Contest people to
sit in on its annual competition, he mistakes the letter for an
invitation actually to participate.  Flying from Glasgow to L.A.
with a team of film makers led by actual documentarian Chris
Langham in the role of his friend, Martin Samuels, Crawford
runs up large bills under the misguided assumption that his
expenses are covered.  When the contest's coordinator,
Monique (Mary McCormack), sets him straight and refuses to
enter his name in the contest, Crawford is about to fly home. 
But he instead turns on his charm with Sean Connery's
publicist, Candy Harper (Frances Fisher), and prepares to
connive his way into the competition against the formidable
past champ, Stig Ludwigssen (David Rasche).
   Ferguson, who is popular in Scotland for his role on the
Drew Carrey TV show, evokes occasional laughter, principally
by his figurative pratfalls.  Since we're ahead of him each
step of the way, we simply sit back and wait for the sitcomish
scenes to produce their mild laughter.  One of the best
involves Crawford's discussion with the manager of the posh
L.A. hotel (Larry Miller) who pretends to interview The
Famous Guest but instead--after describing how  "I thank my
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ that I have not had a drink for
five days"--pressures him to keep his account up-to-date
despite a maxed-out credit card.  Much of the fun comes
from watching Crawford work on Sean Connery's publicist,
getting nowhere with her at first but casting a spell after doing
a number on her hair.  David Rasche is appropriately
villainous as the full-of-himself Norwegian-born champ who at
first dismisses the Scot as laughable but then plots to get
Crawford disqualified  through duplicitous tampering with the
materials.  The one series of shticks that does not work
involves limo driver Eamonn (Donal Logue), who like
everyone else in L.A. is working a day job only until he
breaks out with the next Oscar-winning screenplay.
   "The Big Tease" is one comedy that does not deserve its R
rating despite the suggestions of homosexuality.  It takes a
pleasant break from the teen gross-out comedies that have
plied their wares with varying degrees of success.  If there is
such a thing as a Scottish sense of humor, "The Big Tease"
probably appeals to just that.  For an American audience, the
movie is not unpleasant but awfully predictable and
weightless.
Rated R.  Running Time: 88 minutes.  (C) 2000

"He'll be among his own kind," Local Glasgow friends of Crawford Mackenzie
say of the gay stylist as he takes off to L.A. to compete in that huge
extravaganza -- the World Freestyle Hairdressing Championship.
This is a mock documentary with the flamboyant, boyishly-naďve, Scottish
comedian Craig Ferguson as the man with the golden comb. He's perpetually
fresh, and spunky - a young Will Smith with white skin and an accent. Never
caught on film acting, every line and camera-captured glance seems true,
innocent and delightfully unrehearsed.
The film is shot and edited with the same energy and flare playfully
embodying its charmingly cocky protagonist. Repeated still frames, with a
flash to imply photo-shots are just one gimmick the filmmakers use to keep
the pace snappy. Another is multiple chop cut interviews, so that commentary
never gets boring.
After receiving a letter to "participate" in an international hair
competition, our modestly vain stylist flies to L.A. only to discover that
he's become the victim of a promotionally motivated misunderstanding.
Undaunted (mostly) he braves heart first into the often cold-hearted
bureaucratic web of "who you know" in Hollywood in order to correct the
oversight and compete legitimately among the top hair professionals of the
world.
Just plain, good, clean fun; the tease climaxes in a ridiculous display of
hair presentation. Of course, you'll be routing for the underdog as
contestants go head to head; the M.C. remarks, "the tension in this room is
so thick you could style it with a comb."
