     Andrew Masset, Mariel Hemingway's ex-husband, abducts their
daughter Lindsey Haun and goes to his home country of Jordan.  The
United States government won't help Hemingway get Haun back, because by
Jordanian laws Masset has all rights over her.  Hemingway hires three
ex-Delta Force commandos to help her get back her daughter.
     DESPERATE RESCUE: THE CATHY MAHONE STORY aired on NBC on January
18.  I expect because of the high quality of this film, that it will be
repeated again, and may possibly be released on home video.  DESPERATE
RESCUE is an excellent film that I highly recommend you attempt to see.
DESPERATE RESCUE is of such high quality, that it doesn't look like a
television film, but like a theatrical release.  This film appears to
have a large budget, which the film makers used very well.  I give
DESPERATE RESCUE a five on a scale of zero to five.
     The performances in this film are excellent.  Especially Mariel
Hemingway ("Civil Wars", STEAL THE SKY); and Clancy Brown (BAD BOYS,
HIGHLANDER), Jeff Kober (THE FIRST POWER), and James Russo (COLD HEAVEN,
BEVERLY HILLS COP), who played the ex-Delta Force commandos.  Lindsey
Haun also gives a great performance and Andrew Masset gives a very good
performance.
      The locations used for this film are excellent.  DESPERATE RESCUE
was partly filmed in Israel, where some of the film actually takes
place, and the scenery is beautiful.  The buildings used, of which I
expect most really exist, are excellent and the vehicles used are great.
     DESPERATE RESCUE is very well written and kept up my interest
throughout the film.  The film starts out a little slow, but the rest of
the film more than makes up for it.  The film is based on a true story.
How closely the film follows what really happened, I don't know.
