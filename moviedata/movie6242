     You want multi-national?  How's this:  a Chinese actress playing a 
Japanese girl in a French film based on an Italian opera?  At first 
glance, it might seem odd, but, as brought to the screen by first time 
feature director Frederic Mitterrand, this adaptation of Giacomo 
Puccini's classic MADAME BUTTERFLY is electric.
     Film and theater occasionally mesh well; the same is rarely true of 
film and opera.  Exceptions like Ingmar Bergman's THE MAGIC FLUTE are 
rare.  The grand, overstated gestures of the operatic stage do not 
translate well to the cinema, and even the best sound systems cannot 
reproduce the transcendent fidelity of a live performance.  For the most 
part, therefore, motion picture versions of operas are doomed to exist 
primarily as pale, two-dimensional shadows of a more vibrant medium.
     For his 1995 version of Puccini's MADAME BUTTERFLY, Mitterrand (a 
documentary film maker and the nephew of the late French President) 
chose not to film a live performance or craft a set-bound, stagy motion 
picture.  Instead, he took his cast and crew on location (although the 
soundtrack was previously recorded), giving this rendition of the opera 
a decidedly cinematic quality.  There's a lot of camera movement, and 
cinematographer Philippe Welt was given the opportunity to compose a 
variety of complex shots and make frequent use of close-ups.  Because 
the lens catches each nuance of every performance, acting is as much a 
requirement as strong, clear singing.  From a technical standpoint, 
Mitterrand's approach to MADAME BUTTERFLY is unique, and it reaps 
dramatic dividends.  
     For those unfamiliar with the story, Puccini's opera tells of a 
self-absorbed American naval officer named Benjamin Franklin Pinkerton 
(Richard Troxell) who buys a 15-year old geisha, Cio-Cio-San (a.k.a. 
"Butterfly", played by Ying Huang), to be his "Japanese wife."  From the 
beginning, Pinkerton has no intention of staying with Butterfly -- he is 
using her as temporary amusement, a bit of comfort in a foreign port.  
Despite being enchanted by her quiet, fragile beauty, he has no 
difficulty abandoning her at the first opportunity.  Yet, even after 
Pinkerton has been gone for three years, Butterfly awaits his return, 
confident that he loves her as much as she loves him.
     MADAME BUTTERFLY takes place in 1904 Japan, just outside of 
Nagasaki, and, in addition to being a tragedy of Shakespearean 
proportions, it also illustrates a common international perception of 
American imperialist attitudes.  Pinkerton isn't just a good-looking, 
dislikable cad who abandons a young, innocent girl -- he's a 
personification of his entire nation, and, by extension, Butterfly 
represents the countries that the United States ruthlessly plundered and 
left behind.  Using archival footage of the time, Mitterrand brings home 
the film's historical perspective far better than a live version ever 
could.
     I'm not an opera buff or a voice critic, but it seems that Richard 
Troxell's vocal performance is somewhat weak, especially in comparison 
with that of Shanghai Conservatory soprano Ying Huang, whose arias are 
clear and vibrant.  Acting-wise, both leads are solid.  The likes of 
Ning Liang (as Butterfly's maid, Suzuki), Richard Cowan (as the American 
consul, Sharpless), and Jing-Ma Fan (as Goro, the oily marriage broker 
responsible for Butterfly and Pinkerton's union) do justice to the 
supporting roles.
     For the most part, operas, like musicals, improve with familiarity.  
It's difficult to guess how Puccini die-hards will react to some of 
Mitterrand's creative choices, but the result is a cinematic success -- 
powerful, passionate, and memorable.  It's a daring way for the director 
to present MADAME BUTTERFLY, and I applaud his decision to try something 
different than a traditional, formal version.  I have little doubt that 
my appreciation will increase with successive viewings.

     Okay, admit it.  You hate opera.  You've known this fact since
childhood and have never wavered in your opinion.  Now, confess.
You've actually never seen a real opera.  Flipping the dial and having
accidentally seen a few minutes on PBS doesn't count.
     If this syllogism fits you, then I have just the movie for you.
After watching the utterly lifeless MADAME BUTTERFLY, you will
confidently be to proclaim that you were right all along.  Opera is a
musical hoax perpetrated by a bunch of rich intellectuals.  As Mark
Twain put it about one opera composer, "I am told that his music is
better than it sounds."
     Being a big opera buff, I can testify that opera is one of God's
gifts to mankind, but as in all things, there are bad examples.  French
documentary director Frederic Mitterand's MADAME BUTTERFLY is devoid of
energy and the singing quality is minimal.  In the spirit of full
disclosure, I should admit that "Madame Butterfly" is not one of my
favorite of Puccini's operas, nevertheless, the production of it does
not have to be this boring.
     The story is set in Nagasaki, Japan in 1904, and it is a simple
tale.  American naval Lieutenant Benjamin Franklin Pinkerton (American
singer Richard Troxell) purchases himself a Japanese wife called
Butterfly (Chinese singer Ying Huang).  The American consul named
Sharpless (American singer Richard Cowan) warns Pinkerton that having a
foreign wife has responsibilities.  Pinkerton ignores this, and much of
the film happens during the three years when he is away.  Although he
sends no money, Butterfly somehow manages to keep up her middle-class
existence as evidenced in her clothes, servants, and housing.  This is
one of the many flaws in the staging.
     The director pays little attention to the singing and music, and
fixes his attention on the play.  His actors try more to speak their
lines than sing them.  The singers he chose have modest voices with
little resonance or interest.  Huang's voice is quite undeveloped and
shallow, and Troxell's voice is a little too high pitched and almost
seems to squeak.  Only Cowan has a voice that commands attention.  The
other singers in the cast are unmemorable.
     Ah, the dialog.  All operas are full of silly little lines, and
this one is no exception.  As Butterfly and her retinue slowly process
up the hill for the wedding, they sing, "So much sun.  So much sky.
Look, we've reached the top.  So many flowers."  When her prospective
bridegroom sees her, he remarks, "She's like a porcelain doll.  She
sets me on fire."
     My biggest problem with the movie is the staging.  The actors give
frozen gestures, and their movements are leaden.  If the singing was
exceptional, you could probably ignore the staging, but it isn't.  The
singers in this film have minuscule acting ability so they bring little
to their roles to compel the audience's attention.  Troxell, for
example, has exactly two expressions.  In the first part of the show,
he has a fake smile glued to his face, and in the last part, he looks
like he is suffering from a chronic case of gas.
     The only reason to bring an opera to the screen is to open it up,
but here most scenes are in or about the house giving the picture a
claustrophobic feeling.  On an opera stage, you would expect this, but
not in a movie.
     As you probably all know, the story has a tragic ending.  Here the
actors' lack of ability mutes its effect, but the ending does breathe
into the show its only semblance of life.  I will say this about the
film, there are a few classic arias that are pleasant to hear again
even if they are not particularly well done.
     On the good side, the cinematography by Philippe Welt and the sets
by Michele Abbe-Vannier are full of warm browns.  The interiors scenes
are the best, and the wooden tones radiate with a peaceful glow.
Exterior shots are less effective, but the ones of the morning haze are
particularly lovely.
     If you do go, make sure you go early or drink lots of coffee.
This film is a great cure for insomnia.  Being a critic, I forced
myself to see it all, and since the press screening was in the morning
after four cups of coffee, I was wide awake.
     MADAME BUTTERFLY runs 2:09.  It is in Italian with English
subtitles.  At the time of the press screening, it was not rated by the
MPAA, but it is a G film for every reason except possibly for the theme
which might get it a PG.  There is no sex, nudity, or bad language.
There is a little underdone and unrealistic violence at the end.  The
film would be fine for any kid old enough to be interested.  I can not
recommend this tepid attempt at turning an opera into a movie.  I give
the movie a single * for a few good arias.

Music: Giacomo Puccini
I love the music of Puccini, and there wasn't any doubt in my mind that
I would enjoy MADAME BUTTERFLY - unless of course the actors couldn't
sing. Although, I had been previously exposed to the music of Puccini on
cassette and radio, I was little aware of what the words actually meant.
So with the help of the much needed and greatly appreciated sub text, I
began to uncover the sinister nature of MADAME BUTTERFLY.
I had the general understanding that Captain Pinkerton would eventually
leave Butterfly, and as a result she would end her own life. However, I
wasn't fully aware of what a bastard Pinkerton (Richard Troxwell) truly
was. To think that he entered into a marriage with a geisha girl, as a
temporary solution for his loneliness; knowing well that by American
law, he could cast her aside anytime for another woman  makes my blood
boil! Although, this story may be fictional, it is probably based
loosely on fact. I have been told, that what happened to Butterfly was
not an uncommon occurrence for that era.
So I'm not surprised that the Japanese harboured such anti-Americanism
sentiment for a long time. You can't expect to be overly forgiving when
American sailors treat your women so badly. This probably didn't start
2nd WW, but there wouldn't have been any holding back over Pearl
Harbour.
Ironically, it took an Italian Composer by the name of Puccini to infuse
his music with such a heart-felt tragedy. One can feel the heart of the
loyal, devoted Butterfly in Un bel di, vedremo one of the most
beautifully created Arias of this century. French director, Frederic
Mitterrand has chosen well, his leads in the Chinese Soprano, Ying Huang
and tenor Richard Troxell.  Overall, a great moving piece of Opera that
will haunt us for a very long time. But if I had it my way, I would have
ended the story with Butterfly carving out Pinkerton's wanton heart with
a dagger.

Puccini's opera has never had a more beautiful, more loving, more
touching production than Martin Scorsese's presentation, directed by
Frederic Mitterand.
It is the late 1800s when the tall, handsome American, Captain
Pinkerton (Richard Troxell), arrives in Japan on the warship, the
Abraham Lincoln.   He rents a house in Nagasaki for 999 years as it
cannot be sold.  However, as he remarks to the American consul,
Sharpless (Richard Cowan), the lease can be broken at any time.    This
comes to mind when Goro (Jing-Ma Fan), a matchmaker, arranges a
marriage between Cio-Cio-San and Pinkerton.   Apparently, marriages can
as easily be broken.    In the end we see that Pinkerton thought of his
lovely bride as if she were a delightful toy.
The lovely Chinese actress-singer, Ying Huang, brings to the screen all
the hope and heartache that is experienced by Cio-Cio-San,   Ying's
every emotion, every smile, every movement of her face signals her
feelings.  It is we, the audience, who are so moved because we know
that she will be enduring great disappointment as her hopes are dashed
when Pinkerton, after 3 years back in the States, returns to Japan with
his American wife . . . while I had all I could do to gulp and keep
back my tears even though I have heard the opera many times.
This Madame Butterfly is a great movie.  Every character, including the
maid, Suzuki (Ning Liang), is perfect.  All are known in the world of
opera for their fine voices.  Unlike in most operas I have seen on the
stage, these singers can also act up a storm . . . and they do.
Ying Huand is a graduate of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music and has
performed in many cities of the world.  Richard Troxell, too, is world
renowned, as are Ning Liang and Richard Cowan.
