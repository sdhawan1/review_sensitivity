Susan Granger's review of "NUTTY PROFESSOR II: THE KLUMPS" (Universal)
When audiences went wild for the "Nutty Professor"
dinner-table sequences in which Eddie Murphy played various members of
the Klump clan, the idea for a sequel was born. So, although heavy-set
Professor Sherman Klump remains the central character, his
dysfunctional family is fleshed out, literally, each member with
his/her own subplot. Last time, Sherman Klump came up with a way to
lose weight; this time, he discovers a youth serum. Annoyingly
neurotic Dean Richmond (Larry Miller) wants to sell the formula to a
drug company, while romance comes in the form of Janet Jackson as a
shy, sweet professor who's in love with Sherman.  Aggressive, skinny
Buddy Love is still in Sherman's system, bursting out unexpectedly,
until Sherman extracts him from his body.  It's like Jekyll and Hyde
separating. Buddy is no longer a sexist, mischievous alter-ego; he's
an evil ego trying to steal Sherman's "youth juice". The clash between
Buddy and Sherman as separate entities gives the plot tension because,
when Buddy's DNA goes so do Sherman's IQ points. With the help of
make-up genius Rick Baker, Eddie Murphy is chameleon-like. Mama holds
the family together; she's the most like Sherman. Papa and Ernie
Jr. are more alike. And Grandma's sexually voracious. What's amazing
is the seamless interaction of all Eddie's characters: how the eyeline
movement of one is combined with physical action of another in a
complicated digital ballet. But, despite four writers and director
Peter Segal, it's is incoherent. Clever, yes. Funny, no. The visual
gags and crude jokes are stale and predictable, and the 'space dream'
scene is downright stupid. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
"Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps" is a raunchy, gimmicky, forced 3.
It's tour-de-force Eddie - all over the screen!

THE NUTTY PROFESSOR II:  THE KLUMPS
-----------------------------------
Scientific genius Sherman Klump (Eddie Murphy) has discovered the fountain of
youth - a serum that reverses the aging process and makes you young again. He
has also discovered true love with his beautiful colleague, Denise Gains (Janet
Jackson), a brilliant DNA researcher at his college. But, things go from good
to bad when Sherman's dastardly alter ego, Buddy Love, again rears his handsome
head and tries to steal the valuable serum in "Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps."
There are six reasons to go see "Nutty 2" and they're all named Eddie Murphy.
The comedian has established himself as not only a major moneymaking star for
the Hollywood movie machine; he has proven himself time and again to be a fine
character actor, too. When he intro'd his many faces in "The Nutty Professor"
in 1996, the audience clamored for more of the portly Klump family. To satisfy
that craving, executive producers Murphy and Tom Shadyac ("Liar Liar") put 
director Peter Segal ("Tommy Boy") to the task of bringing the weight 
challenged Klumps to the big screen again.
Sherman is on the verge of greatness with his new formula that can turn back
the body clock. It's still in the early stages of development, but Sherman's 
boss, Dean Richardson (Larry Miller), sees dollar signs as he envisions 
selling the youth juice to a big pharmaceutical firm and making their school 
a ton of money.  At the same time, Sherman's amorous intentions for Denise are 
increasing and he wants to make an honest woman out of her, except for one 
thing. Buddy Love.
Remember, in the '96 film, that Buddy became a part of Sherman due to an
experiment that went amok. Well, Buddy still resides within and, every so
often, makes his presence known to Sherman and those around him. Without 
warning, Buddy's irreverent and rude personality can bubble to the surface, 
ruining any hopes that Sherman might have for marital bliss. The stout 
scientist attempts to exorcise the nasty Buddy, but things go terribly wrong. 
Buddy Love is unleashed upon the world and the experiment causes Sherman to 
begin losing brain cells.  It becomes a race as Buddy tries to steal and sell 
the secret formula for $149 million, take the money and run while Sherman, 
with his mental capacity quickly diminishing, is forced to stop Buddy's scheme.
That's the plot and it carries the film through with an overall even and
entertaining pace. The love interest between Sherman and Denise is sweet, while
the conflict betwixt Sherman and Buddy provides the angst for the film. It's
all a well-packaged shell that encloses the meat of the movie's entertainment 
- the Klumps. Murphy gives a tour-de-force performance with his six distinctly
different characters - Sherman, Mamma Klump, Papa Klump, Grandma, brother Ernie
and Buddy Love. Each is a unique individual and Murphy gets the opportunity to
flesh them all out (no pun intended) into funny characters with distinct
personalities.
Grandma Klump steals the show when she's on the scene. She's a randy
octogenarian who maintains her very active libido with both pride and energy.
Hers reps the most bawdy of the film's dialogue as she unabashedly declares her
amorous intentions for Buddy Love. A daydream sequence, where she fantasizes
about what she wants to do with/to Buddy, provides some of the biggest laughs
and groans of disgust (good-natured) for the film. Murphy is so convincing as
Grandma that you forget that it's the actor.
The rest of the Klump family gets their due, too. Papa Klump has the rudest of
dialogue as he rags on everyone (especially Grandma, who gives it right back).
Papa also gets the chance to get down and dirty as he experiments on his own
with Sherman's formula. Mama is, still, the most gentle of the family and it
shows where Sherman gets his kind heart. Brother Ernie maintains an underlying
resentment for his genius brother and is less than the apple of his parents'
eyes. Janet Jackson gets the tough role of being second banana to the
outrageous humor of the Klumps. The pretty singer/actor doesn't stand a chance 
in doing comedy against the Murphy juggernaut of characters, so she takes the 
straight road and does a decent job conveying the intelligence and caring of 
Denise.  Buddy Love is relegated to his bad boy role and his mainstay is to 
shower insults upon Sherman with names like "blubber butt" and "chunky cheeks" 
- and, of course, that gleeful Murphy laugh.
The combination of the makeup mastery of veteran artist Rick Baker (whose work
runs the gamut from "The Howling" and "Ratboy" to the upcoming "How the Grinch
Stole Christmas) and the fabulous, sometimes subtle, special F/X, led by John
Fahrat ("The Nutty Professor"), make "Nutty 2" special indeed. Obviously and as
expected, Baker does a magnificent job (with Eddie Murphy's input) of creating
each of the Klumps. Murphy is one of the few Hollywood talents who are both
willing and able to undertake the grueling task of bringing the great makeup
F/X to life. The special visual F/X cover a lot of ground, too, putting the art 
of morphing to good use.
The screenplay, by Barry Blaustein, David Sheffield and Paul & Chris Weitz,
showcases Eddie Murphy as the Klumps. The goings on around the dinner table of
the massive members of the Klump family make for some of the best, albeit
insult driven, humor of the film. The main story, with the fountain of youth 
formula at its center, is really a vehicle to drive the Klumps around and give 
them the opportunity to banter. It's a smart move by the moviemakers, giving 
the audience what it wants.
Helmer Segal has been moderately successful with his previous ventures, but
"Nutty 2" is going to raise his status in Hollywood, especially if the film
makes the big box office bucks that I expect it will. He moves the
sometimes-naughty material along briskly and doesn't bog down at all along the
way.
"Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps" aims at a more mature demographic (PG-13
rating) than the first film and counts on the sometimes lewd interchanges 
between the Klump family members to titillate the viewing audience. It's not 
as raunchy as, say, "Scary Movie," but when Grandma talks about "getting' 
some," you have to laugh.

Most people don't realize that Eddie Murphy won the Best Actor award
from the National Society of Film Critics for his performance in The
Nutty Professor in 1996.  And it's not like there was a shortage that
year, either.  The NSFC passed up the likes of Billy Bob Thornton (for
Slingblade), Ralph Fiennes (The English Patient), Tom Cruise (Jerry
Maguire) and eventual Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush (Shine).
Was the NSFC off their cumulative rocker in '96?  Maybe.  But the group
has an uncanny knack for acknowledging deserving Academy Award nominees
(like Russell Crowe and Nick Nolte), as well as talent that Oscar just
plain overlooks (like Reese Witherspoon, Ally Sheedy and Bill Murray).
Their list of recent Best Picture winners reads like a who's who of
cinematic coolness (Being John Malkovich, Out of Sight, L.A.
Confidential, Breaking the Waves).
Even though his performance in The Klumps is even stronger than it was
in Professor, Murphy shouldn't clear off his mantle just yet.  After
all, The Klumps is a sequel to a remake of a Jerry Lewis film.  We're
not talking about your typical Oscar pedigree here, folks.
The Klumps takes the funniest and most memorable part of the first film
 the titular professor's four gassy relatives that are each played by
Murphy  and builds the movie around them.  Ordinarily, this would be a
recipe for disaster, but Murphy makes each of his characters so unique
and so witty, you almost forget that it's him underneath all of the
makeup and latex.
Murphy's performance aside, The Klumps isn't really that good of a
film.  Once again, Professor Sherman Klump (Murphy) is on the run from
his genetic alter ego Buddy Love (Murphy).  The film also features
storylines involving Sherman's horny grandmother (Murphy) and his
romantically challenged parents (Murphy and Murphy).  While the presence
of the additional Klumps shows off Murphy's wonderful skills as a
character actor, the script does nothing but serve as a launching pad
for a plethora of potty humor.
The Klumps opens with a dream sequence where Sherman is marrying a
fellow biology professor named Denise Gaines (Janet Jackson, Poetic
Justice).  After admiring his bride's ample cleavage, Sherman pops a
boner that turns into Buddy Love.  The next scene, where Sherman's
father has a retirement party at an all-you-can-eat restaurant, is more
lowbrow humor.  The meal is punctuated by burps, farts and talk of dick
size, but that's just the tip of the iceberg.  Before the credits start
to roll, you'll be treated to puke, flatulence, erectile dysfunction,
saggy boobs, bestiality and projectile turds, as well as nods to films
like Star Wars, Cape Fear and Armageddon.
The crux of the lame story, which was co-written by Barry W. Blaustein
and David Sheffield (Nutty) and Paul and Chris Weitz (American Pie),
focuses on Sherman's latest invention  a fountain of youth formula that
can actually make a person younger.  None of it makes sense, and the
inconsistent script has plot holes big enough for a Klump to fall
through.
On the plus side, Jackson is an improvement over Nutty's annoying Jada
Pinkett, although Pinkett probably wouldn't have insisted that her new
song be played throughout the film.  Larry Miller and John Ales reprise
their roles as Sherman's money-hungry dean and lab assistant,
respectively.  Directed by Peter Segal (My Fellow Americans), The Klumps
features some pretty funny outtakes during the closing credits, so don't
leave the theatre early.
1:45 - PG-13 for crude humor and sex-related material

Perhaps I remember the first "Nutty Professor" a little too fondly. A film
sporting the ridiculous premise of a large scientist who takes his own
"skinny medicine" to impress the woman of his dreams. The scheme backfires
when the effect toggles uncontrollably with one other side effect ... the
slim version has its own personality so extremely different from Professor
Sherman Klump that it also has its own name - Buddy Love. That film was a
surprise laugh riot, with two short visits to the Klump residence for dinner
that made it a classic. These supper scenes are stand-alone funny and
technical wonders with Eddie Murphy playing more than just the Nutty
Professor and Buddy Love. Hence a sequel that expands Klump family
involvement.
There's another reason for a sequel - 270 million dollars. The production
notes are suspiciously quick to point that figure out. In fact they put it
this way, "Following the $270 million box office triumph of "The Nutty
Professor" in 1996, Eddie Murphy returns to the role..." That's the first
sentence in the "About the Production" section. Perhaps this profit
anticipation diluted the formula a bit.
Buddy returns to the screen in "The Klumps." Just as Sherman is preparing to
marry the latest woman of his dreams (Janet Jackson) and present his newest
greatest invention (youth serum), Buddy Love steps in to fowl it all up. The
sequel certainly does have its moments - many in fact. When Sherman's horny
gramma catches Buddy sneaking around ... well lets just say she's fixin' to
give him more than just a spanking. That scene will have you howling. And
the wise-cracking university dean played by Larry Miller deserves more than
just a few kudos for his sharply hilarious sarcasm. He's every bit as sharp
as Eddie is. And the Klumps themselves, from the loving bickering between
dad and gramma, to the choir singing, hand-clapping momma - you'll love this
virtual family. Eddie performs them masterfully, while the cinematographers
and make-up people create a boisterously entertaining reality out of plastic
and film.
But good characters are only one ingredient in a good film. Bluntly put,
this one lacks the heart of the first. In trying to re-create an old magic,
it fails to invent its own new magic. And though I hate to say it, this
picture about science professors needs more chemistry. The look and feel of
the production itself is 1980's with an "E.T." kind of cartoony-exagerration
to details that would have been better off left realistic. I.E.: the liquid
solutions are all bright primary colors; lightening strikes the night Klump
takes another serum in hopes of extracting his "Mr. Hide;" and in order to
test his dwindling intelligence, Sherman uses a computer simulated maze to
race a lab rat around a real maze. (BTW, they missed a good computer mouse
joke there.) Also, I like shocking toilet humor as much as the next guy, but
this film way-overplayed its "big butt" card and overspent its fart joke
allowance. And lastly, Buddy Love is simply more annoying and less endearing
this time around.
These uninspired factors conspire to "thin-out" the effect of the funnier
more inspired scenes. I loved the first "Nutty Professor," but was a bit
disappointed after eagerly awaiting this sequel.

I don't expect much from Eddie Murphy these days.  For the past four
years, the gods of cinema--or the expansive payrolls of studio
conglomerates--have allowed him to make one bad movie after another.  
Such films as Metro, Doctor Dolittle, Holy Man, Life, and Bowfinger have
reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washed-up
hack performing as a studio puppet for 20th Century Fox and Universal
Pictures.  The biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest
film, Nutty Professor II: The Klumps.
The Klumps once again revisits the life of Sherman Klump, an overweight
university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places. 
Sherman has just invented a new "youth drink" that enables man or beast
to become younger for a short period of time.  Janet Jackson is the love
interest who chooses the lovable Sherman for a soul mate rather than
excel at her career as a university professor (and for the most
ridiculous reasons).  With love on his mind, Sherman is determined to
rid himself of his alter ego, Buddy Love from the first Professor, who
still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes Sherman to act
like a bad imitation of Vince Vaughn from Swingers.  With some
convoluted mumbo-jumbo about DNA extraction, Sherman extracts the "Buddy
Love" link in his DNA and smartly deposits Buddy into a handy-dandy lab
beaker.  But one night, the beaker is knocked over and Buddy Love is
regenerated... because every movie like this needs an unnecessary
villain to thwart the good guy.
Then the Klump family, all played by Eddie Murphy, step in for some
comedic relief involving old people having sex, flabby breasts, a slew
of fart and dick jokes, and enough fat people jokes that I lost count
after the first thirty minutes.  And did I mention the part where Larry
Miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster?  The movie finally
dissolves into a really bad Hallmark Family Special about realizing who
you are and what you can be in this world -- with enough soft lighting
and people on the verge of tears in every scene.
Pure and simple, The Klumps is a failure.  Its script was handled by not
one but five screenwriters, and it really shows during the awkward
transitions between scenes.  Any sense of story and plot were lost in
the rewrite process.  It's more discerning to learn that Chris Weitz and
Paul Weitz, the team behind one of the funniest films of the last
decade, American Pie, have their names stamped to this trash.  Hey guys
- quick note - keep this movie off of your resumes.
The characterization of Sherman's family, The Klumps, is one of the most
ignorant stereotypes of a black family I have ever seen in cinema. 
Everyone member of the family is a large person who wipes the bins clean
at a local buffet restaurant like pigs at a trough.  The Grandma is an
oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her
sagging breasts.  The Father is gruff, is fired from a blue-collar job,
is sexually inadequate, and cannot communicate with his family about his
feelings.  The Mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and
seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone.  The Brother is
silent and brooding and resembles the Ice Cube gangster character from
Boyz in the Hood.  Sherman himself is terribly insecure and never
conveys anything for the audience to become attached to.
But the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type
of convincing conversational or situational comedy.  The family scenes
from the first Nutty Professor worked so well because their
conversations were short and direct.  And you got the feeling that these
crass people couldn't act like this all the time.  The sequel does the
reverse and drives the negatives of the Klumps right in to the hilt,
making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the
last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic.  After a while, their
conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with
indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from
any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story.
Its also a damn shame that the makeup magic of Rick Baker -- who worked
on the original Nutty Professor and won an Academy Award for his work on
An American Werewolf in London -- and amazing digital special effects
that enabled Murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions
are built around such a lame story line.  Even the best effects can't
seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days.
Now that I think about it, the worst thing about this film has to be all
the money that it will make.  People will be lined up around the block
for it.  The studios will concoct the a sequel for release in the summer
of 2002.  Eddie Murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or
five roles, but he'll play every character in the movie.
I just can't wait to see Eddie Murphy in a love scene with himself.

Rated PG-13: language, crude/sexual humor. 
Starring: Eddie Murphy, Janet Jackson, Larry Miller, John Ales, Eddie Murphy, 
Eddie Murphy, Eddie Murphy, Eddie Murphy. 
In 1996 the world was introduced to a new version of the classic Jerry Lewis 
film "The Nutty Professor", the movie was a huge hit (almost $130m 
domestically) and continued Eddie Murphy's big hits. The movie was very good, 
very funny and quite sweet. When I first heard there was going to be a sequel 
I was a bit iffy on it, wondering how they would make a sequel to it. So we 
waited four long years to get a sequel to the beloved comedy, and it is here, 
even though it isn't as good as the original, and not many sequels are, its 
still a great way to contiune a great comedy series. 
This time around Sherman Klump is happy, its a couple years later from the 
first film, and he has a new girlfriend, Denise Gains (played quite well by 
Janet Jackson). But the other side of Sherman, Buddy Love is bothering him, 
he keeps hearing him inside of him, he keeps saying and doing stuff Buddy 
would do, Sherman decides to get the strand of DNA that is inside of him that 
contains Buddy Love out, but with some distrous results, Buddy Love becomes 
his own seperate person, and goes off to try to make Sherman a dumb person. 
Because since Sherman put Buddy out of his blood stream, he lost an important 
part of himself, and is never going to be the same unless he has Buddy Love 
back inside of him. 
The film has a side plot on it, but I will let you guys watch that yourself, 
so as not to spoil anything of the movie. This movie although Sherman is a 
big part of the film, this time his family is the main characters as well, 
providing alot of information about his family that in the first we really 
didn't get to know. We get to know the Klumps more than before, and know that 
they are more than just an overweight, farting family. They are sweet people 
who have troubles just like Sherman does, and at times we really feel for 
them. Eddie Murphy does a fantastic job of playing all these characters, in 
all he does six different characters and does them all justice. 
Janet Jackson is another standout, in her second starring role on the big 
screen (her first being "Poetic Justice") she does justice to her character. 
Her and Eddie Murhpy have great chemistry on screen and make a cute, 
believable couple, they both bring their characters out to the fullest, and 
are at times very believable. Larry Miller who played the head of the college 
in the first returns, and as always gives a wonderfully comical performance 
with his character, and in one scene his character has a little run in with a 
hamster that is unbelievably funny, I almost died laughing. 
The script was written by Steve Oderkerk, Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz of the 
"American Pie" fame, and is quite cleverly witty and at times downright 
hilarious. There is a few downsides to the movie though, first of all the 
plot is a bit underdeveloped, it jumps around a lot from one plot the other 
and I said once in the movie "I'm confused", but it quickly developed a solid 
plot around 45 minutes into the movie. The movie also has alot of good points 
to it, first up is the acting which is fabulous as described above, second is 
the script which is well written, and third is the wonderul make up effects, 
which one an Oscar for the first film, they are very well made, and disguise 
Eddie Murphy in all his characters quite well. 
Direction by Peter Segal is nice too, but his plot points are a bit jumbled, 
but besides that "Nutty Professor II: The Klumps" is a film that will be 
enjoyed by fans of the original, and maybe if your not even a fan of the 
original, I think you will still like this sequel. Its a good sequel, that 
leaves the question open; "Is Nutty Professor III that far away"?

Eddie Murphy used to be a great comedian. Then, he became a funny actor.
Then, he took a shot at singing and quickly realized that his talents
weren't as widespread as he believed, so he continued his pace at original
comedy. Nowadays, Murphy seems to have become a cash cow, delivering many
generic roles in retreads of formerly popular films from Christmas past. His
humor seems to be attached to the latex that his characters inhabit and his
jokes no longer have that Murphy "punch". BOWFINGER was a step in the right
direction. This film is a step in the wrong direction.
PLOT:
Professor Sherman Klump's alter-ego Buddy Love does not want him to get
married to the love of his life, Denise, so he breaks free of Sherman's body
and attempts to take credit for his fat chum's invention, a revolutionary
youth serum. All kinds of craziness ensues.
CRITIQUE:
A few big laughs and Granny Klump don't excuse this film's lame plot,
over-sentimentality and many gross, unfunny and regurgitated jokes. And why
slap in a "heartfelt" scene every few minutes? I know that we're supposed to
feel sorry for Sherman Klump because he's fat and lonely at times, but we
got that the first time that you struck us over the head with it...now make
us laugh, dammit! Over-the-top sexual innuendoes, potty humor and fart jokes
just didn't do much for me in this film. I think that it's the kind of movie
that you're either gonna like or not like. Many people walked out of the
audience that I saw it with, but many others were laughing out loud. I
chuckled every now and again, mostly when Mother Klump and Granny Klump were
in the forefront, but found much of the story to be very, very boring, and
Eddie Murphy's primary characters of Sherman and Buddy Love to be the least
interesting.
And you'd figure that with a title like THE KLUMPS, the studio would have
focused more on the secondary Murphy characters, but other than a tired
running sketch between Mother and Father Klump (something about him not
being able to hold an erection...haha), none of them were really developed
further. Make a film starring Granny Klump going on vacation or something,
and I'm there! But watching Murphy overact as Buddy Love and overplay his
sad puppy look as Sherman just annoyed the hell out of my after a while. And
what's with some of the embarrassingly generic comedy bits like Sherman
accidentally slipping the table cloth into his zipper and then getting
up...haha, guess what happens to everything on the table? Is this supposed
to be fresh comedy? Don't think so! Felt a lot like Archie comic book jokes
to me. Janet, Ms. Jackson (cause I'm nasty), does an okay job as the
one-dimensional girlfriend who loves Sherman despite him acting like an ass
every minute, but no one really cares much about her. On the other hand, a
shout-out does definitely go out to Eddie Murphy who once again amazes as
all of these different characters (all flawlessly executed), but I
personally think that he has overextended his "latex" card with this one.
How's about you get back to some real original Eddie Murphy comedy, dude?
Enough of the retreads!
Overall, this movie will either amuse you with its few big funny moments and
Granny Klump disgusting eroticism, or bore you with its genericism,
indescribably inane plot and mumbling dialogue. In fact, much of the
dialogue between the family members is lost because of overlapping and
hard-to-decipher mumbling.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
One dream sequence in this film pays homage to three science-fiction films
including STAR WARS, ARMAGEDDON and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. Why you may ask?
I have no idea!
Eddie Murphy plays no less than six characters in this film: Sherman Klump,
Buddy Love, Mama, Papa, Ernie and Granny. The transformation in girth that
each character required demanded that Murphy endure between 3 to 5 hours of
extensive make-up every day.
Actor/comedian Chris Elliot has a three-second "cameo" in this film (or is
that a part?). Yikes, who's your agent, dude?
Janet Jackson, a singer who has sold over 45 million albums worldwide, also
used to play Willis' (Todd Bridges) girlfriend in the popular TV sitcom
"Different Strokes".
This is Murphy's third collaboration with producer Brian Grazer. They also
worked on LIFE and BOWFINGER together.
Director Peter Segal's directorial debut was on NAKED GUN 33 1/3. He
followed that up with MY FELLOW AMERICANS and TOMMY BOY.
Co-screenwriters Paul and Chris Weitz made their own feature film debuts as
directors of 1999's teen comedy romp AMERICAN PIE.

That mountainous family from "The Nutty Professor" has returned. This time 
the brilliant (though still larger than life) Sherman Klump (Eddie Murphy) 
has found the secret to a youth formula, which his boss, Dean Richmond 
(Larry Miller) is selling to a pharmaceutical company for 150 million 
dollars. However, before Sherman can become rich and famous he faces three 
problems: one, he is madly in love with his partner on the project, Denice 
Gains (Janet Jackson); yet he can't ask her to marry him because of his 
second problem, Buddy Love (Eddie Murphy), is still lurking inside Sherman, 
making him say and do things he doesn't mean; and three, the youth formula's 
effects are only temporary. So Sherman and his chief assistant, Jason (John 
Ales), think up a way to eliminate Sherman's first two problems by 
extracting Buddy's remaining DNA. This causes two unfortunate side affects: 
Buddy Love is released into the world again after a freak accident in the 
lab; and Sherman's brain is damaged, causing him to grow dumber by the 
minute.
Now you're probably wondering how my plot summary managed to have no mention 
of Sherman Klump's family. After all, the previews made the film out to be 
nothing but a long series of hilarious dinner table scenes ala the first 
"Nutty Professor" film. We do get one scene more than a little similar to 
the original film's now famous dinner table scene, but while it may be 
fairly amusing this time around, we've seen it all before. The fact that 
most of the humor in "Nutty Professor II" has been recycled can be viewed as 
both a strength and a weakness. You're obviously wondering how recycled 
humor can possibly be a strength, and the answer is quite simple. The old 
humor feels familiar and comfortable. It's also amusing because the humor 
from the original film is sharp and clever (take a very amusing little 
homage to "Cape Fear" for example). A lot of the new humor added is nothing 
but typical year 2000 gross-out humor, which I'm personally getting more 
than a little tired of (the giant hamster scene is a great example of this).
>From the opening credits, where Eddie Murphy's name is the only one 
advertised before the film's title appears, you know exactly who this movie 
belongs to. Janet Jackson ("Poetic Justice"), John Ales ("Spy Hard"), and 
particularly Larry Miller ("The Big Tease") are present only to further 
Murphy's jokes. So how does Murphy fare? Well, quite frankly, it depends on 
the character he's playing at the time. As Sherman Klump - that big, kindly 
blimp, Murphy is just as likeable as he was in the first film. As Buddy 
Love, he doesn't quite pull off the act this time around. In the first film 
Buddy Love was often uproariously funny; in the sequal he just seems to get 
in the way. He doesn't have enough screen time to leave any sort of 
impression, and when he is on screen he spends most of his time sniffing the 
air and going to the bathroom on newspaper (more on that later). His acting 
like a canine is amusing the first couple of times, but when he starts doing 
it for the sixth or seventh time, the routine has worn out its welcome.
As the Klump family, Murphy's comic abilities depend entirely on which 
family member he's playing. Sherman is still the quaint, kindly man he was 
in the first film, but he's treated like garbage this time around, and it 
isn't funny watching him be embarrassed since he's so likeable. Watching 
Sherman make an idiot of himself in front of Denice's parents made me feel 
bad rather than making me laugh. Grandma Klump, on the other hand, is 
uproariously funny. Any scene with her is so hilariously vulgar I sometimes 
couldn't breath I was laughing so hard; yet her screen time is so limited 
these laughing spells were few and far between. Sherman's parents, Mama and 
Papa Klump, don't fare quite so well. There's a moronic little subplot 
involving Papa's inability to, um, pleasure his wife in bed, but it's never 
particularly amusing. Last, we have Sherman's brother, Ernie. Ernie was 
barely seen in the first film and continues this trend in the sequel. This 
is a shame because I could always tell a great comic character was just 
aching to break free (his few lines in the dinner scene are some of the 
best).
Contrary to what I had feared, the gross-out humor in "Nutty Professor II" 
is really quite restrained (of course, I could be saying that just because I 
now compare everything to "Scary Movie" in terms of gross-out humor). While 
the film is loaded with flatulence jokes (come on, what did you expect?), it 
also contains a fair amount of intelligent jokes. However, Buddy Love is not 
involved in any of these intelligent jokes. I said I'd try to explain why he 
was acting like a dog, so here goes. When Sherman extracts Buddy's DNA, the 
vile containing it is knocked off onto an electrical outlet. While lying on 
the ground a dog walks into the room and scratches a hair off onto the pile 
of goop, which gives Buddy's DNA a host to latch on to and recreate him. 
Since he was created using a combination of Sherman's DNA and a dog's, he 
behaves like a dog while looking like a human. I didn't say it made sense, I 
just said I'd try to explain it. "Nutty Professor II" runs far too long at 
110 minutes, and it should have been no longer than 90. I'd recommend it to 
people who adore fart jokes and give the film a rather generous three out of 
five stars.

 Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (2000) 1/2 star out of 4. Starring Eddie
Murphy, Eddie Murphy, Eddie Murphy, Eddie Murphy, Eddie Murphy, Eddie
Murphy, Eddie Murphy, Eddie Murphy, Janet Jackson and Larry Miller.
Screenplay by Barry W. Blaustein & David Sheffield and Paul Weitz &
Chris Weitz. Story by Steve Oedekerk, Blaustein & Sheffield. Directed by
Peter Segal. Rated PG-13
 "Nutty Professor II: The Klumps" is a prime example of why movie
sequels are usually scorned and derided.
 There is absolutely no reason for this movie except to fatten the
wallets of Universal Pictures and of the cast member -probably Eddie
Murphy - who has a percentage deal with the studio.
 The movie is like its hero, Sherman Klump, fat, ungainly and leaden.
 It is a cynical offering concocted by a goulash of writers who couldn't
move beyond tired flatulence jokes and making fun of old people having
sex.
 They even threw in a tired fantasy sequence lamely spoofing
"Armageddon" and "Star Wars." How pathetic.
 "Nutty Professor II" is basically an ego trip for Murphy who not only
portrays Professor Sherman Klump, but also assays the roles of Granny
Klump, Mama Klump, Papa Klump, Young Papa Klump, brother Ernie Klump,
Lance Perkins and Buddy Love.
 And I bet if given the opportunity, Murphy would have also played the
giant mutant hamster.
 The silly story revolves around a genetic youth formula invented by
Sherman, which is stolen by the re-animated Buddy Love who has been
genetically removed from Sherman's body then accidentally brought back
to life via a dog's DNA.
 Don't ask or try to understand because it doesn't make a lick of sense.
And neither does the film.
 It's merely one big excuse for Murphy to parade around in old-person
drag bouncing a fake pair of breasts, as if it were the height of humor.
 Even Jerry Lewis, who is listed as one of the picture's executive
producers, should be embarrassed to have his name in the credits.
 OK, Bloom, you're asking, a couple of weeks ago you raved about "Scary
Movie," in which the low-brow humor was heavy on sex, bodily fluids and
bodily functions. So, Mr. Critic, what's the difference between the two?
 Simple, "Scary Movie "- in its own disgusting way - was spoofing a
known genre while also laughing at itself. "Nutty Professor II" simply
mocks the audience, making you feel like a sucker for shelling out a few
bucks to waste your time with this tired turkey.
 "Nutty Professor II" spends so much time showing off Rick Baker's
excellent make-up effects that it forgot the jokes. You need more than a
versatile actor such as Murphy dressing up as various people to propel a
movie. You need to build a plot, create characters with substance and
situations that offer a payoff - whether comic or dramatic - to involve
the audience.
 "Nutty Professor II" does none of these. And it is too bad because I
always have liked Eddie Murphy, and I yearn for the old Murphy who was
so smart and sassy in "Trading Places," "48 HRS" and the original
"Beverly Hills Cop."
 Murphy showed great promise as a comic actor. Instead he became a movie
star.
 "Nutty Professor II" should do well for a week or two at the box
office. Then, like most sequels of its ilk, it will be forgotten,
eventually consigned to the bargain bins at various video stores and
discount houses where it belongs.

Eddie Murphy is back as that fat scientist Prof. Sherman Klump who's trying 
to exorcise the remains of his
alter-ego Buddy Love. And since he's a nutty professor he concocts a formula 
that kind of acts as a Buddy
Love enema (eww), but somehow ends up bring Love to life as an entirely 
separate person. There's also a
plot about Love's attempt to steal Klump's latest gene-bending formula but 
that's something of a minor
issue with this film. 
As the title states, this movie is about the Klump family and Murphy plays 
all of them with total
commitment and hilarity ensues. Oh, it's not the smartest script in the world 
but I do have to admit it's got
great characterization. I won't elaborate any further here, since there's 
about six different characters who
are all integral to the story and everything. This movie's a pure summer 
comedy and that's certainly what
we get. 
If you've seen the commercials and previews that have been in very heavy 
rotation for months and
months now you know this is really envelope-pushing comedy (at least of a 
PG-13 movie). Does it work?
For the most part yes. There isn't a lot of really graphic, raunchy stuff to 
speak of, most of it is implied
and/or exaggerated to the point of being cartoony and silly. It sometimes 
makes you wince but you're still
laughing. And it's all brought together by a fairly good story not meant to 
be taken all that seriously.
Believe me it could've have been much worse (i.e. the first movie).

Gosh, aren't fart jokes funny?  And if you've blown upwards of fifty 
bucks to take your family to the movies, you'll certainly want lots of 
them for your entertainment dollar.  How about flatulence so intense 
that it literally sets a restaurant on fire?  Now, that would really be 
funny.  Right?
Well, so apparently believes the studio which spent over seventy million 
dollars coming up with the sequel to THE NUTTY PROFESSOR starring Eddie 
Murphy.  This time called NUTTY PROFESSOR II: THE KLUMPS, the movie 
again stars a trash-talking Eddie Murphy, playing a host of roles.  The 
only commendable part of the production is the amazing make-up effects 
that allow Murphy to look like a wide variety of obese characters.
The writing credits for this abomination are shared by no less than 5 
writers: Steve Oedekerk, Barry W. Blaustein, David Sheffield, Paul Weitz 
and Chris Weitz.  I'd recommend that they all hide their heads in shame.  
The movie will probably make a bundle, but, surely, they could have come 
up with more imaginative material than this smelly batch of recycled 
bathroom humor.  They even stoop to having an octogenarian mistakenly 
eat a large piece of feces.
This "R" movie, which is incorrectly rated PG-13, is actually written 
with dumbed-down humor that seems designed to appeal to 8-year-old boys' 
crude sensibilities.  But, the movie would certainly not be appropriate 
for anyone younger than their teenage years. Among other offensive 
scenes are those of killer turds and an animal having anal sex with a 
human.
Moreover, crudeness does not equal funny, as the renowned Farrelly 
brothers (THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY) demonstrated recently in ME, 
MYSELF & IRENE, a much better film than NUTTY PROFESSOR II.  At least 
the MPAA correctly rated ME, MYSELF & IRENE as an R.  Both films share 
about the same level of coarseness in their brand of attempted humor.
When not dispensing one disgusting joke after another, the movie follows 
a plot that has Professor Sherman Klump (Murphy) trying to rid himself 
of his nefarious alter ego, Buddy Love (Murphy).  There are plenty of 
subplots involving the rest of the fat Klump clan.  Typical of these is 
an unfunny bedroom scene between Papa Klump (Murphy) and Mama Klump 
(Murphy).  "Viagra doesn't work for me," he tells her, spurning her 
advances.  "I've been taking them like M&Ms."
I tried hard to think of good things about the movie other than the 
make-up.  All I can come up with is that Janet Jackson, as the 
professor's girlfriend, does have a particularly inviting smile.  
(Another would be that Murphy mumbles half of his lines, which partially 
spares us from some of the film's inanities.)  That's it.  If you're 
still dead set on wasting your money on this film, don't say I didn't 
warn you.
NUTTY PROFESSOR II: THE KLUMPS runs a long 1:50.  It is officially rated 
PG-13 for "crude humor and sex-related material."  Consider it an R.  It 
would be acceptable for most teenagers, but I'd certainly advise against 
anyone seeing it.

_Nutty_Professor_II:_The_Klumps_ (PG-13) *** (out of ****)
"Eddie Murphy is the Klumps," state the print ads for
_Nutty_Professor_II:_The_Klumps_, and Universal must be commended for an
uncommon level of truth in advertising.  Peter Segal's entertaining
sequel to Tom Shadyac's smash 1996 remake of the Jerry Lewis starrer
_The_Nutty_Professor_ is, like the original, a stunning testimony to the
brilliance and versatility of its star.  Indeed, Eddie Murphy _is_ 
_The_Klumps_.
As in the first film, Murphy not only plays large, gentle Professor
Sherman Klump, but also Sherman's grouchy father Cletus, loving mother
Etta, surly brother Ernie, and feisty Granny--as well as Sherman's
destructive alter ego, Buddy Love.  As the film opens, Sherman is haunted
by and occasionally taken over by Buddy, the manifestation of his more
outspoken urges.  Seeing the ever-increasing emergence of his Buddy
personality as a threat to his relationship with his true love, colleague
Denise Gaines (Janet Jackson), Sherman undergoes a risky procedure to
have Buddy's DNA permanently removed from his brain.  Naturally, things
don't go as smoothly as planned, and while Buddy is indeed separated from
Sherman, he becomes an entirely separate person.
The science that brings about the rebirth of Buddy--who, in an inspired
twist, isn't quite his old self--is pure hokum, as are all the mechanics
behind the ingredient at the center of the film: Sherman's revolutionary
youth formula, which he hides from Buddy in the Klump family garage.  But
more than the Klump home plays an increased role in _Nutty II_; as the
title implies, Sherman's other family members are given subplots of their
own--most prominently Mama and Papa, who are looking to bring back some
spark in their marriage; and Granny, who has a new beau (Gabriel
Williams) with whom she shares the joy of "relations."  Not only are the
family members' roles expanded, so is the type of humor surrounding them.
 Director Peter Segal and writers Barry W. Blaustein, David Sheffield,
Paul Weitz, and Chris Weitz (the latter two the duo who directed
_American Pie_) haven't completely dropped the toilet humor that
characterized the Klump family's two scenes in the original film (though
they probably should have; the flatulence jokes are among the film's
flattest gags), but the bulk of their laughs derive from their
personalities--or in the case of hilariously bickering Papa and Granny,
the clash of them.
With a number of other Klumps getting their share of screen time along
with Sherman, not to mention Buddy (who once again plots Sherman's ruin),
something had to give, and what gets the short shrift is the romance. 
Jackson, in her first screen role since _Poetic_Justice_, is likable and
poised, but Denise is so blandly written, loving Sherman unconditionally
from first frame to the last and doing little else.  It would have been
nice to see their relationship develop, like the first film's more
endearing one between Sherman and Jada Pinkett's Carla Purdy (who is
briefly mentioned here); or at least run into some turbulence to create
some dramatic tension.  But since they're perfect for each other,
everything's perfect between them, and while that's all well and good, it
doesn't make for the most interesting of viewing.
But what never fails to interest is the virtuoso acting display by
Murphy.  With four credited writers, the script of _The_Klumps_ doesn't
always quite flow, but Murphy's unparalleled prowess smooths over the
rough spots.  Each character he plays is clearly, distinctly drawn and
funny and endearing in his or her own way.  Of course, Murphy's bravura
turn is aided immeasurably by Rick Baker's outstanding makeup work and
the efforts of the visual effects crew, but it is Murphy who gives each
one of the Klumps energy and soul.
That's what ultimately makes _The_Klumps_ an enjoyable time at the
movies: its overall high spirits--and, of course, the simple fact that it
makes you laugh.  And in the season of unpretentious cinematic
entertainment, that's what matters.

   Did "The Nutty Professor," directed by 1996 by Tom
Shadyac, really need a sequel?  If the insatiable demand by
the target audience of movies like "Dumber and Dumber" can
be whetted by "Nutty 2" and even "Nutty 3" and the box office
computers can gobble up all the change that will inevitably
arrive, then, sure.  The market research suits were probably
on target in pushing for a sequel.  But since we've already
seen in '96 how the special effects guys and cosmetics
people did a remarkable job of transforming Eddie Murphy
into seven people who can flawlessly interact in the same
frame, there's nothing in this second venture that needed to
be fashioned.  As director Peter Segal pushes for jokes that
register only on lowest-common-denominator meters, he
misses his opportunity to express some loftier ideas: the
notion that people should accept themselves for what they
are.  After all, doesn't the 400-pound Sherman Klump win the
love of the lovely and bright Denice Gains (Janet Jackson)
because he is kind, intelligent and humble?
   Segal opens the story on a dark dream indulged by the
professor, beginning with vows he is taking in a marriage
ceremony with the lovely Denice and ending with the
scattering of the entire church party when the loud and
arrogant Buddy Love springs from his pants.  Recall from
"Nutty 1" that the massively overweight Sherman had
swallowed a serum for re-aligning his genetic structure, which
transforms him into a well-toned alter ego, Buddy Love. 
While the new man is a sight for the sore eyes of any young
and beautiful maiden, his personality is conversely obnoxious. 
This time around, using biology professor Denice Gains's
strategy for changing his genetic structure, Sherman is finally
able to remove Buddy from within his body, but having done
so, Buddy turns on his creator and embarks on a plan to
steal Sherman's formula for restoring youth to aging bodies
and gain the $150 million offered by a large pharmaceutical
company for its rights.
   To pull in the large numbers of movie fans who have
shown themselves insatiably addicted to toilet jokes, the four
writers have implanted a series of occasionally funny but
mostly mind-numbing and sit-comish incidents into a sadly
fragmented and incoherent script.  In one episode perhaps
intended to spoof the 1950s sci-fi genre, a giant hamster is
created when the professor's youth serum liberates
dangerous side effects, a rodent which attacks its enemies by
hurling its wastes scattershot into its audience, felling even a
policeman with drawn gun as though attacking with the
Redcoats' cannonball firepower in "The Patriot."  Since the
hamster makes love as well as war, it seizes the opportunity
to jump the college dean (Larry Miller) while the administrator
is attempting to escape, haplessly, while wrapped in a blanket
of fur.  
   But the hamster is not the most irritable character in this
splintered, would-be comedy.  The prize for that attribute can
be shared more or less equally with the Klump family, all of
whom are played by Eddie Murphy utilizing the ingenious
disguises of Rick Baker's makeup.  While much credit need
be given to the special effects department for allowing the
interaction to take place as though the Klump family were
indeed a half dozen separate people, each member of the
group competes for the title of most vulgar, and the jury may
still be out on whether the hamster has routed the Klumps in
that department.  Mama and Papa Klump advance a running
gag on sexuality, with Mama trying ever-so-hard to turn on
her defensive and seemingly reluctant husband in scenes that
could remind TV viewers of a similar running gag on
"Married...with Children."  The octagenarian Grandma Klump
in one gross-out scene attempts to seduce young Buddy
Love, having surprised the much younger man in the garage
of the Klump household: "This must be your lucky night."
   While the majority of the audience will probably reject this
counsel, director Segal would have done better to emphasize
the romance between the obese but charmingly shy Sherman
and the lovely woman of his dreams.  Both are as intelligent
as they are decent and down-to-earth and both deserve far
greater time than Segal and his trigger-happy editor, William
Kerr, afford them.
