Many claim that an Academy Award nomination is a springboard to bigger and
better things. In Sharon Stone's case, her nomination for 1995's CASINO
brought her roles in such commercial disasters as DIABOLIQUE, LAST DANCE,
SPHERE, THE MIGHTY and GLORIA. Unfortunately for her fans, this film is just
another piece of dung to hang on the mantle of bad movie choices.
PLOT:
The lives of a rich horse-breeder and his wife are turned upside-down when
an old friend returns with some incriminating evidence to link them to a
blackmailing scheme which occurred about 20 years earlier.
CRITIQUE:
Interesting premise and build-up turns into a ho-hum mystery flick with very
little intrigue or originality, filled with overwrought drama in the face of
underwhelming secrets and characters who behave in ways inexplicable and
unexplained to the audience. Mystery dramas work best when a deep, dark
secret draws layers and layers of deceit, blackmail and revenge on top of
the original cover-up, but this film basically takes one blackmailing secret
and blows it up to be more than what it truly is. In fact, this supposedly
"dark secret" seems to have been eating away at these people for over twenty
years, but according to what I saw in this film, there wasn't really much to
be worrying about in the first place. In fact, the movie doesn't even really
bother resolving anything regarding the secret, save for a few bogus
attempts by one of the original blackmailers to seek revenge on the others,
but even that doesn't really go anywhere. If there is some deeper meaning in
this film about how one's past is always set to haunt them, well then fine,
whoop-dee-doo, good point.
But why waste a perfectly well-established blackmailing background when you
are just going to beat around its bush for an hour and a half, offer very
little intrigue or suspense, and end it all off on a shoulder-shrugging
whimper? What a bust. It's too bad because I was actually interested in this
movie for most of its length, with a definite kudo in the way of the
flashback sequences which helped establish the back-story as the film
progressed. Albert Finney was also a standout as the old man with a sorted
past, as well as Keener who spiced up her cute, innocent role with some of
her usual flair. Of course, Bridges and Nolte respectively stamped in their
proverbial roles as the upper-class dude with great blow-dried hair and the
two-bit boozehound with a messed up doo. And Stone, aaah Sharon Stone, what
can we say? Can anyone say "over-acting" or a cheap imitation of the classic
Jessica Lange drunk? Luckily for her, she's barely in this film, but I think
it's time for her agent to start handing her more of the "sexier" scripts,
since her foray into the world of character flicks, seems to falling flat.
All in all, this film does have a decent premise and solid acting for the
most part, but doesn't fill in enough holes, offer enough real suspense or
give us enough insight into the motivations of its characters to warrant a
recommendation from my end.
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Actress Sharon Stone is apparently a member of MENSA, with an IQ of 154. Her
first "screen" role was as the "pretty girl on the train" at the beginning
of Woody Allen's STARDUST MEMORIES. In 1980, she auditioned and lost the
role of Vickie LaMotta to Cathy Moriarty for the Martin Scorsese movie
RAGING BULL. Fifteen years later, she starred as Ginger in Martin Scorsese's
CASINO and received her first Oscar nomination for her role.
According to the IMDb, in 1962 Nick Nolte was given a 5-year probation for
selling fake draft cards.
Actress Catherine Keener is married to actor Dermot Mulroney.
Kimberly Williams plays the "young Sharon Stone" role in this movie. Her
first big break was when she was chosen as the lead in the 1991 comedy THE
FATHER OF THE BRIDE with Steve Martin.
This is director Matthew Warchus' first film as well as his screenwriting
debut. The film is actually based on a Sam Shepard play.

"Simpatico" doesn't involve us in its story, so much as it blackmails us into 
it. Yes, I kept wondering what was going to happen next, but not because I 
cared -- I simply wanted to make sense of it all. The film's method is to 
throw a lot of bewildering information at us, and keep us watching by 
promising it'll all be sorted out by the end.
The main characters are Carter (Jeff Bridges), a successful businessman whose 
acres of property include a sleek country mansion, and Vinnie (Nick Nolte), 
an angry slob whose rotting bungalow lies in the middle of sandy nowhere. As 
the movie opens, Carter is getting ready to sell his family's prized 
racehorse, but is interrupted from the deal by a phone call from Vinnie, who 
orders him to come cross-country to see him. Carter immediately hops on a 
plane.
With the possible exception of Hugh Grant, millionaires don't often abandon 
their busy schedules to visit shady bums, so what strange hold does Vinnie 
have on Carter? After a lot of unspecific talk about 'the past", we learn 
that years ago the two men were involved together in gambling and bribery 
scams, and Vinnie has always held onto proof of these illegal actions that 
could destroy Carter's credibility in legitimate circles. Since Vinnie is 
more than a little unstable, Carter does not want to upset him, and appeases 
his old friend as much as he can. We get the sense that this arrangement has 
been going for quite some time -- Vinny making threats, Carter giving him 
things to keep him quiet.
Things may not, however, be so simple this time. Vinny is really starting to 
act like he'll do something with his evidence; perhaps he'll expose Carter, 
perhaps just re-open old wounds for the man's wife Rosie (Sharon Stone), 
whose part in her husband's extortion rackets left her permanently 
emotionally scarred.
Right there is, more or less, the whole story of "Simpatico", which unfolds 
in an odd manner: Characters pop up onscreen now and again talking about 
secretive things the audience don't know anything about. Flashbacks appear, 
to explain tiny pieces of the puzzle. Then come moments of quiet reflection.
While this deliberately perplexing method of storytelling must have seemed 
like a hot idea to the filmmakers, because it lets them stretch their meagre 
plot out to feature length, it leaves the audience at a loss to understand 
whether or not the actors' performances are any good. We're never let know 
what the motivations of the characters are, let alone whether these 
motivations are being played convincingly. Nolte and Bridges do a lot of 
grunting and shouting; Stone appears far too late in the film for her 
passionate anger to redeem the dullness of the script. Albert Finney, playing 
a man Vinnie and Carter ruined, does a lot of weird babbling in a typically 
terrible American accent; Catherine Keener, as a checkout girl who never 
wanted to be involved with a bunch of crooks, switches between tough cookie 
and gullible simpleton, often within the same scene. Maybe all this made 
sense in the Sam Shepard stage play upon which "Simpatico" is based. It 
doesn't in the movie.
This would have been a fascinating piece of work if the plot had been 
outlined in the opening twenty minutes, and the rest of the script had 
focused on the characters. Who are these people? Who were they? How do they 
feel about each other? How did the consequences of their swindles 
specifically affect them? "Simpatico" ignores all these potentially 
interesting avenues, trying to work on the level of its mystery alone -- 
mystery that isn't mysterious, just confusing.

     I love a good thriller.  And no one makes good thrillers any more.
Enter SIMPATICO, with a cast boasting both Nick Nolte and Jeff Bridges,
not to mention Albert Finney and Sharon Stone -- all set among the
intrigue of a scandal involving horse racing, blackmail, and steamy
sex.  How could this miss?
     By being as straightforward as, well, a horse race.  It's just a
big loop from start to finish.  No real surprises along the way, just
jockeying for position.  SIMPATICO finishes right where it started, with
a time of 106 minutes.
     Based on the play by Sam Shepard, Nolte, Bridges, and Stone play a
trio of friends, long since torn apart by a scam gone awry in their
youth.  As we quickly learn, Bridges (now a famous horse breeder and
racer) is now being blackmailed by his old pal Nolte (now a bum in
California).
     The plot thickens.  Nolte phones out of the blue: Something is
amiss.  Bridges quickly flies to California, but things don't go as
planned.
     The problem with SIMPATICO is that no one expects things to go as
planned.  That Nolte is going to double-cross Bridges is a given.
Exactly why is a mystery, and that's one that, sadly, never gets
explained.  In fact, that can be said for the entire film.  Example: Why
Bridges decides to send Nolte's girlfriend to Kentucky to work a deal
for him is inexplicable and bizarre.
     Ditto the behavior of all the characters.  SIMPATICO merits barely
a "Hmmm" on the surprise-o-meter.  Instead of crafting deft plot twists,
the film relies on random behavior and a confusing structure designed to
dole the story out in tiny bits over the entire running time.
     Why?  If they told it like it really was, you'd realize there
wasn't much of a movie here.  SIMPATICO is a very pretty film, and its
stars do as much as possible with their roles.  It's just that the roles
don't do much for them.

The fundamental requirement of a director is that his actors should
never appear to be such.  In SIMPATICO, based on a play by Sam Shepard,
director Matthew Warchus is never able to turn his talented cast into
anything approaching real characters.  The movie has many an interesting
vignette, but never do his actors become flesh-and-blood characters.
Instead, the actors strut their stuff and show off their craft but
nothing more.
Maybe it's because this play isn't suitable material for a motion
picture, or maybe it's because Warchus, whose background is as a stage
director, doesn't understand the needs of the cinema.  Whatever the
reason, SIMPATICO just limps tediously along until the ending credits
put it out of its misery.
The story revolves around a decades-old horse racing scam.  As a
Dumpster Dan of an alcoholic, Nick Nolte plays a loser named Vinnie.
Vinnie has the goods in the form of proof of the scam, which he uses to
harass his old co-conspirators.
As the wealthy, cigar-chomping Carter, Jeff Bridges plays a Kentucky
horse farm owner who's still scamming his way through life.  Sharon
Stone plays Carter's boozed up wife, Rosie.
Catherine Keener, who can playing working-class types better than just
about anyone, is Cecilia, a Payless store clerk, who is Vinnie's
girlfriend -- well, kind of.  Vinnie is such a filthy, no-account that
it's hard to see how anyone could tolerate him for more than a few
moments.  When pressed, she does admit to kissing him, but only once.
Completely wasted in the picture is Albert Finney as the race
commissioner who long ago was set up by Carter and Company.
The only modest tension in the film involves Carter's sale of a
soon-to-be-worthless race horse named Simpatico.  Lacking any sustained
momentum, the movie just ends.  Just before the ending, the story
interjects a completely predictable, but nevertheless ridiculous, little
melodrama.  It's the type of pseudo-tragedy that will leave you
murmuring to yourself, "Oh, come on!"
SIMPATICO runs 1:46.  It is rated R for some strong sexuality and for
language and would be acceptable for older teenagers.

        Academy AwardŽ Nominee Nick Nolte.  Academy AwardŽ Nominee Jeff
Bridges.  Academy AwardŽ Nominee Sharon Stone.  What the ads for
"Simpatico" seem to be telling us is that this latest screen adaptation of
a Sam Shepard play is populated by a cast of losers.
        For all the lack of statuettes on their mantels, however, the
problem with "Simpatico" isn't its cast.  The opportunity to see Nolte,
Bridges, and Stone working together is wonderful.  Having said that,
Stone's top billing is ludicrous given that she's essentially in only two
scenes.  One of these scenes requires her to Act, like Jessica Lange in a
Tennessee Williams potboiler--drinking, smoking, hanging around in a flimsy
bathrobe with bloodshot eyes, a gun, and a Southern drawl.  She does this
rather well.  The other scene requires her to ride a horse, the titular
Simpatico, in a fetching red raspberry dress.
        No, it's Shepard's play that's at the heart of the problem.
"Simpatico" might have worked well on the stage, engaging the viewer with
its volatile interactions set against the high-stakes world of the Kentucky
Derby, but it becomes convoluted and disengaging when opened up for the big
screen.  It's hard to follow what's going on, why Nolte's and Bridge's
characters are mysteriously morphing into one anothers over the course of
the picture, and what prompted British theater director Matthew Warchus to
make his screen directing debut with this particular piece.
        Nolte plays a Cucamonga bum (imagine "Down and Out in Beverly
Hills") first name Vinnie, Bridges is a wealthy Lexington thoroughbred
breeder last name Carter, and Stone is his emotionally bruised wife with
whom nobody appears to be sleeping.
        In their youth (via flashbacks), these three perpetrated a major
scam involving a duped horse and a racing commissioner, the fallout from
which begins to resurface as "Simpatico," the film, enters the starting
gate.  Said racing commissioner is sparingly portrayed by Albert Finney, an
Academy AwardŽ Winner at last!  He's credible, but the film's advertised
promise of Love, Betrayal, and Money is never fully realized.  There's
certainly no love to be found anywhere here; perhaps Intercourse,
Photographs, and Blackmail would have been more truthful a sell.
        Catherine Keener ("Being John Malkovich") does her
twitchy-American-female-version-of-Hugh-Grant thing again as an unlikely
Payless supermarket checkout gal.
        If the film's title sounds like the next Corona, it's not
inappropriate.  "Simpatico" comes wrapped in a fancy label--Nolte, Bridges,
Stone--but inside the product is flat and weak.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Matthew Warchus' directorial debut, which he adapted from a Sam Shepard
play, is a disappointing tale of corruption, blackmail, cover-ups, greed
and paranoia.  Simpatico also features a predictable Freaky Friday swap
of the two male sides of the film's boring love-triangle.  It's a
surprise to see a film like this get a limited December release because
it has absolutely no chance of walking off with nominations of any sort.
Simpatico is set just before Halloween and opens with a man taping up a
shoebox with curious vigor.  We learn that he is Vinnie (Nick Nolte,
Affliction), a crumpled mess of a drunk that has just been pinched for
allegedly harassing a woman.  Vinnie makes a collect call to his wealthy
friend Carter (Jeff Bridges, Arlington Road), grunting `They're gonna
make me talk!' into the phone.  We have no idea what this means, but
Carter quickly hops a plane from his beautiful home in Kentucky to head
for Vinnie's place in Cucamunga, California.  Carter's juice-head wife
Rosie (Sharon Stone, The Muse) stays behind, in a perpetual fog.
Carter's interest in protecting Vinnie is related directly to the
mysterious contents of the shoebox.  We learn that there is something
bad inside  most likely photos and letters  pertaining to the fixing
of a horse race from several years ago that left the three players
somewhat well off.  The history of Vinnie and Carter's relationship is
played out in a series of cool flashbacks that just reek of Lone Star,
with their younger roles played by Shawn Hatosy (Outside Providence),
Liam Waite and Kimberly Williams (relativity).  Paranoid that their
secret could potentially affect the $30 million sale of his Triple
Crown-winning horse Simpatico, Carter is tricked by a dodgy Vinnie, who
steals his pal's car, clothes and wallet and flies back to Kentucky,
leaving Carter to become a grubby, disheveled Oscar Madison to Vinnie's
Felix Unger.
I was expecting the shoebox to contain some really messed-up stuff and
was very unsatisfied once the contents were revealed.  The acting is
solid, especially from Albert Finney (Washington Square), who plays a
former horse-racing official with a dirty past.  Stone is perfectly
cast; her role most likely resembling her real life  drunk and hazy,
sleeping all day and having sex to get ahead (or, in last year's case,
to get a Golden Globe nomination).  Nolte and Bridges are, as usual,
reliable actors.  Catherine Keener (Being John Malkovich) contributes a
supporting role as the object of Vinnie's affection.
The picture looks fantastic, thanks to John Toll's (Braveheart, The Thin
Red Line) gloomy cinematography, and ex-Police drummer Stewart Copeland
provides a decent score.  But Simpatico never really gets off the
ground.  It's tough to feel anything for the characters and, with the
big surprise letdown, the ending is left terribly flat.  Warchus does
make effective use of the Alan Parsons Project song `Games People Play'
at the beginning and end of the film, but it's hardly enough to save the
picture.

Susan Granger's review of "SIMPATICO" (Fine Line Features)
        Jeff Bridges, Nick Nolte, Sharon Stone, and Albert Finney try
valiantly but even their compelling performances can't effectively
elevate this somber, slowly paced screen adaptation of Sam Shepard's
1994 play about friendship and betrayal set against the backdrop of
high-stakes horseracing. Written by David Nicholls and Matthew
Warchus, a British theatrical director who makes his debut as a screen
director, it's deeply symbolic, filled with bitter, rambling
ruminations about corruption. Jeff Bridges plays a multi-millionaire
horse-breeder in Lexington, Kentucky, who - in the midst of selling a
champion thoroughbred stallion named Simpatico - is interrupted by a
phone call from a boozy bar-fly, an old friend, Nick Nolte, who
threatens to expose a racetrack scam they pulled when they were young,
involving Bridges' now-dissolute, unhappy wife, Sharon Stone, and
Albert Finney, as a former horse-racing commissioner whom they
slandered and vilified. Catherine Keener (Being John Malkovich)
emerges as the most likable character, playing a supermarket check-out
clerk who serves as an awkward, reluctant intermediary between the
overwrought antagonists who share this gritty, guilty secret. There
are lots of flashbacks, skillfully integrated by editor Pascquale
Buba, in which Liam Waite, Shawn Hatosy and Kimberly Williams play the
trio of principals in the '70s, their ambitious, younger years. On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, Simpatico is a sly, melancholy,
bittersweet 6, revolving around vindi cation and vengeance.

Mathew Warchus's Simpatico is a realistic story of long-term guilt, 
deflected love, and puzzling role-reversal.  Unfortunately, it's also an 
exercise in ennui for the viewer.
Based on the play by Sam Shepard,  Simpatico starts by showing us the 
remains of the old friendship between Lyle Carter (Jeff Bridges) and Vinnie 
(Nick Nolte).  Vinnie calls Carter from a pay phone outside a Payless 
grocery store in California.  Carter, a millionaire horse breeder in 
Kentucky, drops his business and tells one of his secretaries to inform his 
wife he's leaving on important business.  While this plot is unfolding we 
view shots from twenty-odd years ago, of a young Vinnie and Carter 
celebrating a winner at the track.  We come to understand that it was this 
time of youth that generated the mistake the men are still regretting.  What 
we do know is that it involves photographs and their negatives, and that 
Vinnie offers to give them to Carter if Carter agrees to talk with Vinnie's 
girlfriend.
According to Vinnie, this woman (Cecilia, played by Catherine Keener) has 
filed harassment charges against him, and Carter's chore is to reason with 
her in an attempt to get the charges dropped.  This story is one of many 
lies, though, and while Carter is inside Cecilia'a apartment, Vinnie steals 
Carter's car and all of his things.  For some reason Carter has left his 
wallet in his car, but he does have his cell phone.
What follows is a story replete with the ramifications and wrong turns 
caused by youthful stupidity and middle-aged guilt.  In Kentucky, Vinnie 
visits the victim of the youthful scam, one Mr. Simms, whose name is now 
Ames (Albert Finney).  Meanwhile, Carter stays in Vinnie's hovel;  the best 
explanation we have that Carter doesn't fly back to his wife and mansion and 
soon-to-be-sold Triple Crown winner is that he likes the smell of alfalfa.  
He grew up in this area of California, and apparently decides to forsake the 
life of lies he has led.  Carter even dresses in Vinnie's clothes and visits 
the seedy bar Vinnie frequents.  It is an interesting switching of lives, 
though not quite plausible.
What happens with Cecilia?  It seems her relationship with Vinnie was only 
platonic anyway, but she ends up as Carter's agent, taking a lot of money to 
Simms/Ames in return for the negatives.  Later we meet Rosie (Sharon Stone), 
Carter's wife, who wonders why her husband isn't back home to celebrate the 
$30 million sale of Simpatico.  The staff of Carter's horse farm goes along 
with Carter's whim, covering for him, but what's a little shaky is that 
Carter seems serious in not returning to Kentucky.  There's an interesting 
scene between Vinnie and Rosie before Vinnie returns to California to find 
Carter, his doppelganger, crashed on the couch in a drunken heap.
What's very weird is that there is no actual scene between Carter and Rosie; 
  we see them talking on the phone and we see them as youths in the 
flashbacks.  Further, Vinnie and Cecilia never share a frame.  It is 
interesting, though, how we learn about them through their talk with others; 
but it is not very helpful in coaxing the viewers' sympathy.
The excellent cast all do a fine job.  Nolte has played this type of 
freeloader once too frequently, perhaps, but he is quite proficient.  It's 
fascinating trying to figure out his motivations.  Bridges also acts 
smoothly, though we are still not given adequate reason to believe he would 
forfeit his lifestyle so completely.  The surprise find here is Catherine 
Keener as the somewhat reserved Cecilia.  She acts off Bridges particularly 
well, stopping short of alarm at his odd antics.  Albert Finney is the only 
character to play himself in the flashbacks (the young Vinnie is Shawn 
Hatosy, the young Carter Liam Waite, the young Rosie Kimberly Williams).  As 
such, Finney does not visually convince us; and although he is among the 
very finest living actors, Finney's style is too inflated for the seedy 
tracer of equine bloodlines.  His Simms/Ames is lustful yet not quite 
despicable.
Mathew Warchus also penned the screenplay, and it seems at times that 
Shepard's lines still belong on the stage.  Some of the delivery is too 
portentous for the movies;  it's as if we need the in-person medium of live 
drama for the material to resonate properly.  The editing moves quickly 
enough through most of the narrative, and the flashbacks are nicely 
introduced - at times the older characters melt into their younger selves 
and we realize without obtrusive devices where we are.  But the flatness 
near the end results in a lack of satisfaction.
Simpatico is not a major work in the canon of modern film, but it is a 
strong study of the damage wrought by hidden secrets --  a theme not 
uncommon in the work of the actor/playwright Sam Shepard.  The film is rated 
R for language and glimpses of sordid sexuality.

   Just as the "in" thing to say is "the book is better than the
movie," the appropriate way to describe a movie that has
come out of a staged play is that they should have left it off-
Broadway where it belongs.  August Strindberg's "Miss Julie,"
David Mamet's "Oleanna," Paul Rudnick's "Jeffrey"--all have
been compromised or downright ruined by being "opened up"
on the big screen.  Not only do filmed plays look either
claustrophobic or artificially extended when put on the huge
silver screen: the language, which is usually the key attribute
of a staged work, gets lost.  Sam Shepard's play,
"Simpatico," is a good example of a work whose language
simply disperses into the alfalfa-perfumed air of Kentucky
where many of its scenes take place.
  Directed with a star-studded cast by Matthew Warchus--who
has done impressive work on Broadway with his Tony-
nominated hit "Art" and is known for solid work on London's
West End ("Falstaff," "Hamlet,")--Warchus is out of his
element with this rambling movie, whose rhythms and poetry
are squandered amid a convoluted tale.  Dealing with some
of Sam Shepard's favorite themes--the interior and exterior
landscapes of American society, the death or betrayal of the
American dream, the search for comfortable roots--
"Simpatico" takes a good deal of time to find its cadence,
leading the audience to wonder when some sense will be
made of its characters' feelings of alienation.  Flashing back
frequently to the more carefree, optimistic days of his
protagonists, Warchus unveils a story of youthful ideals and
limitless dreams, puncturing the illusions of two uninteresting
men and one bimbo-ish woman who pulled a scam that didn't
quite work out and who are haunted not only by memories
but by their current ties to the past.
   The movie opens on a shaggy Vinnie (Nick Nolte) who has
been leading a low-profile life in Cucamonga, California,
having been involved in a shady deal with his friend, Carter
(Jeff Bridges)--who is now a multimillionaire horse breeder in
Kentucky.  In a more carefree time they had been involved in
a racing scam involving the switching of slow, long-shot
horses by fast ones, and in blackmailing the racing
commissioner, Simms (Albert Finney), into silence.  But there
is no honor among these thieves.  Carter runs off with
Vinnie's wife Rosie (Sharon Stone), Simms takes on a new
identity with a new, satisfying career, and Carter is himself
blackmailed by Vinnie.  When Vinnie decides to come clean
and go public with evidence, Carter is drawn into an intricate
plot involving a naive supermarket checker, Cecilia (Catherine
Keener), who acts as liaison between Vinnie and Simms.
   Kimberly Williams, Liam Waite and Shawn Hatosy perform
in the roles of the young Rosie, Carter and Vinnie
respectively while Sharon Stone is wasted in a thankless role
of the unhappy, if fabulously rich, wife of Carter, lounging
about her estate like a torpid character out of Tennessee
Williams.  The most energetic performance comes from
Albert Finney, who has made lemonade from lemons by
performing in the role of a man who is now intensely involved
in a career tracing the bloodlines of horses.  Despite decent
performances from Nick Nolte and Jeff Bridges, who switch
roles before our eyes--the one lightening up graphically as he
shucks the albatross of his past criminal acts while the other
deteriorates into a paranoid scuzz--"Simpatico" barely leaves
the starting gate before it falters and bogs down like a
Central Park buggy horse pitted against Native Dancer.
Rated R.  Running Time: 106 minutes.  (C) 2000

     Sometimes, a play makes for a good film. Sometimes it doesn't. It's
tough to put a finger on what can make a stage-to-screen translation fall
flat, but I know it when I see it. Sometimes it feels as though a
filmmaker doesn't know how to make a set piece feel like a film; other
times the director seems to be doing little more than turning the film
over to the actors reciting their lines. A play turned into a film can
become AMADEUS, it's true. It can also become OLEANNA.
     SIMPATICO doesn't fail because director Matthew Warchus can't give
Sam Shepard's play a distinctly cinematic life (he does) or that he lets
the actors run roughshod over the production (he does that too, but it's
not the fatal flaw). In this case, the play itself is the thing. Jeff
Bridges stars as a successful horse breeder named Lyle Carter who is
preparing for his latest sale, a Triple Crown-winning stallion named
Simpatico. Unfortunately, Carter has a dark past that's about to come back
to haunt him in the form of old pal Vinnie Webb (Nick Nolte). Vinnie
claims to be in legal trouble in California, trouble that could also make
things uncomfortable for Carter. As the lives of the two men intertwine
again, we learn in flashback of a scheme that gained the young Carter
(Liam Waite), Vinnie (Shawn Hatosy) and Vinnie's girlfriend Rosie
(Kimberly Williams) a huge bankroll. It was also a scheme with plenty of
repercussions into the present, including changing the life of a one-time
racing commissioner named Simms (Albert Finney).
     Structurally, SIMPATICO is about as sound a script as they come. 
Revelations about the characters' pasts appear ever-so-gradually, each one
adding a shade of significance to events that have gone before. As a tale
of guilt and coming to terms with one's mistakes, it's intriguing enough
consistently enough that you'll want to keep paying attention. It even
offers some genuinely cinematic pleasures, from John Toll's eclectic
cinematography to Stewart Copeland's jangly soundtrack. Far from the
too-typical 1990s script of 1-2-3 plot development, SIMPATICO's story
clicks along with unique rhythms.
     Those rhythms just happen to be the rhythms of a play. No matter what
is happening on screen in SIMPATICO, it never for a moment feels like the
story belongs on film. The characters speak to each other in the clipped
tones of a dialogue-dependent medium, full of loaded pauses and oblique
references that should come with big glowing asterisks noting "Pay
attention, this will be important later." Sub-plots and character
developments are so fraught with significance -- Carter and Vinnie
slipping casually into one another's lives; a horse that's not what he
appears to be -- you can see the author nodding to himself at the
cleverness of it all. Even the actors generally look like they're playing
to the rafters, with Nick Nolte all a-growl as the seedy Vinnie and Albert
Finney telegraphing his character's unambiguous ambiguity (only Catherine
Keener, as a vaguely simple-minded woman unwitting involved in the story,
shows a welcome subtlety). By the time Sharon Stone blows into the film
from some community theater Tennessee Williams production to play Carter's
wife, it seems almost impossible that all this is transpiring on a movie
screen instead of live and in person.
     It should go without saying that striving for thematic depth and
complexity is not exclusive to the live theater, nor is a labyrinthine
plot unworkable on screen. There's simply a quality to SIMPATICO that
makes it feel grossly artificial as a film experience. It's easy to watch
the film and understand what would make this story a slick, atmospheric
character study as a play. As a film, however, it's inert, moving along so
deliberately you may begin to feel that you're watching a staged reading
committed to film. I don't know if someone could take Shepard's play and
make it a workable film, but I know this one isn't it. SIMPATICO may make
you want to go out and see it as a stage production ... unless, by the
conclusion, you feel that you already have.

        An affluent horse breeder's past comes up to haunt him; an
ages old cover-up and blackmail comes back to haunt him at the hands
of one of his accomplices. That's pretty much the essence of the movie
and I have to say that it becomes quite boring at times and is very
slow. That aside the story was well presented and probably quite close
and representative of its source. The acting in particular I found
very good, the character development was also quite interesting but
alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get
into the movie.  A few things about the story didn't sit very well
with me for example the original scam and cover-up heavily involved
the character played by Sharon Stone, yet in the end her character
played a relatively small role and it seems she should have been
utilized more to further the story along better. On the flip side the
character played by Catherine Keener I found to be very interesting
and I thought that it was developed very well and helped the story a
lot. The character's aside this movie had some interesting merits but
in the end it lacked in story and pacing. 
        As far as the acting and casting for this movie is concerned I
have to say that the choices of Nick Nolte and Jeff Bridges were great
as well as that of Catherine Keener. All these people acted their
parts admirably, as for the part that Sharon Stone played, she played
it well but the part was not utilized enough. 
        The directing for this movie is something that I have to
comment on because for once in a long while you see a director
actually add a very distinctive flavor to a movie, this is one of
those occasions. Matthew Warchus in my opinion added an interesting
touch and spin to the movie and I think he tackled a touch subject (I
myself wouldn't be able to look at horseracing and make a movie out of
it). There is a certain flavor about this movie and I think that the
direction of the movie is the reason for this. The one flaw that I do
have to comment on is the pacing, the subject matter in my opinion
wasn't interesting enough on its own to have this kind of flavoring
and directorial touch about it. I certainly hope that the director
makes more movies as this does show promise even if I myself don't
like it. 
        All in all I found this movie boring and very slow, the acting
was good but the story just didn't evolve enough and wasn't
captivating enough to make Simpatico an enjoyable movie to watch.
Although there is much going for the movie I didn't find it good even
though I see the merits and style used and can compliment the movie on
them. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but if you are a horse
fanatic or a racing fanatic then you will most likely enjoy this
movie.
