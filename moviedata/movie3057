There's a scene in this slow emotionally reserved film that well describes
how audiences may feel about it. Christopher Walken (who's wonderful) has
been prompted via financial desperation and a small group of slimy
near-do-poorlies to come out of "normal life" and start cracking safes
again. In this particular scene, Walken is practicing on a few combination
locks while the group looks on.
Now, one might ask themselves, "Why are they watching him so intent, neatly
seated?" Ironically, this is the same question I asked of myself about the
film. And why does he want them to watch him? Again, what has the filmmaker
here for me to see (other than a good performance by Walken)? And in their
one last appreciation for my condition, the three thugs, initially excited
about seeing this man open locks ... fall asleep all over each other.
The film opens slowly while introducing us to the characters in the first
third. The second third, picks up the pace to leisurely at best. And just
when a shimmer of anticipation sparks interest, offering a ray of hope that
the pace will finally click into gear, the third third is completely absent.
There's nothing else overly incompetent about the picture. In fact, the
dialogue is quite strong, acting creditable and cinematography fine to
midland - it's just the pace and point.
One viewer who found the film interesting enough, still commented, "If I
were going to give this film a grade, it'd have to be an incomplete."

As we all know, crime doesn't pay.  But in THE OPPORTUNISTS it is the 
lack of crime that's infuriating.  Directed on snooze control by Myles 
Connell, who also penned the underwritten script, the movie is s-l-o-w.  
When, in the last act, the big heist finally gets underway, it is almost 
enough to rouse the now sleepy audience.  Although it's a short movie, 
five minutes of it feels like an eternity.
The severe pacing problems and the lack of character depth are a shame 
since the cast does their best within the confines of their poorly 
developed roles.  Poignancy seems always just around the corner.  The 
movie constantly appears ready to take off, but it is rarely able to 
start its engines.  Like an old biplane stuck on a runway, the rickety 
old plane elicits our sympathy, but we quickly tire of watching it just 
taxi around.
The film's star, Christopher Walken, plays a lovable loser named Vic 
Kelly.  An ex-con who has long since gone straight, Vic tries to make a 
living by repairing cars.  Not exactly a successful small business 
owner, he bounces checks wherever he goes.  Wait until tomorrow to cash 
them is his advice to those to whom he writes the checks.  Maybe, by 
tomorrow, he'll have figured out a way to come up with the funds.  Or, 
then again, maybe not.
One day, an unknown cousin from Ireland, Michael (Peter McDonald), comes 
for a visit.  Penniless, Michael encourages Vic to pull off the 
"fool-proof" burglary scheme of two of Vic's friends, Pat Duffy (Donal 
Logue) and Jesus Del Toro (Josй Zъсiga).
Watching THE OPPORTUNISTS finally come into focus is like staring at a 
picture being downloaded over a slow modem link.  Even if you admire the 
image, the sluggishness of the speed eventually becomes mind-numbing.
THE OPPORTUNISTS runs 1:29.  It is rated R for language, but with the 
exception of a few mildly-delivered F-words, the film would be PG, not 
even PG-13.  Unlike some recent questionable PG-13 movies, such as NUTTY 
PROFESSOR II, which would be inappropriate for those under 14, THE 
OPPORTUNISTS would be acceptable for most kids 10 and up.

   What do mayors of New York City, the Apple's yuppies,
and Gotham tourists from the world over have in common? 
Simple.  They rarely if ever go to the outer boroughs.  New
York City means Manhattan, and even then, only that island's
stretch from the Battery to Ninety-Sixth Street.  Everywhere
else is the boonies.  To paraphrase the old song, how ya
gonna keep them up in the Bronx, after they've seen Macy's?
   Can you blame them?  Yes, but only in part. After all, while
Staten Island may have a unique Tibetan museum, the Bronx
a nationally famous zoological garden and Brooklyn the
inimitable view of the skyline at the Heights promenade,
there's only place to go for Broadway shows, slick hotels,
clean streets and dazzling shops.  On the other hand, while
Manhattan may have its fascinating ethnic conclaves like
Chinatown, Little Italy and Little Spain, a visit to
neighborhoods in Queens will open tourists to the way real
people live, people who crunch motor engines but not
numbers and bars whose tenders know thankfully little about
white wine spritzers and five-dollar bottles of Perrier.  First-
time director, Dublin-born Myles Connell, takes us to such a
neighborhood with his character-driven movie about plain,
basically good, hard-working people in the little-known vicinity
of Sunnyside, Queens, one of whom has been twice driven to
crime because he's down on his luck and wants to do good
by his family.  "The Opportunists" is the diametrical opposite
of slick, commercial films portraying smooth and articulate
robbers who have no identity other than the schematics of
the plot.  Because the noirish feature, developed at the
Sundance Film Makers lab in 1995, has few ups and downs
but moves ahead slowly, deliberately, with an emphasis on
exploring the dimensions of its players, "The Opportunists" is
not for everyone but for those who can appreciate a sincere,
attentive, superbly cast film. This indie is a good example of
the delights that small movies have over the likes of "M:I-2"
and "Pulp Fiction."
   As Vic Kelly (Christopher Walken) tells us early on, he did
serve time for a botched bit of safecracking but gave back
the take not really because his generosity reduced his
sentence but because after his wife left him, "I had no one to
spend the money on."  In other words, Connell introduces us
to a real family man, the converse of your common mugger
whose family life runs the gamut from dysfunctional to non-
existent.  He lives with his 20-something daughter, Miriam
(Vera Farmiga) and enjoys the affection of Sally (Cyndi
Lauper), who runs the neighborhood bar, but when he meets
up with an uninvited guest who is allegedly a relative back in
Ireland (Michael Lawler played by the raffish Peter
McDonald), he sees a way of picking himself out of a
mountain of debt.
   While the actual safecracking gives us the movie's only
moments of traditional suspense, the real achievement of this
picture is Connell's carefully drawn portrayal of a group of
eccentric characters, people who will convince skeptics that
outer-borough folks of similar ethnic and working-class
background are not all alike.  Tom Noonan, who was so
wonderful in the thoroughly human drama of dating, "What
Happened Was..." virtually steals the show as a shady
locksmith, while Christopher Walken proves that he can be as
vulnerable and compassionate in his quirky role as he was
barbarous in "Sleepy Hollow."  Adding special texture are
Anne Pitoniak as Vic's crabby aunt and Peter McDonald as
the wide-eyed Dubliner whose fantasy about a great
safecracker proves both correct and inaccurate.
Rated R.  Running time: 89 minutes.  (C) 2000 by

OPPORTUNISTS, THE (director/writer: Myles Connell; cinematographer: Teo
Maniaci; editor: Andy Kier; cast: Christopher Walken (Victor Kelly),
Peter McDonald (Michael Lawler), Cyndi Lauper (Sally Mahon), Vera
Farmiga (Miriam Kelly), Donal Logue (Pat Duffy), Jose Zuniga (Jesus Del
Toro), Tom Noonan (Mort Stein), Olek Krupa (Ted Walikaki), Anne Pitoniak
(Aunt Diedre), Kate Burton (Rest Home Sister); Runtime: 89; First Look

Christopher Walken does his regular-guy bit as Vic Kelly, a reformed
safecracker who can't make a go of it as a regular citizen since doing
prison time for a previous crime, in Myles Connell's gentle heist flick.
Vic's car repair shop is failing and he has trouble with various bills,
which include paying rent on his modest Sunnyside, Queens house, in the
working-class neighborhood where he lives with his grown-up daughter
Miriam (Vera Farmiga), and he also can't pay the charge for keeping his
elderly aunt (Anne Pitoniak) in a nearby private Catholic nursing home.
Vic's dilemma is that he is indecisive about things, such as choosing
between what is right and what is criminal.
Opportunity comes knocking on his door when an acquaintance named Pat
(Donal Logue) tries to get him to rob the security firm he is working
at, with his security guard partner Jesus (Jose Zuniga) in on the inside
job, promising Vic that his boss can't report the crime because it is
undisclosed money that he keeps in the safe. When he can't talk Vic into
doing the heist, he gets the help of a young man called Mike (Peter
McDonald), who suddenly shows up on Vic's door and says he's from
Ireland and is Uncle Frank's son. Vic reluctantly gives him shelter in a
mobile camper parked in his garage area, whereby Mike gets a chance to
talk with Pat and they scheme to make sure Vic is in further need of
money, as the Buick Riviera Vic is fixing up for a cop, is sabotaged, so
when the cop comes to pick up the car, smoke is coming out of the
engine, thereby he refuses to pay for the car. Vic was counting on the
money to pay off his debts.
Vic shows that he's an honorable guy, when he refuses to borrow the two
thousand dollar loan his long-time girlfriend Sally (Cyndi Lauper)
offers him, telling her she needs it for renovations of the neighborhood
bar she owns. She offers him the loan because she is afraid he will do
something foolish and be sent upstate again, and he is afraid of losing
her if she knows he is going back into safe-cracking.
The first-time director does a great job of establishing character in
this ensemble production and fully catches the rigors of a working-class
milieu, also catching the need for dignity Walken has and how the other
characters bounce off his understated performance to complement it with
their own particular tics. Peter McDonald is filled with blarney and a
boyish rashness, not quite the professional criminal, someone easily
distracted from his purposes, who has his eyes open wide for Vic's
attractive daughter and who can't keep his eyes off a pinball machine he
sees when robbing a house, thereby stepping on the pet dogs squeaky toy,
waking up the house and foiling the robbery attempt. Donal Logue seems
like he's a real guy from the neighborhood, his performance was so real
it didn't seem like it was a performance. Vera Farmiga is as sweet as
pie and seemed a natural as the caring daughter. Tom Noonan adds spark
in a quirky performance as a veteran criminal, a former partner of
Vic's, with no pretenses to dressing for style, as he is paid for his
knowledge and to get Vic the supplies to do the safe-cracking job.
What's there not to like about this robbery! It is hard for the audience
to not root for them to succeed in this victimless caper. It is a film
with limited aims, but it has a certain friendliness and charm to it,
that credit must go in no small measure to the fine cast and the good
eye the director has for what a real neighborhood is like and how
working-class people feel. There is a certain grace to this movie, that
I think Jean-Pierre Melville would have attested to and welcomed Walken
into his noir films, as someone Bob the Gambler would have taken a shine
to.

boyish rashness, not quite the professional criminal, someone easily distracted
from his purposes, who has his eyes open wide for Vic's attractive daughter
and who can't keep his eyes off a pinball machine he sees when robbing
a house, thereby stepping on the pet dogs squeaky toy, waking up the house
and foiling the robbery attempt. Donal Logue seems like he's a real guy
from the neighborhood, his performance was so real it didn't seem like
it was a performance. Vera Farmiga is as sweet as pie and seemed a natural
as the caring daughter. Tom Noonan adds spark in a quirky performance as
a veteran criminal, a former partner of Vic's, with no pretenses to dressing
for style, as he is paid for his knowledge and to get Vic the supplies
to do the safe-cracking job.

What's there not to like about this robbery! It is hard for the audience
to not root for them to succeed in this victimless caper. It is a film
with limited aims, but it has a certain friendliness and charm to it, that
credit must go in no small measure to the fine cast and the good eye the
director has for what a real neighborhood is like and how working-class
people feel. There is a certain grace to this movie, that I think Jean-Pierre
Melville would have attested to and welcomed Walken into his noir films,
as someone Bob the Gambler would have taken a shine to.

Vic Kelly (Christopher Walken) is a responsible, honest, hard working man. In
his past life he did time for robbery and wants only to pull together his tiny,
fractured family. But, his auto mechanic business is not as lucrative or easy
as thieving and his debts are piling up. Vic decides to risk one more heist - 
the Big One - in "The Opportunists."
Vic's decision to go back to the old ways is not lightly made. His stint in the
slammer caused his family to break up and go their separate ways. Since he got
out, he's tried to go the straight and narrow, but, as Vic tells his patient
girlfriend Sally Mahon (Cyndi Lauper), "The regular citizen thing wasn't
working out too well." He has been trying to rebuild his estranged relationship 
with his daughter Miriam (Vera Farmiga) and foots the cost of keeping his aged 
Aunt Diedre (Anne Pitoniak) in an expensive nursing home. But, his checks are
bouncing left and right, he's in danger of losing his business and the nuns at
the nursing home are threatening to ship Aunt Dee off to Staten Island.
Life is tough for the ex-con and he's pretty vulnerable when he is approached
by Pat Duffy (Donal Logue), a security guard at a small armored car business. 
Pat tells Vic that the owner regularly skims cash from his customer accounts 
and has two big bags of illicit funds just waiting to be taken. Sally had 
repeatedly offered to lend him the money to get back on his feet, but the 
proud Vic won't accept the heartfelt offer of help. The die is finally cast 
when Vic tells Pat, "I'll check it out."
Meanwhile, a young man enters Vic's life. Mike (Peter McDonald) is just off the
plane from Ireland and tells Vic that they are cousins. The cautious Vic trusts
no one and keeps the young man at arm's length. Mike works his way into the
older man's familial affection and gets to go along on the job. Things go off
with perfect timing until Mike blunders and puts Vic in certain danger of being
caught. The inept Mike panics and runs away, leaving Vic to suffer the
consequences.
"The Opportunists" has to be the most subdued performance to date for
Christopher Walken. The actor is renown for his incredible intensity in such 
films as "The Deer Hunter" and "Prophesy." Here, as the put upon Vic, he is a 
working class guy who screwed his life up royally and now just wants a break. 
As his bank bounces his checks, Vic desperately scrabbles to pay the bills 
legitimately, but can't. The promise of easy money is too great a temptation 
as Vic makes the fateful decision to cross back across the line to a
life of crime.  
As portrayed by Walken, Vic is a victim of his own making, though you feel bad
when things go wrong for the man and glad when things go right. It's a strong,
subtle performance for the actor who is required, unfortunately, to carry most 
of the film himself.
There are some real problems with the movie that even Christopher Walken can't
help.  The screenplay by first-time helmer Myles Connell is so reality-based in 
its slice of life view of its Queens NY locale that it never really builds a 
compelling story about its main character. There is no real drama in Vic's 
story of loss of faith and his final redemption.  Sure, you feel good when Vic 
gets out of his jam, but, I wasn't satisfied by the author's overall tale or 
many of his characters. It's a blue-collar story about an average guy with
money problems at its core.
Another problem is co-star Peter McDonald. The newcomer from Ireland is
passive, at best, as Michael. He is portraying a young man who comes to America 
to bask in the fame of Vic, who is a legend in the old country for his career 
in robbery. Unfortunately, McDonald gives no life to his performance and walks 
through the role with little emotion or character development. The sullen, 
confused Michael seems to be merely a device to screw things up for Vic when 
the thief makes his fateful decision to return to a life of crime.
Of the supporting cast only Lauper, as Sally, and Tom Noonan ("What Happened
Was..."), as Mort Stein, Vic's safe-cracking mentor/trainer, are able to push 
themselves free of the mundane script. Cyndi Lauper, not known for her dramatic 
perfs, takes on the tough role of the loyal, supportive girlfriend and breaths 
life into her Sally. Sally may love Vic, but she isn't stupid. She'll go along 
with Vic's prideful stubbornness up to a point, but cuts him loose when he 
crosses back into the life of crime. Noonan gets to play up the quirky,
paranoid Mort, who agrees to help Vic, for a price, to crack the company safe
in under six minutes.  Another fresh face, Vera Farmiga ("Return to Paradise"), 
plays Vic's daughter, Miriam, and the newcomer gets to create a little bit of 
presence as Michael's budding love interest. She tries, but there is no 
chemistry between the two thespians.
The Queens locations lend to the blue-collar look of the film and photographer
Teo Maniaci enhances the working class environs where Vic lives and works.
Other techs are straightforward but not notable.
Christopher Walken is an under-appreciated actor who isn't usually given the
star role in a film. He gives himself over to his character study of Vic and
the veteran thesp gives a solid perf. Too bad the screenplay isn't in the same
league as Walken. I give "The Opportunists" a C.

The Opportunists
A film review by Robert Marley - Copyright Š 2000 filmcritic.com
Christopher Walken is a great choice to work with any first-time
director/screenwriter, as he can "sell" any character put in front of
him. From a sword-swinging headless horseman in Tim Burton's Sleepy
Hollow to a wristwatch smuggling Air Force Captain in Tarentino's Pulp
Fiction, Walken breathes an air of believability into any persona, which
is hardly something that every actor can do. Because of this, the films
he is in always seem to be at the very least entertaining, and The
Opportunists is no exception to the rule. Set against the backdrop of
the Sunnyside, Queens neighborhood of New York, The Opportunists is the
story of a man who can't seem to do the right thing, no matter how hard
he tries.
Walken plays Victor Kelly, an ex-con turned auto mechanic struggling to
be a responsible man, earning an honest living in the hopes of redeeming
himself for the lifetime of trouble he has brought down on his small,
fractured family. Add to the mix a young man named Michael (Peter
McDonald) who appears at his doorstep, claiming to be a cousin from
Ireland. Ironically, Michael has come to America to learn from the man
he believes is a successful mobster - as legend back home tells it. What
he actually finds in Vic is completely different. Vic is a proud man
with some heavy financial headaches. Too bullheaded to accept help from
his girlfriend (Cyndi Lauper). Vic soon realizes his skills as a
mechanic are not nearly as marketable as his safe-cracking skills, and
he reluctantly finds himself risking everything for one last shot to
save his business and his family.
The Opportunists is the feature debut of Irish-born director Myles
Connell, whose only other work appears to be an episode of Homicide:
Life on the Street. Connell sold the idea to producers John Lyons and
Tim Perell at the Sundance film festival and has done a good job of
penning the script. All the characters seem real, not comical for the
sake of levity, not two-dimensional for the sake of clarity, but
believable for the sake of the story. And for that, Connell should be
commended for a great first effort.
While the pacing of the film seems a bit slow (which is odd, considering
the movie is only 90 minutes long) the story being told is fresh enough
to keep you in your seat and interested in what is going on on-screen.
Of particular note, Cyndi Lauper does surprisingly well opposite Walken,
which helps add to the overall believability of the picture. Fresh and
entertaining, The Opportunists is a tribute to flawed but worthy men
everywhere.
