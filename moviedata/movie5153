Mr. Bryan Frankenseuss Theiss
  In the quasi-biblical prologue to the new Muppet film, Muppets From Space,
the great Gonzo shows up just in time to be rejected from Noah's ark. He
doesn't know what species he is, and he doesn't have a female counterpart, and
basically, he's screwed. Now, one of the many important theories that I have
introduced to the field of film studies is the Puppet Rule of Comedy, which
states that some things are automatically funny as all hell when done by
puppets. One example is in Bride of Chucky, when Chucky and Tiffany make out in
front of a fireplace. Another example is in Muppets From Space, when the Old
Testament Gonzo flings his arms to the heavens and screams "Nooooooo!!!" 
  This sequence sets up a joke I will not give away, which involves Noah being
a cold hearted bastard. Watching this unfold I thought, "Good god, this is
going to be the subversive Muppet movie." But that initial impression was
wrong. The real purpose of this film is indicated quite bluntly by the next
scene, in which the entire cast of Muppets gets up in the morning and gets
ready for the day to the tune of the funk anthem "Brick House." That's right -
Muppets From Space is the funky Muppet movie.
  In an elaborate series of puppet tricks and sight gags that includes Animal
seemingly about to take a piss only to bathe himself in a toilet, the Muppets
get all the way live, get their groove on and - shit, god damn - they get off
their asses and jam. As the vocals kick in with "She was a brick - house" Miss
Piggy steps onto the screen, sporting a modern do that, if it weren't on a foam
rubber pig, might look kinda fly. I don't know. The storyline is set in motion,
the characters are introduced and they all stay on beat. You might find
yourself nodding your head or maybe shaking your elbows a little bit.
   Unfortunately, the movie doesn't maintain this kind of energy throughout. On
the other hand, it does keep the funk anthems coming, from "Get Up Off Of That
Thang" to "It's Your Thang" to "Shining Star" (both the original and a remix by
those master architects of Paul's Boutique, the Dust Brothers).
  The actual storyline does not involve funk, but rather a Close
Encounters-like quest for Gonzo to reunite with his newly discovered alien
ancestors. They send him messages in his breakfast and strike him with
lightning, and he and various human weirdos converge on the agreed upon
coordinates for an alien encounter that, of course, involves a popular Kool and
the Gang song.
  The story isn't very strong. The original Muppet Movie is a classic largely
because you can tell that Jim Henson and his collaborators passionately
believed in their message. They really were thrilled to pieces to be pursuing a
dream with their friends, and though the movie is dripping with cornball
sentiment it never once feels false. It's the real thing, and it makes my eyes
tear up a little every time I see the ceiling inside the soundstage rip open to
reveal the real sky - "Life's like a movie, write your own ending, keep
believing, keep pretending, we've done just what we set out to doooooo" 
  Subsequent Muppet movies, including the new one, don't come close to
duplicating this kind of enormous and overpowering warmth, so you don't really
believe in the stories. You don't care about Gonzo's quest the way you did
about Kermit's, and the villains along the way aren't as amusing - Jeffrey
Tambor doesn't work as well as a hammy main villain as he does with the dumb
sidekick roles he is known for. There are some enjoyably hokey (but weakly
executed) cameos and a good share of funny jokes, but the movie sags in the
middle. Kermit and Fozzy aren't given a whole lot to do, and Gonzo isn't as
funny when he's being sweet and sad as we remember him when he was a crazy
stuntman high on his own showmanship.
  On the other hand, there's a really good balance between old and new Muppets.
The filmmakers make good use of characters from the short lived mid '90s Muppet
Show revival, Muppets Tonight. The George Clinton-looking Clifford makes an
appearance, and there's a very funny cameo by the Italian lounge singer who's
name escapes me and his chimpanzee pal Sal. One of the best puppets is another
Muppets Tonight character, Bobo the bear, who portrays Jeffrey Tambor's
assistant Rentro. Everyone else plays themselves, which is a step in the right
direction. Recent Muppet movies, in which the Muppets acted out stories like
Treasure Island, didn't seem to work as well as the first three Muppet movies.
  The character who steals the show is Pepe, a heavily accented fluffy orange
thing who Miss Piggy calls a shrimp but who refers to himself as a king prawn.
He's another character from Muppets Tonight, and I hope we'll be seeing more of
him. 
  In fact, Pepe is crucial because he's the character who gets most deep into
the funk. During the end credits, we hear him board the Mothership to team up
with George Clinton for a remake of Parliament's "Flashlight." The dense
keyboard grooves aren't quite as slippery-slick this time around, and without
as much backing, it's clear how much more strained Clinton's voice is now than
it was in his youth. But this is still a song that can force you to dance, and
it's funny as hell to hear Dr. Funkenstein interacting with this goofy prawn.
And that in itself pretty much sums up the movie.

Sometimes franchises just lose their appeal.  Other times, the concept
is still viable but the material isn't worthy of them.
For whatever reason, the latest Muppet movie, MUPPETS FROM SPACE, isn't
the least bit funny.  The old Muppet magic, seen in abundance in their
last movie, MUPPET TREASURE ISLAND, is gone.  Like a chef who has lost
the recipe to his signature entrée, long-time Muppet screenwriter Jerry
Juhl (along with Joey Mazzarino and Ken Kaufman) has trouble fashioning
a single memorable moment this time.
It all starts out when Gonzo (Dave Goelz) gets a message in his Kap'n
Alphabet cereal.  "Watch the sky," the little colored cereal bits spell
out for him.  Soon other places in the world from the Pyramids to
Stonehenge are getting the message: "R U THERE" emblazed on them.  Even
the famous Hollywood sign turns into a misspelled variation, "R U
THREE."
After Gonzo is hit by lightning, or perhaps it was a spaceship beam, he
decides he has alien links.  Two guys dressed like characters from MEN
IN BLACK show up claiming to be members of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Aliens.  Actually, they want to whisk him away
to a secret government agency that is investigating extraterrestrial
life.  Once there, he and his gang are chased by men with guns.
Ever on the prowl for something to laugh at in relatively humorless
comedies, I was able to find little this time.  Perhaps the closest to
an amusing line comes from Rizzo the Rat (Steve Whitmire) when he is
afraid.  "I never disobeyed my mother, and I never carried the plague,
even once," he claims, as his eyes look to the heavens.
The best that can be said of the movie is that it is so inoffensively
bland that families need not worry about the ages of their kids.  Anyone
can see the movie, but many are going to be disappointed.
MUPPETS FROM SPACE runs a mercifully short 1:27.  It is rated G and
would be acceptable for all ages.
My son Jeffrey, age 10, hated the movie, giving it just 1/2 of a star.
He thought it was "dumb, dumb, and dumber" and never funny.  His friend
Nickolas, age 10, thought it was pretty funny, except for the ending,
and gave it ***.  His friend Alan, age 10, loved it and gave it ****,
finding it hilarious.

Gonzo for Gonzo? Then you'll absolutely adore "Muppets From Space," this
decade's third film featuring Jim Henson's infamously accessible and
diverse puppet troupe. But unlike 1992's "The Muppet Christmas Carol" or
1996's "Muppet Treasure Island," both of which felt forced in their
attempts to mix classic lit with mad Muppet sensibilities, "Space" cooks
up a brand new - and totally timely - premise for our favorite felt
friends to joke, mug and flail their way through. It's a worthy
successor to 1979's "The Muppet Movie," 1981's "The Great Muppet Caper"
and 1985's "The Muppets Take Manhattan."
As for that blue, furry, hook-nosed whatchamacallit called Gonzo,
admiring him is mandatory in enjoying this "Space" trip. He - not
Kermit, not Miss Piggy - gets the lead role here, his dilemma grabbing
the spotlight following a rousing, if out-of-nowhere, opening production
number set to the still-hip '70s staple "Brick House." Seems Gonzo,
suffering from a huge identity crisis, has been overcome with a question
that's also been haunting fans for quite some time: We know Rolf's a
dog, Fozzie's a bear and Sam's an eagle, but into what genus and species
does the G-man fall? A word of advice: Don't think too hard about the
title if you'd like to keep all the related revelations a surprise.
His quest for answers takes him and his Muppet pals through their
patented mix of physical comedy, surprise celebrity cameos (like David
Arquette as a mad scientist) and pop culture spoofs galore. Streetwise
Rizzo the Rat, Gonzo's right-hand rodent, tags along as usual, providing
an amusingly sarcastic counterpoint to his frazzled friend's neurotic
natterings. Crave new territory? A few neophyte characters receive
memorable debuts, including affable grizzly Bobo, a distressingly Andy
Warhol-esque butler and a Latino shrimp named Pepe who makes up for his
diminutive size with an abundance of sharp barbs.
Predictably, the lone main non-Muppet player - Jeffery Tambor's hammy
villain, a shady type out to cage Gonzo for government purposes - is a
snooze. And most non-Gonzo old favorites get relegated to supporting
subplots, which is the case with one-time Muppet ringleader Kermit and
spotlight-hogger Miss Piggy. But the background suits them fine for at
least this endeavor. "Muppets From Space" creates such a lively,
diverting atmosphere that this potentially faulty switcheroo registers
only in afterthought. Any film that pulls off a
worth-the-price-of-admission "Dawson's Creek" jab, a Piggy-MacDowell
catfight and yet another big musical showstopper in the same 10 minutes
can't be too dull.
With a fine balance between mirth and message and relatively few lulls
hampering viewer merriment, kids will identify with the alienation
themes and relish the silly slapstick while adults are kept amused by
parodies of classic sci-fi and the suspicious mentality of the "X-Files"
'90s. This means that "Muppets From Space" is truly a family film that
fits the classic - but typically over-applied - commendation: Young and
old can enjoy it together. Except for those crass, curmudgeonly seniors
Statler and Waldorf. They'll heckle anything. Maybe a Muppet retirement
community should be in their future.

"'20 Dates' tells the story of Myles Berkowitz, a man who wants to make
a film, and to fall in love. These areas are his two greatest failures,
professional and personal,' so he decides to make a film about going out
on 20 dates. By the film's end, he has won the love of the lovely
Elisabeth - maybe - but his professional life is obviously still a
failure." -Roger Ebert on "20 Dates"

When Jim Henson passed away in 1990, many of his fans doubted that the
Muppet franchise would carry on with the same wonder previously seen in some
of the most ingenious outings such as 'The Muppet Movie' (1979), 'The Great
Muppet Caper' (1981) and The Muppets Take Manhattan' (1984).  Steve Whitmire
does an incredible job of performing the voice of Kermit the Frog in the
same unique and memorable fashion of Henson himself.  Frank Oz and Dave
Goelz also contribute greatly to the icon voices of Miss Piggy and Gonzo.
The Muppet franchise seems to have survived but not with the same wonder and
amazement of the early years but its nice to see them try and provide
wholesome and quality entertainment for today's children.
The story of 'Muppets From Space' centres around Gonzo.  He's always been a
unique character and we find out that his roots come from another world and
that he himself is an alien and his people want to come and take him back in
a similar style seen in 'E.T.'  All of your favourite Muppet characters,
including Gonzo, Kermit, Miss Piggy, Rizzo the Rat, and others, all live
together in the same house.  It's a zoo (no pun intended) as they all fight
for bathroom time, a place at the breakfast table and room to movie about.
It's cute and harmless fun that in many cases is meant only for extremely
young children.  Older kids and adults especially may find the entire film
very boring at times and many of the characters aren't given the exposure I
would like to have seen.  That's one thing I always enjoyed about the old
television show.  There would be a segment giving everyone equal time and
everyone received their equal share of the pie.  In this one, you only end
up saying: "There's Fozzy", "There's Beaker", "There's Rolph", but we don't
see enough of them.
As Gonzo is discovered to be an alien, he is captured by a secret government
laboratory who want to experiment on him and it's up to the rest of the
Muppets to rescue him.  The whole thing is done in the most campy style
imaginable.  There is a spray carried by Miss Piggy where she can use it on
anyone and they're hypnotized into doing whatever she says and they all
carry a formula that will make them invisible.  It was nice, however, to see
the adult characters, such as Ray Liotta, Andie McDowall, Jeffrey Tambor, F.
Murray Abraham, Rob Schneider and the laughable Hulk or Hollywood Hogan,
whatever he's called these days, take a back seat to the Muppets and not
over shadow their presence.
Director Tim Hill and writers Jerry Juhl and Joseph Mazzarino have made a
film that looks more like television than the movies but considering that's
where the Muppets roots are, that isn't such a bad thing.  I just wanted to
see a less pretentious climax and more zest this time around that was
missing most of the way.

     It's easy enough to adopt the head-shaking perspective that the
Muppets just ain't what they used to be.  Certainly the death of Jim
Henson left a void in the Muppet universe, but it's only fitting that the
show has gone on.  "The Muppet Show's" setting as an old-time vaudeville
revue wasn't just a goofy conceit; it exemplified the whole Muppet
philosophy.  Sure, the scattershot jokes and variety numbers could be
groaners, but they were delivered with such a pure desire to please that
it almost didn't matter.  The Muppets were -- and continue to be --
entertainment from a bygone era, where you rarely had to target kids
exclusively because virtually all entertainment was "family
entertainment."
     MUPPETS FROM SPACE is a broad, silly, fairly charming piece of Muppet
capering based on a 20-year-old running gag:  exactly what is Gonzo (Dave
Goelz) anyway?  Stepping away from their recent literary adaptations, the
Muppets are cast as themselves, living together in one big house.  Though
they appear to be a happy felt-headed family, Gonzo still feels isolated
by his singularity.  A possible answer comes to him in the form of a
message from his alphabet breakfast cereal, leading Gonzo to the
conclusion that he is a refugee from an alien race.  This development
grabs the attention of government operative K. Edgard Singer (Jeffrey
Tambor), who intends to use Gonzo as proof of his theory that we are not
alone.
     The premise sets up jokes targeted at just about every "aliens among
us" movie of the last 25 years.  A woman shows up with a mashed potato
sculpture of Gonzo a la CLOSE ENCOUNTERS; the Muppets encounter some
star-cameo Men in Black, including "SportsNight's" Josh Charles and
wrestler Hollywood Hulk Hogan; a scene at a laboratory window recalls
INDEPENDENCE DAY.  There's even a swing into the unexpected territory of
THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, as imprisoned rat Rizzo (Steve Whitmire) escapes
through a hole hidden behind a "Mice Girls" poster.  Sly pop culture
references and slapstick carry most of the humor, but there's also the
simple pleasure of the company of familiar characters.  When Kermit,
Fozzie and Miss Piggy lead a mission to rescue Gonzo, the history of those
characters somehow makes every simple joke that much funnier.
     It's also true that MUPPETS FROM SPACE has an inconsistent tone and 
a higher-than-usual ratio of duds to chuckles.  Several cameo appearances
fall flat, including David Arquette as a crazed scientist and F. Murray
Abraham as a dream-sequence Noah.  The use of a musical score full of 70s
soul classics like "Brick House" and "Celebration" feels forced, since the
Muppets are anything but funky.  And as hard as the post-Henson Muppet
gang has worked to make Gonzo the new protagonist, he just doesn't have
the warmth and appeal of Kermit, who's now relegated to a sort of elder
statesman role.  MUPPETS FROM SPACE can keep you smiling, but it rarely
hits the high points of classic anarchic Muppet wit.
     Still, there's enough subtly subversive humor in MUPPETS FROM SPACE
-- as well as enough wild sight gags -- to make you glad the Muppets are
still around.  The film's best, most cultural crusader-unfriendly joke
finds Gonzo admitting to his pals that "I guess I've always had alien
tendencies...this just seems natural to me."  Those who have fretted for
years that Bert and Ernie were actually lovers may furrow their brows at
such alternative lifestyle innuendo, but it's a perfect nod to the kind of
unconventional family the Muppets have always been.  Then again, that's
the kind of bond theater people often form, and the Muppets are nothing if
not true theater people.  Okay, not _people_ exactly...just entertainers
who remind you that it's a good thing for the show to go on.

Once again, the Muppets feel the need to invade cinema screens once more.
After the mediocre Muppet Christmas Carol (I have yet to see Muppet Treasure
Island) the Muppet formula seemed to be getting a little stale. I was
therefore hoping that Muppets from Space, their latest outing, would be a
refreshed Muppet's for the millennium. Unfortunately, it's the same old
Muppet's we've known from the seventies. Granted, the routing is very funny
for thirty minute shows, but for the big screen the Muppet's should really
broaden their horizons.
The plot centres on the Great Gonzo (voiced by Goelz) who has always wanted
to know what species he is. Through a bizarre series of events, Gonzo learns
that he is in fact an alien. Unfortunately, an evil government agency led by
Edgar Singer (Jeffrey Tambor) also learns of the fact, and wishes to bring
in Gonzo for the inevitable painful probing. It's up to Kermit and the gang
to save the day.
Despite some bright moments, Muppets in Space is largely a failure. The
Muppets are more subdued than usual, and not all the Muppet's are given are
chance to light up the screen. Mainly Gonzo, Rizzo the Rat and Pepe the
Prawn are given much screen time, and although they are likeable enough, it
would be nice to see some more Kermit, Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear. Beaker
and Bunsen get most of the funny lines, while Kermit and Miss Piggy just
exist to push forward the plot.
Alongside the Muppet's are the usual human cameos, looking more embarrassed
than ever. Andie MacDowell has some fun with her role as a slimy news
reporter (perfectly suited to her) but the other cameos are decidedly
useless. Ray Liotta pops us a security guard and barely gets a laugh,
'Hollywood' Hogan has a funny but pointless few seconds on screen, and for
no apparent reason two Dawsons Creek cast members pop up for precious
seconds. I am sure that this has nothing to do with the fact that Sony (who
distributed this movie) produce Dawsons Creek.
There's also some movie parodies, including Independence Day and Close
Encounters of the Third Kind, but these are so obvious they are largely
pointless. Thankfully, the film largely resists Star Trek take-offs until
the final minutes of the film.
Despite the gloom, there are some good points. It's always nice to see the
Muppets on screen, and occasionally some genuine Muppet humour comes
through. There's a rather funky soundtrack featuring some disco hits. The
special effects are surprisingly decent. But there's just something missing
from this jumbled mess, and the film is never very funny or gels as a whole.
Maybe Jim Henson Studios are wandering since the death of Jim himself, but
something has to be done with the Muppet formula before it becomes so stale
that it dies.

Reviewed July 15, 1999.
In their sixth feature film (beginning with 1979's "The Muppet Movie"), Gonzo 
the Great, Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, and the rest of the gang 
have returned for "Muppets From Space." What hasn't returned to the series, 
unfortunately, like 1996's haphazard "Muppet Treasure Island," is a 
screenplay with any palpable charm or memorable moments. Written by Jerry 
Juhl and Joseph Mazzarino, the muppets have been transformed into some fairly 
uninteresting creations, an adjective I never thought I'd use when describing 
these particular cast of characters.
At the start of "Muppets From Space," we find the whole gang living together 
in a cozy-looking suburban home that has decidedly reached its breaking point 
(and horror of all horrors, it contains only one bathroom!). After having a 
dream in which Noah (F. Murray Abraham) would not let him into his ark 
because he wasn't sure what species he was, Gonzo the Great solemnly awakes, 
pondering his place on earth. As he looks at all of the pictures on the 
mantle of his roommates' families, Gonzo realizes that he has never seen 
anyone else like himself. Kermit's a frog, Miss Piggy's...well, a pig, Fozzie 
is a bear, Rizzo is a rat, but what exactly is Gonzo? After receiving 
messages via his alphabet cereal that ask, "R U THERE," Gonzo finally comes 
into contact, briefly, with a UFO and realizes that he is an alien from outer 
space. When an oily government agent (Jeffrey Tambor) catches wind of this, 
he kidnaps Gonzo in order to experiment on him, and it is up to the rest of 
the muppets to save him.
Since the last three "Muppet" pictures, a question has been swirling around 
in my head: Kermit and Miss Piggy are supposed to be the star attractions, 
and yet they are constantly being given disappointingly secondary roles. Not 
only do Kermit and Miss Piggy have a nice rapport with each other, but it is 
truly unlike Miss Piggy to step aside for someone else to come into the 
spotlight. These observations are only further supported by "Muppets From 
Space," in which Miss Piggy, now an assistant on a UFO-tabloid news show, is 
at her radiant best. Spright, fun, energetic, given the best lines and the 
most humorous physical comedy, Miss Piggy is a true star who doesn't deserve 
to be thrown to the wayside. Tellingly, most of the time she was off the 
screen, the film would halt to an abrupt stop until she reappeared.
One of the potentially good ideas that screenwriters Juhl and Mazzarino have 
are to finally place the muppets in today's time with many hip, cultural 
references. The problem is they don't go far enough, and very few of these 
pop-culture jokes are wasted opportunities, including The Mice Girls (a 
take-off on The Spice Girls) and brief cameos by Joshua Jackson and Katie 
Holmes, playing their "Dawson's Creek" characters. Further adding to the 
confusion of this idea is the line-up of '70s funk songs, including "Brick 
House" and "Celebration." Since this particular Muppet chapter is set in the 
present day, why does everyone sing like they are ready to step onto the 
disco floor? Come to think of it, a much-needed muppet rejuvenation may have 
come if the film had been set during the Disco Era; just think of all of the 
fresh ideas that might have come out with this simple time period change.
After a successful opening, in which many of the jokes were surprisingly 
amusing, the comedy evaporated before my eyes (except when Miss Piggy's 
shenanigans arose), and so did the energy. Most of the jokes are terribly 
lame, even for a children's film, and the 87-minute running time overstays 
its welcome by at least ten minutes. Let me make things clear: I still like 
the muppets, and their live-action movies that come out every couple years, 
but an increase in quality is in serious need. Gonzo the Great is a cute 
character, and so is Rizzo the Rat, but when the muppet pictures begin to 
revolve around them, forgetting about the other more distinguished characters 
and not giving anyone else enough time to develop their personalities, 
there's a highly noticable problem.

Cranky CriticŽ movie reviews: Muppets From Space
Rated [G], 90 minutes
Starring Jeffrey Tambor, F. Murray Abraham, Ray Liotta, Andie MacDowell,
"Hollywood" Hulk Hogan
Written by Jerry Juhl and Joseph Mazzarino and Ken Kaufman
Directed by Timothy Hill
website: http://www.muppetworld.com
The Muppets are performed by Dave Goelz, Steve Whitmire Bill Barretta
and Frank Oz. Created by Jim Henson.
Cranky must admit, he always did prefer it when the Muppets dropped
their personalities into literary classics, as in the riotous Muppet
Treasure Island. Then again, they've always had scripts that wrote humor
a couple of levels deep. With Muppets From Space, everything is much
simpler and will appeal mainly to the single digit kidlets, even with a
brilliantly funny opening sequence; a fever dream of Biblical
proportions. Gonzo the Great, whatever he is, is tormented by nightmares
of being turned away from Noah's ark. F. Murray Abraham is Noah, in the
first of many celebrity cameos that the Muppets are known for.
No role playing here. We see the Muppets in their daily routines. Miss
Piggy goes off to work at a local television station. Kermit deals with
the everyday chores of running the rooming house they share. Gonzo's
cereal talks to him.
It's The Muppets, folks. Of course the cereal communicates. Andie
MacDowell challenges Miss Piggy for dominance of the teevee airwaves.
David Arquette plays the evil research scientist. Pat Hingle is a
military man who has no tolerance for aliens or felt. Simply, Muppets
>From Space is totally painless for us grown-ups. Then again, we ain't
the demographic target for this. As for kidlets, well, Cranky lugged his
niece Sherri, age 9, to a private screening. Then I stuffed her with
Chinese food and ice cream and put her to work.
Ladies and Gentlemen, the Cutesy Critic ...
 
Right from the horse's mouth, people. The screening room had lots of
kidlets, most of 'em single digits, and all were wowed. More cameos,
keeping the adults entertained: Rob Schneider, Rob Liotta, Hulk Hogan,
and Kathy Griffin. As well, the entire film pulsates to some of the
great rock 'n' soul tunes of the long ago 70s -- Billy Preston, Earth
Wind and Fire, the O'Jays, Commodores and Isley Brothers.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Muppets From Space, he would have
paid...
There are lots of flicks aiming at the teenkids, very few that a
parental unit can take the smaller younguns to. Muppets From Space fills
that bill nicely. So why is the rating at rental level? We rate for
grownups, and this flick is one we'll rent for the kids.
[and it's Animal. Did you even have to think about it???]

So few movies are being released - and so few of those are for kids - that 
Muppets From Space will have an audience, and may even turn a profit for its 
makers.  It's a perfectly enjoyable little movie, though at best it has the 
quality of a television special.
The opening is fine:  we see Gonzo (voice of  Dave Goelz) being refused a 
place on the ark by Noah himself (a cameo by F. Murray Abraham).  You see, 
there's only one of Gonzo, a joke with which all Muppet fans are familiar.  
But is he alone?
The film clicks early with a gathering of all the Muppets, who inexplicably 
seem to live together in an enormous house.  Reminiscent of the best 
ensemble shots from 'The Muppet Show,' this segment is directed well, 
assisted by catchy music.  We glance all of the mainstays - Miss Piggy and 
Animal and Fozzie Bear (Frank Oz), Kermit the Frog and Rizzo the Rat (Steve 
Whitmire)  -- along with the charming little bug-eyed Pepe the Prawn (Bill 
Barretta).  Many other recognizable Muppets do their stuff as well.  (It's 
hard not to belly-laugh at the sheep and penguins!)
Gonzo - apparently very old but a friend to these contemporary Muppets - is 
pouring his breakfast cereal when some of the spilled letters arrange 
themselves to read "Watch the Sky," followed by "R U There."  Soon Gonzo is 
struck by something like lightning, and experiences a vision in which he is 
flying, unassisted, through space;  two Cosmic Fish tell him that he is an 
alien, and he should await the return his fellow hook-nosed aliens, who left 
him behind ages ago.
All this is complicated by a plot involving a government conspiracy.  (Do 
the threads of the narrative sound familiar?)  Jeffrey Tambor plays K. Edgar 
Singer (c'mon - the name's not even cute!), an executive in an FBI-like 
operation.  He has been charged by his boss, a general played by the 
venerable character actor Pat Hingle, to produce an alien.  By roundabout 
ways, Singer (known as 'Ed') discovers Gonzo's alleged identity, and 
attempts to chase him down.
Really the film tries to do too much:  its science fiction elements do not 
blend well with the spy flavor.  Although there are spaceships and other 
fantastic items, there is also the Bondian device of weapons and fancy toys 
explained to the main Muppets - toys invariably used later on.  Too, the 
film is mis-named:  most of the action takes place on Earth.
Himself a distinguished character actor, Jeffrey Tambor here plays it too 
straight.  A little over-the-top never hurt any performance in a Muppet 
movie.  Roll or cross your eyes once in awhile, will you?  Several other 
live actors do cameos, and most are worthy of a chuckle.  Kathy Griffin is 
perhaps the funniest, in her role as an over-zealous guard.  Of course the 
highlight of the acting is the voices.  With Miss Piggy, Frank Oz delivers 
the same sardonic humor we are used to.  I wished she was given a more major 
role in the plot.  As Pepe the Prawn, Bill Barretta was also delightful, 
imbuing his character with subtle and often hilarious traits.
A Muppets movie has always meant solid entertainment, and this one delivers 
most of the time.  It's certainly good to see the franchise still going - 
Elmo from "Sesame Street" stars in his own movie soon.  A bigger vision and 
more rewriting, one hopes, will bring future Muppet endeavors up to the 
greatness of the first few movies.

Who doesn't love the Muppets? They're an adorable and colorful group of
furry characters that carry a certain charm wherever they go. Seeing
them in Muppets From Space, however, is somewhat of a letdown. Unlike
their previous outings, this sixth installment is poorly written and
choppily constructed, and Kermit and the gang can only go so far on
their own charm.
The Great Gonzo, the likable big-nosed whatzit we all know and love, has
been promoted from supporting player to lead. In a clever opening dream
sequence, Gonzo is fighting gusty winds to get to Noah (F. Murray
Abraham) and his ark which is just leaving for the long journey. When
Noah asks Gonzo what species he is, the blue Muppet is at a loss for
words. The truth is, Gonzo knows nothing about his family roots, and
Noah turns him away in confusion.
The plot concerns Gonzo attempting to discover what he is, and where
exactly he came from. His brothers hear the cries for help and send him
messages in his Alphabet cereal, and after a brief meeting with the
Cosmic Fish (`May the fish be with you!'), Gonzo realizes that he is a
deserted member of an alien race. Unfortunately, a paranoid government
operative (Jeffrey Tambor) in charge of monitoring extra-terrestrial
activity is also involved. He will stop at nothing to prevent the
landing of Gonzo's alien family, including destroying them for the
supposed well-being of America. Yes, it's another villain with
absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever.
This is not one of the better Muppet adventures. The plot is flat and
shockingly devoid of the clever screen-writing that always assists these
characters and magnifies their jokes. Once in a while, there is a
refreshing taste of what the Muppets stand for - cute, cleverly placed
retorts and innocent charm. But there is simply not enough to fuel a
ninety minute movie. The Muppets are a charming and sweet-natured bunch,
but not even they can carry an entire film without a sensible script
backing their every step. Kermit's better qualities are not on display,
Miss Piggy has been transformed into a kung-fu warrior who shows no
remorse, and even the Swedish chief doesn't speak as much nonsensical
gibberish as he used to. The Muppets still have potential, but this is
not the movie for them.
Another bonus of a Muppet movie are the enjoyable musical numbers, which
are unwisely discarded here until the final presentation of the 70's
funk hit `Celebration'. More toe-tapping songs and less draggy, familiar
plot additions could have been the recipe for a smoother final product.
The plot uses elements from Star Wars, Independence Day and Star Trek -
but usually not to the clever effect that we'd hope for. Muppets From
Space feels like a plastic-wrapped version of the earlier films that's
been sitting on the counter and drained of all inventive satire.
Keeping one tradition alive, there are numerous star cameos abounding
here. Brief appearances range from Ray Liotta to Hollywood Hogan, David
Arquette to Andie MacDowell, and so on. But none have the memorable
presence they deserve, and Tambor is wasted as the only big name star to
appear in more than a handful of scenes. The performers, both human and
puppet, try desperately to inject more spice into this pointless and
rambling excursion. But too much in the script is tired and formulaic,
including scientific devices like invisible spray, for them to have a
substantial effect on what sadly remains a sub-par Muppet outing.
Nonetheless, I am not entirely pessimistic about the future of Jim
Henson's marvelous creations. One poor script doesn't derail the entire
franchise, but it does raise certain questions. Perhaps the Muppets have
had their day, and even if their legacy finishes on a bland note, they
will always be remembered with a pleasant smile.
