Better known by its English translation title,
"The Seventh Seal", "Det Sjunde inseglet" is
a pensive art film set in the Middle Ages.
The success of the film earned international
acclaim for director and writer Ingmar Bergman.
But today, the fixation with death and rejection
of the hereafter, as well as the relentlessly
gloomy and overstated imagery, makes for an
inaccessible, and worse, overheated film.
The plot is simple.  A plague is sweeping
through Europe, killing a large percentage
of the population, and causing some terror
and paranoid among the superstitious peasants.
Death (Bengt Ekerot) visits a knight who
has participated in the Crusades (Max von Sydow).
The knight delays Death by challenging him
to a game of chess.  The game has frequent
and lengthy breaks, enabling the knight to
wander around seeking the Truth about the
hereafter.  He encounters a young woman
who is to be burned as a witch (Gunnel Lindblom)
and a couple with a small child, Joseph (Nils
Poppe) and Mary (Bibi Andersson).
For Bergman, death is a repudiation of life, a
proof that all is in vain.  This extreme attitude
avoids the truth about death.  Death is simply a
part of life.  From the point of view of a dying
man, the world may be coming to an end, but the
world goes on as before.  Bergman depicts death as
an evil force, rather than as a biological process,
and supports his view with imagery showing horror
and suffering.
Cynics will find the film ripe for parody, and those
seeking entertainment will avoid it.  "The Seventh Seal"
is an Art film that may be embraced by fans of the
genre who accept rather than question the film's overripe
imagery.  The film is marginally good; well cast and
with stark cinematography by Gunnar Fischer.  But
it is no masterpiece.
