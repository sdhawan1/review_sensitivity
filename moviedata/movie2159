Susan Granger's review of "BOYS DON'T CRY" (Fox Searchlight Pictures)
         First-time writer/director Kimberly Peirce was so appalled
when she read a newspaper account of how and why 21 year-old Teena
Brandon was shot dead with two friends in a farmhouse just outside
Falls City, Nebraska, back in 1994, that she was determined to bring
this true story to the screen. Teena Brandon - a.k.a. Brandon Teena -
so desperately desired to be a boy that she posed as one. She
"strapped and packed" by flattening her breasts beneath surgical
bandages and inserting socks into the crotch of her jeans. Not only
did she get away with the pathetic masquerade but, amazingly, she
seduced several young women who, when they questioned her sexual
identity, were told that she was a hermaphrodite. Brandon adamantly
insisted that she was not a lesbian, explaining that she was really a
boy trapped in a girl's body and often spoke of plans to have a sex
change operation. Actress Hilary Swank (TV's " Beverly Hills 90210")
delivers an incredibly believable performance as the troubled
"pretty-boy" Brandon with Chloe Sevigny as the gullible girl who
adores her. The problem is that all of the characters are essentially
repugnant for one reason or another, so it's difficult to relate to
any of them. (Giving a toddler beer to drink is hardly an endearing
quality.) Plus, there's a gratuitously violently brutal rape scene in
which two local boys (Peter Sarsgaard, Brendan Sexton III) take their
revenge on the deceitful "dyke" - and that, in particular, is
distasteful and difficult to watch. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to
10, "Boys Don't Cry" is a pathetic, sad 4. It's a tragic, depressing
tale of prejudice and hatred.

   A colleague of mine loved the Walt Disney production of
"The Straight Story" because, he said, this was the first
movie he ever saw about Midwesterners that showed them a
proper respect. Of course a film needs more than a respectful
consideration of its subjects, however stereotyped they may
be in real life, but that deference to the Ralph Farnsworth
character and everyone he meets on the road from Iowa to
Wisconsin did it for him.
   If the converse is true, than this associate of mine would
turn thumbs down on "Boys Don't Cry," based on a real story
of horror which took place during the early 1990s in the state
of Nebraska.  The beer-swilling, chain-smoking, white-trash
personalities who dominate the tale are enough to drive
anyone insane and leave no one immune to their
psychological and physical abuse.  "Boys Don't Cry," which
opened to rave reviews at the '99 New York Film Festival, is
an unusual film, one with the qualities of fine acting and a
sincere, realistic approach to the its morbid subject matter,
but somehow the pieces do not coalesce into an engaging
film.  Overlong at almost two hours, this story deals with a
woman pretending to be a man, and if it were comic to the
slightest degree we could say it had Shakespearean
undertones.  "Boys Don't Cry" is largely melodramatic, its
director averse to slipping in a moment of comic relief.  At the
helm, Kimberly Peirce does a swell job highlighting the
troubles of a person seeking inner peace and freedom who
does knows the popular movie expression "Let's get out of
here," but seems unable to follow the advice.  But the central
character does not evoke the pity she should from the
audience despite the Oscar-caliber performance that Hilary
Swank puts into her.  Somehow, her murder leaves us cold,
not so much because she is too naive, too obtuse to sense
the danger she is in, but because she comes across as a
person that only a mother (and, in this case, just two other
characters) could love.
   Brandon Teena (Hilary Swank), who appears in virtually
every scene, is a young woman who is physically attracted to
other women, yet insists that she is not a lesbian.  This
insight could be a valid one: she does not consider herself to
be a woman at all.  While paying lip service to the
psychological label "sexual identity crisis," she is simply a
man in a woman's body, and one day, leaving the young man
who cares for her and has allowed her to sleep in his home,
she cut her hair short leaving a cute cowlick over her
forehead, tapes her breasts tightly and inserts a sock into her
undergarments.  Changing her name minimally from Teena
Brandon to Brandon Teena, she leaves Lincoln, Nebraska
and in one instance in a speeding car almost literally flies in
the face of her newfound freedom.  Meeting up with some
white trash in the backwoods of Nebraska, she is attracted to
the delicate teen, Lana (Chloe Sevigny) who reciprocates
Brandon's love, and in one erotic scene Brandon seems to
convince the young woman that she is having sex with a
man.
   Ultimately, the confused Brandon is raped and murdered by
a pair of sociopathic backwoodsmen, John (Peter Sarsgaard)
and Tom (Brendan Sexton III)--who play their roles to the
villainous hilt as men who are incensed that Brandon had lied
to them daily.  Still, the script--written by director Peirce
together with Andy Bienen--does not clarify the motives for
the murder.  Are they repelled by Brandon's seduction of
Lana?  Are they furious that they were themselves
compatriots of a lesbian and felt dishonored by the
prevarication?
   "Boys Don't Cry," then, is one of those movies in which all
the qualities of fine cinema are present.  The ensemble
acting is splendid, the murder gruesomely portrayed, the
lovemaking unaffected.  What nullifies these attributes is our
inability to feel much for a pitiful victim who, if properly
moneyed with a supportive family could have easily solved
her sexual identity problem with plastic surgery.

She was born Teena Brandon in Lincoln, Nebraska, but she introduced herself
to everyone as Brandon Teena. She dressed like a boy, acted like a boy, and
had girlfriends whom she apparently treated better than had she been a boy.
Even after she was found out, raped, and murdered, Brandon's girlfriends
remained enraptured of him, for in every case aside from Brandon's
biological gender, Brandon was a "he."  Susan Muska and Gréta Olafsdóttir
produced The Brandon Teena Story, a documentary released last year
recording these events.  That film was poorly-made, unintentionally
exploitative, but nevertheless, enormously powerful owing to its subject
matter alone.  Now comes first-time filmmaker, Kimberly Peirce's dramatic
narrative version, Boys Don't Cry.  It's well-made, non-exploitative, and
enormously powerful owing to Peirce's creative direction and her stars
bravura performances.
Following actual events pretty closely, Peirce and her co-writer Andy
Bienen pick up the story from Brandon's move from Lincoln to Falls City,
Nebraska, where Brandon meets and falls in love with local girl, Lana. This
incurs the wraths of Brandon's heretofore friends, John Lotter and Tom
Nissen, both ex-cons.  What is impressive about Boys Don't Cry is that
Peirce doesn't sensationalize the material, which is easily done in lesser
hands with such subjects as gender-bending, rape, and murder. Nor does
Peirce, a lesbian, exude an agenda.  Brandon is shown warts and all as a
thief and habitual liar (about far more than his gender), while John and
Tom are welcoming and amicable before they uncover Brandon's secret. Peirce
even allows that John's loathing for Brandon may derive more from his
jealousy of Lana than homophobia, though homophobia abets his actions. 
Brandon does not come off as a martyr, but very much an individual. Brandon
refuses the label of lesbian. The subtext is gender fluidity and the
questioning of why we have to categorize sexual orientation at all.  Labels
emphasize difference, and difference is a code word for misanthropy.
Peirce intersperses wonderful time-lapse sequences of the horizon, the
clouds, the stars, even a refinery throughout the film.  While these could
just be throwaway flourishes, their beauty and timing point to a
transcendent hope in the characters' dreams, no matter how stupid they may
be, like Brandon's preoccupation with Memphis or Lana's wanting to become a
karaoke singer.  Only at the end, does Pierce's romanticization get the
better of her, in a fictional love scene between Lana and the doomed
Brandon.
The entire cast is superb.  Actress Hilary Swank holds nothing back in
giving the character of Brandon brashness, longing, hope, naivete, and
denial.  Matching her every step of the way is Chloë Sevigny as Lana, and
their chemistry together is wholly convincing.  Sevigny (along with Sarah
Polley) is among the great actors of her generation.  Peter Sarsgaard
imbues John with both humanity and barbarous malevolence.  In two smaller
roles of great merit are Alicia Goranson, who plays Candace, Brandon's
first friend in Falls City, and Jeanetta Arnette as Lana's outlandish mom.

The story of Teena Brandon is more than just that, it's the story of Mathew
Shepard, possibly even the story of Howard Beach. Shepard was killed for being
gay and Beach was killed for being black. Both were killed out of intolerance,
possibly fear as well. Teena was killed for being a girl who wanted to be a
boy. She changed her appearance (taped her breasts, cut her hair, developed a
swagger), and her name (took the Brandon and put it before the Teena) all to
become male. Shocking? Not really. When you strip away all the religious
propaganda and idiotic moralizing we've had stuffed down our throats since
tots, you'll find that this story is really a modernist fairly tale, like the
pauper who wanted to be a prince, it is the girl who wanted to be a boy. Though
unlike the homogenized fairy tales we're force fed as kids, this one doesn't
end happily.
I recall the first time I became aware of Brandon's story. It 'twas the night
before finals, a night filled with the worst kind of pre-performance anxiety
(well, maybe the second worse kind), but I was covered; I had studied with such
abandon (into the wee hours of morning) that my head was overflowing with
useless crap I would surely forget by the next week. Before heading to bed I
switched on Cinemax hoping for some soft-core porn, as is the usual programming
at 2:00 a.m. Instead I found THE BRANDON TEENA STORY, a horribly made, but
nonetheless gripping documentary about the brief life and sudden death of Teena
Brandon. It was a maddening story, viewing it was tantaumont to being privy to
an injustice that could have easily been countered. Maddening because of the
stupidity and ignorance of nearly everyone involved. And maddening because of
how this innocent was savagely beaten, raped and killed all for her desire to
be something she wasn't. And who among us doesn't at least fleetingly have that
desire? Is her wish to be a man all that hard to take in these supposedly
enlightened times? ("Enlightened" today means we all carry around the same old
prejudices, only now they're kept tightly underwraps only to surface in the
heat of the moment as DO THE RIGHT THING, Spike Lee's audacious film about
intolerance, showed us). After all, we don't think harshly of those who get
nose jobs, liposuction, breast implants, all the surgeries designed to make you
someone else; the person you want to be.
When Brandon is confronted about her switch (during a rape query no less) she's
practically forced into saying "I have a sexual identity crisis" when she
really doesn't, she's simply more comfortable as a man.
That damn documentary kept me up till 4:00 am, but it was well worth it. Teena
Brandon's story is more insightful than anything I picked up in the gargantuan
Psychology textbook I had been slogging through the very same night.
In BOYS DON'T CRY, Brandon is played by Hilary Swank in a performance that goes
well beyond simple macho posturing. With her close-cropped hair, thin frame,
and wide grin, Swank has the appearance of an extremely gawky Matt Damon. But
look closer at that smile, the earnestness in her demeanor, the good-natured
chivalrousness and she becomes loveable as a man. It's easy to see why a bitter
southern townie would fall for her. She has something the other males lack; an
aw shucks kindness. She comes with flowers while the others come with beer and
condoms.
As the film opens Teena leaves her hometown of Lincoln for Falls City, a
trailer park haven. Through a bar fight she becomes acquainted with two loutish
rednecks (both extremely well played by Peter Sarsgaard and Brendan Sexton
III), and their "girls". One of whom catches Teena's eye. She is Lana (well
played by Chloe Sevigny) a bitter townie, who like all bitter townies dreams of
escaping the confines of her town. Brandon is in a similar situation; she
dreams of escaping the confines of femininity. Teena woos her with sweetness,
something the men of this particular town seem to know nothing about (yes a
generalization, but a surprisingly appropriate one judging from the
documentary). Their relationship is the heart of the film, and it certainly
works to counter the almost clinical manner of its brutal, unflinching
conclusion. That heart makes the violence much harder to take; we've grown to
care about this character and the unrelenting cruelty towards her hurts, as it
should.
Kimberly Pierce (the co-writer\director, and certainly a talent to watch) ups
the lyrical undertones with in-between-scene segues filmed as heady rushes of
prairie life speeded up to the point where all we see are rapid lights blinking
with urgency. The film itself gradually becomes more urgent, and a bit more
difficult to watch. Pierce doesn't hide much from us. We see the murders, the
beatings, and the rape, but here it serves a purpose whereas in a major
Hollywood production like THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER it did not. In that movie the
rape was filmed by commercial director Simon West as a masochistic gang bang
fantasy. West used flashy camera moves and stylishly dank cinematography to
make, what looked like, a slick commercial for rape. Pierce hardly moves her
camera; she simply presents us with the facts. BOY'S DON'T CRY doesn't preach,
or moralize its characters, it chronicles events that did occur. And it gives
them life and meaning by taking us into a strangely touching romance that looks
to be so simple on the surface. It is simple in all its ROMEO AND JULIET tragic
romanticism, but complex because of the one major addition.
Pierce's film is uncompromising in its content. I can just imagine if it had
been made as a mainstream film (as was proposed). The movie features the kind
of raw intensity, taboo exploration, and emotional truths that used to be
(pre-Tarantino) the hallmark of independent film. Now amidst the rotting
corpses of irony laden "hipster" indies, BOYS DON'T CRY stands out as a
sobering experience.

The slightly effeminate Brandon likes doing all those manly things such
as hanging out at bars hitting "on" the gals and "at" the guys.  After
lots of carousing, he's off to try a dangerous sport that's like
water-skiing on land but pulled by a pickup truck.  Brandon's ambitions
are suitably macho, as he envisions himself off fighting big fires.
When he wakes the morning after a fight with a big shiner on his eye and
a cut on his cheek, he couldn't be prouder.
Brandon, whose female name is Teena, is played believably by Hilary
Swank.  With her deeply-sunken cheeks, wide toothy smile and lanky look,
Swank appears decidedly male, although not at all like the other guys in
the movie.  The men in the story have long, dirty-looking, shaggy hair
and scraggly beards.  The short-haired Brandon is the only guy on the
screen with a traditional guy's haircut.
BOYS DON'T CRY has little to recommend it other than that it's based on
a true story.  The horrific ending means that Brandon Teena deserves our
sympathy, but it does not follow that the film dramatization based on
her life's story is worthwhile.  (There is also a documentary about her
life entitled THE BRANDON TEENA STORY.)
The first three quarters of the movie has Brandon falling for Lana
(Chloë Sevigny from KIDS), who lives with her large and largely
despicable family.  "I hate my life," Lana says in the story's biggest
understatement.  Lana's family -- the type that used to be called poor
white trash -- seem to spend all their waking hours with a cigarette in
one hand and a beer bottle in the other.
The long first part of the movie has nothing of interest, save watching
how Brandon copes with being a female in men's clothes.  Procuring and
hiding female sanitary products becomes a particularly tricky matter for
her.
The ending, which lasts an almost unbearable half hour, shamelessly
manipulates our emotions.  Director Kimberly Peirce has a toddler run
screaming through the worst of the mayhem, just to make sure we are
completely disgusted with the level of unspeakable violence before us.
If the first part had given Brandon some realistic characters to
interact with, the excessively long ending might have been tolerable
and, possibly, even meaningful.  As it is, the movie just leaves you
with a gut wrenching feeling.  Rather than being moved, you just feel
sick.
BOYS DON'T CRY runs 1:56.  It is rated R but should be NC-17 for gang
rape, strong violence, nudity, language and drug use.  It is not
appropriate for teenagers.

 Boys Don't Cry (1999) 4 stars out of 4. Starring Hilary Swank, Chloe
Sevigny, Peter Sarsgaard and Brendon Sexton III. Directed by Kimberly
Peirce.
 Like most of us Teena Brandon was seeking love, yearning for that someone
to hold her, comfort her, grow old with and accept her for who she was.
 Unfortunately, Teena herself did not know who she was. But she did realize
who she wanted to be.
 Teena's true story is told in "Boys Don't Cry," a wrenching and tragic
look at a confused individual searching for love as well as identity.
 Teena admits to suffering from a "sexual identity crisis." Teena dresses
like a man. She binds her breasts, stuffs a sock into the crotch of her
blue jeans and cruises bars. She calls herself Brandon Teena.
 Women are attracted to Brandon because he is non-threatening and treats
them with respect and kindness.
 Teena insists she is not a lesbian, that she is a man trapped in a woman's
body. Her dream is to undergo sex transformation surgery.
 Run out of her hometown of Lincoln, Neb., Teena as Brandon arrives in the
small town of Falls City, Neb., where she befriends Lana (Chloe Sevigny) as
well as Lana's crowd, which includes two ex-cons, John (Peter Sarsgaard)
and Tom (Brendon Sexton III).
 All goes well for Brandon at first. His new friends treat him as one of
the guys. They good naturedly tease Brandon about his slight demeanor to
which he confesses to John and Tom that he is a "wuss." Even so, they
accept him.
 Complications arrive when Brandon and Lana fall in love, and when
Brandon's past catches up with her.
 The truth when revealed ignites a chain of events culminating in rape and
murder.
 "Boys Don't Cry" is a sensitive, compelling drama that will rivet you for
its nearly two-hour run. It is a movie that will emotionally drain you
while forcing you to confront your feelings about people who live outside
what our society considers the norm.
 It is unflinchingly brutal and candidly tender.
 As Teena/Brandon Hilary Swank is a revelation. Best remembered as the star
of "The Next Karate Kid", the last and weakest film in that unlamented
series, she has come a long way from the young girl who only seemed to be
able to glower, pout or smile.
 Here she fleshes out a young person who seems at odds not only with the
world, but with herself. Swank, lowering her voice and barely speaking
above a whisper, always seems to be checking herself. She appears forever
to be wanting to shed her skin.
 Swank gives a poignant and courageous performance, one in which she is
forced to expose herself physically as well as emotionally.
 She seems to tiptoe through her world, afraid that at any moment someone
will expose her secret.
 As Brandon she doesn't act macho, but stays in character as the quiet,
rather sensitive, shy person she appears to be.
 When trapped in her lie, her eyes show the panic of a snared animal.
 Swank's Teena is a victim, not a protagonist. When she is brutally
punished by John and Tom for her deception, she accepts the abuse and
humiliation, feeling she deserved it.
 When the five Academy Award nominees for best actress are announced in
February, Swank's name definitely will be among them. She gives the
strongest female performance of 1999, bar none.
 Sevigny's Lana is another victim. A young girl with low self-esteem, her
confidence is bolstered by Brandon's sweet affection and attention.
 Even when graphically confronted with the truth about Brandon's gender,
she stubbornly continues to call her lover "he."
 Sevigny and Swank's love scenes are sensuous without being sordid.
 Sevigny's performance here is even better than her recent portrayal in
"American Beauty."
As John, Sarsgaard is a walking psychopath. One powerful scene has him
playing with his baby daughter, his eyes all aglow with warmth and love.
The next moment, she wets him and he explodes with an animalistic rage
capable of killing. It is a foreshadowing of things to come.
 Director Kimberly Peirce, who co-wrote the script with Andy Bienen, shows
an affection for her subject as well as a balanced objectivity. She is
sympathetic to Teena/Brandon's plight but is not afraid to show her flaws,
her willingness to flirt with danger and discovery and the thrill it
engenders. Nor does Peirce pull back from showing Teena/Brandon as a user
who steals a blank check from one friend, and continually imposes herself
on a cousin whenever she needs a safe haven.
 How good is "Boys Don't Cry?" At the end I wanted to hate John and Tom,
but couldn't because Peirce and Bienen - with able assistance from
Sarsgaard and Sexton - have created such well-rounded individuals that you
understood their motivations and, while not condoning their actions, you
could at least appreciate their disgust and outrage.
 "Boys Don't Cry" is an achievement, one of the best movies of the year. It
is gloomy, overpowering and black, a movie that will stir your soul and
your psyche.

Starring Hilary Swank, Chloë Sevigny, Peter Sarsgaard, Brendan Sexton
III. Directed by Kimberly Peirce. Rated R (Warning: This movie is on
the outer boundaries of the R rating. Don't take aunt Helen).
Boys Don't Cry is a brutal, often painful to watch the biopic of Teena
Brandon, a teenage girl who dressed up as a boy, lied to a girl, mixed
in with the wrong crowd and got brutally raped and murdered. In a year
when Hollywood adaptations of true stories -- some truthful than,
controversially, others -- dominated critics' top ten list, this may
have been the only one I truly liked, though "enjoyed" is the wrong
word to use here.
This is a situation movie, where there is a set-up and then events are
allowed to progress on their natural course without an honest-to-
goodness storyline. In what is easily the year's most lauded
performance, Hilary Swank plays Teena Brandon who, as I've mentioned,
dresses up as a boy and makes friends with a group of trailer-trashy
folk with family problems and what seem like outgoing personalities.
Specifically, Teena falls in love with Lana (Chloë Sevigny), a
beautiful young woman stuck in the middle of a dysfunctional family and
trapped in a town where she has no future.
Teena and Lana form a nice relationship, but they have to deal with
Lana's family, who will not stand for the idea of a boy pretending to
be a girl should they ever find out the truth. In real life, of course,
they did find out the truth and the results were tragic.
For better or for worse, depending on the viewer, Boys Don't Cry does
not spare us the details. The final scenes become painful to watch --
we want to turn away but we don't dare. Director Kimberly Peirce
portrays the final event in all its crushing realisticity, refusing to
soften things up for those who can't stomach them. Many reviews have
had this caveat and I will say it again: Boys Don't Cry is not for the
squeamish. It is rated R but could easily have received an NC-17. Use
caution.
Not surprisingly, the movie has received uniformly bad reviews from the
wacky, inimitable Christian Right. Hardly surprising, considering the
film's liberal good intentions. It is decidedly pro-homosexuality,
though I hate to put such a simplistic label on a movie as good as this
one. Reading some reviews for it, I was surprised that people can hate
it so much just because they disagree with it.
The reason that Boys Don't Cry has received so much media attention is
simple: Hilary Swank. She is, indeed, phenomenal -- not only successful
in playing a girl-turned-boy but also in lodging her character deep in
our hearts, a place she will remain in for a long time. What's less
fortunate, perhaps, is that she casts a long shadow on her equally
amazing co-star Chloë Sevigny. At once gorgeous, approachable and, in
the end, powerfully poignant, Sevigny was nominated for an Best
Supporting Actress Oscar. Despite the awards recognition, when people
talk about Boys Don't Cry, the name Hilary Swank always comes up; her
co-star is all but forgotten.
The film is, in some ways, expressing rage against intolerance but it's
too good a movie to act as a propaganda machine. In the end, of course,
it comes back to this central theme but rather than preach through the
whole movie, the filmmakers take us on a journey through a world we may
not realize that we live in. Indeed, in a perfect world, this movie
wouldn't had to have been made. Unfortunately, this is not a perfect
world and the absorbing, daring Boys Don't Cry points out one of its
flaws.

"Boys Don't Cry", the debut film of Kimberly Peirce, is probably the
most emotionally draining picture I will see all year. Having read the
news stories on which this film is based, I knew how it all was going
to end. But that didn't lessen the powerful impact which this film had
on me. It is admittedly a very difficult film to watch, and one that I
cannot recommend to all viewers. However, if you are looking for a
gripping portrait of Americana gone bad, then "Boys Don't Cry" is the
film you need to see.
If you do not know the heartbreaking story of Brandon Teena, then I
will ask you to read no further than this paragraph. It is impossible
to review this film without discussing the ending. But if you know how
the story ends, the film's strong emotional bond is not weakened.
"Boys Don't Cry" explores the life of Brandon Teena (Hilary Swank)
from the day he wanders into Falls City, Nebraska, until the day of
his grisly death a few months later.  Brandon is really a girl named
Teena who is in the midst of a sexual identity crisis. One night,
after having lesbian slurs thrown at her, she decides to cut her hair
and dress like a man. She goes roller skating and ends the night
making out with a beautiful blonde.
The next night, she tries it again, and she meets John (Peter
Sarsgaard) and Tom (Brendan Sexton III), who take Brandon to a party
in their hometown, Falls City. The next day, Brandon wakes up and
realizes that he's still there. That night, at a karaoke bar, he gets
his first glimpse of Lana (Chloe Sevigny), the most beautiful girl in
town.
John, the tough guy who has just got out of prison, resides in Lana's
house with her mother (Jeanna Arnette) and his young daughter. John
has no impulse control, and can often go into unprecedented fits of
wild rage. He immediately takes a liking to the girlish Brandon, but
one can see how he slowly begins to notice his true identity.
Brandon and Lana slowly form a convincing relationship. Like
characters in every small town movie, Lana is bored with her life, and
needs someone to help open her eyes. This helps explain why later in
the film, when she finds out who Brandon really is, she decides to
stay with him/her. Brandon is known as the nice, slightly awkward guy
in town, and Lana likes his sense of newness in her world of familiar
people. All the questions about how their relationship functions
sexually are explained in the film, so I won't go into detail.
Things are going quite well for Brandon in his new life, until he
misses a court date in Lincoln for a grand theft auto which occurred a
while back. Soon his past life of fake IDs and crime catches up with
him, and he finds himself in prison...in the girls ward.
Kimberly Peirce presents every stage of this tragedy flawlessly, and
she doesn't do it alone. Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny are excellent
together; each one bringing such emotional honesty to their role. In a
better world, Swank would be a shoo in for an Oscar nomination, but
"Boys Don't Cry" is too explicit and truthful a film to win such an
award.
"Boys Don't Cry" retells one of the most important stories of the
1990's, one that Peirce recreates down to every detail. She spent ages
of research on this project, and even made Hilary Swank live as a man
for a number of weeks. It is a breakout film for everyone involved,
and can stand tall as one of 1999's very best.
The tragic ending to this gritty tale is one that will continue to be
discussed. How could we live in such a homophobic society that a girl
must dress as a boy in order to be accepted, and then die for her
actions? People try to fit in in different ways, with different
results.  The saddest thing about "Boys Don't Cry" is that it really
is just another murder story, one that happens every day in all parts
of the world, but makes us turn our head away.

Some words of warning: "Boys Don't Cry" is difficult to watch. The film,
which chronicles the events leading up to the December 30, 1993 death of
21-year old Teena Brandon, features images of intense brutality,
including an almost unbearably realistic rape scene. Even in its quiet
moments, a sense of impending doom washes over the screen. This is
powerful moviemaking. Over two months have passed since the critics'
screening of the film, but it still remains vividly etched in my memory.
So why should you subject yourself to "Boys Don't Cry?" Because it will
transport you to a place you (hopefully) have never been before. After
experiencing this film, you'll have a better understanding of
homophobia, of misogyny, of unbridled hated. You'll have a better
understanding of compulsive, self-destructive behavior. After spending
two hours in Falls City, Nebraska, those shrieking yahoos on "The Jerry
Springer Show" won't seem so comical anymore.
"Boys Don't Cry" is based on a true story. As usual, the filmmakers
change some facts, including a couple of significant ones, but the core
of truth remains. On a regular basis, Teena Brandon strapped down her
breasts, stuffed a tube sock into her jeans and headed out to live and
love as a man named Brandon Teena.
Teena was a fairly convincing man. His gait, mannerisms and vocal
cadences were credible. Only when he feared his physical gender was
about to be revealed did his feminine traits betray the disguise. Make
no mistake, Teena was neither a gay activist nor a gay saint. A product
of a socio-economic underclass where ignorance is the norm, Teena acted
out of a drive he couldn't explain or contain. Following heartfelt
warnings from friends and numerous scrapes with locals and the law,
Teena simply moved his actions to a neighboring town.
There Teena (Hilary Swank) becomes friends with John Lotter (Peter
Sarsgaard) and Thomas Nissen (Brendan Sexton III), a pair of ex-cons
given to heavy partying and bursts of violence. He also meets, and falls
in love with, young Lana Tisdel (Chloe Sevigny), remaining oblivious to
the fact that Lotter and Tisdel had once been involved, and that the
volatile Lotter still pines for his ex.
And so the pattern for disaster falls into place. As Teena and Tisdel
draw closer, the good old boys get more twitchy. Sitting in the theater
knowing what's coming, you want to climb into the screen, grab Teena and
shout, "Snap out of it! These people are dangerous! Pack your gear, move
to a college town and hit a gay bar, for Christ's sake!"
No such luck. Teena continues his dance with doom, just as so many
others do. While the individual story of Brandon Teena is particularly
nightmarish, especially in light of the increase in violent assaults
against gays, it is just one of many. Teena also represents every woman
who stays in an abusive relationship with a man; every aging gay male
who pretends his trophy boy loves him for his soul and not his money,
every person who remains in terrible circumstances because they see no
alternative.
There's more. Watch the men in this story. Their contempt of women is
overwhelming and all too common. When they learn of Teena's true
physical gender, the motivation behind their horrific reactions is
blurred. Is it because of the deception, because of the gay thing, or
because they have learned that their buddy is (shudder) a lowly female?
The visceral power of "Boys Don't Cry" comes from the skills of director
Kimberly Peirce and a slew of amazing performers. Hilary Swank, a Best
Actress Oscar nominee for her work here, is astounding as Teena. At no
point in the film does she ever hit a single false note. Chloe Sevigny,
a nominee in the Best Supporting Actress category, works magic, using
her languid eyes and tentative smile to great effect. And don't overlook
the guys  Peter Sarsgaard and Brendan Sexton III are skilled enough to
humanize their characters, making their outbursts all the more chilling.
"Boys Don't Cry" is difficult to watch, but I hope you'll make the trip.
In addition to seeing a hell of a good movie, you'll get a tour of the
darker portions of our societal landscape, where monsters in baseball
caps cruise the streets, striking out blindly at anything they do not
understand.

Rated on a 4-star scale
Screening venue: Cornerhouse (Manchester)
Released in the UK by Fox on 21 April, 2000; certificate 18; 118 minutes; 
country of origin USA; aspect ratio 1.85:1
Directed by Kimberly Pierce; produced by John Hart, Jeff Sharp, Eva Kolodner, 
Christine Vachon.
Written by Andy Bienen, Kimberly Pierce.
Photographed by Jim Denault; edited by Tracy Granger, Lee Percy.
"Boys Don't Cry" is a harsh and penetrating study of heartland America, 
powerful enough to earn comparison with "At Close Range" and "The Onion 
Field", two brilliant deliberately messy films about emotional devastation. 
Its early scenes inspire impatience -- they don't seem to be going anywhere, 
and nothing is happening. Then we realise that's the point, and that is 
astonishingly moving.
The film tells the true story of Brandon Teena (Hilary Swank), a guy from 
Nebraska who was actually a girl named Teena Brandon in drag. This is not 
someone merely uncomfortable with his real gender; he's a rolling stone in 
every respect, moving from town to town, mixing with different gangs, 
constantly getting into fights and trouble with the law. He's also forced to 
move on whenever people discover he's not a real 'he', because people are 
always enraged by the deception.
Near the beginning of the movie, Brandon becomes determined to find stability 
among a band of white trash buddies from Falls City, because he falls in love 
at first sight with one of their number, the beautiful Lana (Chlöe Sevigny). 
Most of this group are sad, lonely people with no prospects, who try to 
distract themselves into thinking they're doing something with their lives by 
filling their nights with loud, boozy bravado. Lana doesn't do anything more 
purposeful, but she is a quieter, more peaceful creature, who seems more 
aware of the rut she's in. Brandon is a meek, reserved presence as well, and 
he and Lana get involved in private moments that are quiet enough to allow 
them to talk. Finally they've each found someone to discuss their dreams with.
Does Lana know that Brandon is really a girl? Probably not, although when she 
finds out, it doesn't seem to matter to her, and she does her best to keep 
the fact from her pals. She's in love, and doesn't want to see the beauty of 
that crushed, even though it's inevitable that it will be, considering the 
terrible world that she inhabits. We can tell that Lana's ex-boyfriend John 
(Peter Sarsgaard), a jealous bully with violent mood swings, will eventually 
find out about Brandon's secret, and of course there will then be tragic 
consequences.
That's what "Boys Don't Cry" is about -- how it's impossible to lead lives of 
peace, meaning or value in an atmosphere like the one the film is set in. 
Everyone grows up miserable and confused, and then gets punished for being 
that way. Brandon had no option but to live a lie, Lana couldn't help but 
loving him, and John did not choose to be brought up in an environment of 
bigotry and rage... but their fates have been sealed at birth, and there can 
be no happy endings.
The actors give this startling intimacy. Nobody seems to be playing to the 
camera -- they simply live in their characters' shoes, in the midst of a 
meandering story structure, and then find themselves stuck, as things spiral 
out of control. No other film I've seen has made the problems of white trash 
Americans so real to me. This is not one of those movies where some slutty 
single mom goes across country to find herself, and the audience couldn't 
care less. It is desperate, gritty and animalistic, and by its end there were 
tears in my eyes, because all over America people are living and dying like 
this, and they are trapped, and will be for a long time to come.

It is no secret that America has its share of homophobia and racism abounding
in all corners of every state. I am sure in Falls City, Nebraska, it is no
different. The girl who passed herself off as a boy named Brandon Teena
probably knew that such homophobia existed but that did not stop him (I will
refer to Brandon as a male) from being true to herself. And so commences the
bristling, highly effective "Boys Don't Cry," a debut film by director Kimberly
Peirce based on a true story. An incredibly mesmerizing film, Peirce certainly
shows a gift for handling actors and raw emotions. 
The highly magnetic Hilary Swank stars as Brandon Teena, formerly Teena
Brandon, who moves to Falls City despite the hesitations and warnings from her
cousin. Brandon makes fast friends in Falls City with some beer-swilling,
truck-driving, pot-smoking young people. Two of them (Peter Saarsgard and
Brendan Sexton III) are former jail buddies with nothing on their minds except
drinking and putting their hands through flames. But there is one Brandon has
his eye on - the dour-looking female teen who loves karaoke, Lana (Chloe
Sevigny). She drinks heavily and works in a factory, but is immediately smitten
by Brandon because he is so unlike any other males she has encountered in this
dead-end town. Brandon respects her, and suddenly, Lana seems to overcome her
sullenness and becomes full of life - as if a diamond had sprung and sparkled
her sensibilities. 
Brandon has a troubled past to contend with, however, and it inevitably catches
up with him. He has robbed, cheated and lied but all for a positive cause in a
way, to stay true to himself. Brandon wants to do away with girlish
sensibilities - he cuts his hair short and places a sock in between his legs.
And he gets away with it! He asks girls out in roller-skating rinks and treats
them like queens. Lana is the latest girl to be comforted by Brandon, and even
if there is the danger of her finding out what his real gender is, we know she
will still love him. 
"Boys Don't Cry" has two magnificent performances that will touch the heart and
rivet the soul. Hilary Swank is clearly amazing in that she looks like a boy
and we respond to her as such - her beaming smile glows and makes Brandon that
much more sympathetic a character. We know there is an inevitable tragedy he
will face, and so the tension builds because Brandon means well and is
harmless. 
Chloe Sevigny also undergoes a miraculous transformation, from her binge
drinking habits and dourness to a pleasing beauty with an angelic face waiting
to be loved. Ever since her dramatic turns in "Kids" and "Trees Lounge," I have
fallen in love with Chloe - her presence evokes compassion, much like the late
Audrey Hepburn. It is a quality unheard of in most young actresses today, but
Chloe has it down pat.
"Boys Don't Cry" is raw and painful, and is not intended for general audiences,
but those who can deal with the subject matter will be rewarded with the
performances of Swank and Sevigny. They embody the film with sweetness and raw,
naked emotion - their relationship is as real as any love story I have seen of
late. If I have any complaints about the film, it is only that I wished to see
how Brandon tried to adapt from day-to-day as a boy - there is one scene where
he has to buy tampons but otherwise, he seems to be able to deal with the
situation remarkably well. Still, director Peirce knows that the heart of the
film is Brandon, the rebel without a cause. His only concern is to have a sex
operation and to live with Lana in Memphis. He has ambitions and dreams ("You
hallucinate 24 hours a day," says one character about Brandon) but his main
focus is to be free and to live. The fact that he couldn't is what makes "Boys
Don't Cry" such a moving, poetic experience.

BOYS DON'T CRY (R).  
(Twentieth Century Fox)
Director: Kimberly Peirce
Stars: Hilary Swank, Chloe Sevigny, Peter Sarsgaard, Brendan Sexton III, 
Alison Folland, Alicia Gornason, Matt McGrath, Rob Campbell, Jeanetta Arnette
Running time: 114 minutes.
Like the recent Ma Vie En Rose, Boys Don't Cry is a
confronting and disturbing, but compelling look at a confused teenager
who chooses to live life on their own terms, contrary to the accepted
norms of the larger society around them.
Boys Don't Cry tells the true story of Teena Brandon, a
disaffected, tomboyish teenage girl from Nebraska, suffering from a
serious crisis of sexual identity.  She switched genders to live life
as a boy, and was eventually murdered by a couple of bigoted,
homophobic thugs.  Wrapping her breasts in bandages, stuffing a sock
down the front of her jeans, and calling herself Brandon, she moved
away from her hometown of Lincoln, in the conservative heartland of
America's midwest. Arriving in nearby Falls City, Brandon begins her
new life as a boy, a sort of rebel without a penis.
A bar room brawl leads to a friendship with Candace (Alicia
Goranson) and Kate (Allison Folland, from All Over Me, etc), and
ex-cons John (Peter Sarsgaard, from Dead Man Walking, etc) and Tom
(Brendan Sexton III, from Hurricane Streets, etc).  Brandon fabricates
details about his past life, which are at first accepted by his new
friends.
But it is the lonely and insecure Lana (Chloe Sevigny, from
Kids, etc), who dreams of becoming a famous karaoke singer, with whom
Brandon develops a relationship.  Desperate for affection, Lana allows
the relationship to develop without question, even when John and Tom
grow suspicious about Brandon.  When Brandon's true identity and
secret is revealed, fear and ignorance give way to unthinking hatred
and violence.
In exploring the hypocrisy of modern America, the white trash
of America's midwest, and larger questions about troubled youth and
sexual identity, this bleak and confronting film also occupies the
same seedy cinematic territory as Welcome To The Dollhouse and the
repellent Gummo.  In some ways Boys Don't Cry is a depressing and grim
film, but it is also surprisingly rewarding and inspiring.  This is
evident through the compassionate treatment of the difficult subject
matter and the occasionally sympathetic view of the sometimes uglier
elements of human behaviour.
For first time feature director Kimberly Peirce this has been
something of a labour of love, and she spent five years researching
the story and getting inside the character.  Peirce draws uniformly
strong performances from her ensemble cast, comprising some of the
finest young actors working in the American independent film scene.
Hilary Swank, best known for her role in the forgettable The
Next Karate Kid, has attracted a swag of accolades and awards for her
sensational and virtuoso performance here.  She beautifully captures
Brandon's androgynous quality, vividly portraying both the brooding
masculinity, the boyish swagger and the chiselled good looks, as well
as the more vulnerable elements of this complex and contradictory
character.  Sevigny is sublime as the trusting Lana, and delivers a
moving and memorable performance.  Sexton, cast against type, and
Sarsgaard effectively capture the latent violence lurking just below
the surface of their characters.
Boys Don't Cry is not a film that will sit comfortably with
everyone.  Peirce deliberately sets out to elicit a response from the
audience, and she succeeds.  Boys Don't Cry is one film that occupies
your mind days after having seen it.

        Hilary Swank's breakthrough, Oscar=AE-winning performance as Teena
Brandon dominates "Boys Don't Cry," a harrowing, true-life tale about a
20-year-old Nebraskan native who chose to live her life as a boy until her
grisly end at the hands of her so-called friends.  Kimberly Peirce's film
is a difficult one to watch, a study of small-town ignorance and the
prejudice it breeds, with Swank truly remarkable as the self-destructive
youth who drifts from bar brawl to bar brawl before descending on the
depressed rural hamlet of Falls City.  With little more to do than lie,
cheat, and steal the days away, "Brandon" hooks up with a pickup-full of
beer-guzzling degenerates, one of whom (played by Chlo=EB Sevigny in an
Oscar=AE-nominated turn) he falls for.  Swank's distinction is not just her
ability to play a boy convincingly--her deep-set cheekbones and angular jaw
give Swank a discrete physical advantage--it's the emotional depth she
injects into the role of a juvenile struggling with a self-confessed sexual
identity crisis.  Sevigny, while not required to compete with Swank in the
complexity department, is nonetheless crucial as the na=EFve Lana, whose
unenlightened friends finally discover Brandon's true identity and, fueled
by alcohol, hate, and pathological fear, brutally rape and murder her.
Teena Brandon's downfall was not that she chose the wrong identity but that
she opted to hang out with the wrong group of people.  And in "Boys Don't
Cry," a film that rarely pulls its punches, Hilary Swank masterfully
realizes the emotionally disturbing ambiguities which governed that final,
fatal decision.

WARNING: I dont usually like to give the plot that much away, but in this 
case, the ending has to be given away since most have already heard about 
what happens.
Rated R: strong violence, a graphic brutal rape scene, nudity, strong 
sexuality, language, drug use.
Starring: Hilary Swank, Chloe Sevingy, Peter Sarsgaard, Brenden Sexton III, 
Allison Folland, Alison Goranson, Matt McGrath, Rob Campbell, Jeanette 
Arnette.
"Boys Don't Cry" is a phenomenal story of courage, hope and ultimately 
tragedy. It was Teena Brandon, whom was known to her friends as Brandon 
Teena, a guy, who tragically died in 1993. This film follows Brandon from the 
first time he got his hair cut, to the last seconds of his life. It develops 
relationships between his friends, his enemies, and his love (Chloe Sevingy). 
The film is nothing short of astonishing, and after it was over, I sat in my 
chair, wanting to view the film again.
The movie as said before, follows Teena Brandon, a resident of Lincoln, 
Nebraska, as she makes the transformation into Brandon Teena, a smalltown boy 
who goes to Texas looking for some fun. While in a bar he meets a young woman 
named Candace (Alicia Goranson) whos family/friends start to latch onto to 
Brandon, and they all become the best of friends. Brandon meets Lana (Chloe 
Sevingy) who he instantly falls in love with. His buddies Tom and John 
(Brendan Sexton III and Peter Sarsgaard) are good with him, until they find 
out that Brandon is actually a woman. What once was a beautiful relationship, 
turns into an ugly fight for Brandon's life, for now since he is out as a 
she, they end up brutally raping her.
Before all this tragedy happened however, Brandon lives a happy life with his 
friends, and with Lana. The love of his life, whom he has an affair with, 
even though being a girl. He watched over her, cared for her and loved her. 
They wanted to be together forever, but Teena's life was cut short when she 
was only 21 years old. Tom and John after raping and murdering Teena, went on 
trial and are now facing the death penalty and life in jail, in the process 
they also murdered two more people including a young child.
The film is based on the a true story, and is that of a heartbreaking one. 
This movie like 1997's "Selena" even though knowing what happens in the end, 
you dread it. Brandon Teena was not a bad person, she was just confused. She 
had a disorder known as Sexual Identity Crisis, and didn't know any better. 
Hilary Swank brilliantly brings Teena back to life on the big screen, she is 
an amazing actress that in my opinion gives the best performance I have ever 
seen. She is realistic and tuff in her role to transform from a beautiful 
woman she is, to the man she protrays. Her performance is both insightful and 
brilliant.
The supporting cast is almost like a main character as well, since most of 
them share the same amount of screen time as everyone else does. The guys we 
latch onto then hate later, John and Tom are played fantastically by Brendan 
Sexton III and Peter Sarsgaard. They bring both of their characters out, and 
we feel as if we know the real guys just in the movie itself. Becky off 
"Roseanne" herself Alicia Goranson gives a great, mild performance, and seems 
to know who her character is and relates and brings the best out of her. 
Lana's mom played Jeanette Arnette is wonderfully over the top, but not over 
enough to become too trite, she brings all the good and bad things out in her 
character and perhaps the best supporting actress is Chloe Sevingy who is 
beautifully plays the character of Lana. She is so realistic, and so 
convicing as the character, that you start to actually see the whole film 
through her eyes, and how she saw Teena.
Kimberly Pierce wrote and directed this movie, that exceeds words of how good 
it really is. Its a heartbreaking, emotionally powerful, devistating, sad, 
moving film that has never has a film had such an emotional impact on me, 
that once it was over I actually interacted with who I am, and not who 
everyone wants me to be, or who I should be. The film convinces the audience 
by showing how brave of a man/woman Teena really was, and how she will 
influence people all over the world. If you feel like you are someone else, 
or need improvements upon yourself don't. See this movie and you will 
understand how much you can give up by trying to be the person you aren't.

This film, based on actual events, chronicles the story of Teena Brandon, a
young woman who passed as a man and was raped and murdered when her identity
was uncovered.  It is a fascinating and disturbing story, an unsentimental look
at the American heartland as a place of deeply ingrained intolerance.  Rather
than nurturing individual freedom, as the American myth would have it, the wide
open spaces of rural Nebraska make its peopleâs lives narrow and pinched.
Enter Teena Brandon (Hilary Swank), who reinvents herself as Brandon Teena. 
Heâs a fearless and outgoing little guy with a big buck-toothed grin. 
Getting into a barroom scrape with a man literally twice his size,
bumper-surfing under the power lines, racing another car on a dark and deserted
highway, itâs an exhilarating beginning to his new life.  His enthusiasm
proves attractive to the doe-eyed Lana (Chloe Sevigny), standing as it does in
marked contrast to the bleak hopelessness of her small circle of friends. 
Sheâs also attracted by Brandonâs simple kindness toward her.  Kindness is
something sheâs seen precious little of.
Trouble is not far behind.  Brandon lives by shoplifting and forging checks,
and is dogged by an outstanding warrant for auto theft.  Minimum wage jobs and
petty crime are the only future these misbegotten souls have to look forward
to.  Then thereâs John (Peter Sarsgaard), the young ex-con and alpha male of
the group who wants to protect Lana.  Clearly, the only one she needs to be
protected from is him.  Inevitably there is trouble between him and Brandon. 
Brandon, I think, sees it coming; he just doesnât care to get out of the way.
 Heâs burning his candle at both ends.  What follows is the heartbreaking
destruction of young life.
âBoys Donât Cryâ? stands in sharp contrast to the sentimentalized,
glamorized violence of âFight Clubâ?.  Stripped of Brad Pittâs movie star
appeal, fighting in barrooms and stealing cars begins to look depressingly
low-rent.  Unleashed rage leads not to catharsis and manhood confirmed but
rather to two corpses on the floor of a farmhouse in Falls City, Nebraska.

     It took five months for BOYS DON'T CRY finally to make its way to
Utah. Five months of bumped release dates (at least partially due to an
attitude, voiced by an unnamed Fox Searchlight representative, that "gay
films don't play there"). Five months of growing hype over the remarkable
transformation in the performance of Hilary Swank, who became a Best
Actress nominee as expected. Five months of building expectations for one
of the best-received independent films of the year, based on a compelling
true story. And after five months, plenty of opportunity for the film
itself to fall dangerously short of everything I wanted it to be.
     BOYS DON'T CRY is not a great piece of film craftsmanship. It's a
performance showcase, and a very effective one. The surprise, however, is
that the real showcase performance isn't the most talked-about one. Swank
stars as Teena Brandon, a native of Lincoln, Nebraska whose sexual
identity has always been a source of trouble for her. After numerous
run-ins with the law and fellow residents outraged by her behavior, Teena
flees Lincoln for the small town of Falls City. There she re-invents
herself as Brandon Teena, a young man travelling through town who falls in
with a group of aimless young people, including ex-cons John Lotter (Peter
Sarsgaard) and Tom Nissen (Brendan Sexton III) and John's 
sort-of-girlfriend Lana Tisdel (Chloe Sevigny). Brandon instantly becomes
attracted to Lana, and finds her receptive to his interest. But secrets
have a way of coming out, and when they do, Brandon faces dangerous
repercussions.
     At the center of the story, of course, is the mystery of
Brandon/Teena -- who he was, how so many people were fooled, what
Brandon's transformation represented as both threat and promise to the
other people involved in the story. Swank's physical performance is
superb, made even more effective by co-writer/director Kimberly Peirce's
decision to introduce Brandon already in male guise so the switch doesn't
become a showy trick. But it's hard not to be more impressed with the
physical performance than with what's going underneath it. There are
moments when you see the awkwardness of a girl trying to be one of the
guys, and moments in the harrowing final half hour when you see her
peering in terror through the cracks in her reality. More often, Brandon
is an enigmatic catalyst. It seems as though Peirce is more interested in
what Brandon stands for than in the person that was Brandon Teena.
     The upside to that perspective is that one of those people is Lana,
played with unnerving effectiveness by Chloe Sevigny. Lana is in her way a
more fascinating character than Brandon -- she engages in just as much
self-delusion, but her motivations are more complex. Sevigny plays the
small town girl with a dissolute resignation that gradually becomes faint
hope for a better life. It's the sort of role most actresses would play
initially with hard-edged bluster before unveiling the heart of gold
beneath; Sevigny shows a slightly different perspective of Lana every time
she turns around.
     Sevigny is part of a superb supporting cast, with Sarsgaard and
Sexton similarly refusing to play their parts for easy interpretation. 
The entire milieu of the Falls City youth has a heartbreaking genuineness
to it -- particularly noteworthy is how Lana's mother becomes "Mom" to
everyone in their desperation for any family relationship -- and Peirce
does a fine job of using Brandon to explore the effect of a nonconformist
on a place where reality is assumed to be static. It's the idea that
Peirce uses Brandon at all that dampens the power of BOYS DON'T CRY,
however. The chilling resolution and wonderful supporting performances
make it easy to recommend BOYS DON'T CRY. I only wish that five months of
focus on Hilary Swank hadn't led me to expect it would be the story of
Brandon Teena.

         Although it's not mentioned in director Kimberly Peirce's
wrenching "Boys Don't Cry," the real-life Brandon Teena worshipped Cher,
the singer-actress who has made a career out of her ability to change
her looks to suit whatever's in fashion. But gimmicks that may work
perfectly for a superstar with a reputation for outrageousness are a
good deal more difficult to pull off in the real world. That proved to
be a lesson Brandon Teena -- who was actually a woman named Teena
Brandon -- learned too late in the game.
 "Boys Don't Cry," which takes its title from a classic song by
the Cure, lays out the facts of Teena's bizarre life and horrifying
death frankly but sympathetically. Although Peirce and Hilary Swank, the
amazing actress who plays Teena, don't make apologies for their
subject's reckless behavior, they seem to understand the sexual
confusion and desire to be different that drove a young woman to remake
herself as a male. The movie has to address some fairly shocking subject
matter, but Swank and Peirce refuse to allow Teena's story to become
lurid or titillating. In other, less capable hands, "Boys" could easily
have become either a sleazy piece of exploitation or a sanctimonious
look at how awful the Bible Belt can be towards people who don't follow
the straight and narrow path.
 The film introduces us to Teena in Lincoln, Nebraska in 1993,
after her decision to disguise herself as a man. With her hair in a
crew-cut, her chest strapped and a confident swagger in her step,
"Brandon" looks uncannily like an adolescent boy and is so kind towards
the women she dates that such tell-tale signs as her stubble-free face
and her delicate hands go mostly undetected. "They say I'm the best
boyfriend they ever had," Brandon brags to a pal.
 But when this dreamy guy is revealed to be female, opinions
change quickly and Brandon flees Lincoln to hide out in the small
Nebraska town of Falls City. There she falls in with ex-cons John (Peter
Sarsgaard) and Tom (Brendan Sexton III), neither of whom suspect there's
anything unusual about him, perhaps because they're usually too drunk or
stoned to pay much attention to anything. "People like you don't need
drugs," Tom laughs as he observes Brandon's urgent desire to fit in with
the kids in Falls City. "You just hallucinate 24 hours a day."
 Brandon also attracts the attention of John's former flame Lana
(Chloe Sevigny), the kind of girl who seems to have developed a
bulletproof shell around her heart while still in her teens. Lana, whose
life appears to consist of partying, working on the line in a cannery
and cleaning up after her slovenly mom, finds herself gradually opening
up to the new boy in town. Eventually, their relationship will have
ghastly consequences.
 The movie would have fallen flat if we didn't believe in
Brandon's masquerade and kept waiting for the moment when her true
identity would be uncovered. Swank immerses herself so completely in the
character, however, that it's entirely possible to forget you're
watching a woman pass herself off as a man. Peirce assists the illusion
by setting most of the story in poorly-lit bars, shadowy living rooms
and dark backroads and alleyways.
 Reportedly, Drew Barrymore was anxious to tackle a different
project about Brandon, one which has since been shut down. That's
probably all for the best, since Barrymore is so easily identifiable she
would have had an extremely difficult time convincing an audience she
was anything more than a renowned movie star attempting a cross-dressing
stunt. Swank, on the other hand, doesn't have to deal with nearly as
many preconceptions (unless you're one of the dozen or so filmgoers who
saw her in "The Karate Kid, Part 4") and slips easily into the crowd.
 Although Swank's phenomenal performance is unquestionably the
centerpiece of the film, Peirce gets outstanding work from just about
everyone in her cast. In Sevigny's tortured eyes and rocky voice we
learn everything we need to know about Lana's background and, perhaps,
her future. When Lana naively talks about running away with Brandon and
making a career for herself as a karaoke singer, Sevigny allows us a
brief glimpse of the desperation and need for escape that Lana learned
long ago to suppress.
 Sexton, looking like a walking bruise, and Sarsgaard are
chilling as good old boys who are always a breath away from turning into
mindless, raging monsters. The acting is so electrifying it lends the
picture the kind of punch usually found only in documentaries.
Especially in its last half-hour, "Boys Don't Cry" is often
extraordinarily tough to watch -- much in the same way the truth can be
difficult to face. James Sanford

The untimely death of Matthew Sheppard in Wyoming a few years ago made
headlines around the world.  Sheppard was killed for no other reason other
than the fact that he was gay.  'Boys Don't Cry' focuses on the same subject
matter and reverses genders in its story of friendship gone terribly wrong
and is also based on a true story.  It attempts to follow a similar path in
the way it looks pursuant to the 1991 film 'My Own Private Idaho' which
starred  Keanu Reeves and River Phoenix.  That film was about a male
prostitute making his way around the country and finding whoever he could in
order to make a living selling his body.  While different from 'Boys Don't
Cry' in its subject matter, it still looks and feels very similar.
Actress Hilary Swank is scooping up virtually every major award for her
portrayal of Teena Brandon, a lonely ne'er-do-well that has had run ins with
the law and is struggling sexually to find her identity.  She tries to pass
herself off as Brandon Teena, a man, and falls in love with someone that
provides tragic consequences.  The film did disappoint me somewhat by
surrounding itself with American mid-western folks perceived as white trash.
Some, of course, are but there is good and bad in everyone and the film has
no positive characters in it, they are all deeply flawed individuals so this
makes the challenge of telling the story an uphill battle by putting the
audience in a very bleak story that will stay in their minds long after the
curtain drops.  The characters in the film smoke too much, drink too much
(which includes giving beer to infants), dress typically trashy and act with
little regard for self respect, let alone respect for anyone else.  I
suppose if the story is true, the right circumstances have to be re-created
but it still left me saying "*blah*".  The saving grace of this film is the
acting.
Teena Brandon (Hilary Swank) is seen near the beginning of the film fleeing
from rednecks that want to kill her after she comes on as a man to a young
teenaged girl and has to hide with a friend who will protect her.  She has a
date in court but may not show up which could lead to a bench warrant issued
for her arrest.
Teena Brandon now becomes Brandon Teena as she passes herself off as a man
and makes friends with some equally ne'er-do-wells.  There are Tom and John
(Brandon Sexton III and Peter Sarsgaard) and the girl Teena falls in love
with, Lana (Chloe Sevigny), who is the only person that truly understands
Teena and her performance is a great supporting effort with good chemistry
along side Hilary Swank and the two of them are Oscar bound.  They (all the
young, free-minded characters) joy ride without seat belts while drinking,
the girls wear too much make-up and look like they have had one too many
trips to the local donut shop and the mother of one of the girls shows
exactly where this bad behaviour on the part of her daughter and her friends
came from.  The film is a series of emotions expressed by all members of the
cast as Teena's masquerade begins to fall apart and many hateful and
eventually harmful things happen to her.
The film is progressively honest and doesn't hold one false note in its
portrayal of these people and sophomore director Kimberly Peirce (1994's
'The Last Good Breath') has found a raw and pinching nerve to rely on that
grabs the audience by the collar and doesn't let them go.  The film is bound
to generate controversy.  There is a rape scene that reminded me of 1988's
'The Accused' with Jodie Foster.  That film had Foster being gang raped
after teasing some men in a bar and some wondered if it was really necessary
to show the actual rape scene rather than imagine what it would have been
like for the victim.  Sometimes what we don't see on the screen can actually
be more powerful than what we do see if the actors can convey their emotions
and act out the stories they are telling.
The audience I saw 'Boys Don't Cry' with sat stone faced through its running
time.  I saw it at an art house with few seats in the theatre, and with a
crowd that obviously knows how to appreciate a small, honest and low
budgeted film like this.  Definitely not a mainstream motion picture, its
conclusion will be discussed for years among knowledgeable movie fans who
see the performances as a work of art and the work of true professionals.
There is Oscar buzz being generated and the cast deserves one big Oscar as
none of them do it alone.  Uniquely satisfying!
