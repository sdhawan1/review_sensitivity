"Claudine" is an intelligently scripted and directed drama.
The characters are generally believable and compelling.
The acting is excellent, even by the small children,
and the soundtrack is very good as well.
"Claudine" tells the story of an unwed mother (Diahann Carroll) 
with six children.  She is on welfare, has a job as a maid, but
is still so impoverished that no one in the family has
a car.  She develops a relationship with a garbageman
(James Earl Jones) who has reservations about becoming
stepfather and provider for her children.  Claudine has the
impossible task of raising her children properly, earning
a living, staying on public assistance which she clearly needs,
and keeping her lover satisfied and stationary.
The soundtrack is performed by Gladys Knight and the Pips, 
with the songs written by Curtis Mayfield.  The opening title,
"On and On", was a top ten pop hit in 1974.  The songs are
all very good.
James Earl Jones, a character actor who has become famous 
primarily for his deep and resonant voice, demonstrates 
in this film that he is also a capable leading actor.
I liked the characters of the children.  While sometimes tender,
they can also be selfish, bratty, and manipulative, just like 
non-celluloid children are.
The film's ending is a little muddled.  It's hard to tell 
whether the family is going to jail or taking a walk in the
park.  There is a confrontation between demonstrators and
police that somehow gets mixed up with the wedding.  Also,
how Jones plans to reconcile his financial problems with the
provider role is discussed but not resolved.
