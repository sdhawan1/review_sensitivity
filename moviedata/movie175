Being married to a musical genius can be a humbling experience, and Alma 
Mahler isn't the type who handles humility well.  She's a free-spirited 
woman who despises being relegated to the role of a supporting player in 
her husband's triumphs. 
BRIDE OF THE WIND, by director Bruce Beresford (DRIVING MISS DAISY), is 
a hurried, Cliff Notes version of the life of Alma Mahler, the young 
wife of composer Gustav Mahler and the lover of many other famous 
people.  The movie is saved by Mahler's sublime and ever-present music 
and by first-time screenwriter Marilyn Levy's sporadic flourishes of 
brilliance.  Sarah Wynter delivers an enigmatic performance as Alma, and 
Jonathan Pryce (TOMORROW NEVER DIES) gives a convincingly reserved 
version of Gustav.
The story, which spans several decades, starts in Vienna in 1902 at a 
time when conductor Gustav Mahler was very early in his composing 
career.  If there were a single thing that I could change about the 
film, it would be in the music mix.  Mahler was a powerful symphonic 
composer, but much of the film's wonderful background music has been 
mixed so that solo instruments overwhelm the rest of the orchestra.  The 
movie's most impressive moments occur precisely when the full force of 
Mahler's symphonic scoring is heard.  The best scene occurs when 
Mahler's opulent, horsedrawn hearse is pulled through Vienna as his 
music blasts away, mixed with rolling thunder from the storm brewing 
overhead.
Especially at first, Alma is not moved by her future husband's 
compositions, calling them "thematically disorganized and repetitive."  
An artist friend of hers reassures her that Mahler's music is "much 
better than it sounds," stealing a Mark Twain quote about Wagner.
Alma casts aside her current flame in order to seduce the shy and 
awkward Gustav, who has an undeserved reputation as a ladies' man.  An 
accomplished pianist and composer herself, she is asked by Gustav, as 
the price of a marriage ticket, that she abandon her career since there 
can be only one music in the family, his.  
Their initially happy life together is first shown being jarred by his 
proclivity for tragic musical compositions, as his one about the death 
of a child.  A few years later one of their two daughters dies, causing 
irreparable damage to the Mahler family.  This untimely death breaks 
both of the parent's hearts, and Gustav is diagnosed as having a 
congenital heart defect.
Alma seems inherently incapable of staying in monogamous relationships, 
but she does have a gift for attracting extremely talented men, 
including famous architect Walter Gropius (Simon Verhoeven), 
expressionist painter Oskar Kokoschka (Vincent Perez), and writer and 
poet Franz Werfel (Gregor Seberg).  A woman who doesn't take kindly to 
blending into the background, she appears to have made the wrong 
decision in marrying Mahler, or any man for that matter.  Still, her 
loyalty to a husband on whom she is cheating is fascinating.  When 
Gropius asks her to leave Gustav in order to run away with him, she 
turns him down flat.  She tells him that her husband needs her, and, 
after all, "He's Gustav Mahler!"  After his death, she increasingly 
worships him, much more than she did while he was alive.
A movie that is too often in a hurry to cover all of Alma's life, it 
does pause every now and then to offer tidbits of wisdom.  Oskar, who 
hates having to make love to Alma while the bronzed bust of the dead 
Gustav looks down upon them, tries to convince Alma that he is a more 
attentive lover than Gustav ever was.  After all, Oskar points out, he 
is willing to stop work in midday in order to have sex with her, 
something than Gustav never did.  When Alma replies that Gustav was too 
busy, Oskar tells her that "time is the money of love."
BRIDE OF THE WIND runs 1:39.  It is rated R for some sex and nudity and 
would be acceptable for older teenagers.
The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, June 15, 2001.  
In the Silicon Valley, it will be showing at the Camera Cinemas.

For those of you who couldn't get enough of Albert Brooks' 1999 film The 
Muse (and I know a lot of you couldn't, considering it didn't even recoup 
its $15 million budget) and thought, "Gee, it sure would be great if this 
were based on truth...and set in turn-of-the-century Vienna...and a drama 
instead of a comedy," then, people, I have got a film for you.  Bride of the 
Wind is a drama based on truth that is set during turn-of-the-century 
Vienna, and instead of its main character inspiring the likes of James 
Cameron, Martin Scorsese, Jeff Bridges and Meathead, she motivates real 
artists of that time. 
The muse is Alma Moll (Sarah Wynter, The 6th Day), the social-climbing 
daughter of a popular stage actress.  Bride opens, after some handsome 
opening credits that show old Austrian film clips, in 1902 Vienna, which is 
atwitter with the news that the great composer, Gustav Mahler (Jonathan 
Pryce, Stigmata), is taking up residence in their fair city.  Everyone 
rushes to kiss Mahler's ass, but Alma gets his attention by criticizing his 
music.  Mahler in intrigued, but tells Alma, "A symphony is like the world; 
it must contain everything."  I think Baz Luhrmann incorporated the same 
practice into Moulin Rogue. 
Mahler is easily seduced by Alma, and they eventually marry, but he forces 
her to give up her burgeoning music career to focus on things like balancing 
his books.  Alma squirts out a couple of kids, and after one of them dies 
she heads for the sanitarium, where she falls in love with Bauhaus architect 
Walter Gropius (Simon Verhoeven).  Alma still accompanies Mahler in his move 
to New York City, yet continues to yearn for Gropius. 
Then she falls for Impressionist painter Oskar Kokoschka (Vincent Perez, I 
Dreamed of Africa), whose first attempt at a physical relationship with Alma 
is greeted with a squeeze to the ol' twig-and-berries (she's some lady, this 
Alma). After Kokoschka, she moves onto left-wing author Franz Werfel (Gregor 
Seberg), who looks a lot like SNL's Darryl Hammond. Alma marries a few of 
these four men (it's honestly difficult to keep track of her latest hubby), 
and, although it's not shown in the film, continues to bed famous men. 
Alma's poor daughter, Anna, obviously confused by the carousel of men, just 
calls them all "Uncle." 
We're never really given a clear reason why she hops beds so frequently. 
Bride is, I think, supposed to show Alma as a pioneer feminist (and, indeed, 
the script was written by a woman, first-timer Marilyn Levy), but winds up 
portraying her as a flaky horn-dog who is easily bored with men. To make 
matters worse, Wynter isn't that great of an actress. Other than her cute 
pout (think Cate Blanchett crossed with Renée Zellweger, only without the 
talent), there isn't much going on, other than her willingness to 
participate in a lot of lingering sex scenes. 
Wynter isn't the only performer who disappoints. The usually reliable Pryce 
turns in a performance reminiscent of the great Frank Langella. It doesn't 
help that the story is poorly written and full of silly dialogue, or that it 
casually mentions major historical events as if they were an afterthought, 
like when somebody literally sticks their head into one scene to shout about 
the assassination of the Archduke. Given the short running time, I wouldn't 
be surprised to learn that the original cut from director Bruce Beresford 
(Double Jeopardy) was much longer and a bit more detailed but shoddily 
edited to a more reasonable length. And I'm not even sure you could consider 
Alma a muse. She's more like a starfucker than anything; an early ancestor 
of Bonny Bakely. 
And the title of the film, in case you were wondering, comes from one of 
Kokoschka's paintings. 
1:38 - R for sexuality and nudity

Susan Granger's review of "BRIDE OF THE WIND" (Paramount Classics)
        Remember Sharon Stone's character in Albert Brooks' 1999 comedy "The
Muse"? She inspired writers and other cinematic creators in Hollywood.  In this
film, Alma Schindler assumes that role in the cultural community of early
20th-century Vienna. As played by petulant model-turned-actress Sarah Wynter
("The Sixth Day"), she's the free-spirited young wife of composer Gustav Mahler
(Jonathan Pryce) whose sexual escapades were legendary. Her major lovers
included painter Gustav Klimt (August Schmolzer), architect Walter Gropius
(Simon Verhoeven) of the Bauhaus movement, painter Oskar Kokoschka (Vincent
Perez), and novelist Franz Werfel (Gregor Seberg), whom she married after Mahler
died - but she also toyed with her musical tutor Alexander Zemlinsky, singer
Enrico Caruso, composer Arnold Schoenberg, and writer Gerhart Hauptmann.
Australian director Bruce Beresford relies on Peter James's cinematography and
Herbert Pinter's production design, including artistic costumes and elegant
sets, in a valiant attempt to overcome Marilyn Levy's exposition-weighted script
and soggy, repetitive dialogue in a cacophony of accents. Although her story has
great dramatic potential, Alma Schindler's capricious motivations are unclear
and, at best, petty and shallow. Has her own creativity been stifled because
Mahler forbade her to pursue a career in composing? Is she a neurotic
pre-feminist, rebelling against Gropius's desire to keep women in their place at
home? Or is she simply a promiscuous adventurer, as satirized in Tom Lehrer's
song "Alma," concluding "The body that reached her embalma was one that had
known how to live"? On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Bride of the Wind"
is a glossy but floundering 5 - far better suited to a TV mini-series.
