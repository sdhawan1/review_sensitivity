   Does money change people?  If we go by Woody Allen's
latest movie "Small Time Crooks," the answer is a resounding
NO and a thunderous YES.  In other words, some people
stay pretty much the same when they come into the big ones,
while others turn their lives around 180 degrees.  When a
working-class couple married for twenty-five years suddenly
get rich, the woman of the house transforms herself while her
man is happy to be who he always was. This dissonance in
their relationship is the basis for not only the generous laughs
in "Small Time Crooks" but forms a more serious motif as it
creates at the same time a poignant rift in their relationship.
   As for Woody Allen himself, the more he's changed as a
filmmaker the more he stays the same.  After developing a
rep for light comedy with "What's New Pussycat" in 1965 and
parlaying his success with take-offs on such diverse themes
as crime movies ("Take the Money and Run" in 1969) and on
Russian literature ("Love and Death" in 1975), Mr. Allen
reached his apogee winning three Oscars for "Annie Hall."
With "Interiors," he turned briefly serious, to a Bergmanesque
study of a family of frustrated men and women.  After that, he
pretty much went with what he did best--light comedies of
manners, gently spoofing aspects of our family lives.  This is
just what Mr. Allen has afforded us with "Small Time Crooks,"
a lampoon which begins as a lowbrow caper piece only to
zigzag like "Zelig"--which was about a chameleon-like
character in his 1983 contribution to the comedy genre.
   "Small Time Crooks," filmed with an amber tint by Zhao
Fei and with Allen's signature soundtrack of 1920s melodies,
opens as Ray Winkler (Woody Allen) buys a box of
chocolates for his wife Frenchy (Tracey Ullman).  Ray, an ex-
con who is now a dishwasher, discusses with Frenchy
(formerly an exotic dancer and now a manicurist) his plan to
make it big so that they could flee New York and retire to
Miami.  Frenchy opens a small cookie store as a front to an
operation that sees Ray tunneling in the basement with his
partners in crime in their scheme to rob the next-door bank. 
When the strategy fails after a series of exuberant mishaps,
Frenchy's cookie store takes off, developing into a huge,
corporate franchise operation that nets millions for the
Winklers.  
   While Ray is content to be Ray, Frenchy soon puts
on airs in her aspiration to be accepted as high society.  Her
vulgar taste in home decor, however, prompts her to link up
with handsome, young art collector David (Hugh Grant), who
is to make her a class act by teaching her about fine food,
wine, art, literature, music, and travel.  Ray, on the other
hand, would rather have a cheeseburger than escargot and
playing cards with the boys is more his cup of tea than, well,
sipping tea with the elite.  As they grow apart, Ray spends
most of his time in the company of fellow lowbrow May
(Elaine May), whose emptiness upstairs leads the audience
to enjoy quite a few more belly-laughs.
   "Small Time Crooks" proves that you can go home again. 
While Woody Allen is laying on the theme, "Don't wish too
hard for what you want, because you may get it," he does so
with the genial flair he employed to direct movies that made
him so amiable during the sixties and early seventies, before
he turned to the more sober political agenda of "The Front"
and the obscure, depressing "Shadows and Fog."  If Allen
had attempted to continue with the caper theme, this film
could have been overlong at 95 minutes.  But he wisely and
surprisingly dovetails that facet of the story into something
greater, opening up the yarn to give us a look at the
phoniness, the pretensions, and the cynicism of the tuxedo-
clad members of New York society.  Correct me if I'm wrong,
but years after making a film about a middle-aged guy who is
dating "a girl who does homework," isn't this the first time
Allen has paired himself off romantically with a woman who is
older than he is (Elaine May)?  
   Everything gels in "Small Time Crooks," thanks largely to
the chemistry between Woody Allen and the remarkable
Tracey Ullman, who had delighted her fans for years as the
boisterous, fun-loving and forever-changing character on her
own TV show and is now made up to look a decade older
than her forty years.  For his part, Allen may not be quite as
good-looking as some others in his age group (Warren Beatty
and Robert Redford for example), but he's as youthful as
ever and gives hope to all of us that we may look shlubby in
our late-middle years but can keep the spring in our step and
the gleam in our eyes.  Because of the adept, multi-layered
story-telling present in "Small Time Crooks," we can better
understand at least one guy who won big bucks about ten
years ago in the New York lottery and said that his biggest
ambition was to go to Hawaii.  Why not Europe?  Why not
around the world?  This guy--his name is Lou, I believe--knew
long before seeing this movie that he would be one unhappy
rich man indeed if he followed the advice of the well-heeled
and famous.
Rated PG.  Running time: 95 minutes.  (C) 2000 by

*** (out of 4) After thoroughly enjoying Woody Allen's latest
lightweight comedy, a friend said something that makes it harder for me
to recommend it. He pointed out, correctly, that the movie has no third
act. It just ends. The structure is sloppy and incomplete.
That doesn't mean I suddenly enjoyed the movie less. I still found
Allen's comedy to be as funny as any of his recent comic successes such
as EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU and MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY. 
Ray (Woody Allen) is a small time crook who gets a brilliant scheme to
rent out a shop two doors down from a bank. He'll set up a front
operation, which his wife Frenchie (Tracy Ullman) will operate, and
he'll tunnel his way to the bank. The scheme goes horribly wrong, but
Frenchie's front operation takes off, and soon the small band of crooks
is making it big in legitimate business.
The plot is as sparse and as simple as that, which ordinarily would
leave a lot to be desired. However, in this case, a wisp of plot is all
that's needed, a simple setting against which Allen's cast of colorful
characters can react and play.
Each of the funny figures in this movie is dumb in his or her own,
unique way.
For example, Allen's character is blue-collar dumb. He has made a career
as a dishwasher. When he was in jail for a crime he botched, the other
prisoners sarcastically called him "The Brain," which he took as a
compliment.
Frenchie is low-brow dumb. She wants to be cultured and refined, but her
inborn taste is against her. Even with one-on-one lessons in class from
Hugh Grant, she can't seem to master the art of subtlety.
My husband Otto was dyslexic. The only thing he could spell correctly
was his name.-- Elaine May, as May
Frenchie's cousin May (played by writer/director Elaine May) is low-IQ
dumb. She takes everything at face value. White lies, subterfuge, and
personal secrets are all beyond her mental capacity. May delivers some
of the funniest lines in the movie with a perfect deadpan.
Just to round things out, Michael Rapaport, in a small role, is
"dumb-blond" dumb. He looks up to Ray "The Brain" and is eager to help
in Ray's latest greatest caper. While digging a tunnel he wears his
miners' helmet (complete with lamp) backwards because it looks cool that
way.
Allen's humor in SMALL TIME CROOKS is largely verbal. It's a style of
comedy that not many modern filmmakers do well. The Marx Brothers were
experts (except for Harpo, of course). But since then it's been a long,
dry spell. Only Woody Allen makes good, solid comedies where most of the
jokes are in the dialogue, and this is one of them.

Susan Granger's review of "SMALL TIME CROOKS" (DreamWorks release)
 The less you know about this romantic comedy gem, the more
you'll enjoy the continuous surprises that await you. Woody Allen, who
wrote, directed and stars in the clever caper realizes that - which is
why he keeps a veil of secrecy around all his projects. In this
Manhattan-based story, Woody plays an ex-con dishwasher with Tracey
Ullman as Frances "Frenchy" Fox, his stripper-turned-manicurist
wife. They concoct a half-baked, get-rich-quick scheme involving a
bank robbery that, as Woody puts it, leaves them rolling in
dough...but not the kind they had in mind.  Allen's theme revolves
around the old adage: Be careful what you wish for - you may just get
it. And his sly, observant script has more witty, literate dialogue
than you can hope to hear in a movie these days. There's no doubt that
Woody Allen is a comic genius, but his knack for casting just the
right actor in the right role is second to none. This film marks
Ullman's third teaming with Allen; there's a rumor that her role was
originally offered to Barbra Streisand - but Tracey's terrific.  Jon
Lovitz, Michael Rapaport and Tony Darrow provide slapstick comedy as
Allen's three stooges.  Hugh Grant lends an aura of sophistication as
an unscrupulous art dealer whose "lessons in life" aren't easily
forgotten and Elaine May almost steals the picture as an endearing
dim-witted cousin.  Production designer Santo Loquasto and costumer
Suzanne McCabe set a new standard for nouveau riche taste. On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Small Time Crooks" is a delicious,
delectable 10, one of the best comedies to come our way in
years. "Small Time Crooks" is filled with uproarious, contagious
laughs - it's big time fun.

        Every so often, and a lot less often than he used to, Woody
Allen makes a movie for the masses. "Small Time Crooks" is such a
picture. Free of the angst and stylization of many of Allen's recent
films, it's a cheerfully silly caper comedy that mixes in a little of
"My Fair Lady" and a lot of "The Honeymooners" as it breezes along.
 There's quite a bit of Ralph and Alice Kramden in Ray and
Frenchy Winkler, the couple at the center of "Crooks," and Allen and
Tracey Ullman spar and slander each other with an almost maniacal glee.
Ray is an ex-con who dreams of one last heist; Frenchy, a former
stripper (!) turned hard-bitten manicurist would rather play it safe.
When Ray accuses her of always shooting down his dreams, Frenchy snarls,
"You get the kind of dreams people get after they put opium in their
brownies."
 But eventually she's persuaded to participate in Ray's latest
scheme, which involves opening a cookie shop as a cover for a crime.
While Ray and his cronies try to tunnel from the basement of the shop
into a nearby bank, Frenchy whips up batch after batch of her unusual
taste treats (Chicken Chip and Tuna Mint are a couple of her flavors).
The scheme goes awry when the cookies become, quite unexpectedly, the
latest culinary craze. So Ray and Frenchy find themselves in the money,
although not in the way they anticipated.
 Getting refinement and culture is not so simple, even after
Frenchy employs art dealer David (Hugh Grant) to teach her the basics of
being a socialite. Soon she's memorizing the dictionary and using her
new vocabulary all too well. "I must asseverate she deserves accolades,"
Frenchy tells her fellow concertgoers after seeing a cellist perform.
 Allen essentially fades into the background and lets Ullman
carry the picture. Good decision: She's magnificent here, whether making
wisecracks in her best Brooklynese accent (of Ray's dopey friends she
notes, "they never finished kindergarten because they got drafted") or
flirting hopefully with the artsy crowd and wondering why they snicker
at her leopard-print outfits and her apartment filled with gold-plated
garbage. Allen's films are routinely scouted for Oscar-quality acting
(last year's "Sweet and Lowdown" garnered nominations for Sean Penn and
Samantha Morton) and hopefully Ullman's work will not be forgotten by
the Academy.
 The other standout performance here comes from veteran
writer-director Elaine May as Frenchy's astonishingly simple-minded
sister Mae, who has an uncanny knack for screwing up the simplest tasks.
Mae's face is almost always slightly tense, as if Regis Philbin was just
about to ask her the deciding question on "Who Wants To Be A
Millionaire?", and May gives her a delightfully twisted voice that makes
even throwaway lines sound like little jewels.
  Allen fans shouldn't head for "Small Time Crooks" expecting
the moral complexities of "Crimes and Misdemeanors" or the poignant
soul-searching of "Another Woman." Those were seven-course meals while
this is nothing more than a scrumptious dessert, one that should satisfy
the appetite of anyone looking for laughs. James Sanford

     Woody Allen always does his best work when he's both in front of
and behind the camera.  Small Time Crooks give us Woody once again as
the star, once again making us laugh by proving that he and only he
knows how to deliver the exact and peculiar cadence of his written
humor.
     An unabashed comedic fable, Small Time Crooks presents Woody as Ray
Winkler, an ex-con living in a New York rathole and scraping by as a
dishwasher.  His wife Frenchy (Tracy Ullman) does nails by day, gives
Ray a whole lot of lip by night.  And when Ray comes home with a new
"master plan" that promises to make them rich so they can retire to
Florida (the dream to end all dreams in Small Time Crooks), Frenchy
becomes a reluctant partner.
     The plan is this:  Rent out the closed shop two doors down from a
big bank.  Then tunnel underneath and into the bank, making off with the
cash.  Ray enlists his pals (including Michael Rapaport and Jon Lovitz)
and the plan is launched.  Frenchy fronts the shop with a cookie
business, which the fellas dig their tunnel.  It isn't giving too much
away to tell you that the bank robbery plan goes bust, while the cookie
business front becomes a smash success.  And that's just the beginning
of the fun.
     Small Time Crooks marks a return to fine form for Allen, who hasn't
really dazzled me in a long while.  While it hardly carries the depth
of, say, Annie Hall or Hannah and Her Sisters, Crooks is the flat-out,
wry, New York, Woody Allen-neurosis humor that we remember so fondly.
     As its star, it's oddly disconcerting for Allen to be playing such
a schlub.  Ray has no class whatsoever and is extremely stupid, despite
his prison nickname of "the brain" -- which Lovitz's character goes to
pains to point out was "sarcastic."  Woody Allen is a real-life
sophisticate, and though his character has all the obsessions you'd
expect, the man is a bit too smart to pull off a character this dumb.
     Ullman, on the other hand, really develops her role far beyond its
opening volley as a mere Julie Kavner understudy.  Taking the trampy,
former-stripper ditz character and breathing in layers of nuance into
the role is inspired acting.  I've never been a huge fan of Ullman's,
but this movie may make me a convert.  Also of note, Hugh Grant has a
memorable and dryly funny part as a "Dr. Dolittle" type who later takes
Frenchy on as a student of the high life.
     Acting aside, Crooks ultimately succeeds on the strength of a
wickedly hilarious script that proves Woody still has his funny bone.
This isn't some art-house comedy for high-society types, it's a genuine
crowd-pleaser that you can't help but enjoy.

Heeeeeeeee's back!  Woody Allen plays a vintage Woody Allen character
resurrected from his films of old in SMALL TIME CROOKS, a movie which he
also wrote and directed.  It is the starring role in the type of silly
comedies that first made him famous.  This one isn't in the same league
as the classic Woody comedies, which it mimics, but it is a pleasant
little movie that's as easy to listen to as Woody's signature jazz
scoring.
His script proves better than its delivery perhaps because the actors
seem a bit tired, like vaudevillians who've done the same routine so
often that they've lost their edge.
"What would you say if I told you that you were married to a very
brilliant man?" Ray (Allen) asks his wife, Frenchy (Tracey Ullman).
"I'd say, I'd have to be a bigamist!" she shoots back.  Frenchy is an
ex-exotic dancer, and Ray is an ex-con who currently makes a living as a
dishwasher while he plans a big heist.  Neither of them excels in brains
or class.
The movie's brief first act concerns the activities of Ray and his
cronies as they plan to tunnel under an old pizza shop in order to rob
the bank a couple of stores down.  As a cover operation, Frenchy turns
the pizza joint into a cookie shop.  The crime goes bust, but Frenchy's
cookies are such a big hit that she's vaulted into stardom as a "cookie
mogul."  Her empire is known as Sunset Farms, which she, Ray and his
two-bit crooks run on autopilot.  The rest of the movie revolves around
her attempts to get class and Ray's attempts to shun it like the plague.
With their newfound wealth they turn their lavish, new Manhattan
apartment into a garish imitation of a bad bordello with more gold than
Fort Knox.  Their home, Frenchy brags, has a rug with fiber optics that
light up in order to create just the right ambiance.  And their
outlandish outfits match the decor perfectly.
Clearly they need help, so they turn to
Wall-Street-broker-turned-art-dealer David (Hugh Grant).  Giving him
some hint as to her tastes, Frenchy says that she likes, "Rembrandt,
Michelangelo, Picasso -- you know, the boys."  David, somewhat
reluctantly, agrees to conduct a cultural crash course for them.  Ray
hates the idea.  "My idea of a good time is not opera and ruins," says
Ray.  "I get enough sleep at home."
In a direct parallel with Woody himself, Ray has quite simple needs.  He
just wants people to laugh at his jokes.  But when he tries them on his
sophisticated new acquaintances ("Have you heard of the Polish car pool?
Every day they meet at work."), they just stare at him without laughing
or even blinking an eye.
Eventually the movie ends as much because it just runs out of steam as
because the plot has reached its predictable conclusion.  Although it
has a few nice laughs, the movie never rises above forgettable fluff.
If you want to see the real thing, rather than this pale imitation, just
rent some of Woody's early pictures and savor what he once was capable
of creating.
SMALL TIME CROOKS runs 1:35.  It is rated PG for mild language and
innuendo and would be acceptable for kids around 8 and up.

"Small Time Crooks" is a funny little movie, which, considering the key
people involved in the project, comes as a bit of a surprise. It's been
a long time since I've associated writer/director/star Woody Allen's
name with anything other than a vague sense of creepiness. As for
co-star Tracey Ullman, while fans trumpet her versatility, I've long
found her brash, loosey-goosey affect rather cringeworthy as well. Yet
here they are; bickering like "The Honeymooners" in a comedy which
delivers a steady stream of chuckles.
Allen plays Ray Winkler, a schlubby middle-aged ex-con with a "great new
plan." Seems there's a recently vacated pizzeria a few doors down from a
bank. Ray will set up a cover business in the storefront, with wife
Frenchy (Ullman) selling her homemade cookies. Meanwhile, he and his
buddies (Michael Rapaport, Tony Darrow and Jon Lovitz, all sorely
underused here), will work in the basement, digging a tunnel to the bank
vault. Badda bing, badda boom, instant riches!
The scheme, of course, is a complete disaster, but Frenchy's cookies
become incredibly popular with New Yorkers. In a relatively short period
of time, the couple find themselves running a wildly successful national
franchise and the Winklers move on up to the Eastside, to a deluxe
apartment in the sky. While Ray is content living his usual life;
watching TV in his underwear and eating his wife's spaghetti and turkey
meatballs, Frenchy has lofty goals. She wants to become a refined member
of the social elite, even if means hiring smarmy art dealer David (Hugh
Grant) as her cultural tutor.
It's a simple concept  Ralph and Alice Kramden as the "Beverly
Hillbillies"  but it works. Woody Allen is the weakest part of the
equation, bitching and moaning in his usual fashion, but Tracey Ullman
picks up the story and strolls away with it, creating a solid,
sympathetic persona and building outward from there. Frenchy has a tart
tongue and tough mannerisms, but is remarkably susceptible to a few kind
words. Ullman imbues the character with a sense of cracked strength that
makes her vulnerability all the more engaging.
But, as good as Ullman is, Elaine May steals the movie handily as May,
Frenchy's cousin brought in to help with the cookie store scam.
Blissfully unaware that the business is just a front, May chatters
incessantly, always saying the perfect wrong thing at the perfect wrong
time. The veteran comic carries ditziness to a new plateau; May walks
among us, but lives in a completely different universe, a dreamy pastel
place filled with lounge music and stuffed animals. Elaine May takes the
simplest gesture and makes it hilarious  even if you detest Woody Allen
and Tracey Ullman, "Small Time Crooks" would be worth a visit for her
work alone.

Ray (Woody Allen) is a hapless criminal who hatches the idea to rob a bank 
with a couple of his buddies. His brilliant idea involves buying a run-down 
pizza joint next to the bank, and turning it into a cookie selling business. 
Ray's wife Frenchy (Tracey Ullman, playing one person, and one person only) 
would watch, sell, and bake the merchandise. At the same time, the men would 
work downstairs on digging a tunnel that should eventually pop up into the 
bank vault. Ray's very surprised when the plan fails, but is even more 
shocked when the cookies become a major success. People line up for hours 
just to taste them. Soon they have a multi-million dollar corporation on 
their hands.
Their company, Sunset Cookies, becomes a household name and an American 
cookie favorite. As we learn from a very funny mock episode of 60 Minutes 
featuring Steve Croft, each player in the bank robbery now has a part in the 
company. One man is in charge of transportation, and another head of safety. 
It appears Ray and Frenchy have the life and wealth they always dreamed of, 
but Frenchy wants more. To her, being rich isn't about the money, but about 
having class. It's things like books, food, wine, and a good vocabulary that 
matter to her. So she hires a scholar named David (Hugh Grant) to teach her 
the finer things in life. The couple begins to grow apart. Ray starts 
spending time with Frenchy's dimwitted sister May (Elaine May) doing things 
that echo their old life, and Frenchy thinks it's time to re-evaluate their 
marriage.
This film's packed full of wit and humor. The wisecracking Frenchy has some 
great lines and is a good match for Allen's style of deadpan comedy. One of 
my favorite scenes is a dinner party that Frenchy attends. She believes that 
memorizing the dictionary one letter section at a time is the best way to 
increase her vocabulary. During the party, she attempts to impress people 
with her sophisticated terminology using phrases like, "Her ambidextrous 
acrobatics were deserving of applause." She also insists on being called 
Frances instead of Frenchy. Woody Allen does a great job in his role. I truly 
believe that his best movies include him playing a character, and not 
himself. Woody gets to wear shorts in the movie, perhaps giving us more of 
his scraggly self then we wanted to see. Shorts notwithstanding, the guy 
stills makes great movies at 64 after writing forty films, and directing over 
thirty. He is a comic genius of our time. Another character I loved was May. 
Elaine May makes her dense role as Frenchy's slow cousin the hit of the 
movie. May never quite catches onto things, but is easy to love. She 
definitely steals the show. Also making good use of their small roles are 
Hugh Grant, who does his usual posh English gentleman thing while Elaine 
Strich recovers marvelously from the recent Screwed. The trailers prominently 
display Michael Rapaport and Jon Lovitz in key roles, but in actuality they 
are only bit characters. Regardless of how much screen time they get, all of 
the actors have staggering chemistry while on screen.
Woody Allen has created a movie that is sharp, smart, and clever. This 
amiable comedy succeeds in making the audience laugh. Adults will rejoice 
with the material presented. Kids may not fully understand the humor, but 
Small Time Crooks is perfectly appropriate for them too. Crooks becomes 
slightly contrived near its ending, but never to the point where it becomes 
too predictable. Small Time Crooks is a comedy about finding our place in 
society topped off with the traditional old jazz tunes that only Woody could 
select. This movie manages to be risible without being raunchy or disgusting. 
The film is a treat, and the perfect summer comedy alternative for adults.

_Small_Time_Crooks_ (PG) ** 1/2 (out ****)
_Small_Time_Crooks_ delivers small time laughs.  That's not exactly a
damning statement; the Y2K edition of the Woody Allen Annual Project is
good for a few giggles.  But that's exactly the problem--all there is to
be had are giggles.
Only a few of these light guffaws are to be had courtesy Allen the
actor.  He plays Ray Winkler, an ex-con whose job as a lowly dishwasher
doesn't exactly provide a cushy life for him and his fed-up wife, Frenchy
(Tracey Ullman), a manicurist.  Allen is in full, tiresome nebbish mode,
and he is matched in the shrillness department by Ullman, a talented,
versatile comedienne who sometimes gets so caught up in her characters'
quirks that any sense of humanity gets lost in them (which is the case
here).
So it's hard to much care whether or not Ray's big and none-too-bright
get-rich-quick scheme--to rob a bank--works out or not.  I'm not giving
anything away by saying they indeed to get rich quickly (albeit not in
the manner they had expected), and suddenly the Winklers are part of New
York high society.  Ray just wants to live as a regular guy, but Frenchy
wants to be one of those snooty socialites, and she turns to British art
dealer David (Hugh Grant) for lessons in class and refinement.
Grant's character is the umpteenth variation on the Brit gentleman parts
he has built his career with, but he's more appealing company than the
Winklers.  Then again, many of the supporting characters are more fun
than the leads.  Michael Rapaport, Tony Darrow, and Jon Lovitz are all
funny as Ray's partners-in-crime, but they virtually vanish after the
film jumps ahead in time on year.  Luckily, still prominently present
after the time gap is Elaine May, who plays the dimmest of the film's
cast of dim bulbs, Frenchy's cousin May.
As with all Allen films, there are a few good wisecracks and individual
gags (_not_ among them is a particularly forced bit involving a burst
water main).  But never do they come together into a filling whole,
making _Small_Time_Crooks_ a minor, middling effort from a major talent.

     Woody Allen has been riding on his reputation for several of
his most recent films.  After several good films in the 1980s,
crowned by CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS, his 1990s film crop seemed one
disappointment after another.  At least in my opinion, BULLETS OVER
BROADWAY was his only above average film in that time.  SMALL TIME
CROOKS is the best film he has done since BULLETS OVER BROADWAY.  It
still is a lackluster situation comedy that leaves one feeling one
has seen a Honeymooners comedy.
     Ray Winkler (played by Woody Allen) is just what the title
calls him, a small time crook.  He constantly bickers with his wife
Frenchy (Tracy Ullman), a former exotic dancer, who verbally bests
him at every turn.  Currently Ray has a plan for how to get big
money.  He knows of a bank that has an abandoned pizzeria just two
door down.  The pizzeria is for rent and he and some of his friends
intend to rent the building and to use the basement as a start point
to tunnel into the bank.  Frenchy tells him that he and his henchmen
are just too stupid to pull the plan off.  But she finally agrees to
provide a front for the gang.  She will run a cookie store out of
the building above the building where they are digging.  Things go
from bad to worse for the boys since none of them knows how to dig a
tunnel or to follow the map that tells them where to dig.  The
bumblers seem to make every possible mistake.  Causing even more
problems is the cookie-baking operation which is rapidly becoming
more effort than digging the tunnel.  The team brings in May (Elaine
May), a half-witted cousin of Frenchy, to help with the cookie
operation.  This makes things only worse.  Still an odd turn of
events leaves the Winklers with a great deal of money.  Suddenly
they are thrust into high society, but Frenchy is afraid that her
low origins have left her, well, vulgar.  She decides she and Ray
must learn about culture.  Ray feels more at home playing poker.
The issue will eventually drive a wedge between the two.
     Indeed, any plot which juxtaposes the nouveau riche with older
money will invite some interpretation as social criticism.  Allen,
however, is no F. Scott Fitzgerald and a 96-minute film is not the
best medium for such comparisons in any case.  We see a very small
spectrum of the old money people and their reactions to the
Winklers.  However most of the points made are subtle or blunted.
Whatever insights are gained are small payoff for even so short a
story.  The writing is at its best, and still not so very good, when
the Winklers are bickering.  This writing is not really funny, but
it is occasionally smart and the lines come fast.
     Tracy Ullman is probably Allen's best acting partner in quite a
while.  As the harpy-turned-social-climber she is the best thing
about this film.  Second best is not even Allen but Elaine May.  The
character May plays is by now a familiar one for her, but it is
still a pleasure to see her acting.  There are those who say that
the writing of SMALL TIME CROOKS is like the old Woody Allen.  It
does not strike me that way, but there is one reminder of the older
Allen films.  Once again Allen is playing a loser and that is really
what he does best.  It may not be the real Woody Allen, but he is at
his funniest as nebbish, not as a winner.  The film is full of
distinguished-looking people playing the denizens of high society
whom I feel I should have recognized.  I didn't.
     It is hard to walk out of SMALL TIME CROOKS believing I had
seen a film I will remember in another month.  For one afternoon
there was some amusement.  I rate it a 5 on the 0 to 10 scale and a
low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.

Directed by Woody Allen. Screenplay by Allen. Starring Allen, Tracey
Ullman, Hugh Grant. Running time: 98 minutes. Rated PG for mild language
by the MFCB. Reviewed on June 20th, 2000.
At his best, Woody Allen's movies are a vehicle not just for amusing
social satire, but also for meaningful insight into our mundane lives.
When he's on his game, even the most seemingly inconsequential scenes
carry a weight and purpose of unseemly magnitude -- recall the lobster
incident from "Annie Hall" for example. But when Allen isn't in top form,
these seemingly inconsequential scenes are just... inconsequential. Sadly,
it is this latter category into which falls virtually the entirety of
"Small Time Crooks", Allen's thirtieth directorial outing. "Small Time
Crooks" is a trifle of a film, offering just enough classic Allen to leave
the viewer wondering how good a picture this could have been.
Ray Winkler is, you guessed it, a small time crook. He's never been
particularly successful at the job but has an inflated sense of his own
skills. During the two years he spent in jail for a failed heist, the
other inmates sarcastically nicknamed him "The Brain". Ray took it as a
compliment. Ray and his even dumber ex-con pals Denny (Michael Rapaport)
and Tommy (Tony Darrow) devise a plan to rob a bank, by renting a nearby
pizza parlor and tunneling from the basement straight into the vault. Soon
they embroil others in their scheme, including arsonist Benny (Jon
Lovitz), who used to be a fellow inmate of Ray's and has beaten him to
the punch by leasing the pizza place first (his original plan was to burn
it down -- he tells Ray he put his kids through college that way); Ray's
wife Frenchy (Tracey Ullman), a former exotic dancer who reluctantly
agrees to act as the front for the operation by selling cookies; and
Frenchy's dimwitted cousin May (Elaine May).
But nothing goes according to plan. Ray and his accomplices find
themselves digging into everything but the bank, while Frenchy's cookies
are an astounding success. In weeks, customers are lined up down the block
and camera crews are paying the store a visit. Frenchy's cookie business
grows into a multimillionaire dollar snack food empire, and the Winklers
are rich -- legitimately. But while Frenchy embraces her new social
status, Ray still prefers spending his time playing poker and watching old
gangster films. When Frenchy meets David (Hugh Grant), an ambitious art
dealer who promises to enrich her culturally-starved life, it may mean the
end of the Winklers' marriage.
"Small Time Crooks" starts well. The opening third of the film -- the 
abortive bank job and the initial success of Frenchy's cookie store -- 
boasts a number of very funny moments. Much of this is due to the
excellent ensemble cast Allen has assembled, who are obviously having a
lot of fun. Consider Rapaport's Denny, for instance, who is put in charge
of promotion for Frenchy's blossoming business. In one scene, he is
interviewed by a reporter who wants him to explain his thinking behind
placing advertisements for the cookies in magazines like "Playboy" and
"Hustler". In a perfect deadpan, Denny explains that if men are looking at
the pictures and salivating, and then turn the page to see an ad for
Frenchy's cookies, maybe they'll think it's the cookies that are
making them salivate, and then they'll want some.
Indeed, the entire sequence of the boys' misadventures as they try to dig
their tunnel is very witty, and the highlight of the film. But things go
off the rails after that. As "Small Time Crooks" shifts its focus to Ray
and Frenchy's social ascent and resulting marital strife, the laughs
become fewer and farther between. Much of the humor is obvious and stale,
like Ray's feeble attempts at small talk at a dinner party. To make
matters worse, the great supporting cast established during the first act
all but disappears, and Hugh Grant's David is just too dull and
transparent a character to make up for the loss.
Things pick up somewhat during the final half hour, but even this sequence 
-- as Ray tries to rob a priceless necklace with May's bumbling 
assistance -- is really just pure sitcom stuff. The big problem with 
"Small Time Crooks" (apart from the fact that outside of the first forty 
minutes, it just isn't very funny) is that there are no real surprises.
Sure, Allen throws in a couple of interesting plot twists and the opening 
set-up is rather dissembling, but thematically "Small Time Crooks" treads 
awfully familiar ground. Allen doesn't seem to have anything new to say
with his story of the Winklers' rapid climb up the social ladder. The 
characters' personal journeys and their ultimate mutual destination is 
obvious and predictable; the only mystery is exactly how they get there,
and it's a tepid one at best.
Allen's direction is typically competent, and occasionally inspired. 
There is one scene, for example, which subtly but effectively illustrates 
the difference in attitude between Ray and Frenchy once they've become 
rich. Having spent the night out pursuing separate activities, they both 
return to their apartment building at the same time. He's taken a cab; 
she, a limousine. But overall, "Small Time Crooks" is just too sedate and 
ordinary a story to give Allen much of a capacity for directorial flair.
Both leads give good performances, with the extroverted Ullman generally 
dominating over Allen. Indeed, Allen looks frankly worn out through much 
of the movie, though whether by accident or design I'm not entirely sure. 
I've already noted Rapaport's enjoyable performance. Also very good here 
is Lovitz, who manages to tone down his more annoying tendencies but is
sadly underutilised.
In the end, "Small Time Crooks" feels like a decent idea poorly executed. 
Neither as funny nor as observant as many Woody Allen films, it does not 
strike me as likely to appeal much to either his fans or the general 
moviegoing public. It has its moments, but ultimately "Small Time Crooks" 
is a small time movie.

I'd sort of given up on Woody Allen after the majority of his work during
the 90s appeared to be more about getting "name actors" into his films, then
making original and quality productions (save for HUSBANDS AND WIVES and
BULLETS OVER BROADWAY). But don't look now cause the Woodman has returned to
his roots with an all-out slapstick featuring only one "big" name (Hugh
Grant) but plenty of funny one-liners!
PLOT:
A down-and-out dishwasher with a dubious past, comes up with a plan to clean
out a bank's vault with the aid of a few of his dim-witted buddies, and some
financing help from his gaudy wife. As a successful couple, the husband and
wife must then figure out how they are going to "fit in" with all the other
rich and cultured socialites.
CRITIQUE:
Welcome back, Woodrow! An easy predictable plot with funny, neurotic
characters and plenty of hilarious one-liners certify this film as one of
Woody's most accessible and entertaining of the past decade. Of course, it
helps if you are already a huge Woody Allen fan (which I am), but Dreamworks
knew something when they picked up this film, cause it is certainly does
pack many a guffaw, and is easily one of the more mainstream films of
Allen's career. Yes, fans of BANANAS and TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN won't be
disappointed, but I think most anyone looking for a few simple laughs laced
within a fast-paced and clever script will most likely enjoy this picture.
In fact, it is the film's first hour which probably holds the most bang for
your buck, with many audience members breaking out in large fits of
laughter. The second half slows the chuckles down a little, but even then,
enough smiles are provided to allow one to ease further into the film's
hokey plot.
Of course, there isn't much originality to the overall story, most of which
can be foreseen as the film moves along, but the characters are fun to
watch, Woody is his typical stuttering goofy self and the feel-good ending
will most likely satisfy the majority. I thought the conclusion was a little
too corny for my taste, but then again, I'm a jaded ol' critic, I am : ) One
thing to note is that the trailers make it seem like the film is all about
the bank robbery, when really it actually takes off from that premise pretty
early on. In fact, the three dum-dums who help Woody with the heist more or
less disappear about halfway through the film, as Hugh Grant enters the
picture. The standout in the cast would have to be Elaine May as the
not-too-bright cousin in the bunch, and Tracey Ullman, who nails her role to
perfection. It's also interesting to note that Michael Rapaport has finally
given up on his career as an actor, and affectionately embraced the odd
choice for a profession, playing the "doofus" in every other movie.
All in all, the film has plenty of laughs, delivers Woody firmly tucked back
in his humor saddle, and presents a story interesting enough, albeit
predictable, to satisfy all Allen fans, and even some of the rest of ya'll.

     In a way, it has been a sad thing watching Woody Allen grow as an
artist. I recall watching Allen as bumbling would-be thief Virgil
Starkwell in TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN as a youth every time it appeared on
local television; I remember the raucous laughter inspired by peeks at the
naughtier EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SEX and SLEEPER. This
was Woody before the more mature bittersweet comedy of ANNIE HALL,
MANHATTAN and HANNAH AND HER SISTERS, but also before the
look-Ma-I'm-Bergman phase of SEPTEMBER and ANOTHER WOMAN. In my heart I
longed for Allen to return to arrested adolescence in something besides
his romantic life, to a brand of comedy even solid films like MANHATTAN
MURDER MYSTERY and BULLETS OVER BROADWAY didn't provide. In my heart, I
longed for Allen to become Virgil Starkwell once again.
     I suppose I couldn't have asked for more convincing proof than SMALL
TIME CROOKS that Virgil Starkwell is, in fact, dead. Allen plays Ray
Winkler, an ex-con who's still got ideas about one big bank score. His
latest plan involves tunneling into a neighborhood bank from an adjoining
retail space, using his wife Frenchie's (Tracey Ullman) skill at baking
cookies as a front. Ray and his cohorts Denny (Michael Rapaport), Tommy
(Tony Darrow) and Benny (Jon Lovitz) struggle with digging their tunnel in
the right direction, but Frenchie's cookies prove to be a phenomenal
success. Instead of a bank score, the Winklers wind up with a business
score, landing them in the lap of luxury. And then the trouble begins ...
     The abrupt shift in plot from caper comedy to fish-out-of-water
comedy takes some adjusting, but it neither makes the film nor ruins it. 
Each segment of the film has its comic high points, from a broken water
main in the basement to an unhealthy obsession with finger bowls. There
are also distractions in each segment, including the faux-"Honeymooners" 
bickering between Ray and Frenchie and Hugh Grant's uncomfortable
performance as a fortune-hunting art dealer. As with most of Allen's
comedies of the last decade, there are just enough lively gags to remind
you why it's still worth looking forward to his films, and just enough
dead spots to remind you that he's just not the same.
     No shift in Allen's sensibility has been more damaging to his sense
of humor than the ever-increasing level of condescension in his films. 
Once upon a time, the jokes in Woody Allen's films were on Woody; he was
the neurotic bumbler whose every movement suggested he was not just out of
place in the world, but sometimes out of place in his own body. There's
one delightful moment in SMALL TIME CROOKS that nearly re-captures that
vibe -- Allen trying to slip away unobtrusively at a posh party -- but
more often the joke is on someone else. While Elaine May is amusing as
Frenchie's brain-dead cousin, she's also a walking punch line for Ray's
sense of superiority. When the film gradually becomes a lesson in being
careful what you wish for in case you actually get it, it's Ray's world of
simple pleasures that's held up as the ideal. Even when he's playing a
loser, he gets to win.
     I'd still rather watch any one of Allen's last dozen films (CELEBRITY
notably excepted) than the majority of what turns up on the local
multiplex screen. He's a smart guy who writes smart comedy, and he's
become an immensely gifted film-maker over his 30 year career as a
director. Unfortunately, you keep getting the sense that he knows it,
that he's grown so enamored of his ability to impress that he forgets what
an incredible gift he has simply to make us laugh. There's a sequence in
SMALL TIME CROOKS in which the film's characters are interviewed by "60
Minutes'" Steve Kroft for a newsmagazine story. There's some funny stuff
in that sequence, but it kept reminding me of the documentary style of
TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN. In SMALL TIME CROOKS, it's almost as though Allen
is trying to appease those aliens from STARDUST MEMORIES who cracked wise
about enjoying his "early, funny" films. Yet even when he's turning out a
passably entertaining comedy, it's clear he just doesn't have any Virgil
Starkwell left in him.

Heeeeeeeee's back!  Woody Allen plays a vintage Woody Allen character
resurrected from his films of old in SMALL TIME CROOKS, a movie which he
also wrote and directed.  It is the starring role in the type of silly
comedies that first made him famous.  This one isn't in the same league
as the classic Woody comedies, which it mimics, but it is a pleasant
little movie that's as easy to listen to as Woody's signature jazz
scoring.
His script proves better than its delivery perhaps because the actors
seem a bit tired, like vaudevillians who've done the same routine so
often that they've lost their edge.
"What would you say if I told you that you were married to a very
brilliant man?" Ray (Allen) asks his wife, Frenchy (Tracey Ullman).
"I'd say, I'd have to be a bigamist!" she shoots back.  Frenchy is an
ex-exotic dancer, and Ray is an ex-con who currently makes a living as a
dishwasher while he plans a big heist.  Neither of them excels in brains
or class.
The movie's brief first act concerns the activities of Ray and his
cronies as they plan to tunnel under an old pizza shop in order to rob
the bank a couple of stores down.  As a cover operation, Frenchy turns
the pizza joint into a cookie shop.  The crime goes bust, but Frenchy's
cookies are such a big hit that she's vaulted into stardom as a "cookie
mogul."  Her empire is known as Sunset Farms, which she, Ray and his
two-bit crooks run on autopilot.  The rest of the movie revolves around
her attempts to get class and Ray's attempts to shun it like the plague.
With their newfound wealth they turn their lavish, new Manhattan
apartment into a garish imitation of a bad bordello with more gold than
Fort Knox.  Their home, Frenchy brags, has a rug with fiber optics that
light up in order to create just the right ambiance.  And their
outlandish outfits match the decor perfectly.
Clearly they need help, so they turn to
Wall-Street-broker-turned-art-dealer David (Hugh Grant).  Giving him
some hint as to her tastes, Frenchy says that she likes, "Rembrandt,
Michelangelo, Picasso -- you know, the boys."  David, somewhat
reluctantly, agrees to conduct a cultural crash course for them.  Ray
hates the idea.  "My idea of a good time is not opera and ruins," says
Ray.  "I get enough sleep at home."
In a direct parallel with Woody himself, Ray has quite simple needs.  He
just wants people to laugh at his jokes.  But when he tries them on his
sophisticated new acquaintances ("Have you heard of the Polish car pool?
Every day they meet at work."), they just stare at him without laughing
or even blinking an eye.
Eventually the movie ends as much because it just runs out of steam as
because the plot has reached its predictable conclusion.  Although it
has a few nice laughs, the movie never rises above forgettable fluff.
If you want to see the real thing, rather than this pale imitation, just
rent some of Woody's early pictures and savor what he once was capable
of creating.
SMALL TIME CROOKS runs 1:35.  It is rated PG for mild language and
innuendo and would be acceptable for kids around 8 and up.

The top rated program on television is called `Who
Wants To Be A Millionaire?' Think about it; millions
of viewers across the world tune in a couple times a
week to watch someone else try to make a million
dollars (which, sadly, isn't that much anymore). Why?
`Small Time Crooks', Woody Allen's latest charmer, is
about a money-obsessed New Yorker who realizes that
there's more to life than striving to make the big
buck. 
Playing the money-grubber is nothing new for Allen; a
filmmaker whose first movie was called `Take The Money
And Run'. In a recent discussion at UCLA, the comic
genius (who says he was a poor student) claimed that
after being denied a spot in the NYPD because of his
height, he planned to become a bank robber. However,
fate turned him into a comedian, and he decided to
live out his criminal fantasies through the language
of film. 
In `Small Time Crooks', Woody Allen is Ray Winkler, an
ex-con dishwasher who lives a stable Manhattan life
with his wife Frenchie (Tracey Ullman), a manicurist.
The only things missing from Ray's world are
excitement and lots of money. So he decides to call up
his dimwitted jail buddies (Michael Rapaport, Tony
Darrow, Jon Lovitz) and plot a bank robbery. 
The plan is to buy the flower shop next to the bank,
run a business as a false front, dig a hole under the
bank, take the money and run. Their business is a
cookie shop in which Frenchie is the only employee,
baking all the treats. Her baking is so good that the
shop soon becomes wildly popular, with patrons waiting
in line for hours just to buy one or two cookies.
Because of the store's newfound popularity, a cop
starts to notice the drilling sound that seems to
originate in the basement. When the bumbling criminals
attempt to break in to the bank, the cop catches them
and asks for a piece of the action. So the bank is
robbed, and the Winklers are millionaires. And this is
just the first segment of `Small Time Crooks'. 
In an unexpected, clever move, Woody turns the tables,
changing the film into a comic study of the newly
rich. Ray and Frenchie are now wealthy and notorious,
living a life that is beyond stable, and gradually
losing touch with their relationship. Frenchie hires a
devious, strikingly handsome Brit named David (Hugh
Grant) to give the couple lessons in affluent
citizenship, while Ray would like nothing more than an
average lifestyle in which he can eat cheeseburgers
without feeling guilty. `Small Time Crooks' is
enjoyable Allen fluff, a film that is more engaging in
its first half, but more insightful in its second.
Film critic Andrew Hicks once discussed Woody Allen's
films, saying that `he also has quite a catalogue of
low-key movies that are entertaining but not
particularly noteworthy; movies like Manhattan Murder
Mystery' that get three-star ratings in every movie
guide you check - no more, no less.' `Small Time
Crooks' is one of his aforementioned low-key movies,
and it gets three stars in my book. 
Even in his 60's, Woody Allen is the hardest working
filmmaker in America, putting out at least a film a
year. He has gained the respect of `cinephiles' and
critics all over the world (and lost the respect of
good-natured people with family values), but has never
achieved financial success. The funny thing is that
`Small Time Crooks', which I perceive to be Woody's
admittance that one can't have it all (especially at
the box office), is Allen's first film of a three-year
deal with Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks company, after
years of making his films with independent studios,
and is doing pretty good business in the U.S. 
`Small Time Crooks', while not as entertaining as
Woody's superior `Sweet and Lowdown', should be a
breath of fresh air for his fans. After a short acting
hiatus, he again casts himself in the lead role,
perfectly evoking the Manhattan nerviness, which he
portrays so well. The supporting cast, featuring the
multitalented Tracey Ullman, fares quite well, and in
the end, `Crooks' is like watching `Who Wants To Be A
Millionaire?', except its more truthful, educational,
and self-affirming.

SMALL TIME CROOKS (director/writer: Woody Allen; cinematographer: Zhao
Fei; editor: Alisa Lepselter; cast: Woody Allen (Ray Winkler), Tracey
Ullman (Frenchy), Tony Darrow (Tommy), Hugh Grant (David), George
Grizzard (George Blint), Jon Lovitz (Benny), Elaine May (May), Michael
Rapaport (Denny), Elaine Stritch (Chi Chi Potter) 2000)
Small Time Crooks is a small time comedy, nourished by getting a fast
start off the gate with some pretty familiar comedy routines -- it
starts off paying homage to the Italian film "Big Deal on Madonna
Street," but it is not able to sustain that homage or carry on with the
fast-paced comedy hi-jinks after the first half hour, and what's worst,
it falls into a predictable way of telling the story, which ends the
film on a rather pedestrian note. This film had the look of something
made in a film factory, without an edge to the routine comedy sequences.
But to its credit...it had a lot of laughs in it.
It gets by because the characters are likable crooks and funny in a
moronic way, Woody and Tracy had some good chemistry together as a
lowlife husband and wife team, and Woody has that nebbish part down pat
by now which he has been living off for the last 20 years. He seems to
have given up being an artistic filmmaker (I doubt if he ever was
committed to being one, but he did like Ingmar Bergman's "Wild
Strawberries," and at one time attempted to make Bergman-quality films).
He is now best seen as a merchandiser of films, cranking them out once a
year with a banker's regularity. He's certainly no risk taker in this
film, knowing his audience and giving them what they want might as well
be his motto. He is banking on the audience cravings for a few of his
patented one-liners to give them a comedy fix until his next predictable
work. There seems to be no incentive for him to change now, as his
audience wants him to keep cranking out the same stuff he's been doing
for years and he doesn't seem to have any sparkle in him to do something
different.
Woody's an ex-con and dishwasher named Ray Winkler who has come up with
a genius plan to get rich. His wife Frenchy (Tracey Ullman), the former
New Jersey exotic dancer, immediately guesses -- you plan to rob a bank!
He asks her for $6,000 that he needs for his scheme to rent a vacant
pizza storefront and buy equipment to tunnel into the bank vault two
doors down. There are two other partners who come by with their share of
the money to go into Woody's brilliant scheme, Denny (Rapaport), a dumb
truck driver, and Tommy (Darrow), a dumb human being. Another dumb
partner will be added later when Woody finds the store has been leased
to someone who plans to open a flower shop. When Woody comes calling to
sweet talk that person out of the lease, it turns out that person is one
of his prison mates, Ben (Lovitz), who hoped to ply his trade of arson
for insurance, which he says helped him put two kids through college.
But Woody persuades him to give up that lucrative profession to become
partners in his more lucrative scheme.
Ray and Frenchy open up a cookie shop as a cover for the robbery, but
the cookie business takes off beyond their wildest dreams and becomes
the talk of the city, while the tunneling runs into brain drainage
problems from these inept crooks, providing the sharpest and funniest
comedy in the film: as they tunnel in the wrong direction, rupture a
water main with their drilling, wear their miner's hard hat backward to
imitate the stylish way some kids wear their baseball caps, thereby the
light shines behind them so they can't see ahead, and the final
stupidity, is when Frenchy's dumb cousin May (Elaine May), hired to help
wait on the customers in the now busy store, tells a cop about the
tunneling in the basement being a business expansion move. Naturally,
the heist fizzles. But the cookie business miraculously becomes a smash
hit and is franchised so that within a short period Ray and Frenchy
become filthy rich.
Here's where this sweet and silly story plunges off the comedy map, as
it tries to show how Tracy now wants to grow as a person and join the
highbrows and get some culture, but she can't because she still remains
a vulgar person inside despite her new outward trappings. While Woody
takes the opposite track, bored by his new life-style, wanting only to
get away from eating snails and go back to eating cheese burghers. He
also would rather go to Miami and be swimming than attending socialite
parties and going to the ballet and art museums. The running gag here is
how cheap their taste is in their furnishings, decorations, clothes, and
vocabulary, before and after becoming rich.
Into the picture comes David (Grant), an intellectual snob and an
unscrupulous art dealer, which is quite a combination. They meet at one
of their ritzy gatherings in their Park Ave. apartment to raise money
for charity. He is talked into becoming the teacher of the arts to
Tracy, but without her suspecting it, he plans to rip her off for huge
sums of money. In the meantime, he influences her to buy schlock art
that he can't sell to anyone else. The movie looses its caper focus and
shows how the Winklers' try to join the social elites and the problems
they run into, as their money can't seem to buy them happiness or
acceptance.
The couple will divorce, with Tracy going to Europe with Grant to get
some culture, but forced to return when her franchise empire crumbles
because her accountants swindle her. While Woody uses Elaine May's help
to steal a valuable necklace at a party given by some of his new
aristocratic friends.
This results in a fluff film, with a twisted message about money not
being important to the couple, which seems like an out of the place
message, since money is all the couple talks about and seem to care
about as a means for their happiness. But this is a film that will only
succeed if it can make you laugh and the message wrongly or rightly
perceived might as well have not been sent. There are just enough Woody
sight gags and one-liners to make this film keep its head above water...
for example, one gag goes like this:"Hey, did you hear the one about
that Polish car pool that met at their workplace!!!" That's one of the
many yuks you'll get with Woody's 29th film, which will soon lose its
place in the heap of mediocrity he is piling up after his 1970s heyday
period of Love and Death (1975) and Annie Hall (1977).

Woody Allen continues to make films his own way, and that is a major feat for 
an artist who has yet to have a major box-office success since "Hannah and 
Her Sisters." I am not sure "Small Time Crooks" will change all that, but let 
me be the first to report that it is one of Allen's funniest and most 
endearing films since "Bullets Over Broadway." 
Playing a loser for the first time since I can remember, Allen stars as Ray 
Winkler, an ill-judged bank robber married to his manicurist wife, Frenchy 
(Tracey Ullman). Ray has a new plan to change his life from his current 
dishwashing activities - to rob a bank vault by tunnelling from an abandoned 
store's basement. The idea is that the store will be turned into a bakery and 
Frenchy will run it, along with her cousin, May (Elaine May). The surprise is 
that the cookies they sell become the talk of the town, and so successful 
that Frenchy and Ray become rich. Only problem is that their taste in clothes 
and furniture is garish at best ("Go on honey, show them your collection of 
leather pigs," quips Ray). Thus, Frenchy enlists the help of a British art 
dealer (Hugh Grant) who will teach her about class and elegance, and 
education. Naturally, Ray prefers the life he had and gets the impulse to 
steal all over again by scheming with May to get a priceless necklace. 
"Small Time Crooks" made me laugh from start to finish, and I must thank the 
great writer-director Woody Allen (a comic genius, in my view). His sharp 
observations about these colorful brand of characters inspires many memorable 
one-liners, particularly the droll humor involving the typically relaxing 
charm of Hugh Grant and the high-pitched Ullman (some of it recalls the naive 
Annie Hall's dedication to reading more books and taking college courses). 
Also worth noting is the early appearance of Michael Rapaport (who was also 
in "Mighty Aphrodite") as a bumbling crook, John Lovitz as a possible 
entrepreneur who has burned down buildings to support his children's 
education, and the pleasant air of Elaine May's presence (she last appeared 
on screen in 1990's "In the Spirit") - she gives her character May a rich 
array of nuances and perfect comic timing. Her character begs the question - 
is she really smart or is she as ditsy and naive as we might think? The 
naysayers who feel that the 64-year-old Allen has been dealing with much 
younger female leads, such as Elisabeth Shue, will applaud the choice of the 
60-year-old Elaine May. Frankly, this is of little importance to me - I would 
still love to see Allen use Sharon Stone as a lead or foil.
Scrawny Allen is as always scrawny Allen, but here he has a slight edge ("I'd 
like to flatten you, just once") complemented with the adoration of his wife, 
Frenchy, and makes his character the most magnetic he's played in some time. 
Tracey Ullman runs hot and cold for me, but she gets to play a trashy, 
talkative, sprightly woman with an affection for her husband - we somehow 
know that things will work out between them despite her affinity for the 
suave Hugh Grant.
"Small Time Crooks" is not laugh-out loud funny (though there are many
sidesplitting moments but I could have done without the faux news segment) 
but it is smooth and refined, as we might expect post-"Crimes and 
Misdemeanors" or "Husbands and Wives." It is far more relaxed and kinder than 
Allen's early slapstick comedies such as "Take the Money and Run" or 
"Sleeper." I would love it if Allen returned to his more serious Bergmanesque 
period but as sheer entertainment and pointed humor, it is far more lively 
and less overstuffed than "Sweet and Lowdown" or "Celebrity." Small time 
business, to be sure, but you will have a grand time.

Review by Lars Lindahl (larsattacks@mail.com)
"Small Time Crooks" (2000) **1/2 (out of four)
Starring Woody Allen, Tony Darrow, Hugh Grant, George
Grizzard, Jon Lovitz, Elaine May, Michael Rapaport,
Elaine Stritch, and Tracey Ullman.
In Small Time Crooks, writer/director/star Woody Allen
heavily depends on irony to provide big time laughs.
In the beginning it works. A thief who hates the
thought of owning too much money, a plan made by a
couple to energize their relationship ends up
seriously endangering it. It's original, unpredictable
funat first. But after a while, Allen throws so many
ironic situations into the simple plot, it inevitably
becomes annoying and ultimately unfunny. What starts
out as a pleasant light comedy complete with a rapid
fire of fresh jokes and characters, ends in a dull,
monotonous manner that must end immediately. The film
just loses steam a third of the way through. 
Don't miss the first ten minutes of Small Time Crooks
or else you'll miss all of the excitement. Woody Allen
plays Ray "The Brain," a dishwasher (with a sarcastic
nickname) who used to be a thief before going to jail
for two years. But imprisonment did not change Ray. He
has his eyes on a bank and with the help of three
neurotic friends, he plans on robbing it, splitting
the money, then going to Florida. Renting out a store
half a block away from the bank, Ray's master plan is
to drill an underground passageway from the store to
the vault. In order to make the situation not look
suspicious, Ray begs his wife to act as a cover by
selling cookies in the store as the guys drill
downstairs. Ironically, the "cookie store"
unexpectedly becomes a popular and lucrative shop - so
popular that it makes them millionaires without having
to rob anything. The trouble is Ray and his wife, now
harshly thrown into the world of the high class, feel
uncomfortably out of place. Small Time Crooks dies
down just after the couple becomes rich. Except for a
few scenes, it's not worth seeing.
Competing this weekend against a totally different
kind of comedy, Road Trip, this one is more dialogue
driven and should attract older viewers. It's simple
and innocent storytelling (the movie is rated PG) is
reminiscent of older films and you have to tip your
hat to a writer who can make a movie funny without a
semen joke. I just expected Small Time Crooks to be
funnier, especially compared to the opening thirty
minutes when something actually happens. 
Two things almost saved this movie from eventual doom.
First, the cast does a brilliant job. Woody Allen and
Tracey Ullman are perfect for their roles; the
chemistry they share is especially unique - whenever
together they incessantly argue and deride but you can
still sense that they love each other. And with their
equally whiny and high-pitched voices ringing together
in a chaotic form of harmony, it's obvious this is a
match made in heaven. The supporting cast does a
fantastic job of playing a slow-witted but amiable
bunch. Michael Rapaport, Jon Lovitz, and Tony Darrow
are very funny as Ray's "we-didn't go to high school"
partners in crime. The only problem is that this trio
is terribly underused; they completely disappear after
the satisfying first act and we never hear from them
again.  Elaine May is a scene-stealer as Frenchy's
cousin who according to Ray is as dumb as a cow or a
dog. She delivers the most laughs with her inane
comments and questions, and the dumbfounded look
plastered on her face throughout is classic. The only
complaint regarding the cast is Hugh Grant. Being one
of the only other major characters in the final
two-thirds of the movie, Grant faces the burden of
having to fill the shoes of Ray's friends. He is
neither funny nor emotional and, supposedly playing
the bad guy, he isn't too convincing.  
The second near-rescue effort from failure is small
but crucial. Small Time Crooks has one of the few
trailers in a long time not to give very much away
from the movie's plot. Thanks to that, there was a bit
of unpredictability that made watching a little more
interesting. But not interesting enough to recommend.

Woody Allen, one of the most critically admired, but publically underrated, 
filmmakers working today, makes one film a year, and almost without fail, 
they are small, but memorable and well-acted, gems. Allen has a talent for 
dialogue and getting the best out of his performers (just look at Mira 
Sorvino's brilliant, Oscar-winning turn in 1995's "Mighty Aphrodite"), and in 
his comedies, is as quick and snappy in his wordplay as they come. 
Allen's latest picture, "Small Time Crooks," is the type of sharp-witted and 
smart caper comedy that you would expect from him, similar to 1993's 
"Manhattan Murder Mystery" and 1971's "Bananas," with a hint of 1977's "Annie 
Hall" thrown in for bittersweet measure. There is always a joy that goes 
along with watching Allen's films, and a comfort, too, due to their often 
similar format, each one an obvious tribute from someone who is in love with 
the movies as much as I am.
Ray (Woody Allen) and Frenchy Winkler (Tracey Ullman) have been married for 
years, living day to day and paycheck to paycheck (he as a dishwasher, she as 
a manicurist) in their Manhattan apartment. An ex-crook who once did time for 
theft, Ray is always dreaming of the most elaborate or crazy schemes on how 
they can get more money, and while a sassy straight-shooter who tells it like 
it is, Frenchy finds herself consistently going along with his plans, no 
matter how risky, because she loves him. So when Ray tells French about his 
latest, and most dangerous, plan yet, in which they are going to buy out a 
closed-down pizza shop so they can shovel through the ground and rob the back 
next door, she quickly dismisses the idea, but soon goes along with it. 
Partnered with Tommy (Tony Darrow), former cellmate Benny (Jon Lovitz), and 
dimwitted Denny (Michael Rapaport), they plan to cut the money equally 
between them once they get to it. In the meantime, to distract the public, 
Frenchy acts as a cookie maker in the front of the shop, and unforseeably, 
her baking becomes the overnight sensation of the city.
Switch to a year later, Ray and Frenchy's bank heist plans have fallen 
through, and
instead, they have become millionaires overnight, the owners of the most 
successful
cookie franchise in the area, Sunset Cookies. But as their wealth 
dramatically rises, Frenchy yearns to become a sophisticated socialite, while 
Ray still prefers the simpler things in life. For the Winkler's, their 
relationship, and their goals in life, have become as distant as night and 
day.
The pleasure that comes from watching "Small Time Crooks" lies prominently in 
its reliably fresh screenplay. Although some may falsely accuse Woody Allen 
of making the same basic movie over and over, that is far from the truth, as 
each of his films may have the markings of himself as a filmmaker, but are 
almost consistently satisfying and creative, a refreshing retreat from 
today's increasingly boring big-budget Hollywood movies. Allen not only has a 
way with writing intelligent characters, but he gives his top-notch actors a 
chance to truly shine and prove their talent. Relatively underappreciated 
actors such as the aforementioned Sorvino, Jennifer Tilly and Chazz 
Palminteri (1994's "Bullets Over Broadway"), Kirstie Alley (1997's 
"Deconstructing Harry"), and Juliette Lewis (1992's "Husbands & Wives") have 
all been given the chance to do superb work in recent Allen endeavors.
In "Small Time Crooks," the champion performers are Tracey Ullman, as Ray's 
wife Frenchy, and Elaine May, as Frenchy's dim-bulb, sweet-natured cousin. 
Ullman (an Emmy-award winning actress for HBO's "Tracey Takes On...") conveys 
a genuine delight for acting here, and is equipped with the second central 
role, not to mention the flashiest, in the film. Her fast-tongued line 
deliveries to Allen are often hysterically funny and honest, and while 
Frenchy and Ray are involved in a rocky marriage, both she and Allen 
believably seem like two people who are in love with each other. 
As with many of Allen's actors, Elaine May deserves a Best Supporting Actress 
Oscar nomination next year for her delightful, and lovable, turn as May, who 
is brought into the action when Frenchy (May's cousin) hires her to help sell 
the cookies while Ray and his comrades sneakily dig and drill in the back, 
dead set on finding their way to the bank through the ground. Ray and Frenchy 
figure May is so ditzy that she won't realize what is going on, but when 
asked by customers about the racket in the back, she blindly tells them the 
matter-of-fact truth. A climactic scene, set at the home of a wealthy couple 
(Elaine Stritch, George Grizzard) whom Ray plans to swap a highly valuable 
jewel necklace from, and who uses May as a coverup downstairs at the party, 
gains much of its momentum not only from Allen's comic timing, but from May's 
charm and effortless comedic abilities. In the only other major role, Hugh 
Grant stars as David, a British aristocrat whom Frenchy hires to educate her 
on art and culture. 
Despite its advertising, "Small Time Crooks" is not a film about a bank heist 
(that ultimately only takes up the first half-hour of the picture), but a 
truly winning comedy about a couple whose hearts lie in their small, but 
agreeable, lives, and the journey they must go through to realize that money 
is not the key to happiness. A simple moral, to be sure, but one that fits 
comfortably within the confines of "Small Time Crooks," Allen's first motion 
picture of the 21st-century, and, no doubt, one of his brightest and sunny in 
years.

Ray Winkler (Woody Allen) is an ex-con who now works a menial job and
dreams of a better life. His latest lame-brain idea is to rent space
in a store across from a bank and tunnel under the street into the
bank's vault.  Ray brings three friends, Denny (Michael Rapaport),
Tommy (Tony Darrow), and Benny (Jon Lovitz), into his scheme to help
him dig the tunnel. His wife, Frenchy (Tracey Ullman), and her brain
dead cousin, May (Elaine May), work a cookie shop in the space they
have rented to hide Ray's activities. The plan doesn't work quite the
way Ray intended. In fact, it doesn't work at all.  The group has been
so busy tunnelling they haven't noticed what a hit Frenchy's cookies
are, and they decide to turn the little store into a huge
franchise. Ray and Frenchy are now rich beyond their wildest dreams,
but it affects them in two very different ways. Ray somehow turns into
even more of a slob, wanting nothing to do with a rich
lifestyle. Frenchy has become so completely infatuated with her new
way of life that she hires an art dealer, named David (Hugh Grant), to
teach her how to act like her new wealthy friends. Soon Ray and
Frenchy are drifting down very different paths, and Frenchy starts to
think she may have outgrown Ray.
Let me start by saying that I have never cared for Woody Allen's
films, thus my opinion of this movie may be a tad biased. I've never
understood Allen's humor - like when Frenchy says something sarcastic
to Ray, and he responds with "I'm this close to popping ya Frenchy,
just one more word." It wasn't funny back when Jackie Gleason said
something similar, and it's somehow even less funny when Allen says it
now.  The only funny thing about it is that I think Tracey Ullman
could probably beat Allen up. I will say this, "Small Time Crooks"
actually starts off rather funny, with Ullman given a few amusing,
witty comebacks to some of Allen's dumber statements. In fact, the
first third or so of the film is really quite funny. Watching the four
bumbling criminals try to carry out their plan is uproariously funny
at times, especially when they break a pipe in the wall and flood the
entire store. Unfortunately, once they make their fortunes, and the
whole rags-to-riches story takes over, all the humor is sapped out of
the movie. I suppose Allen was trying to show the benefits of a simple
life compared to an extravagant one; but if that's the case, he failed
miserably. Both lifestyles looked pretty horrendous.
Woody Allen has always seemed to be one of the more irritating actors
in Hollywood. I think his stuttering over every word and bumbling
around like a buffoon is supposed to be funny, but here's the fact of
the matter: Woody Allen is too smart to play a stupid character. I've
seen him in interviews, and the man is too intelligent to convincingly
play a bumbling idiot.  This may be why he has surrounded himself by
characters even dumber than Ray.  Michael Rapaport ("True Romance") is
notorious for playing brainless characters, and he plays more of the
same here. Jon Lovitz ("Trapped in Paradise") is infamous for playing
irritating characters, and Benny probably would have been fairly
annoying if given more screen time. Actually, nearly the entire
supporting cast is stupid (I mean that in an unfunny way), irritating,
or both. The only exceptions are Tracey Ullman, in the film's first
half, and Elaine May (you remember, she wrote and directed "Ishtar"
way back when) as the hilariously dense May. If it hadn't been for
Elaine May's presence, I probably would have rated this film quite a
bit lower.  She is so likeable and naive that she can't help but make
the movie at least somewhat enjoyable. Last, we have Hugh Grant
("Mickey Blue Eyes"), who serves no purpose and seems to realize this
judging by the performance he gives.
The thing which most bothered me about "Small Time Crooks" was that
Allen leaves a dozen or so loose ends. Characters vanish half way
through the film and are never heard from again; romantic angles arise
but are never dealt with; and the ending doesn't tie things up quite
the way I would have liked.  There are numerous other faults, though
they are fairly minor. There isn't much of a soundtrack; some of the
scenes feel rushed (the first dinner party and the aftermath of the
cookie company being created), while others seem to drag on forever
(any scene with Hugh Grant); and the comic pacing is non-existent at
the film's midpoint. The film's high points are Elaine May, Ullman's
occasional smart-alec comments, and the attempted bank robbery.
"Small Time Crooks" does run an admirable 94 minutes at a time when
films running less than two hours are becoming a rare breed. Fans of
the old Woody Allen films will probably enjoy it because he's back to
his screw-ball antics rather than the dramatic pictures of the last
few years. If, like me, you don't care for Allen's brand of humor, I'd
suggest you skip this one. I give it three out of five stars.

>From Small Time Crooks' one-sheet, you might think the film is a kids'
movie.  It features a shadowy figure munching on a chocolate-chip
cookie, while the title seems to be a play on words, with the
implication that the `crooks' in question may be diminutive in height.
Relax, pedophobiacs  there isn't a child anywhere in Crooks.
Crooks starts off like a modern-day version of The Honeymooners.  A
dishwashing ex-con named Ray Winkler (Woody Allen) dreams of retiring to
Miami, where he wants only to swim and spend time at the dog track.  One
day, the former stick-up man hatches a plan to rob a Manhattan bank by
renting an abandoned pizza parlor on the same block and tunneling into
the bank's vault.  As Ray sees it, the only thing that stands between
him and his big score is his wife Frenchie (Tracey Ullman, Tracey Takes
On), a derisive manicurist that becomes immediately suspicious when her
husband brings home a box of chocolates before revealing his devious
robbery plans.  When she hesitates, Ray practically sends her to the
moon, Ralph Kramden-style.
Aiding Ray in his attempt to convince Frenchie to go along with his idea
are his two friends and cohorts, Tommy (Tony Darrow, Mickey Blue Eyes)
and Denny (Michael Rapaport, Deep Blue Sea), who are described as being
`so dumb that they never graduated kindergarten because they were
drafted.'  The three would-be criminals need Frenchie for both her
monetary contribution to their scheme, as well as to run the cookie
store that will serve as a front while the men burrow toward the bank
vault.
Of course, the bank heist doesn't go as planned, and the bumbling
burglars instead decide to franchise Sunset Cookies, which has become so
popular that they've hired Frenchie's dimwitted cousin May (Primary
Colors writer Elaine May).  One year later, everyone involved in Sunset
is filthy rich and are even interviewed by 60 Minutes' Steve Kroft in a
particularly funny segment.  All of this takes place in the Crooks first
half-hour.
The remaining hour of Crooks focuses on how money affects the Winklers'
relationship.  Ray despises being rich and longs for his old life back,
while Frenchie dives headfirst into Manhattan's high society, despite
having horrendous taste in both decorating and fashion (in other words,
she turns into Carmella Soprano).  Frenchie, a former stripper, also
hires an art dealer (Hugh Grant, Mickey Blue Eyes) to teach her to how
to become a more proper socialite by escorting her to museums and
performance art shows that Ray wouldn't be caught dead attending.
If there's one thing that Allen can do (besides writing fantastically
original screenplays), it's eliciting great performances from his
actors.  In his last film, Sweet & Lowdown, both principal actors (Sean
Penn and Samantha Morton) received Oscar nods.  Hell, he even made Mira
Sorvino an Oscar winner in Mighty Aphrodite.  And Crooks is no different
- the film features some of the best comedic acting that you will ever
see.  Period.  Crooks is also one of Allen's loudest films, with
cinematographer Fei Zhao perfectly capturing just how loud and gaudy
Frenchie's taste became once she came into money.
Crooks is Allen's thirty-second directorial effort, and the first he's
featured himself in since 1997's Deconstructing Harry.  Since then, the
sixty-four-year-old has appeared in several unbilled cameos (The
Impostors and A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries), provided the voice for
an animated film (Antz) and been the subject of a documentary (Wild Man
Blues).  It's also the second film that the prolific, twenty-time Oscar
nominee has released in the last six months.
