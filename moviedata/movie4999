How can a man so capable of loving manage to disappoint everyone he has ever 
cared about in his life? This is a question not easily answered in "Blow," a 
film by Ted Demme (1996's "Beautiful Girls") that is based on the true story 
of the rise and fall of George Jung, who was the largest provider of cocaine 
in the United States during the 1970s and '80s. As a character study and a 
drama, the picture is highly effective and always involving, succeeding in 
getting us to care about our protagonist, even while we question just how his 
life could have taken such a wrong turn. 
As a child, George (Johnny Depp) was brought up in a middle class family with 
a hard-working, caring father, Ray (Ray Liotta), and a nagging mother (Rachel 
Griffiths). Ray attempted to ingrain into his son's mind that money isn't 
everything, or even a sizable part, of what life is all about, but by the 
time he graduates high school and moves to a Californian beach town in 1969 
with his best friend, Tuna (Ethan Suplee), all that is on George's mind is 
how he can make a load of money without having to work for it. His ticket to 
the high life comes in the form of marijuana, which is generously provided by 
Derek (Paul Reubens), a friend of his stewardess girlfriend, Barbara (Franka 
Potente), which he begins to sell on the beach and quickly becomes the token 
dealer in the area. 
Seven years and several arrests later, George's drug of choice has switched 
to cocaine, which he learns about while in the pen, and quickly garners up 
millions of dollars in cash buying it from Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar 
(Cliff Curtis) and selling it in the U.S. While at his friend's wedding, 
George meets an alluring woman named Mirtha (Penelope Cruz), marries her, and 
has a baby girl that changes his life. Mirtha's tastes are expensive, 
however, and with an insatiable drug habit, George isn't sure if he will ever 
be able to get out of the drug business and give his daughter a healthy life.
"Blow" is the third motion picture about drugs in the last seven months (with 
the other two being the superior "Requiem for a Dream" and "Traffic"), but 
manages to differentiate itself enough to not feel routine or tedious. 
Whereas "Requiem" was a stark horror story of the way drugs destroy lives, 
and "Traffic" was a more technical mosaic of how drugs affect the entire 
world, "Blow" is a reasonably conventional docudrama about a talented man 
with infinite promise who ultimately chooses a lifestyle that ends up ruining 
his life, and every human relationship that has ever meant something to him. 
Putting George Jung's life into perspective, he really does not seem like a 
notable enough person to have an entire movie dedicated to him. Jung was a 
drug dealer, albeit a remarkably successful one, who had the law eventually 
catch up to his illegal actions. Much of the film is reminiscent in style and 
execution to 1997's brilliant "Boogie Nights" and 1998's misguided "54," both 
of which involved drugs but did not have them as the centerpiece of the 
action. "Blow," in comparison, finds a happy medium between the two--it isn't 
as powerful or expertly directed as "Boogie Nights," but has far more depth 
and intelligence than "54"--and concludes on a note of bittersweet tragedy. 
Johnny Depp owns the screen for every second he appears, which is more or 
less the entirety of the 120-minute running time. As George Jung, the 
34-year-old Depp is believable as a young man in his early twenties, and 
equally convincing as a 50-year-old in the final act. What is most 
impressive, however, is how sympathetic he makes Jung. We care about him even 
as we despise him for not cleaning up his act for good, and it is a testament 
to Depp that his character remains accessibly likable throughout. 
Ray Liotta, as George's loyal, if quietly disappointed father, is on a roll 
this year. With April only beginning, Liotta's has also been a standout in 
"Hannibal" and "Heartbreakers." In many ways, Liotta's portrayal is just as 
tragic as Depp's, as he plays an honest man who had high hopes for his only 
child, only to see him spiral deeper and deeper into an abyss. It isn't a 
large part, but Liotta creates the most clearly defined and heartbreaking 
supporting character in the film. A close second is Paul Reubens (1999's 
"Mystery Men"), stunningly deft in a rare dramatic turn as Derek.
The female counterparts include the likes of Penelope Cruz (2000's "All the 
Pretty Horses"), excellent as the ruthless, immature Mirtha, who dashes 
George's hopes of going straight; Franka Potente (2000's "Run Lola Run"), a 
radiant beauty in her first American film, as George's first ill-fated 
girlfriend, Barbara; and Rachel Griffiths (2000's "Me Myself I"), sternly 
poignant as George's stubborn, outraged mother.
Spanning five decades and accurately capturing the fashions and music of, 
particularly, the late-'60s and '70s, "Blow" is something you only find once 
or twice in the opening months of each year: a mature, emotionally resounding 
film that could have easily been released in December and garnered several 
Oscar nominations. It does not equal up to "Requiem for a Dream" or "Traffic" 
(both of which were nominated for Academy Awards this year), and moves a 
little too quickly through certain portions of George Jung's life (no doubt 
due to a desire to cut the film down to two hours), but "Blow" remains a 
more-than-worthwhile drama that confirms what a good director Ted Demme is, 
and what an unequivocal talent Johnny Depp continues to be.

"Blow" is based on the real life experiences of George Jung, once one of
the most successful illegal drug importers on the planet. Back in the
late '60s and early '70s, the psychedelic youth brigade of America
whiled away their free time peacefully with assorted hallucinogens and
all the marijuana they could get their hands on. Then George entered the
marketplace with incredible quantities of cocaine and the scene turned
ugly.
In other words, George Jung was the kid who spoiled it for the rest of
the class.
Jung claims responsibility for bringing in at least 85 percent of the
cocaine that entered the United States during the late 1970s. Hmmmmm. It
may be true, but then again, former vice-president Al Gore claims that
the lead characters in "Love Story" were based on him and his wife,
Tipper. And for what it's worth, I single-handedly popularized salt and
vinegar potato chips in the Midwest.
Regardless, Jung is generally acknowledged as the key American behind
the cocaine tsunami. After reading Brian Porter's decades-spanning
rags-to-riches-to-rags biography about the Uber-dealer, director Ted
Demme ("Monument Avenue") decided this was a story that must be
presented on the big screen. Had "Scarface," "Goodfellas" and "Boogie
Nights" never been made, he might have been right. But in the wake of
those movies, "Blow" is unable to overcome a "been there, done that"
feel. To be fair, there are perks to be had. Johnny Depp contributes a
fine performance in the lead role, a few of the supporting players are
decent and Demme offers some nice stylistic touches. Still, the
production comes off as little more than a variation of a well-worn
theme.
The story begins in George's 1950s childhood home in Massachusetts. His
father Fred (Ray Liotta) is a plumber with a strong work ethic and an
even stronger love of his boy, while his shrewish mother Ermine (Rachel
Griffiths) seems more concerned with her standing in the neighborhood
than with the well being of her family.
In 1968, George and his best friend Tuna (Ethan Suplee) move to a
California beach town, where they discover the joys of girls and ganja.
When their cash runs short, the boys decide that  get ready for this 
they could make money by (a drum roll, please) selling marijuana! The
film presents this as if it was the first time anyone came up with such
a concept.
George's stewardess girlfriend Barbara (Franka Potente from "Run Lola
Run") hooks him up with Derek (Paul Reubens), a sly hairdresser who
enjoys freaking out newcomers with his effeminate mannerisms. Derek
fronts the boys a bag of weed and, in short order, they establish a
lively business with the college crowd back in Boston, manageable
because of Barbara's ability to serve as courier.
Cut to 1970, where George and Barbara live large while operating out of
Acapulco, until George gets popped in Chicago with over 600 pounds of
the herb. He ends up serving time with Colombian Diego Delgado (Jordi
Molla), who hooks him up with the Medellin drug cartel. Bada bing, bada
boom, George becomes THE Colombian cocaine pipeline to the States.
Needless to say, there are complicating factors. Visits with the parents
are dicey, as Mom has a nasty habit of calling the cops on her son.
George creates ill will by wooing and eventually marrying Mirtha
(Penelope Cruz), the squeeze of a Medellin big wheel. Finally, George's
friends in the cartel are mighty interested in learning the name of his
main connection on the West Coast.
While the film has a number of powerful scenes, the story arc is just as
you would expect and, when the inevitable downfall begins, everything
drags. Demmes tries to jazz things up by using camera gimmicks common to
each decade of the story (faux home movies for the '50s, rainbow
zippiness for the '60s, washed out colors and lots of zooms for the
'70s, yadda, yadda, yadda). The visuals are moderately engaging, but not
enough to overcome the overwhelming sense of déjŕ vu.
The same goes with the performances. Depp is very good and Liotta
provides welcome support as the loving, nonjudgmental papa.
Unfortunately, to denote the passage of time, both men must wear fake
bellies that are, ahem, a bit less than convincing. Paul Reubens also
does solid work, creating a sense of playful wickedness in his
supporting role. The rest of the cast is comprised of the expected
stereotypes, with Griffiths and Cruz consistently annoying as one-note
harridans.
While "Blow" has a fair share of rewards, it is a decidedly minor movie.
Still, many early reviews of the film have been positively gushing. Why?
I can think of only one reason  when they saw the flick, them damn
critics were all hopped up on coke.

   "Blow" is one of two movies opening within a week of each
other (along with "The Tailor of Panama") that will be of
particular interest to one segment of the movie-going
population while disappointing another.  If "Blow" is an urbane
biopic about a major drug lord responsible for the majority of
cocaine that came into the U.S. in the 1970s and not an
updated version of "Scarface" as some might expect, then
"Tailor," while featuring a womanizing James-Bond sort of
feller, is more for lovers of chess matches than video games. 
The producers of "Blow" are intent on marketing the movie as
"based on a true story," the very genre that is often the
affliction of successful drama.  "Sticks too close to real details
to be compelling storytelling" is the usual criticism of biopics,
which often come across as cinema verite docudramas,
and "Blow" has its share of overly somber storytelling,
particularly when conveying the downward spiral of its
principal character.  Given the charisma of Johnny Depp as
cocaine kingpin George Jung, however, and the intense
unfolding of the yarn from his beginnings as an child in a
tension-filled household to a man who at one point possessed
a cash sum of over thirty million dollars, "Blow" is a must-see
for all who want proof that the greater the potential profits,
the more graphic the risks.
   Midpoint in the movie, George Jung's dad, Fred (Ray
Liotta), looks over his son's huge Florida villa, late-model
foreign sports cars parked outside with a staff of workers
keeping them shining, and asks George whether he's happy. 
Sure, the audience must be thinking, I'll bet we're going to
get the usual suggestion that happiness can't be bought and,
indeed, George has to hesitate before answering in the
affirmative.  But as this very rich young man looks back later
in his life--at the destruction of his fortune and the loss of his
only child's love--we understand how he would have changed
everything given a second chance.
   Though I had never heard of George Jung, known as the
most successful smuggler of cocaine into the U.S. ever
(having brought in a whopping eighty-five percent of the coke
enjoyed first by the beautiful people and then by partygoers
and addicts alike), Ted Demme's down-to-earth brand of
filmmaking shows us step by step how he rose to the top of
the white-powder kingdom.  As with any business, contacts
spell success.  Get to know the right people and you need
not bother with the Sunday New York Times classified. 
George's motivation to get rich begins when at the age of
eight he watches the plumbing business of the father he
adores go belly-up to the disdain of his shrewish mother
(played by Rachel Griffiths as a bourgeois beast from hell). 
Shucking the dismal, snowbound Massachusetts scene for
sunny Manhattan Beach, California in 1968 together with his
obese pal Tuna (Ethan Suplee), he fits right in with the
beautiful beach bimbos who all describe themselves as
stewardesses.  His contacts first with hairdresser Derek (Paul
Reubens) and ultimately with the biggest of the Colombia
drug lords, Pablo Escobar (Cliff Curtis) lead him from selling
marijuana to a weed-crazy college population to the purest
cocaine, favored by actors and their hangers on.  After
jumping bail in two separate instances, he hooks up with
party girl Mirtha Jung (Penelope Cruz), who loves him while
he's swimming in millions but doesn't want him when he's
down and out.  
   "Blow" lacks the intricate plotting of Steven Soderbergh's
more complex and thought-provoking "Traffic" but in a way is
of a part with Darren Aronfsky's "Requiem for a Dream." 
Though in no way as provincial as Brighton Beach's Sara
Goldfarb, George shares with the unfortunate woman the
effects of the wrong dream.  Filmed largely in the Mexican
states of Morelos and Guerrero to represents both the heavily
fortified digs of Colombian kingpins, directed by Ted Demme
with a sober respect for his subject and his audience, and
blessed with the magnetism of a man who may well be
America's finest young actor, "Blow" is a lively, trenchant tale
of greed, sin and redemption.
Rated R.  Running time: 120 minutes.  (C) 2001 by

In the '60's George Jung (Johnny Depp) was a small-time pot dealer with big
ambitions. When a fateful arrest for possession of 640 pounds of marijuana,
and being finked on by his own mother, puts him in Federal prison, he meets
Diego Delgado (Jordi Molla), the man who introduces George, and millions of
Americans, to the evils of cocaine in the true life story, "Blow."
"Blow" is a biopic with a difference. It not only follows the rise and fall
of George Jung, it also chronicles the events that led to the nationwide
epidemic of cocaine use and the rise of Pablo Escobar (Cliff Curtis) and
the Colombian cocaine cartel into a multi-billion dollar industry. George
may simply have been in the right place at the right time, but he did, for
a period of years, control 85% of the cocaine flow into this country.
Helmer Ted Demme, using a script by Nick Cassavetes and David McKenna of
Bruce Porter's true life saga about George Jung, bites off a rather large
chunk in a biography that spans five decades and introduces, literally,
dozens of characters as the episodes of the drug trafficker's life are
unfolded before us. It starts off low key with Weymouth MA-born Jung
leaving the home of his loving father (Ray Liotta) and troubled mother
(Rachel Griffiths) and relocating to California's Manhattan Beach in the
60's. To make some easy money, he starts to peddle pot to kids on the beach
and soon becomes known as Boston George. An old friend from the east (Max
Perlich) tips him that there is a lot of money to be made selling pot to
students in Boston. This begins a different spin on the American Dream of
profit and greed, as pot selling becomes pot smuggling, which opened the
door for the invasion of cocaine, a plague on America that lasted through
the 70's and 80's.
"Blow" is an ambitious effort that tells one man's story, episode by
episode, as George, several times, rises and falls, eventually losing
everything, including his beloved daughter
Kristina Sunshine. The inception of the cocaine biz in the US is shown in
high-octane spurts depicting the nuts and bolts of the dog-eat-dog drug
business. The human side of the flick is played through George's love for
his daughter, the product of a very bad marriage with Mirtha (Penelope
Cruz), a beautiful, coke tooting, bitch of a woman who uses Kristina as a
weapon against George.
Johnny Depp is given the daunting task of making a real person out of
George Jung. The talented actor is able to credibly span the 30+ years of
George's adult life, as Depp plays Jung as a likable salesman who is not
beyond taking a chance when there is a bunch of money to be made. George's
face shows the signs of age and wear and tear as the arc of his life
eventually lands him in prison forever. Depp gives sensitivity and
dimension to the character that sustains the bio portion of the film. This
is good as the rest of the large cast, due to the episodic nature of the
story, come and go in pretty short order.
Of the ensemble, a few are notable in their small but important roles. Paul
Reubens as George's partner and eventual betrayer, hairdresser Derek
Foreal, gives his role the appropriate flair it needs. Spanish star Jordi
Molla, as Diego, lasts quite a few years in George's life and develops his
character well. Rachel Griffiths and Ray Liotta give depth to their roles
as George's mom and dad. Franka Potente ("Run Lola Run") is only around for
a short time as George's girlfriend, Barbara, but the actress gives a nice
perf in the small role. Cliff Curtis is deadly as the ruthless Escobar.
Cruz gets to be a meanie and pulls it off as the selfish, drug abusing
Mirtha.
Production-wise, "Blow" does a solid job of giving each era of the story
its own period look and feel. Photography, by Ellen Kuras, is
straightforward without being overly stylish. Costuming, by Mark Bridges,
suits each period while giving George a particular, continuing style that
spans the years. The rest of the behind the camera techs are first-rate.
"Blow" is an ambitious effort that tries hard to keep its episodes flowing
from one to the next and succeeds most of the time. Johnny Depp, who also
voices the narration in a convincing Boston accent, is the one thread that
that is drawn through the whole tapestry and is good, but not great. The
movie works well enough on its two levels, though, and I give it a B.

PLOT:
George Jung is your typical middle-class kid from Massachusetts.
Unfortunately, he's got a bitchy mom but a nice dad. As a child, he
witnesses his father's struggles to make ends meet and grows up wanting more
out of his own life. As an adult, George generates so much cash at some
point, that his biggest problem becomes finding a place to store it all. How
does George go from being a lil' tike with a cool dad to one of the biggest
drug-runners in the United States during the late 70s, early 80s? True
story. Find out by watching the movie.
CRITIQUE:
Is this movie original? No, not really. Does this movie still give us a
great story, an intriguing lead character, an amazing soundtrack, plenty of
style, many a touching moment and an altogether fascinating cinematic
journey? Oh, definitely! "Ever since I can remember, I always wanted to be a
gangster!" is the quote that starts off one of my favorite movies of
all-time: GOODFELLAS. Now it goes without saying that this film will
unavoidably be compared to that film, SCARFACE, BOOGIE NIGHTS and many other
epic life-stories of little so-and-so's making it to the "big time". But
unlike most of those wise guys, here's a film in which the lead character
doesn't really want to be a gangster, but one circumstance leads to another
circumstance and the next thing you know, he's meeting with Pablo Escobar,
the biggest drug lord in the world. A very interesting journey, to say the
least. Here's a movie that gives you another intriguing story of a "regular
guy" who ends up in extra-ordinary circumstances, and with a little bit of
street-smarts, a little bit of charm and a lotta balls, makes something out
of himself. Mind you, I personally have always been fascinated with the
biographies of famous people, so maybe this story won't grab you as much as
it did me. But the actors are also all very good in this film, the high
style in perfect alignment with the previously mentioned flicks and plenty
of drama, bits of humor, betrayals and double-crossings (natch!).
Another thing that sets this flick apart from the previously mentioned
movies is its personal connections which are highlighted to us through its
lead character. A very deep father/son relationship is explored here and so
is the lead's love for his daughter, which keeps him going through some of
the tougher times (having recently had a baby girl himself, I could see how
Depp could relate more to this character). Ultimately, you will either be
interested in this man's story or not, and I for one, was quite absorbed and
entertained. The detailed progression of his beginnings, his rise and his
eventual downfall (I don't think I'm giving anything away here) are well
paced and convincingly strung together, with lotsa flair via the director's
eye, a groovy soundtrack, some entertaining side characters and a very
poignant ending. I don't think you should go into this movie expecting to
see something entirely different from the films mentioned above, because
they do ultimately resemble each other quite a bit in style, pace and
general undertone. But the personalities, the struggles and the personal
story behind this one is on a fresher tip, and it certainly grabbed me and
took me along for quite the ride. The word "epic" was made for this movie.
Kudos to Ted Demme for taking the material and turning into an entertaining
and touching vehicle, and to Johnny Depp for keeping me glued to the screen
with yet another solid performance. Although I do wish he hadn't worn his
sunglasses so much, since it didn't allow for the viewer to get into his
character's eyes. But alas...
PS: You also shouldn't expect to see much of Cruz or Reubens, who appear to
be billed much greater than their characters' respective appearances in the
film.
Little Known Facts about the movie and its stars:
This movie is based on the Bruce Porter book called "Blow: How a small-town
boy made $100 million with the Medellin cartel and lost it all".
When the film first started casting, actors John Leguizamo and James
Gandolfini were in talks to play Depp's good friend in the movie and his
dad, respectively. The roles eventually went to Jordi Molla and Ray Liotta.
>From where do you know the screenwriters of this movie? Well, David McKenna
is the man who wrote AMERICAN HISTORY X (9/10) and co-wrote GET CARTER,
while Nick Cassavetes is the son of the famous writer/director John
Cassavetes, who himself also had a role as one of the bad guys in John Woo's
FACE/OFF. He also co-starred with Johnny Depp in THE ASTRONAUT'S WIFE
(4/10).
One of Depp's earlier girlfriends in the movie is played by German actress
Franka Potente, who you will undoubtedly remember as the lead from RUN LOLA
RUN.
One of the producers on this project is none other than actor/comedian Denis
Leary. Director Ted Demme has directed a couple of Leary's TV specials,
"Lock N Load" and 1992's "No Cure for Cancer", and two films starring the
funnyman, MONUMENT AVENUE (aka SNITCH) and THE REF. Leary also hails from
the same state as the film's lead character George Jung: Massachusetts.
And yes, for anyone who's still asking, director Ted Demme is in fact the
real-life nephew of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS director Jonathan Demme.

In stark contrast to the hard-hitting TRAFFIC, which is constantly on 
message, Ted Demme's BLOW takes an entertaining, soap opera approach to 
the world of drug trafficking.  
Based on the true story of drug trafficker George Jung, the movie goes 
from his childhood to his 60 year incarceration in prison.  In a 
stretch, Johnny Depp plays George, who has said in interviews that he 
was ugly but that with his money and drugs, he could easily attract all 
of the beautiful women he wanted.  Not until the end when he is buried 
in prosthetics does Depp look anything other than terrific.  As always, 
his acting is dead-on even if he has trouble looking anything other than 
great.  George confesses that "my ambitions far exceeded my talents," 
something that clearly doesn't apply to Depp.
Growing up in Massachusetts, George's childhood is shaped by his 
cold-hearted mother (Rachel Griffiths), who always complains about his 
father (Ray Liotta) not making enough money.  Even though he works long 
hours, seven days a week, his father goes bankrupt.  "Money isn't real, 
George," his father tells him after he loses it all.  "It doesn't 
matter.  It seems like it does, but it doesn't."  George, on the other 
hand, gets a completely different message than the one intended and vows 
never to be poor again, no matter what it takes.
When George grows up, he leaves for the beaches of sunny California, 
where everyone is stoned and all of the bikini-clad women seem to be 
stewardesses.  He takes up with one, Barbara (Franka Potente, RUN LOLA 
RUN), whom he soon begins to use as a mule, carrying drugs from 
California to the colleges on the east coast.  A decidedly funny Paul 
Reubens (a.k.a. Pee Wee Herman) chews up the scenery as Derek Foreal, 
George's local drug source and a flamboyant, gay hairdresser.  When 
George moves up to the major leagues of the drug trade, he employees 
Derek as his west coast distributor.  "It's going to take longer to 
count the money than it did to sell it [the drugs]," Derek remarks after 
their first really big deal.
Once busted for dealing hundreds of pounds of pot, George is sentenced 
to a couple of years at Danbury prison, where he learns more 
sophisticated criminal skills.  As he puts it, "I went in with a 
Bachelors of Marijuana and went out with a Doctorate in Cocaine."  As 
George moves up the drug food chain and the decades change, the clothes, 
which are a lot of fun, keep changing with the times.
Being in at the early stage of such a hugely lucrative endeavor, George 
becomes so rich that he literally runs out of room to store his 
greenbacks.  At one point, he tells us in narration, he controlled the 
majority of all of the cocaine in the United States.
Prominently and beautifully featured on the film's poster, Penélope Cruz 
(WOMAN ON TOP) doesn't show up until well into the second half.  Playing 
an obnoxious woman who quickly becomes George's loud-mouthed cokehead of 
wife, she looks wonderful while trying to act and look bad.  Cruz is 
just constitutionally incapable of looking bad.  She does convincingly 
play a real bitch
Although it is an easy movie to enjoy, it isn't especially challenging 
or insightful.  The best part is the father-daughter relationship 
between George and Kristina (Emma Roberts), whom he wants desperately to 
be with.  Although it receives only a modest amount of screen time, it 
is their scenes together that most give humanity to Depp's 
characterization of George and to the movie itself.  
BLOW runs a little too long at 2:02.  It is rated R for pervasive drug 
content and language, some violence and sexuality and would be 
acceptable for high school seniors and older.

It might seem like a potential Oscar contender, especially when compared to
the rest of the slop released so far this year, but Blow just doesn't
measure up to the similarly themed Traffic, or the sweeping scope of Boogie
Nights, which also featured a male character's evolution from a naďve boy
into a cynical adult.  Instead of presenting a fictional Dirk Diggler, Blow
is the true story of George Jung, who became Columbian drug lord Pablo
Escobar's main U.S. cocaine distributor.
Blow's slick opening credits show the journey cocaine takes from the fields
of Columbia into Johnny Depp's nose.  Depp (Chocolat) plays George and
narrates the film as his character, who tells us the story of his life from
a federal penitentiary.  We begin with George's childhood outside Boston,
where his mother (Rachel Griffiths, Blow Dry) constantly runs away from home
and his dad (Ray Liotta, Heartbreakers) has some pretty serious money
problems, which we're led to believe is the motivation for George's career
choices.
When he's old enough, George moves to Cali with buddy Tuna (Ethan Suplee,
Remember the Titans) and starts selling pot he scores from SoCal's
burgeoning supplier Derek Foreal (Paul Reubens, Mystery Men).  Learning he's
a remarkably gifted salesman with an equally remarkable product, George
branches his operation out to the East Coast and frequently deals with
hundreds of pounds of herb he obtains from Mexican farmers.
After a bust and brief imprisonment, George promotes himself from weed to
cocaine, with the help of former Colombian cellmate Diego (Jordi Mollŕ).  He
works his way into Escobar's (Cliff Curtis, Bringing Out the Dead) Medellin
cartel, where he controls about 85% of the United States coke import
business.  George also meets, falls in love with and marries a hot tamale
named Mirtha (Penélope Cruz, All the Pretty Horses).  And then, predictably,
the wheels start to fall off.
The main problem with Blow is that the story just isn't that exciting.  It's
the tale of a guy I've never heard of and knew nothing about, yet it was
easy to see what was going to happen long before it did.  The ending is a
little too sappy (are we supposed to feel sorry for this guy?), and the
whole thing plays like a weak version of GoodFellas, but with a focus on
drugs instead of the Mafia.  It's director Ted Demme's (Life) best work to
date, but parts of the film feel like he's showing off, throwing every
cinematic technique at the screen and emerging a bit like a Guy
Ritchie-style showoff.
But there are plenty of positive things about Blow, too.  It's got all the
great music and silly clothes you'd expect from a period film like this
(Depp's hair gets more and more ridiculous as the film progresses - at one
point, he streaks through an airport looking like the twin brother of Urge
Overkill's Nash Kato).  Depp, Griffiths and Liotta do well with grating
Boston accents, and the makeup department does a great job at aging those
three characters (although they could have just used Skeet Ulrich to play a
young Depp).  This is Depp's best non-Tim Burton performance since Donnie
Brasco, and Blow also marks the American film debut of Franka Potente (Lola
from Run Lola Run), who plays George's girlfriend early in the film.
Blow was based on Bruce Porter's book and adapted for the screen by David
McKenna (Get Carter) and Nick Cassavetes (Unhook the Stars).  It's nicely
photographed by Ellen Kuras (Summer of Sam) and features some nifty editing
by Kevin Tent (Election).

The drug-dealing business has been shown time and again on film in great detail
- it is a business that has shadowed American films as far back as Frank
Sinatra's heroin addiction in "The Man With the Golden Arm." The year 2000 saw
the interminable ugliness of addiction in the tough-as-nails "Requiem for a
Dream" and the futility of the war on drugs in "Traffic." I still must ask this
one question: what else is there to say about drugs at this point that has not
been said? Well, "Blow" is fascinating for detailing how cocaine arrived in the
United States in the first place, and the picture is not pretty in telling it.
"Blow" stars the usually doleful Johnny Depp as George Jung, a drug dealer who
first begins his business by selling marijuana in Venice Beach. He hooks up with
his best friend, the portly Tuna (Ethan Suplee), and his new girlfriend, Barbara
(Franka Potente from "Run Lola Run") at a beach house - they all have no desire
to work real jobs though Barbara is a stewardess. A contact through Barbara, the
effeminate hairdresser Derek (Paul Reubens), helps establish George's business
deal as long as he can be a viable partner. Before you know it, they are
rejoicing in tons of cash and partying with petite, blonde women on the beach.
Deciding to make more money,  George considers extending their business to the
East Coast where there are some eager college students. Thanks to Barbara, she
can fly out there and sell the marijuana for big bucks. Of course, he gets
busted, as he does numerous times in the film and goes to jail.
In jail, he gets wind of the cocaine business in Colombia and George decides
that such a drug would make a killing in the United States. It sure does, and he
makes more money than he ever dreamed. He also has a stunning wife (Penelope
Cruz) who becomes addicted to all the wealth and all the monetary glory. There
is no end to it, but of course all good things must come to an end. Thus,
George's trusted friends become backstabbers, even his own wife. How can such a
business for one man turn itself upside down? Maybe because everyone wants a
piece of the pie and they all want to become versions of George Jung. 
"Blow" is the rise and fall of a cocaine king, a story told countless times
before as in Brian De Palma's jumbled "Scarface." The big difference is that
George got their first, and he is not someone that handles business matters with
machine guns or chainsaws. He is seemingly unaffected by his surroundings and
that is a major flaw for a rise and fall tale like this one. Who is George Jung
really? Does he have any ambitions in life besides cocaine and marijuana? The
only inkling we get of his persona is through his parents (both played by Ray
Liotta and a far too thickly-New York-accented Rachel Griffiths) who want their
son to be successful. Only George's mother does not share her son's enthusiasm
for drugs - she even rats him out in one scene. George's father just wants his
son to be careful, as if the drug business was like any other which it decidedly
is not. Still, as played by Depp, he carries the same doleful expression in
every scene. He has shown far more nuance as Ed Wood or as the book seller in
"The Ninth Gate" than he does here. 
Director Ted Demme ("The Ref") borrows stylistic camerawork and editing styles
from "GoodFellas" and "Boogie Nights," using freeze frames and a roving camera
to keep situations flying from one scene to the next. It often works, as does
the dazzling opening sequence where we see how cocaine is made and shipped.  Too
often though, the film gets repetitive and monotonous but it does seem to perk
up occasionally to maintain interest. Still, if you have seen "GoodFellas" or
"Boogie Nights," you have seen this tale before. 
"Blow" is largely uneven and inconsistent but it does burst with some magnetism,
and at its core is a sad story of a man who truly had nothing to offer in his
life except drugs. The downbeat ending accentuates the life of a man who had no
inner life and no sign of intelligence - a Forrest Gump of the drug trade. All
we learn is that George simply blew it.

Susan Granger's review of "BLOW" (New Line Cinema)
      Put this coke-drenched cautionary caper at the top of your "must see" list. Based on the true life story of George Jung, the first American to become one-man drug conduit, bringing Colombian cocaine into the United States in the '70s and '80s, it chronicles the rise and fall of a crime entrepreneur.  Raised by dysfunctional parents, Jung was a money-hungry kid from Massachusetts, stoned in California's sun and surf, when he ran into a sultry stewardess who flew in marijuana from Mexico. So why not cocaine from Colombia? Jung saw himself as an ingenious modern-day pirate, defying politics, governments and the police. Eventually, he self-destructs with hedonism and greed and, as a result, will remain in prison until 2014.  As Jung, Johnny Depp delivers a wickedly faceted display of acting prowess, filled with detail and specificity. Ray Liotta and Rachel Griffiths are poignant as Jung's troubled parents.  Paul Reubens (a.k.a. Pee-Wee Herman) scores as a homosexual !
hairdresser/dealer, Franka Potente's vibrancy glows as Jung's giddy girl-friend, and Penelope Cruz snarls as the selfish, spoiled shrew who becomes his wife. Too bad that the hyperambitious but predictably formulaic script by Nick Cassavetes and David McKenna is clich=E9-riddled and fragmented in its condensation of Bruce Porter's book and that director Ted Demme relies so much on Depp's voice-over narration as the third-act disintegrates into a banal morality morass. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Blow" is a disturbing 8, a chilling saga that gets under your skin in its assertion that there's simply no way to stop the importation of drugs into this country. Although it will inevitably be compared to "Traffic," "Boogie Nights," "Casino" and "Goodfellas," "Blow" is a definite must-see.

Blow is a slang term for cocaine. The gauche wardrobe and fancy haircuts
are part of the flashy drug scene and the film's attempt to capture the
real look of the druggie scene. Johnny Depp plays George Jung, whose
rags-to-riches true story as a drug smuggler is chronicled in a
stylishly amoral, sympathetic, and lighthearted way by director Ted
Demme. Jung is now serving a long stretch in a federal prison. His
hedonistic journey through the marijuana years of the 1960s and 1970s
and the disco cocaine years of the 1980s and 1990s, is a sad reminder of
the way the pop culture scene had its darker side. The highs from "Blow"
come mostly from the colorful fashion show it parades before us and
Depp's brilliantly nuanced performance, as he shows off his
inscrutability and his swagger, where he challenges us to be sympathetic
to him even if he's a lowlife drug dealer and an uninteresting
character, whose selfish dream is all about himself accumulating money
and material happiness.
There was not much else to get off on, as "Blow" didn't have the script
or the kind of direction needed to blow one away. It played up in a big
way that it was bringing you to the historical places where the drug
scene was happening, as Jung was the American who established a link
between Pablo Escobar's Colombian drug cartel and the unloading of the
addictive stuff in the U.S.. In a voiceover, Jung mentions that most
cocaine users during the '70s and '80s (85%) used Escobar's product. The
movie plays it real safe, as the only users the audience sees are the
flashy Hollywood types that no one cares about.
Demme makes these drug runners into celebrated folk heroes, who are the
"in" people in Hollywood and on the college campus (which,
unfortunately, seems to be true to a certain extent). "Blow" suffered
because it was too simplistic in its storytelling, in its nonjudgmental
stance on drugs, and in shamelessly pulling the audience to the side of
the nice guy drug dealer, George Jung. It doesn't even have the will of
another recent drug trafficking film, "Traffic," to even spend a moment
worrying about the consequences of hard drugs. For this uncritical film,
the drug dealers might as well just be considered risk-taking
businessmen and the rush they get is a business one. But the biggest
bust about "Blow," is that it's just not a good film to get off on. If
cocaine was not the subject matter, this film would be boring (and it
probably wouldn't have been made).
It opens in George's Weymouth, Mass., hometown where it shows his hard
working but unsuccessful plumber father, the kind-hearted Fred Jung
(Liotta), and his materialistic, backbiting mother (Griffiths), clashing
over money matters. These money quarrels left a deep impression on the
young George, and his father's bankruptcy became a bitter pill for the
family to swallow. George swears he will never be poor like his old man,
someone he really liked but never respected. He felt his pop was foolish
to think that money was unreal.
When of age, in 1968, he rushes off to Manhattan Beach, Calif., with his
boyhood friend Tuna (Suplee). The place is populated by airline
stewardesses and all sorts of groovy cats. In this free-spirited
atmosphere, where pot is in, George hooks up with a lovely stewardess
named Barbara (Franka Potente) and she hooks him up with the one
supplying the pot to the kids on the beach, the homosexual hairdresser
Derek Foreal (Reubens). They all go partners in the pot business and
business is so good they expand and ship their top-notch merchandise to
the East Coast, as Barbara acts as a courier and hometown pal, Kevin
Dulli (Perlich), moves the stuff for them there.
George feels good about himself because of his new wealth and visits his
sulking parents, showing off Barbara and her diamond engagement ring.
But his folks are not pleased with his career moves and do not make him
feel good about himself, even though he says things are perfect.
He soon gets busted in Chicago and is looking at 5 years prison time,
but skips when bailed out and Barbara suddenly dies from an illness and
his life seems shattered. Returning to his folks house after not seeing
them for some time while on the run, his mother turns him into the cops
telling him that it's for his own good so that he can straighten out his
life. Evidently some people have the wrong opinion that jail time can
rehabilitate one. In George's case his stay in Danbury, a federal
prison, helped him graduate to big-time drug dealing, as his cellmate
was Diego (Spanish actor Jordi Molla) who will introduce him on his
release to Colombian cocaine trafficker Pablo Escobar. This leads to
George being the U.S. franchise for the Escobar drug cartel.
Next comes enormous wealth, a thirty million dollar bank account in
Noriega's Panama bank, and a beautiful Colombian trophy wife, Mirtha
(Penelope Cruz), who gleefully snorts cocaine while pregnant. She tells
George: "I gave up smoking." But all's not well in paradise. George's
parents are disappointed in him and not impressed with his Florida
mansion or his many luxury sports cars. So George tries to put all his
love into his young daughter Kristina (Lori L. Bailey), but to no avail.
George is too sweet for this business and he keeps trusting the wrong
people, as he runs into one betrayal after another and his life goes
downhill. He's betrayed by all his drug pals and loved ones: he is
jailed; his mother refuses to see him; his wife divorces him; and, his
daughter has never visited him in jail. But who really cares about
George and that he seems to have aged considerably and his blotched face
shows the pathetic life he led and on top of that, he has lost some of
his marbles! George failed to be a worthwhile character for us to care
about him. This film is just another blip in a long line of unimportant
drug related films. Really... the best thing that could be said about
the film, is that it doesn't preach to us.
