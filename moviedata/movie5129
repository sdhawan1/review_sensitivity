Producer Tom Tykwer's follow-up to the acclaimed Run Lola Run, Gigantic
follows three friends through a night in Hamburg, Germany as one of the trio
prepares to depart permanently the next morning. The production's only weak
points are the fault of international barriers, not the filmmakers, with a
critical scene causing confusion over international currencies and another
relying on two languages being spoken thus losing its effect with the
monolingual English subtitles. The film's climax is a table-soccer game,
something this critic has never imagined could be so exhilarating. Mixed
into the touching and entertaining night in Germany are themes of
homosexuality, dormant nazism awakening and one's responsibility for others.
At the end of the movie's 77 minute duration one thing is clear: Gigantic
has a heart the size of its title.
