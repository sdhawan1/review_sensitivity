After The Fox (1966) **1/2 out of ***** - Cast: Peter Sellers, Victor
Mature, Britt Ekland, Martin Balsam. Written by: Neil Simon. Directed by:
Vittorio De Sica. Running Time: 103 minutes.
"After the Fox" stars Peter Sellers as italian criminal mastermind Aldo
Venucci, also known as "the Fox". After escaping from prison, he plots to
obtain a large shipment of gold which had been stolen a few weeks earlier.
He devises a plan where he and his goons pose as a film crew making a movie
about some crooks who are stealing a large shipment of gold.
The film is a disappointment considering the talent involved. Neil Simon's
script is very funny UNTIL the plot actually starts. Sellers is brilliant as
always, pulling off an italian accent with ease. Victor Mature, who plays
the aging Hollywood film star Venucci cons into starring in his "movie",
seems to have a lot of fun with his egotistical character. Just overall, as
comedies go, it doesn't have enough laughs. And the final scene, no matter
how you look at it, makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.
Peter Sellers was set to have potentially been the biggest star in Hollywood
in 1964, following the success of "The Pink Panther" and "Dr. Strangelove".
It's said that the commercial and critical failure of "After the Fox"
(combined with Sellers' erratic behavior on the set of "Casino Royale")
destroyed his career for the next eight years.
