Ever felt the need to just pick and leave. To simply forget about your
job and where you live, the daily problems that hound you and the
responsibilities that ground you. So why not post an advertisement in
lets say Paris, Apartment for exchange' for one in New York? No nosey
personal questions, discretion is important, as long as you look after
the place  it's yours for a short holiday.
So when a famous psychoanalyst, Henry Harriston (William Hurt), decides
he needs a change of pace, he swaps his apartment for one in Paris - one
that belongs to free spirited, Beatrice Saulnier (Juliette Binoche).
When he decides to drop by home for a visit, he finds that Beatrice is
counselling all his male patients, with better success than himself. He
is so mesmerised by this mysterious woman with an aura', that he
decides to become one of her patients.
When they fall in love, one asks the question, why? They hardly know
each other. She's pretending to be a psychologist, illegally accepting
money from his patients, whilst he is allowing her to continue with the
sick charade so he can satisfy his twisted curiosity of becoming her
patient. Isn't it obviously wrong to feign illness, just because you
find the doctor fascinating'? Or has it been made acceptable, just
because this is a movie and one can live out their
love-deprived-twisted-Freudian-fantasies on screen?
With this major flaw aside, Juliette Binoche carries with her a glowing,
care-freeness which is refreshing, whilst William Hurt (who speaks
French well) lumbers about like a book worm needing to get laid. The
ending is as empty and awkward as two strangers standing on a balcony,
proclaiming the words I love you', just because that's how the fantasy
is meant to end.
