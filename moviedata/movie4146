 Starring Bob Hoskins, Elaine Cassidy, Arsinée Khanjian. Rated PG-13.
There are many superficial similarities between Atom Egoyan's flawed
but resonant new movie Felicia's Journey and his 1997 critical smash
The Sweet Hereafter, but the two films are fundamentally different.
Hereafter was a concept movie, dealing with the idea of grief after a
tragedy. Felicia's Journey is nothing of the sort. It's a character
movie, one that plunges into the deepest, darkest depths of human
nature. The main character is a serial killer and yet the killings are
never shown; the movie is not about them.
Young, naive, pregnant Felicia comes to Great Britain from Ireland in
search of her lover, who has reportedly gone away to serve in the army.
He promised Felicia he would write every day, but she has not heard a
word from him since he left. The only information she has came from a
friend of a friend, and that is that he works in a lawnmower factory.
She wonders around England's industrial midlands in search of
Wonderboy; she is instead taken in by Joseph Ambrose Hilditch (Bob
Hoskins), who obligingly assists her in her search but has dark
ulterior motives himself.
You see, Hilditch has murdered a number of young women. They were all
lonely young things, undergoing major crises. He preyed on their
emotions and when they tried to leave, he killed them. Hilditch himself
doesn't know he did it: he remembers the girls, but not the crimes. He
obsessively follows along with tapes of his classy mother's old cooking
shows, where he, as a child was the co-star -- whenever his mother
needed someone to humiliate.
Meanwhile, Hilditch takes steps to make sure Felicia stays by his side
and she never suspects him for a moment. Felicia's Journey develops
into a suspense thriller that uses drastically untraditional methods to
generate that suspense: no quickening of the pace, no dramatic swells
of the soundtrack to indicate something exciting happening. The result
is, unfortunately, an effective drama but not much of a thriller. We're
involved, emotionally and viserally, but never particularly, um,
thrilled. Not that there's anything wrong with that.
One of Egoyan's more tangible fallacies here is the film's first 45
minutes. He limps out of the starting line with a deadly slow first
third, to the point where I had almost given up on the movie by the
time things got interesting. It's a well-known fact that non-mainstream
directors like to take their time, but isn't grabbing the audience's
attention immediately one of the first rules of filmmaking?
Fortunately, once things get interesting, they really get interesting.
The performances quickly develop into rich, deep characterizations and
the plot becomes intricate and involving. Egoyan is a craftsman, one of
the most effectively subtle directors in the business. His films take
on an eerie quality of a whole other level running beneath the main
storyline. We get glimpses of it once in a while, through character
revelations, script allusions, et al -- or we think we do -- but for
the most part it remains hidden from us. Of course, it may not even
exist, but in that case Egoyan's deliberate, mystical style is sure
good at making us imagine it.
The ending of Felicia's Journey is a tour de force. At that point,
everything becomes clear and you realize just how good everything that
preceded it was. It creates the temptation to go back and watch the
movie again (something I plan to do, since I have the video) to learn
more about Joseph Ambrose Hilditch.
I do wish the character of Felicia was more of a person than a concept.
She barely even has dialogue and, as a result, never fully becomes
human. Thus, we can't identify with her and the film's protagonist
becomes the serial killer himself, something that should turn off
audiences. It also makes the title kinda strange -- this is hardly
Felicia's journey. The movie ceases to be about her as soon as we see
Hilditch's first cooking scene.
I'm not as enthusiastic about this movie as I was about The Sweet
Hereafter because it's rougher around the edges. The film "wakes up" in
its last 20 minutes, but there is no reason why the whole movie
couldn't have been as rich and as complex as those final moments. But I
won't complain too much. Go see this one.

     Atom Egoyan is no stranger to the top ten lists of filmcritic.com.
THE ADJUSTER (#7, 1991), CALENDAR (#6, 1993), EXOTICA (#7, 1995), and
THE SWEET HEREAFTER (#3, 1997) attest to some amazing staying power over
our minds.  And while Egoyan's latest effort, FELICIA'S JOURNEY, is
certainly a watchable film, it's likely to be his first of the decade
that doesn't make the cut.
     Why?  While Egoyan is a master at working with cryptic source
material, FELICIA'S JOURNEY lends itself more to its source as a novel
than the big screen.  Basically, this is the story of two people.  First
is Felicia (Cassidy), an Irish lass who's travelled to the U.K. to
search for the father of her unborn child.  Along the way she encounters
Joseph Hilditch (Hoskins), a sweet and friendly `catering director' who
hides a secret that other critics will undoubtedly reveal, but I won't.
     FELICIA'S JOURNEY quickly becomes one of codependency.  Hilditch,
the son of a famous TV cooking show star (Egoyan regular, his wife
Khanjian), needs the woman to dote upon.  Felicia needs him to help
search for her Johnny, and to feed and shelter her.  We do manage to get
inside the heads of both of these characters, particularly interesting
in flashbacks to Hilditch's bizarre life as a child.  But I posit that
the film may have been just as understandable without them.  These
characters just aren't all that deep, especially Felicia, who gets on
your nerves after her prettiness wears off.
     By the end, we realize we've been watching a couple of crazies for
the last two hours.  The resolution arrives exactly as expected, which
is *not* Egoyan's typical M.O.  The movie ends, the theater clears, the
story feels unfinished and trifling.
     Artisan has already begun a campaign to get Hoskins a Best Actor
nomination, and rightfully so.  But aside from his impressive,
slow-burning work along with typical Egoyan cinematic beauty, FELICIA
has little to add to Egoyan's repertoire.  There are moments of
greatness, punctuated by stretches of predictable narrative.
Ultimately, the film just feels too much like something you'd see late
at night on Showtime.  Okay, maybe better than that, but nothing to send
a postcard home about.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Double Oscar nominee Atom Egoyan's (The Sweet Hereafter) latest film
begins with a great long shot that travels through the sumptuously
appointed first floor of a mansion before it finally comes to rest on a
man preparing an intricate dish along with a French cooking show on TV.
The portly man is Joseph Hilditch (Bob Hoskins, Cousin Bette), the
overseer of a large industrial kitchen in England, and the giant home
was owned by his deceased mother Gala, who also happens to be the French
chef on the television.
We learn that the friendly Hilditch (think Ed Asner with a weave) is a
stickler for the fine art of cuisine, chasing away the salesman of a
vending machine company because his product would result in the loss of
jobs.  Hilditch explains that food needs to be prepared by human hands.
Each evening, Hilditch cooks a gourmet meal in his mother's kitchen
while watching videotapes of her television show.  There is a huge
stockpile of brand-new kitchen appliances at his disposal, each bearing
a picture of Gala (Arsinée Khanjian, Irma Vep and Egoyan's real-life
wife).  We see flashbacks of a chunky young Hilditch playing second
fiddle to his mother's career.
Meanwhile, a young, pretty Irish girl named Felicia (newcomer Elaine
Cassidy) has just traveled from her native County Cork to Birmingham,
England.  She's alone, pregnant and has no identification.  Felicia's
excursion has one singular mission  to find the love of her life and
father of her child, Johnny (Peter McDonald, I Went Down).  The problem
is that Felicia only knows that Johnny may have a manufacturing job
somewhere in Birmingham.  We learn through several flashbacks that
Felicia's father (Gerard McSorley, The Boxer) has threatened to disown
her if she left home for Johnny, an Irish lad that jumped sides and
joined the British Army.  Think of the widow-peaked Felicia as a
physical cross between Olivia Williams, Molly Parker and Parker Posey.
The forlorn Felicia meets the congenial Hilditch, who offers to help the
lass find her dreamboat.  I won't reveal the payoff, but if you raised a
red flag at the thought of a man that watches videotape of his dead mom
while living in her house, you'll get the idea.  The result is a twisted
mixture of Remains of the Day and The Silence of the Lambs.  Hoskins is
completely believable as the helpful gentleman with a big secret, and
the love-blind Cassidy portrays sufficient innocence in her titular
role.  Is Hoskins' performance good enough to nab an Oscar nomination?
They thought so in Cannes, where the film was overly praised earlier
this year.  Expect a big push from Journey's distributor Artisan  the
studio is rolling in cash after The Blair Witch Project.
Egoyan, who adapted the screenplay from William Trevor's novel Fools of
Fortune, slowly builds up the suspense in the film without using
gimmicky tricks or graphically depicting violence.  And the effect is
downright creepy.  His use of 50s music  especially Malcolm Vaughn's
`You Are My Special Angel'  helps to add to the glowing, dream-like
quality of the film.  Credit cinematographer Paul Sarossy (Affliction)
for much of Journey's radiance, as well as Egoyan's transformation
between the lush, green scenes in Ireland to the sooty gray of
Birmingham's industrial factories.
1:56 - PG-13 for mature thematic elements and related disturbing images

     Without revealing too much, it's fair to say that Joseph Hilditch
(Bob Hoskins) is not what he appears to be. As catering manager for a
factory in England's industrial midlands, he is respected for his
attention to detail and the affection he brings to his food. At home,
however, he is a middle-aged bachelor who spends his nights preparing
elaborate recipes from videotapes of a 1950s cooking show hosted by his
mother Gala (Arsinee Khanjian). When he shows interest in helping Felicia
(Elaine Cassidy), a pregnant 17-year-old Irish girl looking for her
boyfriend, it seems to be the act of a kindly, altruistic fellow. Then
again, it may not.
     FELICIA'S JOURNEY, adapted by Atom Egoyan from William Trevor's
novel, is an investigation into relationship pathology that works
beautifully while those pathologies remain enigmatic. For the first half
of the film, Egoyan darts and weaves through time and place, showing us
both of the principal characters searching for someone to cling to. The
naive young Felicia, seduced by a young man who shows her the first
individual attention of her life, finds it impossible to believe that her
Johnny would have deceived her when he left Ireland without giving her an
address. Her search is clearly doomed from the start, but no less doomed
than the quest of Mr. Hilditch. He too seeks someone who will pay him
individual attention, bringing a series of troubled young girls into his
confidence and videotaping them for future reference. When the girls no
longer need his help, he's left to take other measures to keep them from
leaving.
     There's plenty of rich psychological material in the intersection of
these two characters, and Egoyan keeps it compelling for much of the
running time. His compositions (aided by Paul Sarossy's cinematography)
continue to be among the more hypnotic in modern cinema, whether lingering
over Irish landscapes, visiting Hilditch's troubled childhood or watching
Felicia wander in a strange land. Bob Hoskins' performance anchors the
material, creating a character that keeps the audience off balance.
Hilditch is a manipulator, but he's also a wounded soul who manages to
convince himself he's doing the right thing for other people. When Hoskins
wants you to feel for Hilditch, you'll feel for him. When he wants you to
fear Hilditch (as in one nerve-wracking glare directly at the audience),
you'll fear him.
     Hilditch develops in so many unexpected ways that the film's
resolution can only come as a disappointment. Egoyan is incapable of
letting FELICIA'S JOURNEY become a simple genre film, but he's stuck with
genre conventions all the same (though why he assented to Mychael Danna's
clanking, ham-fisted instrumental score, I have no idea). The finale, a
confrontation between Hilditch and a robotically sincere Christian
missionary (Claire Benedict), does have a wonderfully twisted humor to it,
as the missionary finds herself incapable of dealing with a real soul in
torment when she finds one. As a dramatic climax, however, it's
unsatisfying, a deus-by-proxy ex machina way for Hilditch's eyes to be
opened. And Egoyan should henceforth resist the temptation to close his
films with explicatory voice-overs (see also: THE SWEET HEREAFTER).
     Those flaws might have crushed another film, but FELICIA'S JOURNEY
gets off to too solid a start. I still found myself piecing together the
connections between Hilditch's past and his present after the film was
through, and pondering the circumstances that allow one unhappy person to
grow and heal while another collapses into a fantasy world. Hoskins'
performance alone makes FELICIA'S JOURNEY worthy watching; it's just a
shame that such a subtle performance ends with such melodrama. "Things
take a turn," Hilditch ominously intones at one point, which could easily
summarize FELICIA'S JOURNEY. It's a turn that wrings simple quality from
potential brilliance.

Susan Granger's review of "FELICIA'S JOURNEY" (Artisan Entertainment)
      In 1997, Canadian writer/director Atom Egoyan made an incredible
splash with his wildly unconventional The Sweet Hereafter, but this
new thriller, while superbly crafted, is neither as compelling nor
original. But that doesn't mean it's unworthy. Adapted from William
Trevor's novel, it follows the insidious story of Felicia, a
good-hearted, pregnant Irish country girl (Elaine Cassidy), who goes
to England to search for the child's father (Peter McDonald) and is
befriended by Joseph Hilditch, a seemingly gentle and smiling caterer
(Bob Hoskins) who works for a factory in industrial Birmingham. While
the laborers would obviously prefer simple British fare, the portly
Hilditch diligently concocts elaborate recipes on his antique
appliances while watching old video-taped cooking programs hosted by
his glamorous French mother (Arsinee Khanjian, Egoyan's real-life
wife). Aside from his psychotic mother complex, which rivals that of
Psycho's Norman Bates, Hilditch has courtly, Old World manners and
lives in what appears to be the family mansion - which makes one
immediately suspect that he's a dangerous serial killer with corpses
in the back yard. Not the trusting young Felicia, however. She's
grateful for the "help" he solicitously offers.  Problem is: there's
no mystery. Egoyan gives away the sinister secret so early in the
story that we're just left there, sitting in our seats watching with
dread as the tapestry unravels. And it's much more conventional than
the quirky Atom Egoyan fare in The Adjuster and Exotica. The scenes
stretch on too long and the repetitive flashbacks defuse the
tension. Nevertheless, Bob Hoskins (Mona Lisa) delivers yet another
dead-on characterization, one that he describes as "a cross between
Jack the Ripper and Winnie the Pooh." On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1
to 10, Felicia's Journey is a stylish if shallow 7. It's a bizarre,
macabre trip.

   The terrible price that individuals from dysfunctional
families must sometimes pay has been a favorite topic of
playwrights and other writers since the Greeks.  Clytemnestra
kills her husband for coming home with a fortune teller. 
Medea murders her two children to punish her straying
husband.  Hamlet kills his uncle for the murder of Hamlet's
father.  In more recent times, Sam Mendes electrified the film
world with "American Beauty," about the ultimate price that
Lester Burnham pays soon after his loins are inflamed by a
high-school cheerleader.  But few contemporary films delve
into the depths of loneliness and despair as sincerely as
"Felicia's Journey."  The movie centers on an otherwise
gentle, unremarkable person whose conflicted relationship
with his mother turns him into a serial killer.  
   "Felicia's Journey," an adaptation of William Trevor's quiet
thriller of the same name, is the story of an association
between two people who are of different ages and from
diverse backgrounds but who share a pattern of self-delusion
that drives each of them to obsessive behavior.  For the
younger of the pair, the fixation is painful to bear, like the
anguish felt by a betrayed lover in Victor Hugo's "The Story
of Adele H."  For the more mature individual, the lifelong
yearning for connection leads to serial murder, to a
progression of crimes of which the killer has no memory.  
   The titled Felicia of the story has taken a journey from a
remote village in Ireland's County Cork to the highly
industrialized English city of Birmingham.  More important is
her psychological excursion, from the naivete of a guileless
young woman to a person who becomes aware of the ways
of the world and reconciles herself to the reality.  Joseph
Ambrose Hilditch, a catering manager in a large Birmingham
factory, takes a similar journey of self-realization, and while
his outcome is not as sunny, he is at last able to come to
terms with his true nature.
   The film is written and directed by the remarkable Atom
Egoyan.  Egoyan set the movie-mavens' world on fire two
seasons ago with "The Sweet Hereafter," about a tenacious
lawyer who travels to a remote Canadian village trying to sign
up the survivors of a terrible bus accident which took the lives
of many children.  Like that elliptical tale with its many
flashbacks and dream-like sequences, "Felicia's Journey"
takes a patient, methodical approach, with frequent closeups
to the faces of the two principals evoking the complex, mostly
confused, emotions that they feel. Essentially a two-character
story, the movie never has the claustrophobic feel of a filmed
play because Egoyan leaves his native Canada for the first
time to cast his camera's lens across the expansive greenery
of rural Ireland, which he contrasts with the smoldering
smokestacks and the ominous nuclear power plant of a
nightmarishly industrialized Midlands city.  Similarly, he
displays the bustle of everyday life as seen by one character
and suddenly swaps scenes to portray the commotion in the
life of the other.  
   Until we become aware of the monster that inhabits the
soul of Joseph Hilditch (Bob Hoskins), we cannot help liking
him.  He's a roly-poly man, a catering manager in a large
food factory who is not only well-liked by his employees but
highly respected for his opinions about the food which they
prepare.  Their affection for him is not difficult to understand:
in one scene he gently chastises a man who is trying to sell
him a machine that can do everything that a series of cooks
now perform, but Hilditch would not think of firing human
beings, whose preparation of food is an act of love to the
diners.  Hilditch lives in a large house by himself, preparing
his own dinners under the videotaped instruction of a TV
chef, Gala (Arsinee Khanjian), who we learn is his mother--
whose 1950s programs now exist in the extensive library of
tapes that Hilditch maintains along with far more sinister
videos.
   His loneliness comes to a temporary halt when he runs into
a similarly forsaken person, the young Felicia (Elaine
Cassidy), who has been seduced and impregnated by a
young man, Johnny (Peter McDonald), and whom she now
seeks in Birmingham.  Since he did not leave her his
address, she depends on the kindness of the strange Hilditch
to help her find the boy, and the connection that Hilditch and
Felicia enjoy temporarily lifts both from their misery.  Egoyan
takes us all on a psychological journey involving two lost
souls, an excursion which is wholly original, thought-
provoking, involving, and searing.  
   If Atom Egoyan lucked out two years ago by employing two
greater actors--Ian Holm and Sarah Polley to depict two
haunted individuals--his good fortune continues this time
around as well.  Bob Hoskins, turning in the achievement of
his career, portrays a tormented man so subtly, so bereft of
obvious Hollywood-style melodrama, that our hearts go out to
him while we are simultaneously repulsed by the sick acts
that his diseased soul compels him to perform.  His Hilditch
becomes the person we all know from work, from school,
from right next-door: the kindly, unobtrusive, considerate
person who we'd swear could not hurt a fly.  His pairing with
Elaine Cassidy as the lovesick girl frantically searching for the
boy who lied to her is surely as recognizable to each of us. 
Gullible, impressed by a guy's convincing line, she has no
memory of the hundreds of similar women whose lives have
been portrayed in novels and films, women who have been
tricked by rogues with one thing on their minds.  Her not
quite typically Irish features display a bevy of emotions--her
expressions of shyness, trust, confusion, and anger as easy
to read as a road map of midtown Manhattan.  Egoyan's
supporting cast add considerable depth and credibility to the
tale, particularly Felicia's dour dad who rejects his daughter
as a whore who has slept with the enemy and Hilditch's
cheery mom who is not ashamed to embarrass her boy and
show affection equally while they share a TV screen but who
treats him like excess baggage when off the stage.
   If commercial American filmmakers got their hands on this
piece of work and tried to fashion it into an American-style
thriller, the picture would be corrupted so extensively that it
would become another been-there-done-that.  In its present
form, "Felicia's Journey" not only might convince you that the
Canadian filmmakers can do no wrong but could give you
faith that vital movies are indeed possible without the
distorting endowment of Hollywood's hand.  "Felicia's
Journey" was appropriately selected as the closing work of
the 1999 New York Film Festival.

What makes Johnny and Mary run? To the movies, that is. No one really 
knows for sure. Market Research is an approximate non-science. With 
or without it a few things are obvious. The main target of Hollywood 
(the term is used generically) is the under 30 public. Publicity will 
help, hype,  celebrity actors, awards, and so on.
Yet the precise influence of reviews is unfathomable. The bulk of the 
audience reads no reviews. The smaller but still sizable group of 
potential viewers who do read the critics consists of movie 
professionals in one way or another: aficionados, critics, film 
students, people who parse newspapers and magazines...
Most persons in this sub-group limit themselves to one or two 
reviewers, especially if the latter have built up attraction and/or 
trust among their readers. A major example of this was  for many 
years the appeal of Pauline Kael in the New Yorker magazine. Another, 
current case, is the huge popularity of critic Roger Ebert.
But even for faithful followers, a laudatory review is often 
superseded by the question to end all questions : "what is the movie 
about?" Which may result in attending a show -- even if Ebert gave it 
a lukewarm rating -- or not attending, in spite of the critical 
praise, because the film's genre or type is unattractive.
"Felicia's Journey" is about a serial killer. That's all that may 
matter to John and Mary Doe, who may (mostly John) either get their 
kicks from such a subject or be repelled by it.  But here "serial 
killer" is an oversimplification. We neither see nor hear violence 
and there is minimal "Old Dark House" scariness.
Felicia, a 17-year old from County Cork, is bereft of her boyfriend 
Johnny  now gone to find work in England. There's no news of him, but 
plenty of news for him: Felicia is pregnant. She encounters hostility 
from her own, widowed father, and from Johnny's mother.
As the story is told in bits and pieces --and crucial, skillful 
flashbacks--Felicia thinks that Johnny is working in a lawn mower 
factory in Birmingham, the Midlands. In fact he has enlisted in the 
British Army. This is a betrayal of his Irishness, one of several in 
the story. Felicia's father, a fanatical Irish nationalist, betrays 
his daughter who, according to him, has also betrayed her country. 
"You're carrying the enemy within you." Johnny's mother cheats by not 
forwarding Felicia's letters. And there's more to come.
The very naive girl  sets on a journey to find her lover. She crosses 
the sea, reaches the industral Midlands, is confused, and in a chance 
encounter meets Joseph Ambrose Hilditch, who offers to help her.
Hilditch is an amiable, plumpish quinquagenerian who manages the food 
services of a large factory. He is respected by his admiring staff 
for his culinary judgments. He is, in fact, nothing short of a 
gourmet, and in the oddest of places. Since in spite of the Michelin 
Guide's stars, the UK is not exactly a haven of gastronomy, Hilditch 
is a multiple oddity in his profession and his private life. He is 
aloner without any public life outside the factory.
Hilditch lives alone in a large house whose innards and decor mix 
Victorian, Edwardian, and 1950s styles. You expect antimacassars, 
hand-wound granfather clocks, samplers on the walls, aspidistras. But 
what catches your eye is the man's huge kitchen, his large array of 
old but functioning culinary tools, his antique Mixmaster, his 
kitchen video set. Also his collection of popular, Mantovani-style 
LPs of the 50s era.  Outside the house, the past is symbolized by 
Hilditch's old-fashioned suits and his small, old British  Morris 
car, a kind of VW or Fiat Topolino.
The past and haute cuisine meld as Hilditch obsessively watches tapes 
from way back, tapes of Gala's cooking programs on TV. He follows her 
instructions and prepares refined dishes for just himself.
Gala, a Frenchwoman-in-England (played by director Egoyan's wife 
Arsinee Khanjian) was a great favorite of the public when Hilditch 
was a child. Her appearances, cajoling and imperious, are like a 
subtle take-off on such programs. And a young Hilditch shows up in 
them. Gala was his mother.
Which goes a long way in explaining (or does it?) that Mother-Smother 
is at the root (or a catalyst?) of chidhood traumas which turned 
Hilditch into a serial killer. (The film has sensibly eliminated the 
sexual mother-son element). He has, over the years, "helped" a number 
of women with problems (e.g. runaways or prostitutes); he has, in 
these days of electronics, recorded them and their talks on tape. But 
there are no images of the actual murders. Felicia, that other loner, 
is next in line, but...
Of Armenian descent, Atom Egoyan was born in Cairo, grew up in 
Canada, and is one of most prominent filmmakers of that country as 
well as the world. This, his eighth feature, contains many of his 
themes and preoccupations, is more concentrated than usual, avoids 
arty pitfalls, and is essentially a character-driven psychological 
two-hander. Beautifully and intelligently shot and edited, in both 
literal and symbolic ways, it is refined. Ireland is a feast for the 
eyes, yet cruel towards Felicia. Birmingham is cold and miserable, 
yet, ambiguously, what warmth there is comes from a killer.
The movie is much closer to Bluebeard and  Beauty and the Beast tales 
and very far from Vlad the Impaler. Hilditch is, in odd fashion (the 
key words for this film)  likable and pitiful. He is superlatively 
well acted by Hoskins who has said that his character was a cross 
between Winnie the Pooh and Jack the Ripper. A not-so-obvious 
originality in the film -- for visual reasons--was his casting. 
Rotund and/or short killers in movies are the exception and to a 
lesser degree this applies to plain villains too, to whom it is 
easier to give a lean and hungry look. Of course this is not an 
inflexible rule,   especially when one thinks of Fat Man Sydney 
Greenstreet  in "The Maltese Falcon," or Laird Cregar  as the main 
suspect in the Jack the Ripper melodrama "The Lodger" (1944)
The story-telling is both simple and complex. It evokes sympathy for 
Felicia's misery and her naive pluckiness. It is balancing act 
between sad empathy and alienation for Hilditch. Additionally, it 
handles the dangerous  trick of having some un-jarring black humor. 
What do you expect from a movie featuring a Miss Calligary?

         Director Atom Egoyan specializes in movies that create slightly
unsettling atmospheres, and "Felicia's Journey" is no exception. As the
story (adapted from William Trevor's novel) gently unfolds, it's like
having one of those disturbing dreams in which everything seems normal
but feels a little askew, almost if as some horrible tragedy is lurking
just around the corner. "Journey" is very much the work of the same man
who previously gave us the jarring "The Sweet Hereafter" and "Exotica."
 In the film, Bob Hoskins plays a quiet, cultured little man
named Joseph Hilditch, who lives by himself in a sprawling old house and
works in a factory, overseeing a staff of cooks who prepare lavish
lunches for the workers. Hilditch's mother Gala (played by the dirctor's
wife Arsinee Khanjian) was a popular French chef back in the age of
black-and-white broadcasts and she sometimes invited her little boy on
the program to serve as comic relief. It appears he's still mired in the
1950s, if his choice of home decor and music are any indication. When
his ancient food processor finally gives out, Hilditch simply walks into
a spare room and pulls out another identical model from among the dozens
he's stockpiled.
 "Food must be served by caring hands, not by machines,"
Hilditch tells a salesman trying to pitch him a line of vending machines
that would put his culinary team out of work. "It makes us feel loved."
At home, he creates elaborate gourmet meals for himself, while watching
tapes of his mother's show.
 Felicia (Elaine Cassidy) is also alone in the world, having
been shunned by her self-righteous father after becoming pregnant by
Johnny (Peter McDonald), a young man who left their depressed Irish town
to look for work in England. Utterly guileless and unaware she's
probably been used, Felicia follows him.
 Both characters experience flashbacks in which they suffer at
the hands of domineering parents -- Felicia's dad calls her a whore in
public and Johnny's aloof mother (Brid Brennan) ignores her pleas for
information on where Johnny went, while Hilditch reflects on being
treated like a prop on the set of Gala's show --  although their methods
of processing this abuse are completely dissimilar.
 You may correctly suspect the lives of Hilditch and Felicia are
destined to intersect, but the beauty of "Felicia's Journey" lies in its
refusal to adhere to a predictable path. Every time we think we know
what's going to happen, the story spins off in a curious new direction;
only in its unconvincing climax does it go wrong.
 Speaking in a deliberate, understated voice and using a minimum
of gestures (when he's not cooking, his hands are often buried in his
pockets), Hoskins makes Hilditch a truly unnerving character, someone
who's outwardly sedate yet seems to have ugly secrets drifting around in
the back of his mind. Although Felicia's naive and unquestioning nature
might have made her a fairly drab heroine in the hands of a less
talented actress, Cassidy brings her tenderly to life and makes her
plight heart-wrenching. James Sanford

_Felicia's_Journey_ (PG-13) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
Every year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences always seems
to go out of its way to ignore some of the most extraordinary acting
performances of the year.  Likely to earn the dubious distinction of a
snub is Bob Hoskins, who pulls off one of the year's most remarkable
acting feats in writer-director Atom Egoyan's adaptation of William
Trevor's novel.  Like all of Egoyan's work, the unfolds like a mystery,
so I'll keep plot details to their barest minimum.  The Felicia of the
title (Elaine Cassidy) is a naive Irish teen who travels to England to
find the lost lover who left her pregnant.  Whom she ends up finding
instead--or vice versa-- Joseph Hilditch (Hoskins), a gentle catering
manager who offers his help in her search.
As Egoyan employs his usual technique of travelling back and forth
through time, some secrets about Hilditch's past and present surface, and
the relationship between Felicia and Hilditch is in a constant state of
flux--but no moreso than than their individual sense of identity. 
Cassidy is a natural and likable actress, and she makes for an easily
sympathetic audience surrogate.  Although her character figures into the
title, the key journey of the film is that of the tormented Hilditch, and
Hoskins does an astonishing job in bringing this very complex character
to life.  It's impossible to adequately describe the difficulty of his
acting task without divulging critical plot information, but suffice it
to say that Hoskins pulls it off without a hitch.  The film doesn't pack
the forceful emotional wallop of Egoyan's last effort, the
Oscar-nominated _The_Sweet_Hereafter_, but _Felicia's_Journey_ is a
deeply haunting film that only grows moreso upon reflection.

FELICIA'S JOURNEY (M).  
(Icon/Twentieth Century Fox)
Director: Atom Egoyan
Stars: Bob Hoskins, Elaine Cassidy, Peter McDonald, Arsinee Khanjian, 
Gerard McSorley, Brid Brennan, Peter Turner, Calire Benedict
Running time: 116 minutes.
Atom Egoyan leaves behind his native Canada to tackle this
chilling, suspenseful psychological thriller about obsession and a
uniquely fascinating and charismatic serial killer.  Felicia's Journey
is set against the background of the bleak urban wasteland of
Britain's post industrial north, and Egoyan and regular
cinematographer Paul Sargossy capture some haunting images and superb
contrasts that beautifully underscore the themes of the grim
narrative.
Felicia (Elaine Cassidy), a naive and shy young Irish lass who
has a brief fling with Johnny (Peter McDonald), a local boy, who heads
south to seek employment in Birmingham.  That's the last she hears of
him, and any efforts to forward letters to him are thwarted by
Johnny's stonily resolute mother.  When she learns that she is
pregnant, Felicia sets off to find Johnny and determine their future
together.
Her search is a futile one, until she meets Hilditch (Bob
Hoskins), a lonely, middle aged catering supervisor at a large
foundry.  The son of a famous former television cook, with whom he
still seems obsessed, Hilditch lives alone in a big empty house that
resonates with anachronistic touches from the '50's.  He initially
offers Felicia some sympathetic advice, and agrees to help her in her
search.  But Hilditch has another reason for helping this lonely, lost
and frightened young woman, which is teasingly made clear through a
series of flashbacks and video recordings.
Egoyan draws some unnerving parallels between these two
lonely, tainted people, who are, in many ways, outcasts from the
regular world.
Hoskins plays Hilditch with remarkable understatement and
poise, giving him a sympathetic edge and atmosphere of compassion that
belies his monstrous nature.  Not since Norman Bates has the screen
produced a cinematic psycho who has been so traumatised by his
overbearing and suffocating mother as Hilditch.  Cassidy's strong
performance imbues the confused Felicia with a touching naivete and
a vulnerability, yet also gives her a hidden strength that slowly
emerges as the full impact of her betrayal sinks in.
Felicia's Journey is based on a novel by William Trevor, and
it seems to resonate with many of those themes common to Egoyan's past
films (The Sweet Hereafter, Exotica, etc).  Egoyan shapes the
narrative with his usual distinctive style, creating an unnerving and
disturbing atmosphere.  Felicia's Journey is far more chilling in what
it suggests than in what it shows.  The restraint with which Egoyan
directs serves as an example for many other contemporary directors,
who equate horror with explicit depictions of blood and gore,
dismembered bodies and lots of graphic, gory effects.  He teasingly
merges the past with the present to inform audiences about the
characters and their motivations.

Directed by Atom Egoyan.
Cast: Bob Hoskins, Elaine Cassidy, Arsinee Khanjian, Peter McDonald, Claire 
Benedict, Gerard McSorley, Brid Brennan, Danny Turner, Sheila Reid.
1999 - 116 minutes
Rated PG-13 (for mature themes and mild profanity).
Reviewed by Dustin Putman, November 21, 1999.
Writer-director Atom Egoyan has made a fairly prosperous, respected career 
out of making complex, thought-provoking motion pictures that challenge the 
viewer's mind and soul. As of late, most notably with 1995's "Exotica" and 
1997's "The Sweet Hereafter," he also has begun to dabble in stories that 
easily could have been transformed into examples of tiresome, conventional 
filmmaker, but has wisely opted to present them out of chronological order, 
so as to gradually tear off layer after layer until he is able to uncover the 
truths of the characters. The true craftsman that Egoyan is, and aided by 
music composer and recent Egoyan staple Mychael Danna's provocative score 
that effortlessly compliments the actions onscreen, the intricate narrative 
never feels contrived or unnecessary, because in each of his pictures, there 
have been very distinct reasons for why he constructs his films this way. 
In Egoyan's latest, "Felicia's Journey," based on the novel by William 
Trevor, Bob Hoskins stars in a performance of startling psychological depth 
as Joseph Hilditch, a seemingly kindhearted, if suspicious, middle-aged man 
who works as a catering manager in a small England town. Much of his time at 
home is spent preparing extravagant meals as he watches videotapes of his 
late mother's cooking show from the 1950s. In a moment of chance, Hilditch 
meets Felicia (Elaine Cassidy), a sullen Irish teenager who has left her home 
to search for her older boyfriend, Johnny (Peter McDonald), after he 
allegedly went away to work in a lawn mower factory near Birmingham. Walking 
the roads in search of a person who very well might have lied to her, Felicia 
is given directions by Hilditch to a factory, and later, suggests a cozy 
bed-and-breakfast up the street for her to stay at. 
When Hilditch offers to drive Felicia fifty miles to a place where Johnny may 
be, while he goes to the hospital to visit his dying wife Ada, he begins to 
grow a possibly dangerous emotional attachment to Felicia. In a series of 
scenes intercut between one another, we discover Hilditch has secretly taped 
numerous young women whom he has given a lift to in the past--women that have 
deeply trusted and confided in him--only to murder them. The catch is, the 
clearly unhinged Hilditch obviously is unable to process the full range of 
the horrendous crimes he has committed, and views the tapes of them to 
falsely reassure himself that they are still alive. 
It might be a throwaway statement to say that "Felicia's Journey" could be 
looked upon as the thinking person's "The Bone Collector," but it really is 
the complete truth. A serial killer movie in the most unorthodox sense, 
Egoyan trusts his audience as intelligent people fully capable of 
deconstructing the complicated nature of his films, and he is correct in 
doing so. While "Felicia's Journey," like the remarkable "The Sweet 
Hereafter," moves back and forth between the past and present, it never once 
becomes confusing or distractive, but turns into a sort of poetry, flowing 
gently from one scene to the next. Even more striking is the fact that not 
once does the film come right out and state that Hilditch is a cold-blooded 
murderer. Instead, through vitally important, ethereal sequences, it is 
merely implied, and that is greatly more threatening in its implications than 
the entirety of "The Bone Collector," where various scenes of physical 
violence and abuse are shown in detail.
Bob Hoskins strikes all the right notes as Joseph Hilditch, a man we are 
never really sure whether to sympathize with or fear. Growing up with a 
neglectful mother (Arsinee Khanjian) who was the star of her own television 
show, the only times Hilditch received even a fleeting glimpse of attention 
is when she would put him on camera with her. Hoskins efficaciously portrays 
all of the loneliness and confusion one often endures in life from growing up 
in an unstable household.
Newcomer Elaine Cassidy is a real find in the title role of Felicia. You 
could easily visualize someone such as Sarah Polley as the character, and she 
would have been just as good, no doubt, but Cassidy is a fresh face who is 
not only appealing, but truly talented. Felicia is the less flashy role of 
the two central characters, but in a way, she has the trickier one to play. 
On the outset, she has fooled herself into believing Johnny is her soulmate, 
when it is almost certain he doesn't care for her the same way she does for 
him. Through the course of the film, Felicia grows from a naive child into a 
thoughtful adult. 
While "The Sweet Hereafter" was a decidedly richer Egoyan adaptation of a 
book (that one by Russell Banks), with a more cathartic emotional force, 
"Felicia's Journey" is a striking motion picture, nonetheless. It may stray 
towards being a bit too contemplative and deliberately paced at times, but is 
filled with such thoroughly copious details, and leads to such a satisfying 
conclusion, that it remains a fully rewarding experience.

Joseph Ambrose Hilditch (Bob Hoskins) is a sort of modern Norman Bates. His 
strange obsession with his French cook mother (Arsinee Khanjian) leads him to 
pursue, videotape, and possibly kill young women, usually prostitutes, 
searching for answers in their difficult lives. Hilditch is very lonely, not 
to mention a little crazy, but he tries to be appealing. He's admired by his 
co-workers, the only friends he has. He apparently hopes the girls will stay 
forever, providing him with everlasting companionship. Felicia (Elaine 
Cassidy) is his latest young acquaintance. She is looking for her Irish 
boyfriend who says he works at a lawnmower factory in town. It turns out he 
may have joined the British Army and used the lawnmowers as a cover-up. 
Felicia relies on Hilditch for guidance and lodging since she has little 
money. She almost gives up all hope of finding Johnny, but Joseph tries to 
keep her optimistic and with him for his own personal purposes. The tension 
builds as Felicia may or may not meet the same fate as the previous young 
women.
With one exception, the acting was very good. Elaine Cassidy was never 
satisfactory, but was manageable. Bob Hoskins turns in a masterful 
performance as Hilditch, and Arsinee Khanjian succeeds in flashback scenes. 
Claire Benedict plays a small, but important role as a traveling bible 
saleswoman. She perfectly captures the essence of all Jehovah's Witnesses 
that have ever come to your door. Her marvelous performance got overlooked 
for an Oscar nomination. A wonderful score and soundtrack accompany the 
actors. During the frequent long periods of silence, Egoyan lets the music 
speak for his characters. Malcolm Vaughn's songs add to the unbearable 
intensity. 
Despite being tense, Felicia's Journey has its downsides. The movie is 
remarkably slow and was very tiring. Dramatic build-up is probably the reason 
for lots of unneeded scenes. Too much of the movie is confusing. Felicia and 
Hilditch's actions always seem scripted. Since we never learn a huge amount 
about these people, it's tough to comprehend their motivations. The film 
obviously takes place in England, but the time period is uncertain. 
Hilditch’s old car model and home appliances suggest the 1950s or ‘60s. 
Felicia’s wardrobe, including platform sandals, suggests otherwise. It’s 
even harder to understand the perplexing ending. This mystery is actually 
entertaining for a while. The intriguing Hilditch is quite fascinating until 
his secrets get revealed. Around the same time the movie comes to a grinding 
halt. Another viewing would perhaps help to clear any of my confusion. 
However, another viewing would also put me to sleep.
Sadly, the boring moments outnumber the exciting ones. The material isn't 
enough to build an entire movie on, even though the cast and director try 
hard. This was a personal disappointment for me because Egoyan's 1997 film 
The Sweet Hereafter is one of my all-time favorite movies. Felicia's Journey 
is tiresome, hollow, and better suited as an eighty to ninety minute film. 
Superior performances don't save the poor script.

FELICIA'S JOURNEY (director/writer: Atom Egoyan; screenwriter: based on
the novel by William Trevor; cinematographer: Paul Sarossy; editor:
Susan Shipton; cast: Elaine Cassidy (Felicia), Bob Hoskins (Joseph
Ambrose Hilditch), Claire Benedict (Miss Calligary), Brid Brennan (Mrs.
Lysaght), Arsinee Khanjian (Gala), Peter McDonald (Johnny Lysaght),
Gerard McSorley (Felicia's Father), Sheila Reed (Iris), Danny Turner
(Young Hilditch), 1999-Can.)
Inspired by the 1994 novel by William Trevor, this is a film about a
serial killer that promised to be more inspiring than it turned out,
even though it is an excellently crafted film and has more to offer than
the usual serial killer film does. It studied a warped man from when he
was seen as a child smothered by his mother's overbearing presence, as
she was more interested in her career than she was in him, and then the
film shows him as he is now, a respected member of his community but a
very lonely man. It, somehow, takes a familiar journey down this
director's path even if it seems the director is drifting off into
foreign territory. The innovative Canadian of Armenian descent, Atom
Egoyan, who has in the past covered such familiar themes as he does
here, revisits the themes of betrayal, familial ills, religious
conflicts, sexual secrets, videotapes, and uncertain identities.
The film loses its intensity somewhere along the time a naive,
unfortunate young Irish girl leaves her home in lush County Cork to come
to industrial Birmingham, England, in search of her boyfriend who is
seeking work there. Her main reason for coming is to tell the one she
loves, that he made her pregnant and she wants the baby. When there, she
will meet a seemingly altruistic stranger who it turns out is a serial
killer.
Felicia (Cassidy) is desperate and alienated, after hearing from her
embittered Irish nationalist widowed father rant on that her boyfriend
Johnny is a traitor to Ireland, that he lied to her by not telling her
he joined the British army, and that she is carrying in her a child who
is the enemy of Ireland. She foolishly believes that her Johnny is
working in the industrial Midland's of England, in a lawnmower factory.
She gets some money to make the journey there in search of him from her
dying great-grandmother, after receiving no letters from him and of
being rebuffed by Johnny's mother, as she throws the letters Felicia
gives her to send to Johnny in the fire, after reading them and
sneering.
The bedraggled Felicia can't find Johnny in the polluted city of
Birmingham, but Joseph Ambrose Hilditch (Hoskins), on a shopping spree,
meets her when she asks for directions and he chats her up, and the next
day, he gives her a lift to a place where he says a lot of Irish lads
work. He is a lonely gourmet catering manager in a factory, who forms
this odd relationship with this young girl based on his need to talk
with someone outside of work.
While she looks for Johnny in the factory, he goes through her backpack
and steals her money. When he is driving Felicia, there are flashbacks
of other girls he befriended and rode in the same car with and with whom
he recorded their conversations, which we disturbingly hear, and even
though it is not shown what eventually happened to them, it is eerily
certain that Hilditch acts to befriend these helpless prostitutes or
runaway girls, secretly videotaping them, to then kill them when they
don't need him anymore and try to leave.
The film is adept at using flashbacks from both Felicia's and Hilditch's
dysfunctional childhoods, to show how innocent and angelic she is, and
how troubled and confused he is, and how she comes from a poor
background raised without a mother and he from a wealthy family raised
by a mother who used him to promote her cooking show. Hilditch lives
alone in the large clapboard house he inherited from his mother, and
surrounds himself with 1950s memorabilia, including Mix Masters, and
listens to syrupy Mantovani music and artless ballads like "My Special
Angel," which are on LP's. He watches videos in his kitchen while he is
cooking the same food he sees on the videotapes. The videos are of his
sophisticated French mother Gala, who was a famous TV host of a cooking
show in the 1950s, and the videos also show him performing with her,
appearing as a fat and awkward child. He is now a stout, balding man, in
his fifties, who is friendly and respected at his workplace as a man
with impeccable culinary taste.
After leaving Hilditch, Felicia is approached by a Jamaican Christian
missionary (Claire Benedict), who has big shiny teeth like a wolf. She
talks her into staying at their organization's shelter. Felicia notices
her money is missing while there, and the missionary people react
negatively to her saying that they might have stolen her money. She is
then forced back into the house of Hilditch, and we see how the two
troubled souls relate to each other in a heartbreaking way.
The crux of the film centers around her reactions from the stern
rejection from her father and Johnny's mother, and of being ignored by
Johnny. The missionary who is in the business of saving souls, is shown
to be full of words that are robotically recited, because when she has a
chance to save the helpless Felicia, she doesn't even try. Curiously,
the only warmth and help Felicia receives, is from Hilditch, and he is
the one who wants to kill her.
Elaine Cassidy captures the character's youthful naivity and quiet
determination to get on with her life despite the upheavals in it, as
she is seen as too inexperienced and vulnerable for all the evil there
is she has to face in the place she was born in and the foreign place
she traveled to. She has come to England as an innocent, but after her
abortion, she is no longer completely innocent, though she still remains
ignorant of her situation.
Bob Hoskins performance is brilliantly mannered, even if he chews the
scenery to gain such control, but, nevertheless, he is engaging as a
manipulative predator and someone who could be both charming and
frightening. His performance has the proper mixture of terror for what
he has become and sympathy for what he hasn't become.
What fails this otherwise competent and worthwhile production, is that
everything falls too easily into psychological place by the film's end.
We are led to believe we understand too much about this serial killer
and that he can be redeemed, but the reality is, that we understand too
little about him, despite the appropriate effort that is made to
understand him. When the nature of the relationship Hoskins has in mind
with Felicia becomes obvious, the film can't recover from this knowledge
and it becomes more natural for the audience to care that the angelic
Cassidy somehow survives what is intended her, rather than the film
going into deeper and more unfamiliar ground. This serial killer film
falls below the achievements of M and Peeping Tom, as it falls into the
range of films that miss their mark but are still enriching.

Writer/director Atom Egoyan, whose last picture was the universally
acclaimed THE SWEET HEREAFTER (number two on my best picture of the year
list in 1997), is back with another sad tale, FELICIA'S JOURNEY.  This time,
working from a novel by William Trevor, he has crafted a delicate,
Hitchcockean mystery.
In a tender, subtle performance, Bob Hoskins plays Joseph Ambrose Hilditch,
a catering manager at a large factory in Birmingham, England.  With a heart
of gold, Hilditch looks after the food the workers are served, as if he were
running a 3-star Michelin restaurant.  "Food must be served by caring
hands," the gentle but firm Hilditch lectures a salesman who dares propose
bringing vending machines onto the premises to replace the cafeteria.  "It
keeps our spirits up.  It makes us feel loved."
Not many industrial cafeteria managers care so much about their products,
but Hilditch is different.  Raised closely -- way too closely as we will
discover -- by his mother, Hilditch stills watches her on old videos.  A
flamboyant woman, she was a famous chef with her own cooking program on
television.  She smothered her son with her overbearing demeanor, and he
gagged sometimes on her food.  Still, as an adult, he prepares lavish meals
daily -- solely for himself -- based on her video instructions.
This man, who looks like he wouldn't hurt a fly, is also a great befriender
of young women.  He listens to them, when no one else does.  One day,
Felicia (Elaine Cassidy) comes from Ireland, searching desperately for a
lost boyfriend whom she must locate.  Hilditch, of course, offers to help.
Egoyan is a master at creating a mood.  Britain's industrial heartland looks
cold, gray and dreary in contrast to Hilditch's bright, fully equipped
kitchen.  And Ireland has never looked lovelier with its church ruins and
lush, rolling countryside.
The two leads each seem to be holding back the real stories of their lives.
As the movie unfolds, we learn exactly why Felicia feels compelled to make
her journey and why Hilditch likes young women to confide in him.  Neither
answer will come as much of a shock.  Given that the element of surprise
isn't present to any extent, Egoyan makes a strategic mistake in the film's
structure.  The completely satisfying setup of the plot is allowed to go on
for too long.  It isn't until after the film's midway point that the picture
is finally ready to get under way.  Then, when it should be getting into
gear, Egoyan gives Hilditch several long monologues that try viewers'
patience.  The lethargic second half is a let down as it never quite
delivers on the promise of the first.
An incongruous subplot that seems lifted out of a bad comedy features a
group of evangelical Christians as the story's buffoons.  Using a colorful,
popup book, "The Road to Paradise," they peddle God door-to-door with the
unrelenting fervor of a Fuller Brush man.  They serve, however, only to
clutter up the storyline and slow its momentum when it should be building
up.
Hitchcock made fascinating films that, compared to the body of his work,
were relatively run of the mill for him.  So it is with Egoyan's FELICIA'S
JOURNEY, an intriguing picture that's ultimately a disappointment because
it's a near miss.  Well worth seeing, but far from the director's best.
FELICIA'S JOURNEY runs too long at 1:56.  It is rated PG-13 for mature
thematic elements and related disturbing images and would be fine for
teenagers.

In FELICIA'S JOURNEY, Canadian director Atom Egoyan has created a quiet and 
horrifying masterpiece.  Lead actor Bob Hoskins has said about his 
experience shooting the picture, "There are some terrible moments in the 
film, but I had to play them."  Hoskins also described his character, 
Hilditch the catering manager, as "a mixture of Jack the Ripper and Winnie 
the Pooh."
Felicia is a young Irish woman who has left her condemning father and set 
off to England to find the boyfriend who has abandoned her.  In her quest to 
find Johnny, Felicia begins to scour factories where she believes he might 
be working.  Though she is unsuccessful, she finds encouragement in the kind 
Mr. Hilditch, a quiet and proper man who keeps happening across her in 
various places.
Viewers catch a hint of a dark side in Hilditch when in a conversation to 
Felicia, he mentions his wife.  Because we have already seen the single man 
in his empty house, we sense his agenda is twisted.  When Egoyan introduces 
pieces of videotape that Hilditch has made of various girls riding in his 
car, we begin to trace an unspeakably evil pattern.  This man creates 
scenarios that lure "lost girls" into his life; when they gain some relief 
from his kindness and begin to depart, Hilditch drugs and murders them.
So we know relatively early that things are amiss within Hilditch's motives. 
  What's fascinating is the way the film studies this repulsive character, 
bringing out extreme frailty and loneliness within such a maniac.  And just 
as the filmmaker has attended to numerous details in the script and set 
decoration and character history, Hoskins carries off a masterful depiction 
of humanity forsaken.
Bob Hoskins is the only actor I can picture playing Hilditch.  For this 
character Hoskins has created a monster who manages to compose himself 
enough to get through one lonely day after another.  Hilditch seems 
compulsive in everything:  hair neatly combed, tie and vest always in their 
proper place, the man seems the quintessential British gentleman; he even 
uses the stereotype of endurance as part of his terrible ruse.  Talking 
about his fictional late wife, he tells Felicia he must go on, chin up in 
the face of hardship.  In all the mannerisms he lends to the character, 
Hoskins is brilliant.  Particularly interesting are the moments in which we 
can see triggers being set off within Hilditch's psyche.  In one scene in 
the hospital where he has told Felicia his wife is dying, Hilditch glimpses 
an old movie on a television in a waiting room.  Suddenly we see Hilditch as 
a boy, sitting beside his mother in a movie palace.  The film shows John the 
Baptist's head on a platter, the horrible queen examining it.  In the 
balcony Hilditch's mother hands him her opera glasses so that he might see 
the horrid spectacle more closely.  Though he is appalled, the boy watches, 
fascinated.  What a telling scene!  An attractive seductress who is cold at 
heart but who can be immensely charming - this was the woman who inflicted 
quite a bit of damage on her son.  Watch the snatch of old movie, Hilditch 
freezes in revolting reverie.  Although Hilditch's history is a document of 
premeditated evil, some of his emotions are easier to understand because of 
the care taken by William Trevor and Atom Egoyan in sketching in Hilditch's 
backstory.
Elaine Cassidy, a relative newcomer to film, plays Felicia with great 
understatement.  It's almost a tone of passivity caused by innocence and 
politeness that she creates - a tone that causes her plight in the story to 
be more frightening.  Cassidy works well with Hoskins, both actors knowing 
when to pause to underscore ideas with just the right intensity.  Watching 
these two work, one never feels an insult to the intelligence.
In the grainy flashbacks - scenes from the cooking show as well as more 
private shots of little Joey Hilditch discovering a wallet and stealing 
money - we see a few of the causes of Hilditch's psychosis.  The mother, 
Gala, is played by Egoyan's wife, actress Arsinee Khanjian.  Lovely but 
exploitative, Gala appears to use her boy as an adorable on-camera sidekick. 
  In a memorable scene, she places a chunk of liver in Joey's mouth, and the 
boy gags; watching a tape of this embarrassment, the adult Hilditch again 
gags; his sense of history nags that strongly at him.  In all of her scenes, 
Khanjian is the perfect, subtle siren.
In a memorable supporting role, Claire Benedict plays Miss Calligary, a 
fervent door-to-door evangelist.  Her presence adds just a bit of humor to 
the narrative, as she spouts her flowery Biblical rhetoric.  Near the 
closing of the film her aggression of the spirit causes a sort of epiphany 
in Hilditch.  It's a dark comic moment that could have been written by 
Flannery O'Connor, the most perverted recesses of the human heart tugged 
suddenly into the open.
Irish novelist William Trevor penned the book that was adapted by Egoyan.  
What's original about his adaptation is that Egoyan manages to avoid clichés 
about serial killers.  The camera sweeps leisurely about the grand house 
that Hilditch grew up in;  we glance mementos from the lives of Hilditch and 
his mother.  One room is dedicated to her image; it's a repository of 
souvenirs from her television cooking show, photographs of herself, even 
relics like an old blender that Hilditch resurrects when his blender 
malfunctions.  Attention to detail sets the story going in a very 
well-developed direction.
FELICIA'S JOURNEY is rated PG-13 for dark subject matter, though there are 
no real scenes of violence, and no profanity.  Because of its unsettling 
nature, I would not recommend it for children under 12.  Its pace is 
necessarily slow at times, filling out various dimensions of Hilditch's 
character or Felicia's background.  Unfortunately, its status as an art film 
will not gain it wide release; but it is worth a trip to a nearby city art 
house.  The bottom line: it is a superior character study that will engage 
you for every minute of its run, but it is a disturbing film you may not go 
out of your way to watch a second time.
