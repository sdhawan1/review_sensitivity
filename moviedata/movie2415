"Steamboat Bill, Jr." was one of Buster Keaton's last silent
films.  There are several spectacular stunts, which is
Keaton's trademark, but sometimes the story lags.
The plot has a burly riverboat captain (Ernest Torrence)
facing new competition from wealthy rival King (Tom McGuire)
who has built a "floating palace".  McGuire and Torrence
despise each other.  Torrence's blue-blooded son (Buster Keaton) 
pays a visit to his long-lost father.  Torrence tries to
make a man out of him, while Keaton has a greater interest
in King's daughter (Marion Byron).
"Steamboat Bill, Jr." is most famous for a dangerous stunt
in which a heavy wall falls on Keaton, who survives because
his body is positioned exactly corresponding to an open window.
The film was also the inspiration for "Steamboat Willie", the
animation short that marked the debut of Mickey Mouse.
There are some problems with the story.  Byron is not given
enough incentive to fall for Keaton.  Keaton's character
changes to suit the plot.  At first, he is comic and clumsy,
but becomes an action hero by film's end (a recurrent theme
in Keaton's silent films).  When Torrence is jailed,
Keaton tries to smuggle in a file hidden in a loaf of bread,
an unlikely action for his character, and also a foolish
action that had little chance to succeed.  Finally, the
cyclone at the end of the film, while leading to decent
slapstick and stunts, is inconsistent, leveling some buildings
and boats while others are left completely unchanged.
Several people are endangered and must be rescued by Keaton.
These people just happen to be the main characters.
