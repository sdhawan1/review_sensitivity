Commandment Five:  "Thou shalt not kill." 
     A SHORT FILM ABOUT KILLING, Krzysztof Kieslowski's powerful 
examination of the nature of murder, was a stunning success at the 1988 
Cannes Film Festival, taking home the Jury prize.  In the same year, the 
film also captured Europe's coveted Felix award.  An extended version of 
DECALOGUE 5, A SHORT FILM ABOUT KILLING was one of two features to 
spring from Kieslowski's ten-part television drama about applying the 
Ten Commandments to modern-day life (the other being A SHORT FILM ABOUT 
LOVE).  However, while DECALOGUE could not be released in North America 
because of a distribution snafu, A SHORT FILM ABOUT KILLING can, and has 
been. 
     Wrenching in its uncompromising indictment of capital punishment, A 
SHORT FILM ABOUT KILLING doesn't pull punches.  Sitting through this 
film is the emotional equivalent of going through a grinder.  Everything 
about the production is dark -- from its themes and characters to the 
manner in which Kieslowski and cinematographer Slawomir Idiak chose to 
shoot the picture.  Bleaker even than BLUE, A SHORT FILM ABOUT KILLING 
captures the perfect tone for an autopsy of its subject matter. 
     The movie follows the activities of twenty year old Jacek (Miroslaw 
Baka), a seemingly-normal young man with a sadistic streak.  He goes 
through a day, wandering around town but rarely interacting with anyone.  
Then, suddenly, in a seemingly-unprovoked action, he murders a cab 
driver (Jan Tesarz) by garroting him then beating him to a bloody pulp 
with a rock.  Jacek is captured and tried.  Despite the best efforts of 
a newly-practicing, idealistic lawyer named Piotr (Krzysztof Globisz), 
Jacek is sentenced to die.  Before the execution, the condemned man 
spends some time in a cell with his attorney, telling fragments of a 
tragic life's story and expressing his final request -- to be buried in 
a plot alongside his father and beloved sister. 
     There are two murders in A SHORT FILM ABOUT KILLING:  the slaughter 
of the cab driver, which runs slightly over seven minutes in length (and 
apparently is the longest murder in the history of cinema) and the 
execution of Jacek, a scene that lasts about five minutes.  Kieslowski 
doesn't spare the audience any details, and takes pains to illustrate 
the parallels between Jacek's brutality in the back of the cab and the 
Law's cruelty with the noose.  In the director's words, "It's wrong no 
matter why you kill, no matter whom you kill and no matter who does the 
killing... Inflicting death is probably the highest form of violence 
imaginable; capital punishment is an infliction of death." 
     Until he actually throws the garrote around the cab driver's neck, 
Jacek doesn't seem particularly abnormal or homicidal.  While it's true 
that he's lonely and isolated (reasons for which we learn during his 
final confession to Piotr), we don't see him as a detestable person.  In 
fact, Kieslowski makes it apparent that his victim is little more than a 
self-centered boor, and probably less likable than the killer.  There is 
no doubt that Kieslowski deplores Jacek's action -- the viciousness of 
the scene illustrates that.  However, the director makes an effort to 
humanize the murderer so the audience will realize that the execution 
does far more than merely blot out a "blight on society." 
     Jacek's story, which is the focus of the film, is intercut with 
moments from Piotr's life.  (In fact, most of the twenty-five minutes of 
extra material beyond what's in DECALOGUE 5 centers on Piotr.)  
Initially a bystander, then an observer, the lawyer is drawn into the 
tale to become part of it.  His last attempts to aid and comfort Jacek 
are feeble protests against the great wrong that is about to be 
committed in the name of justice. 
     From a purely technical standpoint, A SHORT FILM ABOUT KILLING is 
an abnormal viewing experience.  More than 600 hand-made greenish 
filters were used to mute colors and distance the audience.  The movie 
often appears dark and grungy, and there are times when a blackish halo 
surrounds various characters.  Only in the final scene, after the 
killing is done, are the filters removed -- but all is far from right in 
the world, as Piotr's ravaged features indicate. 
     A SHORT FILM ABOUT KILLING is as grim as a motion picture gets, but 
the intelligence and insight applied to its themes will keep the viewer 
riveted despite the pervasive gloom.  Whether an individual agrees or 
disagrees with Kieslowski's position on the issue of capital punishment, 
there is no denying that his case against it is powerfully made.  And, 
while the director cannot answer the question of why men kill, his 
scrutiny of murder offers a bloody portrait worth repeated study.
