         Before you spend countless hours at the word processor turning
that great high-concept idea for a movie into a full-length screenplay,
realize that somewhere in Hollywood some other writer has probably had
exactly the same flash of brilliance you did.
 Don't believe it? Look at the past few years. In 1998, we had
two epics in which Earth was about to be obliterated by giant rocks from
outer space: a comet in "Deep Impact," an asteroid in "Armageddon." In
1997, two thrillers revolved around murders in the Capitol, "Absolute
Power" and "Murder at 1600." In 1996, there were two extravaganzas about
evil aliens terrorizing the planet ("Independence Day" and "Mars
Attacks!").
 And let's not even try to count how many "body-switcher"
comedies there were in the late 1980s.
 With "Stir of Echoes" and "The Sixth Sense" currently slugging
it out for space at the cineplex, it would seem little boys talking to
ghosts is the latest trendy topic. But before you dismiss
writer-director David Koepp's "Stir" as a rip-off, take into account
that it was filming at the same time as "Sense" and that it's based on a
novel by Richard Matheson that predates even Stephen King's "The
Shining," which is for many people the last word in psychic-kid
literature.
 But now that millions have seen "Sense" (in some cases, more
than once), "Stir" can't help but look like a rehash. Although the
stories eventually take different courses, the initial similarities
between the two pictures are striking and, unfortunately, mostly
unflattering to Koepp's film. "Stir" does, however, have some terrific
performances that elevate it several notches above the run-of-the-mill
spook show, particularly from Kevin Bacon, who proves you need not go
over the top to play a man on the brink of madness.
 Bacon plays Tom, a blue-collar Chicagoan with a tough but
faithful wife named Maggie (Kathryn Erbe, an actress who always seems to
find intriguing angles in her characters) and a wide-eyed 5-year-old son
named Jake (Zachary David Cope) who spends a considerable amount of time
in what seem to be one-way conversations with unseen friends. Tom also
has a sister-in-law, Lisa (Illena Douglas), who fancies herself an
amateur hypnotherapist.
 At a beer-fueled bash one night, Lisa hypnotizes the skeptical
Tom and is surprised by how receptive he is to her suggestions. Soon
after coming out of the trance, Tom begins having gruesome
hallucinations about missing teeth and missing teens, sleeping 12 hours
a day and guzzling orange juice as if he were at an all-night rave
party. Only Jake seems to have a clue what's going on when Daddy
suddenly decides to dig up the backyard.
 Like "Sense," "Stir" works up a convincingly chilly atmosphere
and has a few jolting moments. To his credit, Koepp doesn't rely too
heavily on bursts of loud music or people jumping out of the shadows to
generate cheap shocks. Bacon is outstanding, and Douglas and Erbe do
wonders with their somewhat sketchy roles.
 But there are enough odd loose ends in "Stir" to indicate Koepp
(whose screenplays include "Death Becomes Her" and "Jurassic Park,"
among others) was so preoccupied with his directorial chores he didn't
pay enough attention to his material. Subplots about Maggie's pregnancy
and a vaguely creepy cult are introduced with great fanfare and then
abruptly discarded. Even Jake's gift, which seems to be the key to the
whole story, turns out to play only a minor role in the overall scheme
of things.
 Ultimately, where "Stir" suffers most in comparison with
"Sense" is in its last reel. "Sense" has a climax that ambushes you and
leaves you dazed. On the other hand, the ending of "Stir" is telegraphed
so far in advance, you won't need a psychic to determine what's in Tom
and Maggie's future. James Sanford

   Limbo must be a fascinating place indeed, the subject of so
many movies during the past 12 months.  In John Sayles'
"Limbo," lost souls are stranded on a deserted island
wondering whether the chopper approaching to pick them up
houses friend or foe.  Vincent Ward's "What Dreams May
Come" centers on a fellow who seeks his wife in a literal
purgatory.  In "The Sixth Sense," a force is not ready to go to
his final resting place until he is redeemed, and in "The
Haunting" some silly dead kids, worked to death by a 19th
century robber baron, slide and glide under sheets and pillars
of a capacious mansion awaiting their maternal savior. 
These films, some effective, some not, possess features that 
endear them to some audiences, but they are hardly hair-
rising.  Unless you're one of those fans taken in by a dazzling
marketing campaign for the inept "The Blair Witch Project,"
you'll wonder whether the summer season will be devoid of
genuine, spine-chilling terror.  If you've been fearing not at
what Hollywood and the indie studios have offered so far,
then fear not: "Stir of Echoes" answers our plea.
   Directing his own script from Richard Matheson's book,
David Koepp (scripter for "Jurassic Park," "Mission:
Impossible," "The Lost World," "Snake Eyes") displays a
depressing working-class Chicago neighborhood of row-
houses affected with such satanic goings-on that at least
three of its families would wish for Billy Sunday to shut the
city down.  The story revolves about the efforts of one
ordinary guy to liberate a tortured soul, allowing the spirit to
lose its ghastly pallor and skip off into the sunset a happy
apparition. The Greeks and Elizabethans believed before our
own time that a murder victim cannot rest in peace until
punishment is meted out to the killers, setting the universe
once again in balance.  Unbenownst to him, one ordinary
working-class guy must undergo that task in our own age.
   Such a task must have been the most remote purpose in
the mind of Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon), a thoroughly prosaic
blue-collar worker who is married to a caring wife, Maggie
(Kathryn Erbe) and who has an unusually precocious little
boy, Jake.  So ordinary is this man that he arouses the
rancor of his cosmopolitan sister-in-law, Lisa (Illeana
Douglas), who challenges him to broaden his horizons by
putting himself under hypnosis.  Despite his feeling that
hypnosis is mere superstition, Tom proves eminently
suggestible--so much so that he is put into a deep trance and
has apparently been given enough post-hypnotic suggestion
that he now sees what others do not.  The ghost of a young
woman appears intermittently before his startled eyes.  His
entire vista turns suddenly into a photographic negative
seemingly lit by an infrared beam that appears with the
buzzing sound of fluorescent lighting.  Washing up, he
suddenly spots a swirl of blood in his drinking glass.  A tooth
falls out, hits the sink and disappears. Coincidentally, his
young son Jake communicates regularly with this deathly pale
specter, accepting the altered reality in the matter-of-fact
ways that kids are wont to do.
   As the story progresses, becoming more vivid,
melodramatic, and swiftly-paced, the mundane Tom descends
into the maelstrom of the obsessed, determined to get literally
to the bottom of the mystery of this ghostly presence.  He
begins excavating his basement like the James Brolin
character in "The Amityville Horror."  As the movie takes on
the aspects of a macabre delight such as Edgar Allan Poe
would have imagined, the panic that Tom feels communicates
easily to his audience thanks to Kevin Bacon's astonishing
ability to alter his heretofore unassuming, working-class ways
into those of a bristling psychotic perfectly prepared to
destroy his home and otherwise stable family life in pursuit of
answers.  A crackerjack editing job, juxtaposing the psychic
world with the commonplace one keeps the audience on the
edge.  A solid performance by Illeana Douglas as the
hypnotist offended by the commonplace and Kathryn Erbe as
Tom's increasingly concerned and devoted wife makes "Stir
of Echoes" the first scary movie of the year.

Starring Kevin Bacon, Kathryn Erbe, Illeana Douglas. Rated R.
And so the horror craze of 1999 continues. The audience is hungry for
more fright-fests and Hollywood is more than ready to deliver them.
David Koepp, screenwriter of such flashy nothings as The Lost World and
Mission: Impossible is the latest to take a stab at this most lucrative
of genres and his Stir of Echoes is entertaining and, for the first time
this year, scary, though far too conventional. There have already been
complaints about the film Echoing The Sixth Sense and they are not all
together incorrect, though Stir of Echoes is a far more light-hearted
effort than its poignant predecessor.
Kevin Bacon's "center of the movie universe" status (popularized by the
"Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" party game, in which a player would try to
connect Bacon to another actor in six movies or less) has been fading,
of late, what with this being only his second "major" motion picture
since Sleepers in 1996 (unless you count Picture Perfect, but you'd have
to be insane). This is probably a step down from Wild Things in clout,
but certainly a step up in quality.
Bacon plays Tom Witzky, a Chicago electrician, living with his wife (the
magnificent, though heretofore inconspicuous Kathryn Erbe) and his young
son. He notices that his son talks to someone who isn't there (in fact,
this is the basis for a staggeringly effective opening scene) but passes
it off, until something happens that opens his eyes. Now, Tom is
introduced as a harshy cynical fella, so when at a party his sister-in-
law starts talking about feats performed with the help of hypnosis, he
dares her to hypnotize him. Not surprisingly it works. Another wonderful
scene, and before we know it, he is out of stasis -- but something isn't
quite right.
He starts seeing visions. Scary visions. Violent visions. They pop up at
the oddest times. Then they disappear. At first Tom is scared, but he
soon becomes curious. Who is his son talking to? What's happening to
that strange girl in his dreams? What's that song he keeps hearing? How
can he make all this go away?
Scream's got nothing on this baby. In terms of jolts, Stir of Echoes is
second to none; a vertable jump-o-rama. In that sense, this is the first
"scary" movie this year: neither Sixth Sense nor The Blair Witch Project
managed this sort of visceral thrill (though these two were going for
psychological suspense rather than "Boo" moments).
Another thing Stir of Echoes has going for it is its unexpectedly witty
script. Not only is it full of one-liners, some generic, some not, but
it also has some funny characters. Tom's new-age sister-in-law has some
truly guffaw-worthy moments, and Tom's own blind determination towards
the end of the film is presented in an unconventionally innocuous way.
The film manages to keep up an extraordinary level of suspense while
maintaining an easy-going and unpretentious attitude. The action is
ominous and somehow gleefully facetious at the same time.
Plot comparisons to The Sixth Sense are not only inevitable, they're
justified. Stir of Echoes can not be faulted for being a "rip-off", per
se, as it was the first of the two to be filmed, but to those not made
aware of that crucial detail, the similarities between the two will seem
suspicious, at best. The most prevalent parallel, of course, is of a
young kid who talks to ghosts. Another: both films involve a murdered
girl whose ghost appears to the main character and wants him to do
something for her. The two movies are so uncannily similar in some
respects that I'm forced to wonder whether the two screenwriters aren't
roommates.
Of course to those (few) who didn't see The Sixth Sense none of this
will matter one bit. Standing on its own, this is pretty good stuff: an
entertaining and reasonably frightening thriller that, quite
shamelessly, makes you laugh and jump almost at the same time. If you
did see Sixth Sense, I'm going to say that this one is only worth paying
to see if you are willing to put the Bruce Willis movie out of your head
for two hours. It isn't a fun experience if you're subconciously forced
to constantly make comparisons to something you've seen before. It also
isn't particularly fair to this gem of a thriller, which, I shall remind
you once more, was filmed before its unwitting companion.

Kevin Bacon usually does his best work as a character actor. His three best
performances are in 'Sleepers' (1996) where he played a sexually abusive and
brutally violent reform school guard.  In 'Murder in the First' (1995), he
played a man driven to the brink of insanity after being locked in the
solitary confinement wing of prison for too long and in 'JFK', he played a
male prostitute with a passion for wanting to tell the truth and his low
rent state of mind displayed a protracted passion for political ignorance.
Despite his great work, Bacon has never been nominated for an Academy award.
Some of my friends liked his work in 1992's 'A Few Good Men' and 1994's 'The
River Wild' and it's hard to ignore him in those films as well.
"We bury our dead alive, don't we?"  This is a quote from an episode of
television's 'The X-Files'.  An observation is made in that episode that
conscience is really the dead talking to us, those who have died violent
deaths and cry out for justice.  An interesting theory and the idea of
paranormal intrigue involving the dead has long been a fascinating part of
going to the movies.  But how many film makers and actors get it right?
Hypnosis.  How much do we really know about it?  According to what we learn
in 'Stir of Echoes', only about 8 per cent of the population can really go
under its influence.  If this is true, Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon in a good
leading role) is one of the 8 per cent.  Tom and his wife Maggie (Kathryn
Erbe) attend a house party in their Chicago neighbourhod one evening where
the subject of hypnosis comes up and Tom agrees to be put under the spell by
his sister-in-law Lisa (Ileana Douglas).  Shortly after he is in a complete
trance, Tom begins to experience flashes of psychic visions involving a dead
teenage girl and her spirit roaming about in his home and around the
neighbourhood.  This is a part of the plot carried out for the entire film.
We learn that the Witzky's son Jake (Zachary David Cope) can see the ghost
of dead people.  And now dad begins to exhibit some of the same
characteristics.  A clever way to portray this in the movie.  Usually, in
other films, we see the eldest members of the family with this sense come
forward first and then the children but in this case it comes naturally to
the child while dad has it buried in his sub conscious mind and has it
brought out by the magic of hypnosis.
'Stir of Echoes' is a mind numbing and adrenalin pumping thriller that uses
the supernatural, a thrilling sub text and crime as its main elements of
entertainment.  As the film progresses, it appears to make no sense
whatsoever, a merry go round of unpleasant images that don't seem to tell us
anything.  But then it clicks in in an anti-climactic manner to illustrate
why it kept stringing us along from the start.
The film is based on the novel 'A Stir of Echoes' by Richard Matheson whose
other novel 'What Dreams May Come', was brought to the big screen in 1998
starring Robin Williams as a man who goes to heaven but learns his wife is
in hell and strives to bring her back with him to eternal paradise.
Matheson has a fascination with fantasy but 'Stir of Echoes' is more than
that.  It's an honest and genuine thriller that sends shivers down one's
spine and I was very impressed with writer/director David Koepp's ability to
keep the chills coming and keep the whole thing seem credible to feed the
notion that things displayed in this film are possible if you believe the
ideas of some theologians and people who make a habit documenting the
paranormal experience.
I immediately drew comparisons from this film to 1983's 'The Dead Zone' and
this year's 'The Sixth Sense'.  Those films have a more human look to them
that 'Stir of Echoes'.  A more calculating sense of emotion if you will.
But for all of its effort, 'Stir of Echoes' stops just short of being a
great character study.  It seems more concerned with the chills than with
developing great characters all around.  It still manages to haunt us with
the miraculous wonder of great storytelling and it may be one of the year's
defining films that keeps in check with the definition of "on the edge of
your seat".

This film has been compared to "The Sixth Sense." While it has the
similarity of a man and boy who see a ghost, the rest is quite different. In
this case, the man (Kevin Bacon) is the boy's father and there is only one
ghost -- haunting their home.
Bacon delivers a strong performance, sporting an picture-perfect working
class Chicago accent. The build up of tension and suspense is sewn together
well, but the conclusion has more of a TV mystery show spirit than that of a
powerful feature climax.
The motions of the ghost (stirred by frame manipulation) create an
excellently eerie feeling to her presence. I also enjoyed the chilling way
Bacon's confrontation left him pale and out of breath. I could almost feel
that chill. However, there was little point in contriving a way to make the
ghost a threat to the living. (I'd have to fault the "Sixth Sense" for
taking a few stabs in that direction as well). It's already scary dealing
with a believable ghost -- there's no need to invent a threat to life.
Also, when the wife "accidentally" stumbles upon some information from
another guy who sees ghosts (and knows how to deal with them), she doesn't
share this information with her husband who is clearly less than stabilized
by his knew found "open-mindedness." Additionally, this character
(ghost-seer guy), though carefully introduced into the script; disappears
from it rather promptly without a trace.
Intriguing and chilling most of the way through, "Stirs of Echoes" is a
solid "B" film.

Take Chinatown as the archetypical detective movie. In it a private
investigator has to reconstruct some crime bit by bit. And the crime of
course happened before the movie started. And everyone tries to steer him
off the case. And it all gets real personal real fast, to the point where
the detective's need to know is held in balance against his need to live.
These conventional developments we expect from a hard-boiled detective
movie. What we don't expect them from so much, though, is horror, which is
part of the appeal of director David Koepp's Stir of Echoes (based on
Richard Matheson's book)--that, although it has dead people walking the
halls, is nevertheless structured after the traditional detective movie,
even down to the opening, where Tom Witzky (Kevin
Bacon)--private-investigator-like--is minding his own business, just trying
to scratch out a decent living, when a 'strange woman' enters and turns his
world inside-out.
Or, specifically, via an overextended Big Lebowski-ish hypnosis session, she
accidentally flips a switch in his psyche, which transforms him into a
'receiver,' which translates into the ability to see dead people walking
around, to catch glimpses of the past, the future, all that. But of course
Witzky never quite sees it all in detail (qua Blink), which is tantalizing
enough to compel him to reconstruct bit by bit whatever 'crime' occurred
before the movie opened. Think Poltergeist; it's the same story with a
tighter cast and better music (or, it's 1996's Spectre with good direction).
And his 'investigation' unfolds conventionally, with all the appropriate
setbacks, distractions, isolations, etc. He even gets some help from his son
(Zachary David Cope), who's a 'natural' receiver, not unlike Haley Joel
Osment from Sixth Sense, though Zachary David Cope is no Haley Joel Osment.
Where Stir of Echoes breaks from the traditional detective movie set-up is
that the 'detective' here actually has a home life--nominally pregnant wife
and prescient son--which serves to heighten what's at stake for him here.
And it is effective in that regard, though at times the rounds of marital
conflict and reconciliation seem a bit forced, more dramatically necessary
than developmentally. This home-life, however, does give Witzky room to
complain that his life is too 'ordinary,' which, in a horror-movie, is
another way of asking for it. Soon enough everything's all but ordinary, and
Witzky only wants to close the Doors of Perception which Jim Morrison wanted
open so badly in The Doors.
And it's easy to understand why he wants them closed: the undead he can see
now are easily the summer's scariest, even moreso than Sixth Sense's, this
due largely to how Koepp renders undead movement--both fast and contained,
as in Jakob's Ladder, which is for some reason primally disturbing. Which is
of course exactly what we pay for--to be scared. In that sense, Stir of
Echoes satisfies, and then some. However. For a while, when the external
pressure Witzky's facing is at low ebb, Stir of Echoes tries to maintain the
tension via the undead doing all the typical haunting things--turning out
lights, standing around every corner, etc, which doesn't fit with how the
undead in the reality of Stir of Echoes are 'supposed' to act. But oh well.
It happens in Romero too, whom Koepp unsubtly references. Aside from that,
and in spite of an ill-advised (see: non-catchy) title, Stir of Echoes is
high-caliber horror, the kind that stays with you a little longer than you
really want it to.

After being hypnotized, a man believes there is a ghost in his house.
    Two low-key summer horror films have become surprise financial
successes this year: The Blair Witch Project and The Sixth Sense. Each
has made well over $100 million in North America, based on a combination
of strong word of mouth and clever advertising. If a film's box office
take were based primarily on its quality, Stir Of Echoes would join
Blair and Sense in grossing far more money than expected, for it is as
scary, if not scarier than the other two. Writer/director David Koepp
has given Artisan Entertainment, the folks who distributed Blair Witch a
second creepy hit.
    The story gets going after Tom Witzky (Bacon), an average
blue-collar dad, gets hypnotized by his wife Maggie's (Erbe) sister Lisa
(Douglas) at a party. While the hypnosis goes as expected to the
party-goers, it triggers something in Tom's head. Things begin to change
around him (blinking red lights let off a strange hum, for example), and
he fights to stay in control of his own senses. Where these experiences
take Tom, Maggie and their son Jake (Cope), who Tom thinks might have
some answers, is down a dark path that will scare and disturb you.
    David Koepp keeps the action localized; the majority of the action
takes place at Tom's house or just down the street. By keeping things at
home, Koepp is able to proceed without having to resort to any clumsy
segues (montages of driving down roads as we move from one city to
another etc.). Unfortunately, the dread and spookiness of Stir Of Echoes
are frequently interrupted by moments of levity. Humour can take the
tension away from a scene faster than any shoddy special effect or poor
acting. Several tense moments become completely diffused by a few
misplaced jokes. Also, there are a couple of plot developments that are
left unresolved, though to mention them would be to give too much away.
    Kevin Bacon handles the duel task of playing an everyman and a man
losing his sanity admirably. His total lack of understanding of what is
happening to him is believable, as are the reactions from his wife
Maggie. Kathryn Erbe is given a role meatier and better written than
that of most "wife who can no longer handle her husband" parts. While it
is still a supporting role, her Maggie is moving as she watches both her
husband and her son enter what she calls "a private club that I'm not
invited to", where they whisper about things all day long. As Jake,
Zachary Cope equals the performance of Haley Joel Osment in the Sixth
Sense, but gets less screen time. Both children manage the same trick,
making the audience creeped out by their apparent acceptance of the way
things are.
    Fans of Blair and Sixth Sense will almost surely love Stir Of
Echoes. It combines the dread of Blair, a creepy closed-in feel thanks
to cinematographer Fred Murphy and great performances by the whole cast,
specifically Bacon, to give the fall its first genuine scary film. If
only they had let up on the unneeded funny bits and tweaked the plot a
bit more, this could have been one of the year's best.

"If you liked _The_Sixth_Sense_, then you'll love _Stir_of_Echoes_." 
I'm actually a bit surprised that Artisan Entertainment isn't going that
cornball route with their film's publicity, for David Koepp's adaptation
of the Richard Matheson novel shares a remarkable amount in common with
the surprise box office phenomenon of the summer.  Unfortunately, one of
those common traits is falling short of complete success.
For all their similarities, _Stir_of_Echoes_ is a completely different
animal from M. Night Shyamalan's film, especially in terms of style. 
Koepp approaches his material in a much more conventional fashion than
Shyamalan, a fact that can best be summed up by a simple comparison.  In
_The_Sixth_Sense_, the now-famous "I see dead people" is spoken roughly
an hour into the film.  In _Stir_of_Echoes_, the psychically gifted
child, Jake Witzky (Zachary David Cope), asks "Does it hurt to be dead?"
to an invisible (but not to him) apparition at about the five-minute
mark.
This sixth sense also comes to be possessed by Jake's father Tom (Kevin
Bacon) after he is put under hypnosis by his sister-in-law Lisa (Illeana
Douglas).  What is meant as a harmless lark during a party turns natural
skeptic Tom into a true believer, for he soon has haunting visions of a
mysterious stranger lurking about his house--apparently the same
heretofore invisible one with whom his son has been regularly conversing.
The reasons for the ghostly stranger's visits recall similar points in
_The_Sixth_Sense_, and that's about where the similarities end.  There is
a more menacing edge here that was fairly absent in that film.  A point
that comes into play in _Stir_of_Echoes is how ghosts get angry when not
paid attention to, resulting in some effective scare scenes where Tom and
his family are actually threatened.  The darker shades are reinforced by
Koepp, who employs an effectively flashy visual style that lends an
eeriness to even the more sedate sequences, such as the clever staging of
Tom's hypnosis experience.
The absorbing style and urgent pace of _Stir_of_Echoes_ kept me
interested as it progressed, as opposed to the glacial crawl of
_The_Sixth_Sense_.  In the end, though, my reaction to _Echoes_ was the
inverse of mine to _Sense_: where the latter's much-talked-about ending
nearly redeemed the entire slow-going film for me, the dismayingly
conventional conclusion to _Echoes_ left me soured on the picture.  It's
a contrived standoff/hostage setup that belongs in much lesser film, and
needless to say it completely kills the otherworldly atmosphere that
Koepp had meticulously created.  Never have I seen reality come crashing
down in a film in a more literal--and disappointing--way.
For all its fantastic elements, Rupert Wainwright's supernatural
thriller _Stigmata_ will hold a grounding in reality for a lot of viewers
due to its religious themes.  Any film that deals with religious issues
inevitably comes under fire (witness the storm surrounding Kevin Smith's
forthcoming _Dogma_), and _Stigmata_, which touches upon a fictional
conspiracy within the Vatican, has already been denounced by the Catholic
League.  However, I think the film provides something
valuable--surprisingly serious and intelligent food for thought about
faith and supernatural phenomena.
While the film deals with serious themes, _Stigmata_ is foremost a
thriller, and Wainwright delivers the requisite shocks in telling the
story of Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette), an unreligious young
Pittsburgh woman who becomes violently afflicted with the wounds of
Christ on the cross, or stigmata.  Wainwright--perhaps not an obvious
choice for a thriller, given that his last credit was for directing
_Blank_Check_, a Disney vehicle for former _Family_Ties_ moppet Brian
Bonsall--stages these bloody scenes in quick-cut MTV style (not
surprising, since he's also a veteran of music videos), and the usually
annoying effect of such a style works quite well in this context,
succeeding in jolting the audience.
Naturally, a priest enters the scene--Father Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel
Byrne), a onetime scientist who now serves as an investigator for the
Vatican.  In dealing with Frankie, Father Andrew must come to terms with
his own doubts about his faith.  Sounds very much like _The_Exorcist_,
and much of _Stigmata_, including some of the special effects scenes,
recall that classic.  Also like that film, _Stigmata_'s effects are
lavish without feeling particularly exploitative.  However derivative
some individual aspects are, the fresh ideas of Wainwright and writers
Tom Lazarus and Rick Ramage, along with the believable performances of
the cast, give _Stigmata_ its own identity.
Not all of the ideas work, however.  Wainwright's visual style careens
into overkill during the quieter scenes; there are one too many shots of
drops of blood falling into water, not to mention some unnecessarily
emblematic closeups of menial things, such as coffee being poured into a
cup.  He also overuses a device that repeats dialogue spoken in a scene
as a voiceover on the following scene.  The virtual absence of any police
hasn't stopped Lazarus and Ramage from indulging in the reliable cop
cliché where an officer is taken off the case by a superior (in this
instance, Father Andrew by Cardinal Daniel Houseman, played by Jonathan
Pryce).
Even so, _Stigmata_ leaves the audience with more to chew on afterward
that any of the other thrillers currently crowding theatres--including
_The_Sixth_Sense_.  While that film makes one think about things you've
seen during the course of its progression, _Stigmata_ makes one reflect
upon one's personal beliefs and values--and therein lies all the
difference.

rated R
Artisan Entertainment
99 minutes
starring Kevin Bacon, Kathryn Erbe, Ileana Douglas, Liza Weil, Kevin
Dunn, Conor O'Farrell, Jenny Morrison, Zachary David Cope
based on the novel "A Stir Of Echoes" by Richard Matheson
written and directed by David Koepp
"The Sixth Sense" is still racking up the dough at the box office, and
already we have a cheap rip off of it. However, David Koepp's "Stir Of
Echoes" doesn't fail merely because of its $250 million shadow. "Stir
Of Echoes" fails because it's a poor effort by everyone involved.
Well, David Koepp has scripted some of the major blockbusters of all
time ("Jurassic Park", "Men In Black") and from what I've heard, his
directorial debut, "The Trigger Effect", was a fine, if underrated,
film. But "Stir Of Echoes", adapted from the cult classic novel by
Richard Matheson, takes none of the risks that the overrated "Sixth
Sense" does.
Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon) is an "ordinary" construction worker in
Chicago who writes music in his spare time. He has a fine relationship
with his wife, Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) and his quiet son Jake (Zachary
David Cope). But one night, his sister in law (Ileana Douglas), an
amateur hypnotist, hypnotizes him at his request. The hypnosis sends
him on a downward spiral, and she opens up parts of his mind that were
closed before.
Tom starts to see things; quick flashes of dead bodies, fingers
falling off, and other stuff like that. His son calmly assures him
that everything will be alright, and it is then that Tom realizes that
Jake sees these things, and he speaks with them too. What are these
things? Dead people, of course. Little boys in movies never "see dead
people", right? Uh-huh.
Coincidentally, it turns out that these dead people are merely trying
to communicate something to someone in the real world. Tom and Jake's
"mission" is to help a dead girl named Samantha (Jenny Morrison) get
in touch with her family (her sister is played by Liza Weil, the
amazing young actress from "Whatever") so that they can figure out why
she has been "missing" for the past few months.
At the start, the setup isn't that bad, but then, the filmmakers
decide to have the film self destruct in five seconds. And self
destruct it does. "Stir Of Echoes" turns from promising thriller to B
horror movie pulp. Kevin Bacon's Tom becomes some sort of a madman and
the film spins wildly out of control.
"Stir Of Echoes" may look and sound like "The Sixth Sense", but it
feels like a spoof. Kevin Bacon is gritty and tough as nails, but he
just doesn't cut it as a leading man. I hate to bash child actors, but
Zachary David Cope has none of Haley Joel ("Sixth Sense") Osment's
guts, and neither does the film itself.
I know it's unfair to compare the two films, since "Stir Of Echoes"
was probably made before "Sixth Sense", but when you see movies with
such similar plotlines, it's hard to resist. "Stir Of Echoes" is
watchable most of the time, but David Koepp seems to have learned a
little too much from the disaster movies he's used to writing. He
directs this low budget film as if it's an action extravaganza,
especially during the wildly preposterous ending.
While "Sixth Sense" at least made its conflict believable, "Stir Of
Echoes" just seems to be along for the ride. Instead of being scary,
it's just downright disturbing. Towards the end, the film becomes
laughably bad, which is fun in an "Evil Dead" kind of way, but when
Kevin Bacon and his son start digging in their backyard because a
movie screen told him to, I have to draw the line. I'm giving "Stir Of
Echoes" an undeserving two stars, but only because I may have enjoyed
it more had I seen it a couple months ago. How sad.

CrankyCriticŽ  movie reviews: Stir of Echoes
Rated [R], 107 minutes
Starring Kevin Bacon, Kathryn Erbe, Illeana Douglas, Kevin Dunn, Zachary
David Cope
Based on the novel by Richard Matheson
Written and Directed by David Koepp
website:http://www.stirofechoes.com
There's a big difference between knowing the "how" of a situation and
the "why," which is the case in Stir of Echoes, which begins as somewhat
of a ghost story and wraps as a murder mystery. As with an unrelated
earlier flick of this past summer, once again there is a kidlet who
talks to ghosts. A more intriguing bit of background about the boy's
talents seems to have been left in the original novel by Richard
Matheson. It's hinted at in writer/director David Koepp's screenplay,
but those hints are left tantalizingly dangling and, as always, we don't
compare to the Source Material. But we're pretty well intrigued . . .
Stir of Echoes drops us smack in the middle of a nice, law abiding blue
collar Chicago neighborhood. It is the story of PhoneCo. lineman Tom
Witsky (Kevin Bacon), his wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) and 7 year old son,
Jake (Zachary David Cope). Also in the picture is Maggie's sister Lisa
(Illeana Douglas), whom Tom, to put it kindly, tolerates. One night at a
party, Tom allows Lisa to hypnotize him knowing that he'll probably be
made to prance around like a chicken. That may have been the case but,
when all is done, Tom comes away a different person. He is tormented at
random by dreadful and horrible images -- there's no slice n dice in
this flick but a pair of gruesome fast cuts will make you reel in shock
-- and becomes prescient, sensing things as they are happening or are
about to happen. While these blasts of images seem to foretell the
future, they don't provide enough information to clue him in on what he
can do about it. Net result? Tom goes, to all intents and appearances,
crackers.
They should have seen it coming -- it runs in the family.
The grownups thought kidlet Jake had an "imaginary" friend named
Samantha. But she passes information to Jake that no one could know.
That leads to some very hairy moments when it turns out that Samantha
was real, a neighborhood kid who disappeared some months before. Jake's
got some other abilities, too. He seems to be "connected," seemingly at
random, to strangers. He is on a first name basis with people he has
never met and one of them, one of Chicago's finest, clues Maggie in to
an entire world of "openers," people with connections to the "other
side". Jake is one. So, now, is Tom. And damn if Cranky didn't want to
know more about this aspect of the story, but that is not to be.
The main story of this movie is the total crackup of this lineman for
the county and his link to the girl who disappeared months before. How
it affects his life and threatens his family. David Koepp's script
dangles enough clues in front of you that, with minor effort, you'll see
most of the solution to the mystery coming a ways off. As I wrote
earlier, knowing the how doesn't mean you'll know the why. Stir of
Echoes has enough depth that you'll still be interested in discovering
the details that you haven't copped to earlier. Kevin Bacon's Tom cracks
up beautifully, but Cranky found himself aware that there was just too
much of it, almost as if the story stopped so we could watch the actor
act. Luckily, Kathryn Erbe's Maggie keeps everything on an even keel as
we watch how her loving wife deals with the collapse of everything she's
known.
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Stir of Echoes, he would have
paid...
A little less than dateflick level. Overall, Cranky liked Stir of
Echoes, enough to reco a theater ticket though you won't feel cheated if
you wait for pay per view.

Bad things happen in big cities. So many films have been telling us this in the
past year, and for the Witzky family, there's no exception. While drunk at a
neighborhood party Tom Witzky (Bacon) dares his sister Lisa (Douglas) to
hypnotize him, thinking that all hypnotism is a hoax. He learns that it is very
real. After waking up from his trance, Lisa refers to him as one of the, "Lucky
8%" the people who can really be intensely under a spell. After the party
things begin to happen. Tom begins receiving sudden flashes of images that he
can make no sense of. The one he's the most obsessive about is a pale teenage
girl who he thought he saw sitting on his couch. Even worse, Tom's son Jake has
been talking to an invisible girl he calls Samantha, it appears the two of them
are thinking and conversing with the same person. And while it at party, Tom
learns that Lisa said he needed to be more open-minded. Who knows what that
could have done?
More images come, and the more that appear, the more Tom is compelled to find
an answer to them. His search for answers includes digging up his entire
backyard, jackhammering his entire basement, and creating a large hole in the
house's beautiful wood floor. All of this horrifies his wife Maggie (Erbe), who
isn't sure how much more of this she can take.
This is a thriller that effectively stirs up some suspense, while many scenes
in the film are more than slightly outrageous, the sudden flash of images is
fun and exciting and keeps the moviegoer guessing. It stays that way for a
while, until the movie reaches it's conclusion, and wraps itself up so neat and
tidy that nothing is left unexplained or to the imagination, one of the keys to
a great thriller. Acting is surprisingly first rate with Kevin Bacon, Kathryn
Erbe, and young Zachary David Cope giving above average performances. The only
real thing that bugged me about the picture was that Maggie stayed with her
husband for almost the entire time. Nothing entirely plausible happens, yet she
seems to take it all in without too much of a panic. The soundtrack is also
notable and sets some of the gritty tone for the film. Finally a movie that
gets close to the amount of thrills it wants to achieve. Not many echoes
stirring here, but there's a whole lot of mystery, a whole lot of confusion,
and a whole lot of fun.

STIR OF ECHOES (M).  
(Twentieth Century Fox)
Director: David Koepp
Stars: Kevin Bacon, Kathryn Erbe, Illeana Douglas, Kevin Dunn, Zachary
David Cope, Jenny Morrison, Liza Weil, Chalon Williams
Running time: 99 minutes.
What have we here?  A cute young kid who can see dead people
and talk to ghosts?  But before you can scoff: "Shades of The Sixth
Sense", Stir Of Echoes pushes in another direction altogether.
Writer/director David Koepp, best known for his collaborations with
Brian De Palma (Mission Impossible and Snake Eyes, etc) and
screenplays for films like Jurassic Park, etc, turns this potentially
familiar and derivative material into an unnerving thriller about
murder and obsession.  Tom (Kevin Bacon) and his wife Maggie (Kathryn
Erbe, from Dream With The Fishes, etc) are a happy working class
couple who live in a nice neighbourhood in Chicago with their six year
old son Jake (newcomer Zachary David Cope), who seems to be sensitive
to the disturbing undercurrents of their house.  They are unaware that
Jake sees and talks to a ghostly girl who mysteriously appears in
their house.
Then, during a party, the sceptical Tom is hypnotised by his
sister-in-law Lisa (Illeana Douglas, playing yet another of those
marginal kooks that she does so well).  Unfortunately, Tom is left
with disturbing visions as a result of that experience, and becomes
obsessed with images of a young girl who apparently disappeared six
months earlier.  Lisa seems unable to reverse the effects of her
hypnotism.  Tom's behaviour becomes more erratic and driven, which
disturbs Maggie.
Rational explanations for Tom's post-hypnotic behaviour are a
little thin on the ground, which adds to the intense and chilling
development of suspense, but does little for the movie's credibility.
There is no real sense of mystery either, as more astute members of
the audience should probably be able to pick whodunit and what they
did well before the surprising revelations.
That Stir Of Echoes works so well and gradually draws the
audience into its web of suspense and unease is due largely to Koepp's
atmospheric direction.  Bacon's intense and volatile performance as
the single-minded and inexplicably driven Tom also suitably builds up
the air of uneasiness.  However, in an important role as the sensitive
kid, young Cope does not possess half the charisma or natural charm
and maturity that Haley Joel Osment brought to his similar role in The
Sixth Sense.  Inevitably, Stir Of Echoes will be, fairly or unfairly,
compared with the vastly superior The Sixth Sense, although this film
was made first.  Unlike that film though, this one doesn't have that
killer kick in the tail to make it memorable.

STIR OF ECHOES (director/writer: David Koepp; screenwriter: based on the
1958 novel by Richard Matheson; cinematographer: Fred Murphy; cast:
Zachary David Cope (Jake), Kevin Bacon (Tom), Kathryn Erbe (Maggie),
Illeana Douglas (Lisa), Kevin Dunn (Frank), Conor O'Farrell (Harry),
Liza Weil (Debbie), Eddie Bo Smith Jr. (Neil, Chicago cop), Jenny
Morrison (Samantha), 1999)
Stir of Echoes is firstly a ghost story and then it's a murder story,
taking place in a working class Chicago neighborhood, where the
neighbors party together and seem to be close-knit and concerned about
one another. In either case, writer/director David Koepp (writer of
Snake Eyes, The Lost World and director of The Trigger Effect) has come
up with an emotionally disturbing film.
Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon) is a telephone lineman and as a hobby plays
guitar for a rock band. He is down on himself for his life being so
ordinary, yet he tells his expectant wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) that he
is a happy man because he has her. One of their problems, is that their
5- year- old son Jake (Zachary David Cope) sees ghosts and carries out
conversations with them in a most peculiar fashion. He asks a
ghost,"Does it hurt to be dead?" If I were his dad I would have gotten
the kid some professional help before I attended another neighborhood
get together.
But this ghost story is about the ordeal of the most unlikely believer
in such supernatural tales, the hard-hat father of Jake, the one who has
always repressed his extra-ordinary visionary gift. Therefore the film
chooses not to focus too much on the precocious kid's gift, going almost
exclusively for his father's nightmarish visions to tell its tale.
Tom's common man persona will quickly change during one of those
gatherings, when his sister-in-law Lisa (Illeana Douglas), her sardonic
humor much appreciated by me, talks about hypnosis and the drunken and
skeptical Tom challenges the very amateur hypnotist to put him under. As
a result, the lesson being becomes: never play mind games you don't
understand with someone inexperienced and not completely reliable who
has you under their power. As it turns out, our man is a Receiver (which
in the supernatural trade, means that he has the gift, he could see
things in the other world). Tom is told to think of an empty theater,
with that in mind visions come to him very violently of some ill-doings
in the house he is renting, giving him the impression someone's buried
there. When out of the trance, he says he felt no pain and is surprised
when told he had a pin stuck in him. He remembers nothing of his visions
but still has x-ray vision and severe headaches and a foreboding fear
that he better do something about these visions or else his family will
be in danger. The next day when he turns to ask the kooky Lisa what she
did to him, she tells him she only suggested to him that he keep the
door open, to have an open mind.
He starts calling in sick to work, and his worried wife thinks he's
cracking-up. And even after he tells her what's going on inside his
head, she doesn't get it that this could be something requiring
professional help; she seems to be more concerned that he's used up all
his sick days. But the kid understands his father, they are now both on
the same wavelength and hold frequent chats together in private, afraid
that what they are talking about would scare mommy.
Tom is now obsessed with the vision of a ghost in the house, which he
soon identifies as a missing neighborhood teenager, Samantha Kozac
(Jenny). She is mentally retarded and the sister of Debbie (Liza Weil),
who babysits for Jake for only the first time at the suggestion of Jake.
Debbie's presence gets the ghost story really rolling, as Jake blurts
out to her his visions of Samantha being in the house. Though, at times,
the story is close to losing it, getting enveloped in melodramatics, it
manages to pull back and return to the family and their struggle with
the existence of a ghost in their house and their marital problems,
keeping the film suspenseful, allowing you to overlook if you care to,
the many holes in the story. It isn't until the climax that the film
really falls apart and reverts to a conventional ending, as it tries to
do justice to the murdered ghost. The film just lost control of what it
had going for it that made it different from, let's say, another recent
ghost film, The Sixth Sense, and plummeted it back into the world of the
run-of-the mill films of that genre.
When both father and son share ghostly visions of Samantha and the film
moves into the afterworld to tell its chilling story, the tale is
compelling. It is illustriously shot and its ghostly visions are
stunningly creepy. It also captures in its sights the good, bad, and
ugly of Chicago. This fast moving film has hooked onto the nuances of
its working class neighborhood completely, and by being grounded with
this kind of reality the ghost story becomes more effective.
>From this character driven film, we learn that ghosts get angry when we
don't respond to them properly. That the afterworld is a place that some
of us more than others have a chance to penetrate and if we do, we
better learn how to listen. Kevin Bacon plays the role convincingly,
with just the right amount of skepticism and psychological tension,
coming close but never going over the top, like a lesser actor might
have been tempted to do. Kathryn Erbe is solid in her role as the loving
wife who doesn't see what the rest of her family sees supernaturally but
in her own brave way tries to manage to keep the family together.
Zachary David Cope seems like a child who is used to seeing strange
things all his life and is rather placid and accepting about it, playing
his role as well as could be expected. But I did have some problems that
what was happening to him was not more fully developed. I felt I didn't
really know much more about him by the film's end than from its
beginning. In both sequences ghosts are communicating with him. I just
had the feeling that the kid could end up being a basket case if his
folks didn't take some time to help him deal with his gift, and that
even though they were hard working and nice people, they were not a very
perceptive couple.
What transpires is an ok ghost story, a suspenseful story of an ordinary
couple trying to cope with something that they are not prepared for, and
a weak murder story, that ruins the film, as it brings it down to earth
in a most desultory manner.
Is the film worth seeing? Yes. It is entertaining and spooky, and you
get taken on an emotional roller coaster ride. No. It is earthbound and
contrived, and the ending is a stinker. Take your pick, both answers are
correct.

The release of Stir of Echoes is a stroke of good luck. Audiences have
been widely flocking to the supernatural thriller The Sixth Sense, which
is essentially a ghost story with a unique twist. Perhaps they're in the
mood for another offering from beyond the grave. If this is the case,
Stir of Echoes is just the film everyone is looking for - it's a
masterful creation brimming with moments that succeed in causing
goosebumps. Even if The Sixth Sense continues to conquer the box office,
this second offering still manages to hook you from minute one and never
lose it's grip on suspense.
Kevin Bacon (after baring all in Wild Things) plays Tom Witzky, a
telephone lineman who lives a settled life with his wife Maggie (Kathryn
Erbe) and son Jake (Zachary David Cope). One night, during a
neighborhood keg party, Maggie's sister Lisa (Illeana Douglas) describes
to the group the magical art of hypnosis. Tom (who is drunk at the
time), encourages Lisa to hypnotize him for the group's entertainment.
The method in which writer/director David Keopp (Jurassic Park) presents
the scene is both intriguing and expertly executed; a model for other
films to follow.
After the hypnotism, Tom begins to see frightening images in his mind.
These all seem to be centered around the spirit of a young girl, who
appears in front of eyes in the most surprising places. Tom thinks he is
losing his mind, but he turns to his little boy for an interesting
discovery: Jake has the ability to see the ghost as well. Tom realizes
that he is chosen for something important. What this is, he doesn't
exactly know.
As a ghost story, Stir of Echoes is both frightening and refreshing.
Keopp has balanced the familiar elements well, finishing with a product
that glues the attentive viewer to their seat for the entire running
time. The mood is established early, and the sheer professionalism never
drops even a smidgen. Everything involving the set-up of the film is
masterful: swooping and winding camera angles that recall Stanley
Kubrick's best work, believable performances in the key roles of Tom and
Maggie, and some genuinely effective atmosphere that builds efficiently
for a few great scares. Adapting from Richard Matheson's novel, Keopp's
material isn't always on target, but his technical presentation is
absolutely perfect.
In the lead role, Bacon delivers a very solid performance. His character
is easier to relate to than most, and because of this, we accept his
unusual situation with ease. In supporting roles, Illeana Douglas and
Kevin Dunn are both immensely reliable, as is the talented Erbe and
young Cope. Stir of Echoes marks the second good performance from a
child actor in the past month - although Haley Joel Osment's in The
Sixth Sense is more than just 組ood', it's deserving of award
recognition. While first I must cross my fingers that Haley gets a
nomination at Oscar time, I've got to commend Cope's wonderful
presentation also.
I mentioned earlier that the set-up of Stir of Echoes is impeccable. The
second half, I'm afraid, isn't quite as good. Keopp begins to lean
toward more conventional thinking, and the momentum begins to fade
slightly. Still, you've got to hand it to him. Where the director shows
a weakness in one area, he compensates for it in another. His screenplay
is always well-written, and although some audience members may predict
the ending before it eventually rolls around, Keopp's marvelous
direction always has us strapped in.
Not only is this an intellectually superior thriller, but everything
about it is distinctly eye-catching. The use of the colors red and white
is effective (particularly the first, used during a lot in instant
flashes). As we are taken along Tom's bizarre breakdown, the surprises
are clever and consistent. The film has a brain, and uses it well,
making for a unique and frightening experience at the cinema.

In summary, this film can be outlined in a single sentence, which should be 
enough to trigger the warning SPOILER AHEAD in most people's minds.  I won't 
divulge its premise here if you've managed to avoid it thus far, but I will 
say this: for a basic story, STIR OF ECHOES does a pretty good job of 
looking like unfamiliar territory.
There's also a hint of the familiar involved as well, which is why I like 
this film: it constantly refers to its title.  Kevin Bacon is a 
self-confessed 'ordinary' working stiff who is put under hypnosis as part of 
a parlor trick and then finds himself haunted by hallucinations.  
Writer-director David Koepp puts his own spin on Richard Matheson's novel, 
revealing new characters and snippets of information in an effectively 
serpentine manner.  Bacon's visions are somehow connected to real events 
either happening in the past, the future, or the very present.  Sometimes 
they are unsettling flashforwards into his own life, other times unfocused 
scenes from places and people unknown to him (the film's one irony is that 
Bacon's occupation as a lineman requires him to 'make connections' and 
maintain lines of communication).  It's all very intriguing, but Koepp, more 
experienced as a writer than a director, makes a conscious choice not to 
sustain it.  Aware that there is only so much mystery an audience can take, 
he turns the second half of the story into a sort of practical reaction to 
the first.  By this point Koepp has been generous enough with his choice of 
visions to enable us to piece together the underlying story and even the 
pattern of events likely to follow.  In what amounts to a cleverly subtle 
crossover the audience is unwittingly placed into the protagonist's shoes, 
having the required amount of prescience to predict key images and scenes of 
its own.  And we have been very neatly prepped for this by the hypnosis 
scene, during which Bacon is told to imagine he is sitting in a darkened 
movie theatre (of course the screen turns black at this point, and it 
becomes *us* in that subjective chair), just one of many moments in the 
movie, creepy, funny, or just nifty, that may manage a smirk of delight from 
you.
It's what is operating below the surface that gives STIR OF ECHOES edginess. 
  Ask yourself why you feel this film seems to keep pushing itself anxiously 
forward and you might notice the restless backdrop surrounding its 
characters.  There is a sense of great masses of people journeying and 
relocating themselves, as if the voices of the unconscious are forever 
pressing around us.  The crossover/connection/journey motif is emphasized by 
background traffic noise, trains roaring by and passenger jets flying 
overhead; a line of stalled cars causes a precognition from Bacon which in 
turn leads to a crowded bus station; and even at the film's end, when all 
seems resolved, the last word we see drawn to the camera is 'Moving'.  
Significantly, the final frames linger on reflections from the windows of a 
moving car, the soundtrack implying that this particular journey is far from 
over.
STIR OF ECHOES has drawn much comparison with THE SIXTH SENSE, but only 
because of its timing.  The more obvious match, if you have to make one, is 
THE SHINING.  Here too we have a boy connected to the spirit world by an 
invisible friend; fleeting visions of the past and future; a family/marriage 
under stress; a father who shares a diluted version of his young son's 
telepathic powers; an older black man who recognizes these powers on sight; 
a father becoming unhinged (when he snaps at his wife in the back yard, 
Bacon seems a lot like Jack Nicholson - otherwise his performance is 
completely his own, and a finely-tuned one at that) and a bewildered 
wife/mother armed with a knife.  The last scene of the film needs only an 
intermission to separate it from the opening shots of THE SHINING, which 
could be a logical extension and conclusion to the fledging powers at work 
in this story.  The echoes continue to reverberate.  In-joke: the family's 
babysitter reads a Matheson novel, 'The Shrinking Man'.  I read 'A Stir of 
Echoes' several years ago, and have forgotten much of it except for some 
detail about a woman in a yellow raincoat.perhaps those echoes of long ago 
make me an ideal viewer for this film.  I even owned the exact same 
paperback as the babysitter.  I'm sitting in a darkened movie theater.I am 
getting sleepy.

It is astonishing that major motion picture studios often release movies
with similar plots within weeks of each other.  Last year there was Deep
Impact and Armageddon.  So, there is no question that Stir of Echoes will
be compared to the summer's surprise hit, Sixth Sense.  Both have similar
storylines involving children who see ghosts.  In Stir of Echoes the child
is Jake Witzky, played quite well by Zachary David Cope.  He is the only
one of the family who is aware of the presence of a young female ghost who
resides in the house with them, that is, until one night when his father,
Tom, (Bacon) is hypnotized at a party by Lisa (Douglas).    Her
post-hypnotic suggestion gives Tom powers to see and hear unusual glimpses
of things that surround him.  But he can't seem to figure out what is
happening.  And, his wife, Maggie, (Erbe) certainly isn't very
understanding.  Even at a cemetery, when she starts to notice that her son
has some weird abilities, she refuses to accept them.   
When Jake reminds his mother to take her purse with her, you remember
that she has a knife in it, and surely she will use it.  She does. The
major problem here is that we are aware what's happening before the cast
is.
Oh, yes, there is a mystery here.  Who is the ghost?  Why is she there? 
Well, it doesn't take long to know who she is and she's there because
she's probably been murdered.  But who did it?   There are some scary
moments and if that's what you like, you'll be entertained.  As for the
acting, Kevin Bacon's portrayal is uneven to say the least.  But now we
have another group of actors who can be included in `Six Degrees of Kevin
Bacon'.    
It's not a movie for young children to watch, but most teens will like
it. As for me, I might watch this again when it comes to free TV.  I give
it a C.

If there's one thing that will always confuse me, it's the timing that film
companies possess. I'm curious as to what inspires these people to release
movies at the same time similar movies have been released by different
companies. It happened in '98 with "Armageddon" and "Deep Impact"competing, and
then, only months later, "Antz" and "A Bug's Life" went at it. Why Artisan
chose to release "Stir of Echoes" right after "The 6th Sense" will forever be
beyond my comprehension.
Tom Witzky is a Blue-collar worker in Chicago. He has a loving wife and a son
who (we learn right away) can see and speaks to ghosts. One night, at a party,
he talks his hippy sister in law, Lisa, to hypnotize him. In doing so, she
unknowingly grants him abilities similar (though not as useful) to his son's.
Soon, he becomes obsessed with finding out what the sudden, bizarre images he
receives mean. He puts the rest of his life on hold, and begins acting in very
erratic ways. This slowly begins to alienate his wife and friends, but he
doesn't care. The mystery is all that matters to him now.
I don't want to reveal to much more about the plot, because it is revealed in
mystery format. In fact, this is the film's greatest problem. Whereas it starts
with horror film like images and ideas, it rather suddenly turns into a very
obvious murder mystery. So obvious, that the entire audience will most likely
know the answer to the mystery about half way through the film.
However, let me point out that there are, in fact, some great aspects to this
film. Kevin Bacon turns in a great performance as a man who suddenly possesses
a "gift" he doesn't understand. There are some truly creepy scenes in the film,
such as when his son is suddenly and very briefly channeling another voice, and
a scene in which his wife prepares to take a bath but isn't alone. There is
also a wonderful soundtrack which is a nice blend of more modern music, and
purely instrumental.
Other than Kevin Bacon, the other actors are uniformly okay, with only Illeana
Douglas adding something more to her performance. Zachary Cope gives a decent
offering as Tom's son, but he's simply outshone by Haley Joel Osment's turn in
"The 6th Sense". The number one flaw is the movie's rather idiotic mystery, as
I've already pointed out, but another large problem is the addition of
characters who are given nothing to do. For example, Officer Neil (Edddie Bo
Smith Jr.) appears to be a man who possesses the same abilities as Tom and
Jake, but he isn't in the movie for more than six or seven minutes.
Overall, "Stir of Echoes" could have been a much more interesting movie if only
it had been released at a time when the far superior "The 6th Sense" wasn't
still fresh in our minds. I do give it three stars and a  marginal
reccomendation, but wait for video.
* * * * * - One of the greatest movies ever made, see it now.
* * * * - Great flick. Try and catch this one.
* * * - Okay movie, hits and misses.
* * - Pretty bad. See it if you've got nothing better to do.

If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then THE SIXTH SENSE,
the surprise hit of the summer, should feel honored by STIR OF ECHOES
since the stories are like fraternal twins.  Both have frightening,
horror picture elements and both feature a young boy who communicates
with dead people.
The trouble lies in their differences.
STIR OF ECHOES, which by comparison might more aptly be titled NO SENSE,
insults the viewers' intelligence at every turn.  Writer and director
David Koepp falls back on every cliché in the book to advance the
storyline.  The overly serious movie will likely have you laughing out
loud at some of the film's ridiculously implausible and downright silly
parts.
In contrast to Haley Joel Osment's brilliant performance as the boy in
THE SIXTH SENSE, Zachary David Cope gives a loquacious but emotionless
performance as Jake Witzky, a 5-year-old "receiver."  Dead people speak
and he receives, you see, not that his parents pay attention to him when
he's yammering away with his companions from the spirit world.
With the top billing and the most screen time, a grizzled Kevin Bacon
plays Jake's father, Tom, a blue-collar worker who lives in "the nicest
neighborhood in Chicago."  (As soon as you hear this phrase repeated,
you know, of course, that the place will be filled with neighbors that
will prove not quite so wonderful after all.)
After his sister-in-law (Illeana Douglas) hypnotizes Tom, he
accidentally becomes a receiver too, causing him much mental anguish.
Popping pills like candy, he runs around like a wild man who suffers
from killer migraines.  It's an embarrassingly bad, over-the-top
performance for an actor as good as Bacon.
There's even the equivalent of a Receiver's Anonymous meeting to which
Tom is invited.  Too bad he doesn't go; it could have supplied some
much-needed levity.
"Come on, what's the worst that can happen?" Tom asks rhetorically,
egging on his sister-in-law when he wants her to hypnotize him.  A lot
it turns out.  In an attempt to gross out the audience, Tom pulls out
his own front tooth, causing a small river of blood - all this because
he begins to do a mind meld with the ghost who has come calling.
When Tom has sex with his wife, he has visions of another woman but a
dead one.  The movie's best line mixes Tom's notorious wandering eye
with his current predicament.  "I'm not shocked there's another woman,"
his sister-in-law tells his wife.  "That she's dead gives one pause."
"What exactly don't you understand?" an agitated Tom asks his wife, who
never seems to get it.  For viewers the list of things they don't
understand would be long.  At the top of such list of conundrums might
be why he would choose to fill his refrigerator completely full of
nothing but dozens of large containers of orange juice?
STIR OF ECHOES desperately tries to ride on THE SIXTH SENSE's coattails.
Even if it's not quite as bad as THE HAUNTING, which established the low
point for this year's horror flicks, STIR OF ECHOES would be better
saved for video, when you can keep your finger on the fast-forward
button in order to skip the more preposterous incidents.  Actually,
skipping it all would be a better strategy entirely.
STIR OF ECHOES runs 1:40.  It is rated R for violence, sexuality and
language and would be acceptable for most teenagers.

Directed by David Koepp.
Cast: Kevin Bacon, Kathryn Erbe, Zachary David Cope, Illeana Douglas, Jenny 
Morrison, Kevin Dunn, Liza Weil.
1999 - 99 minutes
Rated R (for violence, profanity, sex, and an attempted rape).
Reviewed September 11, 1999.
It's terribly unfortunate that "Stir of Echoes," tautly written and directed 
by David Koepp (who made one of 1996's unsung treasures, "The Trigger 
Effect"), should be released little more than a month after "The Sixth 
Sense," which is still going strong at the box office. These two films are 
undoubtedly going to be compared (judging from practically all of my fellow 
audience members last night), and although they have eerily similar 
storylines, "Stir of Echoes" is more of a straightforward psychological 
horror film, while "The Sixth Sense" is closer to a psychological drama. 
Additionally, while "The Sixth Sense" had a shocker of an ending that 
undoubtedly has been one of the major factors in its recent repeat business, 
"Stir of Echoes" is more conventional and predictable in its final twist. And 
where "The Sixth Sense" was disturbing, "Stir of Echoes" is just plain scary. 
I have a feeling most viewers are going to come away unimpressed because of 
the unavoidable similarities, and will foolishly forget to judge this film on 
its own respectable merits.
Adapted from a novel by Richard Matheson that was written some forty years 
ago, "Stir of Echoes" opens with a cute six-year-old boy named Jake (Zachary 
David Cope) who is taking a bath. He is speaking directly at the screen, but 
we immediately have a feeling someone else is there. Finally, he asks, "Does 
it hurt to be dead?" Apparently Jake sees the ghosts of dead people, but 
unlike "The Sixth Sense," this young child isn't the focus of the picture. 
Instead, Tom Witzy (Kevin Bacon), a Chicago lineman, is our protagonist. Jake 
is his son, and Maggie (Kathryn Erbe), whom has just discovered she is six 
weeks pregnant, is his hard-working wife. One night while at a party with 
their closest friends, Tom convinces Maggie's New-Age sister, Lisa (Illena 
Douglas), to try and hypnotize him. It unexpectedly works, and before long, 
Tom is seeing things he wouldn't normally see, including a deceased teenage 
girl (Jenny Morrison) in his house who happens to have been missing for the 
last six months. Seeking help from Lisa, she tells him that, while he was 
under hypnosis, she told him that after he awoke, his mind will remain clear 
and free, like an opened door. She didn't expect it to work, but it did, and 
the only way to stop it is for Tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he 
sees.
"Stir of Echoes" isn't a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination, but 
in the thick, atmospheric mood it conjures up, it is a terrifically eerie 
domestic horror-drama, and is not only effective on a technical level, but is 
impressive in its portrayal of a struggling working-class family. Kevin Bacon 
and, especially, Kathryn Erbe (1997's "Dream With the Fishes"), are top-notch 
and exceedingly believable as a loving married couple who nonetheless have 
their fair share of problems. After Tom is hypnotized and starts seeing 
ghastly visions, he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this 
mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house, and 
instead of Maggie not being understanding, she instead believes what Tom 
says, and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through, does 
not try to stop his pursuit. Bacon and Erbe are not traditional Hollywood 
stars like Tom Cruise and Julia Roberts, and therefore, are easier to relate 
to and always plausible as a struggling couple who have to work overtime at 
their jobs just to make ends meet.
In a masterfully-done, entrancing sequence, Tom is hypnotized by Lisa, but 
instead of watching him, we instead see what he sees, starting from his view 
as he closes his eyes into darkness. Lisa tells him to visualize being in an 
empty movie theater, and so, we, as audience members, are watching a movie 
screen from inside a theater, which is also showing a movie screen in a 
theater. Telling him to move closer and closer to the screen as a fuzzy word 
in black letters pops up on the screen, we begin to float closer and closer 
to the front of the theater until we see that the word is "sleep." Never 
before have I seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing and brilliantly-construed 
as this one. Truthfully, this set-piece, and another in which Tom wakes up 
from a nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he has 
just dreamt, are worth the full price of admission alone, just to see them on 
the big screen.
Having loads of fun with her small role as Maggie's sister, Lisa, Illeana 
Douglas (1995's "To Die For," her last great character) is a delight, but 
rarely used to her full advantage in feature films. Funny and enjoyably 
offbeat, Douglas gets to utter the best line in the film: While talking to 
Maggie about Tom's visions of the girl, she remarks, "I wouldn't be worried 
about him seeing another girl, although the fact that she's dead gives one 
pause." Also of note are Jenny Morrison (1994's "Intersection"), who is truly 
poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really 
happened to her missing character, and Liza Weil, remarkable in 1998's 
"Whatever," as Morrison's grieving teenage sister, Debbie.
If the resolution of "Stir of Echoes" does not live up to its obviously 
frightful full potential (and it doesn't), what comes before is both 
involving and appropriately gritty. The music score, by James Newton Howard, 
and unsettling use of whispers and ghostly sound effects, successfully 
compliment and foreshadow the off-kilter frame-of-mind that Tom is put into, 
and director David Koepp proves once again that he is a director with a knack 
for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around 
realistically-written characters. "Stir of Echoes" isn't as good as "The 
Sixth Sense," but why should it need to be? Both films are fully capable of 
standing on their own two feet, and "Stir of Echoes" really is a 
spinetinglingly good horror film.

Rated on a 4-star scale
Screening venue: Odeon (Liverpool City Centre)
Released in the UK by Fox on May 26, 2000; certificate 15; 99 minutes; 
country of origin USA; aspect ratio 1.85:1
Directed by David Koepp; produced by Judy Hofflund, Gavin Polone.
Written by David Koepp; based on the novel by Richard Matheson.
Photographed by Fred Murphy; edited by Jill Savitt.
"Stir of Echoes" is one of the year's best films, is based on a best selling 
novel, and features Kevin Bacon in one of his most skilful performances. 
Films of this calibre don't often hit our screens. And yet it has arrived 
with little advance buzz and a cheap publicity campaign. Why? Maybe because 
people are still eating up "The Sixth Sense", the ghost story from last year 
that got six Oscar nominations and topped box office charts. "Stir of Echoes" 
shames that silly con trick, matching its spooky atmosphere in every frame, 
and going much further in developing a story.
Bacon plays Tom Witzky, a blue-collar guy from Chicago who one night jokingly 
dares his kooky sister-in-law Lisa (Ileana Douglas) to hypnotise him. "How 
can you believe in all that superstitious crap?" he asks. When Lisa has him 
under, she leaves him with what's known as a Post-Hypnotic Suggestion, 
leaving a message in his brain. She asks him to be more open-minded.
And that he becomes, but not in the way she intended. After Tom wakes up he 
has disturbing visions and feelings of strange sickness, because he's now a 
'receiver' -- a person able to see everything around him, both material and 
supernatural. His son Jake (Zachary David Cope) has always had the gift, and 
tells his father "Don't be afraid of it, daddy." When Tom calms down, and 
tries to make sense of the phenomena going on around him, he realises he's 
being haunted by the ghost of a dead teenage girl who wants him to unearth 
something related to her memory.
There are a lot of plot threads in "Stir of Echoes", all of which somehow 
become related to this girl. But they don't feel like story manoeuvres, they 
feel like atmosphere, because everything is set up through either realistic 
supporting characters or Tom's visions. Things are glimpsed just enough so we 
can mark and remember them, but not so much that we can figure out what 
everything means or is leading up to. While we're watching the movie, all we 
can focus on is the fact that Tom is going through something weird, and I 
found myself shivering, jumping and glaring in disgusted disbelief, as the 
haunting got more serious, tormenting and dominating Tom's life. We see what 
he sees, and it gets under our skin by coming in violent flashes, through 
bizarre angles, colours and speeds.
Disorientating apparitions alone cannot carry a film. Here they are supported 
by a) cinematography whose dark, shady tones walk the line between realistic 
and spooky, so we can never quite relax; and b) a performance of intensity 
from Bacon. He's not always cast in sombre roles, but he's perfect for them 
-- his good looks and sense of humour can always win audiences over, and his 
strong features and hungry face mean that when his character is taking 
something seriously, we do too. In "Stir of Echoes" he plays a man whose head 
gets torn apart, and we're sure as hell let know it.
It's also good to see a picture like this set in a regular neighbourhood; 
usually in these movies only the affluent get ghouls or spirits coming to 
visit. That's one example of the richness of "Stir of Echoes", which is as 
detailed in texture as a novel, and doesn't contain standard movie clichés 
like Tom taking a long time to realise the obvious, or keeping his 
experiences secret from his wife. Consider also the final shot, which is not 
just a cheap scare, but a remembrance of the implications of the story. I 
haven't read the Richard Matheson source material, and in fact perhaps I 
should stop reading books altogether. After all, most of the literary 
adaptations I have enjoyed this year have been based on things I haven't 
read. Then again, maybe this is just a wonderful movie.

Hmmm...  Another good movie about a kid seeing ghosts, with a screenplay
written by the director.  Must be that Y2K bug...  Whatever the cause,
this trend of films written and directed by the same person seems to be
a bright ray of hope in current the murk of Hollywood.  The singleness
of vision seems to eliminate the repetitive cliches and allow a
genuinely good film to be created.
While I haven't read the 1958 novel by Richard Matheson that director
David Koepp's screenplay is based on, A STIR OF ECHOES feels like the
perfect on-screen representation of a Matheson novel, duplicating both
his strengths and weaknesses -- that is, a very well-executed story with
an overly-simple plotline.  You know what's going on long before the
characters do and are impatiently waiting for them to figure it out,
however, the film is so well-made that you don't mind knowing what's
going to happen and it's a pleasure to watch it play it out.
As far as its supernatural component goes, the movie has great
atmosphere, but is spooky  rather than scary -- like THE SIXTH SENSE,
it's a ghost story, not a horror movie.  The film makes complicated and
interesting use of the audio track to keep you confused and off-balance,
has good gotchas, and uses its CGI in restrained and effective ways.
Note that the baby-sitter is reading Matheson's THE SHRINKING MAN.
A very enjoyable film, with a lot of humor and little surprises.

Kevin Bacon is another one of our most unsung actors in the movies whose talent
is often unspoken of. This man has appeared in "J.F.K," "Sleepers," "A Few Good
Men," and "Apollo 13." He has also had his footing in the sci-fi/horror genre
in films like the original "Friday the 13th," "Flatliners" and "Tremors." It is
nice to see him back in this genre with the fitfully exciting and alternately
disturbing "Stir of Echoes." 
Bacon plays Tom Witzky, a telephone service repairman with a faithful, pregnant
wife (Kathryn Erbe) and a cute son (Zachary David Cope) who talks to himself in
his bedroom and in the bathtub. But who is he talking to? Some unseen force or
spirit, or is it the kids' imagination? Of course, a creepiness sets in when we
see that he is talking to us, and we are the spirits.
One night, Tom goes to a neighborhood keg party and is hypnotized by his
sister-in-law (the quixotically alive Illeana Douglas). Afterwards, he begins
to get headaches, drinks orange juice by the gallon, and feels the need to dig
his backyard searching for something. Tom also sees visions of the ghost of a
missing girl in the neighborhood, and every time he gets close to her, he feels
cold and sees frost in the air (shades of "The Sixth Sense"). Everyone thinks
he is going crazy except for his son who tells him not to be afraid.  
"Stir of Echoes" is great, intriguing entertainment for the first hour. Tom's
visions begin to get more bizarre and violent, and he also foresees the future.
We also see how this affects his wife, their sex life, and his son who seems to
embody other spirits (he is possessed briefly at one point). Unfortunately, as
written by Richard Matheson (based on his 1958 novel) and David Koepp, the
movie gradually stirs itself into a narrow corner. Too many plot threads are
left hanging and we are left with a movie about the spectre of a dead girl who
affects an entire neighborhood.
Once the film examines the mystery of this girl, "Stir of Echoes" never truly
builds on the psychological layers of Tom's character to see how this might
affect him. There is nothing here to suggest the implicit ironies of "The Sixth
Sense" or Roman Polanski's masterpiece, "The Tenant." And the anticlimactic,
mediocre ending lends little in the film's favor. 
There is still a lot to savor in "Stir of Echoes." Kevin Bacon projects anxiety
and fear in a nicely balanced performance - his cocky, tense behavior is
well-modulated but he could have done so much more with an in-depth script.
Illeana Douglas is a sprightly wonder and brings the film alive with her
charisma. A real shame that she is so underused considering she unleashes the
can of visions to Tom in the first place. I also enjoyed Kevin Dunn's brief
role as Tom's sexually lustful friend. 
There are some surprises but not enough to overcome the fact that "Stir of
Echoes" is nothing more than an extended "Twilight Zone" episode. It had more
potential than that, if only writers Matheson and director David Koepp stirred
all the elements to come up with a fruitier mix.

     As I was sitting at the Toronto Film Festival last year waiting
for the screening of APT PUPIL I spoke to the woman next to me who
claimed to really love horror, especially Stephen King.  I asked if she
was also a fan of Richard Matheson.  "Who?"  Richard Matheson is one of
the most important names in American horror fiction, TV, and cinema.
She pulled a copy of Steven King's DANSE MACABRE, a study of American
horror, from a bag she carried and found that yes, there were
references to Richard Matheson.  I should hope so.  Matheson may not
have the name recognition of a King or a Koontz, but he has been behind
everything important in horror and some spilling over into fantasy and
science fiction since the 1950s.  Both King and Koontz freely admit
large debts to Matheson.  Matheson was really the major force to move
the setting of horror stories out of castles in Eastern Europe and into
American suburbia.
     Matheson first got involved with film when his novel THE SHRINKING
MAN was adapted into the film THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN.  Only Rod
Serling provided more stories that were dramatized on THE TWILIGHT
ZONE.  Matheson wrote most of Roger Corman's film adaptations of Poe in
the 60s.  He scripted THE DEVIL RIDES OUT (a.k.a. THE DEVIL'S BRIDE)
one of the best films from Hammer Films. Matheson adapted the novel THE
NIGHT STALKER for TV.  He wrote THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE and SOMEWHERE
IN TIME, based on his own novels.  He wrote DUEL based on his own
story.  DUEL was one of the first films to bring serious attention to
Stephen Spielberg.  The lady in Toronto entered the theater passing a
large standup ad for WHAT DREAMS MAY COME adapted from the novel by
Richard Matheson. That is about 45 years that Matheson has been a force
to reckon with in horror in the visual media.  STIR OF ECHOES is based
on the novel A STIR OF ECHOES by Richard Matheson.
     Tom Witzky (played by Kevin Bacon) is a sort of lower middle class
telephone lineman in an older suburb of Chicago.  His main
entertainments involve beer and sports.  Both he and his wife Maggie
(Kathryn Erbe) are vaguely dissatisfied with their downbeat existence.
Their son Jake (Zachary David Cope) seems to live in his own world
talking to an imaginary friend, Samantha.  Maggie has a male-hating
friend Lisa (Illeana Douglas) who is in training to be a hypno-
therapist.  One night at a party Tom makes fun of Lisa's profession and
Lisa suggests he allow her to hypnotize him.  She leaves him with a
post-hypnotic suggestion to be more "leave his mind open."  The
suggestion works too well. Tom's mind is open to more than just a few
new ideas; it is open to some forces in the universe better left alone.
He starts having disturbing and graphic nightmares, continuations of
visions he had under hypnosis, and worse, now he sees Samantha himself.
And she looks to him like a walking corpse.  Tom starts to associate
this ghostly apparition with a neighbor girl named Samantha who
disappeared from the neighborhood some months before.  Slowly he
becomes obsessed with proving his visions of Samantha are real and that
she must have been murdered in his house.
     David Koepp has been a writer on several big-ticket films of the
recent years including CARLITO'S WAY, JURASSIC PARK, THE SHADOW,
MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, THE TRIGGER EFFECT (which he also directed), THE
LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK, and MEN IN BLACK.  Here he both writes and
directs; though the film is based on a novel by Richard Matheson.  He
does have a nice hand with mood as he keeps the lighting subdued and
sets the film in an older neighborhood to create more atmosphere.  The
latter is a curious move on his part having written the screenplay.
The novel, written in 1958, is set in a then modern suburb.  The story
could well have been set in the neighborhood where POLTERGEIST was set
instead of this old Chicago neighborhood.  But the script explicitly
calls attention to the fact that the house is new or at least that the
Witzkys are the first people who have ever lived in the house.  The
line makes no sense in a house this old.  I also note with pleasure a
nod to Richard Matheson in that a babysitter is reading his THE
SHRINKING MAN.  (And given that it is an old edition and was probably
purchased in Chicago.  The odds say she got it at the bookstore The
Stars Our Destination.)  The setting does not always work and a little
doctoring of the script might have made the film make more sense.
     This is a tense and atmospheric film.  Kevin Bacon does a
convincing job of playing the working class main character.  But in the
final analysis there is not much new in the film.  To be memorable it
would have to build up to something a little less prosaic.  I rate it a
6 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
The year's second scariest film (after The Blair Witch Project) comes
from an unlikely source  writer/director David Koepp (The Trigger
Effect), who adapted the script from Richard Matheson's book (he also
wrote the novel What Dreams May Come).  Echoes will unfortunately open
after the similar but big-budgeted Bruce Willis flick The Sixth Sense
(due 8/6), but is still one of the creepiest films to be released since
Se7en.
Echoes opens with a little boy named Jake staring into the camera while
sitting in the tub.  He's answering questions that nobody appears to be
asking.  Is it an imaginary friend?  His parents seem to think so, but
Jake is really conversing with the spirit of a missing local girl named
Samantha Kozak.
Kevin Bacon (Wild Things) plays Tom Witzky, Jake's blue-collar working
father that has spent his entire life within a six-block radius of one
Chicago neighborhood.  He's disappointed with his boring life and
dead-end job.  His hippie sister-in-law Lisa (Illeana Douglas, Grace of
my Heart) talks a disbelieving Tom into undergoing hypnosis at a party.
He only sees a second or two of seemingly unrelated and fragmented
flashes, but when Tom comes to, he's been told that he was out for
several minutes.  To make matters worse, Lisa also plants a suggestion
into Tom's subconscious.  Not the kind that will make him cluck like a
chicken when somebody says the word `omelette,' but rather an innocent
appeal to be a bit more open-minded.
Before he went under, Tom crowed `C'mon  what's the worst that could
happen?'  Well, the worst does happen - amateur hypnotist Lisa
accidentally opened the door to his mind instead of making him
open-minded.  What does that mean?  Just that Tom slowly is able to see
and hear the same things as his son.  He catches more glimpses of the
spooky images that he saw while under hypnosis, and even catches a
glimpse or two of Samantha.  He also drinks a lot of orange juice and
begins to unwind mentally, putting a strain on his wife Maggie (Kathryn
Erbe, Dream with the Fishes).
When Lisa puts Tom under a second time in an attempt to close the
Pandora's box, he instead gets a one-word message from beyond: `Dig.'
What follows is very reminiscent of the slow descent into madness
previously seen in The Amityville Horror and The Shining.  In fact, you
can't help but think of Amityville's George Lutz (James Brolin) digging
up his basement while watching Bacon do the same thing.  And maybe
you'll be reminded of Bacon's Flatliners.  The story is derivative of
both films (and many others), but it's still original enough to raise
the hair on your arms on several occasions.
The story is fairly predictable (I called it about 40 minutes into the
film) but seems oddly short.  It's almost like a lot was carved out of
the final cut  Tom's rock band, Jake's baby monitor, Maggie's pregnancy
and a cop named Neil all seemed destined to have more screen time, but
were curiously skipped over after careful introductions.  But the film
is worth the price of admission just for Bacon and the young son's eerie
performances.  (1:35  R for brief nudity, sexual content, adult

        If you enjoyed "The Sixth Sense," you're gonna want to see
this supernatural thriller starring Kevin Bacon as a Chicago telephone
lineman who discovers horror lurking under his own roof after he's
hypnotized by his sister-in-law (Illeana Douglas) at a neighborhood
party. At first, Bacon's skeptical. He doesn't believe in mental
games, nor in ghosts. But when he hears his five year-old son (Zachary
David Cope) casually say, "Does it hurt to be dead?" to an unseen
apparition, he knows something's wrong. Then he "sees" a deathly pale,
terrified teenage girl who "disappeared" months earlier; she's a
vision, not real, but how did this tortured soul get on his
living-room sofa?  And who will believe him? Certainly not his
just-pregnant wife (Kathryn Erbe), who finds his bizarre behavior and
obsession with spooky, otherworldly things quite disturbing. Not even
his defensive sister-in-law, who insists she only planted an innocent
post-hypnotic suggestion into his subconscious.  Based on a 1958 novel
by Richard Matheson ("Somewhere in Time," "What Dreams May Come"),
screenwriter/director David Koepp cleverly builds the suspense slowly,
through character development not carnage, keeping the action low-key
and quite plausible. But many clues are revealed too early, and it's
quite reminiscent of Bacon's earlier film, "Flatliners," along with
"The Amityville Horror," even "The Shining." On the Granger Movie
Gauge of 1 to 10, "A Stir of Echoes" is a creepy 7. It's an eerie,
intriguing early Fall chiller.

     Yes, it's true -- STIR OF ECHOES features a child who sees dead
people.  It includes in its metaphysics the notion that disgruntled
spirits cause chilly temperatures in the human world.  It is at least
partially a tale of a wrongful death made right.  Depending on where you
fall in the old glass half-full/half-empty argument, STIR OF ECHOES is the
beneficiary of either extraordinarily good timing or extraordinarily bad
timing.  Maybe comparisons with mega-success THE SIXTH SENSE will doom it
to obscurity.  Or maybe a spillover effect, with movie-goers still hungry
for supernatural subject matter, will present it with an audience it might
not otherwise have had.
     For my money, viewers can't go far wrong either way.  If they go,
they'll be moderately satisfied; if they don't go, they won't be missing
all that much.  It begins as a tale of a working class Chicago guy named
Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon) who dabbles in a garage band and generally feels
his life hasn't amounted to all that much.  That perception changes
radically when his sister-in-law (Illeana Douglas) hypnotizes him at a
party, turning him into a receiver for weird psychic visions featuring
a missing neighborhood teenager (Jenny Morrison). Tom also discovers that
his 5-year-old son Jake (Zachary David Cope) is even more tuned into the
netherworld, and that his wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) is understandably
freaked out by his odd behavior.
     It's awfully easy to dwell on the similarities between STIR OF ECHOES
and THE SIXTH SENSE, weighing in simply with whether the former is better
or worse than the latter.  It would be easier to ignore those similarities
if the whole film didn't feel overly familiar.  When a kindly black cop
(Eddie Bo Smith Jr.) informs Maggie of Jake's visionary gifts, he suddenly
turns into Scatman Crothers in THE SHINING; when Tom's obsessive behavior
leads him to tear up the house and alienate his family, he's Richard
Dreyfuss in CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND.  The Richard Matheson
novel on which STIR OF ECHOES is based is forty years old, so no one can
rightly accuse the film of thievery.  That doesn't change the way STIR OF
ECHOES is likely to be viewed today: a mish-mash of familiar elements.
     That's not to say that STIR OF ECHOES isn't also a reasonably
effective thriller in its own conventional way.  David Koepp, who helmed
the unsettling and little-seen TRIGGER EFFECT, has a knack for crafting a
scene that gets under your skin without resorting to too many shock cuts.
He also draws nice work from a solid cast, particularly Erbe adding a few
shadings to the thankless wife role.  Koepp's direction may get a little
showy -- jittery time-lapse shots of ghosts, funky business in the
"theater" of Tom's hypnotic trance -- but it does its job manufacturing
the creeps.  It ain't deep, but it's scary enough.
     Unfortunately for STIR OF ECHOES, it's less effective than it could
be because Koepp seems to think it _is_ deep.  The subtext of Joe Six-Pack
Tom seeing his new gift as a shot at finally doing something extraordinary
comes and goes, and it's hard to see anything voluntary in his character
arc.  Bacon's performance suffers from this erratic motivation -- he's
reasonably convincing both in his terror and in his determination, but the
two never come together.  By the time Koepp trots out an extended
flashback of a crime in progress, his melodrama has bogged down the
chills.  Ironically, that's yet another way STIR OF ECHOES is like THE
SIXTH SENSE: it's a moderately clever genre diversion that wants us to
believe it's something more.
