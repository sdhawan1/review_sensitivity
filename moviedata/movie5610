I was surprised to discover that there was such a thing as a SECOND
JUNGLE BOOK. This is followed by a curious question Â– what makes it
different from the first? Not much. We have Mowgli the wolf boy, Baloo
the Bear, Baheera the Panther, Shere Kahn the Tiger and Kaa the snake.
All present in the 1967 Disney version, except they don't speak or
perform cabaret in this version. This movie is primarily geared towards
children, and in many ways it works judging from the reaction of the
talented young audience (imitating chimpanzee sounds). Children are
fascinated by animals and watching a child wander through the jungle,
without fear of the wild is reminiscent of the Garden of Eden in it's
hey day. My only morbid concern is of kids after watching this movie,
sneaking into a bear cage only to be eaten by the bear. Don't laugh,
it's happened before.
An amusing opening scene is of Mowgli (a very talented Jamie Williams),
being chased through the trees by two ugly chimpanzees with bad cases of
haemorrhoids. The scene ends with two chimpanzees on one side and Mowgli
with bear, panther and wolves backing him on the other. We know whose
going to win that fight! There is another amusing scene where Shere Kahn
the Tiger is attacking a camp of hunters. The men scatter up trees to
hide. The scene ends with the 7 year-old boy waving a fire stick at the
beast, before the frightened tiger runs away chased by a growling kid!
There are also numerous support roles for adults. Bill Campbell (THE
ROCKETEER) as the hunter looking for the boy, Roddy McDowall as the mad
King Murphy of the Lost City of Apes. However, this movie belongs to
Mowgli and the animals.
Great entertainment for the kids, especially if you don't want to take
them to The Zoo for Easter.
