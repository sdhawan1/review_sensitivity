Director Robert Benton has not faired well in
the scope of all film history. His autobiographical
1984 movie Places In The Heart was decent enough for
me, but it does not reach the emotional highs that
great film should. His recent effort Nobodys Fool
misses the mark also. He did write a masterpiece when
he co-wrote Bonnie And Clyde [1967]. Kramer Vs. Kramer
pulled at my emotions and at my patience with
its story of a divorcing couple and a rebellous young
son. Justin Henry is the boy who wants to be with
both his mom and his dad. He causes plenty of trouble
for Dustin Hoffman who plays the over stressed father.
Justin Henry's potrayal of the son is the best part in
this dull picture. He keeps you laughing and
you are kept busy wondering what will happen to him
next. The rest of the film is standard family
material that will leave most youny modern adiences
bored with its slow pace.  Save your money when you are
at the video store. Watch this one on television for
free.
