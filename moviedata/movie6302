JUDY BERLIN a film review by Athan Bezaitis.  Copyright filmcritic.com
2000
JUDY BERLIN has the unmistakable characteristics of a Woody Allen film
(though it's not one).  Its cerebral humor, rash characters, and
ensemble cast are gelled with a very Allenesque theme: that life has
simply passed by the small, predominantly Jewish community of Babylon,
Long Island.  First time director Eric Mendelsohn, who reportedly worked
with Allen on several films, shoots in black and white, and effectively
paints a dreary reality for the people of the small suburb.
As the story goes, it is the second day of school and the fall is in
full swing.  David Gold (Aaron Harnick) has returned to his parent's
home after spending time working in the film business in California.  He
runs into old high school classmate Judy Berlin (Edie Falco - from HBO's
Oz and The Sopranos), an outspoken yet dimwitted aspiring actress on her
way to Hollywood that very evening.  The story follows their respective
families as Judy and David spend the day reminiscing while a solar
eclipse darkens the town.
The real substance of the film lies in its characters and the stellar
cast.  Barbara Barrie (PRIVATE BENJAMIN) plays Sue Berlin, Judy's
mother, a stern schoolteacher who wears her problems in her forcefully
stoic face.  Madeline Kahn (YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN) is Alice Gold, a
recovering alcoholic who has alienated her son David and her husband
Arthur (Bob Dishy).  Best known for her comedic roles, Kahn (recently
deceased) puts on an Oscar-worthy performance as a mother who has
awakened from a mysterious slumber caused by the eclipse, discovering
she is an embittered housewife with a dismal existence.  Her portrayal
exudes a sad sincerity with her nasal voice and methodical stroll, but
manages to stay light and funny as Kahn weaves her magic.  Finally,
Julie Kavner (best known for her voice as Marge Simpson) adds an extra
dose of laughter into the mix with some great one-liners.
Worthy of much praise is Mendelsohn, who manages to twist an average
suburban town into a strange and majestic place filled with dark and
unexpected imagery.  The film is definitely "artsy" and heavily
symbol-laden via the eclipse and the setting in "Babylon," a stark
contrast from the thriving Biblical polis.
Despite its endearing qualities, the film has its flaws, especially the
blaring harpsichord score, which serves as musical interlude.  Also, I
found the character of Judy Berlin to be too unbelievable -- everything
from her zaniness to the railroad-looking "adult braces" she was
wearing.
Overall, the film is a score for Mendelsohn, who should get plenty of
opportunity to establish himself as tour de force director in Hollywood.

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Try if you wish, but Judy Berlin can't be pigeonholed into any
particular genre.  From a summary of the script, you might think the
film is another searing indictment of suburban life (a la American
Beauty).  A glimpse at the cast may have you believing that Berlin is a
Broadway play rather than a feature film.  Look at the stills from the
black-and-white movie and you may assume that you're dealing with a
quirky art flick.  If you watch a scene or two, you might guess Berlin
is Woody Allen's annual offering.
But it's not Woody  it's Eric.  Mendelsohn, that is.  The first-timer
from Long Island wrote, directed and edited Berlin after working as an
assistant costume designer on a handful of Allen's pictures, whose
influence is unmistakable in Mendelsohn's writing and directing style.
Mendelsohn picked up the Director's Award at the 1999 Sundance Festival
for Berlin, which also garnered Independent Spirit Award nominations for
the stark cinematography (Jeffrey Seckendorf) and the amazing Barbara
Barrie (Suddenly Susan).
Berlin is set in Babylon, Long Island during the twenty-four-hour period
preceding and following a lengthy solar eclipse that seems to have its
way with time.  Thirty-year-old David Gold (Aaron Harnick, Barrie's
real-life son), a former resident, has returned to Babylon via
Tinseltown after a failed attempt at a filmmaking career.  The moody and
mopey David runs into a former high school crush named Judy Berlin (Edie
Falco, The Sopranos) who, ironically, is on her way to California to
become an actress.
Two years David's senior, Judy's acting experience has been limited to
cheesy local commercials and her recurring role as a settler in a nearby
historical village.  She tried to write a screenplay but just couldn't
get into plots, characters, or even spelling.  The two spend the day
catching up and reliving old childhood memories.
The film takes place on the second day of the school year, and the
eclipse has teachers and administrators acting goofy as well.  David's
father Arthur (Bob Dishy, Jungle2Jungle) is the principal and has a
thing for one of the instructors (Barrie), who, coincidentally, happens
to be Judy's mother.  Arthur's wandering eye is almost justifiable  his
wife Alice (the late Madeline Kahn, Cosby) is a recovering alcoholic
that just won't shut up.  There is also an ex-teacher with Alzheimer's
that wanders into her old classroom and disrupts the day.
Mendelsohn and the rich black-and-white film stock perfectly capture the
surreal feel of the eclipse.  From the opening shot of a train blowing
its whistle and signaling the suspension of time, Berlin plays like a
dream, with its characters acting in ways that seem to surprise even
themselves.  The harpsichord-heavy score from Michael Nichols is
reminiscent of Rushmore.  And Berlin's acting corps, which also counts
among its ranks Julie Kavner and Anne Meara, is fantastic.

     Quite a bit has happened in the year since JUDY BERLIN premiered at
the 1999 Sundance Film Festival, and won director Eric Mendelsohn the
Dramatic Competition Directing Award. One co-star, Edie Falco, has become
a household name as long-suffering mob wife Carmela Soprano on HBO's "The
Sopranos." Another co-star, Madeline Kahn, lost her battle with ovarian
cancer. Perhaps most significantly, AMERICAN BEAUTY became a critical and
popular success with its cynical take on the facade of suburban bliss. It
doesn't take long for a film's entire context to change. Could JUDY BERLIN 
avoid feeling instantly, jarringly out-of-step?
     In the case of JUDY BERLIN, such concerns probably seem silly,
since its style is already so surreal and timeless. His black-and-white
tale takes place during one eventful fall day in the Long Island town of
Babylon, during a solar eclipse.  30-year-old aspiring filmmaker David
Gold (Aaron Hornick) is back in town staying with his parents Art (Bob
Dishy), the grade school principal, and Alice (Madeline Kahn), a flighty
housewife. Art is the object of desire of teacher Sue Berlin (Barbara
Barrie), and the affections may even be requited. David, meanwhile, runs
into his old high school classmate and Sue's daughter Judy (Edie Falco),
who is ready to leave that very night for Los Angeles to pursue her dreams
of an acting career.
     If JUDY BERLIN looks and plays like a suburban spin on a Woody Allen
ensemble comedy, it shouldn't be surprising; Mendelsohn spent years as an
assistant costume designer for Allen films. Essentially it's a character
study, exploring the submerged longings of its suburban denizens that come
to the surface only when the eclipse causes time to stand still. Alice
wanders the streets, playing at exploring an alien world; a retired
teacher (Bette Henritze) in the early stages of Alzheimer's also wanders
in a search for something familiar. The veteran cast members deliver some
superb performances, particularly Kahn in a very funny yet very sad piece
of work, and Barrie as the not-well-liked teacher with an unknown inner
life. JUDY BERLIN manages to hit some effective comic notes while always
staying true to the small, very personal desires of even its peripheral
characters.
     Mendelsohn's main characters, however, fare less well. The title of
the film tells us to focus on the interaction between David and Judy as 
the thematic center, and, unfortunately, the center doesn't hold. David
exists primarily as a stand-in for the filmmaker -- the frequent, nudgy
references to the fact that we're watching a story that's going to be
turned into a film don't help matters -- and Hornick doesn't do enough
with what is there. Edie Falco, meanwhile, shows a wonderful range in a
character light years removed from Carmela Soprano. It's a very
entertaining performance as an endearing character, but Judy is more a
symbol of possible escape than a fully-realized person. While David's
mopey self-loathing may ultimately come in for affectionate mockery, that
doesn't make it any easier to latch on to him as a protagonist, or to care
about the fate of David and Judy's relationship.
     Even when he fumbles one of his sub-plots, Mendelsohn keeps JUDY
BERLIN enough on the sweet side of bittersweet that it remains appealing.
He seems to find the suburbs far from a soulless place hiding dark
secrets, but rather a place like any other where people suspect the best
moments may already have passed them by. The look (Jeffrey Seckendorf's
black-and-white cinematography) and sound (Michael Nicholas's piano and
harpsichord score) may contribute much to JUDY BERLIN's sense of
timelessness, but the story itself plays a significant role. The
characters in the film spend much of the running in place because they're
always looking behind them. How refreshing to find a film that suggests 
there's something to look forward to -- even in the suburbs.

On the starting day of the new school year, elementary school teacher
Sue Berlin (Barbara Barrie) asks principal Arthur Gold (Bob Dishy) how
his wife is.  It's just polite small talk so he starts off with a
typically meaningless response.  "She's good; she's fine," he says
perfunctorily, and then he finds honesty creeping into his reply.  "I
don't know how she is, actually."  And then most candidly of all, he
concludes, "I don't know what I'm saying."
Writer/director Eric Mendelsohn's black-and-white ode to suburbia, JUDY
BERLIN, is set on Long Island, New York.  With a warmly evocative look,
the picture feels eerily like it will turn into a Twilight Zone episode
at any moment, but it never does.
The characters exist on two levels.  Outwardly, they are "fine, fine,
fine."  Internally, they seem to each be grappling with undisclosed
demons and worries.  The problem with the script is that it creates a
highly polished surface gloss but never does more than hint obliquely at
what might be going on inside the characters' heads.
Sue Berlin's daughter, Judy (Edie Falco from "The Sopranos"), is an
actress who wants to do more in film, although she admits she hasn't
done anything just yet.  She works at a local historical village, and
she is leaving today to go to L.A. -- "you know, la-la-land."
Set during a single day in which a full eclipse of the sun occurs, the
story finds remarkably little for the cast to do.  Judy develops a bit
of an attachment to Authur Gold's son, David (Aaron Harnick), who has
just returned from doing an undefined something in the film industry.
Their brief romance never gels.
Mendelsohn does a superlative job of setting up the scenes.  The birds
chirp, the clouds float by and the characters pose dramatically.  But,
when he calls "action" and the tableau starts to talk, it never goes
much of anywhere.
The character of David would appear to be somewhat autobiographical.  He
keeps telling Judy of his proposed next film project.  He wants to make
a documentary on the daily life of their town.  One "without a plot," he
explains, and one in which everyone "would just be."  She tries to be
polite, but you can tell that she doesn't think the idea has much
promise.
"Didn't anything happen today?" David asks Judy at the day's end.
Actually, not much.
JUDY BERLIN runs 1:35.  It is not rated but would probably be PG-13 for
mature themes and a little profanity.  It would be acceptable for kids
around 9 and up, but most kids will find little to interest them.

Directed by Eric Mendelsohn from his screenplay. Starring Bob Dishy,
Madeline Kahn, Aaron Harnick. Running time: 93 minutes. Rated AA by the
MFCB. Reviewed on October 14th, 2000.
Eric Mendelsohn's "Judy Berlin" is a quiet, beautifully filmed drama about
the mundanity of the suburban lifestyle. Perhaps taking its cue from "The
Twilight Zone" (explicitly referenced) which often dealt with similar
themes, "Judy Berlin" examines the way people become trapped in their 
day-to-day life by interrupting their routine with the unexpected, and
depicting their reactions.
Set in the Long Island community of Babylon, "Judy Berlin" takes place on
a Tuesday in September. It is the second day of school. It is the day the
title character, an aspiring actress, is due to leave for California. It
is the day of a total solar eclipse. The principal of the local primary
school is Arthur Gold (Bob Dishy). His marriage to Alice (Madeline Kahn,
in her final film role) has long since exhausted its supply of affection,
and he is now engaged in vague, tentative flirtation with teacher Sue
Berlin (Barbara Barrie).
Meanwhile, Arthur and Alice's son David (Aaron Harnick) has returned home
from Hollywood, where he has been working as a director. David has given
up on life, and now endures an aimless existence, wandering the streets of
Babylon. He runs into Sue's daughter Judy (Edie Falco), who is leaving
town for Hollywood to break into movies. Acquaintances from their high
school days, David finds himself inviting Judy to lunch despite himself,
but his own experiences in the film industry threaten to taint Judy's
sunny outlook.
It may not be obvious at first just why the movie is named after Judy
Berlin. She is just one of several vital characters, and comes across as
more of a supporting player in David's personal drama than a central
protagonist on her own. But unlike all the other characters, Judy is
trying to break free of the prison that is Babylon. Her dreams may be
pleasant delusions (certainly, her acting abilities are more than a
little suspect), her future may well be awash in doubt and uncertainty,
but at least Judy is trying to craft her own future. The other principals
are trapped in the endless cycle of suburban life. Even David, who did
leave town once upon a time, never shed that mentality, and may indeed
subvert Judy's intentions with his cynical naysaying.
It is through Judy, and the eclipse, and a elderly retired teacher (Bette
Henritze) suffering from Alzheimer's that Mendelsohn gives his characters
a chance to break free of this cycle and, concurrently, illustrates just
how firmly ensconced in their routine they truly are. The story arc
involving Arthur and Sue is probably the best example of this: By the dim
light of the eclipse, Arthur finally decides to leave Alice and pursue a
relationship with Sue. But he is acting on pure, raw instinct -- "I don't
know what I'm doing," he confesses, and he could not be more truthful. 
Nothing in his life to date has prepared him for this deed; it is foreign
to him, no matter how much he desires it, and he fumbles through the
encounter like a child riding a bike for the first time.
Alice, meanwhile, undergoes an experience of self-revelation via the
eclipse. She is the only one who is really aware that it lasts an
unnaturally long time, and this is representative of the way she is slowly
becoming cognisant what is happening around here. She knows beyond a
shadow of a doubt that Arthur has left her and, moreover, she understands
why. Alice tries to comfort herself by making light of the strange
eclipse, pretending that she and her housekeeper are "space explorers",
but in a sense this is a very apt description. The experiences of the day
have led Alice into alien territory, a terrifying and foreign realisation
of life beyond the suburban routine.
Unfortunately, although there are many nice character moments in "Judy
Berlin", the movie never quite seems to come together; it is less than the
sum of its parts. Mendelsohn maintains a decent pace despite his quiet,
sometimes tedious subject matter, but a lot of the movie still feels
insubstantial. This stems largely from the fact that he has not chosen
particularly interesting characters; they serve their respective roles,
but most of them fail to really engage us in their struggles. There is
nothing distinctive enough to properly draw us in, and as a result, the
observations made about them carry less weight than they should.
Certainly, this is not the fault of the actors, who give generally
excellent performances. Dishy in particular is great to watch, finding a
nice range and perfectly expressing Arthur's deep, fundamental
confusion. Harnick is also commendable as David, believably portraying a
man utterly disinterested in himself and life in general. Kahn, who died
just three months after "Judy Berlin" debuted at the 1999 Toronto Film
Festival, has fun with her material, but also has an opportunity to 
demonstrate her sometimes overlooked dramatic skills (Alice's realisation
that Arthur has abandoned her is particular good). Of all the character
arcs, though, hers feels the least thought-out, and never really finds a
natural conclusion.
"Judy Berlin" is recorded entirely in black and white, and this is a
laudable decision by Mendelsohn. Not only does monochrome film accentuate
the surreality of Babylon under the eclipse, in the movie's early scenes
it also serves to hammer home the sheer mediocrity of suburban living.
In a way, though, this only emphasises the fact that "Judy Berlin" is more
an exercise of style than substance. It is lovely to watch, boasts very
good performers, and contains some good ideas. But the execution is less
than successful, as Mendelsohn never quite finds the proper vehicles
through which to express his themes. "Judy Berlin" is kind of like the old
cliche about Chinese food: enjoyable at the time, but afterward you're
left looking for more.

One of the characters in Judy Berlin describes a movie he is planning to make.
It's going to be about the town he grew up in, and it's not going to have a
plot. All of the people, their actions, and all of the things in the town will
make up the movie, and they will be interesting just because they exist in real
life. Quite an ambitious plan for a film. It's what director Eric Mendelsohn
does with his marvelous little black and white movie. Plotlines are very loose
in Judy Berlin, and indeed the characters actions are sometimes meaningless,
but they are always interesting. The entire movie is so surreal that it will
captivate you, and might even make you think. 
On the day of a solar eclipse, Judy Berlin (Edie Falco from The Sopranos) a
geeky, but goodhearted woman with braces is planning to leave for Los Angeles
to became an actress. She meets old high school crush David Gold (Aaron
Harnick) and the two spend the day looking back and forward at the past,
present, and future. David's mother Alice (the late Madeline Khan in her last
performance) roams her home street with her housekeeper pretending to be an
astronaut during the eclipse. Judy's mother Sue (Barbara Barrie) is a preschool
teacher watching the eclipse with her students, earlier she is frightened by a
former sweet old teacher who is losing her memory. She also seems interested in
David's father Arthur, even though he's married. All of the character's are in
some way related, and their plights (whether large or small) make for one of
the most fascinating, entertaining, and best pictures of the year. While others
will dislike the movie, possibly because it isn't really about anything, (and
they're right), I really felt drawn to the situation.
The superb screenplay written by director Mendelsohn really propels this movie.
It captures those strange moments of life when you're on your edge, or someone
surprises you, and finds humor in them. David discovers a different old friend
that hasn't changed since high school, and Alice visits a woman across the
street who claims she called her in an angry rage, but she doesn't remember a
thing. Both Berlins are gentle and vulnerable, indeed the movie seems sprinkled
with some type of sweetness that is almost nonexistent in modern day film. The
fact that Judy Berlin is a very small, and a (most likely) narrow audience
movie, will put it in few theaters. The Shooting Gallery adopted it as it's
opening film in their annual festival, but the movie isn't likely to get any
more of a release. Hopefully video will be a place for this movie to blossom.
It's really a shame though. The black and white is more suited for the big
screen. The contrast of colors in the images (attempted or not) is striking, a
large group of stills from the film would make a stunning collection of black
and white photography. Every one of the actors does a marvelous job, there is
so much talent in the performers, that it's just one of the many reasons to see
this movie two or three times. An honestly endearing film that transports us to
a mix between a real and fantasy world. I can't quite explain it, but this
movie struck such a chord with me that I'm ready to name it one of the best
pictures in several years. This movie about nothing, is certainly something.
Meg Ryan in You've Got Mail said, "All of these little nothings have meant more
to me than all the somethings before." If she were describing this movie, she
would be very, very right.

   During the New York City blackout of the late seventies,
some bad things were going down.  Stores were looted, car
windows were smashed, people were getting mugged. 
Something good came out of the experience, though. All TV's
were kaput in my own apartment building, and people
climbed down the stairs, candles in hand, to find out what
was going on.  Neighbors met neighbors for the first time as
we looked through the glass entrance to the building and
marveled at the absolute darkness of the adjacent streets,
streets rendered even darker than we had known them to be
during those rare total solar eclipses of the sun.
   The solar eclipse which is the central character of Eric
Mendelsohn's small and slight film, "Judy Berlin," serves
partly as metaphor for the obscured childhood dreams of the
folks of the Long Island community of Babyon and in part as
a marvel of nature which brings their repressed feelings to
the fore.  In this debut feature of Mr. Mendelsohn--which was
screened appropriately at a recent Hamptons Festival--some
strange and wonderful things happen during that single day.
But this picture is no high-budget vehicle for a Paul Thomas
Anderson, whose "Magnolia" similarly, in a period of a few
hours, brings together estranged people freighted with
feelings of guilt but adds a dramatic payoff of Divine will:
thousands of frogs rain down on one area of the San
Fernando Valley.  Instead, Mendelsohn's feature film is a
story of epiphanies realized by a small group of these
ordinary Long Island who are hit by a recognition of their
long-contained feelings.
   At the center is the mother of the title figure, Sue Berlin
(Barbara Barrie), a buttoned-down, divorced elementary
school teacher who relates well to her well-behaved pupils
and is about to come to grips with her feelings for her boss,
Arthur Gold (Bob Dishy), a frustrated principal.  Sue's
daughter, Judy Berlin (Edie Falco), about to leave for
Hollywood to try for an acting career, is a bubbly woman of
32, full of misguided optimism about her possibilities, who is
brought back to Earth in a chance meeting with Arthur Gold's
son depressed and unsuccessful son, David (Aaron Harnick)-
-a failed film-maker who is still living at home with his dad
and his mother, Alice (Madeline Kahn).  
   While the most amusing scene in the movie takes place as
a small group of tourists watches a dramatized replay of what
the town was like in 1857 (with Judy Berlin playing the neatly-
costumed farmer), we are concerned principally with two
relationships sparked into life: one between Arthur Gold and
the divorced Sue Berlin; the other between the nebbishy
David and the spirited Judy.  While we suspect that both
connections will fizzle out like the clouding over of the sun at
12:48 that afternoon, Mendelsohn has afforded us a slice of
life, and of equal importance, has affirmed his faith in the
beauty of suburbia.  
   "Judy Berlin" goes against audience expectations in that it
is uncritical of life outside metropolitan areas.  The picture
appears to have been made by a man who was brought up
on a quiet, tree-lined street in a relatively small community,
who had little desire to go to "the city," and who has a great
affection for the suburban way of life.  While the picture
poses as a modern Chekhovian tale--the silences and pauses
more meaningful than the spoken dialogue--Jeffrey
Seckendorf's cinematography is hard to take.  The entire
screen is enveloped in shadows, disastrous especially for a
black-and-white movie, giving what is purportedly an
optimistic yarn the ambiance of a cynical noir film.  While Bob
Dishy is super as a man who has been ground down by his
yammering wife and who takes comfort in a brief hug with
one of his teachers, there is not enough drama to make the
story watchable.  "Uncle Vanya" this is not.  Rather this is the
sort of chamber piece that would fit perhaps in a 50-seat off-
off-Broadway theater but is lost on the large screen.  
Not Yet Rated.  Running Time: 96 minutes.  (C) 1999
