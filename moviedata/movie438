An Inuit fisherman stands over a hill in a vast landscape that seems to 
go on for ever in the mid nineteenth century.  After a couple seconds of 
nothingness where the man's attention doesn't meander at all, a large 
shooting star of some sort shoots down and hits the surface.  Of course, 
the hunter's dogs are the first to notice it but as he looks up, the 
meteorite or whatever it is hits and a huge avalance of snow is created 
that begins to quickly move towards the hunter.  He grabs his dogs and 
mushes them along as fast as they can go so they aren't eaten by the 
snow.  But they are too snow and they are swallowed by the avalanche.  
Now what the hell just happened?  Somehow the film moves to the present 
day in freaking Denmark and just lets this lie in the viewer's mind 
until they are good and ready to explain this spectacular looking and 
intriguing beginning.  And somehow, the film has so much restraint that 
it builds up to its explanation in an interesting way.  Somehow this 
film works.
The plot switches to that of a murder mystery done independantly with 
little outiside help from Smilla Jaspersen (Julia Ormond, in an 
interesting hairdo which looks far better than any she has had before). 
 Smilla is perhaps the most complex action hero this mystery genre has 
seen in quite a while if ever.  She is actually three-dimensional with 
character flaws and explanation for all of her actions.  Brought up in 
Greenland, she has a phobia of closed spaces and a keen sense of snow.  
Of course, she is as cold as her snow and distants herself from 
everybody.  She works by herself (except for her snow) and lives all by 
herself as well in an apartment building.
After a few shots of her working and walking home alone, the plot starts 
as she comes home and sees a corpse of a young boy on the ground.  We 
find out he is half-Inuit and was the only close relationship Smilla has 
ever really had (nothing sexual really, but the pedaphilic undertones 
are tapped in a bedscene between the two - Hey!  She was taking care of 
him 'cause his mom was a louse).  In a series of flashbacks, we see how 
she let the boy into her life and taught him Greenlandic history.  But 
now her world is shattered and she is told he fell from the roof while 
playing.  For one, the boy had a fear of heights and the snow imprints 
show acceleration.
Smilla starts her independent investigation immeadiately and we discover 
things as she discovers them.  She comes across bizarre characters and 
facts.  One of these bizarre characters is her neighbor, known as "The 
Mechanic" (Gabriel Burne, excellent, as usual), who has a crush on 
Smilla and stutters when he's around her...of course, she catches this 
early on and makes an arse of him.  He becomes her confidant and helper 
as he is very intrigued by it (or is it just one of those crush things?) 
but he becomes much like Cary Grant was to Audrey Hepburn in "Charade:" 
a man who seems to do sinister things and you just don't know if you can 
trust him.  In one scene in particular, Smilla goes to have lunch with 
her American father (Robert Loggia) and finds "The Mechanic" having 
lunch with one of the supposed enemies - an industrialist or something 
(Richard Harris, also excellent as usual).  When he confronts her and 
tries to explain what he was doing, he asks if she trusts him.  In a 
perfect acting job, Smilla gives him a short look and says straight 
faced and subtely, "No," then walks away.
The third act (which caused me to lower my grade from ****1/2 to ***1/2) 
seems to be too X-Files-esque or Smilla-meets-Indiana-Jones as she 
becomes a somewhat action star, though she doesn't do any real stunts or 
anything.  She stows away on a boat heading for Greenland (refuse to 
explain it - go see the damn movie and find out) and discovers something 
about prehistoric worms that can kill (???) and some shots are fired and 
a hatchet is even thrown.  Of course, none of this is done by Smilla.  
At the end, Smilla watches as she uncovers the final facts in her 
mystery and the enemy drowns in the Arctic.  She does nothing to cause 
his drowning (except not help him) and she sees how bleak knowing 
everything is.  By the end, she has pieced together all the pieces of 
the giant puzzle and we discover what the hell the beginning meant.  But 
we still feel kinda let-down because Smilla has almost destroyed her 
life in search for the truth.  Perhaps the message is something like: 
absolute truth is not absolutely satisfying.  At least that's what I got 
out of it.  I could be wrong.
The things to reccomend about this film are the bleak and unerrving 
atmosphere that is sustained throughout the entire film, the way that 
the film pieces the mystery together as the protagonist pieces them, and 
the fantastic, Oscar-nomination worthy acting job done by Julia Ormond. 
 She basically becomes Smilla Jaspersen and you won't see any bit of 
Guenivere, Sabrina or that lass she played in "Legends of the Fall."  
Smilla is a cold, three-dimensional character, and Ormond fills her 
pesonality to a "T" and makes her as fascinating as a real-life person.

When I first heard that Smilla had a sense of snow, I was expecting her
to climb Mt Everest. She doesn't. Instead this ice maiden spits liquid
nitrogen with a vengeance and shoots icicles from her arse. She is one
seriously, emotionally frozen lass who is perpetually on the edge of the
toilet seat. What is Smilla's problem? Her Icelandic mother died when
she was six depriving her of the comfort of breast milk. Her Anglo-Saxon
father whisks her away to the confines of Denmark, away from the open
spaces of Greenland. She then competes with her father's bimbette
mistress for his love, before she befriends a deaf Icelandic boy who
gets pushed off the roof of her apartment blocks. So it's not surprising
that Smilla (Julia Ormond) gets pretty pissed off when her only friend
gets killed. The reclusive, bitter Smilla shouts foul play, not because
she has a feeling for snow, but because she's got a feeling it's murder.
The story then revolves around bizarre meteorites and ancient parasitic
worms, which is all fantastically unbelievable. These elements serve as
a mere distraction to the far more interesting Smilla on which the story
is based. This woman who bites, fights, spits to get her way makes an
interesting character, but she is also confused, frightened and fragile
making her a bit of an enigma. If only this movie carried more romance
than mere mystery and suspense, then perhaps Gabrielle Byrne would not
have been wasted as a male body. He gets to bed Smilla and temporarily
defrosts the ice maiden, but that's as interesting as his character
gets. Annoyingly, he is so mysterious that he can't make up his mind
whether he wants to be a good guy or bad guy  leaving the audience with
little hope of figuring him out.
This movie has an interesting feel to it that one finds hard to put into
words, except to say that one gets a good sense of frost when Smilla's
around. Although it scores poorly in the department of plot conclusion,
it redeems itself in creating a character as memorable as Smilla.

     SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW (say it three times fast and sound like an 
asp) opens with a breathtaking image:  great cliffs of gray-blue ice 
towering over a vast plain of white.  Once the opening credits have 
concluded, we suddenly find ourselves adrift in a special effects-
enhanced prologue set in 1859 Greenland.  And, while this sequence seems 
completely disconnected with the movie that follows, it is a visually 
pleasing way to introduce a contemporary mystery that incorporates 
murder, greed, and science fiction into an often uneven, occasionally 
preposterous, but always engrossing whole.
     Based on the novel by Peter Hoeg, SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW is truly 
an international production.  The cast is comprised primarily of British 
and American screen luminaries; the director, Bille August, is a Dane; 
and the film's funding comes from Germany, Denmark, Sweden, and the 
United States.  Although the action transpires entirely in Copenhagen 
and Greenland, the dialogue is exclusively in English, with nary a 
subtitle to be found. 
     Julia Ormond (SABRINA) plays Smilla Jaspersen, a half-Inuit 
mathematician who currently resides in Denmark.  One day, upon returning 
to her apartment, she discovers that Isaiah (Clipper Miano), the child 
who lives on the floor below her, has fallen to his death.  The 
authorities say the fall from the roof was an accident, but, citing 
certain irregularities about the incident, Smilla claims it was murder.  
Another resident of the building (Gabriel Byrne) agrees with her.  When 
the local police stonewall her, Smilla begins investigating on her own, 
and, the deeper she gets, the more dangerous the situation becomes.  Her 
inquiries lead directly to the powerful and wealthy Dr. Tork (Richard 
Harris), the head of Greenland Mining, who is behind a cover-up that 
includes, among other things, a host of prehistoric worms (I am not 
making this up).
     As thrillers go, SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW is definitely 
unconventional.  The locations are atypical, the protagonist is a woman 
who doesn't run into the arms of a man at the first sign of trouble, and 
there aren't any car chases.  The storyline is reasonably complex (not 
to mention a little silly) and features enough small surprises and 
twists to retain the average viewer's attention.  And, the fact that 
it's a "why-dunnit" or "how-dunnit," rather than a "who-dunnit," allows 
us to focus on more interesting issues than identifying possible red 
herrings.  As crisply directed by Bille August (PELLE THE CONQUEROR), 
SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW moves rapidly -- almost too rapidly.  The plot 
clicks along so briskly that numerous character details get lost in the 
rush.
     Smilla, as forcefully portrayed by Ormond, is a fascinating 
character, but many of the more interesting aspects of her personality 
are relegated to the background.  She's sullen, lonely, and angry, and, 
while a brief flashback or two attempt to explain why she is the way she 
is, they only hint at the reasons for her deep-rooted bitterness.  In 
fact, there were times when I actually became annoyed at the film for 
pursuing the plot with single-minded determination rather than taking a 
few moments to delve more deeply into the main character.  Smilla is 
presented with enough detail to tantalize, but not enough to satisfy.  
In the end, we're left wishing the movie had spent a little more time 
filling in a few more blanks.  
     Aside from Ormond, whose turn as Smilla is both effective and 
attention-grabbing, and Richard Harris, who brings a world-weary 
cynicism to his part, the acting is surprisingly lackluster.  Vanessa 
Redgrave is unremarkable in a cameo as a retired secretary with a key to 
secrets, and Robert Loggia, as Smilla's father, is a little too 
restrained (the actor always seems at his best when chewing on scenery).  
Most disappointing of all, however, is Gabriel Byrne, who seems ill-
suited for his role as Smilla's sidekick.  He's supposed to be 
enigmatic, but the actor's one-note performance makes him lifeless.
     The film's climax will probably seem preposterous for anyone 
expecting SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW to stay grounded in reality.  If 
nothing else, the opening sequence should prepare you to accept that 
boundaries not normally crossed in murder mysteries will be broken.  
SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW is not a landmark thriller, nor is it likely to 
appeal to those who demand a semblance of reality.  But it is involving 
and entertaining, and features an intriguing, independent heroine.  
Those things alone make it worth a trip to a nearby theater.

SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW (director: Bille August; screenwriter: Ann
Biderman/from the novel by Peter Hoeg; cinematographer: Jorgen Persson;
editor: Janius Billeskov; cast: Julia Ormond (Smilla Jaspersen), Gabriel
Byrne (the Mechanic), Richard Harris (Tork), Robert Loggia (Moritz
Johnson), Vanessa Redgrave (Elsa Lubing), Jim Broadbent (Lagermann), Tom
Wilkinson (Professor Loyen), Clipper Miano (Isaiah), Emma Croft (Benja),
Bob Peck (Ravn); Runtime: 121; Fox Searchlight Pictures; 1997)
There was a worm in the core of this turgid thriller that spoiled its
taste. The moody production of Smilla's Sense of Snow is adapted from
Peter Hoeg's best-seller. This is a film with so much unrealized
potential, about the icy heroine of the story, the tough-minded
half-American and half-Greenland Inuit, Smilla Jaspersen (Julia Ormond),
who seemingly stepped into a hole in the ice before the film's finale
and was ludicrously transformed from a captivating noir personality to a
typical Hollywood action heroine.
Smilla's Sense of Snow presents a mysterious story relying on tense
local atmosphere, enigmatic characters and twists in the plot, to spin
its dark tale of a heroine looking to find her roots again. The Danish
director, Bille August, who tries to be faithful to his fellow
countryman's source material, presents a glossy and sleek looking film
that inherits all the virtues and vices of the book, and comes up short
in the end because it cannot overcome how utterly ludicrous the story
becomes.
The film opens as a meteorite, in the Greenland of 1859, hits the ice
and crushes everyone in the vicinity, including an Inuit fisherman,
putting on a spectacular light show in the crushed ice, reminding me of
the pyrotechnics one would see at a July 4th celebration. The film then
switches to modern Coperhagen and the story involves the nefarious
dealings of a the Greenland Mining Company, whose secret research, which
turns out to be over parasitic worms coming to life from the fallen
meteor, becomes the crux of the mystery. But the personal story is about
Smilla being an Inuit living in a large modern city, using the boy's
death as an excuse to find out who she really is.
Smilla is a troubled young lady, never fitting into living in
Copenhagen, Denmark, where her father, an American doctor named Moritz
(Loggia), brought her after her mother was killed in a kayak accident
when she was six. She has remained detached from others in this
claustrophobic urbane setting ever since leaving the spaciousness of
Greenland, except she is drawn to a six year old deaf Inuit boy named
Isaiah (Clipper Miano) who lives in the same apartment building with his
alcoholic mother.
The mystery begins with Isaiah's puzzling death, which happens in the
film's beginning. The boy falls off the rooftop of his apartment
building and the only tracks on the snowy roof are his, as he heads
straight for the ledge. But Smilla questions the police that his death
is ruled accidental, as she notes the boy had a phobia about heights and
would never go up to the roof to play alone. She also relies on her
intuitions, as all her instincts tell her that Isaiah was murdered. As
she investigates the boy's death, writing a letter to the district
attorney to re-open the investigation and questions the medical doctor
who did the autopsy, and then becomes convinced she is right after
meeting with the mining company's secretary (Vanessa Redgrave), where
she learns from her of a secret company archive in the basement. She
even gets the unsolicited support of her nosy neighbor, who makes
friends with her and even becomes her lover. He is called the Mechanic
(Gabriel Byrne), someone whom she never quite trusts or knows what he
does for a living, but finds him useful as she finds that she is onto a
conspiracy, which puts her in danger and will eventually take her back
to her roots in Greenland.
Her investigation uncovers that the neglected boy's father died in a
mining explosion in Greenland, which resulted in the boy's recent
arrival to Denmark, where he is being examined by the mining company's
head doctor Professor Loyen (Tom Wilkinson), once every month, which
strikes her as being very strange.
What should strike the audience as even stranger is how the film ends up
in the same ice caves where the film opened up its story in the 19th
century. The last 30 minutes of this, until now, seemingly plausible
story, becomes unbelievable, as Smilla uses trickery to get herself on
board the Russian ship Kronos to Greenland. Aboard, she further
investigates the mystery of the boy's death by climbing inside a
dumbwaiter taking her to where the mystery passengers on ship reside,
where industrialist Andreas Třrk (Richard Harris), who is like one one
of those cartoonish James Bond movie villains, lusting for power, greed,
and fame, is confronted by our heroine who seeks only justice. This is
how one would do it in a formulaic Hollywood film, thereby putting a
damper on the terrific mood the film had just set. It was sort of like
going to dinner and getting a whiff of some sensual aromas and looking
at some appetizing food on display, but when getting down to the heart
of the meal with great anticipation, suddenly discovering the meal is
just not edible. If you can be satisfied with just the atmosphere and
not the story or any character being developed adequately, then you
might feel adequately nourished by what you saw. I wasn't. I was just
swept away by the moody setting, the fine stoic performance by Ormond,
and the potential for intrigue -- which, unfortunately, never
materialized as it could have.

     SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW is an international thriller with a sci-fi
twist.  And, though that twist may be difficult for some folks to warm
up to, all the other essential ingredients are here to make a mystery
nifty:  a tough-as-nails heroine (Julia Ormond, who, even as an ice
queen, is still the Most Beautiful Woman in the World), a shady sup-
porting character-turned-love interest (Gabriel Byrne), a child in peril
(albeit, with distress shown in flashback), and the ever-extending
tentacles of a big, bad corporation.  Great location work, too, in both
Denmark and Greenland.  SMILLA is a bit butt-numbing toward the end, but
who won't be taken back a double decade by the sight of Richard Harris
out on an ice flow?  Anyone up for an ORCA revival?

     Before SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW, the last time director Bille August
gut hold of a mysterious, best-selling novel was 1994's THE HOUSE OF THE
SPIRITS.  If that thought doesn't send a shudder of dread through you at
the prospects for SMILLA, you were probably fortunate enough to miss THE
HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS.  SPIRITS was a disastrous combination of mis-guided
casting and even more mis-guided story-telling, and it lost all sense of
Isabel Allende's magical realism.  Peter Hoeg's _Froken Smillas
Fornemmelse for Sne_ (Miss Smillas' Feeling for Snow) presented a
similarly challenging combination of atmosphere, character and plot, and
August, but this time around he has been much more faithful to the source
material.  Unfortunately, the result still isn't a particularly good film.
As tense and evocative as SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW is during its first hour,
it shares the fundamental flaw of the novel:  a strange plot device which
may leave you wondering if you've just seen "The X-Files" movie.
     Julia Ormond stars as Smilla Jaspersen, an arctic researcher living
in Copenhagen, Denmark.  A woman of Greenlandic Inuit descent who has
never felt comfortable in Denmark, Smilla has lived a life closed off from
all other people, with the exception of a young Inuit boy named Isaiah
(Clipper Miano) who lives in her apartment building.  That one friendship
is shattered when Isaiah is found dead on the sidewalk outside the
building, the victim of an apparent accidental fall from the roof.  But
Smilla has a special sense of snow, and her instincts tell her that
Isaiah's death was no accident -- he was running from something before he
fell to his death.  As Smilla investigates with the help of a neighbor
(Gabriel Byrne), she finds herself in the middle of a conspiracy which
will lead her back to the beautiful desolation of her icy homeland.
     You'd never expect a film with the plot I just described based on the
first scene in SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW.  It shows a 19th century Inuit ice
fisherman rudely interrupted from his labors by a crashing meteorite,
which proceeds to create a tidal wave of crushed ice sufficient to supply
the planet with daquiris for several decades.  The moment is spectacular,
but when the scene suddenly shifts to modern Copenhagen and the film
becomes a dark, moody mystery, you might wonder whether you've just had an
out-of-genre experience.  More to the point, you might fear that August
has snapped his cap.
     Actually, August is simply preparing the audience for the radical
shift still to come, a shift which wasn't nearly as radical in Hoeg's
novel.  For about three-quarters of its length, SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW is
a fairly compelling character study anchored by a strong lead performance.
Julia Ormond may be a bit young for Hoeg's Smilla, but she makes the
character her own with an unapologetic toughness uncommon in female screen
characters.  Smilla's relationship with the neglected Isaiah is skillfully
established in flashbacks, and though Smilla is not a particularly
pleasant person her loyalty and determination win the audience over to her
side.  Screenwriter Ann Biderman has done a fine job of paring down the
novel's often-cumbersome plot and its glut of conspirators, allowing the
focus to stay squarely on Smilla and her relationships.  Ormond's
performance and August's direction capture Hoeg's lyrical, haunting
psychological drama, a style reminiscent of _The English Patient_ author
Michael Ondaatje.
     But then there's that third act, and there's nothing August, Biderman
or anyone else can do about SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW's unexpected
metamorphosis from Michael Ondaatje to Michael Crichton except take it all
the way overboard.  The Greenland-based climax includes some splendid
landscapes by cinematographer Jorgen Persson, and the arctic vastness
suggests the coming of a resolution with an internal dimension -- Smilla
coming to terms with her life, her land and her heritage.
     Well, the resolution is internal, all right, only it's the interior
of an ice cave, where villainous industrialist Andreas Tork (Richard
Harris) is up to no good with some mutant parasitic worms and the same
meteorite which spoiled the day of our old friend the ice fisherman a
hundred years and five reels earlier.  The finale is so utterly bizarre --
and so unsatisfying -- that it taints the entire two hour experience of
SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW.  Perhaps Bille August needs to choose something
simple for his next project, a story which doesn't begin as an emotional
journey and end as a cross between a James Bond film and THE BLOB.

Julia Ormond (Smilla) is in her chilly element as a Greenland Inuit
loner now residing unhappily in Copenhagen. Her only friend is a young
boy who lives in her apartment building. When she finds him dead from a
fall from the roof, it is the beginning of a mystery.
The film is heavy in atmospheric mood and engrossing. For the first
two-thirds that is. Then things get weird and the movie jumps sideways
into an "X-Files" story.  The switch from a riddle involving corporate
cover-ups (seems to be all the rage) to a science fiction plot is a bit
too much to take and the film falls apart at the end.
Wonderful cinematography and settings do their best to keep interest
alive and succeed although it would have been nice to have watched the
ending to the film that I saw the beginning of.

     Providing all of the elements of a mystery is not the same thing
as actually crafting one.  And taking a famous book and bringing it to
the screen does not guarantee that the film will be successful.
     Director Bille August, whose 1993 adaptation of Isabel Allende's
"La Casa de los Espiritus" (THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS) was widely
derided, turns his attention this time to Peter Hoeg's highly regarded
novel "Froken Smillas Fornemmelse for Sne" (SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW.)
I have not read the book but am told that, although complex, it is not
as obtuse as Ann Biderman's screenplay for the movie.  This film is as
cold as the landscape and rarely engages the audience.  So slow moving,
you begin to wonder if the snow's effect on the actors is to blame.
     As preposterous and ponderous as the story can be, it has great
atmosphere and one excellent performance.  I have always thought of
Julia Ormond, who was delightful in SABRINA, as being an actress with a
limited repertoire.  She has played lovely heroines, but not tough
ones.  Here she shows her acting dexterity.  Her starring role as
Smilla Jaspersen demonstrates she has a much wider acting range than I
had imagined.
     Ormond's Smilla is a tough and cynical loner.  An unemployed
mathematician, she has been kicked out of four schools.  Smilla has
supposedly bonded with a six-year-old Inuit boy named Isaiah (Clipper
Miano), who lives in her apartment building in Copenhagen.  The lack of
any credible chemistry between them makes an already unbelievable show
even more so.
     One day Smilla comes home to find the boy dead in the snow.  He
either fell from the roof while playing as the police claim or was
forced off by someone who did not leave his footprints in the snow.
Like last year's SHADOW CONSPIRACY, the story will begin to hint at
some massive conspiracy and cover-up.  The boy's alcoholic mother tells
Smilla that his father died in a mysterious accident in Greenland while
working for Greenland Mining.
     Gabriel Byrne plays his canonical cryptic character.  This time
his character is known only as The Mechanic.  The Mechanic lives in the
same building as Smilla and may or may be helping her.
     Providing easily the worst acting in the picture, Richard Harris
oozes in with a cliche-ridden performance as Tork Hviid, the head of
the infamous Greenland Mining.  Vanessa Redgrave has a nice bit part as
Elsa Lubing.  Elsa, who seems to have just discovered religion, used to
work for Tork.  Smilla tries to enlist her aid in solving the murder
puzzle.  Smilla, having detected something in the snow after the boy
died, explains to Elsa, "The way you have a sense of God, I have a
sense of snow."
     Other than Ormond's performance and Joergen Persson's magnificent
cinematography of Greenland, the only reason to see the show is the
mystery so I will reveal little.  Suffice it to say that it involves
prehistoric worms.
     On a small note, after our family spent a wonderful time in
Copenhagen last summer, I was disappointed to see such a gorgeous and
colorful city made so gray and depressing.  Although I understand the
film wanted to do this to contrast it with the beauty and freshness of
Greenland, I found it sad nevertheless.  Perhaps a better film would
have made me more forgiving.
     SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW runs too long at 2:00.  It is rated R for
language, some violence and a sex scene.  It is a mild R and the film
would be fine for any teenager.  Although there are parts to admire,
there is not enough for me to be able to recommend it.  I give this
cold tale **.
Opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's.

Smilla Jasperson lives alone in a Copenhagen apartment. Her closest
friend seems to a little boy called Isiah. Sadly he dies after falling
to death from the top of the apartment building roof. Why? Well that's
what Smilla wants to find out. She starts investigating, and finds a
conspiracy involving prehistoric worms (!).
The movie starts out quite good, with a scene that is not the book. A
meteorite (or something) crash lands not far away from where a man is
seal hunting, this starts an avalanche (or whatever) and he (his dogs
actually) has to run for his life. Quite well made, and the scenery
that preceded it is quite stunning.
I have not read the book (OK, I've read the first fifty pages), I do
however own the paperback. On the back it states something like blah
blah political blah blah (LA Times). That must have the book, because
a "critique of society" is nowhere to be found in this book. Unless
the movie's moral (?) - bad guys are bad (!) - counts.
Bille August has made directed several movies based on books. The ones
I have seen (Zappa, Pelle the Conqueror, The House of Spirits) all
have in comon that they in fact make sense. Even without having read
the books one could understand what was going on - but maybe not
why. Or as Variety puts it: Smilla Jasperson's motivations
may not always be clear to the uninitiated. 
That is also true of this movie. Without having read much of the book,
the first hour still seems to capture the spirit of the book (or I'd
guess it does). Just like The Firm. However after an hour or so it
turns into "Smilla Bond", which is quite unbelievable. It seems quite
unlikely that Smilla has learned to climd down ships, trek across
Greenland etc. I do not know if this was in the book, but I hope not.
I have seen several movies that were incomprehensible without having
read the book (and with, say, Clear and Present Danger, that didn't
help much either). I have often seen movies based on books that have
made not want to see the movie. After seeing the first hour I thought
that I might want to read the whole book. After seeing the second hour
I'm not so sure. It could be that Peter Hoeg is not much of a crime
writer and had no idea as how to wrap things up. Or it could be that
the book's (and the movie's) ending in fact is crap. The ending in
fact seems like a cross of something like a Michael Crichton book
(perhaps The Andromeda Strain) and Superman III. (I'll get back to the
ending.)
Julia Ormond is quite pretty to watch, but she certainly does not look
anything like a Greenlander (or Eskimo). She also seems to have some
sort of Danish accent - which no one else in the movie has. Although
the much of the movie is set in Copenhagen, Denmark, almost everyone
speaks perfect English. One guy acts more English than Danish, and
reminded me of a commercial for Fisherman's Friend.
Somewhat irritating is the score. Intense situations = very intense
music. The cinematography is at time quite stunning (is there any
other kind as Roger Ebert would have said). Buy why is stock ice
footage used? Note to filmmakers: it's distracting.
The ending is probably the stupidest I have seen in quite some time,
and reminds me of Superman III. Though the movie is downhill only
during the second half, they could surely have thought of something
better? Towards the end of the movie we get to see *the* *most*
*unbelieable* version of "hope the baddie doen't turn his head another
inch or he'll see me".
The explanation as to why the boy plunged to his death? Stupid! Turns
out that Smilla knew all along what happened. Why on earth couldn't
she have revealed this during the first hour?
Hm... This review turned out more negative than I planned. Oh well.
Rating: total: ** 1/2 out of **** (first hour only: add a star)

Author
Marty Mapes
** (out of 4)SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW feels like it was written
chronologically. That is to say that it feels like the author (or
screenwriter) didn't really have an ending in mind, but plowed ahead
anyway with the story. 
It is a story about a death, probably a murder. Smilla (Julia Ormond)
comes home to her flat in Copenhagen and sees a crowd outside. A
Greenlandic child has fallen from the roof and died. Smilla recognizes
the child, Isaiah (Clipper Miano), and goes to the roof try to
understand the tragedy. She senses from the footprints left in the snow
that he was chased off the roof; he didn't just fall. 
The child's relationship to Smilla is gradually revealed through
flashback. We see that Isaiah's mother is often drunk and that Smilla,
half Greenlandic herself,  has been like another mother to him. Because
of this close bond, and because of a Greenlandic belief that murder is
an insult to the soul, Smilla embarks on a crusade to uncover the truth. 
She is surprised to see that she is thwarted at every turn. Nobody will
talk to her. The best she can get are vague pieces of some great puzzle.
Soon shadowy figures are trying to stop her or kill her. The mystery
grows from "who killed Isaiah" to "what is everybody hiding." 
I haven't read the book, but I suspect it was better than the movie.
Many of the devices used in mystery books just don't translate well to
the screen. For example, our hero has time to solve murders. She gets
some money from her father, and we vaguely know about her "work", but we
don't know how she lives. How does she pay for her apartment or her
computer? 
The movie also relied on too many coincidences. In a book, one could say
that an important sign was revealed in a photo. We could praise our hero
for her great detective work. In a movie, such a sign has to be big
enough for the audience to see, and in this movie, the photo comes
across as a comically obvious hint and not clever, observant detective
work. 
SKIP THIS PARAGRAPH IF YOU DON'T WANT THE "SURPRISE" BLOWN.Finally, the
answer to Smilla's great mystery is revealed to be a fantastic object
from the beginning of time. In a book, such things are much more
believable. Engrossed in the story and encouraged by subtle hints, we
tend to give internal reality to the author's words; we fill in the gaps
with our imaginations and with the tone of the book. However, in a
movie, there can be no gaps. An alternate reality must be created as
visually complete as possible in order to convince us that it is real.
In SMILLA, the movie's mystical keystone is a big wet rock and a pool of
water. In a book, our imaginations would tell us it's much more, but
visually, it's a big let-down. 
But this movie isn't bad just because of a poor translation from page to
screen. The story sets up expectations that it cannot meet. There is an
overwhelming sense of coverup and conspiracy. All of the characters
Smilla questions either lie to her, give evasive answers, or refuse to
talk. Whatever Smilla doesn't know is such a huge amazing conspiracy
that nobody dares speak of it to an outsider.The story sets up the
secret to be so incredibly amazing that nothing could possibly be
shocking enough to live up to all the hype. Naturally, this turns out to
be the case (see the previous paragraph). 
There were a few bright spots in the movie. The shots of the ice floes
of Greenland and of the ice-breaking ship are neat (even though some of
"Greenland" appears to be computer generated). 
Also, Clipper Miano gave a good performance as Isaiah. It was a small
role, but a bad child actor could have spoiled the mood of the movie.
The part could have easily been overplayed, but Miano was quiet,
reserved, and observant. 
I also liked Ormond's character in spite of some small inconsistencies.
Smilla is a very good female role.  She is genuinely strong and smart
(compared to fellow "scientist" Emma from THE SAINT). She has her own
desires. She's not interested in being someone's "better half." She is
her own person. 
She describes herself as "rough" and "heartbroken". She is both. When
The Mechanic (Gabriel Byrne), a neighbor who may be part of the
conspiracy,  approaches her, she interprets his interest as overtures to
sex, and she rebuffs him. She doesn't mind being friends with The
Mechanic, but she knows a pass when she sees it and she is just not
interested; she has other things on her mind. 
Later on, she actually complies with The Mechanic's request for a kiss,
and I find this to be an inconsistency with her character. On the other
hand, it could be the actors' faults for not generating any chemistry on
screen. 
But in spite of its good points, on the whole, I'd rather have read the
book. It feels like something got lost in the translation.
