"Tarzan and the Lost City" is one of the most anemic movies to
come out in quite a while. Not only it is poorly written, badly
acted, and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas, it is
thoroughly uninspired and insipid.
Unfortunately, it's not bad in the way great, colossal misfires
like "Heaven's Gate" (1980) or "Ishtar" (1987) were bad. 
Instead, it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody
wanted to be associated with, which begs the question of why it
was made in the first place. With all the good scripts lying
around Hollywood un-produced, how does needless drek like this
make its way to the big screen?
Of course, Tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of
motion picture history - he has appeared in over forty films,
which have ranged from the very good (1984's "Greystoke: The
Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes") down to the really bad
(1981's "Tarzan, the Ape Man" with Bo Derek). Most of these films
were just cheapie B-movies made in the thirties and forties,
starring ex-Olympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps.
Therefore, if another Tarzan movie is to be made, one might
assume that it would have something new to offer - a different
angle, an original storyline, anything to set it apart from all
the others. "Greystoke" added a never-before-seen level of
realism to the pulpy tale, and even "Tarzan, the Ape Man" at
least had the mis-guided audacity to sexualize the story as a
vehicle for Bo Derek's bare breasts.
"Tarzan and the Lost City," on the other hand, has absolutely
nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad
dialogue. The script, by Bayard Johnson and J. Anderson Black is
about as formulaic and generic as they come. Comic books have
better plots than this. The movie is so bad, in fact, that it
retains that ridiculous Tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked
in last summer's comedy "George of the Jungle." Didn't the
producers think to leave that back in the old Weissmuller
pictures where it belongs?
The story starts with the legend of Tarzan already firmly
established: a quick opening narration tells of Tarzan (Casper
Van Dien) being found in the jungle after having been raised by
apes, and his return to England where he assumes his Greystoke
heritage. When the movie starts in 1913, he is a civilized
English gentleman (without an English accent), and he is to marry
Jane (Jane March) in less than a week.
However, when a wicked archeologist/grave-robber named Nigel
Ravens (Steve Waddington) begins hunting for the fabled lost City
of Opar, one of Africa's last great secrets, the witch doctor of
an ancient African tribe summons Tarzan back to the jungle. At
first, Jane refuses to go, pouting about how it will interfere
with their wedding; but after Tarzan leaves she changes her mind
and tracks him down, therefore assuring lots of lame smooch
scenes between her and her ape-man.
Once the film gets going (in its own sluggish way), it delves
into a series of jungle adventures, as Tarzan, Jane, and the
natives attempt the thwart Ravens and his crew from discovering
the city. Most of the so-called adventures are cheesy,
predictable, and unexciting, with no pace, tension, or action to
speak of. There are sequences stolen from innumerable recent
adventure movies, ranging from "Raiders of the Lost Ark" (1981)
to "The Goonies" (1985). When the movie is running short on
action, it includes a few Greenpeace-friendly scenes of Tarzan
freeing caged animals, releasing a baby elephant from a trap, and
throwing ivory tusks into the river.
The movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality. For
instance, when Tarzan - who was raised in the jungle - is bit by
a cobra, he doesn't even attempt to suck the venom out like any
semi-experienced weekend backpacker would do. Instead, he ties a
tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with
no plan for survival.
Of course, one can't help but notice how fundamentally misleading
the title is. Not to ruin the ending or anything, but there is no
lost city. There is, however, a lost pyramid, which I suppose is
all the resource-strapped FX department could come up with (the
special effects are not worthy of a made-for-TV movie). Which
also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to
slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost
pyramid, when it's sitting right out in the middle of an open
field?
Strictly speaking, "Tarzan and the Lost City" isn't even bad
enough to have camp quality, although Casper Van Dien's laughably
stiff performance comes real close. This movie proves what
"Starship Troopers" only hinted at: he cannot act, but he sure
looks well-groomed, even in the deepest heart of the African
jungle. Van Dien is much too much of a pretty-boy to be an
effective Tarzan; he's a Calvin Klein model in a loin cloth. I
also wondered what the make-up department was thinking when it
outfitted him with that awful circa-1983 Steve Perry haircut.
Waddington makes a decent villain, although he's like a charmless
version of Belloq from "Raiders of the Lost Ark." As Jane, the
ex-model Jane March has little to do but smile and look pretty
next to Tarzan. She does fire off a gun at the evil treasure
hunters a time or two, but whenever a snake comes into the
picture, she is reduced to a hysterical mess.
However, amidst all this complaining, I do have one piece of good
news. "Tarzan and the Lost City" is so lacking in ideas both new
and old, that it is unable to fill even an hour and a half of
celluloid. So, we can say this much for it: at least it had the
decency to be short.

There are many films about that great jungle guy Tarzan, but I've only
seen a couple of them.  I've been subjected to Tarzan, the Ape Man
(1932) with Johnny Weissmuller, which is one of the earliest, if not the
earliest, of the series.  Although considered a classic by some, I found
it to be an intensely dull film on every level.  The other that I've
seen is Greystoke (1984), with Christopher Lambert as Tarzan and Ian
Holm as his friend.  That film I enjoyed very much; it's well-made,
well-acted, and seemed to update the very dated concept competently.
Now, in 1998, we are given Tarzan and the Lost City, staring Casper Van
Dien (of Starship Troopers) as the man in the title.  It's much more
like the 1932 film, although far worse in every way.  This is a
profoundly boring cinematic experience.  Not only is it boring--it's a
terrible film.  It's poorly acted, terribly written, ornamented in
sloppy special effects, and a shameless Indiana Jones rip-off.  Even the
sets and locations, which should be vast and exciting, are dull and
perfunctory.  I'm not a fan of Tarzan to begin with, but I can
appreciate a good film about him.  Tarzan and the Lost City had me
looking at my watch every five minutes.
I've thought long and hard about how to synopsize the story, but the
"story" of this 83-minute feature is so thin that I find it vastly
difficult to do so.  Van Dien, as I mentioned, plays Tarzan.  We are not
introduced to him as a character--he simply appears in an early scene,
dressed in a tuxedo, apparently having already passed the humanizing
phase that I thought was present in all Tarzan films.  
The next scene has him telling Jane (Jane March) that he needs to go to
Africa to stop somebody bad.  Jane is also given no real introduction;
when we first see her, it's like we're already supposed to know who she
is and what she's like.  This is a major flaw:  this film, since it's
not an official sequel or continuation of any story, should start from
scratch and introduce characters--especially the main characters--in a
formal way.  Since it doesn't, the characters are never explained or
developed, and there's nothing to care about.
Well, they get to Africa, and Tarzan quickly takes off his clothes to
be a jungle guy.  It turns out that he's there to stop a mad fortune
seeker named Nigel Ravens (Steven Waddington), who's butchering African
tribes in his trek to find the Lost City described in the title.  What's
in the Lost City?  Who knows.  Why does he want to go there?  Don't
bother asking.  Even the climactic scene provides nothing but a light
show (and a poorly-animated one, at that), and never do we hear a single
coherent explanation of what the freakin' heck this piece of twaddle is
about.  The film even uses magic in a few scenes to solve problems
(Tarzan gets bitten by a poisonous snake, and is saved my magical bees),
and where this magic comes from or what it is remains a mystery at the
end of the film.
Did I mention the film is boring?  The direction by Carl Schenkel is
without even a hint of style to make it interesting, and a dry action
film is never good.  There's not a single clever shot in the entire
film, and there's not a scene to be found that is interesting, exciting,
funny, or charming.  There are a lot of moments featuring tribesmen
dancing, and none of this is new.  When they finally reach the Lost
City, it's just a big map painting of a pyramid.  I was expecting to be
enthralled in the visual presentation of this film (I didn't see any
previews for it beforehand), but there's nothing here to elicit
wonderment or awe.
The acting just isn't good, but there aren't any characters, so it
barely matters.  Waddington overacts in a rare way, but it's still not
fun like most overacting usually is.  March has almost no lines, and
therefore doesn't have much of chance to prove anything.  Van Dien's
wooden (but not terrible) acting is appropriate for Starship Troopers,
but here he needs to carry the whole show.  He looks right for the role,
but he begins the film with a hint of some unknown accent, and slowly
loses it as the film progresses.  This isn't that big of a deal, really,
because the screenplay (written by *two* people with apparently no
judgment whatsoever) provides almost no dialogue through the second half
of the film.
Tarzan and the Lost City is not a good Tarzan film.  It's not a good
film by any comparison, or by any definition of a "good" film.  It is
not entertaining.  It is not well-crafted.  It's a boring chore, an
exercise in inadequacy and ineptitude.  I don't recommend it, even if
you like bad films, even if you love Tarzan films.  I didn't care about
Tarzan films before this, and I'll approach them with skepticism from
now on.

I saw Tarzan and the Lost City last night, and I enjoyed it quite a bit.
I was quite impressed with how well they combined the Edgar Rice
Burroughs novels with the style of the old Johnny Weissmuller films. Oh
sure, it's not a perfect film... there's a particularly fake looking
monkey, and it stars a near unknown (Casper Van Dien is mostly known as
the star of Starship Troopers), but I don't think you go to this film
expecting big budget spectacle. You see a Tarzan flick because you want
to see a fun adventure story... and Tarzan and the Lost City delivers.
(just suspend your disbelief a little... especially in the last 5
minutes)
There's been a real lack of good movies about heroes in recent years.
Attempts to bring the spandex-wearing types from comic books into the
cinema have been mostly campy (the recent Batman films), or so painfully
dark as to obscure the "heroics" of the genre.  (Spawn)  In this new
Tarzan, we have a hero who is truly heroic, yet vulnerable, with very
little camp (thank goodness), and not much angst. (ditto).  Of course, I
fully expect most critics will really hate this film, but I don't think
they're seeing it for what it is... the return to the long-lost genre of
the jungle-adventure movies, the stuff of Saturday matinees in the 40's.
(My parents tell me about them :)
I'm not going to go into too many details about the plot, but I'll just
mention that I thought Van Dien's portrayal of Tarzan was right on.  He
portrayed him not as a man-beast (which is the common interpretation...
and the one that Disney appears to be going with in their upcoming
animated version), but as an intelligent savvy adventurer, yet one that
is still just a man.  He's at least half-clothed during most of the
movie, which is loyal to the novels, and even when he gets down to just
his shorts near the end, it's not a loincloth but torn shorts.  He
wields a knife and a bow and arrow, and looks the part of Tarzan.  None
of the actors are particularly amazing, but this isn't a film where you
look for great roles.  Besides, Casper Van Dien benefits from a
supporting cast of unknowns, as they don't overshadow him that way...
and in a Tarzan flick, that works.
Most people won't get Tarzan and the Lost City, but if you want 90
minutes of action-packed adventure escapism featuring a hero we haven't
seen done well in a long time, this film delivers despite some minor
glitches.  (Like the Stargate-esque finale)  I give it a B+

Written by: Bayard Johnson, J. Anderson Black
from stories and characters by Edgar Rice Burroughs
Starring: Casper Van Dien, Jane March, Steven Waddington
Ingredients: True love, Tarzan, Jane, lost city of Opar
Synopsis: 
Tarzan, (Casper Van Dien) jungle lord turned society guy, is in Britain
preparing for his wedding to Jane Porter (Jane March) when he receives a
psychic call from an African medicine man, telling him that white men
are plundering Africa. Some bad guys led by Mr. Nigel Ravens are on an
expedition to find and loot the lost African city of Opar, considered
taboo and sacred by the African natives, who unfortunately, don't have
the guns to stop Ravens and his men. Tarzan sails back to Africa to stop
Ravens. Jane soon follows Tarzan to Africa and is captured by Ravens. 
Opinion:
Other than less vine-swinging for Tarzan, and a more liberated Jane,
there is nothing new to be found here. Like Kevin Coster's accent in
ROBINHOOD, the African language, songs, and drum rhythms in TARZAN AND
THE LOST CITY are obviously faked. Tarzan's British accent seems to come
and go as well. 
The plot also has a big hole in it: the African medicine man Mugambi
supposedly summons Tarzan for help, but the shaman apparently possesses
enough magical powers to easily handle the white men on his own; he can
turn himself into giant bulletproof snakes and hordes of bees, and can
make dead bones turn into magical warriors. Even the non-magical African
villagers are able to send Raven and his looters scurrying away into a
cave - - using mere spears and arrows. So why ask Tarzan to come over
from England? The only real purpose Tarzan serves is to rescue Jane,
who, predictably gets captured following Tarzan to Africa.
Is it bad? Not really. TARZAN AND THE LOST CITY feels a lot like a
Saturday afternoon made-for-TV movie. With the same movie set and
characters but a different plot, language, and music, it would have been
a sharper, more exotic film.
Actually TARZAN AND THE LOST CITY reminds me a lot of the 12 BOMBA OF
THE JUNGLE action series movies made between 1949 and 1955, which - -
according to MATT'S BOMBA THE JUNGLE BOY MOVIE GUIDE - - were created by
hiring a B-movie veteran as the director/writer, and using "a shoestring
budget with predictable plots and a heavy reliance on stock jungle
footage."
Campy and predictable? Yes, but good enough for a Saturday afternoon.

  Take, for example, the notion of reviving Edgar Rice
Burroughs' Tarzan in the last days of the 20th century. John and Bo
Derek tried it in 1981, and the result was ``Tarzan the Ape Man,'' one
of the most abominable films of the '80s.
  In 1984, director Hugh Hudson attempted to put a new twist
on the Tarzan legend with his lavish ``Greystoke: The Legend of
Tarzan, Lord of the Apes,'' and came up with an epic as cumbersome and
confused as its title.
  At least those films had artistic pretensions, misguided
though they might have been. The cheap ``Tarzan and the Lost City,''
which comes to us through the courtesy of something called Village
Roadshow Pictures, is pure cheese - and it stinks like Limburger.
  ``Lost City'' offers as Tarzan the chiseled Casper Van Dien,
who proves again as he did in ``Starship Troopers'' he's less a
leading man than a leading mannequin. Any expression beyond a sullen
pout seems to take an extraordinary amount of concentration and
physical exertion on Van Dien's part; his infrequent attempts at
smiles are the stuff nightmares are made of.
  Jane March, best known for proving she's allergic to
clothing of any kind in ``The Lover'' and ``Color of Night,'' plays
Jane as a prissy crab.  Early in the film, Tarzan - shortly before his
scheduled wedding to Jane - has a vision that causes him to
contemplate leaving his new residence in England to make a brief
return to Africa. Jane practically bursts her corset: ``This wedding
will proceed as planned, or not at all!'' she screeches.  ``Go back to
your jungle!''
  Ever the obedient one, Tarzan scurries home, just in time to
find a band of fortune-seekers ransacking the old neighborhood in
search of the key to the lost city of Opar. Since everyone who's ever
looked for Opar has wound up dead, it's conceivable that Tarzan could
have simply waited for the villains to meet their maker. But that
wouldn't have made for a very long movie, so Tarzan attempts to thwart
their quest himself, with the help of a contrite Jane and some of the
phoniest-looking apes since ``Congo.''
  ``Tarzan and the Lost City'' serves up with a straight face
the kinds of scenes ``George of the Jungle'' lampooned, complete with
an egotistical villain (Steve Waddington) who bears an eerie
resemblance to James Cameron, and scores of politically incorrect
natives who jabber lines like ``No animal talk like that! May be
demon!'' and are helpless without Tarzan's protection.
  The photography is washed-out and grimy throughout, and the
visual effects are downright appalling, particularly a giant cobra
that guards the gates of Opar. The fabled ``lost city'' looks like
it's made of carelessly painted plywood and cardboard.
  The only curiosity in ``Tarzan and the Lost City'' stems
from Tarzan's wardrobe choices: He often wears an unbuttoned,
long-sleeved white shirt with his traditional loincloth. Perhaps this
is a conscious choice by the filmmakers to show us the hero's divided
loyalties between civilization and the jungle. Or perhaps Van Dien had
some unsightly acne on his back and needed something to cover it
up. The world may never know.

Cast: Casper Van Dien, Jane March, Steven Waddingham
Director: Carl Schenkel
Producers: Stanley Canter, Dieter Geissler, Michael Lake
Screenplay: Baynard Johnson and J. Anderson Black based on the 
      "Tarzan" stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs
Cinematography: Paul Gilpin
Music: Christopher Franke
U.S. Distributor: Warner Brothers
     This is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate Disney's live-
action GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE.  TARZAN AND THE LOST CITY, the latest 
attempt to bring Edgar Rice Burrough's legendary hero to the big screen, 
is one of the most inept and ill-timed of any Tarzan adventure so far.  
Badly conceived and poorly executed, TARZAN AND THE LOST CITY appears 
headed for a quick trip to video store shelves.  I have no idea why the 
producers chose now to bring back Tarzan; it's not as if there are 
legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie.  Furthermore, it's 
even more curious that this film is rated PG, which, by definition, 
rules out any sex or explicit violence.  And, while I'm not advocating 
the excesses embraced by the 1981 Bo Derek version of the story, Tarzan 
deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the 
embarrassing production.
     Of course, no tweaking of the content to change the rating could 
have saved TARZAN AND THE LOST CITY, since the film's troubles 
originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the 
line.  Imagine GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE stripped of all (intentional) humor, 
and you have a fair idea of what this TARZAN is like.  With its 
uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences, the film barely 
registers a pulse.  Anyone in search of a relatively entertaining, 
family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of THE JUNGLE 
BOOK, which uses the same basic elements to much better effect.  The 
only worthwhile element of TARZAN AND THE LOST CITY is the pretty 
scenery (which, unfortunately, includes the two lead actors).
     The film doesn't attempt to re-tell the origin story  the thinking 
is that it has been done often enough.  Instead, TARZAN AND THE LOST 
CITY introduces us to Lord Graystoke a.k.a. John Clayton a.k.a. Tarzan 
the Ape Man (Casper Van Dien) several days before his marriage to Lady 
Jane Porter (Jane March).  He is living happily in England, enjoying the 
benefits of being a land-owning noble.  Meanwhile, in central Africa, 
the dastardly Nigel Ravens (Steven Waddington), a self-proclaimed 
scholar and explorer, believes he has found the way to the lost city of 
Opar, which he calls the cradle of civilization.  On the way there, he 
and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things, like burning 
native villages, to earn the wrath of the locals.  One shaman, 
determined to stop Ravens from unearthing Opal, sends a mystical message 
to Tarzan for help.  With Lady Jane following close behind, he returns 
to the jungle where he was born.
     Its patently obvious that Casper Van Dien (one of the pretty-boy 
heroes of STARSHIP TROOPERS) was not hired on the basis of his acting 
ability.  With his plastic facial expressions, monotone voice, and 
complete inability to make convincing animal noises, his range rivals 
that of Steven Seagal.  His pecs, however, are impressive, and director 
Carl Schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them 
off.  Jane March, on the other hand, has to keep her shirt on, which may 
be a first for her.  Some six years ago, March give a solid performance 
in Jean Jacques Annaud's steamy THE LOVER.  Since then, she made the 
career-killing decision of appearing opposite Bruce Willis in THE COLOR 
OF NIGHT, which exploited her every acting defiency.  TARZAN continues 
this trend.  March may be attractive, but, at least judging by this 
performance, she can't act.  Meanwhile, Steven Waddington has serious 
trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad 
guy.  Instead, he turns out to be little more than a nuisance.
     The story line is pure formula, which has largely been true 
throughout the years for almost all of the TARZAN movies.  The problem 
is that this one seems so childish and lifeless.  The romantic elements 
are all contrived  in fact, Lady Jane's presence is necessary only so 
she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance.  The 
special effects are truly bottom-of-the-barrel (including some laughably 
bad men in ape costumes  apparently, animatronics were too expensive 
for this production).  And, of course, as with all jungle movies, there 
are the obligatory cute animals.
     Over the years, the legend of Tarzan has been one of the most 
popular sources for film series material.  The most famous Ape Man was 
Johnny Weismuller, but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed 
the part (including Gordon Scott, who is widely believed to be the best 
actor to tackle the role).  Weismuller made 12 Tarzan features; Van Dien 
will probably fall 11 short of that number.  And, having seen TARZAN AND 
THE LOST CITY, I would argue that the movie-going public would have been 
well served if he had missed by 12.

Though technically a sequel to Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Tarzan
and the Lost City boasts none of the same cast, and even less quality.
It's a difficult task to make a Tarzan movie on the heels of the
successful George of the Jungle, one that Tarzan and the Lost City just
isn't quite up to.
The action picks up with Tarzan (Casper Van Dien) in London, about to
come into his inheritance as Lord Greystoke, and preparing to wed the
lovely Jane (Jane March).  However,  his bliss is interrupted by a
mystical vision from his homeland which sends him (and Jane) packing
back to Africa.
An evil poacher, Nigel Ravens (Steven Waddington), is on a quest.
Certain artifacts (which he has plundered from the corpses of dead
tribal chieftains...during their funerals, no less) point him to the
lost city of Opar, the cradle of civilization. Tarzan is asked by an old
friend, the tribal shaman Mugambi (Winston Ntshona), to prevent Ravens
from reaching (and plundering) his goal.
One of the many problems that plague this movie is in this summons.
Mugambi is given such godlike magical powers (from shapeshifting to even
resurrection) that it is unlikely that he'd need the assistance of
anyone so comparatively pathetic as Tarzan!  Why doesn't he simply wave
his magical hands and make those mean ol' poachers disappear?
Ahh...but then, this wouldn't be a Tarzan movie.  (And I suppose a
Mugambi movie is a tougher sell.)  But, on the other hand, Van Dien
doesn't make a particularly convincing Tarzan.  True, he does have the
Tarzan yell...but it sounds canned, as if someone had tape recorded a
clip from the old movies.  Van Dien merely places his hands by his mouth
and the sound appears.
But then that's par for the course in a film filled with shoddy special
effects.  It's hard to imagine a giant snake that's even more
fake-looking than the one in Anaconda, but somehow this film succeeds.
But then, it looks right at home among the hideous gorilla suits,
styrofoam boulders, and Power Ranger-quality magical warriors.
Tarzan and the Lost City was a film released with little fanfare, and
deserves to remain that way.  Tarzan devotees would be better served by
waiting at least until next year's Tarzan cartoon by Disney, and leaving
this one to the wild.

Rapulana Seiphemo
The only two really good things that I can say about Tarzan And The Lost
City are as follows: Jane March was very cute as Jane, and the movie was
thankfully under 90 minutes in length. If you haven't already figured it
out, I didn't like this movie very much.
The plot was boring and contrived to the extreme. Tarzan (Casper Van Dien)
has now left the jungle and living in civilized society. He is just days
away from his impending marriage to Jane, played by the aptly named Jane
March. Back in his former home of Africa, a group of looters has found the
key to locating a lost city. (Mind you I never really figured out why they
actually wanted to find this city.) Anyway, Tarzan's old jungle friend
appears to him in a vision. Tarzan realizes that he must return to Africa to
help stop the bad guys from finding the lost city. He leaves Jane (his first
mistake, in my opinion) and travels to Africa. Of course, Jane is hot on her
ape man's heals. The two of them are reunited in Africa where they do battle
with the bad guys. Sound like a dumb explanation of the plot? It's actually
an improvement over the real thing.
The acting is just plain awful. I'm not quite sure what Casper Van Dien was
doing in this film, but it wasn't acting. Jane March wasn't a heck of a lot
better, but at least she is easy on the eyes. Compounding the bad acting was
the fact that in many places the dialogue had obviously been re-recorded,
and I've seen better dubbing in some old Bruce Lee movies. Added to the
sound problems was the cinematography. This film was filled with beautiful
African scenery. But the panoramic scenery shots looked overexposed to me.
Quite frankly, I think you could probably do a better job capturing the
beauty of Africa with a camcorder than this bunch did with professional film
equipment.
Then we have the special effects. "Special effects in a Tarzan movie?" you
are no doubt asking yourself? Yes friends, the writers injected some very
out of place supernatural elements into the story. Probably for the sake of
using CGI, since it did nothing but hurt the story. In most parts, they
weren't bad, just nothing special. But, they were more than a little on the
hokey side. Except of course, when we got to the ridiculous climax of this
movie. The grand finale's special effects went right into the toilet at that
point. It almost looked like they had run out of money. These effects were
of noticeably lower quality than those in the rest of the film and looked
like something in an amateur video production.
I took one lesson away from watching Tarzan And The Lost city -- ape men and
bones that morph into skeletal warriors don't mix. Stay far away from this
version of Tarzan.

Cast: Casper Van Dien, Jane March, Steven Waddingham

stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs
I'm not sure how people usually like their heroes, but when it comes to
Tarzan, I usually picture a man's man. I don't mean size, cause Casper
Van Dien (STARSHIP TROOPERS) doesn't come small by any means, he's just
too petulant a schoolboy to be the brooding, dark Lord of Greystoke.
Having said that, Casper can't act, and even his growling, chimpanzee
noises and jungle call comes a little mediocre when compared to last
years summer hit GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE  a far superior movie by my
accounts. Little things that don't help are the poor quality of the
script ie when Tarzan tells Jane: I taught myself to read' ???? Also,
Tarzan's ape brethren look like men in monkey suits flying through the
trees. This made me laugh, but doesn't help with the poor credibility of
costume design.
Lots of unfavourable comparisons can about this movie to the early
Weissmuller films, Tarzan the series or even GREYSTOKE: THE LEGEND OF
TARZAN  which I believe to be the best dramatic version to date. This
movie tries to bring back the adventure and fun of the 1940 films, but
that is another time and place, where Tarzan (Weissmuller) retained a
lot of his mystery by grunting and saying very little  and rightly so,
considering he was raised in the jungle. Casper Van Dien has too much
too say and looks like he's on a Contiki-fun-adventure-holiday in
Africa! Jane (Jane March) on the other hand, is sweet but very plain and
flat chested. However, the major criticism is not her chest, but the
fact she lacks any spark and charisma to be a viable jungle man love
interest. When both Jane and Tarzan are boring', then you have a major
problem on your hands.
As for the Lost City of Opah, it looks someone has torn a picture of a
pyramid out of a National Geographic Journal, and very cleverly computer
pasted into the movie. The ending makes little sense, and comes as
suddenly and unexplainable as a bolt of lightning striking the bad guy
dead. Don't bother asking why, it's just because. As for Tarzan and
Jane, I don't think there will be a sequel, at least not if Casper Van
Dien is staring in it.

One review of 1994's Sylvester Stallone-Sharon Stone actioner The
Specialist called that superstar team-up "the acting equivalent of the
Hindenburg meeting the Titanic."  If that's the case, then the pairing of
hack-tors Casper Van Dien (Teen Beat-ready block of meat from Starship
Troopers) and Jane March (last seen delivering what should have been a
career-ending performance as three characters in the atrocious Color of
Night) is the acting equivalent of armageddon meeting the end of the
universe.  In this horribly conceived and executed update of Edgar Rice
Burroughs's classic character, the King of the Jungle (Van Dien) returns to
his African homeland to prevent some treasure hunters from finding the
sacred lost city of Opar; following him to the jungle is his loyal fiancee
Jane (March, thankfully keeping her clothes on for a change).
Tarzan and the Lost City, directed by Carl Schenkel, is the latest in
what's becoming a most unwelcome annual cinematic tradition--the horrid
jungle adventure (the most recent entrants being last year's Anaconda and
1995's unspeakable Congo).  There are lousy, sub-Lost in Space effects;
cheap gorilla suits; flat-out atrocious performances (Van Dien's
barely-there, why-the-hell-even-bother attempt at a British accent makes
Kevin Costner look like Meryl Streep); and, worst of all, a lack of genuine
thrills.  Tarzan swings on vines and everything else, but there's nothing
exciting about anything, certainly not the boring, anti-climactic "climax"
in a pyramid.  The audience of ten with whom I saw the film got the most
amusement from Van Dien's hilariously delivered animal noises and sloppily
dubbed Tarzan call.  If this is truly, as the Warner Bros. publicity
machine stated, "A new Tarzan for a new generation," then everyone falling
into the Generation X category should be incredibly offended.  I know I am.

TARZAN AND THE LOST CITY (1998) *  Directed by Carl Schenkel; written by
Bayard Johnson and J. Anderson Black, based on the "Tarzan" stories created
by Edgar Rice Burroughs .Photography, Paul Gilpin . Production design,
Herbert Pinter. Editing, Harry Hitner. Music by Christopher Franke.
Produced by Stanley Canter, Dieter Geissler and Michael Lake. Cast: Casper
Van Dien (Tarzan), Jane March (Jane),  Steven Waddington (Nigel Ravens). A
Warners release. 105 minutes. PG.
Statistics differ and are unreliable. Still, the champion fictional
character in movies is Sherlock Holmes, with about 200 films, followed by
Dracula (ca.150), and the Frankenstein monster (ca.100). Figures for
Tarzan, though most confusing, probably exceed 100 if the count includes
parodies, oddities and the many productions made in India.
The original "Tarzan of the Apes" (1918) was Elmo Lincoln  (born Otto Elmo
Linkenhelt,1899-1952) who went on to more T-movies, then to just bit parts.
The first major  sound-era Tarzan --and still the most popular --was
Johnny Weissmuller (Peter John Weissmuller, 1904-1984)). Both men were
Americans (Indiana-born Lincoln's first profession was as an Arkansas
cop).Weissmuller was born in Pennsylvania --although one source  says it
was in Rumania, near Timisoara, and from parents of Hungarian nationality.
It is said that he was a sickly boy who took up swimming on the advice of a
doctor. He studied at the  University of Chicago, became Olympic swimming
champion (5 gold medals) at the 1924 and 1928 games, held a profusion of
world records and had already acted before he made his first T-movie,
"Tarzan, the Ape Man" (1932). It was a big hit, and,to this day remains one
of the best Tarzan films.
Tarzanophiles rate the 1934  sequel "Tarzan and his Mate," with Weissmuller
and Maureen O'Sullivan, as the premier Tarzan movie. A recent re-viewing on
AMC confirms this judgment. The film is vibrant. Some of the special
effects may be transparent, but several others are quite sophisticated and
others yet, impressive even today: such as the mutliple prides of lions and
the face-offs between explorers and beasts. And of course there's the
lovely, initiative-taking O'Sullivan, as a sexy and thinking Jane. She is
glimpsed more than once in the buff, something unusual in those days of
restrictions by the Hollywood Code.
I believe, though not all critics do, that the summit of screen Tarzanism
came with he 1984
"Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes." It was revisionist,
perhaps even post-modernist, humanistic, ecological, sociological, touching
and  technically a tour-de-force.
Enough of prolegomena. In the just-released "Tarzan and the Lost City,"
John Clayton, Lord Greystoke (a.k.a. Tarzan) is in 1913 Suffolk, about to
wed Jane, when he is sent by telepathy a vision, a cry for help by his
never-forgotten African friends. He takes the first boat to Africa.
The natives are the victims of depredations,violence and murder in the
hands of merciless whites led by Nigel Ravens. Ravens, though just vaguely
shown as a scientist-explorer-mercenary,is clearly a  vile, shifty-eyed
plunderer who will do anything for riches, from capturing animals to
killing humans for precious stones or gold. His ultimate aim is to find the
lost city of Opar with its legendary treasures.
After a six-week voyage, Greystoke is in Central Africa (shot in South
Africa). Soon after, Jane surprises him by showing up. She carries a nice
wardrobe and her brother's pistol. Much smooching ensues. It will continue
punctuating the action, which is politically correct as the blacks are
good,the Europeans bad, save for a friend of Tarzan's who, of course, has
to die.
The adventures that follow totally lack credibility, even by Tarzanian or
cartoon standards. Minor examples: Tarzan breaks in two a heavy rifle on
his knee; poisoned by a snake, he lies unconscious, is covered by a huge
swarm of bees, recovers magically; he takes Jane to their old tree-house
where they dance the Blue Danube Waltz played on an intact phonograph.The
record is scratchy, then swells into DTS multi-stereo. The bad 'uns get a
machine-gun but miss the couple, while pistol-packing Jane hits
bull's-eyes, among the other abundant bull in the story. When trekking with
the baddies, as their captive, she suddenly appears with a fresh, clean
blouse. Etc.
The film is muddled, incoherent in writing, editing. continuity and
staging, heavy-handed in every way. And the characters talk at the other
characters, not to them.
With the discovery of Opar, which is like a Mayan pyramid, dumbness
skyrockets. Anything arbitrary or preposterous goes. The tale switches
gears into magic. Special effects take over. Morphing reigns: statues into
drum-beating automatons, statues into warriors, bones into warriors (and
vice-versa), something into a colossal cobra, the movie's audience into
somnambulists.
Casper Van Dien (Tarzan) is an American whose main claim to fame was in
"Starship Troopers";   Brit Jane March (Jane) debuted in Jean-Jacques
Annaud's "The Lover," her only good film to date. Van Dien is homo sapiens
pectoralis. March is toothsome, and then some. Considered from any point of
view, "TLC" is a messy pot-pourri whose only  interest is  some beautiful
vistas and many impressively painted tribesmen. The initials TLC could have
also stood for Tender Loving Care, but there's none of it lavished on the
movie.
