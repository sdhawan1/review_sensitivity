PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Some of the creepiest psychological studies of the last few years have
come from Scandinavia.  Bloody Angels tries to duplicate the eeriness of
its Norwegian predecessors, Insomnia and Junk Mail.  Though those shoes
may be tough to fill, Angels is still a bitter disappointment.
Angels takes place in a tiny rural town where, several months prior to
the film's opening, a young girl with Down's syndrome was brutally raped
and murdered (shades of Paradise Lost?).  The townsfolk believe that the
killers are the two oldest sons of the most despised family in the bleak
burg and, as the film opens, one of the alleged attackers is found dead
in an icy river.  His accomplice brother is missing, but nobody in the
town will own up to the obvious retaliation.
Enter an Oslo detective named Nicholas Ramm (Reidar Sřrensen), an old
friend of the stymied local sheriff.  Ramm gives new meaning to the term
`no-nonsense cop,' instantly butting heads with the locals, who insist
that they saw `bloody angels' descend from heaven and do the deed.
Hoping to unravel the mystery, Ramm befriends the tormented younger
brother of the suspects (Gaute Skjegstad), which makes everybody in town
hate him even more.  Is it really heavenly intervention, or mob
justice?  Duh  what do you think?
The directorial debut of Karin Julsrud, Angels isn't totally wasted.
The music is downright hair-raising and the cinematography is great,
creating a drab, washed-out look.  The weak story (Finn Gjerdrum and
Kjetil Indregard) by is the real problem here, and the ending should be
particularly predictable to anyone that has seen a Pearl Jam video.
1:40 not yet rated, but includes violence, rape, sexual content and
adult language
