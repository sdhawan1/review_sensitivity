This collection of operatic arias as interpreted by nine different 
directors (ten if you count Bill Bryden's linking story) was producer 
Don Boyd's personal project.  He was understandably anxious about its 
reception but should have realized that only the idea behind his film 
can be deemed a success or a failure - as a work itself, it is so 
diverse in nature that it can only be evaluated piecemeal: it becomes 
just as interesting an exercise in criticism as it is in film-making.
To summarize: Nicolas Roeg's segment replays an obscure moment in 
European history and comes of as nothing much more than a curiosity; 
Charles Sturridge's images of children trapped in an adult world 
complement the numinous aria accompanying them; Godard is just as 
irritating as ever, though he at least should be commended for proving 
that a professional piece of film can be created with a minimal 
production crew; Bruce Beresford's contribution, in which virtually 
nothing happens, is probably the most disposable entry; Julien Temple 
choreographs a bedroom farce to Verdi's 'Rigoletto'; Robert Altman, in a 
moment of pure perversity, shows us not the theatrical event but the 
audience watching that event (the joke wears thin pretty quickly); Franc 
Roddam expertly transplants the doomed lovers Tristan and Isolde into 
contemporary Las Vegas; Ken Russell takes us into a mystical mindscape; 
and Derek Jarman's clip is so generic that almost any piece of pop music 
could be dubbed onto it to much the same effect.
To view Boyd's project as a whole, we must really locate where its 
different directors agree about the essence of opera.  In this instance, 
it's pretty straightforward - sex and death.  It's also fun to see where 
they differ, in any number of binary choices: e.g., popular arias versus 
the esoteric; the adherence to or departure from the context of the 
original libretto; the refusal or indulgence of directorial trademarks 
(to this end, we can see evidence of Jarman's music videos and 8mm film 
paste-ups, Roeg's use of wife Theresa Russell, Godard's use of 
intertitles and soundtrack jumpcuts).  Surprisingly, it is from the two 
least expected sources, Sturridge and Roddam, that the potential of 
Boyd's concept is best realized - their sequences are as evocative and 
emotive as we would hope for.  But it is Ken Russell, who has always 
been adept at this sort of thing, where ARIA really coalesces in terms 
of concept, visuals, and music.  To say more would spoil it for you.  
Film is unlikely to produce imitators, so it may well remain one of a 
kind.  Sumptuous photography and superb music make it ideal theatrical 
fare.

     This film isn't going to be widely realeased, and that's too bad.  It's
rated X, or rated such that "No one under 17 will be admitted," and this is the
kind of film that rated X was meant for.  Stuff like GRENDEL DOES THE GREEN BAY
PACKERS should have its own rating.
     ARIA is ten, loosely linked segments, each with a different director and a
different musical score.  Verdi, Puccini, and Wagner are in there a lot.
Almost all of the segments are shot on location, from a weightlifting room in
Paris to the Madonna Motel in San Luis Obispo, California.  Each segment is the
director's interpretation of an opera piece.
     Some of the segments are *really* fantastic.  The "Tristan and Isolde"
starts with a young couple driving through an Arizon desertscape into Las
Vegas, and it's simply beautiful.  They drive down the strip, we see the old
ladies at the slot machines, the odd people on the street, the wedding chapels,
and the motel room.
     In Jean-Luc Godard's segment, two young cleaning women in a Paris gym are
ignored by muscle-bound Narcissuses.  It's *hilarious*.
     The idea behind the whole thing -- show modern people what opera felt like
to the contemporaries of the composers -- is really executed well.  Usually, I
hate opera; for once, I loved it.
     Released nationally, but mostly in artsy places like the Varsity in Palo
Alto, CA.  +3 on the -4 to 4 scale.

     Book publishing has the concept of the "original anthology."  Several
well-known authors are given a theme to write on and each does a short story
bringing an original approach to that theme.  Occasionally a similar
approach is tried in anthology films, having a different director for each
segment, but usually what is done seems to be to give the director a script
and let him direct it.  Films like QUARTET, TRIO, ENCORE (all based on
collections of W. Somerset Maugham stories), O. HENRY'S FULL HOUSE, and DEAD
OF NIGHT were probably done this way.  ARIA appears to be a film that gave
its directors even more autonomy.  In this anthology film, the only thing
that the segments have in common is that each is an interpretation of an
operatic aria.  As long as the aria is played through the film, it seems to
fulfill the requirements.
     It would be misleading to try to rate such a mixed bag of short films
as a single piece.  Instead I will consider each segment.  Even there I want
to give each piece two ratings, one on how it stands on its own as a film
and a second rating on how well it used the music it was interpreting.
(Ratings are on the -4 to +4 scale.)
Opera: UN BALLO IN MASCHERA (A MASKED BALL) by Giuseppe Verdi
Director: Nicholas Roeg
     The opening piece (but for a framing piece that will be described
later) involves an assassination attempt on King Zog of Albania.  The
attractive and versatile Teresa Russell (BLACK WIDOW) has finally been given
a role that she is totally unconvincing in.  Sporting a handlebar mustache
and wearing a tight military tunic, she plays King Zog.  Only afterwards did
I find out that it was she in the role, but it was obviously an actress
rather than an actor.  Nor did the punchline of the story work.  Story: 0.
Appropriateness: +1.
Opera: LA FORZA DEL DESTINO (THE FORCE OF DESTINY) by Giuseppe Verdi
Director: Charles Sturridge
     I did not care for this segment on first brush, but on discussing it
later I see more quality in it.  Sturridge shows us troubled children
leading a pointless existence of TV-watching and getting into trouble.  The
original aria is a plea to the Virgin Mary which may well be appropriate.
Story: +1.  Appropriateness: +1.
     Two attractive female attendants in a gym for body-builders first
desire the powerful masculine bodies around them, then try to seduce them,
only to be frustrated and ignored by the dehumanized athletes around them.
The section is amusing and perhaps even erotic.  Story: +1.
Appropriateness: -1.
     Seemingly out of place we have one Blake-Edwards-style sex farce.  A
husband and wife cheating on each other both go with their lovers to the
same garish motel.  The common tension builds as husband and wife nearly run
into each other time and again.  Will they run into each other?  Do we
really care?  Mindless but amusing.  Story: +1.  Appropriateness: 0.
Opera: DIE TOTE STADT (THE DEAD CITY) by Erick Korngold
Director: Bruce Beresford
     Because I read the program I know what the director of BREAKER MORANT
and CRIMES OF THE HEART was trying to say with this film, but it does not
come from the film.  According to the program, it has a man falling "in love
with what he believes to be the spirit of his dead wife."  It appears to be
just two lovers and scenes of an atmospheric (and apparently empty) old
European city.  Story: 0.  Appropriateness: +1.
     One would expect a good segment from a director as distinguished as
Robert Altman.  Surprise!  This is the biggest loser in the lot.  It is
dull, but worse than that, it is borrowed from a much better film,
MARAT/SADE.  Both films deal with the historical fact that in post-
Revolutionary France it was though chic to involve the inmates of insane
asylums in theatrical productions.  In MARAT/SADE the insane put on a play
and rich patrons come to see it; in Altman's the insane come to see an
opera.  In both the mad are uncontrollable, which is one reason the rich
want to watch them.  But in MARAT/SADE the monkeyshines are only a tiny
piece of all that is going on on the screen.  They are all that happens in
Altman's section of ARIA.  Story: -1.  Appropriateness: -1.
     I was not fond of Roddam's films THE BRIDE and QUADROPHENIA, but I have
to give him the prize for ARIA.  This had to be what the people who thought
of the film had in mind.  This is a very sensual adaptation of Wagner's
"Liebestod" that in some ways fits the music as well or better than Wagner
did originally.  Story: +1.  Appropriateness: +3.
     I lucked out on this one--I did not read the program.  There is a nice
surprise in this segment, but the program ruins it by telling too much.  The
story is of a princess of some sort being decorated by having diamonds and
rubies inlaid directly into her flesh.  But even as we watch it, more is
going on than we realize.  Don't read the program.  Story: +1.
Appropriateness: +1.
     An old woman dressed incongruously in the clothes of a much younger
person remembers days gone by.  This one squeaks by, passable but no great
shakes.  Story: 0.  Appropriateness: 0.
     If Bryden was trying to say something with his framing sequence of John
Hurt preparing for and singing PAGLIACCI, it went right past me.  Not very
unusual.  This was not up to most of the segments it framed.  Story: -1.
Appropriateness: +1.
