AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME (M).  
(New Line Cinema/Village Roadshow)
Director: Jay Roach
Stars: Mike Myers, Heather Graham, Michael York, Robert Wagner, Seth
Green, Mindy Sterling, Verne Troyer, Rob Lowe, Gia Carides, Elizabeth
Hurley, Will Ferrell, Burt Bacharach, Elivs Costello, Willie Nelson,
Tim Robbins, Jerry Springer, Kristen Johnston, Charles Napier, Woody
Harrelson, Rebecca Romjin Stamos, Muse Watson, Clint Howard.
Groovy, baby!  Mike Myers returns as Austin Powers, the over
sexed, impossibly hirsute, yellow toothed and sartorially challenged
'60's super spy, in this hilarious and thoroughly enjoyable spoof of
the whole canon of '60's spy films.  Incredibly, this shagadelic
sequel is much better than the first film, which failed to amuse or
impress some audiences.  The Spy Who Shagged Me takes the basic
formula of the original and inverts it.  However, there are less
wasted opportunities here.
Co-writers Myers and Michael McCullers (who honed his satiric
talents writing for Saturday Night Live for many years) take the
familiar clichés and memorable moments of the Bond films and savage
them mercilessly.  Film buffs will also recognise lively spoofs of
other '60's spies, like Matt Helm and The Avengers, in the broad mix.
Whereas the first film saw the cryogenically frozen Powers
unleashed on the late 1990's, this sequel sees him return to London in
the swinging '60's.  Dr Evil also ventures back in time, accompanied
by his pint sized clone Mini-Me (Verne Troyer).  Dr Evil has hatched a
dastardly plot to steal the frozen Powers' mojo (his libido, his life
force), thus thwarting the spy's efforts to stop his plan for world
domination.  To defeat Dr Evil's plan to blackmail the world with a
high tech laser planted on the moon, Powers teams up with beautiful,
sexy and extremely capable CIA agent Felicity Shagwell ("Shagwell by
name, shag very well by reputation"), played with enthusiasm by
Heather Graham (from Boogie Nights, etc).
There is a distinct lack of subtlety here, and many of its
targets are obvious.  The very busy and wildly inventive plot includes
lots of corny special effects and is liberally sprinkled with clever
pop cultural references.  Somehow it all works a treat under Jay
Roach's proficient direction.  He maintains a cracking pace, and there
are few flat moments in this non stop barrage of bad taste jokes.  The
film is chock full of the sort of puerile humour, smutty jokes and
cheap double entendres that make the Carry On films look
sophisticated.  Nonetheless it will be enthusiastically lapped up by
adolescent schoolboys everywhere.
Everyone from the original film returns for the sequel,
although Elizabeth Hurley's character is despatched very early in the
piece.  While Myers is sometimes a little irritating as the heroic and
narcissistic Powers, he is marvellous as Dr Evil, the pinkie-sucking,
Blofeld-like villain of the piece.  Buried under a mountain of
prosthetics, Myers is virtually unrecognisable in a third role as the
grotesque and aptly named Fat Bastard, one of Evil's agents, who
steals Powers' mojo.
Mindy Sterling is wonderfully abrasive and funny as Frau
Farbissina, while Rob Lowe does a marvellous job of impersonating
Robert Wagner as a younger version of Dr Evil's loyal and taciturn
lieutenant, Number Two.  Seth Green is droll as Evil's test tube son
Scott, who continually points out the ludicrousness of his father's
plans.  Burt Bacharach, Elvis Costello, Woody Harrelson, Willie
Nelson, Tim Robbins and talk show host Jerry Springer are along for
the ride with wonderful cameos.  Everyone involved looks like they
were having a smashing time, and their infectious enthusiasm soon rubs
off on the audience.
If nothing else, the whole exercise is also another chance to
crank up a soundtrack of great '60's rock classics!
The Spy Who Shagged Me knocked the over hyped and
disappointing The Phantom Menace off the top of the US box office.
That it will likely repeat that feat here gives heart that audiences
still prefer films with human characters and a bit of style over
computer generated visual effects.  May the farce be with you!

FILM REVIEW: Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999)
Austin Powers has gone mainstream. The original Austin Powers: International
Man of Mystery came from nowhere. Saturday Night Live alum Mike Myers
gambled with a quirky concept and a ridiculous character and won. It is one
of the funniest movies of the decade and has become an instant classic. In
contrast, a monstrous marketing campaign and unavoidable hype preceded
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. Suddenly, white bread top-40 radio
announcers and cheesy TV morning show hosts are making reference to
Powerisms such as "groovy, baby" and "shagadelic." Myers' unlikely cult hero
is pasted on billboards, bus stop signs, and on magazine ads everywhere.
Unfortunately, while The Spy Who Shagged Me is packed with laughs, it is a
far less clever and satisfying than the original.
The Spy Who Shagged Me starts where the first film left off, with Powers and
his new bride, Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley), on their honeymoon.
Without spoiling the start of the film, I'll only say that things don't work
out well for the newlyweds, and very quickly, Powers is back in action and
single again. And it's not a minute too soon, because Dr. Evil is also back,
scheming once again to dominate the globe. He is joined this time by a
temperamental miniature clone of himself, "Mini-Me." Dr. Evil hatches a new
world-domination plot centered around eliminating Powers' interference by
going back in time and "stealing his Mojo" while also setting up a powerful
laser on the moon. Powers follows Dr. Evil back to the sixties, and, with
the help of a gorgeous CIA agent, Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham), tries
to once more thwart Dr. Evil's diabolical schemes.
Mike Myers' performance is once again brilliant as both lead roles. His
comic timing, facial expressions, and willingness to do anything for a laugh
set him alongside Jim Carrey one of the funniest entertainers today. Graham,
sadly, is a disappointment. Unlike Hurley, Graham doesn't complement Myers
very well. As Vanessa Kensington, Hurley provided a contrast and a challenge
to Powers, while Shagwell is just a good-looking bimbo who wants to sleep
with Powers. She has some good lines, but they are all just snappy come-ons
instead of clever exchanges. Graham looks great in Bond-girl outfits, but
they gave her Bond-girl airiness as well.
And yet, unlike the original Austin Powers, Myers' physical comedy and wacky
characters drive The Spy Who Shagged Me, without the support of a decent
story. The Spy Who Shagged Me abandons the fundamental premise of the
original  that Austin Powers, and his arch-nemesis, Dr. Evil, were fish out
of water, 1960s characters thrust into the vastly different world of the
late 1990s. Much of the humor in the original Austin Powers film came from
Dr. Evil and Austin Powers' struggles to adjust to today's attitudes and
realities. In place of a decent story, The Spy Who Shagged Me substitutes
juvenile bathroom humor. As if to try and out-do There's Something About
Mary, this film has more than its share of bathroom humor  a shame, since
the original was funnier without anywhere near as many junior-high gags.
Without the conflict of Powers not fitting in, the feel of the film shifts.
Whereas the recurring joke in the first film was that Powers was an
unattractive, ridiculously dressed, hairy pervert who was hopelessly
out-of-date, in The Spy Who Shagged Me, he has become fashionable,
irresistible to women, and in-tune with the times. Taking Powers and Evil
back to the 1960s doesn't add much to the story. Except for the outfits and
cars, most of the plot and story would have worked fine in the present day.
Still, while imperfect, The Spy Who Shagged Me is a lot of fun. It's worth
the ticket price just to see the opening credit sequence (words can't do it
justice), Dr. Evil's appearance on the Jerry Springer show, and any of Dr.
Evil's tirades against his "not-evil-enough" son, Scott Evil (Seth Green).
Also, the film does well by not taking itself too seriously. In one scene,
as Powers prepares to go back in time to stop Dr. Evil, he begins asking the
Chief of British Intelligence, Basil Exposition (Michael York), about the
paradoxes and implications of his impact on the flow of time if he goes back
to the sixties. York tells Powers not to worry about it and just "do what
you always do: have a good time," then turns to the camera and says to the
audience, "and that goes for you too!" Myers looks at the camera as well and
nods in agreement.
The Spy Who Shagged Me offers a lot of laughs, but the film feels more like
a long string of skits and memorable lines rather than a complete movie. It'
s an enjoyable romp, but a far cry from its classic predecessor.

 Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999) 2 stars out of 4. Starring
Mike Myers, Mike Myers, Mike Myers, Heather Graham and Michael York.
 Austin Powers is back, bad teeth, elephantine libido and all. And like in
the original, Mike Myers has stretched a one-joke premise to the breaking
point.
 "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" is more of a series of sketches
and shtick, rather than a cohesive, follow-the-plot feature.
 I mean, how can it be anything else considering Myers' free-flow imagination.
 No, what "The Spy Who Shagged Me" is really is a Valentine to the 1960s
and the spy melodramas that proliferated during that era. The super-stud,
super-agents such as Bond and Flint who could kill a man with one hand
while caressing a woman with the other.
 Those who loved the first Austin Powers movie will undoubtedly enjoy this
sequel, which is basically more of the same. Those who felt the original
movie was stupid and childish are advised that they are taking their
chances here.
 For like the original, the humor in "The Spy Who Shagged Me" is that kind
of juvenile, smuttiness, double-entendre jokiness we all thought was so
cool in junior high school.
 The premise of "The Spy Who Shagged Me" is quite simple. Austin Powers'
nemesis, Dr. Evil (also Myers), travels back to 1969 and steals Powers'
mojo - his libidinous life force. The theft doesn't seem to incapacitate
our hero, or even slow him down. It merely keeps him from bedding luscious
CIA agent Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham), while Dr. Evil tries to carry
out his nefarious plan to extort millions from the nations of the world.
 The movie does have some funny bits: Dr. Evil trying to reconcile with his
estranged son, Scott, on "The Jerry Springer Show"; a romantic sidewalk
interlude during which Austin and Felicity dance to "I'll Never Fall in
Love Again," as played by Burt Bacharach and sung by Elvis Costello; and
most of all two very well-edited sequences in which people around the world
see Dr. Evil's spaceship - which has a very distinctive shape - and
continually use phallic euphemisms and slang to call attention to it.
 Graham is deliciously funny as Shagwell, entering the spirit of the
enterprise with a twinkle in her eyes and a smile on her lips.
 Myers, of course, is becoming a master at the knowing nod, the mischievous
pause that lets the audience know that he, too, is in on the joke, whether
he is portraying Austin Powers or Dr. Evil.
 However most of the tomfoolery that comes between the sequences seems like
empty filler.
 Even the introduction of some new characters, including Mini-Me, a
diminutive double of Dr. Evil, and Fat Bastard, a one-ton slovenly killer
Scot, also portrayed by Myers, cannot cover the cracks in silly going-ons.
 Myers and co-screenwriter Michael McCullers constantly walk the edge of
bad taste, but skirt it with a wink and a smile.
 "The Spy Who Shagged Me," honestly, is a movie no one in their right mind
can take seriously. It is a spoof, a parody, but its flaw is that it
continually meanders around trying to cram in too many affectionate riffs
about the 1960s.
 A little more discipline and a lot less scatology and sex jokes would have
made for a better - and funnier - picture.

I confess I have not see the original "Austin Powers" film and after seeing
this monotonous, joyless sequel, I can't say I am overjoyed at the prospect.
That is not to say that this is a bad film - there are moments of great black
humor - but it is too long, disjointed, gross, and silly to make me want to get
involved in any future Austin Powers adventures.
The film starts off well with hairy-chested, 60's reject Austin (Mike Myers)
having a romp in the hay with a beautiful Elizabeth Hurley. It turns out she is
a Fem-Robot and fires bullets from her nipples!!! Then we are treated to a
hysterical, off-the-wall dance number with Austin's derriere serving as the
butt of jokes, no pun intended. Then there is the mysterious Dr. Evil (Mike
Myers, again) who is soft-spoken and fights with a Klu-Klux Klan member at a
Jerry Springer show. His dastardly plans are to go back in time to the 1960's
and steal Austin's mojo - his forceful sexual prowess in liquid form! Why Dr.
Evil wants it, and plans on destroying Washington, D.C. with a death ray from a
"Death Star," I am not sure.    
Austin's shenanigans with the beautiful and sexy spy Felicity Shagwell (Heather
Graham) make up for some of the film's dead spots. There is an uncomfortably
unfunny Scottish henchman named Fat Bastard (an unrecognizable Mike Myers) who
smells and humps and thumps like a Tyrannosaurus Rex. The joke involving his
feces is as grossly underimagined as you might think, but this character
quickly grows tiresome and has none of the spark of Myer's Scottish father in
the underrated "So I Married an Axe Murderer." 
Heather Graham seems to have been on a slump since her success with "Boogie
Nights," and here she is bland and seemingly unfit for the crazy universe she
is in. She looks bored each time she shares a scene with Austin. When Graham
dulls my senses in a movie, you know you are in cinematic trouble. 
"Austin Powers" works best when Dr. Evil appears and his counterpart, Mini-Me,
and thus I enjoyed their conference scenes. I also liked Seth Green as Dr.
Evil's spoiled son, and it is a pleasure to see a cameo of Tim Robbins as the
President of the United States. But Myers unfolds his bag of tricks and jokes
prematurely and his one-note persona ("Crazy, baby, yeah" or "Shall we shag?")
grows repetitious. I was ready to say to Austin, "Zip it." Save for some
brilliantly funny gags and one-liners, "Austin Powers" is too dependable on his
mojo to really work.

This summer, Austin Powers may pass Elvis Presley as the world's record
holder for Most Bad Impersonations Inspired. The next time you have to
endure a woeful `You're shagedelic, Baby!' on an answering machine, you're
free to hate him for it.
But let's be mature about this, shall we? Let's learn to separate the
messiah from the fools who invoke his name. `Austin Powers: The Spy Who
Shagged Me,' the second big-screen adventure of the horse-teethed Carnaby
Street clown, is a howling good time, no matter how grating you may find
the promotional hype. However poorly Mike Myers's nutty creation comes off
on TV or magazine covers, the movie is a kaleidoscope of madcap brilliance
where the star is not Austin, but Austin's insanely conceived world.
`The Spy Who Shagged Me' is fundamentally a cascade of gags, many of them
puerile and delightfully disgusting and the rest saucy send-ups of
pop-culture clichés. In the long history of `Saturday Night Live' alums
elevated to movie-star status, Myers is, in fact, one of the few (the
only?) still doing `SNL'-style schtick, deftly adapting it to the
feature-film format and brazenly appealing to his audience's smarts and its
weakness for a well-executed poop joke.
Playing three of the film's central characters and having co-written the
script with `SNL' pal Michael McCullers, Myers is in full control of the
Austin Powers persona. With the help of fun-loving director Jay Roach (who
directed the original `Austin Powers'), Myers creates a set that captures
the lightning-in-a-bottle feel of inspired improvised comedy. The result is
an endless parade of sight gags, in-jokes, dopey sexual humor and wildly
depraved -- but never over-the-top -- satire. For every joke that doesn't
quite gel, there are four or five gems and one or two that are
wet-your-pants funny. That makes for a pretty good batting average.
When we last left Austin, he had landed the beautiful and highly shaggable
Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley). The new film opens with the couple's
honeymoon which, for reasons best left under wraps, ends up with Austin a
suddenly single swinger again. In no time, however, the International Man
of Mystery is in the clutches of another stunning babe. 
CIA agent Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham, in a star-making turn) -- the
kind of gun-toting, Jaguar-driving, miniskirt-wearing sex kitten that only
exists in the imaginations of 16-year-olds with extensive Playboy
collections -- pops up to help Austin battle the notorious Dr. Evil (Myers
again). The bald and effete Dr. Evil (who we first meet on the set of the
Jerry Springer Show) hires a monstrously obese Scotsman named Fat Bastard
(Myers yet again) to travel back in time to 1969 to extract Austin's `mojo'
while Austin is cryogenically frozen. As a result, Austin tragically loses
his libido at the moment of passion with a vamping Russian fashion model
named (ha, ha) Ivana Humpalot (Kristen Johnston of `Third Rock from the
Sun').
To recover the lead in his pencil, Austin himself goes back to 1969 and
there is a great sense of infectious fun in Austin's scenes at the center
of London's swingin' go-go scene, where he in fact he meets foxy Felicity,
who almost immediately also wants a piece of Austin's power.
Curiously, Austin Powers is not the catalyst for the movie's best humor.
That honor belongs to the persnickety, pinkie-kissing Dr. Evil, a cackling
bad guy with world-domination fantasies who has to deal with some
hilariously contemporary problems: a disaffected teenage son and the
awkwardness of a sudden sexual encounter with a co-worker. Disappointed by
his sarcastic slacker son Scott, Evil creates a companion in his own
likeness, a dwarf with the same bald head, gray suit and black heart he
touchingly christens Mini-Me (Verne Troyer). Scott hates the little guy,
Fat Bastard wants to eat him, but he brings out devoted love from the mad
scientist who is taken to blurting out to his Mini-Me things like `You
complete me' (smile, you `Jerry Maguire' fans).
As a piece of short-attention-span comedy, `The Spy Who Shagged Me' pays
attention to detail. The delights comes in diverse forms from unexpected
cameos from the likes of Elvis Costello, Tim Robbins, Woody Harrelson and
Burt Bacharach (a veteran of the first movie) to pointed spoofs of rap
videos to the casting of Rob Lowe as villanous, one-eyed Robert Wagner's
younger self to a series of deliciously dumb gags revolving around the
synonyms for the male organ (high-brow it ain't). The main satirical
scaffolding is, of course, the James Bond series. Bond fans will recognize
a number of sly references to Bond films but 007 is only one of dozens of
cultural allusions that will reward inveterate TV, pop music and movie
hounds. Even product placement, skewered so well in Myers's pre-Austin hit
`Wayne's World,' gets zinged. Starbucks, for instance, must have mixed
feelings that one of its franchises serves as Dr. Evil's world-domination
headquarters.
Unlike another, much-hyped summer blockbuster (you hear me talking, Jar
Jar?), `The Spy Who Shagged Me' lives up to its billing. It's less a
cohesive story that a series of set pieces, each explosive in comic
potential. To take one example, the scene of Myers as Fat Bastard, cocooned
in realistic-looking latex fat lying naked in bed drooling and eating
chicken while the lovely Felicity looks on in acute disgust is the kind of
pungency that makes this movie such a devilish treat. By mixing arch
pop-cult references with goofy, sexy fun and tossing in a handful of
expertly drawn bodily-function vulgarities, Mike Myers has created a movie
valentine to the under-30 crowd. Bow to Austin Powers, for he is the
learned Doctor of Scatology. Smashing, baby. Simply smashing.

Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.
When the original Austin Powers was released in cinemas around three years
ago, the screening I attended had about five people in total watching the
film. The Spy Who Shagged Me, (TSWME) the inevitable sequel, had about
thirty times that figure, a testament to Austin's video popularity. The hip
spy from the sixties returns to celluloid in this colourful, largely funny
sequel to 'International Man of Mystery.' Mike Myers plays the titular
Austin Powers, now living in the nineties with Vanessa Kensington.
Unfortunately, Austin's mojo is stolen by the evil Doctor Evil (Myers
again). Austin must return to the sixties to regain his mojo from the evil
doctor, and must also stop Dr. Evil from blowing up the earth with a large
"laser." He teams up with sexy CIA agent Felicity Shagwell (Graham) and sets
off on his rather silly quest.
Mike Myers always seems to be lazy when making a sequel, usually by
recycling jokes from the original film to a less funnier extent. That
problem occasionally rears it's ugly head here: for example, the dancing
interludes don't seem nearly as funny as the original film, and barely raise
a laugh. However, although rather hit and miss, TSWME has enough laughs to
keep the film running until it decides to end just before it runs out of
steam. The cast, largely made up by Myers who plays three roles, is
energetic and fun. Robert Wagner repeats his brief part from the original
movie, before being replaced by Rob Lowe, who basically plays Robert Wagner
rather well. Mindy Sterling is fun as the German scarebag Frau Farbissina,
and Seth Green returns as Dr. Evils estranged son Scott. Heather Graham is
only slightly disappointing as Felicity, although this is largely to do with
the fact that her character is intensely shallow, little more than a sex
object. She looks great, but is more than a little empty. Finally, Verne
Troyer is rather good as Dr. Evils smaller clone, Mini-Me, although the
character is largely wasted until a funny fight between him and Austin near
the end of the movie.
The gags are largely good, stand outs include a funny tent gag, and a funny
performance of 'Just the Two of Us.' The film seems to have benefited from a
larger budget, with a much sharper, funnier look than the first film. It all
looks like a large set however, and clearly not filmed much in England (as
Austin points out.) The plot is full of inconsistencies, but Myers and Co.
desperately try to cover this up by telling the audience to 'go with it,'
which seems like a cop out. Vanessa Kensington's fate, for example, is badly
handled and then thrown away.
But although the set pieces are funny and some of the one-liners sharp,
there are some parts of TSWSM that just don't work. 'Fat Bastard,' a
Scottish assassin who weighs a metric ton, is largely unfunny, although he
gets one of the best lines near the end of the movie. Mini-Me is never fully
used. Austin is also curiously underused, and Dr. Evil gets far more screen
time. This is largely a good thing however, as Dr. Evil is much funnier than
Austin Powers, which is a bit odd seeing as Austin is meant to be the star.
But all the gags are delivered with a likeable charm, so even the ones that
don't work can get a smirk. There are some dead bits, but the belly laughs
that follow usually compensate. The film also delves into toilet humour far
more often than it's predecessor, and this gags aren't as funny or original
as the rest of the films jokes.
Overall, TSWSM is short and sweet enough to be good for some light comic
relief. It will keep you laughing, and Mike Myers charm practically flows
from the screen. There's enough effort to make this film work, and it is a
worthy enough successor to the already cult movie. It won't get you
thinking, but Austin Powers will certainly get you laughing.

For once I can't tell you how a movie BEGINS because it would be a spoiler. 
Suffice to say that if, like me, you saw Heather Graham in the trailer for "The
Spy Who Shagged" Me and wondered, "Hey, what happened to Austin's wife?," your
question will be answered.
What I can say is that Dr. Evil (Mike Myers) returns to earth and hatches a
plan to neutralize his nemesis, unfrozen 60's superspy Austin Powers (also
Myers).  Evil goes back in time to 1969 and has henchman Fat Bastard (Myers
again, getting a chance to use his Scottish accent) steal the mojo from the
frozen Austin.  Along the way, Dr. Evil also decides to set up a giant laser on
the moon to destroy the earth.  (No, he doesn't have a reason-just run with
it.)  Mojoless, Austin follows Dr. Evil to 1969 and teams up with CIA agent
Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham) to foil Evil's scheme.
As Austin tries to contemplate the paradoxes of time travel, he exclaims, "I'm
going all cross-eyed!"  His boss, Basil Exposition (Michael York), cautions
Austin to not worry about it and just have fun.  Then Basil looks at the camera
and says, "That goes for you all, too."  Good advice.  The various plot twists,
cameos, and gags won't hold up under any scrutiny-but it's great fun.
Even more so than the original "Austin Powers, The Spy Who Shagged Me" is
intentionally dumb but making a dumb movie on purpose is harder than it looks. 
(Check out any of the recent work by Leslie Nielsen or Mel Brooks, if you don't
believe me.)  Even though the jokes are juvenile (expect farts, penis-shaped
rockets, and Austin drinking a stool sample), the timing is skillful.  Most of
all, Myers manages to make both Austin and Dr. Evil believable enough to accept
as characters and stupid enough to laugh at.  (On the other hand, Fat Bastard
is just gross.  I haven't been this disgusted by a character since Pizza the
Hut in "Spaceballs").
Dr. Evil is a much funnier character than Austin, and the bad guy gets more
screen time in this outing.  His posse is back:  Number Two (played by both
Robert Wagner and Rob Lowe), Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling), and Scott Evil
(Seth Green).  They're joined by a miniature clone of Dr. Evil, Mini-Me (Verne
Troyer), who generates more than half of the laughs in the movie.  I thought
Scott's running commentary on his father's stupid plans was the funniest thing
in the first "Austin", and I'm glad that it continues in the sequel.  (There's
a hilarious scene early in "Spy" where Scott and Dr. Evil go on "Jerry
Springer."  Topic:  "My Dad is Evil and He Wants to Take Over the World").
There's cameos aplenty (many of them in the wrong decade).  As themselves: 
Springer, Burt Bacharach, Elvis Costello, Woody Harrelson, and Willie Nelson. 
Kristen Johnston (from "Third Rock") plays a Russian assassin, Ivana Humpalot. 
Tim Robbins (one of the last people I expected to see in this movie) plays the
president in '69.  Elizabeth Hurley (Vanessa Kensington Powers) and Will
Ferrell (Mustafa) briefly reprise their roles from "Austin Powers,
International Man of Mystery."  I hoped that Mimi Rogers would turn up as well,
but we can't have everything.
Speaking of the previous Powers, you'll enjoy "The Spy Who Shagged Me" more if
you've seen "Austin Powers" recently.  And the first ten minutes will make a
lot more sense.
A brief digression:  Now that "The Spy Who Shagged Me" has joined the ranks of
sequels that measure up to their progenitors, an unbreakable law of film
physics requires that the next movie in the series be a disappointment. 
Really, every time a sequel is as good as or better than the previous film in
the series, it is followed by a third movie that is a bore.  Consider these
fine sequels:  "Superman II," "The Empire Strikes Back," "Star Trek II: The
Wrath of Khan" (in fact, the "even-number rule" of "Trek" movies-only the
even-numbered ones are good-is the best proof of this unbreakable law), "The
Karate Kid Part II," "Lethal Weapon 2," "Back to the Future Part II," "The
Godfather Part II."  All good sequels, all followed by disappointing third
parts.  Can anyone think of an exception to the rule?

Tired of the sophomoric humor Virgin Inc. has been pumping into their Austin
Powers/ Virgin Airlines radio ads, I expected the same from this film.
Fortunately, my fears of a buck-toothed drooling grin ra-ta-tatting juvenile
"Shag-isms" the entire length of a feature film were ill-conceived. Now,
that doesn't mean that Austin Powers is my hero or that he refrained
completely from driving his "Shaguar." It does mean that I didn't hate the
picture. In fact, "The Spy Who Shagged Me" is a strong "B" film for any
adult with an open-minded funny bone and probably a laugh-a-minute-riot cult
film for high school freshmen.
If you haven't figured it out yet ... "Shag" is euphemistic British slang
for making love. The writers miss no opportunity for making copulation puns,
going so far as fastening two large spheres (fuel tanks?) to the base of Dr.
Evil's Rocket Ship. Get the point?
Austin Powers (Mike Myers) is a James Bond spoof frozen in '69 and thawed
out in the nineties. In this episode, he must again stop the sinister dolt,
Dr. Evil (also Mike Myers) from destroying the planet. Dr. Evil, planning to
zap Washington D.C. with a "laser" based on the moon, fears foiling from
agent Powers. In hopes of diffusing our hero, Dr. Evil sends a cohort back
in time to steal Austin's "Mojo" (you know, his life force, suave, charisma,
the essence of his mystique). The Mojo-less Powers whimpers, "I used to be
so virile, now I'm nothing."
Like "Laugh in" or "Hee-Haw" almost charming in its relentless silliness,
"Shagged" sports 2 or 3 genuinely hilarious sequences which bump it up from
a "B" to a "B+." First, a tent-shadow scene in which lover, Felicity
Shagwell, appears to be emptying Powers' bowels of everything from
explosives to a sporting equipment. Secondly, there's a stream of quick cuts
connecting the sentences of unrelated characters trying to find just the
right word to describe the phallic image of Dr. Evil's Rocket in the sky. Al
so, you'll no doubt enjoy the cameos of good-humored celeb's.
Powers' famous catch phrases ("Oh, Behave" etc.) were plainly unfunny, but
"Shagged" had plenty other foolish jokes to tell. Overall, actor Mike Myers
did an absolutely smashing job with this light-weight script while playing
three roles to boot. Lastly, great costuming and makeup on his third
character deserve mention as do the props far exceeding those of Dr. Who.
(Btw, If you stay till the end of the credits, there's a little something --
a very little something.)

AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth
        Austin Powers has lost his mojo all right.  And so, unfortunately,
has Mike Myers.
        In this much-anticipated follow-up to 1997's "Austin Powers:
International Man of Mystery," Myers and his co-conspirators have missed a
wonderful opportunity to improve upon the original film and given us
instead a wildly uneven romp which misses about twice as much as it hits.
        The dark forces in "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" draw
consistently bigger laughs than the swinging secret agent and his latest
shag-pad material, CIA operative Felicity Shagwell (a stunningly awful
Heather Graham).
        Dr. Evil (Myers) is back, hysterically so, as is his right-hand
woman, the Rosa Klebb-styled Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling, still having
a blast).  They're joined by Dr. Evil's delinquent son (Seth Green, also
terrific) and an obese Scot with the catchy moniker of Fat Bastard.  Played
by Myers under what seems to be three metric tonnes of makeup and
prosthetics, Fat Bastard is a repulsive cross between Monty Python's Mr.
Creosote (from "The Meaning of Life") and Charlie MacKenzie's father in "So
I Married an Axe Murderer."  Myers has the accent down perfectly and his
Fat Bastard is a welcome, if gross, addition to the film's eccentric roster
of villains.
        Also in tow in "The Spy Who Shagged Me" is a one-eighth-the-size
version of Dr. Evil.  "I shall call him  Mini Me."
Mini Me (played by Verne Troyer) is another brainstorm; too bad they
couldn't have come up with a kitten-sized version of Mr. Bigglesworth.  And
last but not least there's Rob Lowe as the young Number Two, who does a
better Robert Wagner than Robert Wagner.
        Whenever the bad guys are on screen, especially Dr. Evil, the film
is a hoot.  One of the film's funniest lines comes when Dr. Evil is going
through his "zip it" routine with his son Scott.  But the writers don't do
anything with Austin except to land him with the great-looking but
hopelessly-afloat Graham.  A brief but satisfying appearance by the
original film's Elizabeth Hurley only reinforces just how bad Graham is.
        Austin flashes his bad teeth and growls "groovy baby, yeah!" but
his character is becoming very repetitive and Myers himself doesn't seem to
know how to extend his creation.  So the film settles for a lot of
unwelcome bathroom and bodily orifice humor.  And I mean a lot.  Austin
Powers accidentally mistaking a stool sample for coffee?  Felicity
"retrieving" things from Austin on all-fours in silhouette?  You have to
believe that Myers and his co-writer Michael McCullers can do better, much
better, than that.
        "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" has some terrific sight
gags, several outrageously funny product placements, a bunch of inspired
cameo performances (Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello *not* included), a
cleverly-edited sequence in which various people comment on the phallic
nature of Dr. Evil's spaceship, and a wonderful throng of evildoers who ham
it up at every possible opportunity.
        But for those of us who expect a little more from the extremely
talented Mike Myers, the psychedelic love machine in his Carnaby Street
duds is--at least for the time being--all shagged out.

AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME
Reviewed by Jamie Peck
This inspired silliness carries into and throughout the entire film, which
finds '60s nemeses Austin Powers (Myers), the swinging sleuth with a
ghastly Shirley Partridge-'do and ghastlier Nehru jackets, and Dr. Evil
(Myers again), the wicked mastermind with a kooky affinity for his
hairless kitty and kookier plans for world domination, again clashing in
the '90s. Evil's nonsensical schemes involve using time-travel to steal
Powers' mojo (or, for those not in the know, his libido), though in the
funnier self-referential bits, Myers and Co. draw attention to plot holes
and suggest that overlooking them is in full enjoyment's best interest.
But do people really care if the story adds up? Far more pressing matters
involve whether or not Myers, both as scribe and performer, is at his
cheekiest. The answer -- a strong "don't worry" -- comes long before he
debuts yet a third role, that of a slobbering, Scottish Dr. Evil henchman
called Fat Bastard. Giving life to this loathsome brute enables Myers to
not only hide under what looks like a ton of latex, it permits the kind of
kilts-and-haggis humor he mined so effectively in "So I Married an Axe
Murderer." He'd be guilty of spotlight-hogging were he not so dead-on in
all three parts, each of which could probably occupy their own farce
alone.
Like Myers' hats, the film fuses cast members old and new. Showing up from
the former "Austin" are familiar favorites such as Number Two (Robert
Wagner), Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling) and Scott Evil (Seth Green).
Misunderstood Scott, the bad Dr.'s son, partakes in clashes with dad that
are utterly priceless, leading the elder Evil to instead play
father-figure to his 28-inch-tall clone (Verne Troyer), a malevolent
munchkin he affectionately dubs Mini-Me. This "Island of Dr.
Moreau"-inspired character gets used and abused frequently, reaffirming
how "Spy" shuns political-correctness in its search for a quick giggle
fix. But the jokes are never offensive, even if they spend a majority of
the time in and around the toilet.
As with all spoofs, misfires occur -- how not original to cut to an
erupting volcano following suggested sexual activity -- and every single
punchline doesn't quite hit a home run; "The Spy Who Shagged Me" has a
tendency to drag a few shenanigans out to the point of overkill, though
that's less of a stumbling block here than it was for its predecessor
(remember the interminable urination bit?). One area done better by the
previous installment, however, would be the female lead: Elizabeth Hurley
brought her an appealing mix of sensuality and sportsmanship. Hurley gets
explained away in a nifty prologue, thus opening the door for Heather
Graham, who looks fetching in mesh but seems out-of-sync with the groovy
goings-on.
No matter. With Myers, Mini-Me and more delightfully gag-worthy gags than
"There's Something About Mary" -- a naughty shadow show and a coffee
pitcher full of feces blow low and lower -- these flaws hardly register.
"Austin" 1 did about $50 million at the box-office and then found an
audience of avid devotees upon its video release. With those folks now
foaming at the mouth over the prospect of future films, "Austin" 2 is
practically guaranteed to destroy the notion of diminishing returns. In
fact, from the wit, love and craft on display here, another "Austin"
adventure promises to generate the same solid hype and eager anticipation.
"Goldswinger," anyone?

"Do you smoke after sex?" the voluptuous Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth
Hurley) asks her new husband, Austin Powers (Mike Myers).  "I don't
know," he replies with his boyish grin.  "I've never looked."
Yes, that "International Man of Mystery" is back.  This time, in AUSTIN
POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME, he goes back to England in the Swinging
Sixties to recover his mojo.  Can't be a world-famous playboy if your
mojo is not working.  Even a huge clump of chest hair two inches thick
isn't enough to wow the women if your mojo is missing.
In a hilarious opening sequence, Austin discovers that his television
remote control, including the fast forward, mute and alternate language
selection buttons, command his new wife.  Once again Myers, who shares
the writing credits with Michael McCullers, has clearly put enormous
thought and effort into the design of every sight gag and every snippet
of dialog in the movie.
The first AUSTIN POWERS film was a bit too cluttered and hurried, as if
Myers wanted to pack it with every joke imaginable.  This second one
goes down a bit easier since it is the more relaxed and good-natured of
the two.  This time Myers seems more confident of his abilities so he
gives his picture more room to breathe.
The good-spirited movie has great fun ripping off a host of other
pictures, especially Bond films.  The names of the characters, ŕ la
Bond, are a particularly enjoyable source of mirth.  A Russian sexpot
named Ivana Humpalot (Kristen Johnston) engages Austin in an erotic game
of chess.  Another character's name is Robin Swallows, but her maiden
name was Spits.  You can probably guess where the writers go with that.
Full of self-deprecating humor, the movie is never happier than when it
is making fun of itself.  One drive, supposedly in England but clearly
filmed in the hills above Los Angeles, has a sign proclaiming "English
Countryside."  Austin remarks that Southern California doesn't look
anything at all like England.
And if you're tired of all those ridiculously blatant product
placements, the movie parodies the most hyped company in the movies
today, Starbucks.  One of the scenes, spoofing a typical council chamber
scene from STAR WARS, is set in a huge space needle with a hundred-foot
high Starbucks sign on the outside.
The plot has Austin's nemesis, Dr. Evil, going back to 1969 to steal
Austin's mojo, which renders him powerless in the present.  Austin goes
back to recover his mojo.  The plot is actually more complicated than
this, and Austin makes fun of its logical flaws.
Myers also plays Dr. Evil, as well as a couple of other hard to spot
roles.  Dr. Evil clones himself into a miniature version of himself
called Mini-Me (Verne Troyer).  At one-eighth Dr. Evil's size and
looking and acting exactly like him, Mini-Me is treated as a cross
between a loyal dog and a favorite son.
In the present, Robert Wagner repeats his role as Number 2.  In the
past, Rob Lowe gives a dead-on performance as the Young Number 2.  Lowe,
in an uncanny performance, looks and acts so much like Wagner that one
could be convinced that they were father and son in real life.
The best part of the casting is the addition of Heather Graham (BOOGIE
NIGHTS) as CIA operative Felicity Shagwell.  As Austin's fellow spy, she
provides a playfulness and an innocence that lightens up the story,
which has a tendency to go too much over the top.  The sexual chemistry
between the two leads is delicious and genuine.  (Without giving too
much away, let's just say that Austin spends most of the picture as a
bachelor.)
The dialog has little gems of wit.  After a one-night fling, Dr. Evil
expresses some regret the next morning.  "I can't let my feelings for
you interfere with my taking over the world," he admonishes his
paramour.  Other lines make little sense but Myers delivers them so
confidently, they work anyway.  ("He's the snake to my mongoose," Dr.
Evil says of Austin, and then admits that it might be the other way
around.)
Some of the best bits in the film are visual.  Austin and Heather are
shown in silhouette inside a tent.  She appears to be doing unspeakable
things to his body.  The camera periodically cuts to the inside of the
tent so we can see that nothing unnatural is happening.  Even knowing
how the joke is performed doesn't diminish its humor or keep you from
squirming as you watch.
With energetic music, including such old favorites as "American Woman,"
and with intricately planned comedy, this latest AUSTIN POWERS should
delight the fans of the original as well as attract new ones.  This time
the sequel is better than its predecessor.
AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME runs 1:33.  It is rated PG-13 for
sexual innuendo and crude humor and would be fine for kids around 11 or
12 and up.

*** (out of 4) Austin fans, THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME is funnier and better
than the first movie!
Actually, I should say that I found the first movie to be mediocre. The
concept was good and some jokes and scenes worked great, but the film
itself fell apart because of all the dry spells between gags. Those
spells were filled with observations on the late sixties, slavishly
worked-in spy movie references, and plot. 
This one is much funnier because it borrows the successful elements from
the first and shuns what didn't work. That means more jokes, lower-brow
humor, more of that handsome Dr. Evil, and less plot. Mike Myers wrote
the first film, and this time he was joined by newcomer Michael
McCullers. Together, they seem to have worked out the kinks.
The film opens with Austin Powers (Mike Myers) leading the easy life
with his wife Vanessa (Elizabeth Hurley) now that the evil Dr. Evil
(Mike Myers) has been vanquished. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Powers, Dr.
Evil has been thawing and plotting his revenge. Dr. Evil acquires a time
machine and goes back in time to steal Austin Powers' mojo.
Later, when Austin Powers... ahh, to heck with the plot summary. You
will not care about, much less notice, the plot. There is just enough to
keep the action moving and the jokes rolling in, and that's all that
matters, isn't it?
A comedy that makes me laugh out loud comes along once, maybe twice a
year, and SHAGGED is one of them. The near-nudity gags from the original
are repeated and expanded upon, and a new verbal gag using synonyms for
"penis" is introduced (told you it was low-brow). Actually, both had my
audience (okay, I admit, me too) laughing out loud. If there is a third
Austin Powers movies, you can bet both gags will resurface. 
Most importantly, Dr. Evil gets a lot more screen time than in the first
movie. He steals the show as he works out his paternal feelings both for
his son (Seth Green) and for his 1/8 size clone, Mini-Me (Verne Troyer).
Dr. Evil and Mini-Me get the biggest, best-deserved laughs.
I would certainly recommend this movie (especially if you have an
adolescent streak in you). As with most comedies, I would also recommend
seeing it in a big crowd. The fuller the theater, the funnier the jokes.
But a few tell-tale signs indicate that it may not be destined for the
next AFI top 100 list.
First is the caliber of the jokes. A few too many are grossout jokes.
Myers plays a third character, Fat Bastard, an agent of Dr. Evil's.
Myers wears a fat suit like the one made for Eddie Murphy in THE NUTTY
PROFESSOR. Naturally, since this is a comedy, we find out entirely too
much about Bastard's digestive system. As repulsed as I was, I have to
admit I laughed. But I don't know if I'll be renting this movie when I
have polite company over.
Second is the repetition of the jokes. Many of the funniest gags are
repeated. Luckily, the latest round is always just a little funnier than
the first round, but really, they're the same gag, and if you didn't
like it the first time, you'll just hate it the second time.
And finally, there are some references to Star Wars that play very well
right now because we are swamped by "Phantom Menace" pool toys and
galactic-mint Star Wars toothpaste. But in time, the Star Wars jokes
won't be quite so biting as they are now. Comedy that relies on parody
and reference (like a lot of Zucker Brothers movies) is extremely chancy
and very dated.
Based on these points, I would recommend seeing SHAGGED sooner rather
than later. I think the longer the movie has been around, the less funny
it will seem.
Now don't get me wrong. I'm not panning SHAGGED. I actually had a lot of
fun. But I do feel it's necessary to temper my praise with a dose of
reality.
But having hedged my review, let me close by saying that AUSTIN POWER:
THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME is a very funny movie, and is one of the few
sequels to surpass its predecessor.

_Austin_Powers:_The_Spy_Who_Shagged_Me_ (PG-13) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
_Austin_Powers_ is one pop culture phenomenon that has flown clear over
my head.  The shagadelic spy's first screen outing, 1997's
_International_Man_of_Mystery_--whose box office grosses topped out at
just north of $50 million, yet became a sensation on video--was
definitely a likable, high-energy affair, but for me, that wasn't enough
to redeem a script whose hit-and-miss stabs at humor were more amusingly
silly than genuinely hilarious.  The bigger, though not necessarily
better, sequel, _The_Spy_Who_Shagged_Me_, doesn't pretend to be anything
more than it is--more of the same.  Whether or not that's a good thing,
however, depends on who you are: fans of the original are indeed likely
to find this installment to be groovy (as did the rowdy fans at my
screening), but for me, it was another scattershot adventure with a few
good chuckles but not quite as funny as it believes it is--or should be.
One of the key problems I had with the original film was that about
three-quarters of the way through, the schtick of Austin Powers (Mike
Myers) was exhausted.  He's a defrosted British secret agent still stuck
in the swinging '60s who is perpetually up for a shag and believes
himself to be irresistibly sexy.  That's it.  By the time he performed
his climactic striptease to "I Touch Myself," I wasn't laughing but
silently grinning, if even that.
After _The_Spy_Who_Shagged_Me_ gets past a brief prologue that writes
off the love interest of the previous film, Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth
Hurley), the film dives headlong into an elaborate credit sequence:
Austin prances through a hotel in the buff (with strategically placed
props, natch), culminating in an Esther Williams-style aquatic production
number.  Once this is all over, Austin is, to borrow one of his catch
phrases, "spent"--creatively speaking.  It's not so much that Myers,
co-writer Michael McCullers, and returning director Jay Roach do nothing
new with Austin in terms of story (again, he must thwart the
magalomaniacal Dr. Evil, who has travelled back in time to 1969 to steal
Austin's "mojo") than in terms of his thin character.  Austin's "Yeah,
baby!" one-liners, retro wardrobe, bad teeth, and swinging attitude--all
mined for their entire worth and then some in
_International_Man_of_Mystery_--haven't gotten better, just older.  Even
the diehards in the audience got bored; after Austin's umpteenth scene
transition dance number, one once-howling fan was overheard saying, "That
was stupid."
For me, Austin's archnemesis, the idiotic, hopelessly square, but no
less dastardly Dr. Evil (also played by Myers) was always more
interesting.  Surprisingly, _The_Spy_Who_Shagged_Me_ focuses more on him
than it does Austin, and the film benefits from that fact.  Unlike their
laissez-faire treatment of Austin, Myers and company have actually taken
Dr. Evil in a fresh direction.  In the first film, Dr. Evil's antiquated
'60s sensibilities clashed with those of the '90s; in this one, the
opposite is the case, with his new pseudo-hip, ultra '90s mentality a
jarring anachronism in 1969.  It sounds less than inspired in concept,
but in execuation it fuels the film's best moments, most of which involve
his new midget clone Mini-Me (Verne J. Troyer), whom a doting Dr. Evil
prefers to his black sheep biological son Scott (Seth Green, also
returning).
The rest of the film is a study in give and take.  Heather Graham cuts a
shagadelic figure as Austin's new sidekick/love interest, CIA agent
Felicity Shagwell, but Hurley's icy hauteur in the first film made for a
more effective foil.  As enjoyable as the bulk of Mini-Me's antics are,
his knock-down, drag-out fight with Austin is a less effective retread of
the MTV Movie Award-winning Ben Stiller-Puffy the Dog confrontation in
_There's_Something_About_Mary_.  Rob Lowe does an even better Robert
Wagner than Wagner himself as the '60s incarnation of Dr. Evil's yes-man
Number Two (Wagner also briefly reprises his role as the '90s Number
Two), but he is underutilized.
As with the original film, my just-OK assessment of
_Austin_Powers:_The_Spy_Who_Shagged_Me_ is sure to be in the minority,
and the film's certain success will cement _Austin_Powers_ as a New Line
franchise.  And as lukewarm as my take on these first two films are, I'd
welcome a third--that is, if there can somehow be an _Austin_Powers_ film
without Austin himself.

Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me 
A review by Stephen Sills
Rated PG-13 (sickeningly gross humor, mild language)
I will not deny the fact that Mike Meyers is a gifted, perhaps even brilliant
comedian. Nor will I deny the fact that "The Spy Who Shagged Me" is a
frequently humorous, occasionally hilarious film. Yes, this is a funny movie,
but it's also a very sick, demented one. There are some images in this film
that you'd have to pay me to see again.
According to the "Star Wars"-ish crawl that starts the movie off, Austin (Mike
Meyers) has defeated his arch nemesis, Dr. Evil (also played by Meyers) and has
since married his love interest, Vanessa (Elizabeth Hurley). 
We cut to the couple's honeymoon sweet. Vanessa turns out to be a robotic agent
of Dr. Evil and nearly kills Austin with her breast-mounted machine guns.
Austin barely escapes, lamenting the loss of his wife until he realizes that
he's a bachelor again. His pain is further alleviated by an assignment that
involves lingerie photo shoot. True to form, he winds up in bed with one of the
models.
In the meantime, Dr. Evil resurfaces and hatches a truly nefarious scheme.
Utilizing a time machine, he plans to travel to the 60s and steal Austin's mojo
(his libido) from his still-frozen persona. Evil successfully completes the
time travel procedure and sends Fat Bastard (also played by Meyers), a
gargantuan Scotsman, to do the job. Unfortunately for our hero and his sexual
partner, Fat Bastard succeeds, thus rendering Austin infertile right in the
middle of his sexual encounter.
Fortunately, the British Government has also developed a time travel device,
and so they send Austin back in time to save his mojo. 
Once there, Austin meets up with Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham), a sexy
American spy. Together, they discover an even worse scheme: Evil, with the
accompaniment of Fat Bastard and a pint-sized version of himself, Mini-Me
(Verne Troyer), has placed a powerful laser gun on the moon, and will decimate
Washington unless he is paid one hundred billion dollars by the U.S.
Government. Austin and Felicity must travel to the moon to thwart Evil and
recover Austin's mojo.
Like I said earlier, this movie is truly hilarious at times. A scene that takes
place on "Jerry Springer," for example, is one of the funniest things that I've
seen in a long time. Dr. Evil is great, and Mini-Me is surprisingly likable in
a weird sort of way.
The Austin Powers character is also a wonderful invention and is played to
perfection by Meyers. He's a James Bond type with a tenth of the charisma and
twice the sex drive, and yet he comes over with childlike innocence. It's
hilarious to see Austin, with his frazzled hair, horrid teeth, unseemly
features, and over-the-top accent make women swoon with lines like "Do I make
you horny, baby? Do I?" 
Fat Bastard didn't do much for me, though. Like so many other things in this
movie, he was little more than obscenely gross. The same can be said for about
half of this movie's attempts at humor. Joke after joke elicited an almost
vomiturition reaction from me. The most notable is a scene where Austin
mistakes Fat Bastards feces for coffee. It was so gross that I came close to
leaving the theater.
In the end, your enjoyment of "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" will
depend exclusively on your tolerance level for sick humor. Personally, I have a
finely drawn line for such things, and this movie passed it frequently. If you
can stand a lot of the stuff, you'll love it. If not, you'd be best advised to
stay away.

The new Austin Powers film continues a movie tradition begun in the
eighties.   Produce something, anything, that will get the high school and
junior high kids in the theater because they
buy more soda and popcorn than senior citizens.  The usual hallmarks of this
filmmaking tradition are all here.  Gross humor, sex jokes, silly sight
gags, more sex jokes.   And the film is a strong contender in the current
race to be cruder, grosser and more outrageous than that last film.    What
the film is not, however, is funny.
The plot centers around the return of Dr.Evil, who goes back in time
to steal Austin Powers' mojo (a liquid with red stuff in it extracted from
Austin's pelvis) which gives Austin his
sexual prowess and the charisma to defeat his enemies.
Austin must go after him, and returns to the swinging sixties
where free love and sexy secret agents had their heyday.
I almost avoided this film because I did not like the original.   But
the films premise sounded like an excellent comic vehicle and the film
received many good reviews.  I wish I had stuck to my first impression.
Myers is trying to be the Jerry Lewis of this generation.   And he
has the talent to do it, at least as an actor.  But the material he is
working with here, much of it his own, falls short of anything resembling
comic genius.  This movie tries to carry the day with sight gags about
drinking distilled feces, a five-hundred-pound fat man's butt crack, and a
barrage of sex jokes
aimed at the level of the average 15 year old.  After some of these scenes,
one has to wonder how gross the next generation of films will have to go to
get an audiences attention.
The direction also helps the film achieve a new low point in cinematic
humor.  For the most part, I felt as if I was watching a Saturday morning
chalderns live action TV show.   There is no sense of comic timing or
subtlety.  The director just throws the material at us, giving us nothing
except the hope that anyone with a camera could be a film director.
I am sure the film will have appeal to many of the under 22 crowd, at
least the one's who have yet to discover literacy.  Certainly the movie is
directed towards the generation that prefers everything described as 'in
your face,  kick you in the teeth, take no prisoners, (action-verb +blah
blah blah).'
   If you see the film and you find you're not laughing, there is nothing
wrong with you.  It just means you grew up since seventh grade.

   The Lost World.  Batman and Robin.  These movies bring
shudders to all motion picture fans, and with good reason.  What are they? 
Sequels.  The word sequel always brings one word to fans: bad.  Is it
fair to expect a sequel to live up to its original?  No, but most sequels turn
out to be terrible.  Some films have succeeded, not only at the box office like
all sequels do, but also in the plot and acting.  The Spy Who Shagged Me
is a perfect example that sequels can outdo their predecessor.
   First things first, you will not be seeing Mike Myers at the Oscars. 
The Spy Who Shagged Me is not going to be an Oscar contender, but it is
a comedy that accomplishes everything that it sets out to do.  Mike Myers not
only co-wrote the script, he also plays three different and important roles in
the film.  As in the original, he plays Austin Powers and Dr. Evil, but he also
introduces a Scottish spy known as Fat Bastard.  Unlike the original, Dr. Evil
is the main comedic attraction and he does not disappoint.  Fat Bastard is also
terrifically played by Myers.
   The Spy Who Shagged Me is basically an "evil" movie. 
The best moments of the film come from Dr. Evil and his associates.  This is
because of the excellent casting job done for the film.  First and foremost,
Dr. Evil is hilarious.  Myers establishes himself as a legitimate comedic
performer by showing that toilet humor can be original and hilarious as long as
it is done right.  Robert Wagner sets up some great jokes for Dr. Evil early in
the film, and then Rob Lowe takes over as the Young Number Two.  Rob Lowe's
performance is identical to Robert Wagner's.  Lowe realizes he is not there to
be a comedian, he is there to setup his counterparts and he does it
beautifully.  He sounds exactly like Robert Wagner, and works beautifully with
Myers.  Seth Green is back as Scott Evil, Dr. Evil's son, and his cynical view
of his father just adds to the humor.  Perhaps the biggest and best addition to
the cast came from the smallest member who did not have any lines.  This man,
or midget, is Mini-Me, played by Verne Troyer.  He does not speak, but Dr.
Evil's love for him sets up even more jokes.  Plus, his fight with Austin
Powers is terrific.  Last, Dr. Evil's newest spy in the Ministry of Defense,
Fat Bastard played by Myers, adds to the evil experience.  The constant fat
jokes may seem politically incorrect, but Myers does it with such flair that
you cannot resist laughter.
   What about the other side of the spectrum?  Austin Powers is back, and
once again played by Myers.  In International Man of Mystery, Powers was
the leading man and was hilarious.  He is not quite as funny in this one, but
he still has his moments and Dr. Evil does pick up the slack.  At the beginning
of the film, he is with his with Vanessa, played by Elizabeth Hurley.  But, she
is killed off in the first five minutes, which opens the gates for a new
partner for Powers.  Enter Heather Graham.  She plays Felicity Shagwell and is
the perfect contrast for the humor of Austin Powers.  Unlike Hurley, Graham is
not as reserved and she is just as "randy" as Powers.  And better
yet, Powers has lost his mojo, which makes their pairing all the better.  
   According to Myers, The Spy Who Shagged Me is forty- percent
improv.  This is not that bad, considering how funny the film is, but it can
get a little old at times, but this is nothing but a small problem.  Is there
anything else wrong with this film?  Yes, it is pretty short.  Compared to
other films, this is a short jog at ninety-five minutes.  But, it is packed
with jokes and never loses pace.
   Overall, The Spy Who Shagged Me establishes itself as the
Mary of 1999 and it is a worthy successor.  The randy comedy legitimizes
Myers as a comedic powerhouse and Powers' success at the box office
almost locks up a trilogy for the Powers franchise.  Yeah, baby,
yeah!

     James Bond is back  NOT!  as one vaguely remembered star of stage
and screen might have said.
     Instead of Bond, it's super-groovy spy Austin Powers (Myers) making
his triumphant return to the silver screen, the British secret agent
frozen in the 60's and thawed in the 90's, where/when he returned to
active duty.  THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME picks up right where the original
left off, with Dr. Evil (also Myers) banished to space in his Big Boy
statue/spaceship, and Austin settling down with new wife Vanessa
(Elizabeth Hurley, in a cameo re-appearance).
     Alas, Dr. Evil will not stay in exile for long.  He soon returns to
earth, where he hatches a plan to travel back to 1969 and `steal
Austin's mojo'  mojo that looks a bit like raspberry jam.
     It's up to Austin to travel back in time himself to get his mojo
back, of course, and it's back in '69 that he meets up with American CIA
agent Felicity Shagwell (Graham), goes on a wild car chase or two, faces
off with a new villain named Fat Bastard (also Myers), goes toe to toe
with a midget clone of Dr. Evil (Troyer), and ends up on the moon to
spoil the plan to build a, ahem, `Death Star' set to wipe out
Washington, D.C.
     Naturally, *none* of this is taken seriously, and AP2 takes the
farce to new heights (and lows).  Is THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME as good as
the original?  Actually, it's better by quite a bit.  While the original
was fun, it was too much about the one character of Austin and how out
of place he was.  The follow-up is much better-handled, with plenty of
fun characters (I loved Green as Dr. Evil's son, again) and some really
shagadelic situations.  See, it's catching.
     Problems?  In a shocker, it turns out that Heather Graham just
can't do comedy.  And while I won't deny that Heather is extremely hot,
she ends up weighing down the movie considerably with her seriousness
and deadpan line delivery.  Yawn.  Also, the Fat Bastard character is
quite an exercise in makeup technology, but haven't we gotten past the
point of mocking grossly overweight people?  And the Scottish thing?
Come on, Mike.  That one's older than Sprockets.
     While AP2 feels a bit like it was written in one night while under
the influence of controlled substances, I can't deny that it's really,
really funny.  The first 20 minutes represent the most I've laughed at a
film this year.  And I saw WING COMMANDER, don't forget.
     Stay to the end.  There are a couple of credits-running scenes you
really have to see.  Also notable are the two `Jerry Springer'
recreations (with Springer himself).  I'll leave you with a fun fact:
Did you know that Demi Moore was a producer on this film?  Did you know
that Demi Moore was a producer at all?

In this often-advertised sequel to 'Austin Powers,' there's a scene in which 
Scott Evil (Seth Green), son of Dr. Evil, pretends to sneeze, emitting the 
word "Ripoff!"  Oddly enough, it's the self-reflexive catchword of the film, 
from the opening moments with the James Bond theme and 'Star Wars' narrative 
script, to the wide-open-for-sequel ending.  Worse, all kinds of products 
are forced upon the script and our eyes.
There's also no doubt the film will do well at the box office.  A theater 
full of kids 12 through 18 or so - the buck-spending target audience - made 
this no secret.  Clearly, what we demand is gross-out humor, and "The Spy 
Who Shagged Me' does this best.  I have to hand it to Mike Meyers:  some of 
the grossest moments in comedy appear in this flick.  Meyers' alter-ego "Fat 
Bastard" is involved in fat jokes and poop jokes that had the audience 
roaring.  And the part that made me laugh the loudest was a scatological 
tour-de-force.
The premise:  not much of one.  Austin Powers (Meyers)  is single and 
swinging again, but his nemesis Dr. Evil is out to thwart him however he 
can.  Evil has a tiny clone he calls "Mini Me" (Verne Troyer), and the two 
of them time-travel back to 1969, their motive to steal the "mojo" - the 
sexual life-force - from the cryogenically-frozen Austin Powers.  A minor 
drawback to this premise is that we miss Robert Wagner's excellent henchman, 
Number 2, for the rest of the film.  Rob Lowe, however, does play a right-on 
imitation as Number 2 30 years younger.
You guessed it:  Powers follows the evil-doers back to the stereotypical 
psychedelic decade.  There he runs into Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham), 
an agent on Austin's side.  The trouble is, even though Felicity 
inexplicably falls for the crooked-toothed Don Juan, there can't be any 
"shagging," as Powers' mojo has been stolen.  What complicates the plot is 
Evil's plan to deploy a phallic-shaped laser to wipe out Washington D. C.  
Will Austin save the world?  Beat Dr. Evil?  Most importantly, will he get 
the girl?
As the title character, Mike Meyers delivers on the flat-out silliness we've 
come to expect of him.  He has a knack of making even badly written dialogue 
funny.  The way he holds his mouth, the way he points his gaze  And 
portraying the Scottish "Fat Bastard" as well as Dr. Evil gets him triple 
the giggles.  Something I found annoying, though, was how easy it is for 
Meyers to get laughs;  he's like the class clown who gets the attention he 
wants by making the stupidest and grossest comments imaginable!
Heather Graham performs well enough as Felicity Shagwell, though she does 
not distinguish herself.  Part of the mediocrity is the way her character is 
written:  she is far too compliant, a 'Laugh-In " dancer with lines.  (A 
pointless motif takes the form of Austin dancing with these 
vibrantly-dressed  groovers, by the way.)
Early on we see a schtick with Jerry Springer, in which Scott reveals his 
plight as the son of a madman bent on world domination.  One of the film's 
funnier bits of satire, this scene shows off the conflict between father and 
son.  It helps that Scott comes along on the time machine;  the film is 
better for Seth Green's presence.
What makes "Austin Powers:  The Spy Who Shagged Me" an average film at best? 
  It's that we are able to predict too much.  Sure, movies always rely on 
viewers' knowledge of culture and clichés;  but there's just not enough 
originality here to work with.  And when the film tries to get heady, we 
actually hear explanations of allusions that flew over the heads of most 
young viewers.  The bottom line is ambivalence.  If I believe that a film is 
worthwhile if it gives me a belly laugh, then I should recommend this 
'Austin Powers' sequel.  But I can't.  Not that it matters, as I heard a 
teenager a few rows in back of me quip, "We have to buy this on video."

PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
This randy and crass sequel to AP: International Man of Mystery is more
like the gag-fest There's Something About Mary than its predecessor.
Laden with a ballast of delicious bathroom humor (a long-time Sick-Boy
fave), AP:TSWSM opens with a fading scroll (a la Star Wars) explaining
the events from the first film  shaggy Powers (Mike Myers, Wayne's
World) was frozen in 1967 so that he could be thawed in the 90s to
fight the evil Dr. Evil (also Myers).
In the new film, the still-unfrozen Powers must travel back in time to
the psychedelic 60s to stop Evil, who has rocketed back to Earth in an
egg (a la Mork & Mindy) launched from the posterior of an intergalactic
Big Boy (one of several annoying product placement scenes), and
traverses time to steal a giant vial of `mojo' from a still-frozen
Powers.  `Mojo' is apparently is 60's version of Viagra, and is thusly
very important to our hero.
Some might find the story confusing, while others will point out the
obvious plot holes.  The filmmakers go out of their way to graciously
explain that they are not only aware of the script's obvious flaws, but
that they also don't care - and neither will you.  You'll be too busy
trying not to laugh up a vital organ.  The script (co-written by Myers
and friend Michael McCullers) concentrates more on gross-out humor than
the 60s spoofing featured in the prequel.  Director Jay Roach (upcoming
Mystery, Alaska) is also back at the helm for this film, which was
supposedly contrived of mostly improvisational material.
Reprising her part from the first film, Elizabeth Hurley (EdTV, My
Favorite Martian) delivers her least annoying role of the year as
Powers' bride Vanessa Kensington, but that probably had more to do with
her exploding in the film's first five minutes than her acting chops.
Fellow EdTV alum Clint Howard seems oddly out of place in a film not
directed by a relative.
Other holdovers include Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling, Idle Hands) and
Number 2 (Robert Wagner, Hart to Hart), who both play assistants to
Evil.  Seth Green (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) is also back as Scott Evil,
the wonderfully cynical son of the doctor, who is highlighted in one
particularly funny scene  an episode of Jerry Springer featuring kids
whose parents have crazy plans of world domination.
The standout newcomer is, of course, the diminutive Verne Troyer (Men in
Black) who plays Mini-Me, a cloned version of Dr. Evil that is
approximately 1/8th the size (but all the evil) of the original.
Although he has no lines, Troyer steals every scene he's in.  But don't
overlook Rob Lowe (Tommy Boy), who plays a young Number 2 and does a
low-key but hysterical dead-on impression of Wagner.  Lowe actually had
a very small part in the first film, billed as `friend of security
guard.'
And don't forget the new AP babes - Heather Graham (Boogie Nights) is
CIA agent and Powers' love/lust interest Felicity Shagwell.  Kristen
Johnston (3rd Rock From the Sun) plays Evil's double-op, brunette model
Ivana Humpalot.  There's someone named Robin Swallows, too, but I was
doubled over at the waist when they were describing just who she was.
But the best new character has to be the disgusting, baby-eating Scot
called Fat Bastard (Myers again).  He weighs a metric ton and is
responsible for the most revolting bathroom scene since Trainspotting.
If that doesn't get you motivated to see the film, I don't know what
will.  (1:37 - PG-13 for sexual innuendo and crude humor)

*NOTE*
"Monday Morning Movie Watcher is an informal review that takes all facets
of the movie experience into effect, including crowd reaction,
anticipation for the film, assorted "hype" surrounding the film, and
ultimately what the box office and overall reaction for the film was after
the initial weekend of release. In other words, I'm not trying to be
Pauline Kael here people, just a product of late 20th century
mass-media pop culture."
"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" (Released June 11, 1999)
Caught the sequel to Austin Powers at the AMC Academy in Greenbelt, MD.
Since the theater is next door to a college town, my companion and I
caught a late matinee in fear of a sell-out that evening.
Like most AMC theaters, this one relies on a very loud sound system to
compensate for a lack of a dynamic stereo set-up, but I've found it to be
a good place to watch a film.
A fairly large crowd for a Friday matinee rolled in, filling the seats
(and the film's mostly young male demographics) well.
"Big Daddy" - The Sandler movie looks to be a jump back towards his
"Wedding Singer" success. Having now seen this trailer a bunch of times, I
have a new concern about the film -- what if the trailer's all its got? 
"The Iron Giant" - Very highly anticipated by those in the know, but an
unknown quantity for those in today's audience. I love the design of the
Giant, and the film looks like a nice take on the "boy finds freak" story.
But this may suffer the same fate as every other non-Disney offering. The
reaction from the crowd was less than thrilling. I just can't see kids
getting that enthused over this film after what should be a jolt of
excitement from "Tarzan."
"Detroit Rock City" - a nice trailer that seems to suggest a cross between
"Dazed and Confused" and a road movie. It's got a nice feel to it, looks
good, and might be good nostalgia for those who can remember the 70's. 
"Wild Wild West" - Bad, bad, trailer. But the Will Smith song is slowly
selling this thing.
It was funny. Very funny. The same kind of funny as "There's
Something About Mary": a few funny scenes sandwiched between hilarious
comedy bits, sprinkled with gobs of gross-out humor.
But not as good as the first one. The shine is off the premise. It played
like "Ace Ventura 2", as a series of "greatest hits" catch phrases
integrated in with new, very funny scenes. 
Myers, in writing the new film, seems to have figured out what his
audience deduced from the original: that Dr. Evil, not Austin Powers, is
the interesting, breakout character. So he gives Evil all the good lines
and plays him with twice the veracity as he does Powers.
And that's part of the problem. Myers has boiled the hero down to his
barest parts: (and no, not his twig and berries - his essentials) a series
of catch phrases and mannerisms that seems to be there just to string
along the comedy bits. On the other hand, he's taken the best character of
the first film, Evil, and made him into an over the top parody of...well,
of himself. 
Evil was a clever send-up of Donald Plesance's Blofeld from the Bond
pictures, and really every other diabolical enemy. It was a fresh
take on a subject ripe for parody, just as Ace Ventura was a send-up of
super detective/cops.
But just like in "Ace 2," the character is imploded. All of the hilarious
satire on the original subject matter is used for dumbed down laughs. Dr.
Evil is less a insightful parody than he is an over-the-top clown. It's
Wayne Campbell as Dr. Evil, and it's a bit of a let down. After such a
well-crafted character stole the first film, to see him jump out of
character just to ham it up leaves one wondering if Myers had simply
exhausted the subject.
Not to say this ham isn't tasty. Dr. Evil is still the funniest thing in
the film. His lines hold up over the duration of two films (not so Powers)
and he participates in the film's single funniest bit:  The Evils
appearing on Jerry Springer.
As for the new additions to the cast, the most highly anticipated, and
rightfully so, is Mini-Me, Evil's tiny clone. He is worth the hype and
steals every scene he's in. The battle between him and Powers should
enrage little persons advocates, but it is priceless.
The introduction of Mini-Me opens the door for a rel comedic oppertunity
Myers fumbles in the film. Part of the great fun that the original
provided was supplied by the dysfunctional relationship between Dr. and
Scott Evil. Here, the subject of Scott's reaction to and the nature of the
relationship bewteen Dr. Evil and his pint-sized clone. But the family
rift is sqwandered with some "He tried to kill me" jokes and the film's
low-point:  an awkward, completely out-of-character and momentum killing
parody of Will Smith's ode to his son, "Just the two of us." It's another
in a series of examples where Myers has come up with a humerous idea, but
the execution in the film, and the character that is burdened by the gag,
is a letdown.
One concept that seems to work is Myers as Fat Bastard, a really bizarre
creation. A grotesque Scotsman who eats babies. Weird, but funny. This
character lets Myers explore the darker, more obscure side of his humor
that was on display in "So I Married an Ax Murderer" and his less quoted
work on "SNL."
As for Heather Graham, well, she's shagolicious. She literally looks
sexier in each progressive scene, but there simply isn't any chemistry at
all between her and Powers. While Ms. Kennsington and Austin had a bit of
an emotional click, Felicity goes into the relationship worshiping Powers.
With such a lothario as Powers, a little courtship goes a long way towards
building an interesting relationship.
Maybe it's character underdevelopment or just the "american" nature of
Felicity, but something just doesn't click here. We know Austin will end
up with the girl (as Hurley's Ms. Kennsington is hilariously dispatched
early). We just don't know why he would.
Hurley's early withdraweral brings us to another subject I'm a bit unsure
of, and that's Myers' winking acknoledgement that the film's plot is
unnecessessary. Part of the charm of the Bond films is that no matter how
perposterious the scheme of the bad guy, Bond plays it straight, gets the
girl and saves the day. The first film spoofed that by asking why the
villain just doesn't kill the hero. Now, we are told the plot is stupid,
we are told the villain is stupid, and we are stupid to enjoy it all.
But that's where the film falters. It forgets what made the first film so
special:  the relationship between Hurley and Myers, the fish-out-of-water
scenario and the sharp satire of spy films. The film hits all the right
marks, but as the lights cames up, I wiped the tears of laughter from my
eyes and felt the same way I felt after Ace 2, Naked Gun 2 and
Ghostbusters 2: I laughed, I cried, but I didn't see much I didn't catch 
the first time.
The crowd ate it up. The entire experience really did remind me of "Mary"
in the sense that the very funny parts had the audience laughing so loudly
that you miss the next piece of dialogue.
>From the grosses, the country ate it up, dethroning, as many of us thought
it might, "Star Wars" as the top movie in the country. 
Next weekend will be interesting. I don't know how much repeat viewing
this one will have. The jokes are pretty obvious, and many are funnier
when you just repeat them in conversation rather than see them on the
screen. 
1. The reviews have ranged all over the place. One thing is certain -
this movie does make you laugh. How hard, or how satisfying the experience
will be, depends on the viewer.
2. Calls have come for this film to be an "R." Idiotic! Double talk
and gross-out humor are squarely a PG-13 characteristic. Let's try and
salvage whatever merit the current ratings system has and not overdue it.

Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999) 
Written by: Mike Myers, Michael McCullers
Starring: Mike Myers, Heather Graham, Seth Green, Verne J. Troyer
Synopsis:
Sex-obsessed 1960s swinger/superhero Austin Powers (Mike Myers) becomes
impotent when his sexual prowess is stolen by archenemy Dr. Evil (Mike
Myers) and Evil's Scottish lackey Fat Bastard (Mike Myers). Heather Graham
plays Powers' female partner Felicity Shagwell (shag is the British
four-letter word for the word f-ck). Powers meets Shagwell, and they take a
time machine to the 1960s in order to thwart Dr. Evil. 
Opinion:
Blissful vulgarity is the main theme of THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME, a ribald
comedy that derives its snickers from phallic symbolism and devices such as
farting, corny profanity puns, and the narcissism of sex-obsessed
characters. Highlights include the scene where shadow silhouettes make it
appear as if Shagwell is taking things in and out of Powers' rectum,
bystanders remark about a huge, penish-shaped space shuttle, Powers drinks
diarrhea mistaking it for strong coffee, and two takes of THE JERRY
SPRINGER SHOW. One fat/ethnic line says: "He has more chins than a Chinese
phone book." 
Many critics feel that the PG -13 rating of this movie is a big mistake,
and I agree. Okay for adults, looney sex humor, overt profanity puns, and
repeated scenes of Scott Evil calling has father an ass should not be
standard fare for children. 
THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME is an adequate comedy vehicle for Mike Myers-type
humor. It has some genuinely funny parts mixed in with a lot of so-so,
take-it-or-leave-it camp. Myers is versatile as three different characters,
and Heather Graham does an admirable job as straight-shooting sidekick
Felicity Shagwell.

`Oh BEHAVE! Felicity Shagwell is one shagadellic babe. Do I make your

Anything that vaguely resembles sausages and eggs. Fat Bastard. The love
scene between Felicity and Fat Bastard, that redefines sex. The wrongly
implied love scene in the tent that redefines anal sex. The love scene
between Austin and Ivana Humpalot, that redefines chess and oral sex.
The love scene between Dr. Evil and Frau Farbissina, that redefines

himself and Mini Me which redefines a solo love affair. The unique
relationship between Dr Evil and his son Scott www.com.zip, that says a
lot about our relationship with our children nowadays. Weanies, Johnny,
Richard, Dick etc.'
This movie is every bit as silly and crazy as the first. There are
moments that will make your sick, which are probably best forgotten, but
overall Mike Myers has redefined what it means to be an international
spy and leading man.

On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
3 and a half stars
Recently some of my readers have expressed their belief that I look for
depth and meaning in films even when I shouldn't be; that is, I look for
a profound message when I should be enjoying the ride for what it is
worth.  Whilst there is probably some truth behind this argument, in my
defense is this review of Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, a movie
that is as deep as a blonde joke and half as meaningful.  Yet there is
something entirely satisfying with Mike Myers' comedic formula that
makes this film a delightful romp from start to finish.  Occasionally
overworked and very occasionally problematic but never boring or
unfunny, The Spy Who Shagged Me has been accused of all sorts of
cinematic sins, but none that make it any less enjoyable for the viewer.
Thanks to an even livelier atmosphere than the first film, this piece of
lavish cinema is better than its predecessor in terms of wit, energy and
fun.  Which, I suppose, is what Austin Powers is all about - celebrating
life with a warped sense of humor and an acute sense of the absurd.  Or
perhaps, Mike Myers is just having fun.
Agent Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley, sexy star of the original) is
quickly and effectively disposed of in the opening scene of The Spy Who
Shagged Me, paving the way for Austin Powers' (Mike Myers) new partner,
Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham) who he meets in 1969.  You see,
Austin's archenemy Dr Evil (Mike Myers) has traveled back in time and
stolen his "mojo", the thing that gives him his super shagedelic powers.
Austin must not only regain his mojo but also save the world from
destruction, as Dr Evil has built what he calls a "death star" on the
moon (Evil's son, Scott, played by Seth Green, is well aware of his lack
of ability to choose an original name).
The film movies smoothly along, introducing a spectrum of quirky
characters.  Fat Bastard (Mike Myers again) is an obese evil spy;
Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) is Dr Evil's one-eighth replica; and Frau
Farbissina (Mindy Sterling) is Dr Evil's peculiar love interest (well,
sort of).  Memorable moments include cameos from Jerry Springer (who is
fortunate to star in one of the film's best scenes), Woody Harrelson and
Willie Nelson; a hilarious rendition of 'What if God Was One of Us'; and
a clever scene that utilizes silhouettes on the side of a tent.
Everything is directed with a good sense of bad taste by filmmaker Jay
Roach, who succeeds on both commercial and artistic levels.  The Spy Who
Shagged Me has a colorful and engaging visual feel that captures the
lively spirit of the swinging sixties perfectly, thanks to its costume
design and cinematography by Ueli Steiger (Godzilla).  This film is one
of the better sequels of late, and definitely one of the funniest
comedies I've seen for awhile.  It's a refreshing picture that reminds
you of how good it is to laugh, and laugh loudly.  How would I feel
about another sequel?  Groovy, baby.

When AUSTIN POWERS:  INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY made its debut in
1997, it was an idea whose time had come.  Mixing dead-on spoof with
hilarious conventional comedy, the film was a continuous, unrelenting
laugh-fest that poked fun at the 1960's secret agent movie genre.
It's sequel, AUSTIN POWERS:  THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME, attempts to carry
on in the same tradition, but unfortunately fails to entertain as well
as it's predecessor.
Mike Myers returns as British super spy Austin Powers, frozen in the
60's and thawed out in the 90's to combat his arch nemesis Dr. Evil
(also played by Myers).  At the end of the previous film, Dr. Evil
escaped capture by sending himself into space in a giant Bob's Big Boy
statue.  The beginning of THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME features the evil Dr.
Evil returning from the cold reaches of Earth orbit, bent upon
destroying Austin Powers by traveling back in time to 1967, when
Powers was still frozen, and stealing the life force that makes him a
successful international operative:  His "mojo."  Dr. Evil is
convinced that once the constantly randy Powers is robbed of his
libido, his ability to thwart the plans of the world's dark forces
will be sapped for good (or bad, as the case may be).  Powers must
therefore pursue Dr. Evil into the past in order to save the world and
his ability to shag.
As I mentioned earlier, THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME attempts to capitalize
upon what worked so well for the first film.  This means there is
still a lot of parody of movies like DR. NO and OUR MAN FLINT, and
even the Patrick Magoohan television series "The Prisoner."  In many
cases, this works very effectively, such as when Dr. Evil builds his
secret hideout in the middle of an active volcano on a secluded
island, or whenever Powers gets into an automobile and the background
immediately looks like pre-filmed scenery.  However, many of the jokes
we get in THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME are also just retreads from the last
film without sufficiently new angles to make them as funny the second
time around, such as when one of Dr. Evil's henchmen just won't die,
or when Powers goes romping naked through a hotel lobby.  Both jokes
were brilliantly executed in 1997, but this time they are by nature
less inspired and fall relatively flat.
Undeveloped jokes are actually a serious problem in this film, a
result of screenwriting lapses and poor directorial choices.  For
example, the Evil empire invested heavily in Starbucks, and now the
Evil headquarters is located in the Seattle Space Needle.  As Dr.
Evil's right hand man Number Two (Robert Wagner) explains, it was a
great investment because Starbucks offers "premium coffee at
affordable prices."  The utter ridiculousness of this proposition,
along with the plausibility of the empire association (Amazon.com
could have been another good choice), presents many opportunities for
further comedic exploitation throughout the film.  Picture Frappucino
machines lifting themselves off of their mounts and walking down the
street wreaking havoc.  It's too bad the possibilities weren't pursued
further.  Additionally, there are instances where a character will say
something which seems to be a lead into a punchline, but the dialog
immediately moves on to something else, leaving the audience hanging
and confused.  A good director would have recognized this and
rectified the situation on the set or in the editing room.
The saving grace for this movie is that when the jokes do hit the
mark, they hit solidly.  Most of the time, the Dr. Evil character
steals the show, but one of Dr. Evil's henchmen, Fat Bastard (also
played by Myers) may be the most outrageous.  Drooling and inflated
with the notion that he's a sexy man, he also once ate a baby.  Myers
has played over-the-top Scotsmen on Saturday Night Live and in SO I
MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER, and Fat Bastard seems to be the next logical
step in the progression.
The other actors in the film are pretty much window dressing, although
they do what they can.  Robert Wagner only has a small role as Number
Two before the film moves to 1969, and a younger Number Two is played
by Rob Lowe, who does a great Wagner impression.  Seth Green as Dr.
Evil's son, Scott Evil, is under-used and has a lot less screen time
than he did in the last movie.  Mindy Sterling returns as henchwoman
Frau Farbissina, and Elizabeth Hurley has a short performance as
Secret Service agent Vanessa Kensington.  Powers' new love interest
and action partner is portrayed by Heather Graham as CIA agent
Felicity Shagwell, but she doesn't live up to the better performance
by Hurley the last film.  I realize THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME is a
comedy, but Graham just doesn't hold up in the scenes which require
more than a pretty face.  Disappointing, considering her wonderful
acting in BOOGIE NIGHTS, and I have a feeling the direction had more
to do with this than anything else.
One of the new characters in this film is a one-eighth sized clone of
Dr. Evil, which he dubs Mini Me (Verne Troyer).  I was impressed by
the fact that the film got a lot of mileage out of this diminutive
character who has no spoken lines, but actually helps the plot along
in addition to providing a lot of laughs.  In the end, however, Mini
Me is somewhat of a metaphor for this follow up to AUSTIN POWERS:
INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY.  It comes from the same stock as the
original, but it's a lot less.

Myers is still good as Austin Powers and even better as Dr. Evil.  He
also unfortunately plays a third character who is not so entertaining
called Fat Bastard... a huge Scottish fellow who's only real purpose
in the film is to be disgusting.  There was only one moment of his in
the film that I enjoyed (clearly a improvised one), but thankfully his
character's screen time is kept to a minimum (unlike another annoying
supporting character from a big summer 1999 release I might add).
Heather Graham is on hand as 60's CIA agent Felicity Shagwell and
provides some very nice visuals... and a decent performance too I
guess... as does Elizabeth Hurley, briefly reprising her character
from the first film.  Rob Lowe plays the younger version of Robert
Wagner's character Number 2, and does an amazingly dead on
impersonation of Wagner.  And you'll wish for more of Seth Green, who
plays Dr. Evil's son.
So how does it compare to the first film?  Well, in some ways it's
better and in some ways it's worse.  From a storytelling standpoint
the first film is vastly superior.  It was able to combine a cohesive
story and huge laughs without any problem whatsoever.  This film has
some very inspired moments, so much so that it will help you overlook
the complete lack of a comprehensible story (I know if the writers had
tried, the story could have been fleshed out with ease).  And many
times the comedy here is better than the comedy in the first one.  I
think each one has it's own strong points which make up for it's own
weaknesses.  Having said that, I liked both films about the same, and
look forward to a third one.  [PG-13]

Here we have the superior sequel to Austin Powers: International Man of
Mystery. This time Austin's nemesis, Dr. Evil, has traveled back in time to
steal our hero's mojo. Of course, Austin has no choice but to revisit his
swinging past in an attempt to regain said mojo and prevent Dr. Evil from
conquering the world. At its best, this movie is far funnier than the law
allows. Unfortunately, there are several slow spots with nary a chuckle.
Most of these unfunny moments involve Austin's romancing of Felicity
Shagwell. The romance does provide many a funny moment, but the film dwells
on it in too much detail. Besides, the funniest scenes are those involving
Dr. Evil, not Austin Powers. It just goes to show you -- Evil will win,
because Good is dumb! Anyway, this movie would be worth seeing just for the
hilarious credits, both beginning and ending, and it offers far more. I have
to give a final word of praise to two of the supporting actors. Seth Green
is brilliant as Dr. Evil's not evil enough son and  Rob Lowe does a
fantastic Robert Wagner impression.
Ratings go like this: Abominable, Bad, Fair, Good, Very Good, Great, and
Perfect. As you might guess, most movies are Fair to Good. Very few movies
are either Abominable or Perfect.

Hilarious, entertaining, sexy and perhaps even shagadellic, Austin 
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is the type of 
fall-out-of-your-seat-laughing comedy that only comes around on the 
rarest of occasions. With acting so uproariously funny, and a script 
that delivers punch line after punch line at a pace so rapid that you 
miss most of the movie while trying to stop laughing, Austin Powers is 
the comic convention of 1999.
A sequel in the truest of ways, the latest adventures of Austin Powers 
follow those of his in the 1997 hit, Austin Powers: International Man of 
Mystery. Dr. Evil (Mike Myers in one of three boisterously entertaining 
performances in this film) is back on earth in 1999 despite his previous 
venture into space at the conclusion of the 1997 movie, and more evil 
than ever. He plans on taking over the earth and ridding it of his 
enemy, Austin Powers (Mike Myers). In order to do this he must travel 
from his new space headquarters, a Starbucks shop, in 1999 back to 1969 
and steal Austin Powers' mojo. Considering this seems to be a movie 
spoofing Star Wars heavily, it is assumed that this mojo is the 
equivalent of the "the force" and can be easily withdrawn from a frozen 
body. Understanding that leads to the obvious point that a total and 
utter suspension of reality is essential.
Dr. Evil has yet another problem to deal with, as his son, Scott Evil 
(Seth Green), is upset with him for doing what he does. This leads to a 
wonderful spoof on the times, as the two meet again on the Jerry 
Springer Show. Just infuriating Scott further, Dr. Evil has been cloned 
as well. The result is what he refers to as Mini-me, an exact replica, 
but only 1/8 his size. To Dr. Evil the clone is like the son he always 
wanted and never had. After all, as the first movie showed, there is 
nothing like a good father son conflict to bring laughs to the screen. 
This is an absolute truth as the characters continuously try to out-hip 
each other, while Dr. Evil complains that Scott is only "The Diet Coke 
of Evil."
When you have  a spy as sexy as Austin Powers himself, the women 
naturally follow. In this installment, we meet Felicity Shagwell 
(Heather Graham), Ivana Humpalot (Kristen Johnson of TV's 3rd Rock from 
the Sun), Robin Swallows (Gia Carides) and a few other shagable young 
women. The basic plot outline of their roles is that all of them are 
working for Dr. Evil, save Felicity who is a secret agent.
Additionally, this production is full of cameos from some most notable 
names. Burt Bacharach, Elvis Costello, Will Ferrell, Woody Harrelson, 
Willie Nelson, Tim Robbins and Jerry Springer all poke into the film at 
some point, with most of them just delivering one of the countless penis 
jokes as themselves. Mike Myers also takes on a third role, of a more 
cameo like nature.
What really brings the humor to Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me 
are the spoofs on every day things that people can relate to, and 
classic movies that have always begged to be lampooned in this fashion. 
Even the trailers for this film suggested that "If you can only see one 
movie this summer, see85Star Wars: Episode One" as the film immediately =
adapts to being released in the wake of the sure hit from Lucas. So the 
solution chosen was to tease the force to nth degree, even beginning 
this film with yellow text scrolling up the screen, with an outer-space 
background. Additionally, there are the obvious connections to James 
Bond which would be the central focus of the film if it was a plot 
concentrated work instead of a witty collection of humor. And just to 
top it off there is a moment just slightly modified from John Watters' 
cult classic, Pink Flamingos, involving the consumption of human waist.
Mike Myers may well be doing these movies because his talent is limited 
elsewhere. Despite moderate success as Wayne in Wayne's World, and an 
award worthy performance in 54, the actor has been wise enough to limit 
his work after the 1993 flop, So I Married An Axe Murderer. Regardless, 
he is perfect for these roles probably due in large part to his writing 
credit on the film as well. Heather Graham is the ideal counterpart to 
Myers, bringing the presence of an actress capable of delivering the 
jokes and body humor just as well as anyone else, with a sexual appeal 
that makes her the Bond Girl of Austin Powers. This is never better 
shown than a scene which pits her in bed with an obese character simply 
known as Fat Bastard (Myers' third role). The two of them light up the 
screen and make an otherwise totally disgusting, uncalled-for scene into 
a funny and just mildly nauseating one that sticks with you for a long 
time.
Mike Myers has created a comic gem. Spoofing everything in sight, 
holding nothing back, and running monologues of nothing but penis humor, 
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is the year's most refreshing 
comedy. Further enlightened by great character acting and distinguished 
cameos, the film will make you hope for and anticipate a future 
installment. Needless to say, this certainly isn't the Diet Coke of 
movies.

I am a fan of the original Austin Powers, and I'm also a fan of Mike
Myers.  I don't know much about him, but he seems like a really
down-to-earth guy, one of those comedians who doesn't find it necessary
to make a fool of himself every time he appears before a live studio
audience.  I'm glad to see that he's finally found his crowd-pleasing
niche; though most of his films have found their audiences on video,
Austin Powers:  The Spy Who Shagged Me is likely to be the first massive
box office success of Myers' career (with the exception of Wayne's
World, which doesn't count for various reasons).  
I liked AP2, but not as much as I liked the original.  My reasons for
this should not come as a surprise:  too many elements are rehashed or
expanded from the first film, there are sizeable gaps in the laugh-flow,
and there is way too much toilet humor.  The story is goofy and dopey
enough to carry itself through the slow sections, and so I never found
myself completely bored.  There are also some brilliant casting choices,
a few truly hilarious subplots, and the gleeful use of sexual vulgarity
and phallic symbols.  I recommend the film, but I miss the
excrement-free environment and hokey originality of the first movie. 
However, I think I like the story behind this one better.  It has a
kind of insane genius about it that makes it entertaining even when
there aren't many laughs.  Myers also does the right thing by giving Dr.
Evil what seems like more screen time than Austin himself.  (That also
makes me wonder if the series shouldn't be named after the villain.) 
The basic structure revolves around Dr. Evil -- he goes back in time to
steal Austin's mojo.  After drinking the mojo, Dr. Evil becomes much
more hip, and even has a one night stand with Frau Farbissina (Mindy
Sterling).  Austin, meanwhile, works to recover his mojo with the help
of Felicity Shagwell (the luminous Heather Graham, looking happy to be
in an Austin Powers movie).  Little does he know that Dr. Evil has new
evil cohorts:  Fat Bastard (an unrecognizable Myers in an enormous
prosthetic suit), and Mini-Me (Verne Troyer), a robot version of Dr.
Evil, one-eighth his size.
AP2 is a rare example of a comedy that uses subplots in the right way. 
Just before things get dull, the scene switches to any one of the three
or four subplots, and audience interest in the film is held through the
end.  The best subplot is certainly the relationship between Dr. Evil
and Mini-Me; Troyer is absolutely wonderful as the mute little monster,
and Dr. Evil's love for his diminutive pet is actually kind of touching
in a sarcastic sort of way.  This also adds a new dimension to Dr.
Evil's biological son, Scott Evil (Seth Green).  Green is a very funny
young actor, and the rivalry between him and Mini-Me is quite
effective.  Mindy Sterling, reprising her role from the first film as
the crazy German lady, thankfully is given more screen time here.  And
Rob Lowe does a perfect imitation of Robert Wager, playing the young
version of Number Two.  
There's no doubt that AP2 shines in several scenes with inspired
brilliance.  The two best sequences really can't be described in words,
but those who have seen the film will remember the way various people
all over the world describe Dr. Evil's phallic space ship as it blasts
off.  And Myers' love for these characters and this series keeps the
film from ever feeling perfunctory or dull.  But some scenes go way too
far:  everything with Fat Bastard, for instance, is not funny, and
simply disgusting (laughing and cringing are two separate reactions
altogether).  
I had the distinct sense of deja vu all through AP2, as if Myers had
been afraid to explore new territory.  I can't say I blame him; it would
have been a mistake to seriously change the look and feel of this
sequel.  But it lacks the discovery and newness of the first film, and
so it comes off almost as outtakes from the original, rather than a new
movie altogether.  Don't get me wrong:  Myers has made a funny picture. 
And, seeing as how a third installment in this series is inevitable, I
have high hopes that Myers will find an all new angle on his series and
exploit it into oblivion.

Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me
Rating (out of five): **
Starring Mike Myers, Heather Graham, Michael York, Robert Wagner, Rob Lowe,
Seth Green, Mindy Sterling, Verne Troyer, Will Farrell, Kristen Johnston
and Elizabeth Hurley
Directed by M. Jay Roach
Written by Myers and Michael McCullers
Rated PG-13 for sexual and, at times, very crude humor
Theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35:1
Released in 1999
Running 95 minutes
If only Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me had been just half as
original, zany, silly and totally enjoyable as its predecessor, it would
have easily been one of this summer's biggest pleasures. If only. In fact,
The Spy Who Shagged Me is the exact opposite of the original; instead of
refreshing the audience with one clever parody after another, the filmmakers
bombard us with used-up, tired jokes taken directly from the first one.
Take the scene where Austin Powers (again played by Mike Myers, but with
only a fraction of the giddy enthusiasm he displayed previously) confronts a
henchmen on the side of a cliff. After being pushed off the ravine, the bad
guy is of course assumed dead. But suddenly, we hear a pleading voice coming
from down below; he's only injured. A similar scene played very well in the
original International Man of Mystery, but here I was insulted by it. Did
the filmmakers really believe the audience would laugh at a rip-off?
Apparently I overestimated the intelligence of the average movie-goer,
considering that the film has pulled in over $200 million in domestic
theatrical grosses alone. Do I hear the sound of a franchise heading our
way?
Having said that, though, I still cannot deny the film its merits. The basic
plot was delightfully silly enough to sustain my interest somewhat; Dr. Evil
(Mike Myers, in the second of his three roles), having constructed a time
machine, goes back to the year 1969 in an attempt to snatch Austin Power's
"mojo" (don't you just love that word?) whilst he is cryogenically frozen.
When Austin gets wind of this (after a great intro explaining the absence of
Elizabeth Hurley's Vanessa Kensington) , he too travels back in time to
re-claim his sexual drive, accompanied by the hot-to-trot Felicity Shagwell,
played by Heather Graham. This sounds stupid, I know, but in the movie it
starts to make some kind of weird, off-the-wall sense, and it worked for me.
Then there's Mini-Me (Verne Troyer), a... petite clone of Myer's Dr. Evil,
exactly 1/8 in size. Troyer's persona alone gains the film an extra
half-star, contributing to one particularly hilarious scene where he
attempts to nibble on his own Mini-Mr. Bigglesworth. Just try to ignore the
fact that, at 2'8'', he would make Dr. Evil's height rise to just over 21
feet. No matter.
However, there are only about four hearty laughs throughout the entire hour
and a half (the most notable being the now infamous tent scene), and that
just isn't enough to warrant even a minor recommendation. If there is in
fact an "Austin Powers 3", they should just kill off secret agent Powers and
put the emphasis on Dr. Evil and Mini-Me. Unconventional, yes, but there's
no denying that it'd make for a better movie.

Starring Mike Myers; Heather Graham; Michael York; Robert Wagner & Rob Lowe
I'll have to say that I thought that Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me
was better than the first one. Although, to the credit of the original, it
seems to be getting funnier each time I see it. I'm guessing that this one
might play the same way. Austin Powers (Mike Myers) is still adjusting to
the 90's when something evil happens. Dr. Evil, that is. Evil (Mike Myers)
and Mr. Bigglesworth (Evil's hairless cat) return to Earth from their
cryogenic sleep chamber on board their Big Boy satellite. Evil now has a
plan to stop Austin Powers for good. His right hand man, Number 2 (Robert
Wagner) has had a time machine built for Dr. Evil. Evil plans to use it to
return to the 1960's and steal Austin Powers' mojo. And he is taking along
some help. While Dr. Evil was in cryogenic sleep, his henchmen have cloned
him. His clone is not quite the perfect match -- he is only 1/3 Evil's size.
But even with his short stature, Mini Me (Verne Troyer) is a force to be
reckoned with. So Evil and Mini Me go back in time where they hook up with a
much younger Number 2 (Rob Lowe) and steal the mojo with the help of a
disgruntled Scotsman by the name of Fat Bastard (Mike Myers). Austin must
then return to the '60's to retrieve his mojo with the help of '60's secret
agent Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham).
I was very disappointed in the somewhat cheesy way that Elizabeth Hurley was
dealt with in this movie. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be funny but it
really didn't work for me. She had about two minutes of screen time and her
scenes were pretty much the weakest points of the movie through no fault of
her own. As in the first one, Dr. Evil steals the show. Although, Fat
Bastard is pretty good too. Felicity Shagwell comes a close second to the
two evil Myers characters. Heather Graham is a very groovy, and a more than
adequate replacement for Hurley in both the looks and talent departments.
Also, like the first one, Robert Wagner does a great job. As does Rob Lowe,
playing Wagner's younger self. I wouldn't be surprised if this performance
by Lowe resurrects his career.
My sense is that fans of the old James Bond films will catch a few more of
the jokes here than the rest of the audience. There are a lot of very subtle
little things geared towards them that I really appreciated. Some of the
humor, especially surrounding Fat Bastard, was downright disgusting. But I
must admit that it was among the funniest in the film, and I laughed along
with everyone else in the theater.
At times I get the impression that Myers finds something that works and
milks it a bit too much.
The strategically placed object to disguise nudity worked really well in the
first film. So instead of coming up with something more inventive, he based
to whole opening sequence around the hidden nudity. It was funny, but just a
bit of a cop-out in my opinion. Especially considering how much thought was
put into the trailers spoofing the other movie of the summer of '99 -- The
Phantom Menace.
One sequence that I really enjoyed has a scene involving Dr. Evil'
spaceship, which was in the shape of a part of the male anatomy. The
descriptions used by people on the ground as they looked up at it flying
through the sky were hilarious. Then of course, we have Mini Me (Vern
Troyer), Dr. Evil's clone. He combined with Evil to come up with some great
scenes. The interaction between Evil and his son Scott (Seth Green) also
worked just as well in this film as it did in the original. As with the
first, the writers played off the fact that Evil was just slightly behind on
the progress that has been made during his 30 years of hibernation. But this
time they added to it by having Evil screw up in the '60's by using '90's
expressions with the 60's characters that he was trying to interact with.
The movie was stolen by Myers playing Evil as he tried to be the hip villain
but just usually ended up showing how square he really was. Austin Powers:
The Spy Who Shagged should easily rank as one of the funnier films of the
year. The movie was groovy baby, yeah!

So, in the wee early morning hours of Monday (well, not that early),
while having my breakfast cereal, I see in the newspaper that "Austin
Powers" has utterly crushed "Star Wars" this weekend.  Ah, well, it's
definitely a funnier film.
Uttering "Austin Powers" and "Star Wars" in the same breath isn't an
outlandish thing.  "Austin Powers" had at least a few "Star Wars"
references, from its advertising campaign to the opening text crawl.
We can take it a bit further, and say that Dr. Evil is, like, the
lightsabre duel, Austin himself was sort of like the Pod Race, and no
one was Jar Jar Binks.  Well, I could have done with less Fat Bastard,
but I don't think, Fat Bastard Die Die Die.  "Austin Powers" is a very
consistently funny movie, without many soft spots.  Some things go on
for too long, like your typical SNL skit, but not many.
What plot there is centers on Dr. Evil going back in time to steal
Austin's mojo.  This is basically an excuse to wander into all sorts of
shameless product placements, the most inspired of which is the one for
the new Volkswagen Beetle; psychedelic Sixties theme park fun with
Heather Graham in short-shorts; and some very neat jokes with clueless,
displaced Sixties personalities who have seen the future but have now
been sent back to their home turf.  Dr. Evil trying and badly failing
to use late 1990s-isms was inspired ("One hundred billion dollars!"), a
sort of conscious set of reversals from the usual man-out-of-time
idioms.  Austin himself was less interesting in this regard.
I'm starting to think that cultural critics of the 21st Century will
recognize Jerry Springer as a brilliant auteur, conjuring forth a
subtle performance art piece on a daily basis, casting it as a lewd
talk show in order for his devastating social criticism of fin-de-siecle
America to reach the widest audience in the most subversive way
possible.  But I could be wrong.  I've only watched one of his shows,
when I was on sick leave last year.
I actually didn't like the original movie all that much.  It plodded
along: once you get the idea of spy movie-spoof guys from the 1960s
trying to make it thirty years later, you have a lot of the joke.
That's material for half-hour sitcoms (South Park actually had a
wonderful episode of this, with an ice man from 1996 being revived in
1999: Land's End, Ace of Base, and the Internet was difficult to get
on), not feature-length films.  This new movie just works better by not
paying much attention to that idea, by self-consciously pointing out
how silly the movie is ("It's remarkable how much the English
countryside looks like southern California", and the London street
scene with sun-burnt hills in the background), and by playing with the
aforementioned man-out-of-time-back-in-time jokes.
Oh, stay for the entire credits.  Little skits in the credits.  And the
DVD for this movie _must_, absolutely _must_ have karaoke.

Gia Carides
written by Mike Myers and Michael McCullers
directed by Jay Roach
There's no denying that "Saturday Night Live" alum Mike Myers has
talent. He can write, act, produce and improvise. But most of all he's
just really damn funny. A few years ago, he was best known for
"Wayne's World", a lowbrow pre-Adam Sandler comedy about two slackers
who get their own TV show. The film spawned a sequel in 1993, and
after that Myers took a four-year hiatus. He made a grand return in
1997 with "Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery", a 60's spy
spoof featuring himself as the shagadelic, unhygienic title character
(and as his nemesis, Dr. Evil).  The film grossed 50 million in
theatres but became a huge hit on video. Like I said before, Myers is
really damn funny, but you wouldnt know it from his latest, "Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"; the lackluster sequel to the other
"Powers" film.
Dr. Evil (Mike Myers) is back and this time he has brought an even
more eclectic band of characters to help him take over the world. To
act as his evil sidekick, replacing his quasi-evil son (Seth Green),
he has made a clone of himself; a person 1/8 his size whom he
affectionately calls Mini-Me (Verne Troyer). He also has invented a
"time machine" which will enable him to return to 60's Britain.
Meanwhile, Austin Powers has just found out that the woman whom he
believed to be his wife (Elizabeth Hurley) was actually a robot
working for Dr. Evil. In order to stop Austin from plotting his
revenge, Dr. Evil sends out Fat Bastard (Mike Myers, once again) to
steal Austin's "mojo" (basically his libido, but for Austin, it's the
reason why women fall for him despite his many flaws, which explains a
lot). Austin then teams up with Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham) to
retrieve the mojo from the hands of Dr. Evil. But Dr. Evil has also
created a "laser" which he will use to destroy every city in the
world.
While the first "Austin Powers" was occasionally very witty, the
sequel is only funny about once every 15 minutes, and all of its humor
is quite dumb. In many ways, "Austin Powers" is a very conventional
movie franchise. The first film was a hit because of its originality
and style, and it did well because of word-of-mouth. The sequel is a
typical Hollywood creation, as the humor is dumbed-down for the kids
and the wit and sharpness of the former is gone.
Much of "Austin Powers" humor comes from the audacious sexual
references that are somehow harnessed to just avoid an "R"
rating. There are dick jokes aplenty in the sequel, and many bodily
fluids are passed around ("South Park", anyone?). A little-known fact
about "Austin Powers" is that half of the film is improvised. Director
Jay Roach keeps the camera rolling and it is usually then that he
catches Mike Myers' comedic skill.
"The Spy Who Shagged Me" will undoubtedbly rake in millions at the box
office, and many sequels will follow. Maybe, just maybe, one of those
sequels will provide something as fresh and new as the original film.
Note: The entire opening weekend was sold out, and many of my friends
told me just about every joke in the film before I got to see
it. Maybe that is a factor; maybe not.  Also, what's up with the "Star
Wars" references? It is a sad comment on society when "The Spy Who
Shagged Me" outdoes "Star Wars" at the box office and then laughs in
its face.

     Mike Myers's follow-up to his enormously successful 60s superspy
hit is relentlessly  and cheerfully tasteless.  To call it sophomoric
would be an insult to sophomores  everywhere.  And to call it funny
would be an understatement.  
     It's not all funny, not by any means.  A lot of toilet humor is
just plain excrescence, and  there's a lot of toilet humor here, as well
as jokes covering the entire lower end of the  comedy spectrum.  But
Mike Myers is a funny guy, and his inspired creations Austin  Powers and
Dr. Evil still have some good miles left in their tread.  He tries a
third persona  here, a fat slob of a Scotsman, who has none of the wit
of the other two and should have  been drowned at birth.
     If you think you might be offended by the movie's crudeness, it's a
good bet you will.   But if you're up to it, there's a lot to laugh at
here.  At the close of Powers I, Austin had  foiled archenemy Dr. Evil
and married the beautiful Elizabeth Hurley.  But marriage isn't  the
swinging superspy's bag, baby, and it's a relief when circumstances
leave him single  and available to the shaggadelic Felicity Shagwell 
(Heather Graham).  The bad doctor  reappears to surprise his son (Seth
Green) on a Jerry Springer show on the theme "My  Father Is Evil and
Wants to Take Over the World".  He then constructs a time-travel 
machine, and, accompanied by his compact clone Mini-me (Verne J. Troyer)
, heads back  to the 60s and steal Powers's mojo, a marrow-like
substance extracted from the agent's  cryogenically preserved body which
provides his irresistible sex appeal and shaggability.  
     The plot is all in the service of the gags.  Product placement
figures shamelessly, as  with Dr. Evil locating his headquarters in a
Starbucks atop Seattle's Space Needle.  There  are good gags, bad gags,
scatological humor, sexually incorrect humor, fat jokes, short  jokes,
penis jokes, breast jokes, lesbian jokes.  Sometimes a joke works once,
and falls flat  when it returns for an encore.  Sometimes once is too
much.  If you're still in your seat  after half an hour, you're probably
in for the long haul.

Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999)
Reviewed by Eugene Novikov

Starring Mike Meyers, Heather Graham, Seth Green, Verne Troyer. Rated
PG-13 (but should be R).
When a someone journeys to the theater to see a comedy, he always risks
having to sit through inanity such as what we recently saw in films like
EDtv and Office Space. It really is too bad that comedies are so hit-
and-miss, because when a moviegoer goes in a theater expecting to be
amused, it really is a shame when the alleged comedy fails to deliver.
But weep not, dear readers, because the latest comedy out of the
Hollywood movie mill is nothing less than a sure bet. Austin Powers: The
Spy Who Shagged Me is one of the funniest things I've had the pleasure
to see in a long time; a completely looney, delightful parody of the
often pretentious James Bond flicks. If all comedies (or even half; or -
- what am I saying? -- even a fifth of them) could be this consistently
hysterical, I would take up residence at my local multiplex.
Even more to this movie's credit is the fact that it is a sequel to the
1997 sleeper/cult hit Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery. The
original came out of nowhere; it was a low-budget, eccentric movie that
many expected to flop like a Leslie Nielsen parody. All of a sudden it
was being quoted by teenagers all over America. Ironically, Powers'
"Yeeeeah baby, yeah!" has almost become an icon of the late 90s.
Thus another installment was inevitable, but it's also undoubtedly
welcome. The Spy Who Shagged Me is one of the most unrestrained, over-
the-top comedies I have ever seen in my entire life. It brings back most
of the characters from its predecessor (even if only briefly) and adds
new ones. Austin Powers (Mike Myers), a swinging hipster from the 60s
transported into the 90s has to go back to his own time to get back his
mojo (oh, you'll figure it out), which Dr. Evil (Meyers again) has
stolen. He enlists the help of a gorgeous secret agent Felicity Shagwell
(now that his prior sidekick Vanessa has been properly disposed of in a
hilarious opening sequence), played without much distinguishable gusto
by Heather Graham and together they go back to the 60s to defeat Dr.
Evil yet again.
Surprisingly, the real star is Dr. Evil rather than Austin. He gets most
of the screen time because he was so popular in the first movie. Perhaps
this is true because he is portrayed and written so affectionately.
Instead of being the scheming, villainous mad scientist we might expect
from a character like this he is a bumbling, often sweet mad scientist
wannabe.
The Spy Who Shagged Me has much of the same stuff we saw in the
original, but that's okay by me because the original left us wanting
more. By the time that one was over we haven't had nearly our share of
shag jokes, crude puns and Powers' antics and this sequel satisfies our
appetites. Even by its conclusions, I'm still not sure I've had my fill
of bits like "Do you smoke after sex?" "I don't know, baby, I never
looked."
This may seem awfully immature of me, but understand that the Austin
Powers series, unlike most of the crap Hollywood feeds us these days, is
genuinely funny. I don't know if I've ever laughed harder at any movie
than I did during the Jerry Springer send up or the indubitably
hilarious "Just the Two of Us" rendition by Dr. Evil and his new
miniature clone named "Mini-me".
I don't have any pretensions that this is particularly smart social
satire or anything of the sort. Indeed there is little beyond the joy a
viewer feels when he sees something that is able to entertain him as
much as this movie did. But as far as I'm concerned, that is enough.

Okay, so I was a little distracted by the fact that I had Jacques
Villeneuve, Formula I race car driver, snuggling up to his better half a few
rows behind me in the theatre, but once the groovy tunes sounded off, the
colorful characters jumped on-screen and Austin Powers blasted into his
all-familiar mojo fever, there was no denying that the 60s were back, and
this shagadelic sequel had begun!
PLOT:
Dr. Evil time-travels back to the 1960s to steal Austin Powers' mojo (His
essence, his aura, his libido, if you will). With the absence of his horny
spirit, Austin loses focus and must also return to the 60s in order to
regain his essence.
CRITIQUE:
Clever, witty, enjoyable, fun and almost as fresh and original as the first
one, save for a few redundancies which didn't click and Heather Graham who
was not as interesting as Elizabeth Hurley in the original (although her
outfits are simply smashing!), this movie will definitely satisfy all
Austin/Dr. Evil lovers and guarantee a solid box-office summer for Myers and
crew. This movie starts off with a bang, as the first 20 minutes deliver
some of the film's funnier moments (The whole Jerry Springer sequence
cracked me up). It also seemed as though they put more emphasis on the Dr.
Evil character in this follow-up, which was all fine with me, cause I
personally found him to be more entertaining than Austin in the first place.
Nevertheless, kudos go out to Mike Myers once more for pulling off plenty of
smart one-liners, movie homages galore, and tossing a couple of new
characters into the mix. Mini-me, a midget Dr. Evil, seemed to be the
biggest crowd pleaser, and the Fat Bastard (Myers under 80 pounds of latex
fat), who I could've done without, save for one hilarious scene in bed with
a female spy.
A couple of other things which didn't truly delight me were the Austin
Powers dancing segues between scenes, which seem forced and self-indulgent,
and the song and dance numbers in the film, which appeared to be nothing
more than time-fillers. But on the whole, this movie is funny and will have
you cracking up at Dr. Evil's father/son silly banter, Mini-me's fight with
Austin, the multitude of sexual overtures delivered by Austin, and the
overall enthusiasm of the entire ride down the 60s free-wheeling, all-loving
shagfest. Folks who did not enjoy the first film, will undoubtedly scoff at
this sequel, which plot-wise, does even less than its predecessor. But for
all of you who enjoyed the first movie for what is was, a goofy, original,
over-the-top spy parody, chances are that you will most certainly enjoy the
bulk of this film, with its re-occurring characters (and jokes, at times),
Myers' fantastic performance as Evil and Powers, its fun loving,
self-deprecating attitude, and all the kitchy goodness that you could stuff
inside of ninety minutes of groovy cinema. Now does that make you horny?
Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Cameos galore in this one as well (Don't read further, if you don't want to
know who they are). Tim Robbins plays the President of the United States of
America, Woody Harrelson shows up as, well, a character named Woody, and
Kristen Johnston plays some husky Russian babe, Ivanna Humpalot. Clint
Howard, Ron Howard's brother, also returns as the radar operator. Burt
Bacharach, Elvis Costello, Willie Nelson, Rebecca Romjin-Stamos and Jerry
Springer also show up as themselves.
The actor playing Mini-me is named Verne Troyer. He is 32 inches tall. You
may remember him as the tiny Santa Claus on top of Arnold Schwarzenegger in
1996's JINGLE ALL THE WAY.
Mike Myers claims that nearly 40% of the dialogue in this film was
improvised on the spot, and that he has agreed to do up to five Austin
Powers films in all. Even King Hussein of Jordan was a huge Austin Powers
fan according to Myers, and watched the tape when he was ill at the Mayo
Clinic.
The original AUSTIN POWERS film became Billboard's No.1-selling video in its
category in 1998, and has been there ever since (as of June 9, 1999...64
weeks and counting).
James Bond film references: (Entertainment Weekly#489) The title is a direct
rip-off of THE SPY WHO LOVED ME. When Austin and Felicity hit the beach in
bikinis, it's a reference to Ursula Andress in DR.NO. The new volcanic lair
of Dr. Evil is from YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE (Just as Dr. Evil is patterned after
TWICE's Blofeld character). The music for the sequel is very CASINO ROYALE,
and there's a bit of GOLDFINGER in the scene where Austin sees an assassin
behind him in the reflection of his glasses. There are also plenty of other
film references tossed in and around, such as INDEPENDENCE DAY, JERRY
MAGUIRE, THE EXORCIST, STAR WARS, THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR, and many more
which I just can't seem to remember at this time.
This film was originally titled IT'S SHAGGING TIME and THE RETURN OF DR.
EVIL.
In the U.S., "shag" is far less offensive than in other English-speaking
countries. Singapore briefly forced a title change to THE SPY WHO SHIOKED ME
("Shioked" means "treated nicely.").

Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999)
Directed by Jay Roach
Written by Mike Myers
Starring Mike Myers, Heather Graham, Mindy Sterling, Seth Green, Robert Wagner,
Rob Lowe, Elizabeth Hurley
It makes perfect sense why Mike Myers decided to make another "Austin Powers"
film.         The original was a box office hit which introduced new phrases into
our pop-culture vocabulary. It made Mike Myers an independent household name
without the accompaniment of Dana Carvey or the black baseball cap and the torn
blue jeans he wore in "Wayne's World". With "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged
Me", Myers has permanently left his name on a select list of comedic geniuses
of the 1990's. Genius is an appropriate word. Only geniuses would use the same
jokes that earned them big bucks in the past for future events. This strategy
takes advantage of the pleasures of target audiences and gets as much money as
it can out of these viewers until their act grows tiresome. Myers has followed
this lucrative code by appearing as his Austin Powers creation in a number of
ads, an MTV awards show, a Madonna music video, a trivia computer game and now
in the sequel "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me". Luckily for him, his
British spy has not grown tiresomeyet. 
The sequel is almost a carbon copy of the original. The same characters and the
same gags are used in both films. In the sequel, however, the jokes are taken
to a higher level meaning the duration of time each joke requires to execute is
a bit longer. This makes the film enjoyable but it leaves an uncomfortable
feeling of déjŕ vu. Although the title ostensibly suggests that Austin Powers
is the star of the film, Mike Myers' second creation, Dr. Evil, is the main
focus of the film with numerous jokes, one after the other. Austin's titular
character is just a formulaic character who inevitably gets the girl and saves
the day. Dr. Evil is also formulaic indeed, as he is destined to attempt to
take over the world but fail in the last ten minutes, but he is responsible for
the true laughs in the film. His clueless rhetoric on how to use slang in his
sentences is very memorable. He's just trying to fit in. When he incorrectly
makes a statement or when he embarrasses himself physically, he uses his
powerful status to try to prove what he is doing is right, no matter how wrong
he is. For example, when he gets some foam from his Starbucks drink on his nose
and chin, Dr. Evil immediately replies, once realizing it is there, that that
is how they drink it in Belgium. "We call it the Belgium Dip." Dr. Evil is so
frightening that no one could argue with him. What is so amusing is Dr. Evil, a
supposedly powerful and audacious, is like a little Teddy Bear, innocuous and
fearful. In order to hide this secret, Dr. Evil hires a number of hilarious
henchmen. Mustafa (Will Ferrell) plays a hit-man who can not stand to be asked
a question three times in a row. Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) is an exact replica of
Dr. Evil, except he is one eighth of his size. Fat Bastard (also played by
Myers) weighs a metric ton who eats because he is sad and is sad because he
eats. These characters are all highlights of the film as they add their own
unique personalities.
Come to think of it, "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" when compared to
"Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery" is almost like Dr. Evil when
compared to Mini-Me. It's an identical copy, but bigger and powerful.

Having dealt with the major issue at hand, Sir Critic's attention turned to
another film closely associated with "The Phantom Menace"-"Austin Powers: The
Spy Who Shagged Me." Since the trailer suggested "If you see only one movie
this summer, see 'Star Wars.' But if you see two movies, see 'Austin Powers.'"
Sir Critic decided to take that advice.
"How on earth do you review a film that defies criticism like this one does?"
the other critical types asked the knight.
"It's very simple. You simply ask, 'Is it funny?' and since this is a sequel,
"Does it live up to the original?" My answers are 'yes' to both questions.
"Simply put, if you liked the first movie, you are bound to like the second. It
is more of the same juvenile/pop culture humor, done on a slightly larger scale
since they had a slightly larger budget. The scenes with Dr. Evil and the
crowd-pleasing Mini-Me are especially funny.  Mike Myers ought to be careful,
or Austin himself may fade from the picture.
"The major flaw of the film is that it relies a little too much on toilet
humor; the character of Fat Bastard was not amusing, but simply gross. I would
have run him through with my sword given half the chance. Gross by itself is
not funny, although I did like the series of jokes using different nicknames
for a certain unique part of the male anatomy."
The other critics cautioned, "Wait Sir Critic. You must imitate the language of
Austin Powers in a review. That is required by law."
"Oh behave, my friends, I'm far above that sort of thing."
And with that, Sir Critic had one of his few defeats.

AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME by DeWyNGaLe (John Sylva) Rating: B+
http://members.aol.com/DeWyNGaLe
Mike Myers, you certainly did throw us a frickin' bone here in what you call
the biggest Austin Powers adventure yet.'  Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged
me is the sequel to the 1997 smash comedy Austin Powers: International Man of
Mystery.  Many are skeptical about sequels, saying that the sequel is never
better or as good as the original, but Austin Powers: TSWSM goes beyond the
first film.
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me stars Mike Myers in three different
roles.  He reprises his role as the title character, Austin Powers, the
shagadelic spy whose body was frozen in 1967, and unfrozen in 1997 to stop his
long time nemesis Dr. Evil, also played by Mike Myers, from destroying the
earth.  TSWSM leaves off where the original stopped, with Dr. Evil's Frisch's
Big Boy' space capsule floating through space.  Dr. Evil returns back to earth
by ejecting from his capsule, plotting to go back in his time machine to the
year 1967, in which he plans to steal Austin Powers' "mojo", what keeps Austin
going with spy talents.  Upon his return to his secret lair, which is now a
Starbucks coffee shop, Dr. Evil learns that his evil henchman, which includes
the returning Robert Wagner as Number 2 and Mindy Sterling as Frau, have
created a 1/8 size clone of Dr. Evil, which is later named Mini Me.  The evil
Mini Me replaces Scott Evil, played by Seth Green, as Dr. Evil's son in the
madman's mind, because Dr. Evil thinks of Scott to be only "quasi-evil."  Dr.
Evil has always wanted a son that is evil just like him, and now he has one. 
Dr. Evil tells Mini Me, "You complete me," in a loving manner.  Dr. Evil
loving? Wow!  Mike Myers' third role is as Fat Bastard, a Scottish henchman of
Dr. Evil's, who is sent to steal the mojo from Austin Powers' frozen body.  
Austin Powers learns of Dr. Evil's trip back into the 60s, and uses his own
time machine to take him back to 1967, to try to save his mojo before Fat
Bastard gets a hold of it.  Once arriving in the year 1967, Austin travels to
his "pad", his smashing home/dance club, where he meets Felicity Shagwell,
played by Heather Graham, a CIA Agent who is willing to help him in his journey
to stop Dr. Evil.
As the film progresses, hilarious one liners are thrown at us, mainly by Dr.
Evil, for example, "Don't go there, girlfriend!" to the President of the United
States.  Many witty gags take place, note the entire tent scene, and just
plain, funny scenes which are so stupid- they're funny come a dozen per fifteen
minutes.  Take for example, Scott Evil going on The Jerry Springer Show
complaining about how evil his father is.  The way Austin Powers: TSWSM uses
its humor is clever, throwing a hilarious scene at you, followed by five
minutes of one liners, followed by another outrageous scene, so you never stop
laughing.  There was honestly not one moment in Austin Powers: TSWSM where I
wasn't laughing.  The last film that I laughed so hard in, was well, Austin
Powers!  It is apparent that Mike Myers knew how funny this film was while
writing it.  The film even makes fun of itself in a line, something along the
lines of, "It's funny how England and southern California look nothing alike." 
TSWSM was filmed in southern California, but was supposed to take place in
England.  I can tell you one thing- He is having a lot of fun with this
enormously popular character, which is all over television, newspapers,
magazines, and the movie theaters.
I believe that Dr. Evil got more attention in the TSWSM than Austin Powers did.
 Dr. Evil provided more laughs, more memorable moments, and more interesting
dialogue than Austin did this time around, who seems to missing the funny touch
that he had in the first film.  I felt that Austin really did have his mojo
taken away, but from screenplay writer Mike Myers, not Fat Bastard. 
Also making a great addition to the series is Mini Me, who is played by Verne
Troyer.  Even though the midget actor is 30 years old, he is adorable by Dr.
Evil's side constantly.
The first Austin Powers film had barely any sentimental quality, such as lack
of character development,  barely any detailed plot characteristics, and barely
any good acting, but Austin Powers TSWSM actually shows some quality behind the
frequent humor.  Mike Myers, with his three roles, acts as Eddie Murphy did in
The Nutty Professor, disguising himself completely in one of the roles. (Fat
Bastard) All three characters are different, and Mike Myers does do a good job
handling each one of them.  Heather Graham made a great addition with her
talent to TSWSM, and does a much better job than Elizabeth Hurley did, who gave
a very flat performance in the original, speaking her lines without any feeling
or emotion.  Speaking of Hurley, she can be seen in TSWSM for a few brief
moments.  Hopefully, Graham tags along for future Austin Powers adventures.
The Bottom Line- A groovy sequel that Mike Myers put all of his mojo into
writing.

AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME (1999)
After 95 minutes of Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, I was sure that
there was only 30 minutes of real comedy in this film.  The other 65
minutes is awfully unfunny filler material.  I admit I'm have a soft spot
for dumb-comedies, much like There's Something About Mary, but when the
makers of a dumb-comedy run out of comedy it's just dumb.
 he Spy Who Shagged Me starts off where Austin Powers: International Man of
Mystery finishes.  Austin (Mike Myers) Powers is faced with a surprise
attack by a familiar carry over character from the original film.  After
the attack he discovers that he's lost his `mojo'.  As it turns out, Dr.
Evil (Mike Myers) has created a time machine and has traveled back in time.
 And it is in the past that Dr. Evil has stolen Austin Power's mojo.  Dr.
Evil has a small sidekick this time around too, Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) who
is an exact duplicate of Dr. Evil only smaller.  A subplot involves Dr.
Evil's son who feels neglected by his father because his father is giving
more attention to Mini-Me.  Austin must recover his mojo, so he travels
back in time too.  When he arrives in the past, CIA agent Felicity (Heather
Graham) Shagwell joins him.  Together they set out to spoil Dr. Evil's
plans of world domination and to recover Austin's mojo.
My major complaint with this Austin Powers film is that it is purely
unfunny material punctuated by some intensely funny moments.  The film also
tries to get some laughs with crude jokes like the ones found in There's
Something About Mary, but for the most part these jokes fail in Austin
Powers.  The script by Mike Myers and Michael McCullers is bland, unfunny,
and way too long.  The direction by Jay Roach doesn't help either, his
pacing of the film is horrible, leaving me to look at my watch many times
during the showing wondering when the next laugh is or when the end is.
Myers plays a few of the characters in the film and does fine with most of
them.  He's nothing special on screen.  Heather Graham does what she can
with the Barbie Doll-like character she's given.  Her part requires nothing
but for her to prance around with a gun and costumes designed to show as
much cleavage as possible -- telling you just who the target audience of
this film is.  I enjoyed Graham's performances in other films, such as
Boogie Nights and even Lost in Space, but this film is just a terrible
waste of her talents.  The best thing about this film, and this is a hard
find in such an intolerable film, is Mini-Me.  This character is one the
funniest parts of the film and I enjoyed it.
One issue that bothered me with this film is the MPAA rating of the film as
a PG-13 film.  With the heavy sexual innuendo, some of it quite blatant
(like the rocket ship that Dr. Evil travels in), this film should have been
rated R.  But, I'm guessing that the producers of the film pulled some
strings to get a PG-13 rating so that the film could open to the target age
group: young impressionable boys who would understand some of the moronic
comedy in this film.  Still, this film shows just how MPAA ratings don't
fit some films.  If you're a parent and you have younger children wanting
to see this film, don't let them, this film is not appropriate for them.
No matter, this film invokes either a love or hate relationship with the
audience, I'm in the latter group.  A moronic film that is 30 minutes of
comedy and 65 minutes of filler material, this film is an abysmal entry
into the summer movie lineup.  Even if you're old enough to see this film,
Skip, Skip, Skip it.  Skip it in the theatres at full price, Skip it in the
theatres at matinee, and Skip it on video.  Austin Powers is shagless.

CAST
Mike Myers - Austin Powers / Dr. Evil / Fat Bastard
Heather Graham - Felicity Shagwell
Seth Green - Scott Evil
Robert Wagner - Number Two
Rob Lowe - Young Number Two
Verne Troyer - Mini Me
Michael York - Basil Exposition
Mike Myers is at it again, creating a sequal to the horrible "Austin Powers:
International Man of Mystery". This is another one of those rare cases where
the sequal actually surpasses the original (See: "I Still Know what you did
Last Summer"). Unfortunatly, it's not a whole lot better. It simply has a few
more humorous moments than the last one did (which I'm afraid isn't saying
much).
The year is 1999, and Austin is with his new wife Vanessa. Vanessa turns out to
be a robot working for Dr. Evil however, and tries to kill Austin.  Austin
escapes, and so has Dr. Evil we find out. Evil gets his organization up and
running courtesy of stock he owns in Starbuck's. He then decides to get rid of
Austin by stealing his Mojo (it's never clearly explained what this is). With
Austin out of the way, he will be able to destroy cities with his orbiting
laser platform. Austin, sans mojo, teams up with a C.I.A. agent named Felicity
Shagwell and goes after Evil.
The majority of the film takes place back in the sixties. For some strange
reason, Dr. Evil finds it neccessary to switch back in forth through time. Evil
has also created a clone of himself, one eighth his size which he names "Mini
Me". Mini Me actually provides a considerable amount of the film's humor.
The movie certainly isn't without its funny moments. In fact, almost any scene
which contains Dr. Evil, Mini Me, or Scott Evil (Seth Green) is quite amusing.
One of the funniest, in fact, would have to be when the doctor and Scott get in
a father / son spat on Jerry Springer at the beginning of the film.  Mini Me is
hilarious just about whenever he's on screen. The real problem is when Austin
himself shows up, and the movie's humor slows way down. Most of the jokes
Austin makes fall dead immediatly, While others start to build, and are
suddenly dropped. Another large problem, is that quite a few jokes, many of
them pretty bad to begin with, are reused over and over again. 
As for the characters, obviously most of them from the original have returned,
but two new ones have been added: Mini Me, and Fat Bastard. Mini Me is an
absolute riot, but Fat Bastard (Mike Myers under gobs of makeup) seems to be
there to do nothing more than disgust the audience and give oppurtunities for
poop jokes. Another problem is Heather Gragham. Now, I know this obviously
isn't an actor driven movie, but she is terrible. She looks embarassed to even
be in the film half the time, and the other half she's switching back and forth
between being chipper for no reason, and being serious.
All in all, there are some very amusing moments, but the majority of the movie
falls dead. If you liked the original, you'll probably enjoy this one. If you
didn't, beware. The film is more or less a rehash. Oh, and don't eat before
hand, because I guarantee Fat Bastard will have you feeling a little queezy.
* * * * * - One of the greatest movies ever made, see it now.
* * * * - Great flick, try and catch this one.
* * * - Okay movie, hits and misses.
* * - Pretty bad. See it if you've got nothing better to do.
* - One of the worst movies ever. See it only if you enjoy pain.

I walked into the second Austin Powers movie prepared to write a scathingly
bad review.  I was ready to deploy my army of poison pens -- er, make that
poison pixels -- in opposition to the overwhelming, shattering avalanche of
stupidity I knew to be coming.  I entered the theater totally prepared for
a never-ending cycle of potty jokes, sniggering references to body parts,
and gags drawn out far enough past their normal life expectancy to make an
actuary cry.  And I wasn't a bit disappointed.
Most people who liked the first Austin Powers movie won't be disappointed,
either.  Mike Myers dons the geeky glasses, the dead-weasel hairpiece, the
horribly bad bridgework, the fake chestal hair, the frilly lace cravat and
the velvet suit to duel Dr. Evil and save the world yet again.  Along the
way -- and this is the sort of movie where "along the way" matters more
than anything else -- Austin mugs, grimaces, shags, cavorts around naked,
and generally acts annoying.  Alternatively, the movie presents Myers as
Dr. Evil, who combines the worst features of Ernst Blofeld and Ed Sullivan.
I am not inclined to argue with people who think these characters are
funny, and will merely state that this sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
If the Powers and Evil characters share one trait, it is their mammoth,
gargantuan narcissism. The real battle in The Spy Who Shagged Me isn't
between the forces of evil and good, it's between Myers's ego and his
generosity.  This movie could easily have been a Mike Myers extravaganza of
self love, with all other comic possibilities squeezed out.  Fortunately,
though, the forces of good make some inroads here that weren't made in
Austin Powers:  International Man of Mystery.  The Spy Who Shagged Me is a
better movie because Myers is a little more willing to share the wealth and
spread out the good lines more evenly.  This allows the focus to be taken
off the Powers/Evil duality occasionally and allows a little bit of genuine
humor to sneak in now and then.
Consider the treatment of the female leads in both movies.  Elizabeth
Hurley was perfectly cast as Austin's sidechick in the first movie (she's
the perfect casting choice for every movie she's ever been in) but the
spotlight wasn't really ever on Our Liz.  Hurley shows up momentarily in
The Spy Who Shagged Me and is generously given one of the truly funny lines
in the movie -- not much, but one more than she had before.
In comparison, the lovely Heather Graham as CIA agent Felicity Shagwell
redeems the entire movie.  In a movie season replete with special effects,
the sight of Heather Graham in a micro-miniskirt is still the best piece of
eye candy around.  Felicity is smart, dangerous, absolutely ravishing, and
has a way with the sexy one liner.  "You're light on your feet," Austin
raves as they dance.  "I'm pretty light off my feet, too," says the
shagadelic Felicity, in a tone calculated to make a man's knees turn to
jelly.  This is Heather Graham's happening, baby, and it's groovy, man.
Seth Green had a marginal part in the first movie as Scott Evil, but he
stole the show with his criticism of his old man's megalomaniacal ways.
Green gets a little more time to shine here, imparting a little bit of
Generation X common sense to the Sixties silliness. There's still too
strong of a strain of whiny brat in his performance, but he's got the
adolescent sneer down pat.  When Dr. Evil dubs his newest plan to destroy
the world "The Alan Parsons Project", Green is there to poke wicked fun; "I
can't wait for Project Bananarama."
Unfortunately, the wealth isn't shared all that equally.  Rob Lowe, who was
so good in Wayne's World, is well-cast as a young Robert Wagner but gets
little to do.  (One wishes that Wayne Campbell would make a cameo
appearance, if only to remind us how babelicious Heather Graham is.)
Kristen Johnson disappears in the second reel, which is too bad -- she's
got the Natasha Fatale accent down pat.
I thought The Spy Who Shagged Me was quite a bit funnier than the
original.  Most of the comedy takes place below the waist, but now and
again there's a funny bit that provides a respite from the onslaught of
bathroom and sex jokes.  It's still not that great, though.  (The biggest
reaction I heard from the audience was when Austin's own Willie Nelson
showed up in a cameo.)  Your inner fifteen-year-old will be happy to see
see The Spy Who Shagged Me, but those looking for more sophisticated humor
should stay away and avoid further disappointment.

Vannesa Kensington: `Austin, do you smoke after sex?'
Austin Powers: `I don't know baby, I've never looked!'
And so begins our journey into the most anticipated sequel of the summer
season. Austin Powers 2, the sequel to the sleeper hit of 1997, is
filled to the brim with uproarious sight gags and lurid toilet jokes
that will make you keel over with hilarity. The mind of Mike Myers is
obviously a very bizarre place.
Myers returns as the swinging 60's spy and his arch-nemesis, the bald
headed Dr. Evil, who is given much of the spotlight here. There's an
early scene in which Dr. Evil and his son Scott (Seth Green) appear on a
Jerry Springer segment entitled `My Dad is Evil and Wants to Take Over
the World', hosted by Springer himself. Most of these talk-show gags,
spoofing everything from Oprah to Regis and Kathie Lee, are no longer as
funny as they once were. Happily, this is an exception, especially when
a fight breaks out between Dr. Evil and the other guests. (Sample
dialogue- `Come back here you mother #@%$^!! You want a piece of me?')
The audience was in stitches.
There are many good things about this sequel. Dr. Evil is now assisted
by Mini-Me (Verne Troyer), a pint-sized clone who is the result of an
experiment gone awry. Mini-Me is the most perfect new character that any
fan could ask for, and Troyer does a terrific job of mimicking
everything that his big brother does, pinkie and all. Mindy Sterling
returns as Frau Farbissina, Evil's loud-mouth assassin sidekick, and
here we are treated to a brief romantic liaison between the two in an
underground bedroom chamber. This works surprisingly well. Afterward,
there's even a meeting at the coffee machine, where their awkwardness is
expressed in a scene you would expect in any normal office environment.
Oh, yes... the plot. After a short honeymoon with Vanessa Kensington
(Elizabeth Hurley) that goes disastrously wrong, Powers is back on the
case to thwart the diabolical plans of Dr. Evil. In the original, the
subject of the day was cryogenic freezing that enabled the characters to
hop between two time periods. Here, it's time travel. Dr. Evil has this
crazy plan to steal Austin's mojo (the source of his sexual powers), so
he jumps through a time portal back into 1969 when Powers is still is
his freezing chamber. There, he employs a grotesque 600-pound Scottish
assassin named Fat Bastard (also Myers) to commandeer the mojo, so that
our future hero is left completely shagless.
Meanwhile, Austin is informed of Evil's wrong-doing by Basil Exposition
(Michael York), and is supplied with his very own time-traveling device
in the form of a Volkswagen Beetle. Once back in 1969, Powers meets a
foxy CIA operative named Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham), and learns
of Dr. Evil's plans to destroy Washington DC with a lazer on the moon.
In one of the many uproarious jabs at Star Wars, Evil calls the moon
base a `Death Star'. If there ever was a movie that knew from the start
it was a complete joke, it's Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.
AP2 has many hilarious moments, much more so, than the original Austin
Powers. But what it doesn't have is the confident support system that
the first boasted, and the jokes are now more scattershot and
hit-and-miss. While Myers has a knack for delivering clever, inspired
gags, he sometimes doesn't know when to call it quits. The hilarious
scene in the original involving Mustafa (Will Ferrell) and his refusal
to die is played out here in a disappointing and tired manner. Robert
Wagner, as Dr. Evil's #2 man, has only one scene early on in the film,
where he lacks all the focus of the character. One nice surprise is Rob
Lowe, as the young #2, who patterns Wagner's voice and movements right
down to a tee.
There are more recycled jokes from the predecessor, including Kristen
Johnston as Ivana Humpalot (an unfunny rendition of Alotta Fagina). But
Myers has clearly put so much dedication into this project, and many
bits are side-splittingly funny. Don't miss an extended visual gag in a
tent, where the shadows leave much to the imagination....
Of the new characters, Graham doesn't leave much of an impression. Her
performance is merely okay, and she lacks the gung-ho enthusiasm that
made Elizabeth Hurley so enjoyable before her. And as for Fat Bastard...
well, he provides one or two hilarious moments, but all of the obesity
jokes and bathroom talk go too far.
But my most severe complaint: Mr. Bigglesworth was only in one scene!!
But, with gritted teeth, I managed to get over that. This sequel will
not leave fans disappointed; it's more often than not a laugh riot. And,
I look optimistically to the future, where I foresee more installments
to the Austin Powers collection. If Myers can up the quota of fresh
ideas, we should be in store for much more.

     I did an article the week before this came out defending parody movies.
In retrospect, I believe I should have picked another time to defend them.
Austin Powers: The Spy who Shagged Me, a thoroughly ridiculous film, falls
victim to the curse of comedies everywhere: the plot becomes a vehicle for
the jokes.
     Early on in the movie, as Austin Powers (Mike Myers) is about to travel
back in time in order to thwart the plans of Dr. Evil (also Mike Myers), he
unearths a major plothole in the movie and tries to bring it up to a Q-like
figure in the movie.  This person playfully intones.  "I suggest you don't
worry about things like that."  Then he turns to the audience and says.
"That goes for you, too."  This kind of laissez-faire attitude towards the
plot is carried on throughout the remainder of the film.  Every plot hole is
ignored, every glitch bypassed with a trite device, and every sense of plot
direction lost.
     For this reason, telling you the plot of the movie is a moot point,
considering that the entire plot doesn't matter at all in relation to the
jokes.  The jokes just pop up out of nowhere.  Some of them are funny, some
of them aren't.  The majority of them just basically take up time.
     A higher percentage of the jokes are funnier than in the first Austin
Powers, but this one has the same tiring, trite humor that James Bond can
pull off but Austin Powers can't.  It has a genius sequence describing a
rather... odd shaped spaceship, a fine part in which "The Jerry Springer
Show" is rather effectively parodied, and a continuation of the highly
demented psychodrama that makes up the relationship between Scott Evil (Seth
Green of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" fame) and Dr. Evil, but the film in and
of itself remains nothing but a vehicle for these jokes to travel in.
     Because these jokes seem just stuck in, you never really get into the
characters (Heather Graham's Felicity Shagwell being the exception, but I
have a thing for that actress and have had a thing for her since Drugstore
Cowboy), so, when the jokes are made, you don't really laugh as much as you
normally would.  If fact, you don't really laugh much at all.  It's more of
a chuckle film.
     In the effort to fit in so many good jokes, the film drags its feet
like a man on the night before his wedding.  It really doesn't want to go.
Add to this list of things that this film lacks: Inertia.  Other things that
it also lacks are characters, good actors, true intelligence, and the
special zing that makes a parody film worthwhile.
     I'm not going to turn around and bash parody films, as I'm sure
everyone else who is giving Austin Powers: The Spy who Shagged Me the
lackluster reviews it deserves will be doing.  Instead, I make the
suggestion that this film would be much, much better as a stand-up comedy
sketch.  In a stand up sketch, you don't really need plot, only direction
and a target, both of which Austin Powers have in abundance.  Myers, an SNL
veteran and a fine stand up comedian, would have done fine with that... but
no.  Instead, I had to sit through 95 minutes of good jokes stuck in a very,
very bad movie.

Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999)
Directed by Jay Roach
Written by Mike Myers
Starring Mike Myers, Heather Graham, Mindy Sterling, Seth Green, Robert Wagner,
Rob Lowe, Elizabeth Hurley
It makes perfect sense why Mike Myers decided to make another "Austin Powers"
film.         The original was a box office hit which introduced new phrases into
our pop-culture vocabulary. It made Mike Myers an independent household name
without the accompaniment of Dana Carvey or the black baseball cap and the torn
blue jeans he wore in "Wayne's World". With "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged
Me", Myers has permanently left his name on a select list of comedic geniuses
of the 1990's. Genius is an appropriate word. Only geniuses would use the same
jokes that earned them big bucks in the past for future events. This strategy
takes advantage of the pleasures of target audiences and gets as much money as
it can out of these viewers until their act grows tiresome. Myers has followed
this lucrative code by appearing as his Austin Powers creation in a number of
ads, an MTV awards show, a Madonna music video, a trivia computer game and now
in the sequel "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me". Luckily for him, his
British spy has not grown tiresomeyet. 
The sequel is almost a carbon copy of the original. The same characters and the
same gags are used in both films. In the sequel, however, the jokes are taken
to a higher level meaning the duration of time each joke requires to execute is
a bit longer. This makes the film enjoyable but it leaves an uncomfortable
feeling of déjŕ vu. Although the title ostensibly suggests that Austin Powers
is the star of the film, Mike Myers' second creation, Dr. Evil, is the main
focus of the film with numerous jokes, one after the other. Austin's titular
character is just a formulaic character who inevitably gets the girl and saves
the day. Dr. Evil is also formulaic indeed, as he is destined to attempt to
take over the world but fail in the last ten minutes, but he is responsible for
the true laughs in the film. His clueless rhetoric on how to use slang in his
sentences is very memorable. He's just trying to fit in. When he incorrectly
makes a statement or when he embarrasses himself physically, he uses his
powerful status to try to prove what he is doing is right, no matter how wrong
he is. For example, when he gets some foam from his Starbucks drink on his nose
and chin, Dr. Evil immediately replies, once realizing it is there, that that
is how they drink it in Belgium. "We call it the Belgium Dip." Dr. Evil is so
frightening that no one could argue with him. What is so amusing is Dr. Evil, a
supposedly powerful and audacious, is like a little Teddy Bear, innocuous and
fearful. In order to hide this secret, Dr. Evil hires a number of hilarious
henchmen. Mustafa (Will Ferrell) plays a hit-man who can not stand to be asked
a question three times in a row. Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) is an exact replica of
Dr. Evil, except he is one eighth of his size. Fat Bastard (also played by
Myers) weighs a metric ton who eats because he is sad and is sad because he
eats. These characters are all highlights of the film as they add their own
unique personalities.
Come to think of it, "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" when compared to
"Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery" is almost like Dr. Evil when
compared to Mini-Me. It's an identical copy, but bigger and more powerful.

Following a sneak preview for "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me," 
several friends asked my opinion of the comedy. When I shrugged it off as 
merely "okay," the disappointment and annoyance in their eyes was 
unmistakable. Like so many others, they were psyched up for this sequel 
to the 1997 spoof and eager to play the "Austin Powers" game, tossing 
around catch phrases like "Yeah, baby, yeah," "shagadelic," and "Oh, 
behave!" Then along comes Movie Boy to rain on their parade.
I freely admit to being mystified over the immense popularity that has 
built up around "Austin Powers." A modest success when released 
theatrically, the film went on to become a huge hit on video. Perhaps 
repeated viewings add to the enjoyment of the absurdist humor. Whatever. 
I watched the original only once and found it intermittently funny, but 
too thin to warrant a second look. I feel the same way about the sequel. 
Packed with gags -- some clever, many lame and almost all puerile -- the 
film has too many dead spots between the laughs, and I caught myself 
checking my watch almost as often as I chuckled. In other words, "Austin 
Powers 2" is "okay."
But "okay" isn't good enough for fans caught up in Powers-mania. While 
many have complained about the unrelenting hype for "Star Wars: The 
Phantom Menace," few seem bothered by the massive barrage of ads for this 
film. Granted, some of the commercials are a hoot, but still, the 
ubiquitous advertising campaign left me tired of Mike Myers face long 
before entering the theater.
When giving advice to student reviewers at seminars, I urge them to avoid 
the inclusion of lengthy plot descriptions, explaining that writers who 
do so are generally disinterested in the film and merely using a long 
synopsis as a lazy way to pad the word count of their article. With that 
in mind, here is a lengthy plot description of "Austin Powers: The Spy 
Who Shagged Me."
The film begins in 1999, with freeze-dried '60s super-spy Powers (Mike 
Myers, who also plays Dr. Evil, a Scottish thug called Fat Bastard, and a 
'60s guru) honeymooning with Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley) when 
he discovers that his new bride is actually a "fembot" with a bomb 
planted in her noggin. Single again, Powers learns that his nemesis, Dr. 
Evil, has returned from outer space with a new diabolical scheme to wreck 
havoc. Using a time machine (with enjoyably cheesy visuals straight out 
of "The Time Tunnel"), Dr. Evil travels back to 1969 and steals Austin 
Powers' "mojo," leaving the oh-so-groovy secret agent impotent in all 
senses of the word.
But, thanks to British Intelligence, Austin Powers also has access to a 
time machine, in the form of a psychedelic Volkswagen Beetle (his travel 
mode echoes that of the "Back to the Future" trilogy). So he returns to 
the Swinging Sixties to regain his virility and stop Dr. Evil from 
destroying the world. Along the way, Powers picks up a new love interest, 
American CIA operative Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham), who joins him 
on his biggest adventure yet. 
NOTE: The preceding plot description ate up 188 words -- not bad, not bad 
at all.
In "Austin Powers'" scattershot screenplay are a number of undeniably 
entertaining scenes. Dr. Evil's son Scott (Seth Green) appears on a Jerry 
Springer Show episode titled "My Father Is Evil and Wants to Take Over 
the World," only to have his dad make a surprise appearance that, 
naturally, leads to a brawl. Jerry Springer segments in movies have been 
done to death, but this one is nicely-executed and plays well. 
A particularly witty scene has Powers addressing the audience directly, 
saying "You know what's amazing is how England looks in no way like 
southern California" just prior to a fight obviously set in the southern 
California hills, with a red British phone booth incongruously placed on 
the side of the road for "authenticity." 
My favorite bit shows Dr. Evil piloting a spaceship that resembles male 
genitalia, with rapid-cuts of various characters' reactions to the sight 
(a radar operator says "It looks like a giant..." then the film cuts to a 
fighter pilot shouting "Dick! Dick, look out to starboard!" and so forth).
 The sequence is juvenile as hell and very funny.
A lot of the movie falls flat, however. Endless segues of a go-go dancing 
Powers grow tiresome, and Heather Graham lacks comic spark. The visuals 
of Dr. Evil's tiny clone, Mini-Me (Verne Troyer), are amusing, but 
Troyer's limited acting skills mute the humorous potential. A reprise of 
a hilarious scene from the first film, depicting Austin frolicking nude 
with objects strategically placed to cover his "naughty parts," fails to 
amuse because you can see the "Cops"-style optical blur placed over his 
genitals.
Of course, "Austin Powers" is a critic-proof movie. Fans will drink in 
every second, quote the catch-phrases like crazy and wonder why a spoil-
sport like me bothered to critique their movie.

Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.
     First, this must be said:  I was wrong about the original AUSTIN
POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY.  In 1997, I gave the film an
unenthusiastic 5 out of 10, noting that writer/star Mike Myers'
infatuation with old "Saturday Night Live" sketches and characters blunted
the truly inspired comic moments.  I'm still pretty comfortable with my
rating, though a recent second viewing suggested I may have been slightly
stingy (Dr. Evil alone is too hilarious not to warrant at least a mild
recommendation).  No, I was wrong in a suggestion I made for improvement.  
I thought AUSTIN POWERS might have worked better as a pure 1960s period
piece rather than a fish-out-of-water comedy with shagadelic, cryogenic
secret agent Austin Powers (Myers) coping with 1990s life when he's thawed
out to battle old nemesis Dr. Evil (also Myers).  AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY
WHO SHAGGED ME proves that a different temporal setting wouldn't have
changed anything, because Myers used a different temporal setting and
_didn't_ change anything. 
     Those familiar with the original -- mostly from its spectacular
second life on video -- will recall that we left Dr. Evil drifting through
space in his Big Boy rocket while Austin honeymooned with agent Vanessa
Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley).  Both the Big Boy and Vanessa are quickly
dispatched to set Dr. Evil on his latest plan, which requires getting
Austin out of the way.  His fiendish plot involves traveling back through
time to 1969 to steal from the still-frozen Austin the source of all his
Powers:  his mojo.  Faster than you can say Basil Exposition (Michael 
York), Austin has a time machine of his own, and pops back to swinging
London.  There he teams up with CIA operative Felicity Shagwell (Heather
Graham) to recapture the mojo in question and prevent something evil from
happening.
     The exact nature of that something evil is, of course, entirely
beside the point.  THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME is at its goofy best when it's
most self-aware, mocking film conventions of all sorts.  Austin and 
Felicity drive through the "English Countryside" while noting "it's
amazing how much England looks in no way like Southern California;"
concerns about physics of time travel are dismissed with an admonishment
to the audience to do the same.  Myers can be utterly brilliant working
with incongruous situations, as when he follows a romantic liaison between
Dr. Evil and co-worker-in-evil Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling) with an
awkward "morning after" meeting at the underground lair's coffee machine.
When Myers finds a comic target -- Starbucks, the music of the 80s, STAR
WARS' opening narrative crawl -- he knows how to use it.
     He also doesn't know how to _stop_ using it.  The original AUSTIN
POWERS was at its most wearying when Myers took a joke and beat all
semblance of life out of it for several agonizing minutes.  He's at it
again this time, and he's using identical gags he already exhausted in the
previous film.  Once again, a naked Austin's naughty bits are hidden
strategically by other (usually phallic) objects; once again, Dr. Evil
engages in a binge of pre-emptively shushing his son Scott (Seth Greene);
once again, Austin makes several exaggerated, James Bond-like puns
referring to a villain's demise.  Even the original's best sequence -- the
Evil family therapy session -- is revisited as a "Jerry Springer" episode. 
And when Myers does come up with a new concept, he still insists on using
it twice, or twice as long as necessary.  We've all come to expect sequels
that recycle huge chunks of the original, usually in the action genre.
When a satirical comedy loses its sense of discovery, there's not much
reason for it to exist.
     The one major change is the 1969 setting, though there doesn't seem
to be much point to it.  The best reason for putting Austin back in his
element is to watch him be his lascivious, un-self-conscious self through
contemporary eyes.  Unfortunately, the plot turns him into a mojo-impaired
90s guy worried about his relationship, leaving the setting-specific humor
to a few Dr. Evil anachronisms.  There are some other new twists -- the
diminutive Dr. Evil clone Mini-Me (Verne Troyer); Rob Lowe doing a dead-on
Robert Wagner impression as the young Number 2; Myers finding a way to do
another character _and_ work in his beloved Scottish accent as the grossly
obese, aptly named Fat Bastard -- that hit and miss.  Mostly, it's a lot
more of the same.  That's a good thing when we're talking about Dr. Evil,
still looking for super-villain respect while dealing with a complicated
personal life.  That's a bad thing when we're talking about making the
same mistakes twice.  AUSTIN POWERS fans will surely be ready to forgive
Myers' lapses in imagination.  Others will be left trying to figure out
where this promising series could actually reach its potential.  Maybe the
1950s next time?

AUSTIN POWERS 2: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME
   A movie need not have a tightly-wound, unified plot to
work.  One recent film--a critically underrated box office flop 
--functioned like a series of Saturday Night Live sketches and
was laugh-a-minute funny throughout.  I speak of Mike
Judge's Dilbert-like "Office Space," which should have been a
hoot for those in the audience who make their living in
offices.  Mike Judge arrays in their cubicles crunching
numbers and doing assorted jobs which are not in the least
as meaningful as the genuinely productive deeds that
muscular guys accomplish on the street with their drills,
hammers, and saws.  The basis for its rich humor is its
grounding in reality.  Although as distorted as a Hirschfield
caricature, "Office Space" reveals the emotional truths that
inhabit the souls of so many guys and gals who trudge to
their metal desks in Kafkaesque rooms shuffling papers that
only wind up in the circular file.
   "Austin Powers 2: The Spy Who Shagged Me," similarly a
series of sketches, has virtually no basis in reality.  Even that
defect could be compensated for if the humor were not so
sophomoric, repetitive, just plain unfunny.  Despite the
abundant scatological references and allusions to the penis,
"Austin Powers 2" cannot even boast of its potential to offend
anyone to the left of the Ayatollahs.  Too bad the script is not
up to the acting ability of Mike Myers, who wowed his
aficionados in the (also underrated) "So I Married an Ax
Murderer," which found the humorist in multiple roles as well. 
He was almost unrecognizable when he affected a deep
Scottish brogue in the guise of his own father.
   Where "Office Space" holds a thesis--that work is a
travesty that kills the human spirit--"Austin Powers 2" simply
relies on scattershot gags loosely tied together by two
doctrines: 1) that most advertising and a great deal of TV are
largely ridiculous.  Then again, we knew that ever since we
were 4 years old and began spoofing the silly commercials
ourselves.  2) Much is made of the paradox that the private
parts of the human body are at once the source of sexual
turn-ons and the root of the most vulgar of excretory activity.
   The film jumps freely back and forth from 1999 to 1969 as
Dr. Evil (Mike Myers in his glabrous guise) plots to destroy
master spy Austin Powers (Mike Myers in his Carnaby Street
aspect).  Powers had been freeze-dried and, thawed out in
the 90s is now honeymooning with his bride, Vanessa
(Elizabeth Hurley), who turns out to be other than the person
he expected.  In the catchies scene of the entire work,
Vanessa asks, "Do you smoke after sex"? Powers replies, "I
don't know.  I never look."  The way Powers discovers that
his wife is a fembot is a gem.  While Powers ducks the
fussilades aimed at him by his stripped-down wife,  Dr. Evil
enters his time machine to return to 1969 with the aim of
stealing Powers' "mojo," which, loosely translated, is the
groovy guy's libido.
   Unlike "International Man of Mystery," this version treats
the eponymous spy as a all-around swinger and idol and not
as the nerdy oddball he portrayed two years ago.  Largely a
send-up of the James Bond series, the movie shows our hero
fixing a cup of coffee not in the manner of Sean Connery
(who could make a cappuccino in one-quarter the time of the
typical Starbuck's clerk today) but mistakenly pouring the
contents of a cup of stool sample into his cup and later
comparing the taste to that of almonds.
   There are some cute cameos, as of Burt Bacharach and
Elvis Costello, of Woody Harrelson and of Tim Robbins, but
the biggest surprise of all is in the actor who plays a
repulsive 400-pound Scotsman known as Fat Bastard. 
Heather Graham as Bond's CIA-based girl friend does not
have the sophistication or dazzling good looks of Liz Hurley,
but she has the talent for vaudevillian touches.  And Mike
Myers continues to charm.  I feel bad for him that he lacks a
more resonant script: the guy's a comic genius who can
charm the pants off even an adult audience.  But this time
around he's in yet another vehicle that does not adequately
exploit his flair for comedy, particularly his almost unique
ability to assume multiple roles with vaudevillian abandon.

(Felicity Shagwell), Seth Green (Scott Evil), Michael York (Basil 
Exposition); written by Mike Myers, Michael McCullers; produced by John S. 
Lyons, Demi Moore, Mike Myers, Jennifer Todd, Suzanne Todd; directed by M. 
Jay Roach.
Seen June 14, 1999 at 7:45 p.m. at Crossgates Cinema 18 (Guilderland, N.Y.), 
theater #15, with Shawn O'Shea for free using my Hoyts season pass. [theater 
rating: ****: excellent seats, sound and picture].
        I'm not sure if anyone else besides me has actually read my 
`Disclaimer' on my web page, but it's basically a list of rules I set for 
myself in how I view movies and write my reviews. Well, it's not often that I 
break my own rules, but in order to properly analyze and review `Austin 
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,' I must say that it's a film I've formed an 
opinion on based on seeing it four times and also as to how the audiences 
with whom I saw it reacted.
        Those two rules are just part of my own theory on film and film 
criticism. I believe a movie should be judged by how it seems to you the 
first time you see it. If there's a lot of subtlety and complex storylines 
going on, you should be able to follow and comprehend them all on first 
viewing. Also, I believe when you see a film for the first time it should 
have the same effect on you whether you're watching it in a cinema, on home 
video, alone or with a large audience. 
        Of course that's just some of my `idealist film critic' theories to 
establish my integrity, psychologists and sociologists would probably argue 
otherwise on some of these points (and other critics might too).
        How it all relates to my take on this film is in these two ways: 
firstly, I saw it four times and loved it the first three times and just 
plain liked it the fourth time; and secondly, I saw it with large audiences 
who laughed hysterically the first three times and with a semi-large audience 
who laughed a lot, but not as much as the other larger audiences.
        You might be thinking what's the point of all this since I've written 
four paragraphs and haven't even discussed the film itself yet. Well dear 
readers, the point is this: `Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me' is in and 
of itself a very, very, very funny and enjoyable movie, but what makes it 
better than being a just plain good flick is the fact that it does hold up on 
repeated viewings and that half the fun of seeing it is the atmosphere of the 
audience - a large group of people who, just like you, have plunked down a 
few beans to stare at a screen for 95 minutes and just have a good time: 
that's exactly the reason the entertainment industry exists.
        It became clear to me just 20 minutes into this film that writing a 
review of it that accurately summed up and analyzed the film would be 
difficult, if not impossible. It's a comedy that fires off the jokes, the 
gags, the zaniness and the fun like an Uzi fires bullets. It does have some 
general comedic styles to it but even I would have a hard time trying to 
define them all. Satirical? Yes. Witty? Yes. Gross? Yes. Original? Yes. 
Stupid? Yes (but in a good way).        
        To quickly go over the premise, this is the sequel to 1997's `Austin 
Powers: International Man Of Mystery,' a funny farce about a British spy-guy 
named Austin Powers (Myers), who is frozen in 1967 and returns 30 years later 
to battle his nemesis Dr. Evil (also Myers). Powers is basically James Bond's 
dorky little brother - he's not suave, he's not attractive (those bad teeth 
jokes consistently work every time), he's not always playing with a full 
deck, yet his charm lies in Myers' ability to make the guy so freaking funny.
        Since this is a summer blockbuster flick, it's not surprising the 
tone of the film isn't quite as smart as the original, and that the comedy 
comes in a rapid-fire succession to cater to the modern audience's short 
attention span. Normally, I'd have a problem with that (consider 1998's 
`Armageddon'), but since everything we get here is so unbelievably funny it's 
forgivable for the most part (Myers' screenplay may get all the jokes right, 
but his execution of plot and story could definitely use some work).
        The story goes like this: Dr. Evil, who froze himself and launched 
himself into space at the end of the last movie returns to Earth only two 
years later to hatch another scheme to, well, be evil. Dr. Evil realizes he 
can't beat Austin Powers because he lacks `mojo' and decides to travel back 
to 1969 to steal Powers' mojo while he was still cryogenically frozen. Powers 
and his boss, Basil Exposition (York) at the Ministry of Defence, realize 
this and develop a time machine of their own and thus Powers goes back in 
time to get back his mojo and stop Dr. Evil's latest scheme which involves 
shooting a giant laser at Earth from the moon.
        That's pretty much all there is to the actual plot of the film which 
amazingly allows for such funny and outrageous situations as well as the 
occasional spoof and satire.
        Here's where my aforementioned problem lies: how do I even begin to 
breakdown and analyze the comedy without leaving out any of the best and most 
important jokes? To list only a few would be an injustice for fear of making 
them seem only mildly funny on paper (or on a computer screen as is the case 
here). How do I convince the non-viewer of the film's high entertainment 
value?
        I guess I can sum it all up by saying Myers set out to make a fun 
movie and must have had a lot of fun in the process. Some comedies today are 
cruel and cynical and are based on shock value and testing society's ethics. 
Here, everything is done in good spirits, so that even when the comedy goes 
to the extreme, you can tell the filmmakers were having a great time 
producing it all. For a movie with jokes about accidentally drinking fecal 
matter; two freaky, ugly people having sex; the giant butt crack of a 
500-pound man covered in grease and filth; and eye-illusion  silhouette jokes 
about the insertion and removal of things from an anus, it's shocking but not 
too shocking. It's childish and stupid, but shown in a whole new light and is 
surprisingly funny.
        With this film Myers shows us a fresh face of mainstream comedy I've 
not seen since `Wayne's World' in 1992. Almost everything is a 
tongue-in-cheek reference to something else, whether is be within the film 
(such as Myers looking directly into the camera and telling the audience not 
to worry about the possible plot holes or how England looks in no way like 
southern California), or at modern society (such as Dr. Evil making his 
appearance on Earth known not by launching missiles at the Kremlin, but by 
appearing on `Jerry Springer').
        The modern society comedy is simply brilliant and really does go a 
long way to show how some things that might seem ordinary to some people can 
really be funny taken out of context. Dr. Evil's entire persona seems to be 
based on this idea here, as we see him rapping, seducing one of his female 
partners in crime, and just being a big cartoony villain. It's probably safe 
to say that he's one of the most likable villains in movie history and 
certainly one of the funniest, and we still never doubt his malice (after 
all, his name is Evil and he went to evil medical school).
        After seeing `Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,' for the first 
time, I read one some Internet newsgroups posts from people that hated it 
telling how they couldn't possibly understand how all the people around them 
laughed so much at what they considered rubbish. Technically, I could 
understand someone not liking the sense of humor the film conveys, but I 
can't imagine seeing this with an audience and not being swept up in the fun 
of it all. It's something I believe is so true in the case of  that if you 
don't like it, I'd say there's something wrong with you.

  This comedy sequel continues the satirical adventures of
"The International Man of Mystery," beginning with a James Bond'ish
theme as the "Star Wars"-inspired introduction scrolls up the
screen. In a nutshell: After Austin Powers (Mike Myers) discovers that
his beloved bride, Vanessa Carrington (Elizabeth Hurley), is really a
Fem-Bot (female robot), he is informed by the Head of British
Intelligence (Michael York) that fiendish Fat Bastard (Mike Myers),
the Scottish henchman of Dr. Evil (Mike Myers), has stolen his mojo
(his essence, his life force, his sex drive), using time travel
machine to go back to 1967 when Austin was cryogenically frozen. So
Austin has to go back to the swingin', shagadelic '60s to retrieve his
manhood. That's where he meets groovy CIA babe, Felicity Shagwell
(Heather Graham): "Shagwell by name. Shag-very-well by reputation." So
much for plot. Relying primarily on sight gags and toilet humor,
director Jay Roach desperately grabs laughs wherever he can find
them. And that includes a Jerry Springer Show riff in which Dr. Evil's
son (Seth Green) confronts his father, along with Nazi and Ku Klux
Klan sons, claiming: "My Father is Evil and Wants to Take Over the
World." What's new? Dr. Evil has a tiny clone, known as
Mini-Me. Robert Wagner and Rob Lowe play the '90s/ '60s versions of
Dr. Evil's second-in-command - and Rob does the best R.J. Wagner
impression I've ever seen!  Burt Bacharach, Elvis Costello, Tim
Robbins, Willie Nelson, and Woody Harrelson pop up in cameos. On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged
Me" is a goofy, sporadically funny, silly 6. Oh, behave! And stay for
the credits.

AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME **1/2 (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers ( shagme@filmfreakcentral.net )
I can't wait to revisit Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. 1997's
Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery failed to light up my life
the first time I saw it; I felt no urge afterwards to utter Austin's
catchphrases, among them "Yeah, baby, yeah" and "Shag-adelic!"
Subsequent viewings of the film somehow improved its comedy; by the
time I received Austin Powers... on DVD for Christmas, I was a
full-fledged fan. The Spy Who Shagged Me features as many guffaws as
its predecessor, but I left the screening feeling again amused but 
unenamoured.
This sequel picks up almost immediately where the first picture left
off. After the luminous Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley) makes a
startling revelation to Austin (Myers) during their honeymoon, the
superspy is off once again to do battle with Dr. Evil (also Myers).
This time, the bald, scarred, pale madman has devised a time machine, 
which he uses to go back to the sixties. There, with the aid of his
pint-size clone Mini-Me (Troyer) and an obese bagpiper (who eats
babies) named Fat Bastard (Myers, in repulsive make-up), he locates
Austin Powers' cryogenically frozen body and steals his mojo. Nineties
Austin is rendered impassive to espionage and randy women, so he
travels thirty years into the past to get his groove back. At his old
pad, he hooks up with sexy Felicity Shagwell (heart melting, doe-eyed
Graham), and together they search for Dr. Evil's volcanic lair.
Despite much crass humour that follows (including an endless anal sex
jape), The Spy Who Shagged Me is ultimately sweet. The film covers no
new ground in terms of homage to bygone spy thrillers, and very little
of the humour is innovative, but its genteel tone smoothes over the
laughless bumps.
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is only casually interested in
telling us a complete story. Mostly, it's a showcase for Myers' range
and improvisational skills. (Duh.) Austin, Dr. Evil, and Fat Bastard
are such distinct characters that one will not likely scan for
split-screen lines when any combination of them is on camera together.
"Distinct," however, doesn't necessarily mean "rich." Austin, for all
his signature attributes (the rotting teeth, the velvet suits, the
soundbite-ready dialogue), sends-up popular British TV and movie
secret agents who were never taken seriously in the first place. Watch
a swinger like "The Avengers"' John Steed (played with pursed-lip 
winkingness by Patrick Macnee in several incarnations) or the mod
criminals Steed pursued in action and you'll see prototypes for Austin
Powers rather than ripe targets for parody. Austin the man is a
one-note joke whose only real appeal is his promiscuity-it's been too
long since we've had a hero who lives and breathes for sex. (Aside: a 
naked Austin once again prances around buck naked, but his private
parts aren't so cleverly disguised in The Spy Who Shagged Me-in fact,
digital trickery appears to have erased them altogether.)
In other words, Austin is amusing but Dr. Evil is the star of this
show. Much funnier than Austin's non-sequitor gags, such as a lame
montage involving the Queen's guards set to "I'm a Believer," are Dr.
Evil's non-sequitor gags. It is through the desperately uncool Dr.
Evil that Myers and company skewer: the Jerry Springer show (in 
two very funny sequences-be sure to stay through the end credits);
1996's The Island of Dr. Moreau remake (Dr. Evil and Mini-Me perform a
hilarious piano duet of Joan Osborne's "One of Us"); Jerry Maguire;
time travel movies; and, of course, James Bond. There are also amusing
subplots involving Dr. Evil's sampling of Austin's mojo and the
strained relationship between the doctor and his logic-prone son,
Scott (Green). (As before, Scott is constantly told to shut up by his
father, here in umpteen variations on "zip it." My favourite: "Ladies
and gentlemen of the court, exzipit A.'")
The audience I watched it with cheered the antics of both Austin and
Dr. Evil. (Perhaps I will, too, one day.) Based on crowd reaction, The
Spy Who Shagged Me will see smashing box office returns. While I have
reservations about recommending it, I would never begrudge it of
success.

'Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me' (1999)
'Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me' is one of the most schizophrenic
films I've ever seen.  They thrown in some new characters that work and some
that don't.  Between the three characters that Mike Myers plays, one is
horrible, one is excellent and one is somewhere in the middle.  Throw in a
leading lady with a poor sense of comic timing and given very little
direction, and this sequel to the 1997 film caught me by surprise with just
how tastelessly bizarre and unfunny it actually is in many places.
The film opens pretty much where it left off and Dr. Evil (Mike Myers
character #1) is making a return to the Earth where he plots revenge against
Austin Powers (Mike Myers character #2) for foiling his plot in the first
film.  Austin and his new bride Vanessa (Elizabeth Hurley in a brief cameo
in bizarre contrast to the first film) are on their honeymoon when things go
awry and from there we learn that Dr. Evil's plan is to go back to 1967, the
time when both he and Austin Powers were both cryogenically frozen in the
first film, and steal Austin's "mojo".  This is apparently a chemical
compound that gives Austin his groove, his swinging sense of style and his
ability to do his job as a super agent with these qualities intact.  Once
weakened, Dr. Evil will attempt to blackmail world forces out of 100 billion
dollars or he will turn his deadly laser gun loose on the Earth from outer
space and will start by destroying Washington, D.C.
Dr. Evil's plan is to add some new and somewhat lethal characters to his
roster and they include one called Fat Bastard, a totally repulsive and
awful character played by Myers and an ingenious and totally whacked out and
hilarious creation Dr. Evil calls Mini-me, a clone 1/8 the size of himself
(Verne Troyer).  One of Dr. Evil's right hand men, Number 2 (Robert Wagner)
is portrayed in 1967 by Rob Lowe as a younger version of that character and
it took me a while to figure out if it was Rob Lowe speaking with Robert
Wagner's voice over dubbed or Lowe doing his own impression.  It sounded
like the latter which was mildly amusing.  Seth Green is back as Dr. Evil's
son Scott as is Mindy Sterling returns as the Nazi-ish Frau Farbissina.
On Austin's side of the playing field, there is the return of Basil
Exposition (Michael York), Austin's boss and a somewhat cardboard character
and this time, filling in for Vanessa Kensington is Felicity Shagwell
(Heather Graham) who looks great but is an extremely bland leading lady with
little life or zest for her role.
The only parts of this installment in the Austin Powers series I enjoyed
were the ones where Dr. Evil is on screen.  Austin Powers is only average in
this one and the fat Bastard character is repulsive, unfunny and disgusting
and may actually and literally make you sick.  Mini-me is a charmer and the
rest of the film's new characters are only average.  'Austin Powers: The Spy
Who Shagged Me' tries to copy 1998's 'There's Something About Mary' with
some gross-out gags that are unnecessary, jaw-dropping and unbelievably
repellent.  Perhaps they figured with such a different look, many wouldn't
notice but those who enjoy film viewing as a hobby can't help but notice.
The film intentionally leaves the door open for a third film and perhaps a
third film would do better if it relied on creating some original humour
rather than lampooning films like the 007 series, 'Star Wars', 'Apollo 13',
the Matt Helm series and others as well.  With all of its campy and silly
infrastructure, perhaps it might be better to get a new director as well.
The director of the two Austin Powers movies, Jay Roach, looks like he'd be
better at directing mindless and insulting television commercials.  How
about getting David or Jerry Zucker ('Airplane!', 'The Naked Gun') or even
John Landis who is great at irreverent comedy.  At least there would be
something to actually laugh at if these guys were at the controls.

The Happy Bastard's Quick Movie Review
"I'm dead sexy!" yells an enormously large Scottish man, hellbent on
catching Dr. Evil's notoriously evil (and midget-like) twin Mini-Me for
a quick snack.  "Get in my belly!!" he bellows, and Mini-Me quickly
scampers back to Dr. Evil, who's hesitant on letting the guy (Fat
Bastard is his name) use his crapper.
It's moments like this absolutely ridiculous one that make Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me just as much a fun romp as the original.
Mike Myers shows he hasn't lost any creativity, and, through lots of
comic timing, comes up a winner with a hilarious, if slightly
overwrought, sequel.
Basically, the story begins roughly where the first one left off.  The
honeymoon ends quickly for Austin and his new bride Vanessa (Elizabeth
Hurley in a funny cameo), and soon Austin is thwarted by the efforts of
his nemesis Dr. Evil, who's making it personal- this time, he's after
Austin's "life force", his mojo.
That leads Austin to travel back to 1969 to try and retrieve his mojo,
before Dr. Evil gets any bright ideas and uses it himself.  (Of course,
a scene where he gets a taste of the mojo is funny as hell.)  There,
Austin teams up with Felicity Shagwell (a very sexy Heather Graham),
who's just as horny as he is...er, was.  Along the way, we're introduced
to many characters, including the aforementioned Fat Bastard and
Mini-Me, as well as a younger Number Two (Rob Lowe), the ill-fated
Mustafa (Will Ferrell), and Dr. Evil's sarcastic son Scott (Seth Green).
Sure, the movie has some slight dull spots, and I think the gags
involving product placement were a slight bit overrun (Fat Bastard's
take on the Chili's song was pretty funny, though), but a lot of the
movie has inspiration, something a sequel usually lacks.  There's some
great new gags here, a gaggle of cool cameos (from Tim Robbins to Woody
Harrelson to...you guessed it...Jerry Springer), and, of course, more
"evil" than you can shake a stick at.  It's all in fun, and the overall
product is very shagadelic.

Rated PG-13 (for scatalogical, gross-out humor, profanity, and sexual 
situations).
Reviewed June 12, 1999.
When the original "Austin Powers" was released in 1997, it didn't make that 
great deal of an impression and was never really expected to, but it garnered 
many positive reviews, had low drop-off box-office rates each week, and 
became a pop-culture phenomenon once it hit video stores. Now we have "Austin 
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me," which will be sure to go down as one of the 
few sequels to do better financially than its predecessor (if the sold-out 
crowd I saw it with is any indication). The terms, "Yeah, baby, yeah!" and 
"let's shag, baby," have been ingrained in most moviegoers' minds due to the 
original, and when was the last time a movie created its own vernacular, and 
audiences followed?
Getting off to a brisk, but disappointing start, this film continues where 
the first left off, with Austin Powers (Mike Myers) and Vanessa Kensington 
(Elizabeth Hurley) on their romantic honeymoon. Within five minutes time, it 
is discovered that Vanessa was a dreaded fembot all along, a henchman of Dr 
Evil's (Myers). Realizing he's a single man again, Austin doesn't take too 
much time grieving before he learns that Dr. Evil has created a time machine, 
gone back to 1969 when Austin was cryogenically frozen, and stolen his 
"mojo." In hot pursuit, Austin time travels back to the swingin' '60s 
himself, meets up with beautiful and "randy" CIA agent Felicity Shagwell 
(Heather Graham), and together they set out to get his "mojo" back. But 
that's not all, as Dr. Evil also is plotting to destroy Washington, D.C. if 
his demands (several billion dollars) aren't met.
"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" has, thankfully, created the same 
atmosphere that the mildly successful first one set up. From the first frame 
to the last, it is apparent that we've stepped back into the world of Austin 
Powers, but that doesn't mean that the new movie is as good, and it isn't. 
For one thing, the whole prologue is a gigantic betrayal of both Austin 
Powers fans and Elizabeth Hurley. Making her turn out to be a fembot will, 
from now on, seriously put a damper on the way people watch the original, 
because now we know that she didn't even actually care about him at all, but 
was on the "evil side." It also creates a noticably large plot hole: If 
Vanessa Kensington was a fembot, then her mother, Mrs. Kensington (played by 
Mimi Rogers in the original), also had to have been, and this little fact is 
not dealt with at all in the uneven screenplay, by Mike Myers and Michael 
McCullers. If Hurley didn't want to appear for more than a brief cameo, the 
filmmakers surely could have thought of a stronger way for her to go out.
Just watching "Austin Powers" right before I saw its sequel, I noticed 
another downfall. While the first one was not hilarious, it was light, 
charming, and occasionally funny. In "The Spy Who Shagged Me," there might be 
some bigger laughs (the sure-to-be-classic "tent scene" comes to mind), but 
there are also just as many jokes that fall astoundingly flat, and others 
that are merely recycled. The film has opted for the 
"everything-but-the-kitchen-sink" approach, and in doing so, has forgotten 
about all of the returning characters who, in essence, are nothing more than 
extended cameos. Seth Green, as Dr. Evil's misunderstood son, Scott, comes 
close to breaking out into his own person (especially when he appears on a 
Jerry Springer episode, entitled "My Father is Evil and Wants to Take Over 
the World"), but there is no payoff. Robert Wagner, as another of Dr. Evil's 
henchmen, Number 2, has all of one scene, until Dr. Evil goes back in time 
and the role is taken over by the younger Rob Lowe (who does a killer 
impression of Wagner). Mindy Sterling has a few nice moments as assistant 
Frau Farbissina who, midway through, has a steamy affair with Dr. Evil, and 
later shares an uncomfortable moment with him by the coffee machine. 
The new characters are a memorable, if underused, bunch. Taking over the 
romantic interest role from Hurley, Heather Graham is energetic and has 
proven to be a fine actress (see 1997's "Boogie Nights" or 1989's "Drugstore 
Cowboy" for proof), but here doesn't get to stretch her acting muscles, and 
her relationship with Austin feels a little more forced than that of Vanessa 
and he. The bright spot in the film is Mini Me (Verne J. Troyer), a clone of 
Dr. Evil, only 1/8 his size. Troyer is often hysterical and even cute, and 
his relationship with Dr. Evil is actually a sweet one. Going for a "Nutty 
Professor"/Eddie Murphy type of deal, Myers has given himself a third role, 
as Fat Bastard, a repugnant Scot who weighs a "metric ton" and, at one point, 
has a disgusting roll in the hay with one of the female characters. In the 
wasted department are the two femme fatales, Ivana Humpalot (Kristen 
Johnston) and Robin "maiden-name's-Spits" Swallows (Gia Carides), who show 
up, do their thang, and quickly disappear.
Of course, in the forefront of the whole operation is Mike Myers, who is 
comic dynamite and doesn't disappoint. Much of the joy that comes from 
watching Myers (whether it be as Austin or Wayne) is actually watching him. 
He clearly has a great love for performing, and especially for his Powers 
character, and his talent only shines through more when considering all of 
the different roles he plays here. You know going in that Dr. Evil is also 
played by Myers, but while watching him, it's easy to forget such a thing 
because of how utterly convincing he is.
With "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me," what you see is what you get. 
There is certainly no deep meanings behind anything that occurs within the 
95-minute running time, and it has a fast pace so your mind won't wander too 
much. The fact that a third "Austin Powers" movie will probably be coming out 
at this time in 2001 is a given, but after seeing his second adventure, you 
have to wonder how many times the same jokes can be played out before they 
start to overstay their welcome. Having Austin say "yeah, baby, yeah!" was 
amusing the first time around, but it isn't here. And judging from this 
not-bad, but lackluster first sequel, Myers should start brainstorming his 
ideas now for the next installment. A little bit of variety and originality 
may very well come in handy in the future.

Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace Soundtrack: (4 out of 4)
John Williams is still an absolute genius. Despite Episode 1 falling short of
the original trilogy, John Williams does not fail with his soundtrack. It is
yet another masterpiece to add to his collection and is a must have for any fan
of Williams, Star Wars or just a fan of good music.
Just to clarify: I am not a classical music fan. In my opinion Mozart and
Beethoven cannot even hold a candle to Fred Durst and Beck Hansen. However,
John Williams just does something with his music to hook me in. When you listen
to this soundtrack, you bring up the memories of the film and the events that
took place. Unlike other blockbuster films that try to feature top-40 boy bands
with their music, Lucas utilizes Williams' soundtrack as a tool. Williams does
not try to outdo the movie, he just works his music into it. 
What most people do not know is that Williams' soundtrack for the Star Wars
trilogy is continuous. That means that it basically plays throughout the film.
This is a testament to Williams' genius because he is subtle, yet powerful.
Whether it be the heart-pumping thrill of "Duel of the Fates" or the subtle,
soothing sound of "Anakin's Theme," Williams is able to display the right
emotions in his soundtrack. The only gripe I could find with this soundtrack is
that it is re-ordered. It is a continuous soundtrack, but the tracks are all
re-organized. It would have been better if the soundtrack was organized to play
as it had in the movie. But trust me, we'll live.
So in a day and age where movie soundtracks only sell with big headliners, John
Williams comes in and breaks the mold. Not only does he create terrific music,
but he is also able to do it throughout the whole film. In fact, this beautiful
soundtrack can give you a better feeling of the film as a whole. If you get
this soundtrack, see the movie after listening because you will have a greater
appreciation for it.
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me Soundtrack: (2 1/2 Out of 4)
Let's just call this a reversal of the above review. While the soundtrack
outdid the movie in quality for The Phantom Menace, it is just the opposite for
The Spy Who Shagged Me. The movie was great; the soundtrack is only a little
bit above average. 
The soundtrack starts off with a bang with Madonna's "Beautiful Stranger." It's
always a risk to just slap a big name artist on a soundtrack (which I'll get to
later), but Madonna is great in this song and it is a great way to start this
soundtrack. The Who provide "My Generation" and R.E.M. does a good job on their
remake of "Draggin' The Line." However, things go downhill from there.
Lenny Kravitz provides a ho-hum performance on his remake on Guess Who's
"American Woman." Scary Spice is next with "Word Up," which is the worst song
on this soundtrack. These two songs are the epitome of blockbuster soundtracks.
In the film, they do not play either Kravitz or Scary's song. In fact, they
actually play the original Guess Who version instead of Kravitz's! Anyway,
soundtracks are meant to complement the film, not just be thrown in while the
credits are playing.
The rest of the soundtrack goes on in a mild pace. The bright spots? Dr. Evil's
hilarious remake of Will Smith's "Just the Two of Us." Green Day also appears
with an instrumental entitled "Espionage" that was surprisingly good. And Burt
Bacharach and Elvis Costello, who appear in the film to perform, do an
admirable job with "I'll Never Fall In Love Again."
Overall, this is a decent soundtrack. But, it seems they went with big,
blockbuster names and luckily got good performances from them. If you liked the
movie, you'll probably like the soundtrack. If you are a fan of any the artists
(excluding Kravitz and Scary) then you'll also enjoy it. Otherwise, stay away.

If there's one thing I admire about Austin Powers-the man (Mike Myers),
it's that he has a boundless amount of energy and feel-good silliness
that could make the grayest skies turn blue.  He's a manic, I
want-to-fight-evil-and-shag machine that's constantly working in
overdrive.   Austin Powers will always be the man that every girl wants
and the only one who can thwart the mad schemes of power-hungry Dr.
Evil (also played by Mike Myers).  Dr. Evil knows that he can't defeat
Powers because the latter possesses something called mojo', the
essence of what makes a man a man.  Having this enables a person to
have confidence, appeal, and shagability'.   Powers's mojo is
especially strong.  So, he plans to steal it.  He presumes that if
Powers is mojoless, he won't have the self-confidence needed to defeat
him.  But as the story progresses, Powers learns a life-affirming
lesson that mojo' isn't what makes a man.  It's something far greater
than what his playful mind can ever imagine.  And what is it?  I think
that Austin, between shags, is still trying to figure it out.
If you've seen the first `Austin Powers,' then you're already familiar
with the premise of this film.  At its core, it is a parody of every
James Bond flick that has ever been released.  And for the most part,
it'll put a smile on your face.  You have the femme fatales with the
libidinous names such as Robin Swallows and Ivana Humpalott.  Power's
also teams up with a CIA operative (Heather Graham) named Felicity
Shagwell (`Shagwell in name and shag very well in reputation,' she
growls).  There is the standout henchman with an oddball name who
possesses a special evil talent, in this case named Fat Bastard (also
played by Myers).  There are the secret lairs hidden beneath volcanoes
and even a pursuit that takes everyone to the moon where Dr. Evil hopes
to execute his grand plan.
Each of these elements is milked for all its worth and these kinds of
silly exaggerations are something that any James Bond-loving fan can
laugh at.  But there are also the nuggets of comedy that make this more
enjoyable than the standard parody. 
The opening credits features Powers strutting stark naked through a
hotel, but manages to hide his jewels' from the audiences' view by
cleverly standing behind a large banana, a loaf of French bread, a
carefully placed pinwheel, and other assorted, suggestive items. 
Another clever sequence involved a series of scenes featuring people
all unknowingly making references to a man's sexual organ.  This is a
scene that must be watched in order to be appreciated.  I also like his
underappreciated, underloved son (Seth Green).  He and his evil father
go on the Jerry Springer show where his Dad says, `you are the Diet
Coke of evil  just one calorie  not evil enough.'  
What made the first one super-groovy, however, was that Austin and Dr.
Evil were products of the 60s, living in the '90.  They were both
absurdly out of touch with reality, and that was funny.  This obvious
target for laughs is not exploited here, and it instead relies on a
formula of straight parody.  The result sometimes borders on
Saturday-Night-Live-Skit-Mediocrity.  Half-way through the film, laughs
were harder to come by and too much time was devoted to Fat Bastard,
whom I found annoying.  Fortunately, Mike Myers shows commitment to his
character and zest for his antics.  What's not to like?

         "Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery" seemed unlikely
to spawn a franchise when it was originally released two years ago.
Coming out in the weeks between the mega-hyped "The Lost World" and
"Batman and Robin," the Mike Meyers comedy passed through cinemas with
little notice, attracting a small following and amassing a passable box
office take on its way to the Blockbuster shelves.
 With most movies, that would be the end of the story. But in
the months after its video debut, "Austin" became a word-of-mouth
sensation, and people who never even considered seeing the film during
its theatrical run now found themselves looking for opportunities to
drop phrases such as "shagadelic" and "oh, behave" into conversations,
just to show their friends they were intimately familiar with
Austinspeak. While "Lost World" and "Robin" proved to be flashes in the
pan, cheerfully leering secret agent Austin Powers and his fatuous
nemesis Dr. Evil became cult figures.
 "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" is a perfectly disrespectful
follow-up, which brings back all the major players from the original,
adds a few welcome new faces and finds a whole new list of old movies,
TV shows and commercials for Meyers to parody or pay tribute to.
 It takes a bright writer to make something that's
simultaneously this idiotic and this consistently funny, and, as Meyers
has shown time and again, he's a pretty smart cookie, as well as a
walking pop culture catalogue. "The Thomas Crown Affair," "You Only Live
Twice," "Time Tunnel," "Jerry Maguire" and, unsurprisingly, "Star Wars"
all get skewered this time around. There's also a hilarious, devestating
mockery of Will Smith's rip-off rap hits that ought to make the one-time
Fresh Prince feel like he's reached his expiration date.
 The usual rule in making a sequel is to take what worked the
first time and merely repeat it on a more elaborate scale. But if
anything, "Shagged" seems tighter and more conservative than its
predecessor, perhaps because Meyers has so much he wants to do he
doesn't have footage or money to waste on grandoise jokes. Even the bits
reprised from "Man of Mystery" have been given an extra spin.
 One of the biggest laugh-getters the first time around was how
the filmmakers managed to come up with jaw-droppingly smutty sight gags
and still maintain their PG-13 rating. They haven't lost their knack:
The movie's opening -- an apparent send-up of the famous "Barbarella"
credit sequence which featured Jane Fonda doing an anti-gravity
striptease -- finds Austin cavorting in a hotel stark naked, his nether
regions covered by such items as a banana, a brisket, a pinwheel and a
pair of hams. Another scene involving silhouettes in a tent manages to
go even further.
 The storyline of "Shagged" -- probably an afterthought --
brings Dr. Evil (Meyers again) back from deep space, just in time to
appear on Jerry Springer with his endlessly glum son Scott (Seth Green)
in an episode entitled "My Father is Evil and Wants to Take Over the
World." The dysfunctional Evil clan is still rife with conflict,
primarily because Scott thinks his father is a loser and Dad argues that
the boy is only "quasi-evil, just one calorie, not evil enough." An
outrageous new addition to the family only serves to widen the
generation gap.
 Meanwhile, Austin, single again after his wife Vanessa
(Elizabeth Hurley) was unmasked as one of Dr. Evil's lethal "fembots,"
is swinging through the 1990s ("I put the 'grrr' in 'swinger,' baby," he
boasts), until Evil uses a time machine to fly back to 1969 London and
steal that which is most precious to our hero: his mojo. Soon Austin too
is back on Carnaby Street in its heyday, shopping for groovy new threads
with his hip American partner partner Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham,
who has enough spunk to offset her visible lack of comic timing),
hitting the go-gos, and, in his spare time, looking for a way to keep
Evil from using a laser cannon to blow up Washington, D.C.
 Some have chosen to see Austin as a take-off on James Bond, but
"Shagged" acknowledges his real origin by including a clip from "In Like
Flint," the 1966 James Coburn movie about a spy who spent more time
coming on to the band of power-hungry superwomen trying to take over the
world than he did trying to thwart them. Check out "Flint" or one of
Dean Martin's brazenly sexist Matt Helm epics from the same period and
you'll see Austin and Bond look almost puritanical by comparison. James

In Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, set in the 90s, Austin's
arch-nemesis Dr. Evil is laughably stuck in the 60s, demanding a million
dollars to ransom the world, etc. Now it's the second installment, though,
and, to keep it interesting, Mike Myers has turned it all around: back in
his own time--the 60s--Dr. Evil is now laughably stuck in the 90s. Meaning
he now wants to ransom the world for a billion or so dollars, which is just
as preposterous as his 90s ransom demand. Which is precisely what Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is all about: temporal dislocation. It's why
we love (or hate) Austin--via some fantastic cryogenics, he's managed to
preserve a 60's mindset wholly unsullied by the 70s and 80s. But, to return
to the little binary set that propels both movies (Dr. Evil/Austin Powers),
while this childlike quality is light-hearted and attractive in Austin, in
Dr. Evil it's a character flaw. Granted, a lighthearted, entertaining one,
but still, more or less the reason Austin defeats him in International Man
of Mystery.
The Spy Who Shagged Me isn't quite so balanced. This time the binary set of
Austin/Evil falls apart a bit, with Dr. Evil more or less taking the lead
role, leaving Austin and Agent Shagwell (Heather Graham) to their series of
hijinks etc. Perhaps this is a result of the introduction of Fat Bastard
(Mike Myers again), Dr. Evil's lackey, or perhaps Evil's Mini-Me skewed
everything somehow. Whatever the case, with Austin and Evil no longer
counterbalancing each other narratively, the mojo that propelled us through
the first installment is somewhat diluted, and all we have to pull us
through then is the slapstick, the self-conscious intertextuality, the
in-jokes.
But there is plenty of all three.
Maybe even too much. Granted, Dr. Evils' Puff-Daddy intermezzo is one of the
highlights of the movie, something we can cue into, and there's Austin
mistaking a stool-sample for coffee, even Agent Shagwell pulling an Austin
from International Man of Mystery (sleeping with the enemy), but it doesn't
all cohere. Instead of going constantly forward as a 'fantastic' comedy
absolutely needs to, The Spy Who Shagged Me sidesteps again and again into
un-plot-related SNL-ish sketches. Dr. Evil's Puff-Daddy intermezzo is a case
in point. But , again, these sketches are entertaining (especially Will
Ferrel's Monty Python take-off), they just make The Spy Who Shagged Me a
fundamentally different type of movie than International Man of Mystery,
which used the sketches as plot devices.
In spite of these narrative difficulties, however, The Spy Who Shagged Me
does redeem itself, both with the frame it sets itself in (Jerry Springer
episodes) and with a wonderful little device it uses never to say 'penis'
when 'penis' really needs to be said. Just as in the closing scene of
International Man of Mystery the naked Austin and Vanessa Kensington's
(Elizabeth Hurley) R-rated parts are always hidden at the last possible
moment, so in The Spy Who Shagged Me--via wordplay, editing, and cameos
(Woody, Willie, etc)--'penis' is never said in the proper context, though
it's what everyone's talking about. This is Austin Powers, after all, and,
while we may not expect narrative rigor, we can can count on extended
joke-sequences such as these, handled with that signature Mike Myers touch.
