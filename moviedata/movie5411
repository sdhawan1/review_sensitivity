The Warner Bros. logo now comes with the music of Casablanca's "As 
time goes by" aka "you must remember  this..." Wrong tune for Three 
to Tango. a would-be romantic comedy-farce. Time goes by 
interminably. And , later, you couldn't remember this flick if you 
tried.
The story:  Oscar (straight) and Peter (gay) are friends, architects 
and associates. They need badly a contract  with tycoon Charles, for 
a cultural center in Chicago. Most unlikely circumstances -- forced, 
reinforced by competitors, and unfunny-- make Charles believe that 
Oscar and Peter are a gay couple.
Married Charles has a girlfriend (mistress, in older English), glass 
sculptor Amy.who has many males flitting around her. Charles, feeling 
safe with the falsely gay Oscar, directs him to keep an eye on her. 
Desperate for the architectura; contract, Oscar plays along and 
accepts the task. And with  200 % predictability, Oscar falls for Amy 
while she, in a state of sexual confusion, falls for him. The rest is 
not, but should have been, silence.
The title Three to Tango is a dumb, irrelevant variant of  the 
expression "it takes two to tango." The  opening credits are an 
irrelevant  montage of jazz music (not even tango!) and boogie-woogie 
dances. The closing credits of sung jazz are irrelevant.
TTT is one big humus pile of irrelevancies. Its plot tries, feebly, 
to work in tolerance of gays;  it succeeds, stongly, in making them 
somewhat caricatural or indifferent at best. The overall ambiance has 
something vinegary about it.
Today's "celebrity" cult has reached the stupidest levels, as the 
public gorges itself with anyone who's appeared on a screen, or had 
his name in the media, her face photographed, their private lives 
mentioned in print, on the air, on voice-mail or bathroom graffiti. 
It is this public that the movie is targeting, with actors from TV.
One of the many weaknesses of this is that people who are not glued 
to television can hardly differentiate among the thesps. It's another 
world from that of Bogie, Errol Flynn, Wayne, Tracy, of Irene Dunne, 
Bette Davis, Kate Hepburn, or later McQueen, Hoffman, Newman, Peck 
and such. Or even from that of the many familiar faces of character 
actors in the studios' stables. There are still stars and sub-stars 
that get immediate recognition, but these are fewer and fewer as the 
performers more and more look alike, unmemorable, un-striking and 
interchangeably generic. Such is the case of the cast in TTT, with 
only Oliver Platt standing out -- and this because of a hideous beard.
The film advances in lead-footed steps. It is like one of those of 
those old diving suits with heavy boots that were shown in movies in 
the days before the snorkels of Captain Cousteau. The actors are 
unattractive --and so are their roles. Not one performer is above 
dumbness level, or interesting  as playerr or as character. I know 
that some people think that Neve Campbell is super-cute on TV. Could 
be, but in this film I find her and her nasal voice, unexciting.
The dialogue is undernourished. The attempts at humor are cheap, as 
typified by a spectacle of twin vomiting, by scenes of irrelevant, 
vague "comparses" such as Oscar's and Peter's pals who are no more 
than wooden furniture sitting on furniture. Or by a tacky metaphor of 
Oscar in Amy's workshop, blowing glass which she tries to shape.
Logic is one-dimensional. Why Amy finds herself falling for Oscar 
(gay or not) is a mystery, unless you decide that two such 
nonentities make a good match. Why Amy is (or was) in love with the 
insufferable Charles makes no sense. Why does free-spirit Amy who's 
moved in with Oscar (she owed rent), have to stay in the tub under a 
blanket of soap-bubbles; why she asks visiting Oscar to turn around 
when she emerges from the water; why this modesty of the bygone Code 
days; why is she incalculably less sexy than Claudette Colbert as the 
latter bathed in asses' milk in  C.B. De Mille's 1934 Cleopatra 
--these are among the many unanswerable questions.
I did not laugh once. Some audience members did so a number of times. 
My curiosity made me search the Internet for viewers' reactions. 
Several were enthusiastic, albeit ungrammatical -- as is Platt's "for 
Oscar and I" -- mostly because Campbell and Perry "were so hot." 
Well, I'm sure that Eskimos think it is hot when the temperature 
stands at 20 degrees F.
Any good spots? Perhaps, if you have a magnifying glass. No, make 
this the Mount Palomar telescope.

   "Three to Tango" is a romantic comedy that wants to shock
the audience into laughing by presenting some cutesy takes
on the gay culture.  The only difficulty with this theme is that
what would be startling in the 1950's is thoroughly passe by
now.  Since Damon Santostefano, who directed the slight
story, does not have a script that can make much use of the
big screen, "Three to Tango" might fit in just fine as a TV
sitcom, preferably about 7 o'clock on a slow Monday evening.
The story is perfectly suited to the talent of its TV-based star,
Matthew Perry ("Friends").  Even its motif is strained and
implausible: a multimillionaire tycoon, Charles Newman
(Dylan McDermott), hires an architect, Oscar Novak (Matthew
Perry), to spy on his mistress, Amy (Neve Campbell).  Oscar
and his partner Peter Steinberg (Oliver Platt) are fighting to
win a 90 million dollar contract to construct a cultural center
in Chicago.  By catering to the honcho's undignified whim,
Oscar believes he can beat the larger, slicker firm of Decker
(John C. McGinley) and Strauss (Bob Balaban).
   Any moderately intelligent fourteen-year-old will be way
ahead of the thoroughly predictable plot, whose loose ends
are tied up tightly, with justice perfectly meted out to each
principal.  "Three to Tango" is a one-joke comedy based on a
gimmick so slim that Santostefano can barely sustain the
romantic tension for half of its mercifully brief length.  The
gimmick is that Oscar, who has agreed to keep tabs daily on
Amy, is erroneously thought by Oscar's boss Charles to be
gay.  When Amy, an artist who holds frequent exhibitions of
her work, meets Oscar for the first time, it's love at first sight
for both, but given that Amy believes Oscar to be gay and
that Oscar must continue to play the game if he is to win the
contract, the two are unable to consummate their relationship. 
As with virtually all romantic comedies, the two principals
must be kept apart until the very end, a concept easily
fulfilled by this notion.  
   Santostefano, making his major motion-picture debut, plays
the sit-com card to the limit, using several themes to milk
what little comedy can be found in the story.  One such strain
allows Amy to be more honest with Oscar than she would be
with a guy whom she believes to be straight.  She allows him
to watch her while taking her bubble bath and makes him the
guest of honor with her circle of girl friends as they exchange
barbs about the clumsy pick-up lines they've encountered
form men.  In a climactic situation, Oscar is chosen as
Professional Gay Man of the Year by one of Chicago's
prominent gay and lesbian organizations and must give a
speech to a large congregation about the joys of coming out
of the closet.  One of the classier jokes sees Oscar and Amy
indulging in a grotesque-looking tuna melt, stepping outside
the diner, and vomiting into the gutter.
   One wonders what scripter Rodney Patrick Vaccaro had in
mind when he believed that the entire population of Chicago
would be abuzz on the morning that one of its leading dailies
headlined the news that Oscar--who with his partner is
expected to build the culture center--is a gay man.  
   The one redeeming feature of this unimaginatively
photographed movie is the attractiveness of the three actors,
though Dylan McDermott does appear too old for Neve
Campbell whose perpetual smiles are a mite too broad to
believe.  If Matthew Perry has any depth beyond what he has
shown in "Friends," none of it appears here.  You've seen it
all many times before with slightly different motifs, and as
they say, "Three to Tango" is a crowd.

The genre of romantic comedy often gets critical sneers, not because
it is inherently weak, but rather because it has mass appeal, and thus
films of this type often follow standard formulas in order to appeal
to the largest market possible. It is well understood that the
greatest number of viewers will be pleased by delivering a happy
ending. This film frustratingly follows all the elements of the
formula.
Oscar Novak (Matthew Perry) and his partner Peter Steinberg (Oliver
Platt) are capable who are looking for the big job that will establish
them. They are bidding for a renovation project for tycoon Charles
Newman (Dylan McDermott), but they are competing with a more
established firm. As a result, they feel they must do everything
possible to win the contract. Through a series of misinterpretations,
aided by the pairs' competitors, the gay Peter is presumed to be
straight and the straight Oscar is presumed to be gay.
The possessive Charles wants to find someone to keep tabs on his
artist mistress Amy Post (Neve Campbell), and Oscar appears to be just
the man for the job. Charles see no threat in having a gay man
associate with his mistress, and Oscar is willing to ascend to Charles
demands because he wants to win the contract. Oscar falls for Amy, and
she becomes attracted to him also, but Oscar cannot reveal his true
feeling without jeopardizing his and Peter's professional future.
The film has one clever dimension, and that is the concept of a
straight man pretending to be gay. In real life, it is the reverse
that usually happens. By allowing viewers to relate to a character who
is forced to pretend to be different from his nature, perhaps some
members of the audience will be more compassionate to the plight of
homosexuals who are forced to masquerade as heterosexuals.
Perry give an entertaining performance. Although most of Oscar's
one-liners are telegraphed, Perry is able to keep the character witty
and likable. Pratt gives an understated performance and thankfully
does not allow his character degenerate into a typically overwrought
stereotypical gay man. The remaining performances were not pleasant to
watch. Charles is not written as anything more than an unlikable
villain, and McDermott does not extend the character beyond that
single dimension. Campbell is particularly ineffective as Amy by
constantly making forced efforts to have the character appear cute and
quirky, and sacrificing any depth of personality.
One disingenuous aspect is the inexplicable relationship between
utterly likable Amy and the irredeemable Charles. Amy explains that it
is difficult for her to meet the right man and establish a
relationship, which is not an uncommon situation for many single
women. Still, it is not understandable how a young, highly attractive,
sociable, and energetic woman would not be able to establish a
relationship with any man in Chicago, except a lout. She does not even
take money or get security from Charles, so the only thing she appears
to derive from the relationship is companionship, which would not be
hard to find elsewhere.
The most disappointing aspect of the film is the utter lack of
originality in the plot. The narrative was designed to please the
maximum number of viewers. The ludicrous climax has all characters and
subplots merge and resolve themselves to the satisfaction of all
involved, which makes the whole narrative hollow. The film aspires to
no artistic goals, but will possibly appeal to the mass audience, and
there is no reason it will not be successful there.
Marginally recommended. The film achieves what it sets out to do, and
as a result it will likely have some amount of commercial success.
However, it is successful because it sets very low goals. It has one
core idea that is interesting, but that gets buried beneath may layers
of familiarity, predictability, and convenience.

 Three to Tango (1999) 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Matthew Perry, Neve
Campbell, Dylan McDermott and Oliver Platt.
 "Three to Tango" is a comical farce about mistaken identity - sexual
mistaken identity.
 But what the movie, directed by Damon Santostefano, cannot clearly focus
on is its attitude toward gays.
 The premise is straight out of one of those screwball comedies of the
1930s and '40s.
 Oscar Novak (Matthew Perry) and Peter Steinberg (Oliver Platt) are
partners in an architectural firm, bidding on a multimillion-dollar project
by tycoon Charles Newman (Dylan McDermott).
 Through a misunderstanding, Newman is led to believe that Novak and
Steinberg are not only partners in business, but in their private lives.
 Thus, thinking Oscar "safe," the married millionaire asks the young
architect to keep an eye on his mistress, Amy Post (Neve Campbell), an
artist.
 Of course, Oscar and Amy fall in love, and complications and
misunderstandings abound, creating comedic situations.
 What seems a bit unclear in the screenplay by Rodney Vaccaro and Aline
Brosh Viviano, based on a story by Vaccaro, are their feelings toward gays.
 Throughout the film, the script has Oscar constantly denying that he is
homosexual as well as feeling embarrassed and humiliated by the entire
situation.
 In the final reel, Oscar gives one of those heartfelt speeches that is an
affirmation of not judging people by their sexual preference, but looking
at them as individuals and at their accomplishments.
 The scene also features one of the latest - most annoying - clichés to
creep into movies: the single clap. After someone finishes a speech or
accomplishes something special there is dead silence until one person
stands and begins applauding. Then another person joins in and another,
until the entire room or arena or stadium is on its feet.
 Perry is very adept at physical comedy as he takes shots to the head and
groin and gets tackled by a football player who falls for him after his
"coming out."
 Campbell is luscious as the free-spirited artist. She glows on screen.
 McDermott is appropriately sleazy as the two-timing villain of the piece,
while Pratt easily steals the movie as the wise-cracking gay partner, who,
ironically, McDermott's Newman believes is straight.
 "Three to Tango" is a lightweight, enjoyable romp. It's not too deep, nor
is it preachy. It is what it is. Don't expect anything more.

CrankyCriticŽ movie reviews: Three to Tango
Rated [PG-13], minutes
Starring Matthew Perry, Neve Campbell, Dylan McDermott and Oliver Platt
Screenplay by Rodney Vaccaro and Aline Brosh McKenna
Based on a story by Vaccaro
Directed by Damon Santostefano

IN SHORT: Perfectly average one joke pony.
Cranky had such a wretched day today that all I wanted was an average
popcorn lightweight flick to make him giggle and make him forget all the
crap that had rained down on him all day long. Three to Tango looked to
be the film that I hoped for, a teevee type comedy with stars I happen
to like.
Be careful what you wish for 'cuz when you get it, it may prove to be
far from enough. Using innuendo, double entendre and overheard
conversations as a driving force for a story of mistaken sexual identity
may work on paper, but it doesn't come off much better than any smarmy
teevee sitcom on Fox (which isn't responsible for this flick). Mix
briskly with as much below the belt humor as you can dream up and it
lays out like this:
Oscar Novak (Matthew Perry) and Peter Steinberg (Oliver Platt) are up
and coming architects (as in please give me this job 'cuz we don't want
to be designing toilets) in the Windy City. They are in fierce
competition with another firm for a $90 million dollar contract to build
a cultural center. The man in charge, zillionaire Charles Newman (Dylan
McDermott) keeps a hot piece on the side, professional glassblower Amy
Post (Neve Campbell). Believing Oscar to be gay, Charles enlists Oscar's
unwilling aid to keep tabs on his babe who he fears may fall back into
the arms of former beau, and professional football, player Kevin
Cartwright (Cylk Cozart). Why does Charles believe the very straight
Oscar to be swishy? See paragraph above.
Oscar and Amy fall at first sight After a long night's talk, and what
feels like half an hour of pratfalls and slapstick gags, all the lovely
first overtures that befit true love leave the pair apart. After which
lover-boy tells girl-on-the side that potential-new-boyfriend prefers
the Other Side of the Force. From there on in its an escalating
masquerade as word gets out, the newspapers out straight-man and a gay
pride professional organization named him Man of the Year.
Gee, what's Oscar to do? On one hand, a $90 million dollar contract. On
the other, a woman who is untouchable in almost every sense of the word,
but not to his (or her) heart. I wanted a lightweight comedy. I got a
lightweight comedy, with more variations on "is he or isn't he" than I
could ever imagine. But, then again, I thought Double Jeopardy was only
fit for teevee and it's been number one at the box office for a month.
So what the hell do I know?
On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Three to Tango, he would have
paid...
Three to Tango is probably an OK dateflick if there's absolutely nothing
else of interest to you. It's a curl up and rent flick by this boy.

Rated on a 4-star scale
Screening venue: Odeon (Liverpool City Centre)
Released in the UK by Warner Bros. on June 30, 2000; certificate 12; 98 
minutes; country of origin USA; aspect ratio 1.85:1
Directed by Damon Santostefano; produced by Bobby Newmyer, Jeffrey Silver, 
Bettina Sofia Viviano.
Written by Aline Brosh McKenna, Rodney Vaccaro.
Photographed by Walt Lloyd; edited by Stephen Semel.
I've had slightly over a week to consider "Three to Tango", and the 
realisation hits me that it must not be called useless. This is a movie that 
will satisfy the curiosity of anyone wondering what it's like to be stuck in 
the cold next to a drunken alien at a bus stop for an hour and a half, who 
laughs at his own bad jokes despite the fact they don't have logical 
progression or punch lines.
I myself have never fantasised about that particular experience, and 
therefore found the movie an ordeal. The plot has nothing to do with aliens, 
but might as well have done, so strange are the actions of its humans. 
Matthew Perry stars as Oskar Novak, an architect asked by a millionaire 
client (Dylan McDermott) to make sure his mistress (Neve Campbell) doesn't 
get up to any mischief when out of sight. McDermott feels safe in this 
because he thinks that Perry is gay.
What we have here is yet another example of what James Blish called the Idiot 
Plot -- a story that would be over in a second if anybody in it had an 
inkling of brainpower. Dialogue tortuously contrives to avoid stumbling on 
the obvious truth that Perry ain't homosexual. McDermott and Campbell 
inexplicably laugh him off when he tries to clear matters up. And then later 
Perry gives a newspaper interview about the difficulties of being a gay 
professional -- why??
Much of the humour in "Three to Tango" is based around misunderstandings. 
Aside from the central dilemma, there are countless scenes where people 
mistake innocent suggestions for sexual propositions, such as when a 
secretary overhears Perry and his business associate (Oliver Platt) tell each 
other "We're partners, and proud of it!", or Perry when idly asks a guy at a 
party "What are you doing later?" Ho, ho, ho. This sort of thing could have 
been made funny in the 1930s, when there was more of a naivete to cinema, but 
now that trends of filmmaking and acting edge so much closer to realism, 
onscreen stupidity is rarely amusing and often embarrassing.
Nothing in "Three to Tango" makes sense. It's weird. Perry gets home to find 
Platt dancing around his apartment, sniffing his fingers and displaying a 
spiky hairdo. "What are you doing?" Perry asks. Platt's answer: "I was 
bored!"  Previously, we opened on shot of them walking down a street chanting 
animal noises, to psyche themselves up for work. The most inane moment comes 
when Perry runs through town, chickens are thrown at him from offscreen, by 
no one, for no reason. He stops, looks at the camera, and carries on running. 
What was going on in the mind of the director when he ordered those chickens 
thrown? Did he really think it would have us rolling in the ailes?
I will resist making a cheap crack about the main actors being television 
stars, because they've done good work in movies before, and there's just no 
opportunity for them to breathe life into this indefensible material. One 
more oddity to wonder about, though: where does the title come from? There 
are either two or five main characters, depending on how you look at it, but 
not three. I can picture the story conferences, where savvy executives no 
doubt realised that if they were going to greenlight a project in which 
nothing made sense, it couldn't do any more harm to name it after an 
unrelated song.

In the good old days it used to take television stars years to make the
big move to the silver screen, and this film is a prime example of why.
It's one thing to repeat your catch phrase or to raise your eyebrow and
wait for the studio audience's laughter to subside for twenty-three
minutes, but entirely another thing to stretch your already marginal
appeal into a feature-length film.  Ever since Helen Hunt won an Oscar
while still starring in a failing television sitcom, Hollywood has tried
to mine talent from the lesser medium.  This should be seen as a
disturbing trend, since sitcom producers seem to only create shows
around vaguely capable one-trick ponies in a rehash of their stand-up
routines.
In Three to Tango, there are not one, not two, but three leads that
still are on the silver screen's ugly stepchild.  It's a mish-mash of a
30s screwball comedy and a traditional love triangle, with a gay twist
for the 90s.  The story isn't anything new  a wealthy man (Dylan
McDermott) doesn't trust his girlfriend (Neve Campbell) while he isn't
around, finds a non-threatening guy (Matthew Perry) to keep her company,
and is surprised when the two fall in love.
McDermott (The Practice) plays Charles Newman, a married business tycoon
that has been placed in charge of hiring an architecture team to oversee
a prestigious $90 million museum restoration project in downtown
Chicago.  As the film opens we see that there are two design teams vying
for the illustrious undertaking  the upscale firm of Strauss & Decker
(respectively Bob Balaban, Jakob the Liar and John C. McGinley, Office
Space) and the protagonist upstarts Oscar Novak (Perry, Friends) and
Peter Steinberg (Oliver Platt, Lake Placid).  Strauss and Decker bat
first, dazzling Newman with both a big-budget presentation and
accusations that their competitors are homosexuals.  Although their
display isn't quite as mind-blowing, Newman likes Novak and Steinberg
enough to hold a showdown between the two partnerships, with the creator
of the best model declared the winner of the project.
Enter Amy (Campbell, Party of Five), Newman's girlfriend deemed
untrustworthy by him.  Since he thinks Novak is gay, Newman asks him to
look after Amy and to make sure she doesn't become involved with any
other men.  Since his career is in Newman's hands, the nebbish Novak
agrees, despite his obvious attraction to her.  Once he begins to fall
in love with Amy, Novak's alleged alternative lifestyle becomes public
news as he is featured in a newspaper article titled `Proud to be Gay.'
You can figure the rest out on your own  Amy thinks Novak is gay, so
she changes in front of him and tells him all of her secrets and
desires.  They share many close, private moments, like simultaneously
vomiting up bad tuna melts.  But Novak just sits there and looks like a
lizard with a bad haircut.  The film's gay stereotypes are unimaginative
and probably offensive as well, with the audience likely questioning the
sexuality of each character.  Who is?  Who isn't?  Who cares?  Although
the film is advertised with three leads, McDermott's character all but
disappears for a good portion of the film.  And by `good portion,' I
don't mean the good part.  I mean the majority part.
Campbell's performance is almost refreshing, compared to her bland roles
in the Scream trilogy and the moody Julia on P.O.F.  Her squeaky voice
seems about two octaves higher than usual and conjures up memories of
former Fox Wednesday night co-star Jennie Garth as she tries to sound
sexy by making cute little bunny noises.  Perry is basically Chandler on
a really bad hair day and McDermott is practically invisible, leaving me
to wish there was more Oliver Platt in the film.
If you look at the track record of the film's stars, this disappointing
result won't be a surprise.  Perry's two films, Almost Heroes and Fools
Rush In, grossed less than what he makes for one episode of Friends.
McDermott is even worse, and his previous two movies, 'Til There was You
and Destiny Turns on the Radio, performed even more poorly.  On the
other hand, Campbell made more than both combined for figuratively
dining on tuna melt in Wild Things, not to mention starring in the
blockbuster Scream flicks.  But she's hardly box office gold on her own
(read: without either a hot script or a hot lesbian scene).
There is one scene where Amy and Novak discuss the use of the line
`Let's get outta here' in modern cinema, deciding that that could be the
response to just about any line delivered by any actor at any point in
any movie.  I also used this line as a suggestion to everybody sitting
around me after about twenty minutes of Tango.

     If I had to pick a "Friends" cast member to star in a feature film --
not contribute, mind you, but star -- I'd pick Matthew Perry.  That may
seem a fairly faint praise, since -- Courtney Cox's contribution to two
SCREAM ensembles notwithstanding -- the six small screen compadres haven't
exactly burned up the big screen.  Each has his or her appeal, but Perry
is more well-suited to carrying a mainstream comedy.  He's got charm, he's
got comic timing ... he's got most of what you need to give an audience
good-natured entertainment.
     He does not, however, have the right stuff for a variation on
TOOTSIE, especially one as ineffectual as THREE TO TANGO.  That's the
essence of this romantic comedy that casts Perry as Chicago architect
Oscar Novak.  Oscar and his business partner Peter (Oliver Platt) are up
for a huge contract, a cultural center financed by tycoon Charles Newman
(Dylan McDermott).  When Charles asks Oscar to keep tabs on his mistress
Amy (Neve Campbell), Oscar quickly agrees, believing his assistance may
give an edge to his firm.  He doesn't realize until it's too late that
Charles only gave him the assignment because he believes Oscar is
gay.  That complication only gets more complicated when Oscar, obliged to
keep playing the part, starts to fall for Amy, who also believes he's gay.
     THREE TO TANGO is framed, like TOOTSIE, as the story of a man who
learns something about himself by pretending to be something he's
not.  There are the expected farcical elements -- the amused reactions of
those who really know Oscar; the awkward and unwanted attentions of a
would-be suitor; a confusing night in bed with the woman friend --
delivered in a functionally chuckle-inspiring manner.  And maybe THREE TO
TANGO could have had a little spark, if there were actually anything for
Oscar to learn.  At the outset, he's a chronically nervous sweetheart with
relationship hard luck -- effective for creating a sympathetic
protagonist, but useless on a narrative level.  Imagine Oscar as a
womanizing homophobe forced to pose as a gay man, and think of how much
more robust a farce it could have been.
     Of course, such an angle is too potentially alienating for Hollywood,
in addition to being all wrong for Matthew Perry.  Misconceptions about
Chandler's sexual orientation were a running gag on "Friends" for years,
which would make Perry seem perfect for the role.  Indeed, he does a great
frustration take, and his winning smile makes it easy to root for him to
get the girl.  Perry is almost warm and engaging enough to make THREE TO
TANGO watchable through the sheer appeal of his personality, but he's
still entirely wrong for the part.  Actually, he's right for the part as
written, which is pleasant and non-threatening.  It's the part that's
wrong for the movie.  The anger and bitterness of Dustin Hoffman's Michael
Dorsey gave TOOTSIE its trans-gender kick.  Because niceness is always
Oscar's defining quality, THREE TO TANGO never had a chance at being
anything but sporadically nice.
     And it's only sporadically nice, since Perry gets little help from
his castmates.  Platt is quickly becoming cinema's most reliable second
banana, but he doesn't get much to work with.  McDermott plays a
generically icy corporate shark, and he has even less to work with.  Then
there's Neve Campbell, whose appeal frankly baffles me.  As the
free-spirited artist and object of Oscar's affections, she's all affected,
unconvincing effervescence.  There's a superficial topicality to the
film's themes, but it's really the sort of pure froth that lives or dies
on the basis of its romantic pairing.  If you're able to smile along with
Oscar and Amy's sit-complicated courtship, more power to you.  I could
only smile along with Perry, whose self-deprecating nice guy screen
presence deserves a much better vehicle -- preferably one where it makes
sense for the protagonist to be a self-deprecating nice guy.

"Three to Tango" stars Matthew Perry (TV's "Friends"), Neve Campbell (TV's 
"Party of Five"), and Dylan McDermott (TV's "The Practice"). I do not mention 
the fact that they are all currently starring on television series' to demean 
or criticize their acting abilities, but I mention it because their casting 
seems rather appropriate. There's no way "big" movie stars would have agreed 
to make "Three to Tango" because it is inauspiciously written by Rodney 
Vaccaro and Aline Brosh McKenna on a strictly television sitcom level, and 
rarely ever feels like a feature film. 
Tellingly, the movie is stretched so thinly and told in such a 
paint-by-numbers way that there is very little interest that evolves within 
the story, and the only relationship that is able to develop satisfactorily 
is that between Oscar Novack (Matthew Perry), a Chicago architect, and Amy 
Post (Neve Campbell), a prospering artist. They come together and become 
close friends after Oscar, believed to be gay after a misunderstanding 
involving his gay partner, Peter Steinberg (Oliver Platt), is hired by 
multimillionaire business magnate Charles Newman (Dylan McDermott) to keep an 
eye on his beautiful mistress, who happens to be Amy. Hitting it off at one 
of her gallery openings, followed by an adventurous evening in which their 
cab literally blows up and they get sick and throw up from eating tuna melts 
at a low-rent dive, Oscar instantly has fallen in love, and Amy likewise has 
feelings for him. Unfortunately, once the false news spreads around the area 
that Oscar is gay after his picture is plastered on the front page of the 
newspaper, he finds himself having to play up the rumor so he doesn't 
jeopardize his job or Amy's friendship.
Amidst a handful of charming little scenes and an absolutely winning 
performance from Neve Campbell that proves she's more than just a television 
actress, "Three to Tango" is a terminally empty-headed romantic comedy, and 
most of the blame should not be put on the actors (aside from Dylan 
McDermott, who is thoroughly unappealing), but on the dumb screenplay and 
flat direction, by Damon Santostefano (whose only previous film credit is 
1992's "Severed Ties"). Clocking in at just over 90 minutes, the film's 
aspirations are disjointed and very little of the mistaken identity plotline 
is successful. Moreover, its treatment of gays is, at times, surprisingly 
thoughtful, as with the subplot involving Amy's ex-boyfriend (Cylk Cozart) 
who has just recently come out, and other times it is simply offensive. The 
reaction of Oscar's father when he finds out he's "gay" is certainly the 
film's major low point.
Matthew Perry is perfectly fine in his good-guy role as Oscar, but he is 
pretty much playing his character of Chandler on "Friends." However, Neve 
Campbell abandons her sullen, problems-ridden Julia Salinger character from 
"Party of Five," and makes Amy a fun-loving, intelligent gal--the exact type 
you'd like to root for in a film of this genre. Campbell lights up the 
screen, and almost single-handedly steals the picture from everything and 
everyone else involved.
By the time the heartfelt climax and hugely predictable conclusion occur, 
you're left with a malnourished appetite, as you've been 
waiting--praying--for something of note to happen when nothing ever does. 
Oscar, being presented the award as Gay Man of the Year (is there seriously 
such a thing?), "comes out" to everyone, in reverse, letting the guests know 
that he isn't actually gay. Standing up for what he believes in and 
professing his deep love and admiration for Amy, his speech (the type that 
only occur in movies) sends off a warm applause from the audience before him. 
Why is this annoying cliche used in so many films, since it so obviously 
doesn't resemble reality or human nature at all? Accordingly, there are no 
twists, no unforeseen developments, and the ending does not make the most of 
its romantic intentions, even if we like Amy and Oscar, which I did.   
For no known reason, more of the running time is padded out by the opening 
and ending credits, which feature people dancing to swing music. How exactly 
does swing music factor in to anything else in the film, anyway? I'd almost 
bet money that no one involved could give me a plausible answer. When all is 
said and done, "Three to Tango" is like a loaf of stale bread. From afar, it 
may look fresh and mildly engaging, but get closer, and its appeal sours.

     Maybe as another Matthew Perry star vehicle where he doesn't come
off as particularly funny?  Maybe as another Neve Campbell movie where
she sounds whiny and unlikable?  Or perhaps it will be as a borderline
offensive straight-guy-mistaken-as-gay movie, heavy on the cliches and
light on the laughs.
     Of course, THREE TO TANGO is all of these things.  It's one of the
flattest romantic comedies this year, a variation on the mistaken
identity theme that already feels old, despite its watery `fresh twist'
on the love triangle genre.
     The story: McDermott is a billionaire tycoon who's looking to build
a philanthropic museum.  Platt and Perry are a team of architects on the
short list to do the work.  Will they get the job?  Well, McDermott
thinks Perry is gay, so he enlists him to `watch over' his mistress,
Campbell, who is attracting many a wandering eye.  Uh oh!  Perry falls
for Campbell, who also thinks he's gay.  What's a girl to do!?
     Let me stop right there.  Exactly what you think is going to
happen, happens.  There's scarcely a moment of surprise in the entire
picture, with the exception of a few minor characters who provide comic
relief.  Platt, as the genuine homosexual, is also a riot when he's
allowed to stretch, but that's not very often.  Everything else, from
Perry's attempts to tell Mom and Dad he's not really gay, to his Big
Speech in Public where he reveals the truth, is utterly predictable.
And neither romantic nor comedic.  Pass on this one.

When it comes to the cast members of `Friends' making the transition to
film, success is scarcely evident. Perhaps the most profitable move to
cinema was made by Courteney Cox (now Courteney Cox Arquette), who
experienced enormous prosperity with the renowned slasher films `Scream'
and `Scream 2'. Matthew Perry, although appealing and undeniably
charming, has received the short end of the stick in his ventures to the
big screen.
I enjoyed Perry's `Fools Rush In', but the film was generally savaged by
critics, leaving it in tattered box office ruins. And in the forgotten
comedy `Almost Heroes', the actor looked suitably embarrassed as he
played second fiddle to the late Chris Farley. The right vehicle was
waiting for Matthew Perry, but until he could work up the courage to
track it down, the comfy confines of `Friends' would have to suffice. Is
`Three to Tango' the crown jewel in Perry's bag of tarnished rocks?
Certainly not. But, with it's beguiling charm and infectious appeal,
this light romantic comedy is indeed a tasty entree.
Oscar Novak (Perry) and Peter Steinberg (Oliver Platt) are members of a
design team hoping to revitalize an aging city landmark with a new,
attractive layout. The project financier is a greedy millionaire named
Charles Newman (Dylan McDermott), who must choose between Novak and
Steinberg and an opposing design duo (played by John C. McGinley and Bob
Balaban). But first.... Charles' secretary overhears a conversation
between Oscar and Peter, and makes the inaccurate assumption that they
are gay partners. Charles gets immediate wind of this news, and, worried
about male competition, he hires Oscar to spy on his beautiful mistress
(Neve Campbell) at an art show.
As with most romantic comedies, the primary weakness in `Three to Tango'
is in it's setup. The characters are introduced in such a frenzied rush
that they come across devoid of depth and discernible feeling. The
situations are not particularly funny or interesting. But the mistaken
identity premise at the film's core provides more cheerful fun than one
would rightfully anticipate. There's nothing you won't be able to
predict, but director Damon Santestefano's approach is an inviting one,
and the continuous appeal of the actors generates enough fuzzy charm to
fill three movies of a similar genre.
Although the issues are interesting, the experience of `Three to Tango'
is not going to linger in your mind. It's pleasant, but instantly
forgettable. Oscar initially goes along with the false humor of his
homosexuality, in fear of letting the definitive moment of his career
slip carelessly through his fingers. But, when the news gets out in the
open, he is helpless to defend his strictly heterosexual intentions.
Borrowing tidbits from the amusing comedy `In and Out', in which Kevin
Kline was mistakenly `outed' at the Academy Awards, Oscar's friends and
family are left bewildered with the arrival of the shocking news. Amy,
Charles, onlookers on a city bus - everyone believes Oscar is gay. As
Platt puts it: `You've made a big gay bed, and now you must slumber
gayly in it.'
It's nice to see Neve Campbell free herself from the bloody (`Scream')
and the dirty (`Wild Things'), and attempt to portray nothing other than
good old-fashioned cute. Whenever Campbell lends her bright, attractive
charisma to a scene, `Three to Tango' sparkles with genuine appeal. The
relationship between Oscar and Amy is convincing, mainly because both
leads are charming and have the ability to balance the weight of the
relationship with precise believability. The sparks generated in their
unlikely romance are extremely hard to resist. And, in wonderful spirit,
Oliver Platt once again registers as a quirky supporting player. My
question is: when will his assembly line of quirky supporting characters
ever stop? There was `The Three Musketeers', `Lake Placid', and now this
primary example. One thing is for certain: Platt is good at what he
does.
`Three to Tango' is refreshingly full of honest, well-executed humor
that will strike a chord with most audience members. What's lacking is
the presence of a decent script that doesn't rely heavily on predictable
plot devices and underdeveloped characters. However, those characters
are played by actors with enormous charm - enough charm to guide this
light, enjoyable romantic comedy to moderate success.

Susan Granger's review of "THREE TO TANGO" (Warner Bros.)
 The producers of this mildly amusing, off-beat romantic
comedy obviously thought that if they paired popular Matthew Perry
from TV's "Friends" with Neve Campbell from TV's "Party of Five" and
"Scream," adding Dylan McDermott and Oliver Platt for substance,
they'd have a hit - wrong!  Matthew Perry plays an ambitious,
idealistic, if clumsy young architect who has just been chosen by
businessman Dylan McDermott to compete for the design of a
multi-million dollar Chicago cultural center. The slimy tycoon also
tells Perry he'll get preferential consideration if he'll spy on his
mistress, Neve Campbell, assuming that Perry is a homosexual, like his
openly gay partner, played by Oliver Platt. Predictably, Perry falls
for Campbell, who also thinks he's gay, particularly when he's honored
as Gay Professional of the Year. What will he do? Will he continue to
lie to hold on to the job opportunity of a lifetime and a warm but
frustrating friendship with the girl he loves or come out of the
closet and admit he's secretly straight? You guess. I'll give you a
hint, though. Screenwriter Rodney Vaccaro's own bizarre experience
inspired the story. While he was working as creative director of a
large advertising agency, he fell in love with his boss's mistress. A
series of what he describes as "sexual errors" led to Vaccaro
eventually marrying her and co-writing this script with Aline Brosh
McKenna. But, despite superficial similarities, this is no "The
Apartment" or even "In and Out," perhaps because of Damon
Santostefano's light-hearted direction which makes it feel like a TV
sit-com. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Three to Tango" is a
frenetic, formulaic, flimsy 4, satirizing sexual stereotypes with the
catchline: " You've made a big gay bed, and now you must slumber gayly
in it!"

Starring Matthew Perry, Neve Campbell, Dylan McDermott, Oliver Platt.
Rated PG-13.
The cast of the ultra-popular tv show Friends have had a curse placed
on them: it seems that none of them can star in a good movie. Picture
Perfect anyone? Ed? Kissing a Fool? Their success rate on the silver
screen has been abominable. But now, with Matthew Perry's Three to
Tango, if the Friends curse isn't broken, it's starting to tear at the
seams. This latest attempt is an entertaining, inoffensive, highly
likeable (though derivative) production, with all the makings of a box-
office and critical success.
After an entertaining titles sequence, we are introduced to Oscar Novak
(Perry) and Peter Steinberg (Oliver Platt), two architects who have
come to the office of Charles Newman, a rich tycoon who is building a
cultural center named after himself. The team of Oscar and Peter seems
homely in comparison to the competition: two limitlessly wealthy suits
who are willing to go to any lengths, monetary and otherwise, to get
this project. After they are told that they have to build a model of
their proposal, which would cost at least 150 thousand dollars, Oscar
and Peter doubt their chances against the moneybags they are pitted
against until a series of unexpected developments changes the rules
entirely.
Through a series of misunderstandings, Newman comes to believe that
Oscar is gay, when in reality it is Peter who "bats for the other
team". Newman is currently cheating on his wife with Amy, a beautiful,
oddly Seinfeld-ish New Yorker (Neve Campbell) and is afraid that a
hunky football player might try to make a pass at his mistress. Because
he thinks Oscar is gay, he orders him to keep tabs on Amy and report
back to him with information on whom she mingles with and how she
mingles with them.
Oscar, of course, is not gay and he starts to like Amy, who really does
seem like a fine gal, unlike many bitchy female figures in these kinds
of movies. She continues to think that he is gay and is kept in the
dark about his romantic affection for her. Of course, Oscar has to keep
pretending he is gay and not show his crush on Amy for fear of losing
the project for himself and his partner in the unfortunate circumstance
that Newman finds out that the man who he sent to spy on his girlfriend
is courting her.
The situation is complicated further when the newspapers decide to do a
story on him, profiling him as a prosperous gay businessman. Now
everyone in the world thinks he is gay, leading to indecent proposals
from strangers of the incorrent gender. The story also lessens his
chances of confessing his love for Amy without publically pronouncing
that he is not gay and risk losing his architectural gig.
Three to Tango elicits memories of a similarly delightful comedy, In
and Out with Kevin Kline. That film had the same basic premise but was
more gay-friendly and was not a romance. Comparisons to In and Out are
inevitable, but in fact, they are two completely different films. Which
is superior is hard to say, but this one is definitely a match for the
1997 critical darling. It's a light-hearted, funny movie that, if
nothing else, produces consistent chuckles and a few laugh-out-loud
moments. Though Three to Tango ultimately fails to emotionally involve
us with its characters, it is fast paced and never tedious; making up
for thematic inadequacies with sharp wit.
Neve Campbell's performance is rather generic, though her character is
a likeable one; fortunately, Perry and Platt more than make up for her
undistinctiveness. Perry still seems to be playing his Chandler
character from Friends, but since I happen to love Chandler, I was glad
to say hi to the old friend on the big screen. Oscar is a tad less
cynical and sarcastic than his veritable counterpart, but for some
reason I still thought "Chandler". That certainly doesn't mean that
Perry isn't funny in the role; quite the contrary, he is a hoot. Platt
fares even better. He's a naturally funny actor, with an uncanny flair
for delivering one-liners, and his talents make Three to Tango even
more enjoyable. His character doesn't go very far, but he sure is a
good source of guffaw-worthy lines like the one above.
The ending of the film is ordinary and unsatisfying, resorting to
painfully obvious cliches in order to squeeze out as happy a conclusion
as humanely possible (it's ironic, too, that the characters actually
make fun of movie cliches while conforming to them). It likewise didn't
hurt the movie a great deal because I was never induced to make a great
personal investment in the characters and thus wasn't too disappointed
when their story wrapped-up in a traditional romantic comedy fashion.
It didn't take away from the fact that the film was zingy and
entertaining; a feather-light delight.

Assume nothing.  The phrase is perhaps one of the most used of the 1990's, as
first impressions and rumors are hardly ever what they seem to be.  The phrase
especially goes for Oscar Novak, an architect who is the main focus of Three To
Tango, a delightful, funny romantic comedy about assumptions and being
yourself.  Novak (Matthew Perry), a shy, clumsy, Chicago based architect, along
with openly gay partner, Peter Steinberg (Oliver Platt), fights for projects
day in and day out.  One of these is the job of restoring a popular building
for Charles Newman (Dylan McDermott), a rich, well-known businessman.  Charles
immediately takes a liking to Oscar, as he enjoys his personality and sense of
humor.  Seeing Oscar as someone he could trust, Charles asks him to watch his
girlfriend, an unpredictable, adventurous girl named Amy Post (Neve Campbell),
who makes a living by blowing glass.  Charles wants to know who she talks to,
what she does, and where she goes.  The point?  To make sure she's not seeing
someone else, of course.  Oscar gladly takes the job, and meets Amy at an art
show of hers, and sparks fly between the two from the get go.  Oscar feels he
has found the one meant for him, and he is content with the idea of being with
Amy.  Well, another popular phrase of the 90's is "All good things must come to
an end," and this stays true for Oscar as well.
Charles walks in on Amy and Oscar having a drink one night, as Oscar and Amy
have become great friends, but he doesn't seem to mind.  Why is this?  He
thinks Oscar is gay.  He's not afraid to share this with him either.  Oscar
stands in shock after the words, "I swear if you weren't gay Oscar, I'd have to
kill you," are muttered flamboyantly from Charles' mouth.  The word spreads
instantly through town.  Will Oscar "come out" of his supposed gayness, or will
he tell everyone that he isn't?  One would immediately think he would deny the
fact, but numerous occurrences come to Oscar, which result in the fact that if
he denies the fact, he could lose his job with Charles.
Matthew Perry doesn't escape his character as Chandler on the already classic
T.V. comedy "Friends," as both Oscar Novak and Chandler are clueless, shy, and
sensitive.  Nonetheless, Perry is hilarious here, and shows that he can handle
drama, as obviously, his character suffers quite a bit here.
It's wonderful to see Neve Campbell outside of a horror movie, (She was the
star of Scream 1 and 2, and the upcoming Scream 3) as she handles comedy
superbly here.  Her voice, smile, and personality are more than perfect for
romantic comedies- Stay with this genre, Neve.  Neve is delightful as her
conflicted character, who feels love for Oscar, but knows, based on rumors,
that he is gay.  As usual, Campbell is likable as her likable character.
Unlike the other two leads here, Dylan McDermott is flat in his dialogue, and
is never convincing.  When his character his present, McDermott sets a dull
tone to the scene with his horrible acting.  Stick to the T.V. Drama, The
Practice, Dylan.
The major weak spot in Three To Tango is the direction of Damon Santostefano. 
No originality or technique is used whatsoever.  Three To Tango is lucky that
the script is so edgy and that Perry and Campbell are wonderful in comedy, or
else the film would have been a disaster, as it is just plain boring to look
at.    
Three To Tango is a film done many times before, as the plot is suspiciously
close to 1998's The Object of My Affection, but the plot has never been
completed so well.  Three To Tango's script, written by Rodney Patrick Vaccaro
and Aline Brosh McKenna is fun, fast, and funny, delivering not only original,
hilarious gay jokes (not your run of the mill material), but a certain
snappiness in the dialogue between characters that always keeps you smiling.  
Unlike last summer's South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut and 1997's In & Out,
Three To Tango is a comedy in which the gay element is not crude or vulgar. 
The script is wise to take this route, as gays can't (I don't think so, anyway)
be offended by this light, playful comedy.  (To prove this, a gay couple was in
the audience who were laughing constantly.)  Three To Tango's climax is a
hilarious, clever scene that is pure irony based on the outcome of most
romantic-mistaken identity comedies.  Three To Tango is a gem.  
The Bottom Line: Three To Tango is a light, sharp, snappy romantic comedy with
a superb ending, and great stars.  One of the better romantic comedies of 1999.

Over the years I've gotten numerous letters from people infuriated at me
for not liking one of their favorite films. One of the frequent
complaints is that it is clear to them that I would never like the film
in the first place, so why did I bother to go?
Damon Santostefano's THREE TO TANGO, starring Matthew Perry, Neve
Campbell and Dylan McDermott, provides one answer to those questions.
(The other answer is that I review everything for my readers.) Going
into this movie, I had extremely low expectations. The last time I saw
the two male leads, FOOLS RUSH IN (Perry) and 'TIL THERE WAS YOU
(McDermott), I hated the pictures in general and their performances in
particular. Moreover, THREE TO TANGO's theme of a gay guy who really
isn't was not something that sounded at all promising.
What a pleasant surprise it turned out to be. A sweet little mistaken
identity story in a whimsical style reminiscent of Shakespeare's "As You
Like It," THREE TO TANGO doesn't have a pretentious bone in its body.
Its high-spirited swing music matches perfectly the happy tone of the
production. (The show is neatly bracketed with two energetic song and
dance numbers in the opening and closing credits.)  And lensed by Walt
Lloyd with a neon gloss of bright blues and greens, the picture looks
terrific.
As Amy, an upcoming, modern artist, Neve Campbell (WILD THINGS) gives an
adorable, pixyish performance that could charm the paint off the walls.
As superrich cad Charles Newman, Dylan McDermott turns his usually
unlikable demeanor into an attribute. Rodney Patrick Vaccaro's wryly
funny script is tailor-made for Matthew Perry as Oscar Novak, a
struggling architect. Nicely rounding out the cast is Oliver Platt
(BULWORTH), an always-funny actor, as Oscar's partner, Peter Steinberg.
When we meet the architectural firm of Novak and Steinberg, they are
about to make their proposal to Charles Newman for the renovation of The
Telford Building in Chicago. They find that they are hopelessly
outclassed in their presentation by a high-powered rival firm led by two
other architects, played by Bob Balaban and John C. McGinley.
Novak and Steinberg turn out to have one advantage. Oscar is mistakenly
assumed to be gay. (His partner is believed to be straight, when in
reality it's the other way around.)  Oscar, being gay, proves to be just
what Charles wants. Charles asks Oscar to spy on Amy, Charles's
mistress, to make sure she isn't seeing any of her old boyfriends. And
when, later, Amy ends up moving in with Oscar, even better. Life becomes
more and more complicated for Oscar as he falls head over heels in love
with Amy but doesn't dare tell her lest he lose his chance for the big
architectural contract. Amy bonds heavily with Oscar and tells him
things that she would never reveal to a potential boyfriend.
Perry's deadpan humor shines with some of his best lines being
unprintable. One scene that had no business working, but does, concerns
Oscar and Amy's first "date." After they eat rancid tuna-melts, they
both find that vomiting provides not only relief but an icebreaker in
their relationship as well due to their shared hardships. "It doesn't
get much better than this," Oscar says with a smiling sincerity after he
throws up. Done off screen, the regurgitation, my least favorite film
feature, manages to be surprisingly endearing.
As the story unfolds, Oscar and Amy's relationship deepens and is much
more believable than that of Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas in
RANDOM HEARTS. The sexual tension between Oscar and Amy is palpable even
if neither feels able to do anything about it. This tension is
especially in evidence in a funny bubble bath scene. Amy, completely
encased in opaque bubbles, starts telling Oscar about her one, brief
lesbian fling, which happened during college. He listens with wide-open
eyes. "I'm all for homosexuality when it comes to two gorgeous women --
or three," he says breathlessly in a revealing line.
Even when the movie turns slightly serious at the end, frequently the
kiss of death for comedies, the director makes the events credible, even
within the context of the unabashedly silly story. The result is a
romantic comedy with a genuine chemistry between the lovers and plenty
of laughs. A delightful story that manages somehow to be tender, it puts
a magical little spell on its audience.
THREE TO TANGO is rated PG-13 for sex-related situations and language
and would be fine for teenagers.
