     Abel Ferrara is on the record saying that he originally thought
making a vampire movie was "a stupid idea."  Presumably, then, the idea
came from his longtime coconspirator, screenwriter Nicholas St. John.
It's a good decision, because Ferrara is arguably at his best when he's
working within a well-established mythos--taking on the BODY
SNATCHERS in his 1993 remake, for instance, or casting Christopher
Walken in the Al Pacino role, updating and revamping DePalma's SCARFACE
and Coppola's GODFATHER for his own KING OF NEW YORK (1990).
     So with THE ADDICTION, Ferrara sinks his teeth into a moral fable
that equates bloodlust with amorality and postulates that there may,
even now, be salvation for the sinner.  Shadow-slinker Anabella Sciorra
nails star Lili Taylor early on, dragging her into an appropriately
chiaroscuro corner of Greenwich Village and biting her, hard. Taylor,
who plays a philosophy grad student at New York University, acquires
the vampire's thirst for blood and starts stalking the campus, preying
on the victims who are weak enough not to tell her just once, with
feeling:  get away from me.
     The movie progresses more or less as a series of episodes
detailing Taylor's interactions with old friends, professors and other
potential victims, and even other vampires. Before long, she's adopted
the cool black-clad cigs-and-sunglasses attitude of a fashionable
junkie and starts to ruminate weirdly on the Meaning of it All.
     The NYU setting defuses a problem Ferrara movies have been
having with dialogue lately; in this movie, the characters talk like
pretentious philosophy students because that's what they are, and it
makes all the difference when Taylor seduces a sweet young thing at the
movie's midpoint by inviting her upstairs to study Feuerbach. The
movie's wildly literate bent comes to a wacky fruition during a key
scene featuring Walken in a longish cameo.  Discussing the nature of
blood addiction, and giving Taylor metaphysical tips on ways to best
deal with her habit and the attendant immortality, Walken gets animated
and lurches toward her with feeling: "Have you read NAKED LUNCH?"
     Walken's presence is welcome, even though Taylor is quite capable
of handling her part without a helping hand. Ferrara's forte lately has
been coaxing anguished performances from his stars, and the camera here
lingers on Taylor, framing her body dispassionately as it wracks and
convulses, or as she crawls across the floor in the throes of her
addiction. This isn't to say that you should expect a full-frontal
Keitelian assault, but Taylor is excellent, and she provides a
necessary dollop of humanity within Ferrara's big picture.
     Shot entirely in black-and-white, Ferrara's New York is used
here mainly for backdrop and attitude. There's no real sense of
location, but this is the kind of story you'd hardly expect to see
anywhere else. The photography is mostly rich and evocative, but
occasionally heavyhanded.  You wish, for instance, that someone would
reach up and turn on a light during Taylor and Sciorra's first
encounter. It takes a little while for THE ADDICTION to get going, and
the overly mannered dialogue may have your eyelids dropping if you're
up past bedtime.  Fortunately, when the going gets weird, it's weird
enough to make you care where Ferrara and St. John are taking you.
     THE ADDICTION culminates in two major scenes, one of them being
an over-the-top party sequence that recalls the climax of my favorite
Ferrara film, MS. 45. That first scene leads directly into the second,
which is the allegorical climax, complete with a priest and communion
wafers. It'll be no surprise to anyone who's seen BAD LIEUTENANT that
Ferrara is most concerned here with the concepts of sin and redemption,
and while the last moments of THE ADDICTION are a little obscure, he
follows through, perhaps shoring up a new reputation as one of New
York's foremost gloomy optimists.

(1995) NO STARS - C:Lily Taylor, Christopher Walken, Annabella Sciorra,
Paul Calderon.
Abel Ferrera, director of such mediocre films as "Bad Lieutenant" and "Body
Snatchers", and of such awful films as "The Gladiator" and "Dangerous Game",
adds another to his awful list. Basically, "The Addiction" is just another
low budget vampire flick, although the term "vampire" is never used in the
film. It tries to be some sort of psuedo-intellectual metaphor for drug
addiction and even man's evilness upon his fellow man.
Taylor plays a college student who is attacked one night in a dark alley by
vampire Sciorra. Sciorra bites her, and then for the next twenty minutes
Taylor basically just gets sick and throws up blood all the time. Pleasant.
Then Taylor starts to get "hungry" so she goes out into the city to get a
"fix". At first, she apparently can't bring herself to actually bite anyone,
so she brings along hypodermic needles and withdraws blood from homeless
people. She then proceeds home and injects herself with the blood. All of
which we get to watch. Boy o boy, at this point we've got vomit and needles,
my eyes are GLUED to the screen. I wonder what other disgusting and
unpleasant things we'll get to see.
Taylor soon gets the hang of biting people, so thankfully, no more needles.
She meets up with Christopher Walken, who plays a sort of mentor vampire who
has been around much longer than Taylor has. In his brief appearence he
spouts out dialog about literature and about man's inhumanity throughout
history. Then he leaves, and the carnage (and unpleasantness) continues.
The only new thing that "The Addiction" tells us about vampires is that if a
vampire approaches you on the streets, he or she will give you the option of
whether or not you want your life saved. The vampire wants you to tell it to
"go away" with strength and confidence, like you really mean it, instead of
just begging and pleading for your life like a little baby. Yes, that's
right, I kid you not. In conclusion, the whole film is boring and
unpleasant, two things that never add up to a good movie. The film is in
black and white if anyone is interested.

USA. 1994. Director - Abel Ferrara, Screenplay - Nicholas St. John, 
Producers - Denis Hann & Fernando Sulichin, Photography (b&w) - Ken 
Kelsch, Music - Joe Delia, Production Design - Charles Lagola,. 
Production Company - Fast Films.
Lili Taylor (Kathleen Conklin), Edie Falco (Jean), Christopher Walken 
(Pena), Paul Caldaron (Professor), Kathryn Erbe (Anthropology Student), 
Annabella Sciorra (Casanova)
Plot: Philosophy student Kathleen Conklin is bitten by and transformed 
into a vampire. As she succumbs to the vampiric urges she comes to 
understand that the vampire is really a mirror of the cruelty and 
violence that is at the heart of human nature.
The concept of the vampire was inherited into Western popular culture 
via Bram Stoker's `Dracula'. As a result of Stoker's legacy the vampire 
has always been rooted in Christian concepts of good and evil with the 
vampire representing an animal sexuality hidden beneath the decorum of 
mannered society being despatched by confident men who stride a resolute 
line between science and religion. The cinematic vampire was popularized 
by the Bela Lugosi 혩Dracula' in 1931 and the hundreds of vampire films 
that have followed since have almost all fallen into this symbolic 
resonance. But in the 1970s and 80s the vampire film began to abandon 
classical notions of good and evil. Firstly it was the tacit recognition 
of films like 혩Count Yorga, Vampire' (1970), `Dracula A.D. 1972' (1972), 
`Blacula' (1972) and `Love at First Bite' (1979) that the Victorian 
trappings of the vampire film only had limited potential and that the 
vampire in cape and dinner-suit cut a rather absurd, unthreatening 
figure when brought into the present.
In the 1980s and beyond, the vampire film began to implicitly accept the 
death of the traditional reason and religion vs bestial nature dualism. 
But ironically instead of dying out the vampire film began to flourish 
more than ever before. The resulting films could be thrown into three 
rough categories - those which overtly spoofed and parodied the 
traditional vampire (the likes of 혩Dracula: Dead and Loving It', `I 
Bought a Vampire Motorcycle', `Vampire Trailer Park') or conducted 
generic pastiches (ie vampire cop show - tv's `Forever Knight', vampire 
getaway film - `From Dusk Till Dawn', vampire mafia - `Innocent Blood'). 
Or else those films which dragged the vampire into the modern world and 
transformed the character into a kind of badass punk - `The Lost Boys', 
`Near Dark', `Blade'. And thirdly those which inverted the metaphors of 
Bram Stoker about sexual repression to turn vampirism into a kind of 
dark, sensual forbidden romance - the `Graveyard Shift' films, `Bram 
Stoker's Dracula', `To Die For', `The Nosferatu Diaries: Embrace of the 
Vampire'.
The rarest among the new vampire films have been those which have sought 
to reinvent and question the metaphors of vampirism. The first film to 
try this was 혩Incense for the Damned' aka `Bloodsuckers' (1969) which 
ambitiously tried to develop vampirism as a metaphor for sexual 
impotency.  But the film that really succeeded here was the exceptional 
`Martin' (1976) which pared all classical mythology away with rather 
startling effect - contrasting a pallid and weak bloodsucker up against 
his family who insisted with absurdly cruel inappropriateness on 
classical religious symbolism. Other notable examples might be the 
German film 혩Jonathan' (1970) which transformed vampirism into a 
metaphor for Nazism and feudalism and the underrated 혩Interview with the 
Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles' (1994) which conducted an elegant 
vampiric existential quest with the hero setting out with the question 
if he is not evil, what then is the purpose of his condition.
`The Addiction' is another of these rare attempts at re-evaluation. The 
film was directed by Abel Ferrara, who has made the likes of `Driller 
Killer' (1979), `Ms. 45' (1980), `Bad Lieutenant' (1992) and `Body 
Snatchers' (1993). Throughout almost all of Ferrara and his writing 
partner Nicholas St John's work lie twin themes - a fascination with the 
darkest depths that the human soul is capable of scouring and the belief 
in the redemptive power of Catholicism. These twin fascinations find 
their most potent expression in `Bad Lieutenant' - a muck-scouring 
excoriation of human degradation that eventually finds Catholic 
redemption in the forgiving of a killer. And in some ways `The 
Addiction' is almost like a reiteration of `Bad Lieutenant'  with Lili 
Taylor's vampire philosophy doctorate in the place of Harvey Keitel's 
drugged-out, woebegone cop,  conducting in philosophical terms the same 
descent into all that is vile before finding its salvation.
`The Addiction' has a tendency to make one feel like they are being hit 
over the head by the collected works of Western nihilist philosophy. The 
film quotes Sartre and Kierkegaard and engages in debates about 
determinism and redemption through guilt while Ferrara-regular 
Christopher Walken turns up as a vampire who sees himself as an avatar 
of Nietzschean meta-morality. It is quite the weightiest film that one 
has seen in some time. But at the same time Ferrara and St John turn it 
into an extraordinary meditation on human nature and its fundamental 
predisposition toward evil. They see the vampire as a complex metaphor 
for an evil that is endemic to human nature. "The old saying that `Those 
who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it' is a lie," 
meditates Taylor. "The real question is what can be done to stop the 
blight spreading." The film bombards one with images of Me Lei and the 
Holocaust - in the opening scene alone Taylor exits a Holocaust museum 
and debates what the point is of convicting political leaders of war 
crimes when war crimes are crimes of mass guilt. The complexity of this 
metaphor leads to some startling reinventions of classical vampire 
mythology - the vampire cannot stand to look in a mirror because mirrors 
reflect the raw, exposed face of evil; the reason they are undead is 
because evil cannot die. Ferrera also offers up some strikingly modern 
images of vampirism - in one scene Taylor shooting up blood with a 
syringe like an addict. Although after conducting such an extraordinary 
and gloomily bleak excavation of the human condition, Taylor and 
Ferrara's acceptance of the redeeming power of Catholicism at the end 
seems a little glib and even cursory.
In the end it is not the best of Ferrara's films. The philosophical 
heaviness of it stands in the way of easy entertainment value and some 
corner-cutting lower-budget values are apparent at times. But what 
cannot be denied is that it is a powerful and complex reworking of the 
central metaphors of vampirism. Compare it to `Nadja' which was released 
only a few months after `The Addiction'. Both are very similar films - 
both are shot in black-and-white and both feature a predatory female 
vampire stalking the modern world.  But whereas `Nadja' was merely 
content with conducting a stylistic pastiche of `Dracula's Daughter' 
(1936), `The Addiction' tackles the challenge of mounting an entire 
philosophical reconception of vampirism.

ADDICTION, THE (director: Abel Ferrara; cast: Lili Taylor (Kathleen
Conklin), Edie Falco (Jean), Christopher Walken (Peina), Paul Caldaron
(Professor), Kathryn Erbe (Anthropology Student), Annabella Sciorra
(Casanova),  Robert Castle (Priest), 1995)
An N.Y.U. philosophy doctoral candidate, Kathleen Conklin (Lili), gets
her doctorate despite being bitten in the neck by a vampire (Sciorra)
and becoming one herself, when pulled into an alley after attending a
lecture on the My Lai massacre in Vietnam.
This handsomely shot b/w film, relates vampyrism to the evil that is
inherent in man, that becomes his addiction. Vampires are compared to
junkies who need their fix.The film brings out a collection of
philosophers to state its case; such as, Sartre, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche,
and Heidegger. In the background, we hear funky rap music and witness
the action on the mean streets of Greenwich Village.
The film makes use of the 24-hour around the clock slide show the
Holocaust Museum in NYC features, to interject from time-to-time, the
evil of the Nazis depicted in those slides. This was a mistake. You are
comparing apples with oranges, and the film suffers with its credibility
from such an unjust comparison. In case Ferrara forgot, vampires are not
real but the Holocaust was only too real.
The film itself, does not feature much action, relying on a lot of
chatter and non-communicative conversations to get its story across.
There is one mass bloodsucking scene at the film's climax, as Kathy
invites all her college mentors and personal acquaintances over to help
her celebrate her attaining of a doctoral degree with a reception. She
thanks them for coming, and then says, `I'd like to take a minute to
share with you a little of what I've learned while studying for my
doctorate.' Then she pounces on one of her professors, sucks out a
mouthful of blood, and spits it out at the crowd. Now that's what we
were waiting for, since the film did not feel quite right up to that
point. It felt better being more campy.
Despite the short-comings of the plot, Lili Taylor gives a credible
performance. She is especially good in the scene where she is pulling
out her own molar to prove a philosophical point. She is the best thing
about the film, playing a vampire addict who just wants her fix.
This thinking man's vampire movie, is a natural for the midnight cult
audience, but will seem out of place in a prime time slot. Christopher
Walken is a natural for this type of film, but has a part that might as
well be nonexistent. We don't see him until the film is nearly over, and
when we do see him, he doesn't do much, except drain the blood of the
still-not-evolved vampire, Kathy.
One of the many problems with this low-budgeter, is that it couldn't
tell its story without the philosophers. It needs their explanations to
explain itself. The story, which could have been more interesting if
developed properly, never has a chance to really express itself without
being explained away in philosophical terms. All its weird subjects are
brazenly brought up and we are teased with the weight of their meaning,
and then we are stopped short from following through on what their
implications are. For instance, the topic of free will, always a good
philosophical one; but, when Kathy says it is now my will against
theirs, we are not quite sure what she means by that. When she confronts
her next chosen victim and is ready to vamp them, she asks them to look
her in the face and tell her, convincingly, to let go. But what does
that mean. Unless this is a blatant call against pacifism, saying we
have to get ready to kick ass whenever we are set-upon.
The film's theme becomes, that existence itself is the search for relief
from our habits, and existence is the only relief we can find from our
habits that makes sense. What Kathy learns from her vampire guru, Peina
(Walken), not her college prof, is that we are all evil: we must
annihilate the self. So the question becomes, what should we do, if we
can't kill what is dead...You will do anything for a fix, says Kathy. An
addiction is an evil thing to have. And if you are faced with choosing
you or them, jumping or being pushed, Kathy still believes that you must
satisfy your own needs first. Or, you can do with as little as you
possibly can, says the diet-conscious and wise vampire, Peina.
If you want to see a film that is more credible than this one, that
handles the same subject, but injects more life and fear into its story,
and less philosophy and guilt-ridden religious themes, check out Larry
Fessenden's Habit.

Way back in 1995, we went to the newly built 20 screen cineplex-a-rama to
take in NADJA, a black and white avant-garde vampire movie that was doing
the rounds at the time. Before going in, a nice usher asked to see our
ticket stubs, so as to make sure that we actually had a ticket to see
NADJA. We thought, "Hey, NADJA must be amazingly popular if they're
checking tickets to the midnight show!" It turns out this is not why they
were checking stubs (we hear the roving gangs aren't much a problem there
anymore) and we were totally alone in the theater. We could have heckled
the screen all we wanted, but instead we sat quietly and watched NADJA,
the boring vampire movie. It was pretty darn bad, with a slow plot and
weird camera effects that wore out their welcome about two seconds after
they started, and lots of pretentious dialogue. The only thing that made
NADJA even slightly watchable were some fairly funny lines, like when Van
Helsing (Peter Fonda) explains why he did Dracula a favor by killing him.
"He was all bloated and surrounded by zombies," he explains, "kinda like
Elvis at the end."
Two years older and wiser, we rented THE ADDICTION, 1995's other black and
white avant-garde vampire movie. We think Santiana said something we
should have remembered, but we're pretty sure it will be repeated if we
really need to know it.
KATHLEEN: The old adage from Santiana, that those who don't learn from
history are doomed to repeat it, is a lie. There is no history. Everything
we are is eternally with us. Our question is therefore, what can save us
from our crazy insistence of spreading the blight in ever widening
circles?
Oh, right. Thanks. In THE ADDICTION, the main character is a doctoral
student in philosophy named Kathleen who is walking down the street one
night when she is attacked by a vampire (Annabella Sciorra). Only in New
York City. OK, vampires could attack people anywhere. But only in New York
City would the cops react with the amazing indifference that we see in
this film. In any case, the doctors think that the traumatic experience
has aggravated a minor case of anemia that Kathleen didn't know she had,
and she is released.
Of course it isn't really anemia. Kathleen is now a vampire, a creature of
the night, nosferatu. Which means she wears sunglasses and becomes
unbearably pretentious. She goes to her classes and rants against the
concept of free will, while her friends worry about her.
And then comes the blood lust. At first, Kathleen gets the blood she needs
by using a hypodermic to take blood from street people and shooting up
with it. Remember, the name of the movie is THE ADDICTION. Get it?
Soon Kathleen moves on to living targets, sucking the blood out of mentor,
a jive-talking youth, and some random anthropology student she meets in
the school library.
KATHLEEN: Oh, the stench here is worse than a charnel house. This is a
graveyard. Rows of crumbling tombstones, viscous libelous epitaphs. And
we're all drawn here like flies.
Wow! So you don't like the library, already! For some reason, all the
vampires in this movie have to demand that their victims tell them to go
away. This way, when they get bitten, it's the victim's own fault, the
victim's own free will, or so the argument is presented to us. We suppose
that the heavy dose of Cypress Hill on the soundtrack, with their message
that consenual crimes (i.e. using drugs) are OK, is probably supposed to
underscore this theme. Profound, huh?
KATHLEEN: Sure, it's easy to spot in people like me. The cancer's grown
obvious. But you're as terminal as I am, you know that? You're as addicted
as I am. It's the nature of the organism.
Zing! You showed us what for, Kathleen. On to the actors. The biggest name
in the cast is Christopher Walken, no stranger to either horror movies or
bad horror movies. He shows up for about ten minutes, suggests Kathleen
read NAKED LUNCH, and calls her 'nothing' about twenty times, apparently
because he can defecate and she can't.
Lili Taylor, as Kathleen, gives a pretty standard performance for this
kind of role. She gives a painfully self aware performance, but she is
playing a painfully pretentious character so we guess it fits. She also
amused us because of her resemblance to Gen X spokesperson and comedienne
Janeane Garofalo, so we guess you can say we were happy with her in
general.
What annoyed us so fully about this film is that it has no entertainment
value. It is totally obsessed with its 'message.'
KATHLEEN: Some things are more important that others. Besides, aren't you
the one who eschews speculative philosophy? 
Large portions of the movie seemed like a lesson in philosophy, with
people quoting Sartre and reaffirming that Kirkagaard was right. This goes
on forever. Didn't director Abel Ferra (BAD LIEUTENANT) realize that this
was a vampire film? And vampire films should be either scary or fun?
Instead we get LOST BOYS 3: THE DISSERTATION. It's EXOTICA with fangs. Or
considering that the Janeane Garofalo look-a-like's best friend is tall
and blonde, maybe it's THE TRUTH ABOUT BATS AND FOGS. It would be the
second vampire movie Janeane Garofalo has been in, the other being REALITY
BITES.
The only entertaining moment in the film is when, after obtaining her
doctorate, Kathleen sucks the blood out of one of the professors on her
dissertation committee. We're pretty sure she meant this act as social
commentary on her student loans, but the rest of the movie showed us
nothing interesting.
JEAN: So you what, ur, you want an apology for ethical relativism or something?
THE GUYS AT STOMP TOKYO: No, just an apology for this movie.
