     MYSTERY TRAIN is one of those secret goodies that cool people tell
their friends about. Often these cool things are cult favorites and
such.  I don't know as how MYSTERY TRAIN has any kind of a following; I
found it by accident at the foodstore where I get my product to write
these things.  I do know this: it is one particular hoot and I will be
looking up some other of J.  Jarmusch's films.  His most recent credit
was A NIGHT ON EARTH, but that didn't get much respect so watch for
future pieces on his earlier work such as STRANGER THAN PARADISE.
Jarmusch can be seen as an actor in a little film called IN THE SOUP.
     MYSTERY TRAIN takes place in Memphis.  It has three intertwined
stories (you can get this much off of the box like I did), one
involving a young Japanese couple going to Graceland, an Italian
heiress, and finally a trio on the run, two of which are Steve Buscemi
(RESERVOIR DOGS, AIRHEADS) and Joe Strummer of the Clash.
     ... in the hotel rooms, on the radio, statues, you name
it, the king is everywhere and where he isn't as a picture or a statue,
there's someone to tell you a story about his ghost and where it was
seen last.
     The sight gags involving Screamin' Jay Hawkins as a hotel manager
are worth the price of admission alone.  :-)
