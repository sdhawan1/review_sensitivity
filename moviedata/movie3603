     CAPSULE: Well-produced, well-directed, but a fairly weak theme.
This is a film that tells you that you can be everything you want to be
if you just decide to be true to yourself and if you happen to have a
lot of money.  Rufus Sewell, Minnie Driver, and Nigel Hawthorne star.
The film is competently made but the story is muddled.  Rating: 4 (0 to
10), 0 (-4 to +4)
   - The story deals with an extremely wealthy British family who own a
     fantastic farm out somewhere in the American West.  Ross (Rufus
     Sewell) is fairly normal and is trying to sell off the family's
     wine stock in order to buy a local manganese mine and get his own
     fortune.  His brother has gone off to live in the woods.  Uncle
     Cullen (Nigel Hawthorne) dresses in Eastern robes and has plans to
     live at the top of a column like the hermit St. Simeon.  Living
     all around the farm are eccentrics.  Coming to visit is Ross's
     wealthy girlfriend Kendal (Minnie Driver) and her friend Laurie
     (Amelia Heine).
   - Written and directed by John Huddles, who does not make very clear
     what he is driving at.
   - Apparently trying to go for the same sort of audience as HAROLD
     AND MAUDE, but the deep meanings all seem to fall flat.
   - Tone of the film begins madcap, but it becomes serious before
     long.  Different people try to reach the top of Uncle Cullen's
     column in different ways.
   - Pleasant photography of the farm only underscores the wealth of
     the family and hence undercuts the theme.  Would you and I have
     the same set of options?  There were a few errors in the
     photography and parts of scenes that go out of focus.
   - Some scenes seem to go on and on.
   - This should be a G-rated script.
