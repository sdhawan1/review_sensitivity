Odysseus the cunning ruler of Ithica, who fought at the sides of
Achilles, and brought about the fall of Troy with his ingenious
contraption - the Trojan Horse. Who defied Poseidon, and claimed the
right of victory over Troy as his own; thus angering the gods and was
cursed for twenty years, never to return to his home land and fair
Penelope.
Dear Odysseus,
A few simple words from a lowly movie critic.
Have you ever heard of the phrase, "I'm sorry, I was wrong."
Obviously not. I guess it takes some people, especially Greek heroes of
the tragic realm, a lot longer to realise that they have made a mistake.
A simple apology would have saved Odysseus, and his crew a lot of
unnecessary demise and heart ache.
"PENELOPE" a non-rhyming poem by Tim Voon.
Penelope, fair Penelope. I weep for you.
Whilst you raised your son alone, and watched your mother-in-law die,
Your stubborn husband was being tossed through and fro on the waves of
destiny.
He claimed to be forever loyal, and loving,
He was in truth having one heck of a time in the bed of Circe (10
years);
When he was through with her, he moved on to Calypso (5 years).
I guess one goddess was not enough to quench his lusty loins.
Fair Penelope, ever true.
You kept your word, and lay not with another man,
If only your Odysseus was as pure, as your sweet, gentle heart.
You deserved better.
Comment: Now lets hear the tale again, Homer Simpson style.
